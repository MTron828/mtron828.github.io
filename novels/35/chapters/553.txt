At Han Li’s current cultivation, even without using either the blood-red cloak or the Thunderstorm Wings, he was capable of flying at an astonishing speed. In less than half a month, Han Li arrived at the desolate island that had once been the location of the Exquisite Sound Sect’s hidden city. After sweeping his spiritual sense across the island, he didn’t find a single soul. It seemed he would have to search for humans elsewhere and acquire the information from them.

Han Li glanced around before casually choosing a direction, and disappearing in a streak of azure light.

Since the Exquisite Sound Sect had moved after establishing their city on this island, they shouldn’t have moved far away. Additionally, the nearby seas should be an area where some of the surviving human cultivators have gathered. Han Li was confident that with his vast spiritual sense, he would be able to find some human cultivators without much effort. As expected, about half a day later, Han Li discovered traces of many human cultivators on a medium sized island.

Looking down from the sky, he saw many male and female cultivators being besieged by two grade four demon beasts from the nearby seas.

When Han Li spotted a few familiar faces among them, he faintly smiled.

Soon after, he used the appearance exchange art to assume the form of a dark-skinned, middle-aged man. He then casually launched two azure swordstreaks at the demon beasts with a wave of his hand. With a flash of light, a hole appeared through the heads of each of the demon beasts as they fell to the ground.

This sudden display had alarmed the many cultivators below, and they immediately turned their heads towards the sky to discover Han Li. An uproar arose among the cultivators at the appearance of the newly arrived expert.

After consulting amongst themselves, a large man with an embroidered robe eventually flew towards Han Li.

“Many thanks for Senior’s assistance. Is there anything that us Juniors may help you with?”

Although the large, embroidered-robed man spoke with a respectful tone, a trace of unease could be seen on his face. Just why did this Core Formation cultivator suddenly appear at this island?

Han Li didn’t immediately respond upon seeing the embroidered-robed man, Yi Jing, who had teleported with Han Li to Profound Depths Island. Han Li narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze past the rest of the cultivators, only to recognize the scar-faced man Xu Yun. None of the other cultivators that had arrived at Wondrous Depths Island along with him were present.

As for Yi Jing and Xu Yun, it seemed they had failed at forming their cores, as they were still at the late Foundation Establishment despite the many years that had passed.

Yi Jing grew somewhat nervous upon seeing Han Li continue looming in silence. After a moment of hesitation, he was about to speak again when Han Li cut him off, “I am looking for the Exquisite Sound Sect’s hidden city. Do you know the next time it will be open and where it will be?”

With an indifferent expression, Han Li gazed intently at Yi Jing.

When he heard Han Li’s question, Yi Jing’s expression relaxed and he tactfully replied, “Senior, the Exquisite Sound Sect’s city will be opening in about a month, and is set to open at Twin Peaks Island. It is several days west of here, and if Senior wishes to go, Junior can bring him there.”

Han Li shook his head and mildly said, “There’s no need for that. It’ll be fine if you just give me a map.” He had no interest in reminiscing about times long past with this person.

The man was quite lucky. He had managed to survive the Beast Torrent, but the others likely hadn’t shared the same fate as him, causing Han Li to feel a slight sadness.

“Yes! Senior, here is a map of the sea and the location of the hidden city.”

Yi Jing revealed slight disappointment, but he still hoped to forge a friendly relationship with the Senior before him. With each passing day, the Outer Star Seas became increasingly dangerous for human cultivators. It would be greatly advantageous for him to be acquainted with a Core Formation cultivator.

But after taking another glance at Han Li’s detached expression, he could only drop the matter and take out a jade slip from within his robes. He recorded the location of the Exquisite Sound Sect into the jade slip and offered it to Han Li with both hands.

Han Li received it with a nod and took a quick look through it with his spiritual sense. Then without the slightest intention of staying, Han Li rushed through skies in a streak of azure light.

The low grade cultivators that were left behind gazed at him with envy. Nowadays in the Outer Star Seas, cultivators at Foundation Establishment and lower didn’t have the freedom to stray too far from their cave residences.

Han Li wasn’t about to meekly wait for another month as he feared that if he didn’t leave as soon as possible, Feng Xi would come knocking at his door. As a result, he was prepared to pay the Exquisite Sound Sect a significant sum to quietly teleport back to the Inner Star Seas. Of course, if they refused or became too greedy, he wasn’t going to shy away from using force. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Several days later, Han Li arrived at Twin Peaks Mountain. The island was quite expansive and had two huge mountains that were nearly the same in height.

After flying around of the mountains several times, he found the entrance to the hidden city as described on the map. After a moment of hesitation, Han Li changed his appearance back to what he had used when he had last visited the city. He then descended at the center of the mountain and took several steps towards a tree that was ten meters wide and about a hundred meters tall.

He expressionlessly glanced at the huge tree and couldn’t help but scoff. He lightly flicked his finger, sending three orbs of white light to directly knock against the tree’s bark.

A short moment later, azure light flashed and an opening appeared within the tree bark. A white-clothed old man at late Foundation Establishment walked out. He was the same gatekeeper that was in charge of the city entrance the last time he was here.

The old man recognized Han Li at a glance.

After all, there were very few Core Formation cultivators that had attended the meetings of the hidden city. Additionally, he had caught a few rumors during the last opening of the market city about how this cultivator had managed to single handedly suppress over ten Core Formation cultivators. It was very likely that the person in front of him was a Nascent Soul cultivator.

Upon seeing Han Li, the old man lowered his head and hastily gave him a deep salute, “So it was Senior Li. I hope Senior won’t take offense, but may I ask what is your business for coming? There is still another month before our hidden city convenes. There are no treasures for Senior to browse.”

The old man spoke with a respectful tone, but his eyes appeared puzzled.

Han Li examined the old man and raised his head before speaking in a deliberately arrogant manner, “I haven’t come for the hidden city. I’ve come to meet with either Sect Master Fan or Elder Yun.”

“You wish to see the Sect Master or Elder Yun?”

The old man paused for a moment before revealing a trace of hesitation.

“What? Is there a problem?” Han Li’s tone was void of emotion and his expression grew eerie.

When the old man saw this, he shivered and immediately smiled, saying, “Of course not!” A trace of cold sweat could be seen on his brow.

After some thought, the old man sincerely said, “Were it anyone else, it wouldn’t do. But since Senior personally arrived, then it must be about something important. This little old man will report back. As it just so happens, Sect Leader Fan recently arrived to take care of the arrangements for the hidden city. Senior, please wait for a moment!” He decided to hand off this troublesome matter to those above him. He couldn’t afford to offend such a fearsome character!

Han Li was happy to find that Lady Fan was present and his expression relaxed. He then said, “Then please be quick about it. I don’t have much time.”

The old man felt relief and hastily replied, “Yes, Junior will use a voice transmission talisman to inform the Sect Master. It will only take a moment!” If Han Li decided to force his way through, he would only be able to watch helplessly. There was no way he would throw his life away to try to block him. As a result, he took out a sound transmission talisman in front of Han Li and sent it into the tree’s opening.

After seeing the the sound transmission talisman disappear, Han Li expressionlessly asked, “Where is Elder Yun? Why isn’t he with your Sect Master?”

The old man’s expression grew unsightly. He hesitated for a moment before muttering, “This... Junior truly doesn’t know about the whereabouts of Sect Leader Yun. Matters regarding this recent market city have all been handled by the Sect Master alone.”

Upon seeing the old man’s expression, Han Li was sure he knew what the old man had meant. With a cold chuckle, he no longer continued asking the old man any questions, much to his relief.

A short moment later, the white clothed cultivator received a sound transmission talisman. After quickly examining it with his spiritual sense, he respectfully said, “Senior Li, our Sect Master invites you inside for a chat. I will lead the way.”

Han Li indifferently replied, “Go ahead.”

The city below the tree was largely the same as the last hidden city with two floors making up a large underground expanse. But this time, apart from the many low grade Exquisite Sound Sect disciples preparing the city, there were no others inside.

The old man quickly brought Han Li to a stone wall that was attended by two outstandingly beautiful female cultivators.

The two female cultivators both respectfully bowed to Han Li with flushed complexions and charmingly said, “We pay our respects to Senior Li. The Sect Master welcomes you and is honored by your presence.”
