Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 167"

Why Is That Guy Here?

"Lost Yak reporting in."

Upon hearing this, Minjuri looks at him with surprised eyes.

"Your nickname is Lost Yak?"

"Yeah."

"I didn't know that."

Since it has come to this, he decided to reveal his nickname.

There's no way to hide it forever.

"Of course, even this isn't my real nickname."

It's not the right time to reveal that he's still known as the Black Scythe.

There's no benefit in attracting unnecessary attention.

"There might be people who harbor resentment towards the Black Scythe, so revealing my identity is risky."

It could even make his sister a target.

There's absolutely no advantage in revealing his identity.

"So it's better if the fact that I'm the Black Scythe comes out later."

Instead, he chose to use the name Lost Yak.

After all, even if he reveals his nickname, they won't be able to find him in the other world.

"If someone wants to track me, they need to know my customized appearance."

Since it was originally the nickname of a dead person, it should be impossible to find him.

"Minjoo, Lost Yak, welcome. Please have a seat here. Let's have a leisurely chat before other believers arrive."

"Who else is coming?"

"Of course. There are quite a few people interested in our Messenger Church."

The four of them sat down and engaged in a lively conversation.

"You reside in Seoul?"

"Yes, it only took an hour to come here."

"I see. Thank you for coming all the way. The fact that both of you took this step means that you love and respect the Black Scythe, right?"

"Oh, not exactly..."

The conversation mainly continued between Hotaesuk and Minjuri.

Ryumin just listened in silence.

Initially, there was no significant interest shown towards him, and he had nothing to say.

"There's something I've been wanting to ask when I meet Minjoo."

"What is it?"

"Are you, by any chance, in a special relationship with the Black Scythe?"

"What? What do you mean?"

"Is it a yes?"

"No, no way!"

Minjuri, who was shouting, glanced at Ryumin.

'Why is she giving me a suspicious look?'

Hotaesuk scratched his head and asked again.

"Huh? Wasn't it?"

"No! Absolutely not!"

"You haven't even actually contacted the Black Scythe?"

"No, I haven't. The Black Scythe is someone I met in the other world."

Seeing her nervously clap her hands, Hotaesuk finally believed her.

"Haha, sorry. I've been thinking that you and the Black Scythe were lovers since the first time I saw you... Luckily, it was a misunderstanding."

Despite Minjuri's expression changing subtly at the mention of luck, Hotaesuk didn't pay much attention.

"So, the partner you went to Nigeria with wasn't Minjoo?"

"I've never been to Nigeria in my entire life."

"I see. That's fortunate..."

"But why is this house so old? I came expecting a grand sect, and..."

Apparently irritated by the mention of luck, Minjuri interrupted and criticized the building.

"This house was where our late grandmother lived. We knocked down some walls and did a bit of renovation to use the space more extensively."

"Oh... I see."

As Minjuri awkwardly searched for words, people started coming in one by one.

They were all unfamiliar faces, but judging by their appearances, it was clear they were players.

As more people gathered, the number exceeded ten.

Suddenly, a group of about ten people entered noisily.

It was none other than the Jang Yong-ho group.

"Hello! We all want to join the Messenger Church, so we came!"

"Oh, welcome!"

With the Jang Yong-ho group entering, the once empty space suddenly felt crowded.

'Yong-ho's real face is the same as in reality.'

Thinking such, unexpectedly, he also encountered an unexpected acquaintance.

"Isn't that person, the celebrity Seo Arin?"

"Wow, I didn't expect to see Seo Arin in person."

The person who entered was indeed Seo Arin.

Perhaps due to her rising popularity, many people recognized her.

"Oh, Seo Arin is here?"

"Noble One?"

"Yes, Seo Arin. Isn't she exactly like her face? She said she would definitely come last time! I believed her!"

"Promises should be kept."

As Seo Arin, who was shyly answering, suddenly glanced in their direction.
ChatGPT

"Oh? Yes... Mr. Ryumin?"

Trying to say she's a prophet, Ryumin awkwardly smiled at Seo Arin, who hastily corrected herself.

"Haha... Hello."

"What brings you here? Is Mr. Ryumin also interested in the Black Scythe?"

"No, I just came to have a look."

"I never expected to meet you in a place like this."

"Me neither."

"But the person next to you looks very familiar..."

When Minjuri muttered like that while looking at him, Eom Junseok suddenly intervened.

"That person is the Noble One."

"Noble One? Is that the Buffer?"

"Yes, I am the Noble One."

"Ah, nice to meet you. I knew there was something familiar about your face from the other world."

As Seo Arin said so, she discreetly approached Minjuri and whispered.

"Hey, I, um, I have something curious to ask..."

"Yes?"

"Are you in contact with the Black Scythe in real life as well?"

"No, I've never met him."

"Oh, really?"

Seo Arin's face turned gloomy.

Trying to change the atmosphere, Ryumin asked, "Arin, what about Director Ahn and President Ma? Didn't they come with you?"

"I suggested it, but they weren't interested, so I came alone."

Hearing the answer, Ryumin sighed.

"Well, those guys see the Black Scythe as a rival and are cautious, so it's not surprising."

At that moment, Minjuri, with surprised eyes, asked, "You... How do you know Actress Seo Arin?"

"We're neighbors. She lives upstairs in our building. She's also an entertainer affiliated with the company I invested in."

"Oh, really?"

Minjuri silently observed Seo Arin for a while. Reading her thoughts, it seemed to be a subtle gaze of caution.

"Don't worry, Juri. I'm too old to date anyone else."

Glancing around, Ryumin noticed that nearly 30 people had gathered and were engaged in lively conversations.

"So many people have gathered."

There's no need to think grandly just because it's called the Messenger Church.

It's simply a gathering of fans of the Black Scythe, a fan club meetup.

"They've probably arranged this gathering solely to bring the believers together."
ChatGPT

It was a group that worshipped people rather than real gods, so the thirty individuals gathered had nothing to do other than chatting.

Tick-tock -

Checking the wall clock, they realized that the agreed-upon time had quickly passed.

Hotaesuk, who thought it was time to leave, casually placed his foot on the furniture he had made like a desk.

"Ahem, greetings. I am Hotaesuk, the founder and leader of the Messenger Church. My nickname is NopainNogain, and I am currently a level 45 Black Mage."

As he began speaking, the murmurs gradually subsided, and soon, a serene silence settled in.

"Thank you for coming to the Messenger Church. As you all may know, the Messenger Church is a group that worships the Black Scythe. Let me share the reasons why I came to admire the Black Scythe..."

Although the story became lengthy, no one took their eyes off Hotaesuk.

He spoke about his honest family background, the bullying he faced during school, and other personal experiences, yet nobody found it boring.

His voice was compelling, and there was authenticity in his words.

Seeing Hotaesuk in a different light for the first time, Ryumin secretly admired.

"Surprisingly, he has talent for preaching."

She thought he was introverted, but it seemed not.

When it came to matters related to the Black Scythe, he spoke eloquently and transformed into a different person.

"In this way, the Black Scythe has given me many enlightenments in my life. I firmly believe that he is the savior who will end the despair of this world and the only light. And I have discovered that there are surprisingly many people who share the same thoughts as me. The reason for founding the Messenger Church is also because of this..."

And then it happened.

Tap - Tap - Tap -

Amidst the preaching, an annoying sound was heard. When they turned around, a man with crutches was entering.

"Oh? Isn't that..."

Unexpectedly, the appearance of an unfamiliar figure widened Ryumin's eyes.

"Is that Joo Sungtak?"

Ranked second or third along with Makyungrok, the serial killer Joo Sungtak.

A guy who, despite having no arms and legs, showed up with prosthetics and crutches.

"Why is he here?"

Since Joo Sungtak was also a member of Plausible Virtual Space Bar (PSEBA), he could have come after seeing the promotional post.

"But he's not someone capable of challenging the Black Scythe, is he?"

With a suspicion that there might be some hidden agenda, Ryumin tried to read his thoughts.

Sure enough.

"That guy. He came to find me."
ChatGPT

More precisely, he had come to find Hwang Yongmin.

To seek revenge on Hwang Yongmin, who had made him disabled.

"He came all the way here with the thought that he could meet me if he goes to a place where players gather."

Certainly, there was no interest whatsoever in the Black Scythe.

"Amidst this, a new believer has arrived. Welcome. I am Hotaesuk, the leader of the Messenger Church."

"..."

Joo Sungtak scanned the people with a cold stare, without uttering a word.

In his mind, there was only one thought.

Among these people, there might be the one who made me like this.

A sense of vengeance.

Joo Sungtak's anger was solely directed towards Hwang Yongmin.

"Are you okay, Sir Believer? Your complexion doesn't look good."

Worried about him, Eom Junseok placed his hand on Joo Sungtak's back with a warm voice.

Tak -

"Don't touch me. I'll kill you."

In response to Joo Sungtak's abrupt reaction, Eom Junseok could only offer a nervous smile and step back.

Seeing this, people made different expressions.

Some clicked their tongues, expressing disapproval, while others looked at him with sympathy, wondering how difficult it must be for him.

Reading the mood and atmosphere, Joo Sungtak's anger grew even more, like a fire fueled with firewood.

"Do these sons of bitches look at people like that? Do I look pitiful to them? On top of that, I'm damn pissed off. I might just kill every single one of these sons of bitches."

It's understandable to feel such intense anger when in a situation that garners sympathy.

In a heated state of mind, thoughts of wanting to kill might arise.

"The problem is that he's a serial killer who easily kills people."

It might not just be a passing thought but something he could actually carry out.

"In this cramped place, using Corpse Explosion would cause tremendous casualties."

It is such a powerful skill.

"It's nerve-wracking..."

Should they leave such a ticking time bomb alone?

Or should they stop him?

The dilemma was not prolonged.

Since his distorted thoughts were transmitted.

"Sons of bitches, no. I checked each face, but there's no one here who made me like this. Damn it. I must have taken a wrong step. Should I kill these unlucky bastards here and make a run for it?"
ChatGPT

Listening to the voice, Ryumin felt sincerity.

'It's dangerous to fight within this space.'

Feeling the need to lure the guy outside, Ryumin whispered to Minjuri.

"I need to use the bathroom for a moment."

"Yeah, go ahead."

Whether Ryumin went out or not, the people were focused solely on Hotaesuk's sermon.

Without knowing what Joo Sungtak was thinking.

'What if I quickly kill three people, secure the bodies, and then use the recently learned [Soul Storage] skill to enhance the corpse explosion? I could kill all the people here.'

Despite the large number of people, at most, they were around the same level as himself.

There wouldn't be the mental or physical capacity to deal with a sudden surprise attack.

'If done right, I could cleanly kill them all and leave.'

Without knowing what Joo Sungtak was thinking, there was little benefit in killing people for him.

At most, saving the souls and using the enhanced skill without the need for a separate soul when using it?

Despite the potential danger due to the large number of people, Joo Sungtak's mind was leaning towards killing people.

Partly because he didn't like the way those eyes looked at him with pity.

'Sons of bitches. Those who couldn't even make it to the rankings are probably mocking me for being in this state. Wait and see. Watch what an ignored disabled person like me is capable of doing. Heh heh.'

Considering the shocked expressions that would follow after the corpse explosion, laughter bubbled up.

While wearing such a sinister smile and exploring who to kill first, Joo Sungtak suddenly stiffened.

"You, you bastard!"

It was none other than the man he had been desperately searching for standing in front of the gate, wearing equipment.
