Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 249"

The Third Mission

The undead, walking like zombies, fall lifelessly to the sword.

Each time, the disciples of the Death Cult had to be surprised by the message of passing through.

Ryumin, who had already anticipated it, didn't show much surprise.

"It seems that killing the undead, who were once human, is perceived as murder."

Even though he killed summoned creatures, the system judged it as murder.

The same happened when he killed the undead angels before.

"At that time, I was surprised when the rewards came again."

Like Ryumin back then, the disciples of the Death Cult also had surprised expressions.

Perhaps they didn't expect to kill the undead and enter as a passerby.

"I didn't know either. I really didn't think it would work."

He believed it would work just because it worked on the angels before.

So, it was also a devised plan.

"Originally, the plan was just to let each other die without a plan, but..."

Because he had the card called 'Commander,' he came up with this method.

Maybe killing the undead is better than killing people?

Swoosh!

"Growl!"

"Keak!"

Hundreds of summoned creatures made by John Delgado disappeared under the Death Cult's attack.

Ryumin was looking at the scene with satisfaction, but he didn't know.

He didn't know that behind him, Kristin was looking at him with a strange gaze.

"Why are John Delgado's summoned creatures willingly dying? When I first saw the approaching horde of summoned creatures, Kristin hesitated about the battle. She thought John Delgado had come to kill her again. However, the undead seemed to have no intention of attacking. It was surprising, especially since even she, with no combat ability, could have been stabbed to death with a sword. So, she was even more surprised. Why? Why are they coming forward to die? It must be because John Delgado ordered them to attack the Death Cult. It wasn't just Kristin who had this question. 'What are you doing, you idiot!?' It was none other than Berber. 'Are you wasting those precious summoned creatures?' He couldn't understand John Delgado's actions."

Title: "Fury of the Despair Cult Leader - Episode 250"

The fact that the Despair Cult disciples had already been annihilated was frustrating enough, but the cult leader, now that he had resurrected the corpses, was mindlessly attacking with no apparent purpose.

"Damn it, I can't just stand by like this."

Berber moved discreetly.

"In this opening, I'll kill the cult leader and become the leader of the Despair Cult."

Even if he lost all the disciples and had to start from the beginning, it was okay. They could be recruited gradually, right?

Silently approaching John's back, Berber raised his axe.

"Die."

But before the axe could strike, something fell with a thud.

"Huh?"

It was his own arms holding the axe.

At that moment, forgetting the remaining shock and screams, a winged undead carrying a scythe appeared.

It was Sariel, the summoned creature that John Delgado boasted as the strongest.

"Aaaah!"

Whether she was shocked at seeing the Archangel or screamed due to pain, it was unclear, but it didn't matter.

For John Delgado, the most important thing was, above all, the elimination of traitors.

"Did you think I wouldn't know that you were aiming for the leader position?"

"Yes, you...!"

John Delgado, who openly sneered, issued a chilling command.

"Kill him. Sariel."

Before the words were even finished, the scythe passed through Berber's neck.

Thud-

John Delgado, who casually observed the fallen face, felt a newfound gratitude towards his master.

If it weren't for the swing of the black scythe, the one with the severed neck would have been him, not Berber.

Ryumin, who had watched John's safety from a distance, subtly smiled.

"With this, the Despair Cult is wiped out. The variables are blocked."

The remaining variable was the assault of the Archangel, and since they didn't know when it would happen, there was no time to relax yet.

Swoosh!

With the sound of a blade piercing, the last remaining summoned creature collapsed.

After all the undead had been annihilated, Ryumin asked the Death Cult disciples, "Is there anyone among you who didn't pass?"

Without exception, the disciples shook their heads.

All 400 members of the Death Cult had successfully entered the list of survivors.

"You were lucky. Killing the undead counted."

Since they had even pretended not to know anything, people wouldn't suspect anything.

All of this was part of Ryumin's plan.
ChatGPT

Slowly, as the situation was getting under control, someone's shout echoed.

"Let's stop fighting now! The quota has been filled!"

All eyes turned to the progress window.

[Current Survivors: 1,152] [Current Passers: 1,152/1,152]

The number of survivors and passers matched. It meant that further killings were meaningless.

People who hadn't planned to kill more than two individuals each withdrew, putting away their weapons.

"Now, there's only one thing left."

They just had to endure until the time limit expired.

Although they couldn't relax completely, considering that someone might suddenly rush in to kill again.

In the tense silence, Kristin still couldn't dispel her doubts.

"What happened? John Delgado's summoned creatures didn't show any intention to attack. It was as if they were telling us to kill ourselves and survive."

The black scythe had suggested observing the situation, and luckily, summoned creatures had rolled in just in time.

Those summoned creatures showed no intention of attacking either.

Was this really a coincidence?

As Kristin pondered, trying to dispel her suspicions, the time limit was reached.

[The time limit has expired.] [You have succeeded in the second mission.] [Survivors: 1,152, Deaths: 1,151.] [Congratulations! The third mission will begin shortly.]

Upon seeing the message, Ryumin looked for Kristin.

"You know, right? Your role is crucial in this third mission."

"Yes... I know."

Although Kristin nodded, Ryumin didn't miss the fleeting moment of worry that crossed her face.

"Don't worry. I'll protect you. Just focus on maintaining your skill. The lives of a thousand depend on your skill."

"Oh, I understand. Lord of the Black Scythe. I won't disappoint you."

Kristin finally showed a determined gaze.

The Death Cult disciples, who had heard the mission in advance, changed their mindset while swallowing their saliva.

The third mission was said to be even more dangerous and difficult.
ChatGPT

Of course, those who were not part of the Death Cult were waiting for the message without any particular worries.

Then it happened.

"Huh? What's that?"

Suddenly, green lines appeared on the shared ground, countless short dotted lines extending horizontally, about shoulder-width apart.

As people were puzzled, the awaited message appeared.

[Before revealing the third mission, please move to the green marking lines on the floor.] [There are 1,152 marking lines, one for each survivor.]

"Marking lines?"

"It seems like we need to move over there."

People moved according to the instructions without any complaints.

"Do we just stand here one by one?"

"Oh? When I stepped on the line, it turned red."

"It feels like a parking guidance system."

As people stood on the marking lines, they turned red.

The numerous green lines on the floor gradually changed to red.

Some people were running around, trying to find a spot.

As everyone stood on the lines, they realized that they were arranged horizontally.

As soon as the last person stepped on the line, a message appeared, as if acknowledging their readiness.

[The third mission will now begin.]

Endure the pain.
If you don't die within the 30-minute time limit, you will pass.

[A projectile that deals damage will be launched from the front every 2 seconds.] [Each player is set to receive one projectile.] [The damage of the projectile increases progressively over time.] [Success will grant a round reward.] [Current Survivors: 1,152] [Time remaining until the end of the round: 00:29:59]

"What is this? Endure the pain?"

"Endure pain for 30 minutes?"

Brief confusion ensued.

Without giving time for questions, projectiles came flying from the front.

Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!

Fired like bullets, they hit each person's chest accurately, without missing a single one.

"Ugh, wha, what was that just now?"

"Black bullets?"

Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!

Looking to see where they were coming from, they were being launched from a distance at regular intervals.

As if firing bullets every 2 seconds.

Bang-bang-bang-bang-bang-bang!

"Ugh, do we have to keep getting hit by these for 30 minutes?"
ChatGPT

"It's not that painful, but it feels disgusting."

Bullets fly in every 2 seconds, hitting the chest.

It feels like being shot in a line, one after another.

The mood is bad, but it's not unbearable.

It's just a bit stinging, like getting hit by rubber pellets?

For tankers with high defense, it doesn't feel like anything at all.

"It's nothing."

"I can handle this much."

"Don't get too comfortable. It might get tougher later."

"That's right. Didn't you hear the explanation? The damage increases as time goes on."

"Well, if this is the damage in the early stages, there's nothing to worry about, right?"

"Anyway, I'm a tanker, so I'm not worried."

People with worries, those feeling relieved, and those feeling confidentâ€”various reactions were shown. But they all shared something in common: they didn't know how challenging enduring the pain could be.

"Enduring pain is more difficult than you think. In other words, enduring torture."

Now, the damage is low, and many are confident. But after 10 minutes, their expressions will change.

"Probably won't be able to make a sound. After 20 minutes, they'll be screaming for mercy."

Imagine enduring the pain of being pricked with a needle every 2 seconds.

Absolutely impossible to endure for more than 5 minutes.

"After 5 minutes, it's like being pricked 150 times. So, after about 25 minutes, it's almost like annihilation."

Of course, this is for ordinary people with standard armor. Tankers might endure a bit more, but still, it's challenging up to 30 minutes.

"Before that, there will be people leaving their positions because of the pain."

It's quiet now, but wait for 10 minutes.

Someone will emerge, hiding behind others' backs.

Then, the person in front will have to take two hits instead of one.

Unintentionally becoming a human shield.

"Inevitably, trouble will arise between them, and amidst the hail of bullets, they might start killing each other, screaming for mercy. In the midst of it, people hiding to survive will emerge."

It's truly a vortex of chaos.

Just wait for 10 minutes.

"People calling it 'Extreme Round 15' is not for nothing. There's a reason why less than 50 people survive."
ChatGPT

Huh Taeseok, Russell, and Jo Yongho, none of them made it past Round 15.

The same went for Kristin.

"In the past, I was luckily saved by John Delgado in Round 11, but unfortunately, here, while trying to help others, I died. Using the area-of-effect healing spell leaves the caster defenseless, so I got swarmed."

As soon as Kristin, who was healing them, died, hundreds couldn't endure and perished, crumbling like a dam.

After that, using each other as shields, sacrificing teammates became a common strategy.

Only tanks with defensive skills like Ma Kyungrok and Ahn Sangcheol, along with other tanks and a Grand Mage, managed to endure.

"If there's no healing, it seems impossible to survive."

That's why Kristin is crucial in this mission.

"This time, the outcome will be different from last time. I've decided to save Kristin no matter what."

About 5 minutes must have passed by now.

When the damage became irritatingly noticeable, people started using emergency treatment on themselves.

"Using emergency treatment makes it a bit better, right?"

"Let's endure it together!"

"But can we avoid this?"

"I tried, but it's too fast to dodge."

Since it's faster than bullets, avoiding it is impossible.

Using someone else as a shield might work.

Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat!

After surpassing 8 minutes, the damage intensified once again.

The expressions on people's faces visibly contorted.

It hasn't even been 10 minutes, and they already started feeling it's getting difficult to endure.

At that moment, Kristin's area-of-effect healing began.

Swoooosh!

A green light, like a budding sprout, gently enveloped their bodies.

It was a large-scale area-of-effect heal-over-time skill called [Sanctuary], healing all players within a radius of 500 meters.

"This...!"

"The pain is fading away."

"It's a Priest's skill!"

Since the radius was wide, all 1,152 players entered the healing range.

Kristin intentionally positioned herself in the center, contributing to the effect.

"Everyone, don't leave your positions and stay still! I'll heal you all!"

Because it was a heal-over-time, it recovered every second.

The pain disappeared as if washed away.

Not only was the healing amount significant, but it was incomparably higher than emergency treatment.

While everyone seemed calm, the complexion of Kristin, the caster, wasn't good at all.
ChatGPT

Because she wasn't included in the healing range.

"Ugh, it hurts...."

"Don't worry."

The warm light enveloped Kristin's wounds.

"I'll protect you."

Ryumin's hand, beside her, touched Kristin's back.

The temporary heal skill quickly mended her injuries.

Although the pain disappeared, Kristin couldn't afford to care about such things.

"Oh, what should I do...."

Her heart was pounding so intensely that it felt like it could burst at any moment.
