Title: "Episode 215 of the 100th Regression for the Max Level Player"

"Runes of the Hero"

One week before Christmas.

A sensational post appeared on the Pleseva Cafe.

└ Content: Hello, I am the leader of the Death Cult, Nopyeinnoge.

First of all, I sincerely respect the Pleseva family who survived until the 12th round. You are truly amazing!

Now, we would like to recruit warriors who are the heroes of reversal from our Death Cult.

The Death Cult is an organization that worships the Black Scythe, who is ranked first in the entire region. Anyone who loves and admires the Black Scythe can join regardless of nationality.

However, only players are eligible to join, and carrying an ID is mandatory (you need to provide basic personal information when joining).

Unlike other religions, we do not charge any membership fees or donations (important)!

Moreover, to celebrate our recent relocation of the sect to the Seoul area, we are thinking of holding a small event.

On December 25th at 10 AM, those who join our sect will be given 10,000 points.

And not just that, the Black Scythe will personally come forward to trade the points. So, take this opportunity to join, receive points, and meet the Black Scythe in person in reality. Don't miss this golden opportunity!

For your information, for existing members who come, we will also give points on the spot, so please attend without fail!

Here is a 3-line summary for busy individuals.

◆ Event Period: December 25, 2022, 10 AM
◆ Event Content: Joining the Death Cult immediately awards 10,000 points directly from the Black Scythe (ID required)
◆ Location: Death Cult, 625 Sinsa-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul

Points are currency that can be used in the special shop.

They are considered more valuable than gold because angels have publicly announced that they cannot be earned in any way.

And they give away those points just for joining?

And that too, 10,000 points?

People who were drawn in by the provocative title could not help but leave comments.

└ Do I really get 10,000 points just by joining?
└ Of course^^
└ Is it true that the famous Black Scythe will come in person?
└ Yes! Take this opportunity to meet him in person this time!
ChatGPT

└ Why did you specifically choose Christmas day for the event? Is it because you want to see lovers fighting?

└ There's no such intention. We chose the date because it seemed meaningful to have an event on Easter. Seriously.

└ So, there won't be any fraudulent activities, right?

└ Give it a try. Let's see what happens, haha.

└ Even if real names and faces are exposed, how can there be fraud, haha.

└ If there's fraud, the Black Scythe will probably come personally to track and settle the score...

Over 50 comments were posted, but Huh Taeseok responded happily to each one.

He had posted many promotional messages before, but this level of interest was unprecedented.

It had been only two days, and the view count had exceeded 120.

"With the current Pleseva membership of 130, almost everyone must have read it, right?"

Considering that the previous post had only 20 views, this was an exceptional record.

"Can they all actually come?"

So, Christmas day, which they had been eagerly anticipating, arrived.

Ryumin and Huh Taeseok waited for the believers in the front yard of the newly prepared sect.

As it was a well-located place, passersby occasionally showed interest.

"How much time is left?"

"It's currently 9 o'clock, so there's one hour left."

"It's still far, so we can wait comfortably."

However, the players appeared earlier than expected.

"Hello, is this the Death Cult...?"

"Yes! You've come to the right place. I am the cult leader, Nopyeinnoge."

"T-then, is this person...?"

The man's gaze shifted to the side.

There stood Ryumin with a white mask, unusual equipment, and a large scythe.

It was not difficult to guess who he was.

"I am the Black Scythe."

"N-Nice to meet you. It's an honor."

While shaking hands lightly, Ryumin delved into the other person's feelings.

It was to determine whether they were a good or bad person.

"It seems they don't have any ill intentions to join."

It was a pure Pleseva member who came with admiration for the Black Scythe.

"Most Pleseva members are generally good people."

Since they had already passed the character interview, there were no visible flaws.

"Hello, I'm Chugigyung Eom Junseok. We will provide you with a queue number and an application form. Please wait while reading. When the appointed time comes, we will assist you with the registration in order."

The reason for not allowing immediate registration was not only due to the appointed time but also because of the concern that someone might run away after registering.

"I can't allow that. I need to gather as many people as possible."

The wish to have over 100 people was fulfilled faster than expected.

"Wow, is this the Death Cult?"

"Wow! I didn't expect much, but it's incredibly large!"

Suddenly, people started pouring in like a flood.

As the appointed time approached, more and more people gathered.

"Having around 100 people was a playful goal."

It was still 20 minutes until 10 o'clock, but the goal was already achieved.

"At this rate, maybe 130 people are possible."

Excluding the chairman, it was an achievable number if all Pleseva members attended.

"Now that the time has come, let's assist with the registration one by one. Starting from number 1..."

The registration process was simple. Sit in a chair, take an on-the-spot photo, write your name, date of birth, phone number, and address on the application form. Then, unless there was a natural disaster, sign a commitment to attend the Death Cult worship once a month.

It was a precaution in case someone registered but didn't actively participate.

Afterward, meet with Ryumin to use the trading feature and receive points directly.

"Oh, really 10,000 points... Thank you, Black Scythe."

"Congratulations on becoming a member of the Death Cult. Use the points wisely."

"Can I go home now?"

"You can, but if possible, I recommend listening to the speech before leaving. We'll provide information you'll regret missing."

There was no time for lengthy conversations as the next person in line was waiting.

Click-

"All right. Next, believer number 38?"

After going through the process of taking a photo, filling out personal information, and signing the commitment, the final step was to meet with the Black Scythe for the trade.

It was a simple task, but with a large number of people, there was no time to spare.

In the midst of it, he also met a familiar face.

"Black Scythe?"

"Democracy?"

He already knew that Minjuri would come, as she had invited him to join the Death Cult.

However, since the Prophet and the Black Scythe could not exist simultaneously, he went separately.
ChatGPT

"Meeting in real life for the first time, and you recognize me right away?"

"Because our faces are similar. And I heard you already joined as a disciple to the cult leader."

"Hehe, now my identity is completely revealed. Take responsibility, Black Scythe."

"I will take responsibility."

Responding seriously to a joking remark, Minjuri's face momentarily stiffened.

"Uh, um...."

Momentarily unable to find words to say, Ryumin remained nonchalant.

"Do you have anything else to say? If not, we can talk later. The next person is waiting."

"Uh, sure. See you later!"

Watching Minjuri hastily leave as if seizing an opportunity, Ryumin chuckled and welcomed the next person.

When the queue surpassed number 50, another familiar face appeared.

This time, Ryumin had to pretend not to recognize.

"Seo Arin? Are you also in the Death Cult?"

"What a disappointing thing to say. As the CPF spokesperson, I couldn't miss joining the Death Cult."

Smiling broadly, Seo Arin received 10,000 points from Ryumin and bowed.

"Thanks for the points. I'll use them well. Oh, and...."

Glancing around, Seo Arin whispered to Ryumin's ear.

"Thank you for the last time."

"Last time?"

"About the incident with Mr. Ma. You helped us so that we wouldn't be in trouble."

"I just did what was necessary. You guys didn't do anything wrong, did you?"

"Still, thank you."

Originally, they would have been dealing with various investigations if Ryumin hadn't intervened, but thanks to his help, they managed to avoid troublesome situations.

"Oh, the next person is waiting. See you later."

As Seo Arin left with a regretful expression for not having a longer conversation, the next person approached.

"There's no break in this."

If it weren't for stats, the work would be as exhausting as hard labor.

During a brief break, Ryumin checked the time and the waiting order.

"It's already approaching 10:30, and there are already 130 people here."

The initial goal of 100 people was already achieved, surpassing the expected 130.

However, looking at the entrance, people continued to come in.

"It seems even non-members somehow found out and came."
ChatGPT

Having posted on Pleseva, not only Pleseva members came, but the information had spread externally and even became news, attracting non-members.

"This should be sufficient. It's time."

As planned, it became a favorable condition to obtain the Rune of the Hero.

"Shall we start slowly?"

Just then, a group of people rushed into the sect.

"They're coming again?"

When someone looked, it was a familiar group.

"Jo Yongho?"

The Mercenary King and his mercenaries had come to the Death Cult.

"If I handle this well, can I gather all players nationwide?"

Enough of being surprised, it was time to execute the plan.

Ryumin looked at Huh Taeseok.

Catching each other's eyes, Ryumin adjusted his mask.

It was a signal to activate the Black Seed.

Huh Taeseok, nodding subtly, looked at the place where the seed was planted.

It happened to be a crowded courtyard with over a hundred people.

"If I germinate the seed now..."

A high-ranking demon would be summoned, and people would be astonished.

Of course, even if it was an Archdemon, it was Huh Taeseok's summon, so it wouldn't attack.

"I don't know what the Black Scythe is thinking, but it was a divine order, so there's no need to hesitate."

He used the skill without hesitation.

"Germinate."

In an instant, a stem shot up from the crowded ground where the players were.

"Ah, what, what is this!?"

"What's going on!?"

From the demon's stem that shot up like a utility pole, leaves with hook-like mouths opened.

Crack!

Underneath the falling leaves, a random demon landed on the ground.

"Kikik, kikik, kikik."

It was a devilin, resembling a goblin, with 2 meters tall and red skin, similar to a goblin.

"At last, kikik. In the human world, kikik. I have appeared, kikik."

No one understood what the creature, stumbling and speaking, was saying.

Nobody could understand demon language, and the sudden situation was bewildering.

However, it wasn't only the players who were bewildered.

"Human beings, kikik. So many gathered, kikik. Surprising, kikik!"

In an instant, the head of the suddenly appearing devipz fell to the ground.

Without delay, Ryumin's scythe severed the demon's neck.

It was a pitiful death that occurred within 5 seconds of being summoned.

"Summoning a demon in a sacred place. Are you in your right mind?"

Ryumin, speaking with a sly voice, issued a warning to the audience.

"Regardless of who you are, refrain from using skills in this place."

Although there was some murmuring, the situation was resolved for now.

Some ignorant summoner had summoned a demon, and Ryumin had taken care of it early on.

Of course, the summoner, Huh Taeseok, was extremely bewildered.

It was an unexpected event.

"Black Scythe. Just now..."

"Good job."

He was a bit taken aback by the sight of him nonchalantly killing the demon he had ordered to summon, but Huh Taeseok accepted it.

There must be a reason.

Having returned to his position, Ryumin smiled as he looked at the message that appeared before him.

[A crisis has been averted by defeating a high-level demon species for the first time, saving the endangered 100 individuals.] [The activation condition has been met.] [The hidden rune, 'Rune of the Hero,' will be granted!] [The acquired rune will be automatically engraved on the player's body!]

"I finally obtained it. The Rune of the Hero, one of the essential runes that must be acquired."

The condition for obtaining the rune was simple.

All that was needed was to kill one demon in front of a hundred people.

"Even that alone qualifies as saving them from a crisis."

The system recognized the appearance of a demon among defenseless individuals as a crisis.

However, the demon must be at least of the upper species level, and with the Black Seed learned at level 40, he could only summon lower to mid-level demon species.

"So, I waited until Huh Taeseok reached level 60. Because I need to kill an upper species demon."

Fortunately, the plan worked well, and he was able to obtain the rune.

Smiling under the mask, Ryumin looked at the information window that appeared before him.
