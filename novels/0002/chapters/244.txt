Title: Episode 244 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player

The Courage of Minjuri

"Since I told John to lay low for a while, he shouldn't be falling into Berber's hands, right?"

When Berber revealed his ambition to take the position of the next sect leader, John's reaction was intense.

"I knew this would happen! What should we do, Master? Should we bring that traitor here right now, strip him naked, and skin him alive?"

"Calm down, John. There's nothing to gain by killing him like that. What do you have other than self-satisfaction?"

Ryumin, who couldn't contain the anger of his slave, ordered him to hide in the Messiah's hut for a while.

"Anyway, those who reach Round 15 will die, whether it's Berber or Despair Sect."

He had no intention of sparing the killers who murdered followers of Kristin openly.

Even if he kills them, it's with the intention of using them strategically for the round conquest.

[A moment later, our plane will arrive at Incheon International Airport.]

Upon arriving in Korea, Ryumin made a call before going home, as he had received a message from Minjuri.

"Hey, Juri. You said you have something to tell me. Shall we meet now? Okay, see you there."

After finishing the call, Ryumin rode his Lamborghini to the agreed-upon location.

However, Minjuri's voice heard earlier kept replaying in his mind during the journey.

"Is something wrong? Her voice was quite low pressure...."

Well, can a person always be in a good mood?

There are times like this and times like that.

"I don't know what she wants to talk about, but it's fine. I had to meet her anyway to share the strategy. I also need to give her the invisibility potion."

The invisibility potion helps safely conquer the first mission of Round 15.

After giving one to John Delga following Kristin, he decided to give the remaining two to Seo Arin and Yamti after some consideration.

They were definitely helpful members if saved.

After about 30 minutes of driving, he arrived at the cafe where they had planned to meet.

Ding-

As he opened the door and entered, he saw Minjuri, who had come early and was waiting.

"Oh, you're here first...."

However, something seems off with her expression.

Ryumin, sitting across from her, asked with concern, "Juri."

"Uh... I'm here?"

"Have you been waiting long?"

Minjuri nodded subtly, not looking at Ryumin. It seemed like she lacked the courage to meet his eyes, almost as if she had committed a crime.

"What's going on? It's like she's avoiding eye contact as if she's guilty."

It wasn't because she had committed a sin, but rather, avoiding eye contact seemed to be a way for her to control her emotions. Ryumin wondered why.

He tried not to read Minjuri's thoughts, but it seemed he couldn't leave things as they were. He needed to understand the situation.

After about 10 seconds of silently reading her mind, he realized the reason.

"Ah."

He understood the reason why she seemed on the verge of sighing.

"Ah, when I went to the United States, I brought Seo Arin to our house."

In the process, Minjuri had misunderstood, thinking he had gone to meet his Japanese girlfriend.

"Why does this sound like unnecessary trouble... No, it's not the time to blame my brother. It's me who caused the misunderstanding."

Although there was only silence between them, Ryumin knew the situation was clear. There was a need to untangle this complicated situation.

"Juri, why is your expression like that? Is something wrong?"

For now, he pretended not to know and left room for her to initiate the conversation naturally, rather than explaining the misunderstanding abruptly.

"Well, it's..."

Minjuri, who hesitated with a vague response, finally spoke, still avoiding eye contact.

"Did you... go overseas?"

"Huh? How did you know?"

"You didn't answer my calls, so I thought something might be wrong and went to your house. There was your brother... I didn't know you had a brother."

"Ah, you met my brother? Ryuwon is my only family, four years younger. Did you see him for the first time?"

It wasn't the first time, but Minjuri nodded, still looking surprised.

"Yeah... I didn't expect to have a younger brother, so I was a bit taken aback. But what he said was even more surprising."

"Is she trying to bring up the main issue?"

Ryumin swallowed and asked, "What did he say?"

"He mentioned having a girlfriend? A Japanese..."

"Oh, that... Well..."

"How could you do that to me?"

Minjuri, who hadn't raised her eyes until now, finally looked up.
ChatGPT

Tears had silently welled up in her eyes.

"If you have a girlfriend, shouldn't you tell me directly? Do I have to hear it from someone else's mouth?"

"No, it's just..."

"Do you know how shocked and surprised I was? Aren't we friends? If you're dating, you should be able to tell me, at least."

Silently shedding tear-like drops, she spoke in a choked voice. Watching her speak so passionately, Ryumin had a thought.

"Just hiding the fact that I have a girlfriend is causing this much trouble. If she finds out that I'm the Black Scythe... during all this time, she might have considered breaking off our friendship, not wanting to associate with someone who concealed their identity, especially from their closest friend."

It seemed dizzying to think about.

He tried to keep his identity hidden from Minjuri as much as possible, but now a disdainful look was directed at him.

"Since when have you been dating? Why did you hide it from me?"

Looking at Minjuri with a sinister feeling, as if he were scrutinizing a cheating lover, Ryumin sighed and raised his hand.

"Just a moment. Let's clear up the misunderstanding."

"Misunderstanding?"

Taking the opportunity to explain, Ryumin calmly spoke, "To cut to the chase, I don't have a girlfriend."

"I don't?"

"I had traveled to Japan before, and since then, my brother misunderstood when he saw me staying out frequently. He thought I had a Japanese girlfriend."

"So... it's all my brother's misunderstanding? You don't have a girlfriend?"

With sincere eyes, Ryumin nodded.

"Yeah, I haven't been to Japan since then."

"Why didn't you tell my brother the truth?"

"I didn't want to go into unnecessary details, so I just let him misunderstand. I didn't expect you to react like this because of it."

"..."

At the mention of her reaction, Minjuri momentarily imagined how her face might look.

"Oh... what do I do?"

Unaware that it was a misunderstanding, she showed a pitiful sight, shedding tears.

Realizing that his reaction was exaggerated, she quickly composed herself.

She didn't have the courage to lift her head.

"Oh, I see... I misunderstood. I'm... sorry."

"No, I should be the one apologizing. I unintentionally caused you to misunderstand."
ChatGPT

As Ryumin apologized, Minjuri's shoulders hunched even more.

'She must feel like she wants to disappear, even into a mouse hole.'

Although the anger had subsided, the embarrassment was still lingering.

'Fool, idiot! Why did I get so angry? He's not even my boyfriend...!'

Reflecting on her own actions, Minjuri lifted her head.

"Sorry. Showing an ugly side of me. I suddenly cried, and it must have been surprising, right?"

"A bit surprising, but it's okay. It happens."

Even though Ryumin tried to put on a nonchalant smile to move past the situation, Minjuri, without any intention to let it go, spoke hesitantly.

"It might seem strange, but please don't think of it strangely. I got emotional because I thought you lied, but... it's not something to cry about, so why did I cry..."

It seemed like she wanted to somehow make him understand her behavior. Perhaps, she was afraid he might misunderstand her tears.

But Minjuri soon realized that no matter what she said, it would seem strange. It was too late to explain and be understood.

'Rather than that...'

A long silence followed.

Ryumin tried to conceal his embarrassment, but Minjuri's thoughts reached him unabated.

'No. It can't be like that.'

"Minah."

Suddenly, with a serious gaze, Ryumin looked at her and couldn't stop her.

If he could, he wanted to stop her.

He wanted to shout for her not to speak.

"I have something to say..."

But knowing that Minjuri had mustered the courage to speak up, he couldn't stop her.

"Given the situation, I'll say it. The truth is, I... like you."

"Huh?"

Though he pretended not to hear, it was futile.

"I like you."

"..."

In the end, he was confessed to.

He didn't expect it to turn out this way with an honest confession.

'From trying to clear up a misunderstanding to receiving a confession...'

He saw the future 7 seconds ahead, but there was no way to handle it.

Minjuri had already made up her mind, and there was no turning back.

'This is the worst.'
ChatGPT

Minjuri is not disliked.

He genuinely acknowledges her as a very good friend, a necessary buffer in his life.

However, he cannot reciprocate a confession in a romantic context.

From the beginning, Ryumin had spent decades, repeating regressions with the sole purpose of survival.

There was hardly any room for him to date romantically.

'I don't have romantic feelings, and more importantly, conquering Round 20 is more important.'

As Ryumin remained silent for a while, Minjuri, with a flushed face, spoke.

"W-were you surprised? I'm sorry for suddenly confessing. But to explain why I cried, I had no choice but to reveal my feelings."

"You cried because you like me."

"Uh... yeah."

"I understand."

He nodded as if to acknowledge, but Minjuri was embarrassed.

"Is that... all?"

"..."

"No more to say?"

"Should I order some coffee? What would you like to eat?"

"..."

Though he didn't directly say it, he had already answered the confession.

'Pretending not to hear, acting like nothing happened, and indirectly avoiding rejection might be the best for Minjuri.'

But Ryumin was unaware of his own words.

"Why are you pretending not to hear?"

Minjuri wasn't willing to just let things slide.

She wanted a clear answer.

"You heard what I said."

"Oh, that, um..."

"I like you. Since we became classmates."

"..."

"What about me?"

"Before answering... I have a question."

Ryumin asked, intending to avoid answering as much as possible.

"Why do you like someone like me?"

"What's wrong with you!"

Minjuri snapped as if talking about her own matters.

Perhaps she was conscious of people around, her voice then lowered again.

"Why are you pretending not to know?"

Minjuri had no intention of glossing over the situation.

She wanted a definite answer.

"You heard what I said."

"Oh, that, um..."

While this round marked Minjuri's first confession, Ryumin was already aware of it.

He knew what she liked about him.

'Even in a wounded state, my dedication to work may have seemed fresh and attractive to her. But...'

At that time, Ryumin had no choice but to work through the pain.

Survival demanded it, just like it does now.

'I appreciate that she could see something positive in that. But could it be a premature misconception to call it love?'

Above all, he had changed.

The pure Ryumin from that time was no longer present.

He was now a monster aiming to conquer rounds by slaughtering thousands of players, monsters, and angels.

'So, it's not possible between you and me.'

Looking at Minjuri, who was waiting for an answer in silence, Ryumin softly spoke.

"I'm sorry."

"..."

"It's so sudden that I find myself bewildered."

"How do you feel about it...?"

"I... "

As Ryumin hesitated, Minjuri's lips became dry.
