Title: Episode 156 of the 100th Reincarnation for a Max Level Player

Trust

Yamtti involuntarily opened her mouth.

The statement about killing angels was shocking.

It was something she had never imagined.

"Why... why would you kill angels?"

"Why? Don't you want to kill them?"

"No, I know angels can be bad, but..."

"What benefit is there in killing them?"

"Well..."

Ryumin smirked.

"There is such a thing."

If it's about benefits, he had already received them in the first round.

He killed an angel for the first time and received titles and runes.

The fact that he could become a reaper in the first place was because he killed an angel.

After that, he didn't kill angels not because of fear of death but simply because there was no profit in it.

"Only for ordinary angels, of course."

Ordinary angels no longer gave any rewards even if killed.

But battle angels were a different story.

The angel Ryumin wanted to pull out was a battle angel.

"Just stay by my side and do as I say when I order you to dominate. Got it?"

"Yes, master."

"Hurry. Before Minjuri's buff expires."

The reason for wanting to kill before the buff expires was that there was a reward proportionate to the stats when killing a battle angel for the first time.

Yamtti followed closely behind as Ryumin took the lead.

They soon arrived at the largest temple of Rubahhi in the Holy Empire.

It was said to be the place where the god Rubahhi was worshiped, but Ryumin had no interest in such settings.

Regardless of whether it was real or fake, Ryumin's only interest was in summoning angels.

Before opening the temple door, a holy knight standing in front of the door blocked their way.

"It's our first time seeing you. What brings you here?"

If they were to say, "We came for a sub-quest," the NPCs would likely tilt their heads.

To these people, players were warriors from another dimension, and terms like system or quests were unfamiliar.

"We've come to find peace of mind."

"Is that so?"

The knight stepped aside, clearing the way.

It meant they could enter.

"May you find the path you seek at the sanctuary of Rubahhi."

"Thank you."
ChatGPT

The knight, unaware of what Ryumin might do, stared directly ahead after letting them pass.

Yamtti followed Ryumin quietly, much like a puppy.

Before entering the chapel, a priest approached the two.

"Welcome, brethren. Is it your first time here?"

"Yes."

"Then you should register at the temple first."

"No, we just stopped by for a moment."

"In that case, perhaps you'd like to attend the service..."

"It's okay. By the way, I want to make a donation."

"Donation?"

Ryumin looked at the priest and abruptly used the trading function.

As he did, a trade window appeared.

[Freely imagine items or gold to offer to the other party.]

└ Items to trade: None

└ Gold to trade: 1,000,000G

☞ Trade ☜

└ Items to trade: None

└ Gold to trade: 0 G

☞ Trade ☜

[After placing the items, press the 'Trade' button.] [Both parties must agree for the trade to be successful.]

"I thought this function was only effective with players..."

He realized he could also use the trading function with NPCs.

Initially, Ryumin had doubts about whether NPCs would accept it, but he found out after trying.

Ryumin looked at the gold and mentally set it at 1 million.

Then, 1 million gold was automatically entered, and he immediately pressed the trade button.

As if it was not a big deal at all.

[The trade has been successful.] [You have given 1,000,000 gold to Priest Valus.]

Looking at the status window, his gold holdings, which were 1.7 million, had decreased to 700,000.

He had transferred 1 million gold.

The priest's eyes widened at the unexpected amount.

"You, you're offering this much money as a donation?"

"Yes."

The surprised priest was taken aback for a moment, but only for a moment.

Even though she pretended otherwise, the corners of her mouth twitched.

You could tell from the greedy glint in her eyes how worldly her thoughts were.

Not willing to be completely taken advantage of, Ryumin, trying to maintain some dignity, spoke insincerely.

"1 million gold... I cannot accept such a large donation."

"I've already given it; you don't have to accept it."

Suppressing a chuckle, Ryumin put on a charitable smile, resembling a philanthropist.
ChatGPT

"If you want to make a donation to the great Lord Rubahhi, you should offer at least this much. And to me, it's not that much money. You don't have to worry about it."

"You seem to be quite wealthy. Hahaha."

The priest, perhaps having decided not to return the money, chuckled for a while.

Of course, Ryumin had a reason for offering such a large sum.

"As of now, the easiest sub-quest to complete is [Make a Donation]."

Sure enough, the awaited message appeared in front of him.

└ Condition ▶ Make a donation of 1 million gold or more to the temple.

[You have completed the sub-quest!] [The human's reputation for the Black Scythe has risen from 'Neutral' to 'Friendly.']

In the fantasy world, there are numerous sub-quests, with this Holy Empire alone having around 30.

"I've explored and strategized each sub-quest one by one, taking advantage of the fact that I can regress dozens of times."

Among the results was establishing the optimal quest and route that could be conquered most quickly, and one of them was this.

"If you have enough money, the quest you can complete in just one second is the donation quest."

However, at this point, the hefty sum of 1 million gold was not something anyone could easily come by, making it an impossible quest for other players.

The quick rise in reputation was also due to this.

"Thank you so much for your generous donation. May the grace of Rubahhi always be with you. Hahaha!"

"Thank you. But I don't like empty words. I don't just want to say it; I want to receive the grace of the Lord directly."

"Directly?"

Ryumin spoke in a subtle voice.

"I'm talking about Trust."

"...."

"I heard that at the Rubahhi Temple, you can communicate with the god through Trust. It would be an unparalleled honor if the god were to directly bestow grace."

Receiving Trust in the temple was a well-known fact.

However, no one ever demanded it.

It was granted only to the highest leader of the Holy Empire, Emperor Seonghwang.

Perhaps that's why an awkward smile appeared on the priest's face.

"If you don't know, Trust can only be received by Emperor Seonghwang. Those with insufficient faith cannot receive it."

"Even after making a 1 million gold donation?"
ChatGPT

"Even so, what's impossible is impossible. An outsider, whose origin is unknown, wanting to make contact with a god? If Seonghwang hears about this, there will be anger."

"Then return the gold I gave you."

Ryumin nonchalantly extended his hand, as if he were taking back what he had given.

But the priest was not easily swayed.

"It's a principle not to return received donations."

"I'm asking you to make an exception."

"If you have a complaint, talk to the temple knights outside. We'll kindly guide you to the prison."

Faced with the threat to stop the coercion, Ryumin gave up.

"Well, can't help it."

Persuasion through words reached its limit.

"Yamtti, dominate."

Having dominated the priest, Ryumin could easily enter.

Of course, he also received the 1 million gold back.

Click

Pressing the hidden button on the bookshelf, a secret passage appeared with a soft rumble.

"From here on, it's dark, so please be careful."

The priest, speaking emotionlessly, led the way.

Despite instructing only to guide to the altar, she was surprisingly kind.

"Here we are."

The place they arrived at, after passing through the secret underground passage, was a dimly lit chamber.

Considering it was a place where Trust was bestowed, the subtle light created quite an atmospheric setting.

Well, if there were no light, it might as well have been a place where a dark sorcerer offered sacrifices.

"Please wait here for a moment. I will bring Emperor Seonghwang."

"Hurry up. Just tell him that the representative of Kronos said to come alone."

The priest ignored Ryumin's command, only glancing at it.

Her master was only Yamtti.

"Do as he says! Hurry!"

"Understood."

Only after Yamtti spoke did the priest finally leave the chamber.

"Yamtti."

"Yes, master."

"Make sure you're properly equipped. There might be a dangerous situation, so be careful."

"Oh, are you worrying about me? How sweet..."

"I'm worried about losing the Enchanting Rune, not you."

"Ugh."

Ignoring Yamtti, who pouted like a duck, Ryumin equipped himself.

Legendary weapons, God-class armor, God-class helmet, and so on.

He armed himself with items that maximized his stats.
ChatGPT

That way, the rewards when capturing a Battle Angel could be maximized.

At that moment.

Soft footsteps echoed in the darkness.

By the sound of footsteps and the sense of presence, it seemed that two people were approaching.

One was the priest who went to fetch Ryumin earlier, and the other was Seonghwang, who could be considered the emperor of the Holy Empire.

"Is it true that the representative of the god is waiting here?"

"Yes, that's him over there."

As the priest pointed at Ryumin, Seonghwang looked at him with eyes like an old tiger.

"That person is the representative of Kronos? Are you joking with me? I don't feel any divine power from him, not even as much as a truck."

"Oh. Can't you feel it?"

Ryumin smirked and revealed the hidden title he had kept.

[Last Time Reverser], which could be considered hostile in terms of human reputation.

The moment he made the title 'public,' Seonghwang's eyes widened significantly.

"Well? Can you feel it now?"

"Y-yes! How dare you enter here! Impersonating the representative of a god and having the audacity to come in after killing the archbishop!"

Seonghwang, who had restrained his anger at once, emitted divine power from his entire body.

Ordinary people might have been overwhelmed by this aura, but Ryumin just chuckled.

NPCs were NPCs, no matter how powerful they seemed. They couldn't compare to Battle Angels.

'But still, the effect of reputation is significant. He immediately tried to kill me, thinking I'm a public enemy.'

He narrowed the distance in an instant and delivered a punch to Seonghwang's abdomen.

Bam!

"Ugh!"

Seonghwang's divine power, which seemed ready to explode, instantly diminished.

'Not against me.'

Ryumin quickly grabbed the back of Seonghwang's head and slammed it into the ground.

A dull impact transmitted through Seonghwang's skull.

Maintaining the pressure, Ryumin prevented the divine power from seeping out like a faucet locked in place.

"With that level of skill, you're trying to challenge someone at level 89."

"Ugh!"

While Seonghwang was strong, he was still an NPC.

For a player, he would be around level 60.

Even if he was strong for an NPC, to Ryumin, he was nothing compared to other players.

"Yamtti. Dominate this guy too."

"Yes, master."
ChatGPT

After dominating the priest, Ryumin proceeded to dominate Seonghwang as well.

Once the domination was complete, Ryumin released his grip on the back of Seonghwang's head.

"Just follow my orders."

When Seonghwang looked at Yamtti, Yamtti glanced at Ryumin.

"Master, what command would you like to give?"

"Send the priest away and tell Seonghwang that he wants to receive Trust."

"Understood."

Trust. It meant the act of the god imparting their will to the world through humans. In other words, a communication channel between god and humans.

This was something only the emperor of the Holy Empire could do.

'But in reality, it's not communicating with a god but rather conversing with an angel.'

Ryumin raised his eyes and looked at Seonghwang.

Seonghwang emitted divine power in front of the large altar.

The procedure for summoning an angel.

'Soon, the angel will respond to the call.'

The angel appearing here was an ordinary angel, not a Battle Angel, so there was no need to be nervous.

Of course, ordinary players might still be afraid due to the Trial of Death, but Ryumin had no reason to fear.

'Threatening an ordinary angel to summon a Battle Angel.'

While Ryumin was planning this simple scheme, a light flashed before him.

Fluttering its wings, a being with a beautiful figure, an angel, turned its gaze towards the bowing Seonghwang.

[Why have you summoned me, old human?]

"Uh, well..."

"The one with business here is not him."

Interrupting the conversation, Ryumin stepped in, catching the angel's attention.

[Who are you? Are you a player?]

"Do players appear as players in the eyes of angels?"

The gentle forehead of the angel crumpled without mercy.

[You are an arrogant pest. Seems like you want your head to explode and die.]

There was a threatening gaze in its eyes as if it could kill Ryumin instantly.

With a scoff, Ryumin uttered a sentence.

"Why don't you try killing me once, Angel?"
