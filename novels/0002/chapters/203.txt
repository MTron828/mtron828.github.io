Title: Episode 203 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Sariel

'You said to bring me? Who?'

Ryumin carefully observed Sariel, who had a dark corner despite being an angel.

It seemed like an order had come from above for him to be brought.

Information needed to be extracted.

Of course, there was no need for unproductive labor like torture.

As long as there was a rune in the subconscious, it was easy to find out.

When Ryumin quietly observed Sariel, his thoughts were readable.

'Michael, the top angel, had given the command.'

He had heard the name Michael back in the 68th round.

Having met him in person, he knew how powerful Michael was.

'Sure enough, Michael is the leader of the archangels.'

No wonder he felt a different strength compared to other angels.

'If it's an order from the leader of the archangels, it makes sense.'

The obtained information was not the only thing.

The point that he was to be brought without a single scratch.

The fact that a high-ranking archangel named Raguel was trying to kill him.

The fact that the archangels intended to use him as an example for the order of Heaven, and so on.

All the necessary information had been obtained.

[Seeing no response, is he mute? I didn't hear the information that Black Scythe is mute?]

Sariel muttered something, seemingly indifferent, while sharpening his scythe.

[Even if he can't speak, he's not deaf. I'll say it again, resist....]

"Jephy."

Ignoring the angel's words, Ryumin called Jeffrey behind him.

"Take the party members and withdraw as far as possible. It's about to become a battlefield."

"Yes, Lord Black Scythe."

Seeing Jeffrey going to gather the frozen comrades, Ryumin turned his head forward again.

Sariel's expression was ironic.

Even though he looked like a devil rather than an angel, he was as twisted as one could believe.

[I thought you were mute, but it seems you have a tongue.]

"Do you have fingers to point at me?"

When he raised his middle finger, the angel's eyebrows twitched.

[Boasting about gaining a bit of Jytole's power. In the subject of being a mere human....]

Sariel, who had been talking, suddenly showed a surprised expression.

It seemed he had noticed the demon pendant hanging around Ryumin's neck.

In an instant, a dagger-like aura pierced through Ryumin's entire body.

"That pendant... Where did you get it?"

"What does it matter to you?"

"Do you know what that item is?"

"The quiet ones surprisingly have a lot to say."

Ryumin's entire body was engulfed in a mysterious dark aura.

He activated the buffs he had prepared after casting the Reapers' Transformation.

"[Blessing of the Demon applied.] [Based on the current total stats (109,967), the following effects will be applied:] [Upon killing an angel, gain gold equal to 1x the baseline (109,967). Increases up to a maximum of 1,000x (109,967,000) based on the angel's level.] [Upon killing an angel, gain stat points equal to 0.01% of the baseline (11). Increases up to a maximum of 10% (10,996) based on the angel's level.] [Upon killing an angel, reputation of the demon faction slightly increases.] [The buff will last until the end of the current round.]"

Seeing the numerical values in the message, Ryumin was astonished as he looked at the status window, realizing that his stats had increased unbelievably.

-Strength: 25,274, Intelligence: 27,325

-Agility: 27,532, Luck: 29,836

Not only did he receive a buff from the enhanced Minjuri, but also a buff zone was set on the ground.

In addition, there were runes of balance, massacre, the first angel slayer, and the Reapers' Transformation.

Examining each one, he understood why his stats had become like this.

"Moreover, last time I defeated Ramiel and received a generous stat reward."

Ryumin had become significantly stronger compared to when facing Ramiel.

However, he couldn't afford to be complacent.

"Just because I'm ranked 6th doesn't mean I should take it lightly."

For now, he needed to gauge the guy's skill since he didn't know it.

"After that, I'll mercilessly kill him."

The crimson auras of human and angelic essence collided in the air.

"He won't go down easily, will he?"

Sariel smirked, watching the arrogant human who seemed to know nothing.

"I never thought he would just surrender willingly."
ChatGPT

The guy who killed a high-ranking angel is threatening me?

"I need to make him realize the difference in power."

Since the order was to bring him without a scratch, there was no intention to use lethal force right away. Some consideration would be given.

Until he saw the demon pendant.

"How dare he wear that necklace in front of me...!"

Even now, angels were engaged in a long war against demons, including existing high-ranking angels like himself. Therefore, he couldn't ignore the necklace that demons proudly carried around, which was nothing less than a symbol of disgrace to the angels.

"So, this arrogant human is flaunting that necklace as if it means nothing to our angels!"

For this reason, an indescribable rage filled his entire being.

"Arrogant human. I'll make you suffer to the point where you'll want to die."

He tried to handle the situation as calmly as possible without harboring negative emotions, but seeing that pendant changed everything.

Cutting off both arms and taking him away wouldn't be a problem.

"But it's quite eerie. That appearance."

With his entire body shrouded in darkness and holding a scythe, he looked like the very embodiment of the god of death.

"But in the end, he's just a human. No matter how much he imitates a god, a bug is still a bug."

Sariel also understood.

The power he, as the so-called Angel of Death, possessed was incomparable to that of this guy.

The darkness possessed by the class of Death would never overcome his own darkness.

Therefore, Sariel could suppress his excitement and maintain composure.

"Come. Human. I'll show mercy and let you take the first move."

Without waiting for acknowledgment, Black Scythe rushed forward and swung the scythe.

He was surprised by the quite fast movement, but that was all.

"Considering the scythe's movement, is he aiming for my waist with a horizontal slash? How predictable."

Due to the characteristics of the hooked weapon, it was difficult to dodge if he aimed for the waist. The only options were to jump or block, but Sariel had no intention of following his expectations.

"Take the hit. Move forward."

Instead of dodging backward, he moved forward, avoiding the horizontal slash aimed at his waist and simultaneously getting closer to the opponent's heart.

If he could pierce the chest with the scythe as it was aimed, Black Scythe would meet an instant death.

"But it won't end that easily."

He swiftly raised the scythe that was aiming for his chest, countering by slashing off the opponent's arm like a lightning bolt.
ChatGPT

Thud-!

Having seen that, a scream was heard from over the opponent's shoulder.

"Lord Black Scythe!"

The insect-like humans were staring as if enjoying the spectacle.

"Pathetic. To be so confident with such skills..."

In an instant, Sariel felt a sense of danger.

Although there wasn't a critical situation where one of the opponent's arms was cut off, he felt it distinctly.

Instinctively, he turned his body at the chilling sensation from behind.

However, whether his reaction was slow or not, five wings were cut off, splattering golden blood.

"Ugh!"

"Keen senses. I was planning to cut them all."

There was no response.

He was too surprised by the sudden surprise attack of Black Scythe.

"Even the Archangel couldn't see through the illusion."

"Illusion?"

Hastily turning his gaze, the Black Scythe, whose arm had been severed, had suddenly disappeared.

In front of him, only an intact Black Scythe remained.

"I saw through your skill to some extent. Is this the level of the 6th rank?"

"What?"

Sariel visibly looked surprised.

He hadn't uttered the word "6th rank," but the guy seemed to know who he was.

"How...?"

Clang-!

Without a chance to inquire, an attack came, and Sariel blocked it with his scythe.

Clang- Clang-!

"What, what is this power?"

It was strange.

From the beginning until now, he had consistently drawn upon the power of darkness.

Similar to how humans used mana as the source of their power, Sariel, as the Angel of Death, also derived power from darkness.

"But why? Why am I being overwhelmed in power?"

Originally, higher-tier darkness had a nature of resistance against the impact of lower-tier darkness.

Even if the guy's stats were high, there should be no worry about being overwhelmed. So why was the opposite happening?

Clang- Ting- Clang-

He continuously clashed blades, but the question remained unanswered.

Rather than alleviating, Sariel became increasingly bewildered by the growing strength and speed.

Suddenly, cold sweat formed on his forehead, and he struggled to defend against the attacks.

"As expected. Power and speed are just at this level."

"What are you saying? Ugh!"

Suddenly, he felt pain from his wings and turned his head, finding all his wings had fallen off.

"When did this happen?"
ChatGPT

At a speed so fast that it seemed as if he hadn't seen the attack, the opponent's movements exceeded imagination.

"Dangerous. This is dangerous."

Feeling the imminent danger, Sariel had to use the ability he had saved for last.

Kiiiiiiiiiiin-

The scythe vibrated and produced a eerie wailing sound.

It was a technique that he had forbidden himself from using, [Wail of the Soul], fearing it might look demonic.

"Ah, ahh..."

"Aahhh..."

Onlookers from afar recoiled in fear.

The range of the Wail of the Soul was extensive.

"It's over."

All living beings could hear the sound.

Not being deaf, Black Scythe couldn't avoid hearing the sound.

"The Wail of the Soul paralyzes the limbs of the hearing entity and evokes a sense of terror. Except for the caster, no one is exempt."

The moment it was cast, it was like pronouncing a death sentence.

There was nothing as easy as slashing an immobile opponent.

"The game ends here. Take both pairs of arms."

Observing the motionless Black Scythe, Sariel casually walked forward.

Naturally, he thought the opponent would be affected by fear, but it was just a misconception.

"A game? Were you playing around all this time?"

[...!]

Seeing the completely unaffected opponent, Sariel's steps came to a sudden halt.

"Was I the one playing around thinking I'd assess your skill?"

Why wasn't the Wail of the Soul affecting him?

There was no time to think.

The overwhelming thought was that he needed to escape.

Keiiiiiiiiing-

The opponent suddenly pulled the scythe back, took a defensive posture, and prepared something.

"I, I need to avoid that."

Instinctively, Sariel, who was about to take flight, flinched as if restrained.

"Oh, my wings!"

Without wings, avoiding in mid-air was impossible.

How should he avoid it? But when he thought about it, it was already too late.

The flash approached at close range.

Qua-Qua-Qua-Qua-Crash!

In an instant, the cave was reduced to rubble by the Moonlight Slash.

"W-What's going on?"

John, who had been told to stay back with his party members, was bewildered by the sudden appearance of the angel.

"He came to give us a reward, but now he's suddenly pointing a sword at Black Scythe?"
ChatGPT

Indeed, it was hard to interpret the appearance of the angel as a mere guide, with the majestic wings and the chilly atmosphere.

Moreover, it was the first time seeing an angel wielding a weapon.

"Why would they suddenly want to fight Black Scythe?"

Seeing them suddenly appear and deciding whether to kill or spare, it was clear that there was a not-so-good reason behind it.

After that, there was no time for Sariel to listen to the conversation as he dodged with his party members.

"Is Black Scythe alright? The atmosphere doesn't seem good..."

"He'll be fine. Do you think Black Scythe would be in trouble even against an angel?"

"Angels can easily decapitate if they set their minds to it."

"Oh, reconsidering, it does seem dangerous."

Democratic and Jeffrey, who were worried, had different thoughts from John.

"Welcome, angel. Please kill Black Scythe. Please. Fighting!"

In fact, John wished for the angel to kill Black Scythe while cheering him on.

And that wish seemed to come true, as the angel began by severing the arms.

"Nice! An angel... wait..."

He inwardly celebrated, but it was short-lived.

Upon seeing the intact Black Scythe, John had to doubt his own eyes.

"What happened? Two Black Scythes?"

After realizing it was an illusion, the situation took a turn in the opposite direction.

The angel, whose wings were cut off, engaged in a fierce battle with Black Scythe, exchanging multiple blows.

However, it was evident that the angel was falling behind.

Suddenly, the angel found itself in a situation where it was losing its wings.

"It's over."

In the moment of despair, an odd sound was heard.

"Ah, ahh..."

"Aahhh..."

Not only himself but his party members as well, everyone's bodies were paralyzed, and they trembled in fear.

But only for a moment.

Crash!

With an explosion that felt like the cave was collapsing, the abnormal state was lifted.

When the thick dust settled, all that remained was the torn cave wall and the angel, separated into upper and lower halves.

"It's over..."

John's face was filled with disappointment.

Even if it's an angel, if the waist is cut off, there's no chance of survival, right?

"Huh? Wait a minute."

At that moment, a fleeting idea flashed through John's mind.

"Could it be... possible?"
ChatGPT

"If I can summon that angel as my familiar...?"

Wouldn't that be a means to oppose Black Scythe?

It was a mind-blowing idea, but John didn't know that Rumin happened to be reading his thoughts.
