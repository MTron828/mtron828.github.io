Title: "Episode 250 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

Shield Bearer

'Why are you embarrassed?'

Whether Christine was embarrassed or not, Ryu Min focused only on protecting her.

If she were to fall, thousands of others would fall with her.

'Maybe we won't last a few minutes into this round.'

In this round, healers were crucial.

Some other players seemed to realize this fact, as a few expressed their gratitude to Christine.

Not only gestures of gratitude, but some even spoke directly.

"Are you the one healing right now?"

"Thank you, Lady Chris."

"Are you a healer? Your healing power is incredible!"

There was no time to answer.

If concentration was lost or interrupted by one's own will, the life recovery skill would be interrupted. To cast it again after interruption, a cooldown of 30 minutes was required.

'So, Christine's role is crucial.'

With a determination to protect her at all costs, Ryu Min cast healing on her back.

"Um, Mr. Black Scythe?"

"Why?"

"Could you please remove your hand from my back...?"

"Healing is much faster when applied directly to the area close to the wound. Didn't you know?"

"Oh...?"

Even Christine, a healer herself, widened her eyes in surprise.

"Thanks for the tip."

"So, don't waste your time on useless things and quietly focus on your mind and concentration."

"Yes..."

She replied, but Christine still felt embarrassed.

Tapapatapatapa!

"Ugh!"

"Argh!"

After about 15 minutes, groans could be heard from various places.

The intensity of suffering became noticeably higher.

But upon receiving the life recovery, a calm expression returned, as if to say, "When did this happen?"

If it weren't for Christine's healing, they wouldn't have been able to endure this section and would have fainted.

Christine, who received Ryu Min's healing, was the same.

'The pain... it's like it disappeared as if washed away.'

Surprised, Christine asked Ryu Min next to her.

"Mr. Black Scythe, are you using emergency treatment skills right now? Why is the effect so good?"

"It's not emergency treatment; it's healing."

"Huh? Healing?"

'Thanks to the brilliant rune, it's not your ordinary healing.'
ChatGPT

Healing is a Holy-type skill.

The Radiant Rune enhances the effectiveness of Holy-type skills by nearly double, so the recovery power is overwhelming.

'Moreover, since Christine uses healing at the precise moment when she takes damage, there's hardly any time to feel the pain.'

It was a method to minimize pain in its own way.

Other players had to endure pain and recovery without such a method.

"Heh, it's much more painful than I thought."

"But still, with the healing, it's bearable."

"Thanks to the healer Chris, this mission will be easily conquered."

"Let's endure for just another 15 minutes!"

They shouted words of encouragement from various places.

Voices expressing confidence in being able to break through could be heard.

There was definitely progress.

If Christine's healing continued like this, they could offset the suffering.

However, Ryu Min's expression was not so optimistic.

Going backward would result in an absurd increase in damage.

'Regardless of healing through dot recovery, it's useless. Especially with stronger incoming damage.'

From the point where there were 3 minutes left, damage significant enough to render recovery useless came in every 2 seconds.

At this point, people couldn't afford to be as relaxed as they were now, even if they received recovery.

'This round was designed under the assumption of receiving recovery in the first place. That's why enduring the pain is essential.'

Especially the last 10 seconds brought in damage that was unbearable.

Even if they received healing, the majority would face damage leading to inevitable death.

'Without wearing high-defense gear like me or consuming multiple potions, it's impossible to endure.'

Currently wearing Thanatos's Black Armor, Ryu Min had an 88% chance of dodging projectiles.

Originally 67%, but with the 5-set effect and Russell's equipment refinement buff, the option increased by 1.32 times.

'Most projectiles are missing me, so I'm hardly taking any damage, but...'

Others would gradually experience hell.

Even Ryu Min, who cleared the first 15 rounds, almost lost his composure at that time.

It felt more like being stabbed with a knife than pierced with a needle.

'No one else will be able to endure the last 10 seconds. Unless I intervene.'
ChatGPT

Ryu Min recalled an item in his inventory.

The Potion of Rapid Regeneration he received in the 8th round.

'It doesn't matter if I'm alone, but to save others, I need this potion.'

For the 20th round, he had to save as many people as possible.

It would come with immense pain, but he could endure this level of sacrifice.

[Time remaining until round end: 00:09:58]

Already 20 minutes had passed.

It was only 10 more minutes to endure, but screams echoed as if it was becoming harder.

Tapapatapatapa!

"Aaah!"

"Ah, it hurts!"

Pain, like a piercing needle, was felt and then disappeared.

Normally, it was unbearable damage, but with recovery every second, they could withstand it to some extent.

Of course, those with weak mental strength were already on the verge of losing their sanity.

"Ugh..."

"Hold on, Chris. No matter what happens, you can't lose consciousness."

"Yes..."

Though Christine gritted her teeth and endured, not everyone had mental strength as good as hers.

"Aaah!"

As a man skillfully dodged behind another person, the person in front had to take two bullets instead.

"Hey! What are you doing? Aaah! Move to the side quickly! Ugh!"

"I'm sorry. I need a moment to rest because it hurts too much."

"Get back to your position quickly! Aaah!"

It was natural to take one hit and two hits, but there was a significant difference in damage.

However, as if unconcerned about such matters, the man stepped aside, using another person as a shield to protect himself.

'Hehe, this isn't painful at all, it's like a piece of cake. I should've done this earlier...'

The man's thoughts were abruptly cut off.

A winged ghost appeared in front of him and snapped his neck.

Snap-

Without leaving any last words, the man became a corpse, collapsing to the ground.

At that moment, the bullets that were heading toward him disappeared.

The person who had been shielding him looked visibly relieved.

Observing this, Ryu Min smirked.

'Well done, John Delgado.'

Ryu Min had given clear instructions to John Delgado in advance.

If someone tries to leave, don't hesitate to kill them by snapping their necks.
ChatGPT

'I won't let others live just to shield myself in this situation? Such trash is not worth living.'

It's better to kill such a person early on.

They only cause hindrance and chaos.

"Hey! Come back!"

"I'm getting hit twice because of you!"

"What are you doing behind me...!"

Swish-!

Swack-!

Swack-!

When another person tried to leave, Sarriel approached and swung his sickle.

Overwhelmed by the appearance of the Angel of Death, people watched nervously, but Sarriel silently turned away.

As if he wouldn't touch those who chose not to leave.

When there were about a hundred bodies in the common area.

People no longer left their positions.

They didn't hide behind others.

Unless they were fools, they couldn't help but notice.

The moment they leave, the angel with the sickle will cut their throats.

'It seems to be effective.'

As Sarriel roamed like a supervisor, people gritted their teeth and endured.

No more escapees appeared.

[00:05:08]

Tick-

[00:04:32]

Tick-

[00:03:28]

Tick-

They endured without any more escapes until the point where there were 3 minutes left, but now it would be difficult.

Now the agony of death would begin.

"Listen, everyone!"

Ryu Min shouted towards the crowd.

Although only the person next to him was visible, people listened attentively to the Black Scythe's voice.

"If you want to live, line up behind me! Stand in a straight line!"

"In a straight line?"

"As you know, I know the strategy for this mission. If you want to live, cooperate!"

While people were still bewildered, Ryu Min raised his voice.

"What are you doing? Move right now!"

There was no need for a question as to why.

It was none other than the voice of the Black Scythe.

There was no reason not to listen.

Whoosh-

People lined up in an orderly fashion.

Using the Black Scythe as a shield, but Sarriel did not move.

As if he would not interfere.

'Undead spirits are immune to physical damage, but that doesn't mean they can block bullets.'

Therefore, Sarriel's role was limited to this point.

Now, Ryu Min had to physically shield others.

Tapapatapatapa-!
ChatGPT

As people lined up, bullets were directed toward a single point.

Towards Ryu Min at the front.

Ting ting ting ting ting!

But, with an 88% probability, most of the bullets veered away.

Puk puk puk puk puk!

Utilizing a barrier with the Dark Rune, he also blocked hundreds of bullets.

Ryu Min glanced at the countdown timer on the progress window.

[Time remaining until round end: 00:00:28]

There was only 30 seconds left.

Turning his head, he noticed that they hadn't formed a single line yet.

It took more time than expected for a thousand people to form a line.

"Kristin!"

"Yes?"

"We're running out of time. Quickly, come behind me."

"But what about the life recovery...?"

"Not needed. Just hide your body quickly!"

When the person behind gave way, Kristin slipped in.

Along with her, the life recovery that had been healing people was interrupted.

Puk- puk- puk!

Out of hundreds of bullets, dozens pierced into Ryu Min's body.

It was painful, but without changing his expression, he used healing to mend the wounds.

'I need to take the potion at the exact right time. That's the only way I won't die.'

Behind him, Kristin also placed her hands on his back, using healing.

Wishing for the Black Scythe not to die.

'Please, stay strong.'

Finally, all players successfully lined up.

When a thousand people were in a straight line, all attacks were concentrated on Ryu Min.

Tapapatapatapa-!

Even though he expanded the barrier of darkness, it quickly crumbled.

Titi ting ting ting ting!

The Black Armor deflected most of the bullets, but about a hundred bullets still hit Ryu Min directly.

'Ugh, it's not... It's not the right time yet.'

17 seconds, 16 seconds, 15 seconds...

Just a bit more, just a bit more.

He had to take the potion at exactly 10 seconds remaining.

Even a second later, he would die on the spot.

'At the 10-second mark, the damage significantly increases.'

People still didn't understand why the Black Scythe had taken on the role of a shield.

They simply followed the instructions, trusting and moving.

But when the last 10 seconds arrived, a thousand people finally realized.

Why the Black Scythe was shielding for them.

Tuwaquaquaquaquaquaqwang-!

Just hearing the explosion of the strengthened bullets was chilling.
ChatGPT

If he had taken that, he wouldn't have survived.

Everyone thought that way and worried.

The Black Scythe, who had to take the hit, would he come out unscathed?

Would there be no trace left?

Fortunately, the worries didn't come true.

He precisely used the potion at the timing when the bullets were fired.

["Potion of Rapid Regeneration" is used.] [Regeneration is significantly increased for 10 seconds.]

As the message appeared, the bullets of darkness struck Ryu Min's body.

Flesh tore, organs trembled, but as if nothing happened, the wounds were restored.

The transcendent power of rapid regeneration cleanly healed the injuries.

Twaquaquaquaquaquang!

Even with a hundred bullets embedded, Ryu Min remained unfazed.

Twaquaquaquaquaquang!

Becoming a human shield, he took on the share of others with his entire body.

Summoning the barrier of darkness proved futile.

It quickly shattered like glass, penetrating Ryu Min's body.

But in the end, it couldn't pierce through his body.

Before the rapid regeneration could be breached, it had already restored the damage.

[Remaining time: 8 seconds.] [Remaining time: 7 seconds.]

...

...

The remaining time for rapid regeneration decreased, but it didn't register.

Ten seconds felt like an eternity.

Pakduk-

Gritting his teeth, he endured the pain.

Even in moments when it seemed like he would lose consciousness due to the agony, Ryu Min held onto his sanity.

He endured and withstood the concentrated saturation, both physically and mentally.

Twaquaquaquaquaquang!

His body regenerated, but the pain remained entirely Ryu Min's burden.

Ten seconds felt like ten hours.

He wished for time to pass quickly.

He couldn't endure any longer.

No, he couldn't collapse just yet.

With a shaken heart, he steadied himself and faced the focused onslaught with his body.

And with his mind.

Twaquaquaquaquaquang!

The last bullet tried to pierce through his entire body but failed.

As the wounds healed, a message echoed.

["Potion of Rapid Regeneration has ended."]
