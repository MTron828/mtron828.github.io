Title: Regression of a Level 100 Player - Episode 198

Position

◀ ROUND 12 ▶

└ Overcoming Five Trials in the Cave of Ordeals

[Integrated Zone CA-EA001]

└ Participating Teams: 7,880

└ Achieving Teams: 0/3,940

"Five trials?"

"So, are we supposed to form teams of five each?"

"Ah, I see. It looks like we have to tackle each trial one by one, with one person for each."

The angel chuckled in response to some players' murmurs.

[Now that you've had some time to rest, can you sense the quest just by looking at it? Right. For this round, you need to overcome five trials, forming a team of five to strategize. Of course, the details of the trials are confidential.]

Before the angel could finish speaking, the players began to move.

From the moment they heard it was a team battle, they started thinking about who to form a party with and took immediate action.

They couldn't afford to be leisurely, as they might end up being the unfortunate last two.

"Since survival is at stake, everyone is acting quickly. Good. Such proactive behavior. Now, listen while forming your teams."

The angel continued with the explanation without paying much attention.

[As I mentioned before, you need to form a party of five to start the game. You all know how to form a party since we did it in the 6th round, right? Hold hands with four others and simultaneously memorize the 'Party Formation' activation command. Oh, right, the moment I mentioned it, the first party has been formed.]

As the angel spoke, looking into the empty space, she wondered if the results were coming in real-time.

[Parties can be formed regardless of nationality. Haven't they said that yesterday's enemy could be today's ally? Or is it the other way around? Anyway, I hope you forget about the past rounds and form parties amicably. Oh, by the way, to facilitate smooth communication within the party, we will provide translation functionality.]

As soon as the angel finished speaking, a message popped up.

[Round trait 'Translation' has been activated.] [You can now communicate with species from other realms.] [You can converse with all players without language barriers.]

The translation feature, received every time they entered another realm, was now activated.

Although they could now understand and read each other's languages, people still didn't pay attention to foreigners.

Due to the events of the last round, there was a lingering perception among players from different countries that it was dangerous.

Some people harbored prejudices, akin to racial conflicts.

"Now that communication is possible, feel free to talk and form parties. Don't worry about backstabbing. Naturally, party members cannot harm each other."

Despite the angel's encouragement, players still chose to form parties only with those from their own country.

However, players facing elimination had no choice but to join forces with players from other countries.

"As shown in the quest, only the 3,940 teams that conquer the trials the fastest will survive. Rankings will be announced based on individual performance. Of course, the criteria for ranking calculation are a secret. With that, the explanation is complete, and once all parties are formed, we will start immediately. Who will be the unfortunate duo? Ku-hu-hu-hu."

Ignoring the ominous laughter, Seo Arin looked at her black scythe.

"Black Scythe-nim, have you found party members?"

"Not yet."

"Uh, then, would you consider teaming up with me...?"

Seo Arin, embarrassed, suggested, but Ryu Min showed no particular reaction.

Although she said "not yet," Ryu Min had already decided on the members in her mind.

"Oh? Come to think of it, coincidentally, there are five people gathered here. How about forming a party together?"

Min Juri interjected from the side, but Ryu Min had no intention of teaming up with them.

"Others may not know about the trials, so they are just grabbing anyone for a 5-member party..."

Knowing the strategy, Ryu Min didn't need to do that.

Not just anyone should be recruited.

"I need to form a party with people suitable for each trial. That's the key to this round."

The five trials weren't given for no reason.

Everyone here, including Ryu Min, knew that.

Because it had been explained through the prophecy.

"That's why they're suggesting we form parties like this. It's convenient that there are five of us, and each of us is suitable for tackling a different trial."

However, among them, Ryu Min felt that she only needed Min Juri as her party member.

Others were unnecessary.

She could replace them with more trustworthy individuals.

"After all, I have no intention of forming a party with Ma Kyung-rok or Ahn Sang-chul."
ChatGPT

The Maze Forest, in addition to dealing with the tasks, I also know that he rescued Christine.

As an engaged person, there was no choice but to feel awkward.

It was too late to attach it because the feelings had already faded.

"Black Scythe-nim? How about teaming up with us?"

"Sorry. I plan to party with Democracy."

"Huh? Ah...."

At the declaration, the reactions of Min Juri and Seo Arin, like going between heaven and hell, were opposite.

Min Juri was moved by the Black Scythe, who took care of her, and Seo Arin, although she didn't show it, felt a bit hurt.

"Miss Arin. Let's find different parties."

"...."

Even when Ahn Sang-chul spoke, Seo Arin couldn't bring herself to move.

Meanwhile, someone approached the Black Scythe.

It was Christine.

"Oh, Black Scythe-nim. Here you are...."

Christine, who came to find the Black Scythe for the party, was momentarily surprised when she saw Ma Kyung-rok.

It was because he had the same nickname as her fiancé.

"Heavenly Devil? Are you...?"

"Hello, Chris. Is this the first time you've seen me in this realm?"

Ma Kyung-rok called her by the nickname instead of her real name, thanks to the presence of the Black Scythe.

Christine also didn't make the mistake of calling out her real name in front of others.

"I didn't expect to see you here, Heavenly Devil."

"Me neither."

Even though they didn't use English, the conversation went smoothly, perhaps due to the translation feature.

"Did you come to find the Black Scythe?"

"Yes... There was no one around to form a party with. Please don't misunderstand."

Christine, who was explaining herself, felt stung for no reason, even though no one asked.

"No misunderstanding. It's natural to want to form a party with someone who saved you. I feel the same way, but, well, the problem is that the Black Scythe doesn't seem to accept us."

"Huh?"

Christine looked at Ryu Min.

In her eyes was a question about whether Ryu Min would include her in the party.

"I have decided to form a party with Democracy here. I don't have plans to team up with anyone else yet."

With unexpected words, Christine's expression turned similar to Seo Arin's.

Like someone who confessed and was rejected, her face quickly became sullen.

At that moment, another person appeared.

"Black Scythe-nim!"

It was a Yantti who claimed to be an acquaintance of the Black Scythe in reality.
ChatGPT

Beside her was a familiar figure, a man with a sturdy build.

None other than Victor Japailelda, the Alchemist from Nigeria.

His appearance and nickname were exactly the same, making it impossible to not recognize him.

'He was brought here as instructed.'

Ryu Min had already given instructions to Yanti.

It was a chance encounter with Victor, and she told Yanti to bring him.

With the face and nickname identical to his real appearance, finding him wouldn't be difficult.

"Mr. Victor? This is Black Scythe."

"Uh, is it really Black Scythe?"

Although she had seen him in reality, Victor had only seen him wearing a mask.

It was natural not to recognize him.

"Nice to meet you, Victor. It's the first time I've seen you in this realm."

"Is, is it Black Scythe? Are you really Black Scythe?"

"Don't you recognize me by my nickname? Hehe."

Whether moved by seeing a savior in another realm or feeling touched, Victor seemed unsure of how to react.

"Nice to meet you. I'm glad to meet you. I really wanted to see you."

Beside Victor, who spoke with a face that could be either crying or smiling, there was someone who looked similar.

Ryu Min, who had already noticed from the nickname, caught on quickly.

"Could it be the person next to you...?"

"Oh, you recognized us by our nicknames? I apologize for the late introduction. This is my younger sister, Sophia."

Sophia also recognized Ryu Min early on, as their nickname and real name were the same.

She didn't expect to come with Victor, but...

"Nice to meet you for the first time, Black Scythe. I heard that you saved our brother from that hell. It's late, but thank you very much. Really..."

"It wasn't anything difficult."

"No, Black Scythe's actions are not something anyone can do. There are many powerful people in the world, but the only one who saved our brother was Black Scythe. It's only right to express our gratitude."

Sophia sincerely thanked Black Scythe.

He was the benefactor among benefactors who had gone through all kinds of hardships after being captured by IS.

"Haha, I found out later that my sister is a fan of Black Scythe. She says she scrapes and collects all the articles related to Black Scythe from Korea."

"Oh, brother! What if I say that!"

"Why be embarrassed? It's the truth."
ChatGPT

Observing Victor and Sophia chatting, Ryu Min chuckled, as if she were looking at herself and Ryu Won.

Meanwhile, other players, though silently observing, could sense what was going on.

To those two, Black Scythe was a benefactor of life.

"Are you looking for a party, Black Scythe? How about teaming up with us?"

Victor confidently suggested, and onlookers expected that Black Scythe would accept.

However, Ryu Min shook her head again.

"I will form a party with someone else."

"Is that so? It's unfortunate, but it can't be helped."

Victor and Sophia showed disappointment but turned away without expressing it verbally.

Yet, Ryu Min's words were not over.

"Instead, how about teaming up with Yanti, Victor?"

"Huh? With Yanti?"

Yanti, who had received help along with Black Scythe, was surprised. It wasn't uncomfortable since they were acquaintances, but it was still puzzling.

Of course, Ryu Min didn't suggest Yanti without any thought.

'For Victor to easily clear this round, Yanti will be needed.'

Whether Victor had doubts or not, Ryu Min's proposal wouldn't result in any loss for him.

"If it's Yanti, then I welcome it. How about you, Yanti?"

"I'm fine with it too!"

Although Yanti hesitated for a moment, she joined Victor without saying a word.

She couldn't disobey her master's command.

So, Victor, Sophia, and Yanti formed a team and went to find the rest of their party members.

"Well, since Black Scythe is doing it separately, shall we form our own party?"

At Ma Kyung-rok's suggestion, Ahn Sang-chul, Christine, and Seo Arin looked at each other.

They were recalling the prophecy from Ryu Min that they had heard at this moment.

"In Round 12, five people will form a team to tackle five trials. Naturally, not just anyone can form a team of five, and each person should be chosen according to the suitable profession for each trial."

They remembered what Ryu Min had said about the people needed for each trial.

First Trial: Tanker
Second Trial: Melee DPS
Third Trial: Ranged DPS
Fourth Trial: Supporter
Fifth Trial: Summoner
ChatGPT

To conquer each trial, you need individuals in the following positions.

"Ahn Sang-chul is the tank, Ma Kyung-rok is the melee DPS, Christine is the supporter, Seo Arin is the summoner. They are perfectly suited for their respective positions."

Forming a party with positions that do not overlap was optimal for them, and since they all knew this from the prophecy, they couldn't readily part ways.

"Shall the four of us form a party? It works out perfectly."

"Should we?"

At Ma Kyung-rok's suggestion, the four nodded. They couldn't find a better composition than this.

Originally, Seo Arin and Christine wanted Black Scythe instead of Ma Kyung-rok as the melee DPS, but since Black Scythe declined to form a party, they had no choice.

"Now we need a ranged DPS...."

"Who should we put in that position...."

As they quietly discussed, they soon found a suitable person.

"Hello, my lord!"

It was Heo Tae-seok, the leader of the Shinism cult and a dark mage.

Now shamelessly addressing Black Scythe as a god, he had come openly to request a chance to party with him.

"You've captured the concept well. However, there's no need. We've already decided on party members."

"Oh... That's unfortunate."

Though Heo Tae-seok looked dejected, Ma Kyung-rok, who had found new prey, wore a satisfied expression.

"Lord of Nophein, if you don't have a party, join us. We happen to have one spot available."

"Uh, well, would that be alright?"

With a face, there was no reason to refuse, so Heo Tae-seok joined Ma Kyung-rok's team.

Watching this, Ryu Min felt no regret at all.

"In fact, I was hoping they'd team up like that."

Unlike the others, Ryu Min wished for Minju-ri's survival, especially as much as Christine did.

With such a solid party formed according to the strategy, they should be able to safely navigate this round.

"Now let's go find our own team."

"Huh? Oh, yes."

Minju-ri honestly couldn't understand why Black Scythe had rejected the others.

'I'm really grateful that you chose me, but why?'

Despite pondering, the reason remained unknown. But the truth was unexpectedly simple.

'He didn't want Minju-ri to be taken away by Ma Kyung-rok.'
ChatGPT

Ryu Min already knew that Ma Kyung-rok had set his sights on Minju-ri. He didn't want to let her go to the other team, and at the same time, he didn't want to team up with Ma Kyung-rok either. "For the strategy, it's better to choose my people for the team if possible."

After a few steps, Ryu Min encountered the very people he had in mind.

"Jeffrey, you dumb idiots. Both of you are here."

They were none other than Jeffrey and Joo Sung-tak, slaves and perfect allies.

"Have you come, Black Scythe? We've been waiting."

"What about these two...?"

"They are the ones I'll be teaming up with. They don't talk much, and they're kind, so you can rest assured."

After briefly introducing them to Minju-ri, Ryu Min moved on.

There was one spot left, and Ryu Min had already considered who to fill it with.

"Sorcerer. I'll accept him into the team."

To conquer the subquest, he needed the sorcerer, so he had him in mind.
