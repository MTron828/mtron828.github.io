Title: Episode 313 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Donation

"It seems she's shocked as expected."

Ryumin anticipated that Minjuri would be shocked.

After all, it was the rune of the future that revealed her reaction seven seconds later.

"But I had to say it. The evidence was too clear. Besides, it's a situation where you have to speak to obtain the runes of reality."

There are five runes that can be obtained in reality.

Among them, four situations have already been secured.

The one that is also the last rune on the list of 18 essential runes to be obtained is planned to be acquired in reality after the 19th round.

"To obtain that rune, you have to reveal your identity."

That's why Minjuri revealed it, knowing that she would be shocked.

However, the problem was that the shock was bigger than he had thought.

"A Black Scythe...? Ryumin... my friend has a Black Scythe."

Minjuri, who muttered for a while, looked up and met Ryumin's eyes.

A gaze filled with betrayal and humiliation.

Ryumin did not avoid that gaze.

He didn't have the qualification to do so.

"It must have been fun for you all this time. Pretending to be someone else."

"...."

"Are you happy deceiving people and playing with them?"

"Sorry. It couldn't be helped to protect those around me. Please understand."

"Protect? From whom?"

"People who are after the Black Scythe. Now everything is sorted out though."

"Ah, so now you reveal it? Because you're afraid of being exposed in the end after deceiving everyone?"

"...."

Ryumin knows Minjuri's true feelings.

Even though she says those things, she's suffering inside.

Minjuri's words were like a tantrum of a mere child.

Minjuri herself is well aware of that fact.

But she can't stop blaming others.

Otherwise, she can't protect herself from the psychological shock she received.

"Yeah. I can understand that... but why do I feel like I've been betrayed?"

"..."

"I never even dreamed that you were the Black Scythe. I thought you were a completely different person..."

Minjuri, after letting out a long sigh, got up from her seat without even drinking her coffee.

"I'm leaving."

"Where are you going?"

"Home. I need time to sort out my thoughts. So..."

Minjuri, who gave a fleeting glance, turned her head coldly.

"I'd prefer if you didn't contact me first."

Leaving only the silence in the cafe, Minjuri disappeared.

In the quiet cafe, only Ryumin's sigh lingered.

"Sigh... I knew it would turn out like this, but experiencing it doesn't feel good."

Ryumin understands Minjuri's feelings.

The two people who believed in each other all this time are now judged as one.

Trust and values must have shattered completely.

"As much as trust is significant, betrayal is equally significant."

Seoarin, Kristin, and Rywon knew his true identity, but they weren't as shocked as Minjuri.

"In a way, is it natural? Minjuri had a crush on me for 3 or 4 years."

Given that she loved the real Ryumin in reality, her image of him must have been firmly established.

But today, that image has been completely shattered.

For Minjuri, who values trust between people the most, the psychological shock must be even greater.

"Should I have spoken earlier? Or should I have seriously shown evidence when she took my jokes seriously before? Would that have been better?"

If he had done that, maybe he wouldn't be as shocked as he is now.

"Or should I have opened up earlier, as Minjuri suggested?"

Whether it was a better choice or not, it doesn't matter now.

Spilled water.

It's too late to pick it up.

"But it's still better than holding on until the end. The more time passes, the more excuses pile up, and the situation worsens."

He couldn't hide it anymore.

It was a situation where he had to reveal it to obtain the last rune.

"Things might get better once Minjuri has time to organize her thoughts."

Minjuri needs time, no matter how reluctant she is to accept the truth. If enough time passes, she might be able to smile again.

"For now, let's plan how to obtain the rune."

Ryumin, sitting alone and sipping coffee, looked at the opposite side.

She left without taking a single sip.

"It's a waste to throw it away..."

It seems like someone needs to drink the caramel macchiato.

"Hyung?"

Ryuwon, the younger brother, opened the cafe door and walked in.

"Why did you ask me to come here? Couldn't you have told me at home?"

"I have something important to discuss."

"Something important?"

"First, have a seat."

Ryuwon, who took a seat, looked at the coffee in front of him.

"Did you already order mine?"

"Yeah. Do you like caramel macchiato?"

"I do."

"Great."

Ryumin, who spoke hesitantly, suddenly made a bombshell statement towards his brother, who was sipping coffee.

"I'm going to reveal my identity."

"What? What did you say?"

He almost spat out his coffee.

"I'm going to reveal my identity in front of the public. That I am the Black Scythe."

"W-what? Does that mean you're going to take off your mask?"

"I'll take off the mask, and I plan to reveal everything, including my name, which is Ryumin."

"Why? Why are you doing this?"

In his brother's gaze, there was a meaning that questioned why he would willingly reveal his identity and invite trouble.

'I know too. I know, but...'

To obtain the last rune that can be acquired in reality, he has to let go of everything.

"I want to make some donations after revealing my identity."

"Donations? All of a sudden?"

"Yeah. I'm planning to donate everything except for the necessary amount of money."

Currently, with over 1 trillion won in cash from selling stocks.

"About 100 billion should be enough to live on for a lifetime."

"You're going to donate everything except for 100 billion?"

"Yeah."

Ryuwon continuously showed a surprised expression.

Considering that he was talking about donating 99% of his assets, it was expected to be shocking.

"I-Is it real, hyung?"

"Yeah, it's real."

"Why suddenly donations..."

"We don't know what will happen in the future. I might not come back alive from Round 20."

Upon hearing that, Ryuwon had to be surprised once again.

The Black Scythe, the confident person, making such an uncertain statement.

Of course, Ryuwon didn't know that it was just an excuse to obtain the rune.

"Why are you saying such unsettling things to make people worried? As a regressor, you should know the information for Round 20, right?"
ChatGPT

"I don't know much about Round 20. I've only been there once."

"So, that means you could fail...?"

"Yeah, it's possible."

Was it because the words lacked certainty?

For the first time, Ryuwon felt a vague sense of unease.

"If something happens to me, I'll make arrangements for the property to go to you. So, don't worry about money..."

"How can someone say that?"

"Huh?"

"Don't worry about money? Do I seem like someone who is concerned about money right now?"

Ryuwon's gaze held concern, but it was certainly not about money.

It was a concern for his only blood relative, his family, the figure who was like a father, his older brother.

"You might die, and you're talking about such trivial things like money being a problem!"

"Well, don't exaggerate. Who said anything about dying? Do I look like someone who's going to die?"

Ryuwon lowered his head.

Even the Black Scythe, who made angels tremble, wasn't necessarily going to die in just Round 20.

"If I was going to give up like this, I wouldn't have regressed a hundred times. I will definitely survive. I will survive, so..."

A smile formed on Ryumin's lips.

"Don't worry too much. Got it?"

"Then don't talk about passing on the property."

"But I still have to do that. It's a kind of insurance, you know? Human affairs are unpredictable."

Even Ryumin doesn't know how things will turn out.

Because he doesn't know how strong the boss of Round 20 will be.

It was the same even if he read the semblance of Fluctuatus or Artharoth.

'I couldn't get any information about the round as if something was blocking it.'

So, Ryumin cannot guarantee that he will clear Round 20.

It was just a round he had experienced only once.

He had perished right in front of the most important boss room.

'So, I have to do my best. To obtain at least one more rune.'

Donating 99% of his assets was part of that effort.

"Let's go after you finish."

"Yeah..."

Only Ryuwon, who didn't know that fact, tried hard to suppress his uneasy feelings.

Click, click, click-

As Ryumin stood on the stage, the flash of cameras went off.

The Black Scythe, receiving the spotlight from around the world, appeared in the press conference room.

As usual, wearing a white mask.
ChatGPT

"Hello. I am the Black Scythe."

Click, click, click, click, click -

Even though he only greeted briefly, the flash bulbs went off incessantly.

It was understandable, considering that the most influential figure in the world, hailed as a living hero, was standing right there.

Of course, that wasn't the only reason.

"I'm sure you all know why I called for this press conference."

To reveal his identity.

With such a pre-announcement, the press conference room was more crowded than ever.

The opportunity to see the face of the Black Scythe, which had been veiled until now.

Who could miss such a scoop?

"I'm sure you're all eager to see it, so I'll show you right away."

Without hesitation, Ryumin removed the white mask.

Then, the face of the Lost Yak with a pale complexion was revealed.

Oh, that's the face of the Black Scythe.

He looks manly.

He's unnecessarily handsome, isn't he?

Along with the flashes, people's thoughts were heard.

Some female journalists even blushed.

However, what Ryumin was about to reveal was not just the face of the Lost Yak.

"You might know this is my face, but I have another real face."

"A real face?"

"What does that mean?"

Instead of answering, Ryumin transformed his appearance.

Although his physique remained the same, the dark skin turned pale, and his hairstyle became neater.

His face also changed noticeably from a bold, manly style to a more refined style.

"Uh!"

"What, what is it!"

There was a buzz in the press conference room.

It was quite shocking to suddenly change appearance in front of them.

"My name is Ryumin. I'm 20 years old, and this is my real appearance. As you can see, I have the ability to change my appearance."

With the sound of a surprise, some reporters were taken aback, while others hammered their laptops like crazy.

Just appearing on the front page of a portal site would not be enough for such a scoop.

"I'm sure many of you are surprised. They say that by revealing my identity, I can transform my appearance."

The reporters nodded in agreement.

It wasn't as shocking as the coming out of a famous celebrity.

"And you must be curious. Why am I revealing my identity now after hiding it so well for all this time?"

They were curious.
ChatGPT

With such sentiments, everyone focused on the words of the Black Scythe.

Ryumin, who looked around the audience, slowly opened his mouth.

"I can't guarantee whether I'll come back alive in the next round. So, I've decided. I will reveal my identity and make a donation."

"Donation?"

The murmurs surged again.

As Ryumin raised his hand, the noise subsided.

However, reducing the volume was in vain.

"I, Ryumin, have decided to contribute 99 billion won of my wealth back to society."

Along with the murmurs, flashes went off once again.
