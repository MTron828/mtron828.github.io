Title: Episode 252 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

End of Round 15

"John Delgado."

[Ranked 576th is 'John Delgado.'] [The fate of 576 survivors has been decided.] [The remaining players will be automatically eliminated.]

"Wait a moment! Elimination?"

"I don't want to die! I don't want to die!"

"Black scythe, you jerk! I asked you to save me!"

"You son of a b*tch! I'll curse you even in hell!"

"Live well wherever you end up, you piece of sh*t..."

Their words were cut off.

Ssssh-

Disintegrating at the molecular level, leaving only scattered ashes.

'Judging by their cursing, I made the right choice.'

Despite buying the resentment of hundreds, Ryu Min's face remained indifferent.

Ideally, he would want to proceed to the next round with a thousand others, but it was impossible due to system constraints.

'Previously, there were not even seven survivors from fifty, but now there are so many that there's no choice but to eliminate them.'

As if pruning a side branch of a tree.

'I'm sorry. But for the 20th round, it's inevitable. I can only keep those who will be helpful for the strategy.'

Especially John Delgado must be saved.

Utilizing him brings an additional reward, making it worthwhile.

However, the reason for pretending to hesitate at the end was different.

'I can sense Kristin's suspicions.'

As Ryu Min subtly turned his head, sure enough, Kristin was staring at him with a blank expression.

Why did Black Scythe spare John Delgado...?

Reading her thoughts, it seemed she couldn't understand why John was spared.

Ryu Min fully understood her reaction.

'Even though she knows he's an enemy, the situation is the same if I spare him.'

Deciding to explain later, he turned his head and saw Min Ju-ri and Seo Ah-rin.

Is Black Scythe alright? It must have been a huge burden...

Choosing a player to be eliminated with your own hands... I could never do that.

Both of them were secretly worried, but there was no need for that.
ChatGPT

"I've already seen enough deaths around me to become immune to it."

"In such a situation, choosing someone to be eliminated by my own hands is nothing."

Knowing well that he couldn't defy the laws of the system, he had no choice but to comply.

This time, Ryu Min's gaze fell on the believers of the Death Cult.

Phew, I survived. I almost died, didn't I?

If it weren't for the Death Cult, I would have been the one to be eliminated, right?

Joining the Death Cult was the best decision of my life.

The believers were relieved without a doubt.

They had saved their lives by joining the Death Cult.

[Finally, the fate of all 576 survivors has been determined. Congratulations to all of you chosen by the Black Scythe.]

Ryu Min widened his eyes.

The way the angel spoke somehow sounded sarcastic.

As their eyes met, the angel Milen cleared her throat and averted her gaze.

The angel also knew.

That the monster who killed the Archangel was the Black Scythe.

"Now, shall we see the results of the tally?"

★ Round 15 Tally Results ★

[Unified Zone CA-EA001]

└1st. Black Scythe (Level 95 Reaper)

└2nd. Crisy (Level 65 Priest)

└3rd. Democracy (Level 65 Buffer)

Instead of records, the ranking results formed through connections came to mind, and rewards were settled.

[For clearing Round 15, experience and gold will be distributed to all participants.] [Experience +237.9%] [Gold +1,000,000] [Your level has increased!] [Your level has increased!]

Ryu Min's level increased by 2, but others went from level 4 to level 5.

Most were approaching level 70.

"Congratulations! You have achieved the quest as the 1st in this zone!" [Currently, 'Black Scythe' is ranked 1st in this zone.] [As the 1st in this zone, you will be given the 'Infinite Material Pouch' as a reward!] [As the 1st in this zone, you will be given the 'Special Reward Selection Box' as a reward!]

The reward was an Infinite Material Pouch.

An item that randomly produces up to 5 different materials when used.

However, for Ryu Min, who had just reached the god rank, materials were not particularly needed.

"But I can't just leave them unused."
ChatGPT

Due to the penalty of disappearance if not used until the next round, Ryu Min had no choice but to use the items.

"I should try using them after returning. Even if only useless materials come out for me."

If materials appeared, he would either keep them and give them to others or create high-grade items as gifts for friends.

"However, the special reward selection box must be used by me."

As Ryu Min used it, the choices came up without hesitation.

[You can choose one of the following special rewards.] [Please touch the desired reward.]

└ 1. Temporary Skill – Sweeping Winds (Limited to Round 16)

└ 2. Temporary Skill – Heavenly Vision (Limited to Round 16)

└ 3. Information about Round 16

This time, there were two temporary skills.

"Sweeping Winds" was a passive skill applied immediately upon learning, converting weapons into area-of-effect damage.

"It's a good skill for sweeping away numerous monsters."

However, it was useless for Ryu Min, who could already widen the weapon's area with Thanatos's Black Scythe.

"There's only one suitable choice in this situation."

He chose option 2, "Heavenly Vision."

A temporary skill he had tried in Round 11, and it had been quite useful at the gambling den.

"It may not be as effective as back then, but it still has its uses in Round 16."

There were no other options, so he made the decision.

◀ ROUND 15 End ▶

[Unified Zone CA-EA001]

└ Survivors: 576

[After a while, your soul will be transferred to your original dimension.] [Round 16 will begin at midnight on April 1, 2023. See you in the next round. Congratulations on surviving.]

Back in reality, ordinary people were shocked by the news.

[Breaking News! 576 players left after Round 15.] [After 14 months of the Great Change, the global population has decreased from 1.8 billion to the 500s...] [Among the remaining 576 players, 174 are from Korea.]

The once numerous players had suddenly reduced to three digits.

While some saw the decrease in player numbers as welcome news, others voiced concerns.

└This is serious. If the player count decreases, it means there are fewer people to stop them.
ChatGPT

└Now the era of the players will begin.

└If the players unite and rampage, no one can stop them, right?

└Exactly.

└But do we need to come up with some countermeasures?

There were negative opinions, but they were in the minority.

The majority didn't worry too much.

There was a ruler overseeing the players.

└With the Black Scythe, what is there to worry about?

└Right. They harshly punished players committing crimes.

└If it were me, I wouldn't commit any crimes. I'd live quietly, even if it feels like living like a mouse out of fear.

└But is the Black Scythe really that strong? What if other players purposely confront him?

└Well, they'll all be defeated.

└I heard the level gap is still significant. While others are at most level 69, he's alone at level 97.

└Anyway, we don't need to worry because we have the Black Scythe in Korea. All 174 Korean players are members of the Death Cult, so they'll follow the control.

└Comment above. What is the Death Cult?

└It's a religion created by the Black Scythe. It's more like a gathering made by players to unite, rather than just a religion.

└Ah, like a cafe or something for players?

└The Player's Alliance is done for now.

└But out of 576 players, 174 are Korean players... Unexpectedly, Korea is a strong player nation? Haha.

└Suni explained the Death Cult above. If you want to know, know it properly. The Death Cult was created not by the Black Scythe but by a leader named Heo Taeseok. And it's not just in name, it's a real religion. The Black Scythe is revered as a god in the Death Cult. Know a bit before talking.

└Oh, it was a real religion? I didn't know.

└Just shut up. What god is the Black Scythe? He's just a human. And who is Heo Taeseok, some unknown guy?

└He's not unknown; he's a level 69 Black Mage. He's the leader and founder of the Death Cult.

└Who cares about Heo Taeseok? If you're curious, find out yourself.

└Leave it. The guy who commented might be Heo Taeseok.

Seeing the last comment, Heo Taeseok's hand hesitated.

Feeling pricked, he contemplated whether to delete the comment he made.

"Forget deletion. It's the truth."

Saying so, Heo Taeseok let out a deep sigh.
ChatGPT

His face looked shadowed, as if he had been disappointed by a woman. Strictly speaking, it wasn't a woman but a deity.

"No matter how much I think about it, I just don't understand. What on earth is the Black Scythe thinking...?"

The fact that he sacrificed his entire body in the 15th round mission was truly an awe-inspiring event.

Until that moment, Heo Taeseok's mood was flying high, almost exhilarated. However, that was only for a brief moment. When he checked his ranking, the excitement quickly turned cold.

"I'm 10th... I'm 10th..."

He didn't expect to be in the top 2 or 3. Well, to be honest, he had a tiny bit of hope.

After all, wasn't he the founder and leader of the Death Cult?

Being the right-hand man of the Black Scythe was a position that wasn't too far-fetched.

"No. People have dignity. I should hope for something worth hoping for. What have I done in the 15th round?"

He acknowledged that the second-place Kristin's Suturery played a significant role in the third mission.

If it weren't for the various buffs from third-place Min Ju-ri, the first and second missions would have been challenging.

Therefore, he wouldn't hope for second or third place.

"But why am I pushed down to 10th place...?"

Even though he knew it had no meaning in terms of rewards, people's feelings were like that, weren't they? Being ranked lower means you came up with things later.

It means you were overlooked in importance.

"What am I to the Black Scythe? Does he appreciate my efforts?"

Despite pledging loyalty to the point of sacrificing his life, the rewards in return were not that abundant.

At best, the Death Cult's position was moved from the countryside to Seoul.

"Hmm... now that I think about it, this is a building worth several hundred billion won. Moreover, they provided 100 million won for a year's operating expenses."

It seemed like he received some reward for his efforts, but in a way, it didn't feel like that.

In reality, Heo Taeseok hardly used the money he spent on himself. Most of it went into supporting and managing the Death Cult's followers or building operating expenses.

"In comparison to working, the operating expenses are... well..."

In fact, the money Heo Taeseok used for himself was almost negligible. Most of it went into supporting and managing the Death Cult's followers or building operating expenses.

In a way, it was like receiving minimal living expenses for volunteering.
ChatGPT

"I don't particularly desire material things."

He doesn't expect a big reward. He only hopes for acknowledgment for his efforts so far.

At the very least, he wants recognition as the cult leader.

"Hmm... Do I have to be satisfied just being 10th?"

Feeling discontent, Heo Taeseok suddenly looked at himself and was surprised for a moment.

To think that a creature like him would feel discontent toward a god.

Slap, slap!

Hitting his own cheek and shaking off the shaken faith, Heo Taeseok snapped out of it as if possessed.

"I am lacking. I am lacking. Lacking in faith..."

"What is lacking?"

Suddenly, Heo Taeseok was startled by a voice.

The person who entered was Eom Junseok, the deputy head priest.

"Why are you mumbling like that, Lord?"

"Well, it's nothing."

"Now is not the time to be like this."

"What's going on?"

"There are people who have come to the Death Cult. Follow me to see."

Saying so, Eom Junseok went out, and Heo Taeseok followed him.

It wasn't time for the followers to gather, so it was quite surprising.

'Huh?'

When he went outside the Death Cult courtyard, there were indeed people gathered.

There were about ten of them.

Moreover, all of them were foreigners.

'Why did these people come?'

Did they come as a group to see the Death Cult after hearing rumors?

At first, he thought so, but he soon realized.

Some of them were wearing items.

"Players?"

"Is this the Black Scythe's temple?"

Although the translation function only worked in the otherworld, Heo Taeseok couldn't understand.

"Hmm, no, it's not."

"Now is not the time for this."

"What's going on?"

"People who have come to the Death Cult are here. Come and see."

Saying so, Eom Junseok went out, and Heo Taeseok followed him.

It was not time for the followers to gather yet, so it was somewhat strange.

It wouldn't be bad for more believers to join, especially in times when there are few players.

The Black Scythe welcomed the entry of new believers at any time.

"All right. Since we need to conduct interviews, let's call in the Black Scythe."

Although it was good that ten believers had gathered, Heo Taeseok didn't know.

From that day on, all 175 players who had been saved by the Black Scythe would gather.
