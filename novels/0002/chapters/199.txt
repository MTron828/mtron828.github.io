Title: "Episode 199 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player"

The First Trial

"Damn it."

To be honest, John Delgado had been expecting it.

That the members of the Yangchewen organization would cut the throat of the Black Scythe.

To deliver revenge for that damn bastard.

But.

[The location of the target 'Black Scythe' has been identified.] [It is currently 501m away.] [To track the target, follow the arrow in front of you.]

Trying to track in this realm, the Black Scythe gets detected.

There was only one meaning to that.

'The Black Scythe, that bastard, is still alive!'

The fact that the Black Scythe is alive means the Yangchewen operation has failed.

'Why? We confirmed that the Black Scythe was residing until the end and executed the plan as planned. But why couldn't we kill him?'

After midnight, all they had to do was invade the villa and stab him in the neck—a simple plan.

According to the plan, the Black Scythe should have died shortly after entering this realm.

'But he's alive and well.'

To find out what happened, they needed to return.

At the moment, they couldn't know anything.

'If this is the case, should we proceed with the next operation?'

The operation of reconciling and becoming friendly with the Black Scythe, as suggested by Swingman, came to mind.

'Damn it, I can't do that. Me, getting along with that bastard...'

Bow down to the Iron Blooded Mercenary who cut off his own limbs and shake hands?

What could be more humiliating to one's pride?

'Swingman, that devilish bastard...'

He wanted to kill the Indian who came up with that damn plan, but now there was no other way.

They had to find the Black Scythe as planned.

'Ugh, I really hate this.'

Because he had absolute faith that the Yangchewen operation would succeed, he wasn't mentally prepared for this.

Once again, cursing at Swingman, an angel appeared and explained about the 12th round.

'Conquer the five trials? Form a party of five?'

Forming a party wasn't a problem.

Immediately, gathering only the Despair Cult disciples would result in nearly 200 people.

Just select the capable individuals among them and form a party—that would be enough.

"The problem is not knowing information about the trials."

You can't just choose anyone.

Unless you know what trials will come, you should choose a variety of professions.

But watching people who move quickly made him uneasy.

Moreover, didn't the angel say?

He would eliminate those who were eliminated.

"It's not the time to hesitate like this. I need to find a party quickly..."

His steps didn't falter due to the given mission.

"Darn it, should I really bow down and go to the Black Scythe?"

Now was the opportunity since he needed to find a party.

He could apologize to the Black Scythe for the previous incident, express regret, and then ask for a party.

"No, I can't. Even if I beat him to death, my pride won't allow it."

No matter how much money was offered, he couldn't lay himself flat in front of an opponent he wanted to kill.

"Ha... What the heck?"

John Delgado, who was sighing, absentmindedly used tracking as a habit and then widened his eyes.

"What is this?"

The distance to the Black Scythe had decreased from before.

No, for some reason, it was decreasing in real-time.

As if it were coming this way.

[Currently 363m away.] [Currently 222m away.] [Currently 113m away.]

...

[Currently 31m away.]

When the distance came within sight, John Delgado took his eyes off the message.

And then, he slowly opened his mouth in surprise.

The Black Scythe was actually approaching them.

"Hey, John Delgado. How have you been?"

"..."

Like a close friend, the Black Scythe extended his hand for a handshake and spoke with a shameless face.

"Are your arms and legs okay?"

"..."

"They're still attached? That's a relief."

John Delgado maintained silence.

It was too absurd, and there was no room to ask what was going on.

'That guy is coming to find me himself...'

He was curious about the reason, but he was too afraid to ask.

After the last time, a single wrong word might result in being caught and losing limbs.
ChatGPT

"What the hell is this bastard trying to do again..."

He wanted to kick that mouth right away and rip out the tongue, but he knew it was impossible.

So, John spoke, trying to conceal his surprise, more polite than before.

"Uh, what brings you here?"

"I'll be straightforward. John Delgado, let's form a party."

John's eyes widened.

It was an unexpected proposition.

"A, a party, what..."

"We have a spot open on our team. There's no one else to fill it but you."

Now that he looked closely, the Black Scythe was accompanied by other colleagues.

Two men and one woman.

But one of the men had a familiar nickname.

"Huh? Jeff?"

Wasn't Jeff the assassin Swingman hired to find the Black Scythe's whereabouts?

"Jeff, what are you doing here?"

"Do you know me?"

Jeff deliberately pretended not to recognize even when looking at the Summoner.

Because there were instructions from Ryu Min to act like they didn't know each other.

Upon hearing that, John also awkwardly scratched the back of his head, seemingly suspicious.

'Didn't recognize me without customization?'

On the contrary, Jeff had the same nickname, but his appearance in this realm was different.

'Could he have lied about his nickname?'

He thought that the Jeff he met in reality might not be the same as the one he met now.

"Are you acquainted with Jeff?"

"Oh, no. I think I mistook someone else."

John Delgado awkwardly adjusted his hair.

Even logically thinking, would the Black Scythe accompany the one who was stalking him?

He also seemed to be acting as if he saw John for the first time.

Now wasn't the time to think about someone like Jeff.

He was in a state of receiving an unexpected proposition.

'If I join, we'll have exactly five.'

If he accepted the offer now, they could form a team of five and escape from the last two.

Since John didn't have a team, there was no reason to refuse.

'Besides, I can naturally get close to the Black Scythe.'

If he shook hands and became a teammate now, he might achieve the goal of betraying and killing the Black Scythe later.

'It was daunting to bend my pride to him and approach, but it worked out well.'
ChatGPT

It would be more convenient for John if he extended his hand first.

However, he didn't easily take the Black Scythe's hand.

Somehow, it felt uneasy.

'What's the reason? Why would someone like me...?'

He might get punched again if he said something wrong, but he had to ask.

He needed to understand the guy's intentions.

"Why... Why do you want to party with me? There are plenty of other people to choose from..."

"I don't accept questions. Decide whether you'll do it or not, that's all."

"..."

The Black Scythe was firm.

He didn't provide reasons and only insisted on choosing whether to form a team.

'His goal isn't to kill me. If I become a party member, even the Black Scythe can't kill me.'

If that's the case, then why?

While John was pondering the reason, Ryu Min didn't give him time to think.

"I'll give you 10 seconds. Decide quickly."

"What?"

"If you don't decide, I'll take it as a rejection and find someone else. 10, 9..."

"Wait, just a moment."

"8, 7..."

As time ticked away, John's anxiety grew.

As if this were his last chance to approach the Black Scythe.

Thinking that way, his complicated thoughts were quickly organized.

'Y-yes. For the sake of the mission, I need to team up with the Black Scythe...'

When there were about 3 seconds left, John's mouth opened.

"I-I'll do it. Team."

"Alright. Now, shake hands and memorize the party formation command."

The five of them shook hands and simultaneously memorized the party formation command.

Then, golden rings composed of characters were fastened to their wrists.

[The 7,389th party has just been formed. Do your best. There are not many spots left.]

With the encouragement from the angel, people became even more desperate.

To avoid becoming the last two, they moved desperately, but losers were inevitable.

[Hohooho! Finally, 7,880 teams have been created, and unfortunate two remain!]

"No, please!"

"Save us, Angel! Please..."

[You should have begged the people, not me, for a party, tsk tsk. Well then, adiós!]

"No, no!"

With ruthless annihilation, the screams of the two players echoed like a reverb.
ChatGPT

"Now that the team is decided, shall we start the quest?"

With the angel's words, the background changed.

"Huh?"

Ryu Min's team, which was in a colorless space, was suddenly inside a dim cave.

Although the party members were startled when they entered the cave in an instant, Ryu Min remained calm.

'It's finally starting.'

Probably, each team was seeing the same scenery.

Because everyone must have landed in a place with a Trial Cave.

"Black Scythe, where is this...?"

"It seems to have started. I can see the cave."

Ryu Min, leaving behind the frozen party members, calmly stepped forward.

"There's no time to hesitate. The teams that quickly conquer survive. I'll lead, so follow closely."

Having said that, Ryu Min walked forward without even casting a glance behind.

"Wait, I'll buff you!"

Following her, Min Joo-ri hurriedly cast buffs.

Jeffrey and Joo Sung-tak also followed their master.

John Delgado, on the other hand, stood alone, watching the backs of his party members in bewilderment.

"Darn it, is this really how we formed a party?"

Although they had formed a party in a sudden twist of events, the Black Scythe didn't even care about him.

He didn't ask anything, just walked ahead, urging them to follow.

"Is he crazy?"

Making someone virtually an enemy into a party member.

He was a man with unpredictable intentions.

'In my heart, I'd like to stab him in the back right away, but...'

Since the party was already formed, any action seemed meaningless.

Rather, now that they were in the same boat, they had to survive together.

'Well, no matter what his intentions are, let's play along for now. Anyway, we approached the Black Scythe according to the plan, right?'

Comforting himself that he didn't need to bend his pride, he followed the group.

Meanwhile, the only woman, Min Joo-ri, turned back and spoke to John Delgado.

"John Delgado, sir. Please receive buffs here."

"Buffs?"

Bless, Swift, Safety Barrier – three types of buffs caused John's eyes to widen in disbelief.

'Crazy! Boosting stats like this?'

All stats increased by 70%, attack speed and movement speed by 70%, and a barrier that prevented surprise attacks.
ChatGPT

John just greeted with a surprised look and watched as the buffer ran forward again.

Ryu Min walked ahead, sensing if her teammates were following well.

From the first to the fifth trial.

With the knowledge of how to conquer them, it wasn't difficult.

'The first trial requires a tank.'

When they reached a dead-end wall, Ryu Min stopped.

Teammates arrived one after another, and like Ryu Min, they stood in front of the wall.

"The path... is blocked?"

As the five gathered, the conditions were met, and a message appeared.

[Welcome to the Trial Cave.] [Now, let's start the first trial.]

└Survive monster attacks for 10 minutes.

└Success ▶ Unlock the next trial.

└Failure ▶ One party member elimination through a vote.

"Survive monster attacks?"

John muttered as if questioning the meaning, but the message wasn't finished yet.

[Monsters will rush into the cave shortly.] [The monsters are invulnerable, and no damage can be dealt to them.] [If the party survives without significant damage for 10 minutes, the trial will end.] [On the contrary, if the damage received by party members exceeds the set threshold, it will be considered a failure, even if you endure for 10 minutes.] [If the trial is not overcome, one party member will be eliminated through an internal vote.]

"The monsters are coming here."

"Wait, if allies get hurt, enduring is still considered a failure, right?"

John was confused, but others remained calm.

They already knew from the prophecy.

'The first trial requires a tank. We have to minimize the damage to allies by taking hits ourselves and withstand the monsters.'

It was truly a mission testing the tank's qualities.

However, Ryu Min's team lacked a tank.

Nevertheless, Min Joo-ri following Black Scythe was mentioned in the prophecy.

No matter what happens, trust Black Scythe.

"Everyone, come behind me."

As Ryu Min stepped forward, party members crowded behind the dead-end wall.

Following Ryu Min's instructions, John also stood with Black Scythe as a shield.

'What am I supposed to do? Are they expecting me to block the monsters alone? Even though they're invulnerable, I won't be able to kill them?'
ChatGPT

I don't know what Black Scythe will do, but for now, I can only watch.

[Monsters will appear in 10 seconds. Please be prepared for the monsters' appearance together!]
