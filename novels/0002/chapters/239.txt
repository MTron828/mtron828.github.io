Title: Regression of the Level Max Player Episode 239

Episode 239: Devil's Confrontation

"What on earth is happening?"

Ryum-in, who was laughing while watching a casual mukbang just a moment ago, couldn't find a trace of laughter on his face now.

Red skin, bat wings, cat-like slit pupils, and a smooth tail - it was evident that a being resembling a demon stood in place of the player.

"Um, who is that person?"

"Suddenly, the bead enlarged, and a person came out of it."

"Looks exactly like a demon...."

Ryum-in chuckled at the bubbling sounds he heard.

"Not just like a demon but an actual demon."

From the 18th round onwards, players were given quests to wage war against demons. At that time, Ryum-in and seven other players survived and completed the quest.

"I've killed enough demons back then to know how they're born and what they taste like."

Normally, demons wouldn't appear before the 18th round. However, they suddenly started capturing and devouring people in the 14th round, surprising Ryum-in.

"It seems to be because of that book the archangel gave us...."

As soon as the mukbang started, members of the Messiah were captured, the bead enlarged, and the demon appeared as the bead shattered.

"It's like it hatched from the bead using the player as a sacrifice."

Regardless, caution was necessary. Just because the demon opposed angels didn't mean it was friendly to humans.

"Of course, I might be an exception."

Recently, with the capture of Uriel and Raguel, Ryum-in's reputation with the demon faction rose to the point of an "eternal alliance."

In other words, the demon wouldn't attack Ryum-in.

"Though it might be different for other players."

Those who were barely kept alive couldn't be left to die at the hands of the demon.

"Of course, I need to understand its intentions first... but strangely, I can't read its mind."

It was a rune of inner thoughts that worked even on angels.

Naturally, demons, being human-like, should have thoughts that could be read.

However, the demon in front of him was entirely unreadable.

As if it were a doll without a soul.

"This air, this environment, feels just like the human realm, but there's a slightly strange sensation."

A demon, who had been inhaling the air, soon spotted the players.

"Human? No, it feels different from both spirits and flesh. Are you players? In that case, this must be a place imitating the human realm."

Even the disappointed expression on the demon's face was momentary.

The corners of the demon's mouth were torn long.

"Well, does it matter? Even if the shell is different, a beetle is still a beetle."

In an instant, a sense of hostility flashed in the demon's eyes.

"Parasites like gnats. How about I kill them all, including those angel brats, while I'm at it? Hehehe."

With a wicked smile, just as the demon was laughing at the players.

"Huh? Oh, a demon?"

The demon raised its head in response to a voice from the sky.

"Who's this? A lowly angel like a gnat just appeared?" "Ah, how did a demon get here...? Oh, it's only the 14th round, hasn't it?"

Angel Milen looked puzzled.

Having come down to the other realm to tally the round results, she unexpectedly encountered a demon.

"If you're a guide, are you a 9th-grade angel? Huh, meeting an angel after a long time, and it's a lower angel inferior to humans. Quite disappointing."

Even with the demon's mockery, Milen couldn't assert her pride.

Just by looking, she could feel a strength that she, in her current state, couldn't contend with.

"It's amusing to see someone trembling in fear just by their appearance, thinking they can feel strength in this situation." "W-Who are you?" "If I tell you who I am? Would a pathetic piece of trash like you even understand?"

[...]
"Well, I might let you know. Have you ever heard of the Demon Lord Fluctuos?"

"Huh! Wait, could it be Demon Lord Fluctuos...?"
The angel's mouth opened wide in surprise.

For the watching players, it was a rare sight.

Seeing an angel surprised was an uncommon spectacle.

"Now that you know my identity, how about slowly descending? How long do you plan to stay above my head?" "Ah..."
ChatGPT

In response to those words, Milen, who had unconsciously started descending, halted in surprise.

"Well, hold on. Why should I listen to the words of a demon, not even an Archangel?"

No matter how high-ranking, who would be foolish enough to heed the words of an enemy?

"What are you doing instead of coming down? Can't you come down quickly?"

Rather than descending, the demon chuckled while watching the angel gradually move away.

"It's ridiculous. Dare a 9th-grade angel ignore my words?" "If I come down... you won't kill me, will you?" "I won't kill you. I just want to have a conversation."

However, Milen still didn't move.

She had learned that demons were a race that lied as easily as breathing. They were adept at waiting for the enemy to let their guard down.

Perhaps that's why her body was gradually ascending.

"I-I would like to descend and talk, but..." "This torn-up angel. She makes me want to curse."

The demon's gaze was solely focused on Milen.

"Do you think I'm in this situation just because I can't kill a puny gnat like you? Do you really think you can escape from my grasp?"

[...]
"Even after giving you a chance to live, you don't understand the situation and lack the manners of a proper lady. Fine, if that's what you wish, I'll personally bring you down, twist your wings, and tear your limbs apart like a bug."

For a moment, the demon couldn't continue speaking.

Unexpectedly, a human had approached him.

"W-What are you... human?"

The demon, after confirming the opponent, showed a surprised expression.

"You... the Black Scythe?"

Given his high reputation, he could easily recognize even someone he was meeting for the first time.

It might have been due to seeing the nickname above their head.

"I've heard the rumors about you, the Black Scythe."

The demon, with a crescent moon-like expression that resembled joy, whispered in a voice unheard by others.

"Heard you personally shattered the backbone of the Archangels. Well done. How did you acquire such power?"

"Have you heard the rumors, or did the system inform you?"

[...]
There was a somewhat displeased expression, but the demon quickly composed himself and coolly smiled.
ChatGPT

"Although I dislike humans who interrupt me to the point of trembling, our reliable ally, the Black Scythe, unknowingly did something, so I should personally extend mercy..."

"No need for long words. What's your purpose here?"

Ryum-in had no intention of paying attention to whatever the demon was babbling about. Angels, demons, humans—all were regarded as insects.

"Well, to answer your question, I didn't come here because I wanted to."

"And?"

"Someone used the Demon Resurrection Scroll. I descended here after consuming five sacrifices."

"Descended? Who do you think you are?"

"Demon Lord Pluxniptos. Ever heard of it?"

"First time hearing such a name."

"First time hearing it?"

Either his pride was hurt, or the demon's eyebrows twitched.

"Well, if you're just a player, you might not know. I'll admit that..."

"Enough of the useless talk; state your purpose."

"Arrogant... Even though we're allies, you've been quite rude since earlier. No manners, just like that gnat of an angel."

"A demon not stating their purpose doesn't deserve courtesy."

"Is that so? Then, perhaps you need a lesson in etiquette."

A whip appeared in the demon's hand. But before that, Ryum-in's hand moved first.

Thunk—

The demon's pupils lowered.

His forearm, holding the whip, fell into view.

"This human..."

"I told you to state your purpose."

"If I don't say?"

No answer was heard in response to the question.

Thunk—Roll—

In an instant, the demon's head rolled on the ground.

"This... Have you ever seen such a ridiculous situation?"

Demon Lord Pluxniptos was dumbfounded.

It was absurd enough that the Demon Resurrection Scroll he had lost during the Celestial Demon War had been used. However, what was even more absurd...

"He killed me just because I didn't state my purpose."

The Black Scythe, whom he thought was an ally, had killed his avatar.

"This is absurd."

Of course, since it was just an avatar, there was no harm to Pluxniptos. The one that had just died was nothing more than a puppet, representing 1/100th of his true power.

However, just a while ago, through the avatar, Pluxniptos had seen the world and even engaged in conversation. Therefore, he couldn't help but feel uncomfortable emotions.

Though he could view the killing of the avatar as a challenge to his own power, it was still an unexpected and unpleasant turn of events.

"Do you not know how high the position of the Demon Lord is? There's really no Thunder Beetle around here."

Given that he hadn't properly demonstrated his power, it was understandable for him to come off as arrogant.

"Tsk. Humans truly are nothing more than stubborn insects."

Seated on the throne of the Demon King, Pluxniptos clicked his tongue briefly.

From interrupting his speech to disrespectful actions and even killing his avatar—the Black Scythe had been impolite in various ways.

Despite being the one who had slain Archangels, the Black Scythe's behavior was hard to appreciate in this context.

"Trying to exterminate those guide-like gnats and player-like bugs, and ending up dead so quickly..."

Did he catch wind of the fact that he was about to be confronted? Without a chance to retaliate, he had been defeated.

"Daring to kill my avatar. Well, it provides a good excuse to cause turmoil. I should hold Michael responsible for this. He needs to answer for arbitrarily using the Demon Resurrection Scroll."

Beside Pluxniptos, five souls that were previously kidnapped using the Demon Resurrection Scroll were tied to a leash.

"Baal."

Baal, the top-ranked demon among the 72, emerged from the darkness.

"You called?" "These are not particularly remarkable human sacrifices. Put them in the fires of hell and use them as materials." "Understood."

With a gruesome sound, as Baal grabbed the leash, the Messiah members, including the ones indulging in a casual mukbang, sobbed with tears streaming down their faces.

"Please spare us, Master. Please release us." "We'll live righteously. Please spare us."

When Baal waved his hand, however, no voices came out. They only moved their mouths like silent goldfish.

"Let's go, you bugs."

After Baal took the souls with him, Pluxniptos suddenly had a peculiar thought.

"But it's strange. Why couldn't my avatar avoid and survive? Even though it's just 1% of my power, it's a puppet with strength rivaling an Archangel. It's impossible for it to die without any response."

"Hmm... Could it be that the Black Scythe player is that powerful?"

Although it had already been proven by killing four Archangels, perhaps the Black Scythe was even stronger than imagined.

Chin in hand, lost in thought, Pluxniptos soon made a decision.
ChatGPT

"I think I should bring the Black Scythe to the Demon King's Castle."

The demon with crimson skin disappears, scattering sulfur powder.

"The avatar of Pluxniptos?"

Although Ryu Min pretended not to know a little while ago to provoke, in reality, he was aware of it.

How sinister of a being the Demon Lord Pluxniptos was.

"I've heard the words of NPCs from the otherworld. The one who effectively governs the Demon Realm is Pluxniptos."

While there might be Demon Kings in the Demon Realm, they are merely illusory existences. The one who truly controls the Demon Realm is the Demon Lord Pluxniptos.

Ryu Min had caught glimpses of him fighting against angels during Round 18.

"Whether human or angel, he swept them all away. Even if we're allies, he's not to be trusted."

In reputation, they might be allies, but he is by no means on the side of humans. Knowing this fact well, as soon as he saw the Black Scythe draw a weapon, Ryu Min severed the arm and decapitated him.

"It seems he could manifest in the otherworld using the Demon Resurrection Scroll."

In the process, the mukbang and his Messiah slaves disappeared as sacrifices, but Ryu Min didn't mind.

"By the way..."

Ryu Min couldn't hide his awkward expression while looking at the message that appeared before him.

"The Demon's reputation regarding the Black Scythe has dropped from 'Eternal Allies' to 'Very Friendly.'"

"Killing just one avatar caused an immediate reputation drop."

As it was the avatar of Pluxniptos, it seemed that it left a rather unpleasant impression.

"Doesn't matter. Even if I didn't kill him, he would have swept away everyone here, be they angels or humans."

Although the reputation had dropped, there was a pleasing message as well.

"[You have defeated Pluxniptos's Avatar.] [You are confirmed as the first player to kill a high-level demon.] [You have obtained the title 'One who Challenges Evil.']"

"It's the first time I've received this title. After all, I haven't killed the Demon Lord before."

In reality, it was merely killing an avatar, but it seemed to be treated as killing the Demon Lord himself.

Curious, Ryu Min immediately opened the information on the title.
