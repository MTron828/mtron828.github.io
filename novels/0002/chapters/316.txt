Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 316"

Skill Sharing

When Ryu Min first checked the rune information, he couldn't help but be surprised.

'The limits of the level are gone.'

Doesn't that mean surpassing the 99th level cap for a max-level player?

And that's the only case.

'It wouldn't be bad to make use of the max-level title and synergy.'

The max-level title that increases all stats as much as the level and the rune with good compatibility were not without regrets, even though Ryu Min had reached a level where leveling up was too late.

'To have this kind of rune come out at the last round. It's regrettable.'

At the point where he left the last round, a rune that transcends the level appeared.

Moreover, it allows gaining experience from all enemies, so killing either Celestials or Demons serves as a stepping stone for growth.

'Well, what can I do? Only one round remains now.'

Although he would like to keep growing endlessly, time is running out.

Moreover, experience doesn't come in during the last 20 rounds due to the round's characteristics.

The reason for hitting max level before reaching the 20th round was here.

'Of course, it's written that experience comes from all enemies, so whether the round's characteristics will apply or not remains to be seen...'

The problem is, isn't there an absolute lack of time to hunt?

Even if he raises his level a bit, he can't expect to become significantly stronger.

'The fastest I could hit max level was just after the 11th round. If I had obtained the rune then, how much could I have grown? What if I had obtained it even in the 18th round when I hit max level?'

If there had been enough time to hunt, it wouldn't have been regrettable even if such a rune appeared at the end.

'Still, it's satisfying. I've become stronger to an incomparable extent compared to before.'

In this round, Ryu Min is stronger than any previous round.

Having achieved the Divine Transformation, he has also collected more items and runes than ever before.

It's a status window that would leave anyone speechless.
Therefore, Ryu Min was confident.
No matter who comes out in the boss room, he will kill them.
'But I still need to be fully prepared.'
Since it's the last round, thorough preparation is a must.
To do that, he needs to meet his party members tomorrow.
There's a lot to discuss with each other.
Closing his eyes, Ryu Min immersed himself in contemplation.
His brain was working quickly for the last-round strategy.

Rumble, rumbleâ€”
The Grim Reaper Guild was bustling with unexpected people.
They were the players who gathered at the call of the Black Scythe just yesterday.
Each having earned 2.3 billion gold, they didn't buy tickets to go home.
This was because the Black Scythe's instruction to wait for just one more day had been given.
"When did he say he'd come?"
"He'll be here soon."
ChatGPT

As the appointed time approached, people gathered in the Grim Reaper Guild.

They all eagerly awaited the arrival of the Black Scythe.

Among them was Min Juri.

"Oh? Ms. Min Juri!"

"Ahrin, hi."

Seo Arin greeted Min Juri with a familiar nod.

"Why didn't you reply to my text?"

"I did?"

"Check it."

Min Juri looked at the message history and let out a short sigh.

"Oh... really? I'm sorry. I didn't do that on purpose. I've been distracted lately."

"What's going on?"

"Work, nothing much."

Seeing Min Juri clapping her hands, Seo Arin became suspicious.

Her innocent face seemed to suggest that there really was nothing going on.

"Why didn't you come yesterday? Mr. Ryu Min even shared gold."

"Ryu Min? Who's that?"

The gaze of the audience turned to Min Juri at that moment.

To think that she didn't know the name that everyone in the world now knew.

Seo Arin, too, had an incredulous expression.

"What? Are you joking?"

"Is this a joke? Who is that person?"

"It's not a joke, Min Juri."

"No, I'm really asking because I don't know..."

Min Juri felt unfairly treated.

Ryu Min was a non-existent entity in her memory.

But in the eyes of others, especially in the eyes of Seo Arin, who knew the relationship between them, it seemed strange.

"Why is that? Did the two of you fight?"

"What? What are you talking about..."

Just then, a player who had overheard the conversation intervened.

"Don't you watch the news? The real name of the Black Scythe is Ryu Min."

"What? Really?"

As everyone looked puzzled, a commotion arose.

"Oh? It's the Black Scythe!"

As the appointed time arrived, Ryu Min appeared.

Everyone in the Grim Reaper Guild turned their attention to him.

Following the gaze, Min Juri couldn't help but be surprised.

It was the man she had spoken to in the cafe.

"Oh? Why is that person over there..."

"Why is he like this for real?"

With a consistent concept, Seo Arin looked at Min Juri with a face that seemed about to burst.

Pretending not to know someone everyone should know was truly ironic.

"Everyone's here."
ChatGPT

Unlike usual, Ryu Min appeared without his mask, revealing his true face, and surveyed the audience.

Counting heads, he found that all 71 members were present.

In the midst of it, his eyes met Min Juri's, but he deliberately averted his gaze.

Mental preparation on this side was also complete.

"Chief Instructor."

"Yes, Black Scythe."

Eom Jun-seok, who had taken Huh Tae-seok's position as Chief Instructor, approached Ryu Min.

"From now on, I'll interpret everything I say into English so that everyone can understand."

"Understood."

Ryu Min climbed onto the podium he had prepared in advance and opened his mouth.

"Thank you all for waiting. The reason I called you together again is no different from before. It's to prepare for the 20th round. We can't afford to sit idle just because we lack information."

In reality, there was information.

The location of the boss room and its existence.

And the fact that you need a party of five or more to enter.

But revealing such facts would also require explaining about regression, making it a bit awkward.

That's why Ryu Min pretended not to know and hid the information.

"I don't know the mission for the 20th round. That's why we have no choice but to face it directly. But don't worry. If we anticipate the mission and prepare countermeasures, our success rate will exponentially increase. We've experienced the effects so far."

The followers nodded at Ryu Min's words.

Knowing or not knowing information about the next round makes a world of difference.

Thanks to the information Ryu Min provided, many lives were saved multiple times.

"Therefore, we need to predict. What will the quest be for the next round? What kind of trial will the angels give us last? Of course, predicting their extraordinary quests is not easy. Still, let's anticipate the most probable one, which is probably all of us gathering to defeat the boss."

"The boss?"

"Hmm, it seems likely for the final quest."

People murmured in agreement.

Ryu Min subtly leaked information about the boss room.

"If hunting the boss is the final quest, there may be enemies appearing on a different level than before. That's why we need to coordinate and be prepared."

Players who agreed with Ryu Min's words nodded their heads.

Only Min Juri looked at him with a puzzled expression.

"We don't know which boss will appear, but we need both strategy and tactics. Regardless of what comes out, I'll be the first to fight, but it wouldn't hurt to synchronize our breaths in case of unforeseen circumstances."

"Yes."

"So, before we plan tactics, let's take some time to share our skills. Since we've all reached max level, there might be skills that others don't know."

The suggestion to share skills seemed obvious. To coordinate as team members, it's essential to know about each other's skills, isn't it?

"Let me start first..."

Ryu Min explained skills that other players needed to be aware of, such as Night of Death and Moonlight Island. He didn't mention skills that others didn't need to know about, like Mark of Death or Death Sentence.

"As you probably already know, if I take a step back after wielding my scythe for about a second, it means I'm using Moonlight Island. So be careful not to get caught in the range unnecessarily. Since we don't know if the 20th round will be a solo or party mission, be cautious."

"Understood."

"Now, let's have a representative from the Warrior class come forward to share their skills. Chief Instructor."

"Yes."

"If you have skills that people should know, please share them."

Eom Jun-seok climbed onto the podium and explained skills in front of the gathered crowd.

After that, Dorothy, as the representative of the Archer class, and Jeffrey, as the representative of the Assassin class, took turns sharing their skills.

"My max-level skill is [Rainbow Shot]. It fires seven arrows of seven different colors simultaneously, each adding a different attribute. Red adds fire damage, orange adds piercing damage, yellow adds holy damage, green adds..."

"As an Assassin, I have the [Doppelganger] skill. It's a skill I use when things get dangerous, creating a decoy. Even if my decoy dies, don't be surprised. My max-level skill is [Shadow Form], which completely assimilates into darkness, an evasion-type assassination skill..."

Sharing one's skills might become a vulnerability, but the players willingly stepped forward to explain.

The unanimous opinion was that since the 19th round already had missions involving fighting against each other, the 20th round might likely be a cooperative mission.

"For those who already know, the Blacksmith's skill enhances weapons and equipment, a buff-type skill called [Enchant]. The max-level skill is also a buff called [Enchant], which fully assimilates into darkness, an evasion-type assassination skill..."

"I am the unique class, Mercenary King. My basic skill is [Recruit Mercenary], which allows me to enlist players with the Mercenary class under my affiliation. When affiliated, the abilities of the recruited player are enhanced by 50%, and I also become stronger with more mercenaries, creating a win-win structure."

Starting with Jo Yong-ho, the introduction of unique classes continued.

"I have the profession of Grand Mage. Most of my skills are offensive, and the max-level skill is [Meteor Storm]..."

"Hello, I'll introduce Priest skills. I have [Heal], [Blessing of the Holy Maiden], and [Resurrection], and the max-level skill is..."

"The Alchemist's max-level skill is [Potion Brewing]. It's a skill that manufactures potions that didn't exist before, allowing the creation of various effective potions, including invisibility..."

"As a Summoner, my skills are summoning, and the last max-level skill is [Resonance Echo]. It's a skill that temporarily makes summoned creatures invincible. The description says it can make other summoned creatures invincible as well, but I haven't tested..."

Everyone explained their skills.

During that time, Min Juri couldn't avoid participating.

"Next is Minjoo."

"...."

"Minjoo?"

"Oh."

Min Juri, who was absent-minded, snapped out of it and climbed onto the podium.

However, her gaze was not on the people but on the Black Scythe.

"Again? You saw me back then at the cafe, right?"
