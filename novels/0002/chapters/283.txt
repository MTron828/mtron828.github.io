Title: Episode 283 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

Start of Round 18

For the past two weeks, Ryumin had distributed points to everyone, not only to Seo Arin but also to all those he had made promises to.

A whopping one million points per person.

"Minjuri, Seo Arin, Kristin, Jo Yongho, Heo Taeseok, Eom Junseok, Russell, Victor, Sophia, Jeffrey, Alex, Dorothy, Yumti, John Delgado, Ju Sungtak... Who else was there?"

Counting on his fingers, he realized that a total of 15 people had received points.

A total of 15 million points had disappeared over the past two weeks.

"Is my remaining share only 1 million points?"

There wasn't much left, but he wasn't disappointed.

"It's useless points anyway, might as well distribute them to those who will be helpful in the boss battle to strengthen our forces. It's much more beneficial."

With 1 million points, he could create various expensive equipment and even make two legendary-grade items.

"Of course, I need to know the combination method."

Using an experience point pack could instantly raise him by 5 levels.

Well, it might not compare to god-tier rankings, but it was something.

Time waits for no one.

June 1, 2023, midnight.

As expected, on that day, 286 players set foot on the land of the otherworld.

"Huh? Where is this?"

The players were greeted by intense heat, floating sulfur dust, and a sky that seemed to be opening.

The environment that seemed like the end welcomed the players.

This was the stage for Round 18 - Hell.

"They said we would fight in hell this round..."

"It looks exactly like what I imagined."

"So, hell really looks like this."

"Soon, a war will break out here, right? With demons, no less."

"This is nerve-wracking."

"What do demons even look like?"

People murmured anxiously, each with their own thoughts.

It was not only the first round encountering demons, but also the anticipation of directly participating in a war that made everything more thrilling.

Observing this, Ryumin smirked.

"In times like these, where we were busy competing at our desks in this peaceful era, who would have thought we'd be drawn into a war between angels and demons?"
ChatGPT

Strictly speaking, it was nothing more than a friendly match, not a real war, but what difference did it make?

In terms of risking players' lives, it was no different from a real war.

At that moment, a light flashed in the sky that seemed as if even meteors might fall.

[You've come? Our reliable players?]

Normally, people might have frowned at the smiling angel, finding it unpleasant, but for some reason, there was no particular reaction to the quest.

[Today, you all need to help us, the angels, a lot. Wondering what that means? First, let me reveal the quest and explain!]

◀ ROUND 18 ▶

└ Victory in the War Against the Demons

[Unified Zone CA-EA001]

└ Participants: 286

└ Achievers: 0/143

It was a quest that had already been hinted at.

The situation was already being mentally prepared for.

So, there was no one surprised.

Except for the angels.

[Huh? Why is no one surprised? Like you all knew about the quest in advance?]

"Do we have to be startled by your jokes every time?"

Players who were not surprised by the quest turned their puzzled eyes to one place.

The one who responded to the angel was none other than Ryumin.

Even the angel Milen looked down at Ryumin with a bewildered expression.

'Dare to talk back on the topic of humans?'

In his heart, he wanted to use divine punishment and kill him, but unfortunately, he had used it a long time ago.

Moreover, in this round, due to the angels and players being on the same team, the use of divine punishment was blocked.

Even if there were uses left, it couldn't be used.

[Ha... Crawling up to angels on the topic of humans. This is the first time I've encountered such an absurd enemy.]

"Whether it's absurd or not, it's none of my business. Shouldn't you just explain to the players instead of talking nonsense every time? Did the system order you to do that?"

[Are you crazy? Human, did you finally lose your mind after coming to Round 18? Do you want to die?]

"Can you kill me? Then try."

[....]

"You're so afraid that you can't even come down from the sky? Acting tough about guiding topics that even the combat angels can't handle."

Milen's expression froze as if his brain had shut down.

Was the fact attack too much?

"Even if your status is low, you should know. The psychopath human who killed six Archangels is me."

[......]

"Just because I'm floating in the sky doesn't mean I can't be killed, you know? I've been quiet so far because I needed guidance, but if you keep bothering me, I might kill you too. You should know that even if you die, you'll be replaced by another guide anyway."

Even with no wind blowing, Milen's wings trembled.

From his expression, it seemed he wasn't angered by the insulting words but was rather feeling fear from the threat.

"So, shut up and do your job, explain the quest. Don't babble or mock unnecessarily. This situation might seem amusing to you, but it's not for us."

[......]

"If you understand, explain quickly."

[We, well... l-let me continue the explanation.]

Milen began explaining as instructed, trying to conceal his confusion.

[T-this round, as it says, is a round where we engage in war with the demons. You all have to fight against the demons as a team with us angels to achieve victory.]

Pausing for a moment, Milen glanced at Ryumin.

The cold, dagger-like gaze sent shivers down the spine.

[I-it might be dissatisfying for you to fight alongside us. However, you must not try to kill the angels. Since we're on the same team, everyone is recognized as a party, so you won't be able to kill each other anyway.]

Milen knew that the Black Scythe couldn't kill him, but he was still afraid.

Because he would be the guide for the next round as well.

[Unlike the last round, even if you win the war this time, not everyone will survive. Based on the contribution to victory, we'll rank you, and only half will be able to survive.]

Not everyone will survive this time.

Only half will make it.

This information, also obtained from the Black Scythe, didn't change the expressions of the people.

Instead, they maintained tense expressions from the beginning until now.

Even though they were on the same team, it felt like a competition.

[D-despite the animosity between us, let's join forces this time to defeat the cunning demons together. F-fighting!]

'Faking enthusiasm even when you don't mean it. It's pitiful.'

Ryumin smirked at that moment.

Whoosh-
ChatGPT

The sound of war horns echoed through the heavens.

"[I-it has begun. W-well, then, good luck!]"

The guiding angel disappeared as if fleeing.

Following that, gates were created.

From the radiant gates that appeared nearby, combat angels adorned in splendid armor emerged.

From the gates of darkness that appeared in the distance, demons clad in crimson armor emerged.

Angels and demons crossed over from the gates, stepping onto the land of hell.

Countless, continuously.

"H-how many are they?"

The forces constantly pouring in from the gates became overwhelming, making it difficult to grasp at a glance.

When it reached a certain point, the gates closed, and the influx of forces ceased.

Comparing the forces on both sides with the naked eye, the demon side was overwhelmingly larger.

[In a moment, a war between 5,000 angels (+286 players) and 10,000 demons will begin.] [The side that first reduces its forces to 10% or below will be considered defeated.]

"The demons are twice as many!"

"C-can we win this?"

A shadow fell upon the faces of the people.

It was natural to worry since they had never faced demons before, but they would soon realize.

That the demons were weaker than expected.

"If we compare demons to monsters, they are at the level of High Orcs. Of course, that's the weakest among them."

Although there was a numerical difference, it didn't mean that the angels were inferior.

Even a 6th-rank combat angel could easily defeat a High Orc on their own.

"It seems not only 6th-rank but also 5th, 4th, and 3rd-rank angels are here, in various grades."

The rank of combat angels could be identified by the insignia on their armor.

As Ryu Min looked around, he even spotted 1st-rank angels.

Ryu Min's lips curled up like he had found a high-quality prey.

However, there was truly something to be happy about.

As he anticipated, Micael appeared.

[Black Scythe.]

"Oh, you're here?"

Even though Ryu Min acted like he knew, Micael was cautious in his demeanor.

[I'd like to have a brief conversation with you.]

"Sure."

Conscious of the surrounding gazes, Micael led Ryu Min to a quiet space.
ChatGPT

Upon seeing him again, Ryu Min smiled as if welcoming an old friend.

"You managed to stay alive? I was worried about what would happen if you died."

[Fortunately, your plan worked. I was able to deceive the gods.]

However, Micael seemed oddly indecisive.

"But why is your expression like that? Like a puppy needing to relieve itself."

[Um, well... there's something I'd like to ask you...]

Observing Micael hesitating to speak, Ryu Min immediately caught on.

There was an unnaturalness in his expression.

'This guy is acting.'

Sure enough, contrary to the awkward expression and reluctance to speak, Micael was calculating the timing of his lines like a script in his mind.

"What's the favor?"

[Could you go and have a conversation with the Demon Lord for once?]

"You want me to meet the Demon Lord?"

[The gods still wish for you to be handed over to the Demon Lord. It's not about betraying you. If they see you and the Demon Lord conversing, they'll consider it as the gods reaching out as promised. You don't need to hear what they talk about.]

"So you just want to show the contact from above, right? No need to actually go to the Demon Lord."

[Exactly, exactly. It's not such a difficult request, is it?]

Ryu Min nodded.

It wasn't really a difficult request.

He had originally planned to meet Pluto in Round 18.

The issue was that Micael was deceiving him.

'He's deliberately leaving out the content of their negotiations, and on top of that, he can't leave the Demon Lord's territory if he steps inside the Demon Lord's castle.'

Although Micael was telling him to just show the contact without any danger, it was far from the truth.

Entering the Demon Lord's castle wasn't something anyone could do freely.

Once a player entered, they couldn't leave unless granted permission by Pluto.

[Don't worry about not being able to escape. Just exchange a few words with the Demon Lord and then quickly run back to our side. It shouldn't be a problem.]

He spoke as if to reassure him, but both Ryu Min and Micael were well aware that there was no guarantee he could escape once he entered.

"You wretched guy. You talked about how I have to stay alive so you can become a god, and now you're trying to sell me off to the demons?"

Instead of transferring the authority of the Akashic Record, he deduced through his thoughts that Micael had extended the grace period to Round 18 and decided to hand himself over.

He wasn't exactly sure what the Akashic Record was.

"It seems he's more afraid of losing in the war than becoming a god."

He understood that, but it was mind-boggling how shamelessly Micael was trying to force him into sacrificing himself.

Of course, he had also planned to use Micael and then kill him.

"I'm in trouble for using him for so long. I knew this would happen."

Without realizing that he had set his own day of reckoning, Micael urged for an answer.

[Plea. Can you do it?]

To that question, Ryu Min pulled the corner of his mouth and laughed.

"Of course."
