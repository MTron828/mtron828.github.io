Title: "Episode 300 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max Level Player"

What was planned?

It wasn't just Christine who stiffened at the appearance of the Black Scythe.

Three players, including scholars, also froze like statues, rolling their eyes like marbles.

"What were we talking about?"

"Ah, Lord Black Scythe..."

Ryumin looked at Geoffrey without asking anyone else.

Immediately, in a businesslike tone like a slave, a report popped out.

"While protecting Chrissy according to Lord Black Scythe's orders, those three over there approached Chrissy with unpleasant intentions."

"Unpleasant intentions!"

"Don't talk nonsense!"

The agitated scholar urgently turned to Black Scythe.

"Oh, hello. Lord Black Scythe. Do you remember me? We shook hands during the interview with the Divine Messengers...?"

"I don't know who you are."

"What? You don't know? You can't not know, considering that they made the faces in reality and the otherworld exactly the same..."

"I don't remember faces."

"What?"

The scholar's eyebrows twitched, but only for a moment. He wasn't so stupid as to lose control of his expression in front of the max-level Black Scythe.

"Haha... Well, there were many people I interviewed, so it's understandable if you don't remember... That, well, it's possible."

"That's enough. What do you want to say?"

"Oh, yes, yes. Please don't believe what this Geoffrey person is saying. It's pure lies, just shouting nonsense that comes out of delusions."

"They didn't approach with malicious intent?"

"Of course not. We came to look after Chrissy because we've received help from her before, and we were worried she might be in danger. We absolutely did not approach with any unpleasant intentions, as that guy claims."

"Yes, yes, that's right. That guy is just talking nonsense without any evidence. Don't believe him."

"We just drew our daggers first because our faces look similar to X. We're just responding to his nonsense."

"That's right. Judging people solely based on appearance is not right!"

The three desperately explained to Black Scythe.

There was absolutely no malicious intent.

They didn't actually do anything like that.

"......"

Ryumin, who had been quietly observing, turned to Geoffrey and asked, "Are these people lying?"

"No, they're telling the truth. I simply judged them as dangerous based on my personal feelings. I apologize."

Geoffrey admitted cleanly.

The slave's heart didn't want to make petty excuses in front of his master.

"You see? It's not true."

"That guy, earlier he looked like he was going to pop his eyeballs out like he wanted to kill someone, but in front of Lord Black Scythe, he turned into a docile lamb."

"You, don't live like that! Pulling out a knife in front of a strict person, tsk."

"Don't do that next time! Got it?"

The three, now deflated, threw a word each at Geoffrey and then turned away.

They wanted to quickly leave because it was uncomfortable with Black Scythe around.

However,

"Wait."

Black Scythe had no intention of just letting them go.

"Why, why are you doing this?"

"Who said anyone can go?"

"..."

"No one can go without my permission."

Under Black Scythe's command, the three could no longer take their steps.

They didn't have the courage to refuse the order of the top-ranked player.

"W-What business do you have with us...?"

"..."

Although the scholar bravely spoke on behalf of the group, Black Scythe remained silent as if trying to see through their thoughts.

"No, just go away."

"Yes, yes!"

As if relieved, the three quickly left their seats.

Ryumin, who had been watching the three disappear for a while, turned his gaze to Christine.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes, I'm fine."

"Was there anything else?"

"Well..."

The answer came from Geoffrey's mouth instead.

"Christine was being chased by an ogre. She almost lost her life..."

Geoffrey reported with a bowed head, seeming embarrassed.

If he had arrived a little earlier, Christine wouldn't have been in danger.

However, Christine seemed completely indifferent.

"I'm fine. Why are you apologizing, Jeff? Anyway, you saved my life. Thank you, even if it's a bit late for greetings."

Jeffrey didn't say anything more in response to Christine's words.

"Setting that aside... Jeffrey came because of my orders, but what about Dorothy?"

"Huh? Oh, well, I..."

Feeling the pressure from Black Scythe's gaze, Dorothy explained the situation.

"There was such a situation. I came to repay a favor. I understand. Thank you for coming to help, anyway."

"Yes?"

Why is Black Scythe thanking them when they came to help Christine? The reason became clear from Black Scythe's words.

"Christine is an essential existence for me."

"Oh, I see."

Christine's face turned red when Black Scythe openly stated in front of others that she was an essential existence.

"Well, Black Scythe, what brings you here?"

"I came to protect you."

Trying to change the topic, she ended up receiving a direct hit.

With a fiery face, Christine couldn't react one way or the other.

"It's a dangerous round for someone without combat abilities to survive."

"Well, that's true. I almost died three times from the ogre..."

Ryumin maintained a calm expression even when mentioning the near-death experiences.

‘Three times? If she didn't have god-tier armor, wouldn't she have died by now?’

He almost lost Christine, feeling indifferent despite the near-death experiences.

‘It wasn't the time to be hunting. Supporters might be in danger.’

He realized he had been too complacent, sending the slaves instead of securing their safety and hunting.

‘I need to reflect.’

Instead of dwelling on it, he decided to meet other supporters.

"Don't worry now. Dorothy and Jeffrey will take care of you. Dorothy, I'm counting on you."

"Oh, yes. Don't worry, Black Scythe. I will protect Christine even if it costs me my life."

As Dorothy confidently spoke, Ryumin felt reassured.

Jeffrey, being a slave, was trustworthy without the need for further words.

At that moment, Christine's inner thoughts echoed in Ryumin's mind.

It would be better if Black Scythe protected me...

Although both of them were protecting her, there was no one as reliable as Ryumin.

Christine's thoughts were not incomprehensible.

However, Ryumin had tasks to complete.

Not only did he need to protect Christine, but he also had to secure a large amount of stats through hunting in this round.

This was the only chance to become significantly stronger.

"This round has many dangers scattered throughout. So, it's important for trustworthy people to stick together to survive."

"How do we distinguish trustworthy people?"

"Don't worry about that; I'll do the distinguishing. Just move in the direction I indicate."

Ryumin pointed to a location with his finger.

"If you move straight in that direction, you'll reach a twin canyon. I'll send other comrades there, so gather there."

"Will Lord Black Scythe also come?"

"I'll go after my work is done."

Having designated the meeting place, Ryumin used invisibility and disappeared.

Dorothy was surprised when he completely concealed even his presence, but others turned their heads towards one direction as if they were familiar.

In the direction Ryumin pointed.

"Let's go."

"Phew, that was close."

"We almost became X."

Feeling a sense of relief as they thought they had moved a sufficient distance, players, including the scholar, took a breath.

"Suddenly, Black Scythe appeared, and it was chaos."

"Yeah, if we had fought, it would have been a complete X."

"Why did that woman, Dorothy, suddenly show up? Tsk."

"If that woman hadn't appeared, we could have managed 3 against 2."

Honestly, their intention from the beginning was to kill Jeffrey and plunder Christine.

Their target was always Christine.

"Darn it, if we had just killed Jeffrey, we could have taken over. But that Dorothy had to interfere."

"Still, wasn't it manageable even with Dorothy? With 3 against 3, we had a chance."

"That's right. Until Black Scythe appeared, we had a fighting chance."

The moment they realized they couldn't win even if all three of them attacked, there was only one thought in their minds.

They had to leave the place quickly.

Before Black Scythe caught on to their intentions.

"Luckily, he didn't notice, right?"

"Yeah, it seemed like that."

"I didn't expect him to let us go so calmly. Hehehe."

"If strength alone is enough, what's the use? Your heads are empty."

"Puhuk, a fallen messenger kid."

The three, sneering while mocking Black Scythe, soon licked their lips as if expressing regret.

"Too bad. If it weren't for the others, we could have stripped the saint as planned."

"Yeah. If we had stuck together under the pretense of protection, we could have enjoyed the honey for 72 hours, receiving healing and buffs."

"And when she became unnecessary, we could have just killed her. Right?"

"No, just killing is too wasteful. It's better to enjoy and kill if needed, right?"

"Then how do we decide the order?"

"Obviously, it's me first, you brat."

"What are you saying, you audacious punk?"

"Puhuhuhuhuk."

While the three laughed and chatted, the ogre appeared.

Growwwl!

However, frighteningly, as soon as it appeared, its throat was pierced, and wounds covered its entire body.

As if trying to vent their frustration, the trio mercilessly attacked, and blood splattered all over them.

"Hoo, hoo. Darn it, but we missed such a good opportunity."

"That darn woman. I thought she was innocent, but she was already rolling around with that Jeffrey guy."

"If it weren't for Black Scythe, we could have fought even with Dorothy. X, really."

"By the way, Jeffrey, what's up with him? He behaved as if he was ordered by Black Scythe?"

"Is he Black Scythe's lackey?"

Wiping the blood off their faces with rough breaths, they suddenly had this thought.

"Hey, why should we run away from Black Scythe?"

"Yeah. Honestly, what did we do wrong? Did we rape the saint with vulgar words? Or did we pick a fight first?"

"It was that punk Jeffrey who picked a fight first."

"That's right. Now that I think about it, it pisses me off."

"I didn't do anything, why should we be told to piss off? That darn punk."

"If it's Black Scythe, so what? Darn punk."

As they grumbled and expressed dissatisfaction, the three suddenly smiled bitterly.

"Well, if that darn guy didn't show up, we were planning to rape. Hehehe."

However, the smile was short-lived.

"What were you planning to do?"

At the voice of a third party heard in their ears, the three turned their heads in horror.

There stood a figure with a smiling face they didn't want to face.
