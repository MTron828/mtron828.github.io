"I heard it clearly. They said they would loot me."

Sobbing, Subina, with her knees pulled close, buried her head deeply.

How would a cow feel knowing it's about to be slaughtered?

Since realizing the horrifying events that were about to unfold, every hour became restless, and every footstep echoed with anxiety.

This time, it felt like it was her turn.

"If only I were the player, I wouldn't be going through this."

Helplessness consumed Subina's mind.

"Maybe, maybe it would be better to just bite my tongue and die..."

She had thought about suicide several times, but the accompanying pain was too frightening.

But considering the future pain she would endure, suicide seemed like the right choice.

"What should I do..."

At that moment, footsteps echoed in the quiet basement.

The footsteps seemed relentless, as if they wouldn't allow time for thought.

"Oh, you're here. Th-this must be the boss for sure."

However, the voice that reached her ears was that of an unfamiliar woman.

"Huh? Are there people here too?"

Subina, who had been closing her eyes out of fear, cautiously opened them at the sound of a foreign language.

A woman. And she was dressed in a ridiculous outfit.

"That attire... Could she be a player?"

Crack!

Using a dagger she held in her hand, the woman broke the lock on the bars. Subina realized she possessed extraordinary strength, far beyond that of an ordinary person.

Subina, who had given up hope, didn't even realize that she had been rescued.

"Come out. Hurry up."

When the woman gestured, Subina, with a puzzled expression, walked out.

"Uh, where are you trying to take me?"

"What are you saying? Just come with me."

"...?"

When Subina hesitated to follow, the woman grabbed her hand and pulled her along.

From the nauseating basement, the two emerged into the open air.

There were sporadic woods and an open space resembling a courtyard.

Under the streetlamp lights, a gathering of people could be seen and heard.

"What, what is this? It's scary."

Subina was still on guard, but soon her expression softened as she recognized the faces of the women who had been kidnapped from this place.

"What are you all doing here..."

Subina was momentarily surprised when she saw the pile beneath their feet.

It was a human corpse.

The smell of blood rose belatedly, making her nauseous, but only for a moment.

"Huh?"

When she saw the face of the organization boss who had intimidated her, strangely, the nauseating feeling disappeared.

The corpses were not just limited to one.

Looking around more, she realized there were numerous bodies, likely members of the organization.

"What, what happened..."

At that moment, a suspicious man wearing a white mask approached the Asian player.

"Yamti, have you released all the kidnapped people?"

"Yes. I thoroughly searched with detection skills, and everyone here is accounted for."

"Is that so?"

Ryumin counted the people gathered.

All of them were women, precisely twelve in number.

They were all imprisoned behind iron bars arranged throughout the building.

"Hello."

When Ryumin greeted in English, everyone's attention focused on him.

Since English was commonly used even in Nigeria, no one among them didn't understand.

However, perhaps because of the masks, they all looked at him with guarded eyes.

"There's no need to be so cautious. As you can see, we are players who have come to rescue you. You've already seen the evidence, right?"

Ryumin pointed to the ground, and the women nodded.

The demons who had ridiculed and humiliated them were reduced to a handful of meat chunks.

Ryumin intentionally didn't erase the traces to show the women.

"As you can see, we killed the organization's boss. We also killed all 21 organization members who were here. The complete threat has disappeared, so you can rest assured. In other words, you are free. You can go home."

"Is that true?"

"We're really free?"

In disbelief, Ryumin took out a key from his pocket.

"Here's the car key I took from the organization members. Those who can drive, take it and go home. Here you go."

As Ryumin handed over the key, the women, only now realizing the reality of their freedom, teared up.

"Phew, thankfully. Really, thankfully."

"Now we can go home."

Ryumin knew how agonizing days the trapped women had spent in this place.

He had heard about their atrocities from the organization boss.

"They're the ones who kidnap seemingly unassuming travelers or ordinary people in their 30s or older, confine them like livestock, and then sell them to other organizations for a large sum. In a way, you could call them the primary suppliers."

In this process, verbal abuse, physical violence, threats, and rape occurred as if it were part of daily life. In cases where a virgin was needed, they even refrained from rape, but according to the kidnapped women, it was equally despairing.

"Anyway, this organization is solely involved in human trafficking, not like IS."

Ryumin, who had previously tried to infiltrate IS to build the reputation of the Black Scythe, didn't have precise information about the headquarters of IS. Since it was a decentralized organization that constantly changed locations, he saw no need to remember each one.

"In any case, if I gradually dismantle the ground-level organizations, IS will eventually surface."

With numerous factions stemming from IS, it becomes easy to obtain information by targeting only a few organizations.

In a previous encounter, Ryumin successfully located the leader of IS using a similar approach.

Moreover, with Yamti present, gathering information and luring out key figures would be even easier.

"Take only two cars, as there won't be anything good left in the rest. After driving, dispose of the cars to avoid being traced."

"Thank you, really, thank you."

"Thank you for saving us."

"You are our savior."

The women expressed their gratitude towards Ryumin with tears in their eyes.

However, Subina, who had been expressing gratitude among the women, seemed not to ask the important question, as if she had been waiting.

"But may I ask for the name of our savior..."

Responding to the awaited question, Ryumin smiled beneath his mask.

"I am the Black Scythe. That's all you need to know."

"The Black Scythe..."

"I'll remember it."

"I won't forget it for a lifetime."

Ryumin didn't hesitate to reveal his nickname. Even rescuing women from a human trafficking organization would contribute to the reputation of the Black Scythe. That was one of the reasons he wore the mask.

"Now, please go. It's getting late."

As Ryumin waved his hand, Subina asked a question.

"But aren't you, Black Scythe, leaving too?"

"I have tasks to attend to here, so please go ahead."

"Oh, then we'll leave first."

"We won't forget this kindness."

"Thank you so much."

The women showed their first bright smiles.

As the women boarded the van and disappeared, only Ryumin and Yamti remained in the organization's location.

Ryumin proceeded to erase traces by disposing of numerous corpses.

Then, he extended his hand to Yamti.

"Did you secure his phone?"

"Yes. It's right here."

Ryumin, taking the deceased boss's phone, sent a text message in English.

"Three women, one man, urgently available at 20% discount. Contact me."

It was a message sent to the contact listed as the organization's business partner.

Soon, a reply arrived.

"Okay. We'll come right away."

"They took the bait."

Ryumin, lifting the corner of his mouth, smiled and said, "Shall we prepare to welcome our guests, then?"
