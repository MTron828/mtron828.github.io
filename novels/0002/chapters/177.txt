Title: Episode 177 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

The Forest of the Labyrinth

"Black Scythe-nim!"

As Ju Sungtak approached, Ryu Min gave him a meaningful look.

"Be quiet. Even if there's no one around, don't make it so obvious."

"Sorry, sorry."

Ju Sungtak, who always had a fiery look in his eyes when looking at himself, lowered his gaze like a gentle puppy as Ryu Min scolded him.

Reading the thoughts in his head, it was filled with absolute obedience to the master.

'That's why the duel system is good. By agreeing to a duel, you can wield influence almost equal to dominance.'

Although having a male slave wasn't originally part of the plan, seeing Ju Sungtak, Ryu Min thought it was a good decision.

At least he didn't harbor dark intentions or act slimy towards his owner like Yantti did.

"Ju Sungtak."

"Yes, master."

"Follow me so you don't get lost. From here on, it's the entrance to the labyrinth."

"Labyrinth?"

The current location of Ryu Min was the entrance to the Forest of the Labyrinth.

He was determined to defeat the boss, Doppelganger, and obtain the ring that could transform his nickname.

'To do that, I need Ju Sungtak's rune that increases the drop rate of boss-level items by ten times. It won't be easy to get the Doppelganger's ring.'

The reason Ryu Min called Ju Sungtak was for this purpose.

He needed Ju Sungtak's help to defeat the boss.

"If it's a labyrinth, is this forest it?"

"Yes. We'll defeat the boss here. For that, I need your help."

"Boss? What kind of boss?"

'Cancelling out the point that male slaves are better.'

Talking to Ju Sungtak revealed a downside.

He asked too many questions.

"Just follow without unnecessary chatter."

"Sorry, sorry. I'll quietly follow."

As Ryu Min entered the forest, he didn't look back.

Even without looking, he could sense who might be following him from a mile away.

"Did he enter?"

"Yes, he entered. He's with another guy."

Seeing Black Scythe entering the forest with another man, Siezcang smirked.

"What could be there that he just enters without even thinking?"

Translation:

In a forest so eerily desolate that anyone would hesitate at least once, Black Scythe confidently entered as soon as his comrade appeared, as if he knew what would come out from within.

"Isn't it suspicious? Will you follow?"

"Turn back after coming this far? Of course, I'll follow. Hey, Bbangz."

"Yes?"

The Korean player who was held shoulder to shoulder with him looked at him with a defeated expression.

"Why are you standing there foolishly? Hurry up and guide us."

"Oh, I understand. This way..."

"If you daydream, you'll die. Got it?"

"Yes..."

As the Korean player stuttered and took the lead, Siezcang's mocking laughter pierced through.

"This guy is dragging his feet. Tsk."

"Um... Siezcang-nim. But, are you really planning to face Black Scythe? Isn't it dangerous?"

"Kid, don't worry. Who am I? I'm Siezcang, ranked 3rd in the Black Society hierarchy, damn it."

Originally, the plan was to hide the goal of confronting Black Scythe, but with the Korean guide in tow, it couldn't be avoided to some extent.

Of course, the strategy of using subordinates as bait was kept secret, and a mixture of truth and lies was presented.

"If I can persuade him in Korean, he'll have to let his guard down. Then, I can just strike him from behind, right?"

"The plan is good, but the opponent is the famous Black Scythe..."

"To catch a tiger, you have to enter the tiger's den. If you don't come out of the well, you'll only catch tadpoles forever. In this one life, if you're a man, you have to play in deep waters, right?"

"You're right."

"Then shut up and trust me. If the plan goes well, we can hit it big."

"Understood. I'll only trust Siezcang-nim."

Having convinced his subordinates, Siezcang grinned and traced the steps of Black Scythe.

Unaware of who might be following behind him.

"Director Ahn, are we going in the right direction?"

"Yes. Black Scythe entered this way."

In front of Magyeongrok was a vast forest.

It seemed dangerous just to look at it, an unusual forest emitting a sinister aura.

"The information says Black Scythe entered here."

"According to the guide, that seems to be the case."

"But did you see earlier? It looked like someone else entered this forest too."
ChatGPT

Translation:

"Yes. It seemed like a group of over ten players."

The two of them witnessed players forming a group and entering the forest.

From a distance, it was impossible to confirm whether they were allies or enemies, but what was certain is that they hesitated like themselves before entering the forest.

"I wonder if there are others chasing Black Scythe?"

Given his face and well-known nickname, it wouldn't be surprising if someone was tracking him.

The problem was that if they continued tracking, they might encounter other people.

"Are they guys like me sticking to Black Scythe to get some crumbs?"

He might find out more if he stuck closer.

They could possibly be players from other countries.

"If they're players from other countries, we should assess the situation and kill them if necessary."

To prepare for any situation that might lead to violence, Magyeongrok informed Ahn Sangcheol.

"Director Ahn, if you encounter players from other countries, take the opportunity to kill them."

"Yes? Kill them?"

"Whether they like it or not, they probably have the same mindset as us. According to the rules, we can only become enemies. The one who strikes first survives."

"Oh, I understand."

"Keep your exploration skills on. Just in case of unexpected situations."

"Got it."

The two finally entered the Forest of the Labyrinth.

Unaware that it was a difficult place to escape from.

The Forest of the Labyrinth, located between the Albitz Kingdom and the Brahm Kingdom.

This place was an unknown territory even within the kingdom.

No one who entered had ever returned alive.

"I was a bit scared when I first heard the NPC's explanation. I thought I might lose a round just by entering for no reason."

However, even at that time, Ryu Min, who was growing distinctly, managed to safely escape the Forest of the Labyrinth.

"Although I wandered around in the forest for a good 5 hours."

The Forest of the Labyrinth was indeed a challenging place to escape.

At first glance, it seemed like an ordinary forest path, but every 5 minutes, the route changed like a cube, creating new intersections based on the walker's location.

In other words, the Forest of the Labyrinth divided people entering it with countless possibilities and patterns.

"The person who was following right behind could easily be lost in a moment after just 5 minutes."
ChatGPT

Translation:

That's why Ryu Min instructed Ju Sungtak to stick closely to him.

"Don't come next to me, just follow from behind. Keep a distance of more than 5m."

"Yes, Master."

Since Ju Sungtak knew the way, as long as he followed well, there was no risk of becoming separated like a lost family member.

"Escaping should take about 15 minutes."

What initially took 5 hours to escape had gradually reduced as the rounds repeated, leading to the current situation.

Ryu Min memorized all the paths and patterns of the labyrinth after 25 attempts.

"Now, will those newcomers who first entered be able to escape the labyrinth like me?"

Ryu Min smirked as he looked at the group following him.

While entering might have been easy for them, leaving wouldn't be.

"Probably, it will take them at least 5 hours like me."

Unfortunately, they might end up trapped for 24 hours if luck wasn't on their side.

If it came to that point, the team must have accumulated a lot of points inside the labyrinth.

"I understand why you followed. The Chinese and Magyeongrok's group too."

However, Ryu Min had no intention of letting them go easily.

"You guys shouldn't leave the labyrinth."

The Chinese and Magyeongrok considered players walking around as points.

If released from the labyrinth, they would likely roam around committing murders like untethered foals.

"Purposely luring them into the labyrinth was for this reason."

Though it might seem like they followed, Ryu Min was actually luring them.

"I told Minjuri as well. Stay away from Black Scythe this round."

The reason for this prophecy was simple - he didn't want Minjuri to get involved unnecessarily.

They couldn't afford to let anyone get lost in the labyrinth.

"Come and chase me. Whether you can find me in this labyrinth, I don't know."

Ryu Min, with a sly grin, moved deeper into the labyrinth.

Under the leadership of Siezcang, Black Society members entered deeper into the labyrinth.

Their trust in Siezcang, a reliable senior, was the reason they continued to move deeper into the dense forest.

However, that trust didn't last long.

After five minutes of entering the forest, the Korean who was leading suddenly stopped.

"Huh?"

"What's wrong, Bbangz?"
ChatGPT

Translation:

"That, tracking seems strange."

"What are you talking about? What's strange?"

"Tracking... it's impossible."

"What?"

Siezcang's expression twisted like an evil spirit.

"What kind of nonsense are you talking about?"

"I-it's true. P-please believe me!"

The Korean player trembled as he spoke.

It seemed too real to be acting.

'Is it real?'

Just like Siezcang, doubts arose in the minds of his subordinates.

"Why are you doing this? Siezcang-nim? What's the problem?"

"Ah, well..."

In a fleeting moment, Siezcang debated whether to tell the truth or not.

The deliberation didn't last long.

"This crazy guy says let's take a short break."

"What did you say?"

"Bbangz has gone completely insane."

"He's making such remarks even when caught. Seriously?"

"Looking at his swollen face, we could probably split his stomach open and pull him out right now."

The subordinates raised their voices towards the Korean player, who had not communicated. As the situation turned hostile, he could only cower.

'If I had told the truth, my dignity of suggesting to follow Black Scythe would have been ridiculed. It was a good thing I lied.'

Smirking inwardly, Siezcang cursed in Korean.

"Just go!"

"Yes?"

"Even if tracking is impossible, just go ahead!"

"Ah, understood."

Despite the message of tracking being impossible, the Korean player continued to move forward blindly.

What could he do when told to just go?

If they criticize, let them.

'Damn, what's going on? Why can't I track all of a sudden?'

Siezcang, suspecting others, tried using tracking on someone else.

[No signal detected. Tracking is not possible.]

The person Siezcang thought of was one of his subordinates right beside him.

'Even right beside, tracking is not possible?'

Just to be sure, he tried using the exploration skill on the surroundings.

[No signal detected. Exploration is not possible.]

'What's going on?'

How could it be that the skills were suddenly malfunctioning?

A short while ago, they were working fine.

'Damn it. How did I step into this damn place...?'
