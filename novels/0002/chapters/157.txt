Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 157"

Episode 157: "Battle Angel"

The ordinary angel, Kalen, couldn't hide her surprise.

"What, what did that human just say?"

For a moment, she thought she misheard, but looking at the human's expression, it wasn't the case.

A clear smirk.

A contemptuous laugh directed towards her, an inferior being.

"A human insect... What has become of their mind?"

"My mind is perfectly fine, Kalen."

"What? Haha..."

Kalen's expression, initially devoid of understanding, suddenly twisted in an instant.

"That damn human! It won't do. You just have to die."

Without hesitation, Kalen used her one-time special ability, "[Assassination]," towards the human in front of her.

It was a privilege given to control humans, an ability that worked exclusively on them.

However...

"Huh? Wh-why is this happening? Huh?"

Kalen, genuinely bewildered, muttered without realizing.

"Why isn't it working?"

No matter how many times she tried, it didn't work.

"There should be an opportunity to use [Assassination], right?"

Since acquiring this ability, she had never used it against a human.

Even if she didn't use it, it was unsettling enough just to have the ability.

"But why isn't it working? Why?"

Despite her desire to explode the arrogant human's head like a firework, nothing happened.

"Die! Just die! Die, you insect!"

Even if she stared as if to kill, shouted internally, there was no change.

All that reached her ears was the pitiful struggle of the unfortunate human, not the sound of a bursting head.

"What are you doing? I told you to die. Why? Why not?"

"Pr-profit...!"

"Of course, it won't work. [Assassination] is an ability that affects the mind."

"You, how could you...?"

"Let's not dwell on that."

Ryumin approached with a devilish smile.

"There's one thing you need to know. Who is the victor and who is the loser."

"Obviously, I am the victor."

"Have you ever been slapped by an insect?"

"What?"

Ryumin's hand moved swiftly.

Snap!
ChatGPT

The angel turned her head completely and collapsed like the tragic heroine.

Soon, the slapped cheek began to glow bright red.

Ryumin's hands moved successively.

Snap! Snap! Snap!

The angel couldn't react to the point where it was impossible to see when Ryumin swung his arms.

No, she didn't even have the intention to respond to the shock she had never experienced in her lifetime.

Who would have known that after receiving a request for assistance and descending, she would be slapped by the human who had been ignoring her as if she were an insect?

Snap! Snap! Snap!

The more she was hit, the angel's lips swelled, and blood splattered.

Without [Assassination], she was just an ordinary angel, helpless against the power of the player.

At first glance, it seemed like a cold slap without mercy, but in reality, Ryumin was pouring all his attention into controlling his strength.

Not that it wasn't intentional; it was the effect of the title, "[The First Angel Slayer Against the Holy]" that doubled all stats against the divine attribute.

"I shouldn't accidentally kill her. I should just hit her enough to hurt her pride."

After hitting ten times, Ryumin's hand finally stopped.

"That should be enough."

The once-white angel's cheeks swelled like heated iron, and her lips burst, letting blood flow.

"How does it feel to be hit by an insect?"

[....]

"Now, do you understand the situation? Who is the victor and who is the loser?"

Instead of answering the question, Kalen glared at the human with venomous eyes.

Once again, she attempted to use [Assassination], but it inevitably failed.

"Why the hell isn't it working? Why, why, why!"

In her internal frustration, Kalen's gaze suddenly fixed on a particular human.

"Could it be that [Assassination] doesn't work on me?"

As a test, she used her ability towards that human.

Snap!

The head of a triumphant figure behind Ryumin burst like a firework.

Although it worked perfectly, there was no reaction.

"It worked so well, why is there no response!"

It was frustrating, but at least, with [Assassination], the means of counterattack were gone.

"No, it's not over yet."

Feather knives concealed in her wings.

With these, she might be able to kill that damn human.

But Kalen only left it as a thought.

She had no confidence.

No certainty.
ChatGPT

Can a mere dagger suppress a human reveling in overwhelming power?

"First, I should ask this guy what he wants," Kalen thought, gritting her teeth, planning to seize the next opportunity. In an angry tone, she asked, "[What do you want from me? Human?]"

"What do I want? It's obvious."

The human, speaking with a mocking tone like a rogue, reached out his hand.

"Give me items."

"What?"

"I won't make unreasonable demands like excluding me from the survival game or making me survive until round 20. You angels can't change the system anyway."

[....]

"Instead, make reasonable requests. Give me items, like weapons."

[Ah, items?]

"You angels created this system, right? So, hand them over. I'm asking nicely. There must be a way, right? If you don't have items, give me something else."

The human's demand was simple.

He wasn't asking for something as significant as tampering with the system.

It was a request for something that could be beneficial.

"That's impossible. I'm just a 9th-grade angel occasionally doing substitute duty or guiding tasks!"

Kalen's mission was to occasionally substitute or guide tasks.

There was no way she could freely give out items.

Originally, the system was designed that way.

"It's not just me. No higher-ranking angels have the authority to give items."

Everything revolves around the system in this world.

While humans may think that angels planned and brought them into the survival game, the reality is quite different.

They were just ordinary angels serving as guides.

"What should I do? If I tell the truth, this crazy human won't stay quiet...."

As Kalen remained silent, Ryumin, looking irritated, struck her again.

Smack!

"Not giving it to me? Won't you speak?"

[Ugh....]

Although not as hard as before, Kalen still expressed pain.

Her cheek had swollen enough to hurt even with a slight touch.

"That damn human!"

More than the pain, her pride was hurt.

In her desperation for revenge, an idea flashed in her mind.
ChatGPT

"Yeah, let's deceive this stupid human and trap him. He's the idiot who believes I can give him items in the first place."

As Ryumin was about to strike again, Kalen urgently shouted while concealing her inner thoughts.

[St-stop! I'll give you items!]

"Now the conversation is getting through. Quickly hand them over."

[Wa-wait. I don't have the authority, but another angel can give them. I'll summon one.]

"Another angel?"

Ryumin grinned and nodded as if giving permission.

"Summon. Calling those winged birdbrains won't be a threat anyway. Just don't take a single step from here. Can you do that? Angels should have a means of communication, right?"

[Alright. Wait for just 3 minutes. I'll summon an angel who will provide the reward...]

As Ryumin clenched his fist and waited, Kalen inwardly sighed.

She had to force herself to suppress the laughter that was about to burst out.

"Hehehe, you insect-like human. Your life is now forfeit. Dare you mock angels?!"

The angel Kalen was calling was a Battle Angel.

A level above ordinary angels, created solely for destruction and slaughter.

"If a Battle Angel comes, your life is as good as over."

Kalen, keeping an eye on the human, transmitted signals and messages to her superiors.

Fortunately, the guy didn't know what he was doing. He didn't know who she called.

He showed an indifferent expression, as if he didn't care or know who she was summoning.

"Well, he has no idea who I'm calling. Kick, kick."

She silently swallowed her laughter, but there were three things the angel didn't know.

First, her thoughts were fully exposed to the human in front of her.

Second, the human before her was powerful enough to tear apart a Battle Angel.

Lastly,

'That I'm intentionally delaying and feigning to summon the Battle Angel.'

Ryumin, who could read thoughts, couldn't possibly be unaware of what the angel was plotting.

What kind of trick the angel was up to.

'He might think there's a chance of winning if I summon a Battle Angel, but there's no way.'

Originally, Ryumin's goal was to kill the Battle Angel to receive the initial reward.

Calling a Battle Angel was, in fact, what he hoped for.

It was also part of Ryumin's plan.
ChatGPT

"That's right, by demanding an unreasonable reward and resorting to threats, I can force this foolish human into a trap. At least, this way, even if it hurts his pride, he'll call a Battle Angel."

If she had demanded to summon a Battle Angel from the beginning, he might have resisted and not called for it.

Angels were a race with strong pride.

"So, that's why I pretended to be clueless and played along like a brat."

Luckily, he was playing along as she wanted.

Soon, the Battle Angel would arrive, and Ryumin would be able to claim the initial defeat reward.

Ryumin looked at the hidden Yanti behind him.

He gestured, and she understood, concealing herself to avoid any interference.

Unless the enchanting runes failed, Yanti wouldn't intervene.

Dealing with angels was solely within Ryumin's domain.

"Come on. I'll tear apart anyone who shows up."

Ryumin's eyes shone like a beast, eagerly waiting for the prey to appear.

Angels are divided into levels ranging from 9th to 1st grade.

9th to 7th grade are ordinary angels.

6th to 4th grade are regular Battle Angels.

3rd to 1st grade are Battle Angels, with 1st grade being the highest.

There are also 7 Archangels outside the standard classification.

Up to this point, it was the well-known ranking system of the heavenly realm.

Once aware of their grades, many aspired to achieve public recognition and dreamt of becoming higher-ranked angels.

However, to Bayel, a 6th-grade Battle Angel, public recognition didn't matter much.

He was so exhausted that he felt like he might go crazy if he didn't get at least an hour of sleep.

[Sigh. If only I had slept for an hour.]

Bayel yawned continuously, having stayed up all night on duty since yesterday.

Angels also have physical bodies.

Though their living conditions differed, they still slept to relieve the fatigue of the day.

The only difference was that they didn't experience hunger, so they didn't eat or relieve themselves.

[Sleep for noble angels. I wonder why God made us like this. It would have been better if He made us incorporeal beings without any desires.]

Of course, having desires, such as eating, sleeping, and so on, was still better than humans.

[How do humans endure such bothersome routines repeatedly? Oh, is it because of desires?]

Bayel knew.

Angels were a noble race with incomparable strength and mental power compared to humans.
ChatGPT

Having a frail physical body that couldn't even overcome sleepiness was frustrating, but overall, Bayel was satisfied.

Of course, he wasn't satisfied with the current location and the need to wait for the distress signal.

[Tired of this. It would be nice if something happened.]

Just as he muttered, trying to endure his drowsiness.

Something did happen.

"Huh? A distress signal?"

A distress signal echoed from his assigned area.

Immediately, Bayel perked up his ears and heard the message conveyed by a 9th-grade angel.

[Being threatened by a human suspected to be a player. Please help, Battle Angel.]

"A Battle Angel being threatened by an insect-like human?"

It seemed impossible, but it wasn't entirely out of the realm of possibility.

Without the ability to use [Sisal], a regular angel couldn't resist if captured.

Hence, ordinary angels were strictly prohibited from getting close to players.

"What a foolish creature. Why even have wings if you're not going to use them?"

Bayel shook his head as if mocking the situation.

The reputation of an angel wasn't a mere word.

Contrary to the annoying tone, his mouth curled into a smirk.

"Finally, a break from this boredom."

It was a rare opportunity to relieve stress.

Facing a player as a Battle Angel meant there would be an instant execution feeling.

In other words, disassembling the human body while playing with it wouldn't be a problem.

Moreover, even if it was a small achievement, it could be recognized publicly.

"I don't know what kind of human it is, but they picked the wrong one. I'll go kill them right away."

He knew the location because the signal had been transmitted.

With that, Bayel disappeared in an instant, accompanied by a burst of light.
