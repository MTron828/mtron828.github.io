Title: Episode 304 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Devils

Ryu Min had not actually been tracking Heo Tae-seok.

"I thought Victor would be in danger, but what is this...?"

Only belatedly did he rush over with the thought of securing the safety of the supporters, but he never thought such a chaotic scene would unfold.

"Krrrr...."

"This guy has lost his mind."

Seeing the person baring their fangs like a beast towards himself, Ryu Min sighed.

Who would dare harbor thoughts of living against someone worshipped as a god by followers?

Even though it seemed clearly out of their right mind, Ryu Min could already understand their thoughts.

"All they think about is killing everyone in their mind."

No matter how insane someone becomes, there's only one thought that can prevail.

It's not a normal thought process.

"Someone has tampered with their mind."

He detected external interference and had a suspicion of who it might be.

There was only one person with such an ability.

"Plutox. He's in the other world."

After reading Plutox's thoughts last time, Ryu Min understood his ability.

By taking away a bit of his power, he could turn humans into demons driven by revenge.

So the culprit was crystal clear.

"Plutox turned Heo Tae-seok into a demon like entity."

He tried the command function for a moment, but it was a state of uncontrollable chaos.

A complete transformation into a demonic appearance.

Currently, he was nothing more and nothing less than a beast.

"Khaaaaah!"

Heo Tae-seok, driven by revenge for his severed arm, rushed forward.

However, he had chosen the wrong opponent.

Sshk!

His neck cleanly severed, his body writhed on the ground.

Looking at Heo Tae-seok, who died somewhat disappointingly, Ryu Min wore a regretful expression.

"We lost one black magician, but it can't be helped. We can't take a monster into the 20th round."

Having personally killed Heo Tae-seok, Ryu Min glanced at Eom Jun-seok.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes... thank you for saving me."

Nodding once, Ryu Min passed by Eom Jun-seok and stopped in front of Victor.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes... but Sophia..."

Upon seeing Victor's despairing face, Ryu Min instantly realized.

"There seems to be no potion for the created life."

Life potions are undoubtedly legendary items.

As challenging as resurrecting a person, the ingredients are extremely demanding.

Currently, with the round nearing its end, obtaining the ingredients is no easy task.

"I should have procured the ingredients for Victor to make the potion..."

It seemed he had been too neglectful, thinking Victor, who survived until round 18 without his assistance, could manage on his own.

"He might need my help."

Ryu Min glanced briefly at Heo Tae-seok before looking at Sophia.

She was in a state of instant death, pierced through the heart.

It seemed impossible to revive her without resurrection.

"Black Scythe. It's shameless, but can I ask for one favor?"

"Try asking."

"With Black Scythe's fast movement ability, could you please bring Krisi here? Bring her and ask her to resurrect Sophia. I beg you."

"It hasn't been ten minutes yet."

"Yes, so we need to hurry..."

Ryu Min decisively shook his head.

"That's impossible. Even I can't round-trip a distance of 5 km in just ten minutes."

The distance with Krisi, who appeared on the tracking list, was 5 km.

It was not a distance that could be covered in time.

"Ah, huk..."

Despair appeared on Victor's face, but Ryu Min's words were not over yet.

"However, it doesn't mean there's no way."

Ryu Min took out the legendary potion selection box received as a reward for killing 1,000 demons in a previous sub-quest.

Fortunately, it had not been used yet.

"Use."

[Please touch the desired potion among the following.]

└ 1. Life Potion

└ 2. Potion of Rapid Regeneration

└ 3. Potion of Indomitable Resistance

└ 4. Memory Erasure Potion

└ 5. Potion of Immunity

Without hesitation, Ryu Min chose number 1.

Upon doing so, a Life Potion materialized in his hand.

"This should do it."

Saying that, he used the potion towards Sophia.

As if rewinding time, her pierced heart was restored, and color returned to Sophia's face.

"Ah..."
ChatGPT

Victor's eyes widened in amazement as he faced the miracle, and Sophia also raised her eyelids with a gasp.

"Wh-where is this...?"

"Sophia!"

Seeing Victor embrace Sophia, she wrinkled her forehead in arrogance.

"It hurts, Oppa!"

"Ah! S-sorry. Are you okay now? Are you not in pain?"

"I'm not in pain... What happened? I should have died for sure..."

Sophia, with memories of just before her death, lowered her head.

The blood staining her chest proved her death.

"Black Scythe saved me with a potion."

"Black Scythe?"

Sophia's gaze first turned towards Black Scythe and then towards Heo Tae-seok.

Although she had no memory after death, she guessed the situation.

Black Scythe appeared, explained the situation, and resurrected her.

"Thank you for saving me, Black Scythe. How can I repay this favor?"

"There's no need to repay. I only helped because the situation required it."

Although he humbly refused, Sophia's eyes still sparkled.

"How can I just pass by after saving a person's life? If you need any help, please tell me. I want to repay as much as my life owes."

"It's really okay. If you stay with us as a comrade, that's enough."

Despite Ryu Min's repeated refusals, Sophia's eyes continued to gleam.

"Saving a human life, how can I just ignore that? If you need help, please tell us anything. We want to repay the debt of a saved life."

"It's really fine. I've looked after my comrades again."

Ryu Min, who declined once more, looked around at his comrades.

Alex seemed to be okay now, soothing his neck, and Eom Jun-seok was staring blankly at Heo Tae-seok's body.

"The situation has been sorted out. But..."

It can't be left as it is that Plutox intervened.

He might target his comrades just like this.

"As long as we don't know what Plutox's main body looks like, tracking is impossible. In that case..."

The only option is to track the surrounding comrades.

Since he's aiming for Ryu Min's closest associate.

Ryu Min scanned the tracking list with a serious look.

"As of now, the closest place is where Min Ju-ri is."

Although they met a little while ago, demons could have arrived during that time.

"Listen, everyone."

Victor, Sophia, Alex, and Eom Jun-seok paid attention to Ryu Min's words.

"We don't know if demons intervened in this round. It's speculated that Heo Tae-seok's transformation is also for that reason."
ChatGPT

"Ah, demons?"

"Why?"

Ryu Min knew the reason, but he shook his head horizontally.

It wouldn't be good to openly admit that it was because of him.

"I don't know. Just gathering together and moving like this might be safer."

With those words, Ryu Min instructed everyone to gather at the Twin Canyon.

"Others were told to gather there too, so please hurry."

"Understood."

"What about Black Scythe?"

"I..."

Ryu Min turned his head and looked in the direction where Min Ju-ri was.

"I need to check if my comrades are in danger."

With those words, Ryu Min's figure vanished like the wind.

Yamti's mission from the master was simple.

Find Min Ju-ri and protect her when the round begins.

It was an easy task, but as soon as it started, curses were inevitable.

"Darn it, the distance is over 8 km!"

Unfortunately, their starting locations were far from each other, and it took a whole hour to finally reach Min Ju-ri's location.

And in addition to that, the master gave Yamti a mission to mediate and prevent Min Ju-ri and Seo Arin from fighting.

"Sigh."

The only thing Yamti could do was barely endure the curses.

"So, I confessed, but he rejected me, right?"

"It's not a rejection, he just opened up an opportunity."

"He drew the line as friends, and you call that an opportunity? You're clinging to the rejection in a pitiful way."

"What are you saying? Why are you being so...!"

"Ugh, seriously! Can't you two just shut your mouths?"

Frustrated Yamti vented her temper, and Min Ju-ri and Seo Arin didn't open their mouths anymore.

They just turned their heads, snorting as if to show off.

"Ugh... I'm lucky to be the older sister. This... is..."

If they were younger, would the two have heard her words through their backs?

It's fortunate to have been born a bit earlier.

At that moment, the now-familiar death message appeared, and the cold atmosphere turned awkwardly solemn.

"It's already the twentieth death."

"That's right. Are they really killing each other?"

"If not that, then what else could it be?"
ChatGPT

The three exchanged a few words, wearing expressions that indicated familiarity.

Throughout their walk from the forest to the plains, the only thing they saw was the death notification window. They prided themselves on not being surprised by any notifications, but that was just a misconception.

So far, only unfamiliar nicknames had come up, but this time, the name of a familiar comrade appeared clearly. Moreover, it was a name they had seen all along.

"Oh? If it's 'No Waste,'..."

"The leader of the Death Cult, right?"

Until now, only unfamiliar nicknames had come to mind, but this time, the name of a comrade they knew well emerged. Moreover, it was a name they had been seeing for a long time.

"Ho, the leader died..."

"If it's in the notification, it means he can't be resurrected..."

"Sigh... How did this happen?"

A sigh escaped from the mouths of the three in sorrow. It was a sigh made possible by not knowing the exact circumstances.

"What could have happened? If it's the leader's skills, he wouldn't have been defeated by monsters..."

"He could have been. If three ogres attacked simultaneously, it might be hard to handle, right?"

"I can handle it. You've seen how strong my Soul Knight is."

"Again, they're starting to fight again!"

When signs of bickering began to show, Yamti reacted nervously.

"Isn't it time to reconcile?"

"I don't know, Unni. You know what it's like to compete for someone you like."

In response to Min Ju-ri's words, Yamti forced a dry laugh.

"What do you mean I don't know? Who has been holding back so far?"

"What does that mean? Do you, Yamti, also...?"

Suspicious eyes from Min Ju-ri made Yamti blame her own mouth.

'Anyway, it's a loose tongue!'

She said that slaves naturally adore their owners, but it seemed she was pouring oil on the fire for no reason.

"When will you stop fighting? It's time to make up."

"I don't know, Unni. You don't know what it's like to compete for someone you like."

In response to Min Ju-ri's words, Yamti let out a forced laughter.

"What do you mean I don't know? Who has been holding back so far?"

Upon hearing that, Min Ju-ri felt relieved, but instead, Yamti had to endure the reproachful gaze of Seo Ah-rin.

-Shouldn't a slave avoid liking their owner?

Judging by Seo Ah-rin's expression, it seemed like she was protesting against it.

It wasn't that Yamti liked her owner, but Seo Ah-rin knew that Yamti was a slave.

To escape jealousy, Yamti quickly changed the subject.

"I'm talking about camaraderie. Don't misunderstand. I just like him as a comrade, that's what I mean. Haha."

"Oh, I see."

"Got it."

Only then did Yamti feel the wrinkles forming on her forehead as she looked at the relieved Seo Ah-rin and Min Ju-ri.

"Oh, really, the moment when curses are about to come out."

Yamti, who bit her tongue, looked ahead.

The journey towards the Twin Gorge should not have felt this long.

"Hmm?"

However, as Yamti looked ahead, she spotted a person.

"Strange? The closest player is 800m away?"

But the distance to the figure in front was only 50m.

Yamti and Min Ju-ri witnessed it as well, making sure that their eyes were not mistaken.

"Hey, isn't that a person?"

"Indeed?"

When the distance decreased from 50m to 30m, the three simultaneously stopped walking, as if they had made a promise.

The figure was undoubtedly human, but they realized it was not a human.

"Oh, a demon...?"

As Min Ju-ri mumbled, a demon popped out from the side.

"Eek!"

Surprised, they stepped back, and the demon, amused by their reaction, chuckled.

"Hehe, timely prey has rolled in." "That's right." "All three are human females." "Lucky for the first hunt."

Amidst the demonic voices heard from all directions, the three didn't even think about fleeing.

It turned out the demon was not alone.
