Title: Episode 291 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

The Curse of Immortality

"Oh no!"

It was a fleeting moment, but Artaros sensed his impending death.

Of course, death was a distant concept for him, as he was under the curse of immortality.

However, just before facing death, a look of bewilderment crossed Artaros's face.

After all, there was a penalty even for resurrection.

Swish!

The blade that had been heading towards the black scythe pierced Artaros's neck.

The backlash of his decisive blow returned to him.

In this way, Artaros died.

Yet, Ryumin couldn't help but feel tense.

"He's not dead."

Even though his throat was pierced, Artaros continued to move.

A truly eerie sight.

Swoosh!

As the radiant sword was pulled out of his neck, the hole seemed to fill as if it had never happened.

"This... took quite a hit. I didn't expect reflex abilities."

Artaros reproached himself, shaking his head.

"Thanks to that, I lost my life twice. I also received a 10% decrease in stats penalty."

The curse of immortality meant that he resurrected without penalties when he died for the first time.

However, if he lost his life within one hour again, he would face penalties.

A penalty that reduced all stats by 10%.

It was a continuous decrease if he died repeatedly.

Although it was a temporary debuff, it would recover over time. The problem was not the stats.

Every time he resurrected, a piece of his soul was devoured.

That's why it was a curse.

"I can't kill him, but I can make him face penalties. Is that the idea?"

Ryumin, who had gathered all that information by reading his opponent's thoughts, saw hope in this battle.

However, he didn't become arrogant.

Even with a 90% decrease in stats from the usual, Artaros was still powerful.

He seemed to know that, as there was no tension in his expression.

"If you thought you could kill me with this level of strength, you made a mistake."

"I know. Killing you once won't solve the problem."
ChatGPT

"To lower his stats, I need to kill him several more times right away."

If he keeps dying consecutively, the stat penalties will accumulate, making it easier to kill him gradually.

To achieve that, Ryumin raised his scythe again.

"Are you planning to keep rushing in?"

"Silence is golden. Now that he's weakened, how can I let this opportunity pass?"

"Foolish. You just missed a chance to die gracefully."

"Well, then, will the mighty god who has been watching over me finally protect me now?"

Instead of answering, Artaros raised his sword.

He was contemplating using the skill he had used earlier, [Radiance of Annihilation].

"Since it has come to this, I can't retreat. I'll use all my strength to kill you."

Artaros truly exerted all his power.

A brilliant radiance emanated from his sword.

The intensity of the light emitted was so strong that it was difficult even to open one's eyes.

In such a situation, using an unavoidable wide-range technique.

It was truly an untenable situation.

"But what if I charge right now?"

Calculating the distance between himself and the opponent, considering the speed, Ryumin realized he was a bit too far.

Before Ryumin's scythe could reach, the judgment was made that the light would burn his body first.

Then, Ryumin couldn't help but bring out his ultimate technique.

"Atone through death, foolish mortal."

The Radiance of Annihilation obscured the field of vision.

Whether it was wise or not, Ryumin rushed forward.

He closed the distance to kill Artaros.

But before that, the light touched Ryumin's flesh.

Hair burnt, skin tissues peeled away, and bones were exposed.

As he got closer to the light, his body melted like ice cream.

Even with an 80% damage reduction, it was still this intense.

He could feel the vastly different damage from before throughout his entire body.

However, Ryumin didn't rush forward without any thought, like a moth into the flame.

"It has been confirmed that you are the first player to achieve the maximum level. Congratulations!" [Acquired the title 'Max Level.'] [As a reward for achieving the maximum level, received the 'Rune of Growth.'] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!] [In celebration of reaching the max level, all health is restored, and enters a 1-minute invincible state.]

1 minute of invincibility.

A temporarily unattainable buff effect.

It's just a buff that's regrettable to pass by after reaching the max level.

The reason Ryumin had postponed reaching the max level was here.

One minute of invincibility could be considered quite a long time.

Against the enemies, that is.

[...!?]

Seeing Ryumin, whose burning skin cleanly regenerated and was enveloped in a radiant light of invincibility, Artaros wore a surprised expression.

"Max level effect...?"

He knew that effect as well, but without experience points now, he never thought he would reach the max level.

Whoosh-!

Swinging the scythe after piercing through the Radiance of Annihilation, Ryumin sent Artaros' body flying in two directions.

However, as if nothing had happened, his body stuck back together, and he returned in a neat, unharmed appearance.

But both Ryumin and Artaros knew that something had changed.

"Stats have decreased by another 10%?"

[... ]

"In that case, considering it as a multiplication operation, your stats have become 81% compared to before."

"What are you trying to say?"

"Now, you have only one minute left to take a beating, you bastard."

Simultaneously, as Ryumin swung the scythe, Artaros reflexively tried to block it.

No, he tried to block it.

Clang-!

With one arm severed, Artaros became one-armed, and another attack was launched against him.

Clang- Clang-!

He was blocking, but it was strenuous.

It was clearly different from before.

A little surprised, but Artaros, who did not show it, attempted to counterattack.

Whether he liked it or not, Ryumin had no intention of blocking.

Why would he block when he's under invincibility?

Ting-!

As his sword bounced off under the invincibility, Artaros was bewildered.
ChatGPT

Whether surprised or not, Ryumin thrust the scythe into Artaros's heart.

Thud!

Artaros, who lost his life in an instant, regained consciousness once again.

He resurrected once more and would continue to do so in the future, but his expression now showed bewilderment, unlike before.

"This isn't good."

His overall stats had decreased again.

Now, it was challenging to block the attacks of the Black Scythe, especially when they turned into one-sided attacks.

Thud, thud, thud.

His neck was severed, his head pierced, and his heart penetrated.

In this way, Artaros died five times within 50 seconds.

His stats had dropped below half.

"It has dropped a lot, but it's still manageable. Let's endure for just 10 more seconds."

Then, the opponent's invincibility will end.

If he could endure just 10 seconds, it would be his turn for a counterattack.

"My stats have dropped seven times, but it's okay. If I use [Burning Radiance] once more and raise my stats by 50%..."

He thought he could somehow manage to deal with the situation.

When the 10 seconds passed, and the golden light surrounding Ryumin's body disappeared as if washed away.

Artaros used [Burning Radiance] for a counterattack.

All of his stats increased by 50%, and vitality surged.

"Even during your invincibility, you might have felt proud that you killed me, but that ends here......"

Artaros stopped talking mid-sentence.

A change occurred in the opponent's body.

The fluctuating black energy felt different from before.

"Oh, this? The cooldown for the Reaper transformation is back."

[... ]

"Why? Did you think only you had buffs? I have them too."

Before the words could finish, Ryumin's scythe flashed like a shooting star.

Before Artaros could respond, his neck dropped once again.

As his neck reattached, Ryumin muttered.

"You have a curse that you can't die? You keep resurrecting? Then, I'll keep killing you. Forever, until it gets boring."

Ryumin was desperate to kill his opponent.

He was a formidable opponent, and the opponent showed a vulnerability.

Now or never, it was the opportunity.

That's why he poured all his strength into it at this moment.

Using the Reaper transformation made it easy, just like facing a child.

Thud, thud, thud!
ChatGPT

After severing the limbs, Ryumin used a newly learned skill for the finishing move.

"Sentencing to Death."

Puff!

As soon as he cast the skill, a fountain of crimson blood spewed out, instantly killing Artaros.

Despite the gruesome death, he resurrected tirelessly.

Of course, during the approximately 3-second resurrection time, Ryumin couldn't interfere.

Until Artaros's body was fully restored, attacks with the scythe were ineffective, as if reaching a different dimension.

However, such obstacles didn't bother Ryumin.

After waiting for three seconds, he could kill again.

"How many times have you died now? About 30 times?"

[... ]

"How does it feel to die right after resurrecting? How much did your stats drop? I'm curious. Oh, sorry. I didn't give you time to speak."

Ryumin casually cleaned his scythe, which he had intended to swing.

"If you have something to say, say it."

[...There's no stat system for gods. The system was created only for the convenience of players.]

"Anyway, how much did you drop? According to my calculation, it's about 4% compared to before, right?"

Lost 96% of his strength, leaving only 4%?

For Ryumin, it was practically a piece of cake, like eating cold rice.

Well, even at that level, he would play with other players easily.

[If you want to mock, mock to your heart's content. If that brings you comfort.]

"What's this? Giving up already? Don't you have any desire to live?"

[Begging for mercy is in vain. I have no intention of pitifully begging for my life.]

"Oh, really?"

Ryumin read what the opponent was thinking.

The entity that appeared to kill him under the instructions of the higher-ups wouldn't give up so easily.

There was definitely something fishy.

'Huh?'

With that thought, Ryumin couldn't help but be quite surprised.

Artaros's tactic was a method he hadn't thought of himself.

[Such a fool.]

Suddenly, Artaros's eyes turned violet.

[Granting you the time to converse with me is your fatal mistake. I only needed a momentary time.]

Ryumin's body, meeting Artaros's gaze, froze as if his soul had left.

In the quiet flow of time, as if time had stopped, only Artaros's lips moved.
ChatGPT

[To push me this far, commendable. Black Scythe. However, you are an inconvenient existence for the gods. You shouldn't spoil the gods' only joy.]

Artaros placed his hand on Ryumin's head.

He wished to crush him completely, but in the slowed time, his options were limited.

[Killing would be the best, but it seems impossible in my current state. So, let's erase your memories. Forget all the abilities, relationships, and hardships you've had so far. Naturally, you'll be eliminated from the game.]

Unable to kill, Artaros had no choice but to do this.

[Then, your soul awaits its arrival in the afterlife. Hoo... I don't know what to say to Lord Nyx.]

Muttering, Artaros, dragging his weary body, disappeared beyond space.

In the darkened Demon King's Castle.

Only one person lay there.

"Ugh, wh-where is this...?"

Ryumin, regaining consciousness, raised his upper body and looked around.

Nothing was visible, but the real issue was the throbbing headache.

"Ugh, damn... What happened?"

He glanced around, but there was no one.

Phlunictos and Artaros seemed to have gone somewhere.

"That Artaros jerk tried to erase my memories."

Ryumin remembered everything that happened a while ago.

Everything he said after freezing time.

It was all thanks to the Rune of Memory obtained after defeating the dragon.

"With lowered stats, he couldn't kill me, so he tried to erase my memories while time was stopped. And then he released the timeless space?"

The attempt was good, but the guy didn't know.

The Rune of Memory left his memories intact.

Moreover, he remembered the words spoken when time stopped.

"No, was it an extreme slowdown of time?"

Even in the slowed time, Ryumin's ears were wide open.

So he could hear every word Artaros muttered.

"He mentioned a god named Nyx at the end."

Perhaps that guy was the mastermind behind ordering him to be killed.

"The number of gods who want me dead just increased by one."

A chilly smile formed on Ryumin's lips.
