Title: "Episode 175 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max-Level Player"

"Thousand-Mile Vision"

The long-awaited 11th round had begun, but Christine was feeling melancholic.

Perhaps this round might be the last of her life.

"Don't worry. I have the dominance."

As a Priest, she possessed absolute authority known as dominance.

She could use it to fend off anyone attempting to surprise attack her.

However, how could she, with not particularly strong combat power, become the representative of the area?

The reason was the people gathering around her.

"Have you arrived, Sir Berber?"

"Hello, Christine."

"Lupang, greetings."

"I'm honored to meet you, Christine."

Players approached with tracking skills, greeting her.

They were comrades and party members who had been together since the 2nd round.

They were also followers of the only soldier class, the Priest.

"With them, there's nothing to fear."

The rune Christine obtained in commemoration of her Priest promotion was the "Rune of Life."

Whether healing people or saving lives, it was a rune that earned experience points and stats, forcing her to help others, whether she liked it or not.

"But thanks to that, so many people gathered around me."

Voluntarily helping people earned her trust.

Who would refuse free healing from someone?

It's not like she was stealing from monsters.

"Even though I used healing to raise experience points and stats, they don't need to know that."

To others, it might feel like volunteering for free, like a Nightingale.

The fact that she could become the area representative was also due to highlighting her unique role as the only healer.

"At first, even the hesitant voters believed in me. Heard praises for choosing a great representative."

Thanks to this, she maintained the position of the representative and gathered many followers, carrying the title of a saint from the 2nd round until now.

Relying on each other, they overcame many difficulties.

"I'll resolve it again this time, no matter what obstacles come our way."

Unnoticed, around 100 people had gathered by Christine's side.

Sturdy human shields surrounded Christine.

"As long as they are by my side, there's no need to worry about a surprise attack."

She felt relieved, but she couldn't let her guard down.

Since she didn't know who might launch a surprise attack, she remained vigilant, eyes wide open like a meerkat.

"Are you okay, Chris? You seem more tense than usual today."

"I'm fine. Thanks for your concern, Douglas."

"If anything happens, please let me know. As the right arm of the saint, I'm a Paladin, right? I will definitely protect you."

"Haha, that's reassuring."

Christine smiled, but she didn't neglect her surroundings.

Even with her detection skills, there was no problem if someone approached invisibly.

As she briefly thought about assassins, Jeffrey from another area crossed her mind.

"Threatening to kill a powerless prophet for my sake... disappointing."

Now that the areas were unified, they might meet, but she decided to forget about it.

She knew his nickname but chose not to customize her face.

She didn't want to make an effort to find him.

"Come to think of it, with the country unified, I might meet the prophet and Makyungrok."

Although she wasn't close to the prophet, could she trust Makyungrok, her fianc√©?

At least he seemed better than Jeffrey, having competed for the 2nd and 3rd rankings in the entire area.

"Maybe he's the prince on a white horse who saved me..."

She shouldn't get her hopes up, but she was genuinely curious about the person who saved her.

"Now that the explanation is over, I'll transport you all to the fantasy world."

Listening to the angel's words, it seemed like the real adventure was about to begin.

"I will definitely survive."

She already knew the strategy for the 11th round from the prophet.

Survival was more crucial than immediate strategies.

"I have confidence. With these people..."

Christine flashed a confident smile.

Until the angel chuckled and spoke.

"Oh, by the way, just to let you know, the starting locations will be randomly assigned. Well then, good luck."

"Huh? Random?"

Before she could be surprised, a bright light flashed and disappeared.

In Christine's blinking eyes, a dense forest appeared instead of the meadow.

"Wh-where is this?"
ChatGPT

She was curious about where she was, but more than anything, she was perplexed.

Everyone around her had disappeared without a trace.

"Ah...."

The confidence she had moments ago faded, leaving her momentarily disoriented. However, she quickly regained composure and used her exploration skills to survey the surroundings.

"Oh? There's someone nearby."

A red dot appeared close by, and without hesitation, she approached.

Whether it was an enemy or an ally, her profession, which couldn't do much alone, required cooperation.

"Oh? Douglas?"

"Chris!"

Fortunately, the person nearby was the Paladin, Douglas, whom she had separated from a while ago.

"I was bewildered since we all got separated, but meeting Chris here! It must be fate!"

"Haha, seems like it."

Christine let out a relieved laugh.

"I was worried about meeting strangers, but luckily..."

She could trust Douglas, one of the initial members since the 2nd round.

"Berber is also nearby."

"Oh, really?"

"He said he'd do a quick exploration, so he left his spot empty. He'll be back soon."

Using her exploration skill confirmed that there was indeed movement nearby.

Berber returned shortly and, upon seeing Christine, reflected with surprise.

"Oh? Chris, were you here too?"

"Yes. Nice to see you, Berber."

"What a coincidence! It's fortunate that Chris is here. Now we don't have to worry about dying."

"Haha, yes..."

She didn't ask for permission to join them, but it was natural for Douglas and Berber to stand by Christine, as if it were expected.

"Well, it should be fine. I find it difficult alone."

Having two reliable companions brought her peace of mind.

It was less than having 100 people, but still.

"Since we have plenty of time, shall we wait here and put the quests on hold? Other people might come looking for Chris, right?"

"That's a good idea. Let's wait here for a while. Surely, those who scattered will come to track Chris."

"Um, then let's wait a bit?"

Although waiting was a bit boring, Christine preferred moving with a group rather than being alone.

Efficiency aside, it was much safer that way.

However, she didn't know yet.
ChatGPT

The moment she said she would wait, someone behind her flashed a sinister smile.

A deserted alley.

A man wielding a scythe appeared without a sound.

'Where am I?'

Upon leaving the alley, Ryumin could resolve her doubts as she laid eyes on a peaceful Swedish-like village.

'It's the Kingdom of Albitz.'

Different from the clean and sacred Imperial Empire, it was a city that felt rugged but somehow serene.

'Why is the starting point different every time...'

Among the 67 rounds of experience in the 11th round, the number of duplicate starting locations was negligible. Wasn't it obvious since it was random?

'Then why did the random rune fragments I received initially always produce the same rune?'

Even with the randomness, some things were different each round, while others were consistently the same. In that aspect, understanding the system was difficult.

'It doesn't really matter. Albitz Kingdom is not bad. I might even prefer it.'

The destination Ryumin set for her first quest was the Maze Forest.

Fortunately, it wasn't far from the Kingdom of Albitz.

'Before that, should I check the locations of people using Thousand-Mile Vision?'

In Ryumin's skill window, there was a skill received as a special reward from the previous round.

[Temporary Skill - Thousand-Mile Vision]

Effect: Memorize the activation chant, close your eyes, virtual eyes appear, allowing you to see through the perspective of a third party.

In this state, by recalling the nickname and face of the player you want to see, you can immediately shift your perspective.

'Thousand-Mile Vision.'

Closing her eyes and using the skill, she saw her own figure.

In the third-person mode, Ryumin recalled one person.

'Minju.'

As the perspective shifted, Minju's appearance appeared before her eyes.

'Minju ended up in the Sacred Empire.'

She was quite a distance away.

Meeting her seemed challenging.

'Yamti.'

Recalling the nickname and face, the perspective immediately shifted above Yamti's head.

'He's also in the Sacred Empire. Well, it doesn't matter for this round.'

Considering the distance, it wouldn't work to collaborate if they were close.

Eventually, she recalled Seo Arin, Heo Taeseok, Makyungrok, and An Sangcheol one by one to check their locations.

It wasn't merely out of curiosity about where they were.
ChatGPT

To read their locations and actions, it was to determine whether they would become variables in this round.

Perhaps entering the Maze Forest might be hindered because of those guys.

"Seo Arin and Heo Taeseok are far away, so no need to worry, but Makyungrok and An Sangcheol are nearby."

Not only were they close, but they were also contemplating tracking the black scythe.

How did she know?

Because she could read their thoughts through Thousand-Mile Vision.

"Thousand-Mile Vision is another version of myself. The rune of inner thoughts is also applicable in Thousand-Mile Vision's perspective."

She didn't choose Thousand-Mile Vision in vain, giving up on the point buff. It was chosen because it made it easy to read the opponent's inner thoughts remotely and prepare in advance.

"Makyungrok and An Sangcheol intend to come to me. They are close by, and if they stick to me, they might gain something."

It worked out well. Anyway, Ryumin had business with Makyungrok this round.

"He plans to commit atrocities by slaughtering players from other countries this round. I need to take precautions in advance."

Next, she checked the location of Jeffrey, who was dominated by Yamti.

As expected, he was too far away to be useful.

"Is Joo Sungtak coming along well?"

Due to the duel, she had given Joo Sungtak, turned slave, a single instruction: find her, the black scythe, no matter where he landed.

Tracking the black scythe's face wasn't a problem since she already knew it before he became a slave.

Seems like she observed him even from a distant place.

"Fortunately, he's coming along well."

Watching Joo Sungtak running towards her, Ryumin smirked.

To obtain items in the Maze Forest, Joo Sungtak's help was crucial.

Lastly, Ryumin turned her perspective to Christine.

The nickname was known, and the customized face was familiar from past encounters, so finding her wasn't difficult.

"They're already in contact with two people."

Christine was with two individuals who seemed to be her followers.

It seemed like their starting points were coincidentally close.

However, she couldn't be complacent.

"The reason Christine said it's dangerous is because of those guys."

Now revealed, the enemies threatening Christine were members of a cult called 'Despair Sect.'

The leader of the Despair Sect was the only sorcerer in the United States, John Delgado.
ChatGPT

Under his leadership, the Despair Sect aims to kill Christine.

"Reading their thoughts, one of them is from the Despair Sect, and the other is a conspirator betraying with him."

It's unbelievable that the most trustworthy ones are spies and traitors.

In the 11th round, Christine has no choice but to die for this reason.

"Things might change if I step in."

While she knows who the enemies are, there's no need to intervene right now.

The order to kill hasn't been given yet, and the actions will progress after the Despair Sect's forces gather to a certain extent.

"There is still time."

During this time, Ryumin plans to proceed with quests alongside Joo Sungtak.

There was an item she must obtain in the Maze Forest.

It was an item that deceives nicknames.
