Title: Regression of the Level Max Player - Episode 223

Full Preparation

When Ryu Min saw the Archangels who came to kill him, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.

'To have Archangels appear before applying the Devil's Blessing.'

Before capturing an angel, one must apply the Devil's Blessing to receive substantial rewards proportional to their stats.

Ironically, to apply the Devil's Blessing, one must capture 100 angels.

'The current count is only one, Sariel, captured last time.'

99 more angels need to be captured to use the blessing.

'Without the blessing, defeating Archangels won't yield rewards worth even the size of an ant's toenail.'

In a situation where an angel is needed as a sacrifice before killing an Archangel.

'What should I do?'

After a brief contemplation, the answer he came up with was surprisingly simple.

Make the Archangels call for reinforcements while adjusting their skills to feel evenly matched.

'They won't even think about calling for reinforcements if I overwhelm them. Or, on the contrary, they might call another Archangel.'

It would be troublesome if another Archangel appeared.

What Ryu Min needed were sacrificial beings to stack up.

'I need to match their skills as closely as possible. If I have slightly more forces, I can win.'

It was crucial to induce thoughts that he could win if played well.

Just like enticing fish with bait.

'I should act a bit. Deliberately let myself get hit even when I can avoid it.'

Knowing that it would explode upon contact with the Explosive Dagger, he pretended not to know and touched it.

He acted as if the Light Prison, which could have been easily destroyed at once, trapped him completely after being hit several times.

'Luckily, they fell for it. With both of us cooperating, we should be able to win easily.'

But if he just endured without fighting back, they wouldn't support him.

He had to show a temporarily strengthened appearance, and the means he used for that was the Demonization.

'At first, act as if you're falling behind, then use Demonization and dominate as if to prove something. And when Demonization ends? Act surprised and pretend to withdraw immediately.'

In doing so, it could buy time for the angels to call for reinforcements and provide an opportunity to escape.

'Unless they're complete fools, even the angels will understand. My appearance turned dark, and I became stronger.'

It might be disappointing for the angels.

To have missed a chance against an opponent with a chance of winning right before their eyes.

'They won't be able to chase me since I damaged their wings, but they might call for reinforcements. They can't call another Archangel either, given that their honor seems to be at stake in this mission.'

Moreover, they are proud beings.

If possible, they would try to handle it themselves without relying on the power of the Archangels.

There was a high chance of summoning combat angels that could be used in various ways.

'I hope to summon as many combat angels as possible... No, at least 99.'

It is unknown how many they will request support, but what is certain is that preparations must be complete during the cooldown of the demonization.

'In order to capture the angels and apply the Devil's Blessing, I need to maximize my stats.'

There is quite a bit to do in the remaining 44 minutes.

Potions need to be consumed, and various buffs need to be applied.

'I need to find the three individuals.'

Ryu Min, with spread wings, crossed the sky.

The first person he visited was Min Ju-ri.

Since the Bless Buff received at the start of the round had ended.

"Black Reaper?"

Min Ju-ri, with a surprised rabbit-like expression, greeted Ryu Min's unexpected appearance.

"What were you doing?"

"Oh, I just finished a delivery quest a little while ago."

As instructed, Min Ju-ri was doing quests in the Holy Empire.

Donate to the temple.

Run errands for the priest.

Subdue monsters nearby and obtain holy water.

Donate to the temple again.

Completing these four consecutive quests could greatly raise her reputation.

It seemed simple but was a task that would take at least six hours.

"You're doing well. Is it time to go subdue monsters now?"

"Yes. I'm not sure if I can handle it alone, though..."

"You have the cheating skill called Bless, so it should be enough. Don't worry."

"Thank you. By the way, what brings you here?"

"The effect of the cheating skill I just mentioned has worn off."

In short, it was a visit to receive buffs.

It was natural to request buffs from a buffer, but Min Ju-ri was secretly surprised.

Until now, Black Reaper had rarely directly requested buffs from her.

'Wha- Black Reaper needs my help...'

Min Ju-ri's jaw dropped at the thought of him coming all the way just to receive a single buff.

"Are you going to give or just talk?"

"Oh, get a grip on yourself. I'm sorry. Of course, I'll give them!"

[The effect of the skill Bless increases all stats by 80%.] [The effect of the skill Swift increases attack and movement speed by 80%.] [The skill Safety Barrier is activated.] [You can receive protection twice against physical attacks.]

"I've applied a three-piece set. Hehe."

"Thanks."

Min Ju-ri, who automatically applied useful buffs without being told, was indeed handy.

Fluttering-

When Ryu Min spread the wings of darkness behind him, Min Ju-ri was surprised.

"Is that a skill I haven't seen before?"

"It's something that happened recently. Well then, I'm busy, so I'll go first. Work hard on your quests."

"Thank you for the support, Black Reaper. Take care!"

Ryu Min's body soared into the distance.

The second place he arrived at was the city of dwarves, Iron Grey.

It was none other than to meet Russell.

After about three hours of waiting, Russell was seen in front of the blacksmith's shop.

"Oh! Black Reaper!"

Ryu Min, who descended to the ground, asked calmly.

"Did you wait long?"

"No, not at all!"

"The reward?"

"Of course, I got it! Would you like to check it once?"

As Ryu Min nodded, Russell approached and placed his hands on the equipment.

[The effect of the skill 'Equipment Polish' increases the options of the armor by 20%.] [The buffs will last until the end of this round.]

'20% each?'

It had doubled from the previous 10%.

A satisfied smile appeared on Ryu Min's face.

It was worth coming back to receive buffs again.

"I'll also enhance other equipment while I'm at it. Including the weapon."

"Thanks."

Russell touched various parts, excluding accessories, applying buffs, strengthening each area significantly.

[The effect of the skill 'Weapon Polish' increases weapon attack power by 200%.] [The buffs will last until the end of this round.]

Not only equipment polishing but also weapon polishing has increased.

With just a three-hour quest, overall skills have been enhanced.

Not to mention the reputation for dwarves.

"How's the reputation?"

"It was neutral, but it skyrocketed to very friendly in an instant. It's all thanks to Black Reaper. Oh, and also to the prophet who arranged the relationship."

Seeing Russell smiling happily, it seems that the skills have been significantly improved.

"I'm glad you like it. Now, just work hard to level up."

"Thank you, Black Reaper. I'll do my best to be helpful in the future!"

"Don't forget that sentiment. Well then, I'm busy, so I'll go first."

Ryu Min spread his wings and slowly flew up.

After finding one more person, he plans to go to the angels.

'I hope they've called at least 99.'

Ryu Min quickly left the city.

The Forest of Demons was filled with unexpected angels.

They were 5th rank angels who appeared in response to the call of Uriel and Raguel.

[Uriel, how are your injuries?] [Almost healed. And you?]

Raguel turned his shoulder to show the torn part of his wings.

[Maybe it's because it's from another dimension, but the healing speed is slow. But the pain is gone.] [That's fortunate.] [Compared to the battle against the Demon Lord, these injuries are nothing. It's tough to flap wings right now, but once we return to the heavenly realm, complete recovery is possible.]

Angels can receive treatment at the 'Spring of Heaven.'

Even if limbs are severed, as long as they are still alive, they can restore their physical bodies to the point of creating anew.

[Darn it. That human called Black Reaper turned out to be unexpectedly strong. Do you admit it too?] [I admit it now. But that guy's rampage ends here. With this much military power, it will be difficult for him to handle.]

Raguel's gaze turned to the battle angels filling the Forest of Demons.

A total of 200 angels were each holding weapons and assuming an immobile posture.

[Indeed. If we join forces with the troops here, suppressing Black Reaper should be a piece of cake.] [What if that bug turns black?]

It was a question that couldn't be easily answered, so Uriel temporarily deferred his response.
ChatGPT

Carefully weighing the combat power of both sides and Black Reaper.

[Surely, it won't be easy if he turns black. It might be insufficient with just the two of us. However...]

Uriel's gaze turned to the soldiers.

'If there are 200 shield bearers, the possibility should be sufficient.'

He smiled subtly, hiding his true thoughts.

[With this level of military power, what is there to fear?] [That's right. We should be able to win now, shouldn't we?] [Of course. Still, in case of any unexpected situation, if Black Reaper turns black, let's deal with him immediately. It might be difficult to just suppress him.] [I'm glad to hear that. Hehe.]

Raguel earnestly hoped that Black Reaper would turn black.

It was a resolve to repay the humiliation from the insect with death.

[Now that all the troops have gathered, shall we go to kill Black Reaper, or rather, to suppress the bug?] [We should. I'm already preparing to track him.] [Yes.]

While Raguel was using an artifact with tracking capabilities, Uriel stepped forward in front of the soldiers standing like statues.

Listen. Even without me explaining who I am, you understand, right? The soldiers who received support requests must have seen my name first.

The angels didn't answer or nod their heads.

For them, who were 5th-rank, the Archangels were distant superiors.

In military terms, it was like a private standing in front of a two-star general.

Thank you for supporting more than expected. Your mission is simple. Assist me and Raguel in dealing with one human criminal causing chaos in the heavenly realm.

'A human criminal?'

'You called so many just to catch one?'

The weakness of humans was well-known in the heavenly realm.

Despite the surprise at the large-scale support request, the angels did not imagine that their mission would involve capturing a human.

[Do not underestimate it just because it's one person. Among humans, he belongs to the relatively strong faction.]

Even though they thought, 'How strong could he be?' no angels expressed it.

If the Archangels said so, it had to be true.

The angels' concern was only about gaining recognition and visibility in the eyes of the Archangels.

Just then, Uriel brought up a story that might interest them.

[If we successfully conclude this incident, I will promote each of you to the 4th rank. So, give your best for the mission. Understand?] [Yes!!!]

Their voices were filled with determination, and their expressions revealed a strong desire to tear apart and kill the human as soon as possible.

Uriel, who had been smiling satisfactorily while looking at the energetic soldiers, couldn't continue for long.

[U-Uriel, sir.]

Seeing the bewildered face of Raguel, he couldn't smile anymore.

[What's the matter? Did something happen to the tracking artifact?] [No. It's about Black Reaper.] [Why?] [It seems like he is closing in on our location.] [What?]

The one who was fleeing is coming toward them?

[Are you sure?] [I'm sure. The direction and distance are all pointing towards this place.] [Well, this is unexpected. Didn't we need to go find him?]

Uriel, who had been smiling, suddenly had a strategy in mind.

[Instead of that, let's dig a trap and wait. That way, we can finish it for sure. Estimated arrival time?] [3 minutes.] [That's enough. Tell the soldiers to hide behind the trees. Once the target arrives, signal them to ambush simultaneously.] [Hehe, understood.]

Raguel immediately gave the order, and the angels moved swiftly.

Seeing their actions, Uriel's smile returned.

'Come on, human. This time, you won't be able to escape.'
