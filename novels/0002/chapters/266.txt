Title: Episode 266 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player

Pabel

The explanation from Cobalt Blue was simple.

"Some foreigner was asking someone to be on their side."

"A foreigner? Who is it?"

"I don't know who it is. They should have a nickname."

"When and where did you hear that story?"

"I heard it by chance while leaving the island after the round ended. That's it."

There wasn't much information, but the content was unusual.

"I think that believer might be creating Pabel...."

Huh Tae-seok nodded at Cobalt Blue's opinion.

He had the same thought.

'Trying to divide the believers who should be on the same team.'

As the leader of the Sasin Church, he couldn't just sit still.

"That foreigner, would you recognize them if you saw their face?"

"Of course. I'm good at remembering people's faces."

As soon as he heard that, Huh Tae-seok opened a drawer and showed pictures of the believers' profiles.

"Look for it. Who is that foreigner."

Cobalt Blue, flipping through hundreds of profiles with the believers' information, suddenly pointed with his finger.

"It's this person!"

'This guy?'

Huh Tae-seok looked at the culprit with narrowed eyes, and a smirk formed at the corner of his mouth.

'Finally, a task worthy of helping the Black Scythe.'

This time, he would achieve remarkable results.

Desire welled up in Huh Tae-seok's eyes.

Life is a series of twists and turns.

Dorothy realized that fact early last year when an angel appeared.

"Every month, you humans must complete quests and survive. Until you clear Round 20."

At first, she thought it was a divine favor.

Even when she lost her sense of balance due to a traffic accident, once hailed as the youngest archer prodigy in the Netherlands.

So, even when she, as an archer, was experiencing a wingless fall, it was the string of life she stubbornly held onto.

But even that only lasted until now.

She thought it was a divine favor telling her to let go and peacefully end her life.

'But it wasn't.'

To her, who was plagued by a severe depression that could not be cured even with medication, there was no lingering attachment to the remaining life.

There were no expectations either.

But just when there seemed to be no definite way to die, an opportunity arose.

A newly acquired body through customization.

That body had no disabilities.

A complete sense of balance.

And her own robust physique transformed as she became a player.

It must have been from that moment.

The moment she began to harbor a faint hope in her life.

The moment when the downward curve of her life trajectory began to soar again.

[Genius Archer Dorothy, Revived in Round 16!] [The Divine Archer of the Netherlands. Her triumphant journey as a player.]

Genius archer, divine archer.

Dorothy's nicknames reclaimed in reality.

Although she couldn't resume her athlete's life due to fairness issues, Dorothy was satisfied.

Thanks to the Noun Shooter Rune she received upon obtaining the Archer class, she regained even greater archery skills than before.

'Why do people keep talking about algebra when I've come back to life...'

Dorothy, who was reading a knight's story, put down her phone.

Since she was already a well-known figure before becoming a player, her actions always drew the attention of the media.

So, it wasn't surprising when someone came to her house.

After all, her home address was already well-known.

Ding-dong-

'Is it another fan?'

Thinking she should casually greet and sign something, Dorothy widened her eyes as she opened the door of her mansion.

"Hello, is this the Gumeoni residence?"

Because the chubby man with a sheepish expression was looking at her.

"Oh, is your name Alex...?"

"You remember. You're Dorothy, right? I came unexpectedly, sorry about that."

"Um, come in first."

Dorothy led Alex to the sofa.

"Please sit here. Would you like something to drink?"

"No, thank you. I came suddenly, so I can't impose. I'll just state my business and leave."

Dorothy, sitting across from him, stared as if urging him to speak.

"I saw your skills when you were hunting monsters on the island. Your archery skills were quite outstanding. So, to get to the point, would you consider being a strength for me?"

"What does that mean? Please explain so I can understand."

"I'm suggesting that we work together as a team."

Rather than being surprised, Dorothy furrowed her brow.
ChatGPT

Coming personally to propose something, especially within the same Sasin Church, seemed not only inappropriate but also hinted at the formation of a faction or group.

Above all, there was no reason for her to join a separate team.

"I refuse. I won't see you off. Go back."

"Just a moment. Don't dismiss it and listen to me until the end."

Dorothy felt irritated as Alex persisted.

Although she intended to be more firm, the words that came out of Alex's mouth made Dorothy momentarily doubt her ears.

"What are you talking about? Is it for real?"

"Yes. Are you interested now?"

Surprised, Dorothy returned to a listening posture as if to say, "When did this happen?"

"Please explain in detail what you just said."

Alex Pearson.

The German man precisely identified by Cobalt Blue from the profile picture.

'Is this guy manipulating believers and forming factions?'

Huh Tae-seok, pondering on how to deal with this troublesome rat, pressed his own head.

'What a fool. To think about punishment already based on information that's not even certain.'

In his obsession to achieve results as the leader, he temporarily lost sight of the need to confirm if the information was accurate.

'It could be that Cobalt Blue misunderstood.'

To properly verify, Huh Tae-seok traced Alex's location.

Could something come out of tailing him?

With such expectations, he used the skill he learned at level 60, 'Demonization.'

His skin turned red, his body size increased by 30%, and horns protruded from his forehead.

Bat-like wings were attached to his back.

Despite the appearance, the skill not only increased damage by 20% but also allowed transparency and advanced flight.

Fluttering into the sky, Huh Tae-seok cautiously pursued.

Following the arrow, he unexpectedly found himself in the Netherlands.

'Why is Alex here?'

Although it was incomprehensible, that question faded momentarily.

The mystery was solved as soon as he saw Alex.

'He's with Dorothy?'

Dorothy and Alex were seen coming out of the mansion.

After exchanging friendly greetings, they parted ways.

Tracing Alex again, this time he headed to Nigeria.
ChatGPT

As he moved through the residential area of Lagos, he encountered an alchemist named Victor.

After conversing for more than 10 minutes inside, Victor came out with a smiling face, as expected.

'It looks suspicious no matter how you look at it.'

What reason could there be for traveling around the world to meet believers?

'Does he really want to form his own faction?'

He began to think that the rumors might be true.

Alex needed to be captured and interrogated immediately.

He also needed to report to the Black Scythe.

'No, not yet. It's too early.'

There wasn't enough evidence.

Moving after confirming more would still be timely.

Fluttering into the air, Huh Tae-seok turned his body for now.

He decided not to tell anyone about what he had just seen.

Identifying the traitor should be entirely his responsibility.

"Here."

The place Ryu Min and John Delgado visited with Gabriel and Raphael was none other than the location where the archangels were buried.

John, who revived the 1st-tier combat archangels before leaving the island, skillfully recited the spell.

"Arise."

As Gabriel and Raphael, now transformed into undead entities, rose from their bodies, Ryu Min, as if waiting, swiftly slit their throats.

Swoosh-!

[You have defeated the 7th-tier Archangel 'Gabriel'!] [Stat Points +101,963] [Gold +1,019,632,200] [Number of Angels Defeated: 23/100] [You have defeated the 7th-tier Archangel 'Raphael'!] [Stat Points +101,963] [Gold +1,019,632,200] [Number of Angels Defeated: 24/100]

Although it was only half of the reward, substantial stats and gold were obtained.

'I've seen all the benefits from this. I revived and killed the 1st-tier combat archangels before leaving the island.'

Now, even with just the Balance Rune applied, the basic stats were close to 500,000.

With various buffs, the stats could easily surpass 10 million.

"Good job, John."

"Thank you, Master."

"You can return now. Don't forget to follow me when I start tracing you in Round 17."

"Understood. I'll keep my distance and follow you."

Just like before, the last remaining archangel might appear in Round 17.

The current command was to prepare for that moment.

"Well then..."
ChatGPT

After John left, Ryu Min grabbed the Lamborghini parked nearby and raced down the road.

"Let's get home quickly. Who knows what might happen to my brother now."

Now, even the archangels were targeting his brother. Without the protection buff from the hero, Ryu Min couldn't help but feel uneasy.

Vroom, vroom-

With furious engine roars, Ryu Min arrived at the Lotte World Tower, the tallest building in Korea.

During the repair of his damaged house, he planned to stay at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Lotte Signiel, known for its excellent security and breathtaking views.

'Although it cost over 1 billion won for a month's stay, it's nothing compared to my assets.'

After parking his car, he took the elevator to the 89th floor, where his room was located.

Ding-

Despite the high cost, the view was truly magnificent.

"Hey, big brother's here?"

Entering the room, his brother, who was enjoying a hotel meal, smiled and spoke.

"Finish up here, bro. Come and try the food quickly."

"Got it. Let me shower first."

After a quick shower, Ryu Min entered the room and checked the quest window while drying his hair.

└ Defeat 7 Archangels
└ Current Number of Defeated Archangels (6/7)
└ Success Reward ▶ ????

'Now, if I defeat just one more, I'll get the reward.'

He didn't know what the reward would be, but he was excited about it.

Considering that he had to defeat a challenging quest of seven archangels, it was a hard quest.

'Well, it wasn't as difficult as I thought.'

Perhaps because the reward for the Blessing of the Demon was exceptional, Ryu Min's growth had exceeded his expectations for quite some time.

A momentum that seemed to pierce not only the sky but even the universe.

'I never knew I would become this strong.'

Now, even when meeting the supposedly strongest archangel, he had confidence that he wouldn't cower like before.

The current Ryu Min was different from the past.

'By the way, why didn't that guy, who used to appear when Round 16 ended, show up this time?'

Honestly, he expected the one considered the most powerful, aside from Gabriel and Raphael, to appear.

However, anticipating the next round, he didn't show up this time.

'Come on, show up for once. I won't freeze like in the 68th round.'
ChatGPT

Having dried his hair, Ryu Min, prompted by a sudden thought, opened the system window to check the rewards he had obtained.

[Yin and Yang Rune]

Effect: When delivering a mixed attack of physical and magical attributes, the damage is amplified by 2 times.

[Chain Rune]

Effect: Summon chains of light that can be used as weapons. The chains have infinite durability and can be used with additional effects.

└ Restraint ▶ Summon additional chains to completely bind the enemy's limbs.

└ Sever ▶ Use sacred power to temper the chains and sever the opponent. Note: The caster may also suffer damage, so be cautious.

[Knight's Revival Rune]

Effect: When subjected to an attack leading to death, it can reflect the attack once. Upon attack reflection, it has a cooldown of 720 hours.

"Not bad effects."

He was already aware of the Yin and Yang Rune's effect, but the other runes were unknown as they were obtained from defeating the archangels.

"Come to think of it, there's also something called Refined Ether."

Ryu Min opened the information window of the item to check what it was.

His eyes, which initially saw it as insignificant, widened shortly after.
