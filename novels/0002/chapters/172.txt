Title: Episode 172 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Meal

"Yamti-nim, is it not you?"

In response to Seo Arin's question, Yamti was quite surprised.

'I changed my face, how did they recognize me?'

Even though she customized her appearance, someone was able to recognize her.

It seemed that she didn't change it much.

"Right? Yamti-nim."

"..."

Yamti neither affirmed nor denied, just glanced at Ryumin without expressing any positivity or negativity.

However, as if there was no need to read the atmosphere, Ryumin intervened.

"Oh? Are you two acquainted?"

"We met in another world. Back then, he introduced me as a real-life acquaintance of the Black Scythe-nim."

"That's right. Yamti-nim is someone who knows and interacts with the Black Scythe-nim in real life as well."

"Could it be that Ryumin also...?"

"No, I've never met her. She's such a secretive person, so..."

"Then, is it really true that you know Yamti-nim?"

At that question, Yamti could finally relax and answer.

Because the owner acknowledged it.

"Haha, yes. That's right. I'm Yamti."

"No wonder you looked so similar. Nice to meet you."

"Nice to meet you too. By the way, meeting Seo Arin-nim in real life is surprising."

"Isn't it even more surprising that I'm an acquaintance of the Black Scythe-nim?"

Smiling, Seo Arin subtly revealed desire with a lowered voice.

"Hey, Yamti-nim. If it's not too rude, could you give me the Black Scythe-nim's contact information...?"

"I'm sorry. Of course, it's more of a breach of privacy for me than for the Black Scythe-nim. He doesn't like revealing his identity to anyone."

"Ah..."

Seo Arin felt awkward as Yamti spoke with seriousness.

"Then, could you at least let me make a brief call? I have something to say..."

"I'm sorry. Despite being real-life acquaintances, I don't know his contact information either. Calls from that side usually come with a restricted number. He's that cautious. He even covered his face in the CPF unit, you know?"

"Ah..."

Seo Arin understood but felt disappointed at the same time.

-I wanted to meet again in real life...

Reading her inner thoughts, Ryumin brushed off her worries.
ChatGPT

"He was more eager to meet me than to find out about my identity."

Seo Arin had worried about what to do if she persistently questioned about her identity, but it turned out there was no need.

"Well, even if they try, there's no way my identity will be revealed."

In anticipation of such a situation, she had informed Yamti of the appropriate response to inquiries about the Black Scythe in real life.

Fortunately, it seemed she had handled it well as per Seo Arin's thoughts.

Seo Arin didn't seem to suspect Yamti; she was merely envious that Yamti could communicate with the Black Scythe both in the game and in real life.

"But why are the two of you here in front of our house...?"

"Oh, I have something personal to ask Ryumin."

"Is that so? Come in first. Let's have a meal while you're here."

"A meal?"

"Haven't you had dinner yet?"

"Well, I haven't..."

"Then come in."

Smiling, Ryumin opened the front door and looked at her younger sibling.

"Is it okay if we have a few more guests?"

"Huh? Uh, yeah..."

Ryuwon, who had the chance to treat her favorite Seo Arin to dinner, felt both pleased and burdened at the same time.

Bubbling-

As the spicy kimchi stew bubbled and boiled, Ryuwon placed it in the middle of the dining table.

"I, I didn't prepare much, but please enjoy."

"Not much? This looks like a feast fit for royalty."

Despite Seo Arin's modest words, there were many side dishes on the table: rolled omelette, sausage stir-fry with vegetables, japchae, fish cake stir-fry, and kimchi stew.

It was a considerable amount for a single person to prepare, but Ryuwon managed it.

Even with Ryuumin's help, it still took an hour and a half to prepare the meal.

"I'll enjoy it."

"Where should we start?"

Sip-

Seo Arin's eyes sparkled as she tasted the kimchi stew.

"Did you follow a recipe from YouTube for this?"

"Yes... Is it not good?"

"It's amazing. It tastes so good?"

"Phew, I'm relieved. I was worried it might not taste good."

Ryuwon felt relieved only when she saw Seo Arin's sunshine-like smile.

"I didn't know my sister's cooking skills were this good."

"Haha, it's because I didn't do it. If I had, who knows?"

"Now that we're at it, why not study for a Korean cuisine certification? Stop playing games for now."

"Ugh... Ah, alright."

Ryumin, Ryuwon, Seo Arin, An Sangcheol, and Yamti, the five of them, finished their meal in a warm atmosphere.

"That was delicious, Wona."

"Thank you, Nuna."

Ryumin, who was watching Yamti and Ryuwon, asked in surprise, "What? When did you guys become so friendly?"

"When Ryumin went to the bathroom earlier. Hehe."

"I can't keep being formal with you, hyung, considering our age difference."

"Wona, are you dissing me for being older?"

"No, no, Nuna."

Laughing, Ryuwon, who had been chuckling, headed to do the dishes. Seeing this, Yamti discreetly got up from her seat.

"Are you going to do the dishes? Let's do it together. I'll help."

"I'll help too."

Ryumin stopped Seo Arin, who was also getting up. "Leave the cleanup to those two. We have something to discuss, right?"

"Ah, yes."

Seo Arin and An Sangcheol, following Ryumin, went to the living room and sat on the sofa.

"Shall we hear what you have to say to me?"

"Oracle. It's about meeting a troublemaker named Hwang Yongmin today..."

Ryumin calmly listened to Seo Arin's story.

"So, you can't find any search results for Hwang Yongmin?"

"Yes. It says he doesn't exist. Do you have any information about this...?"

"It's probably as it seems. He doesn't exist in this world."

"What? So, the person I saw is really a ghost...?"

"Where in this world would you find ghosts? Moreover, not just the actor but dozens of people claim to have witnessed him."

"That's right. What on earth happened?"

"Hmm."

Pretending to contemplate, Ryumin brought up a fabricated pretext from the mealtime conversation.

"Since it's come to this, I guess there's no choice. I'll spill the beans."

"What? What...?"

"Hwang Yongmin is already a dead person. However, he was resurrected as undead by someone."

"What? Undead?"

..."

The reactions were different, but both were wide-eyed and surprised. It wasn't that they didn't understand the meaning of the word "undead." They were simply shocked by the fact that the undead existed.
ChatGPT

"There's a profession among players that can resurrect corpses. Hwang Yongmin was resurrected as undead. The reason I told you not to mess with Hwang Yongmin was because of this... Looks like someone did."

"Huh... resurrected as undead. Who on earth would do such a thing...?"

"I don't know either. I foresaw it, but I only saw the back."

It was a lie, but there was some truth mixed in Ryumin's words.

Indeed, there is a profession called Necromancer that deals with the undead. While Warlocks can also manipulate the undead, it's more of a summoning concept, distinctly different from the Necromancer who raises corpses.

Shamans, on the other hand, tended to explode corpses.

"Manipulating a corpse to move like a living person is the work of a Necromancer. But you can't make them talk like Hwang Yongmin."

Although that made Hwang Yongmin different, it didn't matter. What was crucial now was convincing Seo Arin.

Fortunately, Seo Arin readily believed Ryumin's lie.

"So, I encountered some sort of zombie?"

You could say that."

"Ah, gives me the chills."

While Seo Arin rubbed her arms, An Sangcheol, with a curious expression, asked, "Oracle. Is that Necromancer a player from our country? What level are they?"

"I don't know the details."

"Could their existence pose a threat to us later?"

"Well, who knows. If treated as an enemy, it might be dangerous, don't you think?"

Although she spoke as if she didn't know, Ryumin was aware.

The existence of the Necromancer could become a hindrance in the future.

"Actually, it might become an obstacle for the Sin Society."

Knowing this fact in advance, Ryumin chose not to eliminate him. She planned to use even this obstacle.

"Darkness is needed for the light to shine brighter, after all."

No one saw the slight upward curve of Ryumin's lips.

After Seo Arin's group left, Ryumin approached her younger sibling and patted his shoulder.

"Good job."

"Haha, whatever."

"You're good at cooking, you know?"

"How about getting that certification as my brother suggested? Cooking is unexpectedly fun, and you seem to have a talent for it."

Ryuwon, who was laughing cheerfully, made Ryumin laugh along, but it wasn't out of joy. It was a laugh to hide bitterness.

"A certification... It's a luxury for me now."

No matter how remarkable a player was, their life was eventually at stake.
ChatGPT

"If I don't pass Round 20, my life is over.

Meanwhile, planning for the future by studying for a certification?

For players, it's an indulgence.

'Yeah, whatever happens to my life. Creating a world where even my sibling, or at least my sibling, can live an ordinary life—that's my role in the final round.'

To achieve that, as many variables as possible must be eliminated, and the plan must proceed as intended.

Tick-tock—

Returning to her room, Ryumin lay on the bed, deeply contemplating.

She checked her future plans, meticulously examined for any potential obstacles, and assessed whether everything was going according to plan.

'Could Seo Arin's existence be a variable? No. She's too deeply involved now. Removing her would actually be a variable.'

She knew about the friendship between Yamti and Ryumin, but it wouldn't change anything. If she continued to maintain a distance, not contacting the Black Scythe as she does now, there wouldn't be any questioning or suspicion.

Reading Seo Arin's inner thoughts confirmed this.

'Then what about An Sangcheol and Jeffrey?'

An Sangcheol was always near Makyeongrok or Seo Arin, making it easy to read his thoughts. In other words, it would be easy to deal with him if necessary.

'But Jeffrey is different.'

He's an unpredictable character, and there's no telling where he might turn. If it involves Kristin, he's an emotionally unattached figure.

"Hmm, annoying gadflies."

While systematically checking individuals who could be threats or hindrances, Ryumin received a call from Makyeongrok.

-Oracle, this is Ma Daepyo.

"Yes, what's the matter?"

-Are you available tomorrow afternoon? Jeffrey, whom you've met before, and my master, would like to meet you in Korea. It seems they want to apologize for the incident Jeffrey was involved in before.

'Jeffrey and Nathan are coming?'

Considering they came in person instead of just making a call to apologize, it seemed to be a significant matter.

"Understood. What time are they expected to arrive?"

-They should arrive at Incheon Airport around 3 p.m.

"Then, can we meet at a nearby cafe at 4 p.m.? I'll provide you with the location."

-Yes, that would be fine.

After ending the call, Ryumin immediately called Yamti.
ChatGPT

"Yamti, how many positions are left that we can dominate?"

With Chairman Pleseva and the Police Chief already under control, there are three positions left.

"Good. It seems reasonable to use one position for organization."

What's going on?

"I've decided to meet Jeffrey and Nathan tomorrow."

Are you planning to apologize?

"We'll see when we meet. So..."

Ryumin lifted one corner of her mouth.

"Just in case, be ready to join me too."
