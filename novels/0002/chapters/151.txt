Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 151"

Episode 151: Reunion

He ignited the Red Moon and unleashed it on the Moonlight Island.

With each swing, fifty players turned to dust and disappeared.

After sweeping away half of the forces in just five swings, he raised the corrupted god's scythe.

Swoosh!

The elongated scythe, like a giant's fist, swept through without exception.

Even though it was night, the increase in attack speed and Moonlight Island damage were clearly seen without activating any skills.

It was a one-sided affair.

It was even easier because he wasn't wearing any equipment.

For Ryumin, it was like walking around with a bonus.

"..."

"..."

In the real-time massacre drama unfolding before them, Victor and Yamti, who were watching, couldn't utter a word.

They felt no sympathy, nor were they happy about it.

They simply waited for the situation to end, as if enjoying an unstoppable natural phenomenon.

Just as he was about to kill them all.

A welcome notification appeared in Ryumin's sight.

[Confirmed as a player who has killed 1,000 players.] [Acquires the title 'Massacre.']

A smirk appeared on Ryumin's lips behind his mask.

It was the title he had been waiting for.

[Title - Massacre]

Acquisition Condition: Kill 1,000 players.

Effect: Increase damage dealt to players by 50%. Inflict 'Fear' status on all players witnessing the murder for 3 seconds.

Combining the number of Psevba members killed previously with those killed now, he reached 1,000.

With this, he obtained a title that guaranteed no worries in player-versus-player battles.

'Increase damage, make it easy to kill, and spread fear around after the kill.'

As expected.

With 50 test subjects in front of him, he immediately tried killing one with his scythe.

Thud!

As soon as one was killed, others who witnessed it stopped moving like toys with depleted batteries.

Not only did they lose their senses, but they also couldn't move due to fear.

The fear status was properly applied.

'However, the duration of fear is only 3 seconds.'

Although it seemed like a short time, it was by no means brief.

If it continued to be applied repeatedly.

Thud! Thud!
ChatGPT

When another person is killed, the fear sets in once again, and time resets.

Kill and reset, kill and reset.

While Ryumin was massacring, the rest trembled in place, unable to move.

This was due to the continuous application of the fear status.

'This is why titles that are intimidating in player-versus-player battles, especially in fights against multiple opponents.'

The downside is that it is not highly versatile as it only applies to players.

'Still, better to have it than not.'

In the early days, he didn't even know such titles existed.

It was later when he noticed it, thanks to Makyungrok and Jusungtak.

'When those guys witnessed players being massacred, they seemed to experience fear.'

It was only after killing IS and later that he learned about the titles.

'But no one would say it this way. They'd probably say, "Who would be crazy enough to kill 1,000 people."'

There is.

It happens precisely in the 11th round.

When the country is unified and the number of players increases, Makyungrok and Jusungtak commit a massacre.

They indiscriminately kill players from other countries.

It's to gain damn points.

'Perhaps they'll get the title 'Massacre' this time too.'

It doesn't matter if someone else gets the title 'Massacre.'

However, Ryumin didn't like it when opponents gained the power to resist him.

'Getting hit by fear is unpleasant too.'

Of course, even if it lasts for 3 seconds, he would dispel it in 0.3 seconds with high resistance.

But the fact that he gets affected by such things is unpleasant.

Above all, if people die like that, the number of survivors for the subsequent rounds decreases.

Therefore, Ryumin wants to deprive them of the opportunity to get the title.

'The title 'Massacre' must be mine alone.'

If he follows the same plan as the previous round, there shouldn't be any problems.

Although it will take some time for the 11th round to arrive.

Shururarak- Thak!

Ryumin, who had retrieved the elongated scythe to its original state, removed his equipment.

There were no more enemies standing.

'The stench is repulsive like garbage.'

When he raised his head, countless piles of corpses formed the hill.

Half of them disappeared without leaving a trace due to unbearable damage.
ChatGPT

A fight of approximately 500 against 1.

The result of an overwhelmingly one-sided victory was evident from the numbers.

Ryumin grimaced, using Trace Erasure to eliminate the corpses.

With such a large number, even erasing them was a task.

After a while, the gruesome scene was completely cleared, and Ryumin turned his gaze to the side.

Items voluntarily given by the deceased were scattered all over the place.

'Fortunately, the inventory capacity is infinite. I can monopolize all these items.'

From the human trafficking gang in Nigeria to uncovering IS and rescuing the alchemist, he controlled Albagdadi and used him to produce items.

Then, he killed unarmed players to reach 1,000 and obtain the title.

Everything went according to plan.

'Now, all that's left is to win the alchemist's favor.'

When he turned his gaze, he saw Victor and Yamti coming out of the building.

Victor, who had lost his soul witnessing the massacre of hundreds, quickly regained his composure and asked Ryumin.

"Is it all over now...?"

"I've dealt with the pests here. There's still one left, but..."

Ryumin's gaze turned towards Albagdadi.

As Yamti had become his subordinate, he stood still, following Ryumin's silent command.

"How did you manage to make the leader of IS betray us?"

"It's thanks to this player named Yamti. She has the ability to dominate minds, making them puppets."

"Ah..."

Such a terrifying woman was right next to them.

Victor, feeling a chill down his spine, became visibly concerned.

Ryumin, reading his thoughts, chuckled inside his mask.

"Don't worry. This ability doesn't work on players. There are many constraints and limitations."

"Ah... I see."

Though it was a lie, Victor believed it straightforwardly.

For him, the only person he could trust right now was the benefactor with the black scythe.
ChatGPT

"Thank you so much, Black Scythe. When you said you would stand against IS, I honestly doubted if it would be possible, but to see it realized like this... When I was held captive by IS, there was no hope, but now it's all thanks to you."

"It's nothing much."

Certainly, he succeeded in winning Victor's favor. Reading his thoughts, there was not only awe but also genuine gratitude.

'However... Victor no longer has the will to fight.'

Ryumin could tell from reading Victor's mind. Like an elderly person wanting to retire and spend the remaining years peacefully in their hometown, Victor wanted to let go of everything.

'Victor has to accompany me until Round 20. But with such a weak heart, he won't endure it.'

That was the problem.

However, Ryumin knew the solution.

That's why Ryumin pretended to be asleep.

"What will you do with the leader of IS now? Are you going to kill him?"

"I can't do that. IS has not been completely wiped out yet."

"Then..."

"I will use him until the end and then kill him. I'll use him to gather the remnants and put an end to the pest extermination. Don't worry. IS will disappear into history."

"Ah... Well, then it's fortunate. You really seem sure about handling things. Ah!"

Victor, who seemed relieved, suddenly opened his inventory.

"Take this."

"Isn't this the potion you were going to give me earlier?"

"Yes. I've gathered the potions I made by type. Please accept them as a token of my appreciation."

Since he couldn't refuse twice, Ryumin accepted the potions.

"Thank you. I'll make good use of them."

Looking at the received items, there were healing potions, stat potions, resistance potions, and more.

'Are these potions that a level 40 alchemist can make?'

They weren't legendary, but they were still useful enough.

"It may not be enough to pay for a life, but if you ever need potions, come to me and let me know. Oh, my address is..."

Victor, who gave his address, smiled. It was time to part ways.

"Don't hesitate to come by. I'll provide them to you for free, whether in reality or in another world. Of course, that's assuming I continue surviving the rounds..."

"Thank you."
ChatGPT

"Well then, I'll be going. I want to see Ricky and the kids as soon as possible. Same goes for my family."

"Please. You can take one of the trucks over there."

"Thank you. Take care on your way, Black Scythe and Lady Yamti. I owe you a great debt."

With a handshake, Ryumin sent Victor off without any lingering emotions.

As they moved a bit away, Yamti asked, "Is this how alchemists usually bid farewell, Master?"

"Yes, that's right. He promised to provide potions for me anytime."

"Then, have you achieved your goal?"

"No."

Ryumin shook his head as he watched Victor's retreating figure.

"What I want is to bring Victor along until Round 20. But Victor doesn't have the heart for it yet. He's tired. He achieved the goal of wanting to see his family before he dies. Now, he's in a state where he doesn't care how the rest of his life turns out."

To accompany a player with no will to survive through 20 rounds?

It seemed impossible.

It didn't sit well with Ryumin.

"Now, what will you do?"

"Well, I have to change the alchemist's mind."

Rumble—

Watching the truck start and leave, Ryumin instructed Yamti.

"Tell Albagdadi to guide them to the location where the alchemist's potions are hidden. Meanwhile, I'll..."

Ryumin took off his mask and said, "I'll be picking up some items."

Marcus was a gentle man who had been held captive with IS.

As a teacher at Lagos School, he was the second most trusted figure after Black Scythe.

"Mr. Marcus!"

"Oh, Victor. You're safe!"

When he visited Marcus's house, he could see Ricky and the kids running towards him.

"Mr. Marcus!"

"Ricky! Have you been well?"

"It's really you!"

"Yes. I told you that Mr. Victor would come to get us."

"But what happened? What about IS?"

Smiling, Victor, while sharing the reunion time, explained the situation to Marcus.

"IS brought over 500 players, but Black Scythe defeated them all. Now, you don't have to worry."

"Really? They won against 500 to 1?"

Marcus, reminded of Black Scythe's strength, asked Victor once again, "What will happen now?"
ChatGPT

“Well, we need to go back home.”

“Already leaving, sir?”

As Ricky asked with a hint of regret, tears welling up, Victor gently patted his head.

"We have to go. After all, I came to make sure you all are safe."

"Sigh..."

"Don't worry. Mr. Marcus's house and our house are close. I'll come visit often while I'm here. Take care during my absence."

"Yes, we understand."

With a smiling Victor ready to leave, he prepared to go out.

"Mr. Marcus, I'll leave the kids to you until they find their parents. If you need help, just let me know. Do you remember our home address?"

"Yes, got it. Don't worry, and go home quickly. Your family must be worried."

"Thank you. See you then."

Shaking hands, Victor soon left, driving his car back to his home.

"Is he already leaving? It's been a year, hasn't it?"

A year ago, Victor, who lived with his parents and his 5-year-old sister, was unfortunately kidnapped by IS for the simple reason of being a doctor.

"Just because I refused to treat their injured without reason, they threatened to find and kill my family."

Under such threats, Victor spent a year in the role of an IS medical officer.

Throughout the process, Victor, who witnessed all sorts of unimaginable scenes, had only one motivation to endure – his family.

The moment of meeting his family was the only thing he dreamed of, enduring and persevering through it all.

And soon, that moment would become a reality.

"Phew, finally arrived."

Victor, who arrived near his home, abandoned the car and walked the rest of the way.

His heart pounded as he walked with familiarity, looking at the familiar scenery.

And finally.

Click—

Opening the front door, Victor was able to meet them.

His family, whom he missed and longed for.

"Vi, Vi, Victor?"

"Mother..."

Drip, drip—

Without even bothering to wipe away the flowing tears, they embraced each other tightly.

"Victor? Victor is here?"

Even the solemn father, upon seeing his son, came out of the room and joined the tearful reunion.

Embracing tightly, parents and son confirmed that each other was alive.

"You were alive. Thank goodness, truly thankful."

"I thought you were dead."
ChatGPT

"Sob, I'm perfectly fine, Father, Mother."

"It's not right to stand here like this. Let's go inside. Once we're inside, you can tell us what happened during this time."

"Yes. But what about Sophia?"

Sophia was Victor's younger sister.

It was a natural question, considering only the sister was missing. However, for some reason, an awkward expression appeared on the faces of his parents.

"Uh... well, you see..."

Hearing the circumstances, Victor was taken aback and couldn't believe what he heard.
