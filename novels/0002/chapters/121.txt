Title: Episode 121 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Round 8 Ends

└ Obstructing the Top to Prevent Arrival at the Destination

└ Success ▶ Grants Madragora's Mana Stream

[You have completed the Betrayer Group Quest!] [As a reward for the Betrayer Group Quest, you receive 'Madragora's Mana Stream'!] [Madragora's Mana Stream]

Category: Item

Description: A stem containing the mana of the carnivorous monster Madragora.

Note that the Betrayer Quest reward is the same as the sub-quest reward.

So, if someone had completed a sub-quest, they would have said something like this upon receiving the reward.

Where am I supposed to use this?

It's a natural reaction when an item appears that you don't know how to use.

It was the same when Ryumin received it for the first time.

'I never expected a crafting material item as a quest reward. Usually, something immediately usable comes out.'

But thinking differently, it means that it's an equally important item.

In the past, he didn't know, but now he understands its value.

'Madragora's Mana Stream is nothing less than a god-tier crafting material.'

He had planned to create a god-tier item before Round 11, but the materials were already gathered.

A smile spread across Ryumin's face because of this.

Whether an angel paid attention to his own work or not.

[Have you all checked the rankings? Then, in order of high contributions, we will allow survival up to rank 1,083, and all below will be annihilated.]

"No, don't!"

"Save us! Please, I beg you...!"

As always, half of the players turned into a handful of ashes.

It was an unfortunate event, but Ryumin had no intention of caring about the demise of others.

Reward messages appeared one after another.

[Congratulations! You have achieved the quest as the 1st in this area!] [Congratulations! You have achieved the quest as the 1st in the entire region!] [Currently, 'Black Scythe' ranks 1st in the entire region and 1st in this area.] [As the 1st in this area ranking, you receive 'Reputation Boost Ticket'!] [As the 1st in the entire region ranking, you receive 'Special Reward Selection Box'!]
ChatGPT

Usually, the reward for being the 1st in the area was equipment, but this time it was different.

'Reputation Boost Ticket... If it were someone else, they might wonder what kind of reward this is.'

But the reward is correct.

It's a definite reward.

An opportunity to raise one's reputation with other races without any effort.

'It's also a message to start reputation work in earnest.'

Until now, it hasn't been introduced, but from now on, the fantasy world with NPCs will be the main stage.

In that aspect, reputation with other races is important.

Considering what one can gain from other races, the importance of reputation goes without saying.

[You can raise your reputation with one of the following races.] [Please touch the desired race.]

└ 1. Human (Time Reverser - Hostile)

└ 2. Elf (Black Scythe - Friendly)

└ 3. Dwarf (Forward Leader - Friendly)

The application of reputation varies for each nickname and title.

For example, when meeting dwarves, if you use a title other than Forward Leader, you can't expect favorable treatment.

'For now, I need to raise the reputation from friendly to very friendly.'

The decision didn't take long.

Ryumin's finger pointed to the Elf.

[Elf's reputation with Black Scythe has risen from 'Friendly' to 'Very Friendly.']

The reason for choosing the Elf was simple.

'Because I can get better rewards.'

If he had raised the Dwarf, he might have laid the groundwork to obtain legendary and god-tier materials.

'When you think about it, it's better to raise the Elf side. Those who are proficient in magic have a lot of rare runic fragments.'

Ryumin valued the worth of runes more than the value of items.

Both are important, but if he had to choose, it would be the Elf side.

'Now, when I meet the Elf tribe in the name of Black Scythe, they'll treat me like royalty.'

Perhaps the elders of the Council, who hold the power in Elsorium, might even hand over the princess to him.

To maintain a friendly relationship.

'I'm fine with that. As long as I get runic fragments.'

There were a few runic fragments he wanted from the Elves.

That's all Ryumin is aiming for.

Hoping to meet the Elves next time, he used the special reward selection box.
ChatGPT

[You can choose one of the following special rewards.] [Please touch the desired reward.]

└ 1. Material Item Selection Voucher

└ 2. 30,000 Gold

└ 3. Information about Round 9

Usually, option 1 had stats or experience point buffs, but this time it was not present.

Without hesitation, he chose the Material Item Selection Voucher.

[Choose one of the following materials.]

└ 1. Broken Ironwood Branch

………………

…………

└ 8. Mage Skeleton's Bone Powder

└ 9. Sturdy Magic Shell

└ 10. Horn of the Abyss

Most of the items that came to mind were unique materials.

'But only one of these is a legendary material.'

Ryumin's finger chose option 8.

[Mage Skeleton's Bone Powder]

Category: Item

Description: Sinister magic can be felt in the powder.

This makes it the third legendary material.

Only two more, and he can create it.

Materials are steadily accumulating.

◀ ROUND 8 Ends ▶

[Entire Area]

└ Survivors: 1,523,955

[Specific Area C2-ESKA003]

└ Survivors: 1,083

[Soul will transfer to the original dimension shortly.] [Round 9 will begin on September 1, 2022, at midnight. See you in the next round. Congratulations on surviving.]

After Round 8 ended,

Kristin immediately went to her father when she opened her eyes.

"Father."

"You're late."

Jeffrey the butler was already by her father's side.

Even though she came relatively quickly, she felt disappointed.

"Did you hear the report?"

"Yeah. I heard it all from Jeffrey."

Her father Nathan's eyes flickered.

"That friend named Ryumin's prophecy turned out to be all true."

"Yes. Honestly, I was surprised. It was hard to believe."

The information about the Round 8 quest she had heard from Magyeongrok turned out to be true.

It was specific information, not vague like in Round 7, making it hard to doubt.

The existence of the occupation of a prophet.

"It's now revealed that your fiancé has been preempting information about the next rounds through prophecy."

"That's right."

A smug smile curled on Kristin's lips.

It was upsetting to find out he had hidden it from her all this time.

"Now, what are you going to do?"

"What?"
ChatGPT

"The prophet who sees the future is in partnership with your fiancé. If you play your cards right, you too can enjoy the benefits of seeing the future. So, wouldn't it be wise to catch him?"

"Catch him? The prophet?"

"Of course. In times like these, a prophet is nothing less than a goose laying golden eggs, don't you think? Especially if you can know the strategy for the next round in advance."

Given that survival is directly at stake in each round, the value of information is significant.

Nathan had seen through this fact early on and insisted on not missing out on the prophet.

"Become close to that person. Use any means necessary."

"But..."

"Is there something bothering you? Don't you still believe in prophecies?"

"No, it's not that. It's just that intentionally approaching someone for personal gain feels uncomfortable..."

"Do you have the luxury to be reserved right now? Aren't you the one holding your own lifeline?"

Kristin remembered.

The prophet's words about a life-threatening situation in Round 11.

"Go to Korea. Get more information from him. Find out how to survive. Make sure Round 11 doesn't become the end of your life as the prophecy suggests."

"...Yes."

Kristin obediently responded to her father's words.

Taking care of her own plate was the least she could do.

To survive, she needed more than just information.

"Well then, I'll be leaving now, tired."

As Kristin left, Jeffrey, as if waiting, asked.

"What should I do? Should I continue monitoring that prophet by going to Korea?"

"No. Now that it's certain there's a prophet, there's no reason to secretly dig up information. It might be troublesome if someone catches you tailing the prophet and disrupts his state of mind."

"Then..."

"You too, go to Korea following Kristin. Under the guise of an operative, watch the prophet closely, find out who he is, and report back to me."

"I will carry out the orders in the name of the divine."

After a bow, Jeffrey left the room.

Left alone, Nathan muttered to himself.

"A prophet. Truly a figure worthy of being called a disciple of the gods."

Suddenly, such a thought crossed his mind.

'If only my daughter's fiancé were the representative of Ma, not that prophet.'

Regret flickered on Nathan's face.
ChatGPT

The first thing Ryumin did after waking up in the room was to open the shop.

"All the items in the shop have been upgraded to Master grade."

The items available in the shop change depending on the player's grade. After reaching level 60, players can purchase Master-grade equipment.

"But it's just ordinary items, after all."

Most players would use these ordinary items to equip themselves. If they have some money, they might also grab a few rare or epic items from the Today's Items corner.

"But from now on, I won't bother with items below Epic."

Starting today, Ryumin planned to equip himself with Unique grade or higher items. Thanks to purchasing all the materials through the PfPf app, he had enough to make three.

"Where should I start?"

Ryumin bought helmets, armor, shoes, and rings from the shop for 6,000 gold each.

Even though they were unremarkable ordinary items, they were still of Master grade.

"In a little while, a magic that transforms them into Unique grade will unfold."

Ryumin filled the slots with equipment and the ordered Unique materials.

[Main Material]

Active Boots

[Sub-materials]

Deerwood Roots

Orc's Fang

Noll's Spine

Sturdy Magic Shell

Black Gold Ore

He put the materials that would become Unique-grade items in the sub-materials, and for the main material, he used the Master-grade equipment he had bought a while ago.

"By combining them like this, normal equipment transforms into Unique."

The reason he waited until he crossed level 60 was for this. If he was going to enhance equipment, it would be better to enhance Master grade.

When he pressed the button, a joyful message appeared.

After creating only three Unique items, all the accumulated materials were completely depleted.

"Now, the only thing left is God-grade."

Ryumin pondered.

For the first God-grade item he creates, which one would be better?

Weapons, helmets, armor, each part would have different performance.

But the pondering didn't last long.

"It's better to start with the parts I can obtain immediately."

Since he couldn't choose the material items, he decided to make them as they came in.

The required items for each part are likely to be slightly different.

"Now, with the materials I have...," Ryumin placed the God-grade material items on the combination window.

[Main Material]

Faded Coat

[Sub-materials]

Condensed Ether

Dark Iron Powder

Shiny Horse Tail

Angel's Golden Powder

Mandragora's Power Stem

"It's armor."

He immediately pressed the combination button.

With a golden effect unlike usual, the item was created.

A God-grade item.
