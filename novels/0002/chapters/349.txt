Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 349"

Drakania

Originally, there were no restrictions on the number of people in the boss room.

Whether one person or several, anyone could enter without being wiped out.

That was the original condition.

However.

"That damn god changed it."

Gaia, the god, arbitrarily altered the settings to not let herself be overlooked.

The new condition was elimination if there were more than five people.

"Why did you do that?"

Ryumin's voice was heavy.

But Gaia brushed it off with a smile, as if it were an obvious question.

[Why, you ask? After hundreds of years, a talent shows up, not even bothering with the Archangel, and trying to enter the boss room. Should I just let it be?]

"If you hadn't changed the settings, I would have conquered the boss room in the 99th round, obtained the wish stone, revived the dead with my wish, and finally lived a normal life."

[That would have been nice. But what about Chaos? You wouldn't have fulfilled your intention to kill Chaos, but would that have been okay?]

"Chaos didn't care about me until then. Neither did I. In fact, I gained attention because I became a divine being."

Ryumin's eyes, looking at Gaia, sparkled with intensity.

Resentment and blame were clearly evident in his gaze.

"It's you who messed up my life. If you hadn't interfered, I would have lived a normal life."

[Instead, humans from other dimensions would have suffered. Chaos would have continued its extermination policies to fill its power.]

"What do other dimensions have to do with me?"

[They're still humans. Is it okay if humans from other dimensions die?]

Seeing Gaia trying to connect everything, Ryumin let out a cynical laugh.

"I'm busy taking care of my own people, and you expect me to save humans from other dimensions? Risk my life to kill Chaos for people whose faces I don't even know? I'm not that altruistic."

[You're selfish. But it's too late now.]

"I know. It's too late to withdraw. But remember this."

A sharp gaze pierced Gaia.

"I can't see the truth in a better light than I do now."
ChatGPT

[Heh, amusing. Talking about the subject that used to be human.] [Ahem, Lady Gaia.]

As Lubahi, who had been pretending to cough, approached Gaia, he whispered something.

Upon hearing it, Gaia seemed to regain her composure and calmed down her excitement.

[I'm sorry. I was impulsive just now. Let me apologize.]

"No need to come out with a formal tone. I don't intend to withdraw now. After all, we even signed a contract to kill Chaos, didn't we?"

[So, are you going to help us?]

"Of course. But it doesn't mean I'm reconciled with you. The fact that I missed the chance to live a normal life because of you won't change."

'Such a narrow-minded human. Why dwell on past events?â€™

Gaia's attitude towards the Primordial Deity was already complicated, but in front of the Black Scythe, she couldn't afford to be outspoken.

She needed him to deal with Chaos.

"Now that we've finished talking about the past, tell me. What's the method to kill Chaos?"

[It's a plan I've prepared in case you can't gather 100 billion terra. Listen to it once and decide.]

Ryumin nodded, listening to Gaia's words with a dry gaze.

In the world, there are five major races.

Divine, Celestial, Demonic, Draconic, and Human.

If you were to choose the humblest race, from the perspective of the Divine, it would be humans, but it's all just talk, as it's unknown.

The race that received divine punishment was not humans but the Draconic race.

'Is this it? The Draconic planet?'

Ryumin stepped on the ground with the body of the Black Scythe.

It was an avatar temporarily created by Gaia.

His real body was on Earth.

'And this isn't Earth.'

Drakania, known as the land of the Draconic race.

A world exclusively for the Draconic race, where only they existed, but in reality, it was a place akin to a refuge for those abandoned by the gods.

'That's probably why the land is barren.'

In an environment more suitable for the name "Land of Death" where not a single blade of fresh grass was visible, the Draconic race lived.

'Originally, there was a better place to live, but due to the hatred of Chaos, they were forced to retreat here.'

Gaia did not explain why they received hatred.

Thinking there must be a reason, Ryumin didn't ask either.
ChatGPT

"It may not be to my liking, but there's no choice. For now, capturing Chaos, a public enemy, is a top priority."

Gaia was unpleasant, but Ryumin had no choice but to seek her help.

It was the only remaining option.

"It's just a temporary alliance. Temporary..."

Her decision to send him to Drakania was also Gaia's measure.

Because the method to kill Chaos was here.

Drakania hides a massive amount of terra. I've accumulated this energy meticulously in preparation for this time. It's like an emergency fund that Chaos is unaware of, you know?

Buried the emergency fund in the land of the Draconic race? In the land where Chaos banished the Draconic race?

Don't worry. There's no fear of being exposed. Chaos doesn't even bother with the Draconic race anymore. It's as your world's saying goes: "The darkest place is under the lamp."

So, are you telling me to find this terra energy?

That's right. Absorb the terra and defeat Chaos. It's the alternative I've prepared.

Where is it?

I can't describe it in words. The dragons manage it as well. So, go and find the Dragon Lord yourself.

Dragon Lord?

He's a dragon deeply resentful of Chaos. He's firmly on our side. So, go and speak my name to him. He'll guide you to the place where the terra is buried.

Why don't you just infuse the terra into me? It would be simpler.

It's not that simple of an issue. There's no terra to infuse. If I could do anything as a creator god, why would I be in this situation? It would have been easier if I could intervene directly.

Sounds like there are limitations.

Yes. So, you have to find it yourself. That's why you completed the 2nd divinization, right?

Is finding it yourself referring to searching in the soul state?

No. I'll create an avatar for you in Drakania that resembles the one you used during your lifetime. Although it won't have the level or player functions, it should be sufficient.

Can't you restore runes or skills?

Data that has already been erased cannot be recovered.

That's a shame.

Once you obtain the terra, not having those abilities won't matter. So, go, absorb the terra with the Dragon Lord, and come back.

Ryumin, recalling the conversation with Gaia, wore a determined expression.
ChatGPT

"Absorb the hidden terra with the Dragon Lord and come back? It's a simple mission."

However, Ryumin's expression seemed somewhat complicated.

Could it be because the blow from Gaia hadn't healed yet?

As Ryumin pondered, he raised his head.

"Since it's come to this, there's no other choice."

First, he needed to find the Dragon Lord.

Although the location wasn't revealed, the method to find the Dragon Lord turned out to be simpler than he thought.

"Temporary skill, Vengeance."

['Tracks the location of the target with a grudge against 'Chaos.'] ['Located the Dragon Lord 'Carmytris.'] ['Currently at a distance of 27,389m.'] ['To track the target, follow the arrow in front of you.']

Using the skill obtained from Nemesis, he could easily know the location.

Although he had no level or skills, the Eternal equipment and registered temporary skills were still effective.

Even the soul contained in the gauntlet.

"Should I ask for some information about the Dragon Lord on the way?"

Since Gaia didn't provide any information, he had no choice but to find out this way.

Ryumin recalled the soul stored in the gauntlet and called out.

Nemesis.

Yes?

Tell me everything you know about the Dragon Lord.

The Dragon Lord? Why all of a sudden...

Don't know, just answer the question. Otherwise, extinction...

Oh, okay! I'll do everything you say, so stop threatening me.

What do you know?

I don't know much about the Dragon Lord. Only that he's the king of dragons and is constrained by power due to being hated by Chaos...

Why is he hated by Chaos?

The Dragon Lord hid and protected Chronos.

Chronos?

Yes. Chronos once stayed in the land of the dragons and, before leaving, delayed the aging of the dragons, preventing their extinction. Thanks to that, dragons could live for thousands of years, gaining strength and being called a superior race. After that, Chronos became revered as an idol among the dragons.

But it seems Chaos discovered that fact.

That's right. Chaos, who was looking for Chronos, heard the rumors and came looking. And he asked the Dragon Lord about Chronos's whereabouts. But the Dragon Lord didn't betray him, and in the end, he incurred the wrath of Chaos.
ChatGPT

"So, they live here like a forsaken race on this backward planet."

Now it makes sense why the Draconic race appears as mere monsters in the rounds.

They incurred the deep-seated hatred of Chaos.

"To end up like this while shielding Chronos. It's understandable to hold a grudge."

Seeing the activation of Vengeance, it was clear that the Dragon Lord harbored genuine resentment.

At least as a team against a common enemy, they could act.

"But why such a quest..."

Ryumin momentarily lowered his head.

Regardless, he needed to meet the Dragon Lord first.

Running through the sky with the Eternal item, God's Stride, he unintentionally arrived at his destination.

"Is that the place where the Dragon Lord is?"

Between the bushy mountain ranges, a cave was visible.

Thinking that it would be an exquisite place as the leader of the dragons resides there, it turned out to be nothing more than an ordinary cave.

"But the size of the cave is still impressive."

Estimating the size of the Dragon Lord, Ryumin entered the cavern.

After taking about three steps, a voice reached his ears.

"Daring to step into my sanctuary without fear. Seize this opportunity now. If you're lost, turn back."

"Seems like I've properly found it. Dragon Lord."

"Who goes there? Reveal your identity."

"If I say I'm the envoy sent by Gaia, would you understand?"

After a moment, a red glow emerged from the darkness.

The head of a dragon, with a cunning expression, looked down at Ryumin.

"Human? No, a divine being?"

"Let's say a bit of both?"

"Is it really Gaia who sent you?"

"I heard you've already been informed."

"If that's the case, speak. Why have you come?"

"There's hidden terra on this planet. I've come to absorb it."

"Ah, you're the vessel Gaia mentioned."

"Vessel?"

Ryumin's eyebrows twitched.

While he understood the part about containing the terra, it wasn't a pleasant expression to hear.

"Are you the human known as the Black Scythe? The weapon to oppose Chaos."

"Yes, that's right."

As if the tension had eased, the Dragon Lord, who had revealed himself in the darkness, changed his appearance.

His massive body swiftly shrunk to that of a human.

"I am Karmytris, the Dragon Lord."
ChatGPT

"I am the Black Scythe. A case of being human and then becoming a divine being."

"I know. Follow me. I will guide you to the place where the terra is."
