Title: "Episode 126 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max-Level Player"

Unmanned Cafe

An ambitious night.

Ryumin's gaze was directed towards the abandoned warehouse.

Though chilling screams occasionally emanated from within, Ryumin just laughed.

Well, they were nothing but trash deserving of death.

"I've chosen the location well. This place is perfect for an incineration site for trash."

The surroundings were filled with mountains, and human presence was scarce, making it ideal for disposing of bodies. Moreover, there were obedient cleaners.

"To be honest, I was skeptical whether Makyungrok would help me, but he's moving exactly as I wanted..."

Ryumin asked Makyungrok to handle the trash cleanup, risking the danger of revealing his secret.

"It was a kind of gamble. Once the secret was exposed, it wouldn't be strange for enemies to appear anytime."

He even considered fighting Makyungrok if necessary.

Even if he supplied dark magic by handing over human trash, there was no one happy to have their long-hidden flaws exposed.

So, he chose to approach it openly.

Until now, many people had treated Makyungrok hypocritically, so wouldn't the opposite approach work?

"But surprisingly, it worked. It was a move to open up and honestly speak my mind. Strictly speaking, it was just pretending to open up."

Fortunately, things went smoothly.

"Well, it's not a bad deal for Makyungrok either."

Even if he couldn't win Makyungrok's heart, he was confident he could handle it.

With the ability to see the future 7 seconds ahead, he could always correct things for the better.

If things went wrong, he might have to fight Makyungrok.

"Anyway, the trash cleanup is resolved with this."

Ryumin immediately turned away.

Though the screams lengthened as if they were killed beautifully, he didn't bother going inside.

Even if they shared secrets, he had no intention of disrupting Makyungrok's secret meals.

For now, hearing the screams was enough.

"Morning, afternoon, evening, and midnight, dividing into groups of five. With twenty people each day, Makyungrok should be able to gather enough dark magic."

The remaining days until the 9th round were 28.

Even if I lure them for a full 28 days and kill them, I can only clean up 560 people, but there's no other choice.

"Anything more than that is too risky."

Excessive feasts would also burden Makyungrok, so they reached an agreement to limit it to that extent.

"What should I do with the remaining 471 people..."

Those fellows will disappear anyway in the next round, so it would be better to tear apart and kill those who need to be killed.

"Should I take care of the ones Makyungrok couldn't handle?"

With such thoughts, Ryumin returned home and picked up his phone.

Looking at the list of murders sent by Yantti, as he contemplated whom to kill, he noticed a familiar name.

"Who is this person...?"

On a silent night, Ryumin's eyes gleamed coldly.

August's summer.

It has been almost 8 months since the world began to collapse.

A lot has happened in this seemingly short period.

Not only did the economy shake with a financial crisis, but the stock prices of all stocks plummeted to the bottom.

The natural result, considering that most of the people in their 20s, who constituted a significant part of economic activity, died.

Store owners hastily replaced them with people in their 30s, but the reality was a shortage of both labor and customers.

Now, part-time jobs could be secured with just one text message.

As a result, unmanned convenience stores and unmanned cafes were explosively increasing in number.

The cafe visited by Seo Arin and Hong Seon-a was also an unmanned system.

"Arin, right? Add two extra shots of caramel macchiato, okay?"

"Yeah, thanks."

"The world has really become better. You can even use unmanned cafes."

"You too, really. If someone hears, they might think you're an 80-year-old who's eaten too much."

Seo Arin grinned.

There hasn't been much to smile about lately.

Coming out with fellow actors and chatting peacefully felt like happiness.

That's how much the world had changed.

Hell wasn't far away.

It was close.

"Come to think of it, our main fan base is now in their 30s. Most of those in their 20s have died."

"Ah... suddenly talking about depressing things like that."

Seo Arin wished multiple times.

That the reality she faced was a lie.

That the survival game of killing and being killed was all just a dream.
ChatGPT

"I still think about it when I come back from the rounds. Could all of this be a dream? Will my close actor friends contact me again, smiling?"

In acting, Seo Arin was sincere. She loved her work and enjoyed the chemistry with her fellow actors. Lucky to meet Makyungrok, she received support in various ways and prospered. A successful life. But now, such a life no longer existed. Like most professions in the current situation, the entertainment industry was also showing signs of collapse. As the atmosphere rapidly declined, Hong Seon-a apologized.

"Sorry for bringing up depressing topics."

"No, this is the reality."

"It's tough, huh? How about learning to smoke? Wanna try regular cigarettes?"

"Haha, thanks for making me laugh."

Laughing off the joke, she continued to sip her caramel macchiato. As the sweetness entered her mouth, her mood improved.

"Still, we're somewhat better off. We survived. Because we're players."

"That's true."

"I'm still shocked that Gung Senbaenim passed away. Who would've thought he'd pass away in Round 1? And a man at that."

"It doesn't matter if it's a man or a woman as long as the stats are the same."

"Well, it wouldn't make sense for a middle schooler to exert the same strength as an adult. Thinking about it now, goblins are just dog food, right?"

When a curse came out of the fellow actor's mouth, Seo Arin retorted.

"Even if there are few people, be careful with your words."

"So what? Isn't this my charm? Fans may not know."

Hong Seon-a smiled confidently, raising her nose.

Despite being an unmanned cafe, there were no other people around besides them.

"It's an advantage when there's no one around. You can go outside without covering your face."

"But the income has decreased."

"That's true. But is income a problem in this situation? Surviving right now is the top priority."

Since it wasn't a false statement, Seo Arin silently agreed.

What could be more important than survival in the current situation?

"Arin, you're lucky. You have a good job for survival."

"Oh, you mean the summoned creatures?"

"Yeah. Listening to you, it sounds like a total scam. Golems provide a shield, fairies protect. Fairies even assist in combat after level 20? They do everything like slaves, how great is that? Envious, truly envious."
ChatGPT

"Your job is not easy either."

"Me? No. I only count a bit of damage. As it turns out, the assassin is a common and overused job. There's a skill called invisibility, but it's useless."

"Why? You can use it during combat, right?"

"That's true. But it's not great for fighting. Once you attack, it's released. The cooldown is long. It's mainly used for survival when things get dangerous."

"Well, that's still good. What could be as important as survival?"

"True. But in reality, there isn't much danger, right? It's vague to utilize. It's not like I have clairvoyance, and even if I did, there are measures in place nowadays, so there's no use in robbing a bank."

"...."

"It's written here that card payment is the only option in this cafe. Maybe they're afraid of players robbing them for cash."

"Seon-a, you're not seriously considering this, right?"

"Am I stupid? Would I even entertain such a ridiculous thought? Anyway, can't you tell the difference between a joke and sincerity?"

Despite the rebuke, Seo Arin just chuckled bashfully. Thinking about the friendship forged through working on various projects together, even gossiping like this felt good. Especially since Hong Seon-a was her only surviving actor friend.

"But aren't we really amazing? Surviving until Round 8."

"That's true."

"They say you can count on one hand the people who survived in the entertainment industry until now."

"So many died?"

"Of course! Don't you know? Most seniors, juniors, and even idol singers from the music side have almost all died. About 70% of celebrities are dead, right?"

"No way. It couldn't be that much..."

"She visited condolences here and there in a frenzy, but it seems she really had no idea."

Hong Seon-a clicked her tongue.

"Do you happen to not know about this? Our market value has skyrocketed?"

"Huh? Market value increased?"

It was a fact that the entertainment industry, heavily populated by people in their 20s, was destined to collapse. But what about the players who survived? Ironically, as a rare and exceptional celebrity, they monopolized the public's favor. That was the current state of the entertainment industry after the upheaval.

When Hong Seon-a mentioned this, Seo Arin wore an expression of utter surprise.

"Are you saying our market value has increased, and we've become more famous than before?"
ChatGPT

"Do you really not know? Haven't you searched your name on the internet?"

"I don't really do ego searching..."

"Try it now."

As if tricked, Seo Arin typed her name into the search bar. Unconsciously, she let out a surprised voice.

"Huh?"

There were more articles than she expected.

[List of 20s celebrities who survived until Round 8? Seo Arin, Hong Seon-a, Gu Yeonseung, Jang Bokchul, and others, a total of 19 people!] [Seo Arin, Hong Seon-a, and others, establishing themselves as top stars amid the depressing situation, celebrity players! Inquiries from advertisers pouring in.] [Jang Bokchul, who has appeared as an extra for 10 years, rising to stardom after Seo Arin... ] [Jang Bokchul, who gained fame as an unknown actor player, confesses Seo Arin is his ideal type. Surprising confession.] [Seo Arin and other Round 8 surviving players, overall ad rates increased by 2.8 times compared to before.]

These were the articles that came up when searching Seo Arin's name.

With a rabbit-in-the-headlights look, Seo Arin seemed surprised to find out that her name was mentioned so much.

"W-what is this? When did my market value go up again?"

"With fewer celebrities, ad revenue increased, and market values skyrocketed. The girl mentioned in the articles, Jang Bokchul, was an unknown actor, but surviving Round 8 this time, she's gaining tremendous popularity."

"...."

"And you really didn't know about this situation at all? Are you trying to tease me by telling lies?"

Seo Arin, genuinely flustered, clapped her hands.

"Oh, no. I really didn't know. I haven't been on the internet for a while, not even to search my name..."

"Even if you don't go on the internet, someone from your manager or the company must have told you."

"Manager...?"

Thinking of An Sangcheol, Seo Arin lowered her head.

"He didn't tell me anything..."

"Even with this many articles, you didn't hear anything? Are you kidding me right now?"

Seo Arin, genuinely bewildered, shook her head.

"No, really. I had no idea. I haven't even been on the internet for a while..."

"Even if you didn't, someone from your manager or the company would have mentioned it."

"Manager...?"

Seo Arin thought of An Sangcheol and tilted her head.

"No one told me anything..."

"With this many articles, no one told you anything? Who is the CEO of your agency, anyway?"

Although it wasn't an official agency, if there was a representative from the supporting company, it would be Makyungrok...

Still, she never heard anything.

With a bitter expression, Seo Arin lowered her head.

"No one told me. I don't know what the situation is right now."

"Ha, does this even make sense? You didn't even know that your market value went up as a celebrity."
ChatGPT

Seo Arin looked at Hong Seon-a, who sighed.

She seemed to be in a good mood, but was it because of her emotions?

"I really need to leave the company soon. They're a bunch of bastards, aren't they? They deliberately kept information hidden to suck up the advance payments."

"...."

"The news about our market values came out three months ago. So, knowing it for at least three months and keeping your mouth shut, how could you do that?"

"I shouldn't say this, but... you didn't say anything either. You didn't contact me for months, and suddenly you did today."

"Hey! I naturally assumed you knew! Who in the world doesn't read internet articles? Especially celebrities!"

Seo Arin became speechless.

She regretted bringing it up for no good reason.

"I was busy. As you know, the world has been too bleak, so I avoided all contacts for a while..."

"Ugh, seriously! Nonsense, nonsense!"

Hong Seon-a, who had been bluntly criticizing, spoke with a hint of bitterness.

"Stop that and come to our company. Our CEO treats us so well. Arin, with your status, you could be treated quite well. You have some name value among rookie actors."

"No, it's fine. It's too late to switch now. Besides, there's still time left in the contract."

"Terminate that contract. Should I talk to our CEO? You'd probably get out of the penalty fee too, right?"

"It's fine. I don't want to move around like a migratory bird."

Hong Seon-a's eyes momentarily turned cold.

"Are you ignoring what I'm saying?"

"Huh? What?"

"Never mind. Anyway, it's a pity. It would be great if we could work in the same company."

"There's nothing to do. The life of a celebrity is over. I can't guarantee survival even in the next round, let alone doing something long-term like dramas or movies."

"Does she only know one thing and not the other two? Why is there no work? Even if there's no work, why? If you snag some good advertisements, you can earn the annual salary of an average office worker for ten years. Just ads? Even if you can't do dramas or movies, you can appear in variety shows and various programs."

As she listened, it made sense.

"But your company has blocked all those opportunities? After the Great Change, haven't you really worked properly since then?"
ChatGPT

Seo Arin nodded cautiously.

Just to be safe.

"Yeah..."

As expected, Hong Seon-a tapped her forehead.

"That company is really not a good place. Why would you go to such a stupid place..."

"Seon-a, even if you say that, your words are too harsh..."

"Let's go!"

"Huh?"

Out of the blue, Hong Seon-a stood up and grabbed Seo Arin's wrist.

"I have someone to introduce you to, so let's go."

"Who?"

"There is! Someone who will rescue you from that hell!"
