Title: Episode 145 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

To Nigeria

Now that the 9th round has ended.

There are approximately 650,000 players left worldwide.

According to the logic that one in five is trash, there are still 130,000 trash in the world.

"It's not like the world has become safer just because we dealt with the trash of Plseva."

Players who contribute to the world's downfall, like pests, are not helpful.

"To exterminate those bugs and recruit an alchemist, I'm going to Nigeria."

In Nigeria, there is the unique class, the alchemist.

If you can recruit him as an ally, it will be a great help to break through the 20th round.

"It's not just the alchemist that we can gain."

Even the runes obtained in reality can fulfill conditions there.

Various items can be obtained, and you can also raise the name value of a black scythe.

"Alright."

Ryumin, who had packed all his carrier luggage, stood up.

He prepared clothes and necessities, thinking it would take at least a week.

"Hyung, hyung!"

With a quick knock, the door opened with a creak.

His younger brother looked at Ryumin's luggage with surprised eyes.

"Ar- Are you leaving already?"

"Yeah. I'll be back soon."

The night before, he heard about the sudden trip, but Ryuwon didn't expect him to leave so early in the morning.

"Is the destination Japan?"

"Yeah. I've been too tired lately, so I'm going for a week of hot spring travel."

Someone who usually keeps to himself suddenly going on a trip?

Of course, Ryuwon couldn't help but be suspicious of his brother.

"Hyung, did you get a girlfriend? If that's the case, don't hide it and tell me. There's no one to criticize for a couple going on a trip."

"What are you talking about? I'm just going to take a break."

"Really?"

"Yeah."

"Then take me with you."

Ryumin slowly shook his head.

"It's a world where it's hard to even protect one life. It might be dangerous for you to come along."

"Are you really going alone?"

"Yeah, I am."

Ryuwon couldn't ask any further.

He had to trust his brother because he said so.

"I'm sorry to you, but I'll be going. Take care at home until I return. Eat well."

"Don't worry. These days, delivery food is so good."

"If you're short on allowance, let me know right now."

"It's unnecessary. Just go and come back safely."

"Alright, take care. I'm leaving."

Ryuwon looked at his brother, who was leaving with a suitcase, with envy in his eyes.

Clack-clunk—thud.

Until the door closed, Ryuwon couldn't take his eyes off his brother, but his expression quickly turned sulky.

"I also want to go on a hot spring trip...."

He grumbled bluntly, but he understood.

It's still a dangerous world for ordinary people.

Just look at the recent incident at the barbecue restaurant.

"There's nothing we can do. There's nothing wrong with what my brother said."

Although he envied his brother for going out and even going on a hot spring trip, he didn't think it was unfair.

His brother, who had supported himself as a ganger while attending school, deserved some time off.

People need to recharge after working.

"If it weren't for my brother, I probably couldn't have lived in such a luxurious house."

It was just nine months ago when he lived in a shabby one-room apartment, feeling burdened to order a plate of black bean noodles.

It wasn't a time to complain about ordering delivery food.

"My stomach is full. Really, it's full!"

Ryuwon reflected on himself, clutching his head.

"Oh, thinking about it, I want black bean noodles."

I should order it as soon as it's lunchtime.

You never get tired of eating black bean noodles.

When they arrived at the parking lot, Yamti was waiting in front of the Lamborghini.

"You've arrived? Mr. No, Mr. Ryumin?"

"I'm here. Let's go right away."

After putting their suitcases in the trunk, the two of them set off.

On the way to Incheon Airport.

As they entered the highway, Ryumin broke the silence.

"I asked you about the reason for going to Nigeria yesterday."

"Yes."

"Nigeria is a place where various crimes are rampant. The public enemy IS is also stationed there."

"IS, you mean that terrorist group that pursues Islamic extremism?"

"Yeah. Among the people they kidnapped, there's an alchemist I want to make an ally. My goal is to bring out that alchemist."

Ryumin revealed his purpose without hesitation.
ChatGPT

Yamti is, in any case, a slave who unquestionably obeys his own words.

There's no reason to keep it a secret.

Even if he risks death by revealing the information, he will keep it.

"Oh, so you're taking me with you to dominate the alchemist with the enchanting rune."

"No. It's true that I'm taking you because I need the enchanting rune, but I won't use it on the alchemist. If possible, I should leave a place for him."

"What about after that?"

"I have to eliminate the trash and build the Black Scythe's reputation. That's why I acquired the position of CPF's deputy commander."

The deputy commander went to Nigeria and annihilated the public enemy IS organization.

If that fact were known, the name Black Scythe would undoubtedly become famous.

"Oh, so that's why you said you needed a guarantee from the Chief of Police? To leave a record that Black Scythe left the country."

"That's right."

As mentioned, Nigeria is a dangerous country.

The security is not good enough to be classified as travel advisory level 3.

Of course, they wouldn't allow someone to enter for simple tourism.

Unless there's a business or some other purpose.

But what if you could prove that you are strong enough to protect yourself?

Then, entry and exit would be possible.

That's why he moved with the title of CPF's deputy commander.

To pass through immigration easily.

And to leave a record that Black Scythe went to Nigeria.

So, who provides the guarantee for Black Scythe?

"He probably arranged for the Chief of Police to provide it."

Therefore, Ryumin was not worried about the departure inspection.

"Phew. It sounds like it's going to be quite a difficult journey."

"If you find it this difficult, it's not going to work."

Finally, when they arrived at the airport, Ryumin, who had parked the car, transformed his appearance.

Fluttering—

In an instant, he transformed into Lost Yak, and Yamti's eyes widened.

"Wow, you've even grown taller? It's the first time I've seen the owner transform."

"Enough with the admiration. From now on, call me Black Scythe."

"Yes, Lord Black Scythe."

The two of them, with their luggage, found the counter of the chartered flight airline.

"Welcome. Have you booked a chartered flight?"

"Yes. Here's the identification."

Naturally, Ryumin presented Lost Yak's identification.
ChatGPT

Traveling under the identity of Black Scythe required forgery of the identity.

"There's currently one chartered flight on standby. The destination is confirmed to be Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Nigeria... Just a moment."

The staff, who was checking something, handed over the ticket.

"It's confirmed. Here's your ticket. The flight to Nigeria is expected to take 17 hours non-stop. You can go through the security checkpoint, board the plane, and pass through passport control over there."

"Yes, thank you."

Ryumin had one reason for taking President Plseva's chartered plane.

"Because I can save time with a non-stop flight."

Normally, Nigeria can only be reached through layovers, and it usually takes an average of 25 hours.

Rather than wasting all that time in the sky, it was better to take a chartered plane and get there quickly.

After checking in the luggage and receiving the ticket, Ryumin went through the security checkpoint, where he underwent boarding procedures and passport inspection.

"You're going to Nigeria?"

"Yes."

The immigration officer looked at the two of them with a skeptical gaze.

"Nigeria is currently a dangerous area. Are you aware of that?"

"It's okay. I'm the deputy commander of CPF. I've got all the approvals, so please check with the Chief of Police."

"CPF deputy commander...? Just a moment."

The officer left the desk and returned a few minutes later.

"It's confirmed. The Chief of Police vouched that you are indeed the deputy commander of CPF. Since there's no issue with your abilities, both of you can go."

"Is that so?"

"Here are your passports. Enjoy your trip."

Smiling, Ryumin passed through the security checkpoint with Yamti.

Indeed, with the backing of the Chief of Police, they could smoothly pass through even a dangerous area.

A short while later, the two of them boarded the chartered plane without any wait.

There were only two passengers: Ryumin and Yamti.

The captain's voice came over the speakers.

"Welcome. This is Captain Seo Tae-seok. Our plane is a non-stop flight to Murtala Muhammed International Airport, the largest city in Nigeria, Lagos. The flight is expected to take a total of 17 hours. We hope you have a comfortable and enjoyable journey."

Ryumin reclined in the first-class seat, which was adorned like a bed, and comfortably crossed his legs.

"Yamti."

"Yes, Master."
ChatGPT

"Try to get some sleep, or at least rest your eyes. We won't have much time once we arrive."

"Yes, I'll do that."

Ryumin, who had organized his tasks in Nigeria in his mind, closed his eyes.

Soma gradually found its way.

Nigeria is located in West Africa, considered one of the dangerous regions in Africa. The Muslim population, believing in Islam, constitutes about 50%, with the northern region being notorious for Islamic extremists.

The security level is poor, with frequent daytime robberies and continuous organized crime even during the day. Murder, kidnapping, rape, and human trafficking are everyday occurrences in a completely different world.

"A legendary alchemist in a place like this?"

After a 17-hour journey, Ryumin and his party arrived at Murtala Muhammed International Airport and went through immigration. With his age alone, it was evident that he was a player, so they passed through without any issues.

After retrieving their luggage, Ryumin suddenly recalled the advice from the captain when they disembarked from the chartered plane.

"Whatever the reason for visiting Nigeria, be cautious. Especially, never take an airport taxi. Travelers who took them without knowing were threatened and had their belongings taken. Well, you look young, so you probably won't encounter scammers targeting players, but still, it's better to be careful."

It wasn't just empty words or a joke.

Even knowing that he was a player, it was genuinely a dangerous country to the extent that the captain expressed sincere concern.

"Master, where are you going now?"

"First, let's change our appearance. Wait here."

Ryumin, who had prepared tools in advance in his suitcase, entered the airport restroom.

When he came out again, his face had completely changed.

With a few wrinkles added to the face of the somewhat aged Lost Yak, he looked like a typical man in his forties.

"Now, they won't know that we're players."

"What about me?"

"You seem fine as you are."

Yamti had already adorned his face with a makeup technique that made him appear older. It didn't seem necessary to touch it up.

"You should look at least in your thirties to foreign eyes."

"Oh, you're being mean."

Ignoring Yamti's complaints, Ryumin looked around to catch an airport taxi.
ChatGPT

Knowing that taxis everywhere were trying to attract tourists, Ryumin didn't just hail any taxi.

"Not this one, not that one."

Reading the taxi driver's inner thoughts, he wandered around after glancing at the one he chose.

Finally.

"Found it."

Ryumin tapped on the trunk of a taxi.

"Please open it."

"Okay, okay!"

Speaking in English, the taxi driver, who looked to be in his forties, gladly opened the trunk.

After loading their luggage with Yamti, Ryumin got into the back seat.

The taxi driver, with a bright face, asked, "You seem like a tourist, judging by your use of English. Where are you heading?"

"Please go to Ibadan."

"Okay, it'll take about two hours."

During the taxi driver's drive, there were occasional glances in the rearview mirror.

When their eyes met, he smiled brightly and spoke in English.

"Are you from Asia? Which country? China?"

"No, I'm from Korea."

"What brings you to Nigeria?"

"I'm here for business."

"Which company do you work for?"

"Just a small company that sells cleaning products. Nothing significant."

"Well, our country does need cleaning."

Even just turning towards the window revealed a shabby shantytown. Lagos, with over 20 million people, was Nigeria's largest city, but it consistently ranked high in pollution levels.

"Is the lady next to you your girlfriend?"

"She's a colleague."

"Ah, judging by her gaze, it doesn't seem like just colleagues."

As they exchanged trivial conversations, two hours had passed.

Yamti, with an anxious expression, asked Ryumin, "When are we going to arrive?"

"Almost there."

However, even after three hours, the car continued to move.

The taxi driver seemed to sense it but didn't ask. He just said, "Sorry. The traffic is severe, and turning back would take even longer. I'll try my best to speed up."

But the car eventually stopped after an additional two hours.

"We've arrived."

It was already five hours, and they seemed to have reached their destination.

Or so they thought.
