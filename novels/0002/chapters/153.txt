Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 153"

Return

"Our plane is scheduled to arrive at Incheon Airport in 10 minutes."

Ryummin, who had been sleeping with a sleep mask on, subtly took it off.

"Have we arrived?"

Looking over, Yamti's head was twisted like a ghost.

"He seems completely exhausted."

During the four days in Nigeria, he had accomplished quite a lot. He had annihilated dozens of organizations, including human trafficking rings, and even cleared out the headquarters of IS. Along the way, he received grateful thanks from numerous people who had been kidnapped and also acquired the title of "Massacre."

He had collected thousands of items, and in his inventory, there were also hundreds of potions that the IS leader had kept hidden.

"Above all, I was able to completely win over the alchemist without using Yamti's charm."

After his advice, Victor had completely opened up to the Black Scythe. It was unmistakably clear, having read his inner thoughts.

What he gained in Nigeria was not the end here.

"When it becomes known that the Black Scythe has annihilated IS, my reputation will skyrocket like never before."

Everything was perfect and satisfying.

Ryummin, smiling, shook Yamti in the adjacent seat.

"Wake up."

"Ugh, just a little more."

"Using casual speech with the owner? Are you crazy?"

"Hmm? Oh, o-owner?"

Yamti, upon discovering Ryuumin's stern gaze, was taken aback.

"Seeing you speak casually to the owner, it seems your education is lacking."

"S-sorry. I thought it was a dream."

"Just let it slide this time."

"T-thank you. As expected, my generous owner, like the sea!"

"Wipe the drool off your mouth and show some gratitude."

"Ugh."

"We'll be arriving soon. Start organizing your luggage."

"Understood!"

Eventually, the two arrived at the airport.

Including the flight time, the journey had taken exactly one week.

If it hadn't been for the charter plane provided by President Pelseva, it would have taken even longer.

"Yamti, you did well in Nigeria."

"Owner, you've also worked hard."

"Now let's part ways here. You can go home by yourself, right?"
ChatGPT

"Uh... It would be nice if the owner could drop me off."

"You can go alone? Alright then, go ahead."

"Sob. I'll go first. Take care, Master."

Ryummin nodded, went to the parking lot, and changed his appearance inside the car.

Nervously—

Ryummin returned to his original appearance from the Lost Yak.

Shortly after, riding in a Lamborghini, Ryummin opened the front door of his house.

"I'm back."

"Hyung? Hyung!"

His younger brother, who had been casually watching TV at home, greeted him with an intense expression.

"You've returned safely! I was worried!"

"Of course. Where would I go and get beaten up by people?"

"The world is dangerous, you know!"

"Oh."

Come to think of it, his brother only knew him as a fragile prophet class.

He was unaware of his true identity as the Black Scythe, the commander of the CPF unit.

'And I advised him to reveal secrets to Victor while hiding various things from my brother. Isn't this a form of self-indulgence?'

Could there be a more self-indulgent act?

With a self-deprecating smile, Ryummin looked at his brother.

"Did you have a good time while I was away? Nothing happened, right?"

"It did! It was so boring that I almost wished something exciting would happen."

"Don't say things like that even as a joke. Boredom is much better than something urgent happening. That's what peace is."

If he had been born in Nigeria, where crime was rampant, such words wouldn't have come out of his brother's mouth.

'Well, he's still in middle school, so I can understand.'

It's a bit early for him to mature.

"But, Hyung."

"Yeah?"

"Did you bring back anything from Japan? Like souvenirs or..."

"...No."

Ryummin secretly sighed.

Certainly, his brother was still young.

The inventory used by players is quite convenient.

There's no limit to the number of items you can store, and you can instantly find the item you want just by thinking about it.

The fact that Ryummin could immediately take out the items he needed for combinations was also due to this.

"Out of the thousands of items I took from the IS bastards, only 105 are unique materials. With this, I can make dozens of unique equipment and still have some left."

It seemed that the organization members were holding onto these items rather than selling them on the black market.
ChatGPT

When he decides, he can immediately craft, but Ryummin doesn't need unique equipment.

He has already equipped himself with unique and even legendary-grade items.

"Hmm, so many unique materials, but they're useless to me. Oh well."

Strictly speaking, they were not useless.

Not for himself, but for his acquaintances who would go crazy over a single unique item.

"I should make a few and distribute them. Also, share some of the equipment I have."

It might be a self-promotion event, but it was necessary because the survival of his acquaintances was directly linked to Ryummin's survival.

Tap, tap, tap—

Ryummin's fingers were busy.

He had made plans with someone via text.

"Prophet-nim?"

Ma Kyung-rok, who came to the agreed-upon place at Ryummin's call, had to open his surprised eyes.

"What's all this?"

"It's a unique item."

"Oh, no. I can see that from the information, but why...?"

"It hurts my feelings, Representative."

"Yes?"

Ryummin jokingly said to the surprised Ma Kyung-rok.

"What kind of relationship do we have? Aren't we in a shared destiny? Especially since I know even your secret hobbies, Representative Ma. Is sharing items between us a question of 'why'? Aren't you keeping too much distance from me? It feels bitter."

"Ah... no, that's not what I meant. I just asked because it seemed to have another meaning. Please don't misunderstand, Prophet-nim."

Trying to calm down the sweating and nervous Ryummin, Ma Kyung-rok couldn't help but feel truly awkward.

As the difficulty increased, if he deviated from the prophet now, the chances of surviving in the next round would decrease.

"Why are you so tense? It's a joke. A joke."

"Oh? Haha, I thought so, not again..."

Ma Kyung-rok, heaving a sigh of relief, glanced at Ryummin.

It must have been a sight that would have terrified An Sang-cheol.

For Ryummin, it was an unavoidable laughable situation.

'Probably because my prophecies play a significant role for Ma Kyung-rok. Now, it's indispensable.'

Seeing how he disregarded each of his emotions, it seemed the taming process was over.

Having already tasted the flavor of prophecy, Ma Kyung-rok would likely never escape from Ryummin's grasp.
ChatGPT

"To put it bluntly, I've reached the stage where I can control Ma Kyung-rok as I please."

Even if Ryummin were to lie, claiming it's a prophecy, Ma Kyung-rok would probably have no choice but to believe him like solid steel.

For him, the prophecy was almost like the last lifeline.

"I won't be able to tell if that lifeline has rotted or if it's still sturdy. But it must be urgent for me to take such measures."

Ryummin, still smiling at Ma Kyung-rok who was watching him closely, decided to throw him some bait.

He still needed him by his side.

"I will provide information about Round 10."

"Oh, I've been waiting for this. Please go ahead."

Ryummin succinctly shared only the essential information needed for the strategy in Round 10.

"The difficulty increases every multiple of 5 rounds. This 10th round, like the 5th round before it, will only allow a quarter of the players to survive."

"Hmm... a quarter?"

"Yes. After this 10th round, the number of players worldwide will decrease significantly. It's good in a way, as the number of criminals will decrease, but it's not good news for Representative Ma."

"That's right... Players are the customers of our company."

The decrease in the number of players meant a decrease in users of the PPL Market. This was directly opposed to Ma Kyung-rok's goal of aiming for the KOSPI listing.

"Don't worry too much. Haven't I asked you to prepare for times like this?"

"The VVIP system, you mean?"

Considering the decreasing number of players, the company's limitations became apparent. However, just because the customers decreased didn't mean the company was doomed.

The company's survival depended solely on its revenue.

"Upgrade existing members to VVIP, and upgrade first-time trading players to VIP, creating a special atmosphere on the site. Strengthen the existing benefits, shift the focus to the auction system, and by doing so, we can somewhat prevent the decline in revenue. Moreover, unleashing a large quantity of items I have can contribute to expanding the market. It's part of the preparations I made for you. Since it's come up, shall I give them to you?"
ChatGPT

Ryummin pulled out dozens of unique items from his inventory.

With equipment so luxurious that it made a gasp-worthy sound, Ma Kyung-rok swallowed hard.

"W-where did you get all of these...?"

"I made them. I knew the recipes by foreseeing the future."

"And the materials...?"

"How? Don't you have materials prepared day and night by eliminating criminals, thanks to Representative Ma? I made them with those. I had some materials of my own too."

"Oh..."

In reality, the materials provided by Ma Kyung-rok were barely enough, but he had no way of knowing that.

He didn't have any interest in knowing.

Right now, Ma Kyung-rok's attention was solely focused on the unique equipment.

"I've prepared everything for the Representative, Director Ahn, Manager Seo, and even for your fiancée to use."

"To go this far... Thank you very much. Should I give you gold through the trading function for this...?"

Ryummin wanted to retort with, 'Don't say things I'm not sincere about,' but he held back.

Instead, he just smiled graciously and waved his hand, emitting a gentle laugh akin to Gandhi.

"Take it all. I don't want anything in return."

"Oh... Thank you so much, Prophet-nim."

Even though Ryummin could sense the inner thoughts questioning the sincerity of this gesture, he didn't feel bad about it.

At least the gratitude expressed towards him was genuine.

"Min! I saved a seat for you here!"

Ryummin approached Minjuri with a smile as she waved at him from a cafe.

"It's been a while. Oh? Did you already order mine too?"

"Yeah. Double espresso with an extra shot, right?"

"Hehe, that's correct."

Now that they met regularly every month, they knew everything about each other.

'Not that our relationship should progress any further.'

Ryummin, aware of Minjuri's feelings, had no intention of starting a romantic relationship in these times.

'Above all, I've never experienced emotions beyond friendship.'

However, Minjuri's heart fluttered every time she saw him.

Especially seeing herself, small and not particularly handsome.

'First love is like magic. Maybe it's written in the stars.'

In a way, it was a fortunate event.
ChatGPT

As captivating as she may be, it was essential to avoid getting entangled with her, especially since he couldn't control her with the enchanting rune.

"Are you calling me again to share another prophecy, Prophet-nim?"

"What else would it be, Buffer-nim?"

After chuckling, the two of them sipped their coffee and engaged in conversation. Typically, when Ryummin talked about prophecies, Minjuri would nod along, listening attentively.

"The competition will be fierce. Since only a quarter can secure a spot, everyone will be rushing to complete as many quests as possible within the limited time."

"I see. It's going to be intense competition?"

"I know a few low-difficulty quests, so remember them. If you prioritize those, you should easily make it into the top ranks."

Ryummin shared exclusive tips with Minjuri, focusing on helping her pass. Since they would each have to move separately in Round 10, he wanted to ensure she had the necessary guidance.

"Got it. These tips are so valuable that they're worth paying for. Thanks!"

"Don't make it a big deal."

"Should I give you some gold? We have the trading feature now."

"Enough. You're saying the same thing as someone else."

"Huh? Someone else?"

"Yeah. Anyway, let's focus on the round..."

At that moment, Ryummin's phone chimed.

It was an alert for an article from a subscribed news agency.

"Huh? What's this?"

"Oh. I got an alert that an article has been published..."

Ryummin, looking at his smartphone in silence, feigned a surprised expression.

"Wow, there's a sensational article here."

"What is it, what is it?"

"Check the portal site right now. It's all over the news."

Curious, Minjuri also glanced at her phone.

She couldn't help but be surprised.

The main headline featured news of the leader of ISIS committing suicide.
