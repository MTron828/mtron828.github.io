Title: Episode 310 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Qualification of the Demon Lord

66 hours ago.

When Ryu Min used the newly acquired skill, "Qualification of the Demon," he could arrive at a familiar place.

"This is... the Demon Lord's castle."

As written in the explanation, he warped to the Demon Lord's castle.

It was a place he had visited during the 18th round, so it was not an unfamiliar location.

"At that time, I defeated the guards and Cerberus."

Perhaps that's why the inside of the Demon Lord's castle was eerily quiet.

There was neither a single demon in sight nor the sound of ants crawling.

Suddenly, a glaring message caught his eye.

[You have left your position during the round.] [If you do not return to the designated location within 1 hour, your player qualification will be revoked.] [Time remaining until qualification revocation: 00:59:59]

"Alright, alright. I'll go back."

Returning wasn't difficult; all he had to do was use the warp function again.

However, instead of warping, Ryu Min took a step somewhere else.

He hadn't come here just to test how well the skill worked.

"I obtained information through Fluonictos's thoughts."

Thud, thud.

Ryu Min's steps suddenly came to a halt.

"Sitting on this throne can make one the Demon Lord."

In front of Ryu Min was a flaming throne.

It was a place where a devilish high-ranking demon had sat, and it was enormous.

Ryu Min's goal was precisely this throne of the Demon Lord.

"I became a god, can't I become a Demon Lord too?"

Of course, not just anyone could become a Demon Lord.

One needed qualifications like the nobility of the demon realm, and they had to undergo a test to determine if they were a suitable vessel for the Demon Lord.

Ryu Min had the qualifications, thanks to his skill, which provided treatment equivalent to that of demon nobility.

"If I pass that test, I can become the Demon Lord, right?"

Ryu Min, who considered becoming a Demon Lord as trivial as gaining a title when bored, thought it wasn't a big deal.

"Shall I see what's happening in that test?"

With such thoughts, Ryu Min sat on the throne.

Well, to be more accurate, it was more like he ascended.

The chair was giant enough for a giant to sit in.

[Player 'Black Scythe' has taken a seat on the Demon Lord's throne.] [Exploring eligibility to challenge for the Demon Lord's position.]

......

[Conditions have been met.] [Testing for the qualification of the Demon Lord will commence immediately.]

└ Protect the Demon Lord's throne for 30 minutes.

└ Success will lead to ▶ Ascension to Demon Lord

[A message has been relayed to all demon nobles.] [Shortly, demon nobles will come to disturb the claimant of the Demon Lord's throne.] [Do not leave the throne during the specified time.] [Immediate departure results in disqualification as a Demon Lord candidate and revocation of noble status.]

'The message has been relayed to all demon nobles?'

It seems that demons have received the message and are coming to check if the challenger is qualified.

As expected, within a minute of arriving through the portal, a demon has arrived.

It was a demon clad in armor, riding a giant crocodile.

"What's this? I thought the Demon Lord's challenge was finally happening, but it's just a mere human?"

Seemingly surprised by the presence of a human, the demon widened his eyes.

Other demons shared similar sentiments.

"Huh? What? A human?" "Why is a human here?" "This is ridiculous." "How can a human take the Demon Lord's qualification test?" "This doesn't make sense."

Demons that arrived one after another each uttered a word.

Doubtful demons, grumbling demons, mocking demons, demons showing hostility, and more.

Numerous demons gathered in front of the Demon Lord's throne.

Their numbers quickly exceeded 60.

"Exactly 62, so did everyone from rank 11 to 72 come?"

Perhaps annoyed even by Ryu Min's muttering, the demons shouted with angry faces.

"What are you babbling about?" "Human. Can't you get down from that seat immediately?" "How dare an inferior human occupy a sacred position, worse than a maggot?"

Despite facing various accusations, Ryu Min only responded with a mocking smile.

"This is fun. So-called nobles who don't even have the courage to challenge first? The future of the demon realm looks bleak."

"What did you just say?" "This human scum!"

The demon who was shouting stepped down from the crocodile he was riding.

It was the demon who had arrived in armor initially.
ChatGPT

[Demon noble ranked 19th, Saleos, will test your qualification!]

"Do you have to introduce yourself like that? Can't you just attack right away?"

"You arrogant human!"

Saleos leaped forward.

Swoosh!

As he soared towards the Demon Lord's castle, the weapon he wielded split into two before even swinging.

Thud, thud, thud...

Contrary to the momentum, the result was underwhelming.

Although nothing was demonstrated, it was not a meaningless death for the demons who were watching.

"W-What just happened?"

"I didn't see the attack..."

"Formidable demon Saleos ended up like that so effortlessly..."

A sense of alertness arose in the demons' hearts, unlike before.

Of course, only a few felt this way, as most demons did not grasp what had happened.

They just stared with eyes of incomprehension.

"Who's next? Who else will challenge?"

"...."

"Surely, none of you are scared of a mere human?"

Ryu Min's provocation seemed effective as one demon stepped forward.

[Demon noble ranked 22nd, Ifos. Challenges the foolish human.]

With a dignified face, Ifos, claiming to bring disaster, leaped onto the throne.

"You are not qualified to be the Demon Lord!"

However, those words became Ifos's last words.

As soon as he finished speaking, Ryu Min's scythe cut through Ifos's waist.

Thunk...

"Next."

No skills were used, and no intricate maneuvers were executed.

It was just a simple horizontal cut, but the demons were on edge.

The brutal outcome spoke for itself.

Yet, not everyone seemed affected. A demon in a purple robe stepped forward.

"You fools, cowering at a mere human."

Boldly, the demon soared into the sky and looked down at Ryu Min with disdain.

"I am Gusion, ranked 11th, fitting for the throne of the Demon Lord. That's an undeniable fact. It's not a place for the likes of you humans."

"Do you see me sitting in that seat with your eyes?"

"Shut up!"

Gusion used magic in line with his attire.
ChatGPT

The dark sorcerer summoned something as pitch-black as a black arrow, and the number exceeded a whopping 50.

As a result, the demons watching had no doubt that Gusion would tear apart the limbs of the human.

However, it was Gusion himself whose limbs were being torn apart.

Crackle!

[Screaaaam!]

The scythe flashed at an invisible speed, and before the arms and legs could swing, only the torso remained, torn apart.

Thud-

The black arrows that were weaving through the air vanished, leaving only the torso without limbs at Ryu Min's feet.

Gusion, with terror-stricken eyes, looked up at the Demon Lord candidate.

"S-Spare me..."

Thump!

Ryu Min kicked away Gusion, who had been instantly killed by a pierced heart, and said with a dry voice.

"Next."

Protecting the Demon Lord's throne for 30 minutes was not difficult.

After Gusion, numerous demons challenged, but the results were the same.

If the top-ranking noble had suffered defeat, what chance did those below have?

The outcome was obvious.

"All of them are below par. I need to reorganize the rankings."

Ryu Min felt a bit disappointed.

He had hoped there might be at least one decent opponent, but all the demons were of the caliber that would only induce yawns.

Considering that these creatures were taking up various positions as nobles, it seemed like the demon realm was in a rather chaotic state.

"You."

[Yes?]

Pointing at one of the remaining nobles, Ryu Min asked.

"What's your rank among them? You seem to be the strongest among the few left."

A demon with a leopard's face and griffin's wings spoke with a determined expression.

[Rank 12. My name is Citri...]

"Aren't you going to challenge?"

To that absurd question, Citri turned his gaze to the surroundings as if saying, "Look around."

Among the high-ranking nobles that were initially 62, only ten remained.

If that's the case, would he dare to challenge someone like Ryu Min?

It was almost like asking if he wanted to die quickly.

[I... I want to live.]

"Is that so? It's a wise judgment. I don't want to kill anymore either. It's too weak, to the point where I feel guilty now."

[...]
Demons knew that those words were not mere boasting.

It wasn't because the human in front of them had defeated 52 demons.
ChatGPT

However, despite that, the true extent of his abilities had not been revealed, as not even a single breath sound wavered.

'Even without revealing his true power, he's at this level. How powerful would he be when he really exerts his strength...'

Demons remained silent, knowing this fact.

Even if the opponent was a human.

Of course, despite appearing human, Ryu Min was, in reality, nothing less than a deity.

"Oh? The time is up."

As Ryu Min's words ended abruptly,

[The allotted time has elapsed.] [By safeguarding the Demon Lord's throne within the time limit, you have proven your qualification as the Demon Lord.]

The message appeared, and flames akin to fervor enveloped Ryu Min's body.

[The Demon Lord's throne welcomes a new owner.] [You acquire the title 'Ruler of the Demon Realm.'] [Title - Ruler of the Demon Realm]

Acquisition Condition: Safeguard the Demon Lord's throne for 30 minutes.

Effect: Gain the position of Demon Lord and the ability to rule the Demon Realm.

[You have become the Demon Lord.] [You can now rule the Demon Realm.] [All denizens of the Demon Realm will obey your commands unconditionally.]

After a moment, the flames of the throne blazed brightly and then diminished.

Gradually shrinking, it transformed into a throne that perfectly matched Ryu Min's physique.

[We humbly acknowledge the ascension of the new Demon Lord!] [We humbly acknowledge!]

The nobles who had been observing Ryu Min until a moment ago bowed their heads.

Although only ten nobles remained, receiving a polite greeting made it feel like becoming the boss of an organized crime group.

"Okay, that's enough."

Feeling burdened by the greetings, Ryu Min raised his head after ordering to cease them and shifted his gaze elsewhere.

In the direction he looked, there was a message.

A message worthy of joy.

[As a reward for achieving Demon Lord status, 'Branch of Inferno' has been obtained.] [As a reward for achieving Demon Lord status, the temporary skill 'Demonic Qualification' has transformed into 'Demon Lord's Qualification.'] [Branch of Inferno]

Classification: Weapon

Grade: Eternal

Attack Power: 6,666

Effect: Engulfs the soul in flames.

Durability: Infinite

Usage Restriction: Black Scythe (Soul-bound)

Description: A whip that only those who have obtained the Demon Lord's qualification can use. A weapon that can burn souls.

'Eternal grade. This seems pretty good, doesn't it?'
ChatGPT

The advantage of Eternal weapons is that they can be used alongside god-grade items.

Ryu Min immediately tried wearing the item.

Swoosh-

The scythe appeared in a form enveloped in crimson flames.

Using the whip together, he definitely felt a stronger sensation.

'Good thing I didn't have any Eternal weapons before. This turned out well.'

In addition to this, the temporary skill 'Demonic Qualification' was enhanced to 'Demon Lord's Qualification.'

The other effects remained the same, with an addition of [Stat points increase upon killing a celestial being].

'Nice, nice. This is how it should feel to be a Demon Lord.'

Ryu Min grinned, raising the corners of his mouth. If he were to simply dominate the Demon Realm, he would have been disappointed.

Whether it was the system's influence or not, Ryu Min's grin seemed intimidating, causing the demon nobles to flinch.

Seeing their reaction, Ryu Min stopped grinning and looked at the nobles who stood in line.

"Why are you looking at me like that? Do I look crazy?"

[No, Your Majesty. Not at all.]

The demons couldn't help but tremble with fear. It was understandable, given that a being who mercilessly slew dozens of demons was right in front of them.

"You're not thinking of betraying me, right?"

[Of course not! How could we ever do such a thing?]

Ryu Min silently read the thoughts of the demons. As the system said, there seemed to be no falseness in their absolute obedience and loyalty.

"Alright. Trust is mutual."

[Thank you.]

"Demon nobles, is this all of you?"

[Yes, Your Majesty.]

"Line up in order starting from here."

Following Ryu Min's command, the demons looked at each other and formed a line according to their ranks.

"Did you say you were ranked 12th, Citri?"

[Yes? Yes!]

"From now on, you're first. You're second, and you're third. Like this, in order up to the tenth."

Since there were only ten high-ranking demons, it was a natural promotion in rank.

[Your grace is magnifice...]

"Don't use that historical drama tone. Tsk."

[Th-thank you, Your Majesty.]

The grateful demons, whether sincerely or not, were of no interest to Ryu Min.

His focus was solely on one thing.

"I have a command to give."

[Yes! Please give us your command, Your Majesty!]

Ryu Min smiled and said, "Is there anything for humans to eat here?"

[What?]

"I'm hungry. Bring me something to eat."

It was his first command as the newly crowned Demon Lord.
