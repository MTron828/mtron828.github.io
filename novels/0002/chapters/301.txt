Title: Episode 301 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Command Function

"Repeat what you said earlier. What were you planning to do?"

In response to the question from the Black Scythe, the three individuals hesitated and struggled to speak.

"Why are you silent like a mute? Doesn't my question make sense?"

"Oh, sorry."

It wasn't until he let out a bit of breath that the scholar finally spoke, but he was too flustered to know what to say.

'Damn it, why did the Black Scythe suddenly appear?'

It wasn't detected even with perception abilities.

Not even the sound of small footsteps.

Just standing there like a ghost when I turned my head.

'I hope he didn't hear anything.'

Even in the midst of pounding excitement, the scholar, who regained his composure, finally opened his mouth.

The words he spoke to stay alive were nothing more than excuses.

"Oh, what did we say just now... Ha-ha."

"It seems like you were planning to do something nasty to Krisia."

"Ha-ha, you must have heard it wrong."

"Are you blaming my ears now?"

Although the scholar's liver shrank at the sharp, crimson voice, he couldn't retreat like this.

The moment they admitted it, their throats were at risk.

Is it possible that the Black Scythe didn't hear it?

"N-no, it's not like that. We really didn't say such things..."

"Approaching Krisia with a friendly attitude under the pretext of gratitude, planning to take advantage of her lack of combat ability, and eventually getting rid of her. Did you think I wouldn't know that?"

At the piercing words, the gazes of the three chilled.

The faces that were just confused a moment ago were gone, replaced by terrifying expressions as if they were about to commit murder.

Shlick-

As if they had made a promise, the three drew their swords simultaneously, and when they glared at him with eyes full of vitality, Ryumin let out a small chuckle.

"No need to be so tense. I have no intention of killing you."

"...."

"To be honest, you haven't done anything wrong, have you? You were planning to commit a crime, but you haven't actually committed it."

"Then... you won't attack us?"

"Of course not. Do I look like a murderer who kills anyone without reason?"

As if reassuring them to lower their weapons, he waved his hand, but the players couldn't easily let go of their guard.

Because of the thought that he might suddenly launch a surprise attack while saying that.

"Stop lowering your weapons? You don't even have the confidence to defeat me with the three of you together."

"That's uncertain. Long or short, that remains to be seen..."

That's when it happened.

Roaaar!

An ogre, having spotted multiple prey, charged from behind Ryumin.

Thud, thud, thud!

As Ryumin turned his head, the creature rushing from behind raised its hand as if about to grab his head.

A life-or-death moment.

Roaaar?

As soon as the ogre caught Ryumin's gaze, it stopped its actions.

It subtly lowered the raised hand and even took a step back.

A completely frightened appearance.

The players who were in their positions looked surprised by this strange sight.

It was the first time they had seen a monster instill fear in a human.

Ryumin, the only one who knew the reason, maintained a calm expression.

"Having the title of Dragon Slayer does make things easier."

The title that instinctively made monsters feel fear.

Thanks to that, Ryumin could easily kill the ogre.

Swish!

With just one swing of the scythe, the ogre was cut in half.

Although it was just one swing, the effect was significant.

The three individuals swallowed their saliva due to the tension.

Gulp-

The damage dealt by cutting down the ogre in one go was impressive, but more surprising was that there were no visible preparatory movements for the attack.

The reason the three were tense was because of this.

"What did I say earlier? You only know if it's long or short after experiencing it."

"...."

"If you want to challenge, I'll accept. I don't want to kill you if possible, but well, if dying is your wish..."

"No, no, it's not."

"No, no. We want to live."

As he approached with the scythe raised, the three trembled.

"I'll do anything if you spare us."

"Yes, that's right. Just give us any orders."

Responding with a threatening posture, Ryumin just snorted.

"Why should I trust you with anything?"

"Please trust us. If you spare us, we'll do anything, even lick the soles of your feet..."

"Get rid of that filthy talk. If you have ears, listen. When did I say I'd kill you? I said I'll spare you. I don't want to kill meaninglessly."
ChatGPT

The three people's eyes sparkled at the words "spare you."

"Really?"

"But."

Ryumin's eyes suddenly turned violet.

[Using the Command Function.]

"All three of you must obey my orders."

After giving the command, the players nodded their heads.

"Understood."

"We'll follow your instructions."

"We'll do our best."

"Alright then. You can go now. Perform as I instructed."

"Understood."

Though he added a casual remark, Ryumin knew.

That they would properly carry out the orders he had given.

After all, he had used the [Command] function, a feature unlocked at max level, on them.

'The Command Function is quite useful when leading players who don't listen.'

It's a function that allows anyone to follow one's commands like dominance.

In a way, it had a similar effect to dominance, but there was a clear difference.

'The biggest difference is that it doesn't work on opponents with the same level.'

While dominance works on players of the same level, commands can only be given to lower-level individuals

Having checked the tracking list to determine whom to approach, Ryumin stepped on thin air and leaped.

Immediately after.

Kwaaaaang-!

A sonic boom shook the forest, erupting in the sky.

Swish- Swish!

While moving with Seoarin and Danimir, Minjuri realized one thing.

'This Summoner... is stronger than I thought.'

Seeing the Soul Knight handling the Dark Ancient Tree alone somehow made her feel small.

Truly powerful to the extent that there was practically no need for a legion of subordinates.

It might be due to the strengthening from her buffs.

At that moment, the eyes of Minjuri and Seoarin met in the empty space.

However, both of them avoided each other's gaze without saying a word.

Even though they had temporarily formed an alliance, there was still a cautious atmosphere between them.

That's when it happened.

[Tenth death has occurred.] [The deceased's nickname is 'Buljoa.'] [Since 10 minutes have passed postmortem, the player will be annihilated.] [Current remaining players: 133] [Players annihilated: 10] [Time remaining until the end of the round: 70:52:08]

Already the tenth death.

It was hard to comprehend that so many had died in just an hour.

Feeling frustrated, Minjuri muttered.

"We trusted each other and relied on each other. I don't understand why everyone's so eager to kill each other."

"I don't know? I have an idea, though."

At Seoarin's words, Minjuri looked at her as if demanding an answer.

"You have an idea?"

"Do you not know, Minjuri? Even just looking at us. Until a month ago, we were colleagues, and now, what about us? We're throwing cold glares at each other."

"But still, I don't understand why they want to kill each other."

"It's probably a sign that we haven't trusted each other for a long time."

"That's true. I also got burned by a trusted axe."

When Minjuri spoke without yielding, Seoarin looked at her with a suspicious expression.

"Are you saying I betrayed you?"

"No? You, who were my neighbor, stabbed me in the back."

"Ryumin's not even yours, yet... Really, anyone who sees it might think you're a husband-stealing homewrecker."

"What...?"

In the chilly atmosphere, an unexpected voice echoed.

"The atmosphere here is quite intense."
ChatGPT

Silently descending from the sky was the entity the two of them had been so eager to obtain â€“ the Black Scythe.

Of course, Minjuri still didn't know that the Black Scythe was Ryumin.

"Lord Black Scythe?"

"Oh, surprised you, huh?"

Although the sudden appearance surprised the two, they quickly displayed delighted expressions. However, Ryumin couldn't smile.

'Why do these two have to be together?'

Like with Kristin, Ryumin felt the need to protect Minjuri and had assigned slaves for that purpose. But the person Ryumin had assigned to protect Minjuri wasn't Seoarin.

Would he attach someone to her, knowing it's obvious they would fight over him?

Especially in the anxious situation where they might aim knives at each other.

'When I ordered to protect Minjuri right after the round started, where is she? Could she still not have arrived?'

As the slave he ordered couldn't be seen, he checked the tracking list and, sure enough, noticed the distance was gradually decreasing.

It seemed they had just arrived, probably because the starting point was far.

"Lord Black Scythe. What brings you here?"

"Did you come to receive buffs by any chance?"

"Well, that's part of it, but I was a bit worried."

While expressing skepticism at Ryumin's words, Minjuri still proceeded to cast buffs on him. Seoarin, feeling a subtle jealousy at her kind gesture, approached Ryumin with a smiling face.

"Did you come because you were worried about me?"

"Not really."

"...Then, is it because you're worried about Lady Minju?"

Before Ryumin spoke, he glanced at Seoarin. Though he stared at her with deer-like eyes, as if pleading her not to say it, he had no intention of lying.

"Being a supporter, there's no choice but to worry. If you encounter an ogre, it's obvious you'll be in a bind."

"Ah... I see."

Seoarin lowered her head, seemingly disappointed, but she also understood what she didn't know. With Minjuri possessing the cheating skill Bless, she must be an invaluable asset to Black Scythe.

"By the way, did anything happen between you two?"

"No, nothing happened."

"Why do you think something happened?"

Minjuri's question was natural since she didn't equate Black Scythe with Ryumin. But Ryumin, knowing that Minjuri and Seoarin both liked him, knew that the relationship between the two wasn't good.
ChatGPT

"Their relationship seems oddly strained."

"It's okay. Lord Black Scythe didn't have anything to worry about."

Having reassured Seoarin, Ryumin also nodded. However, it wasn't like he wouldn't take precautions.

Incidentally, his insurance had arrived.

"Ah, they're coming over there."

At Ryumin's gesture, both women turned their heads simultaneously.

There stood none other than Slave No. 1, Yantti.

"Haak, haak. Sorry. I'm a bit late, aren't I?"

"Not a bit, but very late."

"Why are you here, Yantti?"

"Lord Black Scythe summoned me."

In response to the two women's questions, Ryumin nodded.

"The more companions, the safer."

"Then... Are the three of us going together?"

"And Lord Black Scythe?"

"I have things to do, so I need to go back."

In reality, Yantti was more of an observer in their relationship than a companion.

Ryumin whispered to Yantti.

-Yantti, mediate between them so they don't fight.

-Don't worry.

With that assurance, Ryumin looked at the two women who were making uneasy expressions.

"If you walk straight ahead, you'll reach the Twin Canyon. We agreed to meet other comrades there, so don't take a different path and keep going."

"Ah, understood."

"Yes..."

"Now that I've confirmed the safety of both of you, I should be on my way. Yantti, take good care of them."

"Yes, Lord Black Scythe."

Ryumin, as if relieved, smiled and soared into the sky, disappearing with a sonic boom.

"Sisters, shall we depart now?"

As Yantti smiled, Minjuri and Seoarin, with awkward expressions, followed.
