Title: "Chapter 253 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

Integration

Ryumin received a message that foreign players he had rescued wished to join.

Although saving their lives seemed to have a positive effect, Ryumin's thoughts were different.

"They probably realized it too late. That sticking with me increases their chances of survival."

Seeing him take care of the Death Sect in the 15th round likely increased their desire to join even more.

There might be a willingness to join in the hope of learning strategies for the next round.

"Anyway, it's a good thing. There's nothing better than integrating all players into the Death Sect."

In the future, cooperation in quests would be crucial, and uniting players was important.

The Death Sect would be an invaluable means for that.

"I wonder how many have come?"

When Ryumin entered the Death Sect's front yard, everyone's attention focused on him.

It was not common for someone to walk around in a white mask in reality.

"Oh, it's Master Black Scythe!"

"Master Black Scythe!"

Due to extensive exposure in the media, people recognized him just by the mask.

"Leader Heo."

"You're here? Master Black Scythe."

"Why are there so many people? Didn't you say there were only ten on the phone?"

"There have been more since then. Haha..."

Roughly twenty people were in the yard.

They were players with various nationalities.

"Alright, let's proceed with the interviews."

"Understood."

Since Hur Tae-seok quickly turned away, Ryumin had no chance to read his thoughts.

He simply sat in the designated spot in the yard and conducted the interviews.

"Those who wish to join, please line up."

In response to Eom Jun-seok's words, people moved swiftly.

"Nice to meet you, I am Elder Eom Jun-seok. We will provide you with membership forms. Please read them carefully, check the agreement, and sign it. Also, if you could provide basic information, we would appreciate it."

People who diligently filled out the forms lined up in front of the man in the black mask.

Ryumin spoke with fluent English pronunciation.

"Do you want to join the Death Sect?"

"Yes!"

"Why?"
ChatGPT

"I was impressed by the sacrifice Master Black Scythe showed in the last round. I thought that if it's him, I can trust and follow without hesitation, so I decided to support him without delay..."

The man elaborated on his reasons, but there was a separate underlying motive.

I have to attach myself to Black Scythe to survive.

Even though Ryumin knew his true intentions, he did not reject him.

Attaching oneself to a strong individual for survival was a very human response.

"Permission granted for membership."

"Th-thank you!"

Seeing that the person seemed decent, Ryumin allowed it coolly.

"Next."

While conducting interviews one by one, new players continued to arrive.

As soon as they opened their eyes, they appeared in a line like sausages, as if they had taken a flight to Korea.

"It seems they felt a considerable sense of crisis after experiencing the 15th round."

Since an increase in members was a good thing, Ryumin conducted interviews without complaints.

Two days passed in this manner.

Ryumin informed his younger brother that he would be staying out and started living at the Death Sect.

Taking breaks only when necessary, he continued interviews while staying overnight.

By the third day, the number of new members had exceeded 150.

"Since it's already like this, it would be nice if only 25 more came."

With 25 more, players from all over the world would have joined.

Above all, among them were the High Mage Alex and the Divine Archer Dorothy.

"I want to take at least those two with me..."

He briefly considered that they might not come, but quickly dismissed the thought.

"No, they have to come. If I want to survive the next round."

Ryumin waited patiently.

It wasn't until the sun had crossed its zenith that the players appeared.

"Is this the Death Sect?"

"Yes, it is. Are you here to join?"

"Yes. Could I possibly meet Master Black Scythe?"

"Of course. Please fill out this membership form, and you can have a one-on-one interview with Master Black Scythe."

The man who filled out the form handed the documents to Ryumin.

As Ryumin read the personal information, his pupils shook slightly.

[Name: Alex Pearson] [Nickname: Alex] [Nationality: Germany] [Level: 69] [Otherworldly Occupation: High Mage] [Age: Exactly 25] [Date of Birth: September 24, 1997] [Intention to Join: For survival.]

"This person is the High Mage Alex?"
ChatGPT

A chubby figure with glasses.

It was quite different from the agile appearance in the otherworld, and it surprised me inwardly.

"Your nickname is Alex?"

"Yes."

"Why do you want to join the Death Sect?"

"I'll be honest. I think my chances of survival would be higher if I were with Master Black Scythe."

People shouldn't be judged solely by appearance.

Although his appearance and physique seemed perpetually lazy, the determination shown in his eyes was clear.

Alex's talent was unquestionable.

"Understood. You're accepted."

"...."

Alex looked at Ryumin with a dazed expression, surprised by the quicker acceptance than he expected.

"What are you waiting for? Make room for the person behind you."

"Oh, um, can I ask one question before that?"

Seeing the earnestness in his eyes, it seemed to be a question he had been curious about for a long time.

"Go ahead."

"I want to know the reason you called out to me in the 15th round."

"Well, you're a talent surviving up to the 18th round."

He couldn't bring himself to say the words exactly as they were in his mind.

He was not the prophet now, but rather Black Scythe.

"Just."

"Yes?"

"I just noticed you. That's all."

"Oh...."

Though surprised, he didn't seem disappointed when Ryumin read his thoughts.

It's a bit disappointing. I wondered if there was a reason, but it was nothing special?

Accepting that he had been mistaken, he thought positively.

Whether in the past or present, Alex was someone with no issues in character.

"Thank you for your answer. Then, good luck. We'll meet again."

"Sure."

After Alex left, Ryumin interviewed a few more people.

Then, he met someone he had been anticipating.

[Name: Dorothy Clayton] [Nickname: Dorothy] [Nationality: Netherlands] [Level: 69] [Otherworldly Occupation: Archer] [Age: Exactly 22] [Date of Birth: December 24, 2000] [Intention to Join: Respecting Master Black Scythe.]

"Indeed, she came. Dorothy, the archer who survived up to the 18th round."

Unlike High Mages, the Archer class is a common profession.

Not only is it not the only class, but it also belongs to a higher proportion, such as warriors or assassins.
ChatGPT

"But that makes it even more impressive. Handling a bow, a weapon unfamiliar to ordinary people. It's something they've never encountered in their entire lives. But if they advance to become an archer, there's nothing to worry about. The first thing they receive in celebration of their advancement is the [Sniper's Rune]. 'The Sniper's Rune significantly increases accuracy when handling a bow. Anyone who becomes an archer becomes a sniper.'"

But even with increased accuracy, it doesn't reach 100%. It improves skills instantly, like a professional archer, but accuracy is still an individual's responsibility. That's why the archer class is both popular and challenging. To survive up to the 18th round in such a profession? It's not an ordinary talent. Perhaps that's why she earned the nickname "Divine Archer."

"Accepted."

"Yes? Uh, you didn't ask me anything?"

"I know."

Even without asking, he can understand. Because with the rune of inner thoughts, he can dissect a person's every detail.

"First impression, you're accepted, Dorothy. You can be happy."

"T-thank you."

She was just stunned Dorothy.

After that, the interviews proceeded swiftly.

In just three days, all 175 people Ryumin saved joined the Death Sect.

In a way, players from all over the world have entered the Death Sect.

"It worked out well. Very well."

From now on, it's crucial. He has to conquer the rounds while keeping his people alive as much as possible.

As soon as the last person who joined left the Death Sect, Hur Tae-seok and Eom Jun-seok approached.

"Thank you for your hard work, Master Black Scythe."

"Yeah. Master Heo, you've done well too, Elder Eom Jun-seok."

"Thank you, Master Black Scythe."

For a moment, Hur Tae-seok's gaze changed strangely, but Ryumin had already turned his head.

"I'm going back now. Take a break until you contact me."

"Understood. Take care."

"Yeah."

After spreading his wings behind him, he soared high into the sky.

On his way home, Ryumin, with a sudden thought, landed briefly on the rooftop of a nearby building.

"I should meet Minjoo. I can't keep things awkward forever."

He needs to improve their relationship as quickly as possible.

They should return to being friends without any awkwardness, just like before.
ChatGPT

That way, there won't be any disruptions in the strategy.

Tap, tap, tap -

Quickly sending a message with his fingers, he received a reply.

[Minjoo: Sure, let's meet.]

Seeing the brief reply, a slightly uneasy feeling crept in.

'Why not ease the awkwardness and maybe craft some items together?'

He rummaged through his inventory.

Especially since he had to use the Infinite Material Pouch anyway.

'Without Aether, it's challenging to make God-tier items, but she might appreciate a Legendary item at least.'

His Luck stat was excessively high, so undoubtedly, good materials would come out.

[You have used the Infinite Material Pouch.] [Congratulations! 5 material items have been obtained!] [Items will be added to your inventory!]

Ryumin, who quickly checked the materials, chuckled.

'Instead of Legendary, I got a bunch of unknown materials, huh?'

He hadn't even obtained God-tier materials.

In this situation, he couldn't immediately craft a Legendary item.

'Oh well.'

Putting the disappointment behind him, Ryumin flew to the agreed meeting place.

Kururik -

The door to the dimensional information repository opened.

[Welcome, Micael.] [Greetings from the Akashic Records.]

Micael's expression wasn't pleasant as he visited the Akashic Records after a long time.

[There's a problem.] [Is it because of the Devil's Resurrection Scroll?] [You know well.] [Seems the wrath of the gods is bothering you.] [No.]

Micael firmly shook his head.

The wrath of the gods can be appeased if released again.
ChatGPT

[That's fine. The issue is that the gods hope Black Scythe will be brought in before the 18th round.] [Since the Devil General Plunictos has a pretext to intervene, it's a natural reaction. From the gods' perspective, there's nothing more unpleasant than him stepping forward.] [Is there no way?] [....] [Claiming to have devised a plan, we skipped the 15th round. There are no more excuses. If we continue to delay, Gabriel and Raphael will become suspicious.] [There's no choice. We have to launch an attack on Black Scythe in the 16th round.] [Including me?] [What would you do, Micael? Pretend to be attacked by Black Scythe and then come back?] [....] [If even Micael fails, the gods will be suspicious. For now, send Gabriel and Raphael.] [Both of them, not just one?] [Raphael is not a combat angel, so we have no choice but to send both of them, right?] [Even so, with those two, it would be an almost invincible combination, wouldn't it?] [Don't worry. Considering Black Scythe's skill, even if it's the two of them, they should be able to handle it.]

Micael's expression showed a hint of surprise.

[Is he that strong? The current Black Scythe?] [Yes. After killing numerous angels all this time, isn't it time to believe in it?] [That may be true, but Gabriel and Raphael are skilled in a different league compared to other Archangels. There's a chance Black Scythe might... perish.]

Lubahi laughed silently.

[Trust Black Scythe. What Micael worries about will never happen.]
