Title: Episode 295 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Have a Good Time.

Seoarin, lying on the bed, tossed and turned.

Lately, she couldn't sleep.

It was because of too many lingering thoughts.

And the cause of those lingering thoughts was none other than the Black Scythe.

'The Black Scythe was the Prophet...'

When Yumti knew that the Black Scythe was an acquaintance, she honestly felt jealous.

It was Seoarin's wish to meet at least once in reality.

'But we've already met, haven't we? And not just once, but as neighbors.'

Wasn't there a saying about darkness under the lamp?

The Black Scythe lived just below, and she didn't suspect it at all.

The Prophet and the Black Scythe looked different in appearance and personality, of course.

Of course, the term "Black Scythe" was purely the Prophet's claim.

'But it didn't seem like a lie. He even showed evidence.'

She had seen her appearance transform with her own eyes.

He demonstrated the tone of the Black Scythe she knew.

If that's the case, how can she not believe it?

'The Prophet is definitely the Black Scythe. Definitely...'

The tone, the feeling, it was the Black Scythe she knew.

That much, she could be sure of.

Then, suddenly, a sense of unease crept in.

'Wait a minute. Could I have mistaken the Prophet? If that's the case, it's a big problem...'

Suddenly anxious, Seoarin furrowed her brows, pressing her temples.

Could she have treated the Prophet disrespectfully or shown an ugly side unknowingly? She reviewed her actions.

'As far as I remember, I didn't behave disrespectfully. Fortunately, I don't think I made a mistake.'

Breathing a small sigh of relief, Seoarin pulled the blanket up to her chin.

Her thoughts were full of the Black Scythe, making her suddenly embarrassed.

'What should I do... The more I think about it, the more it comes to mind...'

Especially knowing that he lives next door made her heart race.

Anyone would feel that way if their favorite person lived just a few meters away.

'I want to see him. I want to see him so much, it's driving me crazy.'

The pounding and unsettled heart, which seemed to find closure as it unknowingly fell asleep, was once again disturbed the moment Seoarin opened her eyes in the morning.

"Oh... I only slept for four hours."

Rubbing her eyes and washing her face, Seoarin instinctively opened the refrigerator and took out a sandwich she had bought from the convenience store yesterday.

After quickly devouring a simple meal, accompanied by sips of milk, she sat on the sofa in her pajamas and turned on the TV.

It was a habitual action, driven by the thought that there was nothing else to distract her from overthinking, but it turned out to be a mistake.

The broadcast on TV was about the Black Scythe, bringing her thoughts back to the unsettling topic once again.

[Currently, there are only 143 players left worldwide?] [Yes. After the 18th round, the number of players, which was 9 billion, has now dwindled to just three digits.] [Not much time left, huh?] [Exactly. However, among the players, many consider even this number as a significant survival. They attribute it to the Black Scythe for being able to survive this far.] [It seems like the Black Scythe is quite active in the other world, isn't it?] [From what I've heard, that's correct.] [From what you've heard? What does that mean?] [For us regular folks who can't go to the other world, we have no choice but to completely trust the words of players who have come back alive.] [So, according to the players, how has the Black Scythe helped?] [According to their claims, the Black Scythe supports in creating items, reveals strategies for the next round in advance, and overall provides assistance in various ways to help as many players survive as possible. Thanks to this, the fact that 143 players have survived is considered a miracle. In short, he is playing a significant role as a leader, guiding the group.] [So, you could say he's like a savior for the players?] [Exactly. And this extends not only to players but also to the things the Black Scythe has done for ordinary people. Clearing out the Nigeria IS organization, maintaining domestic security with the CPF, removing coup player threats, blocking the summoning of monsters in the 16th round, and so on. He has a record of saving countless ordinary lives.] [Listing them out, it's truly astonishing. How are the reactions from the citizens regarding this?] [Naturally, he is being treated as a once-in-a-century hero. The statistic that players are considered the evils of society had risen to as high as 79% at one point, but now it has dropped to 5%, showing a significant improvement in negative perceptions. Even if other players may not be known, the nickname "Black Scythe" has gained considerable recognition.] [I see. However, it's mentioned that the identity of the Black Scythe, who achieved such great feats, has not been revealed yet?] [That's correct. He always appears in front of the press wearing a white mask, presumably to avoid revealing his identity. The only things disclosed are that he is over 180 cm tall and has pale skin...]

Seoarin, turning off the TV, muttered as if pointing out.

"No way. That's just a made-up appearance..."

As someone who knew the identity of the Black Scythe, the chatter on TV seemed rather awkward.

'I'm just thinking too much.'

Trying to forget about the Black Scythe, she ended up having more thoughts because of the TV.

Now she really wants to forget about the Black Scythe.

Erase him from her mind.

But suddenly, another thought crossed her mind.

Why should she erase him?

Why should she be so tormented like this?

'I don't know. Why am I like this?'

If she wants to meet him, she can just meet him, right?

Why try to erase the Black Scythe from her mind as if she did something wrong?

There's absolutely no reason for that.

'Should I... go see him?'

After dismissing her worries, Seoarin decided to meet the Black Scythe.

They are neighbors, and considering they've seen each other's faces, it shouldn't be awkward.

Aren't they already like brother and sister?

Thinking this way, her previously tangled thoughts cleared up, and she felt refreshed.

But a new problem arose.

'What excuse should I use to go and find him?'

Even if they are neighbors, some pretext was necessary.

She couldn't just knock on the door saying she wants to see the Black Scythe for no reason.

'Come to think of it, I mentioned moving before, right?'

Not only that, she even had meals at Ryu Min's place.

Of course, it was not Ryu Min but his brother who prepared the meal, but she still received hospitality, and she didn't reciprocate.

'Alright! I can use the moving thing as an excuse to make food and visit.'

Being neighbors, wouldn't it be normal to bring some food?

With her thoughts organized, Seoarin happily imagined the scenario in her mind.

The image of Ryu Min enjoying the food she made appeared vividly before her eyes.

Just that thought made her chest swell, and a pleasant smile appeared on her face.

However...

'Right... I don't know how to cook, do I?'

The fact that Seoarin had only ever made ramen in her life became a problem.

Since she usually satisfied her hunger with delivery or convenience store food.

'Uh, what should I do?'

Seoarin's expression turned as gloomy as a wet puppy in the rain.
ChatGPT

Beep-beep, Ding-dong-â™¬

Upon hearing the doorbell, Ryu Won looked at his brother sitting on the sofa.

"Hyung, did you order delivery?"

"No."

"If you didn't order delivery, then who is it?"

On the screen of the tablet, there was a shy-looking woman standing.

Ryu Won's expression brightened instantly, and he hurriedly ran to open the front door.

"Arin noona!"

"Huh? Oh, Wonnie?"

"What's going on at our house? Hyung called you?"

"Oh, no. I just came to deliver this..."

Shyly, Seoarin held up a shopping bag.

"Really? Come in first. Come in."

Ryu Won, as if indicating that the contents of the shopping bag didn't matter, welcomed Seoarin inside.

"Who is it?"

Ryu Min poked his head out, and he could see Seoarin entering with her brother's push.

"Is it Actress Seo?"

"Oh, hello. Ryu Min-ssi."

Even though it wasn't their first meeting, Seoarin's awkward face while greeting him was quite noticeable.

It didn't take long for Ryu Min, with his high Intelligence stat, to read her inner thoughts, as it happened in an instant.

'She came because she missed me?'

Seoarin's purpose of the visit was just that.

Simply wanting to see the Black Scythe in reality.

Unaware that her feelings had already been read, Seoarin stammered and extended the shopping bag to Ryu Min.

"T-take this."

"What's this?"

"It's cookies. I made them myself at a homemade cookie workshop, so they're still warm. Please try some."

Ryu Min already knew the reason but pretended not to and asked, "Why...?"

"Well... I've received a lot of help from the Prophet-nim. Besides, I had a meal at your house, so..."

"Noona! I was the one who made the meal back then. Why is it only hyung giving something?"

"Oh, no. I made something for you separately inside."

"Wow, really?"

Ryu Won excitedly found cookies in the shopping bag with his name written on them.

Ryu Min, too, looked surprised as he observed the neatly wrapped cookies.

"Did you make all of these, Actress?"
ChatGPT

"Yes... I received a little, no, a lot of help. Hehe..."

"I'll gratefully enjoy it."

As Ryu Min smiled and spoke, Seoarin started laughing but quickly turned her head.

She was acting nervously, afraid that her inner thoughts might be revealed due to her possibly blushing face.

However, she was already unaware that her feelings had been exposed.

"Uh, we have something to talk about..."

"Then let's go to my room. Won-ah, eat first."

"Got it, hyung. Noona, if hyung tries to do anything strange in his room, call me, okay? You got it?"

"What's wrong with this guy? He never stops with these ridiculous things."

Ryu Min was about to retaliate with a powerful smack, but Ryu Won, terrified, clapped his hands.

"Oh, it's a joke. Just kidding. Hehe."

"Sorry, Actress. I'll apologize on his behalf."

"Oh, no. It's just a joke. No big deal."

Though she knew it was a joke, Seoarin's face turned even redder, reaching her ears.

Finally, Ryu Min brought Seoarin into the room and, as soon as he closed the door, he asked.

"Speak up. What do you want to say?"

"Prophet-nim. No, Black Scythe-nim. What happened?"

"What do you mean?"

"I received a message from the Sasin Church this time. They said they couldn't get information about the next round? Is it true?"

Ryu Min, who had been considering whether to tell the truth, made a decision.

"Actually, I do know the information about the next round."

"Really?"

"But I couldn't tell the truth because it might cause confusion among people."

"Oh..."

"All I can tell you is this much. Please understand that I couldn't tell Arin-ssi either."

"Oh, I understand. It's okay even if you don't tell me the information. Considering the help I've received so far, it's already tremendous."

Seoarin nodded, and Ryu Min asked again.

"Anything else you're curious about?"

"Uh, well..."

She wanted to say more, but nothing specific came to her mind.

"Well, that..."

Seoarin, squeezing her head to find a topic of conversation, opened her mouth.

"Tr, try the cookies. I want to see your reaction."

"Haha, sure. Let's go try them."

As Ryu Min laughed and came out of the room.

Click-

His younger brother was opening the front door.

It seemed like someone had come to their house, and the younger brother was letting them in.

"Hyung, there's a guest."
ChatGPT

"Who?"

As Ryu Min looked out the front door, he saw a familiar face.

"Min Joo-ri?"

"Min-a. I was at home..."

Min Joo-ri, who was shaking hands warmly, froze for a moment.

At that moment, she saw Seoarin coming out of the room with Ryu Min.

"Oh."

To avoid any misunderstandings, Ryu Min explained while looking at Seoarin.

"A little while ago, Actress Seoarin came..."

However, Min Joo-ri didn't listen and went outside.

Leaving with just one sentence.

"Sorry. Have a good time."
