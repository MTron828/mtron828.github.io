Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 155"

Episode 155: "The Sacred Empire"

◀ ROUND 10 ▶

└ Complete at least one sub-quest in the fantasy world within 10 hours.

└ ???? Numerous

[Overall Area]

└ Participants: 550,528

└ Achievers: 0/137,632

[Specific Area C3-ESKA001]

└ Participants: 2,760

└ Achievers: 0/690

Players who checked the quest were tense.

"Do we have to clear at least one sub-quest?"

"In the fantasy world we've been to before?"

"Seeing that it's 'at least one,' does that mean there are multiple?"

"Then completing just one out of many counts as quest completion?"

"If so, it seems too easy, doesn't it?"

The thought of it being easy lasted only a moment.

People quickly changed their minds.

'It can't be this easy.'

Especially since the angel emphasized the difficulty.

"Maybe each sub-quest is incredibly difficult."

Was it that muttering that Nele, the angel, heard?

She let out a laugh that was close to mockery.

[Sub-quests aren't that difficult, humans. There may be differences in difficulty, but most of them are easy to conquer alone. Don't be too scared.]

"Uh, then what part is difficult...?"

[I didn't say the difficulty lies in the quests themselves. It meant that passing the rounds won't be easy. Because the achiever positions will be filled in the order of those who completed many quests.]

"Ah...."

They lined up in the order of completing as many quests as possible.

That meant it was nothing short of encouraging competition among themselves.

Since no one knew how many they had to complete to secure a stable position.

Of course, not everyone was in the dark.

At least those who heard Ryu Min's prophecy showed no signs of anxiety on their faces.

Because they heard the guideline.

'You have to complete at least 4 sub-quests to enter the top 25%. To get into the top 3 in this area, you need to clear 7.'

To reach the top spot, it was considered safe to complete 10 quests.

Naturally, Ryu Min intended to complete 10 quests in this round.
ChatGPT

"Seems like you've guessed roughly, but let me explain. This round is about freely exploring the fantasy world for 10 hours and clearing scattered sub-quests. As you can see, completing at least one sub-quest is considered a success for the main quest, and you can continue to complete more until the time runs out."

"Ten hours is quite a long mission, isn't it?"

"You'll need to move diligently. The time limit is 10 hours, but you'll pass based on the order of completing quests, so at least complete one. Of course, if you can't complete even one, you'll disappear immediately."

"Ha... this is going to be intense."

"We'll have to tackle the quests seriously."

So, there's a time limit, but no limit on the number of quests achieved? Naturally, a competitive mindset was inevitable.

"We won't know how many quests we need to complete, so it'll be unsettling. It'll be anxious and difficult. But difficulty and challenge are different."

When Ryu Min said Round 10 was difficult, it wasn't just because the competition was fierce.

"Sub-quests vary in difficulty, just like the angel said. There are easy quests, but they're extremely rare. The difficulty of quests that are hard to clear alone is around five out of ten. The remaining four are challenging to clear even with difficulty."

The angel's statement about them being easy was a lie.

"So, completing four in 10 hours is considered skilled, given the current level of players."

Ryu Min wasn't worried about the difficulty.

"Compared to the Tower of Trials, this is a piece of cake."

Perhaps breaking through the 60th floor of the Tower of Trials in 10 hours would be more challenging than completing 10 sub-quests.

"Once a quest is completed, it can't be challenged again. Of course, other players can try, so keep that in mind and move. If you have any questions, I'll take them."

"Can you tell us the difficulty level of each quest?"

Optimistically raising a hand to ask, the response received was sarcasm.

"The first question is such a foolish one. I want to explode my head."

"...."

"If I tell you, it won't be fun. Any other questions, human?"

"Can we quit midway if a quest is too difficult?"

"That's a good question. Yes, you can quit. There's a quit button on the quest progress window. You can use that. Rechallenge is also possible if you haven't succeeded in the quest."
ChatGPT

"Oh, then it's doable, right?"

"If a quest is too difficult, you can just give up."

[However, we won't return your time. Also, quitting midway is only possible once per quest. You only have one chance to reattempt the same quest.]

"Ah..."

Players who were thinking of trying multiple times showed expressions of disappointment.

"Now that the explanation is over, let's proceed with the round!"

As Nele spread her wings, the same message appeared before everyone.

[Please touch the starting area among the following.]

└ 1. Kingdom of Albits

└ 2. Kingdom of Brahm

└ 3. Sacred Empire

└ 4. Elves' Elysium

[If you don't make a selection within the time limit, it will be chosen randomly.] [Time remaining until the end of the selection: 00:00:59]

Suddenly asked to choose a starting area, the players were confused.

Players with decision paralysis panicked, moving their fingers back and forth in the air.

But there were calm individuals amidst the confusion.

Ryu Min and his party, who had heard the prophecy in advance, were such people.

'1, 2, 3 are for humans, and 4 is the city of the elves.'

As Ryu Min had a good reputation among the elves, he believed that if they went to Elves' Elysium, they would receive a warm welcome.

However, he excluded 4 for now.

'It's not the right time yet. There will be plenty of opportunities to meet the elves in the future.'

Above all, Ryu Min's interest in this round was elsewhere.

It wasn't about sub-quests.

'3, let's go to the Sacred Empire.'

Before making a choice, Ryu Min glanced at Minjoo.

It was because he wanted a buff, and she was already turning people around in a rush.

"Get a buff before you leave! The Black Scythe too!"

"Thanks."

"We don't know where you'll choose, but let's all do our best!"

Even though she was rushing people and turning them around, Minjoo was still cheering with a slightly swollen face.

'Shall we go then?'

Ryu Min's finger pressed the air with a tap.

On the fantasy continent, there are five kingdoms and one empire.

Among them, two kingdoms that appeared were Albits and Brahm.

The remaining three were considered minor kingdoms and were not even mentioned as starting points.
ChatGPT

And befitting its name, the grand city, the Sacred Empire.

The Sacred Empire, a religious group worshiping gods, boasts a massive scale to the extent that neighboring kingdoms seem insignificant.

'It's not just for show that they're called an empire.'

Tall walls that might give a headache to anyone claiming it's not an empire, numerous buildings, temples, and bustling people within. All of it felt so vivid that it was hard to distinguish whether it was real or not.

'In Round 8, I killed the Archbishop, causing my reputation to turn hostile. But there's nothing to worry about. As long as I don't reveal my title, it's fine.'

Ryu Min admired the surroundings without revealing any titles.

If he revealed them carelessly, the guards might try to apprehend him.

'It's lucky if they catch me. They'll probably try to kill me right there.'

Though Ryu Min wouldn't easily die, he didn't want to be bothered by persistent mosquitoes.

Not revealing titles was precisely for this reason.

As Ryu Min looked around, he spotted people dressed in familiar attire.

They were players.

Perhaps it's a characteristic of being in a fantasy world, but nicknames were also not visible.

'It's good if I can't see nicknames. It's more comfortable to act alone.'

Ryu Min transformed his appearance into a Lost Yak in a place where people's gazes couldn't reach.

Encountering someone he knows can be troublesome.

[Starting Location: Sacred Empire] [Ongoing Sub-quests: None] [Completed Sub-quests: None] [Time Remaining until Round End: 09:58:21]

Looking at the quest progress window, the limited time was ticking away.

The real start of the round.

Normally, one would have to run around everywhere to find quests, but Ryu Min was leisurely.

He was confident he could easily achieve around 10 even if he took his time.

'What's important now isn't the sub-quests.'

Ryu Min's steps headed towards the central square of the Sacred Empire.

Waiting for someone in front of the statue engraved with an angel, he soon faced a familiar face.

"Master!"

Yantti, who knew the face of Lost Yak, ran towards him with a delighted expression.

"You're a bit late."

"I'm sorry. The central square is so vast, I needed to figure out where it was."

"You could have just asked the guards for directions."
ChatGPT

"Ah! Will they answer if you ask?"

"They will. If the reputation isn't hostile."

Ryu Min had arranged to meet Yantti in the Sacred Empire in advance.

This was because her charm was necessary to enter the temple.

"Follow me."

"Where are you going?"

"The temple."

"Why the temple?"

"So many questions."

"I'm sorry."

Yantti lowered her head in embarrassment.

As a slave who always obeys orders, she didn't feel the need to explain, but Ryu Min realized that it might be good to at least say where they were going.

"I have only one reason for being with you."

"To charm someone, right?"

"Yeah. Inside the largest temple in the Sacred Empire, there's an altar where divine trust is received. Naturally, it's a place not anyone can enter. However, with the Charm Rune, the story changes."

"Ah, you mean I'm needed to go to the altar where divine trust is received."

"That's right."

"But do NPCs get charmed too? I've never tried it, so..."

"They do."

Just that?

'He can read thoughts too. Just like a real person.'

He might actually be a real person.

A person like us, existing in a different dimension.

But he couldn't discard the assumption of NPCs.

'What if each entity is an AI well-programmed even in thoughts?'

It could be considered a virtual human, or an NPC, created for a survival game.

'There's no way they have the technology to transfer the souls of 1.8 billion people and even resurrect them.'

Therefore, Ryu Min decided to judge the situation flexibly.

He decided to move solely for growth and survival until Round 20.

Now was the foundation for that.

"But why are you going to the altar with divine trust?"

"Why would you go?"

A smirk appeared on Ryu Min's lips.

"To kill an angel."
