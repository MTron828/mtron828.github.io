Title: Episode 132 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Representative Selection Match of the 9th Round

Time passed quickly, and it was midnight on September 1st.

Players were no longer surprised, even if the environment changed to a colorless space in the blink of an eye.

Even when hundreds of people appeared one by one in the air.

Even if an unfortunate angel sparkled with light from the sky.

Players who had endured for a long 8 months looked up at the angel with silent faces.

[Hello, humans! It feels like I'm getting attached to seeing you like this every time. Don't you feel the same?]

"...."

As the players remained silent, the angel Ariel's delicate forehead twisted mercilessly.

[What's this? Is this cold reaction because you've leveled up a bit and now you mock the angel? Nice to meet you, isn't it?]

"Haha... W-welcome."

"Yes. Nice to meet you, nice to meet you."

Forced smiles appeared on the faces of the players.

'Damn, what arrogance.'

Unless you're a fool, you know it's just sweet talk, but the angel seemed satisfied just by that and smiled.

[Hehe, good. I'm also pleased to meet you, humans. However, unfortunately, it seems you won't see me after this round. There's going to be a zone integration in this round!]

"Zone integration?"

"Again?"

"It feels like they do it quite often."

There were only about 900 players left.

It was time for zone integration.

'This will be the last zone integration among us Koreans. From the 11th round, we'll be integrated with players from other countries.'

As if proving Rumin's words, the angel explained.

[Don't complain about it being frequent. This is the last zone integration held in the country called Korea.]

"Last zone integration...?"

[Due to the small number of players, we have to integrate all seven remaining zones in Korea.]

"All the remaining zones are going to be integrated?"

"Does that mean only one zone will be left?"

[Yes. Everything will be unified into one zone. It's a chance to meet all scattered Korean players in one place!]

The angel spoke as if reuniting separated families.
ChatGPT

[Then I'll proceed with the integration right away.]

Drdrdrdrdrdr-

The ground trembled, and the background fragmented and merged.

Scattered players from South Korea gathered in one place.

Their number was approximately 6,000.

Looking at the new faces, players had various thoughts.

'Is everyone here the only remaining players in South Korea?'

'Do we have to compete against each other again?'

'What happens if we get fewer here?'

'I don't know, but surviving here might increase the player's value, right?'

Their thoughts towards each other were different.

Some showed competitiveness, while others lamented the decrease in comrades.

[Finally, all players from Korea have gathered in one place! The exact number is 6,008. The integrated zone name is C3-ESKA001.]

"6,000 people?"

"Are there only that many players left in our country?"

The players, who started at 900, had decreased to only 6,000 in just 8 months.

And it was expected to continue decreasing.

[Now that the zones are integrated, we should have the Zone Representative Selection Match again, right? Our angels will discuss this and let you know. In the meantime, greet each other. Maybe gather with friends and relieve some stress!]

As the angel disappeared, the 6,000 people expressed their discontent as if they had been waiting.

"Greet each other in a situation where we have to compete?"

"What? Gather with friends to relieve stress?"

"Does this place become some kind of meeting square? Seriously."

Even though the zones were integrated, there were hardly any familiar faces. Most friends or acquaintances had turned into dust after being eliminated in previous rounds.

But there were exceptions.

"Ju... No, Lord Black Scythe!"

The first person to approach Rumin was Yantti.

Rumin had already given him a hint that the zones would be integrated and had instructed him to come find him immediately upon integration.

'Someday I'll have to meet Yantti, and I can't pretend not to know him in real life. Besides, I'll need Yantti for the quests ahead, so it's better to show our connection early.'
ChatGPT

"Lord Black Scythe. Nice to meet you like this. Are we in the same zone?"

"Enough. No need for acting when we're alone."

"Oh, um, right? Hehe, I'm really, really glad to see you in the otherworld, my lord!"

"Hush. Lower your voice when you speak. Just in case, check if there's an invisible assassin using transparency within a 30m radius."

"Oh, sorry."

Yantti, having said that, immediately guarded the surroundings and whispered to Rumin as he approached.

"But how was my acting initially? Was it passable?"

"Well, it seemed a bit too much. It would be better if you tone down the emotions a bit."

"Hehe, thank you for the advice, my lord."

"By the way, don't get too close. Someone might misunderstand if they see us."

"Oh, yes... I understand."

Yantti, whispering in Rumin's ear, seemed a bit disappointed with a subtly resentful expression.

At that moment, someone entered the 30m range.

The two, having detected the presence, simultaneously turned their heads.

"Uh... Lord Black Scythe?"

It was Minjuri.

She had come to find Black Scythe as if it were a matter of course but was surprised.

After all, he was flirting with a woman she had never seen before.

"Who... are you?"

"Hello, I'm Yantti."

"I didn't ask for your nickname; I'm asking what your relationship is with Lord Black Scythe."

Yantti, annoyed by the sharp tone, momentarily made a displeased expression.

Then, deliberately using a nasal tone and lifting one corner of his mouth.

"Hmm, well? Do I have an obligation to answer that?"

"What did you say?"

"You, too, are a newcomer. What's your relationship with Lord Black Scythe?"

"Me? I'm... a companion of Lord Black Scythe."

Before Minjuri could finish her sentence, she looked at Black Scythe for a cue.

Companion? She wanted to say that, but would Black Scythe share the same sentiment? It was a question whether Black Scythe ever thought of them as comrades, as they had met out of necessity and had never uttered the word 'comrades' before.

"Companion..."

"What did you say? I couldn't hear well."

"I, um... I..."

"Enough. Both of you."

Rumin, finding it hard to watch the female dispute, intervened between them.

Then, as prearranged, he explained.
ChatGPT

"Lord Black Scythe. It's nice to meet you like this. This is Yantti, who has a personal friendship with my real-life self. Just in case, don't misunderstand and think of her as a girlfriend or anything. As for democracy..."

Rumin stared straight at Minjuri.

"She's my colleague. We've partied together several times."

"Oh."

Was it because she finally heard the word 'colleague' that she desperately wanted to hear? Or was it because he drew a line saying she wasn't a girlfriend?

Minjuri, astonished, drew a long arc with her lips.

A feeling as if her heart had been pierced.

An uncontrollable smile spread.

"Lord Black Scythe knows someone from my real life. I'm sorry for being overly sensitive. I felt cautious because she's an unfamiliar face."

Minjuri apologized with a smile, seemingly having released the emotions she held a moment ago.

Coming out first like this, Yantti couldn't help but apologize as well.

"I'm sorry too. I responded sharply, didn't I?"

The response came from Rumin.

"Sharp would be an understatement. It was downright impolite from the first meeting."

Saying so, Rumin glanced at Yantti without Minjuri noticing.

'Don't unnecessarily pick a fight with my acquaintance over the slave topic. If you don't want trouble.'

Having understood the meaning in his gaze, Yantti lowered his gaze like a scolded puppy.

At that moment, a group with familiar faces approached from afar.

It was Seo Arin, Ahn Sangchul, and Ma Kyungrok.

"Hello, Lord Black Scythe."

"Hello!"

Except for Ma Kyungrok, the expressions of the other two were brighter than usual.

Seo Arin seemed pleased to meet Black Scythe again in real life, and Ahn Sangchul was in a good mood, probably because of meeting Ma Kyungrok.

"And who is this next to you?"

When Rumin pretended not to know and glanced at Ma Kyungrok, Ahn Sangchul stepped forward as if to introduce him.

"Let me introduce you. Lord Black Scythe, this is our company's representative, Ma... Cheonma."

"Cheonma?"

"Oh, no. It's Cheonma, Cheonma."

Ma Kyungrok, who stepped forward to shake hands, said, "Nice to meet you, Lord Black Scythe," while Rumin shamelessly pretended not to know.

"Cheonma... I never expected to meet a named-ranked player who ranks 2nd or 3rd in the zone like this."

"Haha, named-ranked? I can't even make it to the top 3 now. What a situation."

Despite being a first-time meeting, Ma Kyungrok greeted Rumin with friendliness.

There had been debts owed to Black Scythe all along.
ChatGPT

"I've heard a lot from Director Ahn. He assisted us during the second round against the outlaws. Also, we partied together during the sixth round, and he helped us level up."

"Well, yeah."

"As the representative, I want to express my gratitude in various ways for helping our employees."

"Gratitude is unnecessary."

Rumin stuck to informal speech for the concept. Fortunately, Ma Kyungrok didn't seem to take offense.

If an 80-level player uses informal speech, what can a 38-level player do?

At that moment, Seo Arin cautiously intervened in the conversation.

"But Lord Black Scythe, that person over there...?"

She pointed to Yantti.

Being pointed at, Yantti raised his head discreetly.

"Nice to meet you. Are you a colleague of Lord Black Scythe? I'm Yantti, a friend of Lord Black Scythe in reality."

"Reality... friend?"

Seo Arin's pupils trembled.

Was Black Scythe's existence not a secret known only to her in reality?

'Well, if he's as skilled as Lord Black Scythe, he must know many people around him.'

After all, quite a number of people had gathered here, even now.

'Wait, does that mean this Yantti person knows Lord Black Scythe's real face?'

She had only seen him with a white mask; she didn't know his actual face.

Seo Arin sent Yantti a jealous glance.

In her heart, she, too, wanted to be known as a real-life acquaintance of Lord Black Scythe.

"Did you enjoy the reunion? Korean players?"

At that moment, as if the angels had finished their discussion, Ariel returned.

"Currently, seven zones have been integrated, and there are seven zone representatives. As mentioned earlier, we need to select one of them as the representative. The chosen representative will practically become the representative of Korean players."

Ma Kyungrok listened attentively to the angel's words.

It was, in essence, a representative of one zone.

He was in a competitive position with Black Scythe.

"So, how will the selection be conducted? We thought about the basic method, like having a deathmatch..."

At the mention of a deathmatch, Ma Kyungrok flinched and looked at Rumin.

'I'm not confident in a deathmatch...'

Fighting against an 80-level player would be an obvious outcome.

"After our discussions, we've decided to conduct a fair vote for this representative selection match."

"Vote?"

"Did you all conduct a vote during the second round? Just like that, you can nominate the representative player you want from the seven candidates."
ChatGPT

Upon learning about the vote, hope sparked in Ma Kyungrok's face.

'Could there be a chance for me as well?'

He wasn't confident in a deathmatch, but with voting, there was a slight possibility.

"Well, shall we proceed with the vote then? Those who don't make a choice will be eliminated, so please make your selections quickly."

As the angel fluttered its wings, a message appeared in front of the people.

"Please vote for one of the candidates below for the representative of the integrated zone."

└ 1. Black Scythe (Level 80 Deathbringer)

└ 2. Cheonma (Level 38 Dark Knight)

………………

…………

└ 7. Dumb Idiots (Level 38 Shaman)

[Time remaining until the end of the vote: 00:00:59]

After some consideration, the players touched their fingers.

Since it was a selection window visible only to themselves, there was no need to be discreet.

"For your information, the zone representatives are candidates, so they don't have the right to vote. Leave it to fate."

As the angel said, Ma Kyungrok swallowed his saliva, awaiting a favorable outcome.

'Maybe I'll become the zone representative, surpassing Black Scythe.'

Ma Kyungrok hoped while looking at Black Scythe.

'Even if I don't show it on the surface, he might be a bit annoyed.'

This time, he couldn't help but feel uneasy.

Maybe he might lose the position of the zone representative.

A minute later, the angel spoke.

"The results are out. Shall we check them right away?"
