Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 194"

Cheolsu

The method of wielding the black scythe that Dark Soul suggested was simple.

Intentionally cause a crime to make CPF (presumably a law enforcement or security force) respond, capture the members of that unit, and use them as bait to lure out the Black Scythe.

By using the unit members as bait, you can summon the Black Scythe, who is their leader.

To achieve that, we will divide the operation into three teams: the Brix Team, the First Warrior Team, and our team, each with four members. It seems more efficient than moving together.

Spaniard, who spoke like that, regretted his decision just one hour into the operation.

Contact with the Brix Team was lost.

"Spaniard. Still no contact?"

"Yes. He's not answering, whatever might have happened."

Just 20 minutes ago, they received a call from the First Warrior Team.

The Black Scythe is coming this way, so gather.

Spaniard, who promised to contact the Brix Team himself, was soon faced with an awkward situation.

Despite making several calls, there was still no response.

"Brix Team isn't answering?"

"Yes."

"Could it be that they're too busy with hostage rescue to answer?"

"Even if that's the case, not answering after dozens of calls is a bit..."

"Then try contacting other members."

"I've already tried, but I'll try again, just in case."

At Yang Chweon's suggestion, Spaniard hesitated for a moment before making a call.

As expected, no one answered.

"All four members are out of contact. Something's not right. There must be a problem with the Brix Team."

"Darn it, we need to join them quickly before the Black Scythe arrives. Why isn't that team answering the phone?"

"I don't know. Let's go to the First Warrior Team for now."

The four moved through the alley once again.

They needed to go to the location where they had quickly lured the Black Scythe, even if they had to leave the Brix Team behind.

Only then could they join forces with the First Warrior Team to deal with him.

However, upon arriving at the scene, there was nothing to be seen.

"Is this the right place?"

"According to the address we were given, it should be, but..."

"Try calling."

Spaniard tried calling the First Warrior, but there was no response.

"They're not picking up."

"If they weren't going to answer, why bother carrying the phones around?"

Yang Chweon expressed frustration, but they were unaware of the deaths of the First Warrior Team in the alley they were standing in, as well as the fact that the Brix Team had already been killed by Ju Sungtak.

However, there was someone who had anticipated the truth.

"Could he have come already?"

"What are you talking about, Jon?"

When Yang Chweon asked, Jon Delgado responded with a face that suggested it was a rather obvious conclusion.

"The Black Scythe. I think he might have come first and annihilated the team."

"What?"

"The Black Scythe."

It was a plausible story, but Yang Chweon just chuckled.

"Unbelievable."

"Why is it unbelievable?"

"The Black Scythe killed the entire First Warrior Team? Then where are the bodies? Why can't we see a trace of them?"

"They probably erased the evidence."

"Even so, could there be no traces at all? Look around. There's no broken wall or any signs of a fight."

"It might not have been a fight."

"Then?"

"It could have been a one-sided massacre."

Jon's expression was serious.

There was no hint of jest in his demeanor; he seemed to genuinely believe what he was saying.

"The Black Scythe is that powerful?"

"He is. Strong enough that all Twelve Apostles would have to intervene for a chance at victory."

"Really..."

Although Yang Chweon expressed disbelief, he couldn't offer a counterargument.

The only person who had experienced the strength of the Black Scythe was the tactician.

The expression on Spaniard's face, who had been listening to the conversation, became grave.

"If what Jon says is true and the First Warrior Team is in trouble, the other teams are in danger too."

"Could it be that the Brix Team isn't answering because they've already met the same fate?"

"Does that make sense? That we were individually defeated by the Black Scythe in such a short time?"

"He has the ability to do that. In the worst case, we might be the only four survivors."

"No, that's absurd."

"Well... I apologize. Instead of dividing the team, we should have stuck together."

Worry crept onto the faces of the apostles.

At that moment,

"Huh?"
ChatGPT

Dark Soul, who habitually had the surrounding exploration skill activated, warned as he observed an approaching red dot.

"Who's coming from over there?"

Sounds of heavy breathing were heard from the alley he pointed to, and shortly after, a person revealed themselves.

It was the martial artist from India, Swingman.

"Heh, heh. Y-you all were here?"

Breathing heavily as if he had just finished a marathon, he seemed greatly relieved, as if meeting reinforcements.

"Swingman, what's going on? What about the other apostles?"

At Spaniard's inquiry, Swingman's complexion suddenly darkened.

"That... I don't know."

"What? You don't know?"

"Embarrassingly, I was too busy escaping from that guy. I didn't have the time to worry about my colleagues."

"If it's that guy... who?"

"Black Scythe."

As soon as they heard the name, the other apostles sensed the bad premonition they had shared a while ago turning into reality.

"Tell us in detail what happened."

"Before that... are you sure there's no one nearby?"

"Who? The Black Scythe?"

Looking around with an uneasy expression, Spaniard reassured him.

"If you check the surroundings, there's no one here except us. If you're still worried, try tracking the Black Scythe. Haven't you seen his face?"

"No. He was wearing a white mask. I don't know what he looks like. And without knowing his real name, tracking him in the real world is impossible, isn't it?"

"Ah, right. I forgot. Okay, now please explain. What happened here?"

Swingman, hesitating, finally began to speak.

"As you know, we lured the Black Scythe using hostages. And before you arrived, the Black Scythe came first. It was a man with a white mask holding a scythe. It seemed like we could handle him alone since there was only one, but... it was a miscalculation. In an instant, our hostages and colleagues were killed."

"The Black Scythe killed hostages as well?"

"Yes. He was a cold and ruthless person who didn't care about hostages or anything. His skills were formidable too. He used a mysterious scythe with an extended range, and the attacks were invisible. It didn't take long for only me and the First Warrior to remain."

"Are you saying the Black Scythe killed hostages?"

"Yes. Whether they were hostages or not, he was a cold and ruthless individual. His skills were formidable. He used a mysterious scythe with an extended range, and the attacks were invisible. It didn't take long for only me and the First Warrior to remain."
ChatGPT

Swingman, who spoke with a somber tone, shivered as if recalling the chilling events.

"We knew at a glance. There was simply no chance of winning. Without saying a word, as if it were a prearranged signal, we scattered in all directions. Escape was the only way to survive. The other apostles died, but I couldn't see what happened to the First Warrior. I ran without looking back."

It was a grim story of being massacred without being able to offer any substantial resistance, as John had predicted. However, Yang Chweon still wore a face that found it hard to believe.

"Hey, Careman. Did you really get attacked by the Black Scythe?"

"What do you mean by that? Are you suggesting that I'm lying?"

"Who knows? You might be casually killing other apostles and acting innocent."

"What are you saying?"

Swingman jumped up as if feeling unjustly accused.

"Why would I have a reason to kill my colleagues? What benefit would I get?"

"That's correct. Swingman has no reason to betray us."

While Spaniard defended and stepped forward, Yang Chweon's suspicion remained unswayed.

"I don't know why he would betray us. But the more I think about it, the stranger it seems. We all promised to take on the Black Scythe together, yet they attacked first without waiting for us? Are they in their right minds? Didn't they think of buying time through negotiation until we arrived?"

"We did think about it. However, First Warrior stopped us, saying there was no need. But then..."

"Why did you come back to the murder scene suddenly?"

"It was because I had second thoughts about whether First Warrior might still be alive. I also thought you coming soon could be in danger."

"The guy who abandoned his comrades to run away, worrying about us and returning? There's no Gandhi in this era."

Although Yang Chweon scoffed, Swingman's argument had some validity. Jon Delgado also interjected to support him in the conversation.

"I don't know about other things, but encountering the Black Scythe seems to be a fact. The Black Scythe I saw was also wielding a mysterious scythe that extended like a whip."

"So, did the First Warrior and the other teams really do nothing and just died?"

"Most likely. I don't know if the other teams died, but..."
ChatGPT

"When situations like this arise, if we knew their real names, we could use tracking to determine their survival status."

Dark Soul expressed regret, and Spaniard apologized.

"I hadn't thought about that. I didn't ask for their real names because I thought they wouldn't want to disclose them... My mistake."

"Anyway, seeing that there's no contact, they must be dead, right? Swingman's claim also supports that."

"Yeah, that seems to be the case."

Reluctantly acknowledging the reality, they couldn't deny the fact that there was no witness who had returned alive from the Black Scythe.

"Did Careman really meet the Black Scythe?"

Given John Delgado's confirmation, it seemed to be true.

To hide his embarrassment for unwarranted suspicions, Yang Chweon muttered discontentedly.

"Darn it, 12 apostles reduced to 5 apostles."

"That's right."

"Sigh."

A collective sigh escaped from the team members.

They had been defeated by just one person.

"Now what do we do?"

"We shouldn't stay here like this. We need to withdraw quickly from Korea. The Black Scythe might be nearby."

"Right, we don't know when we might become targets."

"After coming all the way here, do we just run away without achieving anything?"

While Yang Chweon complained, the thoughts of the other apostles were different.

"Knowing the Black Scythe's skills, it's not like we achieved nothing. Let's go back and come up with a plan."

"Spaniard is right. If we want to plan for the future, we need at least five of us to survive, don't we?"

"We need to leave Korea before the Black Scythe arrives."

"Ugh."

Entering Korea without any significant gains and leaving empty-handed was frustrating for Yang Chweon, but he knew it was unavoidable.

"Are you busy? Let's go quickly."

As he easily turned around, the other apostles also turned around with relief.

Little did they know, Ryu Min, disguised as Swingman, was smiling from behind.

"They all seem to mistake me for Swingman."

Contrary to the testimony, Swingman did not survive.

He was caught in Ryu Min's grasp, and his neck was broken.

In other words, the Swingman who had been part of the conversation was Ryu Min, who had seamlessly transformed with the assassin's mask.

"From face to skin color, voice, clothing – everything is perfect. There's no way they could have figured it out."
ChatGPT

There was no room for doubt, but Yang Chweon was different.

He was the only one who doubted Swingman.

"I never expected to be suspected as a betrayer. Maybe it's because I'm the top in the Black Society hierarchy. Or perhaps, he just didn't like Swingman?"

Either way, it didn't matter.

As planned, he could now act as one of the 12 apostles.

"I need to go back and participate in the strategy meeting. And I need to lead the situation the way I want."

To use the Commanders in Round 12, there was a need for internal preparations.

It was an infiltration for that purpose.

"To create such an organization just to oppose me? It's laughable. After using them as I please, I'll discard them mercilessly."

The other apostles did not see Ryu Min's smirk.
