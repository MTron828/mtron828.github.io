Title: "Episode 114 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player"

"Reward of Himer"

It was a buff-type skill with a simple description, but its power was not to be underestimated.

"Because it allows the use of the Moonlight Island every 10 minutes in just 1 second."

It was a skill called 'Moonlight Island,' which, despite lasting only 10 seconds, allowed continuous use of the Moonlight Island.

"The time to gather the energy of the Moonlight Island is 1 second, and the cooldown is 1 second. In other words, you can use the Moonlight Island every 2 seconds."

What used to be a skill used once every 10 minutes can now be used five times in 10 seconds.

It felt like gaining one more ultimate move.

"Now, as a reward for completing the escort, if I receive experience points and rewards separately given by the dwarves...."

There was nothing more to be obtained from the dwarf summit.

"Now, since we've defeated the monsters, let's resume the traitor identification process!"

Subsequently, the traitor identification process proceeded, and some were killed.

However, among the traitors, there were even assassins who, every time the identification process took place, skillfully escaped through transparency.

[Current Status]

└ Participants: 190

└ Traitors: 5

"Ah, there's only 10 minutes left, but there are still 5 traitors?"

"Hasn't anyone attacked those who haven't been attacked yet?"

"Well, I think everyone has been stabbed, but...."

"Even if we attack each other to identify the traitors, no one gets caught, right?"

While blocking 29 out of 30 monster waves, they conducted several traitor identification operations.

However, the traitors were never caught.

Every time the identification process took place, it was easy for them to avoid by either leaving their position or using the invisibility skill as an assassin.

"With 200 people, it's not easy to find them, especially since there's not much time between the monster attacks every 10 minutes."

Of course, there was a method to conduct a thorough investigation whenever there was spare time.

"But for that, someone needs to take charge, and there's no one willing to do that."

With the constant attacks of the orcs, there was no time or energy to spare.
ChatGPT

Translating the text to English:

However, dividing time to investigate is not practical, and it's impossible to remember each person since nicknames are not visible.

Because of this, the players' concerns were not limited to just this.

"Hmm, did you really try attacking everyone?"

"Yes, I did. I've attempted it more than ten times now."

"But why are there still 5 traitors remaining?"

"Why are you asking me about that?"

"Then who should I ask? Huh?"

"Did this guy suddenly lose his mind?"

"What? This guy? This [expletive] guy."

Perhaps exhausted from fighting orcs, they stood facing each other.

"Enough! Stop fighting, everyone!"

Amidst the heated atmosphere, someone stepped in to mediate.

"Fighting like this won't solve anything."

"Well, do you have a better idea then?"

"For now, we should talk and see if anyone hasn't been attacked yet."

"Everyone has been attacked, haven't they?"

"What about the Black Scythe? Have you tried attacking the Black Scythe?"

"The Black Scythe?"

"Attack the Black Scythe?"

"Is that even possible without going crazy?"

"Then has anyone not attacked?"

"I couldn't do that. Hehe."

"If by any chance, the Black Scythe is a traitor? My head would roll, right?"

"That's right."

"No one, right? Anyone?"

The murmurs reached Ryu Min's ears.

All eyes were on him.

'They are suspicious of me.'

Now is the time for someone to step forward and take charge.

Right now.

"If you're not confident in attacking, shall I do the poking?"

"Go ahead and try."

Ryu Min responded confidently, as if biting the bait.

"If you're confident, go ahead and attack."

"...."

Even if the player hesitated in the face of his aggressive demeanor, Ryu Min burst into laughter.

"Ha, it seems like you're the traitor, considering you're threatening. Haha."

"When did I threaten anyone?"

"Weren't you glaring as if you'd kill me if I stabbed you now?"

"Would you smile at someone who suspected you? If I'm suspected as a human, it feels bad."

With an unpleasant expression, Ryu Min said again, "If you want to stab, go ahead."

People like him usually struggle when it comes to actual action.

Ryu Min recognized this and intentionally presented himself as strong.
ChatGPT

Unsurprisingly, the guy who confidently shouted found himself taking steps backward like a scolded puppy in front of the owner.

Among them, there would likely be no player with the courage to attack Ryu Min.

'However, that doesn't mean suspicions have completely disappeared.'

As Ryu Min anticipated, people began to murmur.

"Seeing such a reaction, could the Black Scythe really not be a traitor?"

"It can't be true."

"Hasn't anyone truly tried attacking him?"

Though they spoke quietly, Ryu Min's ears caught every word.

However, it seemed that Ryu Min was not the only one who heard the murmurs.

"There's no need to suspect Black Scythe! I've tried attacking, so there's no doubt."

There was someone defending Ryu Min, and it was none other than Min Ju-ri.

Players who benefited from her buff effects exclaimed with surprise, "Oh!" and nodded in agreement.

"Did the buffer really try attacking?"

"Yes, truly. I attacked, and it made a ping sound and bounced back."

"Well, if the buffer says so..."

It's more effective when someone else defends you rather than claiming innocence yourself.

Acknowledging this fact, people turned away, persuaded by Min Ju-ri.

Ryu Min, reading their thoughts, couldn't help but be quietly amazed.

'Those who suspected me just a while ago completely dropped their suspicions after one word from Min Ju-ri.'

It seems that suspicions were lingering not only around the Black Scythe but also extended to the buffer.

It was natural, considering they had been receiving buffs for free until now.

'Is this somewhat damaging to my pride? To think that she's better at influencing people than I am.'

Is it more effective to draw people in with positive influence rather than forcing them through strength?

Unaware that she had confused others' minds, Min Ju-ri chuckled and whispered in a quiet voice.

"Black Scythe, did I do well? Don't worry. I'll keep the secret of you being a traitor."

"A traitor? I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Oh, you don't need to act aloof with me."

Smiling, Min Ju-ri hummed a tune and distanced herself.

She was avoiding being seen talking to the Black Scythe unnecessarily, as it might raise suspicions.

'Quite cunning, very cunning. Did she want to help me that much?'
ChatGPT

Always receiving help from the Black Scythe, Min Ju-ri couldn't contain her joy when she was able to offer assistance like this.

However, not far away, there was someone watching her with a regretful expression, unable to defend themselves.

In Ryu Min's perspective, it was a situation where he could only shake his head.

'Why is my surroundings filled with people who want to help so much?'

Ironically, Ryu Min didn't really need this kind of help.

At that moment, shouts from the people reached them.

"Monsters! Monsters!"

"They appeared again with only 10 minutes left!"

Ryu Min understood.

This would be the final attack.

'As it's the last one, how about a thorough sweep?'

Swish-

A curtain of darkness covered all directions.

Using the Night of Death, Ryu Min slaughtered the orcs with a 50% increased attack speed.

And, as expected, to finish it off:

Keeeing-

'Moonlight Island.'

Flash-

The unleashed brilliance swept away fifteen orcs lined up in a straight line.

[You've leveled up!]

The level had reached 62 in no time.

Even though the experience reward hadn't come in yet, it was a satisfying growth rate.

After exterminating the horde of orcs, they arrived at their destination.

[Time to destination: 00:00:00]

As soon as the time reached 0, the dwarves at the top set up a carriage.

"Warriors of the otherworld, thank you. It seems good to end the escort here. We've passed the dangerous area."

Himer raised his brief arm, pointing ahead.

"Our destination is over there. From here on, we'll go on our own, so you can return. Thanks to you, we were able to transport our goods safely. Thank you once again."

Himer, who had expressed gratitude multiple times, suddenly got off the carriage and walked somewhere.

Following the gaze, there was Ryu Min, transformed into the Lost Yak.

Himer held Ryu Min's hand, expressing personal gratitude.

"Warrior of the otherworld, no. The one leading the way. Thank you so much for saving our lives."

"Don't mention it."

Externally maintaining a cool demeanor, Ryu Min was secretly anticipating something.

Hoping that the awaited reward would be given.

Sure enough, Himer took something out from his embrace.
ChatGPT

"It may not be equivalent to a life, but I'd like to repay you. Please accept it."

Ryu Min not only didn't refuse but gladly accepted it.

[Received 'Rune Fragment of Endurance' as a reward from Dwarf Blacksmith Himer.]

Just in case he might want to return it, Ryu Min immediately used it.

[Using 'Rune Fragment of Endurance.'] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!] [Rune of Endurance]

Effect: The durability of equipped items recovers by 1 per second.

Upon receiving the awaited reward, Ryu Min's lips stretched into a long smile.

'Great. Now I won't have to ask Russell to fix the durability anymore.'

Until now, whenever he returned to reality, he used to get the Orb of Eternal Rest repaired, but now it was no longer necessary.

Even without being a blacksmith, he could independently restore durability.

'With this, I can wear the Orb of Eternal Rest and endlessly increase my stats.'

However, in reality, there would be almost no need to use the orb.

Because the stacks only increased when killing monsters.

'Some may think they can increase the stacks by killing Millworms, but Millworms aren't monsters. They're insects.'

The Slaughter Rune that increases stacks when killing a target only applies to actual monsters.

'However, it doesn't mean it's entirely useless in reality.'

Though he mentioned that there would be almost no need to use the orb, he didn't say there was no need.

That statement implied that monsters also appeared in reality.

"Then, the one leading the way. I hope to meet you again next time."

After saying that, Himer led the way and left with the dwarves.

As they disappeared to the point of being invisible, the same message appeared in the players' eyes.

[Safely escorted Dwarf Summit to the destination.] [Completed the quest to escort Dwarf Summit.] [Shortly after, everyone will receive experience points as a successful escort reward.] [The amount of experience given is twice that of the monsters hunted by yourself and party members.]

"Wow, is this for real? Twice the experience points from all the mobs we've killed?"

"That's quite a lot, isn't it?"

"Since it's a party, we'll all go up together, right?"

Unable to identify the betrayers was regrettable, but the mood among the players lightened with the news of double experience points.

As the rewards finally came in, voices of admiration echoed from various places.
ChatGPT

Min Ju-ri and Seo Arin were no different.

"Wow, the experience points are quite abundant. Black Scythe, I've already reached level 38."

"Oh, really? Congratulations."

"Black Scythe, what level have you reached?"

"Me?"

Ryu Min licked his lips, and Min Ju-ri asked again.

"I'm sorry, what did you say?"

Thinking he might have misheard.

"I'm at level 70."

It was a level that could be astonishing, and understandably so.
