Title: "Episode 165 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max Level Player"

Jeffrey Bishop

Jeffrey Bishop, who grew up in an ordinary household, became an orphan at the age of 11.

It was due to a shooting incident involving a mentally unstable neighbor that resulted in the loss of his parents.

With no relatives, he struggled with severe stress during his adolescence and lived as a homeless person.

Having lost the will to live, he continued his existence by intercepting leftover food from the store's customers.

'There is no god in this world.'

He believed that the loss of his parents was God's fault.

He thought it was because this world is imperfect.

Filled with anger towards God, he went to the most famous church in the neighborhood and questioned relentlessly.

"Why do I have to suffer like this? Why did God choose to take away our parents?"

The response from the priest Nathan to the boy's bitter question was clear.

"We are the ones who believe God is right. How can I know God's will? If you want to know, go and ask God yourself."

Though stunned by the priest's words, Jeffrey pondered over the last statement.

'Ask God myself? Ask directly if curious?'

He was curious.

Curious about what answer God would give.

It felt like finding a way in the vast ocean.

Since that day, Jeffrey relied on the church.

Under Nathan's guidance, he studied the Bible.

He sought to decipher God's will and hoped to meet God.

'I will definitely meet God and ask.'

For the first time, an opportunity came into his life.

Fueled by anger, he continued his life.

In the process, Nathan, who raised and cared for him, became a father, a mentor, and a guiding star in his life.

The reason why 28-year-old Jeffrey still unconditionally obeys his commands is because of the lifelong debt of gratitude he owes.

Therefore, he treated his daughter, Kristin, with firmness.

But the human heart is truly cunning.

Could it be because life became comfortable?

After more than 17 years, Kristin, who had been observed, started to appear as a potential partner one day.

'I shouldn't be like this. This shouldn't happen...'

Despite self-blame and even trying to slap sense into himself, he couldn't help but have feelings for her.

He only hid those feelings deep inside his heart.

'You must never reveal that you have feelings for Kristin. It would be an act of betrayal towards Nathan, who is practically like a father.'

Jeffrey had kept his one-sided love hidden even as the world descended into chaos with the appearance of angels.

Even now, under Nathan's command, he continued to do the same.

"It seems Kristin is going to Korea to meet her fiancé this time. I heard that she insisted on bringing Jeffrey along, but I strongly denied it."

"Maybe it would be uncomfortable if I intervened between them."

"Do you think I wouldn't know my own daughter? Do Kristin's actions seem like she likes her fiancé in your eyes? She's not going to meet her fiancé; she wants to meet the prophet."

"Come to think of it... the next one is the destined 11th round."

Jeffrey muttered as if just recalling it now.

While making up his mind to somehow protect Kristin in the 11th round.

"Yes. Meeting the prophet must be the reason. So, Jeffrey, you should go to Korea as well. Of course, keep it a secret from Kristin."

"Are you telling me to follow her?"

"Yes. Secretly watch over Kristin from behind. And report everything she does to me. It would be even better if you could eavesdrop on the conversation with the prophet."

"I will carry out the order in the name of God."

After that, Jeffrey followed Kristin to Korea.

And while sitting on a bench, he overheard the voices of the two engaged in conversation.

'I should maintain a distance of 30 meters just in case I trigger any detection.'

Even though it was 30 meters, the surroundings were so quiet that it wasn't difficult to hear the conversation.

But was it a mistake to eavesdrop on the conversation?

Watching the prophet repeatedly refuse Kristin's requests, Jeffrey became angry.

"What difference does it make to the damn future if you hide information like that in just one word?"

Since it was a matter of life and death for his unrequited love, Jeffrey's empathy was stronger than usual.

'Phew. Let's calm down. Calm down and think about what I can do to help.'

How could he assist Kristin? Even if he had to sacrifice his life in the 11th round to protect her, it wasn't enough.
ChatGPT

It would be great to have information about the attacking party, but the prophet stubbornly keeps his mouth shut.

'Forgot? He's definitely lying to avoid giving information.'

Why?

Is it because he's afraid the future might change?

'Well, if the result turns out different from his own prophecy, he'll likely lose credibility from the people who believed in him.'

In other words, despite knowing that Kristin is in danger to protect his position as a prophet, he's letting go.

'Come to think of it, this annoys me.'

With a livid gaze, he watched the prophet enter the company.

Then he made a decision.

Even if he had to use force or intimidation, he would extract information from the prophet.

"Thank you for the information on the 11th round."

"Thank you, Prophet."

Makyungrok and the Kristin couple expressed gratitude towards Ryumin.

"Let's all do well in the 11th round."

After shaking hands, Ryumin left the company.

He had initially planned to attend the meeting, but today he decided to take a break.

'Someone is waiting for me to come out.'

He deliberately didn't look, but Ryumin was well aware that someone was trailing behind him.

'The guy following me is probably the one who was spying on Kristin and me from the bench earlier.'

Even though he was following from beyond 30 meters to avoid detection, there was no way he wouldn't notice.

Ryumin had a rune from the rune package.

[Sensory Rune]

Effect: Doubles the range of sensory detection, allowing the ability to hear and smell everything within the extended range.

The sensory rune he drew from the package was a rune he had never seen before.

In short, it enhanced sensory detection.

'A very useful rune.'

With the range doubled, he couldn't help but notice the trailing person.

Moreover, he even heard the guy muttering in English.

"What difference does it make to the damn future if you hide information like that in just one word."

It was at this moment that Ryumin noticed the tail.

'He must be the one who has some grudge against me.'

Using English and harboring ill feelings towards a fellow prophet...

'I can roughly guess who it is, but to be sure, I need to drag him out.'
ChatGPT

Even though he had come by car, Ryumin deliberately walked a distance.

And when it was convenient for the guy to reveal his true colors, he entered an alley.

Only upon reaching a deserted place did the guy take the bait.

"Mr. Prophet."

At the moment Ryumin turned his head at the English words from behind.

Thunk!

The tail grabbed his neck and forcefully pushed him against the wall.

"Cough...! J-Jeffrey?"

The belatedly identified pursuer turned out to be a servant who had been following Kristin.

While enduring the painful grip, Ryumin calmly assessed the situation in his mind.

'Was it this guy after all? Why does he harbor ill feelings towards me? Shall I try reading his thoughts?'

Looking into the eyes full of vitality, Ryumin quickly grasped the situation as he saw the guy squeezing his neck.

'He's angry because I didn't provide information to Kristin.'

Come to think of it, he heard that the guy was practically raised by Nathan and was like family.

'Loving Kristin in such a complicated situation. Could it be related to Kristin?'

Just to be sure, he delved deeper into the guy's thoughts and found out that it had nothing to do with Kristin; it was a personal action.

'Let's try to play along for now.'

Ryumin put on a more convincing act of agony than before.

"Ugh, J-Jeffrey! I can't breathe. P-Please let go!"

Perhaps due to his excellent acting, Jeffrey unconsciously released his grip on Ryumin's throat.

'He probably doesn't really intend to kill me.'

Having read his thoughts, Ryumin clearly saw the guy's intentions.

He was just trying to intimidate and get the information he hadn't given to Kristin.

Coughing and rubbing his throat, Ryumin, in a weak voice, exclaimed, "What on earth are you doing?"

"Prophet. I don't like you. I've been suspicious of you from the beginning. Predicting the future? You seem like a pure scam artist."

"A scam artist? Haven't I already proven my ability?"

"Of course, now I believe your words. But that doesn't change the fact that I don't like you."

Jeffrey glared threateningly.

In his hand, he held a dagger that appeared out of nowhere.

Ryumin, sensing the atmosphere, swallowed hard.

"W-Why are you doing this? What do you want?"

"Information."

"What?"

"I want information about the person harming Kristin."
ChatGPT

"I-I don't know about that."

"I overheard a conversation with Kristin. Even when asked to reveal the culprit, he firmly refused, claiming not to remember."

"Since you overheard the conversation, you must know. It was unavoidable. If the future changes, it would be troublesome..."

"Yeah, it would be troublesome. If the future changes, you'll lose credibility as a prophet. It must be very inconvenient for you."

Jeffrey, who had been speaking calmly, suddenly opened his eyes wide.

It was a gaze filled with simmering anger.

"However, that doesn't mean I should let Kristin be in danger."

"It's not letting her be in danger..."

"Enough with the excuses."

A cold sensation of a dagger touched Ryumin's neck.

"Don't say a word. Speak honestly about everything you've seen. Who is harming Kristin, and who is the person saving her."

"I-if I refuse?"

"Then this dagger will come out through your throat."

It was a terrifying threat, but having read his thoughts, Ryumin knew.

Despite the harsh words, the guy had no intention of causing harm.

'Even so, this is too reckless.'

What he was doing now was clear extortion, and even stepping back would be considered attempted murder.

'Is he blinded by love, making such thoughtless moves?'

With the thought of needing to change this habit, Ryumin put his hand in his pocket.

Seeing him fumbling with something, Jeffrey grabbed his hand abruptly.

A phone slipped out of Ryumin's hand.

"What are you trying to do with the phone?"

Upon checking, he found that the recording function was on.

Jeffrey immediately pressed the power button and turned off the phone.

"Why? What do you intend to do by recording?"

"I'll submit it as evidence to the police. This is clearly extortion and attempted murder."

"Haha, the player is going to report to the police. You're quite helpful."

"Or I'll let Kristin and her family know what you've done."

"Go ahead and try. The corpse might be able to speak, but who knows."

"Sigh... Why on earth are you doing this? What kind of ill feelings do you have towards me?"

"I don't have any ill feelings in particular. But if you don't disclose the information, who knows what might happen."

"You said you didn't know who was targeting Kristin."
ChatGPT

"Do you think I'm clueless? Even knowing, you won't tell me?"

"Do you expect me to willingly reveal everything just because of this? I can't change the future."

"Anyway, if you don't speak now, your future is non-existent. You'll die."

Despite Jeffrey's threat, Ryumin didn't back down or show fear. Instead, he stared back confidently.

"Some things can't be done even if a knife is at your throat. The moment I divulge future information to this person and that person, the future changes. The future I knew is already gone, shattered into pieces, and I've fallen from a prophet to a quack."

"...."

"You need to handle tangled threads of the future with caution. It's not something you can achieve through threats. Once you get information and you change your actions, the future might change again. Why don't you think about the possibility of harming Kristin instead?"

Was Ryumin's persuasion effective? After a silence that lasted for a while, the dagger disappeared from Jeffrey's hand.

"My thinking was shortsighted. Your words make sense."

"I'm not saying that as an apology, right?"

"Hey, Mr. Prophet. Do you expect me to apologize? It would be awkward to act self-important just because I put away the knife. Don't forget that I can pull it out again at any time."

"...."

Leaving only those words behind, Jeffrey disappeared without offering an apology.

"Ugh, he didn't yield even to threats."

On the plane back to his home country, Jeffrey remembered the prophet who didn't yield and stood his ground.

"How can he remain so calm even with a knife at his throat?"

At first, there was a sense of fear, but when he mentioned the prophecy, the expression changed entirely.

Seemingly driven by a sense of duty or strong beliefs.

'I couldn't believe that he didn't yield even in a situation where a knife was at his throat.'

Although it seemed like he was reluctant to yield, it was surprising.

'Is it impossible to easily reveal specific future information even if it means losing one's life?'

Jeffrey couldn't fathom the mindset of the prophet, but one thing was certain.

'At least, he won't needlessly disclose information to others.'

A person who chooses their words carefully is someone you can trust.
ChatGPT

The trust in the prophet increased after this incident, but it didn't make things seem entirely positive.

"No flexibility, no flexibility. Won't budge even a bit for a hint?"

To put it nicely, it was inflexible, but to say it negatively, it lacked flexibility.

"There's no other choice. Since it's come to this, I can only protect Kristin with my own hands."

Unaware that there were surprisingly many people wanting to protect her, Jeffrey returned to the church with Kristin.

Of course, the fact that he followed Kristin was a secret, so he took a short break before entering.

"Hello, Mr. Jeffrey."

In the office, Kristin, who had been talking with Nathan, greeted him.

"Hello, Kristin."

"Hello, not you. I mean, for whom."

"....?"

Confused by the cold response, Jeffrey raised an eyebrow when he saw Nathan extending a phone towards him.

"What's this?"

"The prophet sent a file to Kristin. Press play."

When he pressed what seemed like an audio file, a familiar voice began to play.

-Why? What are you going to do with the recording?

-We're going to submit it as evidence to the police. This is clearly coercion and attempted murder.

-Why not try it? I don't know if a corpse can speak, but who knows?

-You said you didn't know who was targeting Kristin, right?

-Do you think I'm clueless? Even knowing, you won't tell me?

-Do you think I'll willingly tell you everything just because of this? I can't change the future.

-Anyway, if you don't speak now, your future is non-existent. You'll die.

Jeffrey was perplexed as he listened to the recording.

It was his unmistakable voice, saying things that he didn't recall.

'What happened? I'm sure I turned off the phone at that time.'

There was a hypothesis that suddenly popped into his mind.

'Could it be that I had two phones?'

His mind went blank with only one thought.

'I've been had.'

Swallowing hard, he looked up.

Nathan and Kristin were glaring at him with intimidating eyes.
