Title: "Episode 297 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player"

Untraceable

The environment changed in an instant.

Warping from a colorless space to a vague forest somewhere.

Ryumin calmly brought up the quest progress window without showing any signs of confusion.

[SilentSnapper / Face / 602m] [RoseStone / Face / 828m] [Meteos / Face / 1,029m] [LiveWithoutRegrets / Face / 1,182m]

………………

…………

……

[Current remaining players: 143] [Time remaining until the end of the round: 71:59:55]

As the angel's words indicated, the nickname, face, and distance were displayed in the progress window.

It was convenient to see them sorted in the order of the closest players.

"They've all scattered."

Even using the perimeter exploration skill that could see within a radius of 500m, no players were visible.

The fantasy world was as vast as South Korea, and with only 143 participants, it was natural not to see anyone.

"First, I should change my appearance, right?"

Someone might be trying to track him.

It could be Arthas or another human.

"Changing my face may not necessarily evade Arthas's tracking, but it won't hurt to try."

Ryumin, wearing the Assassin's Mask, changes his face.

The changed face is none other than Hwang Yongmin.

On a whim, he puts on the Ring of the Doppleganger and changes his nickname to [Hwang Yongmin].

"This way, the Black Scythe on the list will show [Untraceable]."

Changing appearance doesn't exclude him from the list.

Only the mark of being untraceable shows.

Since the system checks and tracks registered nicknames and faces, changing either one makes tracking impossible.

Even though Ryumin changed both just in case Arthas might ambush.

"Even if I use a skill to track separately, it'll be the same."

Now, no one can track him.

He is completely free.

"It's awkward to go around with Hwang Yongmin's face, but it doesn't matter. As long as I can avoid being tracked by others."

Of course, unless someone is insane, there won't be fools trying to track the Black Scythe.

However, there is no guarantee that there aren't any crazy individuals among the players.

"Do you know? During hunting, there might be a crazy person trying to ambush me."

Killing oneself not only reduces the number of participants but also grants dominance, so there might be someone attempting it.

In the previous rounds, didn't Ma Kyung-rok and Ju Seong-tak try to kill him?

"The situation is different now compared to before."

Previously, only three survived, and there was only one survivor spot. So, working together to eliminate the strongest, which happened to be him, was probably their best option.

In Ryumin's view, it was a rational decision.

"But in the end, those two were the ones who died."

No matter how highly ranked Ma Kyung-rok and Ju Seong-tak were, they couldn't handle Ryumin alone.

Given that Ryumin has become thousands of times stronger than the previous round, is there anyone now who can stand against him?

"It's like a fly diving at an elephant."

Even so, if a fly clouds the vision of an elephant, it can be bothersome.

Changing appearance and hunting was psychologically comfortable for Ryumin.

"For now, I need to hunt."

Ryumin, soaring into the sky, stopped as if lying, thanks to the Eternal Gear that allowed him to tread the air.

"This place is between the Albitz Kingdom and the Dekan Kingdom."

Observing the surrounding landscape and identifying his location, Ryumin turned his gaze.

To encounter strong monsters, he needed to go in that direction.

After deciding the direction, he dashed through the sky.

Kwaaaang-!

The sonic boom closed the distance in an instant.

At a glance, the 19th-round quest doesn't seem difficult.

It was a simple quest of enduring for 72 hours.

"But you won't know until you try. It's difficult to endure for three days."

There is a so-called "333 Rule."

You can survive for 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, and 3 weeks without food.

However, here, without water and food, enduring for three days is a challenging mission.

"It's not an easy mission. It's more difficult than I thought."

Of course, there is water and food in the vicinity.
ChatGPT

It might have been created to nurture players, but this place is undeniably a real-world existence.

Even though they appear as NPCs, the people here are not much different from reality, and the living environment is also similar.

"Avatars are the same way. They were made to resemble real human bodies, right?"

Therefore, even avatars, created as they are, feel hunger and basic physiological needs.

It's not like they can't feel anything, as in a game.

"But that doesn't mean you should just pick up and eat anything."

In the past, Ryumin picked and ate fruits from a tree to alleviate hunger.

"No, it was something that looked like fruit."

A few hours later, it turned Ryumin's insides upside down.

He also tried drinking water from a stream, but it made his skin flip and his vision go dark, as if he had consumed poison.

"The worst was the meat of monsters among them."

Hungry to the point of desperation, Ryumin once tried scraping off and grilling the flesh of a dead monster, only to experience his stomach twisting until the end of the round.

Thanks to such experiences, Ryumin can firmly say that you shouldn't eat anything in this realm.

"In the village, there might be water and food for people, but..."

The problem is that there's a barrier preventing access to the village.

Apart from that, you can roam anywhere, but finding something edible is a challenging task.

The quest given initially was to endure with mental strength without relying on such things.

"Just endure for 72 hours while minimizing movement to conserve energy."

But if it were that easy, would it be the 19th round quest?

Remaining still and absentminded might lead to a player sneaking up and striking at any moment.

It was a round where you had no choice but to avoid other people.

However, excluding the village, most areas are monster spawn locations.

While the strength may vary depending on the location, the presence of monsters is as dangerous as players.

"No matter how much you've surpassed level 90, there's no business in a dungeon."

When outnumbered by monsters with an advantage, one can only die or become exhausted.

Of course, this didn't apply to Ryumin.

Thump, thump!

Before the imposing giant monster could approach, Ryumin's scythe cleaved through both sides along with the tree.

[Twin Headed Ogre defeated!] [Experience gained is increased by 1.5 times due to title effect.] [Experience and gold are doubled thanks to the Rune of Predation.] [Obtained 12 stacks and 2 stat points from the Rune of Predation.] [Accumulated Predation stacks: 286] [This player can no longer increase experience points.] [Experience gained is displayed according to the Growth Rune.] [Experience +75,000] [Gold +50,000] [Additional gold +25,000] [Gained experience has exceeded 100,000.] [Experience is converted to 1 stat point.] [Current kill count: 3/100] [All stats increased by 3% due to the Rune of Slaughter.]

Although at the max level, the level did not increase, Ryumin could convert incoming experience into stats.

This was all thanks to the first max-level reward, the [Growth Rune].

"With the title for leading the way, experience is 1.5 times, and with the Rune of Predation, experience is doubled..."

Just killing a few monsters could result in acquiring a massive amount of stat points.

"In reality, this round is practically the last round where I can gather stats. I need to gather as much as possible while I still can."

Killing even the Archangel in preparation for the 20th round boss, how strong could it be? Ryumin couldn't afford not to prepare for that moment.

Even considering the showdown with Arthas, he needed to gather stats.

Squelch! Squelch!

Ryumin roamed around, slaughtering monsters.

Killing them was not difficult, as a single strike was often enough.

He didn't need to worry about his health diminishing either, as the Strength stat was associated with health.

"With a strength stat in the tens of millions, I could focus on hunting for days without any problems."

However, other players didn't need to waste their strength hunting monsters like Ryumin.

For Ryumin, who still had plenty of strength, it was an effortless action, but other players would quickly tire even with just a few monster kills.

In any case, after this round, everyone would reach max level as a completion reward, so there was no need for them to accumulate experience separately.

So, they could simply defeat the approaching monsters.

"It might not be easy for non-combat players, though."
ChatGPT

Especially support players with relatively low stats would be concerned.

"Already with low stats, if they have to run around day and night avoiding other players, they're bound to get tired. Plus, it seems like monsters will appear without a break."

There were concerns for relatively weak support players, especially for Christine, who had no combat abilities.

It would be challenging for her to hunt monsters alone, and she could easily become a target.

"Still, it shouldn't be a big problem. I've sent slaves to some members to watch over them."

She had dispatched slaves to a few members to guard them.

"Just join and guard."

"Although I can't completely relax."

For now, she needed to clear the monsters here and then go check on her acquaintances.

It was also a chance to confirm whether the slaves were carrying out their mission.

Players who encountered the 19th-round quest without prior information were all surprised.

Minjuri was no exception.

"Survive for 72 hours. Alone?"

Worries arose, but there was no choice but to proceed.

Contemplating what to do next, she looked at the quest progress window.

As the angel had said, the nicknames, faces, and distances were clearly visible.

"Should I go see the Black Scythe?"

Instinctively, such a thought crossed her mind, but at some point, the tracking became untraceable.

"Weird? Why can't I track him?"

At that puzzling moment.

"Huh?"

The distance between her and the player on the list seemed to be decreasing.

"What's going on? Is he coming towards me?"

Approaching each other nervously in a round where they had to kill each other?

She had to be cautious.

"For now, I need to increase the distance."

Minjuri moved without hesitation.

However, where she had landed was a forest.

She didn't know where to go.

What if she encountered monsters along the way?

Turning on the perimeter exploration, she saw numerous red dots.

"There's a distance from other players. In that case..."

Red dots meant monsters all around.

It seemed like she had landed in a dangerous place.

Rustle—

Thinking she needed to get out of the forest quickly, she hurriedly moved her steps.
ChatGPT

As Minjuri moved, fortunately, the distance between her and the player who was chasing her widened.

"Where should I go? I can't go to Black Scythe..."

The forest was vast, and she didn't know which way to go to exit.

"For now, let's avoid them."

She activated her perimeter exploration skill and moved toward an area where there seemed to be fewer monsters.

Whenever the distance seemed to shorten, she cleverly hid behind a tree, waiting for the monsters to pass.

"What kind of monster is that? I've never seen such a monster before."

A monster with a long, tree-like appearance slowly walked.

It was a powerful monster known as "Dark Ancient Tree," but Minjuri had no way of knowing that.

She had no confidence in facing it.

"It passed. Let's run away quickly..."

At that moment, Minjuri felt a shiver.

She sensed someone approaching from behind through her perception skill.
