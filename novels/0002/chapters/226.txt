Title: Episode 226 of the 100th Regression for Max Level Players

Episode 226. Accumulation of Results for Round 13

★ Accumulation of Results for Round 13 ★

[Integrated Zone CA-EA001]

└ 1st place. Black Scythe (Lv92 Reaper) 00:00:00

└ 2nd place. Russell Daniel (Lv62 Blacksmith) 04:04:29

└ 3rd place. Democracy (Lv62 Buffer) 06:08:06

"This time, Black Scythe is first again."

"Well, that's how it is."

"The time difference between 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place is quite significant, isn't it?"

"But what does 0 seconds mean?"

The curiosity of the players murmuring was soon resolved by an angel.

[As you can see, the time next to the nickname is the time achieved up to a very friendly level. 0 seconds means it was achieved before the start of the round.]

"Ah..."

"It seems they've already reached a very friendly level."

Although they nodded as if they understood, it wasn't a time to relax while looking at other people's achievements.

For those in the lower ranks, the time of fearful annihilation was approaching.

[Nearly 80% of humans have raised their reputation up to a very friendly level? Fortunately! Unlike the previous round, there were no failures. But the important thing is how quickly it was achieved, right?]

While the angel laughed and giggled, the faces of the players were filled with tension.

Since their rankings had not yet appeared as messages, they couldn't know whether it was survival or annihilation.

[Now, each of you can check your ranking messages.]

Messages were delivered to each player according to the angel's signal.

"Ah! I, I survived!"

"Nice!"

"I'm ranked 4,998th?"

"No way! Darn it!"

Laughter and sighs were heard from various places.

Cheers and lamentations echoed.

It was the moment when the decision for a trip to heaven or hell was made, so it was natural.

[The record for the cutoff line, 4,997th place, is 7 hours, 59 minutes, and 05 seconds. Congratulations! Survival up to this point, and below is all elimination. Goodbye then.]

"No, I don't want to!"

"Save me! Give me one more chance!"

Puff-

Ignoring the cries of the people, ashes scattered as half of the already sparse crowd diminished, leaving a sense of emptiness.

"Then let's proceed with the reward distribution time!" "Congratulations! You have achieved the quest as the 1st in this area!" "Currently, 'Black Scythe' is ranked 1st in this area." "As the 1st place reward for this area, you will receive the 'Legendary Potion Selection Box!'" "As the 1st place reward for this area, you will also receive the 'Special Reward Selection Box!'"

Upon seeing the awarded rewards, Ryu Min was the first to use the potion selection box.

"Please touch the potion you desire among the following."

└ 1. Potion of Life

└ 2. Potion of Rapid Regeneration

└ 3. Potion of Indomitable Resistance

└ 4. Potion of Memory Erasure

└ 5. Potion of Immunity

All of them are of legendary grade. Each one is a valuable potion.

"If I didn't receive the Elf's reward in the 8th round or if I hadn't cleared the Tower of Trials up to the 99th floor, I would have chosen the Potion of Rapid Regeneration to prepare for the 15th round. However..."

Ryu Min chose the 4th option, Potion of Memory Erasure.

The others were not necessary. He had become strong enough.

Finally, when he chose the special reward selection box, options appeared.

"You can choose one of the following special rewards. Please touch the reward you desire."

└ 1. Stat Boost Buff (Limited to Round 14) - 50% increase

└ 2. Temporary Skill – Invincibility (Limited to Round 14)

└ 3. Information about Round 14

Ryu Min was always quick to choose when it came to reward selection time. However, this time, Ryu Min couldn't help but hesitate.

"There's a high possibility that the Archangel will appear in Round 14."

Being a suspect who killed four Archangels, he would do anything to seek revenge.

"If I plan to face the Archangel, I should choose option 1."

Increasing stats would further enhance the Devil's Blessing reward. Naturally, choosing option 1 would be the best, but other options bothered him.

"Option 2, temporary skill invincibility. This could be useful in Round 14. I can also obtain the essential [Rune of Predation]."

Without option 2, obtaining the rune would be impossible. It was a rune he had considered an absolute must-have.

"If the Archangels don't come, I would definitely choose option 2, but..."

Would they just stand by quietly? This time as well, they would take advantage of the opening to target his life in Round 14.

"Phew, this is really a dilemma."

Ryu Min, contemplating his decision before making the choice, finally moved his finger.
ChatGPT

"I have chosen option 2." "When Round 14 begins, the temporary skill 'Invincibility' will be granted."

He decided to prioritize obtaining the rune over the stat buff. "Having invincibility is not a bad thing. It might come in handy when dealing with the Archangel."

If the Archangels 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places appear simultaneously? No matter how high Ryu Min's stats are, there is no guarantee of victory. In such a situation, invincibility, which decides the outcome more effectively than a 50% stat buff, might be the better choice.

"I hope they don't come if possible. Since I've chosen option 2, the Archangels will only be a hindrance."

◀ ROUND 13 Ends ▶

[Integrated Zone CA-EA001]

└ Survivors: 4,997

"After a while, your soul will transition into your original dimension." "Round 14 will start on February 1, 2023, at midnight. Congratulations on surviving. See you in the next round."

In the cabin, three men had serious expressions. They were the remaining members of the 12 Disciples.

"Come at me, you piece of X! I'll cut your head off right away."

"Even if you're angry, you should listen. Yang Chweon-nim, who might have his reasons."

"What reasons? X! We agreed to meet in Round 13, and he just left without a word."

"..."

"I never liked that guy from the beginning. Should have killed him off like that Curry Man."

"But since he contacted us and came this way, let's hear what he has to say."

Despite Spagnard's persuasion, Yang Chweon just snorted.

"Damn it. Hey, Dark Soul."

"Yes?"

"Get ready to snipe at the door. If that guy opens the door and comes in, shoot him in the head and kill him..."

It was then.

Click-

As the cabin door opened, the person at the center of attention walked in. None other than John Delgado.

"This piece of X!"

"Hey, why are you like this? Calm down."

Ignoring the agitated Yang Chweon and Spagnard trying to calm him, John sat down casually, as usual.

"Why is that bastard so calm? It's pissing me off."

"Why are you so angry?"

"What?"

Seeing John's expression that seemed to ask what was going on, Yang Chweon was dumbfounded.
ChatGPT

His face, burning red, seemed like it would explode at any moment.

Before the situation could deteriorate further, Spagnard quickly intervened.

"John Delgado-nim, why did you act like that in Round 13?"

"What are you talking about?"

"Surely you haven't forgotten? In the other world, we agreed to meet and track Zephy. You're the only one who knows Zephy's face."

"Oh, that thing."

"Why didn't you gather at the agreed-upon location? You said we would meet at the closest spot where angels could be seen..."

"Sorry, I forgot."

"For...got?"

Spagnard sighed, disappointed by the reason that turned out to be more anticlimactic than expected.

Yang Chweon, in the end, erupted in anger, his frustration bursting out.

"You have plenty of things to forget, don't you? Just forget everything and become an X! You X!"

"This bastard talks like a gangster with a dirty mouth."

"Who the hell is this guy!?"

"Enough, enough! We didn't gather here to fight, right? Right?"

With Spagnard and Dark Soul mediating, a major incident was averted.

However, the gazes between Yang Chweon and John were filled with hostility, as if they were ready to kill each other.

"People can forget things, right? That's possible, isn't it?"

"Forget my ass! That bastard is lying. He deliberately planned to screw us over!"

"Alright, alright! We didn't gather here to fight. Right?"

"Alright, alright! We didn't gather here to fight. Right?"

Spagnard stood up from his seat, leaving the uncomfortable atmosphere.

"Well, since the atmosphere isn't great, let's end the meeting here for today. John-nim, I apologize for ending it so soon after you arrived. Let's call it a day."

"What a pointless step I took."

As John opened the cabin door first, Spagnard hastily spoke.

"Oh, get a grip on yourself. I forgot to mention something important. We'll leave soon. You can go ahead. See you next time."

John didn't respond and went outside.

Only after completely leaving the range of detection did Spagnard cautiously speak up.
ChatGPT

"I'm sure you all noticed, but John Delgado intentionally kept himself apart. He has something important to discuss."

"What's the matter?"

Spagnard expressed his honest thoughts.

"In my opinion, John Delgado seems to be in league with the Black Scythe."

"In league?"

"Honestly, it's not a difficult operation to forget. Unless he has dementia."

"Indeed, it's an absurd excuse."

"So, I'm suspicious. Zephy, Black Scythe, John Delgado. The possibility that they are all in league."

Bang!

Yang Chweon slammed the table, his face fiery.

"X! I knew it would be like this. Traitor!"

"He probably didn't betray us willingly."

"What are you talking about?"

"Have you forgotten? Black Scythe has authority."

"Oh..."

"He probably went to find Black Scythe in Round 12 and got caught, ending up being dominated in return. Forced to become his subordinate."

Whether it was a plausible argument or not, Yang Chweon and Dark Soul were stunned.

"Eh? Then, aren't we in danger? Our information might have been exposed to Black Scythe."

"Probably. John might have revealed a lot."

Without even realizing that information had already leaked, the three became serious.

"What should we do? Instead of being so relaxed, shouldn't we disperse immediately?"

"Hey. Do you think that guy can't track us? The lackey in front of that bastard knows all our faces. Probably guiding each of us like a navigation system for Black Scythe."

"In other words, it means our lives are at stake, right?"

Although Dark Soul trembled in fear, Spagnard remained calm.

"There is one way to survive."

"Bow down to Black Scythe. Something like that. That bastard has power."

"It's not like that."

"Then?"

Yang Chweon and Dark Soul focused on Spagnard's words.

"We retaliate against him first."

"Are you crazy? What can the three of us do?"

"It's reckless. Knowing what kind of monster Black Scythe is..."

"Dark Soul-nim, you seem to have lost a lot of confidence compared to the beginning."

As if struck at the core, Dark Soul flinched.
ChatGPT

"Where did that confident attitude of being unrivaled in sniping go?"

"W-Well, I still have confidence. Even if it's Black Scythe, wouldn't he die if his head explodes? But that's only if he comes to the sniper location..."

"That's right. It's about luring Black Scythe to the sniper location. Of course, the lure will be done by me and Yang Chweon."

"What? You want me to be the bait?"

"There's no other way, isn't there? If we can't avoid it, we have to confront it."

Spagnard's words were persuasive.

If they continued to be careless, they might be assassinated by Black Scythe at any moment.

"There's a saying that even a cornered rat will bite the cat. We have no choice but to make the first move."

"Do you have a plan in mind?"

"First, let's contact John Delgado and express our desire to meet Black Scythe through him. Let's propose to meet under the pretense of catching up. We'll decide on the location ourselves. When Black Scythe comes to the sniper location?"

"We just shoot him in the head?"

At Dark Soul's words, Spagnard nodded.

"Yes. As the target might let their guard down, Yang Chweon and I will personally move to attract attention."

"No, two are not enough. Can we bring in one more person?"

"Of course. Yang Chweon, do you have anyone you can ask for help?"

"I have a player ranked 2nd in the underworld hierarchy under me. If we team up, it might be helpful."

"Great. The three of us will play the decoy roles, and Dark Soul will be in charge of the sniper. Are you confident?"

"As long as I draw attention, anyone can smash their heads."

Dark Soul's face showed confidence that had disappeared without notice.

While hitting a moving target might be difficult, the situation changes when they enter the sniper's location.

"Really? You're sure you can kill even Black Scythe?"

"Don't worry, Yang Chweon. Even Black Scythe is just a person. Of course, we can kill him."

"Can we? Tell me for sure. If you fail, we all die."

"I won't fail. Just make sure to properly attract his attention so he doesn't move. I thought I might as well try eating the area representative while we're at it."
