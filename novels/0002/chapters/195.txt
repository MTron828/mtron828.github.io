Title: "Chapter 195 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max Level Player"

Countermeasure Meeting

Tap, tap -

Unlike the warm atmosphere inside where the firewood in the fireplace was burning, the mood was gloomy.

"What are you saying? Didn't we come here to discuss countermeasures?"

"...We need a plan before we can talk."

Five people were sitting at the table prepared in the cabin.

Spaend, Dark Soul, Yang Chwiwen, John Delgado, and Ryu Min disguised as Swingman.

Although the five of them, who had become disciples, had put their heads together to think of a way to confront the Black Scythe, the silence had persisted for 30 minutes.

No matter how much they thought, there was no answer.

The impatient Spaend spoke up.

"The Black Scythe killed seven of our disciples. Naturally, we should seek revenge. However... in other words, it's an existence that we couldn't handle even with seven. It seems difficult to overpower it with force."

"So? Are you suggesting we surrender?"

Yang Chwiwen, who seemed displeased from her tone, tilted her head as if to say 'No,' but Spaend shook his head.

"There's nothing to surrender to. The Black Scythe doesn't know us. We just need to let go of ourselves."

"Give up like this?"

Nodding his head, Dark Soul shouted as if it were unreasonable.

"What if we give up without even trying? We should at least attempt an assassination!"

"Didn't it come to this because we tried?"

"I haven't stepped up yet."

"Do you have confidence?"

"Of course! Lure the Black Scythe to the sniper location. I'll take out its brainstem right away!"

Although Dark Soul spoke confidently, Yang Chwiwen immediately shot back.

"So, we become bait for you?"

"That's how we can kill the Black Scythe. What if it fails? Will we all die? No, that's not it. Only we, the bait, will be wiped out. You, 2 kilometers away, will survive safely."

"Don't worry about that. I won't fail. My sniper skill is always on target."

"With such a great profession, how did you not make it to the top 3 in the previous zone?"

Dark Soul seemed perplexed as if struck in the vital spot.

"That, that's because the monsters move too well..."

"Yeah, I know. Just because you're good at assassinations doesn't mean you're good at hunting."

"Thank you for understanding..."

"But I can't leave everything in your hands. I don't want to be some kind of bait."

"Now is not the time to boast about your pride. There is no other way. The method I suggested is the most realistic!"

"Nonsense. X it."

Even though opinions were presented, it was not easy to reconcile due to differing thoughts.

"How about this? While listening to Yang Chwiwen's words, I thought, in the rounds so far, there have been individuals who consistently made it to the top 3 of the entire zone, not just the Black Scythe, right?"

"Oh, those [Heavenly Demons] and [Stupid Fools]?"

"Yeah, that's right. How about proposing recruitment to them? It seems that we are insufficient alone, and it's a time when we need to supplement our strength..."

"How do you plan to find them? We don't even know their nationality or faces. We only know their nicknames, right?"

"That's also a problem..."

Spaend, who had made the suggestion, fell into silence again.

After pondering, Yang Chwiwen voiced her opinion.

"In my opinion, a direct confrontation has no chance of winning. We should go thoroughly for assassination."

"If that's the case, my method..."

"Sniping has too much risk, you bastard. Listen. There's a better way."

Yang Chwiwen, who mocked Dark Soul, suddenly asked a question.

"When is the moment players become most vulnerable?"

"Well, let me think?"

"It's right when they enter the Otherworld. At that time, they fall into forced sleep and become completely defenseless. We've been waiting for each other in safe places for the entry into the Otherworld, fearing that point, right?"

"Yeah, that's right."

"We're targeting that. As you all know, my subordinates under the Black Society, who are hired for assassinations, are sharp and versatile. We're aiming for when the Black Scythe enters the Otherworld. Invading its home and taking care of it while it's there."

"Oh, if we do that, we can definitely kill it easily."

"How about it? Isn't it a good plan?"

"Yes. Now, we just need to find out where the Black Scythe lives."
ChatGPT

"But how do we find that out?"

Everyone looked at Yang Chwiwen with expectant eyes, but the response that came back was disappointing.

"That's something we need to think about from now on. I haven't thought about it more than that either."

"Hmm..."

When the Black Scythe enters the Otherworld, it assassinates using outsiders.

Even if the player is high-level, they can be easily killed.

"The plan is good. But the problem is that we need to find out where the Black Scythe's home is."

"How about using CPF members like this time to lure the Black Scythe and then follow it? Then we might be able to find out where its home is."

"What if we get caught while following it? It could cost us our lives that day."

"Of course, we have to follow without being noticed. Keep a distance of at least 30 meters to avoid triggering detection skills."

"Detection skills are not the problem. The problem is the surrounding exploration skill. Don't they detect up to a radius of 500 meters? But we can't follow from more than 500 meters away either."

"Indeed, following would be difficult."

"If you want to follow, you need an assassin class. If you use invisibility, it won't trigger detection skills, but it won't be caught in the surrounding exploration either."

"We don't have any assassins among us."

"That's right."

Five disciples, consisting of Gladiator, Hunter, Sniper, Tactics Master, and Martial Artist.

There is no profession among them that can safely follow.

Then, Ryu Min, seizing the opportunity, quietly raised her hand.

"I have a reliable assassin among my acquaintances. What if we talk to him?"

"Acquaintance? What's his name?"

"His name is Jeffrey. His nickname is [Jepi]."

"Is he a famous assassin?"

"No, he's not that skilled. However, as long as the pay is good, he's willing to do anything. He's the kind of person who will do any job if the payment is right. He'd be perfect for trailing."

"It's not easy to bring in an outsider like that..."

"Don't worry. He won't cause any trouble."

Even with Ryu Min's assurance, the disciples' expressions were reluctant, except for Yang Chwiwen.

"Can Kaireman unexpectedly be of help? If there's an assassin, we can hire him."

"But he's an outsider..."
ChatGPT

"Isn't it even better because he's an outsider? It's good for cutting ties cleanly. Just give him a clean task and cut ties when it's done. What's the problem?"

"Umm..."

Yang Chwiwen was full of determination to execute her plan now. If the plan succeeded, all the credit would come back to her.

After careful consideration, Spaend finally raised Yang Chwiwen's hand.

"Alright. Let's try Yang Chwiwen's plan. Before Round 12 starts, using the assassin hired by Swingman, we will identify the Black Scythe's residence and, on December 1st, assassinate it through the Black Society while the Black Scythe is asleep. If anyone has a better idea, please raise your hand now."

Since there was no other option, everyone expected silence, but surprisingly, one person raised their hand.

It was Ryu Min.

"Yes, Swingman. Do you have a different opinion?"

"Oh, it's not that I oppose Yang Chwiwen's plan. It just seems good to prepare insurance in case of failure."

"Insurance?"

"Yes. What if things don't go according to plan? Then the Black Scythe will still be alive in Round 12. At that time, I suggest using the method I proposed."

"What method?"

"Everyone is focused on killing the Black Scythe, but I suggest thinking the other way around. Let's simmer him as an ally."

"As an ally...?"

"To be honest, I think it's meaningless to compete with the Black Scythe in strength. He has already killed seven Rankers from a powerful country, and even John Delgado recognizes him. Is there any chance for us to win against a being that formidable, even if all twelve disciples attack? I don't think so."

"Swingman!"

The person who shouted with a face that suddenly turned pale, causing the table to bang, was none other than John Delgado.

"What nonsense are you talking about now? Are you suggesting surrendering to that tearing bastard?"

"There's no need to surrender. The Black Scythe doesn't know about our existence, just as Spaend mentioned."

"Is that not surrendering?"

"Listen to the end. It's not about completely making him an ally, but suggesting a truce."

"A truce?"
ChatGPT

"The more dangerous the enemy, the closer you should keep them," they said. "If we become close to the Black Scythe first, won't the success rate of the assassination increase when we betray him?"

"Oh, intentional befriending before betrayal, is that the plan?"

Spaend, seeming intrigued, nodded.

With a practical strategy, the other disciples also listened attentively, except for John Delgado, who had a personal grudge against the Black Scythe.

"To join hands with the one we should kill immediately. It's an unreasonable plan."

"Isn't it just a temporary alliance for the future rather than a real one? I'm okay with it."

"Me too. Considering Swingman's plan, it looks good."

"Well, it's only in case my plan fails. Well, as an alternative, it doesn't look bad."

Everyone, except John, showed a positive response.

Since a direct confrontation was impossible, there was no other way but to strike from behind.

"Let's consider John as opposed. What about others? Is there anyone who appreciates Swingman's plan?"

Spaend asked, but no one raised their hand.

"All right. By majority vote, we will consider Swingman's plan as an alternative in case Yang Chwiwen's plan fails. Now, shall we discuss how to become friends?"

To this question, once again, Ryu Min raised her hand.

"If Yang Chwiwen's plan fails, we should immediately switch to my plan. That means, to befriend the Black Scythe, we need to work in the Otherworld. But if a stranger approaches without reason, it will raise suspicions. So, it seems better to involve someone familiar to the Black Scythe. Fortunately, among us, there is someone who has a connection with the Black Scythe."

The gazes of the audience turned to someone who seemed to be involved in a prearrangement.

As John pointed at himself in confusion, Ryu Min continued, "You? Approach him?"

"Yes."

"Are you crazy? How do I know anything about the Black Scythe?"

"You do. Didn't you suffer greatly in Round 11?"

"But even so, why would such a suggestion come out?"

As if in disbelief, John shouted, but Ryu Min's words were not without reason.

"Among us, only John Delgado has seen the face of the Black Scythe. He is the only one who can naturally approach the Black Scythe with significance."

"Naturally? Where on earth? If you fail to ambush and end up writhing with your limbs cut off, and then come back asking for reconciliation, wouldn't anyone find it strange?"

"That's why you need to say it convincingly. Repent, express regret, apologize. It looks better than someone unfamiliar approaching, doesn't it?"

"No, no. That's your opinion. Others may not see it that way. Isn't that right?"

John sought agreement, looking at the other disciples, but the reactions were different from what he expected.

"Indeed, it seems better for John to approach than for us to do it."

"Right. Fate is also a connection, isn't it? If you approach with a nuance of regret, it could easily turn into an ally."

"I agree with Careman's words."

"All right. Then, unanimously, John will take the lead..."

'These bastards! What kind of unanimity is this! I didn't agree!'

John was infuriated by Spaend's declaration but realized belatedly.

'Could it be because they're afraid to take action themselves?'

These guys just needed a bait.

Because if things go wrong while striking the Black Scythe's back, they will be the ones to die.

'Damn bastards.'

With eyes filled with determination, John Delgado's gaze focused on one person.

'It's because of this guy. This guy incited them.'

The person he blamed for pushing him into a corner was none other than Swingman.

'Once Round 12 comes, I'll find and kill this guy first.'

With burning eyes, he vowed revenge, but Ryu Min, who could read his thoughts, was secretly chuckling.

After all, you can't find someone who's already dead.
