Title: "Episode 130 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player"

Sharing

Mid-August has passed.

During this time, Magyeongrok steadily dealt with the trash as planned.

"Magyeongrok has already killed close to 300 trash mobs."

However, there are still many pests in Pelseba.

Creatures that would undoubtedly harm ordinary people if left alone.

Therefore, Ryumin instructed the guild president to diligently create wanted posters.

Of course, it was a composite fishing using Photoshop.

"Just a bait, and the fish bite well."

Unlike Magyeongrok's workplace, Ryumin used the erasure skill in another warehouse, causing the disappearance of five corpses.

Similar to Magyeongrok, Ryumin was also dedicated to cleaning up the trash.

"Although I can't obtain dark mana, I can still loot items."

On the floor where the corpses vanished, there were items that Ryumin had torn out through torture.

Magic stones, unique materials, shop equipment items, miscellaneous items, and more.

Even criminals who managed to survive up to round 8 had a lot of items.

"I should combine shop equipment and unique materials to create some unique gear."

Currently, even though unique materials are available in the market, there is no unique gear for sale.

After all, no one knows how to make it.

"Since the unique crafting designs haven't been fully unlocked yet."

The drop of unique designs begins in earnest from round 9.

There probably won't be anyone who has found the recipe yet.

"Even if someone figures out how to make it, there won't be fools willing to sell unique gear they created."

Even if they do, they would use it themselves, not sell the excellent unique gear for real money.

Ryumin also had no intention of making unique items to sell.

With money overflowing in his pockets, and with the stock prices of Pelfel going through the roof, Ryumin, who has enough wealth for the three families to play around, had no need for more.

The reason Ryumin makes unique gear is simple.

It's to distribute them to potential future allies.

"They need to survive for it to be beneficial to me."

For now, he decided to make items for Minjuri and Kristin.

"Combining equipment with agility stats produces gear for Minjuri, while combining intelligence-based equipment results in unique gear for Kristin.

'Oh, she might feel left out, so I should make something for Magyeongrok too.'

I should make something for Russell, Seoarin, An Sang-chul, Heo Tae-seok, Jo Yong-ho, and even for Yum Tti.

'Why do I have so many people to take care of...?'

Upon reflection, that's not it. I don't have enough materials to take care of everyone.

With a sigh, Ryumin decided to only provide items for those he would bring along until round 20.

'For now, I'll only take care of Minjuri and Kristin. The rest... well, let's think about it later.'

Just when the mere thought of it made him sigh,

A call came from Magyeongrok.

"Yes, President."

Prophet, do you have a moment?

"Now?"

Yes. I have something for you.

"Something? What is it?"

I've been collecting items for you, Prophet.

"Items? Oh, are you telling me you looted items before killing the criminals?"

Yes, exactly. Killing them outright would be a waste, wouldn't it? The items, I mean.

It turned out Magyeongrok, who was doing the same thing as Ryumin, had collected a lot of usable items.

I've gathered quite a few things, so come and pick what you need.

"Oh, thank you. You could have kept it for yourself, but you left some for me..."

I receive information that can't be converted into money every time. There needs to be some goodwill exchange.

Magyeongrok spoke kindly, but Ryumin knew there was an underlying motive.

'He probably wants to keep me indebted, materialistically, so that I keep receiving information for the next rounds.'

It could be considered a form of bribery.

Anyway, it worked out well. They needed the materials to make unique items.

Considering the number of enemies Magyeongrok has killed so far, there should be enough materials.

"Where are you located? I'll head there right away."

Magyeongrok, who was waiting for Ryumin in the hotel room, sipped whiskey while enjoying the night view.

On the neatly arranged floor, numerous items looted over the past two weeks were spread out.

'If the prophet sees this, she might be pleasantly surprised. No, she might have seen it through her prophecy.'

Judging by her lack of surprise during the call, it's likely she already knew.
ChatGPT

"Does she know about this too? That I intend to give her all the items."

Though he said to come and choose over the phone, he was actually willing to give her everything. That way, he could continue to extract information for the next rounds.

"It's a kind of debt."

Magyeongrok chuckled, unaware that he was the one playing in Ryumin's hands.

Tock-

"Who is it?"

"It's me. President."

Magyeongrok went out to greet Ryumin with a welcoming smile upon hearing his voice.

"Welcome, Prophet. Calling to a hotel room at night. Someone might misunderstand."

"Haha, just a joke. Come this way."

As Magyeongrok turned around with a smile, Ryumin noticed a smirk on his lips.

"Now he even knows how to crack jokes. Has he grown up a lot?"

Externally, Magyeongrok might seem impressive, but Ryumin subtly saw him as approachable.

It wasn't that he didn't acknowledge Ryumin's combat abilities, except when it came to prophecies.

Didn't he admit not long ago that he couldn't beat Magyeongrok in a fight?

"By the way, how does a prophet fight? Do you just barely survive based on future information?"

It was a question he hadn't thought about until now.

"Prophet. A sudden thought came to me... How do you fight?"

"Oh, me?"

Reading his thoughts in advance, Ryumin answered cheerfully without any signs of embarrassment.

"It's a secret."

"A secret?"

"I should have at least one secret. If I spill all kinds of information, what will I have left to live on?"

"Oh, that makes sense. Haha."

Magyeongrok, who didn't expect him to respond, was surprised.

"Even if his combat skills aren't great, I shouldn't underestimate that cunning mindset of his."

Although he mentally said he should be cautious, Magyeongrok was quite open.

The fact that he allowed Ryumin into his space was evidence of that.

"Is it these items looted from the criminals?"

"Yes. Quite a few, actually."

Magyeongrok smiled slyly, unaware that Ryumin also had a significant collection of looted items.

"If there's anything you need among these, feel free to choose. I'll give you everything regardless of quantity."

"Haha, in that case..."
ChatGPT

Ryumin selected the items without hesitation, mostly consisting of unique materials.

"Hmm? What are you planning to do with those?"

"President Ma, as I mentioned before, when I see prophecies, I come across various pieces of information."

"Yes, but what does that have to do with..."

Instead of answering, Ryumin demonstrated with action. He opened the crafting window and placed the unique materials, with an expert-grade armor as the main ingredient. Upon pressing the combine button, there was a dazzling display of light as the materials disappeared, giving birth to a splendid item.

Magyeongrok's eyes widened. "Wha-what is this?"

"It's a gift."

Magyeongrok, after receiving the armor, was surprised when checking the options. "An Expert-grade with unique rating?"

Currently, the best equipment Magyeongrok had was just a regular-grade epic item purchased from the store. But now, before him, there was an item with options superior to that.

Magyeongrok's pupils darted around. "H-how did you make this?"

"I mentioned it a little while ago. I unintentionally come across various pieces of information."

"You saw the unique crafting method in the future?"

Nodding, Magyeongrok sighed in amazement. "I wondered if it was possible to know the crafting method as well..."

The value of the prophet rose another notch. Maintaining a close relationship with Ryumin was something he had to do no matter what, even if it meant using whatever means necessary.

"Um... Prophet. Are you really giving this to me?"

"Yes. Since President Ma gave me items with you in mind, I should repay accordingly. It also means you should quickly reach level 40 and wear it. And while making it, I also made one for your fianc√©e."

"Even for Kristin?"

"Please convey it directly to the President."

"Oh, thank you. Seriously."

Magyeongrok couldn't take his eyes off the unique armor. It truly pleased him.

"Can I take the remaining materials? I have a use for them."

"Of course. Feel free to take them all. If there's anything you don't need, leave it. I'll sell it on the market and send you the money."

"You don't have to go that far... Thank you."

Ryumin smiled, and Magyeongrok smiled back.

"Would you like a glass of whiskey?"
ChatGPT

"No, thank you. Alcohol doesn't suit my taste. I'll head home first."

"Oh, is that so?"

Magyeongrok displayed a disappointed expression.

"If you didn't bring your car, should I ask someone from management to see you off?"

"Thanks for the offer, but I did bring my car."

"I see. Then, until next time."

As Ryumin disappeared, Magyeongrok smacked his lips in regret. He almost had a drinking buddy, and it left him feeling a bit disappointed.

Using the materials received from Magyeongrok, Ryumin crafted unique items and went to find Minjuri.

"Take it."

"Huh? What's this?"

"I made it for you to wear."

When Minjuri glanced at Ryumin and saw the item's information, her pupils widened.

"This... it's unique?"

Ryumin explained it just as he had to Magyeongrok. Any excuse involving prophecy seemed to make everything okay.

"Getting such good items in the 9th round information..."

Minjuri, who seemed touched, suddenly lowered her head.

"I can't accept this. You should use it."

"I don't need it. I've already made mine."

"Still, I can't take it. I'm already indebted to you, receiving help every round, and now, I can't accept this with any dignity."

'I've received a lot of help too.'

Minjuri's buffs have been instrumental in Ryumin breaking records. He had more than recouped his initial investment.

However, he couldn't reveal this fact to Minjuri. How could he now say he was the Black Scythe?

"Still, take it."

"No, I can't. I can't accept it."

Seeing her firm attitude, Ryumin had to resort to a tough stance.

"Then let's do this. Consider this as a debt. Pay me back when you grow stronger. That way, it works out, right?"

"...."

It's not giving; it's lending. Saying that made Minjuri waver a bit.

"When you pay it back later, it'll be fine. To me, this item is currently useless."

"Fine... If you put it that way, I'll borrow it gratefully. But remember, the debt you have now will multiply several times when repaid later."

"Sure. Pay me back big when the time comes."

When Ryumin extended the item, Minjuri reluctantly accepted.

After distributing unique items to his colleagues, Ryumin returned home.

"Hyung, if you haven't had dinner yet, want to eat together?"

"You go ahead. I'll eat later."

"Huh?"

Ryumin, going into his room without having dinner, caught the curious gaze of his younger brother, Ryuwon.

"What's going on?"

Ryumin entered the room and lay down on the bed.

Now was not the time to leisurely eat a meal. He had important decisions to make regarding the future.

"The transition period for Flseva will end this month. Transforming into a group of ordinary players, not a criminal force."

However, the issue lay with public perception. How society viewed players was a ticking time bomb, and if not changed, it acted as an obstacle to fixing a society that was on the verge of ruin.

"I can't let that happen. My goal is to turn Black Scythe into a powerful figure as a national enemy."

However, the problem lay in the perception of society. The current perception of players by citizens was an unpredictable time bomb.

"If I can't change that, it becomes a hurdle to correcting the society that is going downhill."

However, his focus was on the change in societal perception.

"If I can't change that, it becomes a hurdle to correcting the society that is going downhill."

"Can't let that happen. My goal is to make Black Scythe a powerful figure as a national enemy."

In reality, the name value of Black Scythe was not as significant as one might think. Despite always ranking first, it was well-known among players, but to the general public, it was treated like a common occurrence.

"The name 'Black Scythe' needs to have influence in reality as well. That way, with just a word, I can gather and control players worldwide."

"The name 'Black Scythe' needs to have influence in reality as well. That way, with just a word, I can gather and control players worldwide."

To control the rampant players would make the world less disastrous. To achieve that, he needed formidable power not only in the other world but also in reality.

"I need formidable power not only in the other world but also in reality."

"The status of Black Scythe needs to be elevated to be on par with the president."

"The status of Black Scythe needs to be elevated to be on par with the president."

The name 'Black Scythe' needs to be influential in reality. Only then can he give commands to players worldwide and control them effectively.

"For that, I need the bill proposed by Seong Hyeong-hyeon, the National Assembly member."

To expedite the time to implement the law, he had to find a way.

"To expedite the time to implement the law, I have to find a way."

He got up from the bed, and with determination, he called someone.

"Yamdi, I have something to instruct."

"Please speak, Master."

To expedite the time, how could he accomplish that?

"Please speak, Master."

"I have someone to seduce. A powerful figure."

"If you dominate a high-ranking figure, like the Police Commissioner."
