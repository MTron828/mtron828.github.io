Title: Episode 196 - Beings Targeting the Black Scythe

The operation to assassinate the Black Scythe proceeded swiftly.

"Hello, my name is Jeffrey."

Jeffrey introduced himself in front of the five apostles.

"As a level 48 assassin, I can handle stalking or assassination, whatever you need. Just leave it to me."

"Have you heard about it from Swingman? What needs to be done?"

In response to Spaniard's question, Jeffrey nodded.

"I heard that I need to track down the location of the Korean CPF commander through stalking."

"Can you handle it?"

"It shouldn't be too difficult. I've already identified the police station where the commander frequently appears. All I have to do is stake it out. Of course, the sooner the payment is made, the sooner I can start stalking."

"Haha, alright. So, how much is the fee?"

"I'll take an upfront payment of 100,000 points, and upon completion, another 100,000 points, totaling 200,000 points."

"Hmm..."

Not dollars or gold, but points were offered as the transaction currency.

It wasn't surprising, as the trading function had already been experienced, but the amount was a problem.

"200,000 points. Isn't that too much?"

"It's not a big deal if we all chip in 20,000 points each as an upfront payment."

Everyone nodded as if they understood, except for one person who wore a suspicious expression.

It was John Delgado.

"You said your name is Jeffrey?"

"Yes."

"You're white, right? Which country are you from?"

"I'm from the United States."

"How did you, an American, find out about Swingman, an Indian player?"

"I don't discriminate when it comes to clients. I move only for money, regardless of nationality."

Although surprised by the sudden question, Jeffrey answered smoothly.

It was because Ryu Min had prepared the answer in advance.

"It seems like you've done contract work more than once or twice?"

"Yes. There are people looking for assassins everywhere, whether they are civilians or players."

"That person is so famous, why haven't I heard of him, being a fellow American?"

"Well, you can't openly reveal that you're in the contract business, can you?"

With those words, the conversation came to an end.

As there was nothing more to extract from Jeffrey, John's attention turned back to Ryu Min.

"Swingman, why did you hire an assassin?"

"I personally needed stalking at one point, so I've hired before. I got to know Jeffrey at that time. Is it okay now?"

When Ryu Min responded with a firm tone, John couldn't find any more points to argue.

Nothing substantial came up.

As the atmosphere became heavy, Spaniard clapped his hands to lighten the mood.

"Well, it seems like he has some experience with cool trades. Let's trust him and give him the task. Mr. Jeff? We'll trade, so please handle it quickly."

"Yes, worry not."

After receiving points from the apostles, Jeffrey laughed and disappeared.

Certainly, being an assassin, he used invisibility to explore the surroundings without being detected.

"Now, let's wait until that assassin brings good results."

"Agreed."

Everyone smiled with satisfaction, but John Delgado couldn't hide his uneasy expression.

Contact from Jeffrey came exactly a week before the next round.

"I'm here!"

"What do you mean? Did you find it?"

"Yes! After the stalking, I found the residence of the Black Scythe."

"That's great!"

The apostles burst into laughter at Swingman's report.

However, only John Delgado, who had dissatisfaction with Swingman, couldn't hide his uncertain expression.

"Is that information certain? Did you confirm if the Black Scythe is inside?"

"Of course. Here is the video sent by Jeffrey."

The video showed someone wearing a white mask leaving the villa.

"This person. If you look at the mask, it's undoubtedly the Black Scythe who attacked us back then."

"...."

Swingman was the only one who had seen the real Black Scythe.

Therefore, he couldn't blindly deny it.

It was a role he couldn't affirm either.

"Is this person definitely the Black Scythe?"
ChatGPT

"Yes. Absolutely! I can even stake my own life."

When Swingman stated it so emphatically, the other apostles had no choice but to acknowledge it.

"Hehe, we finally found the residence of the Black Scythe."

"Now, all that's left is to assassinate according to the plan."

"Leave it to me. I'll open the lid of the Black Scythe with my inspired sniping skills."

While Dark Soul confidently spoke, Yancoven, who had been silent, wasn't pleased.

"Why is this guy interfering? We agreed to follow the plan I suggested! Wait until we enter the 12th round!"

"I already found the house. Why wait? If we snipe him right away, it'll be over."

"Hey, thoughtless fool. What if the snipe fails? The Black Scythe will move his residence, and then my carefully prepared plan might be in vain."

"That's right. Dark Soul, it might be better to follow Yancoven's plan as scheduled. Just wait for a week, okay?"

With Spaniard joining in, Dark Soul had no choice but to reluctantly withdraw, seeming disappointed.

"Then as planned, I'll prepare the Black Scythe's minions who will pull the strings."

"Yes. Yancoven, on December 1st, as soon as it turns midnight, please infiltrate the organization members into Korea so that we can surprise attack."

"Leave it to me."

Although the apostles smiled with sinister satisfaction, they were unaware.

The failure of the plan was already an inevitable fact.

That the Black Scythe's residence was a trap prepared by Ryu Min from the beginning.

There were no angels in Heaven who didn't know that the rulers of the celestial realm were the seven Archangels.

Even the recent reduction to six after Remyel's death was widely known.

However, no angel, other than the Archangels in leadership roles, knew how Remyel died or who killed him.

Not even those in high-ranking positions.

"It's a big problem, a big problem." "Indeed, it is."

The Archangels gathered together, a rare occurrence.

They used to gather like this whenever there was a significant event, but lately, it had been nonexistent.

Until Remyel's death.
ChatGPT

[For hundreds of years, the seven Archangels maintained their position, but now they have decreased to six. This is an unprecedented and significant matter.] [I agree. The once strong reputation of the Archangels is falling to the ground. We need to come up with a solution.]

Gabriel, ranked second, and Uriel, ranked fourth, raised their voices.

Michael, who held the top rank, and had been silent, asked for the opinions of the Archangels.

[What do you suggest we do?] [We must catch and kill the damn bug that killed Raphael!] [Drag him to Heaven and strip his skin in front of everyone to see while he's still alive!]

The opinions of the Archangels were generally similar.

They all agreed that after subduing the Black Scythe, suitable punishment should be dealt in Heaven.

'This is problematic.'

Bringing a player currently participating in the round to Heaven would immediately disqualify their eligibility.

Becoming an outsider, they wouldn't be included in the participants, nor would they be summoned in the next round.

They wouldn't even be able to return to Earth.

They would become an existence completely unrelated to the survival game, but the Archangels didn't mind.

For them, it was only important to bring the sinner and punish them.

However, Michael had a different perspective.

'For me to become a god, I have to lead the Black Scythe to victory in this game.'

In other words, it meant he had to ensure that the Black Scythe safely reached the 20th round.

But given the fierce current atmosphere, it was doubtful if that could be achieved.

Especially for Raguel, ranked fifth.

[Michael, give me a chance. I will bring that human scum called the Black Scythe for a proper judgment.]

As an Archangel of justice, fairness, and harmony, Raguel couldn't stand idly by in the face of injustice.

'Probably tear him to pieces to the point where he barely breathes, then bring him to Heaven for all sorts of torture.'

It was so obvious that Raguel couldn't be sent.

Better if he took matters into his own hands.

'No, if I step forward and come back with no gain? Won't the arrows of blame be directed at me?'

Ultimately, to quell the flames, someone had to be sent.

Of course, it had to be a relatively weak Archangel, one that the Black Scythe could potentially defeat.

'Who would be the best to send?'

As Michael pondered, his eyes caught the only silent Archangel.

Ranked sixth, Sariel, the Archangel of Death.
ChatGPT

'If we were to send someone, Sariel, who holds the lowest rank among us, would be suitable...'

The problem is that Sariel is essentially a counterpart or counterpart-like existence to a reaper.

'The darkness of a player's shadow, which is just a mere occupation, cannot compare to the darkness of the Archangel of Death, which can be considered death itself.'

Can the shadow attribute of a player, who is just a mere profession, stand up to the darkness of the Archangel of Death, which can be considered death itself?

'Perhaps they'll just surrender without doing anything.'

But even so, they can't send Raguel, who is ranked above Sariel.

If she's already prepared for a confrontation, she would use all her power to face the Black Scythe upon seeing him.

'If Raguel uses all her power, even the Black Scythe may not withstand it.'

Although they wanted to send an Archangel strong enough to face the Black Scythe, there wasn't any particular Archangel suitable for the task.

Whether ranked 5th or 6th, they were formidable beings to face the Black Scythe.

Not to mention those above them.

'But suggesting to send 1st class angels would likely face resistance, wouldn't it?'

Given that they already killed the 7th-ranked Remyel, it was already being said that they were beyond human level.

If they were to send lower-ranked 1st class angels, the objections would likely be loud.

'Hmm, who should we send to ensure the Black Scythe's safety...'

It might sound absurd to anyone listening, but without knowing that, the Archangels engaged in heated debates.

[We must capture that human right away! We should open a dimensional portal and descend to Earth even if it's forced!] [Opening a dimensional portal forcibly before the round even begins requires a significant cost. Is there a need to rush like that?] [So, Gabriel, are you suggesting we leave that pest as it is?] [Just endure until the 12th round, Raguel. Even though I know your feelings, isn't it better to find reason and evaluate gains and losses, especially in times like this?] [Then send me at the start of the 12th round! I will capture that human and restore the dignity lost by the Archangel who lost him!] [No.]

In the midst of the conversation, Michael intervened.

The decision of who to send had been made between the two.
ChatGPT

[We will send Sariel to bring the Black Scythe.] [Michael, why!?] [You seem to have lost your reason right now. Isn't Sariel, who can handle the sinner with ease, more suitable for the job?] [I can do it well too! With the Judgment Sword, I can deal with that pest that disrupts the order of Heaven...] [Look at who is the excited angel shouting right now.] [....] [My opinion remains unchanged. When it comes to bringing the Black Scythe, Sariel is the right person for the job. There's no need for the 5th rank to step up just to catch a mere bug.] [Hmm... That's also a valid point.]

If the top rank's decision is so, it must be followed.

Of course, Michael's decision was made after weighing who was weaker between the two.

'If I have to send someone, the 6th rank would be relatively easier to deal with.'

Even though he was considered a reaper's counterpart, he might at least have a chance to escape.

[Sariel, can you do it?] [Of course. Michael, catching a single human is not that difficult.] [Then it's settled. When the 12th round comes, Sariel, secretly bring that human called the Black Scythe from the otherworld. He must face judgment in Heaven, so absolutely do not kill him.] [As long as I don't kill him, right?] [It would be better to bring him in a clean state if possible. It won't be easy, though.]

Perhaps provoked by the last words?

Sariel's eyebrows, as long as feathers, quivered.

[I will bring him in without a single scratch.]

Seeing Sariel speak while sharpening his scythe, Michael felt somehow uneasy.

'This is not how it was supposed to be...'

He didn't know that the words intended to help the Black Scythe would inadvertently kindle a flame.
