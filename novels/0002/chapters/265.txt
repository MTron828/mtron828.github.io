Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 265"

Please Explain in Detail.

Commander.

It's a useful temporary skill in Round 17.

"If it were someone else, they might hesitate at 500 million gold for the second option, but I have no reason to do so."

A little while ago, I defeated the first-class angels and surpassed 7 billion gold.

Now, the concern is when to spend all this gold.

"Therefore, my choice is option 1, Commander."

After choosing the temporary skill, a termination message appeared shortly afterward.

◀ ROUND 16 Ends ▶

[Unified Area CA-EA001]

└ Survivors: 288

[Round 17 will begin on May 1, 2023, at midnight. Congratulations on surviving. See you in the next round.]

Michael walked through the hall with a serious expression.

All because of the call of the vengeful goddess Nemesis.

"Darn it. Even Gabriel and Raphael are dead."

Originally, he should welcome their deaths since the Black Scythe didn't die, but...

"If it continues like this, I'll be the only one left."

The fact that there is no Archangel left to step forward made Michael uneasy.

Creak, thud -

As he entered the hall, the goddess Nemesis, with her purple skin, gave him a fleeting glance.

[Did you call for me, Lady Nemesis.] [Michael. Have you heard the news?] [Yes. Even Gabriel and Raphael have fallen unexpectedly.] [Getting worked up over just one human.]

There was no anger on Nemesis' face as she spoke.

Just a pitiful gaze looking down.

[... I apologize.] [Now there is no honor left in Heaven. Time and opportunity are running out.]

Nemesis, who sighed, spoke with a sharp look in her eyes.

[Archangel Michael. It's your turn to step forward now. There's no one else but you.] [... .] [When Round 17 comes, go down to the human realm and subdue the Black Scythe. This is the only opportunity. Before Round 18, you must pass the Black Scythe to Phlegethos.]

Despite wanting to refuse and make excuses, Michael spoke.

[Understood. I will do as instructed.]
ChatGPT

Michael had no choice but to respond in agreement.

There was no longer any excuse to give.

Minjuri, returning home, felt an unusual mood.

Usually, when returning from another world, she tends to stare at the ceiling of her bed, but not this round. It's different when you take a plane back home.

"I'm back."

"Our daughter! You've returned safely this time too!"

Was it because she had been abroad? Although her father welcomed her more than usual, Minjuri couldn't smile genuinely.

"Why is your expression like that? Is something wrong?"

"Just... I'm feeling a bit off."

"Why? What happened? Tell your dad."

After hesitating, Minjuri cautiously opened up.

"It's glad to have survived, but seeing the comrades I fought alongside disappear right in front of my eyes, it wasn't entirely enjoyable."

Just a few hours ago, players who had fought together as a team against monsters were annihilated with a word from the Black Scythe.

"It's not the fault of the Black Scythe. It was inevitable."

But witnessing the annihilation up close was truly bitter.

"I've seen the annihilation several times before and felt some sympathy, but... this time it felt different."

"How was it different?"

"It felt guilty to survive... I felt sorry for the ones who died for no reason."

It couldn't be helped.

It wasn't survival based on her usual efforts, but rather being chosen to survive by the Black Scythe.

Seeing his melancholic daughter, Mindohoon didn't know what to say.

"Go into your room and take a rest. It will get better."

"Yes..."

Thunk -

Minjuri closed the door, changed her clothes, and lay down on the bed.

After staring at the ceiling for a while, Minjuri touched her chest.

The area around where her heart had been pierced was cleanly restored.

No pain at all.

Being dead and alive again felt like a dream.

"If it weren't for the Black Scythe, by now..."

No matter how much she thought about it, meeting the Black Scythe was fortunate.

At that moment, she recalled herself being embraced by the Black Scythe.

In embarrassment, she covered her face with the blanket.
ChatGPT

'I must be crazy. What am I thinking right now...'

The Black Scythe is nothing more than a noble benefactor and savior of life who has provided immense help to Minjuri. He is by no means a subject for personal emotions.

'The Black Scythe is a god. A deity of the Church of Death. I must think of him that way.'

As Minjuri uncovered herself from the blanket, cooling her flushed cheeks, she soon shifted her focus to another thought.

'By the way, what happened to Min?'

When the Black Scythe was ranking players up to 288th place, Minjuri concentrated her hearing nerves, fully prepared to hear Ryu Min's nickname.

'But I didn't hear the nickname Lost Yak.'

What could have happened?

Why didn't the Black Scythe summon the prophet?

With a worried heart, as soon as the round ended, Minjuri searched for Ryu Min's name on the island.

But the result was inconclusive.

The message displayed was absurd, stating that the name and face did not match.

'What about now?'

Out of curiosity, Minjuri searched for Ryu Min once again.

Then.

'Huh?'

[The face and name match. Tracking the target.] [The location of the target 'Ryu Min' has been identified.] [The target is currently 16,488 meters away.] [To track the target, follow the arrow in front of you.]

Tracking seemed to be working normally.

'What happened?'

It showed as a mismatch on the island, and now it's a match again?

'Then surviving Round 16 means...?'

Yet, the Black Scythe didn't mention the nickname.

She sobered up and realized.

'Something is definitely strange.'

She needed to ask Ryu Min directly for details.

With that thought, she sent a message proposing to meet, and shortly afterward, a reply came.

[Ryu Min: It's a bit inconvenient now. Let's meet later.] [Minjuri: Why? What's going on?] [Ryu Min: My house got wrecked, and I'm busy dealing with things.] [Minjuri: What? How did that happen?] [Ryu Min: I don't even know the details myself ㅠㅠ]

Suddenly, Ryu Min's house got wrecked? Worried, Minjuri called her.

"Minah. Can we talk for a moment?"

Sure.

"What happened? I heard your house got destroyed?"

I don't know. There's no footage on CCTV, so...
ChatGPT

"Is your younger sibling okay?"

Safe. Fortunately, they are staying over at a friend's house.

"That's really fortunate."

By the way, did you have something to talk about? Is it urgent?

"Huh? No, it's nothing. We can talk later. Let's meet up instead."

Sure? Then let's meet once everything is sorted out here.

"Got it. By the way, with your house in that state, what will you do? Do you have a place to stay right now?"

Actually, I'm looking into a decent hotel at the moment. I'll stay there while the house is being repaired.

"Alright then. Once you decide on a place to stay and things are somewhat settled, let me know the address. I'll come visit."

Okay.

"See you next time."

After ending the call, Minjuri still had a worried expression.

'What could be happening?'

She wasn't entirely sure, but she couldn't immediately satisfy her curiosity.

Minjuri reluctantly had to keep the questions within herself.

└Content: It seems like a news article, but I can't find it. Please reply in the comments.

[Total comments: 12]

└I don't know either. Someone else, please reply.

└Here's the link: http://news.nover.com//20220426<—It's the article. In summary, for Round 16, monsters were created where players were located, but the Black Scythe moved the players to the island in advance, reducing civilian casualties.

└Strictly speaking, there was no damage. Since there were no civilian casualties.

└So, if it were a city instead of an island, monsters would have appeared in the city?

└Yeah, that's the idea.

└Wow, if monsters had appeared in the city, it would have been a disaster, right?

└According to our son, who is in the Church of Death, he said even angels appeared, but the monsters they faced so far were incomparably stronger.

└Dang, if even one of those creatures had crawled into the city, it would have been a complete disaster.

└It was a smart move to have moved to the island in advance.

└But how did they know that monsters would appear? And how did they end up on the island beforehand?

└The Black Scythe reportedly saw the future as a reward for being ranked first. Every round, he can survive by providing strategies, so they say.

└Lucky for those who joined the Church of Death, it seems.

'Well, luck or not.'

As Heo Taeseok read through the community post, the corners of his mouth naturally lifted. It was a post praising the Church of Death, so that reaction was expected.

"Every time I see a post like this, it makes me proud as the leader."

With the reason for his escape to the island now known, the reputation of the Church of Death had soared even higher. The Black Scythe's stature among players was, of course, undeniable.

However, Heo Taeseok once again wore a slightly downcast expression, as if asking when it had ever been different.

"I couldn't make it within the top 3 this time either."

Once again, because he didn't receive the summons from the Black Scythe. Or, to be precise, he did receive the summons, just not within the top 3.

"The problem is that my ranking dropped even further than before."

Previously, he was ranked 10th, but this time, he was labeled as 13th. Although the Black Scythe called it out somewhat arbitrarily, Heo Taeseok didn't accept it so casually.

"It probably means I've been underperforming."

Heo Taeseok, who saw the rank given by the Black Scythe as a subconscious indication of connections, was genuinely feeling disheartened. It was a trivial matter that shouldn't have caused such distress.

"I need to be of help to the Black Scythe. I have to show not only to the Black Scythe but also to the believers that I'm not just a boastful leader."

It was a kind of sense of responsibility. If you were in the position of a leader, shouldn't you be superior in some way compared to other believers?

"What should I do to receive praise from the Black Scythe...?"

He pondered deeply on what could be done to benefit the Church of Death, but nothing specific came to mind. Maintaining the current situation and managing the believers to prevent them from going astray seemed to be the best course.

"If I continue like this, I might be forgotten by the Black Scythe..."

During that worrisome moment, Eom Junseok entered the room with a smart knock.

"Leader."

"What's the matter, Eom Chugyung?"

"One of the believers requests an audience with the leader. He has something to report..."

"A report?"

Heo Taeseok, with widened eyes, granted permission.

"Tell them to come in."

Soon after, a foreigner entered the room.

"Hello, Leader."

Interpreting between the two, Eom Junseok facilitated the conversation.

"Who is this?"

"He is Philip Robertson from Scotland. His nickname is Cobalt Blue."
ChatGPT

"Oh, I see. You mentioned you have something to report to me?"

"Yes."

Cobalt Blue, who had been nervously biting his lips for a moment, spoke up.

"The current atmosphere among the believers is not right."

"What do you mean? Explain."

"It seems like someone is forming factions."

"Factions?"

Heo Taeseok's eyes, initially widened in surprise, narrowed sharply.

"Tell me more."
