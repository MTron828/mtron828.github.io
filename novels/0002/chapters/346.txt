Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 346"

The Full Story of the Incident (Part 1)

Players, as if possessed, reached out to the wishing stones.

At that moment, chaos erupted, but that was all.

There was no way to stop the touch of 97 hands.

[Player 'Black Scythe' enters the Room of Wishes.]

Grasping the radiant gem, Black Scythe and the other 97 players, each with their own time, entered.

A white space with nothing.

But it was the second time seeing such a space.

Here, Ryu Min was savoring triumph alone.

"I did it. I saved my comrades from chaos."

Minjuri, Seo Arin, Christine, Victor, Sophia, Jeffrey, Russell, Ahn Sang-cheol, Ma Kyung-rok, Eom Jun-seok, Heo Tae-seok, Jo Yong-ho, Yum-ti, Ju Sung-tak, John Delgado, Alex, Dorothy, and others, excluding himself, touched the wishing stones.

After engaging in individual struggles in the Room of Wishes, they would speak their wishes.

"May everyone achieve what they desire."

Ryu Min also fulfilled his wish.

Through the 101st regression, saving his comrades was his wish.

"Despite the interference of chaos, everyone touched the wishing stones."

Ryu Min's wish came true.

But it was still just a partial wish.

The true wish was to annihilate chaos, the organizer of this damn game.

"It's not over until we kill chaos."

He might once again use human lives as collateral for the game.

Surviving the imminent crisis doesn't mean everything is fine.

Especially if it's the chaos he knows.

"Hello. Welcome to the Room of Wishes. If you have any questions, feel free to ask."

In response to the system's voice, Ryu Min immediately replied.

"I want to know my contribution."

"Black Scythe's contribution to victory is 264,452,952 points."

It was only 26 billion this time, compared to 38 billion last time.

While he was busy dealing with chaos, other players must have divided the contributions.

"The 102nd regression is a lost cause."
ChatGPT

Even though there was no reason to regress further after achieving the goal...

"Well, it can't be helped. As promised, I'll fulfill that wish."

Before making his wish, Ryu Min asked about things he had been curious about.

"What happens to me when I leave the Room of Wishes?"

[All player functions, levels, stats, skills, and abilities will be lost.]

"Does that mean I return from a deity to a regular person?"

[No. Once you become a deity, it is impossible to go back. Only items, levels, skills, abilities, runes, stats obtained as an avatar will be reset. Titles and Eternal items bound to the soul will remain.]

"The title was bound to the soul?"

[Yes.]

This was new information for him.

"So, I only lose levels, stats, runes, items, and skills, right?"

Only titles and Eternal items would be retained.

But even with that, Ryu Min could belong to the realm of ordinary people.

"To keep levels, stats, runes, items, etc., how much contribution is needed?"

[To maintain all of Black Scythe's abilities, 2,139,201,921 contributions are required.]

"21 billion? Maintaining this state is almost impossible."

In the end, would he have to wish for what he promised to Lubahe?

Ryu Min made his wish.

The alternative wish that he had already considered.

"Let me meet Gaia."

[Meeting Gaia will require the consumption of all contributions. Will you proceed?]

Ryu Min nodded.

"Yes."

Regrettable, but there was no other choice.

To kill chaos, he had no choice but to seek Gaia's help.

[As per your wish, we will connect you with Gaia.]

A bright light enveloped his retina.

"Where is this?"

It was a white space until a while ago, but now he found himself in a black space.

It felt like floating in the universe.

"Akashic Records had a similar environment."

As he looked around, a familiar entity revealed itself.

[Welcome, Black Scythe.]

"Lubahe."

Smiling with a familiar face, Lubahe greeted him.

"You've worked hard to come this far. You've done well according to the plan."
ChatGPT

"It would have been better if Chaos didn't show up."

"Well, it can't be helped. After all, having a contingency plan is essential."

"Yeah."

Originally, Ryu Min and Lubahe's plan was to secretly grow stronger under the radar of Chaos. To kill Chaos, they needed to complete the Second Deification and gather 100 billion Terra. However, the chances of failure were high if they encountered interference along the way.

"I tried to be as careful as possible to complete the Second Deification while avoiding the eyes of Chaos, but..."

Even for an exceptional assassin, secretly killing seven Archangels and four deities was no easy task. Eventually, being exposed to Chaos was only a matter of time.

"So, an alternative plan was needed, considering the possibility of my presence being discovered."

That alternative plan was reaching the wishing stones and meeting Gaia.

Since Gaia had another way to annihilate Chaos.

"Of course, I could have met Gaia before regressing."

However, Ryu Min decided to regress to the 101st time after his conversation with Lubahe. He couldn't ignore the comrades who died because of Chaos.

"As you wished, you saved your comrades and completed the Second Deification to meet Gaia. Truly remarkable."

"Enough of the useless talk. Where is Gaia?"

"She is waiting, as always."

For a moment, Lubahe's eyebrows twitched, but Ryu Min paid no attention.

Pa-ah-

With radiance pushing away darkness, a middle-aged woman appeared.

"Is she Chaos's wife and the creator goddess, Gaia?"

Unlike the giant Chaos, the woman's stature was not particularly large, almost human-sized, with a gentle demeanor that could seem ordinary at first glance. However, the creative power she possessed within made her seem gigantic even to Ryu Min, who couldn't fathom its magnitude.

"Are you Gaia?"

"Yes. Player 'Black Scythe.' I am Gaia, often referred to as the Mother of Earth."

"Is this your true form?"

"No. I simply manifested a form that is comfortable for humans to see. I don't have a substantial form. The same goes for Chaos."

"So, it's just a user-friendly representation, is it?"
ChatGPT

"Yes. But it's not an illusion; the primordial force that actually exists is me and Chaos."

Ryu Min stared at her intently, as if trying to read Gaia's thoughts. However, neither Chaos nor Gaia could be read.

"Right, I don't have the Rune of Insight anymore, do I?"

Everything he had collected, from stats to runes and God-grade items, was gone. Fortunately, he still had titles and Eternal items, so he considered himself unlucky but fortunate in that regard.

"But not being able to see information is the same."

Even the Eye of Insight didn't provide any significant information about Gaia.

"I can sense that you're wary of me from your gaze."

"...."

"Didn't we agree to only speak the truth in the contract? Why are you so guarded?"

"I think you know why."

"You dislike me."

"...."

Ryu Min chose not to respond.

Gaia, with a sly smile, nodded as if understanding.

"I understand. Many humans have died because of the system I created."

"It's not just our Earth. Humans from other dimensions have perished due to that damn war, all for the sake of participating as mercenaries in the gods' foolish bets."

"That part is regrettable. However, I can clearly state that it was not my intention. It was all part of Chaos's plan."

"The idea of using humans as mercenaries originated from Chaos? You just created the system, right?"

"Exactly."

Ryu Min looked at Gaia, who was silently smiling. Judging by the fact that he didn't vanish according to the contract, it seemed she was telling the truth.

"Even so, the fact remains that you collaborated with Chaos."

"I regret that part. I didn't want to harm humans either. Where in the world would parents want to kill their own children? All creatures I created are like my own offspring."

"...."

"Moreover, I only possess the power of creation; my body doesn't have the authority to kill living beings. The power of destruction belongs to Chaos."

Gaia has the power of creation, and Chaos has the power of destruction? And they are a married couple?

"The strongest couple indeed."

Gaia smiled again.

"You just thought of us as the strongest couple, didn't you?"
ChatGPT

"...."

[Judging by your expression, it seems I hit the mark. Unfortunately, our relationship isn't that great. Can you imagine having a husband who is the one destroying creations?]

Gaia's words indicated a stark contrast between them.

'Or is it just Gaia stressed in this relationship? Since Chaos only engages in destruction.'

Ryu Min vaguely understood why Gaia disliked Chaos.

"So, were you planning to use me to kill Chaos, your husband, because you can't stand the sight of him?"

[That's not entirely without reason. But there is a deeper motive.]

"A deeper motive?"

[To explain it, it would take quite a long time. Are you okay with that?]

Ryu Min nodded.

Time was what he had. And, perhaps, knowing the reason would help him decide whether to trust Gaia or not.

"Go ahead, let me hear it."

Between Chaos and Gaia, there was one son.

The God of Time, Chronos.

Possessing a formidable power to manipulate time freely, he grew to the point where even his parents feared him.

Was it because they were afraid he would threaten their positions?

Realizing how dangerous it was to manipulate time, Chaos eventually decided to kill Chronos.

However, Gaia, who noticed this, couldn't stay silent.

To save her son, she sent him to a distant dimension.

"[Where the hell is that damn Chronos!] [I don't know.] [Are you going to keep playing dumb? That kid is a threat just by existing. We need to kill him immediately!] [Where in the world would parents want to kill their own child?] [You're not getting it, huh? Fine. Watch and see. I'll find him and kill him for sure.]

Gaia desperately tried to protect Chronos, while Chaos, with fiery eyes, sought to find and kill his own child.

The serious conflict between the couple began at this point.

Alone, Chronos eluded capture, slipping through the cracks of dimensions.

Sometimes, he turned back time to overcome crises.

"Phew, that was close."

Chaos's subordinates, including Nyx, were hell-bent on capturing him.
ChatGPT

Chronos, who had been living in hiding by cleverly slipping through the cracks of dimensions and time, couldn't help but feel enraged.

"I can't continue hiding like this. If I want to gain freedom, I must kill Chaos, the creator who is more like a father."

However, he only possessed the ability to manipulate time, and he couldn't stand against Chaos, who had the power of destruction.

"Someday, I will kill him. Someday..."

Sharpening the blades of revenge he would use one day, Chronos continued his life in hiding.

A long time passed.

Time changed everything.

Flowers, trees, living beings—everything died and disappeared.

Each time this happened, Gaia, with her power of creation, gave birth to new life.

While she created and nurtured new life, Chaos indulged in destruction.

It could be seen as a difference in nature, but alternatively, it was a situation where only Gaia was stressed.

However, Chaos wasn't without stress either.

"Chronos. I need to find and kill that damn son quickly..."

Despite releasing his subordinates to find him, they had been unsuccessful so far.

There were no traces to be found; he had disappeared completely.

"Damn, it feels like an eternity. My power is gradually diminishing."

As time passed, Chaos's power weakened.

On the other hand, Gaia's power grew stronger with the birth of new life.

The reason why Chaos desperately sought to destroy life was evident here.

As the primordial god, he couldn't afford to be surpassed by Chronos and Gaia.

"I can't let this continue. I need to regain my strength."

Chaos was the god of destruction, but his essence was that of the god of chaos.

His power increased as living beings experienced confusion.

"What should I do? How can I create chaos among the creatures?"

As Chaos pondered on ways to regain his strength, an idea formed in his mind.

"Hehe, yes, that should work."

The method he came up with was simple: manipulate angels and demons into periodic conflicts.

"Then there will be chaos between the two races."

This marked the beginning of the Celestial-Demonic War.
