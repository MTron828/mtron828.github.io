Title: "Level 100 Player's 320th Regression - Episode 320"

Boss Room

The final 72 members descended the underground stairs with tense faces.

Thud-

As they stepped onto the long corridor after the last staircase, sighs escaped from everyone's mouths.

"Wow..."

"It's incredibly spacious..."

Before them was a massive hall reminiscent of a dome, and in that hall, a 30m-sized statue filled the space leading to the boss room.

Guardian golems stood guarding the entrance to the boss room.

'Just like I saw before.'

Swords, spears, bows, axes, maces, wands, and more.

Angelic golems equipped with all sorts of weapons, a total of 100 of them, stood in formation.

It was enough to intimidate even an ordinary person just by looking at them.

However,

"Do we have to face all of them?"

"They're incredibly huge."

"And there are so many..."

The players watching couldn't help but murmur with uncertain voices.

Perhaps the guardian golems would react to any noise, but there was no need to worry.

'As long as we don't enter a certain range, they won't activate.'

While others were worried, Ryumin's expression remained calm.

He had a record of breaking through them in a previous episode.

Moreover, he did it alone.

'I've become much stronger than back then. If I'm afraid of those guys now, it's a disgrace.'

Moving forward confidently without looking back, Ryumin spoke.

"Don't step forward. I'll handle this."

With each step, he approached a certain range.

Ziiing-

The guardians, who had been as still as statues, began to react with gleaming eyes.

Thud- Thud- Thud-

The guardian at the forefront approached and swung a sword as big as a house.

Whoooosh- Clang- Clang- Clang!

The spot where the sword clashed shattered into pieces, but Ryumin wasn't there.

While the guardian foolishly looked around,

"Here."

Suddenly, Ryumin, who had ascended vertically to the top, descended with a scythe in hand.

Squelch!

Silently landing on the ground, he retrieved the scythe—

Swoosh-

The guardian was split into two.
ChatGPT

[Experience +1,000,000] [The acquired experience has exceeded 100,000.] [Experience will be converted to 10 stat points.] [Current kill count: 1/100] [Due to the Slaughter Rune effect, all stats increase by 1%.]

"Experience 1 million?"

Ryumin was pleasantly surprised by the unexpected figure.

Considering that an ogre yields around 20,000, this is an enormous amount.

"In the previous episode, due to the nature of the rounds, we couldn't know how much experience we gained. However..."

Now, with the transcendent rune, anyone could extract experience.

And the result was an astonishing 1 million.

"Could it be that they weren't created to be hunted but rather to be avoided?"

After all, individually, each one is the size of an apartment, and their numbers make it impractical for an ordinary player to defeat them.

But for Ryumin, it was easy to take them down.

"I ended up defeating the ones I shouldn't have. Well, it doesn't matter. No matter how strong the enemy is, they will be a hindrance..."

Ryumin's body soared upwards.

A moment later, an arrow lodged itself in the spot where he had stood.

"I'll just kill them all."

Ryumin's scythe, adorned with the branches of the Blaze Tree, swung like a whip.

[Level Up!] [Level Up!] [Level Up!]

..............

..............

Each kill of 1 million experience rapidly increased Ryumin's level.

It rose almost with each kill of 6, and the required number of kills continued to increase, but...

"The important thing is that the higher the level, the stronger you become."

[Achieved Level 100!] [From now on, the amount of stats gained per level up will increase to 3!]

..............

..............

[Achieved Level 110!] [From now on, the amount of stats gained per level up will increase to 4!]

..............

..............

[Current kill count: 100/100] [Due to the Slaughter Rune effect, all stats increase by 100%.]

"It seems that the amount of stats increases with every 10-level increment."

While raising from level 99 to 110, Ryumin obtained 32 stat points.

Originally, only 22 stats should have increased, but there was a slight increase.

"As I level up in the future, the increasing stats per level will continue to grow."

It might not be as good as cursing demons and hunting angels, but it's still a good thing, isn't it?

"Everyone, come this way. It's safe now."
ChatGPT

"……."

Despite Ryumin's call, the people were staring at the chaotic hall without moving a muscle.

He had single-handedly destroyed the 100 guardian golems that looked formidable.

It was a scene reminiscent of one person bringing down dozens of buildings.

"Why are you just standing there when I call you?"

"Oh, right!"

Without a single hesitation, people safely crossed over to where Ryumin was.

"Now, shall we go check what the guardian golems were guarding?"

At the spot blocked by the guardian golems, there was a single door.

As they entered, people followed with tense expressions.

"What's this place?"

"It looks like a temple or something."

A grand space opened up, and at the end, there was another door – the entrance to the boss room.

"Is there a door on that altar?"

"Should we go up there to check?"

"Be careful. Something might pop out."

While others were concerned, Ryumin was as nonchalant as ever.

He knew there were no traps.

"Well, strictly speaking, there is one – a trap that hits you hard on the back of your head."

When he stood on the altar, and they heard that at least five players were needed, how absurd was that?

Now, having filled the entry condition and with some remaining, he felt at ease. But back then, it was frustrating, and he couldn't sleep for a while.

"It feels refreshing. To think that I've stepped on this place with so many comrades."

Immersed in emotion, Ryumin suddenly turned his head and saw people looking at him with puzzled expressions.

"Why are you like that? Black Scythe Lord?"

"Why would I be like that? Are we not going in together?"

"Oh…"

"We have to go in."

As people approached, Ryumin smiled and took a step forward.

While doing so, he pointed to the magic circle drawn on the altar.

"Stand up there."

Although the magic circle was narrow for everyone to stand, Ryumin knew they didn't all need to.

[To open the boss room, a minimum of five players is required.] [It has been confirmed that 72 players have approached the boss room.] [Entry conditions have been met.] [The boss room is now opening.]

"The boss room?"
ChatGPT

"Was this the boss room?"

While people were bewildered, light seeped from the magic circle on the floor.

Grrrrr-

Finally, as the temple's door opened, Ryumin breathed a sigh of relief.

He had secretly worried that he might get hit on the back of his head again.

As the door fully opened, a dimly lit interior was revealed.

"This is the boss room."

From here on, it was an area even Ryumin hadn't explored.

Perhaps because of that, he couldn't help but feel a bit tense.

"Let's go in."

The 72 players entered the boss room.

Inside, a vast hall capable of accommodating a thousand people became visible in the darkness.

"Stay alert; something might come out."

As Ryumin spoke, people nodded, and at that moment when they were on guard,

Grrrrr- Thud!

The door that had opened rapidly closed, and pitch-black darkness devoid of any light descended.

"Whoa, what's happening?"

"Are we trapped?"

"I can't see anything!"

"Quick, light a fire!"

Feeling unease, people used magic to illuminate the surroundings.

Still, there was nothing in the hall, and the boss had not yet appeared.

"Counting heads, it seems everyone's here... Could it be that they've trapped us, so we can't get out?"

To check if they could leave, Ryumin tried pushing the door with a strength stat exceeding 900 million.

"Oh, it won't open? Black Scythe Lord?"

"Yeah, completely trapped."

With no way out.

Then, flames lit up in the dark hall.

Whoosh- Whoosh- Whoosh- Whoosh-

Fire sequentially entered hundreds of torches attached to the walls.

As all the flames lit up, the hall frighteningly brightened, and a message appeared.

[Round 20 Quest is revealed.]

◀ ROUND 20 ▶

└Defeat the boss in the boss room within 3 hours.

[You cannot leave before defeating the boss.] [The round will end immediately upon defeating the boss.] [Time remaining until round end: 02:19:57]

As expected, a quest to defeat the boss appeared.

"I had a feeling there was a time limit."

Still, everything went as expected, which was fortunate.

Now, they had to see which boss would emerge.
ChatGPT

"At least, something stronger than the guardian golems outside the door will likely appear."

Since they didn't know what would come out, neither Ryumin nor the people let their guard down.

"Everyone, be prepared for the boss as planned...."

Suddenly, a flash of light emanated from the central hall.

"Kraaaah!"

Cutting off Ryumin's words, a red dragon appeared, blood-red like a feature.

The Eternal item 'Eye of Insight' pierced through the essence of the opponent.

[Karmugus]

└ Race: Dragon

└ Nature: Evil

└ Position: Boss Monster

└ Noteworthy: Known as the most ferocious red dragon among all dragons. No match as the Round 20 boss.

└ Weakness: Eyes, under the jaw, between the scales.

"A dragon, huh."

Disappointment flashed in Ryumin's eyes.

He expected a more formidable boss, but a dragon appeared.

"Well, it's the first time facing a Red Dragon, at least."

Even though he had already defeated the Black Dragon Carsainox, this one might be on a different level.

After all, it was still a boss.

True to its name, it exuded an imposing presence.

"Kraaaah!"

At the deafening roar of Karmugus, players trembled in fear.

Th-that's the boss of Round 20...

It's not a joke; the intimidation is real because it's a boss.

If we kill that dragon, we can pass the round and fulfill our wishes, but...

Can the Black Scythe Lord handle it?

Though the thoughts of the frightened group were clearly conveyed, Ryumin was not afraid.

Hadn't he already captured a dragon once?

At that moment, a sudden thought crossed Ryumin's mind, and he called Yumti.

"Yumti. Is it possible to tame that one too?"

"I'll give it a try."

Since Yumti was capable of taming boss-level creatures, she immediately attempted it.

If taming succeeded, they could easily conclude the boss battle.

As Yumti aimed her staff towards the dragon, she shook her head and lowered her arm.

"No, it won't work. A message popped up saying it's impossible."

"Is that so?"

Well, he had expected it.

If all bosses could be tamed, the most cheating profession would be the Tamer, not the Reaper or anything else.

There was no reason for a boss battle in the last round.

"Well, there's nothing we can do. We have to kill it."

"Are you going to face it alone?"
ChatGPT

"Yeah. I'll go first as planned."

Ryumin stepped forward without dragging it out.

One would only know how strong it was by confronting it, but it didn't seem too frightening.

[Encountered opponent: Dragon Race.] [Dragon Slayer title effect: All stats doubled.]

"Kraaaah!"

"Damn, it's annoyingly loud."

Ryumin leaped forward and raised his scythe.

It was a light attack meant to measure the defense.

"Let's see where I can land a hit."

Karmugus followed Ryumin's movements with its eyes.

Then, it opened its mouth, creating flames.

"Too bad."

Ryumin swung his scythe down faster than the flames.

"I have no intention of making dragon barbecue."

Targeting weaknesses and vital points, he struck down.

However, something unexpected happened.
