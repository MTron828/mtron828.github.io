Title: "Episode 135 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player"

99th Floor

[Entered the 99th floor of the Tower of Trials.] [Facing the final trial will reward you with something unattainable anywhere else.] [Upon successfully clearing the 99th floor ▶ ????]

Ryumin walked forward nonchalantly as messages popped up.

A vast arena with a diameter of 150m and a single floor appeared.

Descending the stairs and walking towards the center triggered a message.

[Scanning information of the 99th floor entrant.] [Player: Black Scythe (Lv89 Reaper)] [Please wait a moment. Scanning and copying player information in progress.]

………………

…………

[Scanning and copying complete. The final trial will begin in 10 seconds.]

Exactly 10 seconds later.

Thunk-

A man clad in black armor, wielding a scythe, appeared before Ryumin.

[Fight against the enemy in front of you.]

The enemy in front of him.

It was none other than himself.

'A battle against myself. That's the final trial of the 99th floor.'

Unfazed, Ryumin raised his scythe, well aware of the situation.

The opponent, a figure eerily similar to Black Scythe, also approached with a Deathside in hand.

The top-ranked players from different regions clashed at a single point.

Clang! Clang!

The scythes clashed in mid-air, producing a clear metallic sound.

Clang- Clang-!

Sometimes, the scythes would scrape against each other.

Grrrrind-

When the scythes collided in a strength contest, the screeching sound was enough to jolt the senses.

After exchanging dozens of attacks in a short period, the two stepped back.

'It's not a mere illusion. It's a clone truly replicated just like me.'

Strength, agility, speed—there was no aspect that didn't resemble himself.

A perfect copy.

It was so identical that one could almost consider it a mirror image.

Ryumin's gaze became tense with anticipation.

It was only natural since the strongest player stood right in front of him.

At that moment, the figure took a step back, assuming a posture to swing the scythe.

Swish-

'Moonlight Step?'

Ryumin immediately jumped.

However.

One second later, as if expected, the Moonlight Step flew in the direction Ryumin had jumped.
ChatGPT

Unavoidable Angles.

However, Ryumin had already assumed a position mid-air.

'Moonlight Step.'

Two blades, bathed in moonlight, collided.

Whoosh-clang-clang-clang-clang!

As the colossal energies clashed, a chain explosion erupted.

Ryumin was pushed away by the shockwave.

The distance between them widened, and the space in between was filled with dust.

The clone, running to kill Ryumin, came to a sudden halt.

Ryumin's presence, detectable through his movements, disappeared due to the effects of the invisibility rune.

Finally.

Whoosh!

Through the dust, Ryumin's scythe emerged and struck the clone's head.

He successfully ambushed, but Ryumin couldn't smile.

The corpse wavered and disappeared.

'A decoy...!'

In a brief moment, the clone, having used a decoy, appeared behind Ryumin.

The scythe, imbued with life, aimed for the waist.

Swish-!

Ryumin's waist was grazed, but this, too, was just a decoy.

In turn, Ryumin, having anticipated the clone's move, swung his scythe.

However, as if foreseeing it, the clone narrowly avoided it and responded with its own scythe.

Clang-clang! Clang!

After exchanging three brief clashes, the clone disappeared.

Swoosh-

Ryumin also cast invisibility.

Both of them vanished from sight.

Silence dominated the surroundings.

'Indeed, not to be underestimated.'

Perhaps due to facing oneself, the skill level was far from ordinary.

Decoy runes, invisibility, Moonlight Step, and more.

The utility skills were quite high.

Ryumin was already several moves ahead, blocking all attacks.

'It's inevitable. Because of the Rune of Future Sight.'

Ryumin could foresee the clone's movements 7 seconds ahead, thanks to the Rune of Future Sight.

'Is it the same for the clone, given that it's me?'

Jumping into the air when using Moonlight Step was also for this reason. If the distance widened due to the shockwave, it could escape the range of the Rune of Future Sight.

Ryumin didn't jump into the air for no reason.

He already knew that Moonlight Steps colliding would send him flying due to the shockwave.

By creating distance and obscuring the vision with dust, the clone would no longer be able to read his movements with the Rune of Future Sight.

'But this strategy is a failure too. I can't handle his intelligence and agility.'

Ryumin, who had attempted the 99th floor, already knew the answer.

"If I can't win, I endure. That's the only option."

This battle cannot last forever.

Even though it's not visible, there is a time limit.

"It takes a whopping 24 hours."

The real strategy for the 99th floor is enduring against oneself for 24 hours.

The system only mentioned facing the enemy in front, not necessarily killing.

"In other words, the main purpose of the 99th floor is to test mental strength while fighting oneself."

Beating oneself is impossible.

Although Ryumin had attempted it dozens of times, he had never managed to defeat himself.

"Of course, it would be great to win, but based on past experiences, enduring is the limit."

If he can't win, he endures.

However, losing is not an option.

If he fails to maintain mental strength and shows the slightest vulnerability, he will be killed by his own self.

Then, he would be disqualified without mercy.

The reward for the 99th floor would be forever out of reach.

"If the means to resist angels disappear? That's absolutely unacceptable."

Ryumin gritted his teeth and endured because of this.

Of course, it's not difficult yet.

"It's been only one hour."

Although the time isn't explicitly stated, subjectively, there are still 23 hours left.

It's like a long and endless marathon.

Not being able to see the time might make it challenging, but Ryumin considered it fortunate.

"If I can see the time, my mind might waver. It's more comfortable not knowing."

Until now, he had been checking the time, but now he decided to stop being conscious of it.

He exchanges blows with the clone in front of him like running a marathon, enduring and enduring.

By doing so.

"The time will run out, and I'll be able to clear the 99th floor."

Raising his scythe again with renewed determination.

Clang-clang!

Whoosh-clang-clang-clang!

Clang-clang! Clang-clang!

Ryumin endured, using the sound of scythes colliding as his music.

He endured until the completion message for the 99th floor appeared.

How much time had passed?

He didn't know since he stopped counting after the first hour.

In a state of detached concentration, facing only the enemy in front of him.

'Is it true that the greatest enemy is oneself?'

It wasn't just a metaphor; it was true.

The current greatest opponent is that guy.

A lunatic holding a scythe, identical to Ryumin in every way.

"Ah, cursing him is like spitting on my own face? Well, it doesn't matter. He's truly insane."

In that lunatic's mind, there's only the thought of killing himself.

He swung the scythe like a madman, launching attacks with different patterns each time.

"If I were to appear as an enemy to myself, it would probably look like this."

Perhaps due to having the same level 89 stats, Ryumin never seemed to tire.

There was no way to rest for more than 5 minutes.

"It really feels like fighting with a mirror."

It's exhausting.

Is there a reason to continue this fight?

Now, he doesn't know.

He just wants to drop everything.

"It's simple. Just allow his attack once, and it'll be over."

Giving up is easy.

Even a normal attack from the Black Scythe is fatal.

"Maybe the Luck stat is high, and I'll get a critical hit. Ah, perhaps the Black Armor effect can defend against it."

By letting the attack pass with a 67% chance, if lucky, maybe he won't die once.

"Then should I just let him hit me once? Who knows, maybe I won't die?"

And if he dies?

"Just return to reality. What else."

Every time such complacent thoughts arise, Ryumin recalls the memories he experienced.

People dying.

People he couldn't protect.

Even his only sister who should have been protected in reality.

Flash-!

The enemy's Moonlight Step unfolds before him.

Instinctively, Ryumin, who was already prepared, responds with the same skill.

Kwua-kwua-kwua-kwung-!

Along with the explosion sound, his mind cleared in an instant.

"I must protect. If I don't want to see the world fall apart again."

If he dies here, the rewards for the 99th floor will be lost.

Even if he conquers 20 rounds, there's no hope without the means to resist angels.

"I lost my focus for a moment."

Ryumin's mind returned as if splashed with cold water.

Kwaga-gak-!

Blocking the scythe that was about to split his head, he engaged in a struggle of strength that no one seemed to be winning.

Ryumin's body swayed forward.

Shalalalak-

The clone, who was recently engaged in a power struggle, suddenly disappeared like an illusion.

[Endured the time limit of 24 hours.] [Cleared the 99th floor of the Tower of Trials.] [Confirmed as the first player to clear the 99th floor of the Tower of Trials.] [Established an unprecedented record in the history of the Tower of Trials!] [Your achievement will be recorded in the Akashic Record.]

He successfully conquered the long-awaited 99th floor.

Now, he could finally release the tension.

Thud-

Exhausted as if all his strength had drained away, Ryumin sank to the floor.

"Hoo, huff."

At that moment when he was breathing heavily, messages appeared almost invisible.

[The Tower of Trials admires the player's extraordinary mental strength.] [Health and mental strength have been completely restored.] [Acquired the title 'Existence Above Defeat.']

As health and mental strength were restored, messages appeared before him.

"Finally got it. The title to resist angels."

Ryumin opened the information window for the title.
