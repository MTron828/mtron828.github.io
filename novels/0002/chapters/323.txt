Title: Episode 323 of the 100th Regression for a Max-Level Player

Resonance Echo

"Arin!"

"Yes?"

Minjuri urgently sought out Seo Arin.

"How about using the resonance echo to block the next attack? Set the summons like a wall."

"Ah...!"

Minjuri's idea was simple.

Set up the summons like a wall and make them invincible using Seo Arin's max-level skill, Resonance Echo.

Wouldn't that allow them to block area-of-effect attacks at least once?

It was an idea born from that assumption.

"Are you suggesting to use the invincible summons as shields?"

"Yes. With Yanti Unni and John Delgado's summons, we should be able to defend the current number of people well enough."

It was a plausible method.

Before coming here, she had tested both Yanti's monsters and John Delgado's summons to confirm that they could become invincible.

"Alright. Let's try it Minjuri's way. Yanti Unni! John Delgado-nim!"

"What's going on?"

"...?"

Seo Arin called the two and explained Minjuri's method to them.

Upon hearing it, both of them nodded simultaneously, as if they had made some kind of agreement.

"Not a bad idea."

"Black Scythe-nim is putting in so much effort to protect us; we should try something."

"But can the summons block attacks like light?"

"We have to concentrate them as densely as possible."

"What's the cooldown for Resonance Echo?"

"It's one hour. We won't be able to use it twice."

"We can manage to block it once."

"We don't have time. Let's start right away."

The unanimous decision of the four was swiftly put into action.

"Kraaaah!"

Yanti's monsters, including the three-headed dragon, were summoned one after another.

John Delgado also summoned, as if acknowledging that he couldn't fall behind, the Archangel Sariel, nine demon aristocrats, and dozens of undead.

Seo Arin, with her limited number of summons, also summoned them and gathered people.

"Everyone, come this way!"

"We will create a wall with summons. Everyone, hide behind!"

Large summons were placed at the front, and smaller summons filled the gaps in between, creating a defensive formation.

As they lined up the summons, a sturdy wall was createdâ€”a wall strong enough to withstand area-of-effect attacks.

"Has everyone moved behind the summons?"

"Yes! All 61 members have been confirmed!"

Upon Yanti's preparedness announcement, Seo Arin, with tension in her eyes, looked at the angel being slashed by the Black Scythe.

"The invincible time of Resonance Echo is 5 seconds. We have to use it at the right timing so that everyone can survive or be wiped out."

With determined eyes, Seo Arin closely followed the movements of the angel, as if vowing not to miss the timing.

Slash!

Blood splattered in crimson as Artharos's head fell.

However, as if clinging to life, he took advantage of the brief moment of invincibility and moved forward little by little.

It was a sight that had become all too familiar.

"Darn it. The fourth area-of-effect attack will be ready soon."

He could dodge at a rapid speed himself, but others couldn't.

"Should I use the Rune of Light now, just in case?"

He had intended to save it for emergencies, but now might be the time to use it to save people.

Slash!

He beheaded Artharos once again to prevent him from approaching allies.

As he turned his head to gauge the distance, an unexpected sight caught Ryu Min's eyes.

"What's going on? Why are the summons gathered like that?"

Confirming the 61 players hiding behind the summons as shields, Ryu Min quickly grasped the situation.

"Are they trying to block it with Resonance Echo?"

Sure enough, reading Seo Arin's thoughts at the front, he couldn't help but find it interesting.

"Minjuri's idea, huh? A pretty clever thought."

Smirking, Ryu Min read Artharos's thoughts and realized that the area-of-effect attack was ready.

"Foolish humans. Gathering in one place to be killed. Then, I shall grant your wish."

"Now, Seo Arin!"

[Rage of the Divine.]

Whether in response to Ryu Min's voice or because she intended to use it regardless, Seo Arin used Resonance Echo before the area-of-effect attack reached them.

Kwaaaaah!
ChatGPT

The light spread with a fierce momentum, as if it would burn everything, but it couldn't penetrate the invincible summoned creatures.

The players behind them were in a similar situation.

After the storm passed, the players, who had crouched down like turtles, lifted their heads.

"I-I survived."

"We did it!"

People cheered.

They successfully blocked the area-of-effect attack without any casualties.

For Artharos, who had expected an uninterrupted massacre, it was beyond absurd.

[You managed to endure by making the summons invincible. I'll give you credit for the wit. But your deaths are only a matter of time....]

Slash!

"Whether it's a matter of time or not, we'll see."

The head that had fallen from Ryu Min's scythe returned to its original place with a flash of light.

It was truly unbelievable.

"We blocked it once, but the next one is the problem."

The fifth, the sixth, up to the seventh.

Can they block all the area-of-effect attacks?

Watching Artharos chanting spells as if showing off, Ryu Min felt impatience.

Slash!

"I killed him 40 times with just now's scythe."

The stats, which were initially at 100%, had dropped to 1.65%.

Even though his strength had significantly weakened, it was still threatening to other players.

"He won't stop being a threat unless the stats decrease to one millionth."

To achieve that, he needed to kill him 92 more times.

"Until then, I can't block the area-of-effect attacks. Now is the perfect time to try."

Ryu Min, who thought he had killed enough, decided to execute his prepared plan.

"Rune of Chains. Restraint."

Shrrrrr...

Instead of killing Artharos, he summoned chains to restrain him.

His arms and legs were bound tightly by chains emerging from a different dimension.

"What are you doing? Do you think you can restrain me with this?"

When Artharos exerted force, the chains moved with a metallic sound.

"Although the description says the chains have infinite durability, it doesn't mean they can bind the opponent."

Pulling with strength like that wouldn't break them.

Snap, snap, snap!

Ryu Min severed the tendons in the arms and legs to prevent him from exerting force.

Additionally, he cut Artharos's eyes.

Crimson blood splattered, but Artharos, accustomed to pain, didn't flinch.

[Blocking movement and obscuring vision? So, what's the point?]

"It has a point. I can't slow down time."

However, Ryu Min didn't fall into the trap of giving away his intentions by providing unnecessary information. He simply retrieved an item from his inventory without responding.

He couldn't afford any mistakes; opportunities would be lost.

"What are you doing?"

As if he could see from afar, Artharos furrowed his brow.

"What item is that? What are you doing?"

"What am I doing?"

Ryu Min grabbed Artharos's jaw.

"You'll see when I use it."

[M-Musinjistle...!]

It looked like he was trying to feed an item to Artharos.

Of course, Artharos, who had no intention of ingesting a suspicious item, struggled.

But the taut chains prevented Artharos from moving.

With stats exceeding 200 million, he couldn't budge an inch.

"Well, it's around 3 million now, given the decrease to 1.65%."

Even so, it was still a significant amount of stats.

Unable to release the restraint, Ryu Min had severed tendons in the arms and legs.

Rumble...

Power emanated from Artharos's entire body.

Using the radiant technique he had seen before, a buff that increased stats by 50%.

[Um...!]

As if refusing to eat it at all costs, Artharos struggled desperately, even using the buff. However, the chains remained firm.

'If his stats were high, he might have broken free with strength. But now.'

In his weakened state, he had no choice but to drink the mysterious potion, even with the restraints.

Ryu Min forcefully poured the potion into Artharos's mouth and sealed it shut.

Splurt!

"Don't spit it out; swallow it as it is."

Although he held the jaw tightly to prevent Artharos from opening his mouth, Artharos only held the potion without swallowing.

When Ryu Min directly slashed his throat, a gulp sound followed.

"That's right. Swallow it like that."

Having successfully forced the potion down Artharos, Ryu Min finally smirked.

What he fed him was none other than a Memory Erase Potion.

'Fortunately, I have one more potion.'
ChatGPT

Ryu Min, who was grinning, looked at Artharos, whose eyeballs rolled up.

"When I see that look, you might think I poisoned you, but no. What I gave you was a potion that erases memories. It's a miraculous potion that can turn even the God of War like you into a fool."

[......]

"So stop resisting and accept it. Soon, you won't remember it yourself."

Artharos lost consciousness without being able to respond.

At the same time, Ryu Min gained time.

Time to browse through Artharos's memories and erase them.

The Rune of Inner Thoughts could extract and read not only the opponent's thoughts but also the hidden images in their subconscious.

It was truly a deceitful rune when it came to obtaining information, but that didn't mean it could unearth the entirety of a person's past.

"But Memory Erase Potion is possible."

This potion, which could freely delete the memories of the one who ingested it, allowed Ryu Min to thoroughly explore and erase Artharos's experiences as if watching a video.

From being born as a celestial, how he became a god and reached his current position.

"He showed remarkable achievements in the Celestial Demon Duel and rose in status to become a god recognized by the Creator God."

Artharos was a genius among gods, especially in the realm of combat.

He was so powerful that he had no equal among the gods, and at an early age, he claimed both power and glory. His stature only grew higher.

Perhaps because of this, an unforeseen problem arose from meddling with Earthâ€”a realm that shouldn't have been touched, all because of his obsession with power.

"He touched another dimension of Earth, forbidden even among the gods, and received a curse from humans? Is that the curse of immortality?"

It was hard to believe that such a curse was placed on a mere human, but it was true.

As a result, Artharos, who became immortal due to the curse, had his once-proud nose broken like an unruly student....

"Behind the scenes, there's a story about experiencing countless deaths leading to emotional numbness."

Becoming eternally immortal, achieving an undying body, might not sound like a curse, but it was something you wouldn't understand without experiencing it.

Every being concludes their journey with death, marking the end of life.
ChatGPT

However, Artharos had to continue his journey eternally.

Living through endless ages, regardless of his own will.

Such a life was not what Artharos desired.

That's why he engaged in countless acts of self-harm to seek death.

"But I couldn't die. No matter how many times I died, I kept resurrecting."

Unable to endure it any longer, he sought out the cursed human who had placed the curse on him, begging for release....

Humans turned out to be unexpectedly cunning.

Artharos regretted it to the point of pounding the ground, an unsurprising turn of events.

"He turned out to be a pitiful guy."

As Ryu Min read Artharos's memories, he could understand even more about what Artharos felt.

"Even so, that doesn't mean I'll go easy on him."

The plan to end the crisis by completely erasing his memories remained unchanged.

Nevertheless, the process of reading his memories was necessary.

By unlocking the void space through his memories, Ryu Min intended to discover a way to pass through the 20 rounds.

Moreover, he had identified the hidden figure behind the scenes, likely a god named Nyx.

"Perhaps Nyx is the god behind all this."

With such thoughts, Ryu Min delved into the past and recognized Nyx's face.

The original god seemed to be none other than that guy.

"But... there's one more person, isn't there?"
