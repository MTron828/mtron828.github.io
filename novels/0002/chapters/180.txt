Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 180"

VS Magyeongrok

[Memory Erasure Potion]

Type: Consumable
Grade: Legendary
Effect: Reads the target's memories and deletes the desired portion
Usage Restriction: Master rank or higher
Description: Can read the target's memories and erase the desired portion. It is even possible to turn someone into a fool if desired.

The reason Ryumin was surprised was none other than the fact that the Memory Erasure Potion was an item that had an extremely low probability of appearing.

"It was an item that only came out once even when I used Joo Sung-tak to catch a doppelganger before..."

Fortunately, it came out again this time.

Ryumin's mouth curved up happily as he picked up the potion.

"Someday, there will be a use for this."

The last time it appeared, he used it to delete the shocked memory of Minjuri, who had learned the true identity of the Black Scythe.

"I wonder how it will be used this time."

For now, he had to wait and see where to use it.

"Master, now that your goal is achieved, will you leave the maze?"

"No. There is still something I need to do."

"Something to do? What..."

"It's not something you have to do. It's something I have to do."

Avoiding a direct answer to what exactly it was, Ryumin nodded as if to follow him.

"Let's go. You just need to watch from a distance."

"Yes."

As Magyeongrok walked through the maze, he asked An Sang-cheol.

"Has the Black Scythe still not been traced?"

"Yes... Even searching with someone else and the surrounding exploration yield no results. It seems like this forest is blocking external signals."

"I guess we have to see it that way."

Magyeongrok, who said that, suddenly gave a bitter smile.

"I'm sorry, Director An. It's because I suggested going to find the Black Scythe for no reason."

"No, it's not. I'm the one who should apologize. I suggested receiving the buff of democracy for no reason..."

"I would have rather tracked democracy. If we did that, we wouldn't be in this situation."

"No. The president's judgment was not wrong. It was just bad luck."

'Bad luck...'
ChatGPT

Magyeongrok wondered whether he could attribute his entrance into this maze-like forest purely to luck.

"Didn't the prophet know? That I would face such a situation while following the Black Scythe."

Even if he knew the truth, Magyeongrok couldn't hold him responsible. Considering what the prophet had provided so far, which couldn't be valued in terms of money, was it fair to be upset because he hid information about the future?

Unless he wanted to sever their relationship, which he didn't, it was not something he should do.

"At this point, the prophet has the upper hand. Those who hear prophecies, including me, are thoroughly at a disadvantage."

In any case, there was no way to find out the truth. From the perspective of the prophet, saying he simply didn't see the prophecy would be enough.

Regardless, what was certain was that he had brought about this result with his own choices.

"Hoo, I wonder what happened to Kristin."

"Are you worried?"

"Of course. She is my fianc√©e."

It was a business-like emotion, but the concern was indeed real, wasn't it?

"Let's try to get out of this damn forest for now. We should be able to find a way out somehow."

"We've been coming out the same way all along..."

"But can we just stay still? We heard something like an explosion a while ago."

The fact that they heard an explosion in the previously quiet forest meant that someone was there. For them, who felt like they were sailing through a vast ocean without any lights, even that was a big comfort.

"We have plenty of time, so let's not give up and keep going."

"But, sir, what if we get out and there's not much time left?"

"Would it really take that long? As long as we don't lose hope, a way will definitely appear."

It was a hopeful story, but in reality, it was vague and unsupported. Magyeongrok couldn't guarantee how many hours it would take to escape the forest.

"Maybe we won't be able to get out until 24 hours have passed. Still, let's go until the end. After all, there's nothing else to do, right?"

"Understood."

"And when you get out, if there's any spare time, find players from other countries. Find them and kill them regardless of nationality, as soon as you come across them."

To kill people on sight.

It was a Nazi-like order, but there was no other choice.
ChatGPT

Killing players from other countries not only earns you murder points but can also cause you to lose the points you have.

Do you make the opponent's country lose points while gaining points for yourself?

With this reasoning, there is no reason not to kill.

"Perhaps players from other countries have the same thoughts as me. Wars might be happening somewhere, where people are killing each other for points."

An Sang-cheol, who thought it was a reasonable statement, nodded his head.

Killing people was something they had become tired of in the four rounds, and he had already assisted Magyeongrok's hobby even before becoming a player.

Staining their hands with the blood of others was no obstacle for the two.

While they were walking, promising to slaughter, at that moment.

"Huh?"

Both of them stopped as if they had made a promise.

There was someone standing in the distance, blocking the path.

"A person?"

"There's a person?"

Their expressions brightened as they discovered the rare sight of a person.

Finding a person was such a joyous occasion.

They smiled as if they had found a beacon in the uncertain sea.

"Hello, nice to meet you. Meeting someone else here..."

An Sang-cheol approached with a smile.

However, when the smile reached a distance where facial features could be distinguished, it disappeared as if it had never been there.

An Sang-cheol, who had regained his composure, grabbed Magyeongrok's shoulder as they walked.

"President, wait a moment."

"Hmm? Why?"

As Magyeongrok looked, An Sang-cheol's face was endlessly serious.

Even anger could be seen in his eyes.

"That brat, it's him."

"Who? Do you know him?"

"Yes, it's Hwang Yong-min."

At the mention of that name, Magyeongrok's expression solidified just like An Sang-cheol's.

Although he had never seen him, it was a name he couldn't avoid hearing from An Sang-cheol.

"The punk who attacked Director An and Seo Bae during the second round?"

"Yes."

"Are you sure? Wasn't he supposed to be dead?"

"According to Seo Arin, that's what she said. The prophet also proved that he died."

"So, is he really undead as he mentioned before? Is that it?"

"It seems so."

Magyeongrok had already heard the story of Seo Arin encountering Hwang Yong-min.

There was also talk about a profession that could revive corpses.
ChatGPT

"At that time, I just let it go, thinking it was fine, but to encounter him in a place like this."

Magyeongrok looked at the opponent again, as if he couldn't believe it.

For someone claiming to be undead, he looked impeccably human, and his appearance was indistinguishable from an ordinary person.

"President, could Seo Arin be lying? To me, he looks like a real human..."

"I don't know. One thing is certain..."

Magyeongrok raised the sword surrounded by Dark Aura.

"He didn't appear to have come here for a friendly chat with us."

Hwang Yong-min, standing still, didn't have a friendly gaze.

His eyes were full of hostility as he raised his fist.

"Are you going to deal with me with your bare fists? Seems like you've seriously underestimated me."

Magyeongrok smirked and made up his mind.

To kill him and take the points.

Undead or zombie, the crucial thing was that an enemy had appeared.

"Now's the time to take the initiative."

The thought was brief, and the action was swift.

"Eat him."

The Dark Aura, wrapped around the sword, transformed into a giant claw-like hand, shooting out. If caught by that black claw, one's life would be taken, providing dark magic to Magyeongrok.

But Hwang Yong-min was faster than expected.

Swish!

Like a well-trained boxer, he avoided the aura and closed the distance.

However, Magyeongrok was also approaching him.

"I expected you to dodge."

As Magyeongrok raised the sword above his head, the Dark Aura receded, enveloping the sword.

"Doomstrike."

The level 40 skill of the Dark Knight descended straight towards Hwang Yong-min.

The timing, angle, everything was perfect.

It was absolutely unavoidable.

At least until he narrowly managed to dodge the skill.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A louder explosion echoed than what was heard in the forest.

The spot where Hwang Yong-min had avoided seemed deeply cratered, as if hit by a meteor.

"Darn it. I poured one-third of the dark magic."

Doomstrike was a skill that allowed adjusting the amount of dark magic.

He poured one-third to kill in one blow, but unfortunately, the guy managed to evade it.

"Lucky bastard."

There was no time to curse him.

Hwang Yong-min, who had avoided the attack, was already closing in with his fist.
ChatGPT

"Dark Armor."

Swoosh-

The Dark Orror instantly enveloped Magyeongrok's entire body, providing powerful protection against physical damage, even though it was weak against magical damage...

That's what he knew.

Until Hwang Yong-min's fist touched.

Crack!

"Ugh!"

"President!"

With a sound of something breaking, Magyeongrok was thrown back ungracefully.

He quickly got up, but he felt intense pain in his ribs.

"Ugh, the Dark Armor, which was unharmed even after taking hits from the Minotaur..."

Dark Armor was an extraordinary defense skill that absorbed up to 70% of incoming damage as dark magic.

Judging by the fact that the lump of dark magic had diminished, it seemed to have exceeded the maximum capacity.

"Is that just a simple undead? How strong is this guy?"

The damage he experienced firsthand was shocking, considering he looked like an ordinary human.

"This guy!"

Magyeongrok, enraged by his injuries, rushed forward, wielding his sword. However, despite his momentum, he couldn't even touch the tip of Hwang Yong-min's hair.

Swish!

"Cough!"

Instead, An Sang-cheol, infuriated by Magyeongrok's injuries, ran forward and swung his sword. However, contrary to his momentum, he staggered back.

"Ugh, P-President. Come behind me! I'll protect you."

Even as his helmet was crushed and his nose sank in, An Sang-cheol raised his shield.

Eeeeeeeeng-

When the shield-specific skill, 'Knight's Protection,' was activated, a wide protective barrier centered around the shield formed.

"Although your movements slow down, this skill can protect 80% of physical damage. If you stay behind me, you can be at ease..."

That was when.

Hwang Yong-min, who had approached to the point where he was almost in front of them, threw a punch.

Crack!

"Ugh!"

For the first time, the shield that had never wavered while in use shook with a single punch.

Thud! Bang!

"Ugh, ugh!"

With the second and third consecutive attacks, An Sang-cheol spat out blood.

The damage that penetrated the shield was fully transmitted to An Sang-cheol.

Magyeongrok, who couldn't stand watching his right arm being attacked, did not miss the opportunity for a counterattack.

"Doomstrike."

Bang! Bang! Bang!

He used the remaining half of the dark magic.
ChatGPT

With the timing of Hwang Yong-min raising his shield, Magyeongrok unleashed a blow that was seemingly unavoidable, a strike he could proudly call a counter.

However.

"...This monster."

Even that, Hwang Yong-min managed to avoid.

It couldn't be anything other than extraordinary agility.

Although Magyeongrok was disappointed that he missed, he had already prepared for this moment, thinking about the next move.

"Eat him."

Like a slime extending eagerly towards its prey, the Dark Orror unfolded once again, targeting Hwang Yong-min.

Perhaps the timing was mind-boggling, but Hwang Yong-min couldn't evade the web of darkness.

"It's done! He's caught!"

Without a doubt, he was swallowed whole.

Now it was time to devour his life while he was still alive.

"Huh?"

However, an unbelievable situation unfolded.
