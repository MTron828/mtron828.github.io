Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 125"

Ryu Min's Request

Before going to the warehouse,

Ma Kyung-rok was walking through the streets at night.

It was because of Ryu Min's phone call, asking him to come to the alley for a discreet conversation.

"Why would someone call me out like this on a daring night, especially when they have something to say? If there's something to discuss, it could be done over the phone. Why call someone out, and at such a late hour?"

Ma Kyung-rok found Ryu Min's behavior unusual, even for a prophet who was not usually predictable.

The perplexity continued even after meeting Ryu Min.

"Ah, Prophet-nim. You're here."

"...."

"Anyway, you have something to say, right?"

"...."

Ryu Min didn't respond directly; instead, he just set the mood without saying anything.

"Why create this atmosphere if you're not going to respond? What important thing is he trying to say?"

Judging by his expression, it seemed like the weight of the world was on his shoulders, as if he bore a grave and serious concern alone.

"Boss. It's out of the blue, but there's something I need to confess."

"A confession?"

The word 'confession' brought various thoughts to Ma Kyung-rok's mind.

"No way, right?"

He entertained the worst assumptions but quickly dismissed them as they seemed more suited to a melodramatic plot.

"I actually know a secret about you, Boss."

"A... secret?"

Ma Kyung-rok immediately became guarded at the look in Ryu Min's eyes.

"As you know, I am a prophet. Due to that, I unintentionally glimpsed into your future. This secret is something I saw during that time."

A long sigh escaped Ryu Min's lips.

Ma Kyung-rok was unaware that it was a meticulously calculated performance.

"In reality... You were hunting, weren't you?"

"...."

"Yes, hunting not just ordinary people but specifically targeting criminals. That's how I found out. So, I don't view you negatively, Boss. Naturally, I don't see you as an enemy. If I did, would I have been your partner all this time?"

"...."

"But I haven't considered you a complete ally either. Knowing that you indulge in murder as a hobby every night, if I didn't maintain some level of caution, wouldn't that be a lie?"

Though unspoken, Ma Kyung-rok understood.

Regardless of who the other person was, if they committed murder, they were a murderer.

From an observer's perspective, it could only be repulsive.

That was the typical reaction.

And through it all, Ma Kyung-rok had anticipated everything.
ChatGPT

I never expected a confession to be so straightforward.

"Prophet-nim, have you ever killed an insect?"

"...."

"Of course, you must have. Even if not recently, when you were young, you probably cut off the legs of insects out of curiosity. Children who don't know the pain it causes often engage in cruel acts out of curiosity. It's speaking without knowing the cruelty."

"...."

"I did that too. I killed countless insects when I was young. It was dirty. There was a perception that if something looks unpleasant and dirty, you should squash it. That perception persisted as I grew up. I saw people as nothing more than shells, while disgusting insects wriggled around."

This time, Ryu Min fell silent.

"I decided to clean up insects since high school. Knowing that I was from a chaebol, there was this leech-like guy sticking to me, eating off my success. He was so disgusting. So, I couldn't resist the impulse and got rid of him. It was simple. With money, there was nothing that couldn't be done."

"...."

"From that point on, I started actively getting rid of insects. It might sound psycho when I say this, but honestly, it was exhilarating."

"...."

"I don't know how many I've killed since then. I haven't counted. But let's just say fingers and toes aren't enough to describe it."

Ryu Min looked at Ma Kyung-rok with a face that seemed unsure of what expression to make.

Ma Kyung-rok continued as if he still had something to say.

"People commonly use the term psychopath to describe someone like me. I'm not sure if it's accurate or not, but one thing is for sureâ€”I don't mess with ordinary people. Prophet-nim, you also know that I only deal with the seedlings emitting a foul smell, right?"

"...."

"Prophet-nim, when I first saw you, I had some expectations. If you can see the future, can't a prophet see such a hobby of mine as well? If so, why have you known about it but let it go untouched until now? Why?"

"...."

"Though I had my doubts, I never asked until now. I didn't want to reveal my flaws unnecessarily and tarnish my image. But I never expected you to be this honest first."

Ma Kyung-rok's face, speaking candidly, was more serious than ever.

"Even knowing that I am a murderer, you've been overlooking it? What's the reason? Why haven't you reported it to the police?"

"I'll be honest."

Ryu Min said, putting on a tense expression.

"I lacked confidence. I didn't have the confidence to win against you in a fight, nor did I have the confidence to handle the losses that would result from it."

"...."

"Besides, there's no remaining evidence, right? Would the police believe what I say based on the future? No, even if they did, could it be considered evidence?"

"Then why are you telling me now?"

As Ryu Min brought up the main point, her expression became even more serious.

"I want to ask President Ma to clean up the trash."

"What does that mean? Surely...?"

"Yes. The trash you're thinking of, President Ma. It's overflowing where I know. The situation requires urgent help from President Ma."

The cleaner Ryu Min was referring to was Ma Kyung-rok.

There was no better candidate to exploit dark magic against humans.

"Have you heard of Pelseba?"

"Yes. Isn't it a cafe exclusive to players?"

"You're aware of it. But have you ever considered joining?"

"I don't have hobbies for online gatherings. Even if I join, I wouldn't have time to meet offline. But why suddenly talk about a cafe?"

"Actually, this cafe, when you look closely, is a place infested with murderers."

"What?"

Ryu Min smiled and continued with more details.

The interview methods of Pelseba's murderers and their tactics for ensnaring players.

These were pieces of information that one wouldn't know without actually joining.

"So... it's a cafe where vermin-like creatures breed."

Disgust flashed across Ma Kyung-rok's face.

It was a face that wanted to kill dirty things immediately.

"But how do you, as a prophet, know about these things? Did you, by any chance, join...?"

Ma Kyung-rok was suspicious, not only about joining but even beyond that.

Certainly, unless one was at a higher level, these were pieces of information that couldn't be known.
ChatGPT

"Please set aside any misunderstandings. I have never joined. I merely happened to meet a high-ranking player from there and glimpsed into his future."

"Ah. In that case..."

Doubt disappeared from Ma Kyung-rok's eyes.

"So, if I summarize what Prophet-nim said, players who have joined the cafe called Pelseba are all those who passed murder interviews and are considered trash to be dealt with? You're asking me to handle them now."

"Yes, that's correct. Currently, after a change in leadership, murder interviews have been completely abolished. However, existing members are all facing charges of either participating in or abetting murders. Considering the present and the future, they are a group that cannot be ignored."

"Why entrust this to me without reporting it?"

"Realistically, even if reported, it would be impossible to prosecute. Most of the evidence has been destroyed, and being players, it's practically impossible to confine them using force."

"That's true."

"So, that's why President Ma's help is needed. Isn't killing people as good as accumulating dark magic for the Dark Knight?"

Ma Kyung-rok's eyes widened as if surprised.

"...You seem to know well about my profession."

"Of course. When I see prophecies, I can learn various pieces of information."

Ma Kyung-rok nodded, asking again as if to confirm.

"Specifically, what do you want me to do?"

"Please kill all the trash from Pelseba. If you lure them to a secluded place, President Ma can go there, relieve stress, and gain dark magic. You won't be able to kill them all in a day. There are too many of them to handle over a few months."

"How do you plan to lure them?"

"We can help by creating wanted posters with their faces, inducing fear, and assisting them in escaping overseas. Since I've already made one high-ranking member on their side join my side, there shouldn't be any problem with recruiting personnel."

"Hmm."

Though he didn't show it, Ma Kyung-rok was subtly surprised by Ryu Min's proposal.

'There's a detailed plan already?'

He was entertaining the thought that it might be a joke.

If the prophet suddenly turned the conversation around, he was ready to burst into laughter like a fool.

'Now I get it. The prophet is now 100% sincere.'
ChatGPT

If it's sincere, the conversation changes.

"This is an opportunity. A chance to easily obtain dark magic."

The Dark Knight profession indeed demands a considerable amount of dark magic. It's like a high-performance foreign car that consumes a lot of fuel.

As powerful as it is, it comes with a burden compared to other ordinary occupations.

"Is Prophet-nim trying to alleviate that burden for me?"

For himself, all he needed to do was to spoon-feed from a well-prepared table.

It was truly an enticing proposal.

There was no reason to refuse.

However, Ma Kyung-rok hesitated for a moment.

There was a factor hindering him from accepting eagerly.

It was none other than the burden.

Executing murders in collaboration with a prophet, rather than the private killings he had been doing so far.

Sharing the stigma of murder naturally brought a different kind of burden.

Ryu Min was aware of this fact.

'A motive is needed.'

A grand motive wasn't necessary.

Just a little push on the back, and he would move on his own.

Ryu Min took out an item from her inventory.

"Take it."

"Yes? What is this...?"

Suddenly receiving something, Ma Kyung-rok felt bewildered.

"It's a dark magic potion. I thought President Ma might need it."

"Ah."

Only after examining the item's options did Ma Kyung-rok become surprised.

It was indeed a potion meant for him.

"It's a bribe. Don't feel too burdened; I'm not asking for help for free."

"Ah..."

Feeling unexpectedly gifted.

For a moment, the burden on Ma Kyung-rok disappeared.

"You've set up everything. Haven't you?"

He was considering the possibility that this might be a joke.

If the prophet suddenly turned the conversation around, he was ready to burst into laughter like a fool.

'Now I understand. The prophet is genuinely sincere now.'

"Ggghhh...."

Ma Kyung-rok tapped the face of the player whose dying breaths filled the air.

"Is this the end?"

"Ggghhh."

"Answer me. Don't you have anything left?"

"Uh, nothing... I've spit out everything in my inventory..."

Ma Kyung-rok, looking at the items spread out before him, asked again.

"Sure?"

"Ggghhh... Y-yes. I've spit out everything... Please..."

Feeling the unexpected gift, the burden on Ma Kyung-rok disappeared momentarily.

"Even set up a table for me, and now a gift like this..."

"It's not an easy task despite the table."

"I'll use it well. Prophet-nim, leave the trash cleanup to me."

Ma Kyung-rok and Ryu Min simultaneously shared satisfied laughter.

"Ggghhh...."

The dying breath of the player was exhaled as Ma Kyung-rok gently tapped their face.

"Is this the end?"

"Ggghhh."

"Answer me. Don't you have anything more?"

"Uh, nothing... I've spat out everything in my inventory..."

Ma Kyung-rok, looking at the items spread out before him, asked again.

"Are you sure?"

"Ggghhh... Y-yes. I've spat out everything... Please..."

Feeling the unexpected gift, the burden on Ma Kyung-rok disappeared momentarily.

"Even set up a table for me, and now a gift like this..."

"It's not an easy task despite the table."

"I'll use it well. Prophet-nim, leave the trash cleanup to me."

Ma Kyung-rok and Ryu Min simultaneously shared satisfied laughter.

The player's body shivered with fear.

"Please get rid of this monster... Ugh!"

A dark aura clung to the lower half of the man's body, devouring his life force bit by bit.

It was painful, but the fear of being devoured alive by a beast was even greater.

"Alright. Trust me."

Ma Kyung-rok gathered his energy.

The Dark Reaper covered the Dark Ora as promised.

"I'll gracefully end it as we agreed."

"T-Thank you..."

Before the words were even finished, the player's head fell to the ground.

Ma Kyung-rok put the sword he had swung back into his inventory.

"They were going to die anyway. It won't be a problem to loot a few items."

A satisfied smile appeared on Ma Kyung-rok's face.

He collected more items than he expected.

Most of them were intended for the prophet.

"If they are Koreans, they should have some conscience."

Smirking, Ma Kyung-rok used the skill to erase traces.

The bodies of the five players disappeared as if they were never there.
