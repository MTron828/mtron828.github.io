Title: Episode 322 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Wrath of the God

Roar-

The fiery blade, engulfed in flames, tore through the limbs of Artharos.

Without any reaction, Artharos' body, now lifeless, adhered as if time were reversing.

"You're fast. Faster and stronger than before. It must be because of the buffs my comrades provided, right?"

Muttering, Artharos instantly turned the surroundings into a space of pure white.

"You have entered the void space." "No external buffs apply in this space." "What do you think about this?"

"What, what is this place?"

"Why did the hall turn white?"

"More importantly, what is this message? It says buffs don't apply."

"I, I have a lock symbol on the buff that was cast on me!"

"Me too!"

"The buffs are not working!"

Ignoring the bewildered voices of the people, Ryumin opened the status window.

Bless, Swift, Safety Barrier, Blessing of the Saint, double buffs, and more.

All the buffs that were applied were now locked.

The stats had decreased four times compared to the initial state.

"Have you experienced this before? In the place I created, no buffs apply."

"Of course."

"Then you understand that you can't escape until I release it, right?"

"I get it. But what's the big deal?"

Though the buffs became useless, and they were confined in the void space, Ryumin's momentum did not waver.

"If you can't kill me, victory is impossible. What's the use of being trapped in a barrier? And..."

"Death's energy is activated." "All stats of the target are reduced by 50%."

In the blink of an eye, Ryumin, who had lowered Artharos' stats by half, plunged forward.

"If there are no buffs, so what."

Swish!

The scythe pierced through Artharos' heart completely.

"Do you think you can defeat me?"

Artharos, who was resurrecting once again, showed a slightly surprised expression.

"It's amazing. Excluding the buffs, you've become several times stronger than when I saw you last."

He had no choice but to be strong.

"I've been killing Michael and the angels, stacking up my stats."

"I know you're stronger than me. I've already lost 31 times, so it's no secret. And in just a short period, you've died twice already. It's bitter with a 10% penalty already applied. However..."

Artharos' pupils glowed purple.

"The time you gave me to talk, it's your defeat..."

"Defeat, you say?"

Artharos, with surprised eyes, quickly turned his head.

Ryumin, who had moved behind with a teleportation skill, swung and beheaded Artharos.

"Trying to slow down time again? But what's this? I found out it won't work unless our eyes meet."

During the previous battle, Ryumin had almost fallen victim to a technique that caused memory erasure.

But Ryumin wasn't the type to fall for the same trick twice.

"This is not time stop or anything. It's a technique that extremely slows down the time of the opponent whose eyes meet mine."

In other words, if you avoid eye contact, the technique won't affect you.

Knowing when the opponent will use the technique with the rune of foresight made it easy to deal with.

"Do you think I would fall for it again?"

"Having fallen once, you managed to decipher the core of the technique. You're certainly not an ordinary human."

Artharos, who had completed his body restoration in the meantime, smiled as if complimenting him.

But it didn't take long to realize that it was not a compliment, but rather mockery.

"You can't defeat me. Somehow you know that, right?"

As if not wanting to know the reason, Ryumin beheaded Artharos again.

Already dead four times, he resurrected, enveloped in a brilliant light.

"You're a weak human because of emotions."

Artharos began casting a spell.

Knowing what kind of spell it was, having already read his intentions, Ryumin killed Artharos once again.

Although the spell was interrupted, the resurrected Artharos remained calm.
ChatGPT

[Even if I die, I can continue casting the spell. And that includes the time of resurrection, just like now.]

Boom! Clang!

Ryumin swung the scythe, but couldn't touch Artharos. During the 3 seconds it took for him to resurrect and reconstruct his body, Ryumin couldn't interfere.

[During these 3 seconds of resurrection...]
Sizzle!

[If I continue casting the spell...]
Sizzle!

[No matter how many times you kill me...]
Sizzle!

[You won't be able to stop the spell.]

Even after killing Artharos eight times, Ryumin couldn't stop him.

Artharos, prepared to cast the skill, was smirking.

With an urgent expression, Ryumin shouted at Christine, "Now!"

[Receive the wrath of the gods.]

As Ryumin shouted, light emanated from Artharos' body.

The spreading light was so intense that it seemed to incinerate all living beings.

Kwaaaaah!

The damage was devastating, enough to obliterate all life forms within a 100-meter radius.

However...

[...!]

Artharos could only look around with surprised eyes.

"What happened?"

In a situation where not a single human died and everyone endured, he couldn't help but doubt his own eyes.

That's when Artharos saw golden light flickering and extinguishing from the bodies of the humans.

And he realized.

[A group invincibility skill?]

The priest's max-level skill, [Protect Cell], had protected all party members.

"Thank you, Christine."

"If you were a little late, it could have been a disaster."

People expressed their gratitude to Christine in various ways.

Ryumin also praised her with a nod.

If his signal had been delayed, or if Christine had reacted a little later, it could have been a catastrophe.

"But I only risked my life once."

Artharos would attempt the area-of-effect skill again.

However, Protect Cell had a cooldown of 60 minutes, making it unusable for a second time.

"I need to kill Artharos as much as possible to stack the penalties."

So Ryumin, with that in mind, swung his scythe again.

Sizzle!

"Trying to kill me to minimize the damage. One."
ChatGPT

Even as Artharos' head flew off and he died, he didn't lose his laughter.

"Well, the only issue is the matter of time until you and your comrades die. You're well aware of that, right?"

Instead of replying, Ryumin took Artharos' life.

Although he resurrected again, there was nothing else Ryumin could do.

Depleting his strength by stacking penalties as much as possible was the only option.

But even doing so didn't guarantee the safety of his comrades.

"Artharos's estimated stats are around 200 million. Even if I reduce his stats by feeding him penalties, I can't guarantee the safety of my allies."

With stats reduced to 1%, it would still be 2 million.

Even players with stats in the hundreds wouldn't be able to withstand Artharos' damage.

Just a graze could lead to death.

Then why not continue killing him?

Why not reduce his stats to 0.0001%?

Of course, if other players also weakened Artharos enough to handle, he wouldn't pose any further threat.

But Ryumin, who had already calculated everything in his mind, was skeptical.

"To reduce his stats to 0.0001%, or one millionth, I would have to kill him 122 more times."

But would his allies remain unharmed during those 122 kills?

Even if he kills Artharos immediately upon resurrection, he still needs to wait for 3 seconds due to the body reconstruction time.

In that gap, if Artharos memorizes the spell, he would have at least ten opportunities to cast the area-of-effect skill.

"So, there's only one way."

At the moment Ryumin came up with a way to block Artharos' spell, the second spell was completed.

"Perish. Wrath of the gods."

At the moment when light was about to emanate.

Thunk!

Ryumin kicked Artharos, pushing him more than 100 meters away.

Terrifyingly enough.

Kwaaaaah!

The Wrath of the Gods emanated with the force to melt all life forms within its range.

Fortunately, no players were within the range.

"I took that hit. Even though the body reconstruction was complete, I wondered why he didn't kill me. Turns out, he deliberately pushed me away to spare my life."

"..."
ChatGPT

"But you know there won't be any more chances. From now on, I'll cast spells during the time my body is being reconstructed."

Ryumin also understands.

Pushing is only possible once.

He can't block Artharos from using spells during the invincible time.

"Still, not killing him is not an option. If I don't kill him, he can approach my comrades without limit."

It's crucial to kill him as much as possible now and keep him away from his comrades.

Some restraint can be achieved.

While Artharos is restoring his body in the 3 seconds, he could memorize spells or move, so completely detaching is impossible.

"So, this is the only way to attack him."

Ryumin accurately slashed Artharos' eyes with the scythe.

He must have felt pain, but he didn't scream once.

"I can perceive all your movements even if you have no eyes. Obscuring my vision won't solve anything."

Artharos is undoubtedly a god.

He must have the divine attribute of clairvoyance.

"Even if you cut my wings or legs, it's useless. Levitating the body with telekinesis is not a difficult task."

Even if his limbs are cut, he can still move them with telekinetic power.

Cutting his tongue won't stop him since he doesn't cast spells orally.

The best option now is to kill him and buy some time.

"Soon, the third spell will be completed."

Artharos muttered while moving his body to approach his allies.

Sizzle!

He killed him as soon as invincibility ended, but Artharos, resurrecting with a relaxed expression, memorized the completed spell.

"Wrath of the gods."

The third area-of-effect skill erupted.

Unlike before, it was impossible to push him away since he cast it in an invincible state.

Boom!

Before the skill exploded, Ryumin had already thrown his body out of the range.

No matter how high his stats were, his defense wasn't that high, so if he got caught, he wouldn't survive either.

"Watch out!"

Before Ryumin could finish speaking, people were already distancing themselves from Artharos.

They were not fools; they knew they had to stay away from the angel.

But not everyone thought that way.

"Screaaaam!"

"Aaaah!"

Some couldn't react in time.
ChatGPT

Ten players who failed to escape the range were engulfed and perished in a dead-end, leaving their bodies.

"Damn it."

Since they died without leaving a body, they couldn't be resurrected.

Even though resurrecting them wouldn't be helpful, these were the people who had made it to round 20.

If it wasn't bitter, it would be a lie.

"How does it feel to watch your comrades die before your eyes?"

"Shut up!"

Ryumin's scythe slashed Artharos' neck.

The severed head quickly reattached itself, and the lips twitched.

"I'll give you one prophecy."

"I told you to shut up!"

"You will witness the death of all your comrades in this place."

Once again, a rare smile appeared on the falling face of Artharos.

"Black Scythe-nim..."

Minjuri looked at the Black Scythe engaged in a battle with the angel with worry.

In reality, it was an overwhelmingly one-sided situation.

The Black Scythe repeatedly overwhelmed the angel by cutting its neck with overwhelming force.

"But still, it feels unfavorable for us. There's nothing we can do."

Her own buffs became useless, which was somewhat understandable.

The problem was that the angel kept resurrecting indefinitely and occasionally used area-of-effect skills.

"Even though the Black Scythe is trying to kill it as much as possible to prevent it from using skills..."

During the 3 seconds when the angel resurrects, it reconfigures its body, moves somewhat, and closes the distance.

Players are trying to avoid being caught in the area-of-effect skills during that time, but there are limits to that as well.

'This white space isn't that wide. In the end, everyone will die.'

How can she help the Black Scythe? Should she continue avoiding area-of-effect skills helplessly while prolonging her life?

At that moment, an idea flashed through Minjuri's mind.
