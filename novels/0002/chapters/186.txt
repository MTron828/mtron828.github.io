Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 186"

Episode 186: Gambling Den

How can one quickly earn points?

It's not about completing numerous quests or going on a killing spree.

"The fastest shortcut is hitting it big in the gambling den."

The reason Ryumin collected points for 23 hours straight was precisely for this.

To wager his entire fortune in the gambling den.

Ryumin opened the progress window to check his points.

[Korean Team's Points: 12,775,330] [Black Scythe's Points: 103,020] [Time Remaining until Round End: 00:59:39]

"100,000 points isn't bad."

Earn 100,000 points just from quests?

"I know which quests offer the best value, so it's possible for me, but for most players, it's impossible without resorting to murder."

Of course, other assassins from countries that made it to the top 10 would have easily surpassed 100,000 points by slaughtering as much as possible, even up to 1,000 people, like Magyeongrok or Juseongtak.

"They probably killed over 500. In the previous round, the guys below me had 200,000 points."

While 200,000 points may seem incredibly high, it pales in comparison to what Ryumin plans to achieve at the gambling den â€“ up to 200 times.

That's the only way he can reach the top of the rankings and make his team the number one.

"With Cheonli-an, I have nothing to worry about. It's as good as already won."

There's no need to worry as long as he knows the location of the gambling den.

Having conducted dozens of rounds, he couldn't forget its location even if he tried.

"I should go before it's too late."

Ryumin took his first step.

Towards the gambling den for a last-minute turnaround.

When the message announcing the opening of the gambling den appeared, people eagerly tried to locate it with a glint in their eyes.

But finding the gambling den in this vast continent with only an hour left was like searching for a needle in a desert.

"Not revealing the location was a good call. If thousands gather at the one and only gambling den, that would be a problem in itself."
ChatGPT

Each had to find it on their own, but surprisingly, the location of the gambling den was in an unexpectedly easy place.

Creak-

An inn that could be considered the center of the Sacred Empire, which was at the heart of the continent.

Upon entering, Ryumin headed towards the kitchen warehouse.

"Hey, guest. What brings you into the kitchen?"

When the NPC, who seemed to be the owner, asked, Ryumin honestly replied, "I'm looking for the gambling den."

"Hmm. Now that I look closely, you're a warrior from another realm."

Glancing around, the owner cleared the rice sacks and opened the door on the floor.

Creak-

Looking down, a staircase leading to the underground was visible.

"Enter."

Descending the stairs revealed a dim secret passage.

It was a path that connected to the gambling den.

As Ryumin walked along the path, a message appeared along with the vast communal area.

[You have completed a sub-quest!] [Points +1,000]

Even those without points would receive 1,000 points if discovered.

"Try it once; I'm giving it to you as a one-time thing."

It was a trap set to lure people into gambling, starting for fun but leading to bankruptcy.

"If you're going to be happy about receiving points, you should turn around and leave right now."

Just stepping into it was enough for gambling to be a shortcut to ruin.

If it weren't for Cheonli-an, Ryumin wouldn't be in this position.

[Welcome to the Gambling Den!] [PK is prohibited in the gambling den. Inflicting harm on others won't cause any damage.] [Any interference with gambling will result in automatic expulsion.] [The door will close, and the game will begin at a certain time. Please wait quietly until then.] [Time remaining until the start of the event: 00:13:49]

As Ryumin read the messages, he surveyed the communal area.

Several people were already inside the gambling den.

All of them were players who luckily stumbled upon the gambling den.

"Well, luck can't be said to be good for everyone. If you lose everything and leave, there's nothing worse than that."

Looking around, he saw both Asians and Westerners.

Everyone was waiting for the game to begin.

"Oh? Isn't that person..."

"Isn't that Black Scythe?"

Before entering this place, Ryumin took off the Doppelganger's Ring and revealed the appearance of a Lost Yak.
ChatGPT

As a result, some Koreans recognized Black Scythe.

"With not much time left, there's no need to hide my identity."

If one wins a large sum in the gambling den, their identity is likely to be revealed when the results are tallied.

However, this also means that one can change their appearance.

There is nothing good about hiding one's identity.

"Everyone is silently watching each other."

As mentioned earlier, PK (Player Killing) is prohibited here.

Since they cannot inflict damage on each other, everyone is just watching each other.

"If it were a PK situation, they would have already started fighting to get gambling funds."

However, this doesn't mean that skills cannot be used. It's just that interfering with someone else's gambling is not allowed.

"I'm fortunate to be able to use Cheonli-an."

Fortunately, Cheonli-an doesn't interfere with gambling. Even using it to find the correct answer poses no problem. This fact has been verified through dozens of rounds.

[Time remaining until the start of the event: 00:00:00]

As time passed and reached exactly 0, the entrance to the communal area closed with a clang.

Now, no one could enter or leave.

Soon, a bright light descended from the communal area.

People's attention shifted to the angel who had just appeared.

"Hello? Future gamblers! I'm 'Gabi,' the guide for the gambling den. Nice to meet you!"

While the angel cheerfully smiled, the expressions of the people were not as bright.

Feeling desperate for points enough to turn their attention to gambling, many were anxious and uneasy.

"Oh, look at these eyes. They already look like seasoned gamblers, don't they? Well, it's okay. There are more than I expected, 59 people. Now, let me explain the rules right away."

Fluttering her wings, the angel produced two giant cards in midair.

"The game rules are simple. Here are red and black cards. After shuffling the cards, when I present one, you just need to guess its color. Easy, right?"

"So, we just guess the color?"

"Really simple."

"Like odd or even?"

Observing those who quickly understood the game, the angel continued.
ChatGPT

[There's a similar game in the human world, right? Odd or even, casino roulette, and such. Like those, the probability is 50-50. You can bet as many points as you want, and if you guess correctly, it doubles. However, if you're wrong, you lose everything without mercy.]

It was a relatively fair game.

Earth's gambling dens are designed with devices to favor the house.

[However, you can't try infinitely. You have six chances to participate in the game. If you win all six times, you'll earn an enormous amount of points, won't you?]

Assuming that you double your points every time you bet your entire fortune, 2x2x2x2x2x2 equals 64.

In other words, you could multiply your points by 64.

However, the probability of winning six times in a row is only 1.5%.

Did someone already finish the calculations?

One player raised their hand and spoke, "Angel! If we can only challenge six times, even if we get them all right, we can only win 64 times, right? The message clearly mentioned a maximum of 200 times."

[Yeah, I was just about to mention that. You're quite impatient, huh? Tsk!]

The sarcastic angel continued.

[What I mentioned earlier is the 'standard' method commonly used for betting. For those who want higher profits, you can choose the 'high-risk' method.]

"High-risk?"

"What's that?"

[Unlike regular betting where you wager the desired points, this method involves putting all the points you have. As a result, you have only one chance, and you must get all six games right to receive the prize. If you fail to guess correctly even once, you lose your entire fortune, and you'll permanently receive a debuff with a 50% stat reduction.]

"What... a permanent stat reduction?"

"And only one chance...?"

"If you fail, it's really a downfall?"

"The risk is too high, isn't it?"

[Instead, if you manage to win all six games in a row, you'll receive a prize not of 64 times but 200 times. It's a premium service for those who want to turn their lives around in one go.]

"200 times..."

"This is making my mouth water..."

While the prize seemed tempting, most people listened with one ear and let the information pass through the other.

It's only a 1.5% chance.

No one in their right mind would stake their entire fortune on a single opportunity with a 98.5% chance of failure.
ChatGPT

"Well, shall we start by choosing the method to attempt? Anyone willing to take on the high-risk method, please raise your hand now."

Upon the angel's words, the players didn't even flinch.

They simply inwardly ridiculed the angel for making an unreasonable proposal.

"Huh, a crazy angel. Who in their right mind would bet on the high-risk method?"

"Rather than dealing with a 1.5% probability, it's more efficient to go for a 50-50 chance of winning or losing."

"Even if I'm desperate for points, I don't have the confidence to break through that 1.5%."

Given the extremely unfavorable odds, no one dared to step forward.

No, two people raised their hands.

They were players from the almost certain-to-be-eliminated bottom-tier zone.

After all, if they couldn't achieve the 200 times, their team would disappear.

"I'll take the challenge."

"I'll challenge too."

"Only two? Isn't there anyone else?"

At that moment, one more person raised their hand.

It was none other than Ryumin.

"Isn't that person Black Scythe?"

"Is Black Scythe really going for the high-risk?"

"What's disappointing about not inviting danger?"

"Is he out of his mind?"

"We can hear you."

Even though he muttered softly to make it inaudible, Ryumin's ears, sharpened by the Sensation Rune, caught every word.

"I get it. I must seem insane. There's no need to willingly take risks."

But if you understand the power of Cheonli-an, you wouldn't say such things.

It's undoubtedly a question of why he wouldn't go for it when he could secure the 200 times.

After all, with Cheonli-an's ability, he could see the back of the cards.

"Guessing six times in a row is a piece of cake."

He was confident he would never make a mistake, so for him, it wasn't gambling.

No, for Ryumin, it couldn't even be considered gambling since it was money multiplication with a 100% success rate and no risk.

[We have three high-risk challengers! The remaining 56 will automatically follow the standard method. It's decided. Shall we start the game right away?]

When the angel gestured, transparent shields appeared around the players.

[These are devices to prevent interference from each other. Just in case someone tries to attack or use skills to disrupt others at a crucial moment.]

Since they couldn't move, they couldn't peek at the back of the cards to see their color.
ChatGPT

[First, let's start the game with those who have chosen the standard method. High-risk participants, please wait a moment. It won't take long. Now, let's begin the first game!]

Two giant cards shuffled in the air, and one card was revealed.

[What color will the next card be? After entering your betting points, choose either red or black.]

Players hesitated as they faced the emerging selection screen.

No matter how much they stared at the card, the color on the back remained invisible.

It was a game purely reliant on luck.

[Please make your selection within 1 minute. Have you all decided? Now, let's reveal it.]

The angel opened the card.

"Oh!"

"Nice! It's red!"

"Oh no! Damn it!"

"Sigh, I'm screwed..."

Amidst the mix of joy and cries, the second game began.

The game was quite fair.

The cards shuffled in the air in plain view, and without any tricks, they cleanly opened.

Since the back color was entirely invisible, players had no choice but to guess.

"Ah! Damn it all!"

"Whoa, it's the same as 'X'! 'X' you!"

Players who initially celebrated their wins ended up swearing like others later on.

In the end, just as the angel said, the game ended shortly.

All 56 players depleted their points after only five games.

[No need to go up to six rounds. Unfortunately, you all are eliminated after the fifth. It's regrettable, but there's no more chance for you.]

"Angel... Please, just one more chance..."

"Can you give me some points, Angel..."

As they continued to bet in hopes of recovering their losses, it eventually reached this point.

"Angel. I have a question."

[What is it?]

"There are still chances left. Is it not allowed to borrow points from others?"

"That's right. We still have our sixth chance."

"Please let us borrow some points!"

[How pathetic. Points cannot be transferred. Give up.]

The players bowed their heads deeply.

"Ah... it's over."

"If I knew it would end like this, I would have bet on the high-risk..."

Among those who reached zero points, there were also Koreans.

"What should we do if our team points are ambiguous?"

"If we continue like this, we might face extinction..."
ChatGPT

They were anxious, but none of them thought that Black Scythe would participate.

[Now, high-risk participants, get ready.]

Finally, Ryu Min's turn was approaching.
