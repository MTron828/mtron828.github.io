Title: Episode 282 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

Transaction

"Wow, it's been neatly fixed!"

Ryuwon exclaimed as he looked around the house upon returning.

The house, which had been a mess, was now as tidy as a new one.

It was hard to believe that he had fought with the Archangel in this place.

"Hotel life is nice, but there's nothing like the comfort of my own home!"

Ryumin said with a gentle smile, looking at his younger brother lounging on the sofa.

Even though he had lived for over a year, he still referred to it as his own home.

"Speaking of which, wasn't the hotel more comfortable?"

"Haha... Well, that's true. They served a delicious meal every morning."

"Wasn't it nice not having to eat delivery food?"

"Their rice was so tasty. Hyung, any trouble at home? Did the angel come back?"

"Don't even joke about that. Words have a way of coming true."

"Hehe... Sorry."

Seeing his younger brother apologizing with a scratch on his head, Ryumin also relaxed his expression.

"Let's have some food. Are you hungry? I found a YouTuber recently, tried cooking following their recipe, and it was really delicious. I'll make it quickly, so you just relax."

Watching his busy brother heading to the kitchen, Ryumin smiled.

Although his younger brother seemed immature on the surface, he was a family member who cared for him more than anyone else.

"Don't worry about an angel appearing, little brother. I've placed the protection of a hero on you, so there's no need to worry even if you're ambushed like last time."

He had vowed to protect his brother, so there was no need to worry about another surprise attack.

However, he couldn't be certain whether one would appear again.

"No, this time it won't happen. To deplete 90% of his power just to target my brother would be an unwise move. There's no guarantee of success either."

The last appearance was based on the real world setting of the 16th round.

Mikael wouldn't target his brother at the cost of enduring penalties.

"If he does plan to target, it would probably be in the 18th round."

Approaching him with various sweet words and deceptive tactics was likely, but he couldn't be dealt with through sheer strength.

"If he tries to trap me, that day will be his last."
ChatGPT

Just in the previous round, there were only seven participants in the 18th round, excluding himself.

Minjuri, Yamti, Victor, Alex, Dorothy, Magyeongrok, and Jusungtak.

"Among them, five died, and only Magyeongrok and Jusungtak survived."

Exactly how they died is unknown.

At that time, there was no interest in saving others.

There was no concern for the war situation or anything.

"I can only speculate that they died fighting demons."

But now, things are different.

A total of 286 people have survived, each with their own wishes, all looking forward to the 20th round.

"I can't save everyone. But at least I can bring more than 70 people."

Bringing 70 people to the final round?

It feels reassuring compared to the previous round where he was alone.

"Until then, no one will be lost. Everyone around, including Minjuri..."

Of course, he can't save everyone.

Just pulling the 70 who will be the final members is commendable enough.

Suddenly, Alex's plan came to mind.

"To prepare for the final round, he was planning to gather talents in advance and form an elite team."

Now that he thinks about it, it seems like he should do the same.

Wouldn't it be good for the future to individually take care of the key members?

"While I'm at it, I should act on it right away."

Ryumin called his acquaintances and scheduled meetings to avoid overlapping.

Since he had something to give personally, they decided to meet separately.

The first person he made plans with was Seo Arin, who lived nearby.

"Got it. Let's meet at the cafe in 30 minutes."

Ryumin, who spoke with a distorted voice imitating Lost Yak, ended the call.

He could meet right away, but he deliberately set the appointment for 30 minutes later.

The person he made plans to meet with Seo Arin was not the prophet but Black Scythe.

He didn't want to advertise that he lived nearby.

"I should make plans with others in a similar way."

Until the cooking was complete, Ryumin made several more calls.

Since he called using Lost Yak's phone and distorted his voice, everyone thought they were talking to Black Scythe.

"Hyung! The meal is ready!"

At his younger brother's call, Ryumin sat down at the dining table.

It was a refined meal, served with an eight-course banquet.
ChatGPT

"I made it following the recipe from YouTuber Yoon Teacher. Give it a try, hyung."

Ryumin scooped some soup with a spoon and tasted it.

Slurp-

"Wow."

Exclamations escaped him, and he couldn't help but move the spoon multiple times.

"How is it? Delicious?"

"It's the best."

Spicy and hot Hwangtae soup with crunchy cucumber slices and flavorful Jangjorim.

It was an impeccable table that made your thumbs automatically go up.

"I'm glad you enjoy it."

"You should eat too."

"Okay, hyung. But who were you talking to on the phone earlier?"

"You heard that?"

"Yeah. It was a call with Black Scythe's voice."

"I was just meeting some colleagues to pass on some information."

"Are you planning to go overseas?"

"No. Since they asked to come this way, there's no need to go. Instead, I'll be busy for a few days."

"Is Seo Arin also among your colleagues?"

"Yes, that's right. We agreed to meet later."

"Later? When?"

"In about 10 minutes."

Enough time after eating.

Ryumin patted his brother's shoulder, expressing that he enjoyed the meal, then changed into his going-out clothes.

"Arin noona will be surprised, won't she? Your height has grown enormously."

According to his brother, Ryumin's height was now 181 cm, 10% taller than the previous 165 cm.

It was all thanks to the rune's additional effect of predation.

"I was quite surprised when I returned from the 17th round and saw my taller brother, but imagine how surprised Arin noona will be."

"She won't be surprised. She's meeting me not as a prophet but as Black Scythe."

Saying that, Ryumin immediately put on his shoes and got ready to go out.

Originally, he should have changed his appearance with the Assassin's Mask, but since he might meet neighbors on the way, he decided to transform later.

"Take care, hyung!"

"Sure."

Creak - As he opened the door and was about to step outside, Ryumin couldn't help but immediately halt his steps.

Someone unexpected was standing right in front of him.

"Actor Seo?"

"Uh... Prophet-nim?"

Seo Arin looked up and down, surprised by his suddenly increased height.

Creak - Ryumin closed the door behind him and turned to face Seo Arin.

"What are you doing here?"

"Well, that's..."
ChatGPT

Whether it was due to the sudden question or the surprise of his increased height, Seo Arin seemed at a loss for words.

'Probably because of the height.'

Ryumin, who seemed to read his thoughts, smiled as if reassuring him not to be flustered.

"Are you surprised by the height increase? I was surprised too. I didn't expect the rune I accidentally obtained to have a function of increasing height..."

"It's an interesting feature."

"It's just like a side effect when you resurrect people. But anyway, were you waiting for me?"

"Oh, yes. That's right."

"Why?"

Seo Arin and the prophet hadn't made any plans to meet. Yet, she was waiting silently at the door?

Unable to comprehend, Ryumin immediately read Seo Arin's thoughts.

And he could figure out why she had waited for him.

'She might suspect that I'm Black Scythe.'

Doubts were turning into certainties in Seo Arin's mind the moment Ryumin stepped outside.

"Sorry, but can I ask you a question first?"

"Go ahead."

"Where are you going right now?"

"I'm going to meet someone."

"Who?"

"You seem suddenly uneasy; it's surprising."

"You don't look surprised at all."

"I'm pretending not to be."

"I'll ask you directly."

Seo Arin gathered courage and spoke.

"Are you Black Scythe?"

"...."

"Don't deny it. I heard it from Minjooju. She may not believe it, but my intuition can't be deceived..."

"I won't deny it."

Ryumin admitted readily.

"Okay. So, you're Black Scythe."

"Ah...."

Although she thought she could hold onto her denial, once Ryumin admitted it, Seo Arin couldn't find any more words.

"It might be awkward to discuss it in the hallway. Shall we go somewhere?"

"Well, sure. Let's go to my place. No one is home, so..."

As Seo Arin spoke, she led the way.

In fact, Ryumin had planned to suggest going to his own house.

But Seo Arin, either knowingly or unknowingly, guided him to her house.

'Even if I speak in front of my brother.'

To avoid unnecessary confusion, Ryumin followed Seo Arin up to the upper floor.

Click, click, click, click - Ding Dong!

"Pl-please come in. Black Scythe... I mean, Prophet-nim."

Opening the door wide, Seo Arin led Ryumin into the living room.
ChatGPT

As a penthouse with two floors, it definitely had a higher ceiling and a sense of openness compared to his own home.

"Here, please have a seat."

"Sure."

"Um... Prophet-nim is Black Scythe, right?"

Ryumin nodded silently.

Seo Arin looked somewhat bewildered as her assumption became a reality.

"About 30 minutes ago, you called me to meet at the cafe?"

"That's right."

"But the voice on the call and your current voice are quite different. How did that happen?"

Seeing her continuous questioning, it was clear she found it hard to believe.

"Do you need proof? If so, let me show you."

Ryumin changed his appearance with the Assassin's Mask.

Fluttering -

Although the height was similar, the skin turned ashen, and the face transformed.

Finally, Ryumin took out a white mask he had prepared and put it on, leaving Seo Arin speechless.

"This appearance is what people know as Black Scythe. You saw it at the Sasin Church yesterday, right? If you want, I can even show you the scythe."

"Oh, no. I believe you. More than enough..."

Seo Arin still couldn't close her mouth.

It seemed quite shocking to witness someone change their appearance so drastically in front of her.

After taking a deep breath, Seo Arin managed to speak.

"You saved me from fellow actors at the club before..."

"That was me."

"Black Scythe, may I ask why you revealed your identity to me?"

"There's no reason to hide it now. There's no need to reveal it either, but... I can't help it if there are suspicions."

"Then will you continue to lead a double life like this?"

"I have to. There's nothing to gain from my identity being known."

"Do you have anyone else you know, besides me, who knows about Black Scythe's identity?"

Ryumin hesitated for a moment, but it was just a moment.

Now that things had come to this, telling another lie would only complicate the situation.

Seo Arin didn't seem likely to keep the secret.

"Kristin and my younger brother found out relatively recently. Yumti and the idiots, Jeffrey, John Delgado, they've known since long ago."

"S-slaves?"

"You don't need to know the details. Just know it that way."

"Ah... Yes."

Seo Arin's answer erased all the lingering suspicions deep in her heart.
ChatGPT

The way he spoke and the atmosphere clearly indicated that she now knew Black Scythe.

"I never imagined that Prophet-nim was really Black Scythe... I couldn't have imagined it."

"You're not going to tell anyone, right?"

"Of course not. I'll keep the secret. Since Black Scythe doesn't want to reveal their identity..."

Ryumin smiled slyly.

"Thanks."

"By the way, the reason you wanted to meet me...?"

"Ah, I wanted to give you a gift."

"A gift?"

Ryumin used the trade function towards Seo Arin.

Seo Arin's eyes widened as she saw the trade window.
