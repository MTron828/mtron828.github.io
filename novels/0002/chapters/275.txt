Title: Episode 275 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

VS Michael

The heavens above heavens, the god of battles, the only hope, the top-ranked Archangel, and so on.

Michael, adorned with numerous titles, but none of them could satisfy him completely.

"Well, I'm just a pawn moving under the gods like a chess piece. In the aspect of receiving orders, there's no difference between me and my subordinates."

Even though his subordinates revered him as if he were the heavens themselves, Michael felt empty.

It was just their own league, well aware of the concept of being a frog in a well.

So, he might have been longing for something even more.

A once-in-a-lifetime achievement in the pursuit of becoming a god.

"But even that is ultimately pointless."

From the 7th-ranked Remiel to the 2nd-ranked Gabriel.

He sacrificed fellow Archangels without remorse, but he couldn't delay the inevitable.

"It seems my turn has finally come."

To kill with his own hands the black scythe that symbolized his fate.

To seize the opportunity of a lifetime with his own hands.

[Sigh...]

Michael felt overwhelmed to the point where a sigh escaped involuntarily.

His plan to survive with the black scythe until the 20th round and become a god was ending like this.

"Well, strictly speaking, it's not over yet."

However, it's as good as over.

The gods are watching from behind.

The goddess of revenge, Nemesis, and even a darker god are urging him to quickly bring the black scythe.

"Is it really impossible to delay it any longer?"

No more Archangels to send.

No more excuses to make.

If he can't hand over the black scythe to the demon lord Fluctuos before the start of the 18th round...

"Fluctuos will provide a pretext for manifesting, and eventually, I will lose in the upcoming Great Demon Lord battle."

Not only that, but he will also face the wrath of various gods, including Nemesis.

"Darn it, how did it come to this?"

Upon careful consideration, it all traced back to Gabriel.

"If you use the demon resurrection scroll I picked up during the last Great Demon Lord battle, you can turn the black scythe into an offering. We don't need to go out of our way. We can use another player with ill feelings towards him."

It was truly the worst decision to go along with his plan to somehow buy time.

"If I hadn't fallen for that guy's idea of using the demon resurrection scroll, things wouldn't have gotten this messed up..."

But regrets are always too late, no matter how fast they come.

The plan failed, and as a consequence, it angered Fluctuos and even involved the gods.

In a way, his decision played a significant role in creating this predicament.

"No, perhaps all of this is part of Fluctuos's plan..."

To dominate the Great Demon Lord battle, to secure a reason for his involvement, did he purposely let the demon resurrection scroll slip through?

Perhaps the angels were planning to seize that opportunity if other players used the item?

"Darn it! We fell for the devil's trap. How could we be so foolish?"

Even blaming himself while holding his head didn't change anything.

Now that it's come to this, there's only one way.

He has to submit and hand over the black scythe as Fluctuos demands.

Even if it means postponing the mission to become a god.

"I absolutely cannot lose in the Great Demon Lord battle. If I do, even my current position will become precarious."

He should anticipate the next steps, leaving the divine matters for later and addressing the immediate problem.

With such thoughts, Michael gazed at the black scythe from the otherworld.

A bead from the heavenly realm with a range of functions.

"To avoid chaos, it would be best to wait for the moment when he is alone..."

At that very moment, while waiting for the opportune time, it seemed the heavens assisted him, as the black scythe started moving on its own, leaving the barracks.

"Where is it going?"

Observing quietly, it headed towards the mercenary camp and even entered the warp gate to reach the dragon lair.

"Is he leaving the kingdom war to his comrades and planning to capture a dragon himself?"

Truly, the black scythe.

Despite being an insignificant human, admiration couldn't be withheld.

"Well, with that level of effort, it's no wonder he's in his current position."

But that's all there is to it.

While Michael doesn't possess the ability to foresee the future like Gabriel, he could understand up to this point.
ChatGPT

The black scythe will soon kneel before him.

"It's fortunate that it went into the lair. It has a 25% stat debuff as well."

Even without the debuff, subduing it would be easy, but he wanted to take advantage of the opportunity while the opponent was weakened.

After observing for a while, the right timing finally arrived.

Paat-

In an instant, Michael warped to the otherworld, unfolding his giant wings as he waited in the cave.

And finally, he could meet the black scythe.

"I've been waiting. Black Scythe."

The expression on the black scythe's face showed surprise at his appearance.

After all, did the inferior human expect an angel to appear?

Especially one with 20 wings?

But the surprised one was none other than himself.

"You're Michael."

"You know my name...?"

It wasn't just the name.

"The heavens above heavens, top-ranked Archangel."

Honestly, it was astonishing.

That a mere insect knew about him.

"You... obtained information by threatening my subordinates."

"Well, not exactly, but think what you want."

At first, he was surprised, but now he had a relaxed expression.

'Can even Archangels be this composed in front of me?'

The sight of the black scythe, who was trembling in fear before him, didn't sit well with Michael.

"Why? Is it uncomfortable for me to smile in front of someone as insignificant as a bug?"

[...]

"Relax your face. A petty bug like you can even smile in front of someone noble. Why be upset about it?"

Now subtly mocking, Michael couldn't help but let out a hollow laughter when he saw the black scythe.

[Ha... I always wondered what kind of being the Black Scythe is, but this is disappointing, a human below expectations.]

"Whether that's true or not, there's no reason for me to cater to the expectations of a lowly creature like you."

[...Now that I've met you in person, I understand how our top Archangels fell.]

'They probably succumbed to such petty provocations, got careless, and died.'

It was obvious even without looking.

The reason for such blatant provocation was clear.

'Unable to defeat with skill, so trying to take advantage of a moment of carelessness.'
ChatGPT

However, he is different from other Archangels.

He is not so amateurish as to fall for such low-level provocations.

Hasn't he already seen through the opponent's intentions?

"Seems arrogant like a human. Just because he received the system's selection, he thinks he's something..."

Wrong.

Until now, he was lucky enough to kill the Archangels.

But now that an opponent he cannot handle has appeared, there is no hope against him.

"Do you know why I appeared?"

"To kill me?"

"I won't kill you. Just subdue you."

"What's the point of subduing me?"

"Shouldn't you pay for the trouble you caused in the heavenly realm all this time?"

"Trouble? By what right do you..."

Still arrogant.

Puff- Now, not even a sigh comes out.

He just looks at him with pitiful eyes.

"I sacrificed my subordinates to protect such a worthless bug."

Now it's useless.

After fixing the black scythe's insolence this time, he will take it to the demon lord Fluctuos to appease his anger.

"There's a saying in the human world."

Tsuuuh-

A sword and shield appeared in Michael's hands.

"If you commit a crime, receiving punishment is the essence of the world."

"What are you babbling about? No need for long speeches. Come at me."

"The kid wants to sound cool with his lines..."

The black scythe made an unpleasant expression, but Michael didn't pay attention.

"All those actions were probably tricks to catch me off guard. And that's also a sign that he lacks confidence in his own abilities."

That's why there's no need to respond.

Just show your skills.

In a while, that arrogant expression and snout will change like a dog that got hit with a broom, Michael knew.

Whether he admits it or not, the black scythe was still paying attention to the lines.

"From now on, I'll be the one giving out punishment, so take it gracefully. Got it?"

"All this nonsense..."

Michael's gaze, responding with a chuckle, changed.

"If you won't come to me, I'll come to you."

Like the wind, his sword moved swiftly and cut the black scythe's shoulder.

Thud.

Without any chance to respond, looking at the black scythe who nonchalantly offered one arm, Michael smiled wryly.

"So trivial."
ChatGPT

Even though he thought he would be somewhat of a match, the opponent's skills were unmatched.

"Cut off the limbs neatly and take him away..."

In an instant, Michael turned his head without finishing his sentence.

His animalistic combat instincts spoke to him.

For some reason, his spine felt a chill.

He fluttered his wings to evade, but it seemed too late as the wings were already severed.

Thud-

[Grrr.]

12 wings were cleanly cut off.

Hastily turning his head, Michael couldn't see the black scythe.

"Where, where is he?"

Even though he tried to find him with a bewildered look, he was nowhere to be found.

No presence felt, and even the severed arm disappeared.

"Did I cut a clone?"

At that moment, a voice echoed in his ears.

"Disappointing."

As soon as he heard the sound, the sword was swung horizontally.

Lightning-fast reflexes.

But the sword didn't catch anything at the tip.

"The top-ranked Archangel can't even distinguish a clone."

Once again, the sound came from the same direction, and the sword was thrust forward.

A series of swift sword strikes.

But once again, there was nothing caught or seen.

It felt like dealing with a ghost.

"Moreover, can't see through invisibility."

[Where are you muttering so fatally!]

"Here."

When Michael turned his head abruptly, there was the black scythe.

The foolish human finally revealed himself.

To actually show up after all that talk.

Indeed, unparalleled in arrogance.

'It's your mistake.'

Michael used a technique he had prepared in advance.

'Light's Cleave.'

A technique that unleashes a barrage of light blades forward, a deadly skill that leaves nothing behind for anyone caught in it.

'Oh no...!'

He realized too late that it shouldn't be killed belatedly.

'Managed to kill the black scythe.'

Just in that moment, an unbelievable sight unfolded before Michael's eyes.

Clang-clang-clang-clang!

All 28 attacks infused with divine power were blocked.

'W-Blocked? And even deflecting each one with the scythe?'

He couldn't understand how such reflex speed was possible, but that wasn't the important thing now.

"Take this one sweetly."

The black scythe's kick, moving like a flash, struck Michael's abdomen.

Kwaaang-!
ChatGPT

[Kwong!]

For the first time in his life, Michael felt the sensation of his insides being turned upside down.

Thud-thud-thud-

Looking at Michael, stuck to the wall like a turtle, Ryu-min wore a disappointed expression.

"Is that really the top-ranked Archangel?"

Although he had heard words like "Heaven above the heavens" and "God of battle," he didn't expect him to be so pathetic.

"Just in case, I thought I'd try using a clone and assess his skills..."

There was no need for that.

With the stats he currently had, he could easily subdue the guy.

There was no need to use the death energy to apply a stat debuff.

"Weak, just like the other Archangels I've faced so far. No, am I strong?"

There was an angel he encountered since the 68th round.

An angel with an overwhelming strength just by looking at it.

Ryu-min thought that angel was Michael.

"But it wasn't."

The guy stuck to the wall was not the angel he saw back then.

Not only the presence but also the appearance was different.

"If it's not Michael, then who was the angel I saw back then?"

It wasn't a problem that had an easy answer even after contemplating.

However, he could make one inference.

"Could there be another angel above Michael?"

As curious as he was, asking wouldn't solve anything.

Ryu-min approached and pulled Michael, who was stuck to the wall, with a long staff.

However, Ryu-min couldn't get the answer he wanted.

"What the... Did he faint with just one hit?"

Michael was the only one who lost consciousness with a single blow.
