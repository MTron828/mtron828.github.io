Title: "Episode 204 of the 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player"

Results Calculation for Round 12

Thunk-

Debris fell from the half-collapsed cave walls.

Below them, Sariel, with his waist severed, lay.

'Looks like a corpse, but he's not dead yet.'

His remaining stamina is evident due to the seal of death placed on him.

It was a close call, though.

'I never thought it would end up like this with a single blow on the Moonlight Island.'

Having exchanged blows with Sariel a few times already, he had a grasp of his abilities.

'He may be stronger in strength and agility than Remiel, but that's about it.'

Being ranked 6th wasn't all that impressive.

Of course, the eerie scream he displayed at the end was unexpected.

'Judging by the ability to read thoughts, it seemed like a skill related to the soul... If it were someone else, they would have been helpless.'

Ryumin, with a 90.2% resistance to abnormal conditions, had no intention of falling victim to such ordinary tricks.

Especially since he had recently equipped two rings with a 40% resistance.

'I focused on increasing resistance in preparation for situations like this.'

Thinking he did well in raising his resistance, Ryumin approached Sariel.

Despite being practically a corpse, his ears were still open.

"You're called the Archangel of Death, but you really look dead."

[Groan...]

"For someone ranked 6th like you, using that noisy ability to climb up the ranks is disappointing."

Even in the midst of dying, Sariel glared at Ryumin with a resentful look.

[Kill me before...]

"But before that, I have something I want to ask."

[Do... do I seem like I want to talk?]

"Still, I'll ask. Are you Archangels the organizers of the survival game that kidnaps humans, or is it a system that operates on its own?"

[...]

"Who is the entity that created the system?"

[...]

"Why do you engage in such actions? What is your purpose?"

[...]

Although Sariel sealed his mouth in apparent defiance, there was no need for him to speak.

It was a question to read his thoughts.

Stupid human. Do you think a 6th-ranked individual like me would know such advanced information? Maybe if it were the 5th-ranked Raguel.
ChatGPT

Ryumin chuckled.

"Raguel? You mean he would know?"

Curious if there might be any helpful information, he tried reading his thoughts a bit more.

However, there was nothing useful since he already knew it.

At that moment, irregular breathing caught Ryumin's 60-meter radar network.

Turning his head, he saw the sorcerer looking in their direction with an excited gaze.

"Why is he staring at us like that?"

Feeling a desire-filled gaze, Ryumin approached to read his thoughts.

As he entered the 30-meter range, Jhon Delga's thoughts were transmitted.

If the Black Scythe kills that angel, I should try to make him a subordinate when the opportunity arises. It may or may not be possible.

Finally understanding his intentions, Ryumin couldn't help but admire it, albeit slightly.

"Come to think of it, there was a sorcerer in the party, right?"

A sorcerer could collect souls to manipulate undead spirits or raise bodies to fight like zombies.

"I wonder if angels can really collect souls. I'm curious."

Since the body was already in pieces, he probably intended to turn the spirit into an undead.

"Alright, let's see how this goes."

Smiling, Ryumin approached Sariel again.

He was still cursing into his mind, seemingly not giving up.

Killing me would be faster than hearing my answer, you pathetic human.

"Yeah, that was the plan."

"What?"

Thud!

He swung the scythe like a pickaxe, separating the head from the torso.

Instant death.

[You have defeated the 7th Archangel 'Sariel'!] [Stat Points +3,299] [Gold +32,990,100] [As a reward for killing the Archangel Sariel, 'Condensed Aether' has appeared.] [As a reward for killing the Archangel Sariel, 'Dark Rune' has appeared.] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!] [The reputation of the Demon Faction has slightly increased.]

└Defeat the 7 Archangels

└Current number of Archangels defeated (2/7)

└Upon success ▶ ?????

Killing an angel while under the Devil's Blessing brought tremendous rewards.

"More than I got from Remiel."

However, it was easier to deal with than Remiel.
ChatGPT

It seems like Ryumin has become significantly stronger after defeating Remiel.

"I've got new runes and god-tier materials this time."

With the arrival of Condensed Aether, visiting the Dwarves in Round 13 is confirmed since their help is needed to obtain other god-tier materials.

Before checking the information on the newly acquired rune, Ryumin subtly changed his position.

He moved away to give Jhon Delga a good spot to step forward.

"Let's see what kind of rune this is."

[Dark Rune]

Effect: Freely manipulate darkness to produce three effects. However, it cannot be used in well-lit spaces.

└ Emergency ▶ Dark wings form behind the back.

└ Barrier ▶ Create a barrier of darkness. It can block projectiles, hold them, and then deflect them.

└ Disperse ▶ Disperse darkness like a blade, allowing for attacks. It deals mixed damage, half physical and half magical.

"Oh, it's quite a useful rune."

Seeing the rune obtained from Sariel, Ryumin realized its versatility.

"You can fly, use it as a shield, throw it like a dagger for attacks—it's pretty versatile."

Now, he could freely manipulate darkness.

The only drawback was that it could only be used in dark places...

"But I have the Death Night skill, so I'm not worried as long as I can create artificial darkness."

This time, Ryumin distributed stat points.

Among the evenly distributed 3,299 stat points, the transformation into a death god was released.

Strength: 15,368, Intelligence: 16,088

Agility: 16,160, Luck: 16,960

Perhaps due to Minjury's buff, the effect was tremendous.

"It was even higher than this last time. But looking at it, Sariel was, after all, a holy-type Archangel."

As long as there is a title that doubles stats against holy types, angels won't be able to match Ryumin.

"Now, should I make a move?"

After finishing the stat distribution, Jhon Delga started moving in earnest.

The guy who had been quietly walking, keeping an eye on his surroundings, soon reached where Sariel was.

Then, urgently, he began chanting towards the corpse.

"Arise!"
ChatGPT

It seemed to be the command to make him a subordinate, as an immediate reaction occurred from the corpse.

Woooo-

A violet light surrounded the corpse as Sariel's soul appeared to be detaching from it.

Sariel's soul, expressionless, broke the chains binding it to the body and approached Jhon, kneeling down.

Although no words were spoken, it was evident at a glance.

Sariel's soul had successfully become subservient to the sorcerer.

"I-It worked! It worked!"

Jhon Delga couldn't contain his joy.

Ryumin was unaware of how close he had come.

"What worked?"

"Hup!"

Surprised, Jhon revealed the secret weapon he wanted to keep hidden.

"Kill him! Kill that guy!"

Commanding the undead Sariel, now turned into an ethereal form, with the Black Scythe, but naturally, it wouldn't listen.

Ryumin was an ally and couldn't be attacked.

"Looks like you forgot that the party hasn't disbanded yet."

"Ah..."

Ryumin mocked Jhon, who was flustered.

"Do you really want to kill me that badly? Even turning an angel into a subordinate? But is that even possible? Your main body can't even communicate with me and already died."

"..."

Of course, it was impossible.

However, for Jhon, it was a situation where he had to borrow the power of the angel.

It was already a challenging situation due to the penalties.

"Well, do as you please, whether you want to make an angel a subordinate or not. But do think carefully... if you want to keep the threadbare life you've barely managed to hold on to."

"..."

"Think carefully and make a judgment. Because next time, I won't show mercy."

Acting as if he didn't care, Ryumin turned away, but in reality, he was contemplating an interesting idea.

"I wonder, if you kill a summoned angelic being, would it count as killing an angel? Or not? If it does, using the sorcerer to easily stack the blessings of the devil would be possible."

Whether it worked or not, he wanted to confirm it immediately by killing Sariel. However, for now, the summoned creature was considered an ally.

If he wanted to test it, it would be better to do it when the round ended, and the party disbanded.

"Until then, let's keep him alive."
ChatGPT

Thanks to making the angel a subordinate, Jhon stood there with a blank expression, unaware that his life had been spared.

[Is everyone here?]

In the plain-colored space that served as the starting point, many people had gathered.

Ryumin's team had also moved here shortly after capturing the angel.

[Let's check how many teams are left. Oh, this is not good.]

The angel sighed, displeased.

[We started with 7,880 teams, but now only 2,389 teams remain.]

Most likely, many teams had perished due to a lack of tanks, mages, or supports, but the majority had probably died during the final trial.

The fifth trial, without a summoner, was an impossible challenge.

[Originally, if more than half survived, we were going to arrange the order by the speed of passing the trial and eliminate the rest. But it seems we fell short.]

The Achievement Team (TO) had 3,940, but 2,389 teams had passed, and 1,551 slots fell short.

As it was the first time a shortfall occurred, players were universally surprised.

[Since there's a shortfall, we'll consider all 2,389 teams as survivors. The total number of survivors is just under 10,000, 9,994 to be exact.]

Although the number of survivors wasn't a multiple of five, players quickly understood that there were very few teams where all five members survived.

It was expected since players could die from monsters or be voted out during the trial.

[Now, we'll calculate the individual rankings, and you can see the ranking criteria when you check the results. Shall we take a look?]

As the angel signaled with its wings, the result screen appeared.

★ Round 12 Results Compilation ★

[Integrated Zone CA-EA001]

└ 1st. Black Scythe (Lv91 Reaper) 200 kills

└ 2nd. Thousand Demons (Lv60 Dark Knight) 100 kills

└ 3rd. OldManNoGame (Lv60 Black Mage) 100 kills

[The individual ranking criteria were based on the number of monster kills!]

"What? The number of monster kills is the criteria?"

"Are they talking about the golems from the second and third trials?"

"Then, for supporters, it was an impossible round to get first place?"

"Ah! If only I had killed 10 more golems."
ChatGPT

The belatedly revealed ranking criteria elicited sighs from the players.

[By the way, in cases where the kill count is the same, preference was given to the human who achieved it first. Now, shall we proceed with the reward distribution?]

After a moment, a familiar message appeared before Ryumin's eyes.
