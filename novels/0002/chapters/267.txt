Title: Episode 267 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

Why didn't you say it?

[Purified Ether]

Classification: Possession

Description: Ether boasting the highest purity among all ethers. It can create items of God-grade or higher. It emits a dazzling light depending on the viewing angle.

The part that surprised Ryumin was none other than this.

"I can create items of God-grade or higher?"

Ryumin had always considered God-grade to be the highest tier.

"But there's something beyond God-grade?"

He couldn't believe it, and it was to the point where a bitter laugh escaped him.

Throughout the 99 regressions, he had been proud of knowing the strategy and information for every round.

"I didn't expect items I don't know about."

He had no idea how to combine them.

Trying various combinations might yield results, but there was no time for that.

"It would have been nice if there were blueprints or something."

It's a shame, but a gain is a gain.

He now knew about the existence of unknown items.

All because he had defeated a third-level Archangel.

"I wonder what I'll get if I defeat the first place?"

He was curious, but what mattered now was protecting his younger brother.

He would have to meet Huh Taeseok later.

To stack hero rune stacks like before, he needed Huh Taeseok's Devil Summoning skill.

When he went to the living room, Ryuwon gestured for him to come quickly.

"Hyung, is this really delicious? Try it."

"Really?"

Slurp, slurp.

"It's delicious."

While watching TV and eating, Ryuwon finished first and patted his stomach.

"Ah, I ate well."

Then, he looked at Ryumin and burst into a sly smile.

"Why are you smiling?"

"Haha, no reason. It's just unbelievable no matter how much I think about it. Our hyung has that famous Black Scythe..."

"If you can't believe it, should I show you the scythe?"

"No, I believe you, I believe you."

Even without revealing the eerie scythe, Ryuwon believed.

He had no choice but to believe.

After all, how could he not believe when he showed the overwhelming strength to slaughter the Archangels in front of him?

"I thought you were incredibly weak because you were called a prophet."

"That's a prejudice."
ChatGPT

"Yeah. I had prejudices."

The sight of his younger brother admitting it willingly seemed a bit unfamiliar. Could it be that some respect emerged after knowing about the Black Scythe?

"Now that I think about it, he seems a bit awkward. Despite pretending to be unaffected, he's tense inside, like a new recruit in the army."

"Wonah, relax."

"Huh? Did I seem... tense?"

"We're family, not strangers. Whether I'm the Black Scythe or a prophet, you're still my brother, unchanging."

As if telling him to relax, Ryumin smiled, and at his words, his brother finally relaxed his tense posture.

"Sorry. I got nervous without realizing it."

"By the way, didn't we agree not to bring up certain topics? If you're curious about something, just ask."

Waiting for this moment, Ryuwon slyly threw a question.

"Did you go overseas for something other than a girlfriend? To take care of some bad guys, perhaps?"

"Of course. Where do I have a girlfriend? Japanese? I've never even been near Japan."

"Then, was it just an excuse because it was too bothersome to explain?"

"That's right."

"Wow..."

The exploits of the Black Scythe are well-known to the public. From driving out IS in Nigeria, founding the CPF unit, correcting domestic security, to saving countries in need.

From Ryuwon's perspective, attributing all of these actions to having a Japanese girlfriend was shocking.

"You misunderstood first. Since I have to go abroad frequently, I thought it would be convenient to use it as an excuse."

"Then, what about the Prophet class? Is that also an excuse? Hyung, you're the only Death Messenger class, right?"

"How did you know my class is unique?"

"If you search on the player forums, everything comes up. There are even detailed posts summarizing all the missions that have been carried out so far."

Ryumin widened his eyes in surprise.

"Information exchange is more active than I thought among normal people."

It turns out that ordinary people were not completely ignorant about players.

"As far as I know, I haven't heard of anyone other than you having the Prophet class. Was that also a lie?"

After a moment of contemplation, Ryumin nodded without hesitation.

"Yeah. There's no such thing as a Prophet class."
ChatGPT

"Wow. So, predicting the future was all a lie?"

"That's right. We needed another profession to replace the Death Messenger."

"Then how did you guess the lottery numbers?"

"Well, that's..."

Unexpectedly, Ryumin found himself at a loss for words in an awkward situation.

Whether to disclose the most crucial information to his brother or not.

"Huh? Are you not going to say anything?"

He hesitated, but the dilemma didn't last long.

Since it had come to this, there should be no problem in telling him.

"Do you want to know the truth?"

"Yeah."

"It might be a bit shocking. Are you okay with that?"

"I can handle more shocks."

Ryuwon confidently replied with a chuckle, but soon his expression stiffened.

"I am a regressor."

"What?"

His brother heard a bombshell statement that he never expected.

"W-What did you say? A regressor?"

"You could say I came from the future. Well, technically, it's the past for me."

"What are you talking about? Regression? There's no way..."

"There's a rune called the Rune of Temporal Reversal. It allows me to regress a hundred times."

"..."

"With this, I've repeated countless rounds many times. There were many trial and error processes. I had no talent either."

Ryuwon listened to his brother's confession with a dumbfounded expression.

"When I die, I go back to 10 minutes before participating in the game. I kept repeating that. Killing the same monsters, breaking the same rounds, forming teams with the same people, and so on."

Ryumin's reflection on the past days silenced Ryuwon.

Until a little while ago, he thought it was a joke, but it wasn't.

Looking at his eyes, Ryuwon could tell.

His brother wasn't lying now; he was talking about memories.

"It was tough days. For someone like me without talent. Having a hundred lives was, in a way, an opportunity. Reaching Round 20 and escaping from this damn survival game was the chance I sought."

"..."

"Everything I've done so far was to conquer the rounds. A strategy for life achieved after various trial and error to find a more certain and efficient route. The result is the Black Scythe you see now."

"Ah..."
ChatGPT

Ryumin, who had been chuckling, placed his hand on his frozen brother's shoulder.

"Do you believe me?"

"Well, to some extent..."

"I'm sorry for not telling you earlier. But there was a reason I kept it hidden."

"A reason?"

"During one of the past regressions, there was an incident where you were kidnapped because you were the family of a regressor. I didn't tell you honestly because I was afraid it might happen again."

"Ah..."

Ryuwon understood.

His brother hid the fact that he was a regressor to protect him.

"Of course, I'm saying this now based on the judgment that it's safe. Actually, there's probably nothing more dangerous. The angels have started targeting you."

Upon hearing that, Ryuwon recalled the angel that had attacked him.

"Why are angels targeting me?"

"Because you're my only family. Unable to face me with strength, they're trying to ruthlessly use you as a hostage."

"..."

"Don't worry too much. Even if angels appear, I'll protect you."

"Well, it's reassuring if the Black Scythe is protecting me."

Ryuwon laughed while saying that, but deep down, he was still uneasy.

It couldn't be helped.

He was just an ordinary person.

"I understand, Wonah. But you really don't need to worry. I'll do whatever it takes to protect you. Even if it means sacrificing my life."

The reason he had struggled so hard for the strategy was not only for his own survival.

It was primarily to live happily with his brother.

"If I can live a life like before, there's nothing more to wish for."

To achieve that, securing his brother's safety is a priority.

"I should meet Huh Taeseok as soon as possible."

While thinking that, his brother muttered.

"A regressor like the ones you see in novels... knowing the future..."

"Don't be too shocked. In a world where people can be resurrected, what's algebra for a regressor?"

"Still, this is different. Not just once but a hundred opportunities? Even if you catch one year on average, that's a hundred years... Oh!"

Perhaps because he realized his age, Ryuwon suddenly stared at his brother like an old man.

"Hyung, honestly, tell me. How old are you?"

"Why are you asking my age? I'm 21."

"No! If you add up all the time you've spent, how old are you?"
ChatGPT

"It's been more than a hundred years. That's all I know."

Ryuwon's mouth fell open.

"W-What round is it now?"

"The 100th round. It's the final round."

"..."

"If I die this time, it's over for me. It means I won't have any more chances to change the future."

"Ah..."

At that moment, Ryumin's phone suddenly rang.

Looking at the caller ID, it was Seo Arin.

"Yes, actress."

-Prophet-nim. Are you okay? Your house is completely in chaos...

"I'm fine."

-And your brother?

"My brother is also safe. Don't worry."

"I'm relieved to hear that. What happened, though?"

In the call, Seo Arin's voice was filled with concern.

It seemed like she called not to gather information but out of genuine worry as a neighbor.

"I'm not sure either. Things were like this when I returned."

-So, where are you planning to stay now?

"I might stay at a hotel while I get things repaired."

"I was really surprised. After planning to visit the Prophet-nim's house, to see it like this... How shocked must you have been..."

"Haha, thank you for your concern."

-When the repairs are done, will you come back? Neighbor?

"Well, I guess so. It's not a cheap house, after all."

"I'm really glad you're not hurt. Let's talk again when you have a chance."

"Yes."

After ending the call, his brother asked, "Who was that?"

"Actress Seo Arin."

"I see. Seeing her worrying about you, she must not know your identity?"

"Of course, she doesn't. Where would I talk about such things? Besides, no one else knows except you."

Actually, Kristin knew, but he chose not to reveal it unnecessarily.

His brother didn't need to know.

"Why didn't you tell Seo Arin noona? She knows you're the Black Scythe."

"Well, it would be shocking for her."

"Can't she handle it like I did?"

"You didn't get shocked?"

"Haha..."

Did he remember himself being unable to close his mouth due to shock just a little while ago?

His brother scratched the back of his head with a perplexed expression.

"But I quickly accepted it. You explained the reason well."

"That's because you're family. Others might not understand."

"What if you try telling her? You never know."
ChatGPT

Ryumin shook his head nervously.

No matter how he thought about it, he was skeptical.

Would revealing his identity in the current situation bring any benefit?

It would be fortunate if it didn't turn into a detrimental move, breaking the relationship.

"But I can't hide it forever..."

It was a problem worth considering at least once.

At that moment, Ryumin's phone vibrated once again.

Seeing the caller ID, Ryumin widened his eyes in surprise, as if he found it unexpected.
