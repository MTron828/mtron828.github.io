Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 147"

"Boco Haram"

"Hehe, I wonder what fresh ladies have come in today?" Organization member Montai felt the happiest when going to receive items.

While there was the anticipation of meeting new faces every day, what he enjoyed most was the fact that he could plunder before anyone else.

"This is why I can't quit the organization. It perfectly suits my temperament."

The joy of choosing new women every day made him forget that he was a monster.

"By the way, it seems pretty urgent. The demanding gentleman is offering goods at a 20% discount."

"That's true. He must have taken a bullet to the head or something."

Well, whatever.

Before transporting the items, he could just choose the woman he wanted to plunder and bring her to the organization.

"Boss, we've arrived. Shall we get off?"

"Yeah."

His subordinate Samir, who came along as support, asked with a smile, "Are you going to take a break today too?"

"Of course. When have you seen me take a break?"

"He said there are three women and one man among the goods, right?"

"Yeah. Tie up the guy and let each of us choose a woman. Obviously, I go first, got it?"

"Of course. When have I ever not deferred to you?"

"Yeah, thanks, you brat. Hehe."

The two laughed slyly as they entered the human trafficking den, carrying automatic rifles.

"Huh? Where did everyone go? The guests arrived, but no one came out to greet them?"

"Don't they have a common gatekeeper or something?"

Did they all go to the bathroom or something?

Thinking nothing of it, they continued walking.

"Huh? What's that over there?"

They spotted someone standing in the middle of the area.

It was an Asian with olive-colored skin.

"What's up with that guy?"

Before they could ask, Ryumin summoned his blade.

In response, the two immediately aimed their automatic rifles at him, on high alert.

"He's that monkey player!"

"Darn it, no wonder it was so quiet... Did we get caught by that guy?"

There shouldn't be any Asians among the organization members.

It could only mean that the human trafficking den was in trouble.

"Kill him!"

"Tu-ta-ta-ta-tat!"

"Ta-ta-ta-ta-tat!"

With the sound that tore through their eardrums, the gun barrels spewed flames.

Ryumin, who was just receiving the hail of bullets without any response, fell to the ground.

"Darn it, what happened?"

"Is he taken care of?"

At that moment, a voice was heard from behind the two.

"Tsk tsk, what if I memorized the resurrection spell."

"…!"

Surprised, they turned their heads.

The Asian who had been shooting bullets just a moment ago stood there like a ghost.

And there was an Asian woman staring at them.

The organization member, who seemed like he was about to aim the gun immediately, instead lowered his arm.

"Is he under control?"

"Yes, Master."

"Good. It's rewarding to have captivated their attention."

The decoy that played the role of a bullet sponge had disappeared without a trace.

When Ryumin gestured, Yamti asked the organization members.

"Tell me about the things your organization does."

"Once the organs are extracted from men, the remaining shells are used for cannibalism. Women are rotated among eight members for rape, forced pregnancies, and selling the babies."

"S-stop talking!"

At Yamti's command, the organization members closed their mouths.

"Why are they like this?"

"I, I can't listen anymore."

Turning her head as if even hearing Yamti's commands made her nauseous, Ryumin gave Yamti an order to calm down for a moment.

"For now, use these guys to infiltrate the organization."

"Yes, understood. I apologize for interrupting on my own, Master."

"It's possible. I understand."

"T-thank you. I'm grateful to have met a generous Master like you. I'll obey for a lifetime."

"It's the least you can do."

Ryumin believed.

That by going up to find these organizations, they might reach the Islamic State (IS).

After all, these guys were likely offshoots of IS.

Medical facilities in northern Nigeria are poor.

The reality is that there aren't many doctors.

Having only 2 to 3 proper doctors every week says it all.

So, maybe that's why he, who hails from Lagos in southern Nigeria, has been captured and forced to play the role of a medical officer in the distant north.

Using emergency treatment skills, Victor Zapaile healed his wound and glanced at his opponent.

It was an ordinary organization member armed with a rifle.

As a player himself, he could kill the guy and escape. "But what comes after is the problem."

An organization that pledged allegiance to the Islamic State, Boko Haram. The headquarters of this organization, which spread like branches of a tree, is unknown.

Not only Victor but many others have been captured here, especially many children who attended school in the remote village of Jafaraju Kaya.

Although he didn't know why they were kidnapped, as a medical professional, it was difficult for him to abandon them and escape. He had developed a bond with them.

Then, why not kill all the organization members and escape together?

"I wish I could do that."

However, Boko Haram is not just comprised of civilians; there are as many players as civilians. He knows that there are at least 30 players guarding this area alone.

That's why Victor hasn't been able to escape so far.

"Hey, Victor. What are you thinking so deeply about?"

"Huh? Oh, nothing."

"Seeing you lost in thought, has life been comfortable lately? Because you're a doctor, do you think we treat you lightly? Is that it?"

"N-no, not at all."

Victor, who clapped his hands awkwardly with a troubled face, swallowed his curse inside.

"A worthless bastard…."

He had no choice.

Even considering only the players detected by his perception skill, there were five, and using the exploration skill, dozens of points were marked around.

Above all, as mentioned earlier, he can't just abandon the kidnapped children and people and escape alone.

"Take care, Dr. Victor. Now, even if you're not like before, anyone can receive emergency treatment from a player."

"…."

"Then you might be curious. If treatment is possible, what's the reason for keeping yourself alive? What could it be?"

"W-well…?"

"Whatever. It's because there's been some affection so far."

Victor almost burst out laughing.

"Affection? That's hilarious. These subhuman bastards."

For a long year, Victor, who had been captured by IS, knows what kind of mischief these guys are up to against the people they kidnap.

"Keeping them alive because of affection? They're talking nonsense. It's probably because of my abilities."

They know his class is an alchemist. It wasn't intentional, but he was caught using a healing potion to save a dying woman.

Since then, they've been digging into his runes, skills, and abilities, instructing him to make potions every day.

What they did with those potions is unknown. They might trade them in the black market or keep them in stock for their own use.

"Luckily, I can only make one potion a day, and the type is randomly generated. Otherwise, a large quantity of potions might have flooded the market."

So, it's all nonsense about affection. The reason they don't kill him is that he's an alchemist.

Can't you kill a goose that lays golden eggs?

"Anyway, take care. If you don't want to end up dead."

"Yes… I'll keep that in mind."

The organization member chuckled and left with his colleagues, sneering at a player who's treated like an ordinary person.

Victor sighed inwardly.

"Uncle, are you okay?"

"Oh, Ricky. How long have you been watching?"

"From the beginning."

Just as Victor found the kids adorable, the kids liked Victor. Ricky was the one who followed him the best, talking and playing with him all the time.

"Now I feel uneasy if I don't see Ricky around."

After Victor carefully looked around, he asked, "Is living here good for Ricky?"

"I don't think so. It's too dirty and boring here. The guys with guns are scary too."

As Victor listened to the words, he cautiously checked his surroundings. After confirming that there was no one in sight or detected by his perception skill, he spoke again.

"Then, if, I mean really if, I ask you to leave with me, would you follow?"

"Of course! I like Uncle. I'll go wherever Uncle goes!"
ChatGPT

"Sshh, we need to speak quietly. If someone hears, Uncle will get scolded again like before."

"Oh, I see. Shhh...."

Ricky's small hand covering his mouth made Victor smile.

But it was short-lived. Victor's expression hardened at Ricky's subsequent question.

"Uncle, are you going to leave here?"

"Huh? It's not necessarily...,"

"If you're going to leave, can't you take other kids with you? Everyone says they don't want to stay here."

"...."

"Huh? Why no answer? Can't we go together?"

Victor couldn't bring himself to answer.

"I wish I could do that. I wish I could..."

But he had no confidence to escape with the 10 kids here without being noticed.

"Hmm, escape. It sounds like a dream."

He was worrying about the reality of whether he would survive the next round, let alone thinking about escaping.

"In reality and in this otherworld, there's no shortage of hell."

He just wanted to go home. He wanted to return to his hometown, Lagos.

He thought of his parents and younger sister several times a day.

"Considering her age, my sister must have become a player. I wonder how she's doing. Did she survive well until the 9th round like me?"

As he was kidnapped before awakening, he had no news about her.

"If I at least knew her nickname, I could look for her in this otherworld."

Then, could he request help by saying, "Save me"?

Victor, who was thinking about it, burst into a self-deprecating laugh.

"As if asking for help in a place where I don't even know where it is."

In the current situation, salvation is a luxury.

After a year of struggling, anyone would say that.

Ding-ding-ding!

Suddenly, a bell rang in the open area.

It was the sound of summoning the kidnapped people.

"Let's go, Ricky."

"Okay!"

Victor and Ricky took their steps.

Many people were already gathered in the open area.

Ten kids, 15 adults, and the remaining 50 Boko Haram members.

Among those 50, 30 were players.

Victor was the only player on the adult side.

"I have no way to escape."

Victor, who had long given up on escaping, was simply curious about the reason for the gathering.

"Is everyone here?"
ChatGPT

Boko Haram's leader, Abu Bakar, scanned the audience with squinted eyes and then fixed his gaze on Victor.

"Victor."

"Yes..."

"You've been deceiving me all this time, haven't you?"

"Yes?"

Though inwardly embarrassed, Victor maintained a bewildered expression, trying not to show much.

"What are you talking about..."

"The potions you make. It's not random, is it? Moreover, the cooldown is shorter than 24 hours."

Silence meant agreement. To deceive the opponent, he had to say anything.

But Victor was so flustered that he seemed to forget that fact.

"Well, I don't understand what you're saying. I told the tru..."

"Did you think you were the only alchemist in this world?"

Silence.

"In the process of distributing potions, we found out there's another alchemist. Interrogating that person revealed that you've been deceiving us."

"How? I don't under..."

"How about that? You got caught properly, right? Seeing you unable to speak, it seems to be true."

Victor cursed silently. Why didn't he think that there might be another alchemist?

"I was arrogant. I thought I could cover it up with lies..."

But Victor didn't know. Everything was a test to see if he was lying or not.

He only realized this when he admitted it to himself.

"Why did you lie?"

"I'm sorry..."

"Hahaha, sorry? Hahaha!"

Both the boss and the organization members laughed heartily.

Victor finally understood the reason behind their laughter from the boss's words.

He had fallen for such a simple bait.

"Doctor, I thought you were smart just because you're a doctor, but you're not just a fool? Hahaha, to be caught in such a simple trap. Hahaha!"

Silence fell as Abu Bakar, who had been bursting with laughter, suddenly stopped.

The organization members also closed their mouths and became serious.

An ominous silence hung in the air.

"Victor."

"..."

"You dared to deceive me, huh? Haha, you must have enjoyed it all this time, ridiculing the stupid boss who fell for lies. Hahaha, fine. I admit it. I was foolish. But you know what?"
ChatGPT

Abu Bakar's fierce gaze turned towards the children.

"I can't stand those who deceive me."

In response to the boss's signal, one of the organization members grabbed and dragged Ricky.

"Why, why are you doing this! Let go of me!"

"Ricky!"

"Are you very close with this little one?"

Looking at Abu Bakar's sinister laughter, Victor felt extreme unease.

And in that short moment, he regretted not escaping when they had the chance.

"Why are you getting along with a kid? Is this some kind of daycare center?"

"No, please don't. I apologize for lying."

"No, I'm not asking for an apology."

Swish-

A dagger appeared in Abu Bakar's hand.

As a level 40 assassin player, he poised to throw the dagger.

"I'm here to make you pay for your mistakes. The little one's death will be your fault."

"Oh, sir!"

"S-stop...!"

The dagger left the owner's hand in an instant.

There was no way to stop it.

Even if Victor was a player, there was no way he could reach Ricky 20 meters away.

He thought he couldn't save her.

Ping!

Until someone deflected the dagger before it hit Ricky.

Swoosh-

Before Abu Bakar could react, someone appeared in front of Ricky, wielding a scythe and wearing a white mask.
