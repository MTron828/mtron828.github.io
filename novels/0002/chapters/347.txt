Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 347"

Episode 347: "The Full Story of the Incident (Part 2)"

[What did you say? You're making the Celestials and the Demons fight?] [Yeah. To entertain the bored gods, and to replenish my energy.] [Are you insane? Making my creations fight. Absolutely not.]

Despite Gaia's strong opposition, Chaos just chuckled.

[This isn't a request. It's an announcement.] [You can't do that. You must not.] [What can't I do? Those creatures will age, wither, and disappear anyway. I'll just speed up the process a bit.] [But still...] [Opposing is useless. As I mentioned earlier, it's just an announcement.]

Ignoring Gaia's objections, Chaos folded space and disappeared.

'Ugh... my children are like toys again...'

Although possessing the power of creation, Gaia's influence was less significant than expected.

The gods feared Chaos's ruthlessness more than Gaia.

'Is there really nothing I can do?'

Faced with the harsh reality of being unable to stop Chaos, Gaia lowered her head.

In the end, the Celestial-Demon War unfolded according to Chaos's plan.

To appease the boredom of the gods, Celestials and Demons pointed their swords at each other.

A bloody battlefield ensued.

Initially puzzled by Chaos's decision, the gods became more enthusiastic as the war began.

Like spectators watching gladiator matches in an arena.

[Yes! Kill! Kill more!] [Tear apart the heads of the Demons!] [Celestials, be strong! We have placed our bets on you!]

The gods placed bets on who would win, staking Terra energy.

The first round of the Celestial-Demon War ended with the victory of the Demons.

The roles were reversed, but the gods who bet on the Celestials anticipated the next war.

And 100 years later.

As the second round of the Celestial-Demon War began, flaws in the system became apparent.

The Celestials, who had suffered defeat once, were easily defeated this time.

[Damn it, the Demons won again, right?] [Instead of closing the gap, it widened even more.]

While the defeated Celestials spent 100 years recovering their forces, the Demons further strengthened theirs.

It was only natural, an expected outcome.

Since their gap didn't narrow, the outcome was obvious.

"Oh no. If we easily win like this, the meaning behind planning the war is lost, isn't it?"

To increase Chaos's energy, they had to clash in confusion with each other. If one side won unilaterally, not only would it be difficult to gain energy, but the war would also become unsustainable.

"This won't do. I need Gaia's help."

In the end, Chaos went to find Gaia and proposed the idea of using humans as mercenaries.

"Humans? But you said they're weak and hard to use?" "That's why we need to make them strong enough to participate as mercenaries." "Whether you do it or not, I'll oppose it anyway. Why are you coming to me to talk about it? Is it another announcement this time?" "No, it's a suggestion."

A suggestion, not an announcement.

Curious about this unusual statement, Gaia asked with a willingness to listen.

"What's the suggestion?" "Create a program to train humans as mercenaries. As you know, without the power of creation, I find it difficult to create a system." "A program? What specifically do you mean?" "Give the defeated race from the Celestial-Demon War the opportunity to train human mercenaries. It's to balance the war." "Do you think humans will blindly follow our orders?" "That's why we need to create a system with their lives at stake. It means they have to follow, or else they'll be in an environment where death is the only option." "You..."

Casually suggesting to use human lives as collateral, Chaos's words brought disdain to Gaia's face.

"Choose one of the countless dimensions in the universe, and put all the humans there into a survival program. Ah! Not all of them, just those aged 15 to 29." "So, you want to train a multitude of humans as mercenaries to use in the war?" "It won't be that many. From round 1 to round 20, only humans who have experienced hardships and adversity will be selected as mercenaries. The rest of the eliminated humans will be eliminated." "What did you say? Elimination?"

In essence, Chaos was announcing their intention to kill numerous humans, much like the previous announcement.
ChatGPT

[You're saying you'll put humans into a program to make them die? Are you out of your mind?] [I'm perfectly sane. Well, that's how confused humans will give me more energy. I've already finalized the plans for round-based chaos. It's deliberately confusing enough. Hehe.] [....]

Gaia realized belatedly.

Chaos didn't devise this plan simply to recruit mercenaries.

'He's determined to use even humans to gain greater energy, all to eventually stand against me...'

Naturally, Gaia couldn't approve of it.

However, seemingly aware of this, Chaos sneered.

[You probably won't like it, but if you don't do as I say, I'll continue to track down Chronos. So, choose. Whether you'll help with the system design I've conceived or not.] [....]

Now it became clear; it wasn't a suggestion but a threat.

[I'll think about it.] [You need to decide quickly. I'll kill you if Chronos is found in the meantime.]

Kururung-

The door to the Akashic Records opened.

The librarian, Luvahi, looked at the incoming figure and recoiled.

[Is it not Lady Gaia? What brings you here at this hour?] [Luvahi, my advisor. I've come because I have concerns.] [Is it again because of Lord Chaos?] [Have you read my records?]

Luvahi firmly nodded.

[No, Lady. Where would there be a librarian observing the privacy of the Creator? I'm not even looking. But you know, the location of Chronos.]

Gaia had already located Chronos.

The Akashic Records, created by her with all her might, made it possible.

At the moment, she was secretly hiding Chronos from Chaos.

[Chaos is still looking for Chronos.] [It's not surprising.] [But this time, he suggested that if I help, he'll stop searching.] [This time?]

Gaia laid bare the plan she had heard from Chaos just moments ago.

Luvahi, her creation and subordinate, was created to manage the Akashic Records.

Though others might be uncertain, Gaia could trust this sentient being.

[Hmm... Training humans as mercenaries during each Celestial-Demon War. Even from different dimensions....] [Countless humans will die. Given Chaos's design, that's still an understatement. What should we do?] [Hmm.]

Luvahi, Gaia's creation, her subordinate, and a brilliant advisor, contemplated the situation.
ChatGPT

However, this time, Gaia couldn't come up with a clear answer.

[I'm at a loss as well as to what should be done.] [Hm...] [Instead, how about seeking advice from another deity, not just me?] [Another deity?] [As you know, the Akashic Records are an extradimensional repository of information that collects records from all universes. Among those records is information about a deity known as the God of Massacre from a different dimension.] [God of Massacre?]

It was a deity that Gaia, too, was hearing about for the first time.

[How could that deity be of help?] [That deity was originally of human origin, they say. However, they rose to the position of an absolute ruler, swallowing the afterlife and dominating a dimension.] [How could a mere human...?]

Seeing Gaia's astonished expression, Luvahi made a comment.

[Try seeking advice from that deity. Although they are a deity from another dimension, since they were once human, they might help us. Chaos is currently devising a plan to exterminate humans. Perhaps this deity could step in and help handle Chaos directly.]

Luvahi's suggestion was reasonable.

If they sought help from a deity who was once human, there was a chance they might lend a hand.

[Alright. I'll give it a try.]

Following Luvahi's advice, Gaia went to meet the God of Massacre.

A dimension beyond dimensions.

And at the very edge of that dimension, Gaia could reach the location where the God of Massacre resided.

[According to the coordinates Luvahi provided, this should be the right place...]

Gaia wondered if she had arrived correctly.

A modern-style building stood within a park with beautiful rainbows, and in the distance, amusement rides could be seen.

At first glance, it resembled the human world, but this was undeniably the afterlife.

The souls resting throughout the park were evidence of that.

'The God of Massacre is here?'

As Gaia pondered this question, a woman appeared in front of her.

[Welcome to Paradise.] [Paradise...?] [A resting place in the afterlife, designed similar to the mortal realm. Commonly referred to as heaven.]

The woman spoke as Gaia looked around.
ChatGPT

[Oh, I apologize for not introducing myself. I'm Dana, in charge of overall management in the afterlife. Here, I'm referred to as a deity of the afterlife.] [Ah... I am.] [You are Gaia, right? The deity from another dimension, the Mother of Earth, and the Creator, known as the Primordial Goddess.]

Gaia looked at Dana with wide eyes.

To think she had grasped the information even before the introduction.

[The God of Massacre is waiting. Please follow me.]

With a bewildered expression, Gaia followed Dana and soon entered a residence.

'What is this place?'

Was it possible for the God of Massacre to be in an ordinary house, neither more nor less?

Just then, a person sitting on the sofa stood up.

[Nice to meet you. I am the God of Massacre, Min Do-Jun. By the way, Min Do-Jun is my name when I was human, but feel free to call me the God of Massacre.] [Yes, nice to meet you, God of Massacre. I am Gaia, the Primordial Goddess and the Creator.] [I know. However, the term Primordial Goddess sounds a bit arrogant.] [What?] [Shall I say you're like a frog in a well? As you know, there are numerous dimensions in the universe.] [...In my dimension, I am the Primordial Goddess.] [Then use that term only in your dimension. There's no need to mention it in front of me. In our dimension, the Primordial Deity is called 'El.' It no longer exists now.]

Dealing with a god who picked at things right from the start, and that too, against herself, Gaia felt that this was not going to be easy.

[Sit down.]

Nevertheless, the God of Massacre politely suggested she take a seat on the sofa.

[You came because you need my advice, right?] [How did you know?] [I delved into the thoughts of a sentient being called Luvahi. From the moment they peered into our dimension with something called the Akashic Records, I could perceive the presence and thoughts of that sentient being.]

Gaia, who had opened her eyes in surprise, felt a bit tense.

This god was no ordinary being.

'I shouldn't underestimate them just because they're human.'

[Sit.]

Still, the God of Massacre, maintaining courtesy, suggested she take a seat.

[You thought just now that underestimating a human would be unwise, right?] [....] [If you were surprised, I apologize. It has become a habit to read thoughts.]

Gaia felt as if she had been hit on the back of her head.

To think that even Chaos couldn't read her thoughts, but this god could.

The majesty of being the Primordial Goddess seemed pale in comparison.
ChatGPT

[Still, thanks to reading thoughts, we can get straight to the point, can't we? Let's think positively.] [You seem to know what I want.] [Of course, I know. You want to kill Chaos, right?] [Yes. My husband, Chaos, is trying to kill humans. Despite being called the God of Massacre, I hope you can handle it appropriately. Can you help?]

Min Do-Jun tilted his head slightly.

[To cut to the chase, it's impossible.] [What?] [Although my power is mighty, it is limited to my dimension. It cannot be used in your dimension.] [Ah...] [Therefore, direct intervention is impossible, but that doesn't mean there's no solution.]

When Gaia looked at Min Do-Jun with an attentive posture, he continued.

[Create a program to cultivate humans, as Chaos suggested. However, when designing the system, place items that can make specific individuals stronger. It's better to let them grow as intended by setting goals in a quest format.] [I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand what you're saying...] [In other words, intervene in the design to strengthen specific humans. It means secretly fostering a weapon to resist Chaos.] [A mere human can become a weapon to resist Chaos?]

Gaia was taken aback by the revelation.

The very existence of that ordinary human being was now a god ruling over a dimension, offering advice to her.

Min Do-Jun, who had been observing with cold eyes, relaxed his expression.
ChatGPT

[Just grant power for humans to evolve into divine beings. With your power of creation, you can certainly do that, right?] [Of course. But can defeating Chaos be possible by turning humans into divine beings?...] [It is possible. Especially if you use the power of Chronos that you have concealed.] [Chronos's power?] [The power of time is stronger than anything else. Even an ordinary human can become an extraordinary being through regression. Strong enough to massacre gods, for instance.] [Regression, you mean... turning back time?] [Exactly. If time is reversed, that human can be reborn as an excellent weapon to suppress Chaos. Of course, it shouldn't be turned into a divine being all at once; it should be grown gradually, so Chaos doesn't notice.] [Would that human listen to us and resist Chaos?] [They might resist, or they might not. Humans are both selfish and altruistic beings. It depends on the nature of the individual. Nonetheless, we have no choice. We have to keep trying until we find a human who can stand against a god.]

Gaia couldn't hide her uneasy expression even after Min Do-Jun's explanation.

She had doubts about whether the plan would work as intended.

[Don't worry. As long as you design it as I instruct, there shouldn't be any problems. So go ahead and get Chronos's cooperation, then come back.] [Chronos will surely cooperate without saying a word. The child holds a deeper grudge against Chaos than anyone else.] [Then the problem is almost solved. Once we create items infused with his power, even an ordinary human can transcend into a god. Hmm... an item that regresses about 100 times should be sufficient.] [100 times?] [Well, let me give you a detailed explanation now. How to turn a human into a weapon against Chaos.]

With a smile, Min Do-Jun continued with the detailed explanation.
