Title: Episode 256 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player

Start of Round 16

March 31, 2023, 23:50.

10 minutes before the start of Round 16.

576 players from around the world each stared at the remaining time with tense anticipation.

Most remained silent, but some engaged in small talk with their neighbors to ease the tension.

"I'm nervous."

"Me too."

"Do you think this round will proceed as Black Scythe predicted?"

"It probably will. Since joining the Cult of Reapers, everything they've said has been accurate."

From Round 13 until now.

Korean players who joined the Cult of Reapers received the benefit of hearing the strategy for the next round in advance.

Therefore, there was no worry.

No anxiety.

Except for the recently arrived foreign players.

"Excuse me. Can you speak English?"

When a chubby foreign believer approached, a Korean player nodded.

"Yes, I can speak English. You're the newcomer who joined after Round 15, right? Your nickname is..."

"Call me Alex."

"Nice to meet you, Alex. I'm known as Rice Bug. Do you have any questions?"

"I'm not sure, but... Does Black Scythe always reveal strategies like this every time?"

"Yes. We joined after Round 12, and since then, we've been consistently receiving strategies."

"Thanks to that, we've survived until now. Hehe."

"Did Alex also hear the strategy for Round 16?"

Alex nodded.

"Of course. That's why I'm here."

"But your expression doesn't look good. Are you worried?"

Alex answered honestly.

"Yes."

"Haha, don't worry. We felt the same way at first, thinking about what would happen if the strategy was wrong."

"But now, we just receive the information with gratitude. You'll be the same, hehe."

Although said with a reassuring expression, Alex still had an anxious look.

"Do you trust Black Scythe?"

To the sudden question, the players responded with laughter.

"If you can't trust, what can you do? You've already joined the Cult of Reapers, is there any turning back now?"

"Just relax and wait. After all, there's no way out from here, right?"

As the words made sense, Alex decided to let go of some of his anxiety.

"True. It was kind of a foolish question, now that I think about it. Thank you for your words."

"Don't mention it."

Alex turned around, looking at other believers of the Cult of Reapers.

While the existing believers had relaxed expressions, the newly joined ones were waiting anxiously with tension and unease.

Even though they had heard the strategy in advance about how things would unfold.

"Probably lacking trust in Black Scythe like me."

Joining with the expectation of a higher chance of survival with Black Scythe, but belief and that were separate.

Alex didn't completely trust Black Scythe either.

Other newcomers probably had the same thoughts.

"Just instinctively sticking to the stronger side for survival."

Does it make sense to have trust in someone you don't really know?

"The fact that you can get information for the next round as the 1st place reward doesn't make sense either. No, does anything make sense?"

Honestly, it was hard to believe.

Entering the Cult of Reapers meant receiving strategies, which he only learned after joining, and the ability to preemptively obtain information as a reward for 1st place was also something he learned for the first time.

"The only sure way to know is to try and get 1st place, but..."

Now is not the time to scrutinize things.

Time has passed unnoticed.

"There's one minute left until midnight!"

People waited for the remaining 1 minute with tense expressions.

They were more nervous than usual, perhaps because they were aware of what might happen next.

5, 4, 3...

2, 1...

As the phone's clock changed to April 1st, the consciousness of the players crossed over to another realm.

Soul transfer.

Although the technology to transcend dimensions would take just a moment, what players saw was not a vast meadow or a colorless space.

"Huh?"

"It's the same."

Their original space remained unchanged.

"We didn't move."

"Indeed, it happened just as Black Scythe said."
ChatGPT

Originally, the bodies should have transformed into avatars, and the surroundings should have changed completely.

However, the players were still in the real world.

No changes.

No avatars.

Their original bodies remained as they were.

The minds that should have departed to another realm were the same.

Bubbling—

Although the believers were initially puzzled by the unprecedented situation, they felt relieved.

Black Scythe's assurance that there wouldn't be any motion sickness this time turned out to be true.

Then it happened.

[Hoo hoo hoo. It seems like you're quite bewildered right now.]

A beautiful, melodic voice.

However, the actual nature of that voice, a disgustingly infinite angelic voice, echoed in the players' minds.

[Hello, everyone. All 576 players. Were you surprised by the sudden voice? Or were you more surprised because it's not another realm? Hmph.]

Just hearing the voice allowed them to envision what expression the angel might be making.

It must be like a fish caught on a fishing line, flapping its tail with excitement.

[You must have been surprised not to enter another realm as usual. Some may have hoped to escape from the survival game, right? But unfortunately, it's not over. You can't escape until you conquer the remaining 5 rounds. Hehe.]

As the mocking laughter resonated in their minds, people's expressions crumpled.

Without the angel in front of them, there was no need to manage their expressions like before.

"Damn angel bastard."

Some didn't hesitate to curse.

Ignoring the curses, the angel continued.

[Shall we first check the mission for Round 16?]

As the words ended, a window appeared in everyone's eyes.

◀ ROUND 16 ▶

└ Exterminate monsters summoned to the human world within 3 hours

[Unified Zone CA-EA001]

└ Participants: 576

└ Achievers: 0/288

Usually, quests tended to cause confusion, but the players remained calm.

They had already received instructions from Black Scythe.

Unaware of this, the angel was busy amusing itself.

[Were you surprised? Hehe, this round is a special one taking place in the human world. The reason your minds are on Earth, not another realm. Different, isn't it?]

"Ridiculous."
ChatGPT

"Of course, since it's not another realm, there are no avatars. Instead of a body stylishly customized, you have to prevent monsters summoned to Earth with that pathetic body. But don't worry. It's just the appearance that's different; you can still use your abilities the same way."

"That crazy angel bastard."

Some confidently cursed, expecting the angel to have appeared by now.

Assuming they couldn't be heard.

Contrary to expectations, the angel indeed seemed not to hear.

"As this round takes place in the human world, I'll explain it through voice only."

The angel, saying so, continued with a detailed explanation.

"As you can see, the main quest is to exterminate monsters summoned to Earth within the limited time of 3 hours. Uniquely, it's the only round set on Earth instead of another realm, and the only mission where you can participate without experiencing motion sickness, alongside ordinary people. How great is that? Hehe."

People grumbled inwardly, each with a bubbling face.

"This is ridiculous."

"As it's a joint mission, all 576 players are applied as a party. Monsters will be summoned every 30 minutes after the first summon, for a total of 6 rounds. Also..."

The rules that followed were not much different from what they had heard before.

Monsters getting stronger with each wave.

The number of monsters appearing proportionate to the player count, and so on.

However, there was one difference from what they had experienced so far.

It was the method of summoning monsters.

"Monsters will be randomly summoned within a 100m radius of the player's location. In other words, the player's location is practically the monster's spawn point."

"Our location is the spawn point?"

"Just as Black Scythe mentioned."

"So, how to find the monsters won't be a concern. If you look around within a 100m radius, you'll see them."

What if the players were scattered?

It meant monsters would appear all over the world.

"Oh, by the way, monsters harbor strong hostility towards humans. It means they'll charge at anyone, be it a civilian or a player."

Laughter echoed in the angel's voice.

It was a voice that was certain humans would be bewildered.

"So, this round might be a bit busy for you all. It's to avoid sacrificing other civilians, isn't it? Hehe."

The angel's words proved to be true.
ChatGPT

If monsters are generated within a 100m radius of players, civilians may also suffer damage.

Monsters summoned to the city could slaughter people other than players.

"Now, let's start the mission shortly. Good luck to you all. Hehe."

Despite the mocking laughter, the departing angel did not evoke any worry on the faces of the players. Rather, they seemed to be smiling with relief.

This was because within a 100m radius, there was no one but themselves.

The place they were standing at now was an isolated island where no ordinary people were visible.

"Phew, thank goodness."

"It was a good decision to enter the island as Black Scythe suggested."

"People could have been in danger."

Voices of relief echoed from various places, and among them was Ryu Min, wearing a mask.

"With this, my younger brother won't be in danger."

If he had been lying on his bed as usual, the entire city would have been thrown into chaos due to monsters summoned around.

"But starting on this isolated island, we won't suffer any damage at all."

What if players from all over the world were summoned to an isolated island?

There would be no harm to civilians.

There would be no danger to the family, friends, and neighbors they cared about.

That's why the gathered players were feeling relieved.

"It's fortunate. But we can't be completely at ease."

There was still something Ryu Min hadn't told the other believers.

"This round, not only monsters but combat angels will also appear."
