Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 187"

Results Aggregation for Round 11

"Darn it! Chikushooooo!!!"

Only the Japanese player, Uetsuhako Manichi, shouted like a storm.

Having succeeded in three consecutive reds, he bet on black in the fourth game.

Honestly, he thought it was about time for black to show up after three consecutive reds.

However, red exploded four times in a row, and he not only lost all the points gained but also went below the break-even point.

"Why am I so obsessed with red! Darn it! I need to find the break-even, the break-even!"

Eventually, in the fifth game, Manichi, who had put his entire fortune on the line, bet on black again.

Honestly, what are the chances of getting five consecutive reds?

But it actually happened.

"Chikusho! Obsessed with red! Obsessed, obsessed!!!"

He screamed while tearing at his own hair.

Although he had confidence from playing Pachinko since childhood, he never thought it would turn out like this.

Overwhelmed by self-disgust, he felt like he wanted to commit suicide right there.

"It's over, darn it... It's over."

The only comfort was that there were not just a few losers like him.

"Still, it's fortunate. Even if it becomes 0 points, there's no worry of extinction."

In the point calculation results for each area that came to mind three hours ago, Manichi's Japanese team ranked 10th.

Even if things go bad, they won't fall below 95th place.

There was no worry about extinction, but that didn't improve his mood.

Regardless of what anyone said, the feeling of losing all points in 23 hours was indescribable.

"I want to go home quickly."

He wanted to return and sleep deeply, but the game was not over yet.

[Now, for the next High-Risk, everyone, get ready.]

Three people who chose the High-Risk mode were left.

Honestly, it was a game with nothing to see.

"Foolish people. Betting their lives on a 1.5% probability. They must be quite the losers."

Presumably, the teams at the very bottom, facing the risk of extinction if they can't win 200 times, challenged in the High-Risk mode.
ChatGPT

"As long as you are in your right mind, no one would think they'll win with a 1.5% probability.

[For those who chose High-Risk, you automatically go all-in with your points and must correctly guess a total of six consecutive games. Now, let's shuffle the cards.]

Two cards were quickly shuffled, and one was revealed.

[Please choose the color of the card you see now within 1 minute.]

Perhaps because it was the first game, the three people were extremely cautious.

Well, Manichi had already made his choice as soon as the black scythe appeared, but the other two hadn't.

Their fate rested on whether it would be annihilation or not.

"Since it's something I can't really judge, hurry up and choose. Tsk."

While Manichi was grumbling, the one minute mark was reached.

[Have you made your choice? Hoho, fate has been decided from the first game. Two people chose red, and one person chose black. Who will be eliminated? Drumroll…!]

Alone in finding this situation enjoyable, the angel opened the cards with a smile.

[Ta-da! The first correct answer was black.]

"Gasp...!"

"Aaaah...!"

The two who chose red were eliminated from the first game.

Manichi sneered at the bewildered guys sitting on the despair-ridden floor.

"Fools. What were you expecting? Anyway, the probability of succeeding six times in a row is practically impossible."

They'll be eliminated a bit earlier than others who will be eliminated later.

It's mentally easier to think that way.

"Perhaps that guy who got the correct answer is going to whine and cry soon."

Tsk tsk. Manichi, unaware that his opponent was the infamous black scythe, eagerly awaited the end of the game.

He thought he might get eliminated as early as the second round.

But contrary to expectations, the situation took a different turn.

[The second correct answer is also red. Oh, you've managed to get it right again this time! Now, only four more correct guesses to go. Hehe!] [The third correct answer is black. Wow, incredible luck. Three consecutive correct guesses! Now, you're halfway there! Stay strong. Chuckle.]

The man left alone correctly guessed three in a row.

It wasn't that surprising.

After all, Manichi also got three consecutive correct guesses.

"Hmph, lucky guy. But let's see how long that luck lasts."
ChatGPT

Halfway there, but now it's the crucial part.

The probability of winning consecutively will decrease as we go on.

However, such thoughts changed after seeing the results of the fourth round.

[The fourth correct answer is red. Haha, you got this one right. If it were standard, you would have earned 16 times, right?]

Even Manichi couldn't help but be surprised after getting four in a row.

When he turned his head, he noticed that the expressions of the others were not much different.

It wasn't just the surprise of getting four in a row.

"That guy... How can he be so calm?"

He selected the correct answers with a more composed face than anyone else.

And he did it swiftly, without a moment of hesitation.

"It's like he already knows the answers."

Certainly, he was an extraordinary individual.

Even after getting four in a row, there was no sign of satisfaction.

He just calmly chose the correct answers.

"His facial expression doesn't change much. Maybe he's good at poker?"

Even Korean players, who didn't have high expectations, were impressed by the black scythe's performance.

"Black Scythe got four in a row."

"If he gets two more right, it's 200 times, right?"

"Who knows, Black Scythe might hit the jackpot?"

"Then our country can survive as the safe zone!"

With people's attention focused, the fifth game began.

Ryumin, once again, chose a color without any hesitation.

[Now, have you already chosen which color of card...? Haha, if you choose without thinking like that, you might get wiped out in one shot. Now let's reveal the ans... ]

The angel's expression, who had correctly guessed the answer, changed to a look of astonishment.

[...The answer was black. You got it right again this time.]

"Wow! Amazing!"

"He got it right again?"

"Is this for real?"

Players cheered in response to the disheartened angel's words.

They were so immersed in the black scythe's performance and found satisfaction in it.

After all, they were running in areas where they couldn't succeed.

"Now, just one more correct guess!"

"The probability is 50%!"

"If he gets it right this time, it's 200 times!"

"Go, Black Scythe!"

People trapped behind the transparent barrier cheered for the black scythe in their own languages.
ChatGPT

Some even cursed silently out of jealousy, saying, "There are humans who can't stand seeing others succeed."

Ryumin chuckled and proceeded with the final choice.

Contrary to their curses, Lady Luck was on his side.

[The sixth choice is now over. Now, let's see the results...!]

Players were more nervous than the person involved, given the tension in the angel's expression.

Even the angel, unaware of the card results until they were revealed, secretly hoped for a favorable outcome.

But contrary to expectations.

[Ah. Hahaha.]

Ryumin's plan proceeded without a hitch.

[The sixth correct answer was black. Congratulations. You've won the High-Risk game with six consecutive wins.]

"Wowww!"

Thunderous cheers echoed throughout the venue.

Thunk!

"Ugh!"

An arrow flew precisely into the player's forehead.

Yang Chawen, who swiftly cut off the opponent's breath, approached with a sinister smile.

He pulled the arrow from the slumped opponent and licked the blood on the arrowhead.

"Even if it's an avatar created in another realm, the taste of blood is the same as in reality."

As the top-ranked member of the underworld society, he immediately began killing people as soon as Round 11 began.

There was no reason not to kill players since points were earned by doing so.

"How many have I killed so far?"

In response to Yang Chawen's question, Jang So-wi, who stood beside him and ranked 2nd, answered confidently.

"Exactly 552 people."

"How much time is left until the end of the round?"

"One minute remaining."

"Hoho, you've used your time quite efficiently."

Yang Chawen looked at the progress window.

[Points earned by the Chinese team: 30,621,490] [Points earned by Yang Chawen: 220,840] [Time remaining until the end of the round: 00:00:54]

Seeing the team's points reaching nearly 30 million, he couldn't help but smile.

'As expected, our area will be in first place.'

Even four hours ago, his area was in first place according to the calculation results.

There was no possibility of lower-ranking teams climbing up in a short time.

Because he worked even harder to kill humans in the final sprint than before.

Thanks to the team's concerted effort in hunting humans for 24 hours, they achieved the accomplishment of being the top-ranked team.
ChatGPT

'Not only for the team but also for individual rankings, I'll be in first place.'

He truly spared no effort, killing humans every minute and second.

Because the points were earned through such bloody efforts, he had no doubt that he was in first place.

"Jang So-wi."

"Yes, boss."

"How many points do you have?"

"Approximately 160,000 points."

"Not much. But don't worry. It's obvious that our China is in first place."

"I'm not worried. Congratulations in advance."

"Congratulations?"

"Being in first place individually is essentially the same as being the boss, isn't it?"

"Whether it is or not."

"I've heard that the rewards are better from this round on. Congratulations."

"Congratulations again. It's just the usual area ranking 1st. It's getting boring now."

He said so, but the smile on Yang Chawen's lips didn't fade.

'It's exciting. I wonder what the reward for first place in this round will be. I can buy something from the special shop that's now open.'

Since the areas were unified into one, winning first place this time was practically the same as being first place in the entire region. Knowing this fact, Jang So-wi subtly brought up the topic of the black scythe.

"Even if it's the black scythe, this time, you should give up the first place."

"Whatever. Of course. Even if that guy kills hundreds of people in 24 hours, he won't have more points than me, right?"

"Of course not."

"The first time in history that the black scythe will lose the record for 1st place. It's all because of me, Yang Chawen."

While Yang Chawen boasted, the smile on his face never left.

[The time limit has expired.] [Moving to the neutral zone.]

With the expiration of the time limit, people moved to the colorless space.

[Hoho, is it because of the mood that the number of people seems to have decreased compared to the beginning?]

As if she had been waiting, the angel appeared and looked around at the gathered people before speaking.

[The initial number was 130,000, but now it has decreased to 80,000? Did you kill each other to earn points?]

The question, delivered with a swirling laugh, was posed as if she already knew everything.
ChatGPT

[Well, whatever. The number of participants doesn't matter since we're surviving in order of team points. Shall we check the tally results to see which team survived?]

'No need to look; we are definitely in 1st place.'

Yang Chawen, who smirked, looked at the emerging results window and flashed the smile of a winner.

No, it was when he was about to lift the corners of his mouth for that reason.

★ Round 11 Tally Results ★

'What? 2nd place?'

At the news that his team was not in 1st place but 2nd place, Yang Chawen's expression hardened.

'And what's this? 1st place is... Korea?'

A country that hadn't even been visible in the top 10 suddenly had its name at the top.

'Absurd. They gathered enough points to surpass our area in just 4 hours?'

It was unbelievable, but compared to the results window that would emerge shortly after, this was nothing.

[What I just checked is the team performance, would you like to see individual performance this time?]

As the angel fluttered her wings, a new tally window appeared.

1st Place: Black Scythe (Level 90 Reaper) - Points: 20,804,000

………………

"This, this can't be."

Yang Chawen's mouth hung open in shock at the staggering results, with the gap between 1st and 2nd place approaching nearly 100 times.
