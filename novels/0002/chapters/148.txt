Title: Episode 148 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max-Level Player

Abu Bakr

Boko Haram's leader, Abu Bakr, blinked his eyes several times.

He wondered if he was seeing a ghost.

"Where the hell did that guy come from? I couldn't even detect his presence."

Considering his sudden appearance, it seemed like some kind of invisibility, but he couldn't read it through his detection skills.

"You, what the hell are you...?"

Abu Bakr, who was about to shout, quickly shut his mouth.

The stranger swiftly sliced the throat of the organization member who had unexpectedly grabbed the child named Ricky.

Cleanly, without a drop of blood.

Afterward, he calmly handed the child over to Victor.

In contrast, Abu Bakr couldn't afford to be calm.

He was so tense that sweat beads formed on his forehead.

It was because he belatedly noticed that the weapon of the man with a white mask was a scythe.

"If a player uses a scythe as a weapon..."

There was almost a synonymous existence that came to mind.

"The Black Reaper?"

Unknown nationality, always ranked first worldwide.

Regardless of the country, he was a monster among players.

"Could it be the Black Reaper?"

Although his nickname was Reaper, and he claimed to be a Reaper as his profession, there was no guarantee that he always used a scythe.

It was just speculation.

"No, even so, that movement..."

It was not ordinary skill.

He wanted to confirm it once again.

When a corpse appeared, Abu Bakr, who raised his hand, looked at Victor, who was trying to cover the children's eyes.

Tsueeuueut-

The dagger that had left his hand returned to its owner's grip.

The assassin's skill, [Dagger Throw], was instantly reloaded.

Swish-!

The dagger, flying at a speed almost comparable to a bullet, precisely aimed for the child's head.

However, the white-masked reaper once again blocked the dagger.

Ping-!

This time, he clearly saw it.

"It wasn't a coincidence?"

He pierced the trajectory of the flying dagger, precisely raised the scythe to block it?

As expected, he wasn't an ordinary skilled player.
ChatGPT

"He blocked my attacks twice. He's not an ordinary guy, huh? But even though I don't know where he came from, you picked the wrong opponent."

He blocked the thrown dagger aimed at the children twice.

With that, it became certain.

He couldn't be defeated.

Fighting while protecting someone, as in movies, was impossible here as well.

"It seems like you wanted to imitate the Lion of Justice... but reality is different."

With just one command from him, all his subordinates here would start shooting towards the hostages.

How could he alone stop the hail of bullets?

"If you can protect the children, go ahead and try."

As he devilishly smiled, preparing to command his subordinates, Abu Bakr's eyebrows twitched.

Swoosh-

As if the opponent deliberately concealed his presence.

"What? Didn't he use invisibility a moment ago?"

There should be a cooldown, and he was using it again?

Moreover, what surprised Abu Bakr was that after using invisibility, he disappeared from detection skills.

"Amazing. But even so, I can't let him stop the command..."

Abu Bakr couldn't continue his thoughts.

Thunk-!

A tremendous force struck the back of his head.

"Ugh..."

It seemed like his front teeth and nasal bone were shattered.

"Boss!"

The white-masked figure, who appeared from behind after using invisibility, applied force to the hand grabbing Abu Bakr's back of the head.

"Ughhh..."

His mouth was filled with dirt, making it impossible for him to say anything.

Even if he wanted to give orders, he was in a state where he couldn't.

However, seeing their boss being attacked didn't make the subordinates stay still.

"That bastard!"

"Save the boss!"

30 players rushed with their various weapons, determined to kill the white-masked figure.

The rest of the ordinary organization members aimed their guns but hesitated.

They knew a wrong move might create holes even in their boss.

But what they didn't know was that the man pressing down their boss inside the mask was smiling.

"W-What's happening..."

Victor couldn't close his mouth.

Realizing that the children were targeted because of him had left his heart pounding.

When the dagger flew towards Ricky, everything went dark in front of his eyes.
ChatGPT

However, like a miracle, the savior in a white mask appeared suddenly.

The moment he blocked the dagger, it was surprising, but more than anything, Victor felt relieved that the child's life could be spared.

However, what was even more astonishing now was, 'He's facing all those numbers alone...'

No, it couldn't be called a confrontation. It was too one-sided to be considered a struggle.

Players were rushing towards the scythe like moths to a flame, and it seemed as if they were being cut down.

It was such a one-sided and overwhelming scene that the number thirty seemed insufficient.

Everyone present, including the kidnapped individuals and the armed organization members, froze in horror as they witnessed the massacre.

Except for Victor.

"You guys! Turn your heads away quickly! It's not something you should be watching!"

"Oh, why not? I want to see too."

"Hurry up! This is not the time to be standing around like this."

"I want to watch a little longer."

"Ugh! Won't you listen, mister?"

Victor, worried that the children might be harmed, couldn't help but ask for help when the others kept hesitating to turn away.

"Mr. Marcus! What are you doing standing there blankly? Quickly, get the kids to safety!"

"Huh? Oh, alright. Come on, let's go, kids!"

Did they snap out of it with Victor's voice?

Those who were blankly watching the massacre, including other adults, belatedly started evacuating with the children.

However, perhaps because several people were moving?

It couldn't escape the eyes of the ordinary organization members, and it was natural for the muzzles of guns to be pointed in their direction.

"Where do these bastards think they're running off to? Why aren't they coming here? If you don't want to turn into a beehive, come back, you slave bastards!"

"Ah...."

People who were fleeing halted their steps.

A sigh escaped from Victor's mouth.

He had hoped to quietly get only the children to safety, but everything went wrong.

Rat-tat-tat-tat-!

At that moment, with sudden gunfire, an organization member who was shouting fell to the ground.

Rat-tat-tat- rat-tat-tat-tat!

It wasn't just one person; dozens of organization members collapsed like reeds, spraying blood everywhere.

What was happening? It seemed like three organization members were conspiring and shooting at the others.

'What's going on? Are the organization members betraying each other all of a sudden?'
ChatGPT

However, Victor, who was puzzled by the sudden gunfire between the organization members, almost fainted when he saw a woman appear out of nowhere.

"Now's the time. Quickly get people to safety."

The unexpectedly appeared Asian woman did say something, but Victor couldn't understand what she was saying. However, he could infer the meaning through her gestures.

'Ah, she's telling us to run away quickly.'

Nodding towards the Asian woman, Victor left a grateful word and directed people to evacuate.

As far away from the scene as possible.

"Kraaak!"

"Kook!"

"Argh!"

A scene of massacre where blood splattered everywhere.

Abu Bakr, watching over that hell, calmly lit a cigarette.

"Damn it, it's over. He's not my match."

He felt strongly that it was all over from the moment his face hit the ground.

The moment he realized the strength pressing on the back of his head, he sensed that he was dealing with an unapproachable existence.

"It's the Black Reaper. He really is the Black Reaper."

True to the class of a Reaper, he was effortlessly slaughtering thirty players without batting an eye.

They were carefully selected individuals within the organization, but Abu Bakr didn't expect them to be defeated so easily.

"Today is truly a cursed day. Damn it."

For now, he had to take advantage of the Reaper being busy with the fight and escape.

Whether it was the lives of his subordinates or anything else, he didn't care. His own life was more important than anything else.

"Allah, why do you give me such trials today."

Although he resented God today, he couldn't escape the thought that it was all due to his own wrongdoings.

Surviving and kidnapping and killing many unbelievers who didn't believe in Allah seemed to be the only way to cleanse his present sins.

'Ah, running away is also a problem, but for now...'

Running non-stop, Abu Bakr, who had hidden behind a building, took out his cellphone.

Tap-tap-

After quickly sending a message, he peeked out again.

"Motherf***er!"

There was someone on the radar of the motion detection.

Most likely, it was the Reaper, that guy.

"Darn it, it might not catch him, so for now, let's use invisibility..."

Swoosh- He hid his body and jumped.

However, before he knew it, someone had closed the distance, and there was a thud.
ChatGPT

"Kwaaak!"

His head slammed into the building wall, and the invisibility was undone.

Brick dust rained down under his forehead.

Swoosh-

Thrown into the air, he rotated six times before landing heavily on the ground.

"Where do you think you're running off to?"

Thud-

"Kukukuk!"

Abu Bakr, whose ankle was crushed under Ryumin's foot, couldn't muster the will to counter the overwhelming strength.

"Over here too."

Thud-

"Aaargh!"

His ankle shattered, and he couldn't even move. He was lifted up like a ragdoll, grabbed by the nape of his neck.

"Come with me. If you don't want to die."

Ryumin took the semi-conscious guy with her.

"Yamti, control this guy. We need to lure as we've done so far."

"Yes, master."

Ryumin looked at Victor, who was hiding with the children.

Victor Jafarley, the only alchemist.

The goal of rescuing him, who had climbed up by breaking many organizations, was achieved within two days, but there was still work to be done.

He knew that the guy dominated by Yamti was not the leader of ISIS, just a middle boss.

'He's nothing more than an intermediary. We need to draw out the real one.'

Ryumin smirked behind her mask.

The ISIS, a non-state organization following Islam, had been on the decline since 2017.

Now, there were almost only remnants of their power.

Therefore, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, the 2nd Caliph of ISIS and the current supreme leader, was thirsting for the revival of the organization.

'Once again, we need to expand our influence to the point where the whole country trembles just by hearing the name IS.'

They had to intensify terrorism more than now and kidnap more children.

And through indoctrination, transform them into warriors solely for Allah.

That was the reason for kidnapping children.

It was an investment for glory, for the future.

On the other hand, the players were an investment for the present.

'An investment drawing a downward curve every month.'

Currently, there were about 800 players operating under the name IS in Nigeria.

Originally there were more, but their numbers had been steadily decreasing each month.
ChatGPT

A few more months and there might not be any remaining players.

That was the biggest drawback of players.

It was one of the reasons why ordinary Al-Baghdadi disliked players.

'Being essentially disposable and not even strong enough to dodge bullets...'

The only advantage was that they could easily enter other countries and carry out terrorism without firearms...

'These days, people don't even come out of their homes because they're scared of players.'

The environment for terrorism was not favorable either.

'Useless players. Tsk.'

He clicked his tongue, but at least Victor, the alchemist, created potions that he somewhat acknowledged.

'Potions are helpful. They can be sold on the black market or saved for the future.'

Currently, he was saving them for the future.

He only sold a little on the black market when he needed funds.

Of course, ordinary people couldn't use potions, but if players provided them, they could still benefit.

Potion Shuttle.

That was the extent of the player's value.

At least for Al-Baghdadi.

'I need to step up terrorism before the number of players decreases further.'

He was planning to implement the prepared plan.

Ordinary and player organization members would collaborate to create a masterpiece.

'If we execute a terrorism act that surprises the world, we might be able to regain IS's reputation.'

As he was rechecking the plan, a message arrived on Al-Baghdadi's phone.

[Abu Bakr: Emergency. The organization is under attack by someone presumed to be the Black Scythe.]

'Black Scythe?'

Even Al-Baghdadi, who was not a player, had heard the name Black Scythe.

Because his subordinate players had praised them so much.

'A player of level 89 who hasn't missed the top rank?'

Comparing it to the fact that most players were level 40, he could roughly guess how powerful they were.

'If we manage to recruit this guy into our IS?'

It might make the dream of IS, the White House terrorism, possible.

"I've finally found a useful player."

Al-Baghdadi's eyes curved like a crescent moon.
