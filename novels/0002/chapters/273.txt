Title: "Chapter 273 of the 100th Regression for Max Level Players"

Dragon Subjugation

For players who have become commanders, staying in the barracks is usual.

Why?

Because they can't directly intervene in the war anyway.

Not only is the war location unknown, but the system also blocks access to the area.

That's the rule of the 17th round.

Even if the player leaves the barracks, there's nothing specific for them to do.

"I knew it. Until you go outside the barracks."

In the past, Ryu Min had explored the surroundings to see if he could really participate in the war.

The surroundings were full of mountains, and the rugged terrain had no paths, but it wasn't entirely isolated.

"Beyond the mountains, a city came out. A small kingdom called Dekan."

However, he couldn't reach the war zone due to an invisible wall that seemed to be the system's guidance.

Even so, it didn't mean there was no income.

He could use the kingdom's mercenary group.

[Golden Eagle Mercenary Group Dekan Branch]

Although the sign was written in characters from another world, it could be interpreted.

"If I use the mercenary group, I can capture a dragon."

Of course, he had to do it before the war ended.

"Don't worry. There's still over three hours left for it to end."

As he stepped inside, the receptionist of the mercenary group asked with a smiling face.

"What brings you here?"

"I came to request subjugation."

"Just a moment, oh, the mercenary group rank is [Master]. Just a moment, let me find a quest suitable for the Master rank...."

While the receptionist was searching, Ryu Min knew.

There was only one quest that a Master could do right away.

"There is a dragon subjugation quest... Will you take it?"

[You can perform the quest to subjugate the Black Dragon Karsainox. Would you like to accept? Y/N]

"If you don't want to, I can recommend other lower-level quests...."

"I'll do it."

There was no reason to refuse.

After accepting, the receptionist nodded and said that the subjugation team would arrive shortly, asking him to wait outside.

Indeed, not long after, the subjugation team arrived in front of the mercenary group.

"Are you the Black Scythe? I am Antonio Richardson, the leader of the 2nd Subjugation Unit of the Golden Eagle Mercenary Group. Did you apply to help capture the Death Dragon?"

"Yes."

"Your courage is impressive. We have some brave applicants like yourself on this side, so let me introduce you."

Ryu Min's gaze fell upon twenty mercenaries. Judging by their appearance, they consisted of various professions such as mages, archers, and warriors, but they were all NPCs.

"I shouldn't rely on these henchmen."

Dragon hunting was solely Ryu Min's responsibility as a supporter.

"Now that we've exchanged greetings, shall we set out?"

He followed the mercenaries to the nearby warp gate.

"Prepare yourself mentally."

In an instant, the background around Ryu Min changed to the Death Canyon, where the rare Black Dragon was said to be.

The location of the Dragon Rare was not accessible to just anyone. Even if one knew the location, they would be blocked at the entrance unless they reached the highest rank of the mercenary group, known as 'Master.'

This was the reason for not bringing the Jewel of Radiance that increased the boss drop rate by ten times.

"Even if it works, I have no intention of bringing it because of titles and runes."

When a player successfully captured a dragon for the first time, they could obtain titles and runes. Ryu Min couldn't compromise on this matter.

"I won't even consider conceding for the sake of slightly increasing item drop rates."

The player's luck stat affected both the draw rate and item drop rate. Despite having only Democracy's Blessing applied currently, the luck stat exceeded 870,000. With such a high stat, even items with low drop rates would inevitably come out with a 100% chance.

"There's a monster ahead!"

"Everyone, get ready for battle!"

"Stay on high alert!"

The mercenaries tensed up as they saw the monster appearing at the entrance of the canyon.

It was the Dark Illusion that appeared in the 15th round.

Woo-woo-woo-

Wearing tattered clothes and freely roaming through the darkness, the mercenaries trembled in fear at the sight of them.

However, being a Dragon Subjugation Unit, the mercenaries quickly regained their composure, but it was already too late.

The monster's claws were approaching dangerously close.

But...

Schtak-!

"I can't let the guide die."

Ryu Min's scythe was a step faster.
ChatGPT

The Dark Illusion tears apart like a piece of paper and disappears.

[You have defeated the Dark Illusion!] [Experience points increased by 1.5 times due to the title effect.] [Experience points and gold increased by 2 times due to the Rune of Predation effect.] [Acquired 5 stacks and 1 stat point with the Rune of Predation.] [Accumulated Predation Stacks: 5] [Experience +0.47%] [Gold +20,000] [Additional Gold +10,000] [Hero's Rune Stacks: 1/100] [All stats increased by 1 with the Hero's Rune effect.] [Current Kill Count: 1/100] [All stats increased by 1% with the Rune of Slaughter effect.] [19 enemies within a radius of 100m.] [All stats increased by 19% with the Rune of One Hundred effect.]

The messages seem overly abundant for just defeating a low-level monster.

"Is it really just a low-level mob?"

Considering that the Dark Illusion was stronger than a High Orc, calling it a low-level mob seemed unreasonable.

Well, at Ryu Min's level, even a boss-level enemy was no different from a mob.

"At the 15th round, it was invincible and couldn't be killed, but..."

Swish!

With a single swing of his scythe, another Dark Illusion dispersed.

"Now things are different."

No matter how many appear, he was ready to kill them all.

"You're quite impressive."

"So, you're the Black Scythe? Not just a Master-grade for nothing."

Despite the NPC's praise, Ryu Min didn't smile. Smiling at the predetermined dialogue would hurt his pride.

"Well, there's nothing to be praised for just killing such low-level mobs."

After defeating twenty Dark Illusions, Ryu Min accumulated 20 stat points. It might be a small amount for him, but considering it, it was quite substantial. In terms of levels, it was like gaining 10 levels.

"That's why the Rune of Predation is so good. It generously boosts stats."

And the advantages didn't stop there.

[You have achieved 100 stacks with the Rune of Predation.] [As an additional effect, strength and physique are increased by 10%.]

Ryu Min's height, which was 180 before, grew close to 2m.

Checking the stat window, he noticed that his strength stat had also increased by 10%.

"My height increased a bit, but it's not uncomfortable."
ChatGPT

Ryu Min was no longer an adult with a height below average.

The increase in physique also applied to reality.

"My height, which was 165, must have become over 180."

He instantly achieved an ideal height, but there was no particular excitement. The increase in stats felt like a more significant gain than such trivial things.

One of the mercenaries at the forefront pointed forward with his finger.

"Captain! I found it! That cave over there is where the wicked Black Dragon resides."

"Alright. Everyone, proceed with caution!"

Ryu Min and the 21 NPCs entered carefully.

Then, a message appeared.

[You have entered the lair of the Black Dragon Rare.] [The smell of intense death tightens your breath.] [As a penalty, all stats are reduced by 25%.]

An enormous penalty that could make anyone curse upon reading it.

However, Ryu Min wasn't particularly bothered.

"Even if it's reduced by 25%, a dragon will still be a one-hit kill."

The mercenaries illuminated the cave with magic as they moved forward in a line.

"Hurry up. There's no need to walk so slowly."

Contrary to people's worries, nothing came out at the entrance.

They would have to go deeper to encounter the guardians protecting the dragon.

After walking for quite some time, the roar of the guardian was heard.

"Grrrrraaaagh!"

"Yikes! It, it appeared."

Dark Ogre.

A monster twice as powerful as the Ogre, known as the strongest monster on the ground.

While it could be considered boss-level, compared to the true boss, the dragon, it was just a small fry guarding the door.

"Everyone, attack!"

"Waaaah!"

All 21 rushed towards the Dark Ogre.

Still, being a Dragon Subjugation Unit, their skills were excellent.

"If we compare them to players, they might be around level 60?"

However, that level wouldn't be enough.

At best, they could only hold down the Dark Ogre's feet.

"In the end, I'll have to step in."

Things would become easy once Ryu Min stepped in.

"Grrrrraaaagh... Ugh!"

Even with a 25% reduction, his stats were in the hundreds of thousands.

Moreover, the damage was amplified by 2 times due to the Rune of Yin and Yang.

For a Dark Ogre, one strike, whether it be a magic attack or a regular one, would be enough to finish it off.

[Dark Ogre has been defeated!] [Experience points increased by 1.5 times due to the title effect.] [Experience points and gold increased by 2 times due to the Rune of Predation effect.] [Acquired 10 stacks and 2 stat points with the Rune of Predation.] [Accumulated Predation Stacks: 110] [Experience +0.95%] [Gold +40,000] [Additional Gold +20,000] [Current Kill Count: 21/100] [All stats increased by 21% with the Rune of Slaughter effect.] [5 enemies within a radius of 100m.] [All stats increased by 5% with the Rune of One Hundred effect.]

Nearby, there are four more Dark Ogres.

After swiftly defeating them, Ryu Min could finally face the Black Dragon.

"Th-that... Death Dragon...!"

A vast cavern.

An area where only darkness, not even light, was allowed to exist.

There, fierce red eyes like snakes were visible.

[Humans who dared to venture out of their makeshift boat. Don't even think about returning alive after trespassing in my territory.]

The voice of the Black Dragon was transmitted into Ryu Min's mind in a manner resembling sending vibrations to a specific target.

"Well, that's not something I care about."

Ryu Min walked alone, raising his scythe.

The mercenaries, who had been trembling, looked at Ryu Min with dumbfounded eyes.

[I am Karsaionox, the Death Dragon. Those who dare to invade my territory should not think about returning alive...]

The dragon seemed puzzled, speaking but stopping mid-sentence.

It realized the powerful energy gathering at the tip of the scythe.

Ryu Min consumed the Judgment Rune stacks he had been accumulating but hadn't used until now.

"Heavenly Judgment."

Suddenly, light exploded in the space where there was only darkness.

A technique used by Rank 5 Archangel Raguel.

The rising light in the form of an X pushed back the darkness.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

"Screaaam!"

"Ugh!"

The shock was enough to shake the cavern, and people were bewildered by the impact. However, even more surprising was the result that followed.

"T-the dragon?"

"It disappeared?"

"Where did it go?"

The vast space, previously occupied by the dragon's massive body, was now empty.

There were no traces of a corpse or any bloodstains.

The dragon had vanished without a trace due to the strike it received.
