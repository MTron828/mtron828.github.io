Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player Episode 232"

Gustabo

Tap-tap-

The door opened with a knock, and a stream of slaves entered.

These were women who until recently had homes. Now they were widows with neither husbands nor children.

"These are carefully selected slaves in their early thirties. Even though they are in their twenties, they are well-managed slaves that you can trust, and they won't be lacking for your enjoyment."

"Heh, I've felt it for a while, but Gustabo, you really understand my preferences, don't you? You don't even need to speak; you know exactly what I want and prepare it perfectly. Hehehe."

Dungadunga, who had bloodshot eyes, rose from his seat and approached the woman who caught his fancy.

"Sniff, hehe."

"..."

Even as they smelled the fragrance around their necks like sniffing flowers, the women didn't show any signs of displeasure. They just stood there like mannequins. They had to. If they showed even a bit of resentment, they might end up dead like their husbands.

"Oh, you all behave like obedient puppies, don't you? Not a single frown on your faces."

"Of course. What choice do we have in the face of strength? If you kill our families right in front of us, we have no choice but to submit, right?"

"Hehe, isn't this great? I can do whatever I want with fellow humans. How are they even considered the same as us? Just ordinary people who weren't chosen."

"Hahaha, exactly. Our player is the chosen superior being."

"So, Brazil should adopt the slave system quickly too. Can you really say that ordinary people and players receive equal treatment?"

"Listening to you, it makes sense. We control the country and can't even think of treating them as slaves... After we return, we should round up ordinary people and bring them in. Hahaha."

Dungadunga, who was laughing heartily at the thought, brought the woman he liked and seated her next to him.

"Well, let's try the drink brought by the Mexican slave. Have a taste!"

"Yes..."

For a young man, there was no room to complain about being in a situation where he had to pour drinks. Just being alive was a miracle in itself in this situation.

"Hey! What are you all standing around for? You came from afar, so let me offer you a massage at least."

"Yes..."

At Gustabo's command, the remaining women approached, concealing their fear.

As they sat on the sofa receiving full-body massages, Dungadunga's expression lazily transformed.

"Hehe, is this paradise? To receive treatment like this, which I couldn't even get in my homeland. I'm truly grateful."

"If you're grateful, next time you come, select a few Brazilian slaves to send. The younger, the better. Ideally, under 14..."

"Oh, is that your preference?"

Gustabo nodded, and Dungadunga laughed as if finding it amusing.

"Hahaha! Great. Since we've received, we should also give. It's good that our preferences don't overlap."

"Thank you. Hoho."

With a satisfied smile, Gustabo turned off the TV screen showing a black scythe.

Seemingly disgusted by the sight.

"Well, shall we get down to business?"

"Let's."

The two of them discussed their plans for a while while pouring and drinking drinks.

"We may control the media, but it's only a matter of time before the coup becomes known. You can't stop the sand slipping through your fingers."

"I agree. So, we need a plan in response."

"How about this? To prepare for invasion from other countries, we create an alliance. If several anarchic nations like ours come together, won't it strengthen us?"

"Gustabo, you really seem to have a sharp mind. Both the slave system and this alliance. Helping each other in times of danger can't be more reassuring."

"This is confidential information. According to the intelligence I've received, there are movements in India and China to create independent nations."

"In India and China?"

"Yes. They aim to create independent nations with abundant military power, much like us. I've also learned the nicknames of some key figures."

"Really? That's quite advanced information."

"They're probably keeping an eye on the situation due to the Black Scythe's speech. Whether to create independent nations or not. If we extend a helping hand to them first, offering assistance, it might be good to bring them into the alliance. What do you think?"
ChatGPT

"You have a truly excellent idea. Does the Black Scythe's speech help at times like this? It provides a reason for us to unite. Hahaha!"

With a hearty laugh, Dungadunga, while emptying his glass of alcohol, suddenly had a thought in his head.

"Hmm, but speaking of which, isn't there another way?"

"What way?"

"Do we really need to confront the Black Scythe head-on? Wouldn't it be best if we could make him lean toward our side, if possible?"

"He's openly provoking an unspecified number of players on a public stage. Do you think someone like that would cooperate?"

"Well, you never know unless you try...."

As Gustabo abruptly stood up, the woman pouring the drinks beside him accidentally spilled them, making a surprised sound.

"He's the bastard who loudly declared war on IS and threatened us. He's not someone who would listen to words...."

Drip, drip, drip—

A cold sensation touched the sole of his foot.

Looking down, Gustabo saw that the spilled alcohol from the missed bottle was soaking his foot.

"What the hell, woman?"

Suddenly feeling irritated, Gustabo grabbed the woman by her hair and lifted her up.

"Aaack!"

"You spared her life just because she's a woman, and she can't even pour a simple drink properly?"

"Ah, it hurts. P-please let go...."

"Are you talking back about being a slave?"

The woman felt a chill in the young voice.

Even if she apologized, all she could think about was her own pain.

"Sorry, sorry. Sniff, it's my mistake. I really messed up, ah, aack!"

Thrown away like a rag, her hair was pulled out in clumps.

"Feeling really damn crappy. Hey, crawl over here and lick it."

As he extended his foot, the woman crawled towards him with tears in her eyes.

It was humiliating, but honestly, just being alive was fortunate enough.

She didn't know, however.

Another rumor circulating about her, suggesting that dealing with her could lead to perverted tendencies.

"No, this won't satisfy my anger."

After clearing his foot, Gustabo looked at Dungadunga.

"Sorry, but can I make a request?"

"A request?"

"I'm thinking of giving punishment to this defiant woman, but as you can see, I have a preference for young children."

"Oh."
!
ChatGPT

Having understood the situation, Dungadunga smirked wickedly.

Seeing his expression, Gustabo also raised the corners of his mouth.

There was no need for explicit answers.

A smile soaked in greed, that was all it took.

"Your master wants me to punish you? Come here. I'll personally deliver the punishment. Hehe."

"Aaack!"

Dungadunga forcibly made the woman lie on the ground.

"Sorry, sorry. Sniff, please forgive me."

"Tsk, stay still. You might get hurt if you move."

At that moment, Dungadunga, who had taken off his top, was about to rob the woman.

Crash!

Suddenly, the door burst open, and everyone involuntarily turned their heads.

"What the hell...?"

Dungadunga, whose pleasant time was disrupted, initially furrowed his brows but gradually widened them in surprise.

Gustabo's expression wasn't much different.

It was simply because they recognized the person standing in front of them.

"Black Scythe...?"

The unexpected guest who entered was the Black Scythe they had seen on TV.

For them, who believed that no one could enter if missiles intercepted, it was a sudden encounter.

"How did you get here...?"

Before he could finish his sentence.

Crash!

Dungadunga's hefty body slammed into the wall.

"..."

Gustabo's expression changed bewilderingly.

It wasn't clear when or how he moved.

It was imperceptible.

Simply the scene of Dungadunga being thrust into the wall remained in memory in the blink of an eye.

'The 2nd ranked player in Brazil, Dungadunga, taken down in a single blow....'

Gustabo's head turned stiffly.

"Are you okay?"

"Yes? Y-yes...."

The Black Scythe was helping the slave who had just been under Dungadunga to stand up, without even glancing at him.

'Arrogant. How dare he show his back to me?'

Thinking of revealing his true colors to the guy who was letting his guard down, Gustabo tried to summon a weapon, but he couldn't.

'Huh? Why can't I grab my weapon?'

He felt no sensation in his palms.

Gustabo's expression became perplexed as he looked down.

The hand that should have been there was now missing.

"Cough!"

Belatedly feeling the surging pain, Gustabo wanted to grab his wrists, but the situation was the same for his other hand.

Gustabo couldn't believe it when he saw both of his hands cleanly severed and lying on the floor.

To be attacked without even realizing it himself.

It felt surreal.

'What happened? He was clearly just showing his back, wasn't he?'

"It doesn't mean you can't be attacked just by showing your back."

Gustabo was once again surprised, looking at the Black Scythe, who answered his thoughts as if reading them.

The guy's shadow seemed to be dancing, and then two dark blades floated in the air.

No sound of the blades cutting through the air was heard.

Thunk!

Only the sound of the blades piercing his knees reached him.

Thud!

Gustabo, forced to kneel, was pushed back, and Ryu Min looked at the enslaved women.

"Everyone, please leave from here. I have something to discuss with him alone."

People hurriedly left their places.

'These, these slave bastards...'

Even if things had gotten this bad, without even hesitating, they moved at the Black Scythe's words?

Perhaps due to wounded pride, Gustabo shouted.

"Stop! I'll definitely find and kill any damn bitch who tries to escape! I remember your faces!"

The women stopped their hesitant steps in front of the door at his threat.

No one present could afford to ignore Gustabo's words.

They had already experienced enough of the Black Scythe's cruelty.

"Hurry back, you damn bitches!"

When Gustabo urged them, the women tried to return.

At that moment, the Black Scythe stood between them and spoke.

Unlike the growling Gustabo, he spoke calmly with a serene voice.

"No need to come back. Don't worry and go home. It will be difficult for this guy to survive after today."

"Enough of this nonsense. Do you think my subordinates stationed around will just stand still? I'll kill every damn bitch who tries to escape! Once you step outside, you'll all be finished!"

"Don't worry about that either. All the players around here are already dead."

"What?"

Gustabo, more surprised than the enslaved women, opened his eyes.

"You killed all my subordinates? Is that a lie?"

"Not at all. When I counted, it was a total of 129. Isn't that correct?"

"..."

Silence was a form of affirmative response.
ChatGPT

Ryumin's words were not lies.

'I'll reduce the number of survivors, but it's better to have no uncontrollable trash.'

All 129 people killed before Ryumin arrived were members of the cartel organization under Gustabo.

They were not decent players who reluctantly followed orders due to their strength, but rather trash who enjoyed and carried out all kinds of crimes.

Even if you spared such individuals, there was no chance of rehabilitation, and there was a possibility they could cause trouble like untamed colts.

If they couldn't be controlled, disposing of them early was clean and without consequences.

"You... you quietly killed my subordinates?"

"It's dangerous; please leave quickly. Leave it to me."

Slaves who regained their composure at Ryumin's voice quickly left their places.

In the vast space, only Ryumin, Dungadunga, Gustabo, and three remained.

"Thi-this..."

Gustabo, who was muttering uncontrollably in anger, eventually spoke while trembling.

"I don't know how you managed to avoid interception and come here, but you won't get the information you want. I'm more tight-lipped than you might think. Dungadunga is the same..."

Thud!

Gustabo couldn't continue his words as he stopped abruptly.

He saw the Black Scythe, who had been stabbed through Dungadunga, who was pinned to the wall.

'What, what is this? Just killing like this? Without asking anything?'

Wasn't he spared to extract information through torture?

So, wasn't he supposed to keep the slaves?

"Not true?"

Seeing the Black Scythe reading his thoughts again, Gustabo sent a look of disbelief.

"Are you, by any chance, reading my mind?"

"Yes."

Surprisingly, the Black Scythe admitted it readily.

Gustabo still showed a shocked expression.

"H-how can that be?"

"Anyway, you'll die soon. What does it matter what I do?"

"Aren't you... going to extract information from me? Didn't you keep me alive because you were curious about something?"

"I'm not curious about anything. I've already read all the necessary information from your mind."

"Then why did you let the slaves..."

"Go outside?"

As soon as Gustabo asked, Ryumin's scythe pierced Gustabo's heart.

"Cough..."

Laughing as he watched the struggling guy drop his head, Ryumin said with a smirk, "You're about to die anyway."
ChatGPT

"It's uncomfortable to watch someone else kill you."

Ryumin, who had removed his mask after disposing of the sprawled corpse and erasing the traces, didn't take much time to transform into Gustabo.

"Shall we start shooting now?"
