Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 141"

CPF

Everyone has dreams.

During the time when people pour their passion and sweat without sleeping at night to achieve their dreams, there must have been a time like that for everyone.

Police officer Kang Sihyuk of Gangnam Police Station was no exception.

In his youth, he saved even the time to eat, dedicating himself to the police officer exams.

Despite facing failure multiple times, the driving force that he never gave up on was his childhood dream of becoming a detective, catching criminals and being a just and righteous police officer, just like the cool detectives in movies.

"It was my dream to become a noble police officer who catches criminals just like in the movies."

Because of such a dream, after two failures, he finally passed the exam and reached his current position, but...

What awaited him was not a detective but rather tasks like drunk driving checks and traffic patrol.

That was the usual path for diligent ordinary patrol officers.

"But I also got my chance."

On January 1st, he couldn't help but feel despair as he found himself participating in the Angel's Game, also known as the Great Revolution or Catastrophe.

"It was tough becoming a police officer, and this is how it ends?"

However, talents have a way of shining unexpectedly.

Surprisingly, Kang Sihyuk, who showed talent in monster hunting, skill utilization, and rune usage in strategies, managed to survive up to the 9th round.

And now, he has been selected as a member of the newly established Counter Player Force (CPF), under the government's leadership.

The same person who used to push breathalyzers during traffic duty.

"They say if you don't give up, someday the path will open, and strangely, the catastrophe turned out to be a blessing in disguise."

While others may not know, for Kang Sihyuk, at least now was the prime time.

It was a once-in-a-lifetime stroke of luck and an opportunity to realize his dream.

Ding-

Opening the door and entering CPF's temporary assembly point, Kang Sihyuk looked at the five people sitting and greeted them while checking his phone.

"Hello! I'm Kang Sihyuk, a 28-year-old patrol officer transferred from Gangnam Police Station!"

"No need to be so formal. We're all just patrol officers."

"Really?"

Kang Sihyuk scratched the back of his head as if embarrassed.

"Nice to meet you. I'm Mintaesu from Daegu Central Police Station. I'm 29 years old."

"I'm Hwang Manki from Guri Inchang Police Station. I'm 28 years old."

"I'm Go Namcheol from Busan Southern Police Station. I'm 29 years old. Uh, do we have to talk about our levels and professions?"

"Wow, Busan?"

As they exchanged introductions, it turned out that people had come from all over the country.

Some had received sudden transfer orders and couldn't find accommodation, so they were staying in hotels.

Of course, it was compulsory, but no one expressed dissatisfaction.

Because they were not the ones satisfied with the position of a patrol officer.

"For us, this is an opportunity. When else would we get a chance to work in a special force like this?"

"Right. I was lamenting about trying to catch criminals in about 5 years, but who would have known such an opportunity would come?"

"Isn't it ridiculous that we're grateful for becoming players?"

Although they hurriedly arrived, everyone knew what kind of unit CPF was.

"A unit that eliminates criminal players. Wow, isn't that cool?"

"I heard it's not necessarily killing, but only when it's dangerous, right?"

"Well, that's the gist of it."

"The world has really changed a lot. Allowing immediate disposal by conservative government officials."

"That means the world has become very dangerous, right?"

"But anyway, players are decreasing by half, right? Even if they don't step forward, they'll disappear. Why create such a unit?"

"Even if players decrease, the threat is still a threat."

"Hey, did he say Kang Sihyuk? Since we're all in the same rank, feel free to talk casually. After all, you've come as a basic unit member, right? Our ages are roughly in the late twenties, aren't they?"

"Oh, is that so? Haha."

The six police players quickly became acquainted.

With many commonalities and similar interests in catching criminals, their conversations flowed smoothly.

"Hello. Is this the temporary assembly point for CPF?"

"Hello."

Additional prospective unit members also started to join.

They, too, were among the few police player officers remaining nationwide, and their intentions and interests were similar.

"Seems like we're all pretty similar, huh? The desire to beat down criminals is strong in all of us."

"To be honest, as a professional, I shouldn't say such things, but when I see those inhuman beings, I don't know how to put it, but I feel a desire to kill."

"Do you feel the same way? I've seen victims coming to the police station and crying their hearts out. It really makes your blood boil, doesn't it?"

"Those inhuman beings becoming players and acting like monsters, that's probably why this unit was established."

"By the way, who's our unit leader?"

"Well, who knows? Anyone heard any news?"

"None."

"Do we even have a unit leader in our unit?"

"Of course, it's a unit."

"Weren't we supposed to choose from among ourselves?"

"How would we choose? Rock-paper-scissors? Hehe."

"They'll probably choose one of the officers who graduated from the police university."

"Then it would be an officer, but do you think there's a surviving officer among the players?"

The unit members were curious about the leader who would guide them. They were told to gather here by 8 PM, but there was no detailed information.

"I hope it's not an old-fashioned person."

"There's no way it's an old-fashioned person. If they're a player, they should be under 29 like us."

"Oh, that makes sense."

"Why are you all so sure the unit leader is a player? They could be a civilian."

"Come on, that's a bit much. If the unit members are players, and the officer is a civilian?"

"Then they'll follow orders well."

They correctly guessed that the leader is a player, but beyond that, they had no idea.

"But how many police players are left nationwide?"

"Surely it's not just us, right?"

"Oh, it can't be."

At that moment, when the ten players were thinking like that:

"All of you."

The voice of a third party made the unit members turn their heads in one direction.

Swoosh-

A man appeared in the air, wearing a white mask, staring at them.

"Wow! What is this? Invisibility?"

"I didn't feel any aura at all."

"Who are you?! Who are you!"

"Since when were you there?"

"Since a while ago. I've been watching you from the surveillance dimension."

Ryumin answered casually as he walked towards them.

The players couldn't take their eyes off Ryumin, who suddenly appeared.

Some were on guard, ready to put on their equipment at any moment.

It was a natural reaction.

After all, he was a suspicious man with a white mask covering his face.
ChatGPT

Ryumin looked at the unit members and said, "There's no need to be on guard. I'm the unit leader you've been waiting for."

The unit leader...?

Him?

He told them the truth, but none of the unit members took it at face value. First, they doubted and observed.

Whoever heard of a unit leader covering their face with a mask? It seemed absurd unless one was insane.

"Hmm, not a pleasant face. Well, if you appear wearing a mask, it might look weird."

"Are you really the leader of our unit?"

"Why are you wearing a mask?"

"I don't want my face to be known. And by the way, I have permission from the Police Chief, so don't raise any objections."

The unit members secretly sighed. Some were already lamenting the strange leader they got.

How famous is he that he hides his face?

Does that mean we can sell our faces?

This is really absurd.

He had given them a negative first impression.

Well, it didn't matter.

"I don't care how they see me. What's important is how well I catch criminals."

From the beginning, Ryumin had only visited briefly to train and teach them, and he had no intention of spending the whole day here like a 5-minute waiting formation.

"If someone doesn't listen, I'll have to teach them a lesson."

He was the highest-ranking officer here, so he could do whatever he wanted. With the support of the Police Chief, he had no problems.

Above all, Ryumin could see seven seconds into the future.

Knowing how they would react when he revealed his nickname, he wasn't worried about his image.

"Let me formally introduce myself. My nickname in this realm is 'Black Scythe.' My profession is 'Death Messenger,' and my level is 89. I cannot reveal my real-life identity, as you can understand."

"Bl- Black Scythe...?"

"Is that the Black Scythe?"

The players were surprised and bewildered by the unexpected nickname.

Every time the ranking results were announced, the top-ranked nickname was Black Scythe. With an overwhelming level, he was known as a monster among players.

"When you reach level 60, you can reach the Master rank. Then, the Duel Request function is unlocked. It's a feature where you can challenge each other to a duel, and as I mentioned, only I, being level 89, can use this function."

"But can't that prove you're Black Scythe?"

"No, it can. If you've seen the ranking results, you'd understand. The level difference between the 1st and 2nd place globally is significant. Currently, there's only one Black Scythe in the Master rank worldwide. So, if someone has the ability to use the Duel Request function, you can consider them as Black Scythe."

"But can't you guarantee that this Duel Request function is unlocked at level 60?"

"Well, once you reach level 60, you'll find out for yourself, but if you're not convinced, we can try it. Honestly, it's not about whether I'm really Black Scythe, right? You just want to know if I have the qualifications as a unit leader, if I'm stronger or weaker than you. Isn't that right?"

"..."

Although they remained silent with stern faces, the unit members were secretly surprised. Not because their inner thoughts were exposed but because Ryumin spoke so bluntly.

"Well then, who wants to be the first?"

"..."

"None? Don't worry. You won't die from a duel if you agree on the conditions together. That's the feature of the Duel Request function. Of course, it only applies between the parties involved in the duel, so you might still die from attacks by others."

"..."

"So, none? Anyone willing to fight me?"

The police officers exchanged glances but remained silent.

"None? Don't worry. If we agree on conditions, there won't be any fatal consequences from the duel. That's the characteristic of the Duel Request function. Of course, it only applies between the parties involved in the duel, so you might still die from attacks by others."

"..."

"So, none? Let's just consider you're acknowledging me as Black Scythe..."

Just then, the first volunteer appeared.

"I'll give it a try."

It was Gonamcheol, the man from Busan, who had challenged Ryumin.
