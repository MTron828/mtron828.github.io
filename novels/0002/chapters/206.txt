Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max-Level Player - Episode 206"

Episode 206: "Inferiority to Others"

Ma Kyung-rok has two younger brothers.

The second son, Ma Kyung-sang, is one year younger.

The third son, Ma Kyung-su, is two years younger.

Even though they fought a lot when they were young, they never had a reason to blush each other's faces.

As they grew older, the bond between the brothers changed for a different reason.

Money.

As their heads grew bigger, they realized the value of money and discovered that they were not just born with a silver spoon, but with a diamond spoon.

Also, the fact that they would inherit a considerable fortune when their father passed away played a role.

Naturally, they started looking out for their own interests. However, the problem was the eldest son, Ma Kyung-rok.

Typically, the position of the heir is reserved for the eldest son.

The possibility of the second and third sons living their lives cautiously was high.

Did he dislike being in that position?

The brothers joined hands and began to protest to their father, claiming that it was unfair.

They argued that it didn't make sense for Ma Kyung-rok, the eldest son with no abilities, to take over.

They believed that they were more qualified to run the company.

Ma Dae-cheol, who had previously adhered to tradition, ultimately decided to choose the heir based on ability rather than tradition.

This was the reason for the strained relationship between Ma Kyung-rok and his brothers.

"Why are you guys here?"

Ma Kyung-rok's cold gaze met the sharp eyes of Ma Kyung-sang and Ma Kyung-su.

"We came to congratulate you."

"You guys don't need to congratulate me. Leave."

"Seriously, did we come all the way here just to be kicked out?"

"Our father, no, the chairman asked us to come with him."

Chairman Ma Dae-cheol gave his two sons a meaningful look.

"Stop it, both of you. Do you really have to fight after coming this far?"

"... "

"You invited us to acknowledge our brother's achievements and reconcile, but the moment we arrived, you look at us as if you want to kill us."

"Alright, boys. Isn't it about time you acknowledged your brother's success?"

As they turned around at the voice from behind, they saw a well-dressed middle-aged man entering with security guards.

It was Mayor Ma Dong-won of Seoul.

"Little brothers... No, did the Mayor come too?"

"It's been a while, Kyung-rok. We're family, no need for formalities. Just call me 'Little Father.'"

Ma Dong-won, who had a gentle smile unlike the atmosphere, tried to lighten the cold atmosphere between the brothers by changing the topic.

"Thanks for arranging this celebration. Did you prepare it yourself?"

"I just prepared it modestly."

"For a company that made it to the KOSPI after five years, celebrating modestly is not enough."

"What does making it to the KOSPI mean? Father has built the business up to the group level. So, we can't settle for less here. I have to lead the group from now on."

As Ma Kyung-rok spoke, he looked at his brothers with a victorious gaze, with a smile that bordered on mockery on his lips.

'Damn bastard...!'

'If only he wasn't the eldest!'

While the brothers clenched their fists, unaware of the brewing tension, Ma Dong-won laughed heartily.

"Hahaha! Is this what the future heir of Osung Group looks like? Confidence is necessary to inherit the group!"

Ma Dong-won, patting Ma Kyung-rok on the shoulder as if pleased, looked at his elder brother.

"Brother, do we still need to worry about the eldest son?"

"No need. With such clear achievements, what's there to worry about?"

"Isn't it beyond expectations? Your condition was to be in the top 30 on the KOSDAQ."

"Exactly. I never thought we'd be listed on the KOSPI like this. You did really well."

Under their father's praise, Ma Kyung-rok wore a proud smile.

"Thank you, Chairman."

Feeling rewarded for his hard work as his father praised him, he didn't notice that his brothers were contorting their faces in dissatisfaction.

Father didn't bring them here to reconcile; it felt more like they were here to be scolded.

Although Ma Dae-cheol's true intention was different.

"Sons, envy, covet, and be jealous of your brother. That will be the driving force to make you stronger."

In reality, Ma Dae-cheol had no intention of reconciling the brothers.

He didn't expect that to happen.

He just wanted to provide a foundation for their growth by showcasing the eldest son's achievements and stimulating them.
ChatGPT

That was the reason why he brought the two sons to this place.

"Now, stimulated Kyung-sang and Kyung-su will work hard and make an effort to catch up with their older brother," he thought.

But Ma Dae-cheol didn't know.

Bringing the brothers here had actually added fuel to the fire.

"By the way, brother. Isn't it time you told us?"

"About what?"

"Your nickname, brother."

In response to Ma Kyung-sang's question, Ma Kyung-rok fell silent.

Not that the three brothers were all players in their twenties.

Therefore, they well understood the significance of revealing a nickname.

"Do these guys seriously want to track me down?"

Revealing a nickname was akin to exposing one's face behind a mask. It provided a pretext for tracking.

In the realm where one could stab a knife in someone's back and leave the body without punishment, revealing a nickname served the same purpose.

"Why would they want to track me? To kill me?"

The only reason for asking the nickname was that.

So, he hadn't disclosed it until now.

"What does it matter what my nickname is?"

"Just curious, you know."

"What about your nickname then?"

"Hey, don't you know Jang Yuyu? You should tell us yours first."

"It's Black Scythe."

"Stop messing around."

"Is it true?"

"Seriously?"

"You're kidding. Can you prove it right here?"

"There's a new duel request feature. Have you heard about it?"

"Yeah."

"I'll challenge you both. Win against us without using weapons or skills, just bare-handed. If you really are the Black Scythe, you should be able to handle that, right?"

As everyone reached level 60, the duel request feature had become available. Having experienced it before, they knew how it worked.

They could also wager something valuable through duels.

"If we win, step down from the heir position. But if you win, we'll cleanly acknowledge it as well."

"Fighting against us 2 to 1?"

"Yeah. Why not? Not confident? Mr. Black Scythe?"

It was a taunt, but Ma Kyung-rok couldn't respond.

Fighting bare-handed without weapons or skills? Even with superior skills, he had no confidence in winning under such unfavorable conditions.

"Fine, I lied a bit. I'm not Black Scythe. Satisfied?"

"Well then. What kind of nonsense is Black Scythe, brother?"
ChatGPT

"Why are you bullshitting around, acting like you won't be exposed as a fool in no time?"

"What?"

As insults flew, Ma Kyung-rok's expression turned fierce.

In turn, the brothers also gave cold glares.

"What the hell are you guys doing?"

Seeing this situation unfold quietly, Ma Dae-cheol couldn't help but get angry.

"All of you! What are you blabbering about duels and thunderbolts for? Did you come here to fight among brothers?"

"Yeah, we told you we didn't want to come."

"But Father insisted on bringing us here till the end."

"What, what is this!"

Although the chairman scolded, the brothers didn't bat an eyelash.

Back in the day, they had to be cautious as the heir hadn't been decided. But now, wasn't it different?

Ma Kyung-rok had shown outstanding achievements, and the situation had already been decided for him to be the heir.

"To be honest, I don't know why they brought us here."

"If you're going to say some old-fashioned thing like 'Look up to your brother,' we're leaving."

"You little..."

"Hey, what kind of words are those, sons!"

Although Ma Dong-won tried to stop them, the two had already made up their minds.

"Kyung-rok, be careful on your way home. Don't be too boastful just because you survived up to the 13th round."

"What?"

"If your head is too swollen, remember that it's likely to hit a rock and fall over someday."

The brothers left, leaving behind offensive remarks.

"Calling those brats my sons... Damn it, these little devils."

"Brother! Are you okay?"

Ma Dong-won, supporting Ma Dae-cheol, called out to the silent Ma Kyung-rok.

"What are you doing? Support your father!"

"Oh, yes."

Ma Kyung-rok was supporting his father but had a somewhat vacant expression.

It was because he was contemplating the words of his brothers.

"Be careful on your way home? Falling over on a rock?!"

It was clearly a vulgar joke and a threat.

"These damn bastards. Instead of congratulating me, they say such things to me?"

Sigh-

Despite being blood-related, there were no good memories between the brothers.

"Inferior to others."

After receiving threats of murder, the back of Ma Kyung-rok's neck tingled.

Recently, Ma Kyung-rok had been under an extraordinary amount of stress.

Was that the reason?
ChatGPT

Ma Kyung-rok entertained a thought he shouldn't have.

"Should I take out those bastards before they catch me and kill them first?"

It wasn't a genuine threat in his mind.

After all, those guys still had plans to kill him.

Because that way, the position of the heir would be available to them.

And there would be an opportunity for them as well.

"Until now, they probably thought I would fail Father's mission. They wouldn't have expected the company to grow this much. Maybe they thought I would die on my own during the rounds."

But now the situation had changed.

"I'm not just waiting to die in this otherworld. They must be desperate, not knowing how long they can survive."

So, he left with such a sincere threat.

Truly thinking that he might have to kill his own brothers.

"Do they really think I'll just let them attack me? They don't know me at all."

With a cynical smile, Ma Kyung-rok was determined to kill his brothers for real.

All of this without realizing that someone else might be reading his thoughts.

"Ah. Why is the atmosphere like this?"

Arriving at the company after receiving Ma Kyung-rok's invitation, Ryu Min couldn't pretend not to know.

Because he witnessed the conflict between Ma Kyung-rok and his brothers.

So, she used transparency and approached while reading their thoughts.

"Anyway, being born into a chaebol isn't all that great, is it?"

Sibling disputes over family wealth were such a common cliche that one would be disappointed if it didn't appear in a drama.

"Would you really want to fight among family members over the heir issue in a situation where your life is at stake?"

No, it might be more because of the thought that they should enjoy themselves before dying unexpectedly.

"Looks like the chairman has no intention of changing the heir."

He had already firmly established Ma Kyung-rok as the next heir in his mind.

It made sense.

The eldest son had shown achievements beyond expectations by getting listed on the KOSPI. How could he not be pleased?

"Meanwhile, it seems like the other brothers, afraid that they might back down, called him for a stimulant, but it backfired."

After parting with a warning to be careful on his way home, she read the thoughts of the brothers.

They really wanted to kill Ma Kyung-rok.esponse do you prefer?
