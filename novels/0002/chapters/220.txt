Title: "Episode 220 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max Level Player"

God-Grade Shoes

"Mana Tree Branch of Mandragora, Adamantium Plate, Advanced Material Leather, Wind Spirit Feather, Core of Mana, and 2 Black Iron Powders, correct?"

Ryumin nodded as he checked the materials brought by Heimer.

"Yes, that's right. How much for all of them?"

"Um, wait a moment, let me calculate...."

Heimer, calculating on an abacus, hesitated at the unexpectedly high amount.

"Well, don't be surprised. The total value for these 7 materials is 5,932,900 gold...."

Russell, not the one directly involved but still the one shocked by the almost 6 million gold, had a face of disbelief.

"W-Why are the materials so expensive?"

"They are rare and hard-to-obtain materials. We barely managed to acquire them ourselves."

"Still, each one costing over 800,000 gold...."

Russell, who couldn't believe it, looked at Heimer as if he were a swindler.

Heimer, who had fallen from being a craftsman to a swindler, wore a world-weary expression.

Of course, Ryumin trusted Heimer and didn't question the price.

"At this level, it's a fair price. These materials are even used for god-grade items."

It wasn't a bad deal considering it was less than 1 million gold per piece.

After all, Ryumin had around 65 million gold, which had accumulated exponentially since capturing the angel.

"For now, it might seem useless other than buying materials, but there will be a use for everything later."

Especially since it could be useful in Round 17, the more gold, the better.

"Isn't the amount too absurd? Take some time to think about it..."

"I'll buy them."

"You've thought well. Then let's forget about this... huh?"

"I said I'll buy them. The materials."

Heimer's surprised eyes opened wide, wondering if it was really possible.

"This amount is something even the Hormos Merchant Union wouldn't readily pay."

"We can make a deal since I have plenty of gold."

Soon, a trade window appeared before them.

[Feel free to imagine the items or gold you want to offer to the other party.]

└ Items to Trade: None

└ Gold to Trade: 5,932,900G

☞ Confirm Trade ☜
ChatGPT

└ Items to Trade: Mana Tree Branch of Mandragora, Adamantium Plate, Advanced Material Leather, Wind Spirit Feather, Core of Mana, 2 Black Iron Powders
└ Gold to Trade: 0 G

☞ Confirm Trade ☜

[After placing the items, press the 'Confirm Trade' button. Trade will only be completed with mutual agreement.]

As the trade button was pressed, a swishing sound accompanied the withdrawal of gold, and the materials were deposited into the inventory.

Ryumin's lips curled up in satisfaction.

"With these, I've acquired all the materials needed to craft god-grade shoes and weapons. Oh, except for one thing."

The crucial material, Condensed Aether, wasn't sold by Heimer, so Ryumin had to obtain it directly.

"For now, I can make god-grade shoes right away since I have one Aether obtained from killing Sariel."

Although he wanted to craft god-grade weapons first, weapons required two Condensed Aethers.

"I wonder if I can get them by defeating two Archangels, just like before?"

It was uncertain whether Archangels would appear in this round.

"Hehe, truly buying goods. How did someone like you amass such wealth ahead of others?"

"I got lucky."

Ignoring Heimer, who chuckled at the simple answer, Ryumin shook hands with him.

"Now that our business is done, I'll be on my way."

"It was nice meeting you. Take care."

"I enjoyed it too, Blacksmith Heimer. Russell is diligently learning by your side. See you again in three hours after some time."

"Why are you coming back? For what reason?"

"I want to see the enhanced abilities of Russell."

"Alright. I'll work hard and wait for your return."

"Okay then. Goodbye."

"Take care!"

Nodding, Ryumin left the forge.

Fluttering-

Dark wings emerged from his back, lifting him into the sky.

Ryumin pondered where to spend his time while Russell completed the quest.

"I've already cleared the round, and all tasks are done."

He couldn't just play around, so he considered doing some sub-quests.

Thinking about what would be good for the future, he reached a conclusion.

"If I'm going to do quests, I guess it's best to focus on the Mercenary Unit."

Currently, Ryumin's Mercenary Unit was at the Veteran level.
ChatGPT

After reaching the next rank, 'Master,' one gains the qualification to hunt dragons.

"I must definitely defeat a dragon. Considering the items, titles, and runes that come out of it..."

When a dragon is killed, god-grade accessories are obtained.

Since one of the essential 18 runes and a title come out, there's no reason not to kill it.

"But I can't just go and kill it now. The unknown barrier is blocking access."

Knowing the dragon's nest doesn't mean you can go hunting immediately.

Just like you can't forcefully enter the Elsorium's treasure warehouse, it's impossible to enter.

The only way to enter is to raise the Mercenary Unit rank to Master.

"No need to worry. I just need to raise it one more step."

By completing sub-quests for the Mercenary Unit, he should be able to raise it quickly.

Being at the Veteran rank, the rewards were more generous than other sub-quests, so there was no reason to hesitate.

"I've arrived."

Thud-

Landing on the ground, Ryumin had flown for about 10 minutes to reach the destination – the Albic Kingdom.

Since the Golden Eagle Mercenary Unit had branches in every city, there was no need to go far.

"Now, before doing the Mercenary Unit quest..."

Ryumin opened the crafting window.

[Main Material]

High-Quality Leather Boots

[Sub Materials]

Condensed Aether

Black Iron Powder

Mana Tree Branch of Mandragora

Advanced Material Leather

Wind Spirit Feather

"Shall I try making a god-grade item?"

Unable to craft a weapon right away, he decided to make shoes first.

[Currently crafting a god-grade item.] [Will be transformed into an item suitable for the current profession.] [Crafting successful!] [Created 'Thanatos Boots.'] [Thanatos Boots]

ChatGPT
Set Effect (5): ????

Thanatos Boots have good stats, but the ability to walk through the air is excellent.

"As long as it's dark, there's no limit to how freely I can move through the air."

Jumping into the air and bouncing off the air as a foothold to descend is possible.

One can move as desired in the air, zigzagging through the sky.

It's like creating another field, making it efficient in various ways.

The added set effect, reducing received damage by 30%, was also quite good.

"With this, it's the fourth one. Now, once I find a weapon, I'll have all the materials to craft god-grade items."

Other god-grade accessories can be obtained by hunting boss monsters, such as dragons.

"I need to raise the Mercenary Unit rank quickly."

Ryumin urged his steps with the Golden Eagle Mercenary Unit.

[Chirp.] [Laguel, relax your face a bit.]

Ranked 5th, Laguel, the Archangel of justice, fairness, and harmony.

But now, he wore all kinds of expressions that were unfitting for his title.

"No, Lord Uriel! Isn't this a bit much? We have to move in pairs just to capture one human. What's so scary about such bug-like humans!"

The reason for Laguel's complaints was clear.

The two of them capturing one human in the other realm hurt their pride.

It was a bitter reality.

"I'm puzzled too. How strong can humans be?" "Right? Lord Uriel, you didn't need to come out for this."

"But what can I do? I can't refuse when even Lord Gabriel and Lord Raphael agree."

"What's going on in their minds, making us take unnecessary steps..."

"In the eyes of the higher-ups, it might have seemed safer for the two of us to go."

"I can't deny that."

"Well, I wonder if they remember how active I was in the last Celestial War..."

Though currently at the bottom, Laguel's combat power was on a different level compared to the 6th and 7th ranks below.

In the 5th Celestial War 200 years ago, Laguel slew countless demons with his sense of justice.
ChatGPT

Remembering his previous major, Uriel nodded with a face that acknowledged it.

"I know. I know, and the higher-ups know too. You, who received recognition for your efforts back then and became a 1st-rank angel, even reaching the position of Archangel."

"But why...!"

"Perhaps you just wanted to end it definitively. There's always the possibility of the worst-case scenario, right?"

"Do you think I'm doing this while knowing my abilities? Such bugs can be handled by me alone!"

"Those guys who were so confident, where are they now? It's all dark, with no news of where they've hidden."

"...."

"If I send you alone, the success rate would be 99%, but sending both of you ensures a 100% successful conclusion. That's why the higher-ups insisted on sending you together, even though it wasn't necessary for me to join."

"But..."

"Until now, I sent you alone, and look at the situation now. It was a wise decision considering the possibility."

With calm and logical words, Uriel persuaded, but Laguel still had a stubborn expression.

"But I could handle those bugs alone..."

Understanding Laguel's muttering, Uriel made a suggestion.

"How about this then? I'll give you the chance to fight first. I'll just watch from behind."

At those words, Laguel's scrunched-up face relaxed for a moment.

"Really?" "But if it seems dangerous, I'll intervene immediately. Don't have any complaints if I join the battle during the fight?" "Ah! Don't worry about that! There won't be a situation where Uriel has to step in. I can handle it perfectly from my end!" "Then let's do that." "Thanks for the concession. Hehe!" "Thanks for what."

Watching Laguel confidently declare, Uriel offered one more thing.

"What if we do it this way? I'll give you the opportunity to fight first. I'll just observe from the rear."

At those words, Laguel's scrunched-up face relaxed for a moment.

"Really?" "But if it seems dangerous, I'll intervene immediately. Don't have any complaints if I join the battle during the fight?" "Ah! Don't worry about that! There won't be a situation where Uriel has to step in. I can handle it perfectly from my end!" "Then let's do that." "Thanks for the concession. Hehe!" "Thanks for what."

Watching Laguel confidently declare, Uriel offered one more thing.

"If you want to go first, then go ahead. I'll watch from behind. However, if it seems too dangerous, I'll jump in right away. Don't complain if I join the battle."

"Ah! Don't worry about that! There won't be a situation where Uriel has to step in. I can handle it perfectly from my end!"

"Alright, let's go with that."

"Thanks for conceding. Hehe!"

"Thanks for what."

Observing Laguel's confident proclamation, Uriel smiled with a benevolent expression on the surface. However, beneath the surface, he was holding back a mocking laughter.

"I'll let Laguel fight first to see how skilled this human with the name 'Black Scythe' really is. Judging by what happened to Remiel and Sariel, Black Scythe is definitely not an ordinary human. Even looking at the results of the rounds in the record room, he consistently achieved the top rank. Quite an extraordinary human."
ChatGPT

Dismissing him as just an insignificant bug would surely lead to a rude awakening.

"The only relief is that he's not yet at the maximum level."

The combat power of a max-level player is comparable to that of a 6th-rank Combat Angel.

Yet, Black Scythe managed to kill Archangels, and not just one but two.

"While I know that level doesn't necessarily determine strength, at least Laguel should be able to handle him alone. If things get tough, I can step in."

It felt somewhat absurd for two Archangels to face an ordinary human, but what could be done? The situation required a decisive resolution.

"I shouldn't let my guard down. For now, let Laguel fight first and gauge the situation before intervening."

Facing two Archangels against an insignificant human might seem ridiculous, but the urgency of the situation demanded a swift conclusion.

"I can't afford to be careless. If needed, I'll step in after letting Laguel fight first."

Though unlikely, what if the situation surpasses even Laguel's capabilities?

"In that case, I should retreat without looking back."

Whether Laguel lives or dies, it's not something he needs to concern himself with. Even for an Archangel, life is precious.

"Now, shall we go, Lord Uriel?" "Yes. Track the location of Black Scythe. Let's go catch him."

The two angels began to flap their wings, grinning brightly.
