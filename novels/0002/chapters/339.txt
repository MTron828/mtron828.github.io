Title: Episode 339 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

101st Round (3)

In the previous round, in the 18th round, Ryumin had killed Micael and became a god.

'But now, in the 14th round, I've become a god again. I've advanced the goal by four rounds.'

Having killed all seven Archangels early on, all threats were eliminated.

Now, there would be no need for Plutonictos to approach due to the Devil's Resurrection, and Chaos would not detect anything.

There would be no surprise attacks from Gabriel and Raphael on their younger brother in the future, and reasons to fight with Artaros disappeared.

'If they don't realize what I did.'

Therefore, Ryumin quickly left his place.

Threatening a combat angel at the training camp, he returned to the other world without delay.

At that moment, Milen, waiting for Gabriel's contact, was about to proceed with the round.

Why haven't you contacted me? The promised time has passed!

The thoughts of the angel who reluctantly proceeded with the round could be heard.

'Luckily, I can proceed with the round without delay.'

As a player, he couldn't skip rounds.

Killing the seven Archangels didn't mean it was all over.

└ Kill Gods

└ Current number of killed gods (0/4)

└ Success ▶ ?????

'This is what's left.'

Now he had to kill the gods, only four of them.

'Because Luvahhi said that's the way to resist Chaos.'

Killing four gods was said to be the completion of the scythe-like weapon called the Black Scythe.

That was also the reason for the divine transformation.

He had quickly killed the Archangels for this reason.

'I can't avoid the eyes of Chaos forever.'

As the ultimate goal was the destruction of Chaos, he couldn't just cower forever.

He had to assassinate the gods while being careful not to attract Chaos's attention.

That was his plan for the future.

'To do that, I need to get the Transcendence Runes first.'

To grow beyond the max level, as soon as the 14th round ended, Ryumin declared a bomb to the public.

"I, Ryumin, have decided to return my property of 990 billion won to society."

The property and gold were already prepared.
ChatGPT

After selling shares of the Magyeongrok company, Ryumin earned a fortune of 1 trillion and collected 160 billion gold by defeating the Archangels.

'I've secured the same amount as before. So, this time, I can only expect the same rune to come out.'

After revealing his identity, he donated 99 billion and also shared gold with the Death Cult.

As expected, the Transcendence Rune came in.

'Now I can gain experience from all enemies. The limits of levels have disappeared.'

He obtained the desired rune.

Now, he needed to prepare Eternal items.

In the 17th round, he defeated the Black Dragon Carseionox and obtained Eternal materials.

Like before, the design emitted the aura of death, but he ignored it.

'What I need right now is the Soul Gauntlet that can take away the abilities of the gods.'

It would be more useful than the aura of death.

With all the materials collected, he immediately crafted the Soul Gauntlet.

'Now, the preparations for the hunt are complete.'

The first god to be Ryumin's target was Plutonictos.

As soon as the 18th round began, he went to the Demon Castle and killed him.

With 10 billion experience gained, he quickly rose to level 205.

'Incredible.'

Originally, at this timing, Artaros would have appeared and interfered, but that didn't happen.

'He still doesn't know about my existence.'

The fact that Artaros is not moving means Chaos is the same.

Relieved, Ryumin immediately took the throne and summoned the demon nobles.

[Player 'Black Scythe' has taken the throne of the Demon Castle.] [Exploring eligibility to challenge the position of the Demon King.]

............

[Conditions have been met.] [Testing eligibility for the Demon King's position immediately.]

The demon nobles who participated in the 18th round rushed in at the sudden message.

Amidst the war, there was curiosity to see which devil without any sense of morality would aim for the throne.

However, the one who ascended the throne was not a demon but a human.

So, each demon, upon seeing the unexpected sight, burst into ridiculous laughter, but only for a moment.

In just a few minutes, the nobles were sorted out, and, as before, only a few demons, including Citri, were spared.
ChatGPT

[You have become the Demon King.] [You can now rule the Demon Realm.] [All subjects of the Demon Realm will unquestionably obey your commands.] [Congratulations on becoming the new Demon King!]

"Don't use that tone. It's cringy."

Returning to the battlefield, Ryumin could easily handle the demons.

"Don't resist. I'll send you quickly."

[Grraaah!] [Kyaaah!]

It was a staggering scene of the Demon King slaughtering his subordinates, but no demon dared to oppose the Demon King's orders.

[Experience +102,919] [Experience +192,990] [Experience +162,929]

............

............

Originally, demons who wouldn't receive anything, Ryumin was able to gain experience points.

'I've already reached level 230. It was a good decision to get the Transcendence Rune early.'

Though the number of demons decreased rapidly, it was too early to celebrate.

After reducing their numbers to some extent, Ryumin switched sides and killed thousands of angels.

'I can't miss the opportunity to earn tens of thousands of stats.'

Blessed by the demons with stats and experience points, Ryumin easily finished the 18th round, killing two birds with one stone.

"Minah, what happened? In the 18th round, it seemed like the demons were listening to you?"

"That's... well."

Curious Minjuri, Ryumin truthfully explained that he had become the Demon King.

Now, lies were out of the question.

Fortunately, Minjuri was only surprised and didn't say anything.

She didn't doubt or question him.

Perhaps because he had revealed his identity earlier, Minjuri showed unconditional trust in Ryumin's words.

'Now I have to go to the Demon Realm.'

Checking the time, Ryumin secretly warped to the Demon Realm.

Moros would come to the Demon Castle shortly.

There wasn't any particular reason.

It was to obtain information from Plutonictos.

'Since I bet everything on the victory of the demons, I can't just sit still.'

In the previous round, Moros had also sought Plutonictos.

He came to check if the preparations for war were going well but ended up having a headache because of the Black Scythe.

He confirmed the information about Huh Taeseok, indirectly helping by suggesting that manipulating the twisted mind of that human would be more effective in eliminating the Black Scythe's companions.

It might be an action to win the bet, but now that he knew the guy was Chaos's puppet, he couldn't let him live.
ChatGPT

"You are my second target, Moros."

He already knew when Moros would appear, thanks to Luvahhi's records.

Sure enough, Moros appeared with precise timing, accompanied by the sound of footsteps.

"Hey, Plutonictos! You have a guest, and you're not even welcoming them properly. Isn't that a bit too much... Huh?"

Moros's footsteps halted.

The Demon King's throne had shrunk to human size.

"What? Why did the throne's size change..."

Feeling a moment of unease, Moros turned around, but it was already too late.

Ryumin's scythe had deeply torn through Moros's chest.

[Kyaaaah!]

"You have good instincts."

He had aimed to sever the neck in one blow, but Moros turned, resulting in only an injury.

[Neiieeee!]

Enraged, Moros spread his wings like a bat, transforming into a shadow of darkness.

A hissing aura covered the area, but Ryumin remained unfazed.

He just swung the scythe.

Slish-!

[Cough, haaack!]

Ryumin, who had overwhelmed even the god of war, Artaros, wasn't intimidated.

Whether transformed or whatever, all were equal before the scythe.

[Experience +3,000,000,000] [The gained experience has exceeded 100,000.] [Experience is exchanged for 30,000 stat points.]

With an enormous amount of experience, level-up messages flooded in.

[You have reached level 310!] [From now on, the amount of stats gained per level-up increases to 24!]

[You have reached level 320!] [From now on, the amount of stats gained per level-up increases to 25!]

Killing Moros also resulted in a rapid level-up.

He gained new abilities.

[Soul Gauntlet absorbs the soul of the slain deity.] [The soul 'Moros' has been stored in the gauntlet.] [Extracting the abilities of the soul 'Moros.'] [...Extraction successful!] [Learned a new temporary skill 'Time of Ruin!'] [Temporary Skill - Time of Ruin]

Effect: Locate the position of an opponent with an evil heart and dominate their mind.

Can only be used against opponents with a lower caliber.

'What does caliber mean in this context?'
ChatGPT

"Since it works only against opponents with a lower caliber, it arouses curiosity, but it doesn't matter much."

Why not try it on the opponent you want to dominate?

There's no penalty for using it.

'My level has increased enormously. Even more than when I killed Nemesis.'

Satisfied with his level, which had reached 323, Ryumin decided to target Nemesis next.

With Sitri's help, as before, he traced Nemesis to the Celestial Realm and killed her without much ado.

└ Kill a god

└ Current number of gods killed (3/4)

└ Success leads to ▶ ????

'Now, just one more to kill?'

The gods Ryumin knows are only two, Chaos and Nyx.

'It's impossible to catch Chaos, so I need to find Nyx.'

Though he hadn't met Nyx in person, he recalled Nyx's face from Artaros's memories.

[Face and name match. Tracing the target.] [The target is in an unreachable dimension.] [Unable to determine the location of the target 'Nyx.']

However, a message stating it's impossible due to different dimensions appeared.

'What should I do? We need to kill one more quickly to stand against Chaos....'

There's no time to hesitate.

Ryumin quickly found the Akashic Record.

And using the Akashic Record entrance ticket received as a reward for killing the seven Archangels, he opened the door.

Kurrung-

As he entered, Luvahhi greeted him.

A surprised expression, not expecting him so soon.

[Black Scythe. You came earlier than I thought.]

"How have you been, Luvahhi?"

[It feels a bit awkward, pretending not to know someone I've never met before.]

Regression affects not only all creatures but also the gods.

The sentient being Luvahhi is no exception.

So, their meeting is practically the first.

An awkward reaction is natural.

However, as if knowing everything, Luvahhi spoke.

"I already knew that I had regressed?"

[Yes. The details of the contract we made were clearly written in the Soul Contract.]

Thanks to the Soul Contract that was not affected by regression, Luvahhi could tell that Black Scythe had regressed 101 times.

[You carried out the plan as planned, capturing the Archangels and progressing to godhood. The gods are hunting smoothly as well.]
ChatGPT

"Yeah. I've left only one now."

[You're planning to catch Nyx.]

"Well, it seems like I couldn't trace her, probably in a different dimension or something."

[So, you've come to seek my help?]

"Yeah, that's the idea."

[In that case, welcome. According to the records, Nyx is harboring doubts due to Plutonictos's absence. It seems she plans to visit the Demon King's castle soon.]

"Good. When do you think she'll come?"

[Wait between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. four days from now. Considering your schedule, she won't come before that.]

"Got it. How about Chaos? Any signs of movement yet?"

[Yes. He is still unaware of your existence... but still, you should prepare for the worst. Given that you've even killed gods, it's only a matter of time before Chaos becomes aware.]

"Is that so? Can't be helped. I'll have to prepare the measures you suggested."

It's inevitable that he won't be able to avoid Chaos's notice forever. He needs a plan for when they eventually cross paths. Well, he had already discussed this with Luvahhi in a previous encounter.

"If what you said is true, then even if Chaos appears, I can stop him, right?"

[Yes. After killing gods and completing the soul-binding quest, you'll have a more solid countermeasure.]

He asked to confirm, but it wouldn't be a lie. The contract explicitly states that lying results in annihilation.

"Understood. I'll come again if something happens."

[I'll be watching from here. Good luck. Guardian of Gaia.]

Ryumin, emerging from the Akashic Record, smirked.

'Guardian of Gaia, huh. Well, better than being called a toy.'

Still, Ryumin couldn't help but feel displeased.
