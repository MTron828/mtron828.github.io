Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 302"

"The Devil's Touch"

When he first heard about the 19th round mission,

Heo Taeseok felt desire wriggling in his heart.

A very, very nasty desire.

'This is an opportunity. An opportunity to kill the guy I don't like.'

The player Heo Taeseok had been targeting all along was none other than Alex Pearson.

There had been conflicts with that chubby guy, a fact known to Eom Junseok and the Black Scythe.

Therefore, he didn't move directly.

He observed the situation a bit more before deciding to act.

However,

[The fifteenth death has occurred.] [The deceased's nickname is 'RaiChaCha.'] [Since 10 minutes have passed after death, we will proceed to eliminate the player.] [Current remaining players: 128] [Eliminated players: 15] [Time remaining until the end of the round: 70:27:19]

Only an hour and a half had passed, and already 15 people had died.

'That means they killed each other.'

To point a knife at yesterday's colleague without mercy.

Indeed, people can kill each other depending on the situation.

Just like Heo Taeseok now.

'I should start killing slowly.'

Heo Taeseok, who was killing monsters in the nearby forest, made up his mind.

To track Alex.

[Facial features and nickname match. Tracking the target's location.] [Player 'Alex's location has been identified.] [Currently 2,038m away.] [To track the target, follow the arrows in front of you.]

Surprisingly, the distance between them was not that far.

'It seems the gods are on my side.'

Let's quickly kill that unlucky bastard and erase the traces of the body.

Then there will be no evidence.

Even if the Black Scythe and Eom Chugyung suspect me, there won't be any problems. If they grab me without knowing, that's the end.

With a twisted smile on his lips, Heo Taeseok closed the distance.

It must have been about 20 minutes.

By the time they had added another death, filling up to 20.

He saw that the distance with Alex had become close to 500m.

'If I go within 500m, it will likely trigger a nearby exploration.'

Perhaps, seeing the distance between himself and the target getting closer on the tracking list, Alex might already be suspicious.

'I'd better quickly approach and finish it off decisively before he has time to react.'

Heo Taeseok, with demonic transformation activated, was about to cast a demonization spell.

"[Moros mentioned that a human was here.]"

Startled by the suddenly heard eerie voice, Heo Taeseok blinked his eyes.

Wondering if he might be seeing things.

"Why are you standing there frozen like that? It's not like it's your first time seeing a demon."

Height of 2m, red skin, wings, and a long tail.

The being that appeared before his eyes was unmistakably a demon.

It seemed ordinary at first glance, but Heo Taeseok instinctively felt that it was not an easy opponent.

And it was no surprise.

"Do you want me to introduce myself? Fine."

The demon laughed, releasing a sinister aura.

"I am Flunictos, the demon lord of the abyss."

Before the start of the 19th round.

Upon hearing Artaros's plan, Flunictos furrowed his brow.

"So, you're saying to buy him time to recover his strength, right?"

Arartos said that he currently had no power, having gone through dozens of deaths with considerable penalties.

"To recover strength, time is needed. So, you have to step up, Flunictos, until my strength returns."

"But with my abilities, I can't handle the Black Scythe, as you well know. Even Arartos himself broke in the process..."

Arartos's gaze momentarily turned fierce, but Flunictos didn't back down.

He had something to say.
ChatGPT

"[If you tell me to buy time, I will. But I don't want to die like this, especially at the hands of a human.] [When did I say you would die like this?] [Just now, after telling me to...?] [It doesn't mean a direct confrontation.] [Then...?] [It means breaking their mental state.] [Huh?] [In the 19th round, kill all the colleagues that guy values. Never engage in a direct battle.]"

In short, it was a suggestion to deplete all resources except for the Black Scythe.

"If that's the case, no problem. Hehehe."

Flunictos and Artaros both smiled at the same time.

After finishing the recollection, Flunictos looked at the human in front of him.

The trembling figure in fear was quite pitiful.

"Is your nickname NopainNogain?"

"H-How did you...?"

In another realm, nicknames shouldn't be visible, so how did he recognize it?

Although Heo Taeseok looked at him with such a expression, Flunictos had no intention of revealing the information.

He wasn't thoughtless enough to casually disclose information obtained from the gods.

'According to the information Moros gave me, this human is filled with wicked grudges.'

He could tell that this was clearly someone consumed by a desire for revenge.

Even though he was trembling in fear now, there was no way the demon lord himself, filled with malicious intent, couldn't sense the hidden malice within.

"Weak human. Where were you heading?"

"..."

"It looks like you're going to kill someone. Am I right?"

Pierced to the core, Heo Taeseok visibly hesitated.

However, after suppressing the apparent confusion, he aimed his staff at the demon in front of him.

A smirk escaped Flunictos's mouth.

"Humans are foolish. They don't even know what kind of being they're facing and rashly point their weapons."

"Don't make me regret saying that."

But before Heo Taeseok could launch an attack, Flunictos's eyes glowed a deep red.

"Ugh!"

A heavy pressure crushed Heo Taeseok's entire body.

Forced by Flunictos's telekinetic power, he knelt and hunched over.

"Kuuuuh!"

He tried to resist, but it was futile.

He collapsed to the ground unimpressively like a flattened frog.

'I, I can't move at all.'

In a state where he couldn't even twitch, Heo Taeseok struggled before giving up.

It was difficult to withstand a magical blow in this state.

He simply couldn't repel the intangible force with his own strength.

"Weak human. Do you want power?"

"..."

"Don't worry. I didn't come to kill you. Quite the opposite, in fact."
ChatGPT

Flunictos, with a sly smile, released his telekinetic grip.

Heo Taeseok, freed from confinement, groaned as he struggled to get up.

Then, he looked at the demon with a bewildered expression, wondering why he had been released.

Fortunately, the answer came easily as Flunictos spoke bluntly.

"I will grant you power. A power stronger than what you have now. Use that power to seek the revenge you desire."

"What...?"

Before he could ask for more details, Flunictos's tail stabbed Heo Taeseok's forehead.

Pwook!

"Ughhh!"

His head turned pale, and his body lost all strength.

However, he didn't die. Instead, the existing power drained away, replaced by an unfamiliar, new force.

"I told you, I won't kill you. However..."

"Aaaargh!"

"It will be a bit painful."

"Oh, so listen to this?"

"It's too heavy for me."

"I need this for safety, idiot!"

At Sofia's shout, Victor remained silent, avoiding eye contact.

To an observer, Sofia might seem like an older sister, but strictly speaking, she was the younger one.

While understanding his sister's concern for him, Victor really didn't want to carry a shield.

"I hardly invested in strength stats, so it's too heavy."

"Still, carry it! That's the only way to survive!"

"You don't need that. I have a sturdy shield right here. What's the worry?"

Seeing Victor's expression, Sofia sighed.

Stubbornness of this magnitude was beyond frustrating.

"Even thinking like that is messed up! Prioritize your own safety. Don't cling to me!"

"When did I cling to you? You were the one who came to me!"

"Ugh!"

Sofia, disheveled, shouted into the air before eventually giving up on offering the shield.

She rationalized having a shield herself.

"Ugh, arguing with my brother drains all my energy."

"If it's tough, let me know. I've made plenty of healing potions."

"If you can't talk properly... Ugh!"

The siblings passed the time bickering and arguing, knowing they had to survive for 72 hours without any need to wander unnecessarily.
ChatGPT

It's better not to waste stamina and just stay in a safe place.

With that thought, he settled in a suitable location without monsters and has been waiting for about 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Of course, he wasn't just idly sitting there. He focused on maintaining a vigilant attitude, deploying exploration skills, and checking the tracking list.

"Oh? Oppa, the distance with this person is getting closer?"

"Who?"

"This person at the top of the list here."

"Oh? I see."

"They're approaching our direction, right?"

Victor nodded silently.

While not certain, it seemed likely.

'Wait and see.'

He didn't think the approach was with ill intentions, especially since the person already had a face.

After a while.

"Hello."

As expected, the person listed approached Victor and his sister, Sophia.

"Are you Alex?"

"Hello, Victor. Sophia is here too, I see."

The three were from the same sect. Although they were members of the Sinsin Church, more importantly, Alex had personally come to Nigeria to form an elite team.

"Did you come to see our brother?"

"Yes. It's not with bad intentions, but... well..."

When Alex tried to explain, he hesitated, seemingly feeling awkward.

"Last time, during the 16th round, you saved my life with a Potion of Life. I'm grateful for that, and also for readily accepting my offer to join the elite team before. So, I came to express my thanks."

"Oh, so our brother didn't come to protect us. Is that right?"

In response to Sophia's pointed comment, Alex nodded, as if acknowledging the accuracy.

"Well, you can say it like that. Anyway..."

"You stay quiet for a bit."

Victor, scolding his sister, grinned at Alex.

"Thank you for coming to help. As you can see, being a potion-maker, meeting monsters is quite frightening. But with you, Alex, coming as well, it's even more reassuring. Thank you."

"Haha... don't mention it."

"By the way, how about the proposal to form an elite team?"

"Oh, didn't I mention it? Black Scythe said there's no need for that, so the plan fell through. It was unnecessary trouble, causing misunderstandings about creating a faction for no reason."
ChatGPT

"Misunderstanding? What happened?"

"We have plenty of time, so go ahead and talk."

The three of them gathered in one place and started discussing things that hadn't been fully addressed. In the process, they inadvertently made a mistake by not being vigilant of their surroundings.

Creak... creak...

"Since then, what happened... Oh? Wait a moment."

The first to notice the approaching figure was Alex. Someone had entered the range of his perception.

Victor and Sophia, sensing it as well, turned their heads in silence toward the direction of the person approaching them.

"That person is..."

"Oh, Master Hu?"

More than being surprised by the unexpected presence, they were more astonished by the state of Heo Taeseok.

"Groan, grumble..."

His condition left them more astonished than the unexpected presence itself.
