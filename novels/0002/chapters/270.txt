Title: Episode 270 of the 100th Regression for a Max-Level Player

Round 17 Begins

"Hey, Black Scythe!"

Huh Taeseok and Alex lowered their weapons with bewildered expressions.

Attacking the Black Scythe themselvesâ€”unintentional, but an unthinkable act.

"Are you okay!?"

"As you can see."

"Sorry. Black Scythe."

"By the way, how did we end up here...?"

In response to Huh Taeseok's question, Ryu Min only showed an invisible smile.

He couldn't possibly mention that he had tracked Alex after receiving a message from Eom Junsuk.

"I heard from Eom Junsuk. Alex is plotting a faction."

Although he didn't expect Alex to be fighting with Huh Taeseok.

"It doesn't matter how I got here. What matters is why you guys were fighting on the same side."

"Black Scythe. I can explain everything!"

Seizing the opportunity, Huh Taeseok pointed at Alex and explained to Ryu Min.

"Over the past week, this guy has been meeting followers for some reason. Dorothy, Victor, Sophia, Russell, Joo Yong-ho, and others. I personally witnessed him secretly meeting followers of different nationalities. It's clear that there's a sinister plot among the followers to create a faction and undermine our Sinners' Church!"

It sounded similar to what he had heard from Eom Junsuk, but the details were more detailed after his personal investigation.

"I can't ignore one side of the story after hearing the other."

Ryu Min's gaze turned to Alex.

"Alex."

"Yes, Black Scythe."

"Don't you have anything to say to me?"

Asked in fluent English, Alex expressed his discontent with a furrowed brow.

Pointing his staff at Huh Taeseok.

"Black Scythe! Be cautious of Archbishop Huh! He called me here with false messages and suddenly threatened me, binding me with skills as if he would kill me!"

"Do you know the reason?"

"I don't know. He keeps insisting that I confess to something, claiming there's someone plotting, but I've never done such a thing!"

"Hmm..."

Alex had a genuinely unjust expression.

Was what he said the truth?
ChatGPT

The Rune of Inner Thoughts is helpful at times like this.

You don't have to ponder whether the other person's words are true or not.

"It's the truth."

Even if he wore an unjust expression, once you doubted, you could endlessly doubt, but Alex was sincere.

"Contrary to your claim, Archbishop Huh is believed to be plotting something sinister from behind."

"Plotting? That's absurd!"

"You were seen contacting followers from around the world secretly, forming a faction covertly."

"Ah..."

"Is it true?"

"It's not true! I was planning to form a team, but..."

"You were planning to form a team?"

Alex willingly explained the reason he was gathering team members during the 16th round.

"I felt it when we all faced the monsters together in the 16th round. It's so powerful when we stick together. This is teamwork. But after seeing comrades being slaughtered by angels, I thought, teamwork can't last forever. We can't save all 576 people. It will decrease over time... only a small elite will survive."

Alex's voice sank like a soaked cotton ball.

"So, I decided. To form a team for more efficient operation. If we select skilled members and coordinate teamwork, it will be easier to survive, right?"

"It's impossible for all 288 members to coordinate teamwork, right?"

"Exactly. By selecting people who will be helpful in the future and forming a team like a small elite, we can respond more flexibly in times of crisis, don't you think?"

Ryu Min nodded in agreement.

Alex's argument was as follows:

To survive until the 20th round, pre-select superior talents and coordinate teamwork early on. It seemed somewhat rational in its own way, similar in meaning to what Ryu Min had done so far.

"So, you planned to gather people worthy of being elites and coordinate teamwork in advance."

"Yes. It was never about having ambitions for the leadership position or using it for malicious purposes."

"But Archbishop Huh doesn't think so. He believes that you are creating a faction to betray the Sinners' Church."

"Ha... Absolutely not! Why would I betray when I have nothing to gain? With Black Scythe present, what audacity do I have?"

Alex shouted as if feeling unjust, and his plea was sincere.

In fact, Alex even harbored the hope that forming a team would be helpful to Black Scythe.

"And everyone you met agreed with your opinion?"

"Yes. They all viewed my intentions positively and promised to willingly join such an intentional team."

Even if Dorothy and Sophia were not close, Victor, Russell, and Joo Yong-ho readily accepted?

Just from that, Ryu Min realized that Alex was a man worthy of trust.

However, leaving a personal team could not be allowed.

"I understand your intentions. However, because it doesn't look good, abandon the team. Haven't you already been mistaken for a traitor?"

"Well... that may be true, but in terms of efficiency, creating a team..."

"No, there's no need to coordinate teamwork. It won't be a problem. Anyway, I will handle all coordination, and as long as you follow my instructions, teamwork will be established. After all, the Sinners' Church itself is like a team."

"Th-that's true. If Black Scythe says so... I understand. I apologize for acting on my own."

Alex's apology was sincere.

But was it because of the language difference?

Huh Taeseok, with an expression that didn't seem to approve, asked if he couldn't feel that sincerity.

"Black Scythe. What did that guy say in defense?"

"He claims there's no conspiracy. He insists he is innocent."

"That can't be true. Making him confess, even through torture..."

"No need for that. It was a misunderstanding from the start."

"A misunderstanding?"

"I'll explain."

Ryu Min summarized the information he had heard from Alex and explained it to Huh Taeseok.

Although it was a reasonable explanation, Huh Taeseok still didn't seem to ease his impression.

"Lies! That guy is lying right now. Otherwise, why would he attack you first?"

In response to that statement, Ryu Min turned his head and looked at Alex.

"Did you attack Huh Taeseok first?"

"Yes."

"Why?"
ChatGPT

"I tried to save him. Can't you understand that, instead of attacking, I stared as if I were going to tie his limbs and kill him?"

Alex had responded from a defensive standpoint.

Although he translated this fact, Huh Taeseok still did not believe.

"Surely, you must be lying..."

"It's not a lie. I can tell. It seems there have been misunderstandings between us."

"..."

Having made the judgment, Huh Taeseok couldn't respond any further.

"Now that we understand it's a misunderstanding, let's reconcile."

He also said it in English to make sure both could hear, but there was only silence between the two.

"At least, say you're sorry?"

"I'm sorry."

"I apologize."

After showing a slightly awkward expression, the two apologized.

Watching the still reserved duo, Ryu Min clicked his tongue behind his mask.

"What kind of mess is this?"

Pulling out a knife to kill each other over a trivial misunderstanding.

"All this happens because we can't communicate."

Alex's actions were also at fault for acting suspiciously, but Huh Taeseok was also at fault for doubting without knowing the full situation.

"It seems like there was an intention to tie him up and make him confess by any means necessary..."

Ryu Min couldn't believe that they had acted like this over a mere suspicion.

He had never thought that Huh Taeseok's personality was so twisted.

Hm-

Ryu Min turned his eyes to examine Huh Taeseok's inner thoughts.

"Hmm?"

Curious to see if there was something, he found another misunderstanding entrenched in his mind.

It's time to clear this up.

"Huh Taeseok."

"Yes, Black Scythe."

"I'm telling you in case you misunderstand out of resentment, don't fixate on the order I called the names. It wasn't based on calling people I favor."

Huh Taeseok's eyes widened.

It was a statement that seemed to penetrate his inner thoughts.

"Oh, was it not? I called them in the order of importance... "

"No, until the third place, rewards are given, so it's appropriate to call the most contributing priest and buffer. However, after that, I just called whoever came to mind. There was no specific criterion for calling them."

"Ah..."
ChatGPT

"So, if you think I don't consider you important, it's a misunderstanding. Do you think I would disrespect the founder of the Sinners' Church, even though I'm not a fool?"

"Black Scythe..."

The eyes that were burning with anger just a while ago now turned into eyes filled with gratitude.

Huh Taeseok easily crumbled under a bit of sweet talk.

"Maybe he thought he was being treated like a mere follower."

With this, the misunderstanding between them was settled.

"Let's go. To the Sinners' Church."

Building up Hero Rune stacks is not such a difficult task.

Just gather the Sinners' Church members and eliminate the demon summoned with the Black Seed.

[Hero Rune Stacks: 100/100] [All stats increase by 100 with the effect of Hero Rune] [You can use 'Hero's Protection' by consuming 100 stacks.]

"Great. With this, I can protect my younger brother."

Satisfied, Ryu Min passed by Huh Taeseok, patting him on the shoulder.

"Well done, Archbishop Huh. It was a big help."

"Ah..."

Huh Taeseok didn't know exactly what help he had provided, but it didn't matter to him. The fact that he had been of assistance to the deity filled him with a heartwarming sense of pride.

"Sometimes, I should praise him like this."

Having grasped a late understanding of how to handle Huh Taeseok, Ryu Min smiled satisfactorily and stood on the platform.

To share strategies for Round 17.

May 1st, midnight.

Unlike the previous rounds, people woke up in the avatars' bodies.

"We returned to avatars after a few months, right?"

"Two months?"

"Has it only been that long? I felt like it was longer."

"It feels nice to start as an avatar."

Satisfaction was evident on people's faces as if they were wearing clothes that fit perfectly.

Now, it felt awkward not to open their eyes as avatars when entering the Otherworld.

"By the way, it's more comfortable without the translation device."

"Yeah, Max."

"Hi, Fernando."

"Hey, Mr. King, you're here?"

Did the number of people decrease?

Or was it because they all survived the crisis together in the previous round?

Despite differences in nationality, the Sinners' Church followers exchanged greetings with friendliness.

Among them, Min Juri and Kristin, who played prominent roles in the party, were the most popular.

"Hello, Buffer-nim?"

"Yes, hello."

"Kristi-nim, thank you for healing me last time."

"Not at all."

Meanwhile, Alex and Huh Taeseok's eyes met, but they quickly turned away, pretending not to know each other.

Ryu Min didn't particularly care about their actions.

"It will get better over time."

He felt peaceful, having cast Hero's Protection on his younger brother.

"Even if the Archangel appears, my brother is safe now."

The only variable was that if he, being in the Otherworld, became a target for the Archangel, but that was unlikely.

"The existence from Heaven loses 90% of its power when crossing over to the human realm."

It was information Ryu Min had obtained by reading the minds of the Archangels.

"Probably that guy named Micael will appear in this round."

It was scary, but Ryu Min was also looking forward to how powerful he would be.

Until now, none of his opponents had lived up to Ryu Min's expectations.

Moreover, if he could capture only him, he could complete the Soul Bond quest.

He looked forward to what reward would come.

"I hope he doesn't suddenly appear and disturb me when I'm trying to capture the dragon this round."

Ryu Min planned to capture a dragon in this round.

Round 18 would be a war, so the opportunity was either this round or Round 19.

At that moment, a resounding voice echoed from the colorless sky.

"Hello, all 288 humans. Welcome to Round 17."

Although the words welcomed them, the angel's face looked dissatisfied.

"You survived quite a lot, huh? Originally, there shouldn't be this many survivors in this round...."

The angel, who had wrinkles on his forehead, spoke with a broad smile.

"Well, many will drop out this time. It's a round where you need to use your head, unlike before."

Players were not curious about the angel's words; they already knew from the Black Scythe.

"Shall we reveal the quests for Round 17 then?"
