Title: Episode 246 of the 100th Regression for Max-Level Players

Start of Round 15

The person who approached hesitantly was none other than Minjuri.

Whether it was because of the confession or not, an awkward feeling came over me for no apparent reason.

Although it didn't show on the surface.

"You came early."

"I have something I want to ask Black Scythe-nim about."

"To me?"

What could she want to ask?

Unable to resist curiosity, Ryu Min tried to read Minjuri's thoughts first.

'Ah, she came to consult about something with me.'

Consulting about worries in this realm?

It might sound strange to others, but Ryu Min understood.

'This place is a lawless zone where laws don't apply. Whatever actions you take, nothing seems strange.'

Even though it's not much different from reality in this otherworld, most forget that fact.

For instance, acting rudely to someone you just met, expressing anger like in anger management issues, or in extreme cases, even committing murder.

Actions that would be impossible in reality are done without hesitation.

'Even introverted people in reality undergo a complete transformation when they come to this otherworld. Because they wear the mask called an avatar.'

Due to this peculiarity, many players undergo changes when they come to this otherworld.

Isn't Ryu Min himself portraying a character that is completely different from reality?

Minjuri is the same.

'Things that couldn't be said openly in reality become possible in this otherworld.'

It was similar to posting worries to an unknown person on the internet.

'In that sense, it's an honor. To have someone to talk openly with in this otherworld.'

Ryu Min asked casually.

"So, what do you want to ask?"

"It might take a while to explain, is that okay?"

"It's okay, go ahead."

"Well... it's about my friend. She confessed to someone she liked..."

Minjuri pretended it was her friend's story and confided in Ryu Min.

The thought that crossed Ryu Min's mind as he watched was regret.

Regret that he didn't postpone it to the end.

'I should have kept postponing it if I knew it would cause so much heartache.'

Seeing how much trouble he caused Minjuri with his own situation, he couldn't help but think that he refused for no reason.

However, it didn't mean he would accept.

"…In this situation, my friend doesn't know what to do, so she asked me. If it were Black Scythe-nim, what would you do?"

"It seems like relationship advice now."

"Well, yeah."

"Do you think I've had a lot of experience in love?"

"Well…"

"Seeing your delayed response, it doesn't seem positive."

"Haha…"

Minjuri scratched her cheek with a puzzled look on her face.

"Why are you consulting me specifically?"

"I just wanted to hear Black Scythe-nim's advice. I don't know much about love, but you have insight. I just want to know what Black Scythe-nim would do..."

"Isn't it a simple problem?"

Ryu Min said with a nonchalant expression.

"She confessed but got rejected? She wants to remain friends? Then just be friends."

"But, I, uh, no, that friend doesn't want to be just friends..."

"So? Are you going to lose a friend like this?"

"…"

"If you can't be lovers, at least be friends."

There was a hint of disappointment on Minjuri's face, as if she didn't get the answer she was hoping for.

'Manage your expression. Anyone can tell it's your story.'

Suppressing a laugh, Ryu Min asked, "But why did your friend reject her?"

"She only sees her as a friend and not romantically."

"Then, isn't it as simple as making her see you romantically?"

"It's not that simple…"

"It's not like having a goalkeeper means the ball won't go in. Besides, if your friend still doesn't have a partner, and it's like an open goalpost without a goalkeeper, isn't there plenty of opportunity?"

"…"

Minjuri's eyes widened.

Come to think of it, that was true.

There's still a chance.

There's no need to slump in despair just because of a rejection.

"If you fail, get back up. But if you give up, that's the end. Are you going to sit here and mope? After four years of unrequited love? Wouldn't it be a waste to give up now?"

"It feels… regrettable."

"Then keep trying. Don't crumble as if the world has collapsed just because you got rejected once. If your friend still wants to be friends over there, there's still a chance."

Minjuri, who had been momentarily despondent, soon flashed a relieved smile.

"Thank you for the advice, Black Scythe-nim. Thanks to you, all my worries have completely disappeared."
ChatGPT

"Friend's business, huh? Speaking as if it's your own problem."

"Yes? Ahaha... Well, I was troubled because of a friend's matter. Haha..."

Seeing Minjuri trying to move past it with an awkward laugh, Ryu Min was secretly relieved.

"Good. Fortunately, there doesn't seem to be anything to worry about judging by her condition."

Whether her advice was heeded or not, Minjuri no longer dwelled on the matter.

She didn't look gloomy or powerless, returning to her old self.

"No, is it a bit different from before?"

Her eyes were filled with enthusiasm as if someone with a new goal.

For some reason, a sense of unease crept up.

"It should be fine. At least, it's better than maintaining a strained relationship, right?"

Minjuri, full of enthusiasm, was much better than the listless Minjuri.

As long as it's not taken to extremes.

"Black Scythe-nim?"

"Hello, Black Scythe-nim."

After finishing the relationship advice, followers of the Sinsin Church began to gather one by one.

Core members like Kristin, Seo Arin, Heo Taeseok, and Joyongho were there, along with recent additions like Russell, Victor, and Sophia.

The instruction upon arriving in this otherworld was to gather around their leader.

"It makes it easier to protect each other."

When glancing around, even slaves like Yampi, Jeffrey, and Joo Sungtak could be seen.

However, Jon Delgado was absent from the gathering.

He couldn't bring himself to call for him.

"If Kristin sees him, she'll ignite with anger and charge at him."

Given their hostile relationship, it was better not to meet if possible.

"Receive the buffs, everyone."

"I'll enhance your weapons."

"Sinsin Church, right? Here, take the potions."

While the supporters Minjuri, Russell, and Victor were busy, a light flashed in the sky.

"Hello, humans? Welcome to Round 15. Shall we check the quests right away?"

Appearing with a smile, the angel fluttered its wings as if there was no need for a long speech.

◀ ROUND 15 ▶

└ Clear Three Missions

[Unified Area CA-EA001]

└ Participants: 2,304

└ Achievers: 0/576

"Three missions?"

"What kind of missions are they?"

"Anyway, look at the number of achievers."

"It's like half and half."

As if hearing the players' murmurs, the angel furrowed its brow.
ChatGPT

"Didn't another angel mention it before? The difficulty increases every multiple of 5 rounds. This round is no exception. Out of 2,304 participants, only 576 can survive."

"Less than 600..."

"Do you think I can make it into the top 576?"

Externally, people expressed concern, but internally, they held hopeful thoughts.

At least, I should be able to get within the top 500...

I should have a place within that...

However, contrary to people's expectations, there was a significant shortfall in this round.

And not just a little.

"Not only can't we reach 500, but we can't even save 50. This is just for the previous rounds, though."

This round would be quite different from the past.

The situation had changed from the time when people didn't care whether others lived or died.

"This time, we'll fill all 576 spots."

Thinking about Round 20, it would be better to save even one more person.

"To get into the top ranks this time, the competition will be fierce, won't it?"

"Why compete? Aren't we all on the same team?"

"Angel! Is this round a solo battle or a team battle?"

In response to a player's question, the angel smiled and spoke.

"I cannot reveal that. One thing I can tell you is that you are not in a party."

"Not in a party?"

"Then, it's a solo battle, isn't it?"

People were skeptical, but Ryu Min knew the answer.

"In a way, it's not exactly a solo battle. If we don't cooperate, we'll all be wiped out together."

He wanted to inform everyone about the missions right away, but he remained silent because the angel was watching.

Now was not the time for him to step forward.

"Angel! Then, what about the three missions?"

"What kind of missions will there be?"

"I assume there are sub-quests?"

"On what basis is the ranking determined?"

"I cannot disclose the sub-quests or ranking criteria. If I reveal everything in advance, it won't be fun, hehe."

The angel, who had been laughing to itself, suddenly became serious and flapped its wings.

"Now, shall I send you to the mission location?"

As soon as the angel finished speaking, darkness enveloped the 2,000 players.

"Wh-where is this?"

"Who's there?"

"I can't see anything."
ChatGPT

The monochromatic space suddenly transformed into a dimly lit area.

For a brief moment of confusion, as their eyes adjusted to the darkness, they vaguely saw each other.

The problem was that there was no visible terrain or landmark in the new location they had been transported to.

"There's nothing here?"

"Just a flat space."

"Maybe it's not in space? I can feel the floor."

"But where's the angel? Can't see it anywhere."

"From now on, it seems we have to figure things out on our own."

What mission could they be given in this seemingly endless dark space? The curiosity was dispelled when a message appeared.

[Welcome to the mission location for Round 15.] [If you pass all three missions within the time limit, you can survive the round.] [Now, let's begin the first mission.]

└Survive from Dark Illusions for 30 minutes.

[If successful, you can challenge the second mission.] [Current survivors: 2,304] [Time remaining until the next mission: 00:29:59]

"What's a Dark Illusion?"

"Is it the name of a monster?"

"Anyway, if we survive, that should be enough, right?"

"Running away is my specialty."

Some players tried to appear confident, but it wouldn't be easy.

'Darkness is the optimal environment for Dark Illusions.'

At that moment, some players expressed doubt.

"There's no rule saying we have to run away, right?"

"Yeah. Even if it's a monster, we can kill it, right?"

"If you kill it, there's no need to run away."

However, with the message that appeared as if waiting, players couldn't help but feel perplexed.

[Note: Dark Illusion is invincible.]

No matter how strong Ryu Min was, he couldn't break through invincibility.

In the end, Ryu Min had no choice but to avoid the Dark Illusions.

'But there's a way to easily defeat them without running away.'

Nothing other than transparency.

Dark Illusions couldn't detect players using transparency.

Just standing in place after using it would allow them to safely pass through.

The reason Ryu Min gave transparency potions to the core members was for this very purpose.

"Use it. Now."
ChatGPT

Without forgetting the immediate instruction to consume the potions at the start of the mission, Kristin, John, Minjuri, Yampi, and Seo Arin vanished with a swish after drinking the potions.

Ryu Min could have hidden his body as well, but he chose not to deliberately.

"This round, we can't survive alone. We survive together."

He needed to lead the players without the ability to become transparent.

At that moment,

Wooo-

With a strange wailing sound, the Dark Illusions revealed themselves.
