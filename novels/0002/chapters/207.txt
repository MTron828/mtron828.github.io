Title: Episode 207 of the 100th Regression for the Max Level Player

The Next Target

Before talking to Kristin, Ryumin called Jeffrey first.

"Oh, really? Is she coming?"

As if it wasn't enough that the news of Kristin coming to Korea was already known.

"Why is that?"

I want to hear the next round of the Prophet's prophecy.

'I could have just requested it over the phone.'

After all, it's not polite to ask for a prophecy over the phone when he provides blood-and-flesh prophecies every time.

"Jeffrey, tail Kristin. When the time comes, I will contact you. Lure her to the desired location."

-I will comply with the orders.

'I originally planned to use the excuse of the next round of prophecy to call her...'

If Kristin is coming on her own, there is no need to talk on the phone.

'It's better to keep my involvement as discreet as possible.'

What if his words about calling Kristin reach Magyeongrok's ears?

The misguided arrow might point at him.

Then the target might naturally become his younger brother, Ryu Won.

'That's why I'm not hastily withdrawing my stocks. I have to play the role of a victim as well.'

It doesn't make sense for the Prophet to fail in the stock market, but if he claims not to foresee the future, it's okay.

'When the time comes, I should also call Seo Arin. Of course, not with my number, but with the Black Scythe's.'

That's the plan—to lure both of them to one place and make Magyeongrok see his true face.

Assuming that Magyeongrok commits a crime.

'First, I should entrust Magyeongrok's tailing to Joo Seongtak. I have other things to attend to.'

Ryumin didn't have time to tail Magyeongrok immediately.

He needed to grasp the Messiah's movements right away.

'And I should also meet John Delgado.'

If he meets John, there is something he wants to test.

Whether he can use Sariel, created as a summon.

'I'll undoubtedly gather at that hut again this time.'

It's intriguing to see what conversations the Messiah will have inside.

'They will probably talk about me, the Swingman.'

In that case, he can't go there in the appearance of the Swingman.

They needed to listen to what those guys were talking about, so they decided to use transparency to monitor.

"Hey, where are you going again?"

"Yeah, I'm going to travel abroad a bit."

"Could it be to meet that Japanese girlfriend?"

'Japanese girlfriend?'

It seemed like there was a misunderstanding after returning from a hot spring trip to Japan.

"Well, um, something like that."

"Haha, then it's confirmed. Have a good trip, bro!"

"Yeah. I'll be back."

Ryumin, who unexpectedly got a girlfriend, didn't think it was a bad excuse.

Crash!

With a single punch, the table in the hut split open.

"Is this even reasonable? Our organization members getting beaten!"

The one angrily expressing this was none other than Yang Chuwon, with his face swollen.

He confirmed the failure of the Black Scythe assassination operation through the results window of the 12th round.

The name Black Scythe was firmly in first place.

But he wasn't disappointed that the operation had failed.

The other disciples here felt the same way.

There was still the alternative plan suggested by Swingman.

But...

"Damn it, which bastard attacked our organization members..."

Returning to reality, something shocking had happened.

All 28 members of the Black Society organization under Yang Chuwon were all dead.

Yang Chuwon, who was a player, could avoid the attack because he was inside a secure bunker-type house...

Crash!

"Damn it! Damn it!"

Now, he had no remaining non-player direct subordinates.

If there was anyone left, it would be his right-hand man and player, Jang Soo-wi.

"Calm down. Breaking the table won't solve anything."

When the Messiah's founder, Spanyard, intervened, Yang Chuwon glared with a murderous look.

"Is this table the problem now? All my direct subordinates are dead!"

"If the organization members gather again, it shouldn't be a big deal. Especially for the underlings who will come under the top-ranked Yang Chuwon in China."

"Damn it, you psycho! Family-like members who shared hardships and ate together have died!"

"..."

Seeing him so agitated and yelling, Spanyard chose not to speak anymore. The organization seemed to be quite important in Yang Chuwon's life.

In the hut, only the determined breaths and unrestrained screams of anger echoed for a while.

"I'm going to kill them. I don't care who it is; I'll split their abdomen, pull out their intestines, and strangle them with it."

At that moment, a voice, unfamiliar, spoke up.

"Hasn't the culprit already been revealed?"

"Culprit revealed? What nonsense is that?"

"Think about it. During the time of the crime, we were all in the other world. So, the culprit must be a civilian, right? But the only ones who knew about the operation were Black Society members. So, the answer is clear—it's an internal operation within the organization."

"So, you're saying, damn it, our organization members betrayed us? Is that what you're saying right now?"

"That's the only possibility. Unless it was a betrayal from our Messiah? Perhaps someone from that organization went crazy and betrayed us."

"Have you said enough?"

Though Yang Chuwon glared with fiery eyes, Dark Soul remained composed.

"Then let me ask you one thing. Before the attack on the Black Scythe, you said you found corpses in front of the villa, right? Were there any missing organization members among them?"

"...There was one. Jang Chen."

"Ah, then that guy must be the culprit. Just before carrying out the mission, he killed his comrades and returned home, neatly dealing with the remaining organization members."

"But Jang Chen was found dead alongside other organization members."

"Then someone silenced him or he committed suicide after completing the mission."

"...Damn it, it's not that easy to say. Jang Chen was a... a traitor..."

"Does a traitor walk around with a sign on their face that says 'traitor'? Or do they drop hints in advance that they're going to betray?"

"..."

"The better someone is at killing, the better they are at acting. They wear a mask in everyday life and reveal their true colors when the time comes."

Bang!

"Why the hell does this bastard know anything!"

Although Yang Chuwon denied it, Dark Soul looked around at his comrades as if to suggest that his words made sense.

"Do you all not think my thoughts are incorrect?"

No one answered Dark Soul's question.

Silence was a tacit approval.

Dark Soul chuckled.
ChatGPT

"In my opinion, that guy Jang Chen seems like a planted traitor from a rival organization. He probably waited for the right moment and started moving when it was time."

"No, come to think of it, it seems unrelated to rival organizations. It might be related to Black Scythe..."

"Black Scythe?"

Yang Chuwon, who had calmed down a bit, spoke calmly.

"I went to Korea to check after seeing what happened to the organization members. I even checked Black Scythe's villa at that time, but there was no one there."

"He probably went out somewhere..."

"There was no trace that could be considered human. It was completely empty, as if the person had left the house knowing this would happen."

"What? So, are you saying that Black Scythe foresaw our operation in advance?"

"That's likely. Before executing the operation, we reported that he was in that villa for sure."

At that moment, Dark Soul snapped his fingers.

"Ah, now I get it! Black Scythe anticipated our operation in advance, bought the organization member Jang Chen, and then, after completing the job, silenced him by hiring another killer."

It was a plausible assumption, but there was one problem remaining.

"The problem is how he figured out our operation..."

"Maybe there's a traitor among us?"

"Among us...?"

With Yang Chuwon's one statement, the atmosphere changed drastically.

Everyone started scrutinizing each other with suspicious glares.

However, John Delgado raised his head as if to suggest there was no need for mutual suspicion.

"I agree with the idea that there's a traitor. I think we might even know who the traitor is."

"Who is it?"

"Obviously, someone not present in this room, right?"

At his words, everyone thought of one person.

The only disciple not present at the hut gathering was Swingman.

"Why do you think Swingman is the traitor, John Delgado?"

It was a calm inquiry from Spanyard, but deep down, he was boiling.

It wasn't just that he had directly recruited members. If a traitor came from among them, he couldn't absolve himself of responsibility.

"I'm not certain. It's just a possibility."

"So, what's the reason?"

"In reality, in the 12th round, I partied with Black Scythe."

"That makes sense. If the operation failed, we had planned to approach Black Scythe as an alternative."
ChatGPT

"At that time, there was a player named Zephyr with Black Scythe."

"Wait, isn't Zephyr the assassin who provided Black Scythe's hideout?"

"Yes. I was surprised when I first saw the nickname, but since the face was different from reality, I thought it might be someone else. He didn't seem to recognize me, and I just assumed that the assassin we hired was using a fake nickname. But then..."

John Delgado's eyes flashed.

"If that Zephyr we met is indeed the real Zephyr and was in cahoots with Black Scythe? Then everything makes sense. He deceived us by spreading false information in advance and helped Black Scythe."

"But we only asked him to tail, we didn't provide specific plans, right?"

"That's why there's a traitor within us. Who called Zephyr, the informant? None other than Swingman. The fact that Black Scythe could foresee it in advance was also likely due to Swingman's assistance."

Swingman, Zephyr, Black Scythe, Jang Chen.

If we assume these four were in collusion, then all the pieces of the puzzle fit.

"Damn it! I knew it would turn out like this. Damn Kareman! I never liked him from the beginning!"

Only Yang Chuwon erupted in anger, but the feelings of the others were not much different. They were all grinding their teeth in betrayal.

"Where is Swingman? Why hasn't he come?"

"We lost contact with him. Even with a search warrant, he doesn't show up."

"He can't be traced?"

"He's registered as a non-existent person."

"Oh."

The meaning of those words was simple.

"He seems to be dead. In the 12th round."

"Huh, you idiot. Dying just in the 12th round."

"This way, we can't even seek revenge."

They had planned to eliminate the traitor, but now that he was dead, there was nothing they could do.

"Jang Chen is dead, and if Black Scythe is difficult to revenge, there's only one person left."

"Zephyr. We need to track him down."

"But we don't even know his real name. How do we track him?"

"In reality, it's unavoidable. If we want to work on this, we have to do it in the other world. I know his face and nickname, so I can find him."

With confident words from John Delgado, Spanyard came to a conclusion.
ChatGPT

"Then let's track down Zephyr with John Delgado in Round 13. We can interrogate that guy to find out the truth. Additionally, we might learn more about Black Scythe."

"You damn assassin. Pay for what you did to our subordinates."

"Even if we don't know the mission of Round 13, that guy's life is forfeit. He meddled with us without even knowing the topic."

And so, with these four Apostles sharpening their knives, the meeting came to an end.

Their new target was Zephyr, presumed to be an associate of Black Scythe.

"Sigh."

John Delgado returned home after the meeting.

Although he managed to survive this round by teaming up with Black Scythe somehow...

"Will I be able to survive the next one?"

The fear grew with each passing round.

Seeking revenge against Black Scythe was not the only issue.

"It's okay. I have an angel with me."

In Round 12, the angel he fought against Black Scythe was turned into an ethereal undead.

Although caught, Black Scythe inexplicably let him go, along with a warning not to crawl back.

"Yeah. What revenge in this situation? The priority is to survive for now."

John Delgado checked his status window out of caution.

However, as expected, there was a message written like a stamp.

[Penalty is being applied.] [All stats permanently decrease by 50%.] [Summoned creature's stats permanently decrease by 50%.]

"Damn it!"

Seeing his stats halved, frustration burst out.

Why did it have to be like this after teaming up with Black Scythe?

Although curses naturally poured out, there was a somewhat fortunate aspect.

"At least I have an angel summon."

Though he didn't know the angel's name, it seemed extraordinarily powerful.

Even though it was like a mouse in front of a cat against Black Scythe, wasn't this quite something?

"Compared to other players or monsters, this summon is incomparable. Undoubtedly the strongest among the summons I've obtained so far."

By summoning a deceased target, it could be used as a summon with 50% of its original abilities.

Even with the penalty causing another 50% reduction, it still appeared powerful.

"I have no one to trust but this unknown angel summon."

He had to get stronger.

Even if he put aside revenge against Black Scythe, he had to survive until Round 20.
ChatGPT

"And it's making wishes. Like, asking to kill Black Scythe."

Of course, it was just a delusion.

Rather than such a wish, wouldn't it be better to just become a thousand times stronger than Black Scythe?

"Then I can dominate the world and do everything I want. Kekeke."

Laughter burst out.

Alone in the house, he laughed like a madman.

Still, it didn't matter.

"After all, there's no one to see, right? Kikikiki."

"Who's there?"

Startled, John Delgado turned at the voice of a third person.

Looking at the place, there was a mysterious figure wearing a mask.

"A white mask?"

For a moment, the image of the video taken at the entrance of the villa came to mind.

In that video, the man referred to as Black Scythe wore the exact same mask.

"You, are you by any chance..."

"Yeah. The person you're thinking of."

With those words, a large scythe was gripped in the hands of the mysterious figure.

It was the familiar scythe that severed his limbs, the one with the distinctive appearance.
