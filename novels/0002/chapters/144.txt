Title: Episode 144 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max-Level Player

Getting Ready for the Journey

For the past few days, Ryu Min had been training with CPF members in the field.

When an actual report comes in, they turn on the siren and arrive at the scene as quickly as possible.

Swiftly scan the crime scene to assess the situation at a glance.

It would be great to confront the culprit at the scene, but most of the time, they've already fled.

In such cases, utilize the surrounding search skills to trace the footsteps of the culprit.

If successful in finding the culprit, it's fortunate, but what if they fail?

They search for witnesses or conduct investigative searches by visiting stores.

Of course, if another report comes in during the search, they must hand it over to regular police officers and leave.

Because the top priority was to eliminate as many criminal players as possible.

On the contrary, if the culprit is found, they subdue and handcuff them.

Of course, these are not ordinary handcuffs.

"These are player-exclusive handcuffs supplied to regular police officers. It requires at least strength 150 to barely break free."

After capturing criminals with the handcuffs provided by the captain, they hand them over to the police and leave the legal consequences to them.

Isn't it risky to leave players to regular police officers?

Since the country has granted permission for players to use firearms, regular police officers are well-equipped to confront criminal players.

Even though players cannot dodge bullets, at least for now.

Of course, players without handcuffs are still dangerous even if they have a gun.

Nevertheless, if they exhibit threatening behavior, immediate action can be taken, so the police with guns can manage them to some extent.

"I guess it's time to end the training."

Ryu Min sighed, looking at his teammates.

After a few days of real combat, they were able to resolve incidents on their own even without his intervention.

They had killed several criminal players.

Despite their innocent appearance, these teammates had already gone through four rounds, so they had less reluctance toward murder.

"And considering their contempt for criminals, that's why they became police officers."

At least none of the teammates hesitated to take immediate action.

"Good job for the past week. With this, both theoretical and practical training is over. Now you can leave with confidence."

"Huh? Leave?"

“I never thought I'd be watching your back forever. I'm a busy person too.”

I already informed the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport a week ago that I'll be chartering a plane to Nigeria.

Currently, just waiting for approval of the flight route.

I've even made a passport in the name of Lostyak.

In my mind, I've already completed preparations for the trip.

"Even without me, catching criminal players shouldn't be a problem, right?"

"...."

Although it was true, no one spoke up.

Though unspoken, the members who had grown attached to him in just a week were a fact.

As a captain, they believed in and followed him, truly a mental anchor.

It was disheartening and bitter to hear that such a captain was leaving.

"Don't feel too disappointed. I'll drop by whenever I have time to make sure you're doing well."

Having said that, Ryu Min left a few words of encouragement for his team.

"Go Nam-cheol, you've completely fixed your dialect in just a week. Someone might think you're a Seoul native."

"Haha, you're exaggerating, Captain."

"Hwang Man-gi, your recent performance has been good. Don't forget that I'm always expecting great things from you."

"Thank you, haha."

"Kang Shi-hyuk, you've always been doing well. Just keep it up like now. Oh? Your eyes seem teary. It's not like you're crying because I'm leaving, is it?"

"Ah, no, how could that be?"

Contrary to his words, Kang Shi-hyuk turned away, wiping tears with the back of his hand.

"You've all worked hard. Work as I've arranged, doing the 3rd Platoon 2nd Shift. It's hard to play the role of a vigilante 24/7. If there are any problems, contact me anytime. Got it?"

"Yes! Captain! Thank you for your hard work!"

"Well, someone might think I'm retiring."

Ryu Min chuckled under his mask as he turned away.

He had reliable team members now.

[This month, the newly established grand player unit CPF has shown unexpectedly favorable results...]

[Newly formed CPF unit processed 52 players in a week! Easing the burden on police officers...]

[Is it the effect of CPF? Crime rates have decreased by 32% compared to last week...]

[Have you heard of the CPF unit? A newly established player vigilante group!]

Is this the unit that catches players? Can they execute on the spot?

It definitely seems effective. The number of players committing crimes has sharply declined.

Of course, it would be effective. They say if you commit a crime, they kill you.

What? If you get caught committing a crime, you die? Haha, damn, I might just stay home.

It's not just killing indiscriminately; they only kill heinous criminals. Even if they engage in dangerous activities, they are killed.

The country is crazy. Players are still human, and they're just being killed without reason.

B*stards advocating for criminals above.

If you leave them alone, bigger damage could occur, so it's about eliminating them.

Criminal scum should die. Period.

We should have done this earlier. Just government officials fixing the stable after losing the cow.

Yeah, anyway, Representative Lee Seong-hyun did something.

They say the unit leader is ranked 1st among players? Is the nickname Black Scythe?

If it's Black Scythe, then it must be the person who helped Representative Lee Seong-hyun last time.

So, he got in through the representative's connections. Haha.

Connections with the representative? What nonsense. The authority to decide the unit rests with the police commissioner.

Representative Lee Seong-hyun actually recommended him. You can find it in the news.

He must have been added as a special case since he has no visible skills and has a record of saving people.

Anyway, it's because of connections. Haha.

Still, judging by the unit's performance without causing any accidents, it seems the unit leader position is not just for show.

Ryu Min put down his phone after reading the comments.

'Overall, the response to CPF seems positive. It's showing noticeable effects, so it's only natural, right?'

He smiled contentedly, but compared to that, his own reputation as Black Scythe did not rise much.

Well, that's to be expected.

No matter how much a unit excels, it's just considered fulfilling their duty.

The unit leader's name wouldn't become an issue.

Unless he personally reveals something significant.

The reason for going to Nigeria lies here.

To reveal something significant.

'What if I hunt public enemies under the name of Black Scythe? It would probably skyrocket my reputation. At least more than now.'

When the time comes, what if I ask Seo Arin, who is currently gaining popularity, for promotion?

Even if she doesn't know, it will further raise the awareness and status of the unit.

By doing so, the frequency of criminal players running rampant will also significantly decrease.

‘It seems like I need Seo Arin's help.’

Ryu Min called Seo Arin using the Lostyak's phone.

The meticulousness of disguising his voice to resemble his face was evident.

But.

‘She's not answering?’

Perhaps because it's an unknown number, she isn't picking up.

He tried calling several times, but the result was the same.

He reluctantly sent her a text.

[Arin? It's Black Scythe. If you have something to say, respond to this text and I'll call you.]

He sent the message, and after about 10 seconds, he received an immediate call from Seo Arin.

Maybe she didn't answer because it was an unknown number.

Uh, are you really Black Scythe?

"Yeah, it's me. You should recognize my voice, right?"

Oh, yes, it is Black Scythe.

Seo Arin remembered the voice of the real Black Scythe she had met before.

Wearing a mask made it even more memorable.

How did you know my number? I never told you...?

"I have a higher-up who knows everything about me."

Ah, so you're the captain of the CPF unit?

"I see you've already read the article."

Yes. I wouldn't miss an article about Black Scythe...

"...."

Oh, please don't misunderstand. It's just that, like an occupational disease, I happened to come across it while surfing the internet.

"I didn't misunderstand."

Oh, really? But why did you call?

"I'm thinking of making you an advertising offer."

What?

"We're planning to shoot a public service advertisement to widely promote our unit, and you seem perfect as the promotional model."

Huh, a promotional model? Me?

Although initially surprised, Seo Arin quickly recovered.

I'll do it. I want to.

She accepted so readily that it was almost puzzling.

"Are you deciding so easily? Don't you need some time to think about it?"

Is there something to think about? If it's something that can help Black Scythe, I shouldn't ask questions.

"Then the promotional model is decided."

He was worried she might refuse, but he was relieved that she accepted so willingly.

"When the schedule is set, I'll contact you."

Thank you. For giving me the opportunity to repay.

"Opportunity? What for? I'm the one thankful."

Uh, well... Can I ask a favor if you don't mind? Oh, is it too shameless?

Ryu Min blinked at the sudden request.

"A favor? What is it?"

C-Can we, perhaps, have a meal together? If you have time, that is. If you're busy, it's unavoidable...

"Having a meal with a mask on... That seems challenging."

Ah, right, you have a mask.

No matter how well Ryu Min transformed into Lostyak, he couldn't reveal his face to Seo Arin.

"And, I'll be quite busy moving around for a while, so I might not have time."

Oh, really? Where are you going...?

"That's something I won't disclose."

Ah, I'm sorry...

She was bewildered, as if wondering if this was the same Seo Arin who had been cold at the meat restaurant.

"Well then, when the advertising schedule is set, I'll contact you again."

Yes, understood. Black Scythe.

Ryu Min chuckled after ending the call.

‘Got the promotional model, CPF is running smoothly without me.’

Things were unfolding well according to the plan.

‘How is things going on the Felsyva side?’

Thinking of this, Ryu Min made a call with his own phone.

Yamti's reflective voice was heard.

Master! What's going on?

"Is it home?"

Yes, it's home. If you have any plans to visit our house...

"Don't talk nonsense. How is the Felsyva management going?"

Yes. I've given detailed instructions to the chairman, and we are receiving new members without any issues.

"All the members who joined recently passed the personality test, right?"

Yes. Thanks to you, Master, who dealt with the existing members, numbering over a thousand last month, the muddy water has drained out, and it has been replaced with fresh water.

"That's fortunate."

With the efforts of Ma Kyung-rok and himself, the trash in Felsyva was now completely cleaned up.

By filtering out the impurities and admitting only members with proper character, they had achieved a complete transformation.

"Tell the chairman that with just one word, at any time, I can mobilize the cafe members. Manage it well so that they can move at any time."

Already done. I've already given instructions, so you don't have to worry.

"Leaving that aside, I can smoothly rent the chartered plane, right?"

Of course. I've already reserved a chartered plane for the Nigeria route you requested last week. We have approvals from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport and each airport.

The chartered plane Ryu Min was planning to take was none other than the one prepared by the Felsyva chairman, Song Jae-kyum.

Although pushed by Ma Kyung-rok, he was also a conglomerate worth counting on.

As the eldest son of the LC Group, it was expected that he would have a chartered plane, and the assumption proved to be correct.

"So, I can leave as planned tomorrow, right?"

Yes. But may I ask why you're going to Nigeria?

"I won't discuss that over the phone. Let's meet tomorrow and talk about it in person."

Ah, traveling alone with the master. I've been hoping earnestly for this moment. I feel so happy!

"Don't overreact; just make sure to prepare your suitcase and passport. We'll be leaving tomorrow morning."

Got it, Master! Hehehe!

After ending the call, Ryu Min shook his head.

'I should have just said it over the phone.'

He hoped there wouldn't be any strange misunderstandings.
