Title: "Episode 122 of the 100th Rebirth of a Max Level Player"

God Rank

God rank.

As befitting its name, it holds the highest value among items.

'Especially when all five types - weapon, helmet, armor, gloves, and boots - are matched as god rank, it exhibits tremendous set effects.'

Among them, one type is now in Ryumin's hands.

[Combining god-ranked items.] [Will be transformed into items suitable for the current profession.] [Combination successful!] [Created 'Thanatos' Black Armor.']

Thanatos' Black Armor.

It's an item that Ryumin also created in the previous episode.

He examined the item information with a smiling face.

[Thanatos' Black Armor]

-Class: Armor

-Rank: God

-Defense: 2,000

-Effect: All stats +1 per level, 67% chance to deflect the enemy's attack when hit.

-Durability: 20,000/20,000

-Usage Restriction: Master rank or above

-Description: Armor made using the divine power of the death god Thanatos. Additional effects are granted when wearing the set items.

-Set Effect of Thanatos' Attire (1/5)

-2 Set Effect: ????

-3 Set Effect: ????

-4 Set Effect: ????

-5 Set Effect: ????

'All stats increase per level. Indeed, it's a god-ranked item.'

Moreover, there's a 67% chance to deflect the attack when hit by an enemy.

It's useful in situations where facing a tough opponent or dealing with a large number of enemies simultaneously.

Truly fitting options for a divine-class item.

It was only natural for a smile to appear on Ryumin's face.

'Moreover, god-ranked items have set effects, so the more you collect, the better the synergy.'

To create the next god-ranked item, he'll need to gather materials again, but it shouldn't take as long.

Exactly when it will happen is uncertain.

'At least it won't take as long as the last eight months.'

The reason can be found in the additional message received while creating the god-ranked item.

[It has been confirmed that you are the player who first combined a god-ranked item.] [As a reward, you have obtained 'Condensed Aether.']
ChatGPT

The condensed Aether, a crucial ingredient for god-ranked items.

An item that is difficult to obtain was easily given as the initial reward.

"With this, creating the second god-ranked item won't be difficult."

Ryumin, with a satisfied smile, checked his equipment window after wearing the items.

[Weapon – Death's Side] [Helmet – Devil's Ring] [Armor – Thanatos' Black Armor] [Gloves – Ogre's Gauntlets] [Shoes – Ghostly Stride Boots] [Necklace – Bead of the Afterlife] [Ring – Crimson Eye Skull Ring]

Except for the Bead of the Afterlife, all the worn items are of Unique grade or higher.

'Status Window.'

"Even without the Rune of Slaughter buff, the stats are surpassing 500."

This means that with the Rune of Slaughter buff, it could exceed 1,000.

Adding the Blessing of Minjuri could go over 1,600.

"At only level 80, this is impressive."

If he received the top human quest reward by the 8th round, he might have reached level 84.

"Since the projection, not the main body, reached the destination, the escort mission may not be recognized as successful."
ChatGPT

The reason the experience points for completing the top human escort weren't received was due to this.

"Anyway, the stats are quite impressive for level 80. If compared to other players."

For other players to reach level 80, they would need to go beyond round 15.

"But round 15 is called the devil's range, so the difficulty is high."

Just surviving with only 50 people or less is a challenge.

On a global scale, that is.

"By then, I should secure at least three god-ranked items."

However, achieving max level before that might be faster.

After each round ends, most players who wake up from their hibernation immediately go back to sleep.

This is because the mental fatigue from the otherworld continues into reality.

However, there is always someone moving every time a round ends.

That someone was An Sangcheol.

Bzzing - Clunk!

"Boss!"

As usual, as soon as he opened his eyes in reality, he found Makyungrok's hotel room.

At that sight, Makyungrok narrowed his eyes.

Someone subordinate is entering the boss's room without being called?

Without even knocking?

"Director An? What's the reason for coming like this every time? I didn't give you the master key for this."

"Oh, I'm sorry."

"No need to apologize, but what brings you here today?"

Looking at An Sangcheol, who had an unusually serious expression, Makyungrok was curious.

'What good news could it be?'

Is he finally making a move on Seo Arin or something?

I hope so.

Squeeze tightly this time.

But unexpectedly, instead of good news, words that dampened the mood came out of An Sangcheol's mouth.

"I reached level 40! Finally, I've advanced to the Expert rank!"

"Oh... really? Congratulations, Director An. Kill your superiors and all that."

"Huh? Uh, I'm sorry."

"I know you're doing it on purpose. Don't bother apologizing."

Looking at Makyungrok turning his head with a bitter expression, An Sangcheol belatedly realized how short-sighted his thoughts were.

He genuinely didn't know.

"I'm sorry. I was so happy that I didn't think about Boss's feelings."

"I also want to reach level 40 quickly. But I'm still at 38. Does this make any sense?"

Makyungrok complained during this moment.
ChatGPT

"Moreover, in recent rounds, I even lost my position in the overall ranking. For the first time. Well, to say it was taken away is a bit harsh; I should express it as I couldn't rise."

"...I apologize."

"Being 1st was impossible, given that there's a monster who reached level 80 knows everything. But I thought I could manage 2nd or 3rd place. However, I got pushed back by a priest and a buffer. One of them is even my fiancée."

Makyungrok let out a bitter smile and refilled his whiskey glass.

"I used to receive rewards for being 2nd or 3rd in the region, and not getting it once feels strange. I thought I was ahead, but suddenly, my level is lower than some subordinate employees, making me feel left behind."

"P-Please don't be disheartened, Boss. Isn't there only a 2-level difference between us? And you have a unique and powerful occupation. You'll quickly reclaim your rank."

"Do you think so? Even if there's a chance for a comeback, with the integration of the Black Scythe and the region, the 1st place might be taken away. Is there really a chance for a rebound?"

"..."

An Sangcheol remained silent.

Right now, there's nothing he can say that would provide comfort.

It would only turn things upside down internally.

"What level is Seo Actor at?"

"I heard it's 37."

"Oh? Still, Seo Actor has won. It doesn't feel good, but anyway."

After downing the whiskey in one go, Makyungrok made a loud sound and set the glass down.

"The Prophet is alive, isn't she?"

"Yes, she confirmed it when she called on the way here."

"I want to know the information for Round 9 quickly. I want to analyze if there's a place to level up quickly."

"Should I call now and ask?"

"Don't say such ominous things. Treat the Prophet like a deity. Think of her as a representative of the gods who conveys trust. Despite her young age, she's cunning and quick-witted in judging situations. Don't do things that would displease her. That's how we can mutually benefit. Unfortunately, we're not dealing with the Prophet."

"Oh, I understand. I'll be careful with my words from now on."

Makyungrok was pondering.

Ryumin, who used to be held up in front of his father.

'Is it humility, or does he lack ambition? I can't figure it out even though I know him.'

At that moment, Makyungrok's phone vibrated.

'Who could it be at this hour?'
ChatGPT

Without looking at the night view and heading towards where his phone was, he widened his eyes in surprise.

He briskly answered the call and spoke in English.

"Kristin. What's going on?"

"I just boarded a plane to Incheon Airport."

"Yes? All of a sudden?"

"I confirmed that most of the information you provided about Round 8 is true."

It couldn't be otherwise.

Ryumin's prophecies have never been wrong.

Thanks to his prophecy, Makyungrok also gained a lot of experience points in the top human ranking in Round 8.

So, he could sense it.

"Could it be that as soon as you opened your eyes, you decided to come to Korea?"

"I wanted to meet your business partner as soon as possible."

"Ah."

It was as expected.

Once someone hears the prophecy, they can't help but seek out Ryumin.

"There's no one who has never heard a prophecy, but there's no one who has only heard it once."

That saying seemed to fit perfectly.

That's how significant Ryumin's presence is to the players, like light and salt.

"I understand. Kristin. Let's make arrangements."

"Thank you."

It was the first time Makyungrok heard a word of thanks from his fiancée.

Player Place.

In other words, the growth trend of PPL Market was terrifyingly steep.

Looking at the number of subscribers, it can be assumed that almost all players worldwide use it.

"But the problem is that it's decreasing by half every month."

The number of users is dropping by more than half every month.

Yet, PPL's growth trend was not slowing down.

How is that possible?

"PPL has a consignment system."

The consignment system refers to the PPL company taking care of the sale of items registered by players on their behalf.

In other words, if the seller sends the item to the company by courier, PPL sells it on their behalf, deducts a commission, and gives back the profits.

If there are issues with the seller's identity, the agreed-upon profits are put into the family account.

"This way, even if the selling player dies, they can still profit from selling items."

Sellers are satisfied because they can provide the item's payment to their families in case of unforeseen circumstances.

The consignment selling system was a mutually beneficial system.

This is why even if the number of users decreases, the company's revenue does not decline.
ChatGPT

"As the rounds progress, the level and value of items tend to rise."

In the end, even if only a tiny fraction remains, PPL's future lies in becoming a site for VVIP users.

"So, you don't need to worry about it failing."

"Haha, I worried for no reason."

Makyungrok felt somewhat relieved after Ryumin's explanation.

Concerned about the decreasing number of users each round, Makyungrok called Ryumin to share his worries. The result was, as seen, just a sigh of relief.

The Prophet, a businesswoman herself, had a better understanding of the company than Makyungrok.

"Well, it may still go downhill later."

After Round 15, the number of users sharply decreased.

It wasn't a gentle curve but a steep drop like a cliff.

When the user count falls to double digits, it's inevitable that the company would fail.

"But then, I'll just pull out everything I can. For now, I'll enjoy it as much as I can."

Ryumin hid this fact.

There's no need to cause unnecessary worries.

"It was a good idea to consult with the Prophet. If not, I might have been pondering various things on my own. Haha."

Watching this, Ryumin noticed a slight change in Makyungrok's laughter.

"It seems like some of his pretense has diminished."

Whenever he dealt with himself, Makyungrok wore the mask of a businessman.

But today, for some reason, he seemed to be breaking down that barrier.

"Well, I'll probably go bankrupt eventually."

Reading his inner thoughts, Ryumin noticed the part where he was letting down his guard.

"Oh well, it's not like he called me to ask about the fate of the company."

Ryumin observed Makyungrok.

With the Rune of Future Sight, he can see seven seconds into the future.

"Hmm, Prophet. The truth is, I gathered everyone here for a different reason."

"I'm aware."

"Really?"

"There's no need to say it. Guests will arrive soon."

As Ryumin finished speaking, the office door opened.

Two guests from the United States entered.

It was Kristin and Jeffrey.

Makyungrok alternately looked at Ryumin and Kristin with surprised eyes.
