Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 217"

Episode 217: The Start of Round 13

On January 1, 2023, a new year dawned.

While some set goals of quitting smoking, studying, or exercising upon hearing the tolling of the New Year, for players, such aspirations were nothing but luxuries.

Their ultimate goal was, after all, survival.

"The 13th round has started without fail even in the new year."

Now, looking at the monotonous and somewhat tiresome colorless space in front of him, Ryu Min sighed.

"Those in front of me are all there is, huh."

In the vast space, there were still close to ten thousand people, but compared to before, it was undeniably fewer.

"I died too much in the 12th round."

Due to the cave trial that couldn't be passed without a summoner in the party, three-quarters had perished.

"It couldn't be helped. It wasn't something I could prevent."

Could he individually explain strategies to the multitude of people in front of him?

"With the decrease in participants, I should start taking care of other players. Not just those around me."

At least the followers of the Cult of the Reapers were sure to be taken care of.

That was the strategy for the 13th round that he had opened.

"If half survive this round and the next, around 2,500 will remain."

But the problem was the 15th round.

Only a quarter could pass the insane difficulty of the 15th round.

Roughly 600 people would make it, but due to the crazy difficulty, not even 50 would survive.

Hence, excluding the last round among the total of twenty rounds, it could be considered the most critical round.

"I have to save as many people as possible in the 15th round. I can't afford to fall short like in the 12th round."

He was determined to fill the 600 spots as much as possible.

That way, he could face the final round with as many people as possible for the boss battle.

"As there is no information about the boss, having many survivors wouldn't be a bad thing. That's why I plan to take care of the Cult of the Reapers. It's also preparation for the 16th round."

Many Korean players needed to survive for the 16th round to be cleared without any issues.
ChatGPT

"So, I've released the strategy for Round 13, and if followed as instructed, it should be easy to clear."

"If done well, all Korean players might survive."

Of course, it wasn't just Koreans he was looking out for.

Kristin, Jeffrey, Russell, Victor, John Delga, and others.

He also shared strategies for easily clearing with players from other countries.

"Lord of the Black Scythe."

Even Minjoo, who had just arrived.

"You came? A Cult of the Reapers follower."

"Haha... It feels awkward being called a follower. Just call me Minjoo, as usual. Or feel free to call me by my name..."

When joining the Cult of the Reapers, she had filled in all her personal information.

Although there was no reason not to know her name, Ryu Min shook his head.

"I find 'Minjoo' more comfortable than my name."

"Is that so?"

With a smile, Minjoo looked at the people following Ryu Min.

They could be seen as competitors, but on the other hand, having overcome up to Round 12, they were like comrades in a way.

"For the first time in a while, on New Year's, so many people have to participate in a survival game instead of watching the sunrise... It's a bit sad."

"It's quite sentimental."

Whether it was a retort or not, Minjoo puffed up her cheeks.

"Contrary to appearances, it's sentimental... Well, is that what it means?"

"I didn't say that."

Ryu Min, who didn't have the confidence to argue with Minjoo, turned his head slightly.

Coincidentally, Seo Arin and Heo Taeseok were coming from that direction.

"Lord of the Black Scythe!"

"Are you also feeling sad for not being able to see the sunrise?"

"What? What are you talking about?"

"Because of the time limit, we can't see the sunrise anyway."

Thanks to Ryu Min, everyone knew that the time limit for this round was 10 hours.

If they were to return to reality, it was already 10 in the morning.

"Oh, I see. Minister Minjoo wants to see the sunrise, right?"

"I-I didn't say that. I just..."

"With whom do you want to watch it? Perhaps a boyfriend?"

"I, I don't have a boyfriend!"

"Huh? A beautiful person like Minister Minjoo doesn't have one?"

"Don't joke around, Master."

"It's not a joke..."

Suddenly, two more people gathered, making a commotion.

Meanwhile, Ryu Min, who ignited the spark for the sunrise, remained silent.

'By the way, the Summoner should be doing well.'

Ryu Min had given one command to the now-enslaved John Delga.
ChatGPT

In the other world, it was a simple command: "Do not encounter other apostles."

"I can't let those Messiah bastards target Jeffrey."

John knew that they were after Jeffrey.

To be on the safe side, he had ordered to reveal any schemes they might have.

"They probably intended to capture Jeffrey and interrogate him in this round, but it didn't work. He's already exposed to me."

The only one who could track Jeffrey's location was John Delga, who had partied with him.

If John intentionally advised him to avoid the apostles, the strategy could be easily carried out.

However, John would likely face resentment.

"Lord of the Black Scythe!"

When he turned around, this time Eom Junseok, Ju Seongtak, and Yantee appeared one after another.

Following them, even Kristin, Jeffrey, and the group including Jo Yongho came to seek the Black Scythe, and people quickly gathered.

"With Jo Yongho joining, the number of people increased."

Someone who seemed to be the Mercenary King, leading mercenaries over thirty, appeared.

Of course, they were all Koreans and followers of the Cult of the Reapers.

"I only managed to make Jo Yongho my ally, but even the mercenaries under him are following. Not bad."

While the companions with their faces covered exchanged greetings with smiles, an angel appeared.

"Hello, humans. You've come as usual today!"

Although knowing that the angel didn't come because it wanted to, it teased the humans.

"Oh, my! There are barely 10,000 survivors left in the entire area! Wasn't the last round a bit difficult? Don't worry. After a few more rounds, it will quickly decrease to two digits. Kuhuhu."

"Two... two digits?"

"C-Crazy."

The angel, enjoying the unnecessary anxiety it created, chuckled at the reactions of the people.

"Kuhuhu, shall we open the quest then? This one shouldn't be too difficult. Relax. Really."

With a seemingly trustworthy statement, the angel fluttered its wings.

◀ ROUND 13 ▶

└Raise the reputation of one species to 'Very Friendly' within 10 hours

└???? Majority

[Unified Zone CA-EA001]

└Participants: 9,994

└Achievers: 0/4,997

It was a simple quest, especially for Ryu Min, who hadn't encountered an easier quest throughout the previous rounds.

"Already completed it."
ChatGPT

"This round's quest is to raise the reputation of a species to 'Very Friendly' for survival. Compared to other rounds, it's quite easy, isn't it?"

"'Very Friendly'?"

"You can raise reputation?"

Most people didn't even know there was such a thing as reputation.

"If you've never experienced an increase in reputation, you might not know."

However, Ryu Min had already raised the reputation with the Elven race to 'Very Friendly' during the 8th round.

Apart from Elves, he had achieved 'Very Friendly' with three other species.

"Especially with the Elven race, it went beyond 'Very Friendly' to an eternal alliance."

The reputation rune, which raised all reputations by one level, played a crucial role.

Therefore, Ryu Min had nothing specific to do in this round.

It was like he had already passed the quest as soon as it started.

"Species reputation starts as neutral. Performing actions that endear you to that species makes it friendly, and the next step is 'Very Friendly.'"

Two steps from neutral to 'Very Friendly.'

"It's not easy to raise it by two levels."

It wasn't as easy as it sounded.

That's why they were given a long time of 10 hours.

But the perspective of the Cult of the Reapers, who had learned strategies from Ryu Min, might be a bit different.

"I told them about quests that quickly raise reputation."

Coincidentally, the angel was explaining this.

"When you travel around the fantasy world and complete sub-quests, you've done that before, right? By doing sub-quests that a specific species would like, reputation will accumulate. As a bonus, you can also gain experience points, gold, and items as quest rewards."

"To raise reputation, you have to do quests?"

"There's no other way but to choose one species and break sub-quests like crazy, right?"

"Of course, depending on the difficulty of the quest, the reputation increase and rewards vary. Figure it out on your own. The conclusion is, within 10 hours, you must raise the reputation of one species to 'Very Friendly' to survive. Keep that in mind."

"Given the 10-hour time limit, it must be difficult to raise it that much, right?"

"Ugh... This doesn't seem easy."

Most people might feel like they were dropped into a pitch-black sea, but the 170 Cult of the Reapers followers who had heard the strategy were different.

At least, they knew the paths to quickly achieve certain quests.
ChatGPT

"There won't be time to dawdle. You'll be listed on the survivor list in the order of achieving the reputation as quickly as possible. Well, if there's someone who has already achieved it, they'll have 10 hours of free time, but I doubt there is such a person... Huh?"

The angel, who was speaking, seemed flustered, perhaps after looking at the list of achievers.

"Huh, there is one? A human who has already achieved 'Very Friendly' or higher..."

Even though the nickname wasn't mentioned, if there was only one person, there was no need to look.

"It's about me."

Ryu Min smirked, wearing a relaxed expression.

Since he had already passed the quest as soon as it started, he could leisurely do sub-quests for the next 10 hours, as mentioned by the angel.

"So, shall we choose the starting location?"

A message window appeared in front of the players.

"Please touch the region you want to start from among the following."

└ 1. Albitz Kingdom

└ 2. Braham Kingdom

└ 3. Holy Empire

└ 4. Elsorium

[If you don't choose within the time limit, it will be randomly selected.] [Time remaining until selection ends: 00:00:59]

While people pondered over the options that appeared, the followers of the Cult of the Reapers knew exactly where to go.

"I'll go first, Lord of the Black Scythe."

"Me too."

As Heo Taeseok and Seo Arin tried to move, Minjoo hastily shouted.

"Wait a moment! Get buffs before you go!"

After quickly applying buffs to the group, words of gratitude were exchanged.

"Thank you, Minister Minjoo."

"You'll receive blessings!"

"Good luck to everyone in this round too!"

After exchanging words of encouragement, as they pressed the choice, it disappeared as usual.

"Lord of the Black Scythe, please receive buffs too."

"Thank you."

Ryu Min, who had secretly anticipated it, could still put on a pleasant smile when receiving buffs.

Although he didn't particularly need buffs, who knows with people?

"The Archangel might show up again for revenge."

Since Sariel had appeared before, the possibility of another appearance was high this time.

After Jo Yongho's mercenary group, Heo Taeseok, and Minjoo disappeared, only Ryu Min remained.

Chirp chirp

Ryu Min, who had fallen into a lush forest, looked around.

"This is the right place."

The reason he chose Elsorium was simple.
ChatGPT

"I need to obtain runestones in the elves' treasure warehouse."

It would have been impossible if it were just a friendly relationship, but with an eternal alliance reputation, they would willingly provide the treasure warehouse, even Princess Yufenelsia.

Especially in Elsorium, where the Council of Elders held power, the position of the princess was relatively weak.

Sinister - Sinister -

Ryu Min, pushing through the bushes, looked ahead.

"It's over there."

Only dense trees were visible, but for some reason, an unfamiliar energy could be felt.

As Ryu Min walked a bit more and stepped over the boundary, suddenly,

Whoaah -

The dense bushes and trees that were visible until a moment ago disappeared, and a clean, magnificent structure with impressive height unfolded before him.

Covered by a magical barrier, it was Elsorium, the elf city.

"The buildings are splendid."

Ryu Min moved his steps, looking up at the buildings of the scale of an elf-created kingdom.

After passing a bridge over a river with a flowing azure stream, when he reached the entrance, the elf guards, who were guarding the entrance, blocked his way, crossing their spears in a grand manner.

"Why has a human come here?"

"Turn back!"

Despite the cold words, Ryu Min's gaze went into the air without paying much attention.

[The special round trait 'Translation' is in effect.] [You can communicate with the races of the otherworld.] [You can communicate with all players without a language barrier.]

Fortunately, it seemed there would be no problem in conversing with NPCs.

"Human! Is your tongue darkened?"

"I told you to go back... huh?"

The guards, who were planning to block the way because he was a human, were astonished when they confirmed Ryu Min's face.

As if they knew who he was.

"Ah, oh, by any chance, are you the warrior of the otherworld, Lord of the Black Scythe?"

"If you see, you'll know."

When he replied coldly, the guards, who had regained their composure, bowed their heads 90 degrees.

"S, sorry for not recognizing you, sir!"

"P, pardon our rudeness earlier!"

The attitudes of the guards changed completely.

The 'eternal alliance' was a reputation that could be obtained when saving the race, surpassing individual recognition. Even receiving treatment above nobility was not strange.

"Alright, call the Council of Elders. I need to meet them."

"The, the elders?"

"I have something to request directly."
ChatGPT

"Please wait for a moment. I will summon them shortly."

Ryu Min waited leisurely, watching the guard hurry away.
