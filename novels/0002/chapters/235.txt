Title: The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 235

The Proposal of the Archangel

"Hey, Angel? Angel?"

Despite asking several times with a small mukbang, there was no response from the angel.

"Can't you hear me?"

It seemed like the angel could only convey its own intentions rather than reading inner thoughts.

"Why do you need me?"

The mukbang, following the angel, stopped and turned around.

Suddenly, people on the meadow had come so far that they looked like ants.

"Why would you bring me to a place like this, avoiding the eyes of others... Could it be?"

A smile appeared on the mukbang's face.

"Are you secretly giving hidden rewards to me?"

Had the effort the mukbang had made so far been recognized by the angels?

So, they were secretly calling to give rewards without others knowing.

Such hopeful thoughts continued until the angel descended from the sky.

[Why are you laughing like that, human?]

"Oh, no. Hehe. By the way, what could be the reason for me to have something to do..."

[It's not me who has something for you; it's the Archangel.]

"Archangel?"

[I don't know why, but the Archangel wants to meet you. Consider it an honor.]

The mukbang silently celebrated inside.

"As expected! I knew it was a hidden reward!"

Although they wanted to shout and jump for joy, they showed patience in front of the angel.

But they couldn't hide the rising corners of their mouth.

[Why do you keep smiling?]

"Haha, oh, it's nothing. I just feel happy thinking about meeting the Archangel."

[You seem to know something. Shall we go meet the Archangel?]

"Yes!"

[Hold my hand for 10 seconds. We'll move to the heavenly realm.]

"Ah."

The angel's hand, held for the first time, was soft.

The smiling smile was like the warm sunshine of a spring day.

"Oh, Archangel. I think I'm in love right now..."

As the seemingly eternal 10 seconds passed, the mukbang could no longer form thoughts.

It wasn't because a dazzling world like heaven unfolded in front of them.

It was because an incomprehensible message appeared in red letters.

Translation:

"You have left your seat during the ongoing round. If you do not return to the venue within 1 hour, your player qualification will be revoked. Time remaining until disqualification: 00:59:59."

"Huh? W-what is this message? Disqualification? Angel. I just got a strange mess..."

The mukbang, looking at the angel's face, couldn't continue speaking for a moment. The warm, spring-like face had disappeared, replaced by a sinister smile.

"Hehe, foolishly followed along for so long, huh?"

"Angel...?"

"I'm no angel. You're like a scavenger. Don't look at me with those eyes, as if I'm unlucky."

The angel's usual polite tone had changed. It seemed there was no need for politeness in the heavenly realm.

Ignoring the shocked mukbang, the angel muttered to the empty space.

"Yes, yes. Just brought them. Ah, yes, I'll wait."

Realizing the situation belatedly, the mukbang's expression distorted.

"I-I was deceived! It wasn't about giving rewards!"

"Are you insane? When did I say I would give you rewards? And I didn't lie. The fact that the Archangel wants to meet you is true."

"What?"

At that moment, a radiance shimmered before their eyes. Blinking reflexively, the mukbang saw an angel they hadn't seen before, a handsome man with wings and grace beyond comparison.

"I humbly greet the great Archangel." "Rise, Milen." "Huh?! You, you even know my name. Uh, it's an honor!"

The mukbang felt a sense of self-reflection watching the angel, who had just roared, now making a shy girl-like expression.

[Go back now and continue the round. If you leave the seat for too long, you might be suspected.] [Understood. It was an honor to meet you. Well then, I'll be going...]

As Milen disappeared, only the male angel and the mukbang remained on the cloud.

"I am the 7th Archangel... No, should I say one of the 3? I am Gabriel, the 2nd-ranked among the 3 Archangels. Your nickname is 'Mukbang,' right?"

"Y-yes."

The mukbang replied in a polite tone unconsciously. It seemed necessary in the presence of such dignity and awe, different from any angel they had seen before.

Translation:

"You probably understand from the message. If an hour passes, your player qualification will be revoked simply for coming to heaven."

"...."

"Of course, there's no way for you to go back from here. Only the angels here can freely go between heaven and other realms."

"Why are you doing this to me? P-please let me go back."

"If you want to go back, wouldn't losing your qualification be better? You won't have to participate in the survival game anymore."

"Oh?"

Upon hearing that, it became clear. Losing player qualification meant being excluded from the game. There would be no need to fight for survival.

"Instead, you'll lose the power of the player and return to being an ordinary person. But for you, that might be a better life. Rather than facing the constant risk of not knowing when you might perish. Don't you think so?"

"Y-yes."

Although they had loudly declared they would clear up to Round 20 and fulfill their wish, deep down, they were unsure. It was an unpredictable journey ahead, filled with unknown and challenging quests.

"I want to go back if possible. To my original life."

Revenge, bravado, and the power of the player were unnecessary. They just wanted to live.

Such thoughts shook Mukbang's heart.

"S-so, if I wait here for just one hour, can I return as an ordinary person?"

"Yes, but I won't let it be that way. I'll send you back to the other realm before your qualification is revoked. If you reject my proposal, that is."

"Proposal?"

"Do you know who the Black Scythe is?"

At the sudden mention of the nickname, Mukbang's expression turned cold.

"Yes, I do..."

"He bears a grudge against him, doesn't he?"

"..."

"No need to say it; I already know. I've investigated everything. You want revenge against the Black Scythe. Calling trash like you here was also because of that."

"W-what do you want from me?"

Gabriel looked a bit surprised at Mukbang, who quickly grasped the context.

"Well, you're not as foolish as I thought. Before getting to the main point..."

A gleaming object appeared in Gabriel's hand.

It was an old-looking book with a large purple gem embedded in it.

"Take this first."

Translation:

Mukbang, after receiving the book, absentmindedly peered into the bead and was surprised.

"What's this? It seemed like something was moving inside the bead..."

Now, there was nothing visible. It must have been an illusion.

"What is this? This unpleasant book?"

"It's a kind of warp device. If you place this on the player's body and memorize the activation code, you can bring them to heaven."

"Heaven?"

Gabriel nodded and explained further.

"Attach this to the Black Scythe's body and recite the activation code. That way, you can forcefully move him to heaven. In other words, you can strip him of player qualification, just like you."

"Oh..."

"How about it? If I bring the Black Scythe to heaven as I command, we can exclude him from the rounds, right? You wouldn't want your competitor to reach Round 20 and fulfill their wish, would you?"

Mukbang nodded silently.

If things went as the Archangel said, the Black Scythe would win.

They didn't want to see him prosper, no matter what.

"But why specifically bring the Black Scythe?"

"He committed a very, very serious offense that disrupted the order of heaven. So, he must come to heaven and receive proper punishment."

"What kind of punishment...?"

"You don't need to know the details. Just know that it will be so painful that he'd wish for death. So don't worry. I'll take care of his revenge for you. You just need to warp him to heaven."

"So, if I do that, as promised, I'll also be excluded from the survival game?"

"Of course. After punishing the Black Scythe, I'll bring you to heaven, strip you of player qualification. You can live as a regular person without being entangled in the survival game."

"I won't have to live in this other realm with a customized body, right?"

"Of course not. As soon as your player qualification is revoked, the avatar will disappear, leaving only your soul. If you helped apprehend the sinner, I'll use my power to let your soul return to Earth. If you wish, I can even assist you in living with angels in heaven."

Although Mukbang's heart desired to live in heaven, giving birth to cute children like rabbits with beautiful angels, it seemed unlikely...

Translation:

"They're not going to like me, the angels..."

Thinking of the angel who treated them like a bug just a while ago, Mukbang felt a strong desire to go home.

"I'll go back to Earth and live a normal life."

"Oh? If you want, I'll allow it. Just complete the tasks as instructed."

"I will. I'll definitely do it."

For Mukbang, it was an opportunity that wouldn't come twice. A chance to escape the survival game and seek revenge against the Black Scythe. It was an offer that couldn't be refused, as there was nothing to lose.

"If I just attach the book to my body and memorize the activation code, I can strip his qualification, right?"

Even a strong figure like the Black Scythe would be helpless if warped to heaven. Since angels were the only ones with the ability to traverse dimensions.

"Probably, without being able to do anything, his qualification will be revoked, and he'll be dragged away by the angels. Heh heh heh."

It was said to be a punishment so painful it felt like death, making it perfect for revenge.

But upon careful consideration, there was a problem.

"Um..."

"What is it?"

"Can I attach this to the Black Scythe's body? If I get close, he might notice due to his detection ability..."

"It's fine. You only need a moment. Attach it, memorize the activation code, and it will activate immediately."

"Well, it's just that I'm a bit worried because he's quite formidable..."

Mukbang hesitated and then got to the point.

"Hey, is there any chance you could give me an item or something? It would be better if it's something good. It might be awkward if he senses it before I attach it."

"This damn human..."

For a moment, Gabriel's eyebrows twitched, but it was indeed just a moment.

"Don't worry. The Black Scythe won't pay attention to you while he's busy with the rounds. If you're really anxious, act in the last 10 waves."

"10 waves?"

"By then, people will be quite confused. It's the perfect timing for you to strike."

"Oh, it would be better to move at that time."

"Good. The activation code is 'La Gracie Beta Om.' Remember it and use it when the time comes."

"That's a strange activation code. Got it. I'll give it a try."

At the moment the round was about to begin, Mukbang returned to the meadow.

Translation:

It was all thanks to the Archangel warping them back to the other realm.

"You've returned. It's not a dream, is it?"

Not a dream or anything like that.

The book received from the angel was sitting in the inventory.

Is it because it's an item from heaven?
