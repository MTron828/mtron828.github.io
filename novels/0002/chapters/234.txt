Title: "Episode 234 of the 100th Regression for Max Level Players"

Start of Round 14

As soon as it turned midnight on February 1st, a meadow unfolded before Ryu Min's eyes.

'It's been a while since I've seen a meadow.'

Perhaps because he had been starting in monochrome spaces lately, it felt like a long time.

'First, should I check the special reward I chose last time?'

Looking at the skill window, there was a reward received exclusively for this round.

[Temporary Skill – Invincibility]

Effect: Immediately becomes immune to all damage. The duration is 60 seconds, and it's a one-time use skill.

The duration of invincibility is 1 minute.

For a temporary skill, it's quite long.

'The problem is that it's a one-time use skill.'

Since it can only be used once, it needs to be used carefully.

Of course, Ryu Min knew exactly when and against whom he should use it.

'I'll use this to break the sub-quest and obtain the Rune of Predation. If variables arise, I'll have to deal with it.'

The variable mentioned here is the 'angels.'

Ryu Min has killed four out of the seven archangels so far.

Even if he doesn't know, angels from the sky are likely to come after him.

Surely, in this round too, they will send an archangel to assassinate him.

'Who should I send? Now that only the top 3 remain, should I send one from the 2nd or 3rd place? Or all three?'

He might face a crisis in this round.

No matter how strong he has become, he cannot guarantee victory against all three archangels.

'If things get tough, I have no choice but to give up the sub-quest and use invincibility.'

Of course, he will use it when he feels it's dangerous after facing the opponent a few times.

'Whoever is coming, come and try.'

While waiting with his fist clenched, more players appeared in the meadow.

Their number was approximately 4,000.

At a glance, it may seem like a lot, but these are all the players remaining in the world.

'After this round, only half of them will survive. In the next round, it will decrease to a quarter again.'

It was grim, but Ryu Min couldn't stop the decreasing number of participants.

Unless he becomes the creator of the game.

[Hello, everyone. Welcome to Round 14!]

As the participants gathered, angels appeared with a bright demeanor.
ChatGPT

[In the previous round, there were 4,997 survivors, right? But now it's reduced to 4,608, a decrease of 389?]

The angels were amazed, but the people didn't show much reaction.

Well, they knew why the number had decreased through the news.

'Everyone knows. That I killed them.'

The black scythe had thoroughly eradicated the criminal players to the point where no one remained unaware.

The only ones who didn't know were the angels.

'Why did it decrease? Did they kill each other to steal items? Stupidly?'

As the number decreases, the number of survivors TO tends to decrease.

Mocking the angels for being foolish was the reason for this, but Ryu Min did not regret killing the criminals.

'If I hadn't killed them, it would have caused even greater harm.'

What if Ryu Min hadn't saved the country in crisis?

The dystopia would have accelerated, and the world would not have escaped the atmosphere of collapse.

The criminal players would have become more arrogant and indulged in all sorts of wickedness.

In the process, the number of ordinary people sacrificed would have been countless.

'It's fortunate that I cleaned up that trash even now. If I had let it go, I would have been shaken by the rottenness.'

Of course, there was also a way to kill them in the other world after finding out their nicknames.

Then there would be no reduction in survivors TO.

'Instead, I probably wouldn't have received the hero treatment like now.'

It wasn't to warn and eliminate criminals in public for the sake of attention seekers.

It was to announce the existence of the black scythe and raise its reputation.

Even if it showed players around the world what happens when you commit a crime, it would serve as a warning and decrease.

'That way, in Round 15, they'll obediently follow my control. Sending a gaze like now.'

Looking around, the gaze of the players looking at him was different.

A gaze mixed with admiration and fear.

It was inevitable.

Even ordinary people idolized the black scythe, so why wouldn't players?

'Well, I must be fearsome. They should be afraid.'

Just looking at him would make some freeze or turn their heads.

Some felt guilty and moved away in fear.

'Whatever. It's fine. If the number is small, you all are the only ones at a loss. Got it? I'll tell you about the Round 14 quest or something.'

As the chattering angel waved its wings, a message appeared.
ChatGPT

◀ ROUND 14 ▶

└Survive through a total of 10 monster waves

[Integrated Zone CA-EA001]

└Participants: 4,608

└Achievers: 0/2,304

"Monster waves?"

The faces of the players looking at the quest were generally calm.

They had already experienced a similar mission.

"Is it a mission like the 3rd round, enduring waves?"

"Do we just need to survive?"

The 3rd round was a mission to protect artifacts during five waves.

This round was a simple mission to survive through ten waves.

'But still, it's crucial not to let your guard down.'

There was one more rule, but the angels who enjoyed deceiving players wouldn't reveal it.

They would rather mock it as being easy.

[In this round, you just need to block a total of 10 monster waves. That's it. Isn't it really easy?]

The angel chuckled, but there were no players fooled by the smile.

'Believing the word "easy" straightforwardly has only resulted in a surprise attack from behind a couple of times.'

[Monsters will appear every 30 minutes in proportion to the number of players. Initially, weak monsters will come out, but as it progresses, gradually stronger ones will appear.]

"Angel! What if we can't clear the monsters within 30 minutes?"

In response to someone's question, the angel grinned.

[It's simple. Once 30 minutes pass, the next monster will appear. It doesn't matter if there are remaining monsters from the previous wave. When the time comes, the next wave will proceed without fail.]

"Ah... then we should try to clear the waves as much as possible within 30 minutes."

"Otherwise, the monsters will accumulate continuously..."

[Exactly. If you don't clear the monsters quickly, you'll be in trouble because of the next wave of monsters. This vast meadow might end up filled with monsters.]

The key to the mission was to defeat the monsters as quickly as possible.

[There might be some foolish humans who, in an attempt to survive, run away from the monsters. For those humans, we have prepared something. Would you like to take a look around?]

Looking around the meadow, there was a transparent dome-shaped barrier enclosing it.
ChatGPT

[We've sealed off all directions with a protective barrier to prevent anyone from escaping. You can think of it as a kind of arena.]

The angel seemed to mock the idea of escape, as if saying, "Dream on."

"We have to block 10 waves together..."

"Does that mean we're all in a party?"

In response to someone's muttering, the angel nodded in agreement, flicking its finger.

[You said it well. Yes, for this round, you all are considered a party, and experience points and gold will be distributed according to the number of people. However, keep in mind that the final settlement will be based on contributions after all waves are completed.]

"What about the ranking method?"

[The ranking method is also based on contributions. Your contributions will be converted into scores and included in the list of survivors.]

Ranking is measured based on contributions?

That means one needs to kill as many monsters as possible or contribute significantly to killing monsters.

'It's truly a round favorable for strong individuals. Like me.'

For Ryu Min, who can easily accumulate contributions by killing dozens of monsters with just a few swings of his scythe, building up contributions is not a difficult task.

The first place in the rankings for this round is already reserved for him.

'But I can't monopolize contributions alone. I need to leave some for others.'

If he decides to take everything for himself, his contribution to his teammates will decrease, ultimately leading to their failure to survive.

'That's not an option. At least I need to leave as much as the share of the followers of the Death Cult.'

Ryu Min has already informed the believers about the characteristics of the round and strategies for each wave.

Not only that, but he has also distributed unused equipment, so building up contributions should not be too challenging.

[Now, get ready as we'll start the quest in a moment!]

'Just start it right away. What preparations do we need?'

Ryu Min chuckled, not considering it a big deal.

Little did he know that the angel had other plans.

And...

Unaware that someone behind him was sending ominous glances.

When is the moment in life when one feels that it is unfair?

Is it when one realizes the wealth gap while watching the rich spend money like water?
ChatGPT

When is it that life feels unfair?

When you get promoted faster than others because of your friendship with the boss?

When you inevitably yield to greater power and violence?

There could be various situations, but ultimately, it could be condensed into one thing.

It's when you lack power.

'Without power, you get trampled on by others. Whether it's money, authority, or violence.'

[Small Mukbang] has already experienced being trampled upon.

By the chairman of Plseva.

'He's like a guy who wouldn't even be refreshing if you ground him up. Is it right to kick someone out just because they said something wrong?'

He used to be a high-ranking official in charge of Plseva's important affairs, but that was only temporary.

Now he is blocked and unable to access the site, marked as a blacklist.

All because of a single comment made nine months ago.

"Why did Black Scythe apply for membership and still remain submerged until now?"

"Maybe it wasn't originally the Black Scythe?"

"I guess it makes sense if it's an impersonator... that sounds plausible."

"Really, a figure like Black Scythe joining 'this cafe'...?"

"Mukbang-nim? Did you just say 'this cafe'? How is our cafe any different?"

"As of now, Mukbang-nim is relieved of his position as an executive. We will register him on the blacklist, so adapt to the new era when it comes."

After being mercilessly discarded during a video conference by Chairman Plseva.

Small Mukbang has been enduring it all alone.

Seeking revenge against the chairman.

'I'd love to find and kill that chairman, but I don't know his nickname or face...'

There seemed to be no way to find him.

Because Chairman Plseva was not a player but an ordinary person.

Small Mukbang was unaware of this fact.

'As long as I know his real name, I should be able to track him down, considering it's not his real face.'

With such thoughts, he sought help from various private investigators, but in the end, he only lost money without making progress.

Now, he's almost given up on finding the chairman.

What can you do when there's no way to find him?

However, his heart is still filled with the resentment and bitterness of that time.

'It's all because of Black Scythe, that bastard. I got kicked out while talking about that bastard!'

Upon closer inspection, it was his own fault, not Black Scythe's, but Small Mukbang needed someone to blame.
ChatGPT

He needed a target to express his accumulated anger.

That target was the current Black Scythe.

"You bastard, just die! Damn hero, you trash!"

Every month, he spat curses at the back of Black Scythe in the otherworld, but he could only do it in his mind.

Unwilling to admit it, there was a vast difference in power between Black Scythe and himself.

He was aware that Black Scythe was an existence he couldn't dare to touch.

"The world is irrational and unfair. Damn it, go to hell! This damn world!"

While blaming the chairman, blaming Black Scythe, and blaming the world, Small Mukbang never blamed himself.

Even as he cursed the world to collapse, Small Mukbang wanted to save his own life.

Revenge and blaming others were only possible if he stayed alive.

"I will survive. I will survive until Round 20 and make a wish to have an undeniable power. So, Chairman and Black Scythe, you bastards, all of you will kneel before me and beg for forgiveness."

Smirking with a bitter smile, Small Mukbang, who was glaring at the back of Black Scythe, suddenly turned his head.

He turned his gaze abruptly, causing someone here to think they were being looked at.

"Oh, damn, that startled me. Why does that guy move so quickly? I almost had a heart attack. Anyway, looking at the mission, Black Scythe will be the first again this round? What a filthy world."

Upon hearing that the ranking is determined by the monster contribution, the results were already evident.

"For now, I have to work hard to at least reach the cut line."

At that moment, he heard a voice in his head.

"Small Mukbang?"

"Huh? What? I feel like I've heard this voice somewhere before."

"Look over here. Small Mukbang. No, not there, here. In the sky!"

Raising his head, he saw the guiding angel observing him.

"Yes, here!"

"Right now, the angel is trying to say..."

"Hey, don't pretend you don't know. Shut up and listen!"
ChatGPT

Upon hearing the angel's words, Small Mukbang tightly sealed his lips.

He couldn't understand why this was happening.

"I have something to discuss with you."

"Me?"

"We have something to talk about, so please follow quietly. Without letting others know."

As if indicating to follow, the angel gestured and slowly moved through the sky.

Small Mukbang, with a bewildered expression, had no choice but to follow.
