Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 185"

TOP 10

The prophet spoke.

He said that in the 11th round, one must definitely grab the person who saves lives.

If you miss him, you won't even make it past the 15th round and will die.

'Oh no, how did I survive?'

Kristin quickly appealed about herself and stepped forward.

"Do you know how useful I am? Haha, if you get hurt, I can heal you, apply buffs to defend against abnormal conditions, and..."

"All those things are unnecessary for me."

"What?"

"I don't need healing because I never get hurt, and my resistance to abnormal conditions is already high. There's no reason to go with a priest."

"..."

Certainly, priests are excellent supporters for survival.

Healing is the opposite of emergency care, and as the rounds progress, there is nothing as fearsome as resistance to abnormal conditions and debuffs.

The need for healers is essential enough for Ryumin to acknowledge.

'Only in the late game, though.'

Once you reach level 60, a priest learns the resurrection skill.

It's only at that point that it's somewhat worth bringing a healer for insurance.

'But now, they're utterly useless. Just like baggage.'

Kristin seems to acknowledge this fact as well, unable to say anything and just bowing her head.

No, reading her thoughts, it's not that she's intimidated, but rather desperately trying to find another option.

This is because of Ryumin's prophecy that says she must be with the Black Scythe.

"Don't worry, Kristin. I have no reason to betray you."

Unless you know how strong the boss battle will be, a priest who can resurrect once more is crucial.

However, for now, there is a need to keep a distance with a suitable excuse.

"This round is a team battle where you can earn points by killing the opposing team. You and I are competitors with different territories and races. Do you think we can cooperate in such a situation? Do you believe in me?"

"...You saved me, didn't you?"

"If I save you twice, will you suggest we get married?"

"..."

"Do you trust me that much, even though we just met?"

In truth, what Kristin believes in is the prophecy.
ChatGPT

Because of the saying that one must cling to the Eastern Rope to survive, he had been hanging onto the Black Scythe. However, after hearing the advice of the Black Scythe, his thoughts changed.

'I can trust this person.'

Even though they had only briefly met, he understood his situation and troubles and offered advice.

A man with both strength and insight.

Moreover, he looked sturdy on the surface, so why wouldn't he hang onto him?

"Yes... I trust you. I trust you."

'Phew, this is crazy.'

While watching Kristin, who was somehow trying to stick to him, Ryumin inwardly sighed.

"It's good that I made the priest on my side. It's good, but..."

For now, he's not needed.

Most rounds, Ryumin can handle them alone.

It's more comfortable to go alone.

'It's surprising that skeptical Kristin believes in the prophecy like this.'

Saving her life is one thing, but gaining her favor through advice from the first meeting seems to be the main reason.

The problem is that to make use of her, it has to be at least the 15th round.

"I'll say it again, we can't cooperate because we're from different territories. There's no way to help each other accumulate points. If you want to help, survive this round and then think about it."

"Then, can I follow you from the next round?"

'She's persistent. Very persistent.'

He grumbled internally, but it wasn't incomprehensible since it was a desperate plea for survival.

"Sure. So, for now, survive this round. Instead of following me, earn points for the dead, so you can rank high, right?"

With a reasonable argument, Kristin nodded.

"Thank you for the advice. Also, for saving my life."

"Well then, I'm out."

As if saying thanks was unnecessary, Ryumin turned his back and left, leaving behind Kristen's eyes filled with regret.

'Finally let go of her.'

Ryumin sighed as if he had finally let go of his ex-girlfriend's obsession.

To check the points and remaining time, he opened the quest progress window.

[Korean Team's Points: 733,270] [Black Scythe's Points: 13,240] [Time Remaining Until Round End: 22:21:59]

Looking at the team points, he saw that they had accumulated 700,000 points.
ChatGPT

"Roughly around 700 people, so each person must have accumulated about 1,000 points."

Earning just 1,000 points in almost two hours.

"Even clearing a simple one-hour quest would earn around 1,000 points..."

The team's performance was lower than expected.

"Well, there are still 22 hours left."

Ryumin knew that the survival cut-off for the 11th round was 13 million points.

With 20,000 points each over the next 24 hours, they could survive.

Of course, Ryumin was not satisfied with just survival.

"Surpassing 13 million points is not a big deal."

The goal for this round was to achieve the top score for both the team and individually.

He was confident.

With only one hour left in the time limit, the final turnaround would begin.

"Until then, I need to focus as much as possible and earn points."

He couldn't allow any disruptors like Magyeongrok or the Black Society to interfere.

To prevent that, Ryumin wore the Doppleganger's Ring.

"[Please call out the nickname you want to change to.] [You cannot use existing nicknames.] [However, the nickname of a deceased person is available.]"

Ryumin chose a nickname that his acquaintances wouldn't recognize.

"Lost Yak."

"[The nickname 'Black Scythe' will be changed to 'Lost Yak.']"

Not only the nickname but also wearing the Assassin's Mask, he transformed his face.

"Someone might recognize me as they pass by."

Both the nickname and appearance.

He became a complete Lost Yak.

Now, no one could track him.

Thinking about Lost Yak's appearance and nickname would be necessary.

"If they try to track by thinking about the Black Scythe, it should show that it doesn't exist."

Even if he was treated as a dead person, it didn't matter.

There were runes to disrupt tracking.

"No one will chase me, so should I start earning points in earnest now?"

He had already planned in his mind which quests to tackle and the most efficient route.

"Amplify."

Zap, zap.

Charging his body with electricity, he doubled his movement speed.

Zap!

In an instant, Ryumin disappeared, leaving behind a trail of light.

"Haah, it's damn hard."

So far, the round had lasted for a long 10 hours.
ChatGPT

A time when physiological phenomena like drowsiness or hunger could be endured without much difficulty. However, enduring the 24 hours of the 11th round was an ordeal.

"How many hours are left?"

"4 hours."

"Wow... there's still 4 hours left?"

"I'm starving, seriously."

"I'm so sleepy, it's driving me crazy."

Jo Yongho's mercenaries were experiencing the taste of death. Running around everywhere for about 20 hours to earn points had worn them out.

"Why is our stamina lacking even after reaching level 45?"

"Yeah, we are transcendent beings beyond humans."

"Do you guys know?"

Even a superhuman breaking walls and dodging bullets had no chance against hunger and sleepiness. It was a natural phenomenon as long as they had a physical body, but players had forgotten it, engrossed in the power of their characters.

"Hyungnim! Can't we take a short break? We might die at this rate."

"Yeah, let's take a human break for just 30 minutes."

Ignoring the mercenaries' complaints, Jo Yongho shouted as if saying not to talk nonsense.

"We're risking our lives now, and you're thinking about sleeping? The real body is probably already asleep in the real world. You want to sleep again in this otherworld? If you do that, you might never wake up."

"But people need to sleep, don't they?"

"Hold on for 4 more hours. There's not much time left. We need to do our best until the end for both us and the team to survive."

"This should be considered effort, right?"

"Did each of us earn an average of 20,000 points?"

Thanks to the continuous questing without breaks, Jo Yongho's team earned 20,000 points per person in 20 hours.

It was definitely a considerable number, but they couldn't relax just yet.

"We don't have a benchmark to compare. We don't know if we earned a lot or a little."

"I think we might be in first place. We really did our best."

"Yeah, if we don't get first place after earning points non-stop, wouldn't that be strange?"

"We don't know that. So, we have no choice but to keep moving."

Although his teammates sighed at his words, Jo Yongho was honestly proud. If they were around the middle rank, it would be something to boast about.

They put in effort. All 30 mercenaries, including himself, tirelessly earned points.

"It would be good if we could know our intermediate ranking..."

That's when it happened.
ChatGPT

Exactly when the remaining time hit 4 hours, a message appeared.

"[There are 4 hours left until the current round ends.] [At this point, we will reveal the rankings and TOP 10 of this area.]"

1st. C3-ECHNA003 China (28,031,020 points)

2nd. C3-EBRA004 Brazil (27,712,410 points)

3rd. C3-EMXA003 Mexico (27,444,030 points)

4th. C3-EINDA001 India (26,991,150 points)

5th. C3-ECHNA005 China (26,896,020 points)

………………

…………

10th. C3-EJPNA002 Japan (25,558,180 points)

It was absurd that China had two teams in the top 10, but there was something even more bewildering.

[Your team (C3-ESKA001 Korea) has 11,219,170 points, ranking 92nd out of a total of 190 areas.]

"What?"

"We're only ranked 92nd?"

To survive, they needed to be within the top 95.

If they made a mistake, their rank would be pushed back, and they wouldn't make the cut line.

"Does this make sense? After all our hard work?"

The team points were unexpectedly low, and someone seemed to be playing around.

"Why are neighboring countries like China and Japan ranking so high?"

"The team sizes should be similar with around 700 members per team, right?"

"Darn it, probably went around killing members of other teams. That's how they earned more points."

"Right. Just look at China in 1st place. They've already gathered 28 million points, which means they earned 40,000 points per person, isn't that absurd?"

"Surely they must have killed people every time they passed by, more than doing quests."

Killing a few people seemed to earn more points than doing quests.

The mercenaries felt disheartened, thinking their efforts so far might have been in vain.

"Hey, everyone. We can still survive. Let's put in a bit more effort. We might get pushed out beyond the cut line if we make a mistake."

Jo Yongho encouraged the excited team, emphasizing that they had no choice but to keep trying.

'If we can't earn points, not only our colleagues here but also the Black Scythe may die.'
ChatGPT

Jo Yongho and the mercenaries moved their bodies, stating that they had no choice but to earn more points.

There was no time to delay if they wanted to make a final sprint in the remaining time.

"It's ambiguous."

Ryumin, who had just checked the ranking of the Korean team, grumbled dissatisfiedly.

"It's at the level of chin-ups even if we do well. I wonder what would have happened if I wasn't here."

Still, the points of the Korean team, with top-ranked players, were too low.

'It wasn't this low at first. We were in the middle.'

However, Ryu Min's interference with the killings by Ma Kyungrok and Ju Seongtak caused the team points to plummet.

'I know it, but it's bitter. The fact that the ranking drops sharply if you don't commit murder.'

Trying to do quests fairly would only earn a meager amount. That's why angels wanted to see humans killing each other to reduce their lives.

But earning points only through murder was not the only way.

There was still a chance for a last-minute turnaround.

'The last-minute turnaround, which can be considered the last chance for those in the lower ranks, is nothing but a 'gamble.''

'And the only way to win that gamble is by divine intervention.'

When there was 1 hour left until the time limit, a message would appear.

Until then, Ryu Min would collect bullets by doing quests.

He had been silently accumulating points with that thought when a message appeared in front of Ryu Min.

The time had come.

[There is 1 hour left until the current round ends.] [As a special event, the 'Gambling Den' will open.] [In the Gambling Den, you can multiply your points up to 200 times.] [Note that the location of the Gambling Den is undisclosed.]
