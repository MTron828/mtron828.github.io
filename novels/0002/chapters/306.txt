Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 306"

Marbas's Special Skill

Three harpies each grabbed a woman and flew into the sky.

"That lion-clawed demon. We're not at a level to deal with him."

Watching Seoarin's summoned creatures being easily dispatched by the lion, Yamti realized something.

That they were not at the level to confront him.

Not against his egg-rock-throwing abilities.

"We can't just die meaninglessly. In that case...."

Yamti's decision was to do their best to escape.

Setting up a monster wall to block the view, her plan was to flee into the sky.

"In terms of speed, escaping on the ground is impossible. So flying into the sky is the best option."

Since there were no wings on his back, they could only hope he couldn't fly.

Tearing into three was also an attempt to save at least one person in case he chased after them.

Of course, it was not a plan discussed with Minjuri and Seoarin.

There was no time for that.

Perhaps that's why confusion was evident in their expressions.

"Yamti unnie! What are you doing right now?"

"Did unnie give the order? To fly away into the sky?"

"Yes! So stop talking nonsense and pray to survive! This is the best option for now!"

Confusion soon turned into acceptance.

Yamti's decision was the best for now.

That lion demon couldn't be defeated no matter what.

"I hope it's a demon that can't fly...!"

However, the hope of the three soon turned into despair.

[Haha, you came up with an interesting plan. Did you think I couldn't fly?]

Could this be the situation where wings appeared on the lion's back?

On Marbas's back, large bat wings that were not seen before were fluttering.

[Relying on such monsters to escape. You're just lowly humans.]

"Rip them all apart!"

Feeling the ominous atmosphere, Yamti gave the order to the harpies.

The hope was that if they split into three, at least one could survive.

But...

Splat!

Marbas grabbed a harpy's head with one hand and crushed it, and the movement was incredibly swift.

They killed all three harpies almost simultaneously.

"Ahh!"

"Kyaa!"

The three women fell below 10m.

Thud!

Since they were not ordinary humans, they didn't suffer severe injuries.

It was fortunate that they didn't fall from a higher point.

However, the situation was far from hopeful.

"Ugh...."

Whether their legs were sprained or not, all three found it difficult to move.

Marbas gracefully landed beside them, as they groaned.

[Pitiful prey. Did you think such a clumsy escape would work?]

"...."

[Now, you can't escape, and what else can you show me? Do everything you can. I'll give you a chance.]

Although Marbas showed a relaxed attitude, there was nothing the three could do.

Seoarin still had a cooldown, Minjuri lacked combat skills, and Yamti had already summoned all her stored monsters.

[Gone? Nothing more to show? Well, then, shall we begin?]

They didn't want to ask or know what he meant by starting something.

They had a vague idea.

[Now, whose limbs shall we tear off first?]

The lion's gaze turned towards Minjuri.

[I considered tearing you apart earlier, but you didn't even scream when you fell. Surprisingly, you seem good at enduring pain.]

With a disinterested expression, Marbas shifted his gaze to Seoarin.

[Alright. It seems like you might scream. Let's start with you.]

Marbas's large hand grabbed Seoarin's arm.

At that moment, as she trembled like a leaf from fear, an unexpected voice was heard.

"Wait a moment!"

It was Minjuri's voice.

"You already made your choice. Why are you changing to someone else?"

[Hooh.]

Turning his head, Marbas looked at Minjuri with an interesting expression.

[In all the humans I've killed so far, this is the first time one wants their own arm to be torn off first.]

"If, if you've already chosen me as the first target, you shouldn't switch to someone else."

[But I think you won't scream interestingly.]

"What if, what if I make it interesting?"

[Hm?]
ChatGPT

"Should I scream as loudly as possible while enduring the pain?"

Marbas's smirk extended up to his ears.

[Hehe, that would be the perfect touch. However, I sense there might be some conditions.]

"I'll make it interesting. But in return..."

Minjuri glanced at Seoarin and Yamti.

"Please promise to let the others go."

"Minjuri..."

[Hehe, is this what humans call sacrifice? It's truly pathetic.]

Marbas's face was filled with mockery, even if he called it tearful.

[Sacrificing for others is a noble spirit. Really. However,]

Suddenly, the laughter disappeared, and a sharp gaze replaced it.

[You seem to misunderstand your role, human woman.]

Marbas snapped his fingers.

In that moment, with a bang, Minjuri's body transformed into a sheep.

"Baa!"

It was a real sheep.

The surreal sight left Seoarin and Yamti wide-eyed.

[Bargaining for your life, and daring to propose to me in such circumstances?]

"Mi-Minjuri!"

"What, what did you do to Minjuri?"

In response to the shocked women, Marbas smirked and assumed a pretentious expression.

[Don't you see? Your companion has transformed into a sheep.]

"A sheep?"

[My special skill is transformation. I make insignificant humans into something marginally useful.]

"Baa!"

Although the transformed Minjuri bleated, a sheep was still just a sheep.

[What? You wanted to scream interestingly? How pathetic. If you want to be a clown, I'll make you one.]

"Pl-Please return Minjuri!"

This time, Seoarin found the courage.

However, courage and recklessness were a thin line she didn't recognize.

[What if I undo the transformation? Will the situation change? Or...]

Snap!

Marbas grabbed Seoarin's arm again.

[Are you proposing to me too? Asking to free your comrades?]

"Ahh!"

As she applied pressure as if it would break, Seoarin felt intense pain.

[Kukuku, look at this. The scream is beautiful, isn't it? My choice was not wrong after all.]

With an amused laugh, Marbas suddenly showed a fierce expression.

[Can't just let go of a hard-caught prey, can I?]
ChatGPT

"Ah, no!"

Ignoring Yamti's scream, Marbas chuckled and exerted force on his hand.

He tore off Seoarin's arm, the sound squelching.

Screams erupted from the horrifying sound, but the voice's owner was not Seoarin.

[Aaaargh!]

Marbas held his own shoulder and screamed as if he were about to collapse.

What had fallen wasn't Seoarin's arm.

"It was almost too late."

Seoarin looked up at a man standing in front of her.

The appearing man had the face of Hwang Yongmin.

He twitched for a moment, but Seoarin recognized his true identity.

"G- Grim Reaper-nim...?"

Before the words finished, Hwang Yongmin's appearance shimmered and transformed into the Grim Reaper's scythe.

Despite the relief at the familiar face, Ryu Min shed no tears.

She simply stared at the demon's face, contorted in pain, with a fierce gaze.

[Aaargh, who the...!]

Marbas, belatedly noticing his opponent, trembled.

'The Grim Reaper?'

The one Plucnictos had strongly warned about, the top-priority dangerous individual to run away from on sight.

He was standing less than 5m away.

'I was monitoring the surroundings in my own way, but when did he...?'

With a gulp, the lion's gaze shifted away.

'D- Can I escape?'

The distance was too close to flee.

Warping, as advised by the demon king, was the only solution.

While being observed with fiery eyes, Ryu Min quietly began to chant the warp spell.

A 10-second countdown.

Only a brief moment was needed.

With that, she could escape this dire situation.

As Marbas secretly memorized the spell while keeping an eye on the Grim Reaper's scythe, a moment came when he unintentionally blinked.

Squelch-

[Aaaargh!]

Terrifying pain surged from the opposite shoulder.

The remaining arm was torn off.

The spell was canceled.

Marbas didn't have the mental strength to endure the damn pain while chanting the spell.

No one would have that strength.

"Where are you trying to run? You're my prey."

[Kuhuhu, huhuhuk...!]

Blood and sweat poured down from Marbas's body like rain.
ChatGPT

She didn't see when or how he moved.

Most importantly, she had heard that his main weapon was a scythe, but he hadn't even drawn it yet.

He had simply torn off her arm with pure strength alone.

Marbas, realizing the difference in strength, looked at her with eyes soaked in terror.

[G-Grim Reaper, le-let's, let's talk.]

"What talk."

[S-So...uh...]

Without waiting for Ryu Min's answer, he pulled out the scythe.

Then, at an invisible speed, Ryu Min accurately pierced Marbas's eyeball.

Squelch!

[Ah, aaaaah!]

"What talk do you have with someone who was trying to tear off my colleague's arm."

As Ryu Min's scythe swiftly moved, it punctured the opposite eyeball as well.

[Aaargh!]

Blood tears flowed from both of Marbas's eye sockets.

"What talk do you have with someone who turned my colleague into a sheep."

Although the front was not visible, Marbas spoke, squeezing his temples.

[Ugh, ughhh. Y-you, you're making a mistake. If you kill me, your colleague's transformation can never be undone... Aaargh!]

This time, one leg was severed.

Thud-

Marbas's body collapsed abruptly.

"You're going to die anyway. It's just a matter of whether you die painfully or comfortably."

[Ah, okay! I got it!]

Marbas released his transformation.

Bang!

Minjuri's body had returned to its original state.

"Grim Reaper-nim!"

Ryu Min silently glanced at her restored companion and then looked down at the lion lying with severed limbs.

Marbas, completely terrified, spoke with a trembling voice.

[I-Is it over now? P-Please kill me quickly...]

"You can't easily kill the prey you've caught."

Ryu Min's scythe struck the remaining leg.

[Kuh-hu-heeck! Ah, I got it! I-I'll give you information!]

"Information?"

[W-Who you came with to this realm, how many came, and for what purpose!]

A smirk appeared on Ryu Min's lips.

"Don't need it."

She had already read Marbas's thoughts and understood everything.

Thunk!

The scythe pierced through the skull.

Marbas's body deflated like a deflated balloon.

'Indeed, if I transform into Hwang Yongmin, he won't recognize me.'

Transforming into Hwang Yongmin instead of the Grim Reaper allowed her to succeed in the surprise attack.

"Is everyone okay?"

At Ryu Min's question, the three nodded with tearful faces.

And sincerely expressed their gratitude.

"Thank you for saving us, Grim Reaper-nim."

If they had been a little later, they could have crossed the Styx River.

Ryu Min was aware of this fact, so she couldn't erase the serious expression on her face.

'Plucnictos is leading eight demon nobles to massacre the players.'

Since everyone was scattered and moving, and they didn't know the faces, tracking each one was a tricky task.

'What should I do? If this continues, the damage will become uncontrollable....'

As Ryu Min made a serious decision, Yamti approached her.

"We saw four demons. Probably, others are also facing demons."

"Likely."

"What should we do?"

Ryu Min, who had made a decision, raised her head.

"You go to the gorge, your original destination. I'll handle the demons."

"But they are likely scattered everywhere. How do you plan to find them...?"

"There's a way."

Ryu Min had a rune that allowed her to circle the Earth more than twenty times in just three seconds.
