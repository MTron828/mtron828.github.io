Title: Episode 131 of the 100th Rebirth for the Max-Level Player

Police Commissioner

After instructing Yamti to track the movements of the police commissioner, Ryu Min hung up the call.

To quickly execute the legislation, cooperation from the commissioner was necessary.

'But it won't be easy just because I say it.'

In that case, dominating and giving orders would suffice.

It was a simple matter.

The only issue remaining was a matter of conscience.

'Using innocent civilians is unavoidable. To quickly establish the Grand Player Division.'

Somewhere, even now, a deranged player might be committing crimes.

Establishing the division as soon as possible would alleviate the anxiety among civilians.

At the same time, it would build his reputation among ordinary people.

That's all Ryu Min wanted from the police commissioner.

After dominating, he would only give orders and have no further involvement.

Then he could continue his usual life, just like the chairman of Plseva.

Domination doesn't mean becoming a puppet without decision-making power.

He would faithfully execute only the parts he ordered.

"Yamti's second position has been won as the police commissioner."

The first was Song Jaegyeom, the eldest son of the LC Group.

He is in charge of the chairman of Plseva, so he cannot be removed.

"The second is to dominate the police commissioner, leaving three positions."

Among them, one position seems to be useful in Nigeria after establishing the division, and if one position is left for a contingency...

"Only one position remains."

There were fewer positions than he thought.

"Just in case, it's best to save positions as much as possible."

Ma Kyungrok, Ahn Sangcheol, Heo Taeseok, Russell, Jo Yongho, etc.

The reason he didn't dominate his acquaintances is here.

There's not enough room for them, and there's no need to dominate them.

They're already his people.

"I have something to ask Representative Lee Seonghyun, but there's no need to dominate him. I gave a good first impression."

Where else could there be a more intense and favorable impression than saving someone's life?

Having organized his thoughts, Ryu Min put on his coat.

Since the topic came up, he decided to visit Representative Lee Seonghyun.

His cooperation would be needed for the establishment of the division.

Ryu Min went out again.

Lee Seonghyun, who worked late at the National Assembly, got into his car.

"Where would you like to go, Representative?"

"Please take me home."

After the bodyguard nodded, the car started.

Typically, experiencing a major incident like kidnapping tends to result in trauma. Although one might avoid similar actions, Lee Seonghyun hired bodyguards like that time.

Of course, it was a different company, but the fact that they were player bodyguards remained the same.

Concerns were raised by his acquaintances about his actions:

You were betrayed by a bodyguard, and you hired one again?

Aren't you afraid to hire a player?

However, every time, Lee Seonghyun explained:

Not all players are bad. It's just that the ones causing trouble right now are bad.

When he said that, those who knew Lee Seonghyun well showed surprised reactions.

Is this the Lee Seonghyun I know?

Of course, it was.

'He has changed a bit since the kidnapping.'

Not just a bit.

His perception had changed significantly compared to when he initially declared that all players were trash.

It was only natural, considering that the player he so despised had saved him.

'He called it the Black Scythe.'

He gave him enlightenment.

He helped him break free from prejudice and face reality.

'Not all players are the same. There are players like the Black Scythe, who stand for justice.'

It's not right to label everyone holding a weapon as a potential criminal.

It depends on how they wield it; good and evil will be determined accordingly.

'I've been trapped in too narrow-minded thinking for too long.'

In the anger of losing his son, he had only looked at players through a biased lens.

'Now, I need to change. I have to face reality and make the world right.'

The first step for that was the Grand Player Act.

Fortunately, the bill had been passed, and a division to deal with players would be established soon.

It might take some time until then.

'I've done everything I can. The problem will be resolved with time.'

Lee Seonghyun thought of the Black Scythe.

He fulfilled his request to proceed with the bill as it is.

Could this help alleviate the burden in his heart?

Lee Seonghyun nodded to himself.
ChatGPT

How can one repay the kindness of saving a life?

Perhaps even a lifetime of gratitude would not be enough.

"I parted ways without properly repaying. It's regrettable."

In the regretful feelings, Lee Seonghyun looked into the Black Scythe.

Unfamiliar to ordinary people, he was an immensely famous figure among players.

"He's consistently ranked first and the only skilled player who reached level 80..."

He heard that he also achieved the first place in the 8th round.

That meant he was still alive.

"If only I could meet him again..."

To the police and reporter's questions about the appearance of the Black Scythe, Lee Seonghyun falsely stated that he only heard the voice.

Despite knowing the appearance, he didn't reveal it to the public.

It seemed like the right thing to do for the Black Scythe.

"We have arrived, Representative."

As Lee Seonghyun got out of the car with his bodyguard, he was taken aback when he reached the entrance of his house.

"That person...!"

A tall man with tanned skin.

The Black Scythe, who saved him, was waiting at the entrance of his house.

At Lee Seonghyun's surprised reaction, the bodyguard's eyes became alert.

"Do you know him?"

"Oh, yes. He's an acquaintance of mine. Don't worry; go home."

"Is it really okay?"

"Yes. It's fine."

After reassuring the bodyguard and dismissing him, the man with tanned skin spoke.

"I apologize, Representative. I came suddenly, and it must have surprised you."

"Oh, well, not too much, just a little surprised."

Although it seemed like he was very surprised, Ryu Min didn't make a fuss.

"I have something to discuss quietly; can we talk inside?"

"Sure. Come in."

Using a door lock card, Lee Seonghyun opened the door and invited Ryu Min inside.

It was a house that could be seen in any ordinary, typical home, far from being the residence of a parliamentarian, but Ryu Min knew.

It was a house containing the precious memories of a man who lost his family.

"Please, have a seat here."

Ryu Min sat on the sofa, and Lee Seonghyun took a seat facing him.

"I never expected to see the savior of my life again like this. After saying we won't see each other again, here we are."

"I have something to ask of you, Representative."

"Ask?"

Lee Seonghyun, who opened his surprised eyes, smiled and spoke.

"It seems an opportunity has come to repay the savior of my life. Whatever your request, go ahead and tell me."

"I'll be straightforward. The police are planning to create a Grand Player Division, right?"

"That's correct."

"Please recommend me as the leader of that division."

"What?"

Lee Seonghyun was so surprised that his eyes nearly popped out.

'Recommend me as the leader?'

He thought it was a simple request for money, but it turned out to be an unexpected request.

Therefore, he was curious.

"What's the reason?"

The reason for wanting to become the leader of the division.

"Are you lusting for power?"

Lee Seonghyun's unfiltered question.

It was a kind of test.

'If he has ulterior motives, he'll show signs of confusion here.'

But the man known as the Black Scythe in front of him didn't even flinch.

That meant there was a completely different reason firmly rooted.

'Is he moving not out of personal greed but out of conviction?'

With such thoughts, Ryu Min opened his mouth.

"Power. Well, it's not a bad thing."

"Huh?"

Though Lee Seonghyun was confused by the unexpected answer, Ryu Min's words were not finished yet.

"But more than that, you could say I want the position for my personal desires."

"If it's personal desires?"

Taking a momentary pause, Ryu Min set the mood.

"Isn't it similar to why Representative Lee Seonghyun proposed the bill?"

"...."

"I, too, hate criminal players like you, Representative. I won't state the reason. It will only make the atmosphere gloomy for no reason."

As he lowered his gaze as if there was a sad story, Lee Seonghyun realized.

The reason why the Black Scythe willingly saved him.

'I don't know what happened, but he hates criminal players like me. So even if I offered a case, he wouldn't accept it. He must have already been satisfied with dealing with the criminals!'

Only now did he roughly understand the actions of the Black Scythe.

"Can you listen?"
ChatGPT

"Hmm... I can recommend you, but don't get your hopes up. The authority to select unit members, as we're pulling police players, lies with the Police Commissioner..."

"Are you implying there might be difficulties or something?"

"That's right. Still, I'll try to appeal as much as I can. You have a reputation among players, having a record of saving me, and achieving top rankings. You have the qualifications to become the unit leader. But there's no guarantee it will work. If the Police Commissioner insists on creating the unit with only police officers and ignores the skills, there's nothing I can do..."

"That's enough. Since you officially recommended me, and if the Police Commissioner accepts the recommendation and appoints me as the unit leader, it's satisfactory for me."

"Well, the Police Commissioner might back out of it?"

"If that happens, there's nothing I can do. Still, I'll definitely appreciate the recommendation."

"Okay, I'll do my best."

Ryu Min stood up as if to signal that his business was done.

"Leaving already? How about a drink or..."

"No, thank you. It's not right to stay too long in someone else's house. I'll see you again. Oh."

As Ryu Min was about to turn his head, he seemed to recall something and turned his body again.

"Tell me one thing."

"What is it?"

"Is the Police Commissioner a man or a woman?"

The highest rank in the police hierarchy, Chief Superintendent.

In South Korea, there are only two Chief Superintendents: the Police Commissioner and the Coast Guard Commissioner.

One of them, Police Commissioner Lee Cheong-ryong, sighed while throwing documents on the desk.

"Ugh, those damn congressmen. Stirring up trouble with useless bills. Ugh."

What he threw was the bill proposed by Lee Seonghyun to establish the Grand Player Division.

This bill, which proposes recruiting players under the age of 29 from the police force to create the division, has received approval from the President and the Police Commissioner.

But it was approved mainly to gauge public opinion.

Lee Cheong-ryong's true thoughts were filled with negative opinions.

"A bill for summary execution in 21st-century South Korea. Is this even reasonable?"

The bill states that in emergency situations where the life or death of civilians is at stake, summary execution is allowed only for players.
ChatGPT

So, the idea that killing criminal players doesn't incur guilt, especially in a country that abolished the death penalty, is an absurd bill.

"Did you come up with such a law knowing it's rubbish? Killing someone without regard for judicial procedures, isn't that murder? Tsk!"

The absurdity didn't end there.

"Forming a Grand Player Division by gathering police players under the age of 29? Most under 29 are just patrol officers. Are you going to catch player criminals, who even veteran detectives struggle with, with these inexperienced rookies?"

Even if they don't know, it's bound to draw ridicule from ordinary senior detectives.

Complaints may arise from juniors who got promoted.

"In my opinion, this is a complete farce. It's nothing but a waste of time."

Moreover, who would be selected as the leader of such a unit?

Most likely, a complete rookie with no experience catching a single criminal.

"Sigh."

As he was sighing, at that moment.

"Please choose me."

Lee Cheong-ryong was startled by the voice that came from thin air.

"Hey, X-pal! What the heck?!"

When he turned his head, a person appeared in the space where there was only a wall.

The man with a gruff complexion was looking at him.

"Pl-player!"

Such an absurd ability could only belong to a player.

Lee Cheong-ryong raised the handgun he had for security reasons.

He tried to shoot, but the player swiftly approached and, due to the struggle, the gun was snatched away, stopping him from carrying out the act.

"This is too much. Sneaking into the Police Commissioner's office isn't a crime punishable by death, you know?"

"W-where is this monster...!"

"Monster? You're being too harsh on a law-abiding citizen."

"What the heck are you! What's your motive?"

"Screaming like that won't help, even if you're trying to ask for help. Everything outside has already been taken care of."

"What?"

Thunk—

As the door to the Police Commissioner's office opened, a woman entered.

"Yamti, have the employees been dealt with?"

"Yes. I've handled everything that happened here as if it never occurred."

"W-what are you trying to do? You can't possibly be thinking of torture...!"

"Come on, Commissioner. Do you think we'd engage in such inhumane acts?"

"W-well then, what..."

"Just follow a few orders. Yamti."

As Yamti stepped forward, a pink hue flickered in the Police Commissioner's pupils.
ChatGPT

The moment their eyes met, the situation was over.

Being captivated happened in the blink of an eye.

"Yamti, convey my words exactly to the Police Commissioner."

"Yes, master."

"Do your best to establish the Grand Player Division as quickly as possible and make it operational. And..."

With a smirk, Ryu Min continued, "Appoint Black Scythe as the commander of the Grand Player Division."
