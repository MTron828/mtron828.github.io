Title: Episode 166 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max-Level Player

Cult of Reapers

Jeffrey couldn't meet the gaze of the two people properly.

His throat turned crimson with embarrassment.

"Did you really threaten the Prophet?"

"W-well...."

"No need for a long answer. Did you or did you not?"

Jeffrey, whose lips were trembling, nodded deeply.

"Yes, I did. I'm sorry."

"Sigh."

"Ha."

Simultaneously, both of them let out a sigh.

"There, there's a reason. I can explain everything...."

"Didn't you just listen to the recording? You did it for my daughter."

"Yes, I did. It was to provide information to Kristin...."

"Even so, threatening the Prophet crossed the line."

Nathan, who thought he would advocate for Jeffrey, said firmly.

"Didn't I say it before? The Prophet is like a golden goose. If you try to force it, you might miss the gold."

"...."

"To threaten the Prophet to extract information? Did you deliberately pick a fight with the Prophet to sever your ties and get more information?"

"I-it was a matter of life and death for Kristin. It would be better to prevent a crime in advance...."

"But the Prophet already told Kristin that there is a risk of changing the future, and for that reason, they cannot reveal more information. You heard that, so you took action."

"...."

"Yet, you still decided to threaten. It was a reckless and ignorant move."

"I have no excuse. I'm sorry, really...."

"You should apologize to the Prophet, not me."

Kristin interjected with a chilly voice.

"What were you thinking, Mr. Jeffrey?"

"I-I apologize...."

"Father, you didn't do anything right."

"Huh? Me? Are you talking about me?"

Nathan was suddenly taken aback.

"You caused this trouble by trailing Mr. Jeffrey."

"It was to protect you...."

"Do you think I'm foolish? Rather, you stuck to me to keep an eye on me, right? Korea isn't a danger zone like Nigeria. What could possibly be dangerous here? And I clearly said, didn't I? That I would go alone. But in the end, since you didn't listen, it's also your fault, Father. Was I wrong?"

"...."

There was no incorrect statement, so Nathan, like Jeffrey, could only remain silent.

"Sigh... Originally, thanks to the predictions from the Prophet, we could have been a bit more prepared, but now it's all ruined... How am I supposed to face the Prophet now? Even if we safely pass Round 11, what about the next round? How do we strategize if we can't hear the prophecy?"

"Don't worry too much. I'll personally apologize to the Prophet."

"Rather than you, Mr. Jeffrey should apologize first!"

"Yes, yes. I-I'll apologize. Kristin. So, please calm down. I'm sorry. Truly sorry, and it's all my fault..."

"If you're going to apologize, do it quickly. And don't talk to me anymore. I don't want to hear it."

Angrily, Kristin left, indicating she didn't want any further conversation.

Behind Jeffrey, who was staring blankly at her leaving, a clicking sound of a tongue was heard.

"Tsk tsk, why mess with the Prophet? Just why."

"I didn't expect things to turn out like this. I'm sorry."

"I don't need an apology from you, following Kristin's words."

"I'll call the Prophet right now."

"Will it be resolved with just a call? Is that it?"

Nathan, who was sitting, stood up.

"You should go there yourself and apologize. Maybe buy a gift to mend hearts."

"D-Directly?"

Ignoring the surprised Jeffrey, Nathan opened the door.

"What are you doing? Pack your things quickly. We're going to Korea together."

Back at home, Ryumin thought of Jeffrey.

"I wonder how he's doing now. Judging by Kristin's reaction, he seemed determined not to let it slide."

When threatened by that guy with a dagger, Ryumin had secretly turned on the recording on the two phones in his pocket. He threw one as a decoy, ensuring the other wouldn't be discovered.

Afterward, he asked Makyoungrok, obtained Kristin and Nathan's phone numbers, and sent them the recording.

"It's going to sting a bit. Getting the hatred of someone you secretly admire."

Jeffrey would have surely realized it this time—what happens when you mess with a Prophet.

"Tsk tsk." Ryumin clicked his tongue and rubbed his neck with his hand.

The player who held the top rank might be experiencing this for the first time.

"An assassin, is that it? Doesn't seem that strong. To think he said he would protect Kristin with this level of strength, tsk."

It didn't hurt much. Just felt a bit unpleasant.

Still, he was satisfied to have an opportunity to demonstrate the authority of the Prophet.

"There's nothing as foolish as being blinded by love."

At that moment, Ryumin received a text on his phone.

Someone else here was blinded by love.

[Minjuri: Min, do you believe in any religion?]

"Why suddenly ask about religion? No way?"

Pretending not to know, Ryumin continued his response.

[Ryumin: I don't have any. Why?] [Minjuri: Good. Then, let's go somewhere together. Can you spare some time?] [Ryumin: Where?] [Minjuri: If I were going to tell you, I would've said it earlier! ㅋㅋ It's a secret!] [Ryumin: Got it. Let's meet in front of the convenience store in 10 minutes.] [Minjuri: ㅇㅋㄷㅋ]

"Feels a bit sketchy...."

Although she didn't mention the religion, he had a feeling he knew what it was.

"It's a bit sketchy to go there...."

Still, it didn't seem like a bad idea to visit at least once. He was curious about what kind of religion it was.

As he prepared to go out wearing casual clothes, his younger brother approached and asked, "Hyung, where are you going?"

"To meet a friend."

"Can I go meet friends too?"

Upon hearing the word 'friend,' Ryumin's eyes switched to alert mode.

"Who's this friend?"

"It's a friend I met in an online game, living in Seoul. We had plans to meet and play at the PC room together when we had time, but I kept making excuses and turning him down."

"Even though you said 'friend,' it turns out to be a gaming friend."

Lately, while staying at home, his brother seemed to have made a gaming friend.

Although they played games in the previous encounter, Ryumin didn't know he had made a friend.

Seeing Ryumin contemplating, Ryuwon added, "He wants to play at the PC room together. What do you think? Is it okay? The number of bad players has decreased, and things have stabilized. He says it's fine for you to go out."

Thinking it over, Ryumin nodded his head, convinced that there was nothing wrong with it.

"Alright. I'll allow it."

"Really? Oh yeah!"

"But don't stay out too late."

"Got it."

"When I text you, read it right away."

"I got it. Hehe! I should contact her and meet up today. Hyung! Thanks! Have a good time!"

His younger brother, excited and eager to make plans, hurriedly went to set up the meeting.

'Is it really that good?'

Ryumin, who had been smiling at his brother's enthusiasm, suddenly stiffened his expression.

'Hmm. Just in case.'

Tap-tap-tap-tap-

Ryumin's fingers quickly typed out a text message.

Arriving at the meeting place, Ryumin felt a bit perplexed.

Minjuri, sitting in the front passenger seat without warning and gesturing to start driving.

"Where are we going?"

"Yangpyeong."

"Why there?"

"There's a religion there. It's scary to go alone... Will you come with me?"

She looked at him with puppy-like eyes, and he couldn't refuse.

"What kind of religion is it?"

"Just go for now. I'll explain when we get there."

Though she pretended not to go if he refused, he could already read her true feelings.

'As expected, she's planning to visit the Cult of Reapers.'

Hotaeseok's created Cult of Reapers was located in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province. Though he hadn't been there, he remembered seeing promotional posts on the Fesba Cafe.

'Since last time, Minjuri showed interest in the Otherworld, so I subtly told her the address.'

There wasn't anything particular to do, and it was just an hour's drive from Seoul, so they had enough time.

'It's not a bad idea to spend some time since there are only a few months left with Minjuri like this.'

Ryumin, deciding to make it a casual drive, grabbed the steering wheel without complaints.

Minjuri was thankful for that.

"Thanks for following me. I can't do much for you... but buff up and stay strong!"

"Haha... I feel empowered."

It didn't really contribute to the driving, but it certainly had a soothing effect on the mind.

"We've arrived."

At the end of an hour-long drive, they reached a small village.

Normally, you wouldn't imagine finding religious facilities in such a place, but it was there.

It looked like a shabby house, similar to a neighborhood elderly care facility.

"Min. Is this it?"

"Yeah. According to the address you gave me, this should be the right house."
ChatGPT

Approaching closer, the first thing that caught their eyes was a wooden sign with Chinese characters engraved.

"Cult of Reapers? Was this where you wanted to go?" Ryumin asked.

Minjuri nodded shyly in response to Ryumin's question.

"Um... So, what is the Cult of Reapers?"

"I know. It's a group that worships the Black Scythe."

"Oh? You knew about the Cult of Reapers?"

"I saw promotional posts about it on the café where players hang out."

Ryumin, who spoke in a serious tone, asked, "So, did you come here to join?"

"No. I just came to see what kind of place it is."

'Lies. She was planning to join.'

Ryumin was also curious. While he knew of the existence of the Cult of Reapers, he had never visited their headquarters. Their presence had disappeared at some point.

"Hotaeseok became famous as the cult leader until Round 15."

Round 15 of the Abyss boasted an extreme difficulty level that even wiped out the leader of the Cult of Reapers.

"It might have a different outcome this time."

Although it gave off a cultish vibe, he didn't mind being revered. Moreover, the Cult of Reapers started expanding its influence by annexing other countries starting from Round 12, gradually gathering many followers.

'How about picking and training some talented individuals among them?'

It could be helpful for Ryumin in the future.

"Where and how did they organize this? Shall we go in and take a look?"

Entering the Cult of Reapers with a bit of anticipation, the interior was disappointing.

There were only mats and straw mats on the floor, creating a gloomy atmosphere. It looked worse than a typical elderly care facility or a run-down house.

Moreover, there weren't many people gathered there.

"Is this all of it?"

Except for Ryumin and Minjuri, there were about five people, and all of them had unfamiliar faces.

Except for two people.

"Welcome, believers."

As Hotaeseok pushed through, a man approached with a smiling face and greeted them.

'Eom Junseok?'

Whether it was Hotaeseok or Eom Junseok, their faces in the Otherworld and the real world matched.

"Welcome to our Cult of Reapers. Did you come to join us, perhaps?"

"Oh, no. Just came to look around..."

"Looking at you, you seem like a player. Familiar face, aren't you?"

Eom Junseok grinned as he looked at Minjuri.
ChatGPT

"Have we met somewhere before?"

"We were introduced in the Otherworld."

"Oh? Wait, are you Buffer-nim? Is your nickname Minjujue?"

"Yes, that's correct."

Upon learning that Minjuri was a Buffer, Eom Junseok couldn't hide his surprise.

"Hotaeseok, I mean, Master? Master!"

"What's going on, Eom Chugugyeong?"

Despite the laughter among themselves, Ryumin kept quiet. At the moment, the influence might be minimal, but in a few months, the power would grow significantly. The Cult of Reapers was definitely not to be ignored.

"Here is the partner of the Black Scythe, Minjujue-nim!"

"Oh, really?"

Hotaeseok, with a reflective expression, approached Minjuri.

'Partner?'

Amidst this, the term "partner" bothered Ryumin, but it wasn't entirely incorrect.

"Are you really Minjujue?"

"Yes. And you are... the beggar?"

"Haha, that's right. I am Nopaeein-Nogaei. You seemed mature in the Otherworld, but in reality, you're a young college student, right? Early twenties?"

"Yes, I'm 20 years old."

Hotaeseok's gaze naturally shifted towards Ryumin.

"Then this person isn't the Black Scythe... Who are you?"

"He's my friend."

"What's his nickname...?"

After some hesitation, Ryumin decided to reveal his nickname, which he hadn't shared with Minjuri.
