Title: Episode 119 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max Level Player

The Time Reverser's Last Stand

The general group quest involves escorting to the destination.

The traitor group quest involves obstructing the escort to the destination.

Since the two quests were in complete opposition, only one group could survive.

"It's a fight between whether 1,201 people die or I die."

That's the usual thought.

However, Ryu Min knew how to ensure the survival of both groups.

"It's not a difficult method. It's simple when you exploit the system's loopholes."

Therefore, Ryu Min wasn't particularly worried.

Having already conquered the quest multiple times using the same method.

"I can't let all 1,201 people die just for me to survive."

Among the 1,201 people, Jo Yong-ho is especially important.

An Sang-cheol, it doesn't matter if he dies, but Jo Yong-ho must become his strength as the future mercenary king.

"He's a talent too valuable to kill."

So, he plans to use a method where everyone survives.

"There's no need to worry about annihilation. The problem is whether we can obtain the Rune of Future Time."

Obtaining the rune is a planned event if everything goes according to plan.

However, there's always the existence of variables.

"In the unlikely event that the Archbishop doesn't acknowledge me..."

If he can't create an overwhelmingly favorable situation to the point where the Archbishop's eyes pop out, gaining favor becomes impossible.

If he can't gain favor, then a one-on-one meeting with him becomes impossible, and then the reward slips away.

"For now, I'll have to wait until the boss appears."

Soon, the top part moved, and the actual escort quest began.

A large group of 1,202 players guarded the carriage.

Ryu Min took a seat beside the carriage where the Archbishop was riding.

"It's better if it catches attention now, if possible."

After all, wouldn't it be better to fight next to the Archbishop?

Thinking like that as he walked, a monster appeared.

Countless undead creatures filled the sky.

"What, monsters flying in the sky?"

"Damn it. How do we catch that?"

Players were bewildered from the start, but soon they could see the battle with the black scythe.
ChatGPT

"It's not like they can't be caught just because they have wings."

"When they come down like the Black Scythe, just kill them!"

"Kill them! You bird bastards!"

They looked like birds, but players couldn't regain their composure to the same extent.

The attacks of the diving undead creatures were enough to make their minds dizzy.

"These guys are tougher than I thought!"

"They don't die in one hit!"

Since they didn't die in one hit, they would attack and quickly flee.

"With wings, we can't even chase them. This is driving me crazy!"

The battle lasted longer than expected, but it wasn't one-sided.

Swoosh!

With a single blow, a head rolled, and with consecutive attacks, the undead creature beside it was split in half.

'Night of Death.'

Ryu Min, who darkened the space, moved with even faster attack speed, beheading the undead creatures.

If he saw someone trying to escape, he didn't hesitate to use his skill.

'Moonlight Isle.'

With a dazzling flash, three undead creatures were fragmented.

Overwhelming performance to the point where it's hard to believe there's a stat debuff.

Players marveled at the Black Scythe, who was truly putting on a one-man show.

"Wow, look at the Black Scythe."

"Crazy, he's so damn strong."

"Why does he just have to swing once to finish them off?"

Even some spectators were losing their minds.

Watching Ryu Min's performance wasn't only limited to players.

When he turned his head slightly, the Archbishop was looking in their direction through the carriage window.

He couldn't read his thoughts, but the unwavering gaze indicated interest.

'Even if he doesn't know, I must have made a strong first impression.'

After slaughtering all the undead creatures and a short break, the second wave began immediately.

"What are these things again?"

"They look like trolls from fantasy, don't they?"

'Right, those trolls.'

Ryu Min agreed as he raised his scythe.

Trolls aren't particularly large monsters, with a height of 2.5m, but they have fast regeneration.

'But they only regenerate from light wounds. If you cut them in one blow, there's no problem.'

Of course, for other players, cutting through a troll's thick skin in one blow was too challenging.

But for Ryu Min, it was like cutting soft tofu.

Swoosh, swoosh!
ChatGPT

Seeing Ryu Min tearing apart even trolls, players were left speechless.

"This is insane, just insane."

"How can the damage be so intense?"

"He's not the top rank for nothing."

After somehow dealing with the trolls and taking a few steps, now a Minotaur appeared.

"A Minotaur? Is this for real?"

"How are we supposed to defeat that monster?"

"There's no break at all, seriously."

During the 6th round, players had experienced how powerful the Minotaur was.

The reason they were scared before even starting the fight was because of this.

Seeing that, Ryu Min shook his head in disbelief.

"There's no need to be afraid. Isn't it something to welcome? At least, it's a monster I've encountered before."

Moreover, the level difference between then and now was more than 10.

Although it would be challenging, with a few people teaming up, it was manageable.

It didn't take long for players to realize this fact.

"Nice! We got it!"

"It seems easier than before?"

"Worth the effort, isn't it?"

Seeing confident players, Ryu Min also smiled triumphantly.

"Crunchumeeeeer!"

He slaughtered dozens, but no items or rewards came out.

In the 6th round, it was a boss, so the item drop rate was high, but here, they were treated as regular monsters.

After a fierce hunting session lasting four hours, the 25th wave approached.

"It's finally time for it to appear."

As Ryu Min prepared himself mentally, the awaited boss monster appeared.

Thud, thud, thud.

"What's this?"

"What's that sound?"

"The ground is vibrating...?"

The reason for the vibration was none other than:

"Grooooow!"

A monster, over 6 meters tall, the strongest ground-based monster, an Ogre.

It was the appearance of the boss monster for the 8th round.

Against expectations, the agile creature rushed towards them, swinging its hands like catching flies.

Swoosh!

A player who failed to respond in time crumpled and died.

"Attack! Kill it!"

Several players surrounded the Ogre.

No, the Ogre surrounded them.

It was better for the Ogre to encircle them, rather than players trying to take it down one by one.

Thunk, thunk, thunk!

As the Ogre swung a club the thickness of a person, players couldn't evade and were thrown away.

Thud! Swoosh! Squelch!
ChatGPT

Kicking with his feet, smashing with a club, and blowing away heads with his palm.

Every time the Ogre attacked, players helplessly perished.

"What the hell is that!"

"The Ogre is that powerful?"

"Isn't this a complete setup error?"

Already, there were 30 corpses from a single Ogre, and it kept increasing.

Even with a thousand players rushing in, it's uncertain if they can stop it, and the damage would be unpredictable.

Then, darkness engulfed the surroundings.

"Who's there?"

"The Black Scythe?"

In the eyes of the confused players, Ryu Min, with Death's Side extended, appeared.

Calm as if he had been waiting for this situation.

It's time to try out the newly learned skill.

'Enemy Moon.'

The moment Ryu Min felt his eyes turn red, a flash of light occurred.

Abruptly, in the sudden darkness, the confused Ogre found a streak of light.

Swoosh!

"Growwwwwl!"

As the club was cut in half, a long gash appeared on the Ogre's chest.

The second light continued to cut even deeper across the chest.

"Kwaaaaaaaah!"

In pain, the Ogre raised its hand, but the third light sliced through its forearm.

The fourth flash severed the neck, and the fifth light cut through the collapsing body once more.

Screams - Thud!

"...."

"...."

Even though it happened in just 10 seconds, players clearly observed it.

The Black Scythe was an opponent they couldn't defeat even if thousands of players rushed at him.

As the curtain of darkness lifted, Ryu Min turned his head.

The Archbishop was half-openly looking in their direction.

'According to the plan.'

Confirming that the Archbishop was watching, Ryu Min executed the Ogre.

Even if he didn't know, he must have left a definite impression.

'Now that we've had a show, shouldn't we share our thoughts at least?'

While subtly waiting for him to acknowledge the call, the gazes around him were intense.

-He used that ridiculous skill five times in a row?

-Insane. What kind of profession is he?

-The Black Scythe is truly legendary.

Reading their thoughts, it seemed like he had captured the attention of other players as well.

Among them, An Sang-cheol was also visible.

-Am I crazy? To think about catching such a monster...

'Did you just realize that now?'
ChatGPT

An Sang-cheol, who belatedly realized his own situation through this incident, glanced at the message that appeared on one side.

[You have defeated the Ogre!] [Experience points tripled buff is applied.] [Experience points increased by 1.5 times due to title effect.] [Experience points +16.37%] [Gold +12,000] [Additional gold +6,000] [Obtained 'Ogre's Gauntlet.'] [Obtained 'Ogre's Heart.']

As it was designated as a boss, items that wouldn't normally appear were dropped.

['Ogre's Gauntlet']

Classification: Glove

Grade: Unique

Defense: 180

Effect: Strength +30, additional Strength +30 against ground monsters

Durability: 3,000/3,000

Usage Restriction: Expert grade or higher

Description: Ogre's Gauntlet, known as the predator of ground monsters. Strength increases brutally.

Ryu Min smiled upon seeing the gauntlet.

'A unique item came out.'

Though unique, it was a crazy item that demonstrated legendary-level options against ground monsters.

It was better than the shadow gloves he was currently wearing, so he immediately equipped it.

He also embedded the highest-grade magic stone he had into the Ogre's Gauntlet.

['Ogre's Heart']

Classification: Item

Description: A dark red, solid stone. Although it looks like a real heart, you can rest assured it is not.

'Ogre's Heart' is a legendary-grade material item, Ryu Min needed.

He stored it in his inventory.

'I should combine some legendaries next time.'

While thinking about it, the Captain of the escort approached.

"Hello, Warrior from the other realm. I enjoyed watching the battle a while ago. Killing that terrifying Ogre in an instant. That's why people hire warriors from other realms as escorts. Haha!"

'Surely he didn't come here to say something useless like that?'

Although the words nearly made him snap, Ryu Min held back and asked, "What's the matter?"

"Oh, get a hold of yourself. I just wanted to let you know that the Archbishop wishes to meet you."

"Me?"

"Yes. It seems the Archbishop was quite impressed by your battle."

"Got it. Where should I go?"

"This way."
ChatGPT

Following the escort captain, Ryu Min stood in front of the carriage where the Archbishop was seated.

"Please come inside."

When the door opened, the Archbishop gestured for him to enter.

"Have a seat."

As Ryu Min sat across from him, the carriage door closed.

During a brief silence, the Archbishop spoke about the purpose.

"I'll be straightforward. I called you here to make a proposal."

"A proposal?"

"Being in a high position, I face various threats. I have been seeking a skilled guardian to stay by my side."

The Archbishop spoke with an arrogant tone.

"What do you think? Will you become my guardian? This opportunity is truly unique."

"Indeed, such opportunities are not common."

In this world, the Archbishop was a figure equivalent to the Pope. Even within the Holy Empire, the Archbishop's influence was considerable.

"It's not often that one gets a chance to refuse a proposal from such a person."

Ryu Min quickly responded, "I will decline."

"Well, I naturally expected that... What did you say?"

Surprise flickered in the Archbishop's eyes, who had naturally anticipated acceptance.

"I appreciate the offer, but I don't have confidence in protecting someone
