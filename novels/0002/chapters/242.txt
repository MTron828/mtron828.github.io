Title: Episode 242 of the 100th Rebirth for a Max Level Player

Misunderstanding

"Please give me a pack of Red."

Beep-

"That will be 4,500 won, sir. Thank you. Have a good day!"

As the customer who only bought a pack of cigarettes left, Min Dohoon energetically bid farewell.

The departing customer seemed a bit puzzled.

The reason he was so lively was none other than the realization of the preciousness of life.

Ding-

Just then, a person who could be considered a reason for life opened the convenience store door and walked in.

With a somewhat discontented face.

"Daughter! Did you come to help Dad again today?"

"Dad! Can't you quit working at the convenience store now? It's dangerous in this day and age... "

"Again with that? Nagging just like your mother."

"Stop ignoring me!"

"If our daughter takes care of us, isn't that enough? There's even a famous Black Scythe around if things get tough."

"How can Black Scythe take care of us? You've been so busy lately."

"Well, that famous figure wouldn't bother visiting our convenience store."

Min Juri wanted to boast about her connections with Black Scythe for a moment, but she held back.

There was no deep relationship with Black Scythe, and it seemed like taking advantage of his position for no reason.

"Anyway, listen to me! How long are you going to keep doing this? Other nearby stores have already turned into unmanned convenience stores. We should change for safety reasons too. Or sell the store and take a break at home. With the money I've earned, it's enough for retirement planning."

What used to be a constant worry due to lack of money was now a thing of the past.

With the money Min Juri earned by selling items as a player, it was around 200 million won.

She had already paid off all household debts and had enough for living expenses.

Moreover, she even had a 300 million won diamond she received from Ryu Min, though she hadn't sold it yet.

In any case, it was a situation where she had enough to live on without working at the convenience store.

However, her father, Min Dohoon, did not listen.

"Retirement planning. Are you treating your dad like a grandpa? I'm not even in my early 50s yet. You should work when you can."

"Sigh... stubbornness."
ChatGPT

Min Juri, knowing well the extent of her father's stubbornness, couldn't nag anymore.

She simply sighed, expressing her disappointment.

The somewhat fortunate thing was that the world had improved a lot lately.

Most domestic players belonged to the virtuous Sinsin Church, and thanks to CPF and the Black Scythe, the crime rate had drastically decreased.

Before she knew it, Min Juri, now wearing a convenience store uniform, gently pushed her father away from the entrance.

"Dad, go inside and rest. I'll take over now."

"No, I haven't been here for long. I'll stay a bit longer."

"Still, take a break. You're getting older, and your body must be tired."

"Now she's openly treating me like an old man? I'm still perfectly fine. If needed, I can just cast that Blessing thing. It gives a surge of vitality to the whole body."

"Blessing isn't an all-powerful thing. It just makes you feel that way."

"Anyway, I'm fine, so you take a break. It hasn't been that long since you woke up from game addiction."

"Don't worry about me, worry about yourself, Dad."

"How can I not worry about my daughter in this situation?"

Perhaps the position of a daughter who had to play a life-or-death game came to mind?

Min Dohoon's face turned gloomy.

"Isn't it tough these days?"

"Heh, what's tough? I've survived for 14 months like this."

"But there are still 6 rounds left. What will happen in the future..."

As her own heart felt like it was burning like this, how could she understand her daughter's feelings?

A long sigh escaped from Min Dohoon's lips.

"Sorry. I shouldn't be talking about depressing things in front of my daughter."

"No, I'm okay. I have reliable comrades, and I've gained enough experience. There's nothing to worry about."

"Every 1st of the month, do you know what your dad does? I pray to God all night. I ask Him to bring our daughter back safely. Please take care of her."

"We should pray to those who can help... considering that God made it this way."

"You never know. God might consider my earnest prayer and show mercy only to our daughter."

Knowing her father's feelings, Min Juri chose not to speak any further.
ChatGPT

"So, Dad treasures every moment and is grateful for it. I just want to spend more time with our daughter in the remaining time."

"What nonsense are you talking about? Do you think I'm on death row or something? Who's dying here?"

Wiping away the tears that were welling up, Min Juri spoke energetically.

"I'll survive until Round 20. I'll definitely live to fulfill my wish."

"What wish are you making?"

"That's a secret."

Min Juri, smiling mischievously, put on her gloves and went outside.

"Is it time for the deliveries? I'll go."

"Juri, what's tough for Dad is..."

"Don't worry. Have you forgotten? Dad's daughter is a player who can break walls."

Min Juri, who spoke with a bright expression, immediately looked gloomy as she stepped outside, as if saying, 'When did that happen?'

'I wonder if I can really hold out until Round 20?'

Somehow, she managed to reach Round 14.

It could be said that it was due to luck.

Surviving this long as a buffer, not even having an aggressive job.

'This is all thanks to my comrades.'

It was thanks to trustworthy comrades who believed in and relied on each other that she could endure this far.

Among them, the ones who supported her the most were Ryu Min and the Black Scythe.

'If it weren't for those two, I might have turned into ashes by now...'

Suddenly, she felt the desire to be a source of strength for them as well.

Thinking carefully about how she could help, one idea came to mind.

'Come to think of it, Black Scythe mentioned that he chooses the next round's information as a reward through a special reward selection box...'

Is there a need to give up personal rewards and choose information?

Especially when Ryu Min, the prophet, is there.

'If Min shares the next round's information, Black Scythe could choose a different reward.'

By sharing information, they could both choose a more advantageous reward as Black Scythe.

'But why aren't they doing that? Is it because they can't agree on opinions? Or maybe surprisingly, their relationship isn't good...'

Come to think of it, it might be possible.

Ryu Min was told to join the Sinsin Church, but she kept avoiding it.

As a result, she still hadn't joined.

And Black Scythe, even though he could hear the information through Ryu Min's prophecy, was choosing it as the next round's reward...
ChatGPT

'Looking at it this way, it really seems like they have a bad relationship.'

It would be better if they worked together, so why is it like this?

Did something happen between them?

'Maybe I can help.'

What if I mediate between them and resolve their strained relationship?

With that thought in mind, Min Juri sent a text to Ryu Min.

[Min, I have something to discuss. Do you have time today?]

After finishing work and returning home, Min Juri absentmindedly stared at her phone.

"..."

She waited for a reply for the entire afternoon, but there was no response.

Even calling didn't get an answer.

'What could be going on?'

Worrying, she put on her coat.

She had visited Ryu Min's house before.

Recalling that memory, she put on her shoes.

"Dad, I'm going to see a friend!"

"Not a guy, right?"

"So what if it's a guy!? I, it's just a friend!"

"It's a guy. Got it. Go on."

He seemed to smile subtly as if misunderstanding, but for some reason, she didn't want to explain.

He was a guy she had liked for a long time.

"Well, I'll be back soon. Don't eat dinner without me."

Trying to hide her embarrassment, Min Juri went outside and took a taxi to Ryu Min's apartment.

Galleria Forest, an apartment worth around 9 billion won.

It was in the 7 billion won range a year ago, but with the world becoming more dangerous, security became a priority, causing the price to skyrocket.

"Please drop me off here. Thank you."

Min Juri, getting off the taxi, walked to the front entrance of the apartment.

Her finger, about to press the call button, hesitated for a moment.

'What was the unit number?'

She knows the building but can't remember the unit number.

At that moment, the voice of salvation reached her ears.

"Minjuju's nim?"

"Huh? Actor Seo Arin."

When she turned around, Seo Arin was standing there in casual attire with a hat, holding a bag from GS24 in one hand.

"What are you doing here?"

"Well... I came to meet a friend, but I can't remember the unit number."

"If it's a friend... Is it the Prophet by any chance?"

"Huh? You knew?"

"I heard you two are friends."

With that, Seo Arin used her key card to open the door.
ChatGPT

"Perfect timing. I also had something to ask the Prophet. Let's go together."

"Thank you."

The two entered the building, greeted the security guard, and took the elevator.

Wooong-

Perhaps because the silence was becoming too noticeable, Min Juri laughed and broke the silence.

"I heard too. That Min moved to the upper floor..."

"Oh, yes. Strangely enough, the Prophet moved to the lower floor. At that time, my younger sibling and I even prepared some rice cakes... though I didn't get to taste them. They looked delicious."

"Oh, she lives with her younger sibling..."

In the past, when Min Juri had followed Ryu Min out of curiosity, she had seen her talking with her sibling. Since then, out of sensitivity, she hadn't directly asked about their family relationship.

"She has a 4-year-old sibling. You probably know that since you've been to her house a few times... Didn't you know?"

"I, I didn't know..."

Externally, since they hadn't officially met, she pretended not to know.

"It's actually better this way. It might be awkward, but I'll introduce you personally. I've been to the Prophet's house a few times, so I'm familiar with her sibling's face."

"A few times... you've been there?"

Min Juri couldn't help feeling a bit jealous at the thought of a female celebrity roaming around, especially at the house of the guy she liked.

"Why are you like this?"

"Oh, no reason."

Just then, the elevator stopped with a ding at the 43rd floor.

The two got off and headed to Ryu Min's apartment.

Pressing the doorbell and waiting, Ryu Won, with a familiar face, opened the door.

"Seo, Seo Arin actress?"

"I told you to call me Nuna."

"Oh, Nuna... Who's this next to you?"

"She's a friend of Ryu Min."

Min Juri stepped forward, smiling. "You're Min's sibling? Nice to meet you. I'm Min Juri, a schoolmate of Min's."

"Oh, hello."

"Is Min inside? I wanted to talk to her if she's in..."

"Hyung isn't at home right now."

"Not at home? Do you know where she went? She didn't answer her phone..."

"Well, that's..."

Ryu Won hesitated, unable to lie, and finally revealed the truth.

"She went to Japan to meet her girlfriend."

"Girlfriend?"

"Yeah, she often travels to Japan to see her Japanese girlfriend."
ChatGPT

"Oh, the Prophet, who seemed innocent, also had a girlfriend. Surprising, isn't it?"

Seo Arin chuckled at the new information, but only for a moment. She looked to the side and was startled.

Min Juri was staring blankly into space with a vacant expression, as if her soul had left her body.

"Why, what's wrong? Minjuju's nim?"

"Oh, no, it's nothing. She had a girlfriend... and she's Japanese..."

Muttering to herself, Min Juri abruptly turned away without saying a word.

"A-Are you leaving? Uh, I should go too, sister."

"Yes, sister. It was nice to meet you!"

Looking at the closed entrance door, Ryu Won tilted his head with a smirk.

'What did I do wrong?'
