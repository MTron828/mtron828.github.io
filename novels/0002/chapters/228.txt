Title: "Episode 228 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

Meeting with the President

The security guards at the Blue House could not ease their tension.

It was because they had heard the news that the famous Black Scythe was coming to meet the president.

"Senior. Shouldn't we mobilize the military for this, even if it's just a rumor?"

"The military? Are you serious?"

"Do you think we can stop the Black Scythe with what we have? You know how powerful the player is."

"Kid, don't be scared. What's the Black Scythe, a terrorist? They say he's here to submit something to the Blue House. Why worry about something unnecessary?"

"No, do you trust that person, Senior? What if he's coming to assassinate the president? We should prevent any potential situations beforehand."

"Hey, you have to scare someone who might be scared. This guy went to Nigeria and single-handedly eliminated IS. He holds a significant position as the CPF Unit Commander in Korea. Does someone like that look like a dangerous figure?"

"But still, aren't we waiting like this in case of any emergencies?"

"That's right. That's why we're conducting security checks in this meeting room, and dozens of presidential bodyguards are sticking around. It might be meaningless in front of the Black Scythe, but we're prepared just in case."

"Do you really think so?"

"Well, speaking frankly, how can ordinary people like us suppress the Black Scythe? Even if there are just a few dozen security guards, can they stop a player who is considered a formidable existence? Mobilizing the military would be impossible, even if we tried."

"Why does the president want to meet such a dangerous person?"

"If the president judged that he's not dangerous, then they are meeting. Honestly, what can't the Black Scythe do if he sets his mind to it? If he had political ambitions, this place would have turned into chaos long ago. Instead of going after IS or criminals like now."

"Hmm, now that you mention it, it makes sense."

"So stop worrying about unnecessary things and focus on your job. It's unlikely to happen, but be prepared to take a bullet if the Black Scythe attacks the president."

"Isn't it more like being prepared to take a scythe than a bullet?"

"Now you're making jokes... Hey, he's coming."

The security guards, seeing the Black Scythe and the president walking down the hallway, assumed a frozen posture.

Beside the two were not only the chief of staff but also the ministers of defense, foreign affairs, the prime minister, and the director of national security. In addition, nearly twenty bodyguards stuck closely like a cloud.

As the security guards of the meeting room opened the door, the president smiled and spoke, "Please come in, Mr. Black Scythe. This is a good place for a conversation."

"Yes."

The Black Scythe, dressed in casual clothing without any visible weapons, strangely wore a white mask.

'Is he really not dangerous? How can we trust someone whose face we can't even see...'

The security guard who was inwardly grumbling completely froze at the gaze from the eyes behind the mask that seemed to be watching him.

Just making eye contact gave him the feeling of being a rabbit standing in front of a tiger.

Unintentionally avoiding the gaze, the guard allowed Ryu Min to enter.

"Please have a seat here. Would you like some tea?"

"No, thank you. I plan to handle my business quickly and leave."

Ryu Min politely declined and looked at the president.

"President Yoon Sung-ho. A clean president who values the safety of the nation, with no corruption and a sense of justice. Not authoritative either. I can trust someone like him."

Above all, when reading his inner thoughts, he didn't seem hostile towards him. Didn't he personally call to commend him for his merit in dealing with IS last time?

'If he had been uncooperative with me, I might have used him somehow, but there's no need for that.'

Although they hadn't discussed the demands yet, he had a premonition that the conversation would go smoothly.

"Suddenly wanting to meet with me and calling me. Do you have any requests?"

"You have a keen sense. Yes, I do. I have two requests for the president."

"Two requests? Let's hear what you have to say first. Speak."

"As you know, I have a record of eliminating IS. I've also assisted in dealing with criminals as the CPF Unit Commander."

"Yes, yes. I wonder if there's anyone in the country who doesn't know about your great achievements."

"But I don't plan to stop here. I intend to aid other countries as well. There are probably countries that need help more than we think."

"Countries in need of help?"
ChatGPT

"This is about a country dominated by a player. Players who are immersed in wielding power often tend to seize control of the leadership first. It's just speculation, but I believe there are quite a few countries like that, knowingly or unknowingly."

It wasn't just speculation; it was happening in reality.

Lately, a player had taken control of a country, ruling like a king. However, due to the isolation of the citizens within their own borders, many were unaware of this transformation.

"If there truly are countries like that, it could be a significant problem."

"Yes. That's why I hope the president can take responsibility and use the information from the National Intelligence Service to find countries in need of assistance. That's my first request."

"And the second?"

"My second request is to provide a platform for broadcasting my intentions worldwide. Encourage countries in need to seek help from Korea. I will assure them that we will be ready to assist at any time."

"Hmm..."

It wasn't a difficult request. However, one thing troubled the president.

"Do you realize that such a statement, broadcasted globally, could potentially lead to a dangerous situation of national conflict?"

"Of course. But I will take responsibility and ensure that such an incident does not occur. I will make sure that no other country can retaliate against South Korea. That much, I can promise."

"Hmm..."

Even though the Black Scythe had promised to take measures to prevent national conflict, the president's expression remained uncertain. Putting the safety of the nation first required careful consideration.

"What do others think about this?"

"Although the intention of helping other countries is commendable, if things go wrong, it could become a diplomatic issue..."

"But didn't Mr. Black Scythe assure that there would be no retaliation?"

"Does everything in this world go as we wish? We need to consider uncertainties."

"In my opinion, as long as Mr. Black Scythe takes responsibility, there shouldn't be any problem..."

"Are you suggesting that we entrust the fate of a nation to Mr. Black Scythe?"

"Don't phrase it like it's a complaint. If there's a country in crisis, helping them is only natural, isn't it?"

"That's correct. When someone is in danger, the first thing to do is to help, without nitpicking on various details. Moreover, we have the Black Scythe, who is considered the best among players, among us. There shouldn't be any worries."

"I agree. If things work out well, it will elevate Korea's standing like nothing else."

The ministers, the prime minister, and the director each expressed their opinions.

Amidst this, the president glanced at Ryu Min.

'Wearing a mask, it's impossible to read his expression.'

The president, initially indecisive about whether to trust the Black Scythe, quickly organized his thoughts.

'Although his identity is not revealed, he has already shown credibility. If he wanted, he could have killed me right here, but he hasn't. Probably because he doesn't want the country to collapse. He willingly steps forward to help other countries with the same intention.'

His genuine concern for the nation and its people was evident.

He didn't seem like a person without a sense of responsibility, willing to neglect conflicts with other nations.

"Do we trust him?"

"Yes. Please trust me."

Was Ryu Min's firm statement the deciding factor?

"Alright. We will accept all the opinions you've requested. When would you like to begin?"

"Sooner is better."

"Then let's proceed immediately. Chief Secretary."

"Yes."

"Please arrange a platform for Mr. Black Scythe to deliver a nationwide speech."

"Understood, Mr. President. Follow me, Mr. Black Scythe."

After a bow to the president, Ryu Min followed the chief secretary.

Ddu-e-eun, ddu-e-eun-

"Just a moment. I have a call."

Ryu Min lifted the phone, checking the caller ID.

'John Delgado?'

It seemed related to the Messiah, asking to contact in case there was information to deliver.

"Yes. What's the matter? Ah, I see. Have you arranged the meeting from your end? Alright. Please send me the details through text."

The chief secretary answered the phone in a polite tone.

As if it was nothing serious.

However, the content of the call was far from light.

'John Delgado's identity seems to have been revealed earlier than I thought. Messiah's side proposed to meet first.'

He heard that Messiah's side came looking for him, questioning if he was in an alliance with the Black Scythe. They insisted on arranging a meeting and even set a location.

'How audacious. Instead of coming to me directly, they are telling me to come to the agreed meeting place?'
ChatGPT

Seeing their demand to come to the designated location, there was undoubtedly some trickery involved.

"Alright. Let's enter the snake's mouth willingly."

With a self-assured smile, Ryu Min sent a single text message before lifting his head.

"Shall we go, Chief Secretary?"

"Yes."

The content of the message he sent was as follows:

[Prepare the private jet, Yantti. It's time for an overseas business trip.]

Against the backdrop of the Blue House, a man wearing a white mask stepped forward.

"Hello. I am a player from Korea who goes by the nickname Black Scythe."

Click-click-

The shutters of the cameras lined up in the front row flashed.

Behind, reporters with laptops at the ready stood, prepared for the swift-footed journalists.

"I am not a government official, so it may be puzzling for me to suddenly hold a press conference and make an announcement. You may question what qualifies me to stand here. However, I had to create this opportunity because I have something important to say to people around the world."

When Ryu Min paused, the audience fell silent.

Why was he hesitating before delivering his message?

Everyone who was curious fell silent, leaning in to listen.

"As some of you may already know, a few months ago, I eliminated the leader of IS and the remaining forces. The reason was simple: I dislike criminals. Their existence is nothing but a menace. In that sense, I want to issue a warning to players worldwide."

At the mention of a warning, everyone held their breath.

A statement that could turn players worldwide into enemies.

Arrogant, but in a way, it was remarkable.

Only the Black Scythe could make such a statement.

"If there is a player intoxicated by power, seizing control of governments and intimidating civilians, stop immediately. I do not want players involved in crime. I do not wish to further tarnish the image of players. Consider this a warning to them. If they do not cease their wrongdoing..."

The eyes behind the mask of the Black Scythe gleamed fiercely.

"I will personally go and pass judgment. I will rescue the citizens in danger. So, if anyone has suffered from a player's crime, please feel free to ask for my help anytime. The reason I borrowed this place, with the President's permission, is because I want to protect more people from these despicable players. So, do not hesitate. Just make a call to the Korean Embassy. If you do, then..."

After a brief pause, Ryu Min continued speaking.

"I will willingly rescue any country dominated by players. If you request help, regardless of which country is under the influence of players, we will assist. This is a declaration against players worldwide, arrogant and audacious. Nevertheless, no one could mock the Black Scythe as he descended from the stage. He possessed the ability to back up his words.

'The declaration has been made, and...'

As Ryu Min turned his head, he saw the President ascending to the stage. The President took to the stage to add credibility to Ryu Min's words.

"As mentioned by Mr. Black Scythe earlier, if there is a country oppressed by players, please contact our Korean Embassy. I promise, on behalf of the President, that immediate action will be taken. Thank you."

After concluding the speech, the President descended from the stage and glanced around before finding the Chief Secretary.

"Where is Mr. Black Scythe?"

"He said he had urgent matters and left first."

"Urgent matters?"

"He didn't provide details. Just mentioned that if there's any information, verify the source and ask for contact. Oh, and he said this too: since he's in flight, calls might not go through, so if possible, send an email..."

"In flight?"

Why would he be going abroad?

'Well, it doesn't matter. The dice have been cast, and now all I can do is trust the Black Scythe.'

President Yoon Sung-ho, who briefly wore a worried expression, moved forward with his security personnel.
