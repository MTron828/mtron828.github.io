Title: "Episode 279 of the 100th Regression for a Max Level Player"

Episode 279. End of Round 17

★ Round 17 Results Summary ★

[Unified Area CA-EA001]

└ 1st place: Black Scythe (Level 98 Reaper) Gold Used: 100,000,000

└ 2nd place: Democracy (Level 73 Buffer) Gold Used: 50,000,000

└ 3rd place: Crisi (Level 73 Priest) Gold Used: 40,000,000

No player was surprised by the results.

It was exactly as expected.

It was known that rankings would be measured according to the gold used, favoring the Black Scythe.

[The ranking method for this round is based on the order of using the most gold!]

Therefore, there was no one nodding in agreement with the Angel's additional explanation.

Because they already knew.

That victory in the war meant everyone would survive.

And that substantial rewards would be given.

Only, they did not know what the rewards were.

Until they saw the message.

[As a reward for clearing Round 17, experience points and gold will be given to all members.] [With the victory of the Kingdom Alliance, the experience points and gold obtained will increase tenfold.] [Experience Points +47.68%] [Gold +3,000,000] [As an additional reward for the Kingdom Alliance's victory, the 'Condensed Ether,' a god-grade material item, has been granted.] [Condensed Ether has been added to the inventory.]

Contrary to expectations, the players were all wide-eyed at the substantial rewards.

"They're giving us 3 million gold?"

"Is it obvious since we spent a lot of gold?"

"More than that, the experience points are unbelievable."

"My level just increased by 10 in one go!"

The levels of players in their 70s jumped to the 80s.

Although it was just an increase of 20 stats, the change in the tens digit of the level made them feel significantly stronger.

"It's too early to be surprised. If we survive the next Round 18, we'll get twice as much experience points as now."

Some players were eager for rapid growth, but not everyone felt the same way.

Ryumin felt that way.

"I have no choice but to hit the max level in the next round, right?"

To go from level 98 to 99, you need ten times more experience points than before.
ChatGPT

"So fortunately, the disaster of reaching the max level was avoided, but there's no way to avoid the experience points to be gained in the next Round 18.

'I wanted to delay reaching the max level as much as possible, but there's no choice.'

Whether it was because of reaching a high level, people were excited, but the reward they should pay attention to wasn't the experience points.

It was the god-grade material that was notoriously difficult to obtain.

"Condensed Ether?"

"This is a god-grade material?"

"But what is a god-grade?"

People still didn't know the value of the items they received.

'Well, you'd have to try making a god-grade item to know.'

I once used a material package as a reward for Round 11, and a god-grade glove pattern came out.

I remember putting it on the PPL Market and selling it, so someone might have made it.

'No, maybe they couldn't make it because they didn't have Condensed Ether?'

While other god-grade materials are relatively easy to obtain, Condensed Ether is not.

A rare item that rolled in one per person.

However, people didn't have particularly happy expressions.

Was that bothering them?

The Angel explains the value of the items on their own.

[Perhaps because you won a difficult Kingdom Alliance, an enormous reward has come out. A god-grade material has appeared. Huh? Don't know what god-grade is? The highest-grade item you can barely obtain even if you try hard until Round 20 is called god-grade.]

'It's not the highest grade. There's Eternal.'

But the Angel didn't mention that.

Whether intentionally not saying it, or truly not knowing.

Either way, like the Angel said, god-grade is as hard to come by as picking stars from the sky.

He himself had six such god-grade items.

[Congratulations! You have achieved the quest as the 1st place in this area!] [Currently, 'Black Scythe' is ranked 1st in this area.] [As a reward for ranking 1st in this area, 'Infinite Material Pouch' is granted!] [As a reward for ranking 1st in this area, 'Special Reward Selection Box' is granted!]

'This time, the reward is once again the Infinite Material Pouch.'

Three consecutive material pouches.

It seems that such items are given to gather materials and make god-grade items."
ChatGPT

"It's me, I've already graduated from god-grade and need to create something beyond that.

[You can choose one of the following special rewards.] [Please touch the desired reward.]

└ 1. Temporary Skill - Sweep (Limited to Round 18)

└ 2. Temporary Skill - Faction Change Voucher (Limited to Round 18)

└ 3. Information about Round 18

Upon using the special reward selection box, noticeable rewards appear.

'A faction change voucher... I might actually use this.'

Originally, Ryumin, who chose to sweep and exterminate demons in Round 18, had a change of situation.

Now, killing the Angel was a considerable advantage.

◀ ROUND 17 Ends ▶

[Unified Area CA-EA001]

└ Survivors: 286

[After a while, the soul will be transferred to the original dimension.] [Round 18 will start at midnight on June 1, 2023. See you in the next round. Congratulations on surviving.]

Michael sat in front of the table with a tense expression.

Soon, the face of the Demon Lord of the Great Demon Hunt would appear before him.

'Why am I so tense about talking to him...'

It's not the first time Michael is conversing with the Demon Lord.

As they've clashed in six Heavenly Demon Wars, they often share a casual conversation through the screen when there are issues to be negotiated.

Yet, Michael couldn't help but feel tense.

'There's a lot at stake in this negotiation.'

He deceived the gods according to the plan of the Black Scythe and risked his life.

But that wasn't the end of it.

'Depending on how we conclude this negotiation, the outcome of the war is at stake.'

The 7th Heavenly Demon War that would occur after Round 20.

Winning that war is not only to satisfy the gods supporting the Celestials but also to ensure his own survival.

'And then... I can become a god as planned.'

It's been revealed that if he conquers Round 20, the system will fulfill his wish, but in reality, it wasn't limited to just humans.

'By using that wish-granting apparatus for beings, I can become a god.'

To achieve this, Michael intended to keep the Black Scythe alive until Round 20.

Judging by his actions, it seemed that the Black Scythe was the only candidate to take possession of the wish-granting apparatus.
ChatGPT

"But that's only the story after winning the war."

If you lose in the 7th Heavenly Demon War, the wish to become a god will vanish like a bubble.

"Even if I can't obtain the wish-granting apparatus, I must not lose in the war."

Ultimately, even if he has to abandon the Black Scythe, the war must lead to victory without fail.

That's why the negotiation with the Demon Lord was crucial.

At that moment, the face of the Demon Lord appeared on the screen.

"Why do you keep calling a busy person? It's annoying."

Fluctuos, who immediately complained upon appearing, but Michael responded with a gentle smile.

Regardless of what anyone says, in this negotiation, the one with the upper hand was the Demon Lord.

"Thank you for making time for us, Your Excellency. Michael respectfully greets you. What did you call me for? I hope we can wrap it up quickly."

"He talks like a slippery eel. Pretends not to know when he knows everything."

Though he wanted to retort like during the previous war, Michael gave a wry smile.

"Understood. Since you're a busy person, let's get straight to the point. You demanded the Black Scythe to be brought to you, but if you could extend the agreed-upon time a bit more..."

"That won't do. If you don't bring him by Round 18, I'll declare war immediately."

"I'm not asking for a big extension. Just a little..."

"I said no."

Fluctuos was firm.

He even turned his head, fists clenched.

As if to say, don't even dream of negotiating.

"If I start the war now, I'll definitely win. That's why he's coming out so stubbornly."

As expected, it was bitter, knowing that he had no choice but to yield, pleading for the war to be postponed.

"But it's still better than losing."

Even if he lost in the 6th Heavenly Demon War, what if he lost again this time?

He wouldn't face the gods he was counting on, including Archangel Artaros.

"However, I must find a way to buy time, no matter what. If the war breaks out now, defeat is inevitable."

The determined expression on Michael's face turned into a pleading look, as if to say, when did it become like this.
ChatGPT

"Please reconsider, Your Excellency. It's not that we won't give the Black Scythe. Just wait for one more round, precisely in Round 18, the day of the friendly war. As planned, we will hand over the Black Scythe. Please show mercy."

Despite trying to explain the situation, Fluctuos only snorted.

"Hmph, no matter what, it can't be postponed. A promise is a promise. If the Black Scythe is not in the Demon Castle when Round 18 starts, I will initiate the war as agreed. Meanwhile, I will personally manifest my power and participate in the war, which is only natural." [...]

Originally, Fluctuos had a body that couldn't participate in the Heavenly Demon War.

Because his power was too overwhelming.

"According to rumors, it's said to be comparable to Lord Artaros."

That Fluctuos would participate in the Heavenly Demon War with his own power?

The result was predictable.

The 7th Heavenly Demon War would end in the defeat of the Celestials.

"You were the ones who violated the rules first. I can legitimately claim it and, as compensation, initiate the war early. I can even participate directly in the war. So don't complain about unfairness. This is established by the rules, and both sides' gods have agreed. So don't think about negotiating with me." [...]

Once again, negotiation proved futile.

"Just asking to wait for one round..."

Chewing on his lower lip, Michael sighed as if there was no other choice.

"Well, there's no other way. Fine, I'll give it to you." [What are you giving?] "Authorization to access the Akashic Records."

Fluctuos's expression, consistent throughout the conversation, changed unexpectedly.

An unexpected reaction.

But only for a moment.

As if it was what he desired, he smirked.
ChatGPT

"Are you really willing to concede access to the Akashic Records?" "Until now, it was limited to the use by the Celestials according to both parties' regulations, but... if you delay the war, I will allow the demons to use it as well." "No, no. Not the demons 'as well,' but the demons 'only' should be allowed to use it." "That's an unreasonable request. It's our hard-earned authorization, and you're asking us to simply hand it over. Even if we lose in the war, that's difficult to accept." "Is that so? Then, at least allow us to share it together." "Understood. We will do that... but, we cannot delay the war. We can only extend the promised deadline to within Round 18." [...]

Indeed, as the highest authority among the demons, he seemed experienced.

He didn't bite the bait easily.

"So, if you hand over the Black Scythe in Round 18, you're saying you won't immediately start the war?" "Yes. If you share the authorization of the Akashic Records with us, that is."

Michael had to manage his expression carefully.

'There's really no negotiating with a tough nut.'

The price for extending the deadline was too high.

'Can't be helped. Negotiating like this is the only option to delay the war.'

Although giving up the Black Scythe was regrettable, it wasn't more important than avoiding the war.

"We will do as you ask." "Good. Then, is the negotiation concluded?" "Yes." "Don't talk nonsense later. The conversation is being recorded." "Understood."

Seemingly satisfied with that response, Fluctuos revealed a smile.
