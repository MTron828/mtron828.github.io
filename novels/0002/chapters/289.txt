Title: Episode 289 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Judgment

Ryumin was perplexed by the unexpected message.

"Conducting a divine transformation?"

Using divine power and being on par with gods?

What could those words mean?

"Are they saying I've become a god now?"

However, there was no change in his body.

Not even the usual effects occurred.

It proceeded quietly without any rumors, and he only found out through the message.

"Have I truly become a god? Have I taken a position to confront the gods?"

Amidst his confusion, a message that caught his attention appeared.

[A new soul-binding quest is available.]

└ Kill a God

└ Current number of killed gods (0/4)

└ Success ▶ ?????

Seeing the quest, Ryumin let out a bitter laugh.

"Hah, now I have to kill gods, at the very least?"

He had killed an Archangel, and now they wanted him to kill gods—not just one but four.

Of course, he had no reason to refuse.

He also had debts to settle with the gods.

He knew the whole story from Michael.

"When you think about it, the culprits behind all this are those bastards calling themselves gods."

The bored gods turned the conflict between angels and demons into mere entertainment.

They placed bets on who would win and wanted to raise humans as mercenaries.

"The real bastards to be killed are those guys. Gods who only care about the outcome of their bets, whether humans live or die."

Therefore, Ryumin couldn't help but harbor ill feelings.

The Archangels, even if they were commanded to do so, were bad, but the gods who exerted pressure from above were also villains.

"In a way, even worse bastards."

Meanwhile, the unexpected divine transformation that had taken place, which could be seen as the best reward for Ryumin in his current state of frustration.

"At least it opens the way for revenge against the gods."

"Though telling me to kill four of them is a bit much. Who am I supposed to kill anyway?"

He didn't know who the enemies were, and he had never encountered them.

The only god Ryumin knew of was one.

"Flunitos."

If that guy, who was said to be at the level of gods in the Demon King's Castle, was the opponent, then he would be a suitable match.

It might be possible to test if I can really face a god.

"Maybe I can fill in one of the quest numbers."

Although I don't know how strong Flunitos is.

With such thoughts, Ryumin came with a somewhat tense face...

Swish, swish!

"This is way below expectations."

Flunitos, wielding the whip, didn't seem threatening at all.

What if it touches the sparks? But what if it doesn't?

"Too slow."

Considering the speed of the whip, its trajectory, and the angle of the flames, Ryumin thought that with his level, he could avoid even a single hair being touched.

With many openings and his own speed, he could approach Flunitos's nose in an instant.

"Thanks to the Rune of Combat, maybe? It seems to provide an estimate."

How to attack to kill in one go, how much damage he would receive in a fight against the opponent - all the information was read.

Above all, it was reassuring that the opponent's thoughts were being read.

"The Rune of Innermost Thoughts, which was ineffective against gods, is working."

This meant that Ryumin was in an equal position with the gods.

The divine transformation did happen; it wasn't a lie.

"All the Runes are now connected to the gods, and I can also use divine power."

If you understand divine power as a concept similar to mana in fantasy or the sacred power used by angels, it becomes easier to comprehend.

The information was gathered by reading Flunitos's thoughts.

"Because divine power is a higher form of energy, players cannot harm the bodies of gods."

But just a moment ago, Ryumin skillfully cut off a part of Flunitos's cheek.

Now Ryumin had the qualification to kill a god.

"In that case, there's no need to hesitate."

Ryumin, with sharp eyes, raised his scythe.

The divine power emanating naturally from his body was transmitted through his scythe.

"I'll kill you quickly. There won't be any pain."

Ryumin rushed towards Flunitos, who was vigorously wielding the whip on the ground.

"Wow, you bug! I'll throw you straight into the fire... Oops!"

Ryumin, who thought he was rushing towards the ground, was suddenly above Flunitos's head.

In an instant, he made a leap at a speed that couldn't be followed with the eyes.
ChatGPT

[Dieeeee!]

Seeing Ryumin above his head, Flunitos panicked and swung his whip like a windmill.

Ssssssh!

Sparks flew, but Ryumin effortlessly lifted his foot in mid-air.

As long as there was darkness, there was no space he couldn't step on.

"It's over."

[Ugh!]

The scythe sliced through Flunitos's neck and passed by.

Although he anticipated that his massive head would thud to the ground.

"What...?"

Such a thing did not happen.

"I don't feel the sensation of the scythe at the end."

Moreover, the surroundings changed in the blink of an eye.

A pitch-black space where nothing was visible.

"I'm not experiencing an illusion. I really fell into a different space."

As evidence, Flunitos's position, which had been detected moments ago, could not be felt at all.

"Or maybe it's interfering with detection."

He looked around nervously, but nothing was detected, and nothing could be seen.

A feeling of being plunged into an endless abyss.

Just as irritation was about to overcome curiosity, someone appeared.

The presence was an angel.

It seemed that way at first glance.

However, it was not just an ordinary angel like the others.

"Is darkness being pushed back around him?"

The feeling of darkness melting away like snow in the self-illuminating light of the angel.

In other words, an overwhelming atmosphere.

Even Ryumin couldn't help but open his mouth in awe as the angel approached, pushing away the darkness.

"Wait. That guy...?"

Up close, the appearance seemed familiar.

It was an angel that Ryumin had seen somewhere before.

"It's him. The angel I first saw in the 68th round."

The vaguely remembered face overlapped with the face of the angel he was now facing.

It matched exactly.

The overwhelming atmosphere and strength he felt at that time were also present.

[So, you're the Black Reaper.]

"Are we acquainted?"

[Hmm? Have I seen you before?]

"Maybe? Anyway, angels all look alike, so who knows who is who, tsk."

[Don't treat me like the other angels.]

"Why don't you introduce yourself then? I don't even know who you are."

[Don't treat me like an ordinary angel.]
ChatGPT

Ryumin's grumbling elicited a sly smile from the angel.

It wasn't an amused expression; rather, it carried a sense of pity.

[My name is Artaros. I am the ruler of the Celestial Realm, the Archangel Supreme, and an angel imbued with divinity.]

Artaros.

Before he even introduced himself, Ryumin knew that name.

"I've heard about you from Michael. There's an angel classified as a god, different from the rest."

The word "god" was not a lie.

He had read thoughts with the Rune of Innermost Thoughts, and with the eyes of insight, he had pierced through the essence.

[Artaros]

└ Race: Angel

└ Alignment: Evil

└ Position: Archangel Supreme

└ Notable: Ruler of the Celestial Realm and the highest of the high. Once the Archangel Supreme of the Celestials, he was promoted to the rank of god. While he looks like an angel, he is clearly classified as a god.

└ Weakness: .......

"Is this the angel I met before?"

Although Ryumin knew the opponent from their first encounter, he remembered the face.

However, there was no clear recollection of the conversation they had at that time.

"So, I deliberately floated to see if you recognized me."

But the opponent genuinely seemed unaware.

Ryumin obtained useful information that even gods don't know the information from the previous rounds.

"By the way, why can't I read the weakness part?"

For some reason unknown, he couldn't read it, but one thing was for sure – there was no positive sentiment toward him.

"Ahaha, a god, like Flunitos?"

[Comparing me to a half-baked like Flunitos is irritating. Unlike him, my divine power is not bound by location.]

"But does that mean you can imprison people in places like this using your fancy divine power?"

[This is not a prison but a dimensionless space. No one can access this place within the crevices of dimensions.]

"So what? Why did you lock me up in this gloomy place? Are you the creator of the sudden appearance of angels?"

Even with Ryumin's sarcasm, Artaros showed no change in expression.

He read his thoughts, yet there was no sign of disturbance.

'It's certainly different from the wishy-washy ones until now.'

It seemed like a statue with no emotions or atmosphere.

[The reason is simple. I had to separate you from Flunitos. Otherwise, you would have died.]
ChatGPT

"The angels protected the demons? This is just like saying the President is secretly helping North Korea, isn't it? If the angels find out, it will be chaos, right?"

"The angels won't know. They have no knowledge of what happened in the Demon Citadel."

"I'll go out and spread the word. The Archangel Supreme is conspiring with the Demon Grand Duke behind the scenes. What will happen then? A coup, perhaps? Hehe."

Even deliberately provoking and ridiculing, Artaros remained stoic.

"There won't be such a thing. You won't be leaving this place."

"We'll see about that."

"And it's not like I helped the Demon Grand Duke because I liked it. I followed orders from above and acted accordingly."

"Don't escape from reality. Anyway, you're called a spy."

"We can't communicate."

"Oh, did you come here to have a conversation with me? What could the great Archangel Supreme have to say to a mere insect-like human?"

Ryumin saw it in that moment.

A brief but perceptible twitch of Artaros's eyebrows.

"...There's no time to play word games. Let's reveal the charges and proceed with the judgment."

"Charges? Judgment?"

He laughed as if it were absurd, but Artaros ignored him and continued speaking.

"The player 'Black Reaper' is a heinous murderer who disrupted the order of the Celestial Realm by killing seven Archangels and committed cruel massacres, meaninglessly slaughtering numerous angels and demons."

"This is ridiculous. And what about you guys? You, who killed billions of humans, who is judging you? Isn't killing thousands okay compared to billions?"

"Furthermore, by excessively abusing power unrelated to the topic, disturbing the balance, and incurring the wrath of the gods, he committed an unforgivable transgression."

"What nonsense. Aren't you trying to kill because it interferes with the gods' game? It's not okay to kill thousands for the sake of billions?"

"Therefore, I, Artaros, Archangel Supreme and Ruler of the Celestial Realm, based on the qualifications for judgment, will annihilate the sinner 'Black Reaper' and exclude him from the game."

"So, you're going to kill him because he's causing a fuss? To give Flunitos a chance to escape. Right?"

Artaros did not respond.

He simply conjured a dazzling sword in his hand.

"Let the sinner accept the judgment quietly without resistance."
ChatGPT

As those words ended, Artaros's sword descended menacingly.

Ting-!

When Ryumin's scythe deflected the sword, Artaros blinked, seemingly surprised.

"Feel free to give it a try if you think you can."
