Title: Episode 152 of the 100th Reincarnation of a Max Level Player

Victor's Dilemma

Victor wanted to talk to his family.

He wanted to share with them the harsh experiences and numerous atrocities he had endured in the past year in the Infinite System.

But now, he couldn't do that.

"Sophia, did you hear? I ranked first in the zone again this time."

"Do you know how proud that makes me? Having the rare Guardian profession and all."

His younger sister, who had worried he might be eliminated in the rounds, was living better than he had expected.

"No, it's not just living well. It's like she's completely turned her life around."

Sophia claimed that she was achieving the zone's top rank effortlessly, something Victor had never been able to accomplish.

"It's probably not a lie. Sophia can't stand lies, after all."

Contrary to his concerns, seeing her doing well brought both disappointment and relief.

Suddenly, when he looked up and saw his parents, he noticed their faces were brightened.

How could they not be happy when their daughter was thriving in another world?

"How can I tell them? That I suffered so much in the Infinite System, being held captive..."

He couldn't bring himself to spoil their joy with such information.

But then his parents asked about it.

"Victor, what happened all this time? Why didn't you contact us for a whole year?"

"Uh... Well, you see."

Victor, torn between sharing his gloomy story or keeping the atmosphere intact, finally made a decision.

He decided not to ruin the mood by talking about his depressing experiences.

"Oh, I just went on a trip abroad."

"What? A trip?"

His parents were astonished at the unexpected answer.

"Is that true? I thought you were kidnapped by the IS and died!"

"Haha... IS, huh? What a world we live in these days..."

"So, did you really go on a pleasant trip?"

"What about communication? Why didn't you contact us at all?"

"I lost my phone..."

"But even if you lost it, why wouldn't you contact us? We were worried!"

Victor hung his head in silence.

However, Victor's heart, despite appearances, had become much weaker and more damaged during the year of his abduction.

"Son! I prepared food for you. Eat."

"Yes!"

While eating a long-awaited meal with his family, he shared stories that he hadn't been able to tell before.

And around evening, Victor was able to reunite with his sister, who came in late.

"Oh, oppa!"

"Sophia!"

The two embraced each other, shedding tears.

Although rare, they were siblings with a good relationship, having rarely fought in the past.

"Where were you, oppa? I searched for you so much!"

"Hahaha, well, you see..."

Victor, sweating nervously, once again told a well-intentioned lie.

Naturally, his sister's response was a scolding.

"No matter if it's a trip, who just leaves like that! You could have at least left a single message!"

"Hmm. Whether it's you or our parents, all of you sound the same."

"We were worried! We thought you were gone for good! There were even major upheavals!"

"I thought the same about you. I never expected you to survive until the 9th round..."

"Oppa, didn't you hear what I said? I've been the top player since the 1st round. Oh, of course, it's the top rank in that zone. The overall zone is dominated by a player called Black Scythe. You know him if you're a player, right? Black Scythe."

"Huh? Uh... yeah..."

You only know the name?

He had talked with Black Scythe, been saved by him, and witnessed his terrifying power firsthand.

He was much closer to Black Scythe than his sister, who only knew the name.

"That player called Black Scythe is really amazing, don't you think? His level is incredibly high."

"I-Indeed. Well..."

"I heard he's a player from Korea. Have you been to Korea? Couldn't you go because it's too far?"

"Uh, Korea? Black Scythe is a Korean player?"

"Yeah. Didn't you know? It's already a well-known fact. He's the leader of the unit that captures criminal players in Korea, called CPF."

"Oh, I see."

He didn't know.

He had lived in an environment where he couldn't even glimpse a phone for a year.

"He's also dealing with criminals there? Amazing."

In his homeland, witnessing Black Scythe's efforts to eradicate crime filled Victor with newfound admiration.

"But, oppa, how did you survive all this time? What's your profession?"

"Me? I'm an alchemist."

"Alchemist? There's such a profession?"

"I could say the same. What does a Guardian do?"

As they asked each other about things they didn't know, time quickly passed.

With the shared element of being players added to their already close sibling bond, a deeper sense of camaraderie emerged.

As the happy moments flowed, it was past midnight when Victor lay on his bed, deep in thought.

About his future actions.

"Now that I've talked to Sophia, there's no need to worry. She's handling things well on her own."

In both the real world and the otherworld, his sister was receiving favorable treatment.

This was when he was struggling for his life, caught in the grip of the Infinite System.

"Ricky's parents agreed to take care of him, Marcus is responsible for finding him, and the other kids are all safe. The monsters from the IS that tormented me have all been eliminated by Black Scythe."

Everything had fallen into place smoothly.

There was no longer anything to worry about.

"But why does my heart feel so empty?"

Was it because of the harsh suffering under the IS?

Or perhaps, after observing the atrocities of those beast-like beings day after day, did his soul wear thin?

Victor, staring blankly at the ceiling with vacant eyes, fell deep into contemplation.

To the extent that he couldn't even hear the sound of knocking at the window right beside him.

Thump, thump, thump -

"Huh?"

Belatedly hearing the sound, Victor looked at the window and was startled.

"W-Black Scythe?"

Responding to the gesture to come out, he rushed outside and indeed found Black Scythe standing there.

"Oh, hello. What brings you to our house? If you need potions, I can provide them..."

As Victor fumbled through his inventory, Black Scythe, still wearing his mask, shook his head.

"No. I came here to tell you something."

"To tell me something? Could it be about the IS..."

"Don't worry about the IS. It's already been taken care of. You'll hear good news through the news tomorrow."

"Oh, that's a relief. Then, what did you come to tell me..."

"Victor Jafaille."

Black Scythe set the tone with a solemn voice.

"...Don't give up."

"Yes? I didn't hear you clearly."

"Do not give up on life."

"..."

"I understand. You must have gone through something in the IS, endured severe pain. But."

Pausing briefly, Ryumin looked around the house before continuing.

"Don't you have family to protect?"

"I don't know why you suddenly bring this up, but my family is fine. My sister is doing well without me. The goals have been achieved, and there's no lingering..."

"You are arrogant."

"Yes?"

"Achievement of goals? Do you think life is a simple game that ends when you clear a mission?"

"..."

"Life continues until death. Life is a game that doesn't end until you die. The survival game we're playing now is no different."

"..."

"Whether you finish the strategy by reaching Round 20 or die before that, you must keep moving until you reach one of those outcomes. But you think achieving a small goal of meeting your family is the end? That there's no more lingering? How lightly do you take life to say such things? If that's not arrogance, what is?"

Victor silently listened to the storm of words that raged on.

There was no denying that what was said had some truth.

"Don't give up on life. If you give up on the survival game, what will happen to the remaining family?"

"Well, I don't know. They probably wouldn't live as smoothly as..."

"Do you really think your family lived without any problems during Victor's absence? A son they didn't know if he was alive or dead, waiting nervously by the front door, unsure of when he might return?"

"..."

"The reason your family could endure was the expectation and hope that Victor, you, could come back. If you die in the next round, what about that hope? What will happen to your family? Can they live a normal life?"

"..."

Ryumin, feeling the need to wrap things up, drove the point home.

"Victor. You just want to rest. After suffering for a year, you probably desire peace through death."

A shock, as if struck on the head with a hammer, resonated through Victor's bones.

"I understand. However, that's not the path to benefit your family. On the contrary, it's a selfish decision for oneself."

"..."

"I hope you persist until the end. Until Round 20. Your sister, Sophia. I know she's a famous ranker in Nigeria. But do you really believe she can endure until Round 20 without you, Victor?"

Victor's emotions seemed to sway like the wind.

Ryumin felt the persuasion was nearly over and concluded his remarks.

"Please protect Sophia. Alchemist is a unique class specialized in support in this world. If you're with her, there's no chance she'll be eliminated before Round 20. Of course, if the opportunity arises, I'll assist in the strategy too. This is fate, so let's survive."

"Thank you for your words, but someone like me protecting my sister..."

"You can definitely protect her. As proof, let me show you this."

Ryumin took out an item from his inventory.

Looking at the information of the item, Victor was astonished.

It was a legendary item, a Potion of Life, capable of resurrecting a person.

"I obtained this item by chance. If you use it, you can revive a dead player. This means you can protect Sophia even if she dies by your side."

"Can an alchemist really create such a potion?"

"Of course. If it's a potion, why couldn't they create it? However, based on the usage restrictions, potions can only be used by Masters or higher. That means you need to reach at least level 60 to qualify for potion-making."

"Ah..."

It was just as Black Scythe had said.

If he reached level 60, he might be able to make a Potion of Life.

That way, even if Sophia died in unforeseen circumstances, he could protect her.

"If you want to protect Sophia from death, aim for level 60. If you have no goals, find new ones. Instead of giving up on life like an old man disillusioned with life."

Looking into Victor's eyes, a vitality that hadn't been there before seemed to return.

Seeing the potion, a new goal had arisen.

"Thank you for your words. My mind was strangely confused and complicated, but now it feels organized. You're the only one who has spoken to me like this, Black Scythe. I truly appreciate it."

"I'm glad it helped."

"But how do you understand my feelings so well?"

"I have a knack for reading people. Call it insight, perhaps?"

Insight?

It was not something that could be summed up with such a simple word.

It felt like finding light in the darkness.

It felt like being pulled out of a murky abyss.

'Indeed, Black Scythe is truly remarkable. Almost like a divine presence in the mortal world.'

"That's all I wanted to say. I came to deliver this message. It's a shame when someone you rescued disappears without any enthusiasm."

"I'm sorry... for showing such a pathetic side of me. But now, please don't worry. I have a new goal. I won't entertain futile thoughts anymore."

"Good to hear. I trust you."

Ryumin, confirming that Victor's mindset had completely changed, smiled faintly beneath the mask.

"Before I leave, let me offer one last piece of advice. Be open and honest with your family, don't hide anything. It will help alleviate the frustrating situation."

Victor's eyes widened significantly.

"To see even the things I haven't told my family... How on earth..."

That's when it happened.

"Oppa!"

Suddenly, Sophia appeared, holding a sword and shield.

"Who are you talking to in the middle of the night?"

"Oh, this person is... Huh?"

Victor turned his head, but Black Scythe had already disappeared.

"Oppa, who was that? You were just talking to someone wearing a strange mask."

As Victor pondered Sophia's question, he hesitated before speaking.

"...Scythe."

"Huh?"

"...It was Black Scythe."

"What?"

Looking at the astonished Sophia, Victor made up his mind.

He decided to heed Black Scythe's advice.
