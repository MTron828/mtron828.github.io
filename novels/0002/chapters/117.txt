Title: Episode 117 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player

Reward of the Elves

Ryumin did not change his facial expression.

With the appearance of the Black Scythe, he knocked out the betrayers.

'These guys are already dead. Even if I don't kill them.'

The elves were more indifferent than expected.

Especially, there was no mercy for the mercenaries aiming for the princess.

The reason Ryumin didn't hide his identity is here.

Because the only betrayer left alive would be himself.

Tock, tock-

He kicked the unconscious guys with his foot.

One had a severed wrist, and the other two were unharmed.

'Clearly unconscious.'

With a blade with a power of 464, he slashed their necks.

Suddenly standing up, it wouldn't be easy to accuse the betrayer with the Black Scythe.

Staggering steps-

As Yggrito approached, Ryumin raised his head.

"...."

He didn't ask Ryumin who he was.

First, it was necessary to calmly assess the situation.

Yggrito's gaze moved towards the rookie knight who was nearby.

"Jerrif."

"Yes!"

"Have you seen what the situation is?"

"Yes! Four warriors from another world suddenly atta... No, they attacked the carriage the lady was riding. One of them died under a gravity spell, and the other three were hit by her and fainted."

"The princess? Is she safe?"

"No... I mean, the lady is unharmed..."

"There's no need to hide it. It's already revealed."

"Oh, yes! The princess is unharmed. She's currently taking a break inside the carriage because she's too shocked."

"So, are you saying that the warriors from another world here saved the princess?"

"That's correct. If this person hadn't intervened in time, the princess would have been in big trouble."

At those words, Yggrito bowed his head to Ryumin without hesitation.

Since the rookie wouldn't lie, it was proven that the person in front of him was the benefactor.

"Thank you for saving our princess. If it's not too much trouble, may we know the name of our benefactor?"

Ryumin thought about using a title but refrained.

There was no need to hide the name like the dwarf earlier, as there were no betrayers left standing.

"It's the Black Scythe."
ChatGPT

"Black Scythe..."

Even in informal language, Yggrito didn't feel offended. Rather, as if remembering, he bowed his head again.

"Once again, thank you, Black Scythe. I'm sorry, but could you please explain the situation? We don't understand why warriors from another world targeted the princess."

Ryumin nodded and gave a brief explanation. After all, the werewolf attack was coming to an end, and the current situation was more critical than hunting. It was an opportunity to strengthen ties with the elves.

As Yggrito quietly listened to the explanation, his eyes widened.

"Betrayers? Are you saying there are betrayers among the warriors from another world?"

"That's right."

"Could it be that they allied with the Demon Lord Plunictos?"

"Demon? No, they joined hands with an angel."

Ryumin vaguely explained, "I don't know about that, but I assume there are complex relationships involved."

"Oh... In that case, would you like us to secure these newcomers?"

"No, they have nothing to do with me."

"Then, may we handle these people according to our laws?"

"Feel free."

Yggrito looked down at the betrayers and drew his sword.

Swish, swish, swish!

He struck three times, separating their heads from their bodies.

Without asking, Ryumin responded to Yggrito, who hadn't asked a question.

"The ones who targeted the princess are to be executed immediately."

Without mercy, he killed them without even considering interrogation, but that was the elven law. It was said that words coming from the mouth of a mercenary were not to be trusted.

Elven law was indeed frightening.

Although he already knew this.

"Thank you very, very much for saving the princess, Black Scythe."

'How many times do they need to express gratitude? Come on, give me the reward already.'

As grateful as they were, wouldn't it be appropriate to show appreciation with some gesture? Although he was worried about not receiving a reward, there was no need for concern. Rescuing the princess was a favor that the elves would have to repay for a lifetime.

"Kkae-eeng!"

At that moment, the last remaining werewolf died, and the situation was concluded.

"Phew, they're all dead..."
ChatGPT

"Hey, look over there. Black Scythe is talking to the elves."

Players who had thwarted the ambush began to observe Ryumin, who was belatedly engaging in conversation with the elves.

"Is that so? But aren't those corpses over there not players?"

"What happened here?"

"Did the elves kill them?"

"Yes, that's right. I saw it earlier! That elf suddenly slashed their necks with a sword!"

Upon witnessing this, Yggrito sighed softly.

"Phew, if we stay quiet, misunderstandings will only grow. Considering the situation, may I explain what happened?"

"Sure."

As soon as Ryumin gave permission, Yggrito stepped forward.

"Warriors from another world. Many of you might be curious about what exactly has happened here."

His voice was transmitted to the players' ears through the spirit of the wind.

"First, let me introduce myself properly. I am Yggrito, the commander of the Elsorium Knights. And those here are not merchants or mages but knights of Elsorium."

As he clarified that they were not merchants, the players started to murmur.

"We weren't moving to transport goods. The status of being merchants was just a smokescreen to escort the princess. It's a brief deception, and we apologize. We can't disclose the details, but please understand that we're telling the truth."

The elves did not want to harm their relationship with humans. That was the reason why the commander personally clarified the misunderstanding.

'Whether it's a created setting in this world or an actual setting, I don't know.'

Yggrito continued speaking.

"Unfortunately, amidst the monster attack, there was a group aiming for our princess. The dead humans here are those assassins. According to the Black Scythe here, they were betrayers."

"Betrayers?"

"Oh? There really were betrayers!"

Upon checking the headcount, it was revealed that the number of betrayers had decreased to one.

No one would have thought that the sole betrayer would be Ryumin.
ChatGPT

"I won't ask why there are betrayers among you. Judging by your reactions, it seems like you are all confused. Anyway, if it weren't for Black Scythe, our princess might not have been safe. I would like to express our gratitude once again to Black Scythe."

'No, please stop thanking me.'

Finally, from Yggrito, who was bowing his head to Ryumin, the words he wanted to hear came out.

"Black Scythe, I have a gift for you."

Yggrito extended something from within his embrace.

A smile finally appeared on Ryumin's face as he casually accepted it.

[Received 'Potion of Ultimate Regeneration' as a reward from Elsorium's Knight Commander Yggrito.] [Potion of Ultimate Regeneration]

Category: Consumable

Grade: Legendary

Effect: Body regeneration for 10 seconds

Usage Restriction: Master rank and above

Description: Instantly regenerates even if the body is torn apart for 10 seconds. However, it does not take responsibility for mental collapse due to pain.

'Finally got it, Potion of Ultimate Regeneration.'

As the description suggests, it's a potion that essentially makes you invincible for 10 seconds.

'If I use it at the right time, I can resurrect even if I die dozens of times.'

Truly a way to extend one's life.

As it had to be used in Round 15, he placed it carefully in his inventory.

"To willingly give such a precious thing. Thank you."

"Is there anything more precious than the princess's life in this world? We elves also received an immeasurable favor from Black Scythe, much like the princess."

[The Elf's reputation for Black Scythe has risen from 'Neutral' to 'Friendly.']

Ryumin grinned at the reputation change message that suddenly appeared.

"Anyway, thank you."

"Thanking is something we should do."

At that moment, a rookie knight who had been waiting in front of the carriage approached Yggrito.

"Jerif. How is the princess?"

"She was surprised, but she's much better now. Moreover, after explaining the situation to the princess, she wishes to personally thank the benefactor."

"The princess? Alright. Black Scythe, this way."

Approaching Yggrito and the carriage, Yufinelcia seemed to be waiting as she got off the carriage.

However, as soon as she descended, strong reactions erupted from the surroundings.

"Wow!"

"Whoa, seriously?"

"What the..."

Simply put, her beauty was enough to make others say, 'Go away, angel.'

"Hello. Warrior from another world. I am Yufinelcia of Elsorium."
ChatGPT

"Call me Black Scythe."

Ryumin also spoke informally to the princess.

However, neither the princess nor the elves seemed to be offended at all.

'Now that the reputation has changed to friendly, I can do anything without causing any issues.'

As long as he didn't betray them, he could live receiving treatment from the elves for the rest of his life.

"I heard that you saved me. Truly, I don't know how to repay this favor..."

"You don't have to repay. It was just the right thing to do."

Elves like the words "duty" and "justice."

Ryumin intentionally said such words to build rapport.

'To leave a proper impression on the elves who strictly follow rules would be beneficial in many ways.'

Sure enough, the looks from Yggrito and the knights towards Ryumin subtly changed.

Even if he was a lifelong benefactor, humans were still humans.

However, with his current statement, the boundary drawn as 'human' became somewhat blurred.

'I just need to gradually increase their friendliness here. Especially if I can gain favor with the princess, it would be perfect.'

Knowing what the elven princess liked made things easier.

"Princess, please stay inside. I will guard outside the carriage. Even if it costs my life."

"Oh, um, thank you."

Instead of feeling burdened by the statement of sacrificing his life, Yufinelcia, blushing, hurriedly entered the carriage.

With a faint smile on her lips.

Approaching with surprised eyes, Yggrito spoke to Ryumin.

"I've never seen the princess smile like that before."

"Is that so?"

"It seems she feels reassured by the fact that Black Scythe is protecting her."

"If that's the case, I'm relieved."

As if to say not to worry, Ryumin reassured Yggrito.

"As long as you focus on moving to the destination, I'll take care of everything outside."

"In that case, we are grateful."

Yggrito, with a relieved smile, led the formation forward, and the battle continued.

"Kieeek!"

"Kyaah!"

Monsters continued to attack the elves and humans, and Ryumin accumulated experience points with his scythe every time.

During the thirty rounds of waves, the monsters never once approached the princess.
ChatGPT

"Because of the formidable wall called Black Scythe."

Impressed by this reliable figure, Yggrito approached and expressed his respect.

"I knew Black Scythe wasn't an ordinary person, but I never thought you were this strong."

"Is that so?"

"Thanks to you, we were able to safely escort the princess. Thank you."

As Yggrito expressed his gratitude, a hint of regret appeared on his face.

It was time to part ways with the benefactor.

Yufinelcia, seemingly aware of this fact, leaned her head out of the carriage.

"Um... Black Scythe."

"Why? Do you have something to say?"

"Well... no."

For some reason, the princess, who had buried her head, popped her face out again.

"Um, we'll meet again someday, right?"

Ryumin said nonchalantly, "Sure. Until then, don't forget me."

"..."

For a moment, Yufinelcia, with a blank expression, didn't respond and quickly went back inside.

'She seems embarrassed.'

Surprisingly, the elven princess liked awkward lines.

Finally, the time came.

[Arrival Time at Destination: 00:00:00]

As it reached 0 seconds, Yggrito brought the carriage to a halt and bid farewell sharply.

"To the warriors from another world, thank you. We won't forget the favor you've done for us in escorting us to our destination. I hope to see you again with smiling faces next time."

Clatter, clatter.

The carriage procession started moving, and Yggrito gave Ryumin a parting glance.

Yufinelcia, who opened the carriage window, also looked at Ryumin's receding figure with a shy girl-like expression.

[Successfully escorted the Elven Upper Tier to the destination.] [Completed the quest to escort the Elven Upper Tier.] [Experience points will be given as a reward for successful escort shortly.] [The amount of experience given is twice that of the monsters hunted by oneself and party members.]

As it concluded, the experience point reward came in.

'Reached level 78.'

A satisfactory level.

Above all, having built a good reputation with the elves and obtaining the potion he desired made it all the more perfect.

As the time to part ways approached, Huh Taeseok beside him wore a regretful expression.

"Black Scythe, it's a shame we have to part ways now."
ChatGPT

"Too bad. We'll meet again next time."

"Ah."

Those words seemed to touch Huh Taeseok again, and his expression once more became enamored with something.

"Um, can I see you again?"

When Um Jun-seok, who was standing next to them, hesitantly spoke, Ryumin nodded.

With just that, the guy expressed his joy openly, revealing a sense of becoming not just a potential follower but a complete one.

"Now, shall I go to the Human Upper Tier?"

Ryumin's figure disappeared.

Only the last Upper Tier remained.

Not one to be protected, but the Upper Tier that needed to be destroyed.
