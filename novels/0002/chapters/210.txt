Title: The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 210

Stop it!

"Uhh..."

Makyeongsu, who had fainted, opened his eyes.

It wasn't a parking lot, as it seemed pitch dark.

"Oh, what's this smell?"

Even the scent was entirely different from before.

A nauseating smell, as if there were garbage around, wafted up.

Gagging-

"What's going on?"

Not only that, but his hands and feet were bound.

From the sound and touch, it seemed like iron chains.

It felt like he had been kidnapped and tied to a chair.

"That bastard did this."

Makyeongsu naturally recalled the ambush he received in the parking lot.

The one who had struck him with a shield, hitting his face, was likely the culprit.

"I need to get out of here quickly."

It was at that moment, as he blinked to adjust to the darkness.

"Are you awake? Kyungsoo?"

"Hyung, Kyung Sang?"

A voice was heard right next to him.

The end of the blackout revealed Makyeongsang, tied to a chair like himself.

"Just like me, he's bound with iron chains to a metal chair."

"Hyung, have you been captured too?"

"Yeah."

"Damn, no matter who the lunatic is who kidnapped us, he's an idiot. Did he think we couldn't escape from this?"

It seemed like they were prepared to kidnap a player with these iron chains, but they underestimated the warrior class that Makyeongsu belonged to.

"Ugh!"

However, with his hands tied behind him and the chains meticulously layered, he couldn't exert his strength properly.

"Don't waste your strength. I tried, and it was useless."

Hearing the weakening sound, Makyeongsu's anger surged.

"Ah, hyung! Why are you talking nonsense in this situation? You should do something!"

"Hey, hey! Be quiet. What if the kidnapper comes in...?"

"Let him come in! Damn it, let's see his face!"

As if demanding to be heard, he shouted, and indeed, the door to the warehouse opened.

Creak-

Both expected a villain with a shield to enter, but the person who walked in was unexpectedly different.

No, it was someone they had subtly considered.

"Makyeongrok...?"

They couldn't believe it, but the culprit was Makyeongrok.

The proof was the sly smile on his face.
ChatGPT

The person who came to rescue them had a completely unfamiliar face.

"As expected, I knew it was that guy."

Even in the accusing gaze of the brothers, Makyeongrok remained nonchalant, just smirking.

"Isn't this strange? Did my manners slip away? Speaking informally to my older brother as soon as I see him. Do I need to show you my organs while still fresh from the body to get you to come to your senses?"

"Damn it, Makyeongrok, you psycho. Do you want your brother to treat you well in this situation?"

"Kyungrok, please. Let us go. Quickly."

Unlike the confrontational Makyeongsu, Makyeongsang appealed for their release with a pitiful look.

"Hmm, I was thinking of letting you go seeing what you guys are up to. I guess I'll only release Kyungsang then."

"Release me too, you son of a bitch!"

"Our youngest brother needs to learn some manners toward his older brother again."

Makyeongrok chuckled and aimed his sword.

"Clear away one arm."

A creepy aura emanated from the sword as it flowed like a snake towards Makyeongsu.

"W-what is this? Go away! Ahh! Oh, it hurts!"

A dark aura attached to Makyeongsu's arm began tearing away at his flesh.

"Ahh! It hurts! Aaah!"

His arm, bitten by the dark aura like an apple devoured by insects, became mangled.

Makyeongsu, torn to the point where his bones were exposed, finally fainted.

Makyeongsang, witnessing this right next to him, was shaking like a bamboo in the wind.

"Wake up, Kyungsuya."

"...."

"I said wake up."

When Makyeongrok approached and slapped him, Makyeongsu finally regained consciousness.

"When did I say to take a nap?"

"Ugh...."

"No answer?"

At the sound of the chilling voice, Makyeongsu lowered his head and mumbled.

"S-sorry. Hyung...."

It wasn't that he was pretending to be unconscious, but he didn't have the strength to respond.

He didn't even have the courage to look directly at the situation.

"You idiot. Why bother coming out so dignified like this? You're already a cripple with just one useless arm. Anyway, I'll kill you, so it doesn't matter."

At the mention of killing, the brothers shuddered involuntarily.

"P-please spare us, hyung..."

"Please, spare us..."

"What's with the pitiful act? Do you really want to live with that pathetic appearance? But what should I do?"

Makyeongrok sneered with a cynical smile.

"It's like spilled water."

"No, not yet. It's not over yet, hyung. I can make amends."

"Yeah, right. If you spare us, we won't go around causing trouble. We won't even think about inheriting your position."

"Hehehehe."

Makyeongrok couldn't hold back his laughter for a while.

"You guys find it amusing, huh? It's natural for the eldest son to take over the company. Why harbor ambitions for the successor's position? Just because you eat at the same table doesn't mean you get to claim someone else's plate. People need to know their place, tsk."

"I'm sorry. I won't do that anymore."

"Just forgive us once, Kyungrok hyung..."

"Aspiring for a position without any capability. If you're not satisfied, be born as the eldest son. How dare you guys crawl up to your elder? Do I look like a joke when I stay quiet? Huh?"

Although he spoke with anger, Makyeongrok's expression remained quite calm.

It was as if he deliberately showed anger for the sake of righteousness.

Seeing this, Makyeongsang felt a shiver down his spine.

'That's it! It's another side of Kyungrok hyung that I've seen...!'

There were times when he showed a chilling expression, and this was one of those moments.

The timing was perfect for him to beg with both hands and feet.

"I'm sorry! Kyungrok hyung! I was wrong!"

"Tell me honestly. Were you planning to kill me?"

"I-I beg you! Spare me! It wasn't me, it was Kyungsu! Kyungsu was planning it!"

"What?"

Makyeongsu gave a meaningful look, but Makyeongsang saw nothing.

He was just busy trying to save his own life.

"Tell me exactly what the plan was. If you want to survive tonight."

"W-well, that is..."

Terrified, Makyeongsang spilled out the plans he and Makyeongsu had concocted.

At that moment, a smirk appeared on Makyeongrok's lips.

"So, you thought of winning against me in a duel?"

"W-well, that's right. We didn't plan to kill you, really."

"Is that so?"

"Absolutely, really! Would I lie in this situation?"

"You're talking nonsense, you son of a bitch."

Makyeongsu, who was beside them, stifled a laugh.

"Kyungrok hyung, don't believe his words. He's lying to avoid the situation."

"What are you saying, Makyeongsu! I'm not lying!"

"You were planning to kill me if I didn't accept the duel. It was agreed upon by Kyungsang hyung as well."

"W-what are you talking about now? I distinctly remember being against it..."

"Opposition, my ass. You were even asking when we'd have the strategy meeting for tomorrow."

"Hey, Makyeongsu! Do you really want to die?"

Makyeongsang's eyes, shouting this, conveyed why he was provoking Makyeongrok with the truth.

Why reveal the truth and disturb the hornet's nest?

Reading that gaze, Makyeongsu sneered as if he found it pathetic.

"Who betrayed first? It can't be just me dying. You son of a bitch."

"This crazy bastard...!"

"Poo, puhahaha!"

At the sudden laughter, the fighting brothers turned their heads as if they had made an agreement.

"Oh, sorry. Did I interrupt? Go on. My dear brothers. I find your fight amusing. Show me more."

As Makyeongrok openly mocked them, the brothers maintained their silence, not out of loss of interest, but due to their genuine unwillingness to comply with Makyeongrok's words.

"Why stop fighting? Figure out who's at fault between the two of you."

"...."

"Boring. Both of you blaming each other, claiming who's right or wrong among similar bastards was quite amusing."

Although he openly mocked, the brothers did not utter a word.

They knew that the one holding the knife was Makyeongrok.

"It seems like the flow is disrupted. Should I lay down some rules?"

Makyeongrok swung the sword with the Dark Ora surrounding it.

Swoosh! Swoosh!

The brothers were startled by the sudden attack, but their eyes widened in surprise as they saw the chains on their arms and legs break.

"Now, it's easier to move, right?"

"Why...?"

"Why did I release you? Because I want to see more of my brothers fighting. Just for that."

With a sly smile, Makyeongrok continued, "Now, the one who wins the fight will be released from here."

"For us... to fight?"

"Yeah. But not some duel; you have to fight for real. Put your lives on the line. You have to completely cut off the other's life for me to acknowledge it."

"What?"

In other words, it meant fighting each other to the death.
ChatGPT

"The survivor, I'll take responsibility for and let go. Promise."

"Is, is that for real? Kyungrok hyung?"

"Or would you rather both die by my hand?"

As Makyeongrok raised his sword, the Dark Ora around the blade swirled.

Makyeongrok effortlessly cut through the chains like tofu.

It was evident that the power balance was not in favor of a 2-on-1 situation, even with Makyeongsu's and Makyeongsang's surprise attack.

'Even if it's us, 2 against 1 would be challenging...'

Makyeongsang had briefly thought that a surprise attack with Makyeongsu might have a chance, but seeing the weakened Makyeongsu made him reconsider.

"What will you do? Will you die? Or do you want at least one person to survive?"

"I, I'll do it. Let's fight among ourselves... kkuh!"

Suddenly, blood spurted from Makyeongsang's mouth.

In an instant, Makyeongsu had used a dagger to cut Makyeongsang's throat.

Thud-

Even though he died with wide-open eyes, Makyeongsu paid no attention to his deceased brother.

"Alright? Kyungrok hyung! Since I won, you'll let us live, right?"

Killing Makyeongsang by surprise.

Makyeongrok chuckled as if acknowledging Makyeongsu's victory.

"Alright, alright. Okay. Our youngest passes. A promise is a promise."

"T-then, can we go?"

"Yeah. But..."

Clang- Click-

As Makyeongsu opened the entrance door, he stopped when he saw An Sangcheol waiting outside, possibly worried that Makyeongsu might change his mind.

"I said I'll let him go. I never said anything about sparing him."

"What, what are you saying?"

"Director An."

"Yes, sir."

"Prevent that guy from leaving. I'll personally deal with killing him."

"Understood."

An Sangcheol, holding a shield, activated a Knight's Protection skill, blocking the passage.

Not only did he protect the party, but he also served as an impenetrable wall.

"You son of a bitch! You!"

The assassin, Makyeongsu, immediately used invisibility.

Although he intended to escape through the darkness, it was meaningless as long as he triggered the detection skill.

Thud-!

"Ugh!"

Struck by the shield bash skill, Makyeongsu's invisibility was dispelled, and he rolled three times on the ground.

With insufficient skills and one arm on the brink of necrosis, he was disadvantaged in every way.

However, he gathered all his strength and stood up.

'If I stop here, I'll die.'
ChatGPT

Surely, I will survive to expose Makyeongrok's atrocities to the whole world, even if it means going to prison.

With that determination, Makyeongsu attempted to escape again, but the pursuer wasn't just An Sangcheol.

"Where do you think you're going?"

Dark Ora, pursued by Makyeongrok, suddenly caught Makyeongsu's ankle.

Though Makyeongsu tried to get up immediately after tumbling on the ground, it was in vain.

Thunk-!

His knee was severed before he could stand up.

"Kkuhaaaack!"

"Now you can't escape, can you?"

"P-please spare me! Hyung! No, Master! Makyeongrok Master! Please spare me. What do you gain by killing a lowlife like me? If you let me go now, I'll quietly live abroad like a mouse. Master, we're family. Family! Let Master handle the succession. So please..."

"Did someone install a motor in your mouth? You show your true colors when facing death."

"Ah."

In the mocking smile of Makyeongrok, Makyeongsu saw it.

The chilling gaze that Makyeongsang had mentioned.

And he realized.

'This, this hyung is serious.'

That no matter how much he pleaded, there was no intention of sparing him.

That he genuinely enjoyed Makyeongsu's suffering.

"Is, is anyone there? Please save me! Please, spare me!"

"Screaming is useless. No one is here."

Smiling, Makyeongrok cut off the opposite leg.

Squelch-!

"Kkuhaaaaack!"

"So, this is my favorite place. There's no better place to deal with criminals."

"C-criminals?"

"And now, in front of me, there's another criminal."

Makyeongrok smiled and summoned the Dark Ora.

Indeed, it was better to leave the conclusion to the Dark Ora.

"Eat him up."

"No, please! Noooooo!"

As the Dark Ora tore into his younger brother, it happened when a third party's voice abruptly intervened.

"Stop!"

Makyeongrok's head turned abruptly at the unexpected third party.

And he saw it.

"Kristin?"

The approaching figures of his fiancÃ©e, Kristin, and Seo Arin.
