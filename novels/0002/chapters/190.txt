Title: "The 100th Regression of a Max Level Player - Episode 190"

Special Shop

The first person Ryu Min greeted upon waking up from his sleep was none other than his younger brother.

"Hyung, you're back! I was worried!"

"No need to worry. This round just took a bit longer, that's all."

Actually, this was a bit of an understatement.

There would be even longer rounds in the future.

"Now you don't have to wait with such anxious eyes. We don't even know when I'll wake up."

"But I can't help worrying...."

"Just make sure I'm breathing. That should mean everything is fine."

"Got it."

Although worried, Ryu Won couldn't help but accept his brother's words.

Tak-

As Ryu Min entered the room, he smirked.

'If he knew my true identity, he wouldn't worry like this.'

Well, worrying is only natural.

After all, he was not the Black Scythe right now but a weak and feeble prophet.

'Well, then, shall we take a look at the Special Shop?'

Ryu Min, lying on the bed, opened the shop window.

Upon doing so, a new button for the Special Shop appeared.

Touching it led to a new shop window.

Various types of equipment, from weapons to rings, were displayed.

These were items of a different level than those in the regular shop.

'In the regular shop, you could only get up to epic items if you were good, but...'

The Special Shop was different.

'Epics are basic, and if you have the money, you can even buy uniques.'

The difference was that you could only buy them with points, not gold.

And the points required were astronomical.

Just looking at the expert-level unique equipment now would cost 100,000 points.

'Most players, well, they'd be done with just buying one unique.'

Still, where else could you buy equipment that could only be obtained through combinations?

And not just equipment?

In the Special Shop, they also sold combination materials.

Even though they weren't god-tier grade materials.

'But they are legendary materials. Anyone can make them if they know the recipe.'

However, the points were absurd.

It cost 100,000 points for just one material.

To make one legendary item, you would need to spend at least 500,000 points.

'One material is the price of a unique equipment. I can't even think about buying it.'
ChatGPT

Perhaps most people would find it strange that certain materials are so expensive.

Once you know they are legendary materials, your perspective will likely change.

'It's not just the materials. The Special Shop has everything, from various potions and items to experience packs. There's nothing missing.'

Especially noteworthy is the experience pack.

It's an item that immediately increases your experience points, and you can purchase as much as you want with points.

'If you think of it as converting points into experience, it's quite simple.'

If Ryu Min wanted to, he could reach level 99 with these experience packs alone.

However, it would require a hefty sum of 5 million points, but even then, he would still have 15 million left.

It means he could achieve the maximum level immediately.

But Ryu Min had no intention of doing so.

'I don't need to do that.'

Having already become strong enough to tell level 99 to go away, thanks to the stats obtained from the Devil's Blessing.

With various buffs on top of that, reaching level 100 is just a small step.

'In such a situation, there's no need to hastily reach level 100 for attention.'

On the contrary, it's better not to do it as a precaution for unforeseen circumstances.

When reaching level 99, all health is restored, and a temporary invincibility effect occurs.

'To take advantage of that effect, it's better to delay reaching level 100.'

The time will come someday.

The time when the invincibility effect of reaching level 100 is needed.

Until then, he had decided not to intentionally reach it.

'Other players are likely the same. Delaying the use of points, like me, is better than buying items.'

Of course, considering the Special Shop is open, and the points cannot be collected any further, the desire to spend them is understandable.

However, there's something the angel didn't mention.

'Points can also be traded.'

Using the trading function, points can also be given to others.

If points, categorized as a currency higher than gold and in short supply, could be traded?

'Calling it valuable is probably an understatement.'

The reason not to spend points was here.

If kept unused, the value would likely rise naturally, much like Bitcoin.

Of course, Ryu Min, who had more than enough points to last a lifetime, didn't need to worry about that.

'For now, should I try making legendary equipment?'
ChatGPT

Having purchased legendary materials from the Special Shop, Ryu Min immediately proceeded to combine the items.

He created legendary-grade shoes, a necklace, and a ring. He also made another Ring of Extreme Resistance, as he could equip two with the Rune of Expansion.

'Even if I tried everything, it only cost 2 million points in material values.'

For an average player, it would be an unimaginable price, but for Ryu Min, it didn't even catch his attention.

'How about trying to make a God-grade item this time?'

The materials were already prepared.

It would be finished with just the combination.

[Main Material]

-High-quality Leather Gloves

[Sub-materials]

-Concentrated Ether

-Black Iron Powder

-Bubbling Magical Solution

-Glistening Horse Tail

-Divine Material Leather

These were the materials needed to make gloves.

Upon pressing the combination button, the item was created.
ChatGPT

[Combining a God-grade item.] [It will be transformed into an item suitable for the current profession.] [Combination Successful!] [You have created 'Gauntlets of Thanatos.'] [Gauntlets of Thanatos]

-Classification: Gloves

-Grade: God

-4 Set Effect: ????

-5 Set Effect: ????

Upon creating the God-grade gloves, the 3 Set Effect was activated.

It was a good effect that increased skill damage.

'My goal was to secure three God-grade items by Round 15, and I finally achieved it.'

It was much faster than planned, perhaps due to defeating the Archangel.

By wearing the Gauntlets of Thanatos, he also gained a useful skill.

[Temporary Skill â€“ Grip of Death]

-Effect: Can pull or push the opponent with strong telekinetic force. The range is 30m. Depending on the opponent's resistance, they may resist the telekinetic force.

'With this, I can pull down even flying angels.'

The advantage was that it was a skill with no cooldown, allowing unlimited use.

However, it had the drawback of needing to stretch out the hand and could be resisted depending on the opponent.

'Now, there's only one thing left to do with the remaining points.'

To reach level 99.

But now is not the time.

'I should reach level 99 when the invincibility effect is needed.'

With that expectation for the future, he went to sleep.

He woke up soon after due to Jeffrey's call.

"What's going on?"

-Hello, Ryu Min. I have something to report.

Jeffrey had received orders from Yanti.

To serve Ryu Min like a master and report any incidents immediately.

The reason he treated Ryu Min so respectfully was because of this.

"Alright, go ahead."

-Soon, Kristin will go to Korea to meet Ryu Min.

"Me? Why?"
ChatGPT
She wants to know the location of the Black Scythe through divination. It seems she wants to meet directly with her father and also obtain clues about the warlock.

Come to think of it, Kristin seemed to have a liking for him.

She even showed a persistent attitude, saying she would follow him from the other world.

'Is she really just trying to meet for a plea? It's not like there's another motive?'

I don't understand why Seo Arin and Kristin are so eager to meet the Black Scythe in both the other world and reality.

Meeting him wouldn't change anything.

"Alright, stop it. It's not good if I'm caught having a conversation with you."

-Yes. I'll end it here then...

After the call ended, Ryu Min closed his eyes again.

Honestly, it was a problem with no need for consideration.

'Meet the Black Scythe in reality? It won't happen. Not now, not in the future.'

It's much more beneficial to leave a debt rather than meeting and getting repayment to make the other person an ally.

Leaving a sense of indebtedness allows you to receive help at any time.

'As for the Black Scythe, pretend not to know. Same goes for the warlock.'

He has to deal with them in the 12th round himself.

He can't give information to Kristin.

'Besides, soon the organization called Messiah will be founded, and there's a high chance that the warlock will become a member.'

To establish a connection with the international organization Messiah, it is necessary to keep the warlock alive.

The problem will be solved if he acts like he knows nothing about the Black Scythe and the warlock.

What can he do if he can't see the future?

Anyway, the prophet Ryu Min holds the leash.

'Instead, I should throw in information about the 12th round.'

If he does that, Kristin will be satisfied and leave.

Thinking that way, his phone vibrated just in time.

Seeing the caller, it was Ma Kyung Rok.

"Yes, President. Oh, really? I understand. Let's meet then."

He had something to say, suggesting meeting with Kristin.

As expected.

However, Ryu Min's expression after ending the call was not good.

'Sleeping is in trouble.'

Suddenly, sleep had completely escaped him.

It had been 12 hours since returning from the other world, but John Delgado had not gotten out of bed.

No, he couldn't get up.

The memories from the other world, where his limbs were severed, were vividly imprinted.

'Is my arm and leg still intact?'
ChatGPT

Lying down and wiggling his fingers and toes, he finds that they move well.

However, the courage to get up doesn't come.

It feels awkward, and it doesn't feel real.

His limbs are intact.

Nevertheless, he can't lie down forever, so he forces himself to get up.

"Ugh...."

There was no pain, but he felt as if he could sense pain.

Slowly, as if undergoing rehabilitation therapy, he started to walk.

While walking through the living room, he recalls the one who put him in this situation.

'The Black Scythe.'

He is engulfed in an impulse to kill that damn bastard.

But John Delgado is a reasonably rational man.

He knows well that he can't kill him with his own strength alone.

Also, revenge is a luxury in this situation.

'Revenge is pointless. I should end it here and be satisfied.'

Although he couldn't kill the Holy Maiden, he achieved his goal by killing her followers.

Now, with the competing factions dismantled, all that's left is to increase the despair cult.

'If I build up power, an opportunity might arise. An opportunity to tear apart that damn bastard's face.'

Thinking like that, John suddenly let out a self-deprecating laugh.

A moment ago, he said revenge was a luxury, and now he's having thoughts like this.

'Hah... even if I'm frustrated, I have to give up. What else can I do?'

At that moment, ding-dong.

Thinking it might be a delivery or something, he opened the door.

But to his surprise, there was a man in a suit wearing sunglasses.

"Who are you?"

"Is this Warlock John Delgado?"

In an instant, John put on his equipment.

"Who are you? How did you find my house?"

When John aimed his staff at the man with a stern gaze, the man raised his hand as if to calm him.

"Hey, I'm not here to fight."

"Then why did you come?"

"I just came to hand you a business card."

The man actually took out only a business card from his pocket.

Upon receiving it, it had the organization's name and a nickname written on it.

"Affiliated with Messiah? Spaniard?"

"I didn't come here to fight this time. I just came to give you a business card."

The man took out the business card within the folds of his coat.

"12 Apostles?"
ChatGPT

"The leadership is composed of high-rankers who have reached the strongest positions in each country. The reason we approached you, Mr. John Delgado, who can be considered the best in the United States, is because of this."

"So, you're telling me to join the leadership of this organization called Messiah?"

"Exactly. Are you interested, by any chance?"

John Delgado, who seemed to be contemplating for a moment at the words of the Spaniard, spoke up.

"Leaving everything aside, let me ask you one thing."

"Please speak."

"Is Black Scythe planning to join the position of the 12 Apostles?"

The Spaniard shook his head as if expressing regret.

"No."

"Why not? If it's the Black Scythe from Korea, he would be the top-ranker, the number one priority to recruit."

"That's true, but..."

With a pause, the Spaniard spoke in a quiet voice.

"From the beginning, our Messiah was created to counter the Black Scythe."

"Against the Black Scythe?"

As John looked at him with surprise, the Spaniard provided additional explanation.

"As Mr. John knows, the Black Scythe holds an unmatched position at level 90. For us, who are at best level 50, we can only follow him. We need to unite our strength, just like workers forming a labor union to resist the unfair exploitation of a company. We can't leave the Black Scythe, who may be both an ally and an enemy, to grow as is, can we?"

Sensing agreement in John's muttered response, the Spaniard felt it.

They had almost crossed over.

"How about it? Will you join our Messiah?"

"Join, you say?"

For John, who had been sharpening his resolve, this was an offer without hesitation.

"Of course, damn it."
