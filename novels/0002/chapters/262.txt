Title: "Chapter 262 of the 100th Regression of a Max Level Player"

Is This the Human Realm?

At that moment, a message popped up.

[The duration of the Reincarnation of the Messenger has ended.]

Simultaneously, a sub-quest message appeared.

[A hidden sub-quest has been discovered!]

└ First Round: Save the life of an ordinary person

└ Success leads to ▶ Rune of Yin and Yang reward

[You have completed the sub-quest!] [As a reward for the sub-quest, you have received the 'Rune of Yin and Yang'!] [The acquired rune is automatically engraved on the player's body!]

It seemed that saving the younger brother from the angel met the conditions.

'Originally, I planned to lure Little Drake into the city... But in the end, I brought the rewards of the sub-quest.'

From the Chain Rune to the Rune of Knight's Resurrection, and now the reward of the Rune of Yin and Yang.

He wanted to check them all right here, but now was not the time.

He needed to quickly return to the secluded island and prevent the combat angels that would appear one hour later.

'I need to hide the corpses of the Archangels. I don't have time to summon John Delgado.'

Ryumin moved Gabriel and Raphael's bodies.

Although riddled with holes, they were still corpses that he had taken care of in his own way.

To resurrect them as undead and receive rewards once again.

If he hadn't taken care of them, they would have disappeared like dust in the Moonlight Island combo without a trace.

Swoosh- Swoosh-

Digging the ground with his scythe, Ryumin buried the Archangel's body and left a mark that only he could recognize before walking towards his brother.

"Won-ah."

"Hyung..."

"There's a lot to say, but let's do it later. People on the island are in danger right now."

"Island?"

"I'll talk about the details after everything is over. For now, take this."

Ryumin handed him a card.

"Since it's dangerous, don't go home. Find a nearby motel to rest. Everything, including food, is calculated with that."

"Oh, okay. But I didn't bring my phone, how will you know where I am?"

"There's no need to tell. There's a way to track. I'll find you after the situation is over."

Saying that, Ryumin changed into the assassin's mask.

Nervously...
ChatGPT

Transformation into the grotesque Lost Yak drew an amazed look from his brother.

"It's hard to believe even when I see it. That you're the Black Scythe..."

"Sorry for deceiving you. I couldn't tell you because I thought you might be in danger if you got involved. But now, it seems meaningless."

The angels knew all about Ryumin's family ties, including his affection for his brother.

Otherwise, would he have resorted to such cunning tactics?

Ryumin let out a self-deprecating laugh and spread his wings behind him.

"For now, the fact that I'm the Black Scythe is a secret from others. Can you keep it safe?"

"Of course. It itches to spill, but..."

As Ryumin glared at him, Ryuwon chuckled nervously.

"Joke, just a joke."

"I need to go quickly because I'm busy. Get some rest for now."

With those words, he soared into the night sky and dashed away like a gust of wind.

Kwaaang-!

In the place where the roaring sound had passed, Ryuwon still gazed up with a fascinated expression.

The universe was divided into five dimensions: Divine Realm, Celestial Realm, Demon Realm, Human Realm, and Abyssal Realm.

The weakest race among them was undoubtedly humans in the Human Realm.

The strongest were the divine beings.

[They seem like a degenerate race without wings.]

Ironically, the race that despised humans the most were the Celestials, who people ironically called angels.

Despite their beautiful appearance, their hearts were filled with jealousy and selfishness.

[Humans, not even worth bugs. This time, we'll wipe them all out.] [Why are you so angry, Baruel?] [Why wouldn't I be?]

In response to his colleague's question, the top-ranked angel, Baruel, responded confidently.

[Originally, the 6th-class lackeys were supposed to handle this. But here we are, taking care of it while there's no time to rest due to training!] [Gabriel gave us special instructions. What can we do but follow them?] [If those human brats hadn't held out until the 16th round, we wouldn't have had our time stolen like this!]

Listening nearby, Demiel chuckled.

[Hey, Baruel. Be honest. Is this because you lost our bet?] [What? M-me! What are you talking about?] [Bet? What bet did you two have?]
ChatGPT

Curious glances from colleagues prompted Demiel to laugh and recount the past.

"We made a bet on how many humans would survive in the 15th round. I said there would be more than 100, and Baruel said fewer would survive. Well, you know the result, right? Hehe. More than 500 survived, a record-breaking number."

"So, Demiel, did you win the bet? What did you wager on?"

"For a month, Baruel agreed to stand in for all the night shifts I was supposed to cover."

"Really? Hahaha!"

"Baruel looks like he's about to explode. Hehehe."

"Hey, don't laugh, you brats!"

Baruel's face twisted in frustration. Not only did he lose the bet, but now he was also being teased by his colleagues.

"All because of those human brats."

Due to unexpectedly high human survival rates, he found himself in this embarrassing situation, receiving ridicule from his colleagues.

"I'll kill them. Insignificant human brats."

"Whoa, look at Baruel's expression."

"Did he really get that upset?"

"This is a chance to vent properly."

"Yeah, if not now, when would we get the chance?"

When celestial beings crossed over to the human realm, 90% of their power was depleted. This was due to a special barrier in place to prevent intrusion by other races—a measure taken by the creator god to protect humans who were inherently inferior.

Because of this, humans rarely had the opportunity to encounter beings from other realms. Angels were unwilling to incur substantial losses to visit a planet swarming with bugs.

However, there was a way to descend to the human realm without enduring the loss of power—when the system allowed it during the progression of rounds. During these rounds, beings could cross into the human realm without paying a price.

"If not now, when will we get the chance to kill them, right?"

"I'll leave my share to you, so try to kill them with enthusiasm."

"I'll pitch in too."

"Count me in."

"Have a solo showtime. Hehehe."

"Thanks a lot, you brats."

Baruel, growing angrier at his colleagues' teasing, gritted his teeth. Soon, the portal to the human realm would open, allowing them to descend without the constraints of their powers.
ChatGPT

[Oh, by the way, you know that assassination won't work on him, right?] [I know.]

He had no intention of killing him with an assassination anyway.

'These repulsive brats, like insects. I'll tear them limb from limb while they're still alive.'

Baruel was determined to kill every single one of them without leaving any behind.

The secluded island was filled with corpses—corpses of monsters.

"Is everyone okay?"

"We're fine!"

"Anyone injured around here? I can help with healing!"

"Not a scratch on anyone?!"

Fortunately, there were no humans among the piles of monster corpses.

Minjuri approached Kristin, who was breathing a sigh of relief.

"Miss Kristin, haven't you seen Black Scythe?"

"Black Scythe?"

"He suddenly disappeared...."

Kristin, now looking around, hadn't noticed Black Scythe amidst the chaos of healing.

She hadn't paid attention; he wasn't someone noteworthy enough.

"I don't know."

"Did you hear where he might be going?"

"Not at all."

Smiling, Minjuri counted the number of people again, including herself—575 in total.

Even after counting multiple times, there was one person missing.

'Where could he have gone?'

Minjuri didn't have much time to dwell on the question.

[Time left until the end of the round: 01:10:27]

In just ten minutes, the 5th summoning would begin.

Realizing the scarcity of time, she buffed the people.

Although now a familiar routine, the players still expressed gratitude to Minjuri.

"Thank you."

"Yes. Then..."

"Excuse me. Your nickname is Minjujue, right?"

At the call of the High Mage Alex, Minjuri widened her eyes and turned around.

"Yes, why?"

"If it's not too much trouble, could you stay by our side?"

"Huh? What do you mean...?"

"In my opinion, the two most important people among the players on this island are the priest over there...."

And he promptly pointed at Kristin.

"And you, the buffer."

"...."

"If these two fall, I believe our chances of winning are slim to none. So, we must protect you."

"You'll protect me?"
ChatGPT

"Yes. Protecting a supporter is a natural thing in party play, isn't it?"

Minjuri was a bit taken aback. It was the first time someone volunteered to protect her.

"I'm okay, so please, protect Kristin over there."

"That side is already filled up."

Beside Kristin, a woman with a bow, who had appeared unnoticed, stood like a guard.

"May I protect you?"

"W-Well, if you're willing. Thank you."

As soon as those words were uttered, Alex nodded and stood beside Minjuri.

While having someone follow her around like a bodyguard felt a bit uncomfortable, for Minjuri, it was a proposal with no downside.

The person didn't look suspicious, and it seemed like she had nothing to lose.

[5th Summoning] [576 players vs 1,152 Little Drakes] [6th Summoning starts in 30 minutes] [Time left until the end of the round: 00:59:59]

As the 5th summoning began, countless baby dragons appeared in the sky.

Though they were called baby dragons, the size of each one surpassed that of a car, making them impossible to ignore.

"It's started!"

"Everyone, focus!"

"Just follow the strategy!"

"Kyaaaaaao!"

"Kyaaaack!"

The drakes that covered the sky descended, all at once, sinking their teeth into the ground.

"Ranged attacks first, spread out!"

"Kill the ones getting close first!"

Despite the appearance of airborne monsters, people weren't bewildered.

That was because they had already learned the strategy from Black Scythe.

Splurt-!

Zap-zap-zap-!

Roar!

Thud-thud!

Various spells and arrows filled the air.

If they aimed for the wings with ranged attacks, the melee dealers on the ground finished them off.

"Fire attack incoming!"

"Dodge it!"

As flames sparked from the drake's mouth, players quickly moved away.

Thanks to their swiftness, there was no problem in avoiding the attack.

However, it didn't mean there was no damage at all.

"Oops, tsk tsk!"

"Come this way!"

Kristin unfolded a wide-area heal, cleanly treating the players' skin burns.

Empowered, players regained their strength and once again engaged in dragon hunting.

Was there something strange about their appearance?

"Kyaaaoooo!"
ChatGPT

One of the Drakes targeted Kristin and charged towards her.

However, its assassination attempt ended in failure.

Thud-thud!

"Kyaaack!"

Simultaneously, an arrow shot by Dorothy blinded the Drake's eyes.

"No way."

Dorothy scoffed, hitting the Drake's eye socket with another arrow.

With magically enhanced arrowheads, there was no shortage of penetration power to pierce through the brain.

Thanks to the seamless coordination of the people, it didn't take long for over a thousand Drakes to be killed.

"Haah, now we can take a break."

"This one was a bit tougher."

People sighed, sitting down to rest.

Fortunately, there were no casualties this time either.

However, no one could erase the worry from their faces.

They had heard from Black Scythe about who would appear in the final summoning.

"Combat angels are going to appear, right?"

"Yes, they said ten of them will appear."

"Now we have to face angels at the very least..."

"Can we win with our skills?"

"It should be possible. Black Scythe said he could handle them sufficiently."

But what people didn't know was what Rumin had mentioned he could handle—the 6th-grade angels.

[Is this the human realm?]

Just as the 6th summoning began, 1st-grade angel Baruel appeared, sharpening his scythe.
