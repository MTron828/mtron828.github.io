Chapter 1165: Shock

Even though Yan Xuehen was furious, she had too many doubts, and didn’t really know what to say. Instead, Yun Jianyue couldn't take it anymore and cried, “Brat, close your eyes!”

Zu An hadn’t noticed anything at first, but only now that he had been reminded did he notice the two women’s current state. He was stupefied. The women’s figures were graceful, lovely, and absolutely enchanting; more importantly, they were both well-known individuals in this world!

Yun Jianyue was someone who incited fear throughout the world, her prestige born of dominance. She was someone many parents used to make their children stop crying at night. There was even less need to talk about Yan Xuehen. She was a goddess in the eyes of many people, revered by countless individuals.

The two were both absolutely stunning, and yet no one dared to have such thoughts, or even discuss their appearance for that matter. That was because they were both just too powerful. They were almost like almighty deities that others could normally only look up to, not daring to have any blasphemous thoughts.

And yet, this side of the two women that no one else had seen was actually right in front of Zu An. Considering the huge disparity in status, who could resist such stimulation?

“You’re still staring?” Yun Jianyue snapped. She was still the Devil Sect’s master; her brows stood on end, killing intent surging within her. Even though she was seriously injured at that moment, her killing intent was still real.

“Um… If I don’t watch the way, I might fall back into the water,” Zu An subconsciously replied.

Yan Xuehen said with a sneer, “With your cultivation, you should be able to clearly sense the way even with your eyes closed. How could you possibly fall back into the water?”

With their knowledge, such a crude excuse was instantly exposed.

Zu An sighed and replied, “Since I can sense my surroundings even if I close my eyes,what difference is there whether I leave my eyes open or close them?”

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were speechless.

“Fine, fine, fine., I’ll just close my eyes.” Even after dancing on the brink of death like an absolute madman, Zu An still obeyed. He moved toward the shore, and after putting the two women down, he turned around and asked, “I have some clothes here; do you want any?”

When she saw him turn around, Yan Xuehen nodded inwardly. Even though this brat spoke rather frivolously, he actually had a gentlemanly side to him. Meanwhile, Yun Jianyue said in shock, “You actually have female clothes on you? Are you a pervert?”

Zu An was speechless. He could only say, “They’re all Chuyan’s clothes. I carry some for her in my storage pouch.” In truth, he didn’t only have Chuyan’s clothes; he had clothes from his other sweethearts too. But he wasn’t in a position to explain such a thing.

Yan Xuehen’s heart skipped a beat when she heard the name ‘Chuyan’. She began feeling vexed, thinking, He is my disciple’s man! Just what the hell have I been thinking recently?!

But she quickly concluded that she was probably still being affected by his sorcery. She felt even more annoyed when she realized that.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +109 +109 +109…

Zu An jumped in fright. He didn’t know how he had offended her. It seemed he shouldn’t have mentioned Chuyan’s name after all…

On the other hand, Yun Jianyue sneered. She asked, “Why do you only have that Chu Chuyan’s clothes? You don’t have any of our Honglei’s? You really don’t deserve that girl.”

Zu An said sulkily “When it comes to why I don’t have her clothes, does big sis sect master really have no idea?”

Only then did Yun Jianyue realize she had tried to break them up several times. Her expression became a bit awkward. Suddenly, she felt some doubts. Was her choice to break them up correct?

Even though Honglei might be able to cultivate the Heavenly Devil Temptation to an even higher level, if her man ended up being stolen by that Chu girl, she would still be the loser in the end…

If it were another girl, Yun Jianyue wouldn’t have cared at all. But Chuyan was Yan Xuehen’s disciple. If her disciple lost to Yan Xuehen’s disciple, wouldn’t that be like having lost herself, in a certain sense?

Yan Xuehen felt hesitant. At first, she had thought that Yun Jianyue was also affected by Zu An’s sorcery, but judging from their conversation just then, that didn’t seem to be the case.

Don’t tell me that after he used that witchcraft on me, I really ended up liking him without realizing it? She was stupefied when she thought of that possibility.

Yun Jianyue couldn't help but give Yan Xuehen a few more looks. She just felt that this old rival of hers was really acting a bit strange today. But she couldn't figure out what was going on, so she said to Zu An, “It’s really hard for us to change our clothes in our current state.”

Zu An was alarmed. As if she had seen through his thoughts, Yun Jianyue remarked, “What, you thought I would ask you to help us get dressed?”

Zu An almost choked on his own saliva. He spluttered, “Of course not! I was going to say that I could use my skills to dry your clothes.”

Yun Jianyue then nodded in satisfaction, saying, “That’s more like it. You can use the fire element, so it’s suitable for drying clothes.”

Yan Xuehen had seen Zu AN use fire and ice before. She once again sighed in amazement, thinking, This kid really is a ridiculous genius, someone any sect would fight over.

Maybe I should just make an exception and take him into our White Jade Sect. With his cultivation and aptitude, the other elders won’t have much to say either. I can see him more often too…

Her expression changed as soon as that thought emerged. She quickly warned herself that her cultivation technique focused on being free from emotions, so she definitely couldn't bring him back! That would greatly affect Chuyan’s future.

Meanwhile, Zu An’s palm was already pressing against Yan Xuehen’s back. Her entire body went rigid when she felt the heat from his palm.

In the past, she definitely wouldn’t have let another person place their hand in such a vital area. But now, she discovered that she wasn’t worried about him hurting her at all, even though she had clearly been after his life not too long before.

Zu An suddenly said, “Ma’ams, don’t worry; my eyes are closed.”

Yun Jianyue said jokingly, “If you dare to open your eyes halfway, I’ll definitely gouge them out after this is done.”

Zu An couldn't help but laugh. He replied, “Big sis sect master, you don’t seem to understand this current situation! You two can’t do a thing to retaliate right now. If you piss me off too much, aren’t you scared that I’ll do things to you, and then kill you afterwards?”

Yan Xuehen was horrified. Even though she didn’t care about her appearance, after so many years, she had sensed how much other people around her cared. She knew just what kind of appeal her appearance had to men. Even though Yun Jianyue had faced her for several years, she also had to admit that the demoness was also extremely beautiful.

Normally, no one would dare to do anything to them, but now, they were completely defenseless. Furthermore, their special status and appearance would only give a man even greater stimulation…

While Yan Xuehen was feeling restless, she heard Yun Jianyue reply with a sneer, “Would I have treated you as my friend if I didn’t know about your character? Would I have done all that when I heard you… Ahem, anyways. I know you’re not that kind of person.”

Zu An protested, “So honest people deserve to be bullied?”

Yun Jianyue giggled and said, “Alright, enough. Stop chattering already. That monster is still here, so help us dry our clothes first.”

Yan Xuehen remained silent. She had discovered that she knew far less about Zu An than Yun Jianyue did. That made her feel extremely unhappy. However, a warm feeling quickly spread through her entire body. The clothes on her body gradually began drying, emitting a cloud of steam.

She nodded. Even though Zu An’s grasp over the fire element was still a bit immature in the eyes of a grandmaster, it had already exceeded the understanding of many experts in this world. It wasn’t something someone of his age should have been able to achieve.DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Yan Xuehen’s expression stiffened when she realized that she had just praised him again inwardly. She quickly shifted her attention and asked, “What about Yu Yanluo? Why don’t I see her with you?”

Zu An smacked his head and cried, “Ah, I forgot about her while saving you two!”

Since the Scaled Deathworm was too powerful and Yu Yanluo was still recovering, he had made her wait in a safe place far away from him. But he still hadn’t looked for her after so much time. She was probably worried to death, right?

He suddenly turned around and said, “Your clothes are already pretty much dry. Rest here for a bit; I’ll be back after I get her.”

“Yu Yanluo, the capital’s number one beauty. Tsk tsk, you really are a cunning bastard, not even letting a Medusa go,” Yun Jianyue remarked. She naturally knew what had happened recently. She had been extremely unhappy to hear that the two of them were together.

Zu An’s forehead darkened and he asked, “Can you not describe me with such words, please?”

“What will we do if you leave? What if another one of those strange bugs comes? We’d be dead for sure.” Yun Jianyue said with a frown. Yan Xuehen gave her a look of astonishment. Why did she feel as if the other woman was acting jealous?

Still, what Yun Jianyue had said made sense. The terrifying bug had summoned more subordinates, showing that there were definitely many more of its kind in the mines. If the bugs made their way over, the two women would be done for.

Zu An used Blue Mallard to create an air bubble, then placed the two women inside, saying, “Those strange bugs move through the earth. You two should be safe in the water.”

He was about to leave when he suddenly thought of something. He took out a pill and said, “Sect Master Yan, this is the Ice Heart Pill you gave me. It should be useful for your injuries.” While he was talking, however, he suddenly saw Yun Jianyue’s jaw drop as she stared at Yan Xuehen.
