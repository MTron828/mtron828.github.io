Chapter 1698: Sisters

Chu Chuyan had spent the entire competition cultivating in seclusion in preparation for her battle against Qiu Honglei. Today, however, such a big commotion had broken out on Golden Peak. As she was wondering what happened, an enthusiastic disciple came up to her and explained the situation: Emptiness Isle’s Elder Peng was actually an imposter from the Devil Sect!

Chu Chuyan was extremely beautiful and had a refined and aloof temperament, making her quite popular among the daoist sects. As such, several people sought an opportunity to talk to her.

When she heard about the entire course of events, she was shocked. She hadn’t expected Qiu Honglei to have already been there for some time, and to have actually fought through many rounds of the Great Sects Competition, no less. Now that she knew what was happening on Golden Peak, she could no longer continue to cultivate and hurriedly rushed out, thus arriving just in time for the earlier scene. That was why she had taken the initiative to suggest the battle.

Qiu Honglei raised her brows when she saw Chuyan arrive. She immediately felt a competitive drive grow within her. She took a step forward and was about to agree to the proposal.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

However, Yun Jianyue blocked her path and said to Chu Chuyan, “Honglei has fought so many battles and defeated your fellow daoist disciples. If not for what happened today, she would have already been decided as the winner. If you want to fight against her, why don’t you face those daoist colleagues of yours and take first place first?”

Even though she was at odds with that stone cold woman, she understood Yan Xuehen’s ability. Her disciple definitely wasn’t weak either. Furthermore, Chu Chuyan’s talent was exceptional too, meaning that her cultivation was likely equal to Qiu Honglei’s. It was hard to say who would win if they really fought. She definitely didn’t want the situation to end in a coin flip.

Qiu Honglei was quite tired from everything that had happened recently, too. She had already fought many rounds, exposing many of her skills. In contrast, Chu Chuyan had been cultivating in seclusion, preparing for this battle the entire time. Even the slightest mistake would cost Qiu Honglei and her master a great deal.

Chu Chuyan frowned. She didn’t know what to say in response.

Guan Chouhai said, “Niece Chu, we appreciate your good intentions. However, eliminating the Devil Sect and defending justice is our generation’s responsibility. You only need to watch from the sidelines.”

His concerns were actually the opposite of Yun Jianyue’s. He had witnessed Qiu Honglei prevail over representative disciples again and again. Even the publicly acknowledged number one of the daoist sects’ younger generation, Wu Xiaofan, had lost to her. Even though Chu Chuyan’s cultivation was excellent, her prior performance hadn’t exceeded Wu Xiaofan’s. In his opinion, the chances of winning wouldn’t be in their favor if the two sides fought, so he didn’t feel like there was a need to take such a risk.

Yan Xuehen said, “Witch, Chuyan’s battle against your disciple has already been agreed upon between the daoist sects and the Devil Sect. Are these excuses you are producing a result of your fear?”

Guan Chouhai immediately felt conflicted when he heard the sweetheart of his dreams speak up. If he continued to insist otherwise, wouldn’t that make her unhappy?

Yun Jianyue’s beautiful eyes narrowed. She retorted, “Stone cold woman, why would I be scared?” Even though she knew that Yan Xuehen was taunting her, she still couldn't help but become a bit upset.

Master Jian Huang said, “This old one thinks that this is a good idea. There was already a battle scheduled to begin with, and there wouldn’t be any unfair controversies.” Meanwhile, he sent a ki transmission to Guan Chouhai, telling him to stop causing trouble.

Guan Chouhai understood the reasoning behind it, but he couldn't really swallow his resentment after having been publicly ridiculed by Yun Jianyue.

Li Changsheng said, “This daoist also approves of this competition. Niece Chu’s cultivation is not low, and I do not think that she is any weaker than the Devil Sect witch.” He was part of the White Jade Sect too, after all. When he spoke up, all the other daoists voiced their agreement.

The younger disciples had excited expressions. In a battle between the older generation, they wouldn’t even be able to learn much because the difference in level was too high. However, a fight between younger generation disciples was different. Even if they were stronger, it would still be within a reasonable degree. Watching powerful younger cultivators fight would bring extraordinary benefits to their own cultivation.

Furthermore, putting aside everything else, Chu Chuyan was extremely popular! If she fought against another beauty like Qiu Honglei, just watching such a battle would be a feast for the eyes.

Wan Tongtian harrumphed. “I don’t care who fights whom; I only care for the safety of our Jadefall Palace’s disciples. Witch, as long as you hand over niece Pei, I can choose not to make things difficult for you today.” Pei Mianman was his junior sister Huo Ling’s precious disciple. She represented Jadefall Palace’s future, so they definitely couldn't let anything happen to her.

Yun Jianyue said with a chuckle, “Don’t worry. There’s someone who cares about her even more than you, who will save her. There’s nothing for you to worry about.”

The onlookers thought she was talking about Elder Huo Ling. Only a few people actually knew that she was referring to Zu An.

Yun Jianyue was about to say something else when Qiu Honglei said, “Master, please let me fight. This is something we already decided on. I won’t disappoint you.”

When she saw the determination in her disciple’s eyes, Yun Jianyue knew that Qiu Honglei wanted to prove herself. After some hesitation, she didn’t refuse and said, “Fine. Your master believes that you’ll definitely get what you want!”

Qiu Honglei’s face heated up. Master really has a big mouth. What is Chu Chuyan going to think after hearing that?

Yan Xuehen had a weird expression. These young girls seem to be more courageous in their love. It really is enviable…

…

Surprisingly, Chu Chuyan was still completely calm. She slowly walked forward and said, “Little sister Qiu, if you would!”

Qiu Honglei had a lovely smile as she replied, “Miss Chu, you aren’t much older than me. You might even have to call me big sister.”

“We’ll know after this fight,” Chu Chuyan replied, her expression cold. She slowly raised her longsword.

Those present were confused. What was going on with these two women? Why were they fighting over who would be the big sister when this battle was related to such an important event?

Xie Daoyun knew the insider details, so she couldn't help but give Zu An a look. When she saw his serious expression, she thought that her big brother Zu was definitely really anxious. One was his wife, while the other was a girlfriend he was really close to. She started to feel a headache thinking about it.

A gust of wind blew past, and Qiu Honglei’s blades instantly left their scabbards. The two stood facing each other. A battle was on the verge of breaking out. There was no stage, nor were there any restrictions. As such, the disciples and the other sect members all retreated far away to avoid getting needlessly hurt.

Qiu Honglei said with a big smile, “This is the daoist sects’ territory, and I am a guest. How about I take the first move?”

Many people cursed this Devil Sect witch for being shameless, using words to try and seize the initiative. However, it was understandable too, because of the importance of the battle. They were worried that Chu Chuyan’s pride would keep her from handling the situation.

Fortunately, Chu Chuyan said, “Guests are chosen by the host. The Devil Sect’s witches all deserve punishment. Apologies!” Her longsword seemed to turn into an icicle and stabbed straight toward Qiu Honglei’s brow.

“What high-sounding words,” Qiu Honglei retorted with a sneer. With a twist of her waist, her entire body bent like a crescent moon, avoiding the deadly attack. At the same time, the two short blades shone with a vicious glint that resembled moonlight. They drew two strange arcs, one aimed at her opponent’s throat, the other right behind her.

…

The spectating disciples gasped. Even though the battles during the Great Sects Competition were intense, they had still maintained basic etiquette. They were rarely this ferocious right from the start. More importantly, this level of ferocity was coming from two delicate-looking beauties. As their figures darted around, they looked like goddesses who had descended into this mortal world. They were so stunning that many of the onlookers couldn't even take their eyes off the battlefield, causing them to overlook the killing intent concealed behind each move.

As the two went back and forth, each attack was aimed at the opponent’s vitals. Xie Daoyun’s eyes widened. Why were the women at big brother Zu’s side so terrifying in battle? For some reason, she felt her entire body turn a bit cold. She reflexively wrapped her arms around herself. Her expression was full of worry and helplessness.
