Chapter 1459: Absolute Social Suicide

Yan Xuehen and the other women cast Zu An sidelong glances. This guy really just can’t keep his mouth shut sometimes…

Even Zu An was prepared to run at any time to avoid Mo Xi suddenly turning on him.

To his surprise, however, Mo Xi simply looked at him and suddenly said, with a sweet smile, “Master~” Her voice was incredibly sweet, enough to make anyone’s body go numb.

Zu An finally understood why Mo Xi had become known as Chinese history’s first femme fatale. No wonder Xia Jie had doted on her so much until his entire country got done in. This really was an alluring woman through and through!

Yan Xuehen and the others hadn’t expected the sudden change either. They were all stupefied.

Yun Jianyue reacted the fastest. She harrumphed and said, “Another one who’s good at charm skills!”

Zu An also snapped out of his daze. He subconsciously reached out to stroke Mo Xi’s forehead, asking, “You’re not sick, right?”

Mo Xi evaded the physical contact gracefully. There was a faint smile on her face as she said, “I’ve received your spear as a present, and then you saved my life. It wouldn’t be too far for this one to serve you like a cow or horse in return, so what’s the big deal with calling you master?”

A cow or horse?

The three women immediately looked at him vigilantly.

Zu An thought, Do you really think I’d believe you? The last one who believed you is lying over there dead.

He coughed lightly and said, “Ahem, alright already. I’m not an old pervert like Xia Jie, so you don’t need to use this stuff on me. Don’t worry. I won’t touch you while you’re recovering.”

“Thank you, master,” Mo Xi said, looking at him with a big smile. “If master wants to do something strange to this body, you can wake me up. I’ll serve you properly.”

Yan Xuehen, Yu Yanluo, and even Yun Jianyue were speechless.

Zu An naturally knew that the woman was just lying, but he also knew that what she was most worried about was her safety while asleep, so he didn’t really mind. He said, “I don’t need you to work like a cow or horse. You just have to undo that Puppet Curse on me. I already did what I promised you, so you better not go back on your word.”

Mo Xi hesitated, but in the end, she still nodded in agreement, saying, “No problem. That’s but a trivial matter.”

From the memories of this body, this guy was still decent and treated her well. He was someone trustworthy. Either way, she would just use him for a period of time. Once she recovered, she could sever the soul contract with him at any time. However, the Puppet Curse would make things difficult for her too by putting her in danger. That was why she agreed to get rid of it.

Zu An was stunned. He hadn’t expected her to be so agreeable this time.

Seeing that she was willing to undo Zu An’s Puppet Curse, the three women also became happy. They didn’t bicker about how she had been trying to seduce Zu An. They saw a pair of shining scissors made of light condense in Mo Xi’s hands, snipping something in Zu An’s direction. It seemed as if something invisible had been cut with a loud crack.

…

Somewhere in the distance, the Fiend Emperor was suddenly stunned. His expression became a bit unpleasant.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince immediately asked, “Father emperor, what is wrong? Could it be that you sensed the Qiongqi’s aura?”

They had already found the place where the Qiongqi had been sealed by following Dan Zhu’s instructions. It was a rock cave. They had thought it would be small, and yet when they entered, they saw that it went on for a long time. Furthermore, it was even filled with many mechanisms and traps. If not for Wu Liang, who was proficient in such things, they might have already been injured.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince’s father had suddenly begun acting strange in such a place that was so fraught with danger, so how could he not become worried?

Wu Liang also became vigilant. His earlier experiences had taught him just how formidable the Four Perils were.

The Fiend Emperor shook his head slightly and replied, “No. Zu An’s Puppet Curse has been undone.”

“How is that possible?!” the Golden Crow Crown Prince cried out in alarm.

At the same time, even Wu Liang cried out. He also knew the Puppet Curse well. Furthermore, it had been set by the Fiend Emperor personally. Apart from the Fiend Emperor himself, no one, not even the human emperor Zhao Han, could necessarily undo it! How could Zu An have that ability?

The Fiend Emperor’s expression was ugly as he said, “It looks as if he had some kind of encounter in this place. We have to be a bit more careful the next time we meet him.”

He had been extremely proud when he first entered the Unknown Region, feeling that he could easily conquer this secret dungeon. He had encountered the Taowu, Taotie, and several other such foes in quick succession; however, even though they were powerful, they were still a bit weaker than him. That was why, despite some small setbacks, he still didn’t panic.

And yet, when the ten suns appeared in the sky, he had sensed several auras no weaker than his. His mood had become more grave then. Then, a golden light had descended from above, seizing his son’s Sun Slaying Bow. While he had been excited that a greater power existed, he was left quite shaken. After all, he and his son could really die here if they encountered an accident.

There was no way Zu An could undo the Puppet Curse by relying on his own power. He had definitely received the help of some powerful individual, or obtained a strong magical artifact…

However, the Fiend Emperor was an ambitious and ruthless character who had dominated a generation. He quickly calmed down. He had one last step to complete. As long as he undid the seal, he could obtain the immortal medicine, and he could even encounter a greater power. At that point, it would be useless no matter who Zu An had found.

“Continue forward. We have to find the Qiongqi as soon as possible!” he said with a resolute expression, heading into the depths of the mountain.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An clearly sensed the sleeping Golden Crow in his mind being cut to pieces by a pair of golden shears. He no longer felt the terrifying sense of pressure from it. He couldn't help but feel glad that he had encountered Mo Xi’s soul form. Otherwise, with only the valkyrie body he had obtained, there was no way the Puppet Curse could be cut.

“Alright, then I’ll be sleeping first,” Mo Xi said with a yawn. She was already injured, and cutting the Puppet Curse had made her use up even more strength.

“Wait,” Zu An called out to her. “I have another contract. Please help me cut that one too.”

Yun Jianyue and Yu Yanluo were stunned. What other contract did he need Mo Xi’s ability to remove?Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Only Yan Xuehen panicked. She naturally knew what Zu An was talking about. What she had previously yearned for day and night was to get rid of Zu An’s Love Is More Solid than Gold skill, and yet now that the moment arrived, she felt mysteriously alarmed. Not even she was sure whether she felt expectation or disappointment.

It’s definitely that damn skill messing with me. Of course I want to get rid of it! she thought as her reason won out in the end. She continued to talk to herself, strengthening her resolve.

Mo Xi closed her eyes. Because she had already reattached her contract with Zu An, she could sense his condition.

“Huh? Master, you have quite a few contracts with others, and they’re all with women? Which one should I cut?” she asked while searching.

“You have many contracts with women?” Yun Jianyue and Yu Yanluo repeated, perking up their ears.

Yan Xuehen was suspicious. This guy didn’t use Love Is More Solid than Gold on others, did he?

“It’s mine and… hers… Don’t cut the wrong one,” Zu An quickly replied, communicating with Mo Xi in his mind. He had soul contracts with Mi Li, Qiao Xueying, Daji, and several others. It would be a huge problem if she accidentally cut one of them.

“So it was her,” Mo Xi said. She giggled as she looked at Yan Xuehen, her expression strange.

However, she didn’t waste any time. The golden shears appeared in her hands again. Then, several red threads that connected Zu An to Yan Xuehen became visible. They were all tangled up.

Yun Jianyue and Yu Yanluo’s eyes immediately widened. They had only planned to listen to some gossip at first, and yet the drama ended up being right next to them? Yu Yanluo in particular suddenly felt as if her husband had been stolen from her.

Yan Xuehen was extremely embarrassed. She really wanted to crawl into a hole and hide. I’m done for! This is complete social suicide!

Mo Xi cut the threads while grumbling, “There are so many red threads! Are you sure this was only caused by a contract?”
