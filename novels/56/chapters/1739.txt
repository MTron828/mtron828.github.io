Chapter 1688: Shaman

Helpless to do anything else, each of the three could only intercept the figure closest to them. However, after trading a few blows, they immediately noticed that something wasn’t right. Even though Wang Wuxie’s cultivation was high, there was no reason for them to not even be able to identify the fakes at all.

“The one over here is fake!”

“The one over here is fake!”

“The one over here is fake!”

All three of them cried out at almost the same time. Then, they were all stunned. If the ones they faced were all fake, where was the real one?

They suddenly sensed something and looked in the same direction, where they saw a streak of purple light shoot toward the horizon like a rainbow. The three clones Wang Wuxie had produced were clearly nothing more than a trick, while his real body tried to break out of the encirclement.

Wang Wuxie’s move really was outstanding, as they couldn’t even identify the fakes without attacking them. However, they didn’t have any time to marvel at his tactics, because capturing him was a more pressing issue. In order to chase after Wang Wuxie, the three of them all used their brilliant abilities. Unfortunately, now that he had the initiative, how could they catch up?

Wang Wuxie's expression was cold. Once he gathered his people from the Righteous Sun Sect again and launched his counterattack, these people were going to pay the price. Apart from that, he could also contact some people who hadn’t participated in this affair. For example, Yan Xuehen definitely wouldn’t participate in such a despicable thing.

Suddenly, a golden 卍-shaped symbol appeared in front of him. It was small at first, but it quickly grew in size. By the time it reached him, it was massive. His fists traced a streak of purple light, smashing apart the 卍 symbol. However, his body also shook a bit from the impact, and he had no choice but to stop for a moment. Guan Chouhai and the others took the chance to surround him again.

“That move of Brother Wang was truly impressive,” Guan Chouhai said with a sigh. Producing three clones that could fool them was already exceptional.

Wang Wuxie didn’t feel the slightest bit happy. Rather, he looked straight ahead and said, “Master Jian Huang, I did not expect you to have joined in on this too.”

“Amitabha buddha!” an old monk replied as he brought his hands together and slowly walked out from the trees. Who else could it be but Tranquility Temple’s Master Jian Huang? He said, “This old one didn’t want to participate in this affair at first, but the State Teacher’s cultivation is too high. It simply wouldn’t do if I didn’t.”

Wang Wuxie said seriously, “Your distinguished self is a person of virtue and prestige. Why would you take the risk of doing such a treacherous and despicable thing with them?”

Master Jian Huang’s expression remained calm as he replied, “I believe Benefactor Wang also knows the reason clearly.”

Wang Wuxie was silent for a moment. Before the prosperity of the daoist sects, the Buddhist sects had held the position of the state religion. Now, Tranquility Temple had long since lost their former influence, so how could they not be dissatisfied? However, he hadn’t expected them to retaliate so boldly.

Still, it really was laughable. The daoist sects and Buddhist sects were working together just to restore the Buddhist sects’ former glory.

“There will only be more problems the longer we stall. Let’s just deal with him as quickly as possible,” Xuan Bajing said. After all, this was Wang Wuxie’s territory. Things would get troublesome very quickly if he could get away successfully.

“Benefactor Wang, apologies,” Master Jian Huang said, and Buddhist light suddenly erupted from behind him. Then, he slowly brought his hand together. The extremely slow movement instantly created an illusion of countless palms in front of Wang Wuxie.

“Thousand Hand Bodhisattva?” Wang Wuxie remarked. He could tell that this was Master Jian Huang’s special domain. He couldn't show even the slightest bit of carelessness anymore. In order to face Master Jian Huang’s palms, the violet ki around him turned into countless fists.

He frowned slightly. Master Jian Huang’s attack looked impressive, but in reality, he was holding back quite a bit. He’s probably on guard against Li Changsheng and these others too. It seems that whether or not I’ll be able to get out of this will depend on how well I exploit their lack of trust.

Li Chansheng, Guan Chouhai, and Xuan Bajing made their move. They were much more serious than before, as they had almost let Wang Wuxie get away earlier. They couldn't afford to be careless again. If Wang Wuxie managed to escape from an encirclement of enemies just as strong as himself, not only would they have no dignity left, but if news got out and Zhao Han found out, they wouldn’t be able to handle the consequences.

Wang Wuxie’s purple ki manifested in all sorts of different forms. Sometimes he attacked, and other times he defended. It really was erratic and unpredictable. However, his opponents were all on par with him. Even if they were still scheming against each other, when they joined forces, it still wasn’t something he could deal with alone.

After exchanging dozens of moves, they separated briefly. Wang Wuxie gasped for breath. He had taken a few more heavy strikes to his body, putting him in imminent danger. The others didn’t dare to get closer for the time being, though. Sensing his desperate yet firm resolve, none of them wanted to become the sacrifice he took down with him.

In that instant, a brief period of silence and calm overcame the place.

Suddenly, someone called out in surprise “What are you all doing here?”

All those present turned around and saw that the Righteous Sun Sect’s Watchful Heart Peak Master Feng Wuchang was looking at them in shock. After all, they were on Watchful Heart Peak. He had clearly sensed that something was strange, and thus had come over to take a look. He hadn’t expected to see such an alarming sight.

“Silence him!” Guan Chouhai cried out, panicking.

If Feng Wuchang ended up talking about what he had just seen, the Righteous Sun Sect would mobilize all their power and they would be in danger. Furthermore, there were still some other sects on the mountain who hadn’t joined the plot. There were also troops from the court.

Just then, Xuan Bajing, who was the closest to Feng Wuchang, made his move. Lightning flickered, and he instantly appeared in front of Feng Wuchang. His palm crashed down from above.

Even though Feng Wuchang’s cultivation wasn’t low, it still wasn’t much at all before a grandmaster. Now that he was being crushed by the enemy’s domain, he couldn't budge even an inch. He could only watch as the giant hand bore down on him.

Suddenly, a streak of violet ki flickered. Wang Wuxie instantly appeared in front of Feng Wuchang. He blocked Xuan Bajing’s palm while saying, “Junior brother, hurry and contact the other peak masters…”

Before he could even finish his sentence, he felt a sharp pain. He looked down and saw the end of a short blade sticking out of his chest. Xuan Bajing took the chance to strike his major acupoints, seriously wounding him. Wang Wuxie vomited a mouthful of blood, which contained a bit of misty energy that forced Xuan Bajing back. However, he didn’t have the strength to pursue the opponent anymore.

These people had set up an ambush on Watchful Heart Peak. As a peak master, how could Feng Wuchang have failed to notice anything? Unfortunately, by the time Wang Wuxie realized that, it was already too late.

Feng Wuchang was already far away, clearly fearing retaliation. He sighed and said, “Brother, I want to climb higher too, you know? With you here, that’s simply impossible.”

Wang Wuxie was so angry he actually laughed. He asked, “So that’s why you colluded with outsiders? Do you even have the ability to protect everything in the Righteous Sun Sect?”

Feng Wuchang replied, “Senior brother, you need not trouble yourself with that.”

Wang Wuxie didn’t waste any more time with him, and instead glared hatefully at the others. He spat, “I might be finished today, but even if I can’t drag one of you down with me, I can still make sure that you won’t be able to make a full recovery for several decades. Which one of you wants to be that unlucky one?” He had already given up all hope of escaping. He only wanted to drive a wedge between them to leave behind some hope for the future.

“Amitabha buddha, Benefactor Wang speaks too seriously. We do not have any intention of taking your life,” Master Jian Huang said.

Wang Wuxie’s expression was cold as he replied, “What, could it be that you are still hoping for me to cooperate with you?”

“Why not?” Guan Chouhai replied with a laugh. “Big sis shaman, it’s about time for your entrance.”

Wang Wuxie shivered. Could it be…Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Suddenly, a black figure slowly walked over from the distance, saying in a hoarse voice, “So many of you came out to surround Wang Wuxie, and you even used such despicable tactics to succeed. It really is disgraceful.” It was an old woman whose entire body was wrapped in a black cloak.

“Shaman Sect’s Great Elder Wu Wuyan!” Wang Wuxie exclaimed, his hopes turning to ashes. Then, he sent a palm toward his own forehead, clearly trying to end his own life.

The black-cloaked old woman moved. A straw doll suddenly appeared in front of her, and she bowed three times to it. Then, Wang Wuxie was frozen in place, and his vision blurred.
