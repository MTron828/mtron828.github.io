Chapter 649: Don’t Touch Me

Translator: Pika

Leng Shuangyue bowed towards the two of them. “Miss, young master, I need to go out for a bit.”

Qiu Honglei waved her hand. “You should go. Take care of them well.”

Leng Shuangyue voiced her acknowledgement and slowly left. She closed the door behind her.

Qiu Honglei smiled. “Look at how your eyes are glued to her. If you want her, then I can give her to you. I’m being serious.”

Zu An blushed. “What do you mean? I was just preoccupied with some thoughts just now.”

Qiu Honglei turned around and sat in his embrace. She hooked her hands around his neck. “It’s not like I mind. Either way, I can’t service you, so isn’t it all the same if I have one of my girls take care of you?”

After what they did in his room, the last barrier between them had been completely shattered. That was why she didn’t hold back at all before her lover. She sat intimately in his embrace.

Zu An stiffened up when he felt the soft feeling of her bottom. Qiu Honglei’s cheeks blushed. Her misty eyes looked at him. “Naughty.”

Zu An gulped. “You shouldn’t play with fire like this. You know you can’t give yourself to me, yet you’re still doing this type of thing.”

Qiu Honglei giggled. “Even if a fire starts, so what? Did you forget that this is a government brothel? We can just find some girls to help appease your fire.”

This woman!

Zu An groaned. He remembered his objective and used up a lot of willpower to push her away. “Let me see what kind of person this Cheng Gang is for myself.”

“Scaredy cat.” Qiu Honglei said this on the surface, but inside, her heart was pounding. If Zu An was playing with fire, then what about her?

Zu An could have other girls help him, but what could she do?

She stuck out her tongue at him. Meanwhile, she told herself that she really couldn’t be doing this type of stuff in the future.

Zu An arrived by the window and opened it a crack to take a look at the situation below.

He saw a stout young man with a thick neck in the lead. As if trying to pose as a culture lover, he wore a blue vest that was popular among the capital’s young masters. He wanted to look scholarly and refined, but because of his built, it didn’t suit him at all.

“That’s Cheng Gang. It’s obvious that he’s a coarse muscle head, yet he still wants to look like a scholar.” Qiu Honglei arrived at his side and introduced him. Her voice was full of disdain.

Zu An’s expression was a bit strange. It wasn’t that girls didn’t like muscular guys, they just didn’t like ugly guys. There was actually a term girls on the internet liked to call this type of men: shrimp men. Only after cutting off the head can you eat them.

“Hm? So the one he invited this time was the Qin clan’s young master.” Qiu Honglei was surprised when she saw the people behind him. “The two in the back with thick brows and big eyes are the State Duke of Triumph’s grandson Qin Guangyuan, while the one with more delicate features is State Duke of Prestige’s grandson Qin Yongde.”

The State Duke of Triumph is Chu Chuyan’s grandfather Qin Zheng, while the State Duke of Prestige is Chu Chuyan’s second grandfather Qin Se.

He had to admit that the Qin clan had good genes. Their attractiveness indexes were all pretty high. Cheng Gang looked like a servant next to the two of them.

This was understandable as well. Qin Zheng and Qin Se weren’t bad looking, and with their high status, they were able to marry beautiful women. This continued for their children, and since they were handsome and beautiful, the chances of giving birth to an ugly child was low.

“Hm? There’s someone you recognize.” Qiu Honglei had a weird look on her face. She nudged Zu An with her elbow. “Your little brother-in-law came too. Should I have my girls take good care of him?”

Zu An’s eyes widened too. He looked at the petite figure in the very back. This really was an attractive kid. Qin Yongde was quite handsome already, but compared to her, he was far off.

Why did that kid run all the way here? Zu An felt a headache. Did you forget that you’re a crossdresser? Coming to this type of place is completely courting death! He quickly replied when he heard Qiu Honglei’s teasing, “There’s no need, just treat him like how you normally do so they don’t find anything off.”

“Young Master Qin, Young Master Chu, this way please.” Cheng Gang’s boorish voice sounded. He made it sound as if he was the master here and he was enthusiastically inviting them over.

Shangyue also skillfully received these guests. She wanted to invite them inside, but the thick browed Qin Guangyuan stopped her. “Let’s stay here in the courtyard.”

Shuangyue was stunned, but she quickly reacted. “Sure!” She ordered the maids to bring some drinks and fruits out from inside.

Qiu Honglei commented, “I believe they are discussing something classified and are scared of outsiders listening in. That is why they chose a more spacious place.”

Zu An nodded. This was what he thought as well.

Cheng Gang laughed and said, “Shuangyue, these are all formidable young masters. However, the star of tonight is young master Chu. This is the first time he has been to this type of place, so it’s enough if you take good care of him.”

Chu Youzhao blushed, but she quickly returned to normal. “It’s fine, I’m okay by myself.”

The handsome Qin Yongde chuckled and patted her shoulder. “Youzhao is still a bit shy. We’re all men, aren’t we? You’ll get used to it once we come here more often. This Lady Shuangyue is quite a beauty. She’s an excellent choice for your first time.”

Chu Youzhao evaded his hand in a tactful manner, but she was hard-pressed inside. I wouldn’t have come with them to this place if I knew it was going to be like this! Sigh, it’s so tiring pretending to be a guy… There’s even all of these stupid things to worry about.

Shuangyue said with a smile, “Young Master Chu really is dashing.”

She naturally knew Chu Youzhao’s relationship with Brightmoon City’s Chu clan. She thought to herself that since he was Zu An’s brother-in-law, she really should treat him well.

The others teased, “Even Shuangyue seems to have been charmed by our Brother Youzhao, haha.”

Qin Yongde also smiled. “Even Murong clan’s first miss has been completely captivated by him, let alone a brothel girl.”

Qin Guangyuan frowned slightly. “Second brother, please speak cautiously.”

Qin Yongde also realized that comparing Murong clan’s first miss with a brothel girl wasn’t too suitable. “That was not too good of me. I’ll drink three cups as a punishment.”

Their group began to drink cheerfully soon afterwards, with each of them having two girls to keep them company. Meanwhile, Chu Youzhao had Shuangyue at her side.

As he watched the Qin brothers and Cheng Gang take advantage of the girls at their side, Zu An felt like he returned to his past world’s club scene.

Uh… As a highly experienced keyboard warrior, he obviously never went to those places before. He only heard about them online.

While these fellas were like fish back in water, Chu Youzhao was sitting restlessly. She continued to move to the side and gave that pretty flower courtesan a vigilant look. “Don’t touch me.”

Shangyue giggled. “Why must Young Master Chu be so nervous? I won’t eat you.”

Chu Youzhao frowned. These women from brothels really had no sense of shame. However, she couldn’t express that right now and could only say, “I’m not used to physical contact with others.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“No problem, then I will sit a bit further away.” Shuangyue didn’t suspect anything. She had met all types of men in this place with many who were even more strange. “Since this is the young master’s first time, this humble one will pour a glass to honor you.”

Chu Youzhao bit her lip. She felt extremely humiliated when she saw what the others were doing around her. She didn’t refuse the drink, because she needed something to divert her attention.

Shuangyue beamed when she saw that Chu Youzhao was willing to drink. She quickly poured her one glass after another. As the flower courtesan of a government brothel, she was full of tricks to get her clients to drink, so how could the inexperienced Chu Youzhao be a match? She still unknowingly drank a lot even when she had the intent to refuse.

Inside the building, Qiu Honglei smiled. “Your little brother-in-law is quite a gentleman. It’s just that he is a bit too feminine.”

Zu An rolled his eyes. Is this girl stupid? It’s one thing if you come to a brothel, but you’re going to drink that much too? Are you not scared that you’ll black out here and expose your identity?

A while later, Cheng Gang said with a cough, “Lady Shuangyue, we have something we need to discuss among ourselves.”

Leng Shuangyue got up and bowed. “If there is anything sirs need, please let this humble one know.” Then, she slowly left with the other girls.

Zu An’s face lit up. “They’re starting!”

This wait really was quite hard to endure. He had to watch them play around while he couldn’t do anything himself.

Qiu Honglei looked worried. “We might not be able to hear anything once they deliberately hide what they are saying.”
