Chapter 1450: Battle Between Deities

The Fiend Emperor’s expression darkened, and he reached out to grab the red light. His hand quickly enlarged, becoming so big it seemed as if it could blot out the sun. It quickly stopped the red streak of light.

Off to the side, even though it wasn’t the first time Wu Liang had witnessed the Fiend Emperor’s power, he was still very shocked. The Fiend Emperor’s skills really were incredible!

As the large hand engulfed the red light, a smile appeared on the Fiend Emperor’s face, and he prepared to retrieve it. However, his smile froze shortly after, because the red light passed straight through his palm. It quickly turned into a streak of light and disappeared into the distance.

The Fiend Emperor lowered his head to look at the palm of his hand. He saw that it wasn’t damaged at all! He couldn't understand it in the slightest. If the other party was powerful to the point that he couldn't win against it, and that was why the Sun Slaying Bow had left his hands, there was no way his hand would be unharmed. And yet, there was nothing there. The Sun Slaying Bow seemed to have become intangible. He couldn't touch it at all.

“Father emperor, hurry and chase after it!” the Golden Crow Crown Prince exclaimed, panicking. That was the weapon he relied on the most! In the past, the unparalleled Sun Slaying Bow had granted him incredible confidence. If he lost it, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to defeat his valiant second brother.

He immediately continued to speak out when he saw his father stare blankly in place. With his father’s ability, retrieving the Sun Slaying Bow wouldn’t be too difficult even if it flew into the horizon.

“Chase after it my ass! Why don’t you chase after it?!” To the crown prince’s surprise, the Fiend Emperor suddenly erupted with rage, smacking him in the back of the head. Fortunately, he didn’t use any strength, or else there wouldn’t be a Golden Crow Crown Prince anymore.

“Father emperor, what’s wrong?” the Golden Crow Crown Prince asked, feeling shocked and angry. Unfortunately, he couldn't go against his father, so he could only look back with a wronged expression.

“Do you think the Sun Slaying Bow would just suddenly up and leave on its own?” the Fiend Emperor replied, looking in the direction where the Sun Slaying Bow had disappeared with a strange expression.

“Of course not,” the Golden Crown Crown Prince immediately replied. The Sun Slaying Bow was the treasure of successive generations of the Fiend races’ royal family. It had already acknowledged him as its owner too. How could it just leave on its own?

“Right. That means someone used an ability to make the Sun Slaying Bow shoot into the distance,” the Fiend Emperor said. He paused briefly, his voice carrying a hint of fear, and yet also excitement. “The other party’s cultivation is above mine, and it is at a level that I cannot comprehend at all.”

“What?” the Golden Crow Crown Prince exclaimed, dumbstruck.

Wu Liang was stupefied too. There was actually someone more formidable than the Fiend Emperor? And judging from his tone, the Fiend Emperor seemed to be far inferior to the other party!

We’re finished, we’re finished! What kind of blasted secret dungeon is this? How am I even going to keep this petty life of mine?

However, after his initial daze, the Fiend Emperor actually became rapt with joy. There really was a higher level of power in this world, as expected! That means there is still a future for me, hahahaha….

As one of the two most powerful individuals of the older generation, the Fiend Emperor had experienced a bit of despair, not seeing any chance of improving any further. The ancient cultivation texts had shown that mortals couldn’t break through his current cultivation realm. Countless geniuses throughout the ages had asked the question ‘Are there really immortals?’ He was no exception to that.

But now, he could feel that even if he hadn’t gained anything else, just that previous interaction had granted him tremendous benefits. He now had the confidence that if he had enough time, he could even completely surpass Zhao Han. If he could interact with that power again, it was possible that he could really become a legendary immortal.

“Could it be because I just undid the Hundun’s seal?” the Fiend Emperor muttered to himself.

When Wu Liang heard that, he quickly said, “Your majesty, when we undid the Taotie and Hundun’s seals, ten suns appeared, and a terrifying aura filled the world. If we undo the Qiongqi’s seal too, removing all four of the great seals, who knows just what kind of calamity that would create?! I hope that your majesty will strongly reconsider!”

The Fiend Emperor didn’t pay him any attention. Instead, he directly questioned Dan Zhu’s soul, asking, “Where is the Qiongqi’s seal?”

At first, he’d had some apprehension toward Dan Zhu, expecting him to be plotting something. In the beginning, he had just intended to undo three seals to see what would happen, but after witnessing that extraordinary power, he couldn’t be bothered to exercise caution.

As a cultivator who had already reached his level, he had been pursuing the next step his entire life. Now that he had the chance, together with the fact that he didn’t have much more of his lifespan left, he couldn’t be bothered to worry about the dangers and continued without any hesitation.

Wu Liang’s face turned white. He thought, You can throw away your life if you want, but can you let me go first? Even so, there was no way he would say that out loud, or else he would die on the spot. If he followed them, he could at least live for that much longer.

Dan Zhu quickly told the Fiend Emperor where the Qiongqi’s seal was. The Fiend Emperor began to move ahead with the group, a resolute look in his eyes.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince turned around and continued following his father. He was very broken-hearted at the loss of the Sun Slaying Bow, but not even his father could do anything, so he felt even more helpless. He could only follow dispiritedly at his father’s side.

Meanwhile, on Zu An’s side, the red streak of light floated over to Zu An. Those present were dazed to see that it was a red bow.

Yan Xuehen and the others found the bow a bit familiar. They had seen the Golden Crow Crown Prince use it back then in the Snake race territory. It seemed to be the Sun Slaying Bow!

Its outer appearance seemed to be a bit different, but overall, it wasn’t that much of a difference. Zu An reached for it in a daze, and the red light gradually disappeared. The tangible feeling in his hand told him that it wasn’t a dream.

Soon, a red, uniquely-shaped bow appeared in his hand. At the same time, ten white arrows appeared beside him. Every single arrow was covered in ancient and profound runes. Upon closer inspection, the patterns seemed to sink deeply into the arrows. A powerful aura spread outward from the weapon, as if it were resonating with heaven and earth.

It was the aura of a divine weapon!

Just then, the golden light from the heavens scattered. The heavenly music stopped, and everything returned to normal as if nothing had happened.

A beautiful figure from the distant Goddess Peak gave Zu An a deep look. Then, she turned around and returned to the mountain.

Spirit Mountain’s Ten Shamans surrounded Zu An. Their faces were full of shock as they asked, “Why would the Celestial Emperor give that to you?” The way they looked at him, it was almost as if Zu An were the Celestial Emperor’s illegitimate child.

Zu An was also a bit stunned. He hadn’t expected to obtain the divine weapon so easily either, and from a Celestial Emperor, no less.

He suddenly remembered what Shun had said, that if he repeated Yi’s heroic path, he could obtain the acknowledgment of the world’s will and acquire the help of the divine weapon. Was this what he had been talking about?

That made sense to him. With the disparity between his current strength and that of the Golden Crows, he had no chance of winning at all. It had been destined to be an impossible mission from the start.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

However, now that he had the divine weapon, he had a chance.

He suddenly thought of something and asked, “Which Celestial Emperor was that just now?”

Spirit Mountain’s Ten Shamans discussed the question among themselves. Soon afterward, they came to the same opinion, replying, “Judging from the aura, it seemed to be Celestial Emperor Zhuan Xu.”

Zu An was stunned. Zhuan Xu? He had thought that Yi’s Sun Slaying Bow had been granted by Emperor Jun. He hadn’t expected it to be Zhuan Xu!

When he thought about the animosity between Zhuan Xu and Emperor Jun the shamans had mentioned, the fact that he had been given the Sun Slaying Bow proved that Zhuan Xu wanted to deal with the ten Golden Crows.

Isn’t getting involved in a battle of deities kind of a bad idea?

If I kill Emperor Jun’s sons, won’t Emperor Jun want me dead?

He’s a freaking Celestial Emperor! Just a thought from him can kill me!
