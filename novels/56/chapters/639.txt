Chapter 624: I Want You…

Translator: Pika

The thought made Zu An swallow in fear. He had been courting death earlier on!

Something else quickly crossed his mind. “If she killed so many court experts, why didn’t His Majesty intervene? Didn’t you say that the former Devil Sect sect master had been killed by His Majesty?”

Zhuxie Chixin explained, “That woman was too crafty. She made her move as soon as His Majesty left for the capital. Whenever the forces of the imperial court were greater than what she could handle, she would vanish, along with her subordinates. Only when the imperial court’s forces were weakened would she suddenly appear like a ghost and wipe those men out. After several such defeats, the imperial court decided to withdraw its forces temporarily.”

Zu An was incredibly shaken. Yun Jianyue was an expert at guerilla warfare! However, he didn’t understand the decision of the imperial court. “They withdrew? The court actually gave up?”

After all, most of the experts in the world had been roped in by the imperial court. He really couldn’t figure out why they would give up, considering their strength.

Zhuxie Chixin lowered his voice and said, “Humans once waged war against the fiend races. Even though His Majesty killed the Fiend Emperor, he was badly wounded by his adversary before his death. His Majesty finally managed to stabilize his condition, but his injuries flared up again after he killed the Devil Sect Master. His Majesty was focused on his own recovery, and did not pay the Devil Sect as much attention. No one else in the imperial court is a match for Yun Jianyue. Furthermore, under her leadership, the Devil Sect did not attack us for no reason. As such, both sides tacitly decided to live in harmony.”

Zu An now understood why so many relatives of the emperor and empress were out causing trouble. It wasn’t just because the emperor didn’t have much time left. Rather, it was because his foundation had been severely damaged in the past.

Despite this, he could tell that the emperor really was a formidable person. He had managed to kill the sect master of the Devil Sect even with the damage to his foundation, and easily defeated Yun Jianyue as well. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“All right. I need to continue searching for Yun Jianyue.” Zhuxie Chixin had come to enquire about Zu An’s task. He hadn’t expected the other party to be so cooperative, and he was rather satisfied with the outcome.

Zu An rose as well, and saw him out. As he was leaving, Zu An even waved at him. “Big brother, I wish you luck in capturing that female devil!”

When Zhuxie Chixin had left and Zu An closed the door again, Yun Jianyue was already sitting on the bed. She gave him a look of disdain. “Bootlicker.”

“What do you know? This is called worldly wisdom, okay? It’s not as though I’ll lose anything by offering him some kind words. It even helps to foster our relationship. Everyone is happy.” Zu An was obviously upset by her accusation.

“You only have to resort to such tricks because you’re too weak,” Yun Jianyue said indifferently. “Once you’re strong enough, there’s no reason to curry favor with anyone, especially if you could solve your problem easily by killing them.”

Zu An rolled his eyes. “Then why don’t you pay the emperor a visit and give that a try?”

Yun Jianyue’s breath caught in her throat.

Doesn’t this guy know how to have a proper conversation?!

Zu An grabbed a chair and sat in front of her, looking at her curiously. “Are you really a devil, like what he said?”

Yun Jianyue wasn’t used to someone being that close to her. She could almost feel him breathing. She subconsciously leaned backwards to put some distance between them. “Of course. I even love to eat the brains of infants and the mention of my name keeps children in bed at night. That’s why you’d better not offend me.”

Zu An looked her up and down. He really found it hard to associate this beautiful and graceful woman with the villainous woman Zhuxie Chixin had described.

Sigh, why do you always judge people by appearances, Zu An? You’re disgusting!

He scolded himself, then said, “So what should I do with you, now that I know this? Since you’re a devil who kills without batting an eyelid, you’ll get even with me once you recover. I won’t be able to defeat you when that happens. In that case, I might as well leverage my current advantage and kill you first.”

He deliberately put on a ferocious expression as he said this.

Yun Jianyue sat there, unmoving. Her expression did not change at all. She looked calmly at him as though he was an idiot.

Seriously?

“Sis, can you play along? I’m obviously trying my hardest to act tough. Are you really not afraid?”

“You didn’t show any killing intent,” replied Yun Jianyue indifferently.

Zu An was taken aback. He quickly realized that, at her level, she could keenly sense the invisible killing intent. It didn’t matter how vicious he looked on the outside.

He quickly lost interest in this little game. The little tricks that he used to deceive fair young maidens were useless against such an imperious woman.

He took out a pill and tossed it to her. “This is a Soul Return Pill. It’s pretty effective at treating all sorts of injuries. Take it.”

Yun Jianyue looked at him. “Is this medicine created by Brightmoon City’s Divine Physician Ji?”

It was his turn to be surprised. “You know him?”

How did that rascal Ji Dengtu know so many beautiful women?

Why the hell is he still pestering me everyday, then?

Sigh, I wonder how Xiaoxi is doing. I kinda miss that adorable little one. I really want to give her soft cheeks a kiss…

Yun Jianyue replied, “I’ve merely heard about him. Honglei spent some time undercover in Brightmoon City, and sent back some information about him. You should hold onto this medicine. It’s useless to me.”

“Huh?” Zu An felt a sudden urge to stand up for Ji Dengtu. “Even though Divine Physician Ji’s cultivation isn’t as high as yours, his medical expertise is still exceptional. Why won’t it work on you?”

“At my level, my body is much stronger than an ordinary cultivator’s,” Yun Jianyue explained. “Generally speaking, no wound that I suffer will be lethal. Even the most grievous wounds will slowly heal on their own.”

Zu An’s expression grew strange. He seemed to have returned to a time when he had just crossed over. Given Yun Jianyue’s cultivation, her body had already been tempered to a level beyond that of any human.

Let’s put it this way. Even if she lay down and let you have your way with her, you would be powerless to put it in unless your cultivation was close to hers.

Even if she controlled her body to somehow guide you inside, just a moment of lost concentration would be enough to snap you in half.

Even if you somehow render her unconscious so that she couldn’t move, a stray moment of arousal, a slight squeeze, and that would be the end of your little one…

The men of this world live truly miserable lives. No wonder so many of them are trying so desperately to increase their cultivation.

Yun Jianyue frowned. “What are you thinking about?”

She could subconsciously sense that this fellow’s mind was going astray.

“Nothing.” Guiltily, Zu An changed the topic. “Why do you seem so terribly injured, then?”

Yun Jianyue replied, “My battle against the emperor was on the soul level. It’s my soul that’s been wounded. Unless you have a pill that nourishes the soul, all other medicines are useless.”

“Which medicines can nourish the soul?” Zu An asked curiously. “I have quite a few pills on me.”

He had pills from Ji Dengtu, and other pills he had collected along the way. All together, he really did have quite a lot of medicine on him.

Yun Jianyue gave him an indifferent look. She didn’t think he held much promise, but she still replied, “Scarletflame Dew, Greendevil Jade, Spiritheaven Lotus, Vajra Darkfruit, Whitecloud Dew, Skyvenom Orchid, Five Aggregates Root… these will all do. Do you have any of them?”

Zu An stared blankly at her.

I’ve never even heard of any of that sh*t.

Zu An remained silent. He really didn’t have any of that on him. Even though he had Faith In Brother Spring, it was only a small bottle. He didn’t think it would work on a grandmaster. Even if he was going to use it, why would he waste his most expensive stuff on her? They weren’t even close.

Yun Jianyue smiled slightly, leaning against the bed and closing her eyes to rest.

Her obvious contempt left Zu An feeling sour. “What if I find any of these for you? How would you repay me then?”

Yun Jianyue’s eyes flew open. “You have these herbs?”

“That’s not important right now. If I get them for you, how would you repay me?” Zu An asked with an angry snort.

“What do you want?” asked Yun Jianyue, a thoughtful smile on her lips.

Zu An examined her beautiful cheeks closely and slowly said, “I want you…”

Yun Jianyue’s brows climbed upwards, and her expression immediately grew extremely dangerous.

“I want your disciple, Honglei,” Zu An finished.

Yun Jianyue stared at him, speechless.
