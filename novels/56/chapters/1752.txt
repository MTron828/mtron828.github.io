Chapter 1701: Indecisive

Chu Chuyan was shocked when she realized that. The Devil Sect’s charm skills were even effective on women?

Yun Jianyue raised her chin proudly when she saw the results.

Are you kidding me? If our charm skills were only effective on men, who would spend all that time cultivating it? Wouldn’t that mean it could only work on half the population?

Of course, it wasn’t without flaws. Women were different from men. If they were as innocent as a white sheet of paper, the effects of the dance would be a bit weaker. However, if they had experienced intimate moments with a man, the effects would become much greater.

Yun Jianyue looked around the area. It wasn’t that effective on Miss Xie, as expected.

Hm? Why is King Qi Manor’s little princess reacting like that? Could it be that she already has a lover?

That stone cold woman… Huh?

She suddenly discovered that Yan Xuehen’s expression was a bit strange. There was a faint pink hue on her usually snow-white skin. Even though it wasn’t that clear, as someone who had fought against her for so many years, Yun Jianyue was probably the one who understood her the best in this entire world.

Why is she reacting like that?

Even though the effects were extremely weak, with her cultivation and her nature, Honglei’s Heavenly Devil Temptation shouldn’t have had even the slightest effect on her!

Don’t tell me she has a man?

But how is that possible?!

Yun Jianyue immediately discarded that suspicion. If even this stone cold woman could have a man, it would be like the sun rising in the west.

Could it be that something went wrong with her cultivation recently?

She began to feel eager to challenge her rival. Could she use this chance to finally win against Yan Xuehen?

However, when she looked at Guan Chouhai and the others who were still eyeing her like tigers, she gave up on that thought in the end.

…

Just then, something changed on the battlefield. When she saw Chu Chuyan fall for her move, Qiu Honglei suddenly vanished from her original location.

A moment later, a hole seemed to be torn open in the sky behind Chu Chuyan. It was daytime, and yet the inside of that hole contained flickering starlight. Qiu Honglei appeared from within the tear. The demon blade in her hands was like a moon as it hacked down on Chu Chuyan.

This was her ultimate move, Nebula Rend!

The spectators all felt incredibly nervous. Even Zu An couldn't help but lean forward.

The move was full of destructive power, putting Chu Chuyan in danger. The curved blade was about to cut into her when Qiu Honglei suddenly hesitated. The blade in her hands moved a split second slower.

Yun Jianyue cursed her disciple for being foolish inwardly. Why are you showing her mercy at such a critical time? You really are too soft-hearted.

At almost the same time, wind and snow swept around Chu Chuyan’s entire body. Her entire figure almost instantly turned into a blizzard. When the blade slashed past, it only passed through the wind and snow. It didn’t manage to harm Chu Chuyan’s real body.

Qiu Honglei was stunned. Even though she had held back, judging from the current situation, it seemed that she might not have been able to hurt Chu Chuyan even if she didn’t. She smiled and said, “Little sister Chu, let’s compete against each other next time. Big sister is leaving now.” She turned into a streak of light and fled toward the horizon afterward.

The blizzard gradually calmed down, and Chu Chuyan appeared again. In the end, she let go of the Primal Skysilk and didn’t chase after her.

The spectators were all shocked. Guan Chouhai and the others flew into the sky and were about to intercept Qiu Honglei when Yun Jianyue blocked their path. The Crescent Ring vibrated as it spun around her, seemingly ready to deliver a thunderous blow at a moment’s notice.

Guan Chouhai shouted furiously, “Witch, what is the meaning of this?!”

Yun Jianyue said with a sneer, “I was about to ask all of you the same question. You’re powerful sect masters, and yet you’re going after a junior without any regard for your own identity.”

Guan Chouhai harrumphed. “We said that we were going to have a decisive battle, and yet your disciple ran before the fight was even finished. What are we supposed to do about that?”

“It’s obviously the result of her resourcefulness,” Yun Jianyue said with a smile. She thought to herself, Qiu Honglei didn’t let me down after all. She really is smart. As soon as she made up her mind, she chose to run without dillydallying at all.

She no longer had any misgivings. Even though there were many powerful experts here, none of them could keep her from escaping.

“If she’s fled, that naturally means she lost,” Guan Chouhai said with a cold laugh. “According to the agreement, you’ll stay here for several decades. Don’t worry. I believe that with his character, Brother Wang won’t make things difficult for you. You’ll just have your vicious tendencies smoothed over through the daoist ways.”

Wang Wuxie remained expressionless, as if he hadn’t even heard anything.

Li Changsheng added, “Your Devil Sect’s people will sell your souls for gain, as expected. She is clearly your beloved disciple, and yet in a moment of life and death, she abandoned you. How cold-hearted.”

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes and retorted, “Do you think our Holy Sect’s people are all as inflexible as your so-called orthodox sects? Now that she’s left, I don’t have anything tying me down anymore. Do you still think you can keep me here?”

The others’ expressions changed. It wasn’t impossible to keep her from leaving, but to do so, one of them could have to pay a bitter price of blood. Which one of them would want to be that unlucky person?Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Only Zu An sighed in relief. This was actually the best result for him.

The Kunlun Void Sect’s Elder Xuan Dou said, “I heard that the Devil Sect Master Yun killed people without a second thought, but words are just words. Today, it seems that you are also a liar who goes back on your words.”

Yun Jianyue looked at him with contempt and said, “Don’t try to play those little games with me. Those ordinary disciples might not have noticed anything, but there’s no way you haven’t. If my disciple hadn’t held back, that Chu girl might already have been a corpse by now.”

Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan had just returned. She remained completely calm and didn’t say anything.

The others frowned slightly when they heard that. They had indeed sensed that Qiu Honglei had shown mercy in that instant, and that was also what they found the hardest to understand. A Devil Sect witch had actually held back against an orthodox disciple? Could it be that she was worried that she would end up incurring great enmity from Yan Xuehen by killing Chu Chuyan, and so there would be an even smaller chance of the Devil Sect master and disciple leaving together?

Yan Xuehen knew what was going on. She naturally didn’t want her disciple to feel wronged and said, “Witch, you should understand that my Chuyan also held back just now.”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed, but she didn’t argue. She was quite frustrated inwardly, though. What was going on with these two? Had they ended up fighting over the same man for so long that they ended up getting along with each other? It was one thing for that Chu girl, but Honglei had grown up in the Holy Sect, so why was she suddenly growing so indecisive too?

What in the world? Are they really going to put on this kind and loving pretense?

She felt extremely annoyed. With a wave of her sleeve, she said, “Whatever. They’re pretty much equal in strength, so you’ll accept a draw, right? Since we didn’t lose, can I leave now?”

The daoist sect masters exchanged a look. With their status, forcing her to stay here seemed a bit inappropriate, and yet letting her go just like that would be losing too much dignity.

Just then, Zu An said, “Sect Master Yun, since you were the ones established this bet, I can’t say too much. But if we meet again in the future, I won’t let you leave so easily.”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Look at this pretty boy talking all big. Those words would sound more believable if it were your emperor who spoke them. But my mood is pretty good today, so I won’t argue with you guys. Don’t start begging me for mercy if we bump into each other in the future.” She swung her sleeves afterward, then instantly disappeared into the distance.

Yan Xuehen cursed inwardly. These two really were quite the actors! If not for the fact that she knew about their relationship, she might have just been deceived too.

Guan Chouhai asked Zu An with a frown, “Sir Zu, isn’t it rather inappropriate for you to just let that witch go?”

Many people cursed inwardly. Look at this damn old fox, immediately shifting the blame onto Zu An.

However, they knew it was to protect the dignity of the daoist sects. After all, they had to listen to the court’s decisions too.

Zu An said seriously, “His majesty’s Fengshan Ceremony is at hand, which is the most important thing. Letting all these side issues affect the timing and location of the setting will only bring trouble.” After mingling around the capital for so long, he had already learned how to thrive in such situations. Sure enough, when the others heard that, they didn’t say anything else.

Zu An was worried about Pei Mianman’s safety and didn’t continue to chat with them. Instead, he hurried to the courtyard from the previous night. When he arrived at that familiar room, he found the wardrobe Yun Jianyue had told him about. When he opened it up, he saw a hidden compartment. Pei Mianman was lying there like a sleeping beauty.

He undid her seals, and Pei Mianman gradually woke up. When she saw that it was him, she jumped into his arms enthusiastically and cried, “Ah Zu, I thought that I wouldn’t be able to see you anymore!”

Zu An sighed in relief. It seemed that she really didn’t know what had happened the previous night.

Suddenly, he felt a chill behind him. He turned around and saw that both Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan were quietly standing by the door, staring at the two of them embracing each other lovingly. He immediately got a huge headache.
