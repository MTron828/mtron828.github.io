Chapter 762: Absolutely Bizarre

Translator: Pika

Zu An was completely stupefied. There was actually a man like this in the world? He had thought that this type of thing only appeared in his previous world’s fiction. But there was actually someone like that in the real world! Sigh, there really are all kinds of fish in the sea.

King Wu was furious and nervous as he exclaimed, “You were actually secretly monitoring me!” His originally handsome face was now extremely warped.

Yun Yuqing tapped her toes against the ground. Some rune formations flickered at her feet, widening her distance from him. She retorted, “How else would I have found out your true colors?”

Her voice was as sharp as a blade, stabbing deeply into his heart. “Maybe it was out of misgivings toward your cooperation with the Demon Race; or perhaps you were still haunted by the morals you had left, so you couldn’t bring yourself to do that to me. That was why you found someone who looked a bit similar to me, always pretended that she was me, and then had another man violate her. Only then could you get stimulated and carry out intercourse. To be honest, I was so disgusted when I saw that back then that I wanted to throw up.

“It was no wonder that you always kept your distance after we got married. It was actually because you can’t get in the mood at all without doing such a thing first! But you know that I’m not someone easily deceived, so you never dared to put this into action. But eventually, you finally couldn’t resist that disgusting fetish of yours, so under the pretext of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, you had me seduce Zu An.”

Zu An’s eyes were wide open. He had never expected this perfect couple in the eyes of others to have such a crazy relationship in private.

Yun Yuqing suddenly smiled. “Back then, I really wanted to obtain the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, and because I wanted to get revenge on you, I agreed to your request. Back then, I thought that rather than offering my virginity to you, I might as well give it to another man. At the very least, I could then obtain the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra for the Demon Race. Now, thinking back, that was the best choice, because Zu An allowed me to learn what a true man is like, what a true husband should be like.”

When he saw his wife’s glowing smile, that face of happiness, King Wu knew that she had already been subdued by Zu An. That man had already left behind indelible traces, whether it was in her mind or body. He couldn’t help but feel incredible envy. “That damn Zu An, I’m going to kill him! I’ll definitely kill him!”

However, he quickly reacted and said, “Virginity? Impossible! I was the one who took it!”

Yun Yuqing sneered. “Oh, are you talking about that weird game you were playing in that private room before you for me, that one time?”

King Wu’s expression changed. That was precisely what he had been referring to.

Yun Yuqing said indifferently, “How could I possibly let your disgusting self touch me? After I discovered your secret that time, I was always thinking about how I would deal with you. My months of formation arrangement were finally complete by then. Together with the effects of the Devil’s Eye, it was enough to make you fall into an illusion. That was why you thought you obtained everything.”

Zu An was incredibly shocked. He had already had his suspicions back then. Yun Yuqing was just too underripe when she had first been with him, not like a young lady who had already experienced the bedroom. However, he had been completely deceived by the pair’s outward acts of affection, so he hadn’t thought too much about it. Now he realized that had indeed been her first time after all. No wonder her brows were furrowed so tightly, and she looked like she was in so much pain…

King Wu’s expression changed. “How is that possible? I’m a glorious master! How could your Devil’s Eye possibly affect me?”

“Is that so?” Yun Yuqing sneered. “I might not be able to deal with an authentic master, but a master like you who was raised on resources isn’t so tough at all. Furthermore, that weird addiction of yours has created many openings in your mind. As long as I prepared a bit and planted a seed, I could activate it at a suitable time. Once the Devil’s Eye worked against you once, it would become much easier in the future.

“But don’t worry, I haven’t let you down too much. At the very least, I helped you find a maid you like.”

King Wu’s expression changed several times. He asked in shock and disbelief, “Then all of the affection over the years you showed me was fake?”

Yun Yuqing replied, “The Devil Race had an alliance with King Wu Manor. I was worried about ruining our relationship, so that was why I played along. If I hadn’t met Zu An, I might have continued the act with you. However, I’m already tired of playing pretend.” When she spoke about Zu An, her eyes were full of infatuation.

However, that expression made King Wu feel as if his heart were being cut out. His expression suddenly became fierce. He stared at Yun Yuqing, exlcaiming, “Fine, then I’ll let you see whether I can do it or not myself!”

The stunning wife he had always thought he had under his control was actually far from his reach. It was instead he who had been played in the center of her palm! How could he swallow this resentment?

When he saw his wife’s stunning face, he felt his throat go a bit dry. He decided that he had to punish her properly no matter what. However, he suddenly felt a bit of hesitation inside. He hadn’t had time to prepare today. Would I… even be able to do it?

Yun Yuqing laughed. “Don’t believe your own lies. Should I give you some time to find a girl to play pretend first? To have her violated by another man?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Nonsense, I can do it!” King Wu’s face became beet-red. His breathing became heavy. However, the more he thought about it, the more his little guy didn’t listen. It continued to remain completely indifferent. His expression was filled with shame when he realized that. At the same time, he was filled with anger and resentment. How can that Zu An be so strong?!

You have successfully trolled Zhao Yan for +777 +777 +777…

Yun Yuqing sighed. She waved toward the back of the curtain and said, “Ah Zu, you should come out now.”

King Wu was speechless. Even Zu An was completely baffled. He really didn’t know what Yun Yuqing was thinking. However, he had just resolved to follow his own dao, so there was no need for him to cower right now. He came out from behind the curtain on his own.

King Wu was shocked and furious when he saw Zu An. “Why are you here?!” he exclaimed.

You have successfully trolled Zhao Yan for +233 +233 +233…

Zu An sighed. He felt a bit of sympathy for the guy as he replied, “Why do you think I’m here?”

King Wu suddenly turned around toward Yun Yuqing. “You brought him here?”

Yun Yuqing said indifferently, “You wanted to kill him, so I obviously wanted to save him. However, I was accidentally poisoned during the process, so he helped me get rid of it.”

“How did he help you?” King Wu immediately asked. In response, Yun Yuqing subconsciously glanced around her. There was a hint of bashfulness on her face.

King Wu then recalled how there had been water everywhere. One could well imagine just how intense it had been before. He was shocked and furious as he exclaimed, “Slut! You’re a slut!”

Yun Yuqing saw the change in his pants. She remarked with a disdainful look, “Look at your body’s reaction. Don’t you think it’s disgusting? I feel disgusted in your place.”

King Wu was ashamed and embarrassed. He didn’t know why there had been no reaction all this time, yet now that he learned about what had happened here, he had such a great reaction. His feelings of anger and humiliation made him want to explode. “You slut, I’m going to kill you two!”

Purple light suddenly erupted from Yun Yuqing’s eyes. Then, a pair of large and mysterious eyes appeared in midair.

Devil’s Eye!

King Wu’s figure stopped. Then, a layer of purple suffused his eyes. He stood there in a stupor while smiling stupidly. He was clearly already trapped in the Devil's Eye illusion.

Zu An thought to himself, As expected, King Wu was already affected a long time ago. Otherwise, he was still a glorious master rank expert in the end, even if his cultivation was obtained through resources. There should have been no reason for him to be controlled so easily. Judging from the circumstances, it seemed he had already been under the influence of the Devil's Eye for a long time.

Yun Yuqing quickly arrived by King Wu’s side to seal up his acupoints. Then, she tossed him to the side. Afterward, she stopped her Devil’s Eye. She said apologetically to Zu An, “I’ve shown you a poor side of me.”

Zu An had a strange expression on his face. “Your relationship really is quite something.”

Yun Yuqing sighed. “I didn’t want it to be this way either. After I learned about his strange fetish, I had goosebumps all over, and I wanted to throw up whenever I saw him. If it weren’t because of my clansmen’s future, I would have been unable to take it a long time ago.”

Zy An couldn’t help but say, “I have to admit that your acting is really good. Even though you hated him that much, you still looked like an affectionate couple to everyone.”

Yun Yuqing had a proud smile that didn’t match her usual appearance. “Did you forget that I’m a part of the Demon Race? Demons aren’t such good people, you know?”

Zu An instead sighed in relief. “I would be more scared if you were always this weak and timid-looking.”

Yun Yuqing gave him an annoyed look. “Do you know how good I am to you? Don’t tell me you don’t feel anything?”

Zu An chuckled and hugged her soft body. “I know how tender you are well enough.”

Yun Yuqing blushed a little. She said playfully, “You should know the answer to the question you asked me earlier after listening to all of that, right?”

Zu An sighed and asked, “So he was one of the masterminds after all?”

Yun Yuqing nodded. “I believe it was because of… what happened last time in North Order Commandery. He went crazy from jealousy, so he wanted to use this chance to kill you. Of course, he wasn’t the one who planned the entire attack. I have a selfish request. I hope you can let him go today, because he’s tied to our Demon Race’s future. As for the details, it’s a secret that involves our clansmen, so I apologize, but I can’t tell you.”

Zu An couldn’t help but smile. “You were the one who caught him, so I’ll leave it up to you as to how you’ll deal with him. Why would I kill him?”

King Wu was a master rank, while Yun Yuqing was a mysterious Rune Master with all kinds of Demon Race skills. If they really wanted to act against him, then he might really suffer quite a bit today. She had said that purely out of consideration. Meanwhile, he naturally had to play along.

Yun Yuqing smiled and said, “Ah Zu, you’re the best.”

When Zu An saw that innocent and naive smile and remembered her usual delicate and timid appearance, he really found it hard to associate her with that vicious and ruthless woman he had seen moments ago. Sigh, that Zhang Wuji really hit the nail on the head. The prettier the girl, the better they are at lying.

Yun Yuqing became sad when she sensed the reservation Zu An unintentionally exuded. “I know that what happened just now must have made you feel all kinds of misgivings. I was really moved because I heard that you were willing to cast aside the entire world for me, so I couldn’t hold back the urge to tell him about our relationship. I don’t want you to think that I’m an unruly girl… Of course, I know that it’s meaningless now no matter what I say, but I know that time will prove everything.”

Zu An was way past the phase of believing anything a girl told him. He had his own beliefs and didn’t tangle with her on this issue. He asked, “By the way, who was the one colluding with King Wu, anyway?”
