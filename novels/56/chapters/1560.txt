Chapter 1509: Too Kind

Skill description: If your back hurts, it might not be because of a blade. If you are screaming your heart and lungs out, it might not be because of pain. What rests on your shoulders might not necessarily be responsibility. Things you are forced to learn might not be a lesson!

Skill effect: Only effective on men. Once a target is selected, it will force them to experience a woman’s perspective. They will feel as if they were being powerfully filled by a strong and robust man. One of the four scenarios above will be chosen, and they will continue to scream ‘Ikuu ikuu~’.

Note: This skill is ineffective against those without any intimate experiences.

Such a monstrous villain as Sir Fu had definitely had his fair share of oppressing others with sexual acts. Either way, there was no way he could be an innocent virgin. His entire body trembled, and he started shaking. In his mind, he was no longer the great devil who left others terror-stricken, but rather a weak, shivering little bat.

A large group of burly men surrounded him. Elephant race, Bison race, Rhinoceros race, Donkey race… There was even the Whale race and the Dragon race… All of them had one common trait, which was that they were big. Really, really big.

Their sizes made Sir Fu feel inferior. He hid in the corner and trembled in fear. On top of that, they all looked a bit familiar…

Was I the one who killed them?

I can’t remember…

Those guys didn’t give him any time to think. They grabbed him roughly. He struggled frantically, but in front of these burly men, he was just like a petite little flower. His arms and legs were soon spread out like the 大 character.

Then… Then he learned that his body actually had many, many holes! His mouth could do more than just eat; his butt could do more than defecate…

…

Sir Fu almost had a mental breakdown from what he was experiencing. His entire body shook. He wanted to scream, but his mouth couldn't open any wider. Two streaks of tears slid out of the corners of his eyes. Never could he have imagined that a great villain like him would have such a pitiful encounter and be ravaged like this. He was actually…

Able to feel so good?

Suddenly, the gate to a whole new world seemed to have opened up for him. Soon, something seemed to emerge from the depths of his body. He couldn't control it at all. It rushed out like a surging river!

All of the fine hairs on his back stood up. His entire body shivered. That ‘something’ gushed out relentlessly. Such a feeling was sore, yet refreshing, and yet also gave him a feeling of emptiness.

Huh?

What’s leaving me seems to be my cultivation!

He was horrified when he realized what was happening. He finally snapped out of his daze. He wanted to keep his cultivation from leaving him, but it was as if a dam had burst. After the opening was made, how could he still stop it?

He was shocked and furious. He was usually the one who sucked out the blood essence and cultivation of others, and yet today, someone else was sucking away his cultivation?

He sneered. You want to compete against me in absorption?

Sorry, but you’ve run into this master today!

He quickly used his evil skill on the opponent’s blood essence. As long as he absorbed blood essence more quickly, it was his opponent who would die!

Who can compare to me in sucking… Ikuu ikuu!

Sir Fu’s face suddenly turned red. He didn’t know the meaning of that phrase, but he felt a humiliation that originated from his very soul. He could only endure the shame while continuing to suck the opponent.

I’m going to suck, suck, and suck some more!

Huh? Why can’t I suck out anything?

Sir Fu was horrified. He discovered that his skill wasn’t working as intended.

If his absorption was like an ocean whirlpool, that guy’s suction was like a black hole amid the cosmos. Zu An’s technique even seemed to be the ancestral version of his own; it was far more profound and mysterious. 

Don’t tell me this is the legendary skill of the Blood races that has been lost since… Ikuu ikuu!

The scene really was a bit strange in the eyes of everyone else.

At first, Sir Fu had been charging at the youngest prince. Zu An had stood in his way, so Sir Fu had to face Zu An first. They had all thought that it would be an effortless victory, and Zu An would be instantly sucked into a shriveled corpse.

However, they hadn’t expected Sir Fu to suddenly stop. Then, a smile had appeared on his face. It was very strange, and yet somehow resembled a look of satisfaction. It really was hard to describe.

Then, Sir Fu’s body had begun trembling quickly. In a different time and place, many people would have thought he was going through ‘that’.

The worst part was what he continuously shouted. It seemed to sound like ‘ikuu’! Even though they didn’t know what it meant, people’s imaginations ran wild, making their faces red from embarrassment.

“What in the world is going on, Sir Fu?!” the Second Prince cried out with a frown. He had never heard of Sir Fu showing mercy. Was he planning on capturing the young prince alive?

We can’t allow that! It’ll make things trickier. The Crown Prince is one thing, but the young prince is still so young. I can’t take on the bad name of killing my younger brother. Hurry up and kill him already!CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Just then, Zu An put his hand on Sir Fu’s body. Sir Fu’s entire body began to shake even more powerfully, and he began screaming louder and louder too.

The Second Prince wasn’t shocked, and was actually happy to see that. After all, what was Sir Fu’s strongest point? He had already trained his skill to the point that every single one of his pores could suck out blood essence. And yet, Zu An was putting a hand on him? Wasn’t he just courting death?

However, his smile quickly froze on his face, because Zu An wasn’t sucked into a shriveled corpse. Sir Fu let Zu An keep a hand on him, and the two of them froze as still as statues.

…And yet, they weren’t entirely still, because Sir Fu’s entire body continued shaking. He kept uttering the ‘ikuu ikuu’ sounds that were difficult to understand.

Zu An had started using his Heaven Devouring Sutra with everything he had. He had used the Ikuu Experience Card to catch Sir Fu off guard, then seized the opening.

The Heaven Devouring Sutra was an extremely miraculous technique. He had been worried that it wouldn’t be able to suck out Sir Fu’s cultivation, but if he had even a single opening, no matter how high the opponent’s cultivation was, they would fall victim to the skill.

In the past, Zu An hadn’t really used the skill to absorb the cultivation of others. The first reason was that he felt that it would harm the natural harmony of the world, and the second was that the cultivation he acquired would be impure. The more he absorbed, the easier it would be for there to be problems later. As such, he had only used the Heaven Devouring Sutra to absorb and neutralize the skills of opponents who were at a higher level than himself. He hadn’t taken their cultivation into his own body.

However, this Sir Fu was different. He was incredibly vicious, and just then, he had cruelly slaughtered so many innocent people. Zu An didn’t feel the slightest bit of mental pressure when facing him.

Furthermore, Sir Fu was a grandmaster, so Zu An didn’t have any way of ambushing him at such a short distance. If he were just protecting himself, it would have been fine, but it was too hard to protect the young prince and Yu Yanluo at the same time.

That was why Zu An had simply used the Heaven Devouring Sutra. Together with the Ikuu Experience Card skill, he had begun to forcibly absorb Sir Fu’s cultivation. He had been a bit worried at first, because Sir Fu was even stronger than the other Blood race individuals he encountered before.

And yet, once he began to absorb his opponent’s cultivation, he found that Sir Fu’s skill was a bit familiar. It was really similar to that of Mosquito Daoist, but one was a female mosquito, while one was a male bat, so he hadn’t made the connection. Once it started, however, Zu An felt the energy inside of him rise drastically. He had to admit that just like Mosquito Daoist, this Sir Fu was just too kind to him.

Soon, Sir Fu’s eyes became dimmer and dimmer, eventually completely fading away. He had sucked countless people dry, and yet met the same fate himself in the end. In a sense, it was a fitting end for him. Furthermore, he had been trapped in the ‘ikuu’ fantasy the entire time, so he passed away happily.

Meanwhile, Zu An only felt as if a roaring sea of energy had entered him. All of his meridians felt as if they were about to explode. If not for the fact that his body had been tempered several times and become incredibly tough, and without the Heaven Devouring Sutra’s profundity, he could have already exploded like a balloon.

No one else knew what had happened, only seeing the two standing quietly together. The Second Prince had a bad feeling and quickly shouted, “Sir Fu, we must end things as quickly as possible! Do not delay any longer!”

“Oh, I don’t think he can answer you anymore,” Zu An replied. The White Lotus Flame surged from his hand as he spoke, burning Sir Fu’s corpse into ashes.

The main reason for that was because such absorption skills were hated by the entire world. He didn’t want anyone to find out anything from examining Sir Fu’s body, making him into a public enemy.

However, the scene was horrifying in the eyes of others. Sir Fu had charged with such impressive momentum, and yet he was stopped by a single hand. Afterward, he continuously started mumbling ‘ikuu’ or something. Before anyone could understand what was happening, fire had erupted from Zu An’s hand, and just like that, the famous Sir Fu was turned to ashes.

It looked as if Zu An hadn’t used that much strength, but when Sir Fu refused to listen to his warning, Zu An had exerted a bit more force and killed him.

Just how ridiculous was such strength?
