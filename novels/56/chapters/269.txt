Chapter 269 - Who the Hell Said Mooched Food Doesn’t Taste Good?

Translator: Pika

Jiao Shanhe and the other two guards suggested that Zu An travel in a carriage today. There was no way anyone could recognize him if Zu An was inside an enclosed carriage. This would add another layer of protection.

Zu An rejected this suggestion. If they did this, his line of sight would be blocked, and he wouldn’t be able to notice danger ahead of time.

This was a matter of life and death! He didn’t want to hand his enemy the initiative.

Zu An rode proudly along the street as if announcing his presence to the entire world. His three guards were left completely speechless. However, since things had already turned out this way, they could only grit their teeth and pray that nothing happened.

A distance away, a peddler secretly released a pigeon into the sky.

A short while later, the same pigeon landed in a hidden courtyard, and a red-haired man removed a small slip of paper from its leg. He frowned when he read the coded message. “He left so quickly, and with just three guards?”

One of his subordinates beside him said excitedly, “This kid really has a death wish! This is a great opportunity! Let’s just get rid of him now and avenge the second boss!”

Chen Xuan immediately roared back at him, “Remember what I’ve taught you! Never underestimate your enemy—only then can you live a long life! This bastard Zu An took down Plum Blossom Sect and even ended your second boss’ life! Do you really think he’s some idiot?”

That subordinate shook his head. “I don’t think so.”

“That’s more like it.” Chen Xuan snorted. “In my opinion, this is surely a trap to draw me out.”

“But what if it isn’t? It’ll be such a huge waste to let this chance go...” the subordinate muttered.

Chen Xuan pondered a moment. “I’ll take a look around and make a move if there’s an opportunity. The rest of you, stay here. There are people looking for us everywhere in the city. It’ll only be more dangerous if all of you come along.”

“You have to be careful boss!” The others all clasped their fists and voiced their acknowledgement.

Chen Xuan grunted in approval, and slipped out of the residence secretly. Only after noticing that there was no one around did he remove the thin mask on his face.

With the mask removed, his face began to change slowly, his features becoming ordinary, and plain enough that he wouldn’t draw any attention in a crowd.

Even his head of fiery hair turned black, which was the most commonly-seen color.

This was the Blackwind Stockade’s Chen Xuan, someone who had run rampant for so many years. He had done so many outrageous things, yet no one could ever catch him. How could someone like him be hot-headed and impulsive?

His appearance in the Immortal Abode—with a head of bright red hair and an arrogant and aggressive demeanor—was an image he had deliberately created. He wanted everyone to associate him with red hair.

How could someone like Chen Xuan be dumb enoug to show his true appearance to others?

Not even the members of the Blackwind Stockade knew that he always wore a mask.

He was already well-acquainted with betrayal in all its various forms, having walked the thin line between life and death since his youth. There was no way he would reveal his trump cards to anyone else.

Chen Xuan took off, heading straight in Zu An’s direction. With his natural speed, he was able to quickly catch up.

He observed Zu An for a while in secret, but didn’t notice any sort of ambush nearby.

An evil grin appeared on his face. Just as he was about to make a move, he suddenly noticed Zu An’s excessively carefree expression. The brat looked like he was marching in a parade or something, as if he was scared others wouldn’t notice him.

He hesitated. What the hell?

He took a few moments to reconsider. A thought suddenly struck him. He’d figured out what was going on!

Against someone like him, a normal ambush wouldn’t work. There had to be another top-level expert hiding nearby. It might very well be Chu Zhongtian, or even the academy’s Jiang Luofu.

With the considerable skills that those two possessed, he obviously had no way of locating them.

Holy shit! I almost fell for his trap!

Chen Xuan mopped away the cold sweat pouring from his forehead. He stared fiercely at Zu An, who was still a distance away.

This little bastard really is treacherous!

You have successfully trolled Chen Xuan for 666 Rage points!

Zu An felt a chill run through him when he saw the Rage points come in. He put up his guard immediately, and secretly examined his surroundings, trying to find out where Chen Xuan was.

There was no way for him to know that Chen Xuan’s current appearance wasn’t that of the red-haired man he had in his mind.

Even though he was discreet with his movements, they didn’t escape the detection of an experienced cultivator like Chen Xuan.

A wave of shock ran through Chen Xuan’s mind as he immediately picked up on Zu An’s unusual behavior.

With his cultivation level, there shouldn’t be any way for this kid to have noticed me!

Did that hidden expert notice him?

He began to panic. After all, he was appearing as his real self right now! It would certainly spell trouble if he were to be seen.

However, he was still a veteran in this field. Maintaining a casual air, he continued his act as an ordinary pedestrian and left the street.

He continued walking for a few more blocks, making sure that no one was following him. Satisfied that he had evaded any pursuit, he finally sighed in relief. “I have to be more careful in the future. That was too close...”

Meanwhile, Zu An scoured his surroundings thoroughly, But couldn’t even find a single trace of Chen Xuan. He didn’t receive any more Rage points from him either.

He finally came to the conclusion that Chen Xuan had probably slipped away.

Did I make it too obvious?

Zu An reviewed his actions. From the intelligence he’d gathered on this fellow, Chen Xuan was craftier than a fox, and more cautious than a mouse. It might not be that easy to bait someone like that into a trap.

Without being aware of it, they had already arrived at the Immortal Abode. Upon seeing the personal invitation card from Qiu Honglei, a servant girl quickly brought him to Immortal Abode’s rear courtyard.

After the disturbance the last time, Qiu Honglei didn’t bother with anything as extravagant as a river boat this time. She received him in her room instead.

Zu An planted himself unceremoniously at the table and began wolfing down the food in front of him. Qiu Honglei was stunned. “Not many men think of food when they come to this sort of establishment. You might be the first.”

“I can’t help it, I’m starving. My stomach was rumbling the whole way just thinking about all the good food here,” Zu An said as he shoveled more food into his mouth.

Qiu Honglei handed him a cup of tea. She frowned disdainfully at his rather sloppy table manners, but quickly covered it with a slight smile. “Slow down, no one is trying to steal your food.”

Her expression was so alluring, it would have been enough to suck the soul right out of one’s body. It was a pity that Zu An was completely preoccupied with his food, and paid scant attention to the beautiful scenery in front of him.

“By the way, how are those buddies of mine doing?” Zu An asked, drinking the tea she gave him.

Qiu Honglei’s smile broadened. “Aren’t you the loyal one? Don’t worry, they will be suitably entertained, to ensure that their trip wasn’t made in vain.”

Zu An was a little stunned at her ambiguous statement. He just wanted to get those guys a bite to eat as well. Why did he suddenly feel like he’d signed up for some huge package?

After all, with Qiu Honglei’s status, how could her arrangements be poor?

Those fellas really are getting a good deal here! That idiot Cheng Shouping has no idea what he's missing out on.

Hold on... I’d better not be the one footing the bill for their expenses...

Damn it, I’ve been scammed. I only came here for free food. I didn’t get anything special for myself, while those guys are having the time of their lives. Yet I’m the one who has to pay?

He began to curse himself for his stupidity. Something seemed to spark Qiu Honglei’s curiosity. “Does the glorious Chu clan not even provide you with a meal?”

“It’s complicated...” Zu An gave her a rough summary of what went on between him and Qin Wanru, leaving out some confidential details.

Qiu Honglei’s indignance was plain to see. “How can the Chu clan treat someone with young master’s character and competence so poorly?! Honglei feels injustice in young master’s place.”

Zu An chuckled. “Can I interpret this as you secretly inciting disharmony between the Chu clan and me?”

Qiu Honglei sniffed in displeasure. “I only said this because I treat young master as a friend! Who would dare speak poorly of Brightmoon Duke’s clan otherwise?” she whined playfully.

“All right, it’s my bad for doubting your noble character.” Zu An couldn’t help but sigh inwardly. Everyone always says that brothel girls know exactly what to say to make you feel better. It seems like I’ve gotten firsthand experience today.

Even though it was clear to him that this girl was still putting on a show, it still felt amazing.

Qiu Honglei smiled. “This humble one doesn’t have a noble character. I am just an ordinary girl. I am already truly thankful that young master doesn’t find my words too short-sighted.”

“Lady Qiu must be joking. How is this considered short-sighted? Then what do we call the countless men from Brightmoon City who prostrate themselves in front of you?” Zu An replied with a smile.

“It doesn’t matter how many other men prostrate themselves before me. If I cannot move the young master’s heart, then all of that is completely meaningless.” Qiu Honglei’s large and beautiful eyes stared into his own, two beautiful, swirling pools filled with an enchanting radiance.

Zu An inwardly praised her skills. This woman really was a seductive witch, the sort that dragged others down straight to hell.

Qiu Honglei clearly didn’t want to take things too far. She quickly softened her gaze and said with a gentle voice, “By the way, Is it true that young master was attacked by Chen Xuan in the morning?”

“News really reaches lady Qiu quickly,” Zu An said in surprise.

“I too was almost harmed by Chen Xuan last night, so I paid special attention to any information on him. Young master, please wait a moment.” Qiu Honglei suddenly got up and hurried into the inner hall. She came back soon after, and handed him a set of jade strips. “Please accept this. It might be of some help to the young master.”

Zu An was stunned. He noticed some words on the glossy surface: ‘Mirror Mirage’.

With a flicker of light, the words faded into the jade strips again.

“What are these?” Zu An asked curiously.

Qiu Honglei replied, “The cultivation method ‘Mirror Mirage’ is recorded in these strips. This secret art allows one to hide their cultivation, and can also mask your aura. Your enemies won’t be able to sense these things about you. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Chen Xuan is currently hiding in the darkness, waiting for an opportunity to assassinate young master. After much thought, Honglei decided that a movement technique would be unhelpful, as it would be too hard to learn quickly. That’s why I found this secret technique. This might grant young master a higher chance of survival against Chen Xuan’s attacks.”

Zu An was awestruck. Shang Liuyu had gifted him a jade pendant, Chu Chuyan had given him ‘Snowflake Sword’, and now he had obtained a secret art of camouflage from Qiu Honglei...
