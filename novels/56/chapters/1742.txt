Chapter 1691: Night Scout

Zu An keenly sensed the danger hidden behind the question. However, he still spoke the truth. “Of course I don’t want you guys to fight.”

Both of them were equally important to him! It would be annoying for him regardless of who lost.

“Oh, then it seems you don’t want me to go against that big… Ahem, Miss Pei for first place, right?” Qiu Honglei replied, looking a bit downcast. She looked as if she was about to cry.

Yun Jianyue mentally gave her a thumbs up. As expected of my outstanding disciple! This is what a Devil Sect demoness should be like!

Zu An quickly said, “I don’t actually care who ends up winning, I just don’t want either one of you to lose. Whether you or Manman loses, I don’t want to see that. After all, both of you have worked so hard.”

There was another reason he couldn't really say. It would have been fine if they lost to someone else, but these were their future competitors. It would be a bit too hard to accept if they lost then.

Yun Jianyue sneered and retorted, “What, are they supposed to fight to a draw in a martial arts competition? Isn’t that just too much wishful thinking?”

Zu An sighed and said, “I’m in a tough spot here too, you know?”

“This isn’t really any of your business. Who wins and who loses all depends on their skill. What are you worrying about them for?” Yun Jianyue replied disdainfully.

Qiu Honglei said in a cute and pitiful manner, “Ah Zu, if you care so much about that Miss Pei, I can lose to her for you. Either way, I’m not the real Peng Wuyan, so even if I lose, it’ll just be Emptiness Isle who gets embarrassed.”

Yun Jianyue raised her eyebrows. Isn’t my Honglei becoming more and more formidable?

Even though she also knew such tricks, due to her personality, she had come to find such tactics embarrassing as her strength grew. As such, she was only a charm master in name. In reality, she clearly wasn’t even as effective as her disciple. The only time she had ever used her charm skills was the dance she had performed in the secret dungeon for Zu An. Her heart rate sped up a bit when she recalled that situation.

Zu An naturally knew that Qiu Honglei was saying those things on purpose, but he didn’t feel disgusted by it. Seeing a woman he liked play around a bit was actually an interesting experience in itself. He said, “Forget it, forget it. You should just fight if you have to. I won’t get involved any further.”

Qiu Honglei smiled sweetly like a blossoming flower. She didn’t say anything else and leaned into his embrace.

Yun Jianyue nodded in satisfaction. Honglei’s skills are becoming more and more natural. As expected of the inheritor I favor.

However, she didn’t feel as happy as she had expected. In particular, when she saw the two stick together so intimately, she seemed to feel a bit… restless? She couldn't help but feel shocked. Yun Jianyue, Yun Jianyue, you’re so shameless! How can you be jealous of your own disciple?

She quickly stopped herself from thinking about it from Qiu Honglei’s perspective. However, that meant she could only direct her anger at Zu An. It's all this damn rascal’s fault!

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +300 +300 +300…

Zu An was frightened when he saw all of those Rage points. When he looked at Qiu Honglei in his arms, he finally realized what was going on. Still, that only made him feel distraught. This isn’t my fault, you know? It was Honglei who leaped over herself!

In his eyes, the two of them had already received the master’s approval, so there wasn’t anything he really had to worry about. He could only cough lightly and say, “Why don’t we first return to Violet Mountain then? For some reason, I just feel that something big is about to take place there. I’m worried that something will happen.”

He didn’t really care about the other daoists, but Chuyan, Big Manman, and Xie Daoyun were all on Violet Mountain. As for Yan Xuehen, her cultivation was so high that he didn’t really have to worry.

Yun Jianyue nodded and said, “Fine, those daoist sects should just disappear as soon as possible.”

Peng Wuyan had ‘disappeared’ for quite some time. It was a good time to return and put on a show of the return of the king. Just the thought of revealing their identities after they won and seeing the reactions of those daoist sect hypocrites improved Yun Jianyue’s mood.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

…

It was already late, which made it easier for them to hurry back. However, that also resulted in another problem: How were they going to return to Violet Mountain?

As a grandmaster, Yun Jianyue could naturally fly. Meanwhile, Qiu Honglei could perform short-term flight, but flying the entire trip wasn’t quite within her abilities. She had to be carried by either Yun Jianyue or Zu An.

She wanted to be with Zu An, but she couldn't really show it. As such, she said, “I’ll just go with master.”

Yun Jianyue’s eyes widened. Her disciple was still shooting looks at Zu An while saying that, as if she really wanted to throw herself into his arms, and yet she had still said otherwise. She’s clearly saying this out of consideration for me. Looks like I’ve raised a good disciple after all.

She harrumphed and said, “Forget it. You’ve been apart for a long time and definitely have a lot to say to each other. I won’t get in the way anymore.” She didn’t wait for their reaction and disappeared into the sky afterward.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +488 +488 +488…

Zu An blinked. This woman sounds so generous on the surface, and yet she’s clearly upset inside.

Qiu Honglei didn’t know what was going on and said with a sigh, “Master really cares a lot about me! Ah Zu, we have to treat her respectfully in the future.”

Now, it was Zu An’s turn to feel conflicted. How does she want to be respected though… However, he couldn't really explain himself either, and could only reply ambiguously. Then, he took out the Wind Fire Wheels and wrapped an arm around her slender waist, saying, “Let’s go.”

Qiu Honglei was wearing a cherry blossom-colored long skirt with exquisite flowers embroidered on it. When they flew into the sky and the ends of her skirt fluttered, it made her figure seem even more fair and graceful. As he held her in his arms, Zu An felt as if Honglei’s body lacked any bones.

The two flew together and chatted about what they had seen and heard while they were apart. They had actually already talked about many things, but as lovers who were passionate about each other, they never ran out of things to say.

As they talked for a long time, their emotions got stronger and stronger. Both of them unknowingly began to kiss each other. Qiu Honglei moaned. She was a bit embarrassed at first, but then she gradually responded in an enthusiastic, yet underripe manner. Her lips were soft and beautiful.

While the two of them were completely lost in their own world, someone suddenly coughed from off to the side. Only then did they realize that they were already at Violet Mountain, and Yun Jianyue was watching them from nearby.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +666 +666 +666…

“Master~” Qiu Honglei complained. She quickly left Zu An’s arms.

Zu An was a bit embarrassed. When he saw the Rage points, he couldn't help but look at Yun Jianyue with a pensive expression.

Yun Jianyue only responded with an upset expression before telling Qiu Honglei, “We’re already near Violet Mountain, so there are all sorts of people watching. You should return to Peng Wuyan’s appearance.”

“Oh…” Qiu Honglei muttered. She turned to Zu An and said, “Big brother Zu, you should go first. I don’t want you to see me change into that appearance.”

Over the course of the competition, Peng Wuyan had become famous for two things. The first was that she was strong, and the other was that she was ugly. Qiu Honglei hadn’t really cared before, since her identity hadn’t been exposed; however, now that Zu An knew, she naturally didn’t want to leave her lover with any bad impressions.

At first, Zu An wanted to explain himself to Yun Jianyue, but with how things were, he couldn't really do anything. He could only say goodbye.

…

When Zu An returned to his courtyard on Violet Mountain, Xie Daoyun sat up and called out, “Who is it?” Zu An’s entry had clearly triggered the defense formations she set up.

“It’s me,” Zu An replied.

“Big brother Zu!” Xie Daoyun exclaimed happily. She pushed away her covers and welcomed him. She was dressed in silk pajamas. Together with her drowsy eyes and slightly messy hair, she looked especially lovely and adorable.

With her upbringing, she definitely wouldn’t ever show such a personal side in front of anyone else. Even in front of another woman, she would make sure to retain perfect etiquette, let alone a man! But after being around Zu An for so long, she had gradually gotten used to it.

“I was worried that you might have ended up being kidnapped by the wolves on this mountain,” Zu An remarked.

“Big brother Zu is so mean! There are no wolves on this mountain,” Xie Daoyun said, her face turning red. “But I was actually worried about you after you left for a few days.”

“Don’t worry. Nothing major happened, and I’ve already dealt with everything,” Zu An said as he gave her a rough account of what had happened in Yi Commandery. Xie Daoyun was incredibly shocked as she listened. She hadn’t expected Yi Commandery’s governor to do such a thing.

“Right, has anything happened on Violet Mountain?” Zu An asked.

“Nothing really. We still haven’t found Emptiness Isle’s Peng Wuyan. Elder Peng seems to have disappeared too,” Xie Daoyun said. She thought for a bit before continuing, “Right, Watchful Heart Peak seemed to have had some activity. Some of the test formations I left behind there were destroyed, but when I went over to check them, I didn’t notice anything. I only know that a battle happened there. Even though it was covered up, if it could destroy a formation I secretly set up, it definitely couldn’t have been on a small scale. But no one else even sensed such a battle, so I’m starting to question my own judgment.”

“Oh? There was an extremely intense battle, but no one noticed anything?” Zu An asked in surprise. Violet Mountain had been quite an eventful place recently. He decided to take a look.

Xie Daoyun suggested accompanying him, but he refused her suggestion. She was dressed in her pajamas and had been sleeping soundly before, so there was no need to disturb her.

…

Meanwhile, in Jadefall Palace, Pei Mianman was sleeping. Suddenly, she woke up and shouted, “Who is it?”

“Looks like you’re still pretty vigilant,” a woman said with a laugh. “Even I’m starting to feel something. No wonder that brat likes you so much.”
