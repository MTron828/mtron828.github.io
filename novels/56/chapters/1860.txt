Chapter 1809: Drive Away the Tiger to Swallow the Wolf

Wang Youjun was stunned, but he still took out a large melon from his bag. He didn’t need to use a blade; with just a casual wave of his hand, the melon was instantly divided.

Sun En took one piece and said with a smile, “A melon to eat, a show to enjoy; what a wonderful time.”

He had spent countless years on an island far out at sea, and in order to sustain his life, he had been forced to limit his own energy consumption to the absolute lowest amount. He had already missed the joys of living as a normal human being for far too long. Now that there was a chance to do so, he naturally had to enjoy it properly.

He gestured for Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun to take a slice to eat. After some hesitation, they could only accept a piece each. For some reason, however, the sweet melon tasted bland to them. They even felt that it was a bit bitter.

Zang Ao’s gaze landed on Zu An’s arm that was buried in Jing Teng’s soft chest, and he noticed that Zu An didn’t move away at all. His expression immediately became terrifyingly dark.

When he saw the women’s murderous glares, Zu An only felt a shiver run through his body. He had to at least say something in such a situation. As such, he took the chance to ask, “Guild Leader Zang, there seemed to be a white-clad woman with you, right?”

Chu Chuyan immediately perked up her ears.

White-clad woman? And who is this new vixen?

I really have become a bit estranged from Ah Zu these years… I’ve given these women too many opportunities.

Zang Ao was stunned, but he still replied, “Miss Yan went to carry out another mission, so she isn’t here.”

“Miss Yan?” the women exclaimed. Between the woman’s name and her white clothes, they immediately realized that Zang Ao was talking about Yan Xuehen.

Chu Chuyan’s face reddened. 

So it was master… If Master found out that I thought of her as a vixen to guard against, she would probably just give me a beating…

Pei Mianman watched her reaction with amusement.

Silly girl, you’ve already been cheated on by your master, and yet you have no idea.

It’s still my own master who is the safest…

As soon as she thought of that, she became a bit embarrassed. She just felt that it was a bit disrespectful to her master.

Yun Jianyue raised a brow.

There’s information on that stone cold woman too? Even so, why didn’t that woman just come here, insisting on carrying out some mission instead? How silly.

Zu An had a grave expression, however. Yan Xuehen had told him that she would stay at this guild leader's side to investigate the highest-level bounty, so why was she suddenly carrying out another mission? Had something happened to her?

Just then, Zang Ao asked Jing Teng, “Tengteng, is this the man you like? You’re holding onto him right now, and yet he’s thinking about another woman.”

Chu Chuyan was a bit upset when she heard Zang Ao imply that kind of relationship existed between Zu An and her master. However, before they fully understood the current situation, she didn’t want to expose their relationship as master and disciple so he wouldn’t be able to use that to threaten them.

Zang Ao’s gaze then swept over Chu Chuyan, Pei Mianman, and the other girls. His eyes were full of shock as he continued, “And he has so many women; he’s clearly the fickle sort. You’re quite the prideful person, so why are you mixing with them and playing this game of love rivalry?”

Even he was getting jealous. These women were all absolutely stunning, and not a single one was inferior to Jing Teng. And yet, all of these goddesses were surrounding a single man. Just what in the world had he done for them to make them all submit to him?

You have successfully trolled Zang Ao for +688 +688 +688…

Now, even Chu Chuyan and the other women were stunned. 

Indeed, which one of them wasn’t a stunning beauty? They normally had endless pursuers, yet they had all ended up falling for the same man. Now, they were always feeling wronged and fighting each other enviously.

Why do I have to do all of this? For what reason?

Their gazes inadvertently landed on Zu An. The unhappiness they felt gradually disappeared, replaced by warm smiles.

Jing Teng took a deep breath as she replied, “Because I like him. It’s just that simple.” I don’t like other people, so it’s meaningless no matter how great they treat me.

The other women all looked at Jing Teng. They hadn’t expected her emotions for Zu An to be that strong. Based on their brief interaction, they had already learned that she had only met Zu An in this world. In total, less than a month had passed, so how had her feelings for Zu An already become this strong? Was Zu An really just a natural magnet for all women?

Qiu Honglei gritted her teeth so hard they hurt a bit, thinking, These two were for real after all!

More importantly, it was all happening right in front of her eyes. The glorious Devil Sect witch only ever stole the husbands of others, and yet this time, she actually had her man stolen right out from under her. Just who was the Devil Sect witch here? In that instant, she felt a powerful sense of defeat, as if she had learned all her charm skills, methods of seducing men, and ways of making other women furious with envy for nothing.

However, when she recalled how Jing Teng had helped her receive Immortal Ruler Baopu’s inheritance, she couldn't really act up either.

Hmph, I’ll lend you Ah Zu for a few days out of respect for what you did earlier.

We Devil Sect witches have always attached great importance to gratitude and grudges alike. We’re not as superficial as those of the so-called righteous faction. We aren’t that fake.

Hm? Why is master giving me that dirty look?

Zu An was also looking at Jing Teng in surprise. Judging from her tone, it didn’t sound as if she was pretending. Because of what had happened with the ghost bride, their relationship had always been a bit ambiguous. However, neither of them had exposed each other.

Perhaps the first ‘confession’ on the mountain could be explained away as a mere excuse to fool Zang Ao, but after the second time, one would have to be an absolute ignorant fool to not sense the strong feelings behind them.

Zu An felt warm inside and he instinctively held Jing Teng’s hand.

When their fingers interlocked, Jing Teng’s heart began beating quickly. She thought, This dull man has finally found some sense. Just how did he end up with so many beauties around him? Don’t tell me it was always the women who made the first move?

When he saw their fingers intertwining, Zang Ao’s expression became grim.

You have successfully trolled Zang Ao for +567 +567 +567…

“In that case, then I wish the two of you happiness,” he spat.

Zu An replied with a smile, “Don’t worry. We’ll definitely be extremely happy in the future.”

There was naturally no need to treat a trashy man with too much courtesy. Zang Ao had left Jing Teng feeling this way for a very long time, so Zu An had to step forward.

Zang Ao was stunned. He couldn't help but feel that Zu An was taunting him on purpose, yet he was in a situation where he couldn't really say anything, even though he couldn't just remain silent. He could only harrumph to express his anger.

You have successfully trolled Zang Ao for +748 +748 +748…

He took a deep breath and turned to Sun En, saying, “Sect Master Sun, I’ve already asked what I wanted to ask. You can do as you please.”

Sun En placed the finished melon peel in Wang Youjun’s hand. He had already eaten quite a few pieces.

How sweet.

Brat, it seems retribution is fair to everyone!

However, he still didn’t forget his objective. He said, “An immortal aura appeared here earlier. Just what happened?”

Zu An looked at Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun before saying, “Sect master, please let the two of them go first, and then I’ll tell you.”

Yun Jianyue’s complexion became a bit better.

Looks like this kid still has a bit of a conscience.

Xie Daoyun was now a bit embarrassed. Her mission had brought her big brother Zu so much trouble. Most importantly, the other women had seen all of it… How shameful.

At least I have Sect Master Yun with me.

Sun En chuckled and said, “Brat, since I know you care about them, then how can I just let them go? Hurry up and speak, or else I can’t ensure their safety.”

Zu An replied with a sigh, “The sect master has already seen that someone here doesn’t want me to tell you. Whether I speak or not, I’ll end up offending one side. Why must sect master trouble me? If you really pressure me that far, I can only respect Teng’er’s thoughts.”

Jing Teng immediately smiled when she heard the words ‘Teng’er’.

The other women subconsciously rubbed their arms.

Ah… How cringy… 

You have successfully trolled the women for +99 +99 +99…

Yun Jianyue knew he was saying that to seize some negotiating power, but she still didn’t feel happy about it. 

Are you really going to abandon past friendships for a new relationship?

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +666 +666 +666…

When he saw the ridiculous amount of Rage points, Zu An began to wonder whether to let the women gather more often in the future. That way, he wouldn’t even have to worry about gaining Rage points at all anymore.

However, he quickly discarded that thought. A hellish battlefield wasn’t so easily traversed. A single mistake and he would be done for!

Which of these women wasn’t extremely outstanding? If they snapped out of their daze and didn’t attack each other, instead turning their spears toward him, not even ten layers of skin would be enough to flay off from the torture!

“Are you threatening me?” Sun En retorted, narrowing his eyes. A hint of lightning flickered, lighting up the tomb.

This guy is a lightning element user? Zu An thought, realizing something before replying, “Sect master misunderstands. Your respected self’s cultivation is so high, while none of us here could hope to be your opponent. Even if you temporarily let us go, if you’re dissatisfied with my answer, you can still easily catch us again.”

Sun En sized him up. This guy didn’t have any cultivation aura and looked just like a normal person. He wondered just where the guy got the confidence to remain so calm. In contrast, the women at his side had some cultivation. It seemed that this guy was nothing more than a mooch. However, that level of confidence in mooching was something unique in itself.

Zang Ao lost to someone like this? Interesting.

He thought to himself that no matter how high the women’s cultivation ranks were, they couldn’t surpass Yun Jianyue, who was at his side. As such, that guy couldn't really cause much trouble.

As such, with a wave of his hand, a gentle force sent Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun over. He then said, “Your people have been returned. If you dare to deceive me, I will show you what it means to wish you were dead.”

Afterward, Wang Youjun took out a talisman that flowed with light. It could detect whether one was lying or not.

Zu An didn’t hide anything and quickly told Sun En about everything that had happened. Then, he mentioned that the Baopu Sutra had been seized by Zhao Han.

Sun En looked at the talisman. Wang Youjun nodded slightly, showing that what Zu An said was true.

“Why didn’t you speak earlier?!” Sun En exclaimed, shooting Zu An a hateful glare. Then, with a flash, he ran in the direction Zhao Han had gone in.

Zu An sighed in relief. He had finally managed to send one away. Still, he couldn't help but look at Zang Ao before asking, “Why aren’t you chasing after it too? You should understand that I wasn’t lying.”

“Why do I have to chase after them? I only came here for Tengteng to begin with,” Zang Ao said with a mocking smile, staring at Jing Teng.
