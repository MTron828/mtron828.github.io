Chapter 1455: Body and Soul Reunited

The way the woman was dressed gave off a wild and unruly aesthetic. The cloth bound around her chest only made it seem more impressive, and her waist wasn’t as soft-looking and weak as that of other women; instead, she appeared full of explosive strength. Between that and her firm bottom and long legs, the feeling she gave off was of vigor and liveliness. However, her appearance wasn’t boorish; rather, she looked extremely beautiful. Despite her valiant and formidable outward appearance, she also had a charming side.

Yu Yanluo and the other women’s shock came from the fact that the beautiful woman was actually exactly the same as the Mo Xi Zu An had summoned! Their eyes wandered between her and Mo Xi, before they finally realized that there was indeed a difference. The expression in Mo Xi’s eyes was a bit sluggish and distant, while this woman’s gaze was extremely intelligent, and even a bit… flirtatious.

The woman eventually noticed the group as well. She called out with a sneer, “Who dares disturb me in my elegant state of mind?”

Her voice was somewhat coquettish, and yet also had a capable and experienced air to it. It matched her outward appearance well.

“Elegant state of mind?” Yu Yanluo and the other women repeated with strange expressions. Do you mean tearing silk? What kind of strange hobby is that?

Even someone as wealthy as Yu Yanluo frowned when she saw the other woman tear up precious silk like that. It was just too much of a waste.

The woman reached out with a hand, and the surrounding silk all flew off to one side so it didn’t block her field of view. She was about to say something when she suddenly saw Mo Xi on the other side, leaving her stunned.

Zu An cried out bitterly inside and quickly recalled Mo Xi.

However, that woman had already seen her. Her brows shot up and she exclaimed, “How daring! You dare create a puppet like that? Are you from the Shaman clan or the Ghost clan?”

Zu An shivered. Do both of those clans have puppet-creation methods? However, he didn’t have time to think about those things anymore, as countless silks lashed out to attack him.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The three women were shocked. The other woman was extremely beautiful, and yet in that instant, the power she had displayed actually reached the earth immortal level! Were earth immortals nothing more than dogs here?

Of course, they knew it was because they were inside an Unknown Region. After all, they had even seen deities, so there was no point in getting all startled over the appearance of an earth immortal.

Zu An quickly moved out of the way. However, the silk seemed to have grown eyes, cutting off any potential avenue of escape. In an instant, his limbs were wrapped in silk, and his body was suspended in midair like a 大 character.

“Ah Zu!” The three women cried out in alarm and quickly rushed forward to help him.

Suddenly, a blast of flames surged from Zu An’s body, burning the silk to ashes and allowing him to escape.

The woman’s brows rose again. She was about to attack when Zu An quickly summoned Mo Xi again, exclaiming, “She isn’t a puppet I made, but rather someone I encountered! She’s my friend!”

The other woman frowned when she saw that, but she didn’t attack again. However, Yan Xuehen and the others remained vigilant, ready to fight together with Zu An at any time.

The woman’s figure flickered, and a second later, she instantly reappeared next to Mo Xi, carefully examining her.

Zu An thought to himself, As expected. Now, Mo Xi is meeting her real self.

No wonder Shun had told him to come to Nanchao. It turned out Mo Xi was here! Her skill just happened to work for severing all sorts of contracts. The Fiend Emperor’s Puppet Curse was naturally a kind of contract too.

However, Mo Xi was from an age after Shun, so why didShun know of her existence? Could it be that it was because they were all in the same world, and Shun happened to see her while roaming around?

Furthermore, he had read all sorts of science fiction novels in his previous world that said that two copies of the same person couldn’t exist in the same world. If they met, there was a high chance that they would be destroyed. However, the two Mo Xis were staring at each other face to face, and yet nothing strange seemed to have happened!

All sorts of thoughts filled his mind. Meanwhile, the other woman was also shocked to see someone who looked exactly the same as her. She had initially thought that it was a puppet, but upon closer observation, u didn’t seem to be one. Weren’t they completely identical?

“Why doesn’t she have a soul?” the woman asked. Her cultivation rank was extraordinary and she immediately noticed what was strange about Mo Xi.

“I don’t know either. She was like this when I saw her,” Zu An replied. He thought for a bit before asking, “Could it be that her soul is inside you?”

The woman immediately erupted into rage, snapping, “Damn brat, are you courting death?!”

You have successfully trolled Mo Xi for +444 +444 +444…

When he saw the name, Zu An thought, It really was Mo Xi, as expected!

“Huh? I seem to be able to sense a sliver of a leftover soul inside her. It is indeed me…” the woman said with a frown. She reached out a hand and placed it on Mo Xi, as if she were trying to read her memories. Her expression immediately changed drastically. Then, she looked at Zu An with increased interest.

Zu An didn’t know what she had seen, but either way, he had never done anything bad to Mo Xi. He said, “What I’m saying is that she might be… how you end up in the future. You might have encountered something that caused your soul to go missing, turning you into this.”

The woman frowned. This time, she didn’t say anything in response. She seemed to be thinking about just what kind of danger she could have encountered, for her to even lose her soul.

Zu An suddenly realized the issue too. Why had Mo Xi been able to live for so long? Even Shun had vanished into nothing; and yet she was still here, and still so strong. She clearly wasn’t an immortal!

The woman waved her hand. Zu An felt as if a thread connected to him had been severed, and he lost his connection to Mo Xi. He was shocked and angry, exclaiming, “What are you doing?!”

“Taking back my body, of course!” the woman replied, shooting him a cold look. “Who knows what kind of despicable things you’ll do if you keep her around you?”

Zu An was speechless.

Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue wanted to laugh, but they didn’t dare to. Zu An already had so many beauties around him. Losing one wasn’t too big of a deal.

However, Yan Xuehen panicked. This was related to whether or not the ‘Love Is More Solid than Gold’ skill would be undone! If Zu An lost Mo Xi, didn’t that mean she had no hope left?

Zu An almost vomited blood. He really was losing a lot this time! Not only had he not obtained anything, he had even lost a valkyrie. Shun, that freaking bastard!

He made up his mind to fight, but the woman gave him a look, as if she knew what he was thinking. She snapped, “What, you want to fight?”

Zu An finally became clear-headed again. Even if they worked together and used all of their trump cards, they could only barely come out ahead at best. They could even die here. There really was no need to go that far for just a valkyrie. Furthermore, now that his contract with Mo Xi had been cut, it would be useless even if he seized her back. He couldn't tell her to do anything anymore.

He could only say, “Since you took something from me, please help me with something. I have a Puppet Curse placed on me, and also…”

Yan Xuehen’s heart almost shot out of her chest. If Yun Jianyue and Yu Yanluo found out, wouldn’t that be complete social suicide?

Fortunately, the woman cut him off, saying, “I’m taking back my own body, so I don’t owe you. Why should I help you?”

Zu An was speechless.

When she saw Zu An’s furious expression, the woman said, “Fine, I guess you did help me, so I’ll give you a chance. If you can help me find Yi Yin[1], I’ll agree to help you.”

Zu An was now really pissed. These guys kept ordering him around to do a bunch of things without upholding their ends of the promise! He was about to protest when he suddenly thought of something. Yi Yin?

He couldn't help but ask, “Is Yi Yin still in this world?”

“That, I don’t know. If I could find him, then why would I need your help?” the woman replied, then waved her hand to chase them out. “I’ve already told you the condition. Whether or not you want to do it is up to you.”

After saying that, she became completely focused on studying Mo Xi. It was as if she were touching her own body. She looked somewhat moved, and even her hands were shaking a bit.

Yun Jianyue secretly said to Zu An, “Little An, that woman isn’t a physical body, but rather a soul. She might very well be the soul that female servant of yours is missing.”

Zu An was startled. This woman is just a soul?

No wonder nothing strange had happened when she met Mo Xi. It was because they were the same person; one body, one soul! The woman’s every action was too realistic, to the point where he couldn't tell it at all. But now that they had interacted so closely, it couldn’t escape the notice of a grandmaster like Yun Jianyue.

1. He was a Chinese politician who served as a minister of the early Shang dynasty, one of the honored officials of the era. He helped Tang of Shang, the founder of the Shang dynasty, to defeat King Jie of Xia. ☜
