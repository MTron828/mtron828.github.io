Chapter 1389: Saved

Yan Xuehen proficiently separated his lips, then passed Lord Sui’s Pearl to him. Because she was worried that he could choke on the pearl due to being unconscious, she didn’t dare to leave him alone. She continued to help him control the pearl.

As the pearl’s power spread through Zu An’s mouth, he gradually woke up. His eyes met Yan Xuehen’s. A warm feeling spread inside him. Looks like she doesn’t treat me as coldly as she acts on the outside after all. When he remembered what had happened in the hot springs, he instinctively returned the kiss with his tongue.

Yan Xuehen instantly felt as if a streak of electricity had passed through her entire body. She instinctively pulled back in fright. Her normally snow-white cheeks turned entirely red. The memory of their bodies wrapped intimately around each other in the Great Snowy Mountains couldn't help but reappear in her mind. Her heart pounded crazily.

“Not bad, stone cold woman. I didn’t expect you to actually be so bold!” Yun Jianyue remarked, patting her shoulder. Even though she had a teasing tone in her voice, however, for some reason she just couldn't feel happy. She felt a kind of disappointment, as if her favorite toy had been stolen.

Seeing that Yu Yanluo was also looking at her with a strange expression, Yan Xuehen quickly shot Yun Jianyue a glare and snapped, “Witch, what kind of nonsense are you saying? This is a matter of life and death right now, so saving his life is the most important thing right now. Why would I be so inflexible?”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “I refuse to believe that you would do the same for another man.”

Unlike Yun Jianyue, who was just instinctively trying to annoy Yan Xuehen with her rough and straightforward nature, Yu Yanluo was more sensitive to certain things. When she put together all of the things that had happened before, she suddenly realized that the relationship between Yan Xuehen and Zu An wasn’t necessarily as simple as before. However, since this was a matter related to Zu An’s life, she didn’t have the luxury of worrying about that.

Meanwhile, Zu An was listening to Mi Li’s nagging. “Tsk tsk tsk, you really are a womanizer. All of the pretty women around you seem to have something with you.”

Zu An quickly explained, “Of course not.”

“What, are you talking about that haughty Devil Sect Master? In my opinion, there’s something fishy with the way she looks at you too,” Mi Li said with a sneer.

“I was talking about you. The most beautiful woman here is, of course, big sis empress. Aren’t we completely innocent?” Zu An replied with an upright expression.

“Hmph, you dare to even flirt with me? Also, call me master!” Mi Li replied. Even though she knew Zu An was praising her on purpose, she still couldn't help but grin. At the same time, however, she remembered what had happened back then in Brightmoon City’s secret dungeon. She sighed, thinking, Just who’s innocent…

Zu An quickly asked her some questions when he saw that she had suddenly fallen silent. He still had many questions about the Taowu and resentment energy, but there was no response for a long time. However, he didn’t have the time to think too much about it. Yu Yanluo couldn't hold on for much longer and he needed to help her quickly.

The mountaintop got closer and closer, and the resentment’s corrosive effects became faster to match it. The black scales had begun to reach all their chins. That made it so the amount of time each person could hold onto Lord Sui’s Pearl lessened. As such, they could only hold it for three breaths before they had to switch it.

Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue were still alright, as they only had to pass it on to women. However, the pearl soon returned to Yan Xuehen again. When she saw Zu An’s ambiguous smile, her small face immediately turned completely red. She thought to herself, This guy must be feeling really proud of himself, huh?

However, their lives were hanging by a thread at the moment, so she didn’t dare to waste any time and could only kiss him again. This time, Zu An was awake, so she was especially embarrassed. And this bastard stuck out his tongue!

She wanted to move out of the way, but she was no match at all for him. His methods were way too trained. Who knew how many girls he had practiced this stuff on before her?

She strangely felt a bit angry when she thought of that, and immediately pushed him away.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +222 +222 +222…

Zu An was startled. Looks like she’s still a bit shy. Doing this to her in front of everyone else really is a bit embarrassing.

Yu Yanluo’s expression was strange. She thought to herself, Why do I feel so wronged? She had to watch her man kiss other women in front of her. Even though they were doing this to save each others’ lives, why did it feel so weird?

Meanwhile, Yun Jianyue was rejoicing in their misfortune. She asked, “Little An, how does our Goddess Yan taste? Do you know how many men in this world dream of what you’re doing, but will never even be able to get close? And yet, you managed to take advantage of it today.”

Zu An wanted to say that her lips were really soft and that the fragrance was incredible. But when he considered their situation, he still sensibly shut his mouth.

“Witch, no one will think of you as mute if you do not speak!” Yan Xuehen retorted, feeling ashamed and embarrassed.

“It’s my mouth. I can say whatever I want,” Yun Jianyue said smugly.

Yan Xuehen was seething with rage. This witch always angered her on purpose! When she saw Yu Yanluo move, she quickly took her spot. That way, the role of saving Zu An would be given to Yun Jianyue.

However, who would have thought that Yun Jianyue had already anticipated that? She quickly hugged Yu Yanluo and cried, “Hurry and save me, I’m about to die!”

Yu Yanluo was speechless. However, even though she knew it wasn’t that serious, there was nothing she could do. She could only continue the original sequence.

When she saw Yun Jianyue look at her with an evil smile again, Yan Xuehen turned beet red. When it was her turn to receive Lord Sui’s Pearl, she immediately returned it to Yun Jianyue after the resentment in her retreated a tiny bit. She wanted to change the order.

However, Yun Jianyue reacted quickly as well. She didn’t hold it for long at all before giving it to Yu Yanluo.

Zu An was speechless. He thought, I’m going to die if you don’t freaking pass it to me!

Yu Yanluo hadn’t expected that she would one day be tugged back and forth like a treasure by two grandmasters. However, she was more worried about her lover’s safety, so she quickly moved over to Zu An’s side to pass him the pearl.

Only when the refreshing feeling of Lord Sui’s Pearl spread through him did Zu An feel his muddle-headedness disappear a bit. Soon afterward, however, it was his turn to give it out.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yan Xuehen was stunned. After all of that, the only difference was that rather than her kissing Zu An, he had become the one to kiss her! Ah, I’m so freaking stupid…

Yu Yanluo spoke up just then, saying, “Big sis Yan, we’re doing this to survive. We’ve wronged you.”

She didn’t want what had happened before to happen again. If they had another accident and Zu An was beyond saving, she would really feel endless regret. As for whether or not there was really something between the two of them, she’d look into it slowly later.

When she heard Yu Yanluo, who actually had a relationship with Zu An, say that, Yan Xuehen knew that what had happened previously really was extremely dangerous. As such, she nodded and said, “Alright.”

Then, she closed her eyes and faced Zu An as if she were facing her execution.

Zu An asked gloomily, “Yanluo, why aren’t you saying that I’m the one being wronged here?”

Yan Xuehen’s eyes suddenly shot open and she stared at him.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +333 +333 +333…

Yu Yanluo was speechless.

This time, not even Yun Jianyue could continue watching. She remarked, “Kid, you’re already getting so many free benefits, and yet you actually said something like that? You really need a good beating!”

With that, Zu An finally stopped his mischief and obediently passed the pearl on. This time, however, Yan Xuehen was quite proactive, giving him a fierce bite.

Zu An was in so much pain tears almost came out, but he didn’t dare to let the women around him see it. He could only keep all of it as a pent-up grievance.

Yan Xuehen finally felt a bit better when she saw him grimace in pain.

…

Just like that, their group eventually arrived at the mountaintop. What they saw there was a clear spring. It wasn’t too large; it was more like an ancient well. The water inside was incredibly clear. Most importantly, there was rich ki coming out of it. For the first time, the area around it contained none of the powerful resentment. The party also noticed that the black scales around them no longer continued to grow.

Mi Li said in Zu An’s mind, “Hurry and jump into this spring. Otherwise, there won’t be any way to get rid of the resentment if it remains in your body for too long.”

Zu An trusted her unconditionally. When he heard that, he also repeated it to the three women.

Yu Yanluo was one thing, but Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were stunned.

It was such a small space, and they were going to all bathe together…
