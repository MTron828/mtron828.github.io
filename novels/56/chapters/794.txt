Chapter 773: Paying Respects as a Disciple

Translator: Pika

Meanwhile, Zu An was completely baffled. Jiang Luofu was also that libationer’s disciple? Why had he never heard about this before?

After all, her strength had left him with a deep impression back in Brightmoon City. He hadn’t expected her to be the libationer’s disciple as well, and ranked eighth no less. It was easy to guess how extraordinary the libationer was based on that.

Jiang Luofu seemed to have snapped out of her daze and replied to Zu An with a smile, “Oh, did I forget to mention that?”

Zu An was speechless. Jiang Luofu was a bit embarrassed as well. She chuckled and said, “It’s just that you never asked. If I talked about it first, it would seem as if I were showing off or something.”

The fatty’s eyes lit up. “Eighth sister’s words truly inspire me as a logician! Why don’t you transfer to our department? I can give senior sister my position and become the number two here. Of course, if you’re willing, we can get married too, and both occupy this top position together…”

Jiang Luofu’s reply was straightforward. “Get lost!”

The chubby Yin Shi didn’t get mad, and instead said with a smile, “Eighth sister’s words aren’t too precise. In which direction do you want me to leave?”

“Back to wherever you crawled from.” Jiang Luofu’s eyes twitched. She was clearly getting more and more irritated by the second.

“To go where I came from? Eighth sister really is wise. You really have karma with our logician department!” Yin Shi exclaimed with a deep sigh.

Zu An said with a smile, “I finally understand why you wanted to run earlier.” This fellow really loved to argue, and he was incredibly hard to get rid of too. Who could handle such a thing?

Only now did Yin Shi notice Zu An and ask, “Hm? And this one is?” Then, his eyes shifted to Zu An and Jiang Luofu’s clasped hands. His mustache almost jumped up to his eyes. “Oh? Eighth sister actually found a lover? Everyone knows how you’ve rejected every man all these years. We almost thought that you had a birth defect down there or something. Now, all of us brothers can finally feel relieved.”

Jiang Luofu’s face darkened. Her fists clenched so tightly they began to crack. “Damn fatty, are you asking for a beating?”

Yin Shi hurriedly waved his hands. “A gentleman uses his hands, not his fists. Violence would really be too uncouth.”

Jiang Luofu laughed coldly and retorted “I’m a woman, not a gentleman.”

“The academy strictly prohibits fights. Especially with statuses like ours, it would cause too much of a commotion if we really fought. Teacher might put us in detention! With my personality, I really wouldn’t be able to tolerate an isolation room where I had no one to talk to!” Yin Shi exclaimed.

Jiang Luofu’s expression changed. She clearly had some lingering fears toward that isolation room too.

“How about this? I’ve been quite distressed about something. If eighth sister can answer my question, then I’ll willingly go back to where I came from, and I won’t bother you anymore,” Yin Shi said with a giggle.

Jiang Luofu’s eyes twitched. “Compared to debating you, I think the isolation room might be a bit better.”

“Come on, you’re exaggerating! Who knows, you might be able to help me with my problem quickly.” Yin Shi was scared that she would refuse and quickly said, “I’ve been studying a theory recently… A bird’s shadow never moves. Does eighth sister feel that my statement is reasonable?”

Jiang Luofu’s expression was stormy. “Like hell it’s reasonable; of course a bird’s shadow moves! Wherever the bird moves, its shadow naturally follows it wherever it goes.”

Zu An couldn’t help but laugh. It seemedJiang Luofu really was annoyed to death by this guy. She never spoke like this usually.

“Oh, but that may not be, you see.” Yin Shi had a complacent smile on his face. He shook his head and said, “The bird’s shadow isn’t moving, because the bird and the shadow are linked together. New shadows are produced, while old shadows fade. It merely creates an illusion of moving.”

Jiang Luofu’s eyebrows rose. She really wanted to curse at him, but she knew that talking was this guy’s forte, and she would be the one to suffer more. As such, she took a deep breath and calmed down, saying, “Alright, then what you said makes sense. This research topic is also extremely valuable. We’ll leave first.” She pulled Zu An over behind her and began to leave.

However, Yin Shi stopped them. “Eighth sister, please don’t be in such a hurry! Please tell me which parts are reasonable. I still haven’t figured out how this theory can be used in practice.”

Jiang Luofu was stunned. Zu An quickly rushed out to stop her when he saw that she was on the verge of erupting. He looked at the fatty in front of him and said, “Um… This brother over here has a similar question for you.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Yin Shi’s eyes lit up as he said excitedly, “Little brother, please ask.”

Jiang Luofu frowned. She transmitted her voice and said, “Stop arguing against him, you won’t win.”

Zu An gave her a look that suggested ‘don’t worry’, and then continued, “When you walk by the lakeside in the evening, a bright moon hangs overhead. You’ll find that the inverted image of the moon in the lake follows you as you walk. Are there countless figures in the lake, or is there only a single moon that follows you?”

Yin Shi replied, “Of course it’s a single moon. According to my theory just now, the moon’s reflection has never even moved.”

Zu An smiled and said, “Suppose that there’s only one; then what about the person on the other side of the lake? Can it be that he won’t be able to see the same inverted image? In his eyes, that moon has always been following him, and the position of that moon is different from the one you see.”

“Hm? Interesting…” Yin Shi continued to stroke his beard. “Then are there many of them?”

“Then if we say that there are many, why can you only see one?” Zu An asked.

“This…” Yin Shi was at a loss.

The surrounding students’ eyes widened in shock. Even Jiang Luofu found it inconceivable. This was the first time in all these years that she had seen Yin Shi stumped. When he saw that, Zu An smiled. He grabbed Jiang Luofu’s hand and left with her.

Jiang Luofu’s face turned red. This kid really has no respect! She had only grabbed his hand just now because she’d wanted to avoid this terrible situation. Now, they were just leaving normally, so why was he holding her hand?

Yin Shi scratched his head in frustration. When he saw the two of them were already getting away, he could no longer hold himself back. He rushed over to Zu An’s side and said, “Kid, then how many moon reflections are there? If you don’t know either, you were just messing with me! I won’t forgive you easily for that!”

Jiang Luofu took a step forward to protect Zu An. “Damn fatty, who are you trying to intimidate?”

Yin Shi immediately smiled and said, “Eighth sister, please don’t take offense. It’s just that I really am curious and hope that your little brother here can give me an answer. Otherwise, my pride will really be hurt here.”

Zu An patted Jiang Luofu’s hand, gesturing to indicate that it was okay. Then, he walked forward and said, “According to Quantum Bayesianism, whether the reflection exists or not relies on whether there’s a person there to observe it. If you’re the only one there, then there’s one reflection. If there are multiple people, then there are many reflections.”

Yin Shi was stunned. “Who is ‘Quantum Bayesianism’?”

Zu An said, “Quantum theory comes from a great genius. In this universe, there are many things that exist in a certain and uncertain state simultaneously. As for which form they will show themselves in, that depends on the observer…” He gave this fellow a rough account of everything he had learned from the web about quantum theory.

Yin Shi was frowning at first, but soon afterward, his eyes shone brilliantly. He mumbled to himself, “So that’s what it is, so that’s what it is… I seem to have new ideas about many things that have stumped me for so long…”

He put away his mischievous smile and cupped his hands in respect to Zu An. “If I ever gain enlightenment one day, then it will definitely be because of sir today. Please receive three kowtows from me.” Then, he kowtowed three times in respect.

Those students who had wanted to join in on the liveliness felt their eyes almost pop out of their sockets. What the hell is going on? Mr. Yin Shi is the libationer’s core disciple! He has tremendous status in the academy, yet he actually bowed as a disciple toward this young fella?

The students began to whisper among themselves.

“Where did this guy come from?”

“I have no idea. I only know that he came with Ms. Jiang.”

“Then is he Ms. Jiang’s newest disciple?”

“That’s impossible! Not even Ms. Jiang can win in a debate with Mr. Yin, so how could her disciple win?”

“You’re right… Then is he Ms. Jiang’s lover?”

“Look, they’re even holding hands. I didn’t expect Ms. Jiang to be such a cougar…”

“Sigh, if she is, then I want her to come after my young self too…”

The students were whispering all types of things, but Jiang Luofu couldn’t be bothered to get upset right now. Instead, she looked at Yin Shi in shock, asking, “Have you gone mad? Why would you bow toward a kid younger than you?”

Yin Shi said with a firm expression, “In the path of pursuing the truth, those who have greater achievements come first. Why is there a need to cling rigidly to age?” Then, he gave Zu An an eager look. “May I ask sir what your name is? If there is a chance, I wish to consult sir for more guidance.”
