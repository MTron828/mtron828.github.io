Chapter 1203: A Woman Is Born to Leave Her Family

Zu An secretly examined his own condition. He saw that there wasn’t anything wrong and said with a chuckle, “I normally don’t eat the things others give me, but lady Little White is different.”

Little White blushed when she heard those familiar-sounding words. She replied, “Big brother Zu is so bad; you’re always teasing me.”

Zu An chuckled and asked, “Didn’t you tease me first?”

Just then, he suddenly felt several waves of heat nourish his damaged blood vessels. He was a bit surprised. The medicine’s effects seemed to be a bit better than even Divine Physician Ji’s Soul Return Pill. Divine Physician Ji’s medical arts were undoubtedly great, but the Soul Return Pill was mainly for those under the master rank. The higher one’s cultivation was, the weaker the effects were.

“This pill’s effects seem to be surprisingly good. Thank you,” Zu An said, unable to hold back his gratitude.

Little White’s eyes lit up. She replied, “Really? Then I’ll go and steal grandfather’s other… Ahem, I’ll bring the other one.”

Zu An was speechless. He quickly stopped her and said, “There’s no need; this single pill is enough.” If he really did empty out Elder White’s inventory, wouldn’t he really have offended the elder forever?

“I need to quickly adjust my ki so that I don’t waste the medicine’s effects,” Zu An said. He could feel the medicinal strength surging through his body. Losing even a bit would be a tremendous waste.

Even though his Primordial Origin Ki possessed terrifying regenerative powers, that regeneration also exhausted energy that needed to be replenished by relying on all sorts of treasures. Meanwhile, the medicine contained large amounts of life essence.

Little White offered, “How about I lend you a hand?”

Zu An was stunned. He had said that as a signal for her to leave. Who would’ve thought that this lass wouldn’t pick up on that, and would instead enthusiastically offer to help him?

Seeing how she had just come to offer him such a great pill, chasing her away just like that would make it seem as if he were immediately abandoning his benefactor after achieving his goal. As such, he agreed. “Then I’ll have to thank lady Little White.” He sat down cross-legged on the bed afterward, then began to use his ki to refine and absorb the surging medicinal strength in his body.

Little White looked a bit embarrassed when she saw him seated on the bed. However, she thought to herself that he was an upright and sincere man, so why was she having all kinds of random thoughts?

As such, she raised her dress and got onto the bed, sitting across from him. She reached out her hands and touched his palms, using her own ki to help him with his injuries. Her heart began to pound when they made physical contact. She could feel the heat coming from his body.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This was the first time Little White was able to observe Zu An from up close, as his eyes were closed and he was treating his own injuries. His strong and handsome features that made him look as if he were sculpted from marble were completely different from her peers in the clan, who had soft and reserved features.

A blush appeared on her cheeks as she continued to stare at him. His heroic figure during the day continued to appear in her mind. She stared blankly for a moment just like that.

Suddenly, Zu An opened his eyes. He looked at the young lady in front of him and asked in confusion, “Are you still not going to start?”

“Ah!” Little White made eye contact with him. She suddenly felt hot and lowered her head in fear, not daring to look at him again. She said hurriedly, “Let’s start.”

“Don’t be nervous; just relax. If you can’t take it anymore, tell me. Don’t injure your own foundation no matter what,” Zu An said, taking the lead. She was actually more of a hindrance than a help, but as a good man, how could he hurt the feelings of this young lady?

“Okay,” Little White replied. She pursed her thin lips and tried her best to pour her own ki into his body.

But the moment she made contact, she discovered that her ki was like a tiny trickle pouring into a raging sea. She felt a bit of regret. He could even win against the Golden Crow Crown Prince, and yet she was still trying to help him with his injuries. She was clearly overestimating her own abilities, wasn’t she?

She was about to pull away when Zu An’s ki wrapped around hers, slowly guiding her in helping him with his injuries.

How could Little White not know that he was taking care of her feelings, helping her participate deliberately? She sighed inwardly… What a warm and considerate man. No wonder the clan leader likes him so much.

She quickly straightened her back, doing her best to pour her own ki into his body, doing her best to offer a portion of her own strength. After some time, however, her mind began to waver. I seem to have become one with him…

Suddenly, she heard a knock outside. A voice called out, “Big brother Zu, big brother Zu, are you asleep yet?”

Little White jumped in fright, because she could tell that it was Little Blue. Zu An opened his eyes and was just about to reply, when Little White quickly said, “Don’t let her know I’m here.”

Zu An was stunned, asking, “Why?”

Little White was put on the spot. She had just told Little Blue that she wasn’t feeling too well and was going to her room to rest. If Little Blue found out that not only had she not gone back to her room, but she instead run over to Zu An’s side, what would she think then?

Of course, she couldn't say that to Zu An!

Seeing how she was acting, Zu An didn’t ask any further and called out toward the entrance, “Lady Little Blue, I’m currently nursing my injuries.”

“That’s good! I just brought over an incredible medicine. Hurry and open the door!” Little Blue cried. She began to pound on the door.

Thud thud thud~

In contrast to Little White’s bashfulness, Little Blue was clearly much more straightforward.

Zu An was dumbfounded. He had spoken tactfully, but his tone clearly indicated that it wasn’t a good time, right? But who would’ve thought that neither of these little girls seemed to be able to sense his intent to reject them?

Seeing that the door was about to be smashed open, Zu An could only say, “Please wait a moment.” Then, he lowered his voice and asked Little White, “Lady Little White, can you help me open the door?”

Little White blushed. She quickly shook her head and stood up, repeating, “Don’t tell her I’m here.” Then, she looked from side to side. She wanted to hide behind one of the dividers, but she then felt that she’d be discovered far too easily if she hid there. As such, she hid inside a wardrobe off to the side instead.

Zu An was speechless. They clearly hadn’t been doing anything improper, yet now, it seemed as if they were having an affair or something. But there was no time to stop her. Seeing that she had gone into hiding, he reached out his hand and opened the door through ki.

Standing in the doorway was a young lady clad in green. Compared to Little White, her expression was a bit more lively and playful. Seeing that the door had opened, she skipped her way over and called out sweetly, “Big brother Zu~”

Zu An smiled at her from the bed and said, “Miss Little Blue, I’m currently nursing my injuries, so I can’t get up to welcome you. I hope you don’t mind.”

“You don’t need to get up. I just came to visit you. How can I disturb your recovery?” Little Blue replied. She sat down casually on the bed and took out a case, saying, “Big brother Zu, I brought over the Myriad Flower Ointment my grandfather has treasured for many years. This medicine is incredibly useful for external injuries. You have so many wounds on you, so it’s the perfect medicine for you.”

Zu An couldn't help but laugh. Why did these little girls both love to steal their grandfathers’ greatest treasures? He replied, “Then I’ll have to thank lady Little Blue.”

Little Blue said, “The best medicine for treating internal injuries is with Grandpa White. I’ll try to see if I can steal… ahem, bring one out. Big brother Zu, you should treat your external injuries first.”

Zu An thought to himself, I already ate a Hundred Herb Pill. These two girls really are interesting.

Little Blue took out a lot of gauze from her inner pocket; she had clearly come prepared. She said, “Big brother Zu, take off your clothes.”

Zu An was dumbfounded.

Little Blue opened the Myriad Flower Ointment. A fragrance wafted through the room as she said, “Big brother Zu, you should focus on treating yourself. I’ll help you wrap up your injuries again.”

Zu An thought to himself, So that’s what it was… However, he replied, “That’s… I’m afraid that’s a bit inconvenient, isn’t it?”

“What’s inconvenient about that? I already saw everything during the day anyway. Is big brother Zu going to become shy now?” Little Blue teased. Her lips were especially tender and beautiful when she laughed, and her upbeat personality conveyed a pretty and flirtatious air. It was quite the unusual sensation.

Zu An was speechless. Never could he have expected to be teased like this by a little girl. But it was quite amusing; the two sisters’ personalities were entirely different. Little White was shy and reserved, while Little Blue was extremely lively. He could only reply, “Then I’ll have to trouble Little Blue.”

“You’re our Snake race’s distinguished guest. This is something we should be doing,” Little Blue said with a charming smile. “You should focus on your own healing; you don’t have to worry about anything else. I’ll take care of you.” As she spoke, she was already starting to help him remove his clothes.
