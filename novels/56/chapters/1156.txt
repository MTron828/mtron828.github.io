Chapter 1105: Male Honey Trap

“What a coincidence.” Zu An chuckled in embarrassment. Only then did he notice that Tang Tian’er finger was still on his lips, however, He quickly took a step back.

He really was depressed. Why am I experiencing one of those clichėd romantic drama scenes?!

“Exactly! What a coincidence. I was just on a stroll, and yet I ended up seeing young master Zu flirting with another beauty.” Pei Mianman had a big smile on her face. There wasn’t the slightest bit of anger in her expression. But Zu An knew she was getting angrier and angrier by the second, because the amount of Rage points coming in through the backend was rising exponentially.

Tang Tian’er raised a brow. Her sixth sense immediately told her that there was more to these two than met the eye. As such, she grabbed Zu An’s arm and asked, “Big brother Zu, who is this girl?” In reality, though, judging from the woman’s beauty and her distinct way of dressing, she already had a good guess as to who she was. She just pretended to not know anything.

Zu An coughed and said, “Ahem, this is Miss Pei, my good friend.”

He wasn’t scared of being honest about their relationship, but Pei Mianman had requested for him to keep it a secret. This world was a bit more open-minded than ancient China, but there was still a limit. Sleeping together before marriage would definitely have an effect on the girl. Meanwhile, the Pei clan wasn’t a small clan, so they would care about such things even more.

Even though Pei Mianman knew about their arrangement too, she still couldn't hold back her rage when she saw Zu An acting like this with another girl.

“Could this be young master Zu’s newest concubine?” she remarked as she walked over with a smile. Next to her, Hong Zao was still fuming. She couldn't understand why her master hadn't become hostile yet.

Tang Tian’er heard the sarcasm in Pei Mianman’s voice, directed toward her physical contact with Zu An. But she didn’t mind, and instead looked even more amused. These two… are interesting.

Zu An began to sweat buckets when he sensed the jealousy in their voices. He exclaimed, “Manman, you’re misunderstanding! She’s Zhenyuan Merchant Group’s Miss Tang, and we’re investigating a case! I have some things to ask her.”

“What are you explaining that to me for? Young master Zu can just do whatever you want.” Pei Mianman said emotionlessly.

Zu An was speechless. Didn’t you ask me who she was?

Tang Tian’er explained softly, “Miss Pei, Big Brother Zu and I really have nothing between us.”

Pei Mianman’s heart leaped. You’re even calling him Big Brother Zu, and yet you say there’s nothing going on between the two of you?

Hmph, you’re pretending to look all weak and pitiful. Are you trying to make me look like an intimidating villain who doesn’t understand?

Women were naturally sensitive toward the green tea bitch[1] behaviors of other girls. But even though she could see through all of that, she couldn't just become hostile on the spot. Otherwise people might look down on her. still, the more that was the case, the angrier she got.

You have successfully trolled Pei Mianman for +233 +233 +233…

Suddenly, Zu An sent her a ki transmission. “Manman, this woman is clearly trying to drive a wedge between us. Don’t fall for her tricks.”

Pei Mianman grinned when she heard his explanation. Hmph, at least this guy isn’t too stupid. She knew that he was on her side, so most of her anger disappeared. But she still fired back through ki transmission, “I don’t care if you’re investigating a case, but do you have to kiss her finger? Do you have to hold onto her that tightly?”

Zu An was speechless. Even though it was just a coincidence, those things had still happened. It really was a bit hard to explain…

Pei Mianman then began to relax. She began to size up Tang Tian’er with amusement. “Your legs are quite nice, but your chest is a bit small. Hmm, I guess you’re pretty enough; not too bad to keep around as a bed warmer. If you want to join his harem, you’ll have to get Chuyan’s personal approval first.”

Now it was Tang Tian’er’s turn to become speechless. Why the hell is this woman talking to me like a main wife talking to a concubine? But she reacted quickly as well, replying, “Is Miss Pei talking about Chu First Miss? But if I recall correctly, she has already divorced Big Brother Zu, right?”

“That was only done to fool others. The two of them are closer than ever.” Pei Mianman had only planned to amuse herself with the situation, but she couldn't help but feel a bit sour when she said that.

Tang Tian’er’s eyes shone as she continued, “But why does it feel as if Miss Pei is even more enthusiastic than Miss Chu?”

Pei Mianman obviously picked up on the mockery in her voice. Tang Tian’er was implying that the main wife hadn’t even said anything yet, so what kind of a relationship did a girl from the Pei clan have with Zu An, for her to speak out like this?

Because of Zu An’s explanation, however, she didn’t get angry. She instead replied with a smile, “It’s because Chuyan is my good friend, of course. She isn’t here, so I have to keep an eye on her husband. Otherwise, some vixens might just come after him.”

Zu An’s expression darkened. He had discovered that Pei Mianman really liked playing the role of Chu Chuyan’s close friend. It seemed to always bring her a sense of stimulation without fail.

Tang Tian’er was also left at a loss for words. Never had she expected this woman’s mental fortitude to be so great, and for her retaliation to be so vicious.

She was wondering what she should say when Pei Mianman said with a smile, “I still have to do my shopping, so the two of you can slowly enjoy your stroll. I won’t disturb you any longer.”

She bowed toward the two of them, then turned around to leave. When she walked past Zu An, she gave him an ambiguous smile. Zu An forced a smile in return. Even though Pei Mianman hadn’t said anything, her intentions were already clear enough.

…

When the master and servant left, Hong Zao finally couldn't hold herself back anymore. She asked, “Young miss, why did you leave just like that?”

“What, was I supposed to throw a tantrum and make a scene?” Pei Mianman replied with a chuckle.

“Young miss, how can you still laugh? That Tang girl is all over the young master, and she… even pressed her chest up against the young master’s arm! How shameless.” Hong Zao angrily voiced indignation for her master. She just felt as if her precious master had been tainted somehow. She continued, “The young master really is to blame too; he actually didn’t push her away.”

“He’s investigating a case. It’s natural for him to use a male honey trap,” Pei Mianman replied; she didn’t seem to mind. She continued, “I’m already relieved now that I’ve seen that he’s safe and sound.”

“So it was a honey trap! I was going to say, the young master is so great, so why would he be that kind of man?” Hong Zao nodded as if she suddenly understood.

Pei Mianman rolled her eyes. Looks like Zu An’s constantly feeding her is now doing work. Why do I have such a dummy for a maid? She even believed some random excuse I made up?

…

Meanwhile, Tang Tian’er had a pensive look on her face as she watched Pei Mianman and Hong Zao leave. She remarked, “Young master Zu, your relationship with Miss Pei seems to be quite good.”

“We were fellow students back in Brightmoon City, so we’re indeed quite close.” Zu An’s expression turned serious and he asked, “Miss Tang, why did you have to act like that earlier?”

Tang Tian’er naturally knew that he was unhappy. As such, she put on a sweet smile and began to act cute. “You know, I only did that because I like the young master too much. I got a bit jealous…”

“Oh? You like me?” Zu An replied, looking at her with scorching eyes.

Tang Tian’er’s heart skipped a beat, but she still maintained her smile and replied, “Of course I do.”

“That’s good then.” Zu An reached out and grabbed her waist, saying, “Let’s reserve a Jasper Lane room and properly get to know each other.” Then, he headed towards Jasper Lane.

Sure enough, Tang Tian’er began to panic. As someone who worked in a place like the Hub of Freedom, she obviously knew what Zu An meant. She leaped away and pleaded, “Young master Zu, I was wrong! I won’t do that again in the future…”

Zu An gave her an indifferent look, replying, “I don’t want to see a repeat of what just happened in the future.”

Tang Tian’er pursed her lips. In the end, she could only helplessly voice her agreement. However, Zu An finally revealed a smile and replied, “That’s better. We’re already friends, so isn’t it better to be a bit more sincere with each other?”

“Am I not sincere enough to you yet…” Tang Tian’er mumbled. She had already shown him everything in that bathtub. Of course, there was no way she would say that out loud.

Zu An had obviously thought of the same thing. His expression softened a bit when he looked at her, and he asked, “Alright, where do you want to go?”

Tang Tian’er’s eyes lit up. The cute dimples returned to her face as she replied, “Anywhere is okay, as long as it’s with you.”

Zu An frowned. He just felt that Tang Tian’er was acting a bit too close, but that she probably had an ulterior motive. But when he recalled how she had saved him last time, he felt that she had sacrificed a bit too much to have really done so all because of some ulterior motive.

…

Zu An accompanied Tang Tian’er around Cloudcenter City just like that, touring nearly half of the city.

Eventually, Tang Tian’er said meaningfully, “I feel really happy today. I’ve never felt so carefree in all these years.”

Zu An realized that whether it was the Hub of Freedom or the Zhenyuan Merchant Group, Tang Tian’er indeed didn’t have many opportunities to relax. He couldn't help but feel a bit of a soft spot for her. At her age, she would still be a carefree student in Zu An’s previous world. He said, “I’ll keep you company again in the future if there’s a chance.”

Tang Tian’er shook her head. She said somewhat emotionally, “There might not be a next time.”

Zu An was stunned. He was just about to ask why when Tang Tian’er spoke up again. “Alright, alright. I know you’ve wanted answers for a while now. You’ve been a bit absent-minded while you were around me, so I’ll just tell you. Jasper Lane’s boss is nothing but a figurehead. The real boss is the Pegasus Merchant Group.”

“The Pegasus Merchant Group?” Zu An had a strange expression as he spoke. These two merchant groups really were arch-enemies! They immediately threw dirt at each other whenever they had the chance.

Tang Tian’er sighed and replied, “I know what you’re thinking, but I’m really not speaking out of a personal grudge, and I really am trying to help you.” She continued, “Right, Pegasus Merchant Group’s background is quite formidable too, so you have to be careful.” Afterward, she gave him a wave and showed him a sweet smile. Then, she quickly disappeared into the street.

Zu An began to ponder to himself. He had investigated the Pegasus Merchant Group before, and they seemed to be quite connected to the Devil Sect.

Sigh, don’t tell me I have to antagonize Qiu Honglei, Yu Jianyue and the others…
