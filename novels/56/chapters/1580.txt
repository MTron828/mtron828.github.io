Chapter 1529: Drunk?

“Inner demon? What is that?” Zu An asked. He was feeling muddle-headed and didn’t immediately react to what she said.

“Don’t move around randomly!” Yun Jianyue snapped, rolling her eyes. She was so annoyed she reached out and smacked him. She finally caught her breath with some difficulty, then patiently explained to him what the inner demon that easily appeared at the essence form stage was.

Zu An had a blank expression as he replied, “This inner demon doesn’t seem all that bad. I feel absolutely amazing right now, better than at any other time.”

Yun Jianyue was speechless. What else can I even say? Of course you feel better now than at any other time.

She actually felt similar at the moment. Still, she was a grandmaster and had a firm will. She quickly gathered her thoughts and said, “The reason why people develop inner demons is because inner demons are extremely enticing, making them do many things they normally wouldn’t dare to. Furthermore, even though they bring momentary joy, they’re actually extremely harmful… If you become immersed in this feeling, it will be too difficult to return from it.”

Even though letting Zu An completely fall into his inner demon and bringing him back to the Holy Sect wouldn’t be a bad choice, she didn’t want a young man with endless prospects to end up like that.

“Why do I have to return from it?” Zu An asked, an evil grin on his face. “I’m even happier than before, and I feel much more confident and free.”

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes. Why isn’t this guy listening at all? She tried to persuade him patiently, but she just couldn't deal with this guy’s stubbornness.

Yun Jianyue bit down on her red lip and said, “Little An, if you keep doing this, I won’t like you anymore!”

“I know you’re lying,” Zu An replied, not falling for it at all. You can lie with your mouth but… That place won’t.

Yun Jianyue bit him. This guy’s previous respectful behavior was a bit cuter. Still, she patiently explained, “There’s actually no need for you to do this. I didn’t know that you had an inner demon, but didn’t I still agree? So, if you completely recover, what’s the difference? But if you let your cultivation deviate, I’ll actually dislike you instead.”

Zu An finally became a bit nervous when he heard her say that. He reflexively sat up straight and asked, “You’re not lying to me?”

“Of course not,” Yun Jianyue said, furrowing her brows. She almost lost her composure again. Just talk if you’re going to talk! Why are you moving?!

“But you said we would only do it once, as if you were going to pull up your pants and ignore me from now on,” Zu An said a bit unhappily.

“Pull up my pants and ignore you?” Yun Jianyue repeated, feeling irritation boiling inside of her. If not for the fact that she knew he was suffering from an inner demon and that he was confused, she would have already beaten his head into a pulp.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +44 +44 +44…

She did her best to suppress her rage, then consoled him, “Don’t worry. I was just using an excuse to convince myself at that time.”

She was really embarrassed when she said that. She only said so because she didn’t want his inner demon to completely control him. Once he recovered, she had to properly settle things.

“Really?” Zu An asked, suddenly feeling encouraged. His eyes even began to shine.

“Of course,” Yun Jianyue said through gritted teeth.

“Then what about Honglei? What if you force me to make a choice then?” Zu An mumbled.

“Didn’t you say you want everything? I won’t force you to make that choice either. Won’t it be fine if both Honglei and I serve you?” Yun Jianyue replied. However, even though her voice was endlessly alluring, rage bubbled within the depths of her eyes.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +119 +119 +119…

You punk, if it weren’t because I know you’re in an inner demon state, I would have already smacked you to death!

Fortunately, it was so sudden that Zu An became embarrassed instead, exclaiming, “Ah? How embarrassing would that be…”

Yun Jianyue trembled. This guy sounds embarrassed, but his body is getting even more excited.

She had finally managed to convince Zu An, however. Only then could Yun Jianyue start to control the chaotic ki in his body, sending it back along the proper channels.

She was a grandmaster who had been famous for many years. She was one of the best teachers in the field of cultivation. Furthermore, there were probably no other teachers who could sense his ki flow’s details as she could at the moment, allowing her to guide him bit by bit.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, as Zu An’s ki slowly returned to the regular track, his cultivation also fully reached the peak of the essence form stage. At that time, the inner demon also reached its peak.

Yun Jianyue secretly endured the suffering, but she could only patiently do her best to appease him. Up until this point, even she hadn’t known that a glorious demoness like her could actually be so patient.

“Little An, why are you grabbing my hair?” she asked. She didn’t get a reply, but she quickly understood. She was embarrassed and furious, snapping, “Damn brat, are you treating me like a horse?”

“What? Did you say we should do it together with Yan Xuehen another day?” she eventually exclaimed in surprise.

Even someone like Yun Jianyue from the Devil Sect had to admit that after he was afflicted by this inner demon, this guy’s imagination really was pretty amazing.

Who is Yan Xuehen? And who am I, Yun Jianyue?

We have countless admirers in this world, and any man who could obtain either one of us would already be beyond lucky.

Let alone the fact that we’re arch-nemeses, and yet this damn kid dares to go after both of us?

Still, she didn’t retort. She consoled him while his temperament was unstable. She would settle things after his messy meridians were sorted out.

Suddenly, she was startled. Wait, that’s actually not a bad idea…!

Even though she was willing to do this kind of thing with Zu An right now, their identities were too awkward. Even though she was letting down Honglei, they were all on the same side. Their relationship had always been good too, so they could just deal with it in private.

But Yan Xuehen was different! White Jade Sect and the Holy Sect were famous enemies. They had been rivals for many years. If Yan Xuehen found out about it, wouldn’t she be utterly humiliated?

However, if Yan Xuehen were dragged down too, neither one of them could laugh at the other. The righteous side couldn't use it to attack Yun Jianyue, and because it had happened to both of them, people would only direct their attention to Yan Xuehen.

Either way, I’m already a heinous demoness beyond redemption, right? I’ve done so many bad things already, so it’s not that surprising for me to do something like this.

Instead, if Yan Xuehen, that untainted goddess in everyone’s eyes, did this kind of thing, hehe…

When she thought about that, Yun Jianyue became more and more excited. All of her earlier gloominess was instantly swept away.

Still, she was a bit hesitant. Even though they were enemies, she had to admit that Yan Xuehen was a top-class woman. If she suffered the same fate, wouldn’t Zu An be let off way too easily?

Forget it, everything is for the sake of our Holy Sect…

As such, she began to fan the flames, provoking Zu An to do something to Yan Xuehen. Zu An naturally slapped his chest proudly, as if he were giving his word. Furthermore, because his mind still wasn’t the clearest, he blurted out that he had already succeeded.

Yun Jianyue didn’t pay too much attention to it and just assumed he was boasting. After facing her for so many years, she knew Yan Xuehen’s personality better than anyone else. Would she let Zu An do that kind of thing to her?

However, her expression quickly changed, because this kid only went wilder and wilder. He even said that he was going to one day seize both the masters and disciples together.

“Hey, are you drunk?” Yun Jianyue hissed through gritted teeth. This little rascal really was irritating.

Still, she wasn’t much better off right now. After all, she had guarded her purity for so many years; how could she still be fine after tossing and turning for so long? Furthermore, she had to focus her attention on helping him purify his ki and break through into a new stage. She didn’t have the energy to retort at all.

In order to simplify matters and persuade him to play along, she could only just let him say what he wanted and agree to it all. Either way, there was no way such a thing would really happen. That stone cold woman wouldn’t let him close to her at all, let alone participate in such preposterous suggestions.

…

After an unknown amount of time had passed, the messy ki inside of Zu An finally calmed down.

Yun Jianyue was already so tired that fine sweat was dripping down her face. She thought that if she hadn’t been a grandmaster with a special constitution, and if she hadn’t been proficient in the Holy Sect’s different secret skills, thus making her body far more durable and flexible than normal female cultivators, how could she possibly have endured all of this?

The entire process was more than ten times harder than her own breakthrough at the essence form stage.

Zu An also gradually recovered his mental clarity. When he recalled his earlier hot-headedness, he was also a bit apologetic. He was about to apologize when his expression suddenly changed and he said, “I feel as if my cultivation can still climb higher.”
