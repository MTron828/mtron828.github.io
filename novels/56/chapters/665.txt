Chapter 650: Sinister Undertaking

Translator: Pika

They deliberately chose to discuss in the spacious courtyard precisely because they were worried that there might be a secret eavesdropping room inside.

The building wasn’t that far from the courtyard, and those with higher cultivation could still hear what they were saying. However, once Qin Guangyuan brought out a strange rock and put it on the table, the two of them inside discovered that they couldn’t hear anything anymore.

“That’s a soundproof stone produced by the Royal Academy. It can prevent sound from leaving a certain radius.” Qiu Honglei was experienced and knowledgeable. She quickly explained.

“Royal Academy?” Zu An was stunned, but he quickly realized that this was probably the highest educational establishment in the Zhou Dynasty. It was just like the ancient times’ imperial college.

The most outstanding students from places like Brightmoon Academy would be brought to the capital’s Royal Academy to further their studies. Once they graduate from their studies there, they would immediately become officials.

In reality, any students who could enter this Royal Academy were already good enough to become officials. However, everyone wanted to make even greater achievements in the academy before they came out. After all, the greater your cultivation, the higher your starting point in your career. This would have a greater snowballing effect on your future prospects. That was why no one would choose to enter their official careers too early.

“I cannot hear what they are saying. What do we do? Should I have Shuangyue find a way to get closer?” Qiu Honglei was worried.

“There’s no need. I have a way.” Zu An closed his eyes and began to search for small creatures around the courtyard. Apart from small insects, there were mostly mice. However, mice would be easily killed once they got close.

As such, he eventually chose a fox flower cat and made it approach lazily.

Cats were so cute. These people won’t have a bad reaction, right?

Sure enough, they noticed the cat as soon as it approached. But when they saw that it was just a cat, they immediately sighed in relief and didn’t pay it any more attention. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Why did Brother Cheng call us over today?” Qin Guangyuan sat upright and still. The feeling he gave off seemed extremely steady.

On the other side, Qin Yongde sat in a much more relaxed manner. He leaned lazily into his chair as if there were no bones in his body.

As for Chu Youzhao, her face was flushed red from intoxication, and her sight was a bit blurry. She looked extremely captivating.

Cheng Gang retracted his gaze with shock. He thought to himself that the Chu clan’s young master really was pretty. If he was from an ordinary clan, he might even bring him home to play around with a bit.

Even though he didn’t swing that way, he felt like he wouldn’t mind if that man was as pretty as Chu Youzhao.

He coughed lightly and put away those thoughts. “Everyone should already know that the assassins from the previous attack all admitted that they were sent by King Qi.”

“But we’re clearly being framed!” Chu Youzhao slammed the table. She became much more bold than usual after drinking.

Qin Yongde smiled indifferently. “If even we could tell that this is a setup, then how can his majesty not?”

Qin Guangyuan frowned. “What I fear is precisely that his majesty knows, yet pretends otherwise.”

Qin Yongde’s smile froze. Chu Youzhao also frowned. They clearly realized that the chances of this were high. Cheng Gang said, “Young master’s sight is sharp as expected. This is what my father believes as well. His majesty might use this attack as an excuse to target those under King Qi’s faction. My father’s current situation is rather precarious and he cannot directly seek out the State Duke of Triumph and State Duke of Prestige, that is why they wish to exchange some thoughts through us.”

Zu An nodded inwardly. So the reason they came all the way to the government brothel was to pull a wool over everyone else’s eyes.

Qin Guangyuan asked, “Has your esteemed father found out where those assassins came from yet?”

Cheng Gang shook his head. “He does not. We only know that the assassins are led by a young, long-haired woman with grandmaster level cultivation.”

“Young woman, grandmaster?” Chu Youzhao said with a high pitched voice. She was always annoyed at the fact that she wasn’t born as a man. Otherwise, she would’ve been able to solve many of the Chu clan’s problems.

But when she heard that this young woman was actually a grandmaster, how could she not feel admiration?

Qin Yongde said with a smile, “Youzhao, do not be deceived by outward appearances. Those with profound cultivation can preserve their youth. She might seem like a young woman in your eyes, but she is already an old granny.”

Zu An had a weird look on his face. Tell that to Yun Jianyue’s face if you have the guts. She’ll smash your stupid head open.

Though… How old is big sis sect master really?

Chu Youzhao continued, “She looks like a long haired young woman, but she is a grandmaster. Shouldn’t it be easy to find out her identity?”

Qin Guangyuan shook his head. “It’s far from easy. Even though there aren’t many grandmasters in this world, most of them live in seclusion and rarely come out. It is difficult for outsiders to know much about them.”

Qin Yongde who was sitting lazily now stood up. “Even though normal people might not know, his majesty should be able to guess at who it is, right?”

Qin Guangyuan said with a bitter smile, “And we’ve now come full circle. His majesty might use this opportunity to attack King Qi’s faction.”

Cheng Gang voiced his agreement. “This is what my father thinks as well. He is the Left Guard General, as well as one of King Qi’s important figures who controls the imperial palace army. He might be one of the people his majesty wants to get rid of the most. That is why my father has always been acting proactively and trying to redirect the attention to one of the Embroidered Envoy.”

Zu An thought to himself, no wonder this mad dog keeps biting me! So he wanted to find a scapegoat for this matter.

“Embroidered Envoy?” Qin Guangyuan nodded. “I heard something about that.”

All of them worked in the palace, so there was no way they didn’t hear about it.

Cheng Gang said through gritted teeth, “Our plan was quite meticulous at first, but that Embroidered Envoy is quite tricky. He manages to avert disaster every time and he made my father’s plans go to waste. My father’s situation is becoming worse and worse.”

“He is a golden token envoy, it is to be expected that he is hard to deal with.” Qin Yongde’s tone was full of dissatisfaction. He felt like something was wrong with Cheng Xiong’s head. Why did he insist on choosing a freaking golden token envoy? Isn’t he courting disaster?

Cheng Gang said gloomily, “The reason why my father chose him is because he doesn’t have much of a foundation, and there are many points of suspicion to begin with. He might really have something to do with the assassins. That was why as my father got deeper and deeper into the investigation, it was already too hard to stop halfway. Now, he has already offended the Embroidered Envoy. If he cannot redirect the blame, then the Embroidered Envoy’s following retaliation will be brutal.”

Qin Guangyuan nodded. “Now that things are already like this, we can only choose him. Is there anything General Cheng wishes for us to convey to our grandfathers?”

Even though they were outstanding among their peers, these major affairs were still to be handled by their clan’s elders. They could only pass on the information.

“Of course.” Cheng Gang said. “I need the two State Dukes to look into Golden Token Eleven’s background and see if there are any openings to take advantage of.”

The Qin clan had great influence in the military, and they were also in charge of the selection of various officers. They were deeply involved in these matters. Only people like them could look into this matter.

Qin Guangyuan frowned. “The backgrounds of the Embroidered Envoy are all mysterious, let alone golden token envoys. Even though the Qin clan has many of our people in official positions, we might not be able to find out this information.”

Cheng Gang chuckled and said, “Even if you do not find anything, we can forge a crime of him colluding with the assassins. I believe that this isn’t anything too difficult for the two State Dukes.”

This wasn’t something Cheng Xiong could do in his current situation, so he had to ask others for help.

Qin Guangyuan frowned. He didn’t say anything.

Chu Youzhao couldn’t endure this. “Aren’t we harming an innocent person here?”

Cheng Gang sneered and didn’t say anything.

Qin Yongde used this chance to say, “Youzhao, remember. In the political circles, there is no such thing as innocent or guilty, only whether there are enough benefits. If we do not do this, then his majesty will use this chance to attack King Qi. Wouldn’t King Qi be the one who is wronged then?”

Chu Youzhao opened her mouth. However, even though she didn’t approve of this, she couldn’t find any reasons to retort.

Qin Guangyuan spoke up. “Leave this matter to our Qin clan. We must act quickly and decisively.”

Cheng Gang smiled. “Young masters are clear spoken as expected. Let’s have a toast to tonight!”

Now that they finished discussing official matters, the drinks continued. They called back Shuangyue and the other maids.

Zu An’s face was gloomy. If he didn’t happen to run into this talk, he would’ve been schemed against without any idea.

These capital old foxes, each more treacherous than the last.

After listening to his explanation, Qiu Honglei also became upset. “Aren’t these people a bit too shameless?”

Zu An replied with a bitter smile, “The worst part is that they just got extremely lucky. What kind of luck is this?”

Qiu Honglei’s expression also became strange, because Zu An really did collude with her group, the assassins.

Zu An thought for a bit, and then said, “I need you guys to help me with something…”

When she listened to what he had to say, Qiu Honglei’s pretty brows furrowed deeply. “I’m willing to help you of course, but this is a huge matter that might bring the decades of work we put into this capital city station of ours to ruin. I cannot promise you this if the rest of the sect does not agree. That is why I need you to promise us something else.”
