Chapter 1444: Clown Woman

In the end, Zu An gave up on the idea of telling Xi He Yi’s story. The main reason was that she was too strong and he didn’t know what kinds of consequences it could bring about. Instead, he could only console her with a gentle voice.

Xi He gradually calmed down, feeling more and more that Zu An was a considerate man. When she looked at him, her expression softened.

The other three women watched with strange expressions. However, they were all intelligent people and wouldn’t get jealous, considering the current situation.

The golden war chariot pulled by six dragons moved along quickly. The group soon approached the place where the ten suns had gathered. In the distance, they saw the ten suns shining with dazzling radiance. Waves of heat swept over them, and they even felt the hair on their bodies dry up.

Xi He gave them a look. With a wave of her sleeves, multicolored radiance shone around the golden war chariot, and Zu An’s group immediately felt incredibly refreshed. The unbearable heat was no longer present.

“Thank you, madam,” Zu An quickly said. At the same time, he thought to himself, Just how did ten suns come out of her petite body?

The looks Zu An snuck at her didn’t escape Xi He’s notice. Normally, if anyone looked at her that way, they would have long since had their eyes gouged out. However, at the moment, she actually felt as if her beauty had been acknowledged by Zu An, which made her feel quite proud.

Of course, her attention quickly returned to her children. There were ten suns in the sky, and they seemed to be surrounding a person. Zu An and the others saw that the person was a blue-clothed… woman?

They were hesitant because she didn’t look like an ordinary woman at first glance. Her physique was broad and tall, and she was bald. There didn’t seem to be a strand of hair on her entire body. Apart from two normal eyes, there was a third, vertical eye on her forehead. Her features weren’t particularly good-looking to begin with, and between that and the strange eye, those who looked at her felt vaguely uncomfortable.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

There was a mount beneath her as well. It was a giant sea crab with a huge back that stretched a thousand miles across. The crab’s presence alone already seemed to be on par with that of the octopus monster Zu An had encountered in the northern sea, and the bubbles it released could even temporarily hinder the Golden Crows’ movements. The fact that the woman could use such a monster as a mount showed just how unfathomable her strength was.

The ten Golden Crows were attacking her from all directions, but the woman wasn’t outdone at all. Myriad streams of devastating lights swirled all around; the slightest touch of the shockwaves that rippled outward could collapse a mountain.

Zu An’s group felt a bit numb watching the encounter. This really was a battle between immortals! Every single participant in the battle seemed to be at the earth immortal rank, and yet they had seriously considered killing the ten Golden Crows before! That thought really was just a bad joke now.

“Clown woman, you are quite daring to make me your enemy,” Xi He said after observing the state of the battlefield. She stared at the bald woman, her eyes filled with shock and anger.

“Clown woman?” Zu An murmured, thinking the name was quite fitting. The woman who was riding the crab really did look somewhat hideous.

“Heh heh…” An extremely unpleasant laugh emerged from the clown woman’s throat. She retorted, “So your sons are your sons, but mine aren’t?”

“What are you trying to say?” Xi He asked, her pretty brows furrowing. “We have always minded our own business. Why have you suddenly gone mad?”

“Hmph, you know what you’ve done,” the clown woman replied.

Suddenly, she summoned a giant dragon fish, no weaker than the giant crab. The ten Golden Crows were quickly left in a tough spot.

“Impudent!” Xi He snapped. She wasn’t in the mood to argue with the woman anymore, so. She also joined the fray.

Now, it really was as if space itself had begun to collapse. It felt as if the dao itself were being destroyed.

Yun Jianyue watched the whole scene without taking her eyes off the battlefield. She released a deep sigh, saying, “Now that I’ve had the privilege of watching a battle on this level, I wouldn’t feel any regrets even if I were to die soon.”

“Indeed,” Yan Xuehen said, also feeling quite moved. The clown woman seemed to be using the witch arts of legends, which shared some similarities with her daoist sect’s methods.

As she watched the battle, she felt that her cultivation, which had already stopped progressing for a long time, had begun to loosen up. If she could find time to cultivate in seclusion, it was even possible that she would experience a breakthrough.

However, she knew she wouldn’t necessarily have such a chance in this life anymore. They were trapped in such a terrifying woman’s hands, and the equally scary Golden Crows were present too. Even if Zu An used his ‘honey trap skill’, they still had no chance of survival.

Yu Yanluo’s cultivation realm was a bit lower than the others’. She was also dazzled as she watched, but many of the profound mysteries were beyond her understanding. Even so, she still received many benefits.

Zu An sized up the clown woman. Even though she wasn’t the prettiest, the enemy of one’s enemy was one’s friend, which would put them on the same side. As such, he secretly cheered her on. It was a pity that they had been captured and couldn't help at all.

As the clown woman was up against such a powerful lineup, things didn’t look good for her. Sure enough, once Xi He joined the battle, even with the giant crab and dragon fish’s help, the clown woman was still no match for the opposing force. Bit by bit, she was quickly forced back.

Blood erupted from the dragon fish’s body as it was killed on the spot, torn to pieces by the Golden Crows’ sharp claws. Soon afterward, the giant crab’s bubbles slowly stopped emerging as its body turned red, thoroughly cooked. The ten Golden Crows, together with the Sun Goddess’ power, weren’t something it could withstand, and it was roasted all the way through.

The Golden Crows all sneered when they saw that, remarking, “That crab gave us quite a hard time earlier. Having it for dinner would be perfect for getting rid of our hatred.”

“I love roasted crab! I can’t wait!”

“The meat in its claws is mine. That’s the best part.”

“I like the flesh around the belly more. It’s the most fragrant and tender.”

“This is actually a female crab. Its cream is definitely the best part!”

When she heard the Golden Crows’ wanton commentary, the clown woman was shocked and furious. She looked at her dead mounts. A hint of pity appeared on her ugly face. With a wave of her hand, their bodies flew far into the sea.

The Golden Crows couldn't stop them in time. They stared at her angrily, yelling, “Ugly clown, compensate us for our crab meat!”

“And that dragon fish!”

The clown woman gave the Golden Crows a look and snapped, “You’ve forced my hand!”

Then, her aura suddenly surged. At first, she had clearly been using water element witch arts, but now, the blazing aura of fire appeared. Her clothes began to glow red, then burned away to ashes.

Zu An didn’t avert his eyes; the clown woman’s body was covered by surging, fiery light, so he couldn't see anything at all.

The group was shocked as the temperature around the clown woman rose rapidly, its light even brighter than the ten Golden Crows. An eleventh sun appeared in the sky. The seas boiled and the earth cracked. The aura of death fell onto the world.

Previously, Xi He had used her skill to insulate the war chariot from the heat. Now, however, Zu An’s group felt scorching heat that made the atmosphere feel extremely arid.

Xi Yi’s expression also changed greatly. She murmured, “This aura… You are no clown woman. You are Nuba!”
