Chapter 1501: I Admit That I Was Shooting My Mouth Off

The entire place was absolutely silent. People began to think, Is the entire world broken somehow?

The glorious Lion King Shi Zhentian, who had been famous in the Fiend races for a long time, had been instantly killed?Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

If such beings as the Fiend Emperor or Human Emperor had killed him instantly, no one would find that strange. Similarly, if he had lost to Fiend race giants such as the Peacock Wise King, Great Elf King, Dragon King, or Demon King, they would also be able to understand.

However, what kind of situation was this? Shi Zhentian had lost to a young junior, and furthermore in an instant, without even leaving behind an intact corpse?

Zu An lowered his Sun Slaying Bow. He looked at Shi Zhentian’s corpse and sighed, saying, “I told you that you’d die immediately. Why did you have to go that far?”

He had used the divine weapon, the Sun Slaying Bow, just then. Or, to be more precise, its proper name was the Red Bow. The Sun Slaying Bow had been seized from the Golden Crow Crown Prince by the Celestial Emperor; it seemed to have been reforged somehow, making it even more powerful than its original form.

The arrow was a special white one. It wasn’t one of the arrows the Golden Crow Crown Prince used; even though those arrows were also very formidable, the bow only became complete with the white arrows. Combined, they could even shoot down the suns in the sky.

Of course, Shi Zhentian wasn’t worthy of using the true white arrow on. Instead, Zu An had used the Rune Weapon Chart to materialize an arrow. It was weaker than the true white arrows, but it was still enough to defeat a grandmaster. Furthermore, Shi Zhentian had underestimated him and focused most of his attention on Yan Xuehen. By the time he had reacted, it was already too late.

Those present unwittingly stopped fighting. Yun Jianyue looked toward Yan Xuehen and asked, “Stone cold woman, why is that guy so strong?”

With their cultivation, even though they were far apart, they had no issue talking through ki at all.

Yan Xuehen was also completely shocked. After thinking for a while, she said, “I have heard that some exceptional swordsmen keep their swords sheathed for decades to nurture sword intent. Once their swords leave the scabbard, the sword energy soars into the heavens and carries boundless power. Ah Zu… Judging from the current situation, he should be like that. It must be because, in the secret dungeon, he first shot down the suns in the sky, then killed the Fiend Emperor. Even though he used all sorts of methods, the fact that he killed the Fiend Emperor is still real.

“We were still underestimating him before. He has already truly nurtured the spirit of the unrivaled. Whenever he decides to attack, it is with absolute confidence. This punk really is a genius! He actually achieved a result comparable to those exceptional swordsmen who do not raise their sword for decades or over a century, or maybe even longer!

“Now, whenever he ends a strong opponent with a single strike, his unrivaled intent will grow stronger. This will continue until he becomes a true unrivaled being.”

“But he’s only a master rank cultivator at the hero form stage…” Yun Jianyue trailed off mid-sentence. After being around him for so long, she already knew better than anyone that this guy’s strength couldn't be evaluated through normal means. She wondered, “Then, if he could easily kill Shi Zhentian, doesn’t that mean he could easily kill us too?”

That scene had really left her a bit stunned. She had even begun to question life a bit.

“He cannot,” Yan Xuehen reflexively replied.

“How do you know?” Yun Jianyue asked, looking at her in confusion.

Yan Xuehen’s face reddened. She couldn't just say that he had already shot all over her before, right? She quickly said, “It is mainly because Shi Zhentian didn’t know about Zu An’s strength and was a bit careless. We know about Zu An’s strength, so if we are careful, we can avoid his shot.”

She frowned after saying that. It was clearly a normal reply, so why did she feel a bit strange?

Yun Jianyue nodded slowly. That arrow had almost made her break down mentally.

Meanwhile, the other geniuses also reacted one after another. The once quiet palace gates suddenly erupted with noise comparable to a food market.

The Lion race princes atop the wall were completely ashen-faced. Shi Rong’s voice shook a bit as he began, “Third brother, there… There isn’t anything wrong with my eyes, right? Hey, third brother?”

He discovered that his third brother had already taken to his heels and fled, but stumbled several times while running, as if his legs had gone limp.

“Fuck!” Shi Gong and Shi Rong both cursed.

Previously, they had always disapproved when they heard people say that their third brother was the most crafty and treacherous one among them. Now, that had indeed turned out to be the case after all. His father had died, and yet he didn’t have any thoughts of getting revenge?

The worst part is that he didn’t even call us before running!

The two of them didn’t hesitate either and simply ran for their lives. However, when they fled, the rest of the Lion race people lost all morale. Everything came crashing down like a landslide.

Yu Yanluo’s expression was extremely warm and gentle. She thought to herself that her eye for men was much better than her mother’s. 

But, ah… Being too outstanding is also a problem… He’ll definitely attract more and more women. Who knows how many will try to get in? It’ll be impossible to stop…

The Second Empress’ heart was pounding. She was a bit distracted by the sight of the handsome man next to her. The shock of what had happened just then was something completely unprecedented for her! Previously, when Zu An had spoken those ‘bold, visionary words’, she had felt only suspicion and worry. She had never expected him to really be that strong. Apart from the Fiend Emperor, he was pretty much the strongest man she had ever seen.

No, even the Fiend Emperor wasn’t as handsome as him. Besides, at his age, he was old enough to even be my grandfather. Ah Zu is still in his prime, so how can the Fiend Emperor compare to him?

When she saw her son’s wide eyes, her face turned a bit red. I really made the best decision by making him my child’s father.

Her other thoughts were unknown, but she subconsciously brought her legs together. A slight blush crept across her fair neck.

…

Qiao Xueying looked at Zu An with starry eyes. Now that one side of the palace gate’s defenses had collapsed, their troops could just charge directly in. She wouldn’t have to do anything herself anymore.

My big brother Ah Zu is becoming more and more handsome. He was just a weak little chick when I first met him.

When she recalled how the two of them had fought before, a happy smile appeared on Qiao Xueying’s small mouth. The two of us really are a quarrelsome but loving couple… 

The Demon race’s Princess Suolun’s eyes sparkled. When she first met Zu An, she had already been shocked by his strength and handsomeness. However, back then, he had still been going against others of the younger generation. Now, even a grandmaster like Shi Zhentian had been killed in a single move?

Was he hiding his cultivation?

Ahhh! The most handsome men really do keep a low profile! Those other, ugly men are clearly far inferior, and yet they always like to boast and show off.

While she was deep in thought, her eyes couldn't help but dart toward the big-mouthed Dragon race prince.

Chi Wen opened his mouth, his jaw almost dropping to the ground. That scene just then was just far too shocking.

Is this guy still human?

No, he’s definitely some reincarnated old monster who deliberately hid his age. That has to be it! Otherwise, this doesn’t make any sense!

He silently warned himself that in the future, he had to stay a bit further away from Zu An’s women. Even though those women were all top-notch, there were so many beautiful women in this world, and there was no reason to court death for no reason. 

That guy can shoot down grandmasters with just a single move! wouldn’t he be able to crush me like an ant?

Not only should I not offend him, I have to start kissing up to him.

Still, with what happened between us before, I really don’t want to… Kissing up will be a bit hard…

Wait, little aunt’s relationship with him isn’t that bad. There’s definitely some story between them. As long as I give them a push and make him my uncle-in-law, won’t that be the best way to kiss up?

He immediately felt great when he realized that.

Zu An turned his attention to Hu Qianxiao. The other man immediately froze, exclaiming, “Misunderstanding, it’s all a misunderstanding!”

Shi Zhentian was his old enemy. They had fought several times and were evenly matched each time. Now that Shi Zhentian had been shot down by a single arrow, wouldn’t that mean the same fate awaited him if they fought? Furthermore, the Lion race’s side had already completely broken down, and the Crown Prince’s Golden Crow Guards had lost their morale. It was just his men left! Like hell they’d keep fighting.

“Misunderstanding?” Zu An asked, raising a brow.

“Indeed, it’s a misunderstanding! I admit that I was shooting my mouth off earlier,” Hu Qianxiao replied, wiping the sweat on his forehead. “Everyone knows that Shi Zhentian and I are enemies. Now that you’v killed him, I couldn't be happier!”

“But you just said you’d sided with the Crown Prince and came to stop us,” Zu An said, remaining expressionless.

“Who says I’ve sided with the Crown Prince? The Crown Prince forced us to!” Hu Qianxiao exclaimed, then quickly bowed toward the Second Empress and the youngest prince. “I have renounced my wrong ways and turned to a better path! I bow down to the Second Empress and the young prince as my masters.”

Zu An was speechless. However, after his moment of silence,  he said, “Honestly, I’m more used to your previous arrogant self.”
