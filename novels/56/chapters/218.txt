Chapter 218: I Also Feel Helpless About It

Translator: Pika

After bidding farewell with Ji Xiaoxi, Zu An departed the area with Chu Chuyan. In view that the academy had already granted them three days’ worth of leave, they decided to head back to the Chu Manor.

Chu Chuyan needed to report everything that had happened in the dungeon to her parents, especially about the fallout with Shi Kun lest they were taken off guard.

As soon as they walked out of the academy, a short-haired woman suddenly leaped toward them with outstretched hands, shouting, “Big sister, brother-in-law!”

Given how passionate his sister-in-law was, how could Zu An possibly not reciprocate? He stretched his hand forth to hug her as he said, “What a good child our Huanzhao is~”

Aww, she’s still as adorable as ever.

Chu Huanzhao’s face turned red. She completely ignored Zu An and leaped into Chu Chuyan’s embrace instead. “Big sister, you’re finally out! I heard rumors that the dungeon is far more dangerous than before, so I was really worried about you.”

“...” Zu An.

He awkwardly pulled his hands back. Damn it, I shouldn’t have praised her.

All of a sudden, another person leaped into his embrace, crying with a choked-up voice, “Young master, I didn’t think that you would miss me so much! I’m moved to tears!”

The two buns on Cheng Shouping’s head tickled Zu An’s nose. He was stunned for a moment before hurriedly pushing him away.

Why does he always act in such a manner... Could it be that he really swings that way?!

Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan stroked her younger sister’s head dotingly and said, “We did encounter some danger in the dungeon, Come, let’s head back home first. I’ll share the details with you later on.”

“Alright!” Chu Huanzhao waved her fist around excitedly. “You must tell me every single detail, alright? It’s such a pity that I didn’t manage to join the dungeon expedition. I’ve already recovered from my wounds, but our mother simply wouldn’t allow me to go!”

“Our mother is just afraid that you would meet with danger inside. Besides, this dungeon is much different from before. If you have really went in, something might have just happened,” said Chu Chuyan with a reddened face.

Needless to say, there was no way she was going to share every single detail with Chu Huanzhao, especially regarding that matter.

“What could possibly happen to me?” Chu Huanzhao thought nothing about it. She pointed a finger at Zu An and said, “Even someone of his caliber is able to make it out safely, so why would it be any different for me?”

“...” Zu An.

What do you mean by someone of my caliber?!

“Huanzhao, it has only been a few days since we last met, but it looks like you’re itching for a beating, huh?”

Chu Huanzhao immediately hid behind Chu Chuyan and exclaimed, “Big sister, look! He’s bullying me again!”

Chu Chuyan knew her younger sister’s personality well, so she smiled helplessly and said, “Alright, you should stop messing around. He isn’t as weak as you think him out to be. Didn’t you see his performance in the previous Clans Tournament?”

“I did, but our mother said that he simply lucked out,” replied Chu Huanzhao. “So, big sister, does he really have any true capabilities?”

Zu An chuckled softly, knowing that Chu Huanzhao was intentionally asking this question to help strengthen his relationship with Chu Chuyan. That silly lass. She doesn’t know that I’ve already reached that step with her older sister.

Chu Chuyan glanced at Zu An with a weird expression before finally nodding in response. “Yes, our mother seems to be mistaken. He’s pretty strong. He nearly killed Shi Kun with a single strike earlier.”

“Is our brother-in-law that formidable?” Chu Huanzhao immediately ran up to Zu An and assessed him intently. “As expected of a man whom I have high expectations for. You were actually able to beat his ass up!”

Chu Chuyan frowned. “Huanzhao, you should watch your tone. A lady shouldn’t use... that sort of language!”

Chu Huanzhao shrugged nonchalantly. “Aiyo, it’s more than enough to have you around for the demure feminine stuff. Just let me live however I want to, alright?”

“...” Chu Chuyan.

She knew her younger sister well enough to know that it was futile to tell her off. So, she could only heave a helpless sigh and let it slip.

Chu Huanzhao continued staring at Zu An intently before suddenly stretching her hand forth and asking, “Give it to me.”

“What?” Zu An was stunned.

“My gift. Didn’t you promise to bring a gift back for me?” Chu Huanzhao frowned. “You can’t have forgotten about it, did you?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“This...” Zu An scratched his head awkwardly. He really forgot about this matter, but it couldn’t since he had been put through a series of life-threatening situations ever since entering the dungeon, so there was no way he would have any spare attention to think about that.

Chu Huanzhao could tell that Zu An had forgotten from his expression, and the expectant look on her face immediately crumbled. “Stinky brother-in-law, I shan’t talk to you ever again!”

With a cold face, she turned around and stomped off. No matter how Zu An shouted for her, she refused to turn her head around.

Watching the entire scene, Cheng Shouping shook his head. It looks like our young master really doesn’t understand a woman’s heart. How could he forget about something as important as this? I really have to give him some pointers in the future.

I should share with him the great amount of knowledge I’ve amassed from reading those romance novels!

Chu Huanzhao ignored Zu An completely the entire journey back to the Chu Manor. She was intending to return back to her room to sleep when Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru suddenly started asking them about their experience in the dungeon, which compelled her to stay out of curiosity.

Chu Chuyan quickly shared everything that had happened in the dungeon, and Zu An supplemented on some of the details. Somehow, the two of them shared the same idea not to mention that matter.

Chu Chuyan was simply embarrassed whereas Zu An was afraid that Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru would tear him into shreds upon learning the truth. Qin Wanru had never had a good impression of him in the first place. Chu Zhongtian did treat him fairly well, but as a father, it was inevitable that he would be infuriated when his precious daughter had been taken advantage of by a good-for-nothing.

So, he decided to wait till he finally assimilated more into the family before announcing this joyous news.

Chu Zhongtian, Qin Wanru, and Chu Huanzhao didn’t notice their occasional exchange of glances due to how shocking their experiences were, especiallyw hen they learned that Chu Chuyan’s ki meridians had collapsed at one point in time.

Even though it was relieving that Chu Chuyan was currently standing before them safe and sound, Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru still hurriedly stood up and checked her pulse. It was only after ensuring that she was really fine did they finally sigh in relief.

Qin Wnaru shot a sharp glare at Zu An and bellowed, “Our Chuyan nearly got crippled in order to save you. You really are a curse to our family!”

You have successfully trolled QIn Wanru for +481 Rage!

“???” Zu An.

What in the freaking world? Why the hell are you blaming me for this? Are we nemesis in our past lives? It’s your Chu clan who have made enemies out of everyone; why the hell are you blaming me for everything that happens?

Chu Huanzhao was still angry with Zu An a moment ago, but her mother’s words immediately incurred her displeasure. “Mother, you’re going too far here. What does this have to do with my brother-in-law?”

Qin Wanru looked at Chu Huanzhao and said, “Huanzhao, as the daughter of a ducal clan, you must learn to weigh the pros and cons of whatever you do. Not all lives are equal in the world. It’s not that you shouldn’t help those in need, but if doing so places you in danger as well, you should prioritize your safety instead.”

Chu Chuyan also frowned and remarked, “Mother, if not for Zu An finding the precious Evanescent Lotus and feeding it to me, I might have already been dead by now. Not to mention, he even saved me afterward...”

“If not for him, you wouldn’t have been in danger in the first place! Isn’t it normal for him to save you?” Qin Wanru harrumphed.

Chu Chuyan was a little displeased to hear those words. While she knew that her mother was a headstrong person, she didn’t think that it was much of an issue in the past. However, at this very moment, she felt that her mother was being a little too unreasonable here.

It was fortunate that Chu Zhongtian was around to mediate the situation. “Enough. The Evanescent Lotus did save Chuyan and further her cultivation by an entire rank. We should be thanking Ah Zu here instead. Ah Zu, don’t take your mother-in-law’s words to heart. She’s a little anxious after hearing about the danger Chuyan has faced in the dungeon.”

Qin Wanru was unhappy with her husband’s words, but she chose not to refute him.

“Don’t worry, father-in-law. I understand.”

Zu An was frustrated at how Qin Wanru was pinning everything on him as if it was his fault, but he knew that he couldn’t do anything else other than to ignore her.

Qin Wanru was Chu Chuyan and Chu Huanzhao’s mother, after all.

...

Meanwhile, in the governor’s residence, Sang Hong was in the midst of listening to Zheng Dan reporting the happenings in the dungeon to him.

Zheng Dan was extremely uptight in front of her future father-in-law, fearing that she would accidentally do anything to offend him. She revealed everything she knew about to him honestly.

Looking at the tender woman in front of her, Sang Hong nodded his head silently. Her appearance and disposition are top-notch. While her acting does go over the top at times, it’s not a bad thing for her to be a little calculative. Her personality would complement my son’s recklessness.

After listening to the full story, Sang Hong sighed deeply and said, “I thought that Shi Kun’s plan was too immature, but I turned a blind eye to it since it would be to everyone’s advantage if it works out. I wouldn’t have to dirty my hands here too. However, since he has already utterly failed here, I’d have no choice but to make a move personally then. Haa, I really hoped that I wouldn’t have to come to this point.”
