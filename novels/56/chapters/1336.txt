Chapter 1285: Senior’s Lesson

“Witch, what did you say?!” Yan Xuehen exclaimed, her brows shooting up.

“The two of you have already gone that far, so why are you getting so worked up over what I said?” Yun Jianyue retorted. She had always disliked Yan Xuehen’s pure and indifferent act, so she always liked to annoy the other woman. She always felt extremely happy whenever she saw her rival act out of character.

Yu Yanluo felt a bit guilty because of what had just happened. Is Yun Jianyue indirectly criticizing me…

When she saw the pink blush appear on Yan Xuehen’s white jade-like skin, she had to admit that this woman really was pretty.

If she hadn’t been known for pursuing the dao of mental purity, making others all think she would never blush like this, the title of number one beauty might not have fallen to me so easily.

And then there’s Yun Jianyue. Even though she’s a bit fierce, she really is ridiculously beautiful for no reason. Both of these women have already become grandmasters, and yet they’re also this pretty. Can you two leave something for the rest of us, please?

At that instant, she even began to wonder if asking Yan Xuehen to accompany her own man was a mistake. Still, the most important thing was ensuring Zu An’s safety. Everything else could come after.

“If you are so enthusiastic, why not go back with him?” Yan Xuehen snapped. Because of the ‘Love Is More Solid than Gold’ skill, and the various intimate interactions they’d had, she knew very clearly that she couldn’t afford to get any closer to him.

“I really wouldn't mind it that much, but those court bastards all think of me as some traitorous monster. If I went back with Ah Zu, wouldn’t I just be harming him instead?” Yun Jianyue replied, then looked Yan Xuehen up and down. “You’re different, though. You’ve earned quite a good reputation from your operations in the last few years. From what I know, more than half of the court are your fans, always following behind you and calling you their goddess. They’ll definitely believe what you say.”

She felt a bit jealous after saying that. Their cultivation was clearly around the same, and their appearances and figures were also on the same level, and yet why was their treatment so completely different?

Yan Xuehen knew she was on good terms with many officials, but with her natural disposition, she prefered peace and quiet. She rarely interacted with them.

But that isn’t the most important thing. The most important thing is that…Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She gave Zu An a look and just happened to meet his gaze. She lowered her head guiltily and said apologetically, “Of course I am willing to help, but men and women should be separated, and time is pressing. Carrying a second person might affect your speed.”

That was already a tactful refusal. Zu An smiled and didn’t force the issue.

He was about to reply when Yun Jianyue said, “You cultivate the heartless dao; when have you ever had any notion of the difference between men and women? Don’t tell me…”

Yan Xuehen was flustered and retorted, “What heartless dao?! I cultivate the emotionless dao!”

“Either way, it’s more or less the same from our perspective,” Yun Jianyue replied casually, not thinking too much of it. She said, “You would never have worried about something like this before.”

“It is not entirely out of the question because the situation is dire,” Yan Xuehen said. She didn’t dare to argue that point for fear of the other two really noticing something. “Even if he were alone, however, it would be hard for him to arrive before tomorrow with such a distance, and I would instead become a burden.”

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes and replied, “You’re so slim; how much could you even weigh? The Wind Fire Wheels are a heaven-grade weapon, okay? What difference would your insignificant weight make?”

Yan Xuehen was speechless. She could only give Zu An a pleading look, her eyes full of expectation and hope that he would help her out of this situation.

However, Zu An nodded and said, “What Big Sister Yun said is right. It actually doesn’t matter that much.”

Yan Xuehen was speechless. She hadn’t expected him to say that at all. She was completely stunned.

“Then it’s decided. You two should hurry along so you can come back sooner,” Yun Jianyue said. She yawned, as if she would soon go back to sleep.

Yu Yanluo greeted Yan Xuehen, saying, “I’ll be troubling Big Sister Yan.”

After the mood had already become that way, it was already too embarrassing for Yan Xuehen to refuse. She could only say, “Then… Alright.”

Because the matter was too urgent, they didn’t waste any more time. They quickly got ready to leave. Zu An took out the Wind Fire Wheels.

Yan Xuehen asked, somewhat hesitantly, “Can we ride on one each?”

“I fear that isn’t possible.” Zu An shook his head. “These two are a pair and can’t be used separately.”

Yan Xuehen’s mouth opened, and she looked hesitant and conflicted.

Zu An said, “I’ll carry you on my back. That way, it’ll be a bit easier.”

Yan Xuehen bit her lip. She knew that was the most suitable method at the moment. A princess carry would be too dubious, and Zu An would get tired from doing that the entire trip. Meanwhile, embracing each other was too intimate. The only option she could accept was being carried on his back. It wasn’t as if she hadn’t been carried on his back before, either. When she saw him squat in front of her, she blushed, but she still climbed on.

Zu An’s hands supported Yan Xuehen’s thighs as he lifted her onto his back. Then, he got onto the Wind Fire Wheels. After using them a few times, he was already extremely proficient at maintaining his balance on them. Besides, he had already tried riding with two people back in Bluefield Country with Tushan Yu, which was why he knew that having an extra person wouldn’t hinder him much.

He turned around to say goodbye to Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue, saying, “I’ll hurry back once I take care of things. The two of you need to be careful and take care of yourselves.”

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes and said, “You were still sucking on milk while I was already making a name for myself. Just take care of that stone cold woman; her condition isn’t all that good. I’ll need a proper explanation from you if I find even a hair missing when you two come back.”

Zu An couldn't help but grumble, “Don’t you pluck her hair often?”

Yan Xuehen was really embarrassed and pinched him. She hadn’t expected him to have even seen how Yun Jianyue bullied her in private.

Yun Jianyue instead said confidently, “Even if she’s going to be bullied, it has to be by me, and not a brat like you.”

Yan Xuehen said through clenched teeth. “You witch, once I recover, I will definitely beat you so badly your face turns completely red!”

Yun Jianyue didn’t seem to care that much. She said, “Our cultivation has always been similar. Even if you do recover, it won’t be all that realistic for you to beat me. That is, unless you just happen to find me when I’m seriously injured, but you’re in better condition. That’s why you’ll never be able to avenge the suffering you went through here.”

Yan Xuehen was really bitter and angry, but she knew that Yun Jianyue was speaking the truth. She thought, It’s all Zu An’s fault. If I hadn’t run into him, why would I be bullied by my nemesis like this?

“Enough, it’s already getting late. We’re heading out,” Zu An said, blowing Yu Yanluo a kiss. He didn’t dare to remain after seeing that the two of them were about to start arguing again.

Yu Yanluo’s face was a bit red. She thought, This guy is blowing a kiss toward me in front of two grandmasters? Do you think they’re blind? However, she could only hold those thoughts in. She said, “After staying here for a bit longer, we’ll head out again. Our itinerary going toward the Fiend King Court is also quite tight, so we’ll continue along while waiting for you. Either way, you have the Wind Fire Wheels, so you can travel quickly.”

“Got it!” Zu An replied, waving toward them. He got on the Wind Fire Wheels, then rushed into the air.

“Ah~” Yan Xuehen cried out in alarm. She instinctively held onto Zu An’s neck.

“What is it?” Zu An was worried that there might be something wrong with her body.

“It is nothing. It is just that I never felt like this before when I flew on my own, but now, when I look down, I actually feel a bit scared,” Yan Xuehen said, feeling a bit embarrassed.

“You’re injured right now, so of course you don’t feel safe,” Zu An said with a chuckle. “I didn’t expect a grandmaster to have such a cute side too.”

“Cute?” Yan Xuehen replied as mind went blank. Even after so many years, this was the first time someone had described her in such a way. However, she quickly reacted and said with a straight face, “Please act more decently. I am like half a master to you, and strictly speaking, I am your senior. How can you be this cheeky?”

She had long since been thinking about how she would be able to associate with Zu An in the future. Apart from avoiding him as much as possible, a relationship between master and disciple seemed to be the most suitable pretext. Even if there was some physical contact, it wasn’t that big of a deal for a junior taking care of a senior, right?

“Senior?” Zu An replied with a grin. He deliberately accelerated fiercely, then pretended to have lost his footing and stumbled a few times. He even made a few turns, but just as he was about to fall down, he always regained his footing again at the last second.

“Ah…” Even Yan Xuehen, who was normally cold and indifferent, was now so scared she screamed endlessly and instinctively grabbed onto him firmly.

When they finally regained their balance, Zu An said apologetically, “Sorry, I’m not too used to riding together with someone else.”

At that point, however, he was sighing in amazement inside. When he had been chatting with others in the forums of his previous world, he had always felt that there was no way someone could be so slim, and yet still have such a crazy figure. And yet, Yan Xuehen was a perfect example of that! Considering the great waves he had felt from moving and suddenly stopping… No wonder so many people liked to ride motorcycles to pick up women!

Yan Xuehen wasn’t stupid. She became extremely embarrassed, protesting, “You did that on purpose!”
