Chapter 1622: Rumors and Slander

“Why?” Chu Chuyan asked. Perhaps due to the excitement she had just experienced, her thoughts were fuzzy. She had always thought that her battle with Qiu Honglei was tied to the pride of the White Jade Sect and the Devil Sect, to the extent that it even touched on the clash of good versus evil. As such, she didn’t dare to treat the matter carelessly. However, who would have thought that her master would actually say that those things weren’t important?

“Silly child,” Yan Xuehen said with a sigh. “You know about Qiu Honglei’s relationship with Zu An too, don’t you? If you lost to her, wouldn’t you be beneath her for the rest of your life?”

Chu Chuyan’s face reddened. She said weakly, “I know Qiu Honglei, and I don’t think it’ll be like that…”

Her voice became softer and softer. She realized  that emotions weren’t something that followed logic at all. If she really lost to Qiu Honglei, perhaps she really wouldn’t be able to raise her head ever again in front of her rival for the rest of her life. She would always be suppressed by Qiu Honglei…

“Even if Qiu Honglei doesn’t understand that now, she will in the future,” Yan Xuehen said, giving her disciple a look. “Furthermore, she is Yun Jianyue’s disciple. Yun Jianyue has always wanted to climb atop me her entire life, but she has unfortunately never succeeded. If there is a weakness to exploit in her disciple, she will definitely begin to provoke Qiu Honglei. She will only be able to satisfy that laughable desire for victory through her disciple suppressing mine.

“Yun Jianyue is the Devil Sect Master, so she has always achieved her goals through means fair or foul. Qiu Honglei is studying under her, so she will definitely use all kinds of methods to subdue you. She might even take your place and make you serve her. Eventually, you might not even have the face to remain at Zu An’s side anymore. Could it be that you really want things to reach that point?”

The blush on Chu Chuyan’s face disappeared, replaced with an incredible pallor. She realized that such a situation really did have a high chance of happening.

“So, this battle is not for the White Jade Sect’s sake, but rather for yours. And yet, for a moment of pleasure, you… How could your master not be angry?” Yan Xuehen said resentfully. However, the one who angered her the most was still that rascal. You clearly promised me that you wouldn’t come and disturb Chuyan, and yet you went back on your word!Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Master, I know I was wrong,” Chu Chuyan said, taking a deep breath. Her expression gradually  became steady as she continued, “I won’t meet with him again for the meantime, and will focus all of my attention on the competition.”

Yan Xuehen nodded in appreciation and said, “As long as you understand. With your intelligence and cultivation, it will not be too late even though you have only realized this now.”

“Thank you, master,” Chu Chuyan said, although she felt a bit strange. Her master was really different from before. In the past, she definitely wouldn’t have cared about such romantic matters. But now, her master was giving advice for her future battles in the harem?

However, when she saw that her master was still angry, she didn’t dare to keep asking about such things. Inwardly, she was still really moved. Master probably really sees me as a daughter. That must be why she’s thinking about things in such detail for my sake.

When she saw Chu Chuyan recover her usual calm, Yan Xuehen felt relieved. When she looked at the messy bedding and smelled the lingering scent in the air, she felt a bit too embarrassed to stay. She thus left with a scowl.

Chu Chuyan was left in the room alone with her hands covering her face. She murmured, “Ah… that was so embarrassing…” When she thought about being seen by her master, she wanted dig a hole in the ground with her toes out of embarrassment.

…

As Yan Xuehen left the room, she resembled a white cloud. She quickly arrived outside Zu An’s residence and said coldly, “Mister Zu, get out here right now.”

“Who dares to speak such words of disrespect toward our General Zu?!” Zhang Zijiang exclaimed, thinking to himself, What a great opportunity to get on Zu An’s good side! He excitedly picked up his weapon and ran out, making sure that Zu An could hear his expression of loyalty. And yet, before he could even see who the enemy was, he saw a white blur in front of him. Then, his body rolled back into his room and he fainted on the spot.

The other soldiers in the rooms were a step too late. They just happened to see an exceptional beauty gently wave her sleeve, and were horrified. However, as they still had their duty to carry out, they still mustered the courage to raise their blades. Unfortunately, all of their hands trembled.

“Ahem, it doesn’t have anything to do with you guys. All of you can return, ”Zu An said just then, emerging and sending the soldiers back.

The soldiers felt as if they received a great pardon. When they returned to their rooms, they were all filled with admiration. As expected of Sir Zu! He’s able to remain calm and composed even in front of a woman with such terrifying strength! He really is profound and unfathomable.

When the others returned to their room, Zu An greeted Yan Xuehen. “Big sis Yan, it has been a long time, but your grace is still as elegant as before.”

Yan Xuehen retorted coldly, “Who is your big sis?”

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +444 +444 +444…

Zu An didn’t feel embarrassed at all as he replied, “You, of course. I still can’t forget the scene of how we fought side by side back then…”

“I didn’t come here to reminisce about the past,” Yan Xuehen said, directly interrupting him. This rascal never had anything good to say. Who knew what he was really talking about when he said ‘battle’? She retorted, “You know what you did, and yet you still have the guts to face me right now?”

Zu An looked completely innocent as he asked, “What did I do? I’ve been here the entire time. Is there some kind of misunderstanding? Big sis Yan, if you don’t believe me, you can ask anyone here.”

Yan Xuehen sneered. “Oh? Then what you are saying is that another man stormed into Chu Chuyan’s room?”

Zu An was speechless. This woman normally looks as if she doesn’t care about anything, and yet she’s so fierce when she attacks.

Seeing as it was now related to Chuyan’s reputation, he had to admit, “Uh… it was my fault earlier. But I didn’t know that you would just happen to come back at that time either.”

“Oh? So it’s my fault in the end?” Yan Xuehen retorted, so angry that she was brought to laughter.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +518 +518 +518…

“That’s not what I’m saying. But seeing as Chuyan and I are married to begin with, even if we get a bit worked up, it’s not some unforgivable thing, right?” Zu An replied helplessly.

“The two of you have already divorced,” Yan Xuehen corrected Zu An, leaving him speechless. However, she felt that pretext was a bit of a stretch, so she could only continue, “You clearly promised me that you wouldn’t approach her for some time as it would affect her condition. Could it be that you actually want that Devil Sect witch to win instead, so you’re deliberately messing with Chuyan?”

“Of course not!” Zu An quickly explained, “I just… just couldn't hold back my emotions.”

“Couldn’t hold back your emotions…” Yan Xuehen felt all sorts of things when she heard those words. When she finally sorted out her thoughts, she said, “On top of that, you actually bullied Chuyan while Lou Wucheng and Zhi Yin were outside. Do you realize that Chuyan’s reputation will be completely ruined if this is exposed?”

Zu An was left in an awkward position. He really had acted a bit too impulsively back then.

Yan Xuehen also felt a bit strange discussing such things. She said with an unnatural expression, “I came to once again warn you not to disturb Chuyan again. Otherwise, don’t blame me for breaking all ties with you.” She didn’t wait for him to respond and flew away.

…

Zu An was a bit annoyed at first. Suddenly, however, he realized something and a smile spread across his face.

When Zu An returned to his room, Xie Daoyun emerged, looking worried and wrapped only in a coat. She asked, “Big brother Zu, what did Sect Master Yan say to you? The pressure she gave off just then was so scary!”

Zu An’s conversation with Yan Xuehen had been blocked off by a powerful wall of energy. No one apart from them had been able to hear what they were saying.

Zu An smiled and said, “It’s nothing; it was just a bit of a misunderstanding. Things have already been cleared up.”

Xie Daoyun was really impressed, saying, “Big brother Zu, you’re so amazing! You’re able to remain calm even in front of an angry grandmaster! There’s no way I could do something like that.”

“For better or for worse, Sect Master Yan and I are acquaintances. It’s different from when you faced the libationer,” Zu An said to console her, then said, “Alright, you should go to sleep. It’s already quite late.”

He noticed that his bed was still neat and orderly, which meant that she hadn’t actually gone to sleep. He knew she was shy, so he didn’t force the issue. Furthermore, now that he had returned, it would seem a bit suspicious for him to call her over to sleep in his bed. He was worn out from constantly running back and forth, and the great battle he had just experienced with Chuyan. Thus, he was fast asleep as soon as he hit the bed.

Xie Daoyun was in the room right next to him. As she heard his breathing, she found it hard to fall asleep.

…

Another night quickly passed just like that. However, the next day, all sorts of rumors suddenly spread all across Violet Mountain. All of them said that the White Jade Sect’s Fairy Chu had actually already gotten married before, and her husband was Zu An, who was currently on the mountain. The stories were told in vivid detail, shattering countless people’s hearts. All of Violet Mountain was thrown into a commotion.
