Chapter 1185: Escaped

Zu An felt a thud go off in his head. Oh no, I’ve stepped on a landmine.

Why the hell am I getting involved with these two sworn enemies?!

Before he could even say anything, Yan Xuehen couldn't stand it anymore and cried, “He is only speaking out for public justice! What are you getting mad at him for?!”

Yun Jianyue completely ignored her and looked at Zu An with an unkind expression, as if she were waiting for his reply.

“I…” Zu An was about to speak, but he suddenly vomited a mouthful of blood and rocked back and forth.

Yun Jianyue jumped in fright and quickly supported him, asking, “What’s wrong?”

Yu Yanluo noticed what was happening and rushed back, crying, “Ah Zu!”

Zu An chuckled and said, “It’s nothing,.I just used up a bit more strength than I expected just now. My body couldn't really handle it. I’ll be fine if I take a small breather.”

“Then hurry and adjust your breathing,” Yan Xuehen said. She quickly got off his back and sat down.

“Okay,” Zu An replied. He closed his eyes and began to circulate his ki.

Seeing that his aura was gradually becoming normal again, Yun Jianyue sighed in relief. Then, she gave Yan Xuehen a resentful look and said, “It’s all for the sake of saving this stone cold woman here that he used up so much of his energy. He even had to carry you afterward. Look at you, a high and mighty grandmaster, now fallen to this state. You might as well let a piece of tofu smash you to death.”

Yan Xuehen also felt conflicted inside, but she still couldn't take this from her arch-nemesis. She replied, “Wasn’t it because you were mean to him just now, and you were even picking a fight with him, that his internal energies were stirred up from anger? You still have the nerve to talk about me?!”

…

Neither woman was willing to give an inch. They both argued noisily.

While trying to adjust his breathing, Zu An sighed. What injury? He hadn’t known what to do just then, so he had just pretended to be injured. Now, it seemed to have worked quite well.

Suddenly, loud and clear smacks rang out. Zu An secretly opened his eyes to take a look, and saw that Yun Jianyue already had Yan Xuehen lying on her knees, spanking her full bottom again and again.

Yan Xuehen struggled frantically, but her injuries were worse and she was very weak. She couldn't struggle free at all. Yun Jianyue struck her until her bottom was jiggling around.

Is that area really that squishy… Zu An thought in absolute amazement. But he had learned his lesson and didn’t get involved this time.

Fortunately, Yu Yanluo walked over and called out, “Stop fighting, both of you! You’re disturbing Ah Zu’s healing.”

Only when she heard that did Yun Jianyue stop. She was quite proud of herself, her expression seeming to say ‘If you have the skills, come at me!’

Meanwhile, Yan Xuehen clutched her bottom, her expression full of humiliation and anger. She was so angry that she gritted her teeth. However, there was nothing she could do.

A while later, Zu An felt that it was about time. He then stopped pretending to recover and opened his eyes, saying, “I’m alright now. Let’s continue.”

Yan Xuehen’s cheeks were a bit red. She was clearly still embarrassed from being hit by Yun Jianyue, but still said, “I can walk on my own. You can get some rest.”

Zu An chuckled and replied, “It’s fine; my body is as tough as a bull’s. That was just a bit of an unexpected hiccup, but I’ve already recovered.” He didn’t wait for her to agree and squatted down, picking her up.

“Ah…” Yan Xuehen couldn't help but cry out in alarm when his hands touched her thighs.

“What is it?” Zu An asked, stunned.

“Nothing,” Yan Xuehen replied, her face turning a bit red. How could she tell him that her bottom still hurt from Yun Jianyue’s spanking?

The group continued forward. At first, Yan Xuehen was still trying not to let her body press against his, but she eventually grew weaker and weaker. She couldn't help but gently loosen her hand and press against him. Zu An noticed what she was doing and laughed involuntarily. He didn’t say anything and continued to carry her.

But soon afterward, Yan Xuehen became annoyed, because she discovered that their posture made them touch in various ambiguous places. After that happened a few times, she noticed her body reacting strangely. She couldn't help but feel more and more embarrassed. Helpless to do anything else, she could only put her arms tightly around Zu An’s neck and press against his back. Only then could she prevent those areas from rubbing from time to time.

She was still a bit embarrassed at first when she felt the heat from his wide back. However, when she saw that he wasn’t doing anything, she sighed in relief.

Zu An’s expression was quite strange. Never had he expected Yan Xuehen to actually be so blessed in ‘that’ area, even though she normally seemed so light and dainty. The heavy pressure really did stir something in him.

She’s Chuyan’s master! he quickly warned himself. Only then did he calm down.

Yan Xuehen also slowly calmed down. Then, she began to feel that his back was wide and warm, giving her a mysterious sense of safety.

The feeling of fatigue gradually overcame her; between her serious injuries and the treatment exhausting a lot of her energy, she unknowingly slipped into the land of dreams. The faint smile hanging from the edge of her lips was no longer that ice-cold, and instead seemed gentle and sweet.

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. This woman really did always put on an act. No wonder all the major powers treated her like some sort of immortal fairy.

…

After some time had passed, Yu Yanluo suddenly said happily, “I found a marking Maid Xing left behind.”

“Looks like they’re fine,” Zu An remarked, sighing in relief. The two of them had come here to save Maid Xing and the Snake race people to begin with. They had been starting to lose hope when they saw so many deathworms. Now, when they saw traces left by Maid Xing again, they finally calmed down a bit.

“Yup!” Yu Yanluo exclaimed excitedly. Her entire body was filled with energy.

The group’s pace quickened. As they moved through the complicated mines, the paths became wider and wider.

“We’re almost at the exit,” Yu Yanluo said excitedly as they arrived at a stone gate. She found a mechanism in the gate, then took out a jade pendant, inserting it into an indentation. Then, the assorted mechanisms spun at different angles.

Kacha!

Eventually, the stone door slowly opened.

Yu Yanluo turned around to call everyone. She was about to leave when several arrows suddenly flew at the group. Before she had time to react, however, Zu An quickly took a lightning step forward, striking down the arrows.

Soon after, several figures holding weapons attacked them. Zu An was about to counterattack when a pleasantly surprised voice called out from nearby, “All of you, stop! That is the madam and young master Zu!”

A fine-figured individual rushed over then. Who else could it be but Maid Xing?!

Meanwhile, the others were clearly the Snake race people who had been rescued from Cloudcenter Commandery. They were men and women who didn’t look much different from humans. Of course, upon closer inspection, one would find that their pupils were all vertical slits.

“Maid Xing!” Yu Yanluo cried. After seeing that they were all safe, she felt completely relaxed.

“Madam!” Maid Xing exclaimed. She and the others were even more shocked and overjoyed upon seeing Yu Yanluo.

Amid the moving reunion, Yan Xuehen woke up and asked, “What happened?”

Yun Jianyue said mockingly, “Look how soundly you were sleeping. I didn’t expect the White Jade Sect’s immortal goddess would actually drool. How shameless.”

Only then did Yan Xuehen notice that Zu An’s back was wet. She quickly wiped her own lips and mumbled, “So… Sorry.” She had blushed more times today than she ever had in her entire life.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Zu An chuckled and said, “It’s fine. You’re really weak right now, so this kind of thing is normal. It’ll all go away once you recover.”

Yan Xuehen felt warm inside when she heard his comforting words. Her awkwardness eased a bit.

“Damn brat, you really are good at making a girl happy,” Yun Jianyue remarked unhappily. But she didn’t say any more, worrying that she would make his injuries worsen.

Zu An chuckled awkwardly. He quickly introduced Maid Xing and the others to the two of them. As for Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen’s identity, he didn’t have to say anything. Instead, he just said that they were his good friends. After all, both of them had extraordinary statuses, and many people were related to them. It would be bad if news that the Snake race was allied with either of their factions got out.

The two women were both grateful. This fellow normally acted mischievously and frivolously, but he was actually quite the meticulous thinker. He knew when to make considerations for others.

After hearing that the two were Zu An’s friends, Maid Xing was extremely friendly. Seeing that they were injured, she even had the subordinates prepare a ‘carriage’ for them to rest in. However, the creatures that pulled the carriages weren’t horses, but rather lizard-like creatures.

Yu Yanluo explained, “There’s a Snake race supply point outside the cave on this side. It’s been waiting to receive us all this time.”

Maid Xing apologized and said, “Madam, young master Zu, I’m really sorry for attacking you all just now. Everyone was a bit on edge because strange, terrifying bugs were following us.”

Yu Yanluo quickly asked, “There were so many deathworms; how did you all escape?”
