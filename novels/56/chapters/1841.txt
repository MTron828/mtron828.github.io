Chapter 1790: Self-Sacrifice to Save Each Other

Zhao Han’s eyes narrowed. There were legends surrounding the Ghost King wherever he went. The Ghost King was clearly a being that was second to none, the number one ghost. Many of the rumors were a bit ridiculous, claiming things not even Zhao Han himself was capable of; he figured that most of these rumors were exaggerated, but there was a small chance that they were true. As such, he still felt some misgivings toward the Ghost King.

But he was someone who had always looked down on others, so how could he just give in here? He replied, “Hmph, just a trifling Ghost King. What does this emperor need to fear? Don’t vainly try to threaten me.”

He naturally didn’t intend to keep exchanging words with Zu An; instead, he shifted his gaze to Jing Teng and said, “Since you have something to do with Immortal Ruler Baopu, just come here.”

He immediately reached out toward her as he spoke. A giant golden hand formed in midair and tried to grab her. It seemed to be free from the restrictions of time and space and instantly arrived in front of Jing Teng.

When she sensed the terrifying pressure, Qiu Honglei instinctively released the light element’s absolute defense, the Wall of Sighs. Unfortunately, in front of Zhao Han, this skill that was known for its durability was like paper. The giant golden hand easily passed right through.

“The valiant shall join the formation in victory. The troops are up north; the black tortoise awaits its summons!” Jing Teng shouted.

A black tortoise projection appeared around her. It was actually able to just barely block the giant golden hand.

“Hm?” Zhao Han exclaimed, looking at the black tortoise in surprise. He hadn’t expected Jing Teng to be able to produce something so incredible with her cultivation. Despite that, in his eyes, she was still nothing more than an ant. He exerted a bit of force and the golden fist clenched.

Audible cracks filled the air. Soon after, the tortoise-shell projection was completely crushed by the great golden hand. Jing Teng was also grabbed by the giant golden hand and dragged in Zhao Han’s direction. Her eyes filled with despair. However, what was even more uncomfortable than that despair was the chill she felt in her heart. That person hadn’t done a thing from the start.

She laughed in self-mockery.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

That person will probably use this chance to run, right?

She had been betrayed once in the past, and now, she had been betrayed again.

Jing Teng, Jing Teng, why do you not learn from your mistakes?

However, for some reason, she still reflexively looked toward that person. Suddenly, she saw a trace of resplendent sword radiance. It was even more dazzling and brilliant than the sword ki she had seen on the way here. It was as if a river of stars had appeared before her very eyes.

The sword radiance that resembled a celestial stream crashed down on the giant golden hand and actually severed it at the wrist! The hand that trapped Jing Teng thus shattered to pieces, and she fell from the air.

Qiu Honglei moved first, catching her by the waist. When she saw Jing Teng’s shocked expression, she remarked in annoyance, “What are you staring like that for? Did you want him to catch you and spin a few times in the air or something?”

Jing Teng’s face reddened and she pushed Qiu Honglei away. She had already recovered her ability to move, so of course she didn’t need to be carried. Being so close to each other only intensified the tension between them, making her feel strange.

Qiu Honglei wasn’t in the mood to argue with her either. She moved over to Zu An’s side and prepared to support him.

…

At that moment, Zu An wasn’t thinking the slightest romantic thought; instead, he stared at Zhao Han with a grave expression, on guard against a sudden attack.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing’s eyes widened. They were completely stupefied by the sight.

What the hell is this? That was the emperor’s hand! The two of us wouldn’t be able to do a thing, and yet it was destroyed by a single sword slash from Zu An?

They had seen him fight on Violet Mountain. Even though it was stunning, Zu An’s performance hadn’t been this shocking. It seemed he had been holding back on purpose then. Both of them were sword users, so they naturally recognized just how powerful that sword strike was. It carried a sense of unparalleled might. It really was shocking. Just how old was Zu An? And yet, he was able to manifest that kind of sword intent!

Have we lived all these years for nothing?

Zhao Han also looked at Zu An in surprise, saying, “Unexpected, truly unexpected. You’ve actually already grown to this level. No wonder you were able to become the Fiend races’ Regent.”

He had already been a bit suspicious before. No matter how much the Fiend races had fallen, they were still an old rival that had clashed against the human race for so many years. Why had they suddenly let this little brat take the position of Regent? Back then, he had been suspicious that the newly risen Second Empress merely lusted after Zu An’s body. After all, this kid did have quite the skills with women. Only when he saw Zu An’s sword strike did he understand that it was well deserved.

Zu An said seriously, “We’re both trapped in a secret dungeon right now, and there’s an unpredictable Ghost King watching from the shadows. Is there a need for us to carry out internal conflict right now and let him take all the benefits?” He quickly added, “According to what I know, apart from the Ghost King, there are also the Divine Firmament Sect Master Sun En and Adventurer’s Guild Zang Ao. Both seem to have cultivation rivaling your majesty’s. They’d definitely be interested in this great tomb too and will most likely be here.”

Zhao Han briefly fell silent. A while later, he shook his head and said, “In the past, I might really have been convinced by your words. However, you just grow too quickly, to the point that even I feel a bit of pressure. If you’re allowed to continue growing, you might really be able to threaten me one day. It’s still more suitable to deal with you before you are allowed to fully mature.”

Zu An was speechless. Now that he received Zhao Han’s recognition, he didn’t even know whether to feel happy or upset.

Qiu Honglei quickly said, “You are the unrivaled emperor, the one countless cultivators revere. Shouldn’t you feel appreciation toward an outstanding junior? Furthermore, I heard that the truly strong all feel that being without equal is a kind of loneliness and that they seek worthy opponents their entire lives. Why are you thinking of killing someone early? Isn’t that just… lowering your status too much?”

She knew just how terrifying Zhao Han was. In the past, when her master had attained her profound cultivation, she hadn’t treated any other cultivators with any importance. In the end, Yun Jianyue had gone over to the Imperial Palace to attack it; and yet, she hadn’t even gotten to meet Zhao Han face to face before she was seriously injured. After that, Yun Jianyue had been in a bad mood for a long time. Qiu Honglei had no idea how her master had gotten rid of that mental shadow.

Now, even though Ah Zu was formidable, he wasn’t necessarily stronger than Yun Jianyue had been back then. He would definitely be in danger if he fought against the emperor. As such, Qiu Honglei tried to stir the emperor up with words and make him give up on fighting.

“What a clever and eloquent witch,” Zhao Han said with a smile. “Have you read too many of those fiction novels? Those who achieve great things naturally nip danger in the bud. How great is the feeling of being above all others? Who would want to be a masochist and look for someone of the same strength?”

In the past, when he and the Fiend Emperor were rivals, neither side had been able to do anything to the other. That was why he had never been able to take down the Fiend races. That was no happy thing. He had wished for the Fiend Emperor’s sudden death countless times.

Unfortunately, by the time that happened, he himself had begun approaching heaven and man deterioration. Compared to dealing with the Fiend Races, his own longevity was more important.

Qiu Honglei was speechless. She hadn’t expected the emperor to not have the eloquence of a master at all.

Jing Teng suddenly said, “Your attitude is wrong. Without the motivation of competition with a rival, it is completely impossible for you to achieve immortality purely by relying on yourself. If that’s your way of thinking, you won’t be able to advance any further in this life.”

Zhao Han’s expression darkened as he snapped, “Even someone with the cultivation of an ant like you is worthy of lecturing me?”

Sensing that the emperor was now truly angered, Zu An stepped in front of Jing Teng for fear that he would suddenly strike.

Jing Teng felt warm inside when she saw his movements. She held her head high without the slightest bit of fear, saying, “My cultivation is indeed comparable to an ant’s, but those words were not spoken by me; rather, they were said by the Immortal Ruler Baopu. Even though your cultivation is high, compared to the immortal ruler back then, it is still far off.”

Zhao Han’s expression changed. He asked, “This world really has immortals?”

“Of course,” Jing Teng replied. “Immortal Ruler Baopu was precisely an example.”

“Hahaha, it seems the heavens have finally taken pity on me and delivered an immortal opportunity,” Zhao Han said with a fanatical expression. The immortality he chased had always seemed to be a fleeting and illusory thing. Only now did he feel as if it really was almost within his grasp.

Even Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing were getting excited. After all, once a man got a government position, all his cronies would get in too. They would definitely…

Pah pah pah, like hell are we cronies!

“That only gives me more reason to not let you leave. I’ll get rid of that brat Zu An first,” Zhao Han suddenly said, laughing maliciously. He suddenly thrust his finger at Zu An. A golden finger instantly appeared by his forehead, so quickly that no one could react in time. That finger seemed to make even space itself collapse. If one were struck by this finger, it was clear that there would be absolutely no chance of survival.

“If you kill him, I definitely won’t tell you a single thing!” Jing Teng screamed.

Zhao Han’s eyes narrowed and he shifted his finger downward. He aimed at Zu An’s chest instead. However, Zu An quickly used Grandgale, instantly moving a hundred meters away.

Zhao Han calmly said, “Space is already meaningless to me.” He didn’t move at all, and yet the golden finger pursued Zu An relentlessly.

Zu An roared. His longsword left its scabbard, sending resplendent sword light pouring out. However, he didn’t hit anything, while the golden finger instantly pressed against his chest.

Pfft!

Blood gushed out from Zu An’s mouth as he was blown back like a tattered sack.

“Ah Zu!”

“Young master Zu!”

Qiu Honglei and Jing Teng were both horrified. They quickly ran over to check his condition.

Zhao Han said coldly, “Earlier, I simply didn’t try to defend. Since I’ve already seen that sword once, how can I let myself be hit again? If I gave you a few more years, with your sword intent, there would actually be a chance for you to face me. Unfortunately, you’re still far off now.”

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing exchanged a look. Both of them saw despair in each other’s eyes. Fortunately, they had submitted to the emperor and didn’t have to think about anything else.

Jing Teng saw that even though Zu An’s injuries were serious, there was no danger to his life. She sighed in relief. When she saw Zhao Han walk in their direction, she blocked his path and said, “Let him go and I’ll follow you!”

Zhao Han was a bit hesitant. He could catch both of them, but if he offended this woman and she ended her own life, that would be troublesome. After all, she was the only one who knew enough about Immortal Ruler Baopu.

Suddenly, Zu An’s hand rested on Jing Teng’s shoulder as she said, “Thank you, Miss Jing, but I’m not the type to survive because of a woman’s sacrifice.”

Jing Teng panicked and exclaimed, “Do you know what kind of situation we’re in? Yet you’re still trying to act tough!”

Qiu Honglei looked at her with a strange expression. You’re already willing to give up your own life to save him, and yet you’re still saying there’s nothing between you? However, they were facing a great disaster right now, so she didn’t have the time to be jealous either.

Zu An chuckled and said, “Don’t worry, I have a way of dealing with him.”

Zhao Han began to laugh out of annoyance. He repeated, “You have a way of dealing with me?”
