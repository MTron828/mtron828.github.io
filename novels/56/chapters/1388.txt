Chapter 1337: The Gamble

The butler gave the rocks on the table a look and said, “These four cost 1080 ki stones. However, since you are the princes’ friends, we can round it down to a thousand. You can purchase them for a thousand ki stones.”

There was such a great opportunity before him so how could he give up the chance to get along with the Lion Race’s princes?

Zu An wasn’t in a rush to reply and instead pretended to look at the other rocks on the table. He asked Ban Ka and Heichi Gu, “Do you all have any interest in gambling with us? If we miss on all four of these unpolished rocks, we’ll compensate both of you for the thousand ki stones. If there really is something in these rocks, then you’ll compensate us at a one to one ratio. Whatever the contents are worth, that’s how much you’ll compensate us for. What do you think?”𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ban Ka harrumphed. “Just give up on that thousand when you lose. Didn’t we give them to you in the first place?”

“What, are you scared?” Zu An retorted mockingly.

The risk of the bet was a bit too out of control. Ban Ka was about to refuse when Heichi Gu said, “Fine, I’ll take the bet with you.”

Unlike an out-of-towner like Ban Ka, he usually resided in the Fiend King Court. He obviously knew about the nature of a place like the Jade Garden. The prices of the unpolished gems in the yellow floor weren’t too high, so compared to the higher floors, the chance of getting something was quite low. Occasionally, something would appear, but even then, it wouldn’t be all that. The risk was within an acceptable degree.

That was why the chances of the two winning were much higher. Meanwhile, these people only had a thousand ki stones on them to begin with. How would they even be able to fork over another thousand ki stones? Either way, with the Snake race as the guarantors, he wasn’t all that scared of them going back on their debt. This was a good chance to embarrass them a bit.

Heichi Gu had played with Ban Ka previously and knew that he was quite the stingy player, the type who didn’t act without some incentive. Since even Heichi Gu had agreed, however, there was naturally no need for Ban Ka to be scared either.

If Zu An’s group lost and didn’t have money to pay them back, with how beautiful the Medusa Queen was, they’d just have her pay with her body. He began breathing heavily when he thought of that, quickly adding, “Count me in too!”

Many people got worked up. They had spent quite a bit of time on the yellow floor, and so they obviously knew the probability of success. They’d be fools to not take the opportunity for such easy money. Either way, this was the Snake race clan leader they were talking about. There was no way she would renege on her debt, right? As such, they all shouted that they wanted to join in.

“Isn’t that a bit too much? What if we lose…” Zu An said with a troubled expression.

Yun Jianyue grinned. This guy was definitely planning to scam people again. Sigh, it really is a pity that he didn’t join our Holy Sect.

However, she suddenly remembered how he had seen everything before. Her smile instantly froze. Hmph, if this guy had really joined the Holy Sect, I would’ve already thrown him out to be used as fertilizer.

On the other hand, Yan Xuehen felt a bit strange. She had previously thought that she really disliked Zu An’s slick-tongued behavior and found it really annoying, but now, she discovered that it was nothing more than a mask he used to hide his real intentions. In reality, he was actually rather cool-headed, and would lead his opponents into his own control bit by bit. They wouldn’t even know that they had already fallen into his trap. That level of intellect really was admirable.

All of a sudden, her expression stiffened. because she suddenly realized something. Did he also trick me?

…

Someone got scared that Zu An would go back on the deal and said, “It’s fine. We’re not even making you pay up right now. The Snake race is so big, we aren’t scared that you won’t be able to pay us back or anything like that.”

“Exactly. If you won, just how much would that be worth? Just thinking about it already brings me a wonderful feeling.”

“Right? I once heard from a merchant who came back from Brightmoon City that there was a young man who made several million from just a few dozen silver. Who knows, you might be next!”

…

Yan Xuehen and the other women had strange expressions. Why did that last story sound so familiar?

Zu An’s eyes lit up. He quickly ran over to Yu Yanluo’s side and began to try to convince her. The others could even hear what he was saying to try and convince Yu Yanluo.

The onlookers all sneered. Look at how blinded he is by greed. He can only think of how much he can make, and yet he has no idea just how badly he’ll lose.

Yu Yanluo appeared to be quite troubled on the surface too. In the end, she nodded slightly and said, “Alright, then let’s just do it once.”

The others sighed in relief when they heard her agree. After all, in their eyes, the Medusa Queen was the one who had the final say.

Zu An looked toward Shi Min and said, “The three princes over here, are you all going to join in on this?”

Shi Ming chuckled and replied, “Since everyone is getting so excited, then count me in too.”

Shi Rong and Shi Gong both said in agreement, “We’ll do it too.”

Zu An was stunned. He had thought that they would refuse at first. After all, these four rocks were the ones they had chosen. If they knew there was something inside, weren’t they just screwing themselves over? However, he quickly stopped thinking about that. That was none of his business anyway. He’d just worry about anything else when it happened.

Thus, he said to the butler next to him, “I’ll have to trouble your distinguished self to serve as a witness.” With so many people present, there was no way he could make them all write a pledge, right?

The butler nodded and said, “Do not worry. No one dares to go back on any fair bets in the Jade Garden.”

He carried a bit of pride in his voice when he said that. Perhaps there would be some people he couldn't offend on the heaven or immortal floors, but he was confident he could deal with these yellow floor people.

The Lion race’s princes were a bit troubled when they heard this, but these were people they had brought over, and the bet was something they had already agreed to, so there was no going back on it.

“Alright, have you all decided?” Ban Ka asked. He was getting a bit impatient.

Yu Yanluo didn’t pay him any attention and slowly walked around the hall. She was worried that Shi Min would do something underhanded, so she still checked the area herself to make sure.

As her dress moved gently with her graceful figure, paired with her beautiful, focused countenance, the hall couldn't help but fall silent. It was as if all of them were scared of disturbing her. Even though many of them had stakes against her, they didn’t say anything either. They just greedily took in her beauty.

Many people began breathing hurriedly. Later, when the Snake race took on a huge debt, would they be able to enjoy a bit of the Medusa Queen’s wonderful aroma for themselves?

However, when they saw that she seemed to know what she was doing while she was studying the rocks, some people began to panic. Ban Ka snapped in annoyance, “Are you done picking yet? Hurry up! You don’t need to look at the others! Every single one of them is more expensive than a thousand ki stones. You can’t buy them even if you look at them!”

As if she had heard what he said, Yu Yanluo returned to Shi Min and the others. She looked at the four unpolished rocks, seemingly lost in thought.

“What’s wrong? Is there a problem?” Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen secretly asked.

Yu Yanluo replied, “I’ve looked them over for a bit, but these are indeed the ones that have the highest chance of having something. Why is Shi Min being so nice to us, though?”

Even though she had managed the Yu clan’s gemstone business for many years and had abundant experience, it was only a bit better than an ordinary person’s. Not even the greatest master with the sharpest insight could have a hundred percent accuracy. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be called rock betting, but rather just throwing money away. That was why she had been worried that there might be something wrong with the rocks.

On the contrary, Zu An was much more relaxed. He said, “Don’t think too much about it. Who knows, he might have just suggested these to scam us, but had no idea that there was actually something inside.”

Yu Yanluo felt that Shi Min’s group wouldn’t be so simpleminded, but she still chose to trust Zu An in the end, saying, “Alright, I’ll choose these four then.” After she spoke, she handed over the two bags from before to the butler.

Ban Ka and Heichi Gu’s eyelids twitched. That was their money, after all.

One of the butler’s workers stepped forward to receive the money. The butler then walked up to the table and said, “Since a bet has already been made, I will personally open the stone.”

With his qualifications, normally, he wouldn’t personally do the deed in the black and yellow floors. The reason why he had made an exception this time was because of the Lion race’s princes and the Medusa Queen.

He took out one of the unpolished rocks. He didn’t use any tools, and instead used his hand as the blade, slicing down through the side of the stone. Just like that, the sturdy stone was sliced as easily as tofu. Quite a few people in the surroundings narrowed their eyes. This Jade Garden was different after all! Even a butler was that skilled.

Then, the butler ran his hand gently over the stone. It was shaved off layer by layer, becoming smaller and smaller. In the end, there were only ash-colored remains. The butler shook his head and said, “There was nothing inside.”

Cheers resounded from all around. Those who were betting all sighed in relief. What were they so worried about? This yellow floor’s stones definitely wouldn’t produce treasure that easily. Furthermore, the four stones were considered poor-quality ones even on the yellow floor.

Yu Yanluo’s expression remained calm. This was something that happened all too regularly. No one could guess every single one correctly.

Next, however, the butler took out another stone. It was still empty.

Ban Ka and Heichi Ran both smiled. They were already excited thinking about the Medusa Queen begging them for mercy with a tear-stained face.
