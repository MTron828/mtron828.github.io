Chapter 1530: Naught But a Kun Fish Fry

With Yun Jianyue’s hard work clearing up his meridians, Zu An’s ki became much calmer. At the same time, the inner demon also gradually came under control. When he became clear-headed again, he didn’t dare to believe what he was seeing. He actually had such an intimate experience with big sis Yun?

Still, he quickly remembered every scene from before. Previously, everything that happened had been because he was spurred on by the inner demon, but that didn’t mean he had lost his memories. At that instant, he even felt that the inner demon wasn’t all that hateful after all.

When he saw the traces on Yun Jianyue’s body, Zu An felt a sense of pity. He wanted to properly console her. However, his energy suddenly became restless again. His expression changed. He quickly asked Yun Jianyue about it.

“You’re still not done?” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, her expression changing. Even though she was a world-famous demoness, she wasn’t that different from a young noble virgin in terms of ‘that’. She had needed to rely on her grandmaster constitution to endure, and thought that phase had finally ended. How could she have predicted that it was just the beginning?

Zu An cried bitterly, “I previously absorbed all of Sir Fu’s cultivation. He was a grandmaster who was famous for many years, so you know how great his cultivation was. How could it be that easily digested?”

Yun Jianyue knew about Zu An’s Heaven Devouring Sutra and felt that what he said made sense. If Sir Fu’s cultivation could only provide a single rank, he wouldn’t deserve to have been a grandmaster.

“You should focus on adjusting your condition now. Either way, your inner demon is now more or less dealt with,” Yun Jianyue said, biting her lip. Her once-domineering expression had given way to a mix of annoyance and playful pouting.

She tried to get up to leave afterward, but Zu An hugged her firmly and said, “I have no experience in this field! What if I end up experiencing cultivation deviation? That’s why I need big sis to help me.”

Wouldn’t he be a dummy if he had such a great big sister but didn’t use her?

He had to admit that even though Yun Jianyue was from the Devil Sect, she was the real deal in the field of cultivation. When she was instructing Zu An earlier, they hadn’t wasted any time with detours. He had been able to break through into the essence form stage at the fastest possible rate.

Yun Jianyue was a bit hesitant, but she also knew that what he said was true. Sir Fu had absorbed too many strong individuals’ blood and cultivation, making his ki muddled and volatile. If she hadn’t purified all the ki once over for Zu An, he might have already experienced cultivation deviation. If she left him to his own devices and something happened, all of their efforts would have been for nothing.

“Alright then, I’ll help you this one time. But you’re not allowed to move around randomly!” Yun Jianyue replied, staring at Zu An fiercely. Earlier, she’d had to help him with his inner demon while also enduring all of the outrages he committed. She didn’t want to go through that again.

“No problem!” Zu An immediately agreed.

“But that’s what you said last time too!” Yun Jianyue replied with a skeptical expression.

“If you already knew I wouldn’t follow that, why are you still asking me?” Zu An asked with a big smile.

“Little An, I’m going to bite you to death!” Yun Jianyue snapped, baring her fangs, but in the end, she didn’t do anything.

…

After a long time passed, Yun Jianyue felt as if the number of times she had rolled her eyes was far greater than in the first half of her life. It really was the way old stores always described it. Sometimes, one could go three years without much business, but after getting some, it would all come at the same time.

Thankfully, Zu An had recovered his intellect from his inner demon, so Yun Jianyue didn’t have to work as hard as before. She was even able to calm herself down before examining his condition. Still, a blush covered her entire body.

Yun Jianyue released a long sigh. After quite some time, her wet hair was left askew. She eventually said in a weak voice, “The hero stage is when the impure flame is created, and the essence stage is when the impure flame is at its strongest. It’s really easy to be possessed by an inner demon then, if you’re not careful. The core form stage is when the impure flame is fully under control.

“Currently, your cultivation has received a boost from Sir Fu’s lifetime of cultivation, which is why you’ve saved decades, or perhaps even more than a century compared to others. I didn’t expect your talent to be that high, that you could immediately control the impure flame. In the past, I forgot how many times I failed before I was able to just barely get it under control.”

Zu An’s nose immediately pointed into the sky. He said with a smile, “All this was because big sis Yun taught me by example.”

Yun Jianyue’s face heated up a bit. Why does this phrase sound so strange today?

However, she suddenly remembered all the dregs of society back at the Devil Sect. Even though they didn’t dare to behave disrespectfully in front of her, they were really brazen in their private discussions. Once, when she was passing by, she had seen some people clutching their waists while saying ‘only cows die from overwork; no fields are ruined from being plowed’.

So by now, those guys probably would have had their bodies worn out by women, because those men were no good, right…?

Still, she quickly tossed that thought out of her mind and said, “Honestly, you should be thanking me. I really wonder if I owed you a debt in my last life or something.”

Zu An smiled and was about to reply when his expression changed again. He exclaimed, “Oh no, it seems as if it can still go higher!”

Yun Jianyue’s eyes widened in disbelief. She didn’t say anything and struggled to leave. However, Zu An wrapped his arms around her again and said, “My dear big sis, help me one last time, please!”

“That’s what you said last time too!” Yun Jianyue protested.

Zu An replied, “This is really the last time! Sir Fu’s cultivation is almost exhausted~”

Yun Jianyue’s face turned red and white. Still, she knew this was an opportunity cultivators could only beg for. If she could help Zu An become a bit stronger, she had to do it.

Sigh, I’m really about to be ruined from this plowing…

After an unknown amount of time passed, Zu An finally calmed down. He sat up to meditate and adjust his cultivation.

Meanwhile, Yun Jianyue instructed him, saying “I didn’t expect you to have covered that much distance, actually going from the hero form stage through the essence form stage, and all the way from the core form stage to the power soul stage! Even though you’re only at the early power soul stage, you’ve already reached a level that’s surpassed by none. From now on, you need to cultivate properly and find some treasures to nurture your heart. Then, you can truly reach the peak of the power soul stage.”

Masters at the power soul stage didn’t have to rely on external forces anymore. They had powerful physical strength. It was the stage many people called the ‘power to uproot mountains’ stage, so it was easy to imagine just how mighty it was.

This little monster Zu An has already had his body refined several times by the Primordial Origin Sutra. To a certain extent, his body is even a bit tougher than others at the power soul stage, even though he hasn’t finished it yet. So, once he reaches the peak of this level, his strength will climb drastically once more.

Yun Jianyue’s face was rosy. Her earlier fatigue had already been completely swept away. In the end, that was all due to Zu An’s abundant ‘essence’.

Sigh, I passed on knowledge to him, while he granted me liquid…

Her face turned red when she thought of that. As expected of the legendary transcendent aptitude! Not only had her hidden injuries been completely healed, her cultivation rank that had remained at a bottleneck for so long was also showing signs of a breakthrough.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

I really want to haul this kid back with me to the Holy Sect to cultivate with me every day. Then, wouldn’t I be able to completely trample on that stone cold woman?

Still, she abandoned that tempting thought. Zu An had a brighter future. If he were really tied down now, she wouldn’t necessarily like such a man either.

Meanwhile, Zu An was digesting all of the knowledge Yun Jianyue had passed onto him. He was suddenly startled, because he could feel a large diagram lighting up within his body.

It was the Kun Peng diagram!

Previously, when Yan Xuehen used her own body to save him, the diagram had appeared when he first broke through into the master rank.

He wasn’t all that surprised, because the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra gave him a new bird diagram whenever he broke through a major cultivation rank. They always came with their respective special abilities.

However, the Kun Peng diagram was the first one that had gone dark again after it first appeared. It hadn’t appeared again no matter how Zu An tried to bring it out. He hadn’t expected it to appear again today, and fully activated, no less.

If Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue found out they had both helped him complete the Kun Peng together, just what kind of reaction would they have?

He gave up on that thought quickly. Instead, he began to inspect what kind of skill the Kun Peng had given him.

Naught but a Kun fish fry in the beginning, but devours all once evolved!

When he saw the message from the Keyboard System, Zu An was filled with confusion.
