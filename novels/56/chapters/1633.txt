Chapter 1582: Moving Through the Night

Both Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang were excited to obtain such important information. The danger was worth the risk! If they escorted these criminals back to the capital, it would definitely be a tremendous contribution. It was all thanks to Sir Zu’s heroic prowess!

It was natural for their attitudes to change so suddenly. After all, having witnessed Zu An’s strength, they had realized how laughable their prior jealousy was. They were never even in the same race to begin with.

Sir Zu’s future was limitless; a trifling Armed Escort Division General position wasn’t the end point of his career. Once he was promoted, as his former subordinates, they would have a greater chance of replacing him than others. If they didn’t cling onto him now, they would be fools.

After asking the bandits a few more things and seeing that they didn’t have much more intelligence, the deputy generals decided to regroup with the main army first.

Zu An said to Xie Daoyun, “I heard that you were going to Violet Mountain from your little brother. Our destination this time is also Violet Mountain, so why don’t we just travel together? We’ll be able to look after each other too.”

Xie Daoyun blushed a bit. She knew he was only saying that out of respect for her. Was she qualified to look after him?

“Thank you, big brother Zu,” she eventually replied. She really had been frightened badly by the prior events and didn’t want something similar to happen again. Staying with the Armed Escort Army was much safer.

Most importantly, I can be together with big brother Zu…

She secretly snuck Zu An a look, her heart pounding.

…

Along the way, Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang gave their own mounts to Zu An and Xie Daoyun like true lackeys. Even though master rank cultivators could fly, it still consumed a lot of ki and exhausted them.

Zu An thought about Xie Daoyun’s condition and decided not to refuse their good intentions. However, Xie Daoyun really was too weak at the moment, and because her mind had been exhausted severely, she swayed from side to side on the horse and almost fell several times. Zu An was really worried, so he decided to put her in front of him and ride the same horse together.

Xie Daoyun instinctively opened her mouth, but in the end, she didn’t say anything. When she felt his strong arms, she felt as if streaks of electricity were running through her entire body. Her heart began beating quickly.

“Your health comes first. I hope little sister Daoyun doesn’t mind,” Zu An said to comfort her.

“I don’t mind. Thank you, big brother Zu,” Xie Daoyun said, pursing her lips. She had a lot of things to say, but she didn’t even know how to start because of how nervous she was feeling.

When she felt his warm and strong body, it gave her a strange sensation of peace. Carried by the horse’s rhythmic movements, fatigue overtook her quickly. Her head leaned to one side, and she fell asleep while resting against Zu An’s chest.

…

When she woke up, she discovered that she was already lying on a bed. She was incredibly shocked! She immediately stood up and removed the covers to look down. When she saw that her clothes were still intact, she sighed in relief. Then, she couldn't help but laugh to herself. What was she worried about? Big brother Zu wasn’t that kind of person.

Only then did she have a chance to size up her surroundings. She discovered that she was inside a tent, and it was already dark outside. The Armed Escort Division had probably already set up camp.

She could vaguely make out a bonfire burning outside. There were many soldiers gathered around the bonfire, loudly chatting about something. When she pricked up her ears, she overheard that those who had witnessed Zu An’s power during the day seemed to be talking with their companions about how he had defeated a thousand man army. Cries of shock filled the air. It was clear that just hearing about it left them amazed.

When she sensed their adoration for Zu An, Xie Daoyun couldn't help but smile. A proud feeling couldn't help but arise within her. She was stunned when she realized that, though. Why did she feel that way?

Suddenly, the covers moved as Zu An walked in. He said, “Hm? So you were already awake.”

Xie Daoyun touched her cheek in embarrassment, replying, “I really acted rather clumsily and let Sir Zu see a poor side of me.” A woman from a wealthy family such as her definitely wouldn’t meet any guests without getting herself ready, let alone under covers. She felt completely exposed.

Sensing her embarrassment, Zu An laughed and said, “Little sister Daoyun is so pretty. Even though you’ve just woken up, you’re still as beautiful as a sunrise. Why would it be a poor side of you?"

“Actually, when I covered you up, I was wondering whether to remove your outer clothes so you could sleep more comfortably. But when I realized that would be a bit rude, I gave up on the thought. I’m glad I didn't do anything, or else it might have tarnished little sister’s reputation and integrity.”

“Big brother Zu~” Xie Daoyun quickly protested playfully in response to his teasing. Subsequently, the two of them joked around with each other for a bit. The atmosphere noticeably eased up quite a bit; in the end, she wasn’t as shaken up and uncomfortable as before.

“I really have to thank big brother Zu for today, or else the consequences would have been unimaginable,” Xie Daoyun said. She wanted to get up and bow toward him, but she realized that she was still under the covers, so she quickly returned to bed.

Zu An indicated that there was no need for her to be so courteous, then said, “To be honest, it’s pretty incredible how we were brought together. You left several days before us, and yet we still encountered each other. Actually, Xie Xiu even asked me to take care of you when we met. To that day would come so quickly!”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Looks like I didn’t dote on that brat for nothing,” Xie Daoyun said with a grin. She felt a warm sense of being home when she heard that response. However, she suddenly noticed that Zu An’s expression was a bit strange, as if there was something he couldn't talk about. She couldn't help but ask, “Big brother Zu, what’s wrong?”

Zu An couldn't help but chuckle. He said, “It’s just that I remembered what he warned me about before I left. He said I should take care of you, but not take care of you all the way to bed. And yet now, the very first time I met you, I ended up taking care of you in bed.”

Xie Daoyun’s face quickly turned completely red. She cried, “What kind of nonsense is that damned brat spouting? Big brother Zu is a gentleman; why would you act like a playboy like him? He really is judging a nobleman with the heart of the petty!” 

Zu An felt a bit of guilt, because he wasn’t really as good as she made him out to be. He asked, “How do you feel right now?”

“Thanks to big brother Zu’s spiritual spring, I feel much better than before, but I’m still really tired. My entire body feels especially exhausted,” Xie Daoyun said as she rubbed her temples, giving off a hint of delicate beauty.

“Spiritual fatigue isn’t so easy to recover from, after all,” Zu An said as he carried a plate he had brought inside next to the bed. “You’ve been on the run for several days in a row, so you must be hungry. Use this chance to eat a bit. Unfortunately, the army doesn’t pay much attention to food, so I hope little sister Yun is okay with it.”

“I’m not such a finicky person,” Xie Daoyun said. When she confirmed that her clothes and pants were intact, she decided to get out of bed. As she saw the plate of food, her eyes lit up. “Barbecue? I’ve always wanted to eat this, but the people back at home never let me.”

“I just casually roasted it, so it might not be to your taste,” Zu An said, handing her a lamb rack.

Xie Daoyun began looking for utensils, but when she saw him demonstrate how to eat it, she realized that she was supposed to eat it with her hands. She blushed a bit. That really didn’t match a distinguished daughter’s behavior.

Still, she actually liked new things, so she just took it with her hands. At first, she cared a bit about how she looked. She ate slowly and even tried to pay attention to what she looked like to Zu An while eating. But in the end, she was no match for her body’s honesty. She had been chased for several days in a row and hadn’t had time to eat a proper meal. Her stomach was already rumbling with hunger, so she quickly wolfed it down.

The two of them had endless things to talk about. The atmosphere became more and more enthusiastic. However, when Xie Daoyun finished eating, she felt a bit of guilt. She had always been taught not to speak while eating. Just now, however, big brother Zu had seen her behaving crudely.

Ah, that’s not even the most important part. I’m together with another man, alone in the same room in the middle of the night. What if later, big brother Zu…

While all kinds of thoughts ran through Xie Daoyun’s mind, Zu An said, “Then, I won’t disturb little sister’s rest. I’ll give an order forbidding anyone from entering this place. You should get some rest. I’ll be leaving.”

When she saw him leave, Xie Daoyun couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed and frustrated. She had been worried that he would do something, wondering whether resisting would ruin their relationship. And yet, now that he had left so directly, it made her question life itself.

Zu An naturally didn’t know what she was thinking. When he returned to his own tent, he quickly changed into his Golden Token Eleven outfit. In order to prevent others from associating his two identities, he made sure to have them visibly leave in separate directions.

He had to make a trip to Yi Commandery at night and see if Xiao Jianren had found out anything. At the same time, he needed to make sure that no one suspected that Zu An and Golden Token Eleven were the same people by playing both roles while they were far away from each other.
