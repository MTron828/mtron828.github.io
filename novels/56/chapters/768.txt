Chapter 749, Part 1: Ambush and Black-Clad Woman

Translator: Pika

“Why?” Murong Qinghe was stupefied. Wouldn’t normal people at least refuse tactfully? That way, she could at least still accept it. Yet this fellow didn’t behave the expected way at all and had refused so ruthlessly.

Zu An remarked indifferently, “Why would I save a man who approached my wife with bad intentions?”

Murong Qinghe bit her lip. However, her tone eased up as well. “I know my clan brother was wrong, but I think he’s already been taught enough of a lesson. Also, I can promise you that he definitely won’t have any thoughts he shouldn’t have in the future, or else I’ll help you beat him up.”

“It sounds like you previously approved of him getting close to Chuyan…?” Zu An’s voice became increasingly cold.

Chu Youzhao began to panic as she listened from the side. She was about to speak out for her childhood friend, but Chu Chuyan grabbed her sleeve and shook her head. She clearly realized that something was off too.

When they went out for a walk that day, Murong Qinghe seemed to have deliberately led them towards Chongwen Gate. She hadn’t felt any suspicion back then, but now, it seemed as if she had deliberately played the matchmaker.

“I’m really sorry.” Murong Qinghe had only thought that her clan brother could help her with Chu Youzhao if he ended up with Chu Chuyan, and all of them would be even closer then. However, even though she was normally quite bold, how could she bring out such a reason now? She could only apologize shamefully.

Zu An remained indifferent. He sat down on a chair off to the side and poured some tea. He seemed to be implying for her to leave when he began to sip his tea. Murong Qinghe felt more and more sullen. It was too awkward to stay, yet if she left now, she would become hostile with the Chu clan. She was stuck in a dilemma.

Chu Chuyan couldn’t bear to watch any longer and said, “Qinghe, we’ve known each other for a long time now. If you have anything you wish to say, you can say it directly to me. There’s no need to play these types of tricks.”

“Sorry, big sis Chu. I won’t do it again.” Murong Qinghe was also incredibly vexed. She really had gone completely stupid this time. She had seen just how close Chu Chuyan and Zu An were, yet she’d actually thought that her idiot of a clan brother had a chance of success! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Chu Chuyan smiled, and then looked at Zu An. “Ah Zu, Little Qinghe has already admitted her wrongs. She’s been good friends with Chu Youzhao since she was little, and she’s also a good friend of mine. Let’s just leave this matter at that.”

“Since you’re the one saying so, then how can I be unreasonable?” A gentle smile appeared on Zu An’s face.

“Brother-in-law is the best!” Chu Youzhao had been really hard-pressed this entire time as well. On one side was her childhood friend, while on the other was her sister and brother-in-law. She had really felt awful being in the middle. Now that she saw that they had already buried the hatchet, she finally sighed in relief.

“Big brother Zu really is generous.” Murong Qinghe bit her lip. After a bit of hesitation, she asked, “Then, about my clan brother…”

“It’s not impossible for me to save him, but you have to promise me something,” Zu An said seriously.

Murong Qinghe quickly smiled and said, “Big brother Zu, please speak! Forget about a single condition, even if it’s ten, I can agree to all of them!”

“Don’t count your chickens before they hatch.” Zu An had an ambiguous smile on his face. “My condition isn’t something so easily met.”

Murong Qinghe gulped when she saw his strange smile. “What kind of condition is it?”

Chu Chuyan and Chu Youzhao pricked up their ears, but Zu An waved his hand, gesturing for them to leave first. Chu Chuyan frowned, but she didn’t say anything. She knew that there was someone else who definitely wouldn’t be able to hold herself back.

Sure enough, Chu Youzhao immediately shouted, “Why do we have to go outside too? Are you going to bully Little Qinghe?”

Murong Qinghe cried out in alarm and subconsciously took a step back. She was on guard as she looked at Zu An.

Zu An really was left speechless. Eventually he asked, “Am I really that bad in your eyes?”

Chu Youzhao and Murong Qinghe both nodded at the same time as the scene of how he had tormented Chu Chuyan appeared in their heads. Ah… Our faces are heating up.

Zu An said impatiently, “I need to discuss the condition with her. You guys are close, so of course you’ll defend her. How can I discuss these things with her if you two speak on her behalf? But if I don’t help her, she might have a grudge. That’s why it’ll be better if you two aren’t here.”

Chu Chuyan knew what he was saying. She said with a smile, “Then we’ll wait for you next door.” Then, before Chu Youhao could say anything in response, she grabbed her and left.

…

While the sisters were next door, Chu Youzhao paced back and forth in agitation. At the same time, she pressed her ears against the wall to see if she could hear anything.

Chu Chuyan gave her an annoyed look and asked, “What are you so worried about?”

Chu Youzhao harrumphed. “Who knows what that perverted brother-in-law will do to Little Qinghe!”

“Your brother-in-law isn’t that type of person.” Chu Chuyan blushed as she spoke. She quickly explained, “Even though he’s… a bit perverted, he’s able to discern between simple and serious matters. He won’t do anything to Little Qinghe. It’s instead you that I’m concerned about. Why do you care so much? What kind of thoughts do you have toward Qinghe?”

“What do you mean, what kind of thoughts?” Chu Youzhao asked, stunned.

Chu Chuyan sighed. “Did you forget that you’re a girl? No matter how good your relationship with her is, you can never get married. The reason you got close to her was just so she could help you hide your true identity. But what if you really forget your true mission?”

Chu Youhao curled her lips and said quietly, “I understand.” She couldn’t help but become sad.

Chu Chuyan then said, “It’s because we have to let down Little Qinghe that we have to do our best to make it up to her. That’s why I didn’t bicker too much about how she tried to set me up with her clan brother. Afterward, I’ll try to convince your brother-in-law to help her too.”

Chu Youzhao voiced her understanding. She seemed a bit unhappy to be reminded that the two of them had no future.

Chu Chuyan sighed. They really had treated her unfairly… The Chu clan had placed all of the responsibility on her little sister, and a young lady’s happiness might even be affected.

Chu Youzhao’s eyes suddenly lit up. She said excitedly, “I just thought of a perfect solution that will satisfy everyone!”

“What is it?” Chu Chuyan was confused. She didn’t know what could make her little sister suddenly become so happy.

Chu Youzhao said, “I can marry Little Qinghe!”

Chu Chuyan retorted impatiently, “What are you thinking? You might be able to trick her now, but what about after you get married? You can’t consummate the marriage.”

“Brother-in-law can take my place,” Chu Youzhao said matter-of-factly. Chu Chuyan was left speechless.

Chu Youzhao continued, “I believe that with how Qinghe feels about me, she won’t care that I’m a girl. But we still need a child, and it’ll be too unfortunate if Qinghe can never experience the feeling of a man. We can just get brother-in-law to help… Ah! Big sis, why are you hitting me? Ouch… ouch, ouch…”

…

Meanwhile, on the other side, Zu An sized up Murong Qinghe. He had to admit that she was a beauty in the making. Her tanned skin gave her a healthy and fit aesthetic. She seemed extremely lively and energetic.

Murong Qinghe was a bit frightened when she saw that he was examining her. She asked, “Big brother Zu, what is the condition?”

Zu An replied, “I’ve never been all that charitable of a person. I don’t really have any interest in helping people who have nothing to do with me. That’s true for you as well, unless… you become one of my people.”

Murong Qinghe jumped in fright. She quickly covered her collar and said, “Big brother Chu and I have been childhood lovers since we were young, and you’re his sister’s husband. How can you…”

Zu An cut her off impatiently. “What kind of nonsense are you thinking about? I’m asking you if you like Youzhao.”

Murong Qinghe’s face instantly turned red. She gave the wall an embarrassed look. There were many things she couldn’t say because of her young lady’s bashfulness, but she was a bit of a tomboy anyway, so she was a bit bolder. After a bit of hesitation, she still quietly voiced a confirmation.

“How much do you like him?” Zu An asked. “What if he encountered something one day and was no longer the way he looks now… or what if he got injured and became a cripple? What would you do? Would you still like him?” Um… she doesn’t have one down there, so that could be considered somewhat similar to being a cripple, right? Sigh… Youzhao, Youzhao… Look how far I am going for your sake.

Murong Qinghe immediately cut him off. A firm and steady expression appeared on her face. “I like who he is, and not anything else. No matter what kind of person he becomes, I will still like him. Also, I’ve already vowed to myself that I won’t marry anyone other than big brother Chu in this life.”
