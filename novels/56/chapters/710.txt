Chapter 694: Auntie, I Don’t Want to Work Anymore

Translator: Pika

The driver with the missing tooth was watching vigilantly the entire time. When he heard the madam cry out in alarm, his expression suddenly changed. He instantly appeared next to the carriage. “Madam, what happened?”

He didn’t dare go inside, because his madam didn’t like to meet with people. Normally, he couldn’t enter her private space without her permission.

Chu Youzhao and Murong Qinghe also rushed over, but there was no way they could match the driver’s speed. They arrived a bit later.

Murong Qinghe tugged on Chu Youzhao’s sleeves. She said with a strange expression, “Big brother Chu, your brother-in-law really is…”

Her face turned red. She couldn’t bring herself to continue.

Chu Youzhao also stomped her feet in annoyance. “Who is my brother-in-law? I don’t have such a perverted brother-in-law!”

You have successfully trolled Chu Youzhao for +223 +223 +223…

Murong Qinghe wrinkled her nose. Who was the one who kept saying brother-in-law earlier?

The madam’s voice sounded again from inside the carriage. “Nothing… It’s nothing. Uncle Fu, please help me keep watch outside. Do not let anyone near.”

The driver with the missing tooth was still hesitant. “Madam, is there really nothing wrong?”

He was worried that she might only be saying this because she was being threatened inside.

The madam’s voice sounded again. “Don’t worry, I am fine. I have some things I wish to talk to him about. You only need to stand guard outside.”

Then, a blue layer of light appeared around the carriage. The driver knew that a restriction that cut off all sound was activated.

Only the madam knew about this. This wasn’t possible unless she wanted to activate it herself.

He sighed in relief when he thought of this. “Then this old servant will wait outside.”

He shooed away Chu Youzhao and Murong Qinghe while saying this.

At the same time, he was inwardly shocked. The madam actually activated this formation! Looks like she really did trust this brat. Otherwise, if there were any dangers that happened inside, no one would save her even if she screamed her lungs out.

Chu Youzhao was blown away by an invisible force. She was upset. “What is your madam doing by locking up my brother-in-law? Are you plotting against him?”

“The madam? Plotting against your brother-in-law?” The driver almost laughed out of irritation. The number of men who wanted to scheme against their madam in the capital might be enough to wrap around the capital itself three times over if they lined up from the palace gates. Who is the one scared of who here?

While they were bickering with each other, a stunning madam was currently lying down on a soft seat. Her enchanting and starry eyes looked at the man lying on her with an ambiguous smile. “How much longer are you planning to lie there for?” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Zu An was extremely distressed. Am I the type of shameless bastard to take advantage of a girl? I’ve already completely distinguished myself from such lowly people, I relied on my own charm to make beauties come to me on their own!

What the heck is this, pushing her down as soon as I enter? She’s going to think that I’m a pervert! I still have some dignity, you know?

But he never expected the rebound of Keyboard Come to be so great.

It was different from last time. Last time, he used Keyboard Come to make a new set of golden token envoy uniform, so the rebound was expected.

But he only made that old man’s pants fall this time! Why was the rebound still so great?

However, this was where he was wrong. Why would the pants of a powerful ninth rank expert fall down for no reason? If it was an expert at the same level, they would definitely be able to use this opening to take Han Fengqiu’s life. That was why it only looked like his pants were falling on the surface, but in reality, it was related to the very life of a cultivator at the peak of the ninth rank. How could the rebound be small then?

Fortunately, this was only an indirect effect. Otherwise, there might even be danger to Zu An’s life.

Zu An said with a bitter smile, “Would you believe me if I said that my strength gave out because I just fought a great battle, and that I wasn’t trying to take advantage of you?”

He thought that he was done for, but the response he received was unexpected. “I do. You were able to fight against an eight rank and someone at the peak of ninth rank at your young age. The fact that you could last until now is already extremely impressive.”

Zu An: “???”

Even I wouldn’t believe what I said if I was on the other end. Is this girl stupid?

Huh? Wait, why does she look familiar?

There was finally a bit of impatience in this beautiful woman’s voice. “Are you still not going to get up?”

“My bad, my bad.” Zu An laughed awkwardly and quickly sat up.

He wasn’t a kid who didn’t know anything anymore. However, the astonishingly soft feeling even made his heart start pounding.

The beautiful woman sat up as well. She sorted out her clothes and hair.

Zu An finally had a chance to get a good look at her. Her skin was fair and smooth and her face was flawless. Her hair was coiled up above her in an elegant fashion, making her neck appear graceful and slender.

A luminescent pearl was embedded at the top of the carriage. As the soft radiance scattered down on her cheeks, her gentle features seemed to have been painted by a brush. It was hard to say whether the luminescent pearl was brighter or her.

“It’s you!” Zu An finally recognized who this was. He was startled and happy. The woman before him was the one he saved with Ji Xiaoxi back then, the capital’s number one beauty: Yu Yanluo!

“We meet again.” Yu Yanluo smiled. Her smile was so beautiful it was as if a beautiful flower bloomed inside this carriage.

There wasn’t any bit of anger from being offended, nor was there any trace of a girl’s bashfulness. She was calm and natural in bearing, as if she was the main character of this world.

“It has been a long time. Who would’ve thought that the madam to be just as stunning, if not more so today.” Zu An sighed. “I was wondering why King Qi’s heir suddenly turned into a simp. Now that I’ve met with the madam again, I finally understand.”

Yu Yanluo didn’t show much reaction to his praise. After all, she had heard flattery even more over the top over the years. “Your growth is quite surprising. The last time I met you, it was quite challenging for you to even deal with those Blackwing Stockade’s scoundrels, yet now, a few months later, you can already face experts at the peak of the ninth rank.”

Zu An chuckled. “I remember you told me last time that I’m still a few years too early if I want to become your man. Now that you’ve seen my growth, has that time shortened by a bit?”

Yu Yanluo’s composure finally snapped. A faint blush appeared on her gorgeous face. She gave him a rebuking look. “What am I going to do with you…”

Zu An had to admit that someone this beautiful was pretty even when she was angry. However, for better or for worse, his tolerance for beauties had been raised after meeting all those girls. He quickly recovered his composure and said with an upset tone, “It’s your fault for forgetting your past promise!”

“I forgot my promise?” Yu Yanluo reached out her palm. Her fingers were fine and slender, as if they were sculpted from jade. “Return it to me.”

“Return what?” Zu An was stunned.

“My jade pendant.” Yu Yanluo harrumphed. “I don’t want to see you spreading rumors with it everywhere, that I gave it to you because I fell in love and it’s some lover’s gift or something.”

No matter how thick Zu An’s skin was, his boasting earlier was now exposed, leaving him extremely ashamed.

But he reacted quickly as well and went on the offensive. “You really do forget the debts you owe! I saved you last time, so you gave me this pendant and said you were going to repay me. When I went to the Yu clan in Brightmoon City, you were nowhere to be seen! Now, I finally meet you again, yet you want this pendant back?”

Yu Yanluo explained, “Many things were happening in Brightmoon City back then, so I had no choice but to leave. That was why I didn’t have a chance to thank you. However, I already compensated you later on.”

“You compensated me?” Zu An was confused.

There was a faint smile in Yu Yanluo’s eyes. “Why else do you think his majesty left you alive?”

…

Meanwhile, in King Qi Manor, King Qi looked at his lightning scorched son with an overcast expression. “Who the hell did this?!”
