Chapter 1567: New Mission

However, Zu An didn’t know what was happening in the palace. He was really happy; after all, he had met his old friends, and Zheng Dan’s cultivation issue was also solved. Chu Chuyan had even taken the initiative to solve it herself. Because his mood was good, he felt even happier chatting with the Xie duo.

They all began to recall various things that had happened in Brightmoon City, and also talked about the various things they ran into during their cultivation. The atmosphere became more and more enthusiastic.

Only Xie Daoyun seemed to have something on her mind. Even though she had a happy smile, no one noticed the lonely expression that appeared on her face from time to time.

When Zu An and the others left, the usually frivolous Xie Xiu suddenly became serious when he saw Xie Daoyun lost in thought. He said, “Big sis, stop staring already. Brother Zu is a good person, but he’s definitely not the best partner for a woman. You should just stop thinking about it, as it’ll just make you feel worse.”

His big sister was so outstanding, and her family background was so good too. With such a strong relationship with the academy, normally, she would have the qualifications to be the main wife of a great clan. However, she continued to stick around Zu An, even though all of the women around him were ridiculously outstanding. Was his sister really going to become a concubine?

Xie Daoyun immediately jumped like a startled rabbit. Her face turned entirely red with embarrassment as she shot back, “Who said I like him? Damn kid, look at all of the things you’re doing! And yet you still have the nerve to lecture someone else?”

She grabbed his ears and twisted them, making Xie Xiu cry out in pain. He really wondered where his big sister had practiced the move; it was so fast and accurate that he couldn't even avoid it at all.

…

Meanwhile, after Zu An left, he visited Shen Xuzi and several other people he knew. Then, he left the academy.

On the way back, Chu Chuyan said with a sigh of admiration, “Sigh, I’ve discovered that I really don’t understand you at all. I didn’t expect you to actually have so much knowledge. Even those sirs from the academy have to consult you.”

Zu An replied with a smile, “Do you feel as if you’ve picked up treasure?”

“Exactly, I’ve picked up a treasure. It seems my luck is pretty good,” Chu Chuyan said, feeling really happy knowing that he had received the respect of the Royal Academy’s people. Her usually ice-cold face now had a smile.

Zu An was stunned. He couldn't help but say with a sigh of admiration, “Your smile really is beautiful.”

A blush appeared on Chu Chuyan’s face as she replied, “Then you should make me smile more. You’d better not make me cry.”

Zu An was stunned. He couldn't help but feel as if she were referring to something.

While he was trying to figure out what it was, Chu Chuyan quickly took the initiative to grab him with her small, ice-cold hand. She asked him some more about what he had experienced on the Fiend races’ side.

The two of them unknowingly arrived at the Sang manor. They paid the wounded Sang Hong a visit, then told him that Zheng Dan was permitted to study under Great Disciple Yan Xiangu by the libationer.

The news surprised everyone in the Sang manor. Although Sang Hong was the Imperial Envoy and he had previously worked in the Imperial Secretariat, both his prestige and cultivation were far beneath Yan Xiangu’s.

Yan Xiangu was the libationer’s first disciple. His cultivation was rumored to be number one among the libationer’s disciples, and his achievements in rune formations were even more outstanding. Many of the rune formations in the empire’s armies, official manors, and even the court itself came from him. If one could become his disciple, then it was easy to imagine just how brilliant one’s future prospects would be.

Zheng Dan couldn't help but give Chu Chuyan a hug. She was practically choking with emotion as she said, “Big sis, thank you.”

When she heard that Xie Daoyun could study under Yan Xiangu, she had felt incredibly jealous. She had never thought that her aptitude was at all inferior to anyone else’s, but because she came from a merchant company, her background was far inferior to that of a great clan such as the Xie clan. Between that and the fact that she had married into the Sang clan, but then something had happened to the Sang clan and her husband had died before she even got married properly, she had been left incredibly discouraged. How could she have anticipated that she would get the chance to improve her cultivation again?

When she saw the two of them so close, Sang Qien couldn't help but feel a bit of envy. She thought that with Chu Chuyan’s outstanding decisions, just that single act alone had already won over her sister-in-law’s favor. On the other hand, she had worked so hard for so long to form an alliance with her sister-in-law, and yet the effects might not have been as good.

Still, Sang Qien quickly laughed to herself. It wasn’t as if Chu Chuyan didn’t know about her relationship with Zu An, so there was no way this was to ruin their relationship. She was really just complaining pettily.

Chu Chuyan couldn't handle Zheng Dan’s enthusiasm. She struggled free from Zheng Dan’s arms a bit before saying, “Actually, I’m not the only one who’s happy. Ah Zu has always been concerned about your future too. If I hadn’t said anything today, he would probably have found a way to visit the libationer. Right, Ah Zu?”

Zu An chuckled in embarrassment. He hadn’t expected his thoughts to have been completely exposed. Still, while Chu Chuyan was just cold-natured, she definitely wasn’t stupid. She knew many things very clearly.

Now, it was Zheng Dan who felt a bit embarrassed. She was still the Sang clan’s daughter-in-law, after all. Even though Zu An had already been well integrated into the Sang clan, it still felt a bit strange doing this right in front of Sang Hong.

“We should find another day to bring you to the academy to formally carry out the procedure. Anyway, Xie Daoyun is your senior sister and we all know each other. She’ll take care of you,” Zu An said to Zheng Dan.

Zheng Dan voiced her agreement, then gave Sang Hong an inquiring look.

Sang Hong felt at ease inside. This daughter-in-law of his really was clever and loyal, still giving him face even in such a situation. As such, he chuckled and said, “This is an incredibly joyous matter, so why would I stop you? When the time comes, this old one will go with you to pay Sir Yan a visit. I’ve mingled in the capital for so many years. Even though I have many enemies, I’ve still left behind something of a just image. I’ve also exchanged some letters with Sir Yan in the past, so there is a bit of friendship there. Spending some time reminiscing with him about the past will be a good thing.”

Zheng Dan sighed in relief. If it were just the libationer’s words, she didn’t know whether Yan Xiangu would really treat a disciple who was suddenly forced into his hands with that much care. But with that level of relationship, he would definitely take better care of her.

Chu Chuyan initially wanted to leave with Zu An and spend time alone with him, but the Sang clan didn’t let them go at all. They kept the two behind to hold an evening banquet as gratitude. The two of them couldn't refuse, so they stayed behind. By the time they returned, it was already dark.

“Ah Zu, is there something wrong with Miss Sang’s body?” Chu Chuyan asked, recalling how Sang Qien had to get up several times, and seemed to have symptoms of nausea. She couldn't help but say, “If not for the fact that she hasn’t gotten married yet, I would have thought that she was pregnant.”

Zu An began sweating. How was he supposed to explain that? He couldn't just say ‘yes, we have a child’, right? If he did that, the sweet and warm atmosphere they had built over the past few days would instantly turn into hell on earth.

“Maybe it was because something happened to Sang Hong recently, causing her to get sick from fright,” Zu An said ambiguously, then changed the topic.

Fortunately, Chu Chuyan didn’t think too much about it. The two finished washing up, and quickly arrived at their own time of bliss.

Still, Chu Chuyan was a bit embarrassed. Even though the two of them had already experienced getting married, early on, they had only been husband and wife in name. Later, when their affection grew deeper, they had been apart longer than they were together. Whenever the two of them were passionate with each other, if they weren’t treating injuries, they had been in the process of it. They had never spent their time as proper lovers like this before. Two days prior, they had unknowingly fallen asleep while admiring the moon, but today, there was no escaping it.

Chu Chuyan was like a young maiden, huddled under the covers against the corner of the wall. Her heart was pounding. When he saw her shy appearance, Zu An couldn't help but chuckle. He quickly and efficiently dove under the covers.

“Wait, behave yourself!” Chu Chuyan cried, although her voice was no longer as cold as before. There was now a hint of worldliness in it.

However, Zu An didn’t reply. His mouth wasn’t free enough to do anything else.

When the sun shone from high up, even icebergs would begin to melt. What followed was like immortal music from above the clouds. The two completely returned to the level of familiarity they had once had with each other.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You’re still so warm~” Zu An couldn't help but say with a sigh.

Chu Chuyan was already beside herself with embarrassment. She playfully hit the man on her body, which brought about another round of violent storms.

…

In the following few days, several changes took place in the capital. King Qi was issued a diplomatic note from the court to return to his fiefdom, but the day he was supposed to leave, he suddenly grew ill.

With his cultivation, no one believed he would catch a cold or something like that. However, soon afterward, news emerged that something had happened with his cultivation method, creating a risk of deviation. He had even fainted mysteriously several times.

Thus, it seemed he couldn’t leave for the time being, although that could only be delayed temporarily. Of course, King Qi could no longer appear in the court session, and his faction was no longer the way it had been before. As such, people all thought his collapse was at hand.

That same day, Zu An was summoned into the Imperial Palace. Zhao Han went right to the point, saying, “This emperor needs you to leave the capital and take care of something.”
