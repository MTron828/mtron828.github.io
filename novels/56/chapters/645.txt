Chapter 630: Loli Transformation

Translator: Pika

Cheng Xiong’s subordinates were already wrapping up their search. One after another, they informed him that they didn’t locate anyone.

Cheng Xiong began to think to himself. The only place that hadn’t been searched yet was this bed.

He cupped his hands and said, “We still need to search the bottom of the bed. Sir Eleven doesn’t mind, right?”

Zu An frowned. “What is General Cheng implying? Would I not know if there was someone underneath my bed?”

As a golden token envoy, if he didn’t even have this bit of skill, then he would be an absolute joke. The other party requested this despite knowing the abilities of golden envoys, so it indeed seemed a bit excessive.

Cheng Xiong said with a chuckle, “I have no other intentions. However, Sir Eleven has been injured, so your perception might not be so sharp. Please let us help you check inside. This way, Sir Eleven can rest easier.”

He didn’t wait for Zu An’s reply after saying this and gestured for his subordinates to search.

Several imperial guards laid down on the ground. They raised the fabric covering the bottom of the bed and thrusted their swords inside.

Unfortunately, they didn’t find anything even after continuing this for a while.

Zu An sighed. He thought to himself that it would be even more strange if you all did find something under the bed! Right at this time, Yun Jianyue sent a ki transmission. “You should express some anger, or else it will seem strange.”

Zu An was shocked. He quickly realized that as well. If a glorious golden token envoy allowed these men to overturn his house and didn’t react, then that would only mean that he had a guilty conscience!

As such, he waved his hand and directly displayed the Heaven Devouring Art. The guards who were standing up felt a wave of pressure, and then they couldn’t hold onto their blades anymore. All of them flew towards the bed. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Then, with a flip of his wrist, those long blades were crumpled up into lumps of metal. He coldly said, “Has General Cheng never taught your subordinates any rules, using weapons in my home?”

Those guards all broke out into cold sweat. They immediately knelt down in apology.

Even Cheng Xiong’s eyes narrowed. He gave the lumps of metal on the ground a look and quickly cupped his hands. “My subordinates have been a bit too anxious in capturing the assassins and offended Sir Eleven. Please forgive them.”

He was extremely alarmed right now. It wasn’t that he feared the other party’s cultivation, because the ki fluctuations that appeared just now weren't more powerful than his. However, he couldn’t see through that technique. He couldn’t replicate its power at all.

It was to the extent where he couldn’t even tell what element the other party used.

Zu An said indifferently, “Since you all are in a rush to capture assassins, then go out and catch assassins. What are you all wasting time here for?”

Cheng Xiong’s expression changed. However, he quickly recovered his cool and gestured for his subordinates to leave. “We’ve disturbed you today. I hope Sir Eleven does not take offense.”

Zu An had a cold look on his face and didn’t reply.

Cheng Xiong lost interest here and was about to leave. When he arrived by the entrance, he gave Zu An a look. He said in a meaningful tone, “Sir Eleven’s methods are bold and impressive. It didn’t look like you were injured at all.”

Zu An said indifferently, “Even if we are injured, defeating some trifling people isn’t anything troublesome for a golden token envoy.”

Cheng Xiong’s face sunk. The other party dragged him into the scolding as well. However, he really didn’t have much confidence in the situation, as the golden token envoys were all mysterious and powerful people. He wasn’t sure if he could win against the other party.

He gave the covers one last reluctant look. If the other party was really much weaker, he might just pull aside the covers. However, this golden token envoy’s performance was too strong, so he could only give up on the thought.

He consoled himself that there was no way the covers could be hiding a mature person from how the covers looked, only a small child at most. Why would there be a small child among the assailants?

Furthermore, he already spread his senses across the entire room. Apart from Zu An, he didn’t detect another person. That was why he didn’t persist with the issue.

“Could it be that I really made a mistake?” He offended a golden token envoy this time, yet he didn’t even get anything out of it. Cheng Xiong left with his subordinates with a gloomy expression.

Zu An pressed the room’s key, and the courtyard’s gate closed on its own.

This was the advantage of this world. Even though it didn’t advance as far on the science and technology tree, there were many conveniences that were instead replaced through cultivation.

His covers were moved aside when he closed the door. A petite figure made its way out from inside.

When he saw the loli-like Yu Jianyue, Zu An couldn’t help but want to pinch her cheeks. She was just too cute.

“Do you seek death?!” Yun Jianyue smacked his hands away. Then, after twisting a few times, she gradually returned to her normal appearance, changing from a little loli to a mature big sister.

Zu An sighed and said, “Has anyone ever told you that your little form is too cute?”

A trace of redness flashed past Yun Jianyue’s face. “You are not allowed to tell anyone about what just happened, not even Honglei! Otherwise, I will kill you!”

Zu An had a strange look on his face. “That means no one else saw that form before?”

“That’s not the case.” Yun Jianyue revealed a reminiscent expression. “Sometimes, when I’m really bored in the sect, I’ll change into this form and look around the nearby towns and cities.”

Zu An: “???”

Sis, you’re a freaking sect master, moreover of the glorious Devil Sect! Isn’t this a bit weird?

Yun Jianyue immediately snapped out of her daze. She ended up unknowingly telling him an incredible secret. Her expression immediately became extremely dangerous. “Did you use that chance to touch me earlier?”

Zu An immediately waved his hands. “Of course not! I was just worried that you might have acted out after hearing Cheng Xiong’s words. Things would be really bad if you did that!”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed and said, “Could it be that in your eyes, I am just a bimbo with big breasts”

Zu An’s expression became strange. He couldn’t help but look at her impressive chest. Maybe not a fool, but your boobs really are the real deal.

“What are you looking at?!” Yun Jianyue suddenly laughed, but her smile was extremely sinister.

“Nothing.” Zu An laughed and quickly brought out the Five Aggregates Root. “Here, you can recover faster with this, right?”

He already hugged her and touched her. It would be a bit insincere of him if he didn’t give this to her now.

Yun Jianyue frowned, but she didn’t refuse him in the end. She received the jade case, but she didn’t immediately open it. “That Cheng Xiong seems to be quite hostile towards you. You need to be careful. I do not believe he would let the matter rest here.”

“Sigh, I have no idea where I offended him though.” Zu An was getting quite the headache from this as well. Being schemed against by a shrewd guy like this was quite upsetting.

“Rather than sitting and waiting for trouble to come, it’s better to strike first. Just find a chance to get rid of him.” Yun Jianyue said coldly.

Zu An was stupefied. In this instant, he finally understood that this beautiful woman wasn’t of the kind sort, but rather the terror inspiring Devil Sect Master!

Yun Jianyue no longer brought up Cheng Xiong’s matter after giving him this warning. “Help me watch the surroundings. I’m going to treat my injuries.”

Then, she sat down on the bed in a meditative stance. She opened the case and placed it between her legs, revealing the Five Aggregates Root within.

Zu An could sense an exuberant wave of spiritual ki that refreshed his mind rush over. He got on his tiptoes and looked over. He saw a root-like medicinal ingredient resting in the jade case, the swirling energy visible above it. He could tell that it was something extraordinary from a single look.

Yun Jianyue didn’t devour it and instead circulated her energies in a meditative stance. A while later, a strand of thick energy slowly rose from the Five Aggregates Root, and then entered her body through her nose. A faint rosiness returned to her pale face.

Zu An’s eyes widened. She looked just like a goddess with smoke all around her. Even treating her injuries was such a beautiful scene! When would he become like this?

After an hour or so, Yun Jianyue opened her eyes. She closed the case.

Zu An was already bored to death. He was stunned when he saw this. “Your injuries were already healed that quickly?”

Yun Jianyue shook her head. “Of course not. The injuries of the soul need to be slowly nursed, it cannot be rushed. Treatment with the Five Aggregates Root for an hour each day is already the limit. It will instead be a waste if it is continued longer.”

Zu An’s mood instantly improved. “Haha, then you should just cultivate slowly! Either way, you can live here for as long as you want. Right, can you move over? I need to sleep.”
