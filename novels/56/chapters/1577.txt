Chapter 1526: Departure

Zu An gave him a confused look. Based on the elder’s earlier attitude, what he had wanted to say was clearly different. He replied, “You came all the way from the Committee of Elders just to say that?”

Based on what the Second Empress had said, everyone in the Committee of Elders was close to the limit of their lifespans, and each trip would consume quite a bit of their lifespan. As such, they didn’t show themselves unless it was something huge.

Wu Fan immediately broke out into a cold sweat, saying, “Uh… In truth, I wanted to ask you about the immortal medicine. You know we are all already so old, without much time left. We care about that kind of thing most.”

His change in attitude couldn't really be blamed on him. Just what kind of a monster was this kid?! Was that terrifying sword really something a master at the hero form level could release? The power of that sword had made even him, a bystander, shiver in fear. Duan Genggou, who faced the attack head on, had been instantly turned to ash by the sword energy.

Even though his cultivation was much higher than Duan Genggou’s, he didn’t believe he could defend against the sword either. Even if he could, he would have to pay a bitter price. For someone like him who already had half a foot in the grave, any sort of serious injury like that was intolerable. As such, he had immediately gotten rid of his earlier haughtiness, becoming extremely friendly.

The Great Elder was right after all! It seems Sir Fu didn’t lose because of deviation, but was defeated fair and square.

He couldn't understand why someone so young had such terrifying skills. He definitely had to discuss it with the others once he returned to the committee.

“Didn’t I already tell the Great Elder last night?” Zu An replied with a frown. He felt the energy inside him still burning fiercely. He had the urge to release another attack.

When he saw Zu An’s expression, Wu Fan felt all of his fine hairs stand on end. He noticed that Zu An was prepared to attack him. He secretly put up his guard while making his tone sound even more harmless, saying, “It is mainly because the Great Elder could only ask about that in a hurry and did not hear the details too clearly. However, if you are busy, I will not disturb you any longer and will bid you farewell here.”

After saying that, he prepared to leave. When he recalled his previous bold, visionary words, his old face heated up. Forget it, I’ll just get laughed at by the others. It’s better than losing more of my lifespan here.

“Wait!” Zu An called out. Wu Fan was so scared he trembled. However, when he heard what Zu An said next, he sighed in relief. Zu An continued, “It wasn’t easy for you to make this trip, so I’ll tell you again…”

Zu An thought, I am the Fiend races’ Regent now, after all. Furthermore, the young prince still needed to rely on the help of the Committee of Elders, so he couldn't make their relationship too awkward.

Wu Fan suddenly felt a bit overwhelmed by favor, even feeling the urge to cry. He had never expected that he, a Fiend race elder, would go through such an experience today.

Then, Zu An repeated the information about the immortal medicine in the dungeon. He even talked about his encounter with Yayu, hinting that even if the immortal medicine could prolong one’s lifespan, it would only turn one into a freakish monster at most.

He hoped that would be enough to make them give up on the immortal medicine. Otherwise, constantly being eyed by a group of elders with profound cultivations wouldn’t be good.

When he heard the legends surrounding the immortal medicine, Wu Fan was quite shocked. He cupped his hands and bid Zu An farewell. Just as he was about to leave, however, a figure suddenly arrived beside him. It was a woman with long hair that reached all the way down below her waist, gently beating against her back as she walked; it could make the hearts of those who saw it throb.

When he saw the woman’s appearance, Wu Fan thought, Was there actually someone this beautiful in the Fiend King Court? With grandmaster rank cultivation, no less?

Why didn’t I have any impression of this? Don’t tell me some clan’s junior recently broke through?

While Wu Fan was confused, Yun Jianyue was also shocked. Previously, she had been looking everywhere for Yan Xuehen but hadn’t found her, so she had gone to ask Zu An about it. And yet as soon as she arrived at the Imperial Palace, she learned that Zu An had flown toward the city outskirts, so she also went there.

Halfway there, she sensed a terrifying sword and worried that Zu An had encountered something dangerous. As such, she had quickened her pace. When she arrived, she had scanned Zu An’s surroundings with her divine sense, and discovered that there was actually an elder with deep and immeasurable skills present.

She couldn't see through him, which meant his cultivation was higher than hers. As such, she assumed he had come to trouble Zu An. As such, she just took out the Crescent Ring and prepared to fight alongside Zu An at any time.

Wu Fan was a bit confused, but he was also a bit annoyed. It was one thing to worry about Zu An, but did he now have to act deferential to anyone from the younger generation? His expression turned cold. He planned to use the chance to properly lecture the unknown woman.

Suddenly, however, he heard Zu An ask, “Big sis Yun, why are you here?”

Yun Jianyue looked at the nearby Wu Fan vigilantly while moving close to Zu An, asking, “Are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” Zu An replied.

Wu Fan was stupefied. So this woman knew Zu An! She was strong and beautiful; that didn’t make sense at all! 

Sigh, if I had been this amazing when I was younger, the women around me would only have become more numerous!

He showed the two a smile of goodwill and said, “Then I bid you farewell, Regent!”

Afterward, he turned into a rainbow and disappeared into the distance.

Yun Jianyue asked in surprise, “Why did that guy sound so respectful to you?”

Zu An reflexively replied, “Maybe he’s just a naturally good-natured guy.”

“I noticed that a divine weapon’s aura suddenly erupted. Are you really okay?” Yun Jianyue asked, grabbing Zu An’s hand and taking a look. Only then did she notice that he wasn’t wearing anything over his upper body. His strong and healthy muscles glistened under the sunlight. Her expression became a bit unnatural as she continued “Look, even your clothes burst, and yet you’re still saying you’re fine.”

Zu An chuckled and replied, “I’m really fine. I ran into a Dark Elf earlier, but I killed him with a single blow.”

Yun Jianyue was stunned. Then, her gaze landed on the long sword scar across the earth, as well as the ravine between the distant mountains. She asked, “Were you the one who did all this?”

“What, do you suddenly feel as if you don’t know much about me at all?” Zu An replied with a chuckle. His gaze landed on Yun Jianyue. 

Big sis Yun really is big. It’s almost comparable to Big Manman. I wonder how they feel…

Huh? Wait, what is wrong with me today? Why do I keep having these random thoughts?

Yun Jianyue was still in shock and didn’t notice his particularly intrusive expression today. She thought, How is his sword this strong? Then, her gaze moved to the longsword in his hands and she sensed the unique pressure of a divine weapon. She was startled, asking, “So the divine weapon in the Imperial Palace came from you?”

“Yeah. The Tai’e Sword has been successfully upgraded to deity-grade,” Zu An said proudly. His gaze landed on Yun Jianyue’s hair that reached all the way down to her bottom. He thought to himself, if the hair were tied into two ponytails, wouldn’t it be an incredible set of reins…

“Deity-grade…” Yun Jianyue muttered, already so shocked she was starting to grow numb. This guy was just way too mysterious! He always managed to do something completely outside expectations. He had even been able to kill the Fiend Emperor, so making a divine weapon didn’t seem all that amazing in hindsight.

“It’s good as long as you’re fine,” she said. She didn’t even feel like asking him how he had accomplished that. She recalled her purpose for heading over and continued, “Right, do you know where that stone cold woman went?”

“I don’t. I was looking for her in the palace after the ceremony, but I didn’t find her,” Zu An replied. Inwardly, he thought, Did Yan Xuehen just leave out of anger because of yesterday… 

Hm? Why does big sis Yun smell so good? I really want to move closer and get a better whiff….

No, she’s Honglei’s master! You can’t offend her in any way!

But he quickly came around and thought that it wasn’t a big deal at all. Isn’t Yan Xuehen Chuyan’s master? I’ll just get both masters and disciples together…

Wait! What in the world is wrong with me today? Why do these kinds of thoughts keep appearing?

Yun Jianyue fell silent for a moment. Then, she said with a sigh, “The stone cold woman probably already left. You know what kind of personality she has. It isn’t that weird for her to leave without saying anything.”Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

With Yan Xuehen’s cultivation, no one in the Fiend King Court could do much to her without causing a commotion. Furthermore, they had been in the Imperial Palace, where it was even more unlikely for something to happen. That meant there was only a single possibility, which was that she had left on her own.

She paused for a moment, then looked up. She suddenly noticed Zu An staring at her. She was stunned at first, but then she shouted in annoyance, “Damn brat, what are you looking at?”

“Big sister’s beauty, of course,” Zu An blurted out.

Yun Jianyue’s heart skipped a beat. She could feel the intense masculinity coming from Zu An’s body, which made her feel a bit unnatural too. The way they had spent their time together as of late had really blurred a lot of lines. If he had been anyone else, it would be fine, but he was Honglei’s man. She absolutely couldn't make a mistake here and let that stone cold woman laugh at her.

After thinking for a bit, she said, “That stone cold woman still has the Prime Souldew from Lord Sui’s Tomb. Is she planning to use it all for herself? Hmph, as if I’m gonna let that happen!”

Zu An recalled how he had been forced to use the Keyboard Come skill to escape from the Snow Lady in Great Snowy Mountain. That had caused his body to almost collapse completely. Back then, Yan Xuehen seemed to have used almost the entire bottle to save him. If that matter were exposed, wouldn’t their relationship end up completely out in the open?

When he saw Yun Jianyue turn around to leave, Zu An panicked and grabbed her arm. Yun Jianyue was startled when she felt the heat coming from his hand. She wondered why he was burning up so much.

She turned around and asked with an ambiguous expression, “What, are you even going to take advantage of this big sis?”

Zu An stared straight into her eyes and replied, “And what if I am?”
