Chapter 1163: Courting Disaster

“How is that possible? We’ve fought for so many years. Do you think I don’t know what you do and don’t have?” Yun Jianyue responded in a panic. She only thought Yan Xuehen was unwilling to share medicine with her. “You’re not still trying to act tough even at this point, are you?”

Yan Xuehen didn’t know how to explain herself. She said with a cold expression, “If I don’t have it, I don’t have it. There’s no reason.”

Yun Jianyue felt her teeth grow sore. She said through gritted teeth “Look at you… I don’t care if you don’t give me one, but at least take one yourself and get rid of this disgusting worm first!”

They were still grandmasters, and both of them were extremely powerful. Even though they had been ambushed while they were seriously injured, with all of their ultimate trump cards, they could still injure the worm.

But as time dragged on, the Scaled Deathworm began slowly raising its head. It was already starting to recover, and began another round of attacks.

By then, the two were already at their limit, unable to fight back at all. As such, Yun Jianyue took a step back. Rather than being eaten by a disgusting worm, she would rather end up falling at Yan Xuehen’s hand. But Yan Xuehen only had a hesitant expression, and in the end, she didn’t move at all.

Yun Jianyue was stupefied. She exclaimed, “You really don’t have them?”

Yan Xuehen said angrily, “I already told you I didn’t have any several times!”

She was in a terrible mood. She had given her own life-saving medicine to Zu An, while that guy had probably already gone far away with that other woman. They must have been really happy together… How would he have any idea how great her sacrifice was?

She jumped in fright as soon as that thought emerged. She put on a straight face, thinking, I save whomever I want to save; who wants him to know?!

Seeing Yan Xuehen’s expression change several times, Yun Jianyue asked curiously, “I’ve never heard of you getting injured in the past few years. Furthermore, with your cultivation, you wouldn’t need something like that… Did you actually end up giving them to some lover of yours?”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yan Xuehen felt as if she had been seen through completely. She quickly exclaimed, “No, I didn’t! Don’t say random things!”

Yun Jianyue had only thrown out that remark for fun. After all, this old rival of hers was a stone cold woman. Yan Xuehen wasn’t capable of feeling anything like emotions or love! And yet, judging from her flustered reaction, which made her sound just like her lovestruck disciple, Yun Jianyue immediately thought, This woman really does have someone?

“Tell me, tell me! Which miracle man managed to melt our stone cold woman’s heart? I really never would have expected to hear something so interesting while on the brink of death! This death of mine won’t even be so sad anymore,” Yun Jianyue said teasingly. She knew that the two of them were dead for sure, and had already come to terms with it. The only thing she was curious about was who Yan Xuehen’s man was.

“Nonsense! There’s no such miracle man!” Yan Xuehen retorted, but Zu An instantly appeared in her mind. She felt ashamed and embarrassed as she thought, What kind of witchcraft did that guy use on me to make me like this?!

The Scaled Deathworm was a bit apprehensive of the two women, as they had injured it quite badly. It was somewhat confused when it saw the two of them seemingly joking with each other, suspecting that they were deliberately baiting it in to attack them. As such, it was hesitant, not daring to attack.

But when it recalled how its attack should have seriously injured the two of them, it could no longer hold itself back after some time. After all, even if it didn’t attack itself, it could make its subordinates attack.

The worm let out a strange cry. In response, the ground and walls swelled up in several different places, and several smaller Scaled Deathworms emerged from the earth. The massive mother worm cried out, seemingly giving them orders. It then leaned toward Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen, and the smaller worms reentered the earth to attack the two women.

Although the other worms were smaller, that was only in comparison to the mother worm. They were all between ten to twenty meters in length, and their sharp mandibles could crush anything to pieces.

The two women’s expressions changed. They both took out their respective weapons, but they then realized their injuries were way too serious. They couldn't even use their own weapons properly. They sighed. They were both prideful, respected by many, dignified, and powerful; and yet they were going to fall here.

Suddenly, two Scaled Deathworms emerged rapidly from underground, snapping their mandibles closed. The two women barely managed to evade the fatal attack with the last bit of their cultivation. However, several more worms burst out from the walls and the ceiling above them. The two had no more strength left, and could only wait for death in despair.

But the pain they anticipated never came. Instead, they sensed waves of sharp sword ki. Soon after, the heads of the Scaled Deathworms around them left their bodies. The worms’ corpses flailed wildly, and green liquid continuously spurted out of the severed stumps.

The two women were stunned. They both looked at each other, thinking that the other person must have still had some strength left, but they only saw shock in each other’s eyes. They knew then that they had been mistaken.

The two strange worms that had attacked first emerged once more from underground and tried to bite them again. The two women wanted to evade the attack, but although they could normally have eliminated such enemies with just a thought, they could no longer even muster enough strength to move a finger. The worms’ ugly rings of teeth and the foul stench coming from their mouths made the expressions of the two women, who had resigned themselves to their fate, change.

But they weren’t bitten by the two Scaled Deathworms; instead, they entered a very warm embrace. When they raised their heads, they saw a handsome and resolute face.

“It’s you!” both of them cried out. Even though they said the same thing, however, what they felt was entirely different.

Yun Jianyue was really happy to see him, because she had thought he’d died not too long ago. But now, not only had she met him again, she had even been saved by him. What else could she feel besides joy?

Yan Xuehen’s feelings were much more complicated. Her first reaction was also happiness, but she quickly realized that she was being hugged at that moment. For countless years, forget about being hugged by a man, not even one of her fingers had been touched by one.

While she was mainly embarrassed, she also felt extremely guilty. She was worried that Yun Jianyue would notice something and quickly exclaimed, “Let go of me!”

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes and remarked, “We’re in this kind of situation, and yet you still care about that? It’s not as if you’ll get pregnant from a hug.” She clearly thought that Yan Xuehen was just acting cold as usual and didn’t want to be hugged by a man.

When it saw its children being killed, the mother Scaled Deathworm roared in anger. Having confirmed that the two powerful human women had already lost their fighting strength, it quickly charged forth over like a hurricane.

The worm’s speed already exceeded Zu An’s imagination. He was carrying two women who couldn't move by themselves. As such, he couldn't escape the Scaled Deathworm’s pursuit even if he used Grandgale.

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen had even sharper senses, so how could they have not realized that? They both cried, “Don’t worry about us anymore!”

If he still tried to save the two of them, let alone saving neither one, he would even end up throwing his own life away. As such, it would be better for him to just let go of the two women. While the strange worm ate them, he might have enough time to escape.

But Zu An didn’t have any intention of letting go. He quickly called out, “We’re five li away!”

As soon as he said those words, the three of them instantly vanished, and the Scaled Deathworm bit down on empty air. It opened and closed its mandibles a few times, but didn’t sense the presence of flesh between its jaws. It looked around in confusion, but there was no one to be seen.

…

Meanwhile, somewhere in the distance, Zu An and the two women opened their eyes, finding themselves underwater.

Zu An was still fine, because those who had reached a certain level of cultivation could breathe internally. However, Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue weren’t so fortunate. Normally, they wouldn’t have any problems underwater, but they had been seriously injured, and so they were completely caught off guard by the sudden water. They almost immediately began to suffocate, their faces turning red.

At that moment, the two of them were no different from ordinary people who were drowning. They both instinctively reached for their sole lifeline: Zu An.

The normally proud and aloof, ice-cold sect master, as well as the domineering Devil Sect Master, were both weak and delicate, their red lips carrying an unusual sort of fatal charm.

Zu An subconsciously moved closer to them. Scenes from several movies he had seen in the past appeared in his mind. Didn’t people in those scenes always use their mouths to transfer oxygen?
