Chapter 1481: Is A Thousand Miles Far?

Just do it!

At that moment, Zu An had already begun to recall the Dongfeng missiles from his previous world. He actually started to feel some regret that as an online keyboard warrior, he had mostly neglected military matters. That was why his knowledge regarding weapons wasn’t that much greater than an ordinary person’s. He wasn’t like some other big shots, who knew every detail about the most advanced and sophisticated weapons of different countries.

After thinking about it for some time, he decided that if he wanted power and speed to the point that the Fiend Emperor couldn't dodge it, he had to go with the hypersonic Dongfeng-17.

Almost as soon as he began to imagine it, the surrounding air rippled like water. A strange weapon slowly emerged right before the women’s eyes. Its head was sleek and flat, resembling an enlarged arrowhead, but the object was much larger and more complex than an arrow.

What is that thing?

The three women immediately sensed a terrifying aura from the object. Their expressions changed. Their instincts as powerful cultivators told them that it was enough to threaten their lives.

The Fiend Emperor’s expression also changed. Where was this guy getting so many strange weapons? That gatling bodhisattva or whatever it was had already scared him a bit. Thus, he knew he couldn't let Zu An do what he wanted. He charged forward again, planning to stop Zu An before he could use the item.

However, Zu An had already anticipated the move, and the chariot evaded in midair.

The Sun Goddess’ Golden War Chariot was an item that carried the sun from east to west each morning. It was capable of reaching shocking speeds. Even though this one was an imitation, it was already strong enough to evade, reaching a safe distance.

The Fiend Emperor missed, which made him feel absolutely terrible. His opponent was clearly much weaker than him; as long as he closed the distance, he could finish Zu An within three moves. However, Zu An constantly brought out something strange that allowed him to escape. He was only at the master rank, so why did he have so many pseudo-deity-grade objects?

Suddenly, the Fiend Emperor was horrified. He recalled what Yu the Great had mentioned. Could it be that this was the benefit of receiving the world’s recognition?

As there was no way for him to fight in close quarters, he tried a long range attack. The first thing he thought of was the Puppet Curse from before. He had been able to successfully restrict his opponent as soon as they entered the secret dungeon.

Still, he didn’t know how Zu An had undone the move. The previous time, his soul had suffered a rebound because his technique was suddenly broken, which had almost made him suffer considerably in the fight against the Four Perils. At the very least, though, he hadn’t been injured that severely.

He didn’t know whether Zu An’s method of undoing the seal was single-use, or whether it could be repeated. After some hesitation, he didn’t take the risk. This brat has all kinds of skills. If my soul gets hit by a rebound now, I might just die here.

For the first time, he regretted giving the crown prince the Sun Slaying Bow. Otherwise, he would have brought it out and shot down his opponent already.

While he was feeling conflicted, a Dongfeng-17 had already taken form. However, Zu An wasn’t satisfied with just one. If he wanted Dongfeng to purge the earth, how could just a single missile achieve his goal?

Thus, he continued using the Rune Weapon Chart. Another dozen or so missiles began to appear in the air behind him.

In an instant, Zu An suddenly felt his body grow weak. He felt as if he were a robust man who was thrown into a neglected harem of three thousand. At first, it felt great, but eventually, he was completely emptied out, feeling as if he would turn into a mummy.

He was starting to feel a bit alarmed. He had known that making the weapons wouldn’t come without a price, but at this point, he was worried that his blood essence would be sucked dry. That would be too great of a loss.

As such, he frantically used the Primordial Origin Sutra and all his other methods to absorb the ki around him. If he could absorb it, he did, including the remaining power of the dragon vein.

He had to admit that because heaven and earth had just been isolated from each other, the ki in the Unknown Region was countless times purer than that of the outside world. That was why he was able to endure such consumption. If he were outside, he wouldn’t dare to do such a thing; otherwise, he would have already been completely emptied out.

Even so, he discovered that it still wasn’t enough. He quickly asked the three women, “Give me your strength, hurry!”

The three women were close enough to him that they had sensed his entire body becoming like a black hole, swallowing all the ki around him. They were extremely shocked and worried. When they heard that, however, they didn’t hesitate and pressed their soft bodies against him, intending to pass on all their ki without holding back.

Their expressions changed as soon as their bodies made contact. They felt their ki flow out as if a dam had burst, even before they could do anything! Thus, they also experienced what it felt to be completely emptied out.

If it had been anyone else, they would have suspected that person of taking the chance to suck all of their cultivation dry. However, they had already fought together so many times. Their relationship was special, so they naturally didn’t have such worries. Instead, they were worried that Zu An wouldn’t have enough, so they tried to offer up everything they had, letting Zu An absorb everything frantically.

Almost instantly, they felt their bodies grow weak. Their faces were red, and they found it difficult to stand still. They could only barely support themselves by leaning against him. However, the powerful absorption force emanating from Zu An’s body caused their ki to drain away even more quickly, leaving them gasping for breath and dripping with sweat.

If the Fiend Emperor had seen such a thing at any other time, his masculine instincts would make him feel extremely unhappy. However, he couldn’t waste time with such thoughts, because all of his fine hairs stood on end as he felt a lethal threat coming from the strange weapons.

He didn’t dare to show any negligence. Golden flames surrounded his entire body, and a giant Golden Crow projection appeared behind him. His eyes flickered with red light. He spread out his vast wings, then released a shrill scream at his opponent.

Zu An’s expression was cold as he stood on the war chariot, looking down on his opponent like a judge. With a single thought, flames ignited at the ends of the Dongfeng missiles. Smoke surged from their tails, and they launched into the air one by one.

The three women’s bodies were already completely limp, and they leaned against Zu An’s legs. They were utterly shocked as they watched the scene unfold with wide eyes.

Dongfeng lights up the skies with blossoming flowers and a thousand trees, then descends like a rain of stars!

Zu An backed up, quickly driving the Golden War Chariot away.

As the flaming ‘arrows’ flew toward him with tremendous speed, the Fiend Emperor’s eyes narrowed. With a wave of his hand, an enormous wave of golden sword radiance slashed outward.

Boom!

Engulfed in a gigantic mushroom cloud, everything within several dozen li was razed to the ground.

Even though Zu An’s group had already retreated as quickly as they could, the terrifying blast wave extended outward at a visible rate in all directions. They were shaken up even while on the Golden War Chariot. The six dragons wailed in pain.

Zu An shivered, sending the war chariot even farther away.

Shit… I wasn’t affected by nuclear radiation, was I? Doesn’t radiation affect childbirth?

But we’re all cultivators and are still vigorous and healthy. Our cells are extremely strong, so it’s different from the ordinary people of my previous world.

He felt somewhat relieved when he thought of that.

“Did the Fiend Emperor die?” the three women wondered, their mouths hanging open as they looked at the terrifying mushroom cloud. They struggled to remain seated in the war chariot.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

What kind of weapon was that? How were the ‘arrows’ so powerful? They were already comparable to legendary forbidden curses!

Zu An shook his head and said, “The moment the explosion happened, he instantly traveled through the air and moved far away.”

The women sighed in regret. Yan Xuehen said worriedly, “The earth immortal rank is truly amazing. They can even escape the boundaries of space, moving a thousand miles away if they want to. That is why almost no one can kill an earth immortal.”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Little An has done pretty well already. After all, who would even be brave enough to think about killing an earth immortal? Even if we haven’t killed the Fiend Emperor, your power is already great enough to shock the world.”

Zu An knew she was trying to make him feel better. His expression became a bit strange as he replied, “Who says I can’t kill him?”

Was a thousand miles far? Earth immortals could instantly move a thousand miles away, but Dongfeng’s express delivery had a targeting range of several thousand miles!

As soon as he finished speaking, several remaining Dongfeng-17s suddenly rushed out of the mushroom cloud and rose into the air, disappearing into the horizon almost instantly.
