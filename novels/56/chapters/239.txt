Chapter 239: Do You Think You’re All That Just Because You Have Money?

Translator: Pika

Zu An was thoroughly intrigued. Just how beautiful is this Qiu Honglei that she can drive so many men crazy?

There was no need to talk about that old pervert Ji Dengtu.

But even Chu Hongcai, this habitually aloof and quiet man, seemed completely smitten.

The three of them made haste towards the Immortal Abode. Even though Zu An had never ridden a horse before, he could just learn by watching the others. He was a cultivator after all, so maintaining his balance wasn’t too difficult.

Along the way, Chu Hongcai and Chu Yucheng kepty trying to find chances to ask him about Chu Chuyan’s condition.

Zu An was fully aware of their attempts, and he bluffed his way through them. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Soon, they arrived at a street filled with a mysterious fragrance.

Chu Yucheng winked at Zu An, but his small eyes, set within his excessively chubby face, made it difficult to notice. “New Apsara Lane has far more than just the Immortal Abode! This street has over a hundred different brothels. It is a man’s paradise, not only in name but also in reality!”

“Over a hundred?” Zu An was completely stupefied. Brightmoon City had such a big market for this?

Even though Brightmoon City was a large city, it still paled in comparison to the international metropolises of his past world. Most of the people were also poor commoners without much disposable income. Were there really enough customers to support this level of business?

Chu Hongcai spoke, his face filled with pride.“This is why I say you are lacking in culture. Brightmoon City is a well-known and bustling city, and it serves as the commercial hub for the nearby commanderies. This place even produces salt and steel, and is a populous city well-known to all the rich and famous.

“Not only does Brightmoon City have a huge population, it is also crisscrossed by an endless stream of trade routes from many different places. This has caused all sorts of professions to spring up and grow, creating the bountiful beacon of prosperity that is Brightmoon City.”

His explanation gave Zu An a rough understanding. This place was like Ancient China’s Yangzhou.

With a hundred thousand coins strung up by the thousands, we ride a crane to Yangzhou.

It was a place that many ancient people had yearned for.

Brightmoon City was experiencing a similar boom.

His eyes scanned the street, and sure enough, he saw brightly colored buildings of all different shapes and colors. There were many girls in skimpy clothing that exposed half their bodies. Some of them covered their mouths while giggling, and others were bold and unconstrained... their methods for attracting customers were as varied and miraculous as the eight immortals.

Chu Yucheng took a deep breath and said with an intoxicated voice, “Even the air is filled with the sweet aroma of seduction! This fragrance must be the sweet scent of all the ladies here. This place really is the paradise of men after all.”

Zu An couldn’t help but remark, “Are you sure that it isn’t just the smell of cosmetics?”

This fatty normally seemed rather polite and adorable. Who would have thought that he would be such an experienced veteran in this field?

Chu Yucheng felt like he’d been strangled.

He had felt hot blood surging within him, and the words of fiery passion roaring within him were ready to set the whole place ablaze. However, Zu An’s comment had caused him to choke, and all his words died in his throat.

Zu An used this chance to take in his surroundings more deeply. Even though this New Apsara Lane was full of brothels, the most eye-catching place here was definitely the Immortal Abode.

A tall building with several floors, it rose steeply from the ground. In terms of design and scale, it far exceeded the other brothels around it.

The reason Zu An noticed this building wasn’t because of its rich ornamentation, of which every detail would have been praised in his previous world as a shining example of ancient cultural heritage. Nor was it because of the flamboyant calligraphy with which the establishment’s glorious name, ‘Immortal Abode’, was depicted on a plaque above the main entrance.

It was because of the ocean of human flesh that had already gathered around the entrance. Amidst the sea of people, many were screaming the name of Qiu Honglei.

Zu An was completely stupefied. This scene was playing out exactly as if some celebrity had appeared in a downtown area in his previous world. Qiu Honglei hadn’t even shown herself yet, so who knew what these people were hollering about.

How can none of these people be aware that this goddess they are so crazy about will end up as a mere plaything for the strong?

“Good thing we came early! There aren't too many people here yet.” Chu Hongcai sounded pleasantly surprised.

Zu An blinked at the mass of people in front of him. Bro, what’s wrong with your eyes?

Sensing Zu An’s confusion, Chu Yucheng explained with a chuckle, “These people are only here because they enjoy a good commotion. They don’t actually have the qualifications to enter the Immortal Abode. Second brother Hongcai isn’t wrong—we can still be considered among the early arrivals. It seems like we can grab some good seats today.”

As he spoke, he squeezed his way through the ground. His body was thick, at least twice as wide as a normal person’s. This fellow had been a tank in the Clans Tournament, so he had no trouble moving through these ordinary people.

Chu Yucheng’s chubby palm pushed forward, and the people in front of him staggered out of the way like drunks.

His actions drew curses from those he offended, but when they realized his strength, not a single one dared to go beyond hurling a few tough words.

Seeing all these people around him, Zu An’s eyes began to twitch. These were all living sacks of Rage points! How could he let them go so easily? He began to yell loudly, “Losers, please move out of the way. You all can’t even go in, so why are all of you crowding around here blindly? You’re just blocking the way.”

Even though none of them had heard of the word ‘loser’ before, it wasn’t hard to infer that it was a derogatory term. The crowd were quick learners, and in short order, all of them became furious.

You have successfully trolled Loser A for 99 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Loser B for 99 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Loser C for 99 Rage points!

Zu An sighed in satisfaction at the influx of Rage points. How pitiful, his Keyboard System didn’t even find these side characters important enough to be named.

Chu Yucheng continuously wiped the sweat off his brow as he kept a keen eye on the swarm of people around them. His chubby body sweated easily, but he knew that the sweat he was currently producing definitely came from the anxiety stirred up in him by the fellow behind him.

Chu Hongcai followed him, gripping his sword tightly. Even though their cultivation was far greater than these people around them, he knew there was no way they could stand against so many of them together, especially since many of these people were cultivators themselves.

The two of them rattled off a constant stream of curses under their breath. There really was something wrong with this guy’s head! Just what did the first miss see in him?

You have successfully trolled Chi Hongcai for 222 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Chu Yucheng for 222 Rage points!

Fortunately, they managed to squeeze their way to the entrance. The guards from the Immortal Abode stepped in to assist, holding back the furious crowd for them.

A young man yelled out from somewhere in the crowd, “Tsk, do you all think you’re all that just because you’ve got a bit of money? Do you think that it gives you the right to do whatever you want?” His voice was dripping with disgust.

When he heard this, Zu An stopped in his tracks. He turned around and flashed the youngster a wide smile. “We’re going in right now, but all of you can only watch stupidly from outside. Sorry, but money talks.”

He even shrugged a perfect textbook shrug.

You have successfully trolled Loser A for 199 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Loser B for 199 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Loser C for 199 Rage points!

...

Seeing even more Rage points pour in than before, Zu An almost orgasmed. He finally understood why villains always loved saying such cheesy, scripted lines.

It really feels so damned good!

He giggled as he put his arms around Chu Hongcai and Chu Yucheng. “You guys definitely have to bring me to more lively places like this in the future!”

He wouldn’t obtain many Rage points even if he bent over backwards trying to farm points off a single person. Meanwhile, just a random holler here had gotten him over ten thousand points.

“Sure, sure...” Chu Yucheng took out a handkerchief to mop up the sweat on his face. I’ll have to be batshit crazy to invite you out again!

The guards from the Immortal Abode were afraid that he would start a riot, so they quickly led the trio inside in a hurried and flustered manner.

When they entered the establishment proper, Zu An’s eyes were immediately drawn to the gleaming, crystalline river not too far away. Only now did he realize that the Immortal Abode was constructed along the bank of the Brightmoon River.

He even noticed some pleasure boats by the riverbank.

Aren’t there already enough brothels here? Why are there still so many pleasure craft?

The people in this city really know how to play...

Zu An sighed. It seemed he still lacked imagination.

“How many silver taels did you have to spend to meet with this Qiu Honglei?” Zu An noticed that his two companions had fished out exquisite invitation cards, and the guards smoothly let them through.

“Entering actually doesn’t require any money. Immortal Abode has sent out invitations to all of the well known figures in Brightmoon City, as well as all other respectable figures. Each invitation allows one to bring a companion. As for your expenses afterwards, that will depend on how hard you play.” Chu Yucheng wiggled his brows, giving him a knowing look.

Why is this damn fatty looking more and more like that actor Qiao Shan? Zu An thought jokingly. Then, he suddenly realized what the other party said, and immediately became upset.

The Immortal Abode had issued an invitation to all respectable figures. If even the juniors of the side branches, Chu Yucheng and Chu Hongcai, were given one, where was his damn invitation?!

Were they looking down on him?!

This Immortal Abode can eat shit!

He immediately turned to leave, his face as dark as a storm cloud.

“Ah Zu, what’s wrong?” Chu Yucheng was shocked by this, and hurried over to check on him.

Zu An said with a snort, “This Immortal Abode has the nerve to not send me an invitation. They clearly don’t give a shit about me! Why do I have to show them warmth when all they show me is their callousness? That whatever pretty courtesan or whatever, can she be as attractive as my wife? Forget it, forget it, I might as well go home to embrace my wife.”

When they heard his words, the people in the hall all turned to look at him. Just which idiot was saying such things? He actually dared to claim that Lady Qiu isn’t as pretty as his wife?

Is his wife a goddess?!

These men had all been worried that they might not have the chance to show themselves off before Qiu Honglei. Now, an opportunity had come knocking on their doors.

“Aren’t you a shameless fool? Your wife...” Several of the men closest to him jumped to their feet, about to pummel the idiot who had dared slander their goddess. However, when they saw Zu An’s face, they immediately looked like they had eaten a mouthful of shit. The rest of their words slinked back down their throats. “Apologies, we’ve disturbed you.”

This fellow’s wife really was prettier than Qiu Honglei. After all, Chu Chuyan was publicly acknowledged as the number one beauty in Brightmoon City! No matter how pretty Qiu Honglei was, her standing was still incomparable.

In a private room on the second floor, a pretty young heir watched this scene through the curtains, and scoffed, “Not a trace of elegance! A complete rascal! I really don’t know what Chu Chuyan sees in him.”

The voice was gentle and pleasant to the ear. Despite the generous dollop of anger, the words had the precise and unhurried cadence befitting a simple yet elegant scholar.

In reply, another man with delicate features said with a bitter smile, “Sis, you cannot let yourself be deceived by his outward appearance. There is definitely more to him than meets the eye. Beneath his wanton and unrestrained exterior is a cool-headed and crafty mind.”

If Zu An were here, he would have definitely recognized this person as none other than the city lord’s young master Xue Xiu, while the pretty heir was actually his older sister, dressed as a man.
