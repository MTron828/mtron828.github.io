Chapter 265: Caught in the Act

Translator: Pika

“Master?” Zu An was taken aback. “What master are you talking about?”

Zheng Dan said with a smile, “Your lips seem to be sealed pretty tightly. Such a great movement technique like yours doesn’t come out of thin air, does it?”

Zu An chuckled. “I’ve always been a genius among geniuses—of course I’m self-taught! Miss Zheng, are you trying to pry some intelligence out of me? It seems your skills in this field are still a little lacking.”

“If you don’t want to talk about it then forget it,” Zheng Dan said in a huff. “I was genuinely worried about your safety, and yet you’re somehow suspecting my motives!”

Zu An looked her up and down, then said, “If my memory serves me right, I believe Miss Zheng is engaged. How can I not be suspicious when you suddenly seek me out?”

Zheng Dan sighed deeply. “As I expected, this was how everyone would see this... and you, apparently, are no exception.”

She stepped away from him, her eyes becoming unfocused as she gazed at the distant horizon. “My marriage into the Sang clan was arranged by my father. Even though my clan is known as one of Brightmoon City’s four major clans, we are nothing more than a merchant clan in the end. We’re nothing compared to an established, top-level clan.

“That’s why all our clan elders were ecstatic when they received the Sang clan’s proposal, and agreed without a moment’s hesitation.”

“Although the Sang clan doesn’t have such a rich history, they are still one of the rising stars in the capital, and Sang Hong is one of his imperial majesty’s favored ministers. Given another year or two, they should rise to become a top-level clan. The only reason they proposed an alliance with our clan through marriage was because they’re using this time to grow. How could the Zheng clan’s elders pass up such an amazing opportunity?

“It’s just... Why did no one ever bother to ask me for my opinion? Why didn’t they ask me if I like that person, or if I were willing to marry him?”

Her eyes misted over slightly as she spoke.

Even Zu An couldn’t tell if these were her true feelings, or deliberately feigned. “To be honest, you have no reason to be so discontented either. The Zheng clan has provided you with all sorts of advantages since birth, so it’s only natural that you have to bear some responsibility. When you come from an important clan, this is just the way things are. Sometimes, you don’t have the freedom to make your own choices.”

Zheng Dan gave him a look of shock. “No one has ever spoken like this to me! Even my closest friends have always comforted me, sympathized with me over the unfairness of fate... Your point of view is truly different from everyone else’s.”

“I’ve always been a fan of saying things as they are. It’s good that you didn’t take it personally,” Zu An replied.

As she stared at him, a conflicted look flashed across her eyes. “You really are different.”

Zu An raised his brows smugly. “Is it because I’m incredibly handsome?”

Zheng Dan blushed. “Hmph! Incredibly shameless, you mean,” she scoffed.

The two then chatted idly. Because of what had just happened, neither of them chose to steer the conversation in any real direction. As such, their conversation meandered in a carefree manner, and it became a relaxing and enjoyable experience for the both of them.

The bell rang, signaling the start of the next class. Just as they were about to go their separate ways, Zheng Dan turned around with a reluctant look. “Ah Zu, you really have to be careful... Don’t let Chen Xuan do anything to you.”

Zu An laughed. “Relax! I still have so much to talk with Miss Zheng about. How could I let someone do me in before then?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Zheng Dan smiled coyly. “Pah! Can’t you just be decent at least once in a while? You’re still womanizing even though you already have a wife.”

Zu An laughed heartily. “Don’t you have a fiancé as well? Our situations seem to be matchmade in heaven!”

Zheng Dan couldn’t stand any more of his directness. With an indignant huff, she turned around and left quickly, her face red.

She hurriedly turned a corner and leaned against the wall. She pressed her hand against her chest, bewildered by the pounding drumbeat of her heart.

Wasn’t I the one who was supposed to be taking advantage of him? How did our roles end up swapping?

...

The rest of the day’s classes passed by rather quickly. When they were finally dismissed, a wild Chu Huanzhao immediately appeared, snorting angrily at him.

“Why did that Zheng girl go looking for you?”

Zu An was a little surprised. “News seems to get to you pretty quickly.”

A hint of cockiness appeared on Chu Huanzhao’s face. “But of course! This lady has many helpers in this academy...”

She was just about to boast about her glorious achievements when she suddenly noticed something amiss. She huffed angrily. “Stop changing the topic! Why did that slut go looking for you?”

Zu An couldn’t help but say, “You’re still just a kid. Stop throwing the word ‘slut’ around all the time. It’s really not a good look.”

“That’s just how I am! Besides, she still goes looking for you even though you have a wife! If she isn’t a slut then what is she?” Chu Huanzhao’s eyes went completely red, as if she was the one suffering a great injustice. “What, are you already head-over-heels for her?”

When he saw how close to tears this little girl was, Zu An’s heart softened. “Of course not! She wanted to ask me about Chen Xuan’s assassination. She was just a bit worried about my safety,” he hurriedly assured her.

“When did the two of you get so close? Why would she care that much about you?” Chu Huanzhao’s eyes flickered dangerously, her hand subconsciously reaching for her Wailing Whip.

Zu An’s expression grew panicked. He explained in a hurry, “I did save her once before, after all. Besides, isn’t it normal for fellow students to care about each other?”

Chu Huanzhao snorted. “That girl looks all gentle and dainty on the surface, but I’m sure it’s all fake! I just don’t like her.”

Zu An felt his head beginning to throb. “Okay, okay, okay. I’ll just associate with her less in the future, all right?”

Drama really starts easily between girls. This kid’s still so young, but she is already a budding talent in this field.

Zu An immediately diverted her attention, worried that she might continue pursuing this matter. He pulled out a fine little bottle and said, “Huanzhao, didn’t I promise you a gift? I never figured out what I wanted to give you before, until I recently picked up this interesting thing. Hurry and take a look!”

Chu Huanzhao was taken aback by the flask filled with green liquid. “Is it perfume? I’ve never messed around with those before. But if it’s a gift from brother-in-law, I guess I can at least give it a try.”

Dark lines appeared across Zu An’s forehead. “Perfume my ass! Have you ever seen green perfume before?”

“I guess there isn’t any green perfume...” Chu Huanzhao chuckled in embarrassment. “What is it, then?”

“It’s a bottle of paralysis poison.” Zu An roughly explained its effects to her, and then he added, “It ignores the defenses of all those at the fifth rank or below. Those caught in its effects will lose all ability to resist.”

“This thing seems pretty good! It’s much more interesting than perfume.” A look of excitement appeared on Chu Huanzhao’s face. She immediately fell in love with it.

Seeing her enthusiasm, Zu An gave an inner sigh of relief.

The poison bottle was useless to him, so it made the perfect gift for this girl. That was why he was content just to give it away.

He had been slightly worried that such a gift would be a weird thing to give a girl. Who knew that it would just happen to suit Huanzhao’s naughty nature?

Chu Huanzhao fiddled with it for a while before carefully putting it away. Then, she looked at Zu An and asked, “Brother-in-law, what rank are you now?”

Zu An hesitated. In terms of cultivation, he was currently at the eighth step of the third rank, but his real strength was far greater.

As he grew in his understanding of the world and gained more knowledge about cultivation from the academy, he’d reached an interesting conclusion.

Just by filling up his formations one after another using the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, his real strength would be much greater than other cultivators at the same level. This was without taking into account the Primordial Origin Sutra tempering his body.

Chu Huanzhao didn’t seem to mind his hesitation. She’d already gotten what she wanted. “You haven’t reached the fifth rank yet, have you?”

“I haven’t.” Zu An replied without thinking.

“Perfect.” Chu Huanzhao’s lips spread in a sly smile.

Zu An immediately sensed something amiss. “What are you getting at? Why are you asking such a thing?”

“Nothing~” Chu Huanzhao snickered inwardly, her previously sulky mood vanishing without a trace. She began humming to herself, waving her small hands about and skipping energetically ahead.

Zu An stared blankly after her.

Why do I feel like I’ve shot myself in the foot?

...

Aside from Jiao Shanhe and the others, there was another troop of Chu clan guards waiting by the entrance to the academy, led by Chu Hongcai.

“Yo! Brother Hongcai, fancy seeing you here.”

This fella always had a cold and calculating look on the outside. However, after seeing his fanboy side the night before in the Immortal Abode, Zu An suddenly found him much more likeable.

“When he received news of the assassination, Master dispatched a troop to escort the two of you home after school.” Now that he knew that his goddess hadn’t gone to bed with Zu An the night before, Chu Hongcai’s demeanor towards him was also more relaxed.

He had previously held the post of Vice Commander of the estate’s guards, and had been in charge of security around the spiritual creek. Following its contamination, his guilty conscience had led him to resign.

However, in the eyes of the members of the Chu clan, he was still extremely reliable. That was why he had been assigned this task.

“Then I’ll have to trouble brother Hongcai and the others.” Zu An knew that the Madam was most worried about Chu Chuyan’s safety. With her current condition, and the incident with the eighth-ranked intruder, the commander Yue Shan had to remain in the estate to protect Chu Chuyan.

They were already treating this affair quite seriously by sending the previous vice commander.

Even though their escorts weren’t a match for Chen Xuan individually, they were all elites of the Chu clan. It would be difficult for Chen Xuan to deal with all of them if they worked together.

Of course, this was only if he didn’t bring his own subordinates. But after the events of the night before, the Chu clan and the City Lord had already cracked down on all the suspicious people in the city. It was one thing for him to hide out in the city alone, but keeping a huge group in the city was plainly courting death.

...

Cheng Shouping was already standing by the entrance when they returned to the Chu Estate. When he saw Zu An, he rushed over excitedly, waving an invitation card in his hands. “Young master, young master! The Immortal Abode’s Qiu...”

Just when he was about to continue, he suddenly caught sight of Chu Huanzhao behind Zu An. The smile on his face instantly froze. His hands disappeared behind him. The feeling of her whip was clearly still fresh in his memory.

Even though he’d received a bonus from Zu An, the pain from the Wailing Whip wasn’t something even some as greedy as him wanted to experience again.

“The Immortal Abode what?” Chu Huanzhao looked at him suspiciously.

“Nothing!” Cheng Shouping said hurriedly.

“Is that so? What is that you’re hiding behind you?” Chu Huanzhao tried to look behind him.

Cheng Shouping hurriedly said, “Second miss, your respected self is mistaken! It really is nothing!”

His hands suddenly became empty, as the item he was clutching onto was snatched away. He immediately panicked. He turned around and was just about to demand it back, but he realized he was staring at Madam Qin Wanru. The words caught in his throat, and he forced them back down.

Qin Wanru didn’t pay him any attention. She opened that invitation card on her own. Her expression immediately turned cold. She stared at Zu An and said, “Heh, so this is an invitation letter from the Immortal Abode’s Qiu Honglei? Amazing... Absolutely incredible!”
