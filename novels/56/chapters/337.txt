Chapter 337: Brother-In-Law Looks so Pale

Translator: Pika

“As expected of the principal of Brightmoon Academy. I thought I was already being quite careful, yet I was still discovered.” A skinny and shriveled figure slowly emerged from behind a tree.

He wore black, and his entire body was bound tightly, all the way to up his head, exposing only his two eyes. It was impossible to observe his physical characteristics so gather any further information about him.

Jiang Luofu looked at him coldly. “Who are you? Why are you targeting our academy’s teachers?”

The black-clad individual sighed. “I thought the principal was someone formidable, but it seems I was being foolish. You’re fully aware that there’s no way I would answer these questions, yet you still asked them anyway.”

Jiang Luofu nodded. “You’re right. A poor choice of words on my part.”

She undid her hairpin. Her long hair uncoiled, cascading down her back like a waterfall.

The black-clothed man was stunned. Even though he had no feelings towards the opposite sex, he had to admit that this woman before him was extremely beautiful. With her long legs and the aura of confidence she possessed, she was clearly a beauty that not even an imperial concubine could hope to match.

Jiang Luofu seized his moment of distraction to make her move. Her toes tapped lightly against the ground, and she shot forward like a streak of lightning. In an instant, her jade hairpin arrowed towards the eyes of the black-clad individual.

Many years had passed since she’d last gone all out against an opponent. However, the pressure this individual gave off was too great, so she didn’t dare hold back.

However, two inches from the man’s face, her jade hairpin stopped.

Two fingers clasped the jade hairpin in place. Her opponent flicked his fingers.

An incomparable wave of power surged toward her.

Jiang Luofu almost lost her grip on the jade hairpin. However, her reactions were fast as well. With a flip of her wrist, the jade hairpin spun quickly.

The force of the spin allowed the hairpin to break free from the black-clad man’s fingers, forcing him to let go.

Jiang Luofu used this opportunity to do a backflip. Those beautiful legs that Wei Suo constantly drooled over now became the most dangerous of weapons.

Her long legs rose like powerful dragons, instantly sending several dozen strikes towards this black-clad man’s various vitals.

The man had to use both his arms and legs to fend off this dazzling series of blows.

When he finally found an opening to retaliate, Jiang Luofu had already pulled back to create some distance between them. She stared at him vigilantly.

“You’re still so young, yet you already possess such powerful cultivation. It truly leaves one in admiration.” For a second, the black-clad man looked like a senior admiring a junior. The next instant, he attacked.

His movements weren’t fast—at least that’s how it seemed on the surface. He looked just like an ordinary old man. However, a streak of afterimages trailed behind him.

Jiang Luofu knew that this was the result of the old man being so fast that even the surrounding light and shadows had become distorted. Her jade hairpin floated in midair in front of her. With a swipe of her hand, the jade hairpin split into nine hairpins of various shapes.

She tapped the backs of each hairpin, and the hairpins shot towards the black-clad man like arrows.

Each hairpin possessed a different attribute, and they trailed multi-colored streaks of light as they flew through the air with a shrill whistling noise. They stabbed towards the black-clad man like nine flying swords.

“Interesting.” The black clad man continuously deflected these incoming hairpins with his fingers.

Deflecting the hairpins didn’t seem too difficult for him, but it did slow down his advance.

Jiang Luofu wasn’t happy about this at all. The closer this old man got, the greater the pressure she felt.

“Let’s end the game here, my long-legged beauty...” Halfway through his sentence, the black clad man suddenly broke out in a fit of coughing.

His complexion paled. With a tap of his toes, he shot into the clouds, stepping on thin air to disappear into the darkness.

Jiang Luofu was just about to take out a little bell, but she put it away again when she saw her opponent flee. She looked in the direction he’d disappeared to. “I wonder if he is ninth rank or master rank...” she said gravely.

Both ninth and tenth rank cultivators could walk on air, but the former couldn’t maintain it for a long time.

That man seemed to have still been holding back, so it was hard for her to judge the exact level of his cultivation.

The black-clad man swiftly left Brightmoon Academy behind and fled for a remote place, coughing intensely. He tore off his mask and covered his mouth with a handkerchief. Only then did his coughing stop.

Looking at the dark-red blood staining the handkerchief, the black clad man muttered, “My life is already nearing its end... where are you hiding...”

...

If Zu An had been there, he would’ve definitely recognized him as the mysterious expert from the Wei Estate.

He would’ve also guessed at the reason behind the black eyes that the academy’s teachers had been sporting recently. This old man was clearly feeling those teachers out.

This would have then led him to the conclusion that this old man was after him, which would set off even more alarm bells in his head.

However, he had no inkling of any of this. His days were spent in blissful ignorance.

In the day, he and Zheng Dan left traces all over the remote areas of the academy. At night, he would pursue the meaning of life with Chu Chuyan in the Unvoiced Residence.

Chu Chuyan had completely lost her initial shyness and reservation, and was now welcoming him calmly and cooperatively...

One day after classes, Chu Huanzhao suddenly looked Zu An over intently. She even walked a few circles around him.

“What are you doing? Is there something on my face?” Zu An rubbed his cheeks in confusion.

Chu Huanzhao couldn’t restrain herself any further. “Brother-in-law, you look so pale and sallow.”

Zu An was left speechless.

Chu Chuyan and Zheng Dan were both exceptional beauties, but not even his body, forged by the Primordial Origin Sutra, could keep up this schedule day after day.

“Is there too much schoolwork? You are both a student and a teacher at the same time. Maybe you should ask the principal to assign you fewer classes.” Chu Huanzhao was clearly worried about him.

Zu An flushed with embarrassment. “Don’t worry, I have everything under control.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Let’s find Ji Xiaoxi and get some medicine for you. I’ll look for her if she is still ignoring you,” Chu Huanzhao said.

“Haha, it’s all right, I’ll head over to Divine Physician Ji’s place myself. In fact, I’ll go right now! Go home first without me.” Zu An had to say this in order to convince Chu Huanzhao to head on home first.

If she followed him to Ji Dengtu’s place and learned the real reason why he was so pallid recently, wouldn’t she kill him right there and then?

However, his main purpose in paying that divine physician a visit wasn’t for that sort of medicine. Instead, he was after some restorative medicine.

His cultivation technique forced him to suffer a multitude of wounds. The last few experiences had taught him just how important it was to carry such medicine with him.

The entrance to the Ji Estate was still as crowded as usual.

However, Zu An was a long-time customer. He strutted straight into the back courtyard.

To be honest, he didn’t really want to meet with that old pervert. He had messed with the divine physician by giving him the book about cuckolding, and there was the recent incident with Ji Xiaoxi as well. It was entirely possible that the old pervert would murder him the instant they met.

However, Ji Xiaoxi had roundly ignored him recently, so he couldn’t buy anything off her. His only remaining option was to look for Ji Dengtu.

Just as he was about to head inside, he suddenly bumped into Jiang Luofu. The other party was startled. “Why are you here?”

“I wanted to buy some medicine.” Zu An didn’t find it all that strange to see her here. She was Ji Dengtu’s relative, after all.

If I had known this was going to happen, I would’ve walked a little faster and ‘accidentally’ ran into her!

Jiang Luofu grunted in acknowledgment and continued to walk away in a cool and elegant manner. Suddenly, she turned around and said, “Oh, by the way, you need to be careful when you’re in the academy.”

“Why?” Zu An was taken aback. Why did it sound like she was warning him?

Had his fun time with Zheng Dan been discovered?

“A mysterious expert has been visiting the academy in secret recently. We still do not know his objectives, but his intent is surely malicious.” A frown crossed Jiang Luofu’s face as she recalled what had happened that night.

Zu An sighed with relief. Thank goodness his activities with Zheng Dan hadn’t yet been discovered.

After giving him this warning, Jiang Luofu left, seemingly preoccupied with her own thoughts.

Right at that moment, Ji Xiaoxi just happened to walk out, carrying a wicker basket filled with medicinal ingredients. Zu An’s eyes brightened. He immediately rushed over to her.

Of course, Ji Xiaoxi turned around immediately and fled like a ghost.

Zu An was just about to chase after her when Ji Dengtu suddenly appeared before him, spitting him with a furious glare. “Damned brat, did you bully my Xiaoxi?!”
