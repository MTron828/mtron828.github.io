Chapter 1726: I’m So Stupid

When the daoists rushed at Zhao Han, the Right Guard General Guo Zhi roared and tried to bring his Imperial Guard subordinates with him to provide help. He naturally knew that the body would be extremely weak once the primordial spirit left. It had to remain in an absolutely safe place.

But how could the daoists let him do as he wished? Elder Xuan Dou and little monk Jie Se’s group did everything they could to stop their retaliation, giving them no way of providing Zhao Han with aid.

At the same time, both sides watched the situation around Zhao Han’s body carefully. Just then, they noticed that two more people had suddenly appeared there. One was a handsome middle-aged man with an eye-catching beard and a voluminous robe. He had a charming smirk that gave off something of a slick and sleazy air. The other one had a completely gloomy expression, and lightning flickered all around him. Behind him was a sword case shaped a bit like a tortoiseshell. Eight swords flew all around him.

Guan Chouhai was shocked. He had been trying to think of ways to deal with Zhao Han, and had never thought that such a situation would appear. This person looked exactly like him, with the same appearance and even the same temperament. Even the decorations on his clothes and his weapons were the same. Forget about other people, not even he himself or his women would be able to tell the difference!

Also, where did Zhao Han go? Could all of this just be an illusion?

Suddenly, the ‘Guan Chouhai’ on the other side brandished his hands, sending countless vajra armbands at him. They clashed straight against his own Twin Vajra Armbands.

Clang, clang, clang!

A concentrated burst of loud and clear noises rang out as the armbands filled the air.

Guan Chouhai felt sullen as he realized that the other side wasn’t an illusion, but rather a tangible presence. But he just couldn't figure out how that could be! The Twin Vajra Armbands were Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s treasure, which was passed down from generation to generation. Why did the clone have an exact copy of it? Could it be that the Twin Vajra Armbands weren’t actually a pair, but rather four copies? If he could seize those two as well, wouldn’t his own strength skyrocket?

However, before he could think any more about that, the ‘Guan Chouhai’ on the other side spun his entire body rapidly. Then, he rushed straight through the midst of the armbands, arriving in front of the real Guan Chouhai near-instantly.

“Spiral of the Venom Dragon?” Guan Chouhai exclaimed, immediately recognizing his unique secret art. However, the clone’s attack had already arrived, hands spinning like a drill bit. He didn’t have time to think and could only face it head-on.

Since he had created the move, he naturally understood its weaknesses. He quickly cut between the clone’s hands and pried them apart. At the same time, he pulled back and stomped against the ground, channeling the power of the earth to use his Constellation Reversal. Not only did he send all of his opponent’s power right back, it also carried his own strength. If even Xuan Bajing faced this skill, he would most likely be seriously injured.

But to his surprise, the clone flipped his body and stomped the ground, causing his body to tremble all over as the tremendous force was then transmitted back through his hands!

“Constellation Reversal?!” Guan Chouhai exclaimed in horror. This was a secret skill that was kept within Heavenly Sorrow Sect. Why did the clone know it too?! He used the Constellation Reversal skill again on instinct, sending the power back again.

Boom!

With a powerful explosion, both of them were sent flying by the tremendous force. Blood filled Guan Chouhai’s throat and trickled out from his mouth. Using that much power in such a hurry was something not even he could endure. The only saving grace was that a bit of blood came out of his opponent’s mouth as well. The clone’s injuries weren’t light either.

Meanwhile, Xuan Bajing was similarly dumbstruck. Guan Chouhai had wondered whether there was another pair of Twin Vajra Armbands, but apart from the few swords that Kunlun Void’s ancestors had passed down to Xuan Bajing, most of the eight swords were things he had spent much time and effort to collect over the years. How could the other side have eight identical swords? This definitely had to be an illusion!

However, a flying sword quickly cut through his sleeves and sent a streak of blood flying through the air.

Xuan Bajing was stunned. Even though he had deduced that this was very likely to be an illusion, he didn’t dare to let the enemy attack him. What if the blade passed through his head, but it wasn’t an illusion? He wouldn’t even have a chance to cry then. Helpless to do anything else, he could only defend himself with his own flying swords.

Sixteen flying swords clashed against each other. Xuan Bajing was known for his flying swords, already having reached a superb level of prowess with his eight swords. And yet, no matter how high his sword skill was, no matter what kind of tricks he used, the enemy’s swords were always able to swiftly retaliate.

In the past, he had really enjoyed seeing his opponents’ frustration against his flying swords. Now, it was his turn to experience the same thing. He felt incredibly sullen. It was as if he were fighting against himself. It was completely impossible to decide victory.

However, he was still a sect master. He quickly calmed down. It didn’t make sense at all for him to lose to a fake.

You can imitate my face and my sword, but don’t tell me even your way of thinking is identical?ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As such, he suddenly recalled his eight swords and merged them together to form a giant sword. Then, he thrust it forward. His opponent’s swords were instantly knocked flying when they made contact with the giant sword.

The other ‘Xuan Bajing’ quickly reached out his hand. The eight flying swords returned, also formed a giant sword.

The two giant swords clashed. The powerful clash was completely real, and could only result in serious injuries or even death. If their cultivations were really the same, they would both lose.

Suddenly, a strange smile appeared on Xuan Bajing’s lips. The next second, lightning radiance flickered and he was gone. In an instant, his giant sword also scattered into thin air.

Without its target, the clone’s full-powered attack missed. The surging ki and blood within him seemed to leave him feeling extremely uncomfortable.

In that moment of weakness, a streak of lightning appeared at his side. Xuan Bajing instantly materialized.

Thunder Flash Art!

The sword in his hand stabbed straight into his opponent’s ribs like a streak of lightning.

The clone’s entire body flickered with electricity. He instinctively tried to dodge, but he was still a bit too late and was hit. Xuan Bajing smirked in self-satisfaction. He didn’t know where this fake came from, but a fake could only be a fake; how could it be his match?

The clone looked down at his injury, but there was no alarm on his face. Instead, he raised his head with a strange smile.

Xuan Bajing frowned when he saw that smile. He couldn't figure out why the clone would have such an expression.

Suddenly, his expression changed. He looked down at his own ribs, and saw that there was actually a drip of blood on his clothes. Then, the blood quickly spread out, dyeing that side of his clothes red. He felt a wave of intense pain. He could no longer stand stably and kneeled down on one knee. He had to stab his sword into the ground to prevent himself from falling.

“How?!” he exclaimed in shock. He didn’t understand this at all. The attack that should have defeated his opponent had clearly landed, so why had the injury landed on himself? Even if it was an illusion, there was no way he would attack himself! With his many years of cultivation and experience, he couldn't understand how such a thing had been achieved at all. Earth immortals really were unfathomable…

…

Guan Chouhai shivered when he saw Xuan Bajing collapse. He didn’t even vainly think of injuring Zhao Han anymore. He only had a single thought in his mind: Run!

Unfortunately, even though that was what he wanted to do, the ‘Guan Chouhai’ on the other side wouldn’t allow that to happen. The Twin Vajra Armbands covered the skies and wrapped around his legs. Helpless to flee, he could only deal with the counterfeit first. But when he thought about how Xuan Bajing had clearly won against the fake, and yet had lost first, he felt despair.

The two of them exchanged more than ten blows before he suddenly thought of something. If Xuan Bajing hurt himself when he hurt the fake, what if I do the exact opposite? Would I be able to hurt this counterfeit instead?

Victory is often grasped from the jaws of defeat!

There were similar principles in the daoist sects. When he thought of that, he immediately moved and slammed his fist heavily against his own chest. He didn’t dare to strike his own head for fear of killing himself, but he still didn’t hold back. He had to strike while the enemy was unprepared.

“Pfft!” A mouthful of blood gushed out and he felt his ki and blood surge. His entire body’s meridians were filled with incomparable pain. However, he wasn’t concerned with his own injuries, and instead looked at the other side expectantly.

And yet, to his shock, the other ‘Guan Chouhai’ was completely unharmed. There was a mocking smile on his face.

“Motherf*cker! I was too rash! I’m so stupid, so…” Guan Chouhai muttered, feeling so angry that he fainted on the spot.
