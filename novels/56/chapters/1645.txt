Chapter 1594: Great Happiness

You have successfully trolled Qiu Honglei for +311 +311 +311…

The two women were naturally the master and disciple, Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei. They had been discussing something in a tavern before hearing all the noise happening outside. At first, they had wondered which damn official was showing off and planned to teach them a lesson, but they hadn’t expected to actually see Zu An.

Unfortunately, Zu An was parading himself around in too high-profile a manner, collecting countless Rage points from all the jealous onlookers. Furthermore, he was chatting with the officials around him, so he didn’t notice Qiu Honglei’s rage points.

“I’m so angry! I’m so angry! Here I am, missing him every single day, and yet look at how much fun he’s having with another girl!” Qiu Honglei grumbled, thinking about how bitterly she had cultivated so she could have a normal relationship with Zu An. Because of how hard she worked, she had almost experienced cultivation deviation.  As such, she was really shaken up by the sight. She picked up the bowl next to her, seemingly about to throw it.

Yun Jianyue jumped in fright and quickly reached out to stop her, protesting, “What are you doing?”

Qiu Honglei looked at her in confusion, replying, “Master, this isn’t like you! Your precious disciple is being bullied by that stupid man right now. It would be one thing if you didn’t get mad on my behalf, but you’re actually stopping me?”

Yun Jianyue’s expression became a bit strange as she replied, “Don’t forget the purpose of our mission this time. What if we end up startling our target and ruin everything? Besides, there are so many powerful cultivators and soldiers outside right now. Things will become really annoying if we start any trouble.”

Qiu Honglei pulled back her hand angrily, saying, “Master, I feel as if you’ve become a bit different from before.”

Yun Jianyue asked in alarm, “How so?”

“I can’t really explain it either…” Qiu Honglei trailed off with a frown. She just felt that her master seemed to have changed, as if Yun Jianyue felt a bit scared of being with her. Of course, she wouldn’t dare to say so out loud. She continued, “Master has never had so many misgivings when doing things before. Those officials and soldiers are all just useless nobodies. How can they be worth mentioning before the two of us?”

Perhaps they would have some trouble if they were in an open field, but at the moment, they were in a city with complex terrain everywhere. For them, It wouldn’t be difficult to throw off any pursuers at all.

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Your master is just domineering in nature; she’s not an idiot. Why would I want to go through all that unnecessary trouble?”

Qiu Honglei wrinkled her nose. She continued to glance toward the street, clearly still eager to give it a try.

Bang!

Yun Jianyue lowered the window and said, “Stop looking already and focus on your own situation. Once everything is taken care of, I won’t stop you from seeing Zu An.”

Qiu Honglei’s anger quickly turned to happiness. She grabbed Yun Jianyue’s arm and said, “Master is the best after all.”

The sensation rubbing against her arm left her inwardly shocked. Master is so big! I wonder who will have the blessing of becoming my martial father. However, she quickly dispelled that thought. Which man in this world could be a match for her master?

Yun Jianyue stiffly brushed Qiu Honglei’s arm away when she felt her disciple’s affection. A hint of guilt flickered across her face. I’m not that great of a master.

Qiu Honglei didn’t treat it as anything important. Her master was usually dignified, so it was natural for her to not be used to such intimacy. She said, “Master, you have to come with me later.”

“Why would I go with you?” Yun Jianyue exclaimed. Inwardly, she was frightened down to her very soul.

Qiu Honglei was a bit surprised that Yun Jianyue had suddenly raised her voice, but she still replied, “To clean up that heartless rat, of course! And that vixen at his side, too.”

Yun Jianyue sighed in relief when she realized that it wasn’t what she had been thinking of. She asked, “Isn’t it enough for you to go? With your current cultivation, I reckon that there aren’t many girls who could be your match anymore.”

Qiu Honglei muttered, “Didn’t you say that Ah Zu’s cultivation improved a lot? I might not be able to win against him, so of course I need you to help me beat him up!”

“It’s not ‘might’. You would definitely lose,” Yun Jianyue said, thinking back to the battle at the Fiend Court. She couldn't help but sigh in amazement. She really had no idea what that brat had eaten to grow so quickly. She continued, “But don’t worry. With your relationship, there’s no way he would hurt you.”

After what had happened between the two of them at the Fiend King Court, her feelings toward Zu An were very complicated, and she didn’t want to meet him again for some time, so how could she meet him with Qiu Honglei? Just the thought alone left her feeling restless.

“There’s no way he would hurt me normally, but it’s hard to say what would happen if I wanted to teach that girl a lesson,” Qiu Honglei muttered.

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes and said, “Don’t worry. With my understanding of that brat, he isn’t the type to forget favors and violate justice. If you really are worried, you can just let that girl Chu Chuyan do it. She’s not even doing a thing as his proper wife, so what are you getting so worked up for?”

“What proper wife? They already divorced each other!” Qiu Honglei grumbled unhappily. “But master, your idea isn’t bad. That woman Chu Chuyan always puts on a superior and aloof look; it’s so annoying! Not only would she be able to chase away all of Zu An’s sweethearts, Ah Zu would realize that she’s not some saint, and she’s just a normal woman.”

Yun Jianyue had always been annoyed by Yan Xuehen’s detached and aloof nature too. She was rather proud when she heard that. She said, “She can do the dirty work for you, and we’ll just enjoy the benefits from the sidelines. That’s what a witch should be like.”

“We?” Qiu Honglei asked, stunned.

Yun Jianyue realized her slip of the tongue and quickly explained, “We’re like mother and daughter, so your affairs are naturally my affairs.”

A huge smile quickly appeared on Qiu Honglei’s face. She grabbed Yun Jianyue’s arm and leaned her head against her master’s shoulder, saying, “Master is the best! I was raised by master ever since I was little, so of course I already treat you as my mother! If master isn’t going to get married in the future, I’ll just be your daughter and call you mom~”

“Don’t do that!” Yun Jianyue suddenly screamed.

“Huh?” Qiu Honglei responded, staring at her in confusion. She didn’t understand why Yun Jianyue had such a strong reaction.

“I…” Yun Jianyue trailed off, her face turning completely red. She felt very restless and uneasy, and yet frustrated that she couldn't explain herself. “The sect is full of hidden dirt and concealed corruption. There’s a ton of idle gossip constantly going around. If you really call me mom, then people will really think that you’re my illegitimate daughter. Your master’s reputation will be completely ruined then!”𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qiu Honglei giggled and asked, “Didn’t master previously teach me that a good reputation is something only those hypocritical fairies such as Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan cared about? Since when have we witches cared about that?”

“Damn girl, you’re talking back to your master now? If I say you can’t, then you can’t, or else I’m going to rip that mouth of yours off!” Yun Jianyue cried, feigning anger to hide the alarm she was feeling inside.

…

While the master and disciple were bickering with each other, Zu An found a chance to ask Sun Xun, “May I ask Xiang Minister Sun who King Yan’s guests are?”

A hint of ridicule flashed through Sun Xun’s eyes. Other people would usually avoid each other in such a situation, and yet this guy was taking the initiative to ask. Don’t tell me that he feels as if he hasn’t been embarrassed enough yet?

A hint of joy appeared in his mind, and he deliberately raised his voice as he said, “They are the White Jade Sect’s Sect Master Yan and the Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s Sect Master Guan, as well as some experts from their sects. These are people who would not accept it even if you invited them. They made a rare trip to Yi Commandery, so our king naturally does not dare to be negligent in their treatment.” His implication was that their status was higher than Zu An’s, and that King Yan wouldn’t dare to be negligent in their treatment, but he would for Zu An.

Forget about Yi Commandery’s officials; even Zhang Zijiang frowned. This Sun bastard was going too far. He was absolutely striking at Sir Zu’s dignity!

The kindhearted Xie Daoyun looked at Zu An worriedly, but Zu An didn’t get angry at all. On the contrary, he was actually really happy. White Jade Sect’s Sect Master Yan was here?
