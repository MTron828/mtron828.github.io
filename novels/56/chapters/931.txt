Chapter 898, Part 1: King Manor’s Secret

Zu An felt something stir within him when he saw that she wasn’t her usual prideful and dignified self, but rather acting flirtatiously. He said in a somewhat hoarse voice, “Woman, you’re playing with fire!”

“So what if I am? You’re so weak right now. Don’t tell me you can actually teach me a lesson?” the empress said with a giggle.

Eunuch Lu became a bit absent-minded. How many years had it been since he saw the empress so happy?

This was how she used to smile at and tease me… But just because I was too passive back then, she was taken by another man…

Sigh, what’s the point of thinking about these things? At this point, I’m happy as long as the empress is happy.

But why do I feel so awful? This is all completely useless…

Suddenly, he heard a groan. He turned around and saw that Zu An had pulled the empress into his arms. The empress’ grand phoenix robes were even becoming messy from his groping.

This kid dares?! Eunuch Lu’s eyelids twitched. He really… really wished that the man in her arms was himself. Unfortunately, he could only imagine that. He had to stand guard outside for the two of them right now too, or else someone might see something they weren’t supposed to.

“I don’t like being teased. Since that’s what you want, then I’ll satisfy you.” Zu An fiercely wrapped his arm around the empress’ waist and pulled her toward him. The soft and full waist of a mature woman didn’t provide any resistance, completely different from the youthful and energetic feeling of a younger girl.

The empress felt something strange. She lowered her head and immediately blurted out, “How dare you!” This fellow had already been injured so badly, and yet he…

Zu An laughed and remarked, “Why don’t you report this to his majesty then?”

The empress looked at him with her vivid eyes. “Why do we need to trouble his majesty about such things? I can just call over two lesser eunuchs and have you flogged.”

“I fear that your highness won’t be willing to see that happen,” Zu An said while examining her phoenix robes. Even though the two of them were already quite close to each other, this was the first time he had appreciated those robes so close up. He had to admit that the material was excellent. The phoenix embroidered in golden threads was also beautiful.

The empress’ heart pounded. She hadn’t expected him to be this daring! She had wanted to control the pace and keep him in check, and yet now, her entire body was growing weak from his groping.

“There are still guards outside…” She wanted to get upset, but when she spoke, there wasn’t even an ounce of anger. Her tender voice even gave her a scare.

Eunuch Lu felt more and more bitter inside. And yet, at the same time, he felt strangely stimulated.

“I know,” Zu An said nonchalantly. He obviously wouldn’t lose his head because of a woman that way.

That was primarily because his relationship with the empress was quite strange. They already had a physical relationship, and yet both of them knew that there wasn’t the slightest bit of love or affection. It was strictly an exchange of interests. This was a battlefield, and once one side lost the advantage, they would immediately suffer crushing defeat. That was why the two of them were constantly trying to seize the initiative.

The empress was speechless. What do you mean, you know? What about afterward? She felt as if she were falling into Zu An’s pace. Her reason told her that she had to get out, but this entirely new feeling made her reluctant to do so.

Suddenly, Eunuch Lu coughed as he stood by the entrance. The empress pushed Zu An away and stood up from his embrace. She quickly sorted out her messy robes. Eunuch Lu wouldn’t signal like this for no reason. He was clearly warning her.

Sure enough, Zhuxie Chixin’s voice came from outside. “Hm? Why is Eunuch Lu here?”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Eunuch Lu replied with a smile, “This old servant came with her highness to visit a worthy warrior. It turned out Chief Commander was here; you really are everywhere.”

“I just came out of the imperial study, so I decided to walk around this area.” Zhuxie Chixin walked toward the entrance as he spoke. He saw the empress inside and immediately greeted her. “I pay my respects to your highness.”

He was a bit shocked. The empress really did look glamorous today! She had been an incredible beauty to begin with, but it was because her mood hadn’t been great for the past few years that she had become a bit colder in appearance. Recently, her mood seemed to have improved quite a bit. Zhuxie Chixin thought, Looks like she feels at ease again now that the crown prince’s position has stabilized.

The empress said with a smile, “There’s no need for excessive courtesy, Chief Commander. Since the Chief Commander has returned, then I’ll leave this place to you.”

Zu An sighed. The palace’s women weren’t easy to deal with after all! That was true for both Bi Linglong and the empress. The fact that they couldn’t fight for the Oscar award was truly a pity.

“This subject will see your highness out.” Zhuxie Chixin followed the empress out.

The empress raised her eyebrows, but she didn’t say anything. After they walked out into the courtyard, she stopped and asked, “Speak; what did you want to say to me by following me out?”

Zhuxie Chixin began, “Your highness’ sight is grand…”

The empress cut him off. “Spit it out.” This was the emperor’s loyal dog. She found him annoying to even look at to begin with, let alone the fact that she had been interrupted earlier. She obviously wouldn’t treat him that nicely.

Zhuxie Chixin had to swallow his words back down. But this was the empress, so he couldn’t act out. He said, “I’ll have to trouble your highness to not talk about the dungeon’s details to anyone. His majesty hasn’t yet thought through how he wants to deal with this matter, so it must remain confidential.”

The empress was stunned at first, but she realized that this person probably thought that she had gone to Zu An’s room to gather intelligence, then contact the Liu clan. She asked, “Are you teaching me how to do things?” She didn’t bother explaining the misunderstanding. On the contrary, this was better.

Zhuxie Chixin quickly lowered his head in apology. “This subject doesn’t dare. It’s just that his majesty has been a bit troubled over this matter recently…”

“Don’t try to use his majesty to pressure me. I know what I’m doing,” the empress said coldly and turned around to leave.

Zhuxie Chixin had a bitter smile on his face as he watched her leave. The empress’ temper had been growing stranger and stranger over the years. In the end, it was still because of how his majesty treated her…

He left after exchanging some words with Zu An. Before his majesty made a decision, he still had to keep his distance from these people.

Then, some guards came to congratulate Zu An. The crown princess’ and empress’ rewards made them realize that he was definitely going to rise in status quickly. When Zu An was done dealing with them, he lay down and began to think about all types of possibilities. Then, he unwittingly fell asleep.

…

All this time, his vigilance had been so high that he almost hadn’t had any chance to sleep. Once he fell asleep, time quickly passed.

Suddenly, he felt something. He rushed out of bed and seized the neck of a black-clothed individual next to him, pressing them under his body.

“What’s wrong?” asked a familiar voice from outside. It was Eunuch Lu’s voice.

Zu An was alarmed. He saw the noble yet flirtatious look in the individual’s eyes. Who else could it be but the empress?

“Nothing, keep watching outside,” the empress said when Zu An loosened his grip.

“Mm.” Eunuch Lu gave a vague reply. He was clearly a bit upset.

Zu An tore off the black mask, revealing the empress’ mature and stunning face underneath. He was surprised and asked, “Why are you dressed like this?”

“Because someone kept saying that he’d come to the Palace of Peace, but never came. That’s why I could only come here myself.” The empress lay down on the bed. Her hands were raised casually above her head, putting her impressive figure in full view.

Zu An saw the black clothing she wore and he looked outside. It turned out he had slept all the way into the night. After blanking out for a moment, he reacted and said, “Your highness seems to have run around all night. Are you not worried that you might have jumped into the wrong bed?”

The empress’ charming eyes narrowed. “You’re on this bed, so I didn’t come to the wrong place.”

Zu An screamed inwardly. If not for Mi Li’s warning that this woman was trying to use his essence for her recovery, he might really have been fooled! He might really have thought that this woman was deeply in love with him.

“Then I really have to thank your highness for all the love.” He loosened his hand and got up from the bed. He walked over and poured a cup of tea.

The empress was shocked when she saw that this man wasn’t in a hurry to pounce on her. She supported her head with her hand and looked at him. “Everyone in the palace is talking about how you’re at death’s door, but you don’t seem wounded at all. Are you not scared that I’ll report this to his majesty?”

Zu An drained the tea in one gulp. “If you report this, I’ll tell him ‘your wife really is amazing’.”
