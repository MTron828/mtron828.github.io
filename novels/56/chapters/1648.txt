Chapter 1597: Are You Still Young If Your Blood Isn’t Hot Anymore?

The reason why Zhao Xiaodie had started causing trouble for Zu An was because she had heard that he was the reason for all of her father’s plans falling through. Her big brother had even had his legs broken before, putting Zu An on her blacklist for a long time as someone she often cursed. Now that she had met the real person, she naturally had to teach him a good lesson.

And yet, how could she have expected that she would be the one made to look like a fool when she hadn’t even accomplished anything yet?

She came from a noble background. Her father was King Qi, someone who was only beneath a single person and above all others. Even in Heavenly Sorrow Sect, she had always been surrounded by attention, with no lack of pursuers. She had tremendous confidence in her appearance. When had she ever experienced such a thing before?

“You little bastard, what did you say?” Zhao Xiaodie spat, slamming the table as she stood up. She looked almost as if she were about to bite him.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Zu An replied with a sigh, “I hadn’t expected the lady to already be suffering from hearing loss at such a young age. I really feel bad for you.”

The onlookers all had strange expressions. This guy really isn’t showing Princess Butterfly any respect!

Chu Chuyan and Xie Daoyun had strange expressions. They were the ones who knew best how nasty Zu An’s tongue was. Back in Brightmoon City, countless people had almost died from anger because of him. They hadn’t expected that even after all these years, this skill of his hadn’t declined at all.

Yan Xuehen became a bit absentminded. This guy had also angered her quite badly when they first met. This kid really could make one’s teeth ache so much that they couldn’t help but want to take a bite out of him…

Suddenly, she shivered and quickly returned to her normal ice-cold demeanor, so no one else would notice anything strange.

“Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!” Zhao Xiaodie screamed, almost fainting on the spot from anger.

She was just about to draw her sword when a young man next to her stopped her.

“Sir’s harsh treatment of the lady is not how a gentleman ought to act,” the man said, giving Zu An a cold look.

Zu An gave him a look. He had to admit that this guy was somewhat handsome. His skin was fair, and his figure was tall and slender. He had single eyelids and thin lips, clearly the type who could easily make women scream, but whom other men would all find annoying and look down on.

However, Zu An couldn’t help but feel disdain when he saw the man’s white clothes, white trousers, and large, luxurious outer garment, befitting a precious noble son. Why did he look like a chicken elder brother, or some pimp from the sex industry? Zu An really wanted to toss him a basketball to see what he’d do with it.

“And this gentleman over here is?” Zu An replied. Even though he called the man a gentleman, the mockery in his tone was unmistakable.

The young man scowled.

Zhao Xiaodie said, “This is my senior brother Zhi Yin. He’s the most talented disciple of Heavenly Sorrow in the past few decades; and yet, he’s also humble in nature, always behaving like a nobleman. Naturally, a wretched and uncouth individual such as you can’t possibly compare.” There was a hint of admiration in her expression when she looked at the man beside her.

When he heard his junior sister praise him like that, Zhi Yin’s mood improved considerably. He reflexively looked toward Chu Chuyan, wanting to see her reaction. Upon first hearing that the White Jade Sect had taken in an outstanding disciple, he had initially felt a bit of competitiveness. The moment he saw her, however, he had completely given up such thoughts, because he was absolutely enamored by her beauty. He had thought that even losing to her would be a blissful thing. Actually, even better, she should just step on me as hard as she can with those beautiful jade-like feet of hers…

Unfortunately, there wasn’t even the slightest ripple in Chu Chuyan’s expression. He couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.

Zu An was shocked when he noticed Zhi Yin’s expression. This damn toad is lusting after a swan’s flesh?!

“Even someone like this can be considered Heavenly Sorrow’s best genius in decades?” Zu An exclaimed, looking appalled. “There have always been rumors that my Great Zhou Dynasty already roped all of the world’s heroes into the court, causing the sects to end up quite barren. I thought that was a bit of an exaggeration before, but today, it seems as if that really is the case after all.”

Yan Xuehen had a strange expression. This kid really had no filter at all! Wasn’t her White Jade Sect cursed to suffer that way too?

After all, the lack of geniuses joining the sects was something that really weighed on the hearts of the different sects. Even though they had done their best to gather and nurture some good seeds, the difference compared to several hundred years prior was too obvious. After another hundred years or so, when the older generation passed on, the new generation would still be much smaller than the last.

Sure enough, the Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s representatives exploded on the spot. All of them loudly berated Zu An, flooding him with Rage points.

Just then, a middle-aged man who was sitting at the first table to the left of King Yan slowly said, “The young should not be too hot-blooded.”

Zu An gave him a look. The other person was dressed in voluminous robes, and the beard around his mouth was his most distinctive feature; his face was decent-looking, too. He was the definition of a handsome middle-aged man, and even had a hint of a bad boy aesthetic. He wore a smirk that seemed to have a devilish charm, giving him a slick and untrustworthy air. Still, some people found such a sly, lecherous appearance appealing. The grandmaster rank pressure he constantly exuded gave him an awe-inspiring air that could intimidate many people at first glance.

Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan’s ki transmissions reached Zu An’s ear at the same time. “Be careful; he is Heavenly Sorrow’s Sect Master Guan Chouhai.”

“Don’t worry. I know what I’m doing,” Zu An replied, nodding toward the two of them. He then replied to Guan Chouhai. “Can you still be considered young if your blood isn’t hot anymore?”

Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan were both stunned.

This is what you meant by ‘don’t worry’?!

Guan Chouhai was also stunned. He hadn’t expected this youngster to dare to speak to him that way.

King Yan had a strange expression. This kid really is courting death… But that’s fine too. I’ll just borrow Sect Master Guan to take care of one of my enemies. This can serve as a kind of payback for what happened in Cloudcenter Commandery.

Meanwhile, Sun Xun began to question life. Previously, this kid had acted incredibly subservient to him on purpose, not reacting at all. Thus, he had simply assumed Zu An was a pushover. And yet, now that Zu An faced King Yan and the grandmaster rank Heavenly Sorrow Sect Leader, why did he not show them the slightest bit of respect? Did that mean this kid didn’t even consider him worth anything, and that he didn’t even have the qualification to make Zu An angry?

Yi Commandery’s officials were both happy and worried. They were happy that Zu An wasn’t a pushover the way they had thought. Perhaps he would even be able to borrow his power to beat down the powerful King Yan. However, they were worried to see how rashly he was behaving even in front of a grandmaster. He didn’t seem to be particularly reliable, but rather the reckless sort.

Xie Daoyun was full of concern. She had naturally heard what kind of power a sect master of one of the nine daoist sects had! Even though her big brother Zu was formidable, he would no doubt suffer if he had to face someone who had already been famous for decades.

When he heard what Zu An said, Guan Chouhai’s gaze immediately became dangerous. He said, “Very good. Zhi Yin, why don’t you and this sir exchange some pointers? Let’s see just how hot-blooded he can be.”

You have successfully trolled Guan Chouhai for +100 +100 +100…

With his status as a senior, there was no way could act. Wouldn’t that be losing face to Yan Xuehen? It was enough to have his disciple teach Zu An a lesson.

Xuehen will probably approve of my generosity, right?

There was a hint of infatuation in his gaze when he looked at Yan Xuehen. Even after all these years, she was still just as stunning as when they had first met.

Zu An frowned, thinking, What the hell is this? The young are my rivals in love, and so are these old bastards?

Having too many lovers always results in these kinds of problems…

“Yes, master!” Zhi Yin greeted Guan Chouhai respectfully, then said to Zu An, “This sir over here, please give me some pointers!”

He could sense his master’s anger, so he had already decided that he was going to properly discipline this kid who didn’t know how big the world was. He planned to just barely leave Zu An with his life intact.

Zu An gave him a disdainful glance. Then, he shook his head and replied, “You’re not qualified.”

“What?” Zhi Yin exclaimed, thinking he had heard incorrectly. When he realized what had happened, the courteous smile on his face instantly disappeared. His pretty boy face turned completely red.

You have successfully trolled Zhi Yin for +666 +666 +666…

An even bigger uproar filled the place. The onlookers all had the same thought: Is this Zu guy serious?

Zhi Yin was a disciple Guan Chouhai had personally nurtured, and furthermore the most talented one in the past few decades! His cultivation was already on par with the master rank, which meant he could even face an older generation expert. In terms of their cultivation, the gap was no doubt as wide as the distance between the dirt on the ground and the clouds in the sky. It should have been Zu An’s honor that Zhi Yin was even willing to fight him, and yet he dared to say something like that?
