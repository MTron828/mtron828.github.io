Chapter 1408: Path to Immortality Ruined

At first, Zu An had thought that this Si Wenming was a relatively unknown figure, whom he had never even heard of before. No matter how crazy he was, there was no way he could compare to the legendary Gong Gong or Chi You.

Yet now, it turned out that Si Wenming was Yu the Great?! Who was Yu the Great? He was the very founder of the Xia Dynasty! He even had ‘great’ attached to his name! How many people could reach that level?!

The worst part was that, if Zu An wasn’t mistaken, this Unknown Region was clearly related to the Xia Dynasty. And yet, he had to fight against the land’s freaking founding ancestor? He’d almost be better off spending his time thinking of the different ways he could write the word ‘death’.

Just then, the voice said, “That’s why I want you to repeat Yi’s heroic path. If you obtain the divine weapon, you’ll have the ability to face him.”

Zu An was speechless. However, he also realized something. He couldn't help but ask, “Why do you have to target him? Don’t the history books say you abdicated your throne to him?”

“The history books?” The three women blinked their beautiful eyes. They found the use of that phrase rather strange.

“History?” The voice said with a hint of ridicule, “History is nothing more than what’s written by the winners.”

“Could it be that there’s some inside story that isn’t commonly known?” Zu An asked curiously. Before doing anything, he had to at least understand the ins and outs. Only then could he make a proper decision as to whether he would do it or not, and also how he would do it.

The voice hesitated, but it still said, “Actually, this subject doesn’t exactly paint me in the greatest light. Since you asked, though, there’s no harm in telling you.

“Back then, when I took over the position of emperor, even though many of the disasters of the world had already been destroyed, the flood persisted. In order to help the common people, I disregarded my former hatred and promoted Gun’s son Yu, putting him in charge of controlling the waters.”

Zu An asked with a strange expression, “His father died because of you, and yet you still dared to use him?”

The voice replied, “Royal families are different from ordinary people. Relationships between father and son, and even between brothers, aren’t that important. Instead, interests are the most important thing. As long as your interests align, even if a family head is killed, others in the family will still support you.

“I previously mentioned that many of the Black Emperor’s descendants had been oppressed by the White Emperor’s lineage for a long time. Most of the Black Emperor’s descendants harbored dissatisfaction toward the White Emperor’s faction. I represent those people’s interests. Those like Gun, who was clearly from the Black Emperor faction and yet went to serve the White Emperor loyally, selling out his own kind, were extremely uncommon.

“I thought that dealing with Gun would have already settled things. Furthermore, Yu and Gun weren’t actually on good terms. Their political views weren’t similar at all. Especially in the matter of controlling the waters, it wouldn’t be too far to say that they were complete opposites. That’s why I raised him up without worrying too much, giving their clan a chance to return to the Black Emperor faction.”

“As things turned out, I wasn’t mistaken either. He didn’t have much affection for Gun, and he didn’t intend to get revenge for his father either. Furthermore, his ability to control the waters was excellent, so he didn’t let down the trust I placed in him.”

“If he didn’t even want to get revenge for his father, how did your relationship break down?” Zu An asked, feeling extremely confused.

The voice replied, sounding baffled, “Do you think someone who wouldn’t even get revenge for his father is worthy of trust?”

Zu An was stunned, but immediately understood.

Duke Huan of Qi, one of the Five Hegemons, had been extremely miserable in his later years precisely because he treated some treacherous court officials too well. Once, when his appetite hadn’t been good, a sinister official had cooked and served his own newborn son to the duke.

The duke had even thought at first that it was delicious and appetizing. Later, when he heard the truth, he was really moved. He thought that person was incredibly loyal, to be willing to use his own son that way.

Guan Zhong had admonished him, saying, “He even dared to kill his own son, so why would he remain loyal to you when you’re not even related?” However, Duke Huan hadn’t listened at all. In the end, sure enough, he was done in by that very official.

If Yu could even put aside the grudge of his father’s death, that meant his schemes truly ran deep.

The voice sighed and said, “Only later did I manage to think things through, but unfortunately, it was already too late.

“As Yu got the waters under control, he accumulated tremendous prestige. At the same time, he roped in a lot of capable individuals. Furthermore, because I replaced Yao, many people from the White Emperor’s faction secretly defected to him.”

“Is that why you ended up being replaced?” Zu An asked. He thought to himself that those ‘abdications’ in ancient times really were treacherous… The story really had completely changed his viewpoint on many things.

“If that were all, it still wouldn’t have been enough to defeat me. More importantly, as Yu the Great managed the waters, he even obtained the support of the Flame Emperor’s lineage,” the voice said hatefully. “It was those powers working together that let them plot against me.”

“The Flame Emperor?” Zu An asked, stunned. Why was that group suddenly involved?

The voice explained, “Back then, in the battle between the Flame and Yellow Emperors, the Flame Emperor lost to the Yellow Emperor. However, the Flame Emperor’s group was never willing to accept that. They revolted in all sorts of different ways. Gong Gong and Chi You were the representative figures of the conflict, and the great flood was none other than the worst consequence of that.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Just as our Black Emperor’s lineage had many branches, the Flame Emperor also had many people who didn’t really approve of Gong Gong and Chi You’s ways. They believed that the two’s actions had already severely hurt the common people. The representative figure of that faction was the Flame Emperor’s third daughter, Yao Ji.

“Back then, when Yu was trying to control the floods, he passed by Mount Wu and obtained Yao Ji’s help. The Flame Emperor’s lineage always excelled at controlling water, so with their help, Yu gradually got the flood under control.

“After he succeeded at controlling the floods, his prestige climbed higher and higher until it threatened me. Only then did I realize that he had already amassed a huge force on his side. It was already impossible for me to deal with him.

“Back then, though, I was still optimistic. Either way, he was from the Black Emperor’s faction, and he was capable. Passing on the throne to him wouldn’t have been too big of a deal. I wasn’t the inflexible type who would insist on handing down the throne only to my son. On several occasions, I even hinted at my intentions to him.

“Still, he actually couldn't wait. When I was patrolling the Cangwu Field, he suddenly launched an ambush against me. Then, he announced the news of my death to the world. He buried me on the southern side of this place, Jiuyi Mountain, saying that I abdicated my position to him. Heh, it truly was a deep and sinister plot.”

Yan Xuehen exclaimed in shock, “So you are already… dead?”

“Correct. To a certain degree, I am indeed dead,” the voice said sadly. “My current self is nothing more than a remnant will that was left behind because I sensed that something was off and wanted to have something just in case. I hadn’t expected the worst to have already happened.”

Zu An thought to himself, Just a remnant will was enough to last until now? Just how terrifying was this guy when he was at his strongest?

Yun Jianyue said, “I apologize for speaking bluntly. What you speak of is already tens of thousands of years in the past. If your enemy hasn’t ascended, then he’s also died. Isn’t asking Ah Zu to help you rather meaningless?”

Yu Yanluo was worried about Zu An’s safety, so she spoke up in agreement. “That’s right. You weren’t Yu’s match even when you were at your strongest, and even just a remnant will of yours is beyond our understanding. I fear that it won’t be too realistic to place your hopes on us to get revenge for you.”

“The path to ascension was already ruined by then, so there’s no way Yu ascended. However, with his power, it isn’t impossible for him to have survived until now. No, he’s definitely still alive. I can still sense his aura in this world,” the voice said, seeming to be somewhat moved. It continued, “Furthermore, back then in Cangwu Field, I was already far from my peak. In contrast, Yu was at his strongest, and he even had the help of the best fighters from both the White and Flame Emperors’ lineage. That was why I lost.”

Yu Yanluo clicked her tongue inwardly. As expected, no strong individuals were willing to acknowledge defeat. Her question seemed to have provoked him a bit.

“What did you mean when you said that the path to ascension was already ruined?” Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were more concerned with that, and couldn't help but blurt out the question. Countless stunning individuals had risen over the years, and yet not a single one had been able to truly become an immortal. Could that be the reason?

The voice said indifferently, “That’s related to a tremendous secret that I can’t tell you. Of course, if you complete my request, I can consider telling you.”

Zu An was speechless. This guy seems a bit two-faced! He doesn’t resemble that so-called history’s incarnation of virtue all that much…
