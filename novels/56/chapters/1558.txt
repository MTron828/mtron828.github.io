Chapter 1507: Undisclosed Strength

Hu Qianxiao’s vicious assault was too sudden to stop. He eliminated Xue Han in a clean and efficient manner. Xue Han was a Regular Attendant with decent cultivation, but he didn’t even have a chance to retaliate against the attack.

The Second Prince was quite surprised. According to his intelligence, Hu Qianxiao and the Crown Prince had had secret dealings, and the Tiger King should have been roped in by his brother. Why was Hu Qianxiao siding with the Second Empress?

Most importantly, he was even completely into it. Don’t tell me he was bewitched by that slut, the Second Empress, and he’s showing off this side of himself to gain her favor?

In his opinion, that was the only rational explanation. As for Zu An, even though that guy was quite active and annoying, the Second Prince didn’t treat him as a big deal at all. Someone like that wasn’t even worthy of being his opponent.

Even though it was a bit regrettable that Xue Han had died, it was a good way to lure out the tiger. He looked in the Second Empress’ direction. A smirk appeared on his lips.

Almost at that exact moment, a black ripple appeared in the air above the palace gates. A long and slender sword stabbed directly toward the youngest prince.

The Crown Prince was already dead, and both the Third and Fourth Princes had been eliminated by the Crown Prince. Now, as long as he killed the youngest prince, the Second Prince would become the sole successor. With the youngest prince’s death, the forces that gathered around him would completely collapse. Hadn’t the same thing happened not too long ago?

As for Hu Qianxiao, he was indeed a bit tricky, but he was a smart person. Once the broader situation was settled, he wouldn’t necessarily take the risk because of a woman.

Clang!

With a loud noise, the sword that had been about to remove the youngest prince’s head was blocked by a curved crescent moon.

The Second Prince’s eyes immediately widened. The one who had interfered was actually the exceptionally beautiful, huge-chested woman by Zu An’s side.

Duantian Chou was a glorious grandmaster with astounding assassination skills. And yet, this woman, who looked like a beauty who had been raised to be a member of a harem, was actually able to stop his lethal strike!

Duantian Chou was clearly surprised as well. However, he didn’t continue fighting zealously. Instead, the black vortex opened, and he instantly reappeared in the air more than a hundred meters away.

That was the way of the assassin. When an attempt failed, one would retreat far away. He was very thankful that he had always respected that absolute principle, because the instant he left, an ice-cold sword had already thrust at his original position. It even froze the surrounding air into ice!

If he had been even a tiny bit slower, that horrifyingly cold sword would have sealed the air around him. He wouldn’t have been able to leap through space anymore.

There were two grandmasters!

It wasn’t just him who was horrified; so were the Second Prince’s people. They could never have expected the youngest prince to have such support.

Yun Jianyue harrumphed, then rushed at Duantian Chou by running through the air.

Duantian Chou almost wanted to laugh when he saw her. Who does this woman think I am? Does she actually dare to chase after me, one of the greatest assassins?

Untold numbers of strong cultivators had died by his hand. As long as the white-clad woman didn’t help, he was confident he could destroy the long-haired woman.

Hmph, when experts are of a similar level, such a massive chest can only be a hindrance. Furthermore, even her hair is so long. She’s full of openings!

Even though this woman’s cultivation is high, how could she compare to me in terms of killing people?

After all these years, he had actually encountered several opponents at the same level. However, all of them, without exception, had merely had high cultivations but weren’t good at killing. In the end, they had died while filled with regret.

Soon afterward, however, the smile faded from his face.

What is going on with this almost tangible killing intent? Why does this woman who looks as if she came from a brothel have such strong killing intent?

Compared to her, the number of people I’ve killed almost makes me seem like the little brother…

The Second Prince frowned when he saw Duantian Chou at a disadvantage. He said to the elder at his left, “Sixth Uncle, I’ll have to trouble you.”

The elder sighed and replied, “Sigh, getting a salary from you really isn’t easy. Didn’t we already agree that I would only help you deal with Elder Wu?”

If he had been asked to deal with some random army, something he could have just dealt with easily, he wouldn’t really mind. However, this was a grandmaster, so he was a bit unwilling.

The Second Prince said with a serious expression, “I’ll pay more. I’ll double our earlier agreement.”

The elder’s eyes lit up and he replied, “Okay, I’ll help you deal with the white-clad woman. The rest is none of my business.”

The Second Prince nodded. He knew someone from the Committee of Elders would never act against the youngest prince.

The elder walked toward the palace gate step by step. It was as if there were invisible stairs beneath his feet. He looked straight at Yan Xuehen and asked, “This miss over there, which master and sect did you study under? That sword was quite stunning.”

What was stunning about her definitely wasn’t limited to just that sword. Her clothes were purer than snow, and her long hair scattered behind her, making her look even more beautiful. If he had met her when he was younger, even someone like him might have fallen for her.

Now that he was older, though, he really couldn't do it anymore… Ahem, women would only slow down the speed of my sword draw.

Yan Xuehen didn’t reply. What the elder got in return was nothing but a sword amid snow.

Zu An smiled when he saw that. This was just how she always was; ice-cold face, ice-cold sword, ice-cold personality.

I’m the only one who knows how hot it is underneath that frozen, icy shell.

The elder’s expression changed. At first, he had treated his opponent as a junior, judging her based on her young appearance. He hadn’t expected that there wouldn’t be the slightest trace of immaturity in her attacks. On the contrary, it felt as if she had already been at the grandmaster rank for a long time.

He didn’t dare to show any carelessness and gathered his attention. Soon, streaks of terrifying light erupted in the air. Both of them knew that a battle here would harm their own side, so they both tacitly agreed to fly above the clouds and battle there.

The Second Prince retracted his gaze. Those battles wouldn’t end for some time. In the end, it would still depend on him to settle things. Thus, he waved his hand, and his elite troops roared as they charged at the palace gates.

He had a hundred and twenty percent confidence in his own elite troops. Together with the Golden Crow Guards he had taken into his own army, he had more than enough to spare for defeating the youngest prince’s men.

Hu Qianxiao was a bit conflicted. The Second Prince’s military strength was a bit greater, so it was difficult to say who would win.

Is there a need for me to get heavily involved in this battle? Or should I step forward when the situation is a bit clearer?

He turned around to look at Zu An atop the city gate. Zu An’s expression was calm, giving him a mysterious and unpredictable air.

Thus, Hu Qianxiao gritted his teeth and roared, charging at the Second Prince. The shock of witnessing Shi Zhentian being shot down by a single arrow was just too great. In the end, he really didn’t want to experience that himself.

Even though the Second Prince’s forces were strong, he was a bit weaker in terms of high-level cultivators. Meanwhile, Hu Qianxiao was a grandmaster himself, which would prove to be of critical importance in the battle.

The Second Prince sneered when he saw the other man rush at him. Hu Qianxiao suddenly felt alarmed. He quickly extended his tiger tail to one side, lashing out in that direction.

This was his trump card, something he had refined into a magic weapon ever since he was young. It wasn’t inferior to the best heaven-grade weapon and could even temporarily reach the power of immortal-grade. Even a grandmaster would be seriously injured from his strike.

Pa!

A loud and crisp noise rang out. Hu Qianxiao screamed loudly and jumped while clutching his butt. His vicious tail already had a chunk of its flesh ripped out, dripping with blood. If not for his hard work refining that part, it might have already been torn off.

A strange and ugly person with only a few sparse patches of hair on his head cracked open a grin, revealing his sharp, pitch-black teeth. Every single tooth was like a sharp dagger, and a chunk of tiger skin dripping with blood hung from them. It clearly came from Hu Qianxiao’s tail. His tongue wrapped around it and he swallowed. With a chuckle, he said, “Not a bad flavor…”

Hu Qianxiao was shocked and furious, exclaiming, “Heichi Suiya!”

The ‘monster’ Heichi Suiya laughed sinisterly, replying, “I didn’t expect you to still remember this old one’s name.”

Atop the palace gates, when she saw Zu An’s confused expression, the Second Empress explained gently, “Heichi Suiya is the infamous traitor of the Black Teeth race. He had great talent, but his schemes were dishonest. In order to grow his cultivation, he trained in a skill that let him devour other creatures. The Black Teeth race’s skills lie in their mouths. Heichi Suiya took it to a new level, relying on his sharp teeth to become a grandmaster.

“Back then, because he harmed too many creatures and even hurt the children of aristocrats in the Fiend King Court, he ended up provoking public anger. That was why the Black Teeth race’s leader banished him from the clan. Without the protection of the Black Teeth race, he received the scorn of all and was forced to lay low for many years. People all thought he had died, but it turns out he sided with the Second Prince.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Right, the Second Prince’s wife is also from the Black Teeth race, but the Black Teeth race has more loyalty to the Crown Prince. The Second Prince has never received their favor.”

Zu An thought to himself, The Second Empress really is considerate. I didn’t even have to take the initiative to ask about these things!

The Second Prince really did have to work really hard. He already began to plan all this so many years ago.

Hu Qianxiao roared angrily, “You’re nothing more than an insignificant has-been. Do you think this king is scared of you?!”

As the king of beasts, he also had his pride. He had initially only planned to do the bare minimum today, but he had actually been bitten by this guy, who had even swallowed his flesh with that smug expression.

Unforgivable! How am I going to survive in my social circles after this?

The two began to fight fiercely. However, the Second Prince didn’t even give them another look and looked off to one side, saying, “Sir Fu, I’ll need to trouble you.”

Cackle cackle cackle…

With a sinister laugh, a giant bat suddenly flew into the sky.

The soldiers nearby, and even some of the stronger cultivators, felt their blood boil. Then, they screamed miserably as their blood left their bodies and flew toward the bat in midair.
