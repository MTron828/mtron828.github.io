Chapter 1385: He Will Fight to Live

Zu An was speechless.

In truth, after all his experiences, he wasn’t all that scared of death. However, the thought of getting transformed into some disgusting half-human half-monster thing and being covered all over in those disgusting scales… He would rather die. When he looked at the scales on his wrist, he felt as if he were looking at the barnacles on the bodies of whales and sea turtles in his previous world; they were absolutely disgusting.

Suddenly, he cried out miserably and fell to the ground.

“Ah Zu!” Yu Yanluo quickly rushed forward when she saw that. Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue also followed her.

This time, the Fiend Emperor didn’t stop them. He could tell that there was something wrong with the resentment and didn’t mind having a few more people test it out.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue immediately sensed that something wasn’t right when they entered the region. However, they were too worried about Zu An to give into their reservations.

Yu Yanluo arrived at Zu An’s side and rested his body against hers, asking, “Ah Zu, what’s wrong?”

“Don’t come in here… There’s poison,” Zu An said weakly.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue staggered and almost fell as well. Their bodies weren’t as tough as Zu An’s, and with their injuries, their resistance had become weaker than usual.

“What is this?” the two women cried out in alarm with trembling voices. They noticed what was happening to their wrists and frantically rubbed the scales to try to get rid of them. They were still women, after all. How could they stand having that kind of stuff on them?

Yu Yanluo asked in surprise, “What happened to you two?”

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were also confused. Yu Yanluo’s cultivation was even weaker than theirs, so how was she fine?

Zu An quickly checked Yu Yanluo’s wrist. He saw that even though there were some faint black marks on her, there weren’t any black scales growing. He thought, Does this have something to do with the Medusa’s bloodline?

However, there was no time to think about that, so he shot her a meaningful glance. The two of them had already spent a long time around each other, so Yu Yanluo knew what he was thinking. With a cry, she copied the others and pretended to faint.

“What is going on?” the Fiend Emperor called out.

Zu An explained, “The resentment is too strong. If a person enters this region, it seems to strip them of their life force, and scales begin to grow on their body. Their consciousness grows weak too. We can’t stay here! We have to go back…”

“Continue forward!” the Fiend Emperor said coldly. He was alarmed when he heard that the resentment drained life force. After all, he didn’t have much of his lifespan left. Every bit he lost would hurt him tremendously.

“Are you trying to kill me?!” Zu An exclaimed, pretending to be furious. In response, the Fiend Emperor didn’t say anything and just activated the Puppet Curse.

Zu An felt as if the Golden Crow eyes in his mind had suddenly opened. Then, they released an irresistible will that couldn't be guarded against at all.

This Puppet Curse is actually so terrifying?! Zu An thought. He felt as if he had lost control of his entire body. He automatically walked forward.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince was delighted to see that. He had never liked how smug Zu An always was. Unfortunately, his father had always protected Zu An before. Now, he could finally watch his enemy die.

However, Yu Yanluo and the other women also chased after Zu An in shock. The crown prince began to panic when he saw that, asking, “Father emperor, how about we let them come back?”

Those were top-tier beauties! If they perished along with Zu An, that would just be too much of a waste.

The Fiend Emperor said indifferently, “We do not know what the situation is like up ahead, so we just happen to need more people to look around. They all have different kinds of constitutions, so it should serve as a perfect comparison.”

He didn’t dare to carry a shred of carelessness now that the situation was related to his life. Even though it was a bit of a pity to lose several incredible talents, compared to his life, they weren’t worth much at all.

Wu Liang shuddered in fear when he heard their conversation. He felt a pang of sympathy as he watched Zu An’s party head deep into the black smoke.

The women then picked up Zu An and stuck together. Zu An took the chance to give them a few looks. Then, he quickly drew on their hands, telling them that they should take the chance to leave the area.

Yan Xuehen looked at him with her beautiful eyes, as if she could speak through them. She communicated, “What about your Puppet Curse?”

“I have a way, but I have to leave the Fiend Emperor’s range of control first,” Zu An quickly wrote on her fair, small, jade-like hand. However, his wrist was already covered in a ring of glaring black scales.

Yan Xuehen had clearly noticed that as well. She instinctively wanted to pull her hand back, but Zu An grabbed it firmly. She knew that the Fiend Emperor was staring at them. If they moved too quickly, he would easily notice that something was off. She could only pull down her sleeves a bit to cover her wrist.

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes. Do they not understand the situation they’re in right now? And yet they’re still flirting over there. She shot Yan Xuehen a look. This woman wasn’t someone who normally cared that much about her appearance…

Still, they were facing a disaster, so none of them thought too much of it.

The other three felt their bodies grow heavier and heavier. Their minds were starting to falter, too. They couldn't help but look toward Yu Yanluo, asking, “How are you still fine?”

Apart from there being some black energy around her wrist, there wasn’t anything wrong with her at all. On the surface, they were supporting each other, but in reality, she was the one carrying the most weight and supporting the others.

Yu Yanluo shook her head. She clearly didn’t know what was happening either. They weren’t in any state to figure it out right on the spot either. Their only thought was to leave the region as quickly as possible.

“It should be safe once we reach the mountaintop,” Zu An quickly wrote.

“How do you know?” Yun Jianyue replied, looking at him in confusion.

“I don’t have time to explain. Let’s hurry,” Zu An said. He couldn't just say that it was Mi Li who told him, right?

Suddenly, he felt a sense of danger. He quickly sent a palm strike to one side. As a black creature leaped out, Zu An’s palm slammed into its head. The black creature became indistinct for a moment. However, the surrounding black energy entered its body and it returned to normal. It bared its fangs viciously.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In the distance, Wu Liang cried out, “What kind of monster is that?!”

Black energy emanated from the monster’s entire body. It was neither a human or a dog, but resembled both in some ways. Its entire body was covered in scales. The long tail behind it also made it resemble a lizard.

“Is that a person who lost himself in the mist before?” the Golden Crow Crown Prince exclaimed, suddenly feeling a bit frightened. He had seen similar scales grow on Zu An’s arm before. The only pity was that the three beauties were going to become that kind of monster too.

“That creature is in a semi-tangible form. It seems to be something created out of resentment,” the Fiend Emperor explained, his expression turning grave. After all, he had never seen that kind of creature before either. After growing old, one would subconsciously become increasingly less fond of the unknown.

Zu An and the others attacked. They were being corroded by the strange resentment, so they didn’t dare to waste a moment.

Even though the monster was strange, how could it withstand the joint attacks of several powerful cultivators? It screamed, then completely scattered into black energy.

“This thing doesn’t seem as if it can die. From the looks of it, it’ll probably revive after some time,” Yun Jianyue said, looking at the black energy that was all around them and recalled how the black smoke had entered its body.

“I’m not scared of more of them coming, I’m actually scared that there’s not enough of them,” Zu An sneered. He used the Lion’s Roar skill, releasing a great roar. His bold and powerful voice reverberated through the entire valley. Rustling trees and trembling ground followed in its wake.

“What are you doing?!” the Fiend Emperor exclaimed, his expression changing. He hadn’t expected Zu An to make such a choice. He immediately ordered, “Shut your mouth!”

Zu An was affected by the Puppet Curse and had no choice but to close his mouth. However, he had already achieved his objective. Countless specks of red light appeared in the distance. They were the eyes of creatures similar to the monster he had just faced. They had clearly been alerted by his roar.

The red eyes surrounded them from all directions. A great pressure immediately filled the place.

Even Yun Jianyue, with her dauntless nature, was starting to feel scared. In their current state, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to deal with so many monsters. There seemed to be no end to the monsters, and they were being corroded by the resentment present. As time went on, they wouldn’t be able to withstand it!
