Chapter 1456: Deliberate Misrepresentation

Zu An felt excited. He had always been curious about where Daji, Mo Xi, and the other Valkyries’ souls were. He had been wondering what he had to do to complete their souls, but had no idea where to even start looking.

Now, he finally had a chance to repair Mo Xi’s soul! However, Mo Xi had already severed her relationship with him.

Whether or not she becomes whole again, it has nothing to do with me. Zu An felt his insides twitch when he thought of that. It really hurt too much.

“What do we do now? Should we work together to capture her?” Yun Jianyue asked. Even though she felt strangely happy to see it, suffering such a loss and just sucking it up wasn’t her style. She already treated Zu An as one of her own, so she naturally felt the same as if it had happened to her.

Yan Xuehen hesitated for a moment. After all, the current situation meant her Love Is More Solid than Gold would never be undone. However, whether or not it was undone didn’t really make that big of a difference anymore. Either way… Either way, I’ll just return to White Jade Sect and never meet him again…

Zu An remained silent for a moment. He then shook his head slightly and said, “Her cultivation is too high. Even if we subdue her, I have no way of making her listen and undo our contracts.”

“Our?” Yu Yanluo was stunned. Is there someone else in our group who was affected by a curse?

When he saw Yan Xuehen’s death glare, Zu An quickly yawned to hide his guilty expression before saying, “Let’s think of a way to find that Yi Yin guy first.”

Sure enough, Yu Yanluo’s attention was diverted. She asked, “We don’t even know who Yi Yin is. Where would we go to find him?”

“I actually know a bit about Yi Yin…” Zu An began. As the group left the valley, he told the others what he knew about Yi Yin. “Mo Xi is an empress from the last period of an ancient civilization called the Xia Dynasty. When the Shang Dynasty replaced the Xia Dynasty, Yi Yin was a minister who provided outstanding service…”

Afterward, Zu An concluded, “Unfortunately, I don’t know where to find Yi Yin either.”

The others frowned. Yu Yanluo couldn't help but ask, “Then what do we do about your Puppet Curse?”

Zu An remained silent for a while. Then, killing intent flickered through his eyes and he said, “As long as we can deal with the Fiend Emperor in this world, it won’t matter.”

After all, if the user was gone, the Puppet Curse would become meaningless as well.

The three women were shocked. Their first reaction was to think his idea was outrageous, but after thinking about it, they felt that it made some kind of sense.

After all, Zu An had even shot down the Golden Crow suns in the sky. Those suns and Xi He were countless times stronger than the Fiend Emperor. He had one last arrow bestowed by the Celestial Emperor left, so killing the Fiend Emperor wouldn’t be a problem either.

A strong smell of wine suddenly drifted through the air.

“Why is there wine here?” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, stunned.

Zu An was delighted, saying, “If there’s wine, that means there’s a home nearby. We should seek them out and ask them some questions, and see if there are any clues as to Yi Yin’s whereabouts.”Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

If not even Mo Xi knew where the other party was, there was an even smaller chance of anyone else knowing about Yi Yin. However, they had no chance but to give it a try. Thus, the group followed the source of the smell.

Soon, a small lake appeared in front of them. There weren’t any villages or the like nearby; they looked around for a long time before eventually confirming that the wine smell did come from the small lake.

“Is this entire lake wine?” Zu An wondered, reaching out to touch a bit of the water in surprise.

“Who is causing a racket and disturbing this noble’s time of elegance?” a loud and clear voice called out, seemingly unhappy about being bothered.

Only then did the group notice that there was someone lying down in the center of the lake. He was covered by a giant lotus leaf, which was why they didn’t notice him. He appeared to be a fatty with a round belly, resembling the big-bellied middle-aged men from Zu An’s previous world. However, the man’s body wasn’t full of fat, but rather stout muscle.

“Noble?” Zu An repeated, stunned. That kind of address seemed…

However, Yu Yanluo was more worried about his Puppet Curse, so she asked the man, “This big brother over here, have you heard of Yi Yin before?”

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue sighed in amazement. Yu Yanluo’s voice was really nice to listen to. Which man in this world could resist a question from her?

“Yi Yin?” The fatty who had been lying down quickly sat up. His gaze became fierce as he asked, “Are you asking about Yi Yin?”

Yu Yanluo was alarmed. The man’s reaction was strange! Still, she replied, “Indeed. I wonder if big brother knows where we can go to find Yi Yin?”

That fatty replied, “That bastard Yi Yin who ruined this noble’s entire country? How could I not know of him?”

Yu Yanluo’s expression changed. She immediately realized she had asked the wrong person.

The fatty sized up Yu Yanluo and the other girls. A look of greed flashed through his eyes as he remarked, “There were actually women this beautiful in this world? And not only one, but actually three of them? Haha, this noble’s luck really is good. All of you can just stay behind and keep me company!”

Yun Jianyue’s expression turned cold and she snapped, “You’re courting death!” How could she stand this? Her Crescent Ring flew through the air toward the fatty’s neck.

The fatty harrumphed. With a wave of his hand, the surrounding lake water surged, forming several layers of water barriers. Even the incredibly sharp Crescent Ring bounced right off!

The others’ expressions changed and they exclaimed, “Earth immortal!”

The fatty walked across the lake's surface, his heavy body not sinking in at all. He said, “This noble has already remained here alone for so many years. The heavens must have felt pity for me, and thus sent me three great beauties!”

Zu An quickly stood protectively in front of the three women, exclaiming, “We have to run!”

It hadn’t been that long since all of them worked together to shoot down the suns, so they had used up quite a bit of their strength. Furthermore, even if they were at their peak, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to win against an earth immortal unless they used the Sun Slaying Bow. Still, using it now would be too much of a waste.

When he saw how close Zu An was to the three women, the fatty’s expression darkened. He said, “The beauties can stay, but there is no need for men.”

You have successfully trolled Xia Jie for +444 +444 +444…

Zu An was shocked and alarmed when he saw that name.

Since there was a Mo Xi, there naturally had to be a Xia Jie. Nanchao was precisely where those two people had been banished after the Shang Dynasty took over the Xia Dynasty. The lake was full of wine. Could that be proof that Xia Jie was an incapable ruler obsessed with drinks?

While Zu An was stunned, several wine arrows surrounded by terrifying auras flew toward him. That power wasn’t something he could contend against in his current state. Fortunately, he had the Blue Mallard ability, so he resonated with the water element and quickly deflected the incoming arrows.

“Interesting,” Xia Jie said in surprise. Then, he charged forth with a malicious smile.

Zu An used Grandgale to move quickly. Yan Xuehen and the others had fled ahead of time; she couldn't help but say, “We cannot escape from an earth immortal! If we stay and fight, we might have a chance at survival.”

With her experiences, she had naturally deduced that fleeing like this would only result in them getting chased down one by one. There wouldn’t be any chance of survival. Why would Zu An make such an unwise decision?

“We’ll head toward where Mo Xi is!” Zu An replied, already having a plan in mind. He grabbed the three women and continued to use Grandgale to flee.

Fortunately, they weren’t too far away. Soon afterward, they returned to the valley. Mo Xi was dancing joyfully amid the silk as if she were celebrating something.

When he saw that there was only a single Mo Xi now, Zu An became dejected. Could it be…

“Why did you come back so quickly? Could it be that you already found Yi Yin?” Mo Xi noticed the group and asked in confusion. Her current form was already much more stable than before. Her eyes were even more intelligent and beautiful.

Zu An didn’t have time to reply, as Xia Jie roared furiously from behind them. He hadn’t expected to have almost let a few ants escape! Absolutely preposterous!

You have successfully trolled Xia Jie for +666 +666 +666…

When she heard Xia Jie’s voice, Mo Xi’s face darkened. She asked, “Why are you here?”

The smoke and dust settled, quickly revealing Xia Jie. When he saw Mo Xi, he frowned, saying, “I’m not here for you. These fellows have offended me, so don’t get in my way.”

Mo Xi gave Zu An a look and said, “Since you haven’t found the one I’m looking for, you have nothing to do with me.” She clearly didn’t intend to offend Xia Jie because of Zu An’s group.

Yan Xuehen and the others felt a weight sink in their stomachs. So these two knew each other! Furthermore, Mo Xi had made it clear that she was only going to watch. That meant Ah Zu’s tactics had failed!

However, Zu An simply replied, “Who said I didn’t find him? Isn’t he none other than Yi Yin?”

After saying that, he pointed at Xia Jie, activating the skill ‘Nickname Card[1]’, changing his name to Yi Yin!
