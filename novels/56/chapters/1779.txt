Chapter 1728: To Rope Him In

“Amitabha buddha, if I do not go to hell, who will?” Ruhua replied as he put his hands together. He had a solemn expression as he said, “If I can eliminate you, the enemy of the buddha, some sacrifices must be made.”

The Buddhist sect had thrived during the previous dynasty, but in the past century, Zhao Han had oppressed them greatly. Now, they were already struggling while at death’s door. That was why calling him the enemy of the buddha wasn’t too surprising.

Zhao Han sneered and retorted, “Some sacrifices must be made? But doesn’t it seem as if you’re only sacrificing other people?”

Ruhua shook his head and said, “If this poor monk’s sacrifice had been enough to defeat you, I would already have honorably committed to it.” His expression was steady and without any shame or guilt. These were clearly his true thoughts.

Zhao Han could sense Ruhua’s resolve, so he didn’t waste time bickering anymore. Instead, he asked curiously, “Just how did you become that little monk? Was it through that rumored Reincarnation Technique of your Buddhist sect?”

If rebirth really existed, why would there even be a need to painstakingly pursue immortality?

Ruhua nodded slightly and said, “Apart from our Buddhist sect’s secret technique, we also used the daoist sects’ One Breath Threefold Clarity as reference. When this poor monk realized that the situation was already against me, I separated my yang soul. Then, through a secret technique, I became an infant and cultivated once more. This was an extremely risky endeavor, but fortunately, I succeeded in the end.”

Zhao Han nodded. It was similar to how he had attached his own yang soul to the Crown Prince Zhao Ruizhi’s body. However, that kind of possession was only done as a last resort, and was full of unwanted side effects. The most severe restriction was that it would be impossible to surpass his original body’s cultivation, and he couldn't do it more than three times. That was related to the natural heavenly dao of the universe. Otherwise, wouldn’t all earth immortals just be able to continue on and on like that?

In contrast, Monk Ruhua’s decision was a bit more brilliant. Was it able to go against the principles of heavenly dao?

He wanted to ask more, but Monk Ruhua didn’t wish to continue the conversation and said, “Your majesty’s cultivation is brilliant, and your ability to regenerate is naturally shocking as well. You are likely stalling for time to recover as much as possible, no?”

Zhao Han sneered. “My flesh injuries are one thing, but why don’t you try and recover from damage to the primordial spirit that quickly?”

Ruhua was quite confused when he heard that. He asked, “But why is it that this poor monk doesn’t feel even a bit of fear from your majesty, as if everything is still in the palm of your hand?”

“Because this emperor still has more people on my side,” Zhao Han said with a smile. While his opponents were confused, he looked in a certain direction and called out, “Marquis, why don’t you come out now?”

Afterward, a group of people slowly appeared. The one in the lead was quite handsome, but his expression was a bit conflicted as he said, “It seems we’ve come at the wrong time.”

Zu An was in quite an awkward position. Previously, they had managed to open up a path in the formation with the help of Yan Xuehen and Xie Daoyun. He had thought that once the two sides fought to a certain point, he would then come out to collect the spoils. Who could have expected that he would end up in such a situation?

Almost everyone on Golden Peak had been wiped out. Zhuxie Chixin, Eunuch Wen, and Guo Zhi, as well as those Embroidered Envoys and Imperial Guards, had all died. Many of those were people he had even interacted with and had some friendship with. It was quite a sight for them to end up in such a state. Zhao Han’s current condition wasn’t too great either.

Meanwhile, that fat little monk was actually a hidden earth immortal? Zu An couldn't help but give Ruhua a second look, thinking, This guy really hid his schemes well! He was always getting hit in the head by Master Jian Huang, and yet he was actually the master?

While Zu An was looking at Ruhua, the remaining people on Golden Peak were also looking at his group.

Zu An was quickly overlooked because both sides were more than familiar with him. It was the people at his side who drew more attention: The aloof and indifferent Yan Xuehen, the domineering and stunning Yun Jianyue, the endlessly charming Qiu Honglei, the graceful and elegant Xie Daoyun…

Why are there so many damn beauties at his side? Was he on vacation with his women or something?

After the earlier battle, Golden Peak had been left in tatters. Now that these beauties had appeared, many people suddenly felt as if they were a bit out of place. Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue in particular were known arch-enemies. Why were they now standing next to each other like sisters?

The women were likewise sizing up the situation. They were shocked by the scene on Golden Peak. The buildings on Golden Peak had already been completely destroyed, and the ground seemed to have been plowed through several times. It even felt as if Golden Peak had sunk a bit lower than when they first arrived. That was clearly the result of the great battle.

Yan Xuehen shivered inwardly when she saw Li Changsheng. It was already obvious that he had participated in the ambush against Zhao Han. When she recalled how much he had distanced himself from her recently, it was likely because of that. Her heart plummeted. A single mistake in this situation could end up in the complete destruction of the White Jade Sect.

Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei both had huge smiles, in contrast. After all, for them, the daoists and the emperor were both their enemies. What more could they ask for if the two sides took each other out? The only regrettable thing was that the monk had an absolute advantage right now. For the Devil Sect, he was also a great enemy.

Xie Daoyun’s feelings were in turmoil. As someone who came from an official’s clan, she had received a patriotic upbringing. When she saw the emperor in his current state, she felt her heart rush into her throat.

Not good, not good! I didn’t notice a thing even though something so big happened! If something happens to the emperor, will he blame me? Will it end up involving the Xie clan?

Teacher is definitely really disappointed in me. At this point, I might not have the shamelessness to remain in the academy…

Zhao Han’s eyes narrowed slightly when he saw Yun Jianyue. This brat was actually with the Devil Sect Master? As expected, he already had bad intentions. He suddenly recalled that during her invasion of the palace, Zu An had been there too. The reason why she had been able to successfully escape could very well have been his help.

However, he quickly set those thoughts aside and instead said gently, “No, you have come at just the right time.”

Zu An cursed inwardly. This bastard usually always bosses me around, and yet he’s calling me marquis and kindly asking me for help now!

Sure enough, Zhao Han said, “Marquis, these people have started a rebellion. Hurry and execute them here.”

Zu An replied with a hint of bashfulness, “Your majesty, that might be a bit unsuitable, right? I still have some crimes on my name right now, you know?”

Zhao Han knew that he was talking about the matter of being the Fiend races’ Regent. As such, he said, “Don’t worry, this emperor will pardon you. Furthermore, you will have established great contributions. This emperor will consider making you a king. Then, those rotten scholars of the court will stop worrying about you colluding with the Fiend races.”

The human race was at its peak, and the Great Zhou Dynasty was flourishing. Life as a king on this side was naturally more comfortable than life on the Fiend races’ side. He believed that any normal person would think that way.

But this kid is actually threatening me in this kind of situation? Hateful!

You have successfully trolled Zhao Han for +100 +100 +100…

Just then, King Qi shouted, “Don’t believe him! The wishes of our deceased ancestors state that those who are not of the Zhao surname cannot be kings! He is just deceiving you!” He didn’t have any choice at present. If he let Zhao Han overturn the situation here, everything would really be completely over.

Zhao Han said with a sneer, “Rules are made by people. After establishing such contributions, why would he be denied the privilege of becoming a king?”

King Qi asked through clenched teeth, “Zu An, do you still remember what I said to you? I believe that you also know just how superficial Zhao Han’s words are. If he completely recovers, he will definitely settle things properly! Rather than gilding the lily, providing help in one’s hour of need is much better. If you help me ascend to the throne, I can definitely give you far more than Zhao Han! Apart from the status of a king, there is also the matter I talked with you about last time. I can give you Xiaodie. That way, we can be one family, and you won’t have to worry about betrayals!”

The four women, Yan, Yun, Qiu, and Xie, all looked at Zu An when they heard that. So this little bastard already had secret talks of marriage with King Qi Manor’s princess!Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Zu An felt a chill run down his back when he felt their murderous intent. He thought, Did this King Qi bastard lose his mind? How can you say something like that in front of all these people?!
