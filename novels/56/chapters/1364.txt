Chapter 1313: Fiend Race King Court

Yan Xuehen’s expression instantly changed. She had a guilty conscience and was worried that Zu An would tell the truth.

Yu Yanluo’s gaze also became a bit suspicious. She subconsciously thought of Zu An’s Primordial Origin Sutra. After all, that was how she had been treated back then. However, she thought, Sect Master Yan wouldn’t agree to that kind of method, would she?

Yun Jianyue’s thoughts didn’t wander in that direction. However, the look in her eyes still seemed lethal. It turned out that the main perpetrator behind Yan Xuehen’s bullying was this guy! When she remembered how he had seen her most private parts, her entire body felt uncomfortable.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +444 +444 +444…

Zu An jumped in fright when he saw the Rage points that followed. He quickly said, “What I meant was that I noticed several hot springs in the Great Snowy Mountain that were rich with ki. I brought her there and let her soak inside, and there really were miraculous effects!”

Yan Xuehen thought to herself, This guy doesn’t even bat an eyelid when telling lies. You were frozen stiff back then, and I was clearly the one who found that hot spring and took you there. Of course, she wouldn’t be so stupid as to correct him. That excuse was perfect for explaining her recovery.

Sure enough, when they heard about the earth immortal snow lady’s pursuit, both of the women’s expressions changed. When they heard that the two had not only managed to escape, but had even found a miraculous hot spring, they felt as if they really had taken a trip to death’s door and back.

“That hot spring really is miraculous. Even I want to soak inside if there’s a chance,” Yu Yanluo said with starry eyes.

“Count me in too,” Yun Jianyue added in an aloof manner.

Yan Xuehen felt a bit guilty. The hot spring did indeed have miraculous effects, but the actual treatment was still because of Zu An… If the two went to that hot spring, they would immediately suspect what Zu An had said.

Sigh, forget it. If push comes to shove, I just won’t stay around these two. Even if they’re suspicious, they can’t come to me for confirmation.

With a sigh of amazement, Yun Jianyue said, “No wonder the Great Snowy Mountain has always been a forbidden area all these years. It turns out there was actually such a powerful being inside!”

Yan Xuehen instinctively nodded, saying, “Indeed. Furthermore, in my opinion, that snow lady is probably not the only powerful being in the Great Snowy Mountain.”

Yun Jianyue subconsciously nodded.When she noticed that it was Yan Xuehen who had spoken, though, she harrumphed and looked away.

Zu An quickly joined in to mediate things, adding, “That’s why places like the Great Snowy Mountain are best avoided if possible. We only went around the borders, and yet we already ran into someone who was that frightening. If we really went deeper in, it would just mean certain death.”

The women both nodded in agreement and didn’t think about the hot springs in the Great Snowy Mountain anymore. Yan Xuehen sighed in relief. Afterward, Zu An told them about what had happened in Cloudcenter Commandery.

Yun Jianyue couldn't help but harrumph. “That damned emperor really can’t tell what’s good or bad for him. You worked so hard for him, and yet he ended up treating you like this. In my opinion, it’s not that bad of an idea to just leave the court. Just come to the Holy Sect, and I’ll make you a…” Halfway through her sentence, she suddenly remembered that Zu An had seen her most intimate parts. Her face reddened, and she couldn't finish speaking.

Yan Xuehen naturally knew why she would act like that, but Yu Yanluo was left in the dark. She felt that the others were all acting strange for some reason, as if they were keeping something from her. However, she was more concerned with something else. She said, “Ah Zu, what Sir Sang said is true. It’s too dangerous for you to stay in the fiend race territory. After all, you defeated the Golden Crow Crown Prince. No matter how generous the Fiend Emperor is, he wouldn’t let you go.”

Zu An said with a smile, “Don’t worry. I have a way of dealing with that.” Afterward, he took out a thin mask and continued, “Since I’ve been away for a few days, I’ll just change my face and name. The people here will just think that I’ve already returned to the human side. They won’t even know I’m here.”

Even though ‘Face of a Thousand Identities’ was much better, he would have to use the Kawaii Waifu Voice Changer each time before using it. That would be complete social suicide! The masks he had obtained from the Blackwind Stockade were still more convenient.

The women immediately felt a bit strange when they saw him become a completely different person, but they were still amazed by the masks.

“So what name are you planning to use?” Yu Yanluo asked curiously.

Zu An blurted out, “Yan Zu will work.”

That way, even if the three girls were used to calling him Ah Zu, it wouldn’t draw any suspicion. Furthermore, if that Fiend race spy made more reports to the human race, he could push all of the responsibility onto this Yan Zu. Then, he wouldn’t be suspected anymore.

“Yan Zu?” Yu Yanluo was touched. ‘Zu’ was obviously the same one as ‘Ah Zu’, but wouldn’t ‘Yan’ be the ‘Yan’ in her name? That name was wonderful.[1]

Yan Xuehen blushed and her heartbeat quickened. Why are you using my surname for your new name? Is this to hint at something, or to express something?[2] Ahhh! It’ll be bad if the other two notice something.

Yun Jianyue’s eyes narrowed. ‘Yan’ was a particle of the name ‘Chuyan’. If you use Chuyan’s name, what about our Honglei?

How could Zu An have predicted that a random name would spur on the three women’s crazy imaginations?

…

Afterward, Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen fought constantly against each other. Yu Yanluo and Zu An wanted to stop them at first, but eventually, they became numb, letting the grandmasters do what they wanted.

Zu An initially wanted to find a chance to have a good talk with Yan Xuehen. However, Yun Jianyue kept fighting against her, so he couldn't approach her at all. He could only give up on that thought. Instead, he began to study the ‘Lion’s Roar’ skill he had looted from Shi Ling, as well as the even more profound ‘One Drop of Heaven’s Essence’.

Just like that, time passed without them realizing it. Finally, they got close to the Fiend Race King Court. When he saw the majestic city on the horizon, Zu An said with a sigh of amazement, “And here I thought that the Fiend King Court would be some large tents gathered together. I didn’t expect it to be a place on par with our own capital city.”

Even though the details were a bit rough compared to the capital, that just gave the city a different kind of aesthetic. Furthermore, it made use of all sorts of beautiful colors, blending together a sense of grandeur and vigor.

Yan Xuehen said, “When the Fiend races were at their strongest, this was where they were ruled from. Now, even though it is a bit more worn-out than before, with their strength and appreciation for beauty, they still have the ability to rebuild such a great city.”

Yun Jianyue nodded and said, “If we put aside the grudges between our races, the fiend races indeed have many things we can learn from.”

Yu Yanluo was about to say something when her eyes narrowed. She said, “That group seems to be coming for us. Everyone, be careful.”

A group of mounted troops rushed over. However, they weren’t riding horses, but rather ferocious lions. The riders quickly stopped in front of Zu An’s party. The lions released low growls, while the giant lizards from the Snake race flicked their tongues. Their vertical pupils contained a dangerous glint.

“Where is the Medusa Queen?” the three riders at the front of the troop asked. They gave off an impressive aura. They had decent appearances too, but unfortunately, their voices were unkind.

“The Lion race!” the Snake race’s representatives exclaimed. They noticed that the riders had something in common, in the form of light brown beards all around their faces. That was the distinctive trait of the Lion Race. The more golden their beard, the greater the density of their bloodline was, which often indicated greater power. The three at the forefront had beards that were especially striking.

Outside the carriage, Maid Xing asked, “Why are you looking for our queen?”

One of the lions said with a snort, “I am looking for your queen. You do not have the right to speak to me.”

Zu An frowned and asked, “Are those from the Lion Race usually this arrogant?”

Yu Yanluo, worried that he would act out of anger, quickly said, “I’ll go out and take a look. Now that we’re at the Fiend Race King Court, it’s better to keep a low profile.”

She opened the door and walked out, declaring, “I am the Medusa Queen you are looking for. Why have you approached us?”

The riders in front looked arrogant and proud at first, but when they saw Yu Yanluo, they all seemed enamored. They looked at her face with eyes full of desire, and their eyes darted all over her body.

“I have heard of the Medusa Queen’s incredible beauty. Now that we have seen you ourselves, we know that your reputation was not in vain,” the one in the lead said with a sigh of admiration. “I am the Lion King’s third son Shi Min, while these are my fifth brother Shi Gong and seventh brother Shi Rong. We did not come with any ill intentions. We merely wish for the Medusa Queen to hand over the human who bullied our eighth brother.”Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The ones inside the carriage frowned. How did these men know that the one who had beaten up Shi Ling was Zu An?

1. The ‘Yan’ in ‘Yan Zu’ means ‘accomplished or ‘elegant’. It’s different from the ‘Yan’ in ‘Yanluo’, which means ‘smoke’ or ‘mist’. ☜

2. The ‘Yan’ surname is also different, meaning ‘swallow’ as in the bird. ☜
