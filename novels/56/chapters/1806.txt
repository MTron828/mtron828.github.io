Chapter 1755: Back to the Start

Mi Li laughed loudly, saying, “Tsk tsk tsk, who would have thought that you really would play around with the dead! Your tastes really are pretty extreme.”

When Zu An thought about how he had mysteriously ended up having such intimate contact with the female ghost, he nearly exploded from anger. What the hell is going on?!

He clearly knew he was in the ghost’s illusion, but didn’t it just feel way too real? He had ended up being too impatient to subdue the ghost, and rushed headlong into a mistake as a result. Meanwhile, the bride was covered in tears, looking at him with a hateful gaze.

“It seems this female ghost is actually quite pretty,” Mi Li said with a bit of surprise.

Zu An thought to himself that previously, Zhang Yong had told them that their young miss was famous for her beauty for miles and miles…

Uh… That’s not the most important part!

He turned around and looked at the groom who was tied to the table. It almost seemed as if blood would spill out of his eyes, and that he even wanted to bite Zu An.

Zu An silently observed his surroundings, but he didn’t receive any Rage points. As expected, it was all fake. However, as soon as he thought of that, he received a string of Rage points.

You have successfully trolled Jing Teng for +444 +444 +444…

He was completely stunned. Why was Jing Teng upset at him? Could it be because I agreed to escort her, and yet she was separated from me and ended up in danger?

He felt strange as he suddenly thought of something. Wait, this scene seems a bit familiar…

He recalled the contents of the play they had watched. Could they have been the ghost’s personal experiences? But isn’t that ghost giving up a bit too much here, if she’s going to personally play the part? Or could she be lusting after my body?

He looked at the mirror in the room and saw that he had already turned into an evil, tyrannical young master. Suddenly, a clamor broke out outside. The door was quickly smashed open as people entered, and the ones in the lead were none other than the Zhang clan’s master and madam, as well as the guards led by Zhang Yong. They were holding weapons while glowering at him.

“You beast!” the master and madam cried as they rushed at him, seemingly intending to tear him apart with their own hands.

Zu An quickly evaded. Such a situation really was frustrating. It clearly wasn’t what they were thinking, and yet he couldn't explain himself.

Zhang Yong roared and cursed as he and the other guards surrounded Zu An. From the looks of things, they planned to kill him right here. Zu An continued to evade while thinking of how to deal with the current situation.

Suddenly, a group of people rushed in. Their equipment was clearly superior, and their cultivation was higher than that of the guards. They quickly stopped the attack.

One of them guarded Zu An while quickly gesturing as if to suggest silencing the opponents, saying, “Young master, with how things are, we should strike first. Otherwise, if they report to the authorities, your life might be in danger too.”

Zu An now understood what was going on. No wonder the tyrannical young master had decided to do what he did. So it was to silence everyone involved! If he acted according to the script, he would be able to survive the trial and live in safety for many years.

However, in the play, the young master had ended up being tortured to death! But if he didn’t do what the young master had done before, judging from how things were about to develop, perhaps he would be tied up and executed by the authorities the next morning. Would it be better to drink the poison to quench his thirst, or to just let the drama play out? The ghost really was quite the schemer.

Zu An said indifferently, “But why do I have to choose one of these two?” He quickly used the Primordial Origin Sutra and began to chant, “Dust to dust, dirt to dirt. What should not remain here must go…”

Screams of misery and alarm filled the air. Both the tyrant’s personnel and the Zhang clan’s madam, master, and guards turned to dust, dissipating on the wind.

However, Zu An was soon stunned because even though the groom had disappeared, the bride hadn’t. Could it be that the ghost actually didn’t care about the Primordial Origin Sutra?

Zu An shivered. He thought about how Jing Teng had mentioned that these ghosts had all sorts of strange abilities, so he didn’t dare to show any carelessness. He rushed directly at her to immediately take her down.

However, the ghost seemed to have broken through some kind of restraint. She no longer looked weak and delicate, and she dashed backward. Then, her hair grew longer and longer, trying to surround him. If Zu An were to be wrapped in it, he would end up like prey caught in a spider’s web. At that point, he would only be able to wait for her to suck out his blood essence. Thus, he immediately used the phoenix’ flames to burn away the hair. Then, he took out the Tai’e Sword. The ghost was too strange; he couldn't give her any more opportunities.

The ghost was clearly shocked. She flew into the air and quickly made a hand seal, chanting, “The courageous join their men in battle…”

Zu An was stunned. He suddenly realized something and called out, “What you lookin’ at?”

“I’m looking at you, shithead!” the ghost replied, leaving her stunned. She had just been about to finish chanting, so why had she suddenly responded to what he said? The skill she had been about to manifest was ruined.

A sword filled with ancient power pressed against her neck. The terrifying pressure told her that if she did anything, she would immediately turn into ashes.

However, Zu An didn’t continue; instead, he called out, “Jing Teng?”

The ‘ghost’ was stunned. She hesitated for a moment before replying, “Zu An?”

As the two said each other’s names, the surrounding air distorted, and each of them saw the other’s true face. What female ghost? It was clearly just Jing Teng.

“It was you after all,” Zu An said, sighing in relief. He had already been a bit suspicious when he mysteriously received her Rage points. Later, when they fought against each other, he had felt as if her moves were really familiar.

Jing Teng had also been confused as to why the ghost she was fighting had phoenix flames. However, she had gotten really worked up over it and didn’t have time to think too deeply about it.

Both of them now understood clearly that the ghost had used an illusion to make them fight against each other. They once again sighed in amazement at how treacherous she was.

Zu An suddenly began, “Just now…”

Before he finished his sentence, Jing Teng interrupted him. “It’s just an illusion. Don’t think too much about it.” For some reason, a blush appeared on her face. At the same time, she felt really ashamed and humiliated.

You have successfully trolled Jing Teng for +110 +110 +110…

Zu An thought to himself, That female ghost really is something. She was actually able to make an illusion that looked so real!

The Tai’e Sword shook slightly. Mi Li’s amused laughter filled Zu An’s mind.

Zu An was about to ask her something when he suddenly thought of something. Oh no! What about Honglei? He quickly looked around for Honglei, worried that she could have encountered danger.

As soon as he took a few steps, however, he suddenly realized something and grabbed Jing Teng. Jing Teng pulled her hand back as if she had been shocked by electricity, exclaiming, “Don’t touch me!”

Zu An was stunned. He explained, “It’s just because I’m afraid that the same thing will happen again and we’ll be separated by an illusion.” Previously, he had gotten separated from the others just by getting onto the stage. He didn’t want to go through that again.

Jing Teng frowned. She had really lost a lot this time because of that scheme. She also didn’t want to go through that again. As such, a vine wrapped around Zu An’s hand and she said, “This should be good enough.”

Zu An didn’t mind that either. He quickly looked around the manor with her. Fortunately, the purification skill’s effects had spread, and the gray mist had become less dense. They found Qiu Honglei soon after. She was trapped in a room with thick yin energy all around her. They could sense that there seemed to be a hidden formation inside, causing the yin energy to gather densely. However, her entire body was shining, resisting the yin energy. From the looks of it, neither side could take out the other.

Zu An immediately used the Primordial Origin Sutra to dispel the yin energy. When she saw Zu An, Qiu Honglei broke out into a huge smile and cried, “Ah Zu!

“All of you suddenly disappeared. I looked everywhere for you, but I ended up being accidentally trapped here…” she continued, but midway through her sentence, she saw that Zu An and Jing Teng were linked by a vine. A strange expression appeared on her face as she asked, “How did you two end up together?”

“Just now, we…” Zu An began when Jing Teng suddenly interrupted him with a light cough.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jing Teng said, “I think we should go and look for that Wei person. His cultivation is the lowest, so he might be in danger.”

Zu An nodded. He didn’t have the luxury to talk anymore, so he quickly looked around the manor again. Eventually, he found Wei Suo in a small river that passed through the manor. He was shut in a narrow basket and entirely bound up in water plants. His stomach was round and bulging, and his eyes were wide open. He had an expression that seemed to convey unresolved grievances.

Zu An’s heart sank because Wei Suo wasn’t breathing at all. He was dead. He had never expected his old friend to meet such an end. He fell silent.

After a long time passed, he squatted down and gently closed Wei Suo’s eyes, saying, “I’ll definitely get revenge for you!”

Even though the ghost’s story was pitiful, she was ruthless and cruel. She had to pay the price for this.

Suddenly, the group heard intense coughing. Under their shocked expressions, Wei Suo sat back up and asked, “What revenge?”

“Are you a human or a ghost?” Qiu Honglei called out, maintaining her guard.

“A human, of course,” Wei Suo said after vomiting up all of the water he had drunk. “Thank goodness my Turtle Breath Technique fooled that ghost. Otherwise, I would have been dead for sure.”

“Just what is going on?” Zu An asked in confusion.

Wei Suo explained what he had experienced previously. It turned out he had taken on the role of the drama’s miserable groom. Then, everything had continued just as it was supposed to, and he was locked up. Fortunately, he had the Turtle Breath Technique, which saved his life.

He couldn't help but curse, “Just what the hell did I do to deserve this? I had to watch as my wife was raped by another man! Ahhhh! I’m going to end up with some serious trauma from this…”

While he was stomping his foot in anger, Zu An and Jing Teng couldn't help but exchange a look. Then, they both separated as if they had been zapped. Even though what they had experienced was a different setting, and Wei Suo wasn’t the same groom, they still couldn't help but feel a bit guilty.

Zu An coughed lightly and said, “Since the four of us have already reunited, let’s not separate again. We’ll attack the source of the problem and capture that ghost!”

“Good. I’ve been messed with so badly that I have to see her pay a devastating price!” Jing Teng said through clenched teeth.

When he saw the hatred in her expression, Wei Suo shivered. How could you have suffered more than me, though?

…

While they were eager to take down their foe, suddenly, the light distorted all around them. When they woke up, they saw that they were sitting in front of the stage again, and a new play was about to begin.

Everything had reset back to the start!
