Chapter 1558: Frank and Open

“What? Zhao Han suspects us?” the empress asked, feeling a chill run down her neck. Her heart was beating so hard that she could almost hear it.

Zu An thought to himself, Why are you still bothering me if you’re so scared, to the point that I can’t even refuse you? However, on the surface, he said, “I don’t know the exact details either. It’s just that I received information telling me to be careful. Furthermore, I discovered that Eunuch Wen was secretly investigating me.”

He spoke vaguely on purpose. Otherwise, if the empress found out that Eunuch Wen was actually tailing him to check on him and the Crown Princess, the empress would think that he was lying to her.

The empress’ expression darkened. She called out, “Little Lu!”

“Yes!” Eunuch Lu replied, hurrying back like a gust of wind. There was a hint of excitement on his face. Could it be that her highness pitied my loyalty and is willing to let me watch from the side?! However, he was soon disappointed; when he entered, he saw that the two were still fully clothed.

The empress was too preoccupied to figure out what he was thinking; instead, she quickly told him what she had heard.

Eunuch Lu was shocked. If something like this were exposed, it would be hard to say what would happen to them, but for someone like him who was deeply involved, it would absolutely amount to nine generations of execution! Even though he was a eunuch, so he couldn't have any descendents, he still had an older brother. The Lu clan in the capital had become a large clan too.

“Go and look into this matter. Make sure not to alert anyone with your investigation,” the empress warned him.

“This servant understands,” Eunuch Lu said, feeling deeply worried as he left. This was related to the rest of his life! He had to make sure it wasn’t ruined because of such a thing.

…

After Eunuch Lu left, the empress gradually calmed down. 

Zu An said, “Don’t worry. If the emperor had really noticed anything, there’s no way we could even have a chat here.” Inwardly, he thought, As expected of Zhao Han’s woman. Such a level of bravery definitely wasn’t something an ordinary woman could compare to.

“Little boy, you gave me quite the fright,” the empress said, laughing and patting the seat next to her. “Come and have a seat over here; are you scared that I’ll bite?”

Zu An’s expression was strange as he thought, Isn’t that exactly what I’m scared of? He replied, “Your highness, this situation hasn’t calmed down yet. It would be better if we stay a bit more low-profile.”

“What are you scared of? If he had some real proof, we wouldn’t even be able to keep living. Seeing as we’re still alive, that means he hasn’t found anything. In that case, why don’t we enjoy the present?” the empress replied charmingly as she moved closer.

Zu An had to admit that mature beauties were soft and supple. This woman really is dancing around the grave! She already knows the Emperor is investigating her, and yet she still isn’t holding back at all?

Because the empress had moved closer, the strong fragrance she wore had begun surrounding Zu An. It made the dead of winter suddenly feel a bit hot.

Zu An felt his mouth become a bit dry. When he remembered Bi Linglong’s concern, he sat upright and still, wanting to push her away. However, his hand seemed to have entered a large ball of cotton. He remarked awkwardly, “Would you believe me if I said this wasn’t on purpose?”

The empress let out a lovely laugh, saying, “Of course I believe you. If you wanted to, you could just do what you wanted, and I’d be welcoming you. Why would you use such a clumsy method?”

Zu An coughed and said, “Your highness, I just came from the Imperial Study and don’t know when his majesty will be looking for me. I have to head over first.”

“Didn’t you hate him quite a bit? Why does it now seem as if you’re so scared of him?” the empress asked, gently stroking his chin. Her expression was hard to read.

Zu An was shocked. His attitude toward the emperor was the greatest of secrets. How did she know?

Seemingly seeing through his confusion, the empress gave him a flirtatious look. Then, she giggled and said, “You used so much force that night, almost as if you were taking it out on your enemy’s wife. Did you think I wouldn’t notice that?”

Zu An felt a flame ignite inside him when he heard this. However, his reason was still in control. He forcefully suppressed it and said, “Your highness must  be joking. I really must go now.”

The empress sighed deeply and said, “You call me ‘Ning’er’ when you feel good, but you call me ‘your highness’ when you don’t. My heart is starting to grow cold.”

Zu An was briefly speechless. This woman had suddenly played the ‘deep feelings’ card, so he didn’t even know what to do anymore.

The empress put away her frivolous smile and asked, “Do you see me as an unfaithful wife, and thus look down on me?”

Zu An quickly said, “That’s definitely not what I meant! It’s just that the current situation is tense…”

Both he and the empress were mature adults. The first time had been quite stimulating, but the risk was just too great. Any rational person wouldn’t take such a huge risk. After all, he still had too many people he cared about.

The empress’ smooth hand pressed against Zu An’s lips as she replied, “There’s no need for you to make so many excuses. I already took the initiative to seek you out several times. You definitely look down on me. However, do you know why I keep impatiently seeking you out? Do you really think I’ve just felt neglected and can’t hold it in anymore?”

Zu An didn’t know what to say in response and could only remain silent.

The empress then said, “In my earlier years, my cultivation was quite high. Furthermore, my big sister was still in this world; her cultivation was also great. But perhaps it was precisely that which drew Zhao Han’s suspicion. He silently allowed something to happen, which caused my big sister to die an untimely death, and I was left with dao injuries that couldn’t be healed. My cultivation was thus lost, and I became an ordinary person. How could I not feel hatred inside? That joyous night we spent together wasn’t only to get revenge on that man, but also to borrow your help in restoring my cultivation.”

“Restore your cultivation?” Zu An repeated, surprised by her frankness.

The empress gave him a look and said, “Judging from your expression, you already have some idea, right? After that night, I discovered that my dao injuries actually showed signs of healing. For the sake of recovery, I looked through every possible channel, and yet I was completely helpless. And yet, a single night with you was better than so many years of my efforts. That meant there could only be one possibility; that you have the legendary transcendent aptitude. Your blood essence is an unrivaled divine medicine in itself.”

Zu An had a strange expression. He really had become Xuanzang[1] now… If news of this got out, wouldn’t he be sucked dry by countless vixens along the way?

He also put away the feigned politeness he had shown in the beginning, almost returning to his previous identity as the Fiend races’ Regent. He said, “Seeing as your highness has spoken so plainly, there’s no harm in me being more direct as well. Our interaction is indeed beneficial for you, but there are only endless dangers for me. Why should I take such a huge risk?”

The empress laughed. The fact that Zu An had changed his tone meant that their relationship had now taken a step further. She replied, “Didn’t you say that Zhao Han already suspected us? We’re already grasshoppers on the same rope. If you help me recover quickly, I can help you keep Zhao Han in check. Furthermore, I am still the empress. I can provide you with even more benefits in the future.”

Zu An frowned slightly and said, “Zhao Han is an earth immortal. Even if you recover, how much can your cultivation help?”

“That’s hard to say,” the empress said mysteriously before continuing, “However, there are still other benefits.”

Zu An was stunned, asking, “What benefits? What are you doing? Ah…”

The empress moved her head slightly, brushing her messy hair behind her ears. A glossy luster flickered on her lips. She said with a proud smile, “You said you didn’t want it, but your body is quite honest.”

Zu An was speechless. The empress moved over to his ear and whispered, “With Zhao Han’s nature, he won’t tolerate your existence. You can vent all of the frustrations you have with him on his wife. Isn’t that enough?”

Zu An thought, You always use this move. Do you think I’ll fall for it?

Ah, Little An, how can you be such a disappointment?!

…

Meanwhile, in the Eastern Palace, Bi Linglong looked at her maid Rong Mo in pleasant surprise. She asked, “Really? Sir Zu entered the palace again?”

Didn’t that mean they had another chance to meet again?

The emperor wasn’t in seclusion, so the two of them couldn't meet as they wished, and the number of times Zu An could enter the palace was limited. The two were like separated lovers. Being able to meet again was always a good thing.

“It’s a hundred percent true!” Rong Mo reported to Bi Linglong with a big smile. “But he seems to have been summoned by Eunuch Lu, the empress’ subordinate, and didn’t come to the Eastern Palace. Hmph, this Sir Zu really is something. He’s already forgotten who he belongs to.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Bi Linglong glowered. Then, she got up and said, “Oh, now that you mention it, she’s already returned to the palace, and yet I haven’t paid her a visit yet.”
