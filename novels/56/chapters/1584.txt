Chapter 1533: Wedding

“Princess,” Zu An said, nodding in greeting. He had to admit that he had a good impression of Princess Suolun. When they were exploring together, she had been willing to stand by his side many times. Besides, she was also pretty.

In the end, Princess Suolun didn’t throw herself into his arms; perhaps it was due to her reservations as a young lady, or it was just because she had noticed that there were others present.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Big sis Shang, you were here too,” Princess Suolun said, blushing with shame. Doesn’t this mean she saw how I was behaving in front of big brother Zu?

Shang Liuyu voiced her agreement. Then, she gestured toward Zu An, saying, “Clouds gather yet unfold’ karma rises and disperses. All of these are merely transformations of the world, and yet a flash in the grand scheme of things. I’m sure we’ll meet again some day.” She left immediately afterward.

Zu An couldn't help but sigh in amazement. Ever since the first time he had met Shang Liuyu, he had always taken notice of her free and confident air. She had an extremely unique charm.

Now that his little aunt had left, Chi Wen could only follow. However, when he passed Princess Suolun, he couldn't help but call out, “Princess~”

The princess really smells good… I wonder if it’s because she just took a bath or if she wore something else… Or maybe it’s the makeup.

Princess Suolun exclaimed in surprise “Huh? You were here too?”

Chi Wen almost vomited blood on the spot. I’ve poured out so much of myself to you, and yet you didn’t even see me?

However, when he saw her beautiful appearance, he still suppressed his displeasure and tried to flatter her.

Princess Suolun replied to him nonchalantly. She didn’t slip up on any of the usual courtesies, but she couldn't hold back her indifference and estrangement.

Chi Wen could only console himself by thinking that this woman’s personality was just a bit cold. That was what everyone else had said when he asked around before, and when he went to the Demon races’ temporary official residence, it was indeed that way. She clearly treated everyone like that. As such, he tried to act elegant as he said goodbye to Princess Suolun. Then, he followed his little aunt out.

When he reached the door, however, he heard a burst of lovable laughter. He couldn't help but turn around. What he saw was that Princess Suolun didn’t have her usual high and noble appearance at all, and instead had a huge smile on her face. She took the initiative to enthusiastically chat with Zu An about something, and her body rocked back and forth with laughter.

In that instant, Chi Wen felt as if he had heard something shatter. He thought, I shouldn’t be here. I should have moved a bit faster. If I had left through the door, I wouldn’t have had to see such a heartbreaking scene…

Meanwhile, Princess Suolun was enthusiastically inviting Zu An to visit the Demon race’s territory whenever he had a chance. Zu An naturally agreed. Who wouldn’t like such a trip done at public expense? He could enjoy some different scenery then!

Of course, he definitely didn’t have time at the moment. He had to return to the human side. His heart began to sink when he thought about that side’s affairs.

…

After Zu An saw Princess Suolun out, he received a few more representatives from the various races. Eventually, however, he got some time to himself. He decided to jump over the courtyard wall and go for a stroll around the outside perimeter.

Sigh, the common people all want to become the emperor, but being the emperor is so tiring! I’m only a Regent, and yet I won’t even be able to take it anymore at this rate.

Suddenly, a melodious laugh that resembled a silver bell rang out. Someone called out, “Big brother Zu, where were you planning to go now?”

A young lady dressed in green appeared. She was petite and lithe, and her hair was tied up in pretty pigtails. A natural and fresh aura emanated from her entire body.

“I came here to find my Snow, of course,” Zu An said. His mood also became much better when he saw her.

“Tsk, there’s not even an ounce of sincerity coming from your voice. You didn’t look for me once these past few days,” Qiao Xueying said with a pout; she was clearly a bit unhappy. She had previously been dragged back to the Elf King Manor by her father to learn how to handle various political affairs. All this time, she had been hoping that Zu An would look for her, and yet he had never arrived. Finally, she couldn't focus on her work anymore, and left to look for him.

“I was really busy too! I finally found some time to run over here,” Zu An said, gesturing toward the endless stream of guests who were lined up outside his door.

“You don’t need to personally visit those smaller clans at all. Just send some random subordinates to deal with them,” Qiao Xueying said, hugging his arm. “Let’s go! I’ll show you around the Fiend King Court. This place is completely different from Brightmoon City!”

Because of her relationship with the Crown Princess, they had never been able to show themselves publicly together. Now, they didn’t need to have such misgivings anymore. She felt that the sky was bluer than ever before, and that the sun was brighter and warmer.

“That sounds great!” Zu An replied. He had already been in the Fiend King Court for quite some time, but he had always been busy with different things, so he’d never had a chance to look around at all.

Qiao Xueying had a huge smile when she saw him agree. She hugged his arm just like that as they strolled through the Fiend King Court.

However, she suddenly wrinkled her nose after they walked a few steps. She moved her head closer and gave his clothes a sniff, remarking, “What a strong fragrance. Were you with other women just now?”

Zu An was speechless. He replied, “You’re from the Elf race, not the Dog race, so why is your nose so sharp? I was with a few women. The Ocean races’ Mermaid Princess and the Demon race’s Princess Suolun… But that was all proper business. It’s not what you’re thinking.”

“Hmph, you’re the one with the dog nose.” Qiao Xueying harrumphed. “I hadn’t expected Miss Shang to be the Mermaid Princess… but that Princess Suolun definitely harbors bad thoughts toward you.”

She didn’t suspect Shang Liuyu, who had a special status, and they had previously interacted back at Brightmoon Academy. But Princess Suolun was different.

“No way, no way. She only came for proper business,” Zu An said.

“Proper business? Have you seen how her eyes look like slits when she looks at you?” Qiao Xueying shot back. However, When she saw that Zu An didn’t reply, she felt a bit guilty. “What? Do you think I’m being a bit annoying right now?”

Zu An couldn't help but laugh, saying, “Not at all. I just remembered that you were just like this when I first met you back in Brightmoon City.”

“It’s your fault for being so annoying back then,” Qiao Xueying replied, blushing with embarrassment when she remembered what had happened in the past. “Right, back then, you said my boyfriend would definitely have uremia. What does that mean?”

Zu An staggered. He hadn’t expected a joke he made back then to end up biting him in the ass. He replied, “It’s nothing, haha. Pah pah pah, children’s words carry no harm!”

He just happened to see some tanghulu being sold on the side of the street, so he bought some for her.

“I don’t even like tanghulu! I like melon seeds,” Qiao Xueying said. Despite that, she still licked the tanghulu with her little tongue. “I didn’t expect the Fiend King Court to have tanghulu that tastes so good, though.”

Her face suddenly turned red as she licked it. She hit Zu An lightly with her fists, exclaiming, “You scoundrel, I know what that uremia you were talking about meant!”

Zu An became depressed. Wasn’t buying tanghulu for her basically giving her hints? No wonder they said married women weren’t as innocent as little girls anymore…

After the two of them play-fought for a while, Qiao Xueying explained the surrounding environments to him, as well as introducing several famous spots. Every single place was related to the glorious history of a powerful figure in the Fiend races. Everything was very interesting.

When he felt the warm and soft sensation next to him, Zu An thought, Even flat washboards have their pros. He couldn't help but feel gentle when he heard the excitement and high spirits in Qiao Xueying’s voice. He said, “Snow, I have a gift for you.”

“Do we need to be so formal to each other?” Qiao Xueying replied. Despite that, the eagerness in her eyes was obvious.

Zu An held her hand, then placed a ring on her slender finger.

“This ring looks so ugly,” Qiao Xueying said. Despite sounding as if she looked down on it, however, her expression was full of joy. There was one similarity between this world and Zu An’s previous one, which was that rings weren’t randomly given out. They often represented love or marriage.

“This isn’t a normal ring; it’s called the Universe Ring. It can change in size, and it can also serve as a defensive artifact for you…” Zu An explained the Universe Ring’s functions and use to her. He didn’t need this kind of treasure anymore, but it was really useful for Snow.

“Big brother Zu, you’re so good to me!” Qiao Xueying exclaimed. She naturally knew the value of a heaven-grade weapon. She couldn't hold back her feelings and jumped into Zu An’s arms. She got up onto her toes and kissed him.

While the two of them were flirting with each other, someone suddenly coughed lightly and remarked, “Ahem, did I come at a bad time?”

“Ah, dad!” Qiao Xueying exclaimed, suddenly looking like a frightened rabbit. She quickly ran off to one side to hide herself, covering her face in embarrassment.

Zu An was also a bit embarrassed when he saw the outstanding Great Elf King. He said, “Greetings, respected uncle.”

“You already stole my daughter, but you still have the nerve to call me uncle?” the Great Elf King harrumphed in dissatisfaction. “There’s quite a bit of gossip going around surrounding Snow. Seeing as we’ve bumped into each other today, let’s set the marriage day. You’re the Regent now, so you shouldn’t have so many misgivings. Let's decide on a date and get this marriage over with.”

“Huh?” Zu An exclaimed, stunned.
