Chapter 1742: We Can Have Some Fun

“Your majesty! What a coincidence…” Xuan Bajing said with a smile that was even uglier than crying.

Li Changsheng no longer had his usual free and confident appearance. His expression was as dark as charcoal.

“Indeed, it is quite the coincidence,” Zhao Han said, looking at the two of them with a big smile. “I hadn’t expected to encounter the two of you here. To be honest, your previous scheme wasn’t half bad.”

Xuan Bajing started sweating buckets. He quickly begged for mercy. “Your majesty, please forgive me! I was forced to do all of that by King Qi and had no choice, so I ended up offending your majesty. I hope that your majesty can be magnanimous and forgive me!”

Li Changsheng thought disdainfully, This guy’s tail wagging really is nauseating.

He sorted out his clothes before saying to Zhao Han, “Your majesty, your respected self needs some manpower to deal with any trivial matters in this secret dungeon. Please give us a chance to atone for our crimes.”

Xuan Bajing was stupefied. Judging from the proud look on that guy’s face, I thought he was going to show some unyielding nature. And yet in the end, it was just this?

Zhao Han frowned and said, “You just used a great scheme against this emperor, and yet you are wagging your tails and begging for mercy. How can this emperor trust people such as you?”

Li Changsheng said, “If your majesty does not believe us, we can simply make a vow!”

Even though the consequences would be severe, being alive was better than being dead.

Xuan Bajing thought, This guy is actually going that far? However, he didn’t have time to think too deeply about it and immediately nodded, saying, “That’s right; I am also willing to make a vow to the world and swear my loyalty to your majesty!”

Zhao Han briefly fell silent. A vow to the world wasn’t something to be taken lightly, and these were even members of the daoist sects. The restrictions of a vow in that scenario would be even stronger.

However, he wasn’t moved and said indifferently, “You two are severely injured right now and are only slightly better than cripples. What help can you even offer this emperor?”

His tone became more and more intimidating as he spoke. He was really pissed off from all the things that had happened today. In all these years, this was the first time he had ever been left in such a sorry state. It was all because of these damn ants. When he thought of that, his gaze filled with killing intent.

Xuan Bajing felt as if he had been targeted by a primal beast. He knew that he likely only had a few more seconds of life left. His mind moved quickly and he said, “Even though your majesty’s power is boundless, we know nothing about this world. We can help you explore this world, and we can just serve as a meat shield for any special mechanisms.”

Li Changsheng was stupefied. He thought, This guy really is shameless! A glorious grandmaster is actually going to fall to such an extent? However, with their lives at stake, he could only speak up in agreement. Meanwhile, Xuan Bajing also cursed him inwardly.

Zhao Han was now a bit tempted. After all, what they were saying did make sense. The reason he was so powerful now was due in no small part to the secret dungeons he had encountered in the past. He knew about the special mechanisms of secret dungeons and how they needed the cooperation of many people to activate. If he encountered such things again, trying to solve them by himself would be a bit difficult.

His expression eased a bit when he thought of that, and he said, “I suppose. Out of consideration for your sincerity, this emperor will forgive you two here. Make your vows, then.” He naturally wouldn’t just trust their words; he had to have something to keep them in check.

Xuan Bajing and Li Changsheng exchanged a look. They saw the helplessness in each other’s eyes. However, since the situation was already like this, they had no choice. As such, they both made vows. Soon after, there was a reaction in the world. Some wisps of profound laws tangled around the two of them.

Zhao Han listened to their vows carefully. He nodded in satisfaction when he saw that they didn’t try to pull any tricks.

Xuan Bajing and Li Changsheng sighed in relief. Then, they carefully said, “Your majesty, you were the first to wake up. Did you notice anything about this world?”

“I have not,” Zhao Han slowly replied. “The only thing I have noticed is that this world seems to be especially sinister. It might very well be related to deathly spirits.”

He had actually made another discovery. When he first arrived in this world, he had sent out his primordial spirit to look around and understand a bit about it. However, as soon as his primordial spirit left, he sensed danger, as if there were something in this world that could threaten his primordial spirit.

Such a thing was inconceivable for Zhao Han. Previously, he probably wouldn’t have cared much, and would have explored a bit first. After all, he had remained invincible for so many years, so he hadn’t believed that anything could harm him. However, after what had happened today, and the way he had almost died because of King Qi and the libationer’s schemes, he couldn't help but become a bit more prudent.

“Deathly spirits?” Xuan Bajing and Li Changsheng repeated, stunned. Then, they secretly felt joy, because they were daoist experts. They naturally knew things that could counter deathly spirits and the like. Deathly spirits usually lacked consciousness, so even if they were strong, they were still on the easier side to deal with.

Xuan Bajing and Li Changsheng both took out pills and ate them. Their complexions immediately became a bit rosier as their injuries clearly improved a bit.

The two of them suddenly realized something, though. Their faces turned deathly pale and they cried, “This subordinate deserves death; we should have immediately offered our treatment medicines to your majesty!”

Both of them felt a bit strange after saying that. Why were they saying the same thing? Normally, they were always the ones who received praise from their sects, and yet now that they were bootlicking someone else, it actually came so naturally. They thought, Sigh, it's only because the pressure Zhao Han gives off is just too much.

Zhao Han replied, indifferently, “Why would this emperor need your pills? Just eat them yourselves and recover sooner. I do not want to keep useless people at my side.”

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing were frightened, but they also felt some admiration. Zhao Han had first fought against King Qi, and then the libationer, and yet he still appeared to be fine. They couldn't even see a single injury. It really was incredible.

Thus, both of them focused on recovering. Their statuses in their respective sects were formidable, so the pills they carried were naturally also extraordinary. As the medicinal strength spread out, they gradually recovered a bit of strength.

They were about to say something when they noticed two people lying nearby. They exclaimed in alarm, “Who are they?”

They seemed to be inside an abandoned ancestral hall. Because of the pressure from Zhao Han, they hadn’t dared to show the slightest bit of distraction. Only now did they discover that there were actually two people lying there.

Zhao Han replied indifferently, “How would I know?” When he woke up, these two had already been lying there. From the looks of it, they were cultivators too.

Li Changshen and Xuan Bajing exchanged a look. They both chose a target to examine and then moved to wake them up.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Who… Who are you?” the two asked after gradually coming to. When they saw the scene in front of them, they were startled. They were actually well-known experts too, but these three who had suddenly shown up were ridiculously powerful. The yellow-robed one in particular… Wait, yellow robes?

“Your majesty?” the two exclaimed, scared out of their minds. However, Zhao Han didn’t confirm or deny it.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing asked about the other two’s identities and quickly learned that they were cultivators from the Great Zhou Dynasty. They had been exploring a secret dungeon and were about to succeed when they ended up being sucked into this world somehow. Their cultivation ranks weren’t that low, and they were both around the eighth rank. Of course, in front of these three, they could only shiver like quails.

Zhao Han had an amused expression. Normally, with the libationer and Yan Xiangu’s skill in formations, the trap they had prepared for so many years shouldn’t have encountered any problems. However, something had happened. Not only had they been sent here, it also seemed to have sucked in people from other secret dungeons too.

Just what is the reason for this?

Suddenly, sinister cackles filled the air, and a voice said, “Heh heh, everyone seems to have arrived. That means we can begin!”

Zhao Han’s expression changed. He stared in a certain direction. He actually hadn’t been able to detect this thing’s approach despite his cultivation! How was that possible?!

A lion-bodied monster with a woman’s face suddenly appeared at the entrance. It looked around and nodded, saying, “Not bad. Now, we can have some fun together.”

Zhao Han snorted. He didn’t say anything and reached out with a great golden hand that instantly engulfed the monster.

Poof!

The monster scattered into a black mist. A second later, however, more black fog condensed and it reappeared.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing’s eyes widened. The invincible Zhao Han’s attack had actually missed? Just where did this monster come from?!

Zhao Han also frowned. He was someone who had comprehended the power of space. Just now, even if the creature dodged, it shouldn’t have been able to avoid his grasp, and yet it had. That could only mean it wasn’t in this world! His spatial abilities were only effective in the same world. At least for the time being, he couldn't move between different worlds.
