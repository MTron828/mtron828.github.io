Chapter 806, Part 2: Clamoring

Translator: Pika

The crown prince, who had just been watching everything from the side, jumped in fright. He was clearly reminded of the fear Bi Linglong had instilled in him over the past two years.

The other clans’ young masters became unhappy. They could clearly sense the crown princess’ rage, but they didn’t know how they had offended her. They thought, Don’t tell me it’s all because of that Zu An?

When she saw the others’ expressions, Bi Linglong realized that she had lost her composure. She quickly said, “They’ve already begun to test people’s cultivations over there, so let’s hurry and head over.”

The emperor’s and King Qi’s factions had reached a tacit agreement. They would allow the crown prince to bring in people with him, but their cultivation ranks couldn't exceed the seventh rank. For the sake of preventing fraud, there was a ki measuring instrument at the entrance, as opposed to having any one person judge people’s cultivation rank.

The device was a result of the Royal Academy’s research, consisting of a piece of celestial stone paired with complex and intricate formations. It could quickly test a person’s ki strength, and thus deduce their cultivation level.

The other warriors had already completed their tests. They were all around the fourth or fifth rank. Only their group was left for this test. There was obviously no need to test the crown prince. Everyone knew what he was like, so there was no point in embarrassing him.

Then, the crown princess walked over. Bi Linglong stepped onto the stage and looked around, but she still didn’t see that person. She sighed, and then walked forward. Next to the celestial stone stood a young lady in a witch’s hat and dark blue starry robes. She yawned and said, “Put your hand on it, and then just use your ki.”

The group of young masters’ eyes lit up. Liu Xian couldn't help but catcall. “Who is this little girl? She’s pretty cute.”

Pei You said coldly, “I advise you to restrain those random thoughts of yours. She’s the libationer’s last disciple Qi Yaoguang, the junior sister the teachers of the rear mountain adore the most. She isn’t someone you can afford to offend.”

Liu Xian flipped his hair, and then a charming smile appeared on his face as he said, “Even if those senior brothers dote on her, they can’t stop her from courting love, right? If we really do express sincere love, not even the libationer should be able to stop us.”

Pei You was speechless. Those gathered looked at Liu Xian with strange expressions. This fellow really had some crazy confidence. Next to him, his cousin Gao Ying’s face twitched. He quietly took a few steps away, as if he didn’t know Liu Xian.

The test taking place on the stage was already complete. Light was released from the celestial stone as Qi Yaoguang exclaimed, “Sixth rank!”

Those gathered immediately began to whisper among themselves. The crown princess had only been at the fifth rank not too long ago, yet now, she had already reached the sixth rank. Her cultivation talent was quite exceptional!

Many people glanced toward the simple-minded crown prince and shook their heads inwardly. The difference was just too huge! It really was like a flower growing out of a pile of manure.

When the crown princess descended, the others all glanced around in embarrassment. After all, they were all much older than her, so it was normal for their cultivation levels to be higher. However, with their difference in age, that small gap in cultivation made them all feel ashamed.

Liu Xian was the first to say, “I’ll head up first!” He had always been rather shameless, known as the capital’s publicly acknowledged playboy. He didn’t mind being laughed at by others.

He didn’t immediately place his hand on the device to get measured, and instead walked in front of Qi Yaoguang with a smile first. “Little sister Qi, hello. My name is Liu Xian, and my father is a general of the court.”

“Oh, I know that.” Qi Yaoguang subconsciously leaned back. What is such a mature man using makeup for?

Liu Xian was overjoyed, saying, “So little sister Qi knew about me.”

“Only just now, through divination.” Qi Yaoguang yawned.

“Huh?” Liu Xian was stupefied.

Qi Yaoguang harrumphed. “I also divined that you wanted to pick me up. Hmph, you’re coming after me when you don’t even know what I do; you really are ignorant and senseless. Are you going to take the test or not? Otherwise, go back down and stop holding up the line.” She muttered to herself, “I sensed that I would have some romantic luck, but it ended up being with such a slimy guy. What kind of romantic luck is that? Hmph.”

Liu Xian was momentarily dazed, but he reacted quickly as well. “Little sister Qi’s nature really is straightforward and unruly. I like that a lot.”

He placed his hand on the celestial stone while speaking. He thought to himself that once he came out of the dungeon, he was going to try to hook up with her. This wasn’t the first time he had encountered a little hot pepper like her, yet hadn’t they still ended up moaning under him?

The celestial stone produced a faint layer of light. Qi Yaoguang gave it a look. “Fifth rank? Even many of my students are higher rank than you. Have you lived your entire life so far like a dog or something?”

Liu Xian finally couldn't take it anymore. However, this was the Royal Academy, so he couldn't start anything. He could only leave the stage with an ashen expression.

Underneath the stage, Bi Linglong held back an urge to laugh. She was more familiar with these academy teachers. She knew that Qi Yaoguang was famous for her low emotional intelligence, yet this Liu Xian had actually dared to try to court her. He really wasn’t the brightest.

Then, the other disciples headed up one after another. After learning from Liu Xian’s experience, none of them dared to speak rudely to Qi Yaoguang.

The results quickly came out. Liang King Manor’s Zhao Xi and the Liu clan’s Gao Ying’s cultivations were the highest, both at the peak of the sixth rank. The others were either at the middle or initial stage of the sixth rank. The others began to congratulate Zhao Xi and Gao Ying. Gao Ying was a bit calmer, while Zhao Xi couldn't help but feel proud.

The Gu clan brothers used the opportunity to say, “With the young king and brother Gao here, we’re sure that success is already guaranteed. Why do we need that Zu An or whatever? Crown princess, you don’t need to be worried at all.”

Bi Linglong felt sad inside. She wondered why Zu An hadn’t come. On one hand, she was worried that something had happened to him, yet on the other hand, if nothing happened and he had just gone back on his word, that meant he didn’t care about her at all. When she recalled how Zu An had said to trust him, how she had been moved back then, all of it seemed extremely laughable now.

Suddenly, a familiar voice said, “Sorry, sorry, I’m late.”

Bi Linglong turned around with surprise and happiness. She finally saw that figure she had waited so many hours for. At that moment, she wanted to smile, yet she also wanted to cry. However, she quickly caught herself, because in the end, she was the crown princess. She quickly composed herself and asked, “Why did you only come now?”

You have successfully trolled Bi Linglong for +55 +55 +55…

“There were some things that held me up, sorry,” Zu An said apologetically.

Meng Pan asked with a snicker, “What can possibly be more important than the crown prince’s exam?”

Gu Xing felt refreshed inwardly. Finally, he didn’t have to step in himself.

Zu An replied, “It’s precisely because the crown prince’s exam is important that I’ll explain the exact situation to the crown princess later.” There were many people from King Qi’s faction here. He didn’t want to expose Jiang Luofu, so he could only give that vague explanation.

Qi Yaoguang spoke from the stage. “Mister Zu, are you going to test yourself or not?!”

Bi Linglong said, “You should get tested first. Everyone who’s going to enter the dungeon needs to be tested.”

The Gu clan brothers were happy to see Zu An in a hard spot. They thought to themselves, The crown princess kept praising this fella, but his cultivation doesn’t seem to be all that to us.

If it was over the seventh rank, then he couldn’t even go in. Out of sight, out of mind. If he hadn’t even reached the seventh rank… Heh, just wait and see how we’ll deal with you then.

Even the young masters from the other clans craned their necks. After all, Zu An’s accomplishments were just too outstanding. Even though there had been some speculations that explained what had happened, what if this person really was just that formidable?

Zu An walked onto the stage. He suddenly felt a bit apprehensive. Hadn’t there been a similar ball-like thing when he tested his aptitude in Brightmoon Academy? Back then, that ball had erupted with light and exploded.

Thankfully, Jiang Luofu had helped him cover up that matter back then. However, there were so many powerful experts here, and all of them were experienced. It wouldn’t be so easy to deceive them.

Qi Yaoguang’s voice said by his ear, “Don’t worry, this thing tests cultivation and not anything else.”

Zu An gave her a look. He saw that she didn’t open her mouth and only gestured toward him with her eyes. She had said those words just now through ki transmission.

“Eighth sister wanted me to remind you of that. Do you have some secret no one can know or something?” Qi Yaoguang asked. “This is so annoying; I still can't see through your fate or future.”

“There are no secrets.” Zu An smiled. At the same time, he felt warm inside. Jiang Luofu had even taken this into consideration, on top of giving him a map and helping him obtain some defensive treasures. She really was meticulous. This type of person would probably become a boss’ most trustworthy secretary, right…

He placed his hand on the celestial stone. At the same time, he stroked the spice bag he had gotten from Concubine Bai. He was actually feeling quite nervous, because he wasn’t sure if it would be enough to let him through.

The celestial stone soon shone. Everyone present cried out in alarm.
