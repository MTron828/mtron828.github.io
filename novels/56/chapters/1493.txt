Chapter 1442: Sun Goddess

The mulberry tree they had encountered in Mulberry Forest was already quite large, but compared to the one they were looking at now, it was completely insignificant. This tree’s trunk was tens of thousands of meters wide and reached straight through the clouds, seeming almost as tall as the heavens. Meanwhile, its trunk stretched down into the ocean, and it seemed as if its roots were planted in the deep sea. The water around the trunk boiled endlessly!

Yan Xuehen was stunned, saying, “I remember Shun and Grandgale mentioning that the Golden Crows often bathe in the sea. Could that be the reason why the sea is boiling like this? But all of them are clearly flying in the sky right now!”

“Those Golden Crows are just too powerful. Even the residual heat they left behind is enough to make me feel a bit uncomfortable,” Yun Jianyue said, her expression grave. Could they really win against creatures as powerful as this?

Yu Yanluo stared at the tree and said, “This should be the Fusang Tree they were talking about. So there was actually such a large tree in this world! No wonder all ten suns could perch here.”

Zu An simply felt a bit absent-minded. This Fusang Tree was indeed large, so large that it exceeded normal people’s imaginations. However, as a transmigrator, he knew how large a sun really was. Even though the tree was large, it was nothing more than a speck compared to the real sun. There was no way it could hold a real sun, let alone ten of them. However, this world claimed that it was the place where ten suns roosted!

He looked up at the ten suns far up in the heavens. He suddenly thought of something. Could it be that this world’s suns weren’t real suns? Rather, were they just Golden Crows taking on the role of the sun, causing the people to think of them as the sun? If that was the case, where was the real sun then?

He looked up at the heavens, thinking about the frightening astral winds and heavenly lightning he encountered. It wasn’t just him; not even the other talents throughout the ages had been able to pass through them. Could it be that there was some kind of secret deliberately hidden in the heavens?

Or perhaps…

Is the sky we see above us just a fake sky?

As soon as that thought appeared in his mind, he felt a chill run through his body. However, he just laughed in self-mockery. How could that be possible?

Yan Xuehen cried out in surprise, “Is that a chicken?”

Right as she spoke, strange chicken cries filled the air. The group looked for the source of the noise and saw a huge nest atop the tree. There was a strange… chicken on it? The chicken tilted its head to the side and looked at them, seemingly with great curiosity.

The group felt nervous. How could anything that lived on such an incredible tree be an ordinary chicken? They were scared that it would suddenly attack them.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Fortunately, it was a false alarm. The chicken only gave them a few curious looks, then returned to sleep in its nest, ignoring them.

Zu An couldn't help but say mockingly, “This chicken is really daring! Isn’t it scared that we’ll tie it up and eat it?”

Yan Xuehen rolled her eyes and replied, “How could something that lives in such a place be ordinary? It is hard to say who would eat whom if the time came.”

Zu An chuckled in embarrassment, knowing that was indeed the case. He didn’t argue against her.

The group quickly flew up to the Fusang Tree. They felt waves of heat batter them continuously. If not for the fact that their cultivation was quite high, they would have been cooked through in an instant.

Zu An picked up a few Golden Crow feathers from the branches. There was a faint fiery light swirling around them. They definitely weren’t ordinary items. He put them away, then asked, “Should we take a look around and see if we can set up some kind of trap? We can try to deal with them once they return.” He thought that fighting them head-on didn’t seem too realistic.

Yan Xuehen shook her head, saying, “This is their home, and they are here everyday. They are already used to this environment. Not even the slightest change will escape their notice, let alone in such a special place. It would be extremely difficult to set up a formation here.”

Zu An noticed that there weren’t any mountain veins, so his One Drop of Heaven’s Essence wouldn’t help too much. He had been hoping Yan Xuehen would have some ideas and couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed when he heard that.

“I feel as though we should start thinking about how to leave this place. We might be in a terrible situation if those Golden Crows return,” Yu Yanluo said gloomily.

Their expressions all froze. The feather Grandgale gave them had already disappeared. There was an ocean all around them. They really felt as if they were stuck now.

“That Grandgale only gave us a damn one-way ticket? He completely scammed us!” Zu An couldn't hold back his curses. He decided to look around for some way out with the women.

Suddenly, a cold voice called out, “Who are you?”

Zu An’s group was startled. They hadn’t noticed anyone approaching them even with their cultivation! That meant the person most likely hadn’t come with good intentions. They turned around, but were surprised by what they saw.

It wasn’t some vicious monster, but rather a beautiful woman. She was dressed in a long palace gown with many tassels and ribbons that fluttered in the wind. She looked like a fairy who had descended to the secular world.

However, compared to the fairies of their impressions, she seemed much more mature and alluring. Her hair was like that of a young married woman, and around her temple was a flickering golden crown that resembled a Golden Crow taking flight. She was also riding on a golden war chariot that was pulled by six dragons. As she stood there, she had the air of a great mother looking down on the world.

The group felt a weight in the pit of their stomachs. Why did the golden chariot look so much like the one the Golden Crow Crown Prince could summon?

Zu An quickly said, “Greetings, madam. We just happened to pass by this paradise and hope that we have not disturbed you.”

However, none of them could have expected the woman to treat them without any politeness, retorting, “Passing by? When has anyone ever passed by this place? I was wondering why those children would suddenly rush out together as if they had gone mad. So it was you who were causing trouble!”

The group was alarmed. The children she’s referring to… they’re not the Golden Crows, are they?

Zu An had a pained look because the Rage system had already received the woman’s Rage points. This mature-looking young woman was named Xi He. She was one of the legendary Sun Goddesses, one of Emperor Jun’s wives, and the mother of the ten Golden Crows!

Zu An cursed inwardly. Why did they have to run into such a legendary person?

They wanted to try and defend themselves, but Xi He didn’t give them the chance to at all. With a wave of her hands, endless rays of divine sunlight scattered down on them. Their expressions instantly changed, because they could sense that Xi He’s cultivation was at the earth immortal level, and even higher than the Fiend Emperor’s!

They didn’t dare hold back, using all manner of incredible skills. Unfortunately, when faced with an absolute difference in power, their retaliation was meaningless. They were soon tied up by strands of divine sunlight, unable to move an inch.

“Trespassing into Scalding Valley and disrupting my children, not even ten thousand deaths would be enough to acquit you of your crimes!” Xi He snapped in an ice-cold voice, as if she were handing down a decree from the highest heavens. She raised her sleeves, intending to punish these people and search for her sons after.

Seeing that they were about to die, all of them felt absolute despair. Just then, however, Zu An clenched his teeth and summoned the Gold Phoenix, using ‘Love Is More Solid than Gold’.
