Chapter 1416: Endless Revival

“What?” The others jumped in fright and looked at where the Yayu’s head had once been. Sure enough, they saw nothing there.

“Did the head flee back into the Weak Water on its own?” Zu An wondered, stunned. This was the first time he had ever seen such a thing happening with a severed head. It was way too weird.

“No,” Yu Yanluo said, shaking her head. Her complexion was a bit pale as she continued, hesitantly looking for a suitable word, “The head didn’t return to the Weak Water. Instead, it seemed to have just… melted away.”

“Melted?” The others replied, shocked. They really couldn't understand what jad happened.

“Could it be that the Yayu was created from the Weak Water? So when it died, it just melted away?” Yu Yanluo wondered.

Yan Xuehen said with a frown, “Could it be that the Yayu did not die at all?”

“I don’t think that’s too likely. Even its head was removed, and we saw that with our own eyes. It shouldn’t have been a fake,” Yun Jianyue said, shaking her head.

They talked for a long time, but in the end, they weren’t able to confirm whether the Yayu was dead or alive.

…

The conversation quickly returned to the previous subject. Yun Jianyue said, “Little An, you still didn’t say what you were giving me.”

Zu An’s expression stiffened. He quickly suggested, “Then how about I just give you these Yin Yang Swords? You were praising them not too long ago.”

“Hmph, forget it. I’m not like you, someone who can use yin and yang energies at the same time,” Yun Jianyue said, her expression darkening. “Even if I could, these swords don’t suit me as well as my Crescent Ring. Just keep them on you.”

Zu An began to sweat buckets. He offered, “Then why not just pick something from here?” He took out all of his treasures apart from the Tai’e Sword that Mi Li stayed in and the Poisonous Prick that was already bound to him, letting her pick freely.

However, not only was Yun Jianyue not happy at all, she even became upset and said, “You don’t have a shred of sincerity. I don’t want that stuff.”

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +488 +488 +488…

Yan Xuehen felt great when she saw how upset Yun Jianyue was. Ah Zu does treat me differently. Keep angering that witch!

Zu An hadn’t expected Yun Jianyue to become so angry, but he reacted quickly and said, “You’re right, I don’t have anything suitable for you. How about this? If I find something that’s suitable for you in the future, I’ll definitely give it to you immediately.”

Yun Jianyue’s mood changed from annoyance to happiness. She said, “That’s more like it. I didn’t treat you so well for nothing after all.”

After appeasing her, Zu An sighed in relief, but a moment later, he received another huge batch of Rage points from Yan Xuehen. He really wanted to cry, yet no tears came out.

He finally understood why the dating simulators in his previous world had so many different routes, and why it was rare to be able to follow all of them. As expected, choosing one route meant having to give up on another one.

Just then, a roar suddenly emerged from the Weak Water. When the group turned around, they once again saw the Yayu appear in a wave of water, baring its fangs at them. They were all stunned. It really hadn’t died?

The Yayu seemed to be angry that it had been plotted against and killed so easily. That was why this time, it didn’t hesitate to sweep its tail. An endless stream of water arrows flowed from the Weak Water and flew toward the group.

The group instinctively evaded the Yayu’s ferocious attack. When the water arrows landed on the large rocks on the shore, they quickly pierced through the rocks, and the holes left behind seemed to be growing larger over time.

“This water has corrosive properties!” Yan Xuehen cried out in alarm. She finally understood why her waistband had broken.

Zu An was filled with curiosity, saying, “I’ve touched this water before, though. Why was it fine?”

“It is either because your poison immunity paired with your tough body allows you to resist its corrosive nature, or that the ki of high-level cultivators can resist this Weak Water, preventing it from touching their skin,” Yan Xuehen said quickly.

They all suddenly realized that, no matter which of them it was, touching the water arrows directly with their bodies wouldn’t be a wise choice.

They were all some of the world’s strongest individuals, however. After evading the arrows, they began their counterattack. While Yun Jianyue used the Empress Lantern, she also sent the Crescent Ring flying; it turned into a streak of moonlight that flew toward the Yayu’s waist.

The Yayu had just suffered from the Empress Lantern a little while before, so how could it repeat that disastrous event? It struck outward with its sharp claws, sending a surge of Weak Water to block the light. Then, it twisted its body, barely avoiding the fatal moonbeam.

Just then, Yu Yanluo unfolded a scroll. Countless golden-armored soldiers charged forth from it to restrain the Yayu’s limbs. However, the Yayu roared in fury. It shook its body powerfully, completely shaking off the soldiers.

Yan Xuehen also made her move at the same time. She unfurled the Primal Skysilk Zu An had just given her, sending it out to bind the monster’s leg. Then, with a flick of her wrist, she pulled it ashore.

The Yayu screamed in anger. It tried to pry away the Primal Skysilk wrapped around its leg several times, but even though the Skysilk looked like thin cloth, it was extremely sturdy. It didn’t suffer any damage no matter what the Yayu did.

This time, Zu An didn’t only use the Yin Yang Swords, however. He also used the Violetflame Snake Pike, Universe Ring, and the other heaven-grade weapons together. He even took out the Poisonous Prick. With so many treasures aimed at it, how could the Yayu withstand the assault? It was nailed to the shore by the weapons.

However, none of the group relaxed yet. Instead, they surrounded the Yayu with serious expressions. Meanwhile, the Yayu’s limbs flailed around powerlessly. In the end, it no longer moved, and it closed its copper-like eyes.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Did it die for sure this time?” Yun Jianyue asked with a happy expression. She thought to herself, Was it because its body entered the Weak Water that it had a chance to revive? Now, its body is nailed to the shore. It shouldn’t be able to revive again, right?

However, her smile quickly froze, because the Yayu seemed to have turned into a formless puddle of water. Its massive body disappeared, just like that. Even though Yan Xuehen tried to freeze the water with her Snowflake Sword along the way, it didn’t do anything. The Yayu’s body completely melted away.

“What’s going on?!” Yun Jianyue cried. “Will it just keep reviving like that?”

Her confusion was quickly met with a response. The Yayu controlled the Weak Water once more and roared at the party. It was clearly still brooding over its earlier experiences.

“I refuse to believe that you can’t be killed!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, starting to become furious. She began to use all sorts of skills.

Zu An and the others coordinated with her, killing the Yayu once more. Once again, however, it disappeared right before their eyes, then revived in the Weak Water not long afterward. This time, it had learned its lesson and was much more cautious. It didn’t rashly advance toward Zu An’s party, but instead remained in the Weak Water. It faced them while barking like a dog.

“Why don’t you come up here?” Zu An taunted it with a provocative look.

The Yayu brandished its claws and looked at them with a taunting expression, as if to retort, Why don’t you come over here instead if you have the skills?!

Zu An laughed out of sheer irritation. Still, he had the perfect skill to use against such a stubborn thing. As such, he activated the skill ‘Fragrant Barf’ against it.

The Yayu’s eyes immediately turned completely red. It felt great rage burn with it, as if it had to kill this guy in order to feel better. It charged forth, spitting angrily.

However, due to the two grandmasters’ various skills, as well as Yu Yanluo’s amazing support and Zu An’s fiendish strength, the Yayu was quickly killed once again. This time, Yan Xuehen used some special evil exorcism runes.

Unfortunately, the monster still disappeared right before their eyes before being reborn again. Afterward, the Yayu bared its fangs at them a few times before conceding its defeat and entering the Weak Water, not showing itself again for fear that it would be hit by Zu An’s taunting skill again.

Now, Zu An’s group was in a predicament. What were they supposed to do now that this guy wouldn’t come out anymore? This Weak Water was just way too strange. They didn’t dare to go down there!
