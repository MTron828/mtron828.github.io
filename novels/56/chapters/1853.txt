Chapter 1802: Did We Come at a Bad Time?

Meanwhile, Zhao Han was on guard against the Ghost King’s Demonic Voice of the Ghost King and Glare of Eternal Slumber. He just had to keep his primordial spirit within him and not look at the opponent, which actually wasn’t too hard for him. With his current cultivation, he didn’t need his eyes to see anything in the tomb.

As such, he still paid some attention to Zu An’s side. Sure enough, he saw that Zu An hadn’t fallen asleep.

This kid does have some skills after all.

However, that still wasn’t enough. If Zu An could only do that much, there was no use in keeping him around. Otherwise, Zhao Han and the Ghost King would only destroy each other for no reason.

Just then, some changes took place in the other battle. The reason Qiu Honglei was able to fight against six ghost generals whose strength was similar to her own was due to her abundant combat experience. Otherwise, she would already have been killed.

However, with the huge disadvantage in numbers, even though she was extremely quick and intelligent, it was still beyond her ability in the end. If they were anywhere else, she could make better use of her surroundings and tactics to bait them into certain positions, then use the ?chance to take them down one by one. But she had to protect Zu An and couldn't go too far away. The ghost generals definitely wouldn’t leave with her. That meant she could only face them head-on.

In the end, she ended up making a slight mistake and her shoulder was struck by a mourning staff. If she hadn’t had light element protection around her body, she would likely have had her soul blasted into pieces on the spot. Just that one mistake made the entire fight extremely difficult.

Upon seeing the opening and realizing that Qiu Honglei couldn't evade, a ghost general struck at her vitals. However, a loud voice suddenly called out.

“What you lookin’ at?!”

“I’m looking at you, shithead!”

The ghost general was stunned. Why had it replied to Zu An?

Qiu Honglei used the moment to dodge quickly to one side, successfully evading the attack.

Afterward, ‘what you lookin’ at’ filled the air from time to time, with ‘I’m looking at you, shithead’ in response. As a result, Qiu Honglei barely avoided a disaster each time and was able to stabilize her situation.

Jing Teng was full of admiration as she watched the beautiful Qiu Honglei somehow neutralize the dangers coming at her one after another. If she were in Miss Qiu’s place, perhaps she would have long since died.

In the distance, Zhao Han’s eyes narrowed. This seemed to be an ability similar to Soulspeak, and it contained some kind of insurmountable law that disregarded any disparity in strength. Just where had that kid gotten something like that from? He temporarily gave up on all thoughts of leaving. He wanted to see what other cards Zu An had to play.

The Ghost King noticed the situation. That brat’s cultivation was clearly like that of an ant’s, but why did he have so many bizarre skills? Whether it was Zu An’s purification skills or the Soulspeak-like ability, not even he could see through their profundity.

He quickly roared, “You idiots, do you not know to plug your own ears?!”

The ghost generals snapped out of their daze, and their forms changed. One general’s ears drooped, while another’s ears were blocked up; yet another general’s muscles grew to completely plug up their ears. Another reached out with extra limbs to stuff up their ears…

Now, Zu An’s ‘what you lookin at’ no longer affected them. Qiu Honglei immediately started feeling more pressure.

When he saw that Qiu Honglei’s situation was dire, Zu An’s expression became grave. He gripped the handle of the Tai’e Sword. He knew it wasn’t a good time to act, but he couldn't just watch as Qiu Honglei was in danger.

Zhao Han’s eyes narrowed when he saw Zu An’s movements. Just what kinds of hidden moves did this brat have left? Could it be that he could fight while dealing with the Ghost King’s Glare of Eternal Slumber? He had seen that white ray before and knew that it contained the laws of absolute destruction and treachery. Not even he would have confidence in his ability to completely stop it, so how could this kid do it?

Suddenly, he noticed something and turned to look elsewhere.

The Ghost King also quickly called out, “Be careful!”

Unfortunately, the six ghost generals had their ears plugged, so how could they hear anything?

Two figures, one blue and one red, rushed forth. The entire space suddenly surged with endless wind and snow. Only when it arrived did the ghost generals react, but their bodies were already covered in a layer of cold frost by then. Almost simultaneously, black flames exploded all over the area, instantly engulfing the generals. Ice and fire crashed down from the heavens. How could the ghost generals still hold on? They all screamed miserably.

Zhao Han’s eyes narrowed. The two figures were actually fighting as a team?

The Ghost King was furious and nervous. He knew his ghost generals normally wouldn’t be so useless, but it was because they were defending against Zu An’s mysterious ‘what you lookin’ at’ after being ordered to cut off their sense of hearing. That meant all of their attention had been on taking care of Qiu Honglei, and they couldn’t sense the two newcomers in time. The two also fought ingeniously with fire and ice, doubling the power of their attacks. That was why the generals had suffered so severely.

The black flames in particular seemed a bit strange. They even seemed to be able to directly burn souls!

The six generals struggled and wanted to flee, but how could Qiu Honglei let such an opportunity go? Her entire body erupted with brilliance as she used her light element purification ability. Even though it couldn’t compare to the miraculous effects of Zu An’s primordial energy, it still had some restrictive effects against ghosts. Qiu Honglei moved as fast as lightning, quickly reaping the lives of the six ghost generals.

“No!” the Ghost King exclaimed furiously. Black energy and skulls swarmed in that direction.

However, Zhao Han blocked his path and said with a smile, “Ghost King, your opponent is me.”

He had previously thought about letting the Ghost King unleash a great slaughter. Those women were extremely outstanding among their generation, but they were still far, far inferior to the Ghost King and wouldn’t even bring out any of his real ability. On the other hand, it would make Zu An and Jing Teng completely fall out with him. If they decided to go for broke and side with the Ghost King, that would be really troublesome.

“All of you will die, all of you!” the Ghost King roared furiously. This shining golden guy really was a bit too difficult to deal with. Even though he had a slight advantage in strength, Zhao Han had too many treasures and abilities and wasn’t easy to restrain. He really wondered just where Zhao Han had gotten so many things!

How could he know that Zhao Han was the monarch of another world, and that his treasury had treasures from all over the world? He didn’t hesitate to use them against such a powerful enemy, so the two sides were equal in strength.

…

On the other hand, Zu An finally caught a breather. He was happy and surprised when he saw those two familiar figures, calling out, “Chuyan, Manman!”

Jing Teng looked over in surprise and saw two exceptional beauties standing nearby. One was in an ice-blue dress, pure as a snow lotus herb on a mountain of ice; the other was in a red and black dress, her seductive eyes filled with endless affection like a tender and beautiful rose.

They were the ones Zu An was looking for? Why are all the women at his side so ridiculously beautiful?

You have successfully trolled Jing Teng for +66 +66 +66…

While she was observing them, they were also sizing her up. Qiu Honglei was one thing, since they had already interacted with each other before. But who was that woman nestling so closely to Zu An’s side?

Chu Chuyan gave her a look. A hint of shock flashed through her eyes. This woman’s features were as beautiful as a painting, and there was a natural poise and grace to her appearance, as if she were a peony that had just blossomed.

Just how many days had it been, and yet that scoundrel Ah Zu already had another exceptional beauty at his side? Was he a walking human-shaped aphrodisiac? He was constantly seducing women!

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +99 +99 +99…

Pei Mianman wrinkled her nose. After just a few days of not being around each other, this guy already had another woman. If they didn’t meet for a few years, wouldn’t he have his own female legion?

Also, why is it Chuyan and Manman, not Manman and Chuyan?!

You have successfully trolled Pei MIanman for +100 +100 +100…

Qiu Honglei walked over and put her arms around the two women, saying, “Oh my, it was big sis Chu and big sis Pei! It was all thanks to your help, or else I would already have lost my life to the yellow springs.”

She had immediately gone on red alert when she saw the arrival of the two women. One of them was Ah Zu’s first wife, even though they had divorced, while the other seemed to be especially close to Ah Zu.

These two are my strongest competitors.

However, they had just saved her life, so if she immediately indicated that she opposed them, wouldn’t she look like an ungrateful wretch in Zu An’s eyes?

In that case, I’m going to do the very opposite! You can all show your jealousy, which will only make me look more kind and understanding. Let’s see which type Ah Zu likes more.

Hmph, the Devil Sect’s Saintess isn’t just a carelessly given title. If you want to compete in acting green tea, you have no idea how immature you are!

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman immediately felt goosebumps all over when they felt her hook her arms around them and call them ‘big sis’. Perhaps men would like her act, but how could the two women not know what was going on?

How gross…

A strange silence suddenly fell.

Only Zu An didn’t seem to have noticed anything. He asked in pleasant surprise, “How did you all end up here?”

Chu Chuyan replied with an ambiguous smile, “What, did we come at a bad time?”

She suddenly felt a bit unhappy.

Master had me cultivate in seclusion for the past two years. Even though my cultivation grew higher and higher, I barely got to spend any time with him, and he only ended up having more and more women around him.

Was it really worth it? I don’t even know anymore…
