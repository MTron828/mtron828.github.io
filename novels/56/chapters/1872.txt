Chapter 1821: Hidden Path

Meanwhile, the Ghost King was chasing Zu An, so they had never expected a blast of lightning to strike them. The black mist around them shuddered. Even though the lightning couldn't hurt them, lightning had a natural restraining effect toward sinister things. That was why it still made them feel extremely uncomfortable.

Startled, the Ghost King quickly turned around vigilantly, but was stunned to see that it was actually Xie Daoyun. For a second, it was almost as if Sun En had come back to life or something!

Being incredibly cunning, the Ghost King had been worried about the possibility of Sun En pulling the same trick in retaliation, waiting until the fight against Zu An reached a critical moment before delivering a fatal strike. However, it was possible to more or less guess what happened upon seeing the Record of High Firmament floating in front of her.

This woman is pretty lucky. I would have taken those records for myself if I knew that this was going to happen.

Previously, the Ghost King had just never liked that kind of evil-warding lightning very much, and had thus rejected those three records a bit. Furthermore, it would be hard for them to use the three records anyway. On top of that, Zu An had been constantly putting on the pressure, keeping them from immediately taking the three records. And yet in the end, they had ended up letting that little lady get away with the records!

They felt annoyed just thinking about it.

…

Zu An’s spirit gained a huge boost, because while fighting against the Ghost King, he had noticed that the so-called immunity to damage wasn’t perfect. After all, the purification power of his Primordial Origin Sutra was enough to wound the Ghost King, as was the power of lightning. It was only because the black mist around them was too large, creating the illusion that they had immunity to all physical and elemental damage. Now that he knew that the Ghost King was an enemy that could be defeated, Zu An had much more confidence. He no longer felt the same sense of powerlessness.

When he saw the Ghost King flying toward Xie Daoyun, Zu An stopped them with his divine sword, calling out, “Your opponent is me!”

The power of a divine weapon was no trivial matter. Together with the different abilities Zu An had, sword energy wove through the air. The Ghost King couldn't help but face him seriously.

Xie Daoyun also sent lightning strikes out from time to time. Even though their power wasn’t that great, the evil-warding properties of the lightning still didn’t feel good for the Ghost King at all.

The Ghost King roared with anger after discovering that it was impossible to immediately defeat Zu An. This kid was like a roach that just wouldn’t die! He was clearly unbearably weak, and yet the Ghost King’s own tremendous power always seemed to be inexplicably absorbed by a mysterious power. Furthermore, this youngster’s power also actually seemed to approach their own level, so they had no choice but to face him seriously. Otherwise, it was entirely possible for them to lose!

How could there be such a strange being in this world?

Just how can he be that weak and that strong at the same time?

Does this world still make any sense?

You have successfully trolled the Ghost King for +666 +666 +666…

Now that the fight they’d expected to be completely one-sided had ended up like this, the Ghost King felt more and more dejected, exclaiming, “You’ve forced me to do this!”

Suddenly breaking free from the battle, the giant face opened its mouth and began to inhale. Endless black energy gathered toward the Ghost King from the walls and ground. The black mist around them became denser and denser, eventually becoming even more glossy than black ink.

Zu An didn’t dare to waste any time. He used his sword to attack the Ghost King, but before that darkness, the resplendent sword light became completely insignificant. Even though he was able to cut through a bit of black mist, the Ghost King was able to replenish much more.

“Haha, it’s useless! Once I’ve absorbed enough power, all of you can just die then!” the Ghost King said arrogantly, their voice echoing through the entire tomb room.

Pfft!

Blood flowed out from the mouths of the women within the barrier. The Ghost King’s increasing power caused the Demonic Voice of the Ghost King to grow in strength as well, so the formation around them was gradually falling apart as well.

Even Xie Daoyun couldn't spare any time to use the Record of High Firmament anymore, and quickly used the Record of Emperor’s Suppression to summon divine troops in order to aid the black tortoise in blocking the demonic voice. However, her cultivation was too low, so the number of divine troops was too low. Even the light their bodies gave off was far weaker than when Sun En used the talisman. The celestial soldiers’ bodies quickly cracked, then shattered one after another.

Xie Daoyun’s forehead was covered in fine sweat. She felt as if her brain were being stabbed by needles, as if the veins there could explode at any time. She knew it was a sign of heavily overdrafting her mental strength. Sun En’s three records were extraordinary, as expected… Not only did using them require her cultivation to be powerful, it also took a heavy toll on her mind. If this continued, she would quickly be emptied out. No wonder Sun En had warned that she would only be able to bring out the power of the three divine talismans after she gradually increased her strength.

However, she didn’t dare to stop yet. She quickly took out a pill from the academy that could replenish her mental strength. Then, she continuously summoned more celestial soldiers. Despite that, it was only thanks to Yun Jianyue continuously providing her with ki that she hadn’t already turned into a shriveled corpse.

Yun Jianyue cursed inwardly. Apart from those on Zhao Han’s level, she had long been considered among the world’s strongest individuals. The ocean of ki within her was incredibly vast. And yet, she had never expected Xie Daoyun to expend ki that quickly, almost like an endless black hole! She could only bitterly hold on as well, though.

If even she was in that state, how could the other women be any better off? With their group’s cultivation, they wouldn’t have ended up in such a bitter state even if they were fighting against Zhao Han; however, the Ghost King’s Demonic Voice of the Ghost King was a freaking cheat. It was an area of effect attack that turned everything weaker than itself into a helpless ant. They couldn't even retaliate.

Only someone like Zu An with his special abilities was exempt from that, leaving the Ghost King incredibly frustrated.

Jing Teng looked around her and saw that all the women were injured. She knew that if this continued, perhaps they would all just die. She clenched her teeth, and her body flickered. She jumped toward the nearby Immortal Ruler Baopu’s coffin and called out, “Ghost King, if you want to obtain the real Baopu Sutra, then follow me!”

The coffin clearly wasn’t that tall, at least not as tall as Jing Teng when she stood up; and yet, due to some unknown mechanism, once she jumped in, she actually disappeared.

The Ghost King was shocked. Could it be that they hadn’t been able to find anything because the real secrets were hidden at the bottom of the coffin?

Immortal Ruler Baopu had been lying inside before. With his reputation, no one dared to touch his corpse and treat him with disrespect. The fear and reverence they had felt prevented them from trying that.

The Ghost King no longer bothered with the others anymore, chasing after Jing Teng with a shrill cry.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Meanwhile, Zu An had been hesitating over which skill to bring out, but his opponent had left him quite conflicted. He didn’t know what kind of skill would actually be enough to restrain the Ghost King.

However, Jing Teng and the Ghost King both disappeared in a flash, leaving Zu An horrified. Worried that something had happened to Jing Teng, he used his instant movement skill to enter the coffin. There seemed to be a formation at the bottom that transported him away as soon as he entered.

The other women were a few steps too late. By the time they arrived, the formation was already closed. They couldn't open it up again no matter what they tried.

“What do we do now?” the women all asked nervously. The Ghost King was too powerful, and no matter how many people they had on their side, they still couldn't win. Now, Zu An was chasing after him alone, so didn’t that mean things weren’t looking good?

“There’s no need for alarm. That kid Zu An is stronger than any of you can fathom. He’ll be fine. Besides, because the Demonic Voice of the Ghost King targets the soul, we won’t be any help even if we go, and might only distract him,” Yun Jianyue said. She had experienced all kinds of storms in her life, after all. She had even seen Zu An kill the Fiend Emperor, so she was comparatively calmer than the others.

However, despite what she said, she was still incredibly nervous. When they defeated the Fiend Emperor, the spiritual essence in the air had been incredibly dense and all sorts of other factors had lined up, but even so, Zu An had almost lost his life. How could he truly be perfectly fine in this situation?

“There’s also Jing Teng. That woman is extremely mysterious and has a close relationship with Immortal Ruler Baopu. She knows much more about this great tomb than we do. She’ll help Ah Zu,” Qiu Honglei said, although she was clenching her fists so tightly her nails dug into her palms out of nervousness.

If Jing Teng can bring Zu An out safely, I’ll completely acknowledge her as my little sister.

No, it’s fine even if she wants to become the big sister!

“Honglei, you’ve spent the longest amount of time with Miss Jing. Can you tell us more details about her?” Chu Chuyan asked. She set aside her jealousy and quickly grabbed Qiu Honglei to ask for more details.

The other women also moved closer. Qiu Hongle hadn’t expected to be surrounded that way, but she began to slowly talk about her interactions with Jing Teng.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An was sent away by the formation. The world spun around him, and he fell into a dark space.
