Chapter 1425: True Form Revealed

So it was a perverted pig after all!

When they saw how the Fengxi Boar was about to go crazy while staring at Yun Jianyue’s performance atop the tree, Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo both cursed it inwardly. Comparatively, Zu An’s performance was far, far better.

The Fengxi Boar ran a few circles around the bottom of the tree. It then raised its head and looked at Yun Jianyue in a stupor. When it saw the beauty in the moon, it felt extremely impatient and uneasy, as if recalling something from the past.

After some time passed, it stopped being content with just looking. It stomped its four stubby legs on the ground, flying into the air with a scream. Its posture was extremely comical and funny, but its huge body made it look like a massive missile. If it rammed into something, forget about Yun Jianyue’s delicate and slender body, even the big mulberry tree wouldn’t necessarily be able to take it.

Zu An also snapped out of his daze just then. He immediately used Hundredwarble’s mental attack on the Fengxi Boar. The boar’s entire body trembled, and its body froze for a moment.

However, Zu An also felt a stinging pain in his head. When a mental attack like Hundredwarble was used against experts who had already condensed a soul, it would often deal a substantial amount of damage to the user too.

Despite that, Zu An relied on his powerful regeneration to use it anyway. A hint of confusion flashed through his gaze, as the moment he attacked the boar with the mental attack, he didn’t seem to see a wild boar, but rather a strong man shrouded in black energy. The next second, however, the wild boar materialized again.

Could it be the mental rebound making me see something wrong?

While the Fengxi Boar was in a daze, a thick, taut rope suddenly shot out from the dense tree branches. It was like an iron chain, blocking the boar’s path.

The Fengxi Boar finally snapped out of its daze, and a hint of disdain appeared in its eyes. It had great strength; in the past, humans had vainly attempted to tie it up with ropes, but then it had easily snapped them with only a slight struggle. Thus, it allowed that rope to wrap around it, intending to use the momentum of its charge to just run straight through and break it.

However, its eyes quickly narrowed. The rope had already been stretched to several times its original length from the boar’s strength, its once-thick material becoming incredibly thin; it looked as if it could snap at any time. And yet, it just didn’t snap.

Meanwhile, because the Fengxi Boar had suffered from the previous mental attack, its movements had been slowed, weakening its charge considerably. It was already too late to get out of the situation.

The extremely taut rope was like a bowstring that had been fully drawn. When the boar’s body stopped moving, it was sent flying toward the ground at an even greater speed than its original charge.

The rope was naturally not an ordinary one; rather, it was made of the Jade Moon Serpent’s tendons.

In the past, when Zu An had helped the crown prince complete his test in Westhound Tomb, those tendons were the spoils of war. Crown Princess Bi Linglong had given them to him. He hadn’t expected they would be useful now.

Of course, just those tendons alone wouldn’t be enough to stop the powerful Fengxi Boar. Fortunately, he had the assistance of runes Yan Xuehen had applied; only then could he take down the Fengxi Boar.

The Fengxi Boar lost its center of gravity as it struck the ground with a loud crash, causing it to sink into a hole; it was a pitfall Yan Xuehen and the others had set up previously. The boar roared furiously from within the pit. It had initially charged over out of lust, but it hadn’t gotten to enjoy anything and had instead suffered miserably. The sheer difference between expectation and reality was too huge.

However, when it saw the crushed wooden stakes and sharp stones inside the pit, it thought to itself, You actually wanted to hurt me with this stuff?

It roared, intending to charge out of the pit to teach the ignorant people with shallow knowledge outside a lesson, but several blue lines suddenly shone around it. They surrounded the boar, forming a frightening diagram.

The boar could vaguely make out some fluttering flags within the forest. As a monster from ancient times, it immediately realized that it was inside a formation!

A painting scroll unfolded above it, covering the pit. It suddenly felt as if the world had changed. It was no longer in a mulberry forest, but rather in an unfamiliar place.

The painting was none other than Yu Yanluo’s World Painting. However, its grade was insufficient to trap an ancient monster like the Fengxi Boar. Fortunately, she had Yan Xuehen to help her by setting up a great formation ahead of time. Then, using the World Painting as the eye of the formation allowed it to become many times more powerful.

Zu An and the others took the chance to rush into the formation, where he used the White Lotus Flame to engulf the Fengxi Boar.

The boar screamed in pain. It tried to shoot out the fur on its body, intending to burn the forest around it down if it had to. However, the huge formation contained a world of its own. There was no mulberry forest left!

As the controller of the formation, Yan Xuehen effortlessly helped the others avoid the crossbow bolt-like steel needles. At the same time, she used the Snowflake Sword. Cold air completely surrounded the Fengxi Boar.

Borrowing the power of the formation, the strength of her Snowflake Sword increased tremendously. When the cold air made contact with the White Lotus Flame, it turned into steam that surrounded the Fengxi Boar, making it cry out in pain.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Zu An was surprised. He hadn’t expected the power of ice and fire combining to be so great. Hmm, no wonder there were so many guys in my world who liked to play with characters that used both fire and ice…

He didn’t waste any time and took out his Universe Ring, using it to continuously strike the boar’s head. While it was dizzy from the blunt force, he took out a long spear that had a blazing speartip.

It was a heaven-grade weapon Shang Liuyu had given him, something from the Dragon Palace: the Violetflame Snake Pike.

The Fengxi Boar’s defenses were especially strong, and its retaliation was ferocious as well. Such a long-handled weapon was the best option against it. Zu An remembered that the hunters of his previous world also used spears to face wild boars.

Even though the Fengxi Boar’s defenses were strong, after being injured by the White Lotus Flame and the Snowflake Sword, it had already weakened considerably. Furthermore, although it had stronger resistance to physical attacks, it definitely couldn't take on a spear shrouded in demonic flames. Thus, almost every thrust left behind a scorched, burning, bloody hole.

Even though the Fengxi Boar was thick-skinned, it still couldn't bear the endless attacks. It knew it would be in danger if this continued. Thus, it suddenly cried out and turned into black energy. Then, the black energy turned into countless smaller boars that ran in several different directions.

“Be careful! As long as a single little boar can get away, it will escape. It won’t be so easy to make it fall for this kind of trap again!” Yun Jianyue called out. She was experienced and immediately recognized the boar’s move as a brilliant self-preservation method.

Zu An didn’t panic. If the Fengxi Boar maintained its large wild boar form, it might have been tricky for him. However, if it broke up into smaller parts, it would likely be troublesome for other people, but he definitely didn’t lack area-of-effect skills.

Thus, he unleashed the Lion’s Roar he had stolen from the Lion race. A terrifying roar filled the entire formation world. Such an AOE attack had limited effects on cultivators with higher cultivation, but now that the Fengxi Boar had turned into countless small boars, they had become much weaker individually. They were instantly confused by the Lion’s Roar.

While the little boar were frozen, Zu An used his Blue Luan Sword Formation. Endless sword energy rained down from the skies, impaling all the boars to death. In the end, they dissipated into black smoke, which coalesced and reformed into the Fengxi Boar’s large body once more. However, it was full of holes and on its last legs.

Zu An held the Violetflame Snake Pike in his hand and was about to end its life when the boar turned into a human, exclaiming, “Strong hero, spare my life, please spare me!”

The others were alarmed when they saw that. They hadn’t expected the Fengxi Boar to actually be a person! After all, the Yayu had a human face but a snake body. It had many non-human traits. However, this guy was completely a human, from head to toe.

Zu An was even more shocked because this person was the same as the one he had seen when he attacked using Hundredwarble. Could it be the Fengxi Boar’s true body?

“Who are you?” Yun Jianyue shouted.

The strong man gave Yun Jianyue a look, immediately recognizing her as the woman who had been dancing in the moonlight. A complicated expression that resembled a mix of infatuation and resentment appeared on his face. He quickly lowered his head and said, “My name is Pang Meng, and I used to be a hunter. In the past, I was sent by the people to eliminate the disaster that was the Fengxi Boar. Even though I managed to kill it, I was assailed by the black energy around it, and then inadvertently transformed into it. Thank you all for freeing me from this wretched plight.”

Zu An and the others looked at each other in dismay; all of their expressions were strange. Why was it just like the Yayu? Could this be another person who had suffered a bitter fate?
