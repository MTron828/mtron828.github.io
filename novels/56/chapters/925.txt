Chapter 893, Part 1: Interrogation

Zhuxie Chixin glanced into the distance. He asked quietly, “Crown princess, are there any other survivors?”

Bi Linglong shook her head. “There’s no one else with us. However, our group scattered earlier, so I’m not too sure.”

“Then it looks like there are none.” Zhuxie Chixin nodded. “I only found the Liu clan’s Gao Ying, Pei clan’s Pei You, and two Eastern Palace guards. For some reason, they were all hanging from trees and heavily injured. We already sent them back to be treated at the imperial hospital.”

Bi Linglong was surprised and replied, “Then I’ve troubled Chief Commander.” She wondered if those people knew the truth.

But when she remembered that they had already separated back then, that they couldn’t know about what had happened afterward, she sighed in relief.

The ‘unconscious’ Zu An sighed inwardly. The two Eastern Palace guards had to be Jiao Sigun and Piao Duandiao. Even though their cultivation ranks weren’t high, their luck really wasn’t bad! They had actually survived even after experiencing so much danger!

But that was definitely a happy thing. He had even been feeling a bit ashamed that he wasn’t able to properly take care of them.

Zhuxie Chixin left behind some subordinates to search for other survivors, then escorted Bi Linglong’s group out of the dungeon with most of his men. Now that he had found the crown prince and princess, his mission was already complete. As for whether or not he could find the others, he didn’t care that much.

There was a large group raising their heads and looking around outside the dungeon entrance. Everything boded ill for the crown prince’s party after what had just happened in the dungeon. If his party had been wiped out, that meant that no one would be able to compete against King Qi anymore.

As for the emperor’s other sons, without the status of being the eldest son, they weren’t even worth mentioning in front of King Qi. Many great subjects had egged on the crown prince and showed their support over the years. They couldn't just switch to a new patron immediately.

Those from King Qi’s side felt as if the war had already been won, that everything was beautiful. But they were all skilled politicians. Even though they were smiling inwardly, they looked broken-hearted on the surface. They didn’t give their political enemies any weaknesses to exploit.

However, there were people among the large group who were truly grief-stricken. A handsome young man stared ahead with reddened eyes, tears continuously trickling down his cheeks. Who else could it be but Chu Youzhao?

“Big brother Chu, please don’t worry too much. Big brother Zu is capable and outstanding; I’m sure he’ll be fine,” Murong Qinghe said in consolation.

A nearby person from the Murong clan muttered, “Why is he crying for nothing? You’re acting like a girl.”

“You don’t know anything! This is called being in tune with his emotions; he’s a man full of emotions! He’s nothing like all of you who have muscles for brains!” Murong Qinghe shot that person a look as she gently consoled Chu Youzhao.

Chu Youzhao felt as if her heart had become ice cold. She had always been waiting outside. She had constantly been hearing predictions and analyses about what was happening inside the dungeon, but what all of them had in common was that a world-destroying calamity had happened inside. No matter how high her brother-in-law’s cultivation was, everything pointed to a disaster…

The people from the academy shared her concern. Xie Daoyun asked Jiang Luofu with a look of worry, “Ms. Jiang, do you think big brother Zu is still alive?”

Xie Xie’s mouth widened. If he had seen his big sister like this at any other time, he would have cursed Zu An for not having any sisters, feeling that he was losing out greatly in that respect. But at that moment, he couldn't even bring himself to think about such things.

Jiang Luofu was also quite stressed. “You’ve kept asking me these questions these past few days; how am I supposed to know? No one knows more about the dungeon than Ms. Qi. Go and ask her.”

Xie Daoyun looked at Qi Yaoguang anxiously. Qi Yaoguang scratched her hair and said, “The space inside was chaotic, so I couldn't check what was inside either. But now that the dungeon has been opened again, Commander Zhuxie and the others have already gone in. I’m sure they’ll reach a conclusion soon.”

Even though her impression of Zu An wasn’t bad, that was it. The two of them hadn’t known each other for that long or shared deeper feelings. If he died inside, she would feel a bit of regret, but she’d get over it after a few days. Comparatively speaking, she was more interested in what had happened to the dungeon and what exactly had caused it. She wanted to know if there was anything they could do to prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future, or at least be more prepared for it should it happen again.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Jiang Luofu patted Xie Daoyun’s shoulder and said, “Don’t worry. He has the chess piece Hei Baizi gave him, and he even has that Last Breath Talisman you gave him. He should be able to come out ahead even if he does encounter any danger.”

Even though she consoled Xie Daoyun that way, she didn’t have any confidence in that regard either. After all, the entire world inside had been destroyed! What could those things do for him in such a situation?

Suddenly, the spatial elements by the entrance rippled. Qi Yaoguang stood up and said, “People are coming out.”

Those present had been paying close attention to the entrance. When they saw that, they all rushed over. Fortunately, the Embroidered Envoy was present to maintain order, and didn’t allow them to get too close and secretly try anything.

Zhuxie Chixin and the others came out soon afterward. When they saw a chubby body emerge, those from the crown prince’s faction were stunned at first, but then they all erupted into cheers.

To be honest, even they had already thought that Zhao Ruizhi had died. After all, something so big had happened inside the dungeon. Even if a master rank cultivator went inside, only death would await them. How could an idiot like the crown prince survive?

The crown prince’s faction had been left in low spirits. Some of them had even already been considering how to change sides. How could they not become emotional when they saw him return safely?

Those from King Qi Manor were shocked. The smiles they’d had just a second before froze on their faces as shock overwhelmed them. “How is that possible? How can he still be alive?!” There were trusted aides among them who knew more details. Even if the dungeon hadn’t collapsed, the crown prince should have died inside. How had he come out alive?

Even though the crown prince’s face was dirty and his clothes were tattered, and he had many injuries, his life wasn’t in danger. No, not only that, he was throwing a tantrum and shouting that he wanted to eat the capital’s pastries right now.

Unlike those from King Qi Manor’s faction, who looked as if their family members had just died, those from the crown prince’s faction were beaming and screaming in happiness.

The Bi clan master, Bi Qi, rushed over to his daughter. “Linglong, are you injured? Huh? Your hair…”

The crown prince was alive, but if the crown princess had died, the Bi clan’s many years of hard work would have only benefited another.

Bi Linglong shook her head. “I’m fine. I’ll explain things to you later, father.”

Bi Qi wanted to ask more questions, but Chu Youzhao had already shoved her way over, crying, “Where is my brother-in-law? Crown princess, where is my brother in law?!”

When she saw how panicked Chu Youzhao was, Bi Linglong thought to herself that Zu An’s relationship with him really was good. But for some reason, the words ‘brother-in-law’ really stung. Before she could even decide whether to reply or not, however, Chu Youzhao saw Zu An on a stretcher toward the back of the procession.

“Brother-in-law!” Chu Youzhao ran over while sobbing. Zu An was lying there, not moving at all. Was he already dead?

The ‘unconscious’ Zu An sighed inwardly. This little sister-in-law of his wasn’t so bad after all. She was crying to the point that even he was feeling bad. He wanted to tell her that he was fine through ki transmission, but when he remembered that this kid was really bad at acting and couldn't hide her real thoughts at all, he could only silently apologize to her and abandon that thought.

Meanwhile, Jiang Luofu and Xie Daoyun also came over. However, they showed much more restraint and didn’t shove their way over while crying like Chu Youzhao. They waited quietly off to the side, waiting for a reply.

Zhuxie Chixin immediately walked over and stopped everyone. “I’m going to bring them back to the imperial palace first. His majesty has summoned them himself. Before then, those uninvolved aren’t allowed to get close to them.”

Chu Youzhao was stunned. She picked up something from his words and asked, “My brother-in-law isn’t dead?”

Zhuxie Chixin didn’t want to reply. He still had his duty, after all. He had to uphold a level of confidentiality before he received further instructions from the emperor.

It was Bi Linglong who replied instead. “Don’t worry, his life isn’t in danger. He was just wounded quite badly from saving me and the crown prince.”

The eyes of the entire capital were aimed in their direction at that moment. She spoke about Zu An’s contributions again in front of all those present. After having been in the palace for so long, she didn’t even bat an eyelid when telling lies anymore. No one present sensed anything strange.

Chu Youzhao finally relaxed when she heard Bi Linglong’s explanation. But she quickly replied, “My brother-in-law is wounded so badly, but you aren’t taking him to see a doctor, and instead bringing him to the imperial palace for an interrogation? You’re all heartless!”

Zhuxie Chixin said with a snort, “This is his majesty’s personal decree. Are you opposing his decree?”

Chu Youzhao wanted to say something else, but Murong Qinghe immediately stopped her, saying, “Big brother Chu, don’t worry. The imperial palace’s doctors are even better.”

Things would be really, really bad if Chu Youzhao ended up saying something disrespectful to his majesty! Everyone in the capital knew that his majesty’s mood hadn’t been too great. Several subjects had made slight mistakes that usually wouldn’t have mattered at all, but because they had incurred the emperor’s anger, they had been punished severely.

If her big brother Chu angered the emperor, there would be nothing good waiting for her at all. Fortunately, Murong Qinghe was able to convince Chu Youzhao. Chu Youzhao decided not to push the issue any further when she thought about the skill level of the imperial physicians.

Jiang Luofu, Xie Daoyun, and the others sighed in relief as well. With how things stood, it wasn’t proper for them to step forward and say anything.

King Liang Zhaoyi roared, “Where is my son, Zhao Xi?!”

“I don’t see Xian’er either,” came Guard General Liu Yao’s voice.

“My clan’s Meng Pan isn’t here either!” Central Secretariat Supervisor Meng Yi also cried out in alarm.
