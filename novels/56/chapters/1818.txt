Chapter 1767: Divine Firmament Sect Master

The maids had always strived for the second young master’s favor day after day. They looked polite and amiable on the surface, but they had actually secretly been competing fiercely against each other. The clan master had agreed to take them on the trip, so they had been in high spirits, thinking that the clan master approved of them. They had thought to themselves that they definitely had to perform well on this trip. Even if none of them could become the second young master's first wife, becoming a proper concubine was also good.

But who would have thought that the only thing awaiting them would be such a tragic end? Wang Youjun had moved so quickly that no one could react in time.

When he saw his maids being sacrificed mercilessly, Wang Neishi’s face turned white. His first reaction was anger, but when he realized that the one responsible was his father, how could he act up?

“What are you doing?” Xie Daoyun exclaimed in shock and anger, unconcerned with offending the clan master.

Wang Neishi couldn't help but secretly feel admiration. This woman looked weak and delicate on the outside, but she was actually quite tough on the inside.

Wang Youjun simply replied, “Naturally, I’m dealing with this lightning formation. Look, didn’t the lightning become much weaker?”

Xie Daoyun had naturally noticed that, but how was that the most important point? She protested, “But they were all living people!”

Wang Youjun’s expression remained completely normal as he said, “If not for our Wang clan, they would already have died a long time ago. The fact that they could live for so long in such luxury was already their blessing. What’s the big deal with helping this old one a bit?”

Xie Daoyun was so angry her entire body shook. Yun Jianyue secretly held her in consolation. As the Devil Sect Master, she had seen more than her fair share of such things.

Wang Youjun didn’t pay Xie Daoyun any more attention and walked up to the outskirts of the stone forest. He observed the strength of the lightning a bit more, then suddenly acted again. A large hand appeared in the air, grabbing several dozen of his subordinates with the lowest cultivation ranks.

Those people screamed in horror and tried to resist. Unfortunately, how could they be a match for Wang Youjun? They were quickly tossed into the center of the stone forest. A burst of flames and lightning erupted, and their flesh melted instantly.

The others became nervous. The lightning was just too terrifying. Even Yun Jianyue’s expression changed a bit. Compared to the lightning element cultivators she knew, this lightning was far stronger than even Sect Master Xuan Bajing’s lightning skills.

Now, the Wang clan’s people finally understood. No wonder the sect master had brought so many people! It turned out that it wasn’t for their skills, but rather to use them as cannon fodder! How could they still be willing to stay? They all frantically ran toward the ship.

Wang Youjun sneered and said, “I was a bit hesitant at first, but since you’ve made this choice, you can’t blame me anymore.”

He activated a talisman, then two large hands appeared in the air again. Just like that, the fleeing people were all grabbed and tossed into the depths of the stone forest. Even though they were carefully selected experts and used all sorts of skills to protect themselves, all of them were blasted to ashes by countless arcs of electricity.

As he looked at the smoking remains, Wang Youjun nodded in satisfaction. He said, “As expected, it’s about enough now. Even though there’s still a bit of electricity left, we can endure it even without cultivation.”

Apart from his son Wang Neizhi, there were still four elders at his side. They were all clan elders, people from his generation. They weren’t much weaker than him. They remained completely calm even after witnessing the sight. It seemed as if they had known what would happen from the very start.

Xie Daoyun’s entire body felt ice-cold. She cried, “You’re a group of devils wearing human skin!”

She thought back to how Wang Port’s people had all proudly proclaimed that they were under the Wang clan’s protection, and how everything seemed to be so prosperous and happy that no ghosts dared to approach. She had been filled with admiration back then, and thought that the Wang clan was incredibly kind. Now, it seemed that was all a lie!nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

She tugged on Yun Jianyue’s hand and said, “Big sis Yun, we should leave!” She didn’t want to stay with these demons any longer, let alone help them.

“Leave? Are you sure you can do that?” Wang Youjun remarked, and the Wang clan’s four elders quickly surrounded the two women. In the current situation, he naturally wouldn’t let anyone go. Furthermore, Xie Daoyun’s skill in formations would likely still prove useful later.

“What, could it be that you want to stop me?” Yun Jianyue replied, raising a brow. A cruel smile appeared on the corners of her lips.

Wang Youjun said calmly, “I know your cultivation is quite high. If we were fighting one on one, this old one wouldn’t necessarily be your match. However, if we work together, you two will have no chance.”

“That may not be the case,” Yun Jianyue said with a snort. Even though she knew he was right, as the Devil Sect master who had experienced seas of blood and mountains of corpses, there was no way she would just accept her fate.

“Either way, without me, none of you will be able to take that flying boat and leave this place,” Wang Youjun said coldly. “Furthermore, you need me to help you look for your friends, so just obediently follow us. You two are different from those expendables and have proven your ability. In the future, as long as you remain loyal to the Wang clan, there will naturally be endless glory and wealth for you to enjoy.”

Yun Jianyue laughed loudly and said, “You’re right. Indeed, you have the advantage right now. However, you all have one weakness.”

“And that is?” Wang Youjun replied with a frown.

“You don’t have enough time,” Yun Jianyue said with a cold snort. “When you were talking to us, you looked in that stone forest’s direction several times. It’s clear that you’ve managed to temporarily weaken the lightning through sacrificing the lives of those people, but after some time passes, the lightning will return.

“If you really chose to fight against me, even if we can’t win, we can definitely stall for enough time for the lightning to return. Then, you won’t have enough sacrifices to use again.”

Wang Youjun’s expression changed. He couldn't help but give her a deep look, saying, “The lady is an extraordinary person, as expected. You have such sharp insight. Fine, you two can stay here and wait for us. When we come out again, we’ll bring you back to the continent. At the same time, I’ll fulfill what I promised you two as well.”

“First tell me what you’re actually looking for here,” Yun Jianyue said, staring him down.

Wang Youjun was a bit hesitant, but after giving the stone forest another glance, he quickly said, “We came in search of the sect master’s remains. As a disciple of the Divine Firmament Sect, we can’t just leave our sect master’s corpse in the wilderness.”

Yun Jianyue chuckled and replied, “Who are you trying to fool? Someone like you who reaps the souls of others without a moment’s hesitation, someone who treats your subordinates like cannon fodder, would actually so earnestly look for your deceased sect master’s corpse?”

Xie Daoyun was inwardly amazed. She had been completely overwhelmed by anger earlier, but big sister Yun was much shrewder. She had been able to realize the truth from their limited information.

A hint of anger flashed through Wang Youjun’s eyes. With his status, he clearly wasn’t used to being put in a difficult situation by others. However, Yun Jianyue had fully grasped his weakness, so he could only suppress his anger and say, “Sect Master Sun usually carried three records on him. They are extremely precious.”

Yun Jianyue finally understood what was going on. The records were probably even more precious than Wang Youjun let on, which was why he was willing to pay such a huge price to search for them here.

“Alright, we’ll go with you then,” Yun Jianyue said.

“Big sister Yun!” Xie Daoyun exclaimed, panicking. She really didn’t want to help these people.

Yun Jianyue secretly said, “We need to use this chance to seize Sun En’s talismans. If they manage to get them first, we’ll be dead for certain.”

They could still fight it out right now, but if Wang Youjun’s group got their hands on the three talismans, their power would instantly skyrocket. At that point, the two women would definitely not be a match. They could only follow along and wait for an opportunity to act. Xie Daoyun was smart, so she quickly understood the reasoning and no longer protested.

Wang Youjun frowned. After telling her his objective, he didn’t really want them to go with him. But when he saw that the lightning was starting to gather, he didn’t have any time to waste and said, “Then just follow us.” Afterward, he ordered the elders to watch for any strange movements from the two women.

When the group entered the stone forest, sure enough, no more of the terrifying lightning appeared. Even so, there was still some weaker electricity arcing past from time to time. Still, everyone present was a powerful expert, so they each had their own methods of dealing with it. Even so, they could still feel the power of absolute destruction invading their bodies. If the electricity accumulated to a certain point, even if it wasn’t the same as the terrifying lightning from before, it would still be enough to take their lives.

Thus, the group didn’t dare to waste even a bit of time. They frantically ran ahead. They were just barely out of the stone forest when the terrifying lightning storm gathered once more. They could feel its terrifying power even from far away, leaving their faces deathly pale.

Yun Jianyue couldn't help but ask, “How are we going to leave later?”

“Don’t worry, Sect Master Sun had a High Firmament Record that can control lightning,” Wang Youjun replied absentmindedly. He continued to stare straight ahead.

There was an elevated platform a couple of hundred meters ahead, with steps on all sides. At the very top was a giant seat carved out of stone. On it sat a charred corpse that seemed to have ended up that way after being struck by lightning. Even though they were only skeletal remains, they were still surrounded by a terrifying aura that gave people goosebumps.

Even more alarmingly, there were three rune talismans slowly floating in the air around the remains. They were clearly the Divine Firmament Sect’s three divine records!
