Chapter 1834: Big Sister Likes White, I Like Black

“Let us go back! Even if we have to die, we need to subdue this guy!” the Ghost King cried fiercely. She was furious that she had been schemed against by the Lord of Black Mist. Even though she was in terrible condition, and could die at any time, she still couldn't let that demon roam free.

Lord of Black Mist’s expression changed. He subconsciously backed up, because he really was worried that she would try to take him down with her. This Demon-Suppressing Talisman had already been destroyed, but even though it could no longer subdue all of the monsters in the great tomb, dealing with him alone wasn’t too big of an issue at all. He didn’t want all of his hard work to end up only benefiting others.

Suddenly, a burst of cracks audibly filled the air. The last bit that was holding the Demon-Suppressing Talisman together could no longer hold on and fractured completely. The surrounding constellations also darkened.

The Lord of Black Mist finally felt at ease. He said with a laugh, “Haha, this talisman is now finished! After another ten breaths of time, this entire great formation will also be destroyed. All of us will be free once more.” Without the Demon-Suppressing Talisman, why would he still worry about those two, who were already seriously injured by that being and could die at any time?

The Green-Robed Bug King and Blood Devil had smirks on their faces too. They had been locked up for so many years, and now, they finally saw hope of leaving.

Hmph, we’ve suffered for so many years. Once we leave, the first thing we’ll do is suck out the blood essence of endless creatures and eat to our heart’s content!

“Hurry and leave, big brother Zu!” Jing Teng exclaimed. As she sensed that unspeakable being closing in, she started to panic. Now that the Demon-Suppressing Talisman was already destroyed, the situation was already set in stone. Her only thought was for Zu An to be safe.

Zu An didn’t respond to her; instead, he pointed at the Demon-Suppressing Talisman. He immediately used Keyboard Come, saying, “Return to your strongest state!” For fear that Jing Teng might get sucked back in, he didn’t even dare to try to restore it himself.

Everything instantly fell silent, as if the entire world had stopped for a moment. A burst of divine light surged behind Zu An. All those present were stupefied, as if they had seen a legendary deity.

The Demon-Suppressing Talisman that had been torn to pieces came together again. The cracked portion shone with rainbow light, and the cracks closed rapidly at a visible rate. However, Zu An’s body suddenly began to break down again, even more quickly than earlier.

When she saw that, Jing Teng’s face turned deathly pale. She opened her mouth and wanted to scream, but she was worried that it would blow him to pieces.

Meanwhile, the Lord of Black Mist and the other devils were overjoyed. At first, when they saw that the Demon-Suppressing Talisman was restored, they felt as if they had been thrown into a frozen cellar. They thought that everything was over. But now, they sighed in relief. That skill had a cost that was hard to endure, as expected. There was no way that pretty boy could continue to use it forever.

Just then, a voice spoke in Zu An’s ear. “Freeloader skill activated!”

Soon after, Zu An’s crumbling body was restored again.

The Lord of Black Mist and the other devils were stunned.

This brat is cheating! Just how did he recover? Why? It’s such a powerful skill, so how can it not have any consequence at all?

“Big brother Zu!” Jing Teng exclaimed in surprise and happiness, hugging Zu An. Even the Ghost King could feel her joy, a grin appearing on her lips too.

However, just then, cracks began to appear on Zu An’s body again. It turned out that the power that the Demon-Suppressing Talisman needed was much greater than even the power previously used for destroying that being’s clone. Zu An’s body couldn't handle his body completely breaking down from repairing the divine talisman, followed by the recovery process after using the Freeloader skill.

When Jing Teng saw that, her entire body started shaking. There weren’t many things in this world that were more tragic than losing what one had just obtained. The drastic change from extreme joy to extreme sorrow made her feel as if her soul were about to leave her body. If not for the worry she had for Zu An, her serious wounds could well have just caused her to die on the spot.

The other devils roared with laughter when they saw that.

“I was just about to say, how could there be such a ridiculous skill in this world?”

“Whenever we devils entice humans, the principle we follow is always ‘if you wish to obtain something, you must give up even more’. This kid actually didn’t even understand something like that!”

“Hmph, he actually had the delusional idea of repairing the damaged Demon-Suppressing Talisman with his ant-like strength? Does he really think he’s the son of heaven or something?”Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“He has no idea what kind of thing the Demon-Suppressing Talisman is. If there’s nothing more he can do, I’m going to pluck that damn head of his off and give it to you guys to use as a soccer ball!”

…

Zu An clenched his teeth tightly and frantically used the Primordial Origin Sutra to recover. He also used the Heaven Devouring Sutra and Kun Peng power to suck away the destructive force.

However, Keyboard Come’s rebound was in the domain of natural law. It was damage that took place on the most fundamental level. Everything he did merely slowed down the process a little bit. His body still broke down at a visible rate.

“Freeloader skill activated!”

A trace of light suddenly swept over him, and Zu An’s disintegrating body quickly recovered.

The Lord of Black Mist, Green-Robed Bug King, and Blood Devil were utterly stunned.

At almost the same instant, the demon-suppressing great formation was finally successfully repaired. It released dazzling golden light, sending a vast amount of holy power in all directions.

The constellations in the sky that had already grown dim lit up one after another. At first, they were a bit slow, but eventually, they lit up faster and faster. Many of the stars that had already fallen gradually rose again, becoming vaguely connected by some radiance and forming complicated constellations.

This was the true Heavenly Demon-Suppressing Great Formation!

The devils screamed in alarm. They didn’t dare to stay for a moment longer and frantically fled. However, the stars in the sky suddenly flashed. Several streaks of divine light surrounded the Lord of Black Mist’s body. Miserable screams filled the air. The three incredibly powerful devils began burning under the divine light. They started looking like light chunks of wood that were lit on fire, eventually only leaving behind ashes and sparks. A cold breeze blew past, and even those traces disappeared.

Three bitter screams emerged from the floors above. Now that a portion of their souls were destroyed, they had suffered tremendous damage to their vitality. It would probably take them an extremely long time before they would completely recover.

The great tomb had previously been trembling and shaking, filled with the roars of all sorts of great devils, but now, it all became shockingly quiet. Those devils were clearly scared and didn’t dare to attack their gates anymore. They all remained silent, pretending to be asleep.

The Devil-Suppressing Talisman released another powerful streak of divine light. It received the support of all of the constellations above, firing that light in a certain direction. It was aiming at where that unspeakable being was!

Waves of terrifying ripples spread outward. It was clear that the being was trying to resist. However, as time went on, the power it had gradually accumulated instead slowly waned. That being clearly couldn't withstand the Heavenly Demon-Suppressing Great Formation at its strongest either. It roared in unwillingness, but in the end, that terrifying aura disappeared. When they sensed that even that kind of being had been defeated, the other devils could only accept the situation and give up on any attempts to escape.

Just then, even more streaks of light emerged, traveling upward. They surrounded every floor’s prison, and the runes that had been about to disappear lit up again.

Countless devils roared furiously in shock and fear. They had been imprisoned here for countless years, but finally saw a chance to plant a seed of evil in the will of the talisman. They had been about to break out already, and yet they still ended up falling short at the last second. Now, the Heavenly Demon-Suppressing Great Formation had returned to its strongest state. It didn’t seem as if they would have another chance in the foreseeable future.

How unbearable…

Zu An was left breathing heavily, and his entire body was already covered in cold sweat. He was extremely thankful that he’d still had two uses of Freeloader left. Otherwise, he would have met his end right here. He had wanted to leave one use behind as a trump card against Zhao Han, but he hadn’t expected one use of Freeloader to actually be insufficient to repair the divine talisman.

He looked at that divine talisman with lingering fear. Earlier, he could sense that it was like a terrifying black hole. It had tried to suck him dry countless times, and had ended up using up two uses of Freeloader. It was lucky that he had already become one with Jing Teng in spirit and in flesh earlier, which meant he had some of the talisman’s aura on him. Otherwise, it could well have been useless even if he had several more uses of Freeloader.[1]

Jing Teng and the Ghost King stared at the Demon-Suppressing Talisman that was shining like a sun above them with looks of disbelief, exclaiming, “It was actually just repaired to full strength?”

They were wills born from the talisman, so they naturally understood it best. The talisman really had recovered to its strongest state, and it didn’t even need them inside it. It didn’t need them to sacrifice their consciousness to repair its foundation. Didn’t that mean they really were free now?

The Ghost King couldn't help but say with a sigh, “Big sis, the man you chose really isn’t bad. The first one you chose was me, and the second one was him.”

Jing Teng rolled her eyes, thinking, You really know how to praise yourself. How can you compare to him?

As if sensing what she was thinking, the Ghost King’s face also heated up.

“Big brother Zu!” Jing Teng cried, looking at Zu An while overwhelmed with emotion.

Having barely escaped a disaster, Zu An lowered his head to kiss her.

“Hey, hey, hey, I’m still inside her body! Don’t… Don’t reach that tongue in…” the Ghost King protested, feeling flustered.

Jing Teng felt embarrassed and panicked. Her chest rose and fell rapidly. Then, her eyes rolled backward and she fainted.

“Tengteng, what’s wrong?” Zu An exclaimed, looking around in alarm.

Jing Teng opened her eyes again, but her expression was now completely different from before. She pushed him away and said, “Don’t hug me for no reason.”

Zu An was shocked, asking, “Ghost King?”

“What Ghost King? That sounds so gross. Of course you should call me Jing Teng too,” the Ghost King replied. When she saw his strange expression, she was a bit annoyed. She eventually said, “Forget it. Big sister likes to wear white stockings, but I like black stockings a bit more. In the future, you can just call me Dark Jing Teng.”

She suddenly asked, “By the way, do you like white stockings or black stockings more?”

“I like…” Zu An began before choking. He had almost blurted out the wrong thing. He exclaimed, “Is this the time to be talking about that?!”

“Why not? I feel that big sister is already too old for that innocent white-stockinged look, and yet she still likes it. I really can’t take it,” Dark Jing Teng muttered.

“What is going on with your big sister?” Zu An asked. He wasn’t in the mood to argue with her about these things at all. He looked at her unhappily and continued, “Did you possess her body?”

“What do you mean, possess? This was my body to begin with.” Dark Jing Teng harrumphed, then said in an emotional tone, “Big sis is about to die, and so am I.”

1. When he got the skill, Zu An had three uses. He used one to defeat the being’s clone, and then the remaining two were used to repair the divine talisman. ☜
