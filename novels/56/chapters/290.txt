Chapter 290: Why Can’t I?

Translator: Pika

Chu Zhongtian panicked. He rushed to check on the estate’s valuables.

From the way her father was acting, Chu Huanzhao assumed that something big had happened. She followed him anxiously.

Chu Zhongtian examined the clan’s treasures carefully, but discovered nothing missing. The extremely vital spiritual creek that they possessed had already been contaminated for a long time.

Did I overthink things? Chu Zhongtian called over the servant named Jin Zhu, and asked him where exactly he had brought Qiu Honglei.

Jin Zhu was puzzled. “Didn’t the master tell me to bring the lady to the young master’s room?”

Chu Zhongtian had a blank look on his face. “When did I say that?”

“Lady Qiu said you did,” Jin Zhu replied in a deadly earnest manner.

Chu Zhongtian was speechless.

Why does our estate have so many of these marvels? Cheng Shouping has already given us more than enough headaches, now we have to deal with this Jin Zhu too?

Chu Huanzhao was quick to pick up on his words. “She went to brother-in-law’s room? This woman is so shameless!” Chu Huanzhao instantly erupted in anger. She rushed towards Zu An’s residence, fuming with rage.

Chu Zhongtian’s eyebrows climbed high up his forehead. He noticed that his daughter had indeed brought her Wailing Whip with her.

He immediately took off after her, fearing that something bad could happen.

...

Qiu Honglei and Pei Mianman traded punches and kicks, their fight surpassing over a hundred blows exchanged. They had progressed from the initial feel-each-other-out sparring to full-blown, no-holds-barred combat.

After such a brutal slog, both suffered considerable internal injuries.

“Name yourself, bitch!” Pei Mianman demanded fiercely, gasping for air as the two combatants took a small breather.

She’d been here early, happily waiting for Zu An’s return. Who would have expected this random woman to pop up?! This jarring reality was so different from her expectations, it left her hopping mad.

Qiu Honglei refused to be outdone. “And which bitch might you be?”

Each of them was wondering who the other woman was. Was she Zu An’s friend or foe?

Unfortunately, neither was able to make any headway in piercing the other’s identity. There was still so much they didn’t know about each other.

The two of them harbored ulterior motives, and neither was willing to ask the other about their relationship with Zu An, out of fear of being exposed.

The two of them leaped in for another round. Both struck at the other’s chest.

Huh? Why are these boobs so big?

This woman isn’t inferior to me! I never knew Ah Zu had someone like this by his side!

...

The fight grew more and more intense. Suddenly, Pei Mianman was startled by the sound of hurried footsteps approaching. “Count yourself lucky this time!” she spat coldly.

She didn’t want the Chu clan finding out that she was here, so she couldn’t stay to finish her fight with this woman.

Hmph! Just a trifling fifth rank! I’ll make sure to make you regret this the next time I see you!

She leaped away in a flash. Her movement technique granted her extreme speed, and her silhouette disappeared into the darkness of night.

Qiu Honglei rubbed her chest, a hint of pain flashing across her face. That bitch had some really fierce moves. If I hadn’t been afraid of alarming the Chu clan, I would have already killed you a hundred times over!

Hmph, just a trifling fifth rank!

“Qiu Honglei, get out here this instant!”

The angry shout of a young lady rang out from a distance away.

Is that the foolish second daughter? She had obviously carried out a thorough investigation of the Chu clan before she made her move, and possessed a good understanding of all of the important people here.

She thought about smoothening her messy clothes, but hesitated a moment before deciding to walk out in her current state.

“What happened to you?” Chu Huanzhao had originally come to denounce her, but when she saw the other party’s obvious distress, she subconsciously swallowed those words.

Chu Zhongtian was stunned as well. Qiu Honglei’s clothes and hair were a mess, and her face was flushed an enchanting pink. There was a sheen of sweat on her forehead. All of this made her seem even more seductive, even more lovely and endearing.

“Lady Qiu, what happened?” Chu Zhongtian instinctively echoed his daughter’s words.

“Brightmoon Duke! A woman came out of nowhere and attacked me! If it wasn’t for Brightmoon Duke’s timely arrival, I might have... might have...” Qiu Honglei’s face was already dripping with tears as she spoke. After spending so much time in Immortal Abode, she already mastered the art of crying. Her sobs seemed heartbreakingly genuine, and filled the hearts of others with pity.

“A woman?” Chu Zhongtian was taken aback. He subconsciously glanced at his daughter.

Chu Huangzhao grew nervous. “What are you looking at me for? I’ve been with you all this time!”

Chu Zhongtian went inside to take a look.

Seeing the chairs and tables in a mess, Chu Zhongtian’s expression grew strange. “Lady Qiu is also a cultivator?”

Why don’t I sense any traces of ki from her body?

“I am not a true cultivator—I’ve only learned a few tricks. After all, I needed some way to protect myself in a place like the Immortal Abode.” Qiu Honglei had an excuse at hand.

Chu Zhongtian nodded. This explanation made sense. He gave the place a cursory examination. “It seems like the mysterious intruder couldn’t see things clearly either, because of the darkness.”

Qiu Honglei hurriedly added, “I’m sure that Brightmoon Duke’s quick arrival made the thief run away in a panic!”

Even though Chu Zhongtian wasn’t usually affected by feminine charms, he still felt a surge of pride at being praised by a beauty. “Our Chu clan has still been negligent, and it has caused Lady Qiu to suffer a scare. You said that this thief was a woman?”

“That’s correct. She’s a woman, and quite a young one at that.”

But her breasts are so big! Naturally, she didn’t say that last part out loud.

“A woman...” Chu Zhongtian was perplexed. Why are there so many intruders recently? Are all of these a coincidence?

We really need to strengthen the security around here.

With that in mind, he said, “Lady Qiu, this area is a bit further out, so the security might be slightly more lax. Servants! Bright Lady Qiu to a guest room to rest.”

He obviously wouldn’t let his own son-in-law sleep with this woman.

Qiu Honglei didn’t object at all. “Thank you, Brightmoon Duke.”

She cursed inwardly. It’s all that mysterious woman’s fault. I could’ve further deepened my relationship with Ah Zu if not for her.

After sending Qiu Honglei off, Chu Zhongtian called over the butler Hong Zhong and ordered him to further strengthen the estate’s defenses. There had been too many incidents lately.

Chu Huanzhao was sent to check on the condition of her older sister. Along the way, she realized that she had originally gone to settle things with that vixen. Why had she let her go just like that?

However, she was reminded of the sorry state that the other woman had been in, and her anger dissipated slightly. She felt a strange affinity to whoever that mysterious woman was. She had really helped vent some of her anger.

However, her light mood only lasted a short while. Even though she was usually carefree, she was someone who made a clear distinction between pretty and ugly.

She had always thought that Qiu Honglei’s reputation was unfounded. After all, just how pretty could she be?

Now that she had seen her with her own eyes, she had to admit that the girl was ridiculously beautiful. Every single motion of hers fully displayed a woman’s graceful bearing.

She looked at her own unflattering chest. “Even hers are so big...” she mumbled quietly.

“What did you say?” Qin Wanru was standing guard outside her daughter’s room when she suddenly noticed her youngest mumbling to herself as she walked over.

“Nothing.” Chu Huanzhao’s gaze flickered. When she saw her own mother’s impressive chest, she felt even more depressed.

Why couldn’t I inherit that from my mom? I wouldn’t have a need to be scared of that Qiu Honglei, otherwise.

“Is it really nothing?” Qin Wanru reached out a hand to stroke Chu Huanzhao’s head, taking note of her daughter’s unnatural expression. Something had happened to her oldest daughter—she really didn’t want something to happen to her youngest as well.

Chu Huanzhao’s face turned red. She hurriedly changed the topic, “It’s really nothing! How is big sis?”

It was Qin Wanru’s turn to blush. “Your brother-in-law is... carrying out the treatment.”

A huge smile blossomed on Chu Huanzhao’s face when she heard about this. “Brother-in-law is amazing! I’ll have brother-in-law treat me if I get sick in the future!”

Qin Wanru immediately turned pale with fright. “No way, absolutely not!”

“Why?” Chu Huanzhao was bewildered. She couldn’t figure out why her mom would act like this.

“Don’t ask why. If I say no, then no.” Qin Wanru’s face flushed in anger as Zu An’s treatment method came to her mind.

“Why is it okay for big sis but not for me? Mom, you’re being unfair!” Chu Huanzhao was already unhappy because of her thoughts about Qiu Honglei. Her mind drifted to memories of how her mother had always praised her big sister since they were young. Even though she never said anything outright, every single child still wanted to be the one most well-liked by their parents.

All of her pent up feelings came to the fore, and her tears began to pour out. She turned around and ran off, not looking back no matter how Qin Wanru called out to her.

“This child!” Qin Wanru stamped her foot angrily. Chu Chuyan was in critical condition right now, so she didn’t dare leave the doorstep. Stamping her feet was the most she could do.

Foolish child, do you even know how your brother-in-law is treating your big sister? Would you really be willing to be treated by him?

It’s all that Zu An’s fault!

You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for 531 Rage points!

Inside the room, Zu An shivered. What does this woman have against me? Why is she getting angry at me at such a time?

Chu Chuyan noticed that something was off with him. “What’s wrong?” she asked, her voice somewhat distorted.

She jumped in fright, not daring to believe that this was her own voice. She had never spoken with such an ambiguous voice before. However, all of this seemed completely natural.

Zu An smiled. “Nothing.”

Hmph, your mom’s always bullying me. It’s only right that I collect interest from your body.

...

Qin Wanru’s legs were about to give out, having stood for so long. The room door finally opened. Zu An came out, fully dressed.

She glared at him. Are you some kind of animal? How much time do you need?

But there was no way for her to say such a thing out loud. “How is Chuyan?” She asked instead.

Zu An replied, “She’s out of the danger zone. She should make a full recovery after a few more sessions. That should completely wipe out the illness at its roots.”

Qin Wanru was stunned. “You need... a few more sessions?”

“Yup.” Zu An’s face colored slightly. This was actually his own selfish intention. After today, Chu Chuyan’s condition had already improved considerably. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

However, he still had the final say in this matter. Wouldn’t he be an idiot if he let this great opportunity go?

Qin Wanru’s expression flickered several times. In the end, she refrained from saying anything at all. Instead, she hurriedly entered to check on her daughter’s condition.

Zu An wondered if it would be too cold of him to leave now. However, now that a mother and daughter were chatting in private, it would be rather awkward for him to linger.

Just as he was about to leave, a flustered Yue Shan rushed over. “Where is Master and Madam? Something major has happened!”
