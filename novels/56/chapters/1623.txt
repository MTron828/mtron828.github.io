Chapter 1572: Meeting and Separation

The empress said indifferently, “Your majesty speaks too seriously. This humble wife’s loyalty to you is without equal. How could I dare to carry a grudge?”

Her heart suddenly skipped a beat when she said that, because she could feel the thing that had been shot into her earlier seemingly about to flow out. No matter how shrewd she was, saying such words to Zhao Han in this situation still made her feel a bit embarrassed.

Zhao Han harrumphed in response, clearly a bit unhappy about her attitude. However, when he noticed her brief frown, he still asked out of concern, “What is it? Your body seems to be uncomfortable. Should this emperor call over the imperial physician?”

“There is no need. This humble wife is not uncomfortable at all right now. On the contrary, I feel better than ever before,” the empress replied. She felt a trembling from her very soul as she recalled what had just happened.

At first, when she heard that Zhao Han was coming, she had been utterly horrified. However, after they averted disaster, she had begun to reminisce about what had just happened. It really was an experience like no other. Perhaps she would never feel more bliss in this lifetime.

Inside the cabinet, Zu An had a strange expression. This woman seemed to be saying those things for him to hear! He thought, Sigh, it’s still people like her who know how to mess around in the palace best.

Zhao Han just assumed the empress was saying the opposite of what she was thinking and didn’t suspect anything. He said, “This emperor is going to carry out the Fengshan ceremony in Violet Mountain soon. You should come with me.”

“This humble wife has heard about the Fengshan matter too. I need to congratulate your majesty for completing such a glorious achievement. You have reached a level no one has reached before, and no one will reach in the future,” the empress replied. Her tone was humble, but it seemed to be somewhat lacking sincerity and enthusiasm. “But this humble wife is already a cripple and cannot move as I want to, so I will not participate in the Violet Mountain events. I hope that your majesty can forgive me.”

Zhao Han carefully looked at her, seemingly trying to discern whether she was speaking her true thoughts. The empress had already composed herself, however, and she calmly looked back at him. If there was anyone in the world who wasn’t scared of Zhao Han, it was her.

After a while, Zhao Han sighed and said, “It’s fine. Then you should remain in the capital and slowly nurse your body. In the meantime, you can help me look after the capital.”

The empress’ eyelids lowered as she said, “This humble wife finds it difficult to even take care of herself, so how could I have the extra energy to take care of the capital’s situation?”

Zhao Han’s expression darkened. The empress’ words always carried some sharpness to them, which really made him annoyed. A while later, he said, “Empress, help me carry out a divination for this trip. For some reason, this emperor just cannot feel at ease.”

Zu An suddenly realized what was going on. No wonder the emperor’s temper was so good this entire time. It was because he had come to ask the empress for something!

Even someone as powerful as Zhao Han still has to ask the empress to carry out a divination! It seems like her skills in this field are far greater than I imagined.

The empress replied, “It is very auspicious, of course!”

Zu An had a strange expression when he heard the response. That’s exactly the opposite of what she just told me!

Zhao Han was a bit unhappy too, saying, “You did not even carry out a divination, and yet you are already saying that it is very auspicious?” 

The empress calmly replied, “Your majesty is without equal throughout the world. In the past, the Fiend Emperor was just about the only one who could face you, but he has already died. Who else in this world is even worth mentioning? Even if there are some covert plots, they will be nothing before your absolute strength.”

“Hahaha, well put,” Zhao Han said, feeling great joy. It wasn’t just because those words perfectly scratched his itch, but also because the empress had revealed some information; namely, that there were some schemes involved. That meant the empress had indeed carried out a divination and that she wasn’t just speaking nonsense. Besides, her judgment regarding this matter was similar to his own, so there wasn’t anything else worth worrying about.

“Empress should get some rest then. This emperor will not disturb you any longer,” Zhao Han said. As he had already achieved his objective, he naturally didn’t feel like staying behind.

“This humble wife respectfully sends off your majesty!” the empress said, kneeling down on the ground in respect.

When he saw her obedient posture and beautiful face, Zhao Han felt that the empress was especially moving today. When he thought about how he hadn’t really shown her much care, he wondered whether it was a waste of a wonderful resource.

He swallowed his saliva and reached a hand out to her.

The empress noticed his movement, and a hint of surprise flickered through her eyes. She was a woman, and a fully mature woman at that. How could she not know what the meaning in his gaze represented? She hadn’t expected the normally completely emotionless Zhao Han to actually feel something for her today.

At that instant, she was a bit alarmed. She didn’t know what to do now. She thought, Should I resist? But with his cultivation, what would that do?

But what if I didn’t resist? Then everything would be exposed! Both Zu An and I would be beyond dead. When she thought of that, she started to feel nervous. Even her body couldn't help but start to tremble.

Fortunately, Zhao Han lowered his hand, and his intoxicated expression gradually grew firm. He didn’t have much of his lifespan left, so he couldn't use up even the slightest bit of his vitality. He nodded toward the empress, then left without turning back again.

When he left, the empress fell to the ground, her body now completely weak. Zu An emerged from the cabinet and supported her. The empress reached out an arm and wrapped it around his neck, saying, “I really almost had my soul scared out of me just now…”

Zu An smiled bitterly as he replied, “Did you think it was any different for me?”

This was exactly what he had always worried about before. Back then, the first time he had screwed the empress was mainly because he had just been screwed over too badly by Zhao Han back in Westhound Tomb, so he had formed a bit of a mental knot. It had just been a form of revenge. However, once he calmed down, he had realized the risks of such a thing were too high. He had just made a trip close to the gates of hell just now, after all.

However, after having learned that even Zhao Han had to consult her, Zu An gradually felt that the empress wasn’t just a grumbling wife in the harem as he had thought. She still had many secrets waiting for him to uncover.

He was about to ask about Violet Mountain when the empress seemed to guess his intentions. She reached out a hand and pressed it against his mouth, saying, “Don’t say anything.”

Zu An had a strange expression as he thought, This woman is really crazy! Zhao Han just left, no?!

…

By the time Zu An left the Imperial Palace, his legs felt a bit unsteady. When he recalled what had just happened, he couldn't help but sigh. The empress’ entire body really was made of water. Still, he quickly sorted out his thoughts. He immediately used Blue Mallard to use some nearby water to clean his body. Then, he returned to his marquis manor.

There, Chu Chuyan was wearing a white dress. She was leaning against the railing, lost in thought as she stared into the sky. The sight formed a beautiful and natural scene.

In that instant, Zu An felt a sense of peace, as if his body and soul had been cleansed. He couldn't help but feel annoyed. Why had he been in such a rush earlier? He couldn't help but feel a wave of guilt. Before the deed, he had been as depraved as a demon; afterward, he had become as holy as a buddha.

When she saw Zu An, Chu Chuyan's expression revealed a hint of happiness as she said, “You’re back.”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What are you looking at?” Zu An asked as he walked over, stopping a few steps in front of her; it was as if he was scared he would defile her by getting any closer.

“I was watching as the white clouds gathered and dispersed, dispersed and gathered. Aren’t human meetings and separations like that as well?” Chu Chuyan replied with a light sigh.

Zu An was surprised. He could tell that she was leaving. He couldn't focus on anything else anymore and instead just grabbed her hand, asking, “You’re leaving?”

Chu Chuyan voiced her agreement, saying, “I was so happy being with you all this time, to the point where I forgot I still have to fight against that Devil Sect Saintess.”

Zu An quickly said, “You guys haven’t even set a time yet. There’s no rush, right?”

“That was the case before, but…” Chu Chuyan paused, her face reddening as she continued, “But because I was so happy being with you, the Unshakable Daoist Manual I cultivated had a backslide. I feel as if my cultivation realm has become a bit unstable. If I continue to stay by your side, my cultivation might even fall. If that happens, I won’t be a match for the Saintess. In that case, I’ll be ruining the White Jade Sect’s reputation. Besides… I don’t want to lose to her.”

Zu An was a bit upset, remarking, “This Unshakable Daoist Manual really is good for nothing. Just what kind of nonsense is Yan Xuehen teaching you?”

Chu Chuyan’s beautiful brows furrowed as he said, “You shouldn’t disrespect my master.”

Zu An had a strange expression. He thought to himself, Is this considered disrespecting her? If you knew what I’ve done to her body, what kind of reaction would you have?
