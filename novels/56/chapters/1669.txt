Chapter 1618: Absolute Nonsense

The two women were none other than the master and disciple, Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei. After successfully sneaking into Violet Mountain, Yun Jianyue had initially planned to carry out some meditation, but she couldn't stop Qiu Honglei’s enthusiasm toward everything on Violet Mountain and insistence on going to look around together. Unable to change her mind, and worried about her disciple wandering around alone while surrounded by so many daoist experts, Yun Jianyue had decided to accompany Qiu Honglei.

As the two strolled around, Yun Jianyue secretly commented on the cultivation of the passing disciples and their cultivation patterns. Coincidentally, they happened to pass by and see Zu An.

“Master, what’s wrong?” Qiu Honglei asked, noticing something strange about her master. She couldn't help but give Yun Jianyue a strange look.

“It’s nothing. I don’t want to see that person!” Yun Jianyue snapped. She took a deep breath, and only then did she calm down her restless heart a bit.

“Huh? Didn’t the two of you even fight side by side together? You should be friends now for better or for worse, right?” Qiu Honglei asked out of confusion. “Could it be that Zu An did something to let you down? Tell me what he did! I’ll be sure to teach him a lesson for you!”

It had already been a long time since they met, so Qiu Honglei was really excited. Her tone was much more casual than usual.

Yun Jianyue was alarmed. She thought to herself, It wasn’t Ah Zu who did something to let me down; rather, we did something to let you down… However, she reacted quickly. She grabbed her disciple, who was itching to rush over, and said, “What I’m saying is that I don’t want you to see him.”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Qiu Honglei broke out into tears, protesting in clear dissatisfaction, “Why? I obediently listened to you and cultivated in secret, and only now have I been allowed to go outside. Why can’t I see him yet?”

“There are too many things going on right now, and I’m worried that you might not be able to control yourself,” Yun Jianyue patiently explained. “Did you forget who we are right now? There are so many of those supposedly dignified, upright figures all around us right now. If we’re exposed, what will await us?”

“I’m not scared! With our strength, even if we can’t win against these stupid daoists, they can’t stop us from getting away either.” Qiu Honglei harrumphed.

“Just where do you get your confidence from?” Yun Jianyue replied, rolling her eyes. If they really began fighting, there were so many people present that even she wouldn’t necessarily be able to escape from Violet Mountain.

“Wasn’t it from you, master? You keep talking about how you can slaughter your way in and out of Violet Mountain however you wish. But now that I’m talking about really doing it, you can’t take it anymore?” Qiu Honglei retorted with a glare, seemingly starting to doubt her master’s previous boasts.

Yun Jianyue choked before replying, “Back then, there was only a single sect master here. All of the nine sects’ daoists are here; is that the same thing?”

“Wasn’t it easy enough to deal with back then when we were facing those Emptiness Isle people?” Qiu Honglei replied. However, her tone grew visibly weaker.

“Emptiness Isle didn’t send any of their real experts this time, most likely because they knew that their chances of victory in this Great Sects Competition weren’t great. They were just sending some people to get by. They didn’t even send a grandmaster.” Yun Jianyue said, giving her a look. “Even so, didn’t we still lose some people? These daoists can’t be looked down upon at all.”

“Whose fault is it that you wanted to look cool and didn’t want to interfere?” Qiu Honglei muttered to herself.

“What did you say?” Yun Jianyue snapped, raising her voice.

“Nothing,” Qiu Honglei replied, sticking out her tongue. “I was just going to talk to him a bit secretly… No one else would even know. Ah Zu is a smart person too, and definitely won’t tell anyone.”

Yun Jianyue sighed and said, “Even if you didn’t reveal anything, it would make things really dangerous for us later on. With that brat’s nature, do you think he would just watch if we… I mean, if you were put in danger? That he could just sit by without doing anything?”

“Even though Ah Zu always has a mischievous smile on his face, he’s a true hero deep down. Even if the entire world were his enemy, he definitely wouldn’t just stand there without doing anything; otherwise, why would I like him?” Qiu Honglei replied, a gentle expression appearing on her face.

Yun Jianyue felt a headache when she saw her disciple’s look of infatuation. If she finds out about me and Zu An, what should I do then? Ah, enmity leads to sin! She sighed and continued, “In that case, you definitely can’t expose your identity to him, because you’ll be putting him in danger too. I don’t think you want him to be endangered, do you?”

Qiu Honglei was stunned when she heard that. She nodded and said, “Master, what you say makes sense. I can’t be so selfish.”

Yun Jianyue couldn't help but sigh in relief when she saw that she had convinced her disciple. Suddenly, Qiu Honglei clung to her arm and said with a big smile, “Master, I’ve noticed that you’ve changed recently.”

“How so?” Yun Jianyue asked, her gaze darting toward Zu An from time to time. When she recalled the time they had spent in the Fiend King Court, her mind started to drift a bit.

“The Holy Sect’s people always talk in private, saying that even though master is so pretty, you’ve never been close to another man. They all thought that you were just another martial fanatic and didn’t understand love at all, but now, I’ve discovered that they were wrong. You actually understand love pretty well,” Qiu Honglei said with a look of admiration. “It’s probably just that you’ve never found a man that you liked. Don’t worry, this disciple will definitely help you look around for someone. I’ll definitely find a perfect man for you.”

“Hmph, who wants someone from you?!” Yun Jianyue snapped, feeling inexplicably guilty. “Who’s been gossiping unnecessarily in the sect? I’m going to rip off their mouths!”

“Ah! I was just joking around…” Qiu Honglei trailed off, naturally unwilling to speak their names. She knew fully well about her master’s nature, that Yun Jianyue really would act on her threats. She was about to say something when her expression suddenly stiffened. She tugged on Yun Jianyue’s sleeves and asked doubtfully, “Master, why does that attendant at Ah Zu’s side look a bit like a girl?”

Yun Jianyue had been completely focused on her internal turmoil, so she only noticed the attendant now. Her expression darkened and she hissed, “It is indeed a woman!”

The attendant had red lips and bright teeth; her skin was fair and supple. Where would anyone find such a pretty man?!

Qiu Honglei noticed that Yun Jianyue was walking toward Zu An and quickly grabbed her, protesting, “Master, what are you doing?!”

“I’m helping you kill those adulterers!” Yun Jianyue said through gritted teeth.

“Master, didn’t you just say that we couldn’t meet him right now?” Qiu Honglei asked, stunned.

“Everything has its time and place. We were actually concerned for his sake, and yet he was actually having such a good time behind my… er, the back of my precious disciple,” Yun Jianyue muttered unhappily. The worst part was that she didn’t recognize the woman, so she was clearly someone Zu An had gotten together with after the Fiend King Court.

Even though she knew this guy was a skirt-chaser, she hadn’t expected him to be like this. She recalled what had happened between the two of them. When she thought about how she was still frightened out of her mind by her inability to escape from those feelings, and yet he was completely fine and already flirting with another woman, she found it almost impossible to control herself.

I’m the freaking Devil Sect Master. Do I not have my pride?

“It’s not that serious; it’s not that bad at all,” Qiu Honglei said, starting to sweat. “I know that woman.”

She hadn’t expected her master to actually care so much about her. She felt more and more moved. I really have to choose a good man for my master in the future so she isn’t bullied by any men.

“You know her?” Yun Jianyue asked, turning around when she heard that. She looked at Qiu Honglei in suspicion. Is it another one ahead of me? Just how many women does this rascal have?

“Uh, she’s Brightmoon City Lord Xie’s daughter, Xie Daoyun. We met a few times before in Brightmoon City,” Qiu Honglei explained. “She and Ah Zu were fellow students, so it’s expected for them to be together.”

If she really let her master go over there and cause a huge fuss, wouldn’t everything her master had warned her about happen? Not even she would be able to face Ah Zu herself! If they were going to interfere when fellow classmates were chatting, she would seem really jealous! It would only benefit that vixen.

Yun Jianyue’s eyelids twitched and she asked, “Do students always act so touchy with each other nowadays?”

Qiu Honglei raised her head. She saw that the two were hugging each other, as if they were flirting. She was speechless.

“Let this master help you get rid of this adulterous couple,” Yun Jianyue said through gritted teeth.

Qiu Honglei felt a bit strange. Why did her master seem even angrier than her? It was almost as if it were her man who had cheated. However, she said with a cold smile, “There’s no need at all. Why do we have to do anything?”

Yun Jianyue was stunned, asking, “What do you mean?”

“Master, did you forget that the Chu girl just happens to be on Violet Mountain too? She’s naturally the one who should be taking care of these kinds of things. Why would considerate women like us dare to do something so petty?” Qiu Honglei replied. Even though she had a smile, it was filled with a dangerous air.

Yun Jianyue couldn't help but chuckle too, saying, “That’s more like a demoness.”

…

Meanwhile, Zu An held Xie Daoyun while asking, “What’s wrong with your foot?”

“I twisted it by accident just now. I think it should be okay though,” Xie Daoyun said, standing back up with a reddened face. She had been thinking about how they were going to sleep in the same room, leaving her in a daze. She had been so distracted that she actually fell down the stairs, straight into his arms.

“It’s good as long as you’re okay,” Zu An said, sighing in relief. At the same time, he turned around and looked into the distance. Why did he seem to have felt two waves of killing intent just now?

Because he was handsome and had all kinds of girls trying to start conversations with him, causing jealous men to constantly send him Rage points, and because of his concern for Xie Daoyun, he actually hadn’t noticed the Rage points the two Devil Sect women sent him.
