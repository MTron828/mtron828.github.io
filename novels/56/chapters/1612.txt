Chapter 1561: Torturing of the Soul

“What’s wrong?” Chu Chuyan asked, startled by her reaction.

Zheng Dan wiped the corners of her mouth with her handkerchief in embarrassment. She gave Sang Qien a look, but she really didn’t notice anything strange. She replied, “Why would you ask something like that?”

Chu Chuyan hesitated for a moment before saying, “Earlier, when she first saw Ah Zu again, her eyes were filled with pleasant surprise and friendly affection. Later, when she noticed me, her expression clearly changed. It was because of that drastic change that I noticed something.”

Zheng Dan suddenly empathized with Zu An. This woman was just too sharp… Still, she didn’t immediately refute the statement, instead replying with a smile, “Which young lady wouldn’t like such a dashing man like Ah Zu? It’s nothing unusual.”

She had to take the chance to send some wind Sang Qien’s way. Otherwise, if Chu Chuyan didn’t have any mental preparation and suddenly learned that Sang Qien was carrying her husband’s child, the shock would be too great.

Sigh, I really am going way too far for this family… Ah Zu better thank me properly later.

Chu Chuyan was briefly stunned, clearly not expecting that kind of answer. However, after thinking about it for a moment, what Zheng Dan said seemed to make sense to her. After all, Zu An was no longer the notorious good-for-nothing from Brightmoon City.

…

After some time passed, Zu An got up to leave. Now that Sang Hong was back and Chu Chuyan was also present, he couldn't just stay the night at the Sang manor, right? He told the Armed Escort Guards to protect the Sang manor well, then left with Chu Chuyan.

On the way back, Chu Chuyan wanted to say something several times, but then stopped. Zu An found it rather amusing. He grabbed her hand and said, “If you have something to say, you should just say it. Is there anything you can’t say just between the two of us?”

When she sensed the heat of his palm, Chu Chuyan felt warm inside. She shook her head slightly and replied, “It’s nothing.”

“Is it really nothing?” Zu An asked curiously.

“It really is nothing,” Chu Chuyan said with a smile. No matter how he asked, that was her reply.

Zu An was completely confused. He even began to wonder if Chuyan had found out that Sang Qien was pregnant with his child. He thought about telling her the truth, but it was a matter that would affect the Sang clan’s reputation. Furthermore, Sang Qien hadn’t gotten married yet. It wouldn’t be too good if he talked about it without discussing things with them first.

But Chuyan isn’t an outsider…

…

While Zu An was lost in conflicted feelings, they arrived back at his manor. Chu Youzhao and Murong Qinghe rushed out when they heard the news of their return.

“Big sis, brother-in-law!” Chu Youzhao exclaimed, running around the two of them a few times. She finally calmed down a bit when she saw that they weren’t hurt.

Chu Chuyan pinched her little sister’s cheeks dotingly. Then, she gave them a rough summary of what had happened. The two girls’ eyes widened as they listened; they were clearly surprised to hear about an attack in the middle of the capital’s streets.

Then, Chu Chuyan told the two of them, “It’s already late, so I’ll send you two back first.”

Chu Youzhao protested with a pout, “But I want to stay with big sis…”

Chu Chuyan said with a smile, “I have to pay the Qin clan’s seniors a visit anyway.” Even though the Qin clan’s two leaders had gone off to war, there were still many other elders at the manor.

Then, she looked at Zu An and added, “You should come with me to the Qin clan too.”

Zu An was a bit embarrassed, replying,  “It would be strange if I went, right?”

His relationship with the Qin clan couldn't be considered bad, but it wasn’t good. It would be fine if he went alone, but if he went with Chu Chuyan, he could end up being the target of some people’s ridicule and mockery.

Chu Chuyan raised a brow and replied, “Sigh, it seems you really do think we’re divorced, so you have nothing to do with the Qin clan anymore.”

Zu An revealed a forced smile and replied, “I’ll go! I’ll go, okay?”

Even someone with Chu Chuyan’s ice-cold nature could actually play such tricks too?!

When she heard that Zu An was also going to go and that they wouldn’t be separated just yet, Chu Youzhao didn’t protest anymore.

…

The group sent Murong Qinghe back first, then went to the Qin clan together.

When they heard about Chu Chuyan’s arrival, the thick-browed Qin Guangyuan and his handsome brother Qin Yongde personally emerged to receive her. Many of the Qin clan’s women emerged as well; they all surrounded Chuyan and praised her beauty.

Off to the side, Zu An was a bit embarrassed. Technically, he was the Chu clan’s young master, so he was related to the Qin clan as well. However, in order to protect the Chu clan, he and Chuyan had decided to get a divorce in name.

Fortunately, Qin Guangyuan found an opening to chat with him, asking, “I heard that you were attacked in the capital while escorting Sang Hong?”

“That’s right. They seemed to be Shadow Group’s assassins, but they used military crossbows and a city defense crossbow,” Zu An said, observing his reaction while speaking. The Qin clan was the number one military clan in the army, so that could have something to do with them.

Sure enough, Qin Guangyuan’s expression changed when he heard that. However, it was hard to say what he was thinking. His expression was somewhat gloomy. Sensing that he seemed to have realized something, Zu An chuckled and didn’t say anything else. Qin Guangyuan was a smart person too; he had definitely immediately thought of King Qi, and he naturally understood what kinds of consequences that event had brought.

Just like that, Zu An spent a few awkward hours with the Qin clan. Chu Chuyan then got up and said she was going home.

Qin Yongde couldn't help but say, “The Qin clan is your home in the capital! It’s already so late; where are you going now?”

Chu Chuyan gave Zu An, who had been sitting awkwardly the entire time but never left, a look. A hint of gentleness appeared on her face as she replied, “I’m going back to Ah Zu’s place.”

Many people from the Qin clan frowned. They all spoke up and said, “The two of you have already gotten a divorce. It’s not proper for the two of you to stay together, is it?”

Even though not even the pickiest member of the Qin clan would dare state that Zu An wasn’t outstanding, they weren’t in the same faction. The more outstanding he was, the worse it would be for the Qin clan, so they naturally couldn't bring themselves to have any good impression of him.

Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan was just too charming. Even if she had already gotten married before, she still had no lack of outstanding pursuers. It wouldn’t be difficult to select a great clan for her to be married to one day. That would be much more beneficial for both the Qin and Chu clan. However, if Chu Chuyan lived with Zu An and news of that got out, which clan would dare to take her in, no matter how pretty and outstanding she was?

Chu Chuyan said with a smile, “In the past, because of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, Ah Zu agreed to a divorce in name in order to not drag down the Chu clan. But in my heart, he has always been my husband.”

Zu An felt warm inside when he heard that. He couldn't help but hold her soft and smooth hand. Chu Chuyan, who was usually shy and bashful in that regard, actually acted out of character and gripped his hand, clearly as an expression of her firm resolve to the Qin clan.

When she saw that, Chu Youzhao thought that the scene really was wonderful, as it matched the romance she had dreamed about ever since she was little. On the other hand, however, she felt strangely lonely. Still, she was a young girl and didn’t think too much about it. She quickly leaped forward to give the two of them her support.

The Qin clan wanted to protest further, but Qin Guangyuan reached out his hand to stop them. Then, he looked at Chu Chuyan and said, “Cousin, you’ve always been smart. As you’ve already made your decision, as an older brother, I can only wish you happiness.”

Then, he turned around to look at Zu An, saying, “Brother Zu, I hope you can treat Chuyan well and not fail to live up to her sincerity.”

Zu An was rather surprised by Qin Guangyuan’s change in attitude. He said with a smile, “But of course.”

…

The two of them left the Qin clan and walked along the main street. The capital, which was usually bustling with activity, now seemed a bit somber and desolate. There were troops patrolling everywhere.

Chu Chuyan couldn't help but say, “I wonder just how many plots and schemes are happening behind the scenes today.”

“That’s something for the Emperor and King Qi to think about. It has nothing to do with us,” Zu An replied, holding her small, ice-cold hand. As he smelled her delicate and graceful fragrance, he only felt extremely comfortable and peaceful. He didn’t even want to think about the two brothers’ fight at all.

“Then why don’t you take me around the capital? It’s been a long time since I was here,” Chu Chuyan replied with a big smile, hooking her arm around his. She leaned against his shoulder.

When he saw Chu Chuyan act like a little girl, Zu An’s affection surged. At the same time, he felt guilty, because he was a total playboy. He gave up on the thought of giving her the cosmetics he had bought from Cloudcenter Commandery, instead taking her around the streets. As long as she gave something a second look, he bought it for her.

The whole trip filled Chu Chuyan with happiness and laughter. She suddenly asked, “Why are you acting like my master when she came back, giving me all of these good things?”

As she said that, she suddenly paused. Her eyes were completely clear as she continued, “There’s definitely something that happened between the two of you that you’re hiding from me.”
