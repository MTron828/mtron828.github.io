Chapter 1130: Not a Single One Is Normal

Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Even though it had recently stopped snowing in Cloudcenter Commandery, it was still incredibly cold. The people coming and going were almost all wrapped up tightly in heavy clothes.

And yet, the woman standing in front of Zu An was dressed lightly. Her long and straight legs were only covered in black stockings, drawing the attention of all the men walking by. Even though she was clearly extremely beautiful, people’s eyes still couldn't help but be drawn toward those legs. Her snow-white skin formed a powerful contrast with her black stockings’ lace border. Just a single glance would make it hard to shift one’s gaze away.

If anyone else dressed like that, they might easily appear flirtatious and seductive. And yet, when she wore them, it carried no such worldly feeling at all. That, paired with her slender and elegant neck, as well as her delicate hair bun, made her seem even more noble and refined.

Zu An was surprised and happy to see her. He asked, “Big sis principal, why are you here?”

Considering those distinct stockings and those long and beautiful legs, who else could it be but Jiang Luofu?

“What, are you not happy to see me?” Jiang Luofu replied with a smile.

“Of course I am! I’m so happy that I can’t believe what I’m seeing,” Zu An said as he walked over, feeling extremely moved.

“That mouth of yours is just as sweet as usual,” Jiang Luofu remarked, turning to stand shoulder to shoulder with him. She asked, “Should we find a place to sit down first?”

“Okay,” Zu An replied. There were too many eyes and ears watching the temporary residence. She clearly had something to say to him. As such, he brought her to a nearby teahouse.

The teahouse was bustling with people, who were all chatting happily at their respective tables. When Jiang Luofu entered, however, the entire building fell silent. None of the customers’ eyes could leave her legs.

Jiang Luofu was already used to such sights. She walked past them naturally, her high heels tapping against the ground. The sounds those high heels made seemed as if they were pounding down on the onlookers’ very hearts, making their heartbeats pound just as fiercely.

Zu An sighed in amazement. Only someone with Jiang Luofu’s powerful presence could properly intimidate the masses. If it were anyone else, a bunch of perverts would already have surrounded a woman as pretty as her.

As those beautiful legs disappeared step by step into the second floor, waves of sighs followed. Then, all the conversations changed as people tried to guess which clan this woman was from. They all began trying to figure out her family background.

“You seem to be laughing at me,” Jiang Luofu remarked, looking at Zu An with an ambiguous smile when they arrived in a private room upstairs.

“It’s not that I’m laughing at you, but that I’m worried you might be cold,” Zu An replied. He had seen that even though there was a fur coat covering the upper half of Jiang Luofu’s body, her lower half was only covered by a skirt and black silk stockings. He felt as if even his own legs were becoming cold just from looking at her.

“Aren’t beautiful things meant to be appreciated?” Jiang Luofu replied naturally with a chuckle.

Zu An really wanted to drag Yan Xuehen over and have her hear that. Wearing pants under a dress, is that something a human would do?

“Furthermore, an ordinary person might feel cold if they were dressed like this, but we’re cultivators, so what is there to worry about?” Jiang Luofu crossed her legs in a different posture as she spoke.

Zu An was stunned. Onlythen did he realize that he had only subconsciously felt that Jiang Luofu might be cold because Yu Yanluo feared the cold.

Right, we’re all cultivators. Who cares about a bit of cold?

Yu Yanluo’s cultivation is so high, so the fact that she’s scared of the cold is strange in itself.

Now that he thought about it, that was probably a characteristic of the Medusas. The Snake race preferred hotter climates rather than colder ones to begin with. They would go into hibernation as soon as winter hit. Even though the Medusas were higher-level and didn’t need to go into hibernation, winters would definitely be uncomfortable for them.

“Transcendent aptitude really is frightening. When I had just known you, you had just begun to cultivate. And yet now, just how much time has passed? Your cultivation has already surpassed mine,” Jiang Luofu said with a sigh. She felt as if all of that were a dream or something. If she hadn’t experienced it herself, it really would be hard for her to imagine someone’s cultivation speed being so fast.

Zu An thought to himself that he hadn’t reached his current level by only relying on his transcendent level aptitude, but he couldn't really explain those details to her. He said, “Big sis principal is being too humble. I haven’t caught up to you yet; you’ve made great progress in your cultivation as well.”

Jiang Luofu rolled her eyes and said, “There’s no need for you to flatter me. I’m not the type to be envious of others. The stronger you are, the happier I’ll be.”

Zu An chuckled. He poured a cup of tea for her and asked, “When did big sis principal get here?”

“It’s already been a while. I know about quite a few of your feats,” Jiang Luofu replied. She raised the teacup to her lips, a hint of a smile appearing in her eyes.

Zu An was alarmed. Why did she sound all secretive? He quickly said, “It’s a good thing that big sis came; your fellow junior sister is in trouble…” He gave her a rough summary of Yu Yanluo’s identity and their experiences.

“That was the same matter I wanted to talk to you about this time,” Jiang Luofu said in a deeply moved manner. “At first, I was confused as to why my teacher sent me to Cloudcenter Commandery, but it turns out it was because of that. I didn’t know that Yu Yanluo was precisely our mysterious sixth sister.”

Zu An was stunned. The libationer’s deep and profound appearance emerged in his mind. What in the world is he thinking? If you knew something was going to happen here, why didn’t you try to stop it beforehand?

“That third brother of yours really is too unreasonable! He even did something like this to his own fellow junior sister,” he couldn't help but say disdainfully.

“Third brother experienced some things in the past. I was even convinced that he had passed on. But now, not only is he alive, his cultivation has even climbed up a notch. Even though he looks slovenly and drunk all day, his sword dao is still something few can match,” Jiang Luofu said, feeling deeply moved. “The reason third brother acted that way is probably because of what happened back then.”

“Just how are he and Manman’s mother related?” Zu An asked curiously. He couldn't help but feel that their relationship was strange somehow. He definitely didn’t want to gain some weird father-in-law out of nowhere.

Jiang Luofu hesitated, but in the end, she said, “You’re not an outsider anymore, so there’s no harm in telling you these things. Still, you can’t tell anyone about this, or else it might bring great harm to Pei Mianman.”

Zu An was stunned. Judging from how she was talking about the subject, it seemed there was a huge drama surrounding it. “Of course.”

Jiang Luofu then said, “Third brother possessed powerful comprehension prowess. At a young age, he had already fully inherited teacher’s sword. Teacher had personally evaluated him back then, stating that he was destined to break through into the grandmaster rank.”

Zu An already knew that even though there were many cultivators in this world, there were extremely few who could become grandmasters. There were countless stunning talents who failed to pass that great trial. For Xiao Yao to have received such an evaluation at his young age, it was easy to see just how high his comprehension prowess was.

Jiang Luofu began to recount the events of the past. “For fear that he would become proud and arrogant, which would actually become unfavorable for his cultivation, teacher sent him into the world of warriors to train himself. Third brother relied on his sword to carve out a reputation for himself. There were even some who called him the Sword Immortal. His natural disposition was to hate evil, taking it upon himself to eliminate demons. Back then, there were still many fiend race individuals left in the human side of the world who brought calamity. That was why he single-handedly wiped out many of them.”

“That continued until he met Pei Mianman’s mother.” Jiang Luofu paused. She looked at Zu An with her beautiful eyes and asked, “Do you believe in love at first sight?”

Zu An chuckle and replied, “You mean when I saw big sis principal for the first time as I entered your office?”

Jiang Luofu’s cheeks turned a bit red. She harrumphed. “You really are slick-tongued.” Even though that was what she said, she didn’t get upset and continued, “That was the case when third brother first saw Pei Mianman’s mother. However, their identities doomed them to forever be apart. In the end, third brother decided to remain true to his own dao and attacked Pei Mianman’s mother.”

“Wait.” Zu An frowned. “Wasn’t his dao eliminating evil? Why would he attack Pei Mianman’s mother? Unless…”

“Indeed.” Jiang Luofu sighed. “Pei Mianman’s mother was from the Demon Race. Didn’t you find Pei Mianman’s fire element extremely strange? It’s a pitch-black flame. That’s an ability that came from the Demon Race, and furthermore an extremely rare ability.”

Zu An was speechless.

Heavens, please stop messing with me! It was Yu Yanluo earlier, and now it’s Pei Mianman?

Can I not have a single normal girl around me?
