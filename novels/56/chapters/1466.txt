Chapter 1415: Gift

However, the women were all powerful cultivators. They quickly reacted to the situation. Yun Jianyue took out her Empress Lantern and shone it on the monster. Those with lower cultivation ranks wouldn’t be able to move beneath the Empress Lantern’s effects at all. The Yayu was more powerful than that; however, even though it didn’t completely freeze under the light’s effects, it clearly slowed down a bit.

Yu Yanluo used runes to support the others while releasing a special radiance from her eyes. It was the Medusa’s Eye!

A faint earth-yellow tinge covered the Yayu’s entire body, as if it had been covered in a layer of stone skin. Its movements became heavy and clumsy. It definitely hadn’t expected such sudden developments, making it lose its center of gravity and fall down.

I’ll be safe as long as I can get back into the water! it thought.

However, it soon widened its massive eyes in disbelief, because it saw that the Weak Water it was so familiar with actually had begun to freeze into ice. Only then did it notice a woman in white using a skill, causing snowflakes to surround her. The ice was clearly spreading because of her.

It was already too late to change directions, so the Yayu fell heavily on the sheet of ice. Spiderweb-like cracks quickly appeared on the surface.

Yan Xuehen staggered, her complexion pale. The attack had clearly made her feel awful. However, she still gritted her teeth and resolutely controlled the frozen layer, preventing the Yayu from escaping.

Zu An instantly rushed over. The Yin Yang Swords, with the support of the Fire Phoenix and Blue Mallard, drew out a beautiful arc that harmonized yin and yang perfectly. They quickly severed the Yayu’s head, and its entire body stiffened. It could no longer hold on and came crashing down on the ice.

The women sighed in relief. They had finally killed the monster!

Yan Xuehen couldn't maintain the frozen surface any longer. It soon melted, and the Yayu’s body fell into the Weak Water. They didn’t think too much of that, because Zu An had tossed its head ashore. The head was the most important part. There weren’t many creatures that could survive after having their heads removed.

“Little An, that slash of yours had a great affinity with the dao. Even I gained some enlightenment, as if I had picked up on some natural laws. Just how did you do that?” Yun Jianyue asked curiously.

Yan Xuehen also stared at him calmly with her beautiful eyes. That wasn’t the Snowflake Sword skill; it was more like something he had created himself.

Zu An raised the Yin Yang swords in his hands and said, “That slash was guided by these Yin Yang Swords. I felt a mysterious force emanate from them that helped me complete it.”

Seeing the two different glows and attributes of the swords, Yan Xuehen quickly realized what was happening, as a powerful cultivator. She said, “It must be an incredible skill that can only be displayed when forceful and gentle elements join together. You are probably the only one capable of that.”

The cultivators of this world were almost always single-element cultivators. Only a freak like Zu An would have so many different elements, and furthermore, opposing ones that clashed with each other.

Zu An said with a smile, “It’s actually because of your help that I was able to kill the monster. I didn’t expect our teamwork would be so excellent. We didn’t need to plan things out beforehand at all.”

The women were all stunned. When they thought about it, if any one of them had been missing, or if they had made the wrong decisions, they might not have been able to kill the Yayu. They hadn’t expected to be so familiar with each other after traveling together, to the point that their cooperation had already reached such a level.

Zu An looked at Yu Yanluo. The ‘buffs’ she had granted him were quite considerable, ranging from power, speed, and dexterity; all of those aspects were increased significantly.

Now that I think about it, why doesn’t she give me these buffs when we’re in bed? Alright, I’ll have to tell her to give it a try next time.

Even though Yu Yanluo wasn’t able to read what he was thinking, after they had stayed around each other for so long, she could sense a thing or two from his gaze. Her little face immediately turned red. She thought, This guy… There are still those two big sisters here…

Yan Xuehen seemed to have noticed that the two of them were exchanging looks. She said indifferently, “I am going to leave for a bit.”

Zu An was stunned. He asked, “Where are you going?”

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes and replied, “Where else? Of course, it’s to change her waistband. It was ruined trying to save you. I really don’t know what kinds of properties this Weak Water has. It even has corrosive effects.”

“What are you explaining all of that to him for?!” Yan Xuehen exclaimed in embarrassment. After all, talking about her own waistband with a man really was humiliating.

She looked at the remaining half of her waistband in her hand and felt a bit brokenhearted. The item had already accompanied her for many years, and she had always been fond of it. She hadn’t expected to lose it here.

Ah, this is bad. I don’t think I have any extra waistbands.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After all, that band had been specially made. It was capable of lengthening and shortening, and it remained clean on its own. That was why there had never been any need to prepare any extras. How could she have anticipated such an awkward scenario?

Should I borrow one from the witch? No, wouldn’t I be made fun of for that for the rest of my life?

Then what about Yu Yanluo? I don’t really want to owe her more favors, though…

She was a bit at a loss for what to do. However, Zu An saw her expression and said with a smile, “Big sis Yan, your waistband was ruined because of me, so of course I have to take responsibility. How about this? This Primal Skysilk can also lengthen and shorten, and to a certain extent, it’s quite similar to your waistband. You can just use it for that.”

The three women’s eyes immediately widened when they heard that. Yun Jianyue couldn’t take it anymore and exclaimed, “You’re giving away a heaven-grade weapon so easily just like that? And to be treated as a waistband? Isn’t this basically a betrothal gift?!”

Yan Xuehen exclaimed in shame and annoyance, “Witch, what kind of nonsense are you saying?”

This guy, really… If you do that in front of those two, isn’t that basically exposing our relationship?

Yun Jianyue gave her an unexpected look, saying, “I’m saying that it’s a betrothal gift for your disciple Chuyan. Don’t tell me you thought it was for you? Keep dreaming. Like hell a stone cold woman like you could get married.”

Yan Xuehen’s face turned completely red. She really had thought that Yun Jianyue was talking about her. How could she admit to that, though? She said, “Of course I know that you are talking about Chuyan, but I have not agreed to that marriage yet. Just a band alone, being enough to give away my precious disciple? There is no way it could be that easy.”

Yun Jianyue retorted in annoyance, “A heaven-grade weapon still isn’t enough? Does your disciple come encrusted with diamonds?”

Yan Xuehen was furious. She exclaimed, “Witch, what are you saying?!”

Yu Yanluo quickly stepped forward to mediate the situation, saying, “Big sis Yan, since this is Ah Zu’s sincerity, you should just take it.”

There shouldn’t be anything between Ah Zu and her, right? Otherwise, why would he give her such an important gift in such an overt manner?

They shouldn’t have… Right?

Zu An looked at Yan Xuehen with a gentle smile, saying, “Exactly, just take it. Otherwise, I won’t feel too good.”

Yan Xuehen felt her heart pound crazily when she saw his expression. She was worried that further rejections would make her look guilty, so she could only say, “Fine then. Out of favor for your… for your filial piety, I will reluctantly accept.”

Look at this woman saying and feeling completely different things, Zu An thought. He used the momentum to say, “In that case, let me help you put it on then.” Then, without waiting for her to say anything, he walked up to her and moved his arms around behind her to ‘air hug’ her. Then, he tied the Primal Skysilk around her waist.

When she sensed his movements and realized that she could even clearly sense the warmth of his fingers touching the skin around her waist, Yan Xuehen’s entire body stiffened. She didn’t dare move, and her heart pounded. At that moment, her strongest emotion wasn’t bashfulness; rather, she was worried that Yun Jianyue and Yu Yanluo would notice something off about their relationship.

Fortunately, Zu An didn’t take too much time and quickly tied up the Primal Skysilk. He said, praising his own work, “This looks great. The fiery redness adds a bit of liveliness to your look.”

“Red looks absolutely awful. It does not match my clothes at all,” Yan Xuehen harrumphed and replied instinctively.

“I can’t take this anymore! Stone cold woman, you’re already getting so many benefits, and yet you’re still acting like this?!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, feeling upset. She asked, “Little An, you gave her something, but what about me?”

Suddenly, Yu Yanluo cried out in alarm, “The Yayu’s head disappeared!”
