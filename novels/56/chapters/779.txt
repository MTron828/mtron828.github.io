Chapter 759: Breakthrough

Translator: Pika

Zu An removed his mask as well. He said with an ambiguous smile, “Did madam forget that there was someone else here?”

Yun Yuqing tapped her foot against the ground, and then her body slowly entered the hot spring. Only her clear and smooth shoulders, as well as her beautiful collarbone, were exposed. She said, “You’re different from other people.”

“I’m no King Wu though.” Zu An sighed. A true playboy should never let feelings get involved, but he had discovered that he couldn’t hold himself back when it was just the two of them. Sigh, isn’t being on this side of NTR just fine? Why am I playing around with feelings? I’m really going to get sucked in at this rate.

Yun Yuqing wanted to say something, but she stopped. In the end, she didn’t explain anything and only sighed deeply. An awkward silence filled the room.

Zu An was the first one to speak up. “You should take care of your poison first. We can’t delay that.”

“Okay,” Yun Yuqing replied. Then, she closed her eyes, and her hands formed complex seals. Nine runes gradually appeared in midair, and then gently descended onto the water’s surface. The runes covered the water surface in a thin layer of gold.

Then, Yun Yuqing sat down in the water with her legs crossed and began to focus on eliminating the poison. Moments later, Zu An noticed threads of black energy leave her body and dissolve into the water. The golden runes then flickered around, and the black energy was gradually refined, eventually vanishing from the pool of water.

Zu An was shocked. The legendary Demon Race was portrayed as sinister and vicious, yet Yun Yuqing was the complete opposite. It was to the extent where she had even used a formation to clean up the remaining poison, for fear that the poison would harm innocent civilians if she just let it drain away.

After some time passed, Yun Yuqing opened her eyes again. Her fair, blushing cheeks looked incredibly lovely within the rising steam. She said, “Ah Zu, I’ve already eliminated all of the corpse poison.”

Zu An sighed in relief and replied, “Looks like those two didn’t deceive us the way I expected.”

Yun Yuqing smiled and said, “They’re both important figures from the southern border. It should be of great help to you in the future if you get along with them.”

Zu An was surprised. He actually had many questions he wanted to ask her, but he was worried that their relationship would never go back to what it had been again if he asked them.

Yun Yuqing swam over to the pool’s side and said, “Ah Zu, crouch down over here.”

Zu An didn’t know why she would say such a thing. Yun Yuqing gently caressed his chest and removed the clothing he had worn to get past the gate inspection. When she saw that most of his body was soaked in blood, her fingers trembled slightly as she asked, “Does it hurt?”

“It didn’t hurt before, but now that your small hand has touched it, maybe it does hurt a little,” Zu An said with a smile.

Yun Yuqing was momentarily distracted. This was what he had said the last time he was in North Order Commandery’s King Wu Manor. She gave him an annoyed look and shot back, “Look at the situation! Despite that, you’re still making jokes.”

Zu An said, “Don’t worry, I’ve already reached the seventh rank, so I can already recover pretty quickly. I won’t die.”

Yun Yuqing shook her head. “Even though cultivators at the peak of the seventh rank have powerful regenerative abilities, a normal person might have exploded on the spot from being hit by a siege crossbow. Even though you survived through a fluke, it would take at least half a year for you to recover from this type of injury, and there might even be hidden damage. Even though you’ve already stopped bleeding, the injuries inside won’t heal so easily. Hurry and get in, I’ll help you with the treatment.” Regardless of whether it was her status as a Rune Master or as a Demon Race individual, she had corresponding healing methods.

Zu An asked with a strange expression, “Madam, aren’t you just asking for trouble here?”

Yun Yuqing looked irritated as she replied, “With our relationship, what are you worried about?”

Zu An chuckled. “Looks like I was the one being unreasonable.” Then, he took off his clothes and jumped in.

Yun Yuqing swam over and gently helped him clean the wound. At the same time, her other hand flickered with light to help him recover. She said, “It’s all my fault for coming late. That was why you ended up being injured so badly.” Her eyes began to redden, and tears glistened by the edges of her lashes.

Zu An shook his head. “If it weren’t for the fact that you had hurried over in time, I might’ve already been finished then and there.” Yun Yuqing bit her lip and didn’t say anything as she focused on treating him.

Zu An closed his eyes. Even though the Primordial Origin Sutra had already begun to repair his body, after having fought for so long, it still couldn’t compare to proactive treatment at all. He wasn’t sure if it was because Yun Yuqing was helping him, but the primordial ki’s powers seemed far stronger than usual.

He didn’t waste this chance. He gathered the primordial ki toward his wounds, and then the originally badly mangled cavity began to sizzle and heal up at a visible rate.

Suddenly, Zu An heard a ‘Ding!’ in his head. It was as if he had suddenly become enlightened with wisdom. He could clearly feel that the air around him had become more fragrant and sweet. If his primordial ki had felt as if it were flowing through a muddy countryside before, then now, it was as if it were traveling on a level county road. It flowed much, much faster.

“What is this?” Zu An exclaimed, happy and surprised.

Mi Li’s voice said in his head, “I didn’t expect a brat like you to break into the Primordial Origin Sutra’s third layer so quickly. Tsk, tsk, what kind of damn luck is this?” Her red-clothed self floated next to the Tai’e Sword in a semi-transparent state, and she didn’t manifest completely.

Zu An was pleasantly surprised and exclaimed, “You finally came out, big sis empress! You didn’t even wake up when I almost died earlier.”

Mi Li harrumphed. “I already said that you need to become someone truly strong, so you can’t think about relying on me. Furthermore, if even some low level nobodies like them could take your life, then I might as well just die too.”

Zu An was speechless. Sigh, big sis empress is still just as frank. Whatever, I’ll just treat her as a strict teacher who wants her students to do well.

“By the way, what kinds of benefits are there now that the Primordial Origin Sutra has reached the third layer?” Zu An recalled that the first layer had brought him a powerful regeneration ability, and the second had contained the ability to purge evil spirits. What did this new layer bring?

“It can make you impervious to all poisons,” Mi Li said with an ambiguous smile. “At the very least, you won’t be schemed against like the last time, when you fainted alongside the crown princess.”

Zu An blushed and said, “I was way too careless last time.”

At the same time, he was quite shaken. Being immune to poison was amazing! Even though the cultivators of this world were strong and their bodies were tough, which had eliminated many of the illnesses of his past world, the poisons of this world had instead become even stronger. Even high level cultivators might be done in by their power. He had already suffered many times himself. This poison immunity would save him a lot of worries.

“You shouldn’t feel happy too soon.” Mi Li’s expression changed as she said, “You can never use the excuse of being affected by an aphrodisiac to harass other girls again.”

Zu An immediately said in an upright manner, “Am I that type of person? I have always lived an incorruptible and upstanding life! I have always used my own charisma and charm…”

Mi i immediately cut him off. “Hah!” Her eyes shifted to Yun Yuqing, who was next to her. “Tsk tsk, this is that Madam Wu you mentioned, right? She is a beauty after all; I really feel pity…”

Suddenly, a hint of shock flashed through her eyes. She suddenly gave Zu An an angry look and exclaimed, “What the hell is up with you!? How in the world do you have so many beautiful women at your side?”

You have successfully trolled Mi Li for +33 +33 +33…

Zu An raised his chin proudly and said, “It’s obviously because of my incomparable charm.”

Mi Li’s eyelids twitched. “Don’t make me beat you up.”

Yun Yuqing said in surprise, “Your injuries recover so quickly. All of the internal organs inside of such a huge cavity have actually already regenerated!” She had been helping him all this time, so she could feel how his body was recovering.

“Haha, it’s not as if you don’t know how tough my body is,” Zu An subconsciously replied. Then, he gave Mi Li a guilty look.

Mi Li harrumphed. “What are you looking at me for? She’s already staying with you in this hot spring. If you still don’t do anything, can you even be called a man anymore?” She had always been tough by nature. When she saw Yun Yuqing’s gentle and meek appearance, she had really gotten a strong urge to bully her.
