Chapter 1623: Disturbance

“Have you heard? The White Jade Sect’s Fairy Chu actually got married before!”

“There’s no way that’s true, right? She looks so aloof and extraordinary like a goddess, and yet she’s already a madam?”

“She looks so pure and incorruptible normally. I hadn’t expected her to have lost her maidenhood a long time ago.”

“You really can know someone for a long time without knowing their true nature… She looks so proud and cold on the surface, but she might have already done all kinds of things with her man behind the scenes.”

“That’s probably just slander, right? I don’t believe that such a lofty and unsullied fairy would be that kind of woman.”

“You can deceive others, but please don’t deceive yourself. I have a friend from the White Jade Sect who has reliable news. Fairy Chu indeed got married before she entered White Jade Sect.”

“Ah… My heart is about to break.”

…

Zhang Zijang proudly reported the news to Zu An early in the morning. “Sir Zu, I thought that you were profound and unfathomable before, but today, I must truly prostrate myself in admiration toward you! Even a goddess such as Miss Chu from the White Jade Sect was actually your woman! My respect for Sir Zu gushes forth relentlessly like a river…”

“Sir Zhang, you already recovered from being knocked out by Sect Master Yan so quickly?” Xie Daoyun asked when she saw Zu An’s expression growing more and more unpleasant, quickly stopping him from saying any more.

“It’s nothing, I’m tougher than I look. If I hadn’t gone out too quickly without trying to evade, not even Sect Master Yun would be able to make me faint so easily,” Zhang Zijiang said without even feeling the slightest bit of shame.

Zu An asked, his expression darkening, “Is that what everyone outside is talking about?”

“It’s not everyone,” Zhang Zijiang began. He thought to himself for a bit and said, “Some people are loyal supporters of Fairy Chu and feel that these things are all just rumors. Some people stepped forward and explained that Fairy Chu actually only married you in name and that they weren’t truly husband and wife. Not long after you got married, you were captured by the court, while Fairy Chu was taken in as a disciple by the White Jade Sect. The two of you had already been divorced by then. In my opinion, those people really don’t know anything. How could they understand Sir Zu’s charms? How could the two of you only be husband and wife in name?”

“Sir Zhang!” Xie Daoyun cried as she saw Zu An’s expression grow darker and darker. She couldn't help but warn Zhang Zijiang not to continue.

Zhang Zijiang was stunned. Then, a ‘knowing’ expression appeared on his face. He was talking about another woman in front of Lady Xie, so of course she wouldn’t be too happy about that.

Zu An felt as if his lungs were about to explode. He naturally didn’t feel that his relationship with Chu Chuyan was anything embarrassing. However, for this information to be exposed at the present time, it was clear that the one who had started it had impure motives.

People loved gossip, and once gossip started, it was easy to add fuel to the flame. A single mistake and Chu Chuyan’s reputation would be completely ruined. Furthermore, her battle with Qiu Honglei would happen soon. If she ended up being affected by this situation, things would become really troublesome. Furthermore, the Unshakable Daoist Manual she cultivated had all kinds of restrictions too.

When Zu An thought about those things, he couldn't just stay still anymore. In a flash, he rushed toward the White Jade Sect’s courtyard.

“Who is that Zu An? He was actually Fairy Chu’s man? I really envy every single moment of his life…”

“You still don’t know? He’s an important official of the court. The State Teacher even came out personally to welcome him a few days ago.”

“Damn it! It seems even an eminent and unapproachable goddess in our eyes is nothing more than a toy in the hands of those with authority.”

Discussions filled the air all around Zu An. He thought, It seems the way young people think is similar no matter where you go…

However, he wouldn’t stoop so low as to fight with ordinary people. He headed straight for Chu Chuyan’s courtyard in alarm. Right as he approached, he saw Yan Xuehen come out.

When she saw him, Yan Xuehen’s expression darkened as she snapped, “You still have the nerve to come here? Did you forget what I told you yesterday?”

Zu An panicked and said, “Big sis Yan, I didn’t come here to anger you on purpose. It’s just that I heard too many rumors surrounding Chuyan and was worried that something would happen to her. That’s why I came here to take a look.”

“Did you spread those rumors on purpose to confirm your relationship?” Yan Xuehen asked, staring at him.

Zu An sighed and asked, “Big sis Yan, could it be that I’m such a disgraceful and shameless person in your eyes?”

Yan Xuehen’s expression eased a bit as she replied, “You are disgraceful and shameless, but I believe that you weren’t the one who did this.”

Zu An was speechless. Are you praising me or cursing me here?

“Don’t worry. Chuyan is tougher than you think. Her only weakness is you. Rumors spread by others won’t be able to affect her,” Yan Xuehen said calmly.

“Can I meet with her?” Zu An asked worriedly.

“Meeting her will only cause her emotions to stir, so it’s better if she remains alone,” Yan Xuehen said bluntly. “Don’t forget what I told you yesterday.”

Zu An’s expression changed several times. In the end, he could only sit down on the steps in frustration.

When she saw his dispirited appearance, Yan Xuehen’s expression shifted a bit. After a moment, she asked, “Do you have any idea just who spread these rumors?”

Zu An shook his head. He looked really puzzled as he replied, “There aren’t many who know about my relationship with Chuyan, and practically none of them are here on Violet Mountain. I really can’t be sure who did this. But I do have a suspicion…”

Then, he told her about the two mysterious waves of killing intent and the warning Chuyan had received on the slip of paper from the previous night.

Yan Xuehen said grimly, “I believe the one who left that message for Chuyan is the same as the one who spread the message. The other party is not only aware that you and Chuyan were married, but they also know that the two of you still share feelings. That is why they tried to send Chuyan to catch… hmph, catch a vixen.[1]”

Zu An rolled his eyes, saying, “Lady Xie and I are innocent. I don’t care too much about myself, but aren’t you tarnishing her reputation by saying that?”

Yan Xuehen thought, You’re defending her right now, and yet you still claim you’re innocent?!

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +66 +66 +66…

Zu An was stunned. What did she suddenly get angry for?

However, after ‘that’ had happened, it was to be expected that Yan Xuehen was angry. Zu An said, “I was the one being careless that night and didn’t think of this possibility.”

Yan Xuehen suddenly said, “Why do I have a feeling that a certain female friend of yours is doing this out of jealousy?”

Zu An’s face heated up. He had actually suspected that at first too, but it hadn’t seemed that plausible when he thought about it. None of his female friends were here, and it couldn't be Xie Daoyun, could it?Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Yan Xuehen opened her mouth. She wanted to say that this style was a bit similar to Yun Jianyue’s. But Yun Jianyue was a senior and not one of his girls, so there was no reason for her to do something so senseless.

…

Achoo!

Meanwhile, in Emptiness Isle’s courtyard, Yun Jianyue sneezed. She said with a smile, “That stone cold woman is definitely pissed off right now! Even though I can’t see it myself, just thinking about it makes me feel great.”

Inside the same room, Qiu Honglei said a bit worriedly, “Master, isn’t this a bit too much? It’s too shameless.”

“Hey, young lady, aren’t you making a mistake here? We’re the Devil Sect witches! Aren’t we supposed to be despicable?” Yun Jianyue retorted, rolling her eyes.

Qiu Honglei said somewhat awkwardly, “But this will completely offend Chu Chuyan… how are we supposed to live together in the future? Furthermore, if Ah Zu finds out, he’ll definitely blame me.”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “You still want to have a good relationship with her? The two of you are in complete opposition against each other. Could it be that you want to play a game of fake sistership?” She gave her disciple a serious look and continued, “Only one of you has to become the winner, while the other can only bow down as the loser. I definitely don’t want the loser to be you.”

If she becomes the loser, then what will I become? She chased that thought away as soon as it appeared. Hmph, I’m only doing this for my silly disciple’s sake.

Qiu Honglei muttered, “Why do I feel as if master cares more about the harem’s struggles than even I do?”

“What did you say?” Yun Jianyue snapped, raising a brow.

“Nothing,” Qiu Honglei quickly answered. She grabbed her master’s arm and said, “But master! Isn’t the highest level of charm techniques about seizing the heart of a man? If I fight with Chu Chuyan like this, I’ll only make Ah Zu feel disgusted with me if I go too far. Even if I win, what meaning will there be left?”

“Don’t worry. I’ll deal with that brat. Either way, I was the one who did all this. If he wants to blame someone, he can just blame me,” Yun Jianyue said proudly. Inwardly, however, she was a bit worried. She had indeed gone a bit too far this time.

…

Meanwhile, in Jadefall Palace’s courtyard, Pei Mianman finished her cultivation for the day. She looked out the window at the gossiping disciples and couldn't help but ask curiously, “Master, what are those disciples chatting about? It seems to be noisier than usual today.” In order to satisfy her master’s wishes, she had spent all her time cultivating bitterly. She didn’t know what was happening outside at all.

Elder Huo Ling waved her hand, and a wave of energy shut out the outside world. She said coldly, “Just some senseless things not worth mentioning. Compared to those chief disciples, you have a disadvantage in terms of cultivation time, so you need to seize the time before the great battles. You are almost at your bottleneck, so you cannot slack off.”

“Okay,” Pei Mianman replied with a nod. She wiped away the fine sweat from her chest. 

I definitely can’t lose to Chuyan…

As the disturbance continued to get more and more intense, the nine daoist sects’ great competition drew near.
