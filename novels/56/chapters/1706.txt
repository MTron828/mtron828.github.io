Chapter 1655: Hidden Room

Forget about Yun Jianyue, even Wang Wuxie and the other sect masters looked at Zu An with wide eyes. They had carried out this great competition countless times, but such a thing had never happened before.

After all, these representative disciples were the best of the best. To become the best, apart from talent, they had to have incredible luck too. Those who advanced further in the competition all had astonishing luck. They all kept each other in balance, so there was no way someone could draw byes the entire time. As such a thing had never happened before in history, that meant there was definitely something weird with the drawing of lots.

Still, they had all been watching the entire process carefully. If something really had been done, how could it escape their notice? The only suspicious part was that Zu An had fed Pei Mianman a strange pill right before she went up to draw her position.

“It’s just healing medicine,” Zu An said with a shrug. He thought to himself, This damned woman really forgets favors. I even helped their Emptiness Isle before.

Yun Jianyue frowned and remained silent. She felt as if he had done something, but she couldn't figure out what it was no matter how she thought about it.

“Take out that pill you used earlier and let us take a look to see if there’s anything strange about it,” Guan Chouhai harrumphed. Even though Heavenly Sorrow had already lost their candidate early and their reputation had fallen a grade, he and this brat had already come into conflict several times.

Previously, a sect master like him wouldn’t have cared all that much if a youngster clashed with him. But for some reason, he just felt really annoyed whenever he saw Zu An, as if the younger man had stolen something he really cherished.

Wang Wuxie felt a similar sensation. Even though Zu An’s strength had won his respect, after the past few days of interactions, he inexplicably disliked the other man.

The world was just that strange sometimes. Often, people just subconsciously disliked someone from their first meeting. There wasn’t necessarily much meaning behind it either.

“I don’t have any more. That pill was pretty precious, so I only had one,” Zu An said, refusing.

“Then what are the medicinal ingredients? What are the effects? There’s no lack of pill experts here. I’m sure we can reach a fair assessment,” Guan Chouhai continued.

Zu An’s expression suddenly turned serious. He retorted, “Sect Master Guan, do you not feel that asking for someone’s pill prescription is an extremely disrespectful thing?”

In this world of cultivation, whether it was cultivation texts, formations, or medicine prescriptions, they were all secrets that a sect would never let outsiders know.

Guan Chouhai became embarrassed. He had indeed overstepped his boundaries. Thus, he quickly explained, “I want to figure out how you were able to make Miss Pei draw three byes in a row.”

Zu An laughed and replied, “Could it be that you really believe it’s possible to make someone draw three byes in a row by eating a pill? Is there really something like a fortune pill in this world?”

“You…!” Guan Chouhai exclaimed, stunned. He discovered that others were looking at him as if he were mentally deficient now. His face inadvertently heated up..

Elder Huo Ling cried furiously, “Are you done yet? All of you questioned Manman when she won the match, and you’re even doubting her for pulling a bye? What, can only good things be enjoyed by your sect, and if anyone else gets anything, then there’s something wrong?”

“Elder speaks too seriously.”

Wang Wuxie and the others wiped away their sweat. They didn’t dare to have such a reputation attached to their names. In the end, as they couldn't find any concrete proof, they could only accept the result. Pei Mianman had gotten byes all the way to the finals.

…

The disciples dispersed, discussing the dazzling details of the fights. However, the most-discussed topic was Pei Mianman pulling three byes in a row. They also wondered whether Zu An had helped her or not.

Some people concluded that he hadn’t. After all, they were total strangers and he didn’t need to take such a big risk. Furthermore, there were so many powerful cultivators there. If he really had done something, he would definitely have been found out.

However, others concluded that he had. They felt that Zu An must have thought that Pei Mianman was just too big and too pretty, and had thus bent the rules out of a desire for her body. How contemptible!

“Ahhh! I’m so angry! The others might not know anything, but I know that damn brat definitely did something,” Yun Jianyue said. She was still upset even after drinking two cups of tea in a row.

Qiu Honglei smiled and filled her cup again, saying, “But you didn’t act up on Golden Peak.”

“That kid has some kind of way to sense others’ anger. I’m scared of exposing us, okay?” Yun Jianyue said angrily. After going on so many adventures with Zu An, she knew a bit about his abilities.

“Alright, master. I’m the one who has to fight, but I’m not even that upset.” Qiu Honglei said as she walked over and massaged her master’s shoulders. “Besides, what could he even do in front of so many people? You were watching too. Don’t tell me you really think he could escape your detection?”

“If it were anyone else, then no. But that kid has created too many miracles. He definitely has a way,” Yun Jianyue harrumphed. She felt really annoyed as soon as she recalled how he and that big-boobed woman had been exchanging looks.

“Huh? Master, you’re making Zu An sound as if he’s omnipotent! Even I didn’t know he was that great,” Qiu Honglei said with a chuckle. However, the higher the status of her lover was in her master’s mind, the happier she became.

Sensing that a misunderstanding was on the verge of happening, Yun Jianyue was startled and said, “I’m doing all this for you, of course! Right, we can’t only be worried about the competition. How is the investigation going?”

Qiu Honglei put away her smile and began, “I started looking around and saw…”

Yun Jianyue nodded as she listened. Her expression became a bit more grave.

…

Meanwhile, people were still wondering just what Zu An had done. Pei Mianman was naturally no exception. After all, she knew that her injuries had already been completely healed. Making her eat some kind of medicine was clearly an excuse Zu An had made up on the spot, so it was probably related to the lot drawing.

In the end, she couldn't suppress her curiosity and found a chance to secretly ask Zu An, “Ah Zu, just how did you do it?”

Zu An smiled and replied, “I already told all of you the truth, didn’t I? That thing is called a Fortune Pill, but none of you believed it.”

Pei Mianman exclaimed in shock, “Is there really something that incredible in this world?”

“Do you still remember the seven and a half million silver I won in Brightmoon City from the casinos?” Zu An replied with a grin.

“That was also because you ate one of those?” Pei Mianman asked. She naturally knew about that event, as it had caused such a stir across the entire city. People had all wondered how Zu An had done it. She hadn’t expected to receive the answer today!

Seeing Zu An nod, she exclaimed with a huge smile, “Ah Zu, you’re so good to me!” If there hadn’t been so many disciples around them, she would already have leapt into his arms.

Yan Xuehen was also curious as to how Zu An had done such a thing, and intended to ask him while pretending to have just been in the area coincidentally. However, when she saw the two of them flirting with each other, she turned around and left.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +55 +55 +55…

Wang Wuxie had wanted to find a chance to start a conversation with her, but when he saw her darkneed expression, he swallowed and didn’t look for trouble.

Why is Fairy Yan upset? Could it be because the White Jade Sect’s competitor didn’t make it to the finals? But that’s Li Changsheng’s disciple…

Zu An was startled when he saw the Rage points. He quickly turned around and saw Yan Xuehen departing.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Just then, someone let out a cold snort. It turned out Elder Huo Ling was nearby. She gave Zu An a vigilant look and said, “Sir Zu, Manman still has an important match to prepare for. Please do not disturb her and cause her to be distracted.” As soon as she finished speaking, she took Pei Mianman and left after.

Zu An was speechless. This damn spinster is acting like the damn school directors of my previous world. She’s making things difficult for me and Manman for no reason!

Helpless to do anything else, he could only return to his residence. He intended to find Yan Xuehen to see what was going on, but his expression suddenly changed and he took out the Embroidered Envoy’s golden tile. There was a row of characters on it, which said that the Envoys in Yi Commandery had already obtained information on where King Yan Manor’s account book was stored.

As such, he left behind a note informing Xie Daoyun
