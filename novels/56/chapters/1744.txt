Chapter 1693: Another Disappearance

However, just when Pei Mianman was about to call out, she had her acupoints sealed by Yun Jianyue first. Then, she was thrown into a wardrobe off to the side. She blinked in confusion.

Why was the glorious Devil Sect Master Yun Jianyue suddenly so alarmed? Could it be that she was scared of Ah Zu? Why was Ah Zu was looking for her so late into the night? In that instant, all kinds of possibilities filled her mind.

Yun Jianyue closed the wardrobe door. She was about to open the door when she remembered something. She opened the wardrobe again, and seeing Pei Mianman’s shocked expression, struck another acupoint to knock her unconscious. When she saw Pei Mianman faint, she sighed in relief. Then, she closed the wardrobe door again.

“What were you doing? Why did it take so long?” Zu An asked in confusion.

Yun Jianyue was alarmed, but she didn’t show it on the surface. She said, “Don’t I have to at least get dressed if you visit me in the middle of the night?”

Zu An smiled and said, “You know, I wouldn’t mind if you didn’t wear anything either.”

Yun Jianyue was stunned for a moment before snapping, “Damn kid, are you looking for a beating right now?”

Zu An darted into the room and said with an apologetic smile, “I was just joking with you, haha.”

“What are you sneaking around like this for?” Yun Jianyue asked. Despite that, she still closed the door again.

Zu An looked around. Yun Jianyue’s heart quickened and she asked, “What are you looking for?”

“Honglei isn’t here, right?” Zu An asked. If she found out that he was looking for her master in the middle of the night, that would be a bit troublesome.

Yun Jianyue sighed in relief, saying, “She’s not. She already went to bed. Why are you here?”

“The main reason is that some things happened on Violet Mountain,” Zu An said. He then told her about Xie Daoyun’s discoveries and asked for her opinion.

“To achieve the results you’re describing, someone would have had to arrange a huge formation,” Yun Jianyue said. She thought for a bit before replying, “According to what I know, the Shaman Great Elder Wu Wuyan is quite adept in that field.”

“Shaman Great Elder?” Zu An asked, stunned. He had almost paid dearly because of a shaman not too long ago, so hearing about them again was naturally startling.

“The shamans don’t have a so-called sect master. They all believe they’re servants of the shaman god. Meanwhile, this great elder is their spokesman in this world, practically the one with the greatest authority among the shamans. Wu Wuyan is a seasoned grandmaster herself, and has unfathomable cultivation. Together with her shaman skills that are difficult to prepare against, there’s almost no one who would be willing to provoke her,” Yun Jianyue said seriously.

“Who would provoke people like that?” Zu An replied, then explained what had happened when he faced Zhang Jie again.

“The shamans’ curse arts aren’t as terrifying as you imagine. They often collect the hair and fingernails of their targets, and they need their astrological information too. Only then will their skills be the most effective,” Yun Jianyue explained. “As for that Zhang Jie you described, strictly speaking, he isn’t a shaman. Otherwise, there’s no way the court wouldn’t have noticed him. It’s probably some possession technique he learned from the shamans that temporarily invited a powerful shaman into his body so he could borrow their abilities.

“From what you described, someone that powerful would be at least at the level of a shaman elder. It might even be Wu Wuyan herself.”

Zu An’s expression became serious. If just borrowing her ability had already made Zhang Jie so hard to deal with, just how troublesome would the person herself be?

“The shamans aren’t entirely without faults either,” Yun Jianyue said to console him. “They excel at scheming against others from behind and aren’t great at a frontal clash. That’s why the best way to deal with them is to fight them in close quarters.” Afterward, she taught Zu An some methods to deal with them.

Zu An was filled with complete admiration. As expected of the Devil Sect Master! Her knowledge and experience were something few people could compare to.

“Alright. I’ll increase my vigilance for now, and I’ll also pay that Feng guy some attention. You can leave now,” Yun Jianyue said, as if to chase him out.

“Do you really want me to leave that badly?” Zu An replied with a laugh. “Honestly, you’re a bit suspicious right now. Weren’t you upset with me before? Why do you seem… guilty instead?”

Yun Jianyue endured her urge to glance at the wardrobe and quickly replied, “What guilt? Also, what do you mean by angry? Brat, stop making things up.”

Zu An looked at her ridiculously charming face and said gently, “You know I can sense if someone is angry or not. Honestly, I was actually really happy to see you angry. That means you actually do care about me, which is why you would become jealous.”

“Who’s jealous?!” Yun Jianyue snapped, her face heating up. She pushed him toward the exit and said, “Go, leave already. Stop bothering me!”

Zu An suddenly turned around and took her waist into his embrace. Then, without waiting for her reaction, he gave her alluring lips a kiss.

Yun Jianyue stiffened. In that instant, a streak of electricity seemed to run through her entire body. Her mind went blank for a few seconds. However, she finally reacted when Zu An’s tongue reached deeper. She pushed him away in shame and annoyance, snapping, “You stinky brat, what are you doing?!”

“Am I stinky? You can give it a taste again,” Zu An said with a laugh, and moved closer to kiss her again.

Yun Jianyue was speechless. At first, she struggled intensely, but she didn’t use her grandmaster rank power. As such, there was no way she could struggle free from his powerful arms. Her resistance gradually grew weaker, and her temperature increased. Her body became softer and softer too.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

She was a mature woman, and she hadn’t used any of the charm skills she had practiced for so long. As such, her body was like a volcano on the verge of erupting. In the past, it hadn’t really mattered much when she was feeling pent-up, but previously, Zu An had opened up a brand new world for her. That volcano had become active once more, and Zu An was the only one who could make her erupt.

After a while, she finally got a chance to breathe. Hesitantly, she said, “What we’re doing isn’t right…”

Zu An didn’t say anything. Instead, he rained down scorching hot kisses on her cheek and neck.

Yun Jianyue moaned. This man is just too good at this…

Unlike Yan Xuehen, as someone from the Devil Sect, she knew much more about these things. She didn’t have as many reservations, despite knowing that she couldn't continue to have an ambiguous relationship with Zu An like this, as it would only hurt Honglei. However, when she thought about how Pei Mianman was in the wardrobe, she suddenly felt a bit mischievous.

The Devil Sect’s people had always believed in the law of the jungle. They were trained to steal good things from others since they were young. She remembered that when she was little, her senior sister had a toy that she really liked, so her master had encouraged her to steal it. Then, after struggling for a while, she had successfully stolen that toy from her senior sister. When she saw her sobbing senior sister, she had suddenly realized that she didn’t like the toy that much. Instead, she liked the feeling of success that came from stealing the item more.

She felt as if she had returned to her childhood. Not only did she like this toy, she could even enjoy the happiness of stealing it from someone else. She felt guilty toward Honglei, but she didn’t carry such misgivings toward other women.

In that instant, she even felt a bit of regret. Why had she decided to make Pei Mianman faint? Wouldn’t it have been even better if she had to see everything?

As soon as Yun Jianyue had that thought, her entire body began to shake uncontrollably. This was a kind of excitement that came from her very soul!

Suddenly, she groaned. She discovered that while her imagination was running wild, that kid had already taken the chance to enter her. She looked at the large and tall man in front of her. As the Devil Sect Master, she didn’t like this kind of submissive position. She bit her lip and seized the initiative, saying, “I want to be on top!”

Zu An knew that she cared a lot about her pride and didn’t fight her over that. He looked at her with a smile and said, “Go ahead, sect master.”

…

The next day, on Violet Mountain’s peak, the nine daoist sects’ representatives gathered once more. It turned out the missing Emptiness Isle disciple had already been found.

“Elder Peng, how did you find her?” Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s Guan Chouhai asked curiously.

“Why do you care? Since she’s already here, we can just start the final competition now, right?” Yun Jianyue harrumphed.

“Come on, don’t be like this. What if the Devil Sect Master is already here on this mountain? You should explain it to us so we can take some precautions,” the White Jade Sect’s Li Changsheng said. He was worried that Yun Jianyue could be a variable that would end up affecting their great scheme.

“It had nothing to do with the Devil Sect,” Yun Jianyue replied. She was in high spirits today, so she didn’t feel like bickering with the others today.

They were about to ask more when Elder Huo Ling ran over with a nervous expression, crying out, “My disciple is missing!
