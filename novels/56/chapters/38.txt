Chapter 39: The Thief in the Flower Field

Translator: Pika

“I thought things through yesterday, and I realized that you were sending me to the academy for my own good as well.” It was then that Zu An noticed Hong Xingying standing behind the two of them. The latter had a disinterested look on his face, and couldn’t be bothered to meet Zu An’s gaze. Why does this fellow treat me so coldly? It’s almost as if I owe him hundreds of silver taels!

“You have wisened up quite a bit.” Chu Zhongtian seemed in a good mood. He gently stroked his beard. “Chuyan will be delighted to hear this too.”

A zealous look flashed in Hong Xingying’s eyes at the mention of the First Miss, but he quickly concealed it.

Qin Wanru smiled at Zu An. “Since you have decided to go to the academy, you should have Xingying accompany you. He’s also attending the academy from today onward. It would be good if the two of you looked after one another. Xingying is a smart and mature child, so I’m sure you can learn a lot from him.”

Hong Xingying bowed in deference. “Madam, you’re flattering me. I’ll do my best to take care of him.”

Zu An clicked his tongue quietly. It sounds good if you ask us to ‘look after one another’, but put crudely, you’re basically using him to keep an eye on me. They must be quite worried after I played truant yesterday, so they’re sending someone with me to prevent such things from happening again.

This also explained why Hong Xingying was so furious earlier on. It hadn’t been easy for him to secure a chance to study at the academy, and Zu An’s injuries almost cost him this chance. It was only natural for him to get angry.

While the academies here preached education without discrimination, securing a spot wasn’t easy. At the very least, each applicant would have to prove their worth. Well-connected individuals like Zu An could get an easy pass.

It was much harder for others like Hong Xingying and the other servants of the Chu clan, as they required their Master’s approval to enter the academy.

Shouldn’t Hong Xingying be thankful to me, then? If not for me, how else could he have secured a chance to attend the academy?

Despite earning Rage points from Hong Xingying earlier, Zu An still felt that he’d gotten the short end of the stick in this situation.

Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru lectured him a while longer before taking their leave. Hong Xingying tossed his head arrogantly and left the room as well.

Zu An proceeded with his morning ablutions. Someone delivered breakfast to him as he was getting ready, so he had Cheng Shouping sit down and eat together with him.

Unexpectedly, his offhanded action caused the latter to tear up.

Young master, even though you’re a little dumb, very boastful, and awfully incapable... you treat me really well! You don’t think of me as a subordinate. Yes, I’ve decided. I’ll help you to gain a footing in the Chu clan no matter what!

If Zu An had been aware of his thoughts, he would probably have kicked him in the face.

“Ahem ahem!” A hunchbacked figure passed by his window.

“Don’t you play truant today. Remember to look for Wei Hongde.” A voice rasped in Zu An’s ears as he ate.

He raised his head to take a look, but Old Mi’s figure was already nowhere to be seen.

Zu An nudged Cheng Shouping. “Did you hear a voice earlier?”

“I didn’t hear anything at all. Burp~” Cheng Shouping was so engrossed in his food that his eyes had never left the table.

Zu An rolled his eyes in disdain. “Aren’t you afraid of choking to death?” The voice he’d just heard sent a shiver down his spine. For some reason, the mysterious old man scared him. Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru seemed almost docile compared to him.

He would do well to take a good look around the academy today.

After finishing his meal, Cheng Shouping helped Zu An pack some daily necessities.As they walked out of the door, they found Hong Xingying already waiting outside, a sword in his arms. Upon seeing the duo, he asked impatiently, “What took you so long?”

You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for 99 Rage points!

Is there a problem with this lad?

Zu An couldn’t stand it any longer. “Are you the young master or am I the young master? What’s wrong with waiting for a while?”

“So what if you’re the young master? There isn’t a single person in the Chu Estate who doesn’t know of your background. Do you think that you can scare me?” Hong Xingying sneered coldly.

Zu An looked him over from head to toe. “Do I owe you money?”

Hong Xingying was stunned by the abrupt question. “I don’t think so.”

“Then why are you so hostile toward me?” Zu An asked.

Hong Xingying’s body stiffened. He hadn’t expected Zu An to confront him directly. He glanced at Cheng Shouping, and chose to approach the matter carefully. “I don’t hate you personally. I just think that it’s a huge pity for the First Miss. The First Miss is such a talented and wonderful person. A man like you will never be a match for her!”

“This... He’s the young master after all. It isn’t appropriate for you to say such words,” Cheng Shouping protested weakly.

Zu An was amused by Cheng Shouping’s response. I didn’t think this lad would stick his head out for me in front of someone else.

Hong Xingying glanced at Cheng Shouping coldly. “Is there anything wrong with what I have just said? Why don’t you point out his strengths to me then?”

Cheng Shouping frowned in concentration. After a long moment, he declared, “While the young master doesn’t have any talents, at least his appearance is passable!”

Zu An, infuriated, immediately shoved Cheng Shouping aside. It was a miracle that this fellow could survive in the Chu clan to this day with such a foul mouth! “Ah, I get it now. In other words, you’re Chuyan’s admirer!”

Hong Xingying’s fair face immediately reddened upon hearing those words. “Who says so! I’m not her admirer! Stop talking nonsense!”

Hong Xingying’s triple-denial combo was too good an opportunity to pass up. “A capable servant and a beautiful miss; what a beautiful yet tragic love story! Still, don’t you think it’s shameless to covet another man’s wife?”

“You!!!” Hong Xingying glared at Zu An before turning his head away with a growl. He didn’t want to waste his breath arguing with the latter anymore!

You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for 100 Rage points!

Unfortunately for Hong Xingying, Zu An had no plans on letting him off so easily. He walked up to Hong Xingying and looped an arm around his shoulders. “Fine fine, let me put it in another way then: The woman you love became my wife. That makes you sound less like an asshole for coveting my wife, right? Do you feel better now?”

You have successfully trolled Hong Xingying for 333 Rage points!

Hong Xingying gnashed his teeth in anger and he gripped the handle of his sword tightly. He somehow managed to hold himself back from drawing his sword. Taking a deep breath, he said, “All you’re capable of is running your mouth! Hah, just you wait! The academy treats everyone equally. Soon I shall have you know the gulf that exists between you and me!”

Zu An chuckled softly. “I admire your confidence. You put on one face before my father- and mother-in-law, only to act in a different manner behind their backs. Aren’t you afraid that I would report this matter to them?”

Hong Xingying was unfazed by the threat. “Go ahead and tell them then. Let’s see whether they’ll believe a piece of trash like you, or a capable servant like me.”

Zu An pulled Cheng Shouping over. “I have an eye-witness here.”

Cheng Shouping shook his head frantically. “I didn’t see or hear anything at all!”

Zu An felt something in him about to snap. “Why are you acting like a coward?”

Hong Xingying sneered at the farce playing out in front of him. “Force him all you want to. It’s futile. If there’s one person that Master and Madam trust the least in this estate, it’s him.”

After saying his piece, Hong Xingying strode ahead of them, putting some distance between him and Zu An. It was as if he felt disgusted just standing next to trash like them.

Zu An and Cheng Shouping were left in his wake, staring speechlessly at one another. Zu An sighed deeply. “How in the world did you end up in such a miserable position? You should consider just smashing your head into that pillar over there and ending your life.”

“You have fallen so low that even a servant dares to criticize you, and you still dare to pick flaws with me!” Cheng Shouping retorted indignantly.

Zu An snarled, then turned his gaze to the young man walking away from them. A smile slowly formed on his lips. It wasn’t easy for me to stumble upon such perfect prey like you. I should take my time to milk you, lest you collapse before I have my fill of Rage points.

The three of them arrived at the entrance of Brightmoon Academy. Zu An glanced wistfully in the direction of the winding side path he’d taken the day before, and the image of a carefree woman swirling a gourd of wine flashed across his mind. He wondered if he would be able to meet her once more.

There were fewer people queuing up at the entrance of the academy as compared to the day before. Bored with waiting, Zu An took the time to look around. He spied a young man and a young woman tugging at one another, deep in conversation. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The man was quite good-looking, but he smelled of powder and perfume. His skin was fairer than most women, and from time to time, his eyes would twinkle seductively. This ‘young man’ seemed suspicious, and reminded Zu An of the stereotypical cross-dressing plotline that was often portrayed in historical dramas.

I’m not as foolish as Liang Shanbo. There’s no way I’ll let something as good as this slip past me!

Zu An walked over and looped an arm across the young man’s shoulders. “Hey bro, have we met each other before?”

You’re the one who wants to cross-dress as a guy, so you can’t complain even if I take advantage of you a little. Hahaha~

“You are...?” The ‘young man’ seemed a little confused. He was clearly trying to recall if he had ever met Zu An before.

Zu An was perplexed. He didn’t expect this ‘young man’ to respond so nonchalantly. His gaze tracked downward, and he spotted the Adam’s apple on his throat. His stomach instantly started churning. Shit, it’s just a guy who looks like a girl!

He retracted his arm as if in shock, and apologized, “My bad, I thought you were someone else.”

The young woman standing opposite the young man glared at Zu An as if he was an idiot, displeased that he had suddenly barged into their conversation. “Sigh. Where were we?

“Ah yes, I remember now. Big brother Xiu, how did I wrong you and irk you so much? Tell me, and I’ll change! Why must we break up with one another?” The woman was beautiful, and the tears glistening in her eyes gave her an incredibly pitiful look.

Zu An examined the feminine man closely. Is this sort of man considered charming in this world? Even if I were to be compared with him... Sigh, let’s not talk about such a depressing topic.

The man reached out to grab the woman’s hand, his voice brimming with emotion. “This isn’t your fault. I’m just afraid that... I won’t love you anymore in the future. So, I want to break up while we’re still in love with one another. I shall bear all of the pain and heartache alone.”

Zu An froze. This must be one of the trashiest break-up excuses I have ever heard! Holy shit, is this fellow the ancestor of the Scumbag Sect?

His words made the woman burst into tears. “Big brother Xiu, I didn’t know that your love for me runs so deep! It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have pushed you so much. They always say that distance makes the heart grow fonder. Perhaps you’ll love me once more if we part for one another temporarily.”

Zu An’s eyes widened in disbelief. Are the women in this world so gullible? I see... Looks like this is really a haven for me!

“I’m glad that you understand me so well!” the young man replied with an agitated tone. The scene flipped suddenly on its head. “Now that we have broken up with one another, can you introduce me to your close friend? I’m referring to the young miss from the Liu clan that you have been...”

*Smack!*

There was a limit to how dumb a human could be. The young woman slapped him full in the face and fled tearfully.

The young man opened his fan and lightly stroked the cheek that had been slapped. He looked wistful as he intoned deeply, “The tender hand of a beauty; how it entrances me so.”
