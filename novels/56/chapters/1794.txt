Chapter 1743: Full of Expectation

“Hm? Interesting,” the monster said in surprise. “Your cultivation has exceeded my expectations. If I were really fighting against you face to face, it would indeed be a bit tricky.”

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing exchanged a look. They were both horrified. This monster was just too ridiculous! Furthermore, it had only said that it would be ‘a bit tricky’. That meant that even if they did face each other, the emperor wouldn’t necessarily be able to win against it. Just what kind of monster was this? How was it so powerful?

“You are not located in the same dimension?” Zhao Han asked, raising his brows. He couldn't understand how the monster did such a thing even with everything he knew. The world was large and mysterious, as expected.

The monster nodded and said, “You’re a smart fellow. I’m several dimensions away. Of course you can’t hurt me.”

Zhao Han’s expression now truly changed. All of this was beyond his imagination. However, he was also a bit excited.  There are beings more powerful than myself after all! Doesn’t this mean the road to immortality isn’t just a fleeting rumor?

He couldn't help but ask, “Have you achieved immortality?”

The others also shivered, looking at the monster with fervent expressions. In that instant, they even found its grotesque body a bit cute.

The monster was also stunned. Then, it laughed and said, “How strange! Normally, I’m always asking the questions, and yet today, I’m the one being asked the questions.” It paused for a moment before continuing, “If my mood were good, it wouldn’t be a big deal to answer this question of yours. But my mood just doesn’t happen to be that good today.” It recalled the two ladies from earlier and immediately felt annoyed. It had never lost so miserably in so many years.

Zhao Han only became even more excited when he heard its tone. This creature seemed to really know the truth about immortality. He asked, “How can I get you to answer my questions?”

“Pass my trial first, and we’ll talk about the rest after,” the monster said, revealing a strange smile. “Right, I’m Sphinx. Remember this name, or else you won’t even know how you perished.”

The others all felt dejected. This monster was incredibly freakish. It definitely wasn’t boasting idly.

The monster continued, “I’ll ask you all some questions soon. If you answer correctly, you pass. If you’re wrong… Heh, I’ll collect your souls! How about it? Isn’t it fair?”

Zhao Han frowned slightly. He doubted the authenticity of what it had said earlier. Was it really many dimensions away, or had it fooled him through some sort of diversion? There was no reason for his attack to have completely missed it. He wasn’t used to putting his own safety at risk, so he wanted to give it another try.

As if it sensed what he was thinking, the monster said with a malicious expression, “My patience is limited. Don’t make me angry.”

Zhao Han decided to speak his mind. “Since I cannot hurt you, you should not be able to hurt me either. What you are doing is nothing more than a bluff.”

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing both felt admiration. As expected of his majesty, the strongest of them all! This degree of calmness and confidence isn’t something we can ever hope to have.

As for the other two, they were already shaking so much they couldn't even think properly anymore.

The monster replied, “That’s right. My offensive methods might not be able to injure you. Still, if you don’t answer my question within the set time, your soul will be mine. That’s the law of this world, something none of you can defy.” It paused for a moment before adding, “You’ve angered me after all. So, I’ll ask a question no one has been able to answer correctly. Then, you’ll all be dead for sure.”

Zhao Han was alarmed. At his level, he was able to glimpse the laws of this world. He knew this was what the world had decided on and that he really couldn't go against it. He didn’t dare to attack again when he realized that. Otherwise, he would really anger it, and that wouldn’t be a smart decision. But if I don’t answer its question correctly…

Just then, the monster said, “Hmm, there are five people, so let’s simplify matters and just ask one question.”

With a wave of its paw, nine pieces of flat bread appeared in midair, as well as a blade. Then, it asked, “The question is, how can these nine pieces of flat bread be divided evenly among the people present with one cut?”

Those present were stunned. They found the question incredibly strange. It looked simple at first, and yet when they thought about it carefully, it turned out to be extremely difficult.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing were sect master-level figures of the daoist sects. They were outstanding geniuses to begin with, and were good at things like arithmetic. They quickly began to think to themselves.

It was possible to divide the nine flatbreads among five people, but there was no way to do it in one cut. But if one used a sufficiently refined blade skill, a single cut could do many things. Perhaps it could be done. However, the problem was whether or not the monster would acknowledge that cut. Furthermore, the bread floating in midair wouldn’t necessarily be able to withstand that blade skill. Perhaps it would just end up being destroyed and scatter…

They all sank into their own thoughts and decided to wait until someone else tried it first. That way, perhaps they would be able to gain some enlightenment from it. Even if they couldn't, they would still at least have more time to think.

When it saw that they all fell silent, the monster said sinisterly, “There is a time limit for the answer. If no one makes an attempt within the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, all of your souls will be mine for the taking.”

A stick of incense began to burn in the air, imposing a degree of invisible pressure

The monster spoke up again and said, “No matter who comes up with the solution, it will be considered as everyone passing. Right, and as a friendly reminder, the longer you spend on this task, the more you might end up losing out.”

The listeners were confused by its addendum. If everyone could pass no matter who went first, why would it say that the later they tried, the worse the consequences would be?

Zhao Han stepped forward and arrived in front of the blade, saying, “I will divide them!”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

When they saw him act completely calm, seemingly certain of success, Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing were overjoyed at the unexpected good news. His majesty is his majesty after all! The feeling of having the strongest on your side really is great.

The monster had an ambiguous smile as it said, “You have to divide it properly, you know? Otherwise, no matter how strong you are, according to the laws of this world, your soul will be seized by me.”

Zhao Han didn’t reply. He picked up the blade and made a cut. Then, he said indifferently, “It’s done. One person, three pieces.”

The two weaker cultivators wanted to see how he had divided it, but they suddenly felt a chill by their necks. Then, everything went cold, and they entered complete darkness.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing jumped in fright. Their faces were deathly pale. Those two had been killed with one slice! They didn’t even see how Zhao Han had used the blade! But who would have thought that he would aim the blade at his companions?

The monster was clearly stunned. After a while, it sighed and said, “I didn’t expect that they could be divided like this.”

Afterward, its figure distorted, and it disappeared. The mysterious laws surrounding the three cultivators also disappeared with it.

Zhao Han remained completely calm as he walked out, saying, “Alright, let’s explore this new world together.”

“Yes, absolutely! Of course!” Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing replied, both feeling shocked. They hurriedly followed.

…

Meanwhile, Wei Suo was scolding Zu An. “Boss, it’s not that I’m criticizing you, but why are you acting like some upright gentleman? For better or for worse, we could have at least gotten a bit of intelligence. Either way, you’re a man, so you don’t even have anything to lose.”

“Ahem!” Qiu Honglei shot him a glare.

Wei Suo hurriedly said, “If there really is a ghost, there’s no way it would give up so easily. I’ll deal with the next one, so don’t fight with me over it! It’ll be a waste anyway even if you do.”

Zu An had a grin as he replied, “Sure, sure, I won’t fight with you.”

When he saw Zu An’s bright and relaxed smile, Wei Suo was stunned. He quickly said, “No way, no way, boss, you’re too handsome! If you stand there, that female ghost will only go after you!”

Zu An had a strange expression as he said, “Alright, we’ll go for a stroll then, to see if we can find that female ghost to chat with.”

Wei Suo beamed and replied, “That’s great!” Without boss, that handsome bastard, here, I might really be able to get lucky…

Zu An and Qiu Honglei walked up to the entrance. Zu An couldn't help but turn around and ask, “Will you be in danger by yourself?”

Wei Suo patted his chest and said, “Boss, don’t look down on me now! I’ve been to all sorts of places and experienced all kinds of things. I’m a respectable expert in my own right now! Aren’t you worrying too much when it’s just exorcising some female ghost?”

“Then you have to be careful,” Zu An said, figuring that made sense. As such, he took Qiu Honglei with him into the dark night.

…

Just then, thick tree vines that resembled countless snakes slithered within a mountain cave. A strong and robust madam at their center looked at a weak woman across from her. She asked in a voice that was rather androgynous, “Little Ying, why are you back so soon? Where is the person?”

The madam’s appearance was as androgynous as her voice. Her brows were so thick that it was as if someone had drawn them with a writing brush, and there was a thick layer of white powder applied to her face. Her cheeks had a fiery red blush. All in all, it gave her quite an ugly appearance.

Little Ying was clearly afraid of her as she replied, “Great Sister, it was because that young master had a woman who looks like a goddess at his side. I wasn’t able to seduce him…”

When she heard what happened, the ugly madam immediately roared with laughter. “Hahaha! An incredibly handsome young master, and a gorgeous goddess? Those are exactly the types I like to play with! Then, I’ll go and pay them a visit!”

As soon as she spoke, countless vines reached toward the distant temple.
