Chapter 1541: Against Someone Like You?

Yi Zhibing was furious. He had been so close to his wonderful plan working, and yet Zu An just had to meddle at the last second! He could tell that Zu An’s relationship with Zheng Dan was special. Even the way the Sang clan’s young miss looked at him was full of tender feelings.

How dare you?!

This was clearly his own blessing, and yet someone else had come swooping in first. How could he stand it?

You have successfully trolled Yi Zhibing for +366 +366 +366…

Zheng Dan and Sang Qien were both so angry their entire bodies were shaking. Whether it was their clan’s reputation or their own integrity as women, those words went too far!

Yi Zhibing gave the other bailiffs, who were standing off to the side in a daze, a look and said, “What are you staring blankly for? All of you, charge! Don’t let this traitor get away, or else all of us are screwed!”

He assumed that, even though Zu An’s attack was pretty good, he had the numbers advantage. Furthermore, he was carrying out a mission as an official. If they started fighting, the more ruthless Zu An was, the worse his crimes would become.

Either way, he was the glorious Capital Magistrate’s son. He didn’t think Zu An would actually dare to kill him. As for those bailiffs, if they died, then so be it. That would be enough to leave Zu An doomed.

“Noisy!” Zu An snapped, his expression darkening. He waved his hand, sending a wave of sword ki at Yi Zhibing.

Yi Zhibing, who had begun to have an expression of immense pleasure, quickly narrowed his eyes. He could feel that a terrifying aura had locked onto him, and that he wouldn’t get away no matter how he dodged.

“Young master, be careful!” Bailiff Wang exclaimed in horror. He quickly moved to protect Yi Zhibing. Magistrate Yi had sent him mainly to ensure his son’s safety. If something happened to Yi Zhibing, there would definitely be severe consequences once he returned.

However, he had just witnessed the power of Zu An’s sword. He didn’t dare to show the slightest bit of carelessness, so he instantly raised the Iron Hand. The Iron Hand elongated, turning into a shield that blocked the attack for Yi Zhibing.

The very reason he had become so famous as a bailiff was because the Iron Hand could attack and defend at the same time. Before this Iron Hand of his, the varied and strange weapons in the world of warriors were mere child’s play. However, he had no confidence in his ability to block Zu An’s sword.

Soon after, he saw the result. He looked at the shattered Iron Hand in his hands, and looked down to see a bloody gash across his chest. In an instant, the sword ki had ripped directly through his body.

Bailiff Wang collapsed to the ground like a broken sack, his life flashing before his eyes. He had once believed he was someone who had conscience and resolve. Even though he had been born to a humble background, he made up for it with effort.

The teachings he had received weren’t that amazing, but through work and talent, he managed to acquire a certain set of skills. That had allowed him to stand out in his local county government office. He had even managed to stumble upon the earth-grade weapon, the Iron Hand. Back then, he felt as if he had been chosen by the heavens, thinking he had been assigned to uphold virtue and condemn evil.

As his official rank climbed higher and higher, he had eventually reached the capital and became a bailiff there. However, what he saw left him bewildered. He had discovered that almost every single official committed crimes, and that his immediate superior and the colleagues around him were all just as filthy. He wanted to change all that, and yet he discovered that he was powerless.

Eventually, as his status and position climbed even higher, he had stopped being as hot-blooded as before. He had begun to consider his own interests too, as well as the interests of his family and loved ones. As such, he had become more and more taciturn. The bit of conscience he had left prevented him from participating in some vile and filthy acts, but that was all.

Only now did he realize that sometimes, when the difference in power was too great, not doing anything was the same as helping a villain do evil. He suddenly felt regret. If he had kept to his morals, and always fought against evil… Even if he died somehow through unexpected circumstances, he would have died as an honorable man. And yet, right now, he was about to die protecting shameless scum…

I regret this so much!

That was the last thought in his mind as the light faded from his eyes.

Even though all those thoughts flashed through Bailiff Wang’s mind, it all took place in the time it took for sparks to fly off flint. The streak of sword light passed through his body and continued toward Yi Zhibing.

Yi Zhibing tried to move out of the way, but he discovered that he couldn't at all. Fortunately, blue light flickered around him as the pendant around his waist shone again. His entire body was blown back several steps by the tremendous force. His insides were stirred wildly, but he wasn’t too affected otherwise.

When he saw the result, Yi Zhibing smiled arrogantly again, saying, “Hahaha, this pendant of mine can even block the full-power attack of a master rank cultivator. Who do you think you are? Do you want to do something to me? Why don’t you draw your sword and give it a try?”

Judging from what he had seen, even though Zu An’s cultivation wasn’t low, he definitely wasn’t at the master rank. Furthermore, Zu An looked just like a normal person, so who knew what power he had borrowed to produce that sword ki? Meanwhile, Yi Zhibing had an artifact that could block a full-power strike from a master rank cultivator, so what did he have to fear?

“Draw my sword? Against someone like you?” Zu An remarked indifferently, sending out another strand of sword ki.

Previously, he had seen that Yi Zhibing’s cultivation wasn’t that high, which was why he hadn’t used that much strength. Furthermore, the bailiff had absorbed a portion of the strike, which was why the sword ki hadn’t hurt Yi Zhibing. However, this time would be different.

Even as the terrifying aura locked onto him again, after his previous experience, Yi Zhibing wasn’t scared. He laughed mockingly and began, “Don’t even bother wasting your…”

Before he could even finish his sentence, he heard a crack noise. When he looked down, he saw that the pendant that had protected him through countless situations was beginning to be covered in fine cracks. A moment later, it exploded into pieces!

Pu!

Yi Zhibing’s body erupted into a bloody mist. Following a burst of intense pain, he felt his entire body becoming as light as a feather, as if his soul were about to leave. He gasped, “You… actually dare to kill me? My dad is Magistrate Yi Chun… Ah…”

When they saw Yi Zhibing lying in a puddle of blood, twitching and clearly dying, a commotion broke out among the bailiffs. The group who hadn’t attacked the two women ran for their lives. However, Zu An didn’t trouble them. He wasn’t someone who enjoyed killing. According to the two women’s descriptions, those people’s crimes weren’t enough for them to deserve death.

Actually, the bailiff with the Iron Hand hadn’t needed to die either. But seeing as he had rushed forward to take the attack, throwing his life away, what could Zu An have done?

“Big brother Zu, things are going to be troublesome now…” Sang Qien said worriedly when she saw Yi Zhibing take his last breath. “Even though Yi Zhibing is hateful, he’s the Capital Magistrate’s beloved son. Now that he’s died, there’s no way Yi Chun will leave this matter alone.”

Regardless of which era it was, someone in such a position would definitely be an important minister of the court.

“It’s nothing to be concerned about,” Zu An said casually. Then, he looked at the two women and asked, “Are you two alright?”

“We’re… fine,” Sang Qien replied, blushing. His voice is so gentle… Still, it was hard for her to hide her concern. This time, they had publicly killed people in the manor, so it would probably be unlikely for things to end peacefully now.

Why is big brother Zu not worried at all? she thought. She didn’t know that after all of the things Zu An had experienced on the fiend side, a trifling Capital Magistrate really wasn’t someone he would worry too much about.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I’m fine. Little Qien, was the child affected?” Zheng Dan asked as she supported Sang Qien with great concern. The two of them had been mutually dependent on each other for survival, so they had grown very close. Furthermore, after finding out about the Sang clan’s plans, she had realized that Sang Qien was already on Zu An’s side. That had naturally made her feel even more reassured.

“The child?” Zu An asked, stunned. Only then did he notice Sang Qien’s overly spacious dress, as well as the way she gently tapped her own back to alleviate soreness. “You’re pregnant?”

Zheng Dan rolled her eyes and retorted, “You even have the nerve to ask about what you did yourself?”

Zu An was stunned. Only then did he remember what had happened that night. He was shocked but happy, murmuring, “This… is my child?” He had suddenly become a father. He really was at a loss for what to do.

Sang Qien lowered her head in embarrassment. She said in a very soft voice, “Yeah…”

Zu An was so excited he wanted to pick Sang Qien up and spin twice in the air, but he quickly realized that she was pregnant and that wouldn’t be appropriate. As such, he simply squatted down in front of her and pressed his ear against her belly to hear his child.

Sang Qien’s face turned red. As the young miss of a noble clan, how could she possibly let a man get that close to her own body? Still, she didn’t resist this ‘unfamiliar’ man at all. Instead, she gently placed her hand on his head, suddenly feeling very close to him. She murmured, “How can it be that easy to hear the child…”

Zheng Dan was a bit jealous when she saw how happy Zu An was. If she had known that it would be like this, she wouldn’t have been greedy, forcing that stuff out of her body because she thought it wouldn’t be a good idea to get pregnant so early.

Sang Qien had been sensitive to begin with. She quickly sensed something and promptly supported Zu An to his feet, saying, “Big brother Zu, I heard that the court is discussing my father’s disappearance. Judging from what I know, things seem to be really unfavorable for you and my father. Now, you’ve even killed Yi Zhibing and these people… Should we leave the capital first?”

Zu An shook his head and replied, “It’s fine. You two should just stay here. I’m going to pay the Imperial Palace a visit first.”

He prepared to leave, but Sang Qien grabbed his sleeves. She was clearly worried that he wouldn’t come back if he went into the Imperial Palace. After all, that was a place full of powerful experts, and it even had the emperor overseeing it. It was on an entirely different scale compared to Yi Zhibing.

Zheng Dan said with a chuckle, “Little Qien, don’t worry. If he says it's fine, he definitely has a way.”

“Dandan really does understand me,” Zu An said, showing Zheng Dan a smile. Then, he said a few more words of consolation to Sang Qien before leaving.

Sang Qien was stunned. She suddenly felt a bit jealous. It was clear that her sister-in-law had spent more time with big brother Zu and they understood each other better.

…

Meanwhile, in the court, the arguments were already growing more and more out of hand.

“Sang Hong has colluded with the Fiend races; his entire family ought to be executed down to the third generation!”
