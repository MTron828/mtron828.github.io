Chapter 1744: Humiliation

“Grandmother might not be happy if we act on our own…” Little Ying said, feeling a hint of regret. Her impression of that gentlemanly young master was really good, and she really didn’t want bad things to happen to him because of Great Sister. However, Great Sister didn’t pay her any attention. Countless vines extended from the ground in Ruo Lan Temple’s direction.

Little Ying bit her lip. Great Sister and Grandmother had a closer ancestral relationship, which was why Great Sister was always throwing her weight around. Little Ying didn’t dare to offend her. Now that she had been ignored, she couldn't say anything else. However, she was still a bit worried. If that really handsome young master ended up being ruined by Great Sister, that would be really sad.

After hesitating for some time, in the end, she clenched her teeth and quickly followed. She wanted to see whether there was a chance to help that young master…

…

Meanwhile, Zu An and Qiu Honglei left Ruo Lan Temple. There was still a faint hint of fragrance left in the air, so they followed the scent trail.

Along the way, Qiu Honglei turned to look at Zu An from time to time. Zu An couldn't help but rub his face and ask, “Why do you keep looking at me like that?”

“That Little Ying from earlier was quite pretty. Why did you refuse her so firmly?” Qiu Honglei asked with a smile.

“She’s a ghost, you know?” Zu An reflexively replied.

“So what if she’s a ghost? She doesn’t seem that different from a normal person. She clearly has all of the normal functions,” Qiu Honglei said with a smirk. “That Wei Suo seemed pretty interested. He was about to commit to her for romance.”

Zu An exclaimed with a righteous expression, “Am I that kind of person?!”

“If I hadn’t been next to you, would you have been tempted by her?” Qiu Honglei asked with a sigh. “At first, I was pretty happy that I was next to you in this dungeon. However, I didn’t expect to end up dragging you down…”

Zu An grabbed her hand and looked at her deeply, then said, “With beauties such as all of you, why would I still think about others?”

“All of you…” Qiu Honglei murmured, sighing inwardly, but she was still really moved. “Ah Zu~”

“Eh…” Mi Li muttered in an exaggerated manner. “I’m about to get goosebumps from all of this.”

Zu An was speechless. You don’t even have a real body, and  yet you’re saying you have goosebumps. Who are you trying to fool?

“Hmph, talk between immature lovers doesn’t suit me. I’m going to sleep,” Mi Li grumbled, then fell silent. She had a special soul body, after all, and needed to sleep a lot to recover her energy.

Zu An and Qiu Honglei had spent more time apart than together. Now that they had this rare chance to be together alone, they exchanged murmurs of endearment while looking for the female ghost.

They had clearly felt that their surroundings were sinister and frightening before, but Qiu Honglei suddenly felt as if their surroundings had gained something of a tranquil aesthetic that was perfect for a date. She was even starting to hope that they wouldn’t find the ghost, and that they could just continue to stroll around just like that.

…

Meanwhile, Wei Suo waited expectantly in the temple, thinking, My time has finally come! This is my lucky break!

He even began to clean up around the room, for fear that the female ghost would be unhappy because she found the room too messy. After sorting things out, he found a chair to sit down on. He thought, If the first female ghost failed, the second ghost definitely has to be even prettier!

After all, if Little Ying had been in a brothel in any major city, just having tea with her would cost at least 98 silvers! If a 98 silver girl was already like that, what about a 298 silver girl?!

He became more and more excited when he thought of that. However, he suddenly wondered, Wait, should I act like an upright gentleman later, or should I just give in after a bit of resistance?Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

According to the stories, whether it was female ghosts or real women, they seemed to appreciate an upright gentleman more. But he still understood the limitations of his own face. If he really did decline the woman, perhaps he really would just end up forfeiting a chance of sweet romance. Maybe I should just give in quickly…

Suddenly, his ears twitched. There seemed to be some rustling outside, followed by a knock on the door. He immediately jumped out of his seat, thinking, The beautiful female ghost is here! He rushed out eagerly to open the door.

Meanwhile, Little Ying’s Great Sister was also burning with anxiety, especially when she had heard her junior sister Little Ying talk up that young master like crazy, saying he was more handsome than any of the men they had encountered so far! She couldn't help but swallow. She felt as if today had to be her lucky day. She was even more excited when she thought about how there was a goddess-level beauty too. It was just one happy occasion after another!

Her tastes were a bit peculiar. Not only did she like men, she also liked women. She had actually desired Little Ying for a long time. Unfortunately, Grandmother had given strict orders, and she didn’t dare to go against Grandmother. And yet today, there was a woman who was even prettier than Little Ying!

I can play with them together! Either way, I have more than enough tentacles… she thought. She was a tree spirit, after all. The countless roots quickly reached Ruo Lan Temple and targeted the room with the light.

Since there are two attractive people, I shouldn’t scare them too badly. I should try some peaceful tactics before using force. Hopefully, they won’t fail to appreciate my kindness.

As such, she politely knocked on the door, but who would have thought that the door would immediately open as soon as she knocked? It was almost as if the other side had been waiting the entire time!

Both people stared at each other face to face. In that instant, Ruo Lan Temple became dead silent.

Ugh!

Both of them turned away and retched at the same time. 

“This is that ridiculously handsome young master Little Ying spoke of?!” Great Sister exclaimed furiously. Little Ying actually dared to mess with me!

“That’s it for 298? Isn’t it supposed to be someone prettier?!” Wei Suo exclaimed, equally furious. In that instant, he felt as if he had dropped from heaven straight down to hell.

Bang!

He slammed the door shut in his rage. Even though he had been looking forward to a meeting with a female ghost, he still had a bottom line!

He actually knew his own looks well. Even if the woman who came this time wasn’t that pretty, as long as she had decent features, he would likely have given in. But what the f*ck was this?!

This person doesn’t look like a guy or a girl! Compared to her, even I can be called a stud!

Great Sister erupted into a rage when she heard the curses inside. She cried, “Damn brat, you’re courting death!“

Bang!

The door was instantly smashed to pieces. Then, countless vines stormed in, wrapping around Wei Suo in an instant.

Wei Suo was alarmed and quickly tried to retaliate. Unfortunately, they were too close to each other, so his arms and legs were instantly ensnared and he couldn't use any of his skills. He could only rely on brute force to struggle.

“Hm? You have a bit of strength to you,” Great Sister said in a low and muffled voice. Her gaze swept through the room, but she didn’t see anyone else. That bitch tricked me after all!

“You are a bit on the ugly side, but your blood essence is still pretty rich,” she said as she moved closer and took a deep breath. She revealed a happy look and said, “Once I absorb you, I’ll be able to advance.”

“Ugh! Your mouth is so disgusting!” Wei Suo exclaimed as he smelled her breath from up close. He felt his stomach churn, and he almost vomited.

“You’re courting death!” Great Sister roared angrily. A thick vine lashed at Wei Suo’s face as she cried, “Just watch as I suck you dry!”

In a moment of crisis, Wei Suo quickly grabbed the vine. His face was entirely red as he used every drop of strength he had. However, he still couldn't stop the vine from getting closer and closer to his mouth.

Great Sister frowned, and a few more vines moved closer to pry Wei Suo’s hands apart.

Wei Suo was really frightened. He knew his life was in danger, but he was completely restrained and couldn't fight back. He suddenly thought of Zu An and immediately shouted, “Boss, save… Gurgle…”

In that moment of distraction, the especially thick vine broke through his defenses and shoved itself down his throat.

“Gurgle…” Wei Suo shed tears of humiliation. He had never expected that a man like him would one day experience such a freakish situation.

More importantly, this damn thing was full of hard lumps!

…

Meanwhile, Zu An and Qiu Honglei were exchanging words of endearment when they suddenly saw a woman float over to them. It was none other than the female ghost from earlier.

Zu An was about to capture her to gain some intelligence, but she suddenly revealed a look of happiness when she saw him and cried, “Young master, thank goodness nothing happened to you!”

Zu An was stunned. Now, he was too embarrassed to do anything to her.

Qiu Honglei casually stood in front of Zu An and asked, “Why would you say that?”

“My Great Sister went to Ruo Lan Temple to look for you guys. I was worried that you would be in danger,” Little Ying said, then urged them, “My Great Sister is really strong. You two should run away. It’ll be dangerous if she leaves Ruo Lan Temple and finds you!”
