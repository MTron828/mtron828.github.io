Chapter 1734: Banishment

Xie Daoyun was a genius in formations, so she quickly sensed what was wrong.

Zu An was stunned when he heard her explanation. He asked, “What do you mean?”

Yan Xuehen and the other women also looked at her.

Xie Daoyun bit her lip. Then, she quickly explained, “Previously, I was investigating whether there were any special formations buried underViolet Mountain for my master, right? This was the State Teacher’s territory, and master was worried that the State Teacher could have disloyal thoughts…”

Her expression paled halfway through her sentence, as if she had just realized something. However, she continued, “Because the State Teacher’s cultivation was too high, I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to meet master’s expectations. So, master passed some formations to me and said I could use them to check if there were any killing formations. I didn’t find anything strange during my rough inspection of the place, so I set up the formations my master taught me to check in more detail. Back then, everything was normal, and I was even about to celebrate the completion of the task…”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yun Jianyue said with a sneer, “It looks like Yan Xiangu supports the libationer after all, and he even secretly helped him set up this great formation. Violet Mountain is Wang Wuxie’s domain, so it wouldn’t have been too convenient for him to secretly come here and set up the formation. That was why he sent you instead.

“In order to not draw any suspicion at all, he even kept you in the dark. That way, while you thought you were removing hidden dangers, you were actually building a powerful killing formation.”

Xie Daoyun’s face turned completely pale. She couldn't imagine her most respected teacher exploiting her like that. She protested, “There’s no way, there’s no way!”

She suddenly thought of something and quickly argued, “Even though master’s achievements in formations are far above mine, I’ve already spent a considerable amount of time in this field too. If there really had been a killing formation on a scale as large as this one, there’s no way I wouldn’t notice a single thing!”

Yun Jianyue frowned. Indeed, that didn’t make sense.

Meanwhile, Yan Xuehen gave Xie Daoyun a sympathetic look and said, “If my suspicions are correct, the libationer and Master Yan already arranged the other parts of the formation many years ago. You only added the final pieces. Neither the portion they arranged before nor the key parts you built recently pose any threat on their own. That was why Wang Wuxie did not suspect you. The formation could then only be activated if all the pieces were put together and activated through a special method. At that point, there would no longer be any need to hide anything.”

Xie Daoyun’s face paled. She was smart enough to realize that that hypothesis was feasible. It seemed her master had indeed deceived her.

The libationer said just then, “Daoyun, do not blame your master. I was the one who planned all of this. He does not actually know of it.”

Xie Daoyun pursed her lips. Her master had already reached such an incredible level in formations, and there were rumors that the disciple had already surpassed the master. How could the libationer’s actions be hidden from him? He clearly had to be in the know as well.

Zhao Han harrumphed. “Look at you, still trying to cover things up for Yan Xiangu. It seems you are quite worried about a possible defeat today, and that I will take my anger out on him.”

The libationer smiled and replied, “Isn’t your majesty a bit too confident? I might not necessarily be defeated today.”

Zhao Han’s expression changed as he said, “I want to see just what kind of formation can defeat me then.”

As soon as he spoke, he vanished from his original location. After a moment, however, blue ripples suddenly spread in the air, as if something had slammed against them. Zhao Han reappeared near his original location. His expression turned a bit grave as he exclaimed, “Spatial restriction?”

Previously, the Righteous Sun Sect’s mountain defense formation paired with some of the shamans’ formations had achieved a similar restrictive effect. However, with Zhao Han’s cultivation, those restrictions hadn’t been able to display their full effects. The reason he had pretended to be affected was to see if he could draw out bigger fish.

However, this great formation the libationer had activated actually prevented him from leaving. At that instant, he had an ominous premonition.

Still, he calmed himself down and remarked, “By borrowing the power of the Violet Mountain Range, you have indeed created quite the shocking formation. But the fact that you used up so much of your energy on this spatial restriction means its offensive ability will have decreased correspondingly. I refuse to believe that you can still injure me.”

Even though ‘adults can have everything’ was a principle, most other things had their own principles as well. Having everything wasn’t so easy.

The formation was good at restricting spatial movements, but it was a bit weaker in other aspects. Its power could be enough to kill other powerful cultivators, but it would be a bit lacking against Zhao Han.

The libationer could personally enter the formation, but if he entered, Zhao Han was still confident that he could win a one-on-one fight. If the libationer didn’t enter, however, Zhao Han just had to wait. Time was on his side. He knew that even someone of the libationer’s ability couldn't maintain a formation of such a scale for that long. Once the formation weakened, that would provide a chance to kill the libationer.

And yet, the libationer seemed completely unsurprised. He replied, “Indeed, with your cultivation, trying to kill you through a great battle wouldn’t be all that realistic. But who said this was an offensive formation?”

Zhao Han was stunned. Only then did he realize that even though the formation gave off great power, he didn’t sense any offensive properties to it at all. He asked gravely, “What kind of formation is this?”

The libationer said calmly, “I’ve spent a long time researching how to defeat you. Even though I believed that with my cultivation, I could fight against you, I didn’t have that much confidence in winning. That was why I began to think about the issue from other perspectives. In the end, heaven doesn’t disappoint those who are determined, so I finally found a solution.”

He paused for a moment before looking at Zhao Han and said, “Since I can’t defeat you, I’ll just banish you to a place of nothingness you’ll never be able to return from. The result will be no different from killing you.”

When he heard those words, Zhao Han’s expression changed greatly.

At his cultivation realm, he naturally knew that this wasn’t the only world in the universe. There were many other worlds. For example, the secret dungeons were smaller worlds in their own right. Of course, apart from secret dungeons, there were larger-scale worlds too.

However, between worlds, there was vast and endless spatial chaos. Even earth immortals wouldn’t be able to endure such destructive astral winds forever. They could end up being completely destroyed by the chaos before they even arrived in another world.

That was why, since ancient times, those who stood at the very peak of cultivation wanted to become immortals. On one hand, they would gain endless longevity, while on the other, they could move freely through the chaos in search of legendary worlds.

The libationer’s method was none other than to banish Zhao Han into a chaotic void stream. If the void stream was close enough to this world, perhaps he would be able to hold on and return. However, the libationer had schemed for so many years. How could he possibly make such a mistake?

When he thought of that, Zhao Han could no longer remain calm. With a roar, he turned into a giant golden statue. His giant fist seemed to carry world-destroying might as it smashed toward the void. 

“Break!”
