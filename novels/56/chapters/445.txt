Chapter 445: An Impossible Condition

Translator: Pika

Zu An’s eyebrows slowly lifted as he examined the beauty in front of him without restraint. “Those who ask this sort of question usually resort to seduction immediately afterwards. I really hope you don’t disappoint me.”

Yun Yuqing was taken aback. “You really are quite special. You’re different from most men.”

Zu An laughed. “There are many ways in which I am different from most men. Please feel free to try me!”

From the aggressiveness in his eye, Yun Yuqing knew that he was trying to provoke her. However, she did not grow enraged, but smiled sweetly instead. “You still haven’t replied to my question,” she said?

“Are you pretty?” Zu An laughed when he recalled her question. “Why does Madam ask a question you already know the answer to? If Madam isn’t beautiful, then I fear that there are no beautiful people in this entire world.”

“I wonder, then, where do I rank in your mind?” A flicker of radiance rippled across Yun Yuqing’s eyes.

Zu An secretly put up his guard. Surely she was chatting with him like this to get him to relax, and then seize that opportunity to control him, right?

With that in mind, he said nonchalantly, “If I had to guess, I’d put you somewhere in the top ten.”

“Top ten?” Even though she knew that he was saying this on purpose, his reply still rubbed her the wrong way. “It seems that you’ve encountered your fair share of beauties despite your young age. I wonder who the young master thinks is prettier than me?”

Zu An sneered inwardly. Hah! Women!

Most of the girls he’d interacted with were extremely petty about this.

He coughed lightly and said, “The first is obviously my wife.”

Yun Yuqing nodded. “First miss Chu is known as Brightmoon City’s number one beauty. She is also your wife. Taken together, it’s understandable that she would be number one. Then what about the others?”

“Number two is the previous number one beauty from the capital, Yu Yanluo. You’re still a little inferior compared to her,” said Zu An.

“You know Yu Yanluo?” Yun Yuqing was incredulous.

“Know her? It goes way beyond that—I even saved her life once. She said she was going to pay me back, but she vanished. I’m honestly a bit pissed off about that,” Zu An said angrily. Yu Yanluo had given him a blank check back then, but he hadn’t seen any sign of her after all these months.

“Maybe she had something else to attend to.” Yun Yuqing’s eyes flickered with radiance. She said with a giggle, “Miss Yu was incredibly popular back in the capital, so I can accept her being ranked in front of me. Anyone else?”

“Naturally, the third most beautiful is Pei Mianman.” Zu An replied.

“The Pei clan’s first miss? I’ve heard a bit about her, but I didn’t expect her to be that pretty. I need to find a chance to meet with her in the future.” Even though this was what Yun Yuqing said, she was still unconvinced.

“Don’t worry, there’s no way you can compare to her.” Zu An’s eyes landed on her chest. “Your figure isn’t bad, but it’s still quite lacking compared to hers.”

Yun Yuqing gritted her teeth silently.

She obviously knew what he was implying! This guy really was a scoundrel!

You have successfully trolled Yun Yuqing for 514 Rage points!

Seeing that this was working, Zu An continued, “The fourth is my Brightmoon Academy’s Principal Jiang. She gives off such a mature aura, and her long legs, clad in those stockings she always wears, is not something Madam can compare to. Of course, if Madam wants to prove me wrong, you can show me your legs, and I will render an impartial judgment.”

Yun Yuqing was shell-shocked.

The way he was going on and on so freely was truly driving her crazy.

Just what kind of lunatic was he? Was he so unaware of the situation he was in? Was he really going to list off these beauties one by one?

You have successfully trolled Yun Yuqing for 666 Rage points!

“It seems as though Madam isn’t confident in comparing herself to these others anymore, so I’ll just continue on to the next one. The fifth is of course everyone’s idol in the academy, Teacher Shang Liuyu. She is beautiful, kind, and she is proficient in music. She truly gives off an otherworldly charm, as though she really doesn’t care about the things of the material world. It’s very different from the way Madam pretends to behave. She is truly like a goddess trapped in the vile world of men. Sigh, I thought we shared a close relationship, but I haven’t seen a single sign of her ever since this disaster befell me. Don’t you think she’s being cold?” Zu An got quite worked up as he spoke.

Yun Yuqing was about to blow her top.

“As for the sixth one, that’s of course—” Zu An was cut off before he could finish.

“Enough!” Yun Yuqing’s face darkened. She had only planned to tease him a little—she never expected him to truly go on and on about all the girls he thought were more beautiful than her! The more she listened, the angrier she had become.

Zu An curled his lips. Is that all? I didn’t even bring out my trump card big sis empress yet. Compared to her, you all are nothing.

He did his best to flatter her, but Mi Li didn’t respond at all. It looks like this woman really did go to sleep.

“I almost fell for your schemes. You wanted to drag things out to buy some time for King Liang and the others to come back, didn’t you?” Yun Yuqing snorted. “I advise you to give up on that thought. King Wu is holding them up on his side. There is no way they will come here any time soon.”

Zu An sighed in his heart. This woman really was careful! However, his smile remained plastered on his face. “What is Madam saying? Why would I rather be with those disgusting old men than with your gorgeous self?”

“Disgusting old men?” Yu Yuqing was initially stunned by this, but she quickly burst out laughing. “Indeed, they are indeed two disgusting old men.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Did they really believe that she hadn’t noticed all the sneaky looks that they had directed towards her? Hmph, those two really are disgusting.

She was more annoyed with Liu Yao than the other, because he had opposed King Wu at every turn. She quickly collected herself and looked at Zu An. “Young master, you’re putting me in a difficult spot. I can’t kill you, and I can’t bear to hurt you. What do you think we should do, then?”

“Madam can try to seduce me. I’m impervious to everything else, but I’m really weak to honey traps!” Zu An said with a serious voice.

Yun Yuqing stared at him blankly for a second.

“I have eighteen maids with me, and all of them are the most beautiful ladies from the demon race.” She pointed outside the window. “If you give me what I want, then you can choose whoever you want outside. Of course, if you have the ability, you can do what you want with all of them.”

Zu An shook his head. “I don’t want to. All of them added together cannot compare to one of Madam’s fingers.”

“You want me?” Yun Yuqing had an ambiguous smile on her face, but a dangerous glint flashed across her eyes. “Didn’t you just say that I was inferior to all those other girls you know?”

“I always rate the ones I am closer to more highly. Feel free to change my mind, Madam.” Zu An went all out as well. He wasn’t going to be killed, since the emperor wanted him alive, and they couldn’t hurt him, since that might damage his intelligence. What did he have to be scared of?

“You really are quite daring. If I ever encountered anyone who dared to offend me like this, King Wu would have immediately had them chopped up and fed to the dogs,” Yun Yuqing said coldly.

Zu An laughed. “Aren’t you here at King Wu’s prodding, though? I wonder if he told you to seduce me as well.”

Yun Yuqing’s beautiful brows drew together in a frown. It seemed like he’d hit the nail on the head.

Zu An continued, “I believe Madam is also aware that I am already a dead man once I reach the capital. In that case, I might as well make the most of my current situation.”

Yun Yuqing’s expression eased a little. “I’m glad the young master is willing to talk. That makes things easier. We actually come with great sincerity. If the young master wants gems, gold, weapons, or secret manuals, as long as we are able, we will satisfy your desire.”

Compared to the legendary Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, it would be worth it even if King Wu emptied the entire manor.

“Didn’t I already state what I wanted?” Zu An looked straight at her. “I’m going to die anyway, so what good would material possessions be? If I can feel Madam’s warmth, I would be willing to leave this world with no regrets.”

He wasn’t actually planning to recite the manual for them, so he proposed a condition that neither King Wu or Madam Wu would be willing to accept.

Unexpectedly, Yun Yuqing’s expression flickered several times, and then she nodded her head. Her voice grew warm. “Very well!”
