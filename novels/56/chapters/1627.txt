Chapter 1576: Despair

“What kind of person is brother-in-law?” remarked a ‘young man’ with pretty features, who rushed over when he heard the conversation. Who else could it be but Chu Youzhao? 

Zu An couldn't help but sigh in amazement. Even though she was also a handsome ‘young man’, Youzhao was still a bit cuter. Xie Xiu still had one of ‘those’ in the end.

Of course, the tan-skinned Murong Qinghe was inseparable from Chu Youzhao. She was secretly observing Xie Xiu as well, her brows slightly furrowed. The other ladies in the capital had made it sound as if his handsomeness was unparalleled in this world. Some had even said they had found meaning in life through liking him, and that they were able to approach life with greater positivity because of him, and other such things.

However, after seeing Xie Xiu several times, she still felt that her big brother Chu was more handsome. It was to the extent that she even felt big brother Zu was more handsome than him. Just what in the world made all the other women so infatuated?

Xie Xiu knew Murong Qinghe was obsessed with the Chu clan’s heir and that they were always together, so he immediately dropped all interest in her. Furthermore, the Xie clan and Chu clan had always been close to each other to begin with. For him, he only liked women who were completely dedicated to him. Other people’s wives and girlfriends? That was all heresy. He really didn’t understand what kind of pervert would like such a thing.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

When their eyes met, they immediately separated. Neither one of them considered the other in the slightest.

Because there were so many attractive men and women gathered in one spot, many people came over to see what was happening. Xie Xiu was worried that he would draw the attention of some crazy women if his identity was exposed. He cupped his hands toward Zu An and said, “Brother Zu, I’ll be entrusting you with my sister’s safety. Also, remember not to take care of her too much.” After saying that, he put on his mask again and disappeared into the crowd.

Chu Youzhao quickly realized something and asked, “Why do you need to take care of his big sister?”

Her big sister wasn’t there, so she had to protect her brother-in-law from random vixens in her place. She couldn't let them steal him away while she was busy.

Zu An gave her a rough summary of what had happened. Murong Qinghe was confused, saying, “Miss Xie comes from a literary family and isn’t too familiar with the dangers and ways of the world of warriors. However, why did he tell you to take care of her? Also, who says it that way?”

Zu An began to sweat. He couldn't just say that Xie Xiu was telling him not to take his sister to bed, right? He just found some random excuse to appease her.

…

Eventually, the group began to hurry the onlookers along. Chu Youzhao reluctantly bid Zu An goodbye.

Murong Qinghe looked at Chu Youzhao in confusion, thinking that her big brother Chu was usually pretty manly. Why was it that whenever they met big brother Zu, he started acting like a girl? Besides, wasn’t their relationship a bit too good?

She was suddenly shocked, thinking, Could it be that big brother Chu likes men?

She felt very conflicted when that thought emerged. She wanted to ask about it, but she was too scared to. In the end, she could only console herself and say that it was probably because her big brother Chu was still too young, and thus felt a natural adoration toward outstanding heroes. Big brother Zu was indeed much more formidable than the other young masters in the capital. Together with being his brother-in-law, such admiration was normal.

Zu An naturally didn’t know that his relationship with Chu Youzhao had ended up being distorted in such a way. When he returned to the departing group, Deputy General Zhang Zijiang said with a smile, “It seems Sir Zu’s friends all have outstanding backgrounds. It really is quite enviable.”

Off to the side, Wang Bolin harrumphed, clearly believing that Zu An hadn’t risen to his current position by relying on his own background.

Zu An just smiled and ignored their hostility. He didn’t feel like explaining himself either. He was already someone who only viewed people like the Fiend Emperor and Zhao Han as his competitors, so why would he care about such things?

The group headed toward Violet Mountain. Along the way, Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang came to Zu An several times to discuss plans and arrangements for the trip.

“I know that the two of you are veteran generals in the army and are familiar with these details. We’ll just do things according to your suggestions,” Zu An replied politely.

Wang Bolin only felt more disdain toward Zu An when he saw how meekly Zu An acted. Zhang Zijiang still maintained his respect on the surface at first, but after a few days, he saw that Zu An didn’t give any suggestions at all and that the two of them were deciding everything. Furthermore, he couldn't sense the slightest ki aura coming from Zu An, as if he were just an ordinary person, so he couldn't help but start to feel disdain too.

Perhaps this Zu An had had some ability in the past, but he had most likely suffered some great damage to his cultivation. His position had to be completely because of his connections. 

Unfortunately, our Great Zhou Dynasty only cares about strength. Those who don’t have the skills to match their status only have disaster awaiting them.

Their changes in attitude didn’t escape Zu An’s notice. However, he didn’t take it to heart. In his opinion, the logistics of their trip, such as where to set up camp, the repair of the buildings on Violet Mountain, and eliminating hidden dangers, didn’t need his involvement. These two hadn’t realized the true danger yet.

…

Just like that, a few days passed. Suddenly, the scouts reported that an intense battle was happening in a valley several dozen miles out. The fight didn’t involve any authorities, so it was likely bandits.

Zu An said, “Seeing as they’re just bandits, just leave it to the local officials. We have a bigger mission at hand, so we can’t let ourselves be hindered by that.”

Because Zhao Han was the one he thought of as his opponent, he didn’t really want to make enemies with the rebels fighting against the court. He had his relationship with Yun Jianyue, too. If he recalled correctly, the Devil Sect seemed to have its own rebel army. It wouldn’t be good if he ended up committing friendly fire.

However, Zhang Zijiang said with a resolute expression, “We are the army of the son of heaven and have the duty of supporting the ruler in governing the country. As we have encountered it, how can we just overlook it?”

Even though the Armed Escort Division in the Imperial Palace sounded amazing, there weren’t many areas that needed military intervention, so there weren’t any opportunities to accumulate merit. The Violet Mountain trip was a task where they only had to go through the motions. His majesty was unmatched; which idiot would dare to go against him?

He assumed the Violet Mountain mission was nothing more than part of the process. It wasn’t some great contribution. However, if they dealt with a group of bandits along the way, that would be different. Even though the world was at peace, because of the rebels led by Lu Sanyuan, there were always sparks of conflict here and there. That left the court with a huge headache.

If he could suppress this group of bandits and establish a great achievement, perhaps he would be able to rise up. Even if Zu An had already taken the position of Armed Escort Division leader, he could go elsewhere, such as the Bright Tiger or First Riders divisions.

Zu An said seriously, “We have our own mission and we don’t have much intelligence about the enemy. If we acted hastily and held up our mission, it would be a great crime that would be punished upon our return.”

Just then, Wang Bolin sneered. “How can some trifling bandits be anything major? If Sir Zu is worried, this one is willing to lead fifty members of the Armed Escort Division to eliminate the enemy.”

He didn’t even wait for Zu An to agree. He took fifty Armed Escort Division members he was close to and headed directly west.

Zhang Zijiang panicked when he saw that. If Wang Bolin took all the achievements, wouldn’t he be left in the dust? As such, he pointed at fifty other Armed Escort Division Guards and said, “Sir Zu, please rest here for a bit. This one will be back soon.” He also took fifty men and rushed out afterward, for of fear of being outdone by Wang Bolin.

The entire Armed Escort Division now noticed the strange things happening with their superiors. They saw that the deputy generals didn’t give their leader any respect, and yet the leader couldn't do a thing. As such, the way they looked at Zu An also became a bit strange.

Only the group who had followed Zu An to Cloudcenter Commandery before felt resentful. However, they made up just too small a proportion of the Armed Escort Division, and couldn't affect the overall situation at all.

Zu An’s expression remained calm. He looked toward the valley in the southwest. He thought to himself, I’ve already done what I could. I hope the volunteer army on that side will accomplish what they wish for.

…

Meanwhile, in the valley, a graceful and gentle-looking figure was fleeing for her life. There was a rebel army all around her. For some reason, they all insisted on chasing her down. When she felt the exhausted ki within her, a hint of despair flickered across her face.
