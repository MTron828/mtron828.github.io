Chapter 1388: Stupefied

When their lips separated and she saw Zu An stare at the two of them, completely stupefied, Yu Yanluo’s cheeks flushed with warmth. She hadn’t realized what was going on when she was trying to save Yun Jianyue, but after seeing his reaction, she felt extremely embarrassed. She thought, Ah… Ah Zu won’t dislike that I kissed someone else, right? Even though she’s also a woman…

Yun Jianyue’s heart was pounding like crazy. However, when she saw Zu An looking at her, with her naturally tough nature, she shot him a glare and said, “What are you staring at? You’ve never seen women kiss before?”

When she heard the question, Yu Yanluo’s cheeks turned even redder. She really wanted to run away and hide on the spot.

“I've never seen two women who were this pretty kiss before,” Zu An said with a strange expression. “But now’s not the time to talk about that. Yan Xuehen can’t hold on for much longer.”

“You’re surprisingly considerate of her.” Yun Jianyue sneered. However, even though that was what she said, her gaze shifted toward Yan Xuehen.

There was black energy swirling around Yan Xuehen’s face, as if she could be completely overtaken by the resentment at any time. Yun Jianyue wanted to return Lord Sui’s Pearl to Yu Yanluo, but that would take too much time. As such, she just picked up Yan Xuehen and bent down to deliver it to her.

Why are this woman’s lips so tight?

Yun Jianyue initially wanted to just get it over with as quickly as possible, but she hadn’t expected the unconscious Yan Xuehen to be so uncooperative, so now it almost looked as if she were taking advantage of the other woman or something. She felt ashamed and annoyed when she noticed the scorching gazes on her.

“Use your tongue to open them…” Yu Yanluo said weakly. She seemed to be growing anxious as she reminded Yun Jianyue.

“Do you think I don’t know that? Do I need you to teach me?” Yun Jianyue snapped with wide eyes. However, she was actually really embarrassed. That was how she had been saved by Yu Yanluo just then, and the worst part was that the brat Zu An had seen it happen. She found herself very hard-pressed.

Zu An couldn't help but laugh. Even though this woman always spoke so harshly, it was clear that she had never done such a thing before from her movements.Still, that shouldn’t have been the case, right? She was known for her charm skills, so why was she so inexperienced?

Yun Jianyue finally made some progress. Lord Sui’s Pearl slowly entered Yan Xuehen’s mouth. She could feel the faint radiance coming from Lord Sui’s Pearl even through her skin; it had already begun showing its effects. The black scales on Yan Xuehen’s face also began to retreat at a visible speed.

Finally, Yan Xuehen slowly woke up with a groan. However, she saw that Yun Jianyue was kissing her as soon as she woke up. She immediately jumped in fright, instinctively pushing her away.

“What are you doing?!” she exclaimed, feeling ashamed and furious. However, the special sensation in her mouth soon left her stunned.

“Woman, do you have no sense of others’ good intentions?!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, staggering and almost falling because she was caught off guard. She just happened to fall on Zu An. For some reason, she felt extremely uncomfortable when Zu An supported her. She moved his hands away and stared at Yan Xuehen, protesting, “I even sacrificed my own purity to save you, but this is how you repay me?”

Zu An and Yu Yanluo were speechless.

What do you mean, sacrifice your purity?!

When he saw that Yan Xuehen was instinctively trying to spit out the item in her mouth, Zu An quickly stopped her, calling out, “Don’t spit it out! Keep it inside!”

Yu Yanluo’s face immediately turned red. She gave Zu An an annoyed look. Zu An would always say those words when the two of them were playing around!

“What you have in your mouth is Lord Sui’s Pearl from Yu Yanluo. It can suppress the resentment in your body to a certain extent. Keep it there for a while to force out some of the resentment first,” Zu An explained.

Yan Xuehen quickly rubbed her own cheeks. She sighed in relief when she noticed that the black scales had already withdrawn to her neck. She smiled at Yu Yanluo and bowed slightly, saying, “Thank you, little sister Yu.”

“Are you not going to thank me?” Yun Jianyue asked in annoyance.

There was no way Yan Xuehen would be willing to show weakness to her. She retorted, “Should you not be thanking little sister Yu too?”

Yun Jianyue’s breath caught in her throat. She didn’t retort, and could only thank Yu Yanluo first.

Afterward, she was about to bother Yan Xuehen again, but the other woman had already changed the topic. “Ah Zu, what is at the top of the mountain? Why are we climbing toward the top?”

If they continued to walk toward where the resentment was the strongest, it would only become more and more dangerous.

“I don’t know either,” Zu An replied. When he saw how confused all three women were, however, he quickly said, “All things in this world have a natural counter. The place where the poison comes from is often where the antidote can be found too. I have a feeling that there’s definitely a way to save us up there.”

Those were actually things Mi Li had told him, so he couldn't really explain it in detail.

Yun Jianyue nodded and said, “I agree with Little An’s plan. We have the Fiend Emperor and that… Taowu or something fighting behind us. We’d be done for regardless of which one we ended up in the hands of. We might as well give this plan a chance.”

Yu Yanluo and Yan Xuehen were extraordinary individuals too. They both expressed their agreement.

…

Along the way, Yun Jianyue asked Zu An, “Hey, why do you recognize that monster’s name?”

Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue also looked at him curiously. After all, they were all knowledgeable in their own right, and yet they had never seen that thing before. Not even the Fiend Emperor knew what it was.

“I saw it in an ancient text before,” Zu An said. He couldn't just tell them he was a transmigrator, right?

“Which ancient text?”

“The Classic of Mountains and Seas[1].”

“Classic of Mountains and Seas? Why haven’t I ever heard of that before?”

…

Just like that, the group continued to climb the mountain.

After they traveled for a long time, however, Yu Yanluo’s legs suddenly buckled and she fell. Zu An quickly supported her. Only then did they notice that while they were chatting, she had been corroded by the resentment. The black scales were already reaching her face.

“It’s all my fault!” Yan Xuehen cried out in regret. She quickly kneeled down and passed Lord Sui’s Pearl into Yu Yanluo’s mouth.

When she saw Yan Xuehen’s tongue proficiently separate Yu Yanluo’s lips, Yun Jianyue’s eyes widened in disbelief. She thought, This stone cold woman should be even more inexperienced than me, so why is she doing better than me?

After Lord Sui’s Pearl returned to her, Yu Yanluo also gradually woke up again. Her eyes met Yan Xuehen’s. When they saw how close their faces were to each other, both women quickly backed up.

“Thank you,” Yu Yanluo said in embarrassment.

“It should be me thanking you,” Yan Xuehen said in praise. “You are our life-saving benefactor.”

When he saw the women apologize to each other, Zu An reminded them, “We need to pay more attention from here on out and pass the pearl along ahead of time to prevent accidents from happening. If the resentment passes a certain threshold, not even Lord Sui’s Pearl might be able to save us.”

He looked toward Yun Jianyue while saying that. She had had Lord Sui’s Pearl for the shortest time out of anyone, and the black scales had already crept up to her chin.

“Okay…” The three women’s voices all became a bit softer. For some reason, their cheeks reddened.

The group continued forward. After learning their previous lesson, the three of them exchanged the pearl ahead of time. At first, they were still a bit embarrassed, so they didn’t use their mouths and instead took out the pearl, upon which the other person swallowed it.

As they continued, however, the resentment grew stronger and stronger, so the black scales grew faster and faster too. There was no time to waste at all, so they just returned to the method they had used in the beginning. They found it awkward at first, but they got more used to it over time.

That process continued for a long time before being interrupted by a sudden thud. Zu An had collapsed onto the ground.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The women were shocked. They quickly went to help him, and only then did they notice that Zu An’s face was already covered in many black scales. If not for his constitution and the Primordial Origin Sutra’s natural resistance to the resentment, he would have already been a lost cause. The fact that he was able to last so long was already a miracle in itself.

“Hurry and feed him the pearl!” Yu Yanluo exclaimed while carrying Zu An, her expression filled with alarm and confusion. She was even sobbing a bit.

Yun Jianyue’s expression was strange, because the pearl was in Yan Xuehen’s mouth. With that stone cold woman’s nature, how could she be willing? She could end up wasting time, and then Zu An could die at any time.

She thought about how to convince Yan Xuehen as quickly as possible, but she didn’t expect that the other woman wouldn’t hesitate at all. Yan Xuehen bent down and kissed him immediately.

Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue were immediately stupefied.

1. The Classic of Mountains and Seas is a Chinese classic text and a compilation of mythic geography and beasts. The book is not a narrative, as the "plot" involves detailed descriptions of locations in the cardinal directions of the Mountains, Regions Beyond Seas, Regions Within Seas, and Wilderness. The descriptions are usually of medicines, animals, and geological features. Many descriptions are very mundane, and an equal number are fanciful or strange. Each chapter follows roughly the same formula, and the whole book is repetitious in this way. It contains many short myths, and most rarely exceed a paragraph. A famous ancient Chinese myth from this book is that of Yu the Great, who spent years trying to control the deluge. ☜
