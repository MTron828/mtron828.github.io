Chapter 648: Completely Played

Translator: Pika

The government whorehouse wasn’t a single building, but rather several courtyards. Ordinary girls would do business together, but every courtesan queen had their own private place.

The government brothel had more than one courtesan queen. As such, it was easy to imagine how large this place was.

“It’s been reserved?” Zu An frowned. He didn’t expect to run into something like this.

He tossed the worker a silver coin. “Help me think of something. It wasn’t easy for me to make this trip.”

He wanted to investigate Cheng Gang and that courtesan queen to see if he could get any useful information, but what was going on here?

The worker’s eyes lit up when he saw the silver coin. He immediately showed Zu An a huge smile. “Young master, please come inside first. Let me see if Lady Shuangyue can make any accommodations.”

He was brought inside and taken through several turns. Eventually, they arrived at a small courtyard. This place was quite refined and didn’t have too much feminine qualities. It didn’t feel like one came to a brothel, but rather a young lady’s chambers.

Zu An was given some tea and asked to wait in the courtyard. That worker quickly went inside to give a report.

Shuangyue was currently dressing and grooming herself in front of a mirror, reclining to her side was a woman. Her seductive figure and charming expression were enough to even move the hearts of other women.

“Shuangyue, you’re growing prettier and prettier.” The girl who was lying down said with a smile. Her voice was so soothing it could melt bones.

The courtesan queen who sat in front of the mirror rolled her eyes. “Miss, can you stop making fun of me? How can my looks even compare to yours? These men in the capital haven’t seen much. If they visited Brightmoon City and met you, would they even touch a courtesan queen like me?”

The girl who was lying down said with a smile, “Come on, you don’t need to bring yourself down like that. There are areas where I am inferior to you, like how you are a catwoman. This is something many men cannot resist at all.”

The courtesan queen was startled. “Ah, you’re making fun of me!”

While the two of them were chatting, a knocking sounded from outside. The worker brought in a message. “Lady, there is a young master outside who wishes to meet you.”

The courtesan queen’s expression sunk. “Are you stupid? I’ve already been reserved by Young Master Cheng for the whole night, yet you still dare bring someone in? Did that man bribe you?”

“I do not dare! I will immediately reject that young master.” The worker immediately apologized. He quickly left after saying this.

The girl who was lying down got up. She stretched her body lazily, accentuating her stunning curves. “See? There are so many men who are chasing after you. Isn’t your charm apparent?”

The courtesan queen scoffed. “They’re all some ugly guys.”

“Alright, alright, I won’t tease you anymore.” That woman put away her smile. “By the way, that Cheng Gang seems to have invited some important people today. They should all be from King Qi’s faction if I am not mistaken. You must carefully observe what they are discussing.”

The flower courtesan voiced her acknowledgment. “I’ve already fully obtained his trust from these past few days. He won’t disappoint.”

“That’s good. I’m going out for some fresh air first.” The girl who was lying down stood up.

The flower courtesan smiled. “Please be careful. If the ugly men of this place see you, they'll go crazy.”

“You’re getting more and more brave. You’re even teasing me now.” That girl harrumphed and left through the side door.

Zu An couldn’t help but frown when he heard the worker’s response.

That worker said, “How about I introduce another flower courtesan to the young master? I promise that she won’t be worse than Lady Shuangyue.”

He didn’t dare offend someone this liberal with money. Furthermore, he already took his money, so he had to take care of him well.

“There’s no need.” Zu An shook his head. He wondered if he should just sneak in later? Either way, he could control the small creatures in the vicinity. As long as it wasn’t too far, he should be able to hear what Cheng Gang and this flower courtesan talked about.

He subconsciously gave the second floor where the courtesan queen was a look. He just happened to see a beautiful figure walk out.

That figure was originally unhappy to see a boorish man look at her, but she immediately smiled brilliantly when she saw who it was.

Zu An also smiled. He said to the worker, “You should go and do what you need to. I’ll leave after sitting here for a bit longer.”

That worker thought that Zu An was reluctant to part with Shuangyue and wanted to sit here to admire the other party. He sneered inside, but on the outside, he showed a flattering smile. “Then please feel at ease, young master.”

He quickly left after saying this out of fear that this man will ask for that silver ingot back.

That figure already arrived at Zu An’s side after a fragrant breeze. “Why did you come here?”

Zu An also had a weird look on his face. “What are you doing here? Don’t tell me that courtesan queen is you?”

The beautiful woman was naturally Qiu Honglei. She seemed even more stunning under the brothel’s lanterns.

But for some reason, Zu An felt extremely unhappy inside.

“You jealous?” Qiu Honglei was a clever girl. She immediately knew what he was thinking and teased with a smile.

Zu An harrumphed. “I heard that the courtesan queen has a good relationship with Cheng clan’s young master. Did I come at a bad time?”

Qiu Honglei grabbed his arm. “Don’t worry, that courtesan queen isn’t me.”

Zu An felt his body soften from being embraced. All of his irritation disappeared as well.

Qiu Honglei’s eyes suddenly moved around. “Were you the one who bribed that worker just now?”

Zu An’s smile froze. He suddenly felt like his reputation was done for. He coughed and said, “Of course not. Am I the type who would spend money to meet with a courtesan queen?”

Qiu Honglei giggled and didn’t bother exposing him. She pulled him towards the brothel. “It’s easy if you want to meet the courtesan queen. I’ll just bring you over.”

Zu An was stunned. “You know her?”

“Not only do I know her, you do too.” Qiu Honglei said with a laugh.

Zu An was confused. When he entered the room, he saw a familiar figure.

“Miss, why did you come back so… Huh? Young Master Zu?” That courtesan queen was completely shocked.

Zu An’s eyelids jumped. “So you were Lady Leng.”

This courtesan queen was precisely Qiu Honglei’s maid in Immortal Abode, the catwoman Leng Shuangyue!

Ah, what the heck… If I knew that, I wouldn’t have spent all that silver.

Leng Shuangyue smiled. “Young master still remembers my name.”

Zu An asked with curiosity, “Why are you guys here?”

Leng Shuangyue wanted to say something, but hesitated. She subconsciously looked to Qiu Honglei. Qiu Honglei said, “It’s fine, he’s one of us. This is precisely our Holy Sect’s capital city branch!”

Leng Shuangyue was stunned. She thought to herself that the saintess really trusted this man. She even told him such a high level secret!

Zu An had a strange look on his face. “You guys managed to reach all the way into the government brothel? You guys are quite formidable!”

The government brothel was different from a normal one. This was a facility run by the state, and every girl’s identity was documented and their background researched, yet the Devil Sect managed to seep their influence all the way here! This was quite a difficult task.

Qiu Honglei sneered. “As long as there are men involved, there is nothing we cannot deal with.”

Zu An thus remembered how powerful the seduction she cultivated was. There were likely other girls who excelled in this field. Normal men wouldn’t be able to withstand something like that at all.

“But isn’t a place like the government brothel a bit too foul? Aren’t your Holy Sect’s people making too great of a sacrifice?” Zu An said with a frown.

Qiu Honglei had him sit down on a chair to the side. “I know what you are worried about, but our sect has a special department who specializes in this field. The method they cultivate is special, and mingling between the sexes is actually beneficial towards their cultivation.”

Zu An subconsciously glanced at the catwoman. Is this the so-called sexual arts?

Qiu Honglei said in annoyance, “What are you looking at her like that for? She’s not sleeping with any guests and is still a virgin! If you like her, I can have her take care of you though.”

“Miss!” The catwoman stomped her feet. She was clearly embarrassed and distressed.

Zu An was curious. “Then is Cheng Gang an idiot? I heard that he was quite ensnared with her. Did he not get any benefits at all?”

Qiu Honglei explained, “Our sect’s charm technique can place one in an illusion. Even though Shuangyue hasn’t reached that level yet, she can make Cheng Gang enter an illusion with the help of some medicines and… alleviate himself.”

Zu An now understood what was happening. So that Cheng Gang was being completely played here! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

A servant girl knocked on the door and reported, “Miss, Young Master Cheng’s group has arrived.”
