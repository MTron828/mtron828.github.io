Chapter 283: Buying Freedom

Translator: Pika

“Correct!” Chen Xuan’s face distorted the instant he heard Zu An’s name. There was no way he could live under the same sky with the one who killed his brother.

Not only did he not recognize his sworn enemy the last time they crossed paths in the Immortal Abode, that kid had even made him look like a fool. Just the mention of the brat was enough to drive him absolutely furious.

You have successfully trolled Chen Xuan for 404 Rage points!

Chen Xuan gave the woman a suspicious look. “Why would the gang boss suddenly mention this person?”

The woman smiled faintly. “Just curiosity, mainly. I haven’t ever heard Stockade Master Chen openly declare that he wanted to kill someone before. Yet this person is still alive, even though a few days have already passed. Does this Zu An have some kind of outstanding ability?”

Chen Xuan scoffed angrily, “He isn’t too outstanding himself, but he has quite the wife and father-in-law. The Chu clan’s son-in-law isn’t that easy to kill.”

The last time that little bastard had paraded around town, he could only tail him from the shadows. He’d been certain that there was some kind of ambush waiting. However, he hadn’t noticed anything, which made him even more wary of making a move.

The reason the Blackwind Stockade had lasted this long wasn’t because of his high cultivation, but rather because of his prudence.

Fortunately, even though he hadn’t yet been able to kill Zu An, he was still able to kidnap Wang Yuanlong along the way.

“I have heard some things about the Chu clan’s new son-in-law as well. He is not only under the Chu clan’s protection, he also has a position in Brightmoon Academy. If I may ask, how does the stockade master plan on killing him?” the woman continued to probe curiously.

“Won’t the gang boss find out after I kill him?” Cheng Xuan obviously didn’t want his plan exposed. Her questioning made him put up his guard.

The woman smiled when she saw the change in his expression. “Please don’t be nervous, stockade master. I was merely concerned because this isn't Blackwind Stockade’s domain. Does the stockade master need our Whale Gang’s assistance?”

Chen Xuan shook his head. “There is no need. I don’t need anyone else’s help if I want someone dead,” he said coldly.

“Then I wish the stockade master success.” A hint of a smile appeared in this woman’s eyes. The way she looked would have melted the hearts of any man.

Chen Xuan stared hungrily at her. He had a sudden impulse to run over and rip off the veil covering her face, but his rational self-restraint prevailed in the end. He got up and bid her farewell. “Since we’ve reached an agreement, I shall take my leave.”

He’d been gone a long time. He was slightly worried that something strange would unexpectedly happen in the city. it was probably better to leave sooner rather than later.

As for this woman, she’d be his one day, anyway.

“Take care on your way home. I won’t see you out. We will surely meet again.” The woman bowed.

Chen Xuan laughed loudly. “The gang boss is so beautiful. Of course I hope to meet with you again.” With that, he turned and left.

When his figure had completely disappeared, the red clothed woman removed the veil on her face. She sneered. “Just another perverted toad!”

Zu An would surely have been shocked if he’d been there. This was someone he knew! What would have shocked him even more was that her outfit and bearing were entirely different from what he was used to.

...

Back in the Chu Estate, Qiu Honglei’s words had stunned the entire room. “What? Lady Qiu knows where Wang Yuanlong is?” Chu Zhongtian cried out.

Qiu Honglei smiled bashfully. “I do not know for certain, but I received a report that someone who looks similar to young master Wang was led into a certain district by some people.”

Qin Wanru was anxious. “Why didn’t you tell us earlier if you knew where he was?”

“There were too many people around earlier, so I wasn’t sure if the news would get out if I spoke about it outside. Also, I am worried about Chen Xuan taking revenge on me after this matter...” Qiu Honglei seemed genuinely frightened.

Chu Zhongtian gave his wife a look, then said gently to Qiu Honglei, “Lady Qiu does not need to worry. We will definitely send our people to protect you and ensure your safety. However, could you please tell us where he is so that we can send out a rescue party?”

Qin Wanru’s temper flared immediately when she saw her husband give her a look because of another woman. But Wang Yuanlong’s rescue was definitely urgent, so she forced herself to hold back her rage and wait for Qiu Honglei’s reply.

No one expected that Qiu Honglei would shake her head, her lips still tightly sealed.

“What is the meaning of this, Lady Qiu?” Chu Zhongtian said in confusion.

Qiu Honglei hesitated, then said, “I only want to tell Ah Zu.”

All eyes shifted to Zu An, leaving him momentarily stunned. “What difference does this make? Telling me and telling them is the same thing, right? I’ll tell them later anyway.”

Qiu Honglei shook her head. “It’s different.” Her usual charming appearance had been replaced by a surprising resoluteness.

Zu An was dumbfounded. He really couldn’t think of the difference.

Instead, it was Chu Chuyan who picked up on something. “Just why does Lady Qiu treat Ah Zu so differently?”

Qiu Honglei snuck Zu An a look, and then she said shyly, “It’s because I like him.”

Chu Zhongtian was in the middle of drinking some water. Hearing Qiu Honglei’s declaration, he almost sprayed it all out.

Qin Wanru was shocked. Her first reaction was that she heard wrong.

Chu Chuyan’s eyes also went completely round. She clearly didn’t expect to hear such an answer.

Zu An felt like he was being tossed about in a storm. Just what was this woman trying to do?

After her initial shock, Qin Wanru’s face immediately became cold. “Lady Qiu, do you know what you are saying right now?”

Qiu Honglei nodded. “I do. My heart was stolen by his talents, resourcefulness, and character from our first meeting. I immediately fell in love with him.”

Chu Zhongtian rubbed his ears. The perfect lover Qiu Honglei spoke of was Zu An?

Even though he never treated this son-in-law too poorly, he had to be honest with himself. Even though he wasn’t the trash everyone called him, he was hardly the perfect lover!

Qin Wanru’s brows knitted together as she looked at Qiu Honglei. This woman looked pretty and quick-witted out the outside, but there was clearly something wrong with her eyes!

The one who was least surprised was Chu Chuyan. After all, she knew more about Zu An’s affairs than the other two.

But why did this woman go this far? Was she able to tell that he was exceptional too?

Chu Chuyan felt a subconscious discomfort when she realized that this secret—that she thought belonged to her alone—was now known by someone else.

Qiu Honglei continued into the silence. “Despite that, I also understand my own status well, and I know I have no right to compete against the first miss at all. What I seek is only to peacefully remain at Ah Zu’s side. I would gladly serve as a concubine, or even his servant girl. I will be more than delighted to serve him.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The three members of the Chu clan were rendered speechless for a long time.

Qin Wanru found it hard to recover her composure. Were there really any other girls who were this proactive? Just how long has it been since he had entered their household? It was one thing for a woman to come looking for him, but an entirely different thing for that woman to express a desire to become a concubine!

She would have chased her right out if this was an ordinary girl, but Qiu Honglei’s reputation in Brightmoon City was just too great! She was also ridiculously beautiful, and she couldn’t bring herself to deal with this girl like how she normally would other girls.

Why would such a beauty—one that even she couldn’t help but admire—fall for this kid Zu An?

Even Zu An himself was taken aback. The two had shared a pleasant time in the Immortal Abode before, but it never got to a point where they would seriously talk about marriage! Also, hadn’t they just been playing games the last time, with both sides scheming against the other? Why aren’t you playing your cards like a normal person?

Chu Zhongtian coughed lightly. “Lady Qiu, are you saying that you want to... be Zu An’s concubine?”

He obviously wouldn’t take her suggestion of becoming a servant girl seriously. How could anyone dare reduce someone of Qiu Honglei’s status to a mere servant?

But he really just couldn’t wrap his head around what was going on. Countless high-ranking officials and distinguished individuals had been defeated by her charm. All of them had wanted to take her as their wife, yet all of them had been refused without exception. Everyone wondered privately just what kind of man would actually meet her standards.

Many of those who stood in the higher reaches of Brightmoon City even suspected that she wanted to become the head of a household. Perhaps she might invest herself in some young and promising talent.

But in the end, she chose to become the concubine of another family’s son-in-law? What the heck was this?

“Yes.” Qiu Honglei raised her head. Her expression was firm, and she seemed extremely proud of what she had declared.

Qin Wanru couldn’t take this anymore. “Stop joking around already! What kind of person is Lady Qiu? You can find any husband you want! Why would you come all the way here just to become Ah Zu’s concubine?!”

Zu An was floored by her statement. What do you mean by that? Aren’t you making me sound like some piece of trash?

Qiu Honglei smiled. “Indeed, there are many men I could choose from, but I only care about talent and character. Ah Zu was the only man who could move my heart after all these years. From the first time we met, I already knew that he was the one I was destined for.”

Zu An snorted inside. Like hell I’ll believe you! The first time we met, you were already clearly scheming against me!

However, the others still couldn’t get over their shock. They were all locals of Brightmoon City, so they obviously knew just how great Qiu Honglei’s reputation was. They couldn’t figure out what was going on no matter how they racked their brains.

Qiu Honglei continued, “Back then, I also knew that Ah Zu’s status was a sensitive issue. I’ve been slightly more frugal these years, and have saved up some money. If the Master and Madam do not mind, I wish to pay the fee to free myself, in Ah Zu’s place.”

Zu An almost vomited blood on the spot. Just who is paying for whose freedom?!
