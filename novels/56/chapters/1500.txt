Chapter 1449: Decree from the Heavens

Wu Xian explained, “Nuba seemed to have gone mad, trying to force Emperor Jun out. Unfortunately, he never appeared, perhaps because he felt guilty or lacked confidence. Furthermore, because Nuba wasn’t very respectful when she tried to call out Emperor Jun, the Golden Crows were offended. They’re still young and full of vigor, so how could they stand their father being humiliated like that? As such, they went out together to get revenge on Nuba.”

A female shaman previously introduced as Wu Gu added, “Back then, Nuba could even fend off both the Yellow Emperor and Chi You. Even though she was seriously injured from that battle, her cultivation was still extremely terrifying. If she hadn’t encountered both the Golden Crows and the Sun Goddess, and if some other forces had worked with her, she might not have died.”

Zu An had witnessed everything that happened, so he knew that what Wu Gu said was true. After all, Nuba’s greatest ability lay in the heat within her body, that could spread droughts throughout the world. If she had gone up against anyone else, her extreme heat would be a fatal threat. However, she had just happened to encounter the Golden Crows, who were incarnations of the sun. How could one burn a sun?

Instead, Nuba had lost control of the heat energy within her because of the Golden Crows and Sun Goddess’ blistering power, which had caused her to explode.

Sigh, all I can say is that this Nuba was unlucky. She was destined to suffer this disaster.

Zu An suddenly thought of something and asked, “Seniors, isn’t your Spirit Mountain in India… Uh, I mean a place like the Indian Subcontinent?”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He didn’t know what India would be called in this world. If the Spirit Mountain they spoke of was the same as the one in Buddhism, wouldn’t the group be carried to a place that was far, far away? How were they supposed to complete their mission then?

“What India or Indian Subcontinent? We’ve never heard of those places,” the shamans replied in confusion. “Oh, we’re already here at Spirit Mountain.”

They had already arrived at a mountain range as they spoke. Its peaks rose and fell, and a forest covered the surroundings like a blanket. The steep mountain peaks were covered in all sorts of unique flowers and plants, causing a refreshing fragrance to spread through the air.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue exchanged a look. The natural ki here was shockingly rich, far better than the best places in their own sects. This was an extraordinary place for cultivation. It was no wonder that the shamans had been able to cultivate to their level, when they occupied a place like this.

Zu An sighed in relief.

Meanwhile, the shamans introduced Zu An’s group to the area.

“This mountain range is collectively called Spirit Mountain. The reason why we’re called Spirit Mountain’s Ten Shamans is none other than this location.”

“This is Mount Pass, and that one is Mount Vast. There’s also Mount Sole, Mount Orchid Blossom, Mount Sandalwood… Those are all our respective dwellings.”

“All of you are our guests. You’re free to come and go as you wish among these peaks, but you have to keep in mind that there are two forbidden places you can’t go to.”

Zu An asked curiously, “Which two are forbidden areas?”

He felt a bit of an itch inside. The more people spoke that way, the more curious he became.

The shamans pointed at a mountain that was only faintly discernible, as it was surrounded by mist. They explained, “That place is called Mount Treasure Origin. All who enter die without exception.”

Yu Yanluo said, “Since it’s called Mount Treasure Origin, it should be a precious land. Why is it so dangerous?”

Although he felt some hesitation, Wu Xian felt an indescribable closeness to Yu Yanluo and said, “Actually, that mountain’s deity is Bao Jiang.”

“Bao Jiang?” Zu An and the others repeated in surprise. The Bao Jiang who had been plotted against? Then didn’t that mean…

When he saw their expressions, Wu Xian nodded and said, “That’s right. The place where Bao Jiang watched over the immortal medicine in the past was right there.”

When Yun Jianyue heard the words ‘immortal medicine’, her eyes began to shine, almost as if she were eager to give it a try. She was a naturally daring person. Even though these people were strong, a legendary immortal medicine was something that was worth taking a risk for.

Yu Yanluo was a bit embarrassed, saying, “It’s all my fault that you revealed such an important secret.”

“It’s actually not much of a secret anymore. After Gu schemed against Bao Jiang, that information already spread. Many people already know that the immortal medicine is in Mount Treasure Origin. It won’t make too much of a difference if you know too,” Wu Xian said as he fiddled with the twin snakes in his hand. “Let alone the fact that the immortal medicine is no longer there.”

Yun Jianyue immediately looked disappointed when she heard that. She asked, “Then where did it go?”

Wu Xian saw through her intentions, but he didn’t mind. He said, “Following Gu and Bao Jiang’s deaths, the immortal medicine soon disappeared. Now, no one knows where it is.”

“What’s the other forbidden land senior was talking about?” Zu An asked. He didn’t have too much of a longing for an immortal medicine. The first reason was because he had the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, and the second was that he had also been given half of Qiao Xueying’s Elf Race lifespan. In addition, he had personally seen what Yayu ended up becoming after eating the immortal medicine, so he didn’t think it was as wonderful as the legends made it out to be.

The shamans all pointed to the same place. Looking in that direction, Zu An saw a beautiful mountain peak that was shrouded in mist. Apart from that, it had a long and slender rock that rose high into the air. It actually gave off a hint of grace and elegance.

What the hell… Is it because it’s been so long since I’ve touched a woman that I’m now getting this kind of feeling just by looking at a rock?

Zu An’s expression was strange. Soon, however, he felt a bit puzzled. Why did he feel as if the mountain seemed a bit familiar?

The shamans explained, “This is Mount Goddess, a residence created by the Flame Emperor’s third daughter Yao Ji. She’s always preferred peace and doesn’t like to be disturbed by others, so not even we are allowed to willfully approach.”

As soon as they heard that, Yu Yanluo, Yan Xuehen, and Yun Jianyue all looked at Zu An. The Flame Emperor also seemed to be one of the Celestial Emperors; his daughter wasn’t only a princess, but also a fairy of the heavens. Even her name was beautiful. They all thought, This brat wouldn’t be so overwhelmed by lust that he’d set his eyes on this Yao Ji, right?

Even so, Zu An didn’t look as if he had experienced any lustful thoughts. Rather, he seemed surprised. He swallowed and asked,, “What’s the difference between this Spirit Mountain and Shaman Mountain?”

Didn’t the Shaman Mountain near the Yangtze River’s Little Three Gorges have a famous Goddess Peak? No wonder he had felt that the mountain looked a bit familiar.

“Shaman Mountain?” Wu Xian repeated, stunned. Then, he said with a smile, “I reckon that because we shamans live here, there are some who call this mountain Shaman Mountain.”

Zu An thought, As expected. Spirit Mountain’s ‘spirit 靈’ is made up of ‘rain 雨’ on the top, three ‘openings 口’ in the middle, and ‘shaman 巫’ on the very bottom! That was why often, ‘spirit’ and ‘shaman’ were used interchangeably. He had never expected the legendary Spirit Mountain’s Ten Shamans to actually be the ten shamans of Shaman Mountain!

Wu Xian felt that Zu An’s reaction was a bit odd. He was about to say something when a golden light descended from above. All manner of heavenly music filled the air as a vast expanse of divine might descended from above. Those present felt their very souls shivering, subconsciously getting the urge to bow down.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue exchanged looks of shock. They had seen their fair share of powerful individuals, but none of those could compare to the aura they were facing right now. Not even the Fiend Emperor and Zhao Han added together would be a match for this aura!

A dignified voice called out just then, saying, “The ten suns have come out together and brought calamity to the people. I bestow upon you this red bow and white arrows to bring peace to the country.”

…

Meanwhile, in a faraway place, the Fiend Emperor and his son were both stunned. A streak of red light suddenly flew out of the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s chest and disappeared into the horizon.

“My Sun Slaying Bow!” the Golden Crow Crown Prince cried out in alarm.
