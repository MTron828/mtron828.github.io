Chapter 1674: Banners Raised

When he first saw the words in Blackwater Pool, Zu An had been pretty upset due to the feeling of betrayal. Furthermore, when he later discovered that Jiang Zhong had been bribed by someone, he had instinctively associated these two things together and thought that the turtle spirit was in cahoots with King Yan.

However, now that Yun Jianyue had told him that King Yan wasn’t Golden Token Seven’s killer, the turtle spirit working with King Yan was a much more unlikely scenario. Zu An hadn’t been particularly prepared the first time he found it. Furthermore, if not for his incredible perception, no one would even have noticed its existence at the bottom of the lake. That meant the chance of it being deliberately planted to mislead him was extremely low. As such, the answers it had given to keep its life before could be real. After all, there was no reason for it to hide any information.

In that case, then, a woman really had thrown Golden Token Seven’s corpse into the pool, just as the turtle spirit said. However, why would that woman say something so strange? As she was discarding a corpse, why would she hope that someone would find it sooner? Also, just who was that woman?

Zu An suddenly thought of something. Could that woman really be Tang Tian’er?

However, he quickly became confused again. The turtle hadn’t seen that woman’s appearance. The reason he thought of Tang Tian’er was that, according to Jiang Zhong, Golden Token Seven met with her several times. Although Jiang Zhong had already been bought out by King Yan by then… Everything seemed to have circled back to the very start!

Zu An suddenly felt that he was on the edge of realizing something, but he couldn't really put his finger on it.

Yun Jianyue said, “Ah Zu, there has always been something that I’ve wanted to ask you about.”

“What is it?” Zu An asked as he snapped out of his daze and looked at Yun Jianyue beside him.

Yun Jianyue hesitated for a bit, seemingly considering how to word what she was about to say. She then said, “Ever since I met you, you never seemed to be all that loyal to your ruler. I even feel as if you already treat Zhao Han as a potential enemy. In that case, why are you still helping Zhao Han? Whether it’s our Holy Sect or King Yan, both of us want to bring down the emperor. The enemy of your enemy is your friend, so why did you make things hard for King Yan and lose those potential helpers?” She paused for a moment, her expression becoming a bit conflicted before she continued, “Also, you led these troops here to Violet Mountain to help Zhao Han get rid of hidden dangers. I feel that everything you’re doing is completely meaningless.”

Zu An said with a serious expression, “Big sis Yun, that’s where you’re wrong. Even though King Yan had thoughts of rebelling, he wouldn’t dare to go against Zhao Han even if he had ten gallbladders. If I’m not mistaken, everything he’s been doing has been in preparation for when Zhao Han dies, to go against the crown prince. So, there’s no chance that he would work with me against Zhao Han. As such, he naturally can't become my comrade.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“But you, big sis Yun, are different. You’re someone who really dares to go against Zhao Han publicly, and you even dared to invade the Imperial Palace. That’s why I really admire you and our relationship is really good.”

When she heard him mention the past, Yun Jianyue remembered the time she had spent hiding in the Imperial Palace. A hint of a warm smile appeared on her face.

“As for all of the things I’m doing right now, it’s all just about accumulating opportunities,” Zu An continued.

“Accumulating opportunities?” Yun Jianyue repeated, stunned. She was a bit confused. People usually looked for opportunities. What was ‘accumulating opportunities’?

Zu An didn’t explain the phrase, just changing the subject to ordinary matters. He said, “Right, big sis Yun, I heard that your competition with the White Jade Sect would be happening in a few days. Why haven’t you made an appearance yet?”

Yun Jianyue had an ambiguous smile as she asked, “What, are you scouting for that little female friend of yours?”

Zu An’s face heated up. He replied, “I’m just as worried for Honglei! Honestly, I don’t even want either side to fight. It’s going to suck no matter who loses. Both sides are equally important.”

“Equally important?” Yun Jianyue repeated, laughing out of irritation. “You really are quite something! You actually managed to make something so shameless seem righteous!”

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +66 +66 +66…

Zu An complained, “Then what else am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to support one side in beating the other?”

“You’re in front of me, and yet you’re not saying anything biased in favor of Honglei? You’re probably like this in front of that stone cold woman too, so I guess you have a bit of a conscience,” Yun Jianyue said, her mood improving a bit. “But the time you spent with that stone cold woman’s disciple and Jadefall Palace’s big-boobed woman really left Honglei feeling wronged.”

It took some time for Zu An to realize that she was talking about Pei Mianman. This woman really loved her nicknames. He reacted quickly and said, “Come on, I didn’t know your identity before! But I still felt a mysterious sense of familiarity, and didn’t I help you guys out several times?”

“That’s more like it. And I thought your tastes had changed,” Yun Jianyue said with a smile, leaving Zu An speechless.

After messing with him for a while longer, Yun Jianyue said with a serious expression, “I have my own plans against the White Jade Sect. But since your relationship with the other side is really good, telling you will only put you in a difficult position. I planned to just come up with some excuse to trick you, but I don’t want to do that anymore. I just won’t tell you. I hope you can understand.”

Zu An was stunned. Then, he looked at Yun Jianyue, a smile appearing on his lips.

“What are you looking at? Are you upset?” Yun Jianyue asked, surprised.

“Not at all. I just feel that you have a free and carefree kind of beauty,” Zu An said. He couldn't help but sigh in admiration. Those two really had entirely opposite personalities… No wonder they had become enemies.

“I don’t want to hear that bootlicking. That stuff doesn’t work on me,” Yun Jianyue replied. Despite that, the smile between her brows still sold out her true thoughts.

…

The two chatted for a while, and quickly arrived near Yi Commandery. Yun Jianyue couldn't show her real identity in public, so she descended first.

Zu An changed into his Embroidered Envoy clothes, then hurried to Yi City. He could see banners flying all over the place even from far away, with armies spreading across the field. It felt as if a black cloud had surrounded the city.

Meanwhile, Yi City’s gates were tightly shut, with soldiers stationed on the walls. With Zhang Jie in the lead, Yi Commandery’s officials all had nervous expressions. They knew that if they really fought, there was no way some city defense guards could win against the other side’s seasoned field army.

King Yan Manor’s strength in the city wasn’t small either. If they coordinated between inside and outside, how could Yi City possibly be defended?

As such, Zhang Jie nervously called out for the other side to calm down, saying that there were a ton of misunderstandings.

Unfortunately, it wasn’t of any use. In King Yan’s army, King Yan’s heir Zhao Huang rode atop a large and tall horse. Just then, he waved his hand, and war drums resounded among his troops. His army immediately surged with killing intent and began to march slowly toward Yi City. Their footsteps, for the people on the city walls, seemed to demand their very lives.

…

Xiao Jianren, Zhang Zitong, and the Embroidered Envoys also arrived at the city gate tower. Because of their status, they had a duty to defend the territory.

When they saw the enemy’s black expanse of an army encroaching, their hearts beat nervously. Normally, they only had to face a small number of enemies; when had they ever seen a battlefield of this scale? In such a situation, individual strength was practically negligible. If they really fought, every breath could end up being their last. They also felt a bit of despair. Where is Sir Eleven? Why hasn’t he appeared yet?

Still, they knew that Sir Eleven wouldn’t be able to do much to change the situation even if he came.

Meanwhile, Zu An was observing King Yan’s army. Even after being in this world for so long, this was the first time he had seen such a battlefield.

The Chu clan’s private army in Brightmoon City and the Armed Escort Division that was accompanying him on the current mission technically hadn’t fought on a real battlefield.

King Yan’s army was one that had fought against the Fiend races and rebel armies for a long time. They all carried an almost-tangible killing intent that could make many cultivators shiver in fear, unable to bring out their true strength. Their strict formation, their superior armor… Those details showed that they were even higher in quality than the Chu clan’s private army.

Zu An noticed many cannon-like objects in the army, engraved all over with runes. They were clearly a combination of cultivation techniques with gunpowder technology. Meanwhile, Yi City’s walls flickered with blue light; they were clearly activating their defensive formations. However, it was hard to say how long its soldiers, who had low morale, could hold on for.

Zu An couldn't wait any longer. If they really started fighting, it would become too late to stop them. War was cruel. Regardless of how it ended, the ones who suffered would be the lowest-level soldiers and the common people.

“Halt!” he called out as he flew right over King Yan’s army. With his cultivation, his shout was enough to reach every corner of the battlefield. King Yan’s army quickly noticed him. A group of soldiers immediately pointed their arrows at him.

Zu An’s eye twitched when he saw the black glint of the bows and the glimmering runes on the arrowheads. If he really ended up being targeted by a hail of arrows, he would have no choice but to avoid them even with his current ability.

Xiao Jianren and Zhang Zitong said excitedly, “It’s Sir Eleven! Sir Eleven came!”

After going through all they had, they now had a mysterious sense of trust in Golden Token Eleven, as if they had found their pillar of confidence as soon as he appeared.

King Yan’s heir Zhao Huang waved his hand, temporarily stopping his subordinates from firing. He clearly recognized who it was. He called out, “Sir Eleven, you actually dare to appear in front of me? This really is quite unexpected.”

Many people next to him voiced their anger and shouted, “Young master, it was precisely this person who conspired against King Yan!”

Zu An remained calm as he replied, “Young master, Sir Sun, do you know what your actions today are called? Rebellion is punishable by nine generations of execution.”

Zhang Jie and the others wiped away cold sweat when they heard that. This Golden Token Eleven really is fierce… He’s actually provoking the other side even in such a critical moment?

Sure enough, Zhao Huang’s face twitched. He said,“I don’t know what kind of end we’ll come to, but I know that none of you will come to a good end.”

You have successfully trolled Zhao Huang for +444 +444 +444…

Sun Xun, who had remained silent the entire time, spoke up. “We are only doing this to bring justice for King Yan and save him. If Sir Eleven could convince Zhang Jie to release King Yan, that would be better for everyone.”

These two were clearly playing the carrot and stick game.

Zu An shook his head and said, “If we agreed to your conditions just because you brought your troops, everyone else would follow your example. Wouldn’t the entire world be in trouble then?”

Zhang Jie and the others’ expressions changed. Even if what you’re saying is true, is this the time for it? What face do they have left if you refuse them so ruthlessly?

Sure enough, Zhao Huang erupted into a rage. “Since you're the main culprit behind all this, I'll just have to take you down!”

You have successfully trolled Zhao Huang for +666 +666 +666…

With a wave of his hand, the countless arrows aimed at Zu An were released. They were full of blue light and covered every possible angle of escape.
