Chapter 1721: Reunion

Murong Qinghe blinked, her expression blank.

Big brother Zu really is amazing; he has so many beauties at his side! Also, they’re each more beautiful than the next!

Alright, I can’t let big brother Chu hang around him too much, or else he’ll imitate this playboy behavior!

The Qin clan brothers were quite unhappy. Their brother-in-law was living with another woman! Even though he had already divorced their little sister, they still felt as if it were a slap to their faces somehow.

Mi Li sighed, remarking, “Kid, you really are a master at picking up women! This little lady is clearly a virgin, and yet she’s willing to sacrifice her own reputation to save you. Just what did you feed her?”

“Can you quit it with the sarcastic remarks?” Zu An snapped, too annoyed to respond properly. He was both moved and worried for Xie Daoyun.

…

After the initial shock, those in Guidance Palace gradually snapped out of their daze.

Pei Zheng said, “Even if you were in the same room as him, there is no way you could have been together every waking second. He is the Fiend races’ Regent and has a great deal of ability. You would never have known it even if he secretly did some things.”

“Exactly! Miss Xie, please don’t be deceived by this guy.”

“Colluding with the Fiend races is a crime that can get your entire clan executed! Furthermore, this involves an assassination attempt on his majesty, so please reconsider, Miss Xie!”

The officials all began to speak, one after another. Xie Daoyun’s face paled. She wasn’t only responsible for herself; she had her parents and brother to worry about, as well as the entire Xie clan.

Zu An walked over and patted her shoulder, saying, “Miss Xie, there’s no need for you to speak like this for my sake.” He couldn't call her by her nickname in front of everyone, so he deliberately spoke up to take the responsibility away from her.

Xie Daoyun shook her head. Despite usually being quiet and gentle, she insisted stubbornly, “Big brother Zu, I know you’re being wrongly accused here, so of course I need to speak up for you!”

Mi Li had just been watching the whole scene with amusement, but now, she couldn't help but frown. Being fed such a public display of affection really didn’t taste that good…

King Liang harrumphed and said, “Whether or not you were wronged, we can just slowly figure it out later. This matter today is extremely important, so we cannot let him move as he pleases. Restrain him first; otherwise, who knows what could happen.”

Even though King Liang was actually looked down on a bit in terms of both ability and character, his status was pretty high among the gathered officials. Now that he had spoken up, the others all voiced their agreement.

Quite a few people looked around. Only then did they realize that King Qi had also disappeared at some point. The expressions of Bi Qi, Pei Zheng, and some others changed a bit. They could roughly guess what was happening. However, the matter was extremely important, so no one dared to say anything. They could only detain Zu An first for the time being.

With King Liang taking the lead, the others all rushed at Zu An. Pei Zheng had the most authority among those gathered, so he didn’t personally interfere. However, his subordinates didn’t hold back.

Those officials who could follow the emperor in his procession all had high ranks and decent cultivation. If they all surrounded someone, their victim would have a hard time even with three heads and six arms.

The moment Zu An was about to be captured, a horrifying roar erupted, causing all of Guidance Palace to tremble. If not for a special formation, it would likely have collapsed then and there.

As for the officials who had begun to charge, their faces turned deathly pale and they clutched their ears in pain. Those with weaker cultivations even began to bleed from their ears and noses.

“Is that the Fiend races’ Lion’s Roar Skill?” Pei Zheng and some others exclaimed, their expression changing. Even they felt awful after hearing the sound. Zu An’s cultivation was much higher than they imagined!

Another person cried, “You’re still saying you aren’t colluding with the Fiend races? You even learned a king race’s secret skill!”

Zu An had no other choice, however. So many people had attacked him, but he didn’t want to create any blood feuds. In the end, only the Lion’s Roar skill qualified as a suitable area of effect skill.

Those with lower cultivations collapsed, as expected. Guidance Palace quickly became much less active.

Even the bigwigs couldn't just still still anymore. They were about to act when Xie Daoyun suddenly tossed out a talisman. Then, a formation flickered around Zu An’s feet. She quickly called out, “Big brother Zu, you should hurry and run!”

Zu An was stunned, asking, “What about you?”

“Don’t worry, I won’t be in danger because of my identity,” Xie Daoyun said. She was an important disciple of Master Yan, making her extremely special. Furthermore, Zu An’s crime was still unproven, so she had room to plead innocent too.

Zu An frowned. He grabbed her hand and jumped into the formation. Blue light flickered, and both of them quickly disappeared. At the same time, the formation also gradually scattered. The officials were all left with ugly expressions. They had let Zu An get away even with so many people present!

Pei Zheng and his subordinates quickly surrounded the place where the two had just been. He said coldly, “This place is locked down by the Righteous Sun Sect’s mountain defense formation, so this transport formation can’t have taken them that far. Everyone, hurry and look for them. You have to catch that wicked bastard!”

Many people rushed out to carry out his order. However, Meng Yi, Bi Qi, and some others exchanged a look. They didn’t chase after Zu An. At present, they were more worried about the situation on Golden Peak. The only thing that was worth being thankful for was that the emperor was the most powerful man in the world. Even in the event of some sinister plot, he would likely be able to survive it just fine.

…

Meanwhile, in a secluded area of the forest several hundred meters away from Guidance Palace, blue runes slowly materialized, followed by two figures. They were none other than Zu An and Xie Daoyun. Their first reaction was to look all around them. When they saw that no one was paying attention to the area, they sighed in relief.

Only then did they realize that their hands were tightly held together. Xie Daoyun pulled her hand back as if she had been zapped by electricity. She said with a red face, “Big brother Zu, you actually could have left me alone. They wouldn’t have done anything to me…”

Zu An shook his head and replied, “You saved me, so how could I leave you and run away alone?”

Suddenly, someone remarked with a sneer, “Tsk tsk tsk, what a sappy pair of lovebirds we have here. Did I perhaps come at a bad time?”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Xie Daoyun jumped in fright. She quickly turned around and saw two beauties walking over. One had long hair that stretched all the way down her back, while the other one was cute and seductive. They were none other than Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei, who had just caused a huge disturbance on Golden Peak not too long ago. When she remembered their identities, especially that of the infamous demoness Yun Jianyue, Xie Daoyun’s face paled.

Zu An exclaimed in happiness and surprise, “You two didn’t leave?!”

Qiu Honglei sighed deeply and said, “We asked you for help earlier, and yet you never came back after all this time, so how could we leave? We were waiting for news from you, and yet it turns out you were flirting with some other woman.”

Xie Daoyun said in annoyance, “Miss Qiu, for better or for worse, we’re fellow townsfolk from Brightmoon City. Do you really have to pretend to not know me?”

Qiu Honglei suddenly put on an ‘aha!’ expression and replied, “Oh my, so it was Miss Xie! I’m so sorry. I must have been so worked up that I ended up saying some unpleasant things.”

Xie Daoyun was speechless.

Mi Li mused, “Haha, interesting. Watching these women fight is pretty amusing. Brat, do you think a harem is so easily enjoyed?”

Zu An was stunned. He asked, “Master empress, can you offer me any good tips? What should I do in this kind of situation?”

“Maybe you should just ignore it,” Mi Li replied, seemingly having a great time. “Oh, and another one is coming.”

Zu An was startled. He looked in a certain direction and saw a white figure slowly floating over.

“Stone cold woman, you really are like a haunting spirit… Why are you always there wherever I go?” Yun Jianyue remarked in annoyance. Why was this woman always at Ah Zu’s side?

Yan Xuehen gave her an indifferent look and said, “My disciple hasn’t come out from the secret dungeon all this time. I only came here out of worry for her. What does that have to do with you?”

Yun Jianyue put an arm around Qiu Honglei proudly and said, “Sorry, my good disciple is right here.”

Yan Xuehen was stunned. She snapped, “Witch, I’m not in the mood to argue with you today.”

“But I’m all ready to go!” Yun Jianyue replied.

…

Mi Li couldn't help but laugh when she saw the two bicker. She said, “The sixth sense of a woman really is just too accurate. Even though they don’t know about each other’s relationship with you, they subconsciously dislike each other.” She sighed and added, “I’ve really enjoyed myself this time! I was about to go crazy from sleeping all the time. It seems I might have something fun to watch every day in the future.”

Zu An had a weird expression. This woman knew everything about him, as expected! She had clearly been sleeping, and yet she even knew about all of those things.

He coughed lightly and said, “We don’t have time to fight right now. I want to take a look around Golden Peak. Do either of you have a way for us to get there?”
