Chapter 1697: Predestined Showdown

Even when she saw so many powerful cultivators from different sects surrounding her and her disciple, Yun Jianyue didn’t feel any fear. She said, “Wow, look at all of you. Since even your so-called orthodox faction doesn’t want to play by the rules, if something unexpected happens to my disciple, don’t blame me for bringing chaos to your families.

“Whether it’s your wives, children, aging parents, or even your beloved disciples, if even a single one of them survives, my name isn’t Yun Jianyue!”

As the Devil Sect Master, her words naturally carried great intimidation. The others’ expressions changed when they heard her threat. They knew that Yun Jianyue’s word was as good as gold in the current scenario. If they couldn't kill her and let her escape, there would definitely definitely be absolute chaos back home. Who could stop a grandmaster if they were determined to kill all of your loved ones? Let alone the fact that this was the Devil Sect Master! The power at her disposal was unimaginable.

The only solution was to end her today on Golden Peak. Without their leader, the Devil Sect’s various factions would start to fight against each other for the position of sect master, so they wouldn’t have to worry about revenge anymore. Still, killing Yun Jianyue wasn’t so easily done!

Nevertheless, if the daoist sects gave up just because of a few threatening words despite gathering so many powerful cultivators, they really wouldn’t have any face left. How were they supposed to retain a footing in the world of warriors then?

They were stuck in a tough spot, but suddenly, Master Jian Huang said, “Amitabha buddha. Conflict in the world of warriors is best dealt with using some reason. Why must we fight to the point where even our families are put at risk?” As someone from the Buddhist sects and a figure with prestigious standing, he did have the right to smooth things over.

Yun Jianyue said with a sneer, “An old vegetarian monk like you doesn’t have any family, so what are you scared of? Don’t tell me the fat little monk at your side is your illegitimate child?”

The little monk Jie Se immediately felt a bit of resentment. You can call me ‘little monk’, but did you have to add the word ‘fat’? It’s not as if I ate your family’s rice…

“Amitabha buddha. Tranquility Temple has always attached great importance to our rules. Who would believe the unfounded ravings of Sect Master Yun?” Master Jian Huang said calmly, clearly not all that affected by her words.

“Whatever, I don’t feel like arguing with you. You don’t want to fight, and yet you aren’t letting me go either. What do you even want then?” Yun Jianyue asked, sweeping her gaze over those present with a swing of her sleeve. They all looked away, unwilling to look straight at her.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An was full of admiration. He had already gotten used to Yun Jianyue’s kind side. It wasn’t that often that he got to see her Devil Sect Master side. Now, she had seized absolute initiative from a position of total disadvantage. Such a presence really was impressive. Still, it really was hard for him to make the connection between her domineering side and the charming and pleading woman from the previous night.

Master Jian Huang said, “This old one suggests a gentleman’s agreement. How about both sides have a competition? If the daoist sects win, Sect Master Yun’s disciple will remain as a guest and cultivate in Violet Mountain. If the daoist sects lose, we will let Sect Master Yun leave. That would be quite fair; what does everyone think?”

Yun Jianyue roared with laughter and replied, “Why not? Who wants to fight a round against me? If I lose, I’ll accept whatever happens!”

The others had strange expressions. Wasn’t this woman too confident in herself? Even though she was formidable, this was Golden Peak. There were several individuals on the same level as her. Did she really have faith that she wouldn’t lose? Wang Wuxie, in particular, had remained number one among the daoist sects for so many years already. In theory, he was supposed to be a bit stronger than her.

Only Yan Xuehen knew that they had experienced many miraculous encounters with Zu An in the secret dungeon, to the extent that they had even sensed the auras of true immortals. Her strength had already reached new breakthroughs. These people might be in for some pain if they were evaluating her through the information they had before.

Guan Chouhai said, “No, we’re in a position of absolute advantage. We finally managed to surround this witch. If we go one on one, we’ll be letting her off easy.”

At the same time, he secretly cursed Master Jian Huang. Did that old monk go senile? Wang Wuxie is clearly injured and controlled by Shaman Arts. His strength is nowhere near his peak. How are we supposed to win against her?

Master Jian Huang frowned when he heard that. This Guan Chouhai really is muddle-headed. With such an important mission to take care of, it’ll only be disadvantageous to us if we keep her here. We’re better off finding some random excuse to send her away. Don’t tell me you actually want to lose our forces just to keep Yun Jianyue here?

Yun Jianyue looked at Guan Chouhai and sneered. She retorted, “Mister Guan, how about we fight a round first? I’ll give you this round for free. Even if I win, we won’t count it.”

Guan Chouhai’s expression changed. He yelled, “You witch! Do you think I’m scared of you?!” At the same time, he was alarmed. Why did he get the feeling that she was absolutely certain of her victory? Furthermore, he could tell that it definitely wasn’t some false bravado.

Li Changsheng stepped forward to smooth things over. He said, “Brother Guan, please do not act recklessly. How about we do a two out of three? That way, our daoist sects’ advantage would not be wasted.”

Yun Jianyue said angrily, “I only have me and my disciple, so where would we find a third?”

Zu An was a suitable candidate, and there would definitely be no issues with winning a round. However, she didn’t want to involve him in this trouble.

Emptiness Isle’s Elder Peng sneered and said, “I’m sure you can win two rounds yourself, no? You can use your disciple to buy you some time in the middle, and that should be enough time for you to recover. Of course, since you’re so confident, you can also fight all three rounds alone.”

“Your thoughts are as disgusting as expected,” Yun Jianyue said, shooting her a cold look.

Even though she had confidence, that didn’t mean she had gone crazy. Her cultivation had made a huge breakthrough before, but there were so many talents here in the daoist sects. Fighting three rounds was still too difficult.

Elder Peng almost went crazy from anger. She was about to fire off a round of verbal abuse, but Yun Jianyue considered it disdainful to even bicker with her further.

“We’ll either decide everything through a single round, or just fight to the end. Wang Wuxie, aren’t you the number one among the daoist sects? Why haven’t you said a thing all this time? Don’t tell me you’re too scared to fight against me?” Yun Jianyue called out, directly issuing Wang Wuxie a challenge.

Yan Xuehen gave Wang Wuxie a strange look. He really was a bit too quiet today. Normally, he would have long since stated his opinion.

…

Golden Peak immediately erupted with noise. Many people even felt admiration for Yun Jianyue. Even though she was a woman, her powerful presence wasn’t inferior to any man’s. Wang Wuxie was the daoist sects’ publicly acknowledged number one. As she had taken the initiative to challenge him, that meant her confidence was definitely real.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Suddenly, Wang Wuxie said, “His majesty is about to come to Violet Mountain to carry out the ceremony. I need to assist him, so it is not convenient for me to act here. I hope that Sect Master Yun can forgive me.”

His excuse was reasonable, so no one suspected anything. Instead, they began to wonder what sort of important matter the emperor and Wang Wuxie had to work together to complete.

Suddenly, a cold and clear voice called out, “Lady Qiu and I just happen to have a decisive battle arranged. Why don’t the two of us fight a round to decide whether she stays or leaves?”

Long hair fluttered around an icy blue dress. It was as if a woman of snow had come down from the Great Snowy Mountains.

Lou Wucheng and Zhi Yin both exclaimed in excitement, “Fairy Chu!”

Zu An’s heartbeat also quickened. Who else could it be but Chu Chuyan?

It had seemed that their fight was nothing more than a pretense for Yun Jianyue’s real plans before, so he had thought that the decisive battle could just be avoided. He hadn’t expected this kind of situation to happen, as if the battle had been decided by fate itself!
