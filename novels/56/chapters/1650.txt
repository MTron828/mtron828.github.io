Chapter 1599 – Past Stories

Even though the woman was masked and dressed entirely in black, her wonderful figure still gave her away. Her long legs in particular were especially eye-catching beneath her tight black outfit.

What is Zhang Zitong doing all the way over here? Zu An thought in confusion.

Recognizing a woman by her legs wasn’t all that amazing of a skill. In his previous world, there were some gentlemen who could recognize a woman by her chest. There were even some who could recognize a woman from her cries. Now that was really, really impressive.

When she saw him standing there in a daze, Zhang Zitong reflexively loosened her grip on the blade a bit. She said, “As long as you cooperate, there won’t be any danger to your life. Otherwise, don’t blame me for being vicious.”

Zu An could recognize her, but she had no idea that he was Golden Token Eleven. Thus, he replied with a smile, “Alright. But could you stop pushing it any further? It’s about to go in.”

Zhang Zitong’s face turned red and she reflexively pulled the blade backward. This guy seems to be teasing me…

But his smile is so handsome…

If people such as Xiao Jianren, Dai Seventh, or Chen Eighth had said such things to her, she would already have gotten angry. But it was really hard for her to get mad at this person.

Suddenly, there was a clamor in the distance. A group of guards rushed in their direction. However, Zu An pushed Zhang Zitong down slightly, making her squat.

As an Embroidered Envoy, what kinds of people hadn’t Zhang Zitong seen before? Her current stance quickly made her furious, because she thought he was taking advantage of her.

“Who are you?” an elderly voice called out.

Only then did Zhang Zitong realize that Zu An was using his body to cover her. What kind of nonsense was I thinking? Then, she became very nervous, to the point that she didn’t even dare to breathe again.

Zu An turned around and saw a gray-haired elder standing nearby, looking at him vigilantly. The elder was very skinny, almost like a skeleton, with a somewhat sinister appearance. His aura was a bit weak, as if he had one foot already in the grave.

However, the elder’s eyes were bright and sharp. Upon closer inspection, it was as if there were two whirlpools spinning within them. If one stared into them for too long, it would feel as if one could sink into them at any moment. There was also a pattern between his brows, shaped like a vertical eye. Even though the eye was closed right now, it gave off a dangerous air.

Zu An thought in surprise, Could this be Sir Huo? He calmly replied, “I’m a guest King Yan invited. Not too long ago, I made a bet to see who could help King Yan capture the assassin first. That’s why I’m investigating here.”

“Guest?” the elder replied with a hint of surprise. A guard came up to him and whispered into his ear, clearly attesting to Zu An’s status. The elder nodded and continued, “Then can I ask if sir has discovered anything? That assassin was running precisely in this direction.”

“Is that so?” Zu An replied, pretending to be quite troubled. “Then it looks as if my luck isn’t that good, or else I would have already won the bet.”

The elder gave him a closer look. At the same time, he sent out his ki to check the room. When he didn’t notice anyone else, he nodded and said, “Our guest should return to the banquet as quickly as possible. That assassin is really dangerous.”

Then, he took the others with him and they continued their search.

…

When they left, Zu An looked down at the squatting Zhang Zitong, saying, “Alright, they’ve already left.”

“They left?” Zhang Zitong asked in surprise. She hadn’t expected to get through this situation so easily. She continued, “That old man is really treacherous. He might have just pretended to leave before circling back.”

Zu An shook his head and said, “He really didn’t notice you. You can get up, unless you like this kind of squatting posture?” He knew that with his aura covering Zhang Zitong, there was no way the elder would have noticed her unless he came very close.

Zhang Zitong’s face turned red. She quickly jumped up and hissed, “Who likes squatting here like this?!” Then, she asked in confusion, “Why did you help me?”

After all, she wasn’t stupid. She quickly realized that he was the one who had taken the initiative to help her, and that it wasn’t because she had threatened him.

Zu An didn’t want to explain everything to her; instead, he simply said, “It’s just because you’re pretty, and your legs are long too. I’ve always been someone who's fond of beauty.”

Zhang Zitong’s expression quickly distorted. If anyone else had said such a thing to her, she would only have thought of them as an annoying pervert, but this person had just said it so naturally. She felt a mysterious sense of sincerity from him. She cupped her hands and asked politely, “May I ask what the young master’s surname is? I will definitely return this life-saving grace in the future”

“My surname is My, given name Husband. Make sure to remember it,” Zu An casually replied.

“My Husband?” Zhang Zitong repeated, stunned. This man was so handsome, but wasn’t his name a bit poorly chosen? She replied, “Thank you, My Husband. We will meet again.” Then, she kicked off the ground and disappeared into the night sky.

Zu An didn’t see her off, because she was a Silver Token Envoy. If she got caught even after the amount of help he gave her, she would be way too weak.

…

Meanwhile, Zhang Zitong sighed in relief after she successfully escaped from King Yan Manor. She turned around and looked at the glistening king manor. That man’s handsome smile appeared in her mind. She thought, Just where did My Husband come from? He was actually able to arrive as a guest of King Yan’s, and he even helped me…

Anyone who can be invited to King Yan’s banquet can’t possibly be a nobody. Once I get back, I’m going to look around. I should be able to find out more about him.

My Husband really is a special name. Wait, what?

She repeated the name a few times to herself before she finally realized what was going on. Her face quickly turned completely red.

Meanwhile, back at the King Manor, when Zu An received the Rage points, he couldn't help but chuckle. This woman didn’t seem to be all that sharp… It had taken her so long to react, after all. Then again, if she really had been smart, she wouldn’t have done something as foolish as barging into King Yan Manor to find clues about Sir Huo.

“Did you encounter something happy? Why do you have such a big smile on your face?” a clear and cold voice called out from behind Zu An. Chu Chuyan was standing under the plum blossoms, her dress fluttering in the wind. She really was graceful and charming.

Even though they were already married, whenever he saw her, Zu An still felt a brief moment of shock. His smile grew even bigger as he said, “Of course I’m happy, because I got to see you guys here!”

“You guys?” Chu Chuyan repeated with a suspicious expression.

Zu An was startled. He quickly replied, “I fought side by side with Sect Master Yan at the Fiend King Court, so for better or for worse, we’re friends now. Of course I’m happy to see her.”

Chu Chuyan felt relieved when she heard that. However, she then said worriedly, “Ah Zu, I know what kind of person you are. Please don’t have any improper thoughts toward master. Master has never felt anything for any man in all these years. If she finds out, she’ll definitely show you her sword and make sure you won’t be able to think any bad thoughts in your next life.”

Zu An had a strange expression as he thought to himself, Your master did show me a sword, but I showed her a spear… Eventually, he replied, “I don’t think Sect Master Yan would be so unreasonable. For example, that Heavenly Sorrow’s Guan Chouhai seems to be particularly attentive to her, and yet I don’t see her getting that annoyed.”

“You still have the nerve to say that? You’ve already offended Heavenly Sorrow so badly that I’m worried for your life! I was worried that Sect Master Guan would suddenly attack you and was about to ask master to help you.” Chu Chuyan said, still feeling some fear when she remembered what had happened.

“Don’t worry. I’m not scared of that Guan guy,” Zu An said, grabbing her soft and cool hand. “Furthermore, your master and I are at least comrades in battle, so she won’t just sit around without doing anything.”

“So that was what you were thinking! I shouldn’t have been worried for you,” Chu Chuyan said, pouting playfully. If there were anyone else present, their jaws would no doubt have dropped. She was normally cold no matter who she faced, and yet she actually had such a cute side!

“You still haven’t talked about Guan Chouhai and your master’s involvement,” Zu An said with great interest.

“What else could there be? It’s nothing more than Sect Master Guan always chasing after my master,” Chu Chuyan said, starting to feel excited as the subject moved toward gossip. “Back then, Sect Master Guan had incredible talent. He was secretly chosen to become Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s next Sect Master when he was only in his teenage years. There was even a chance for him to be the strongest among the nine daoist sects. Because he was rather handsome and scholarly in appearance, it wasn’t just the Heavenly Sorrow Sect; countless young ladies from the other sects were infatuated with him. There were even rumors of him refusing women who were practically throwing themselves at him.

“However, Sect Master Guan met my master in the Daoist Sect Great Meeting and fell in love at first sight. He vowed he wouldn’t take anyone but her as a wife. He visited the White Jade Sect countless times, and he even became a servant in the White Jade Sect for a while to please master. He tried to get along with everyone at master’s side. Back then, some people even joked that Heavenly Sorrow was helping the White Jade Sect raise a good disciple.”

“And then?” Zu An asked somewhat nervously. With that degree of infatuation and him being quite attractive to begin with, not many women could resist, right?

“There’s nothing after that.” Chu Chuyan said, shaking her head. “Master doesn’t like him. At first, she patiently told him that she didn’t like him, but when he didn’t listen and instead pestered her even more, master decided to just ignore him. I actually suspect that the reason why master behaves so coldly toward men might be because of that.”

Zu An was stunned, thinking, That might actually be a possibility.

Suddenly, someone coughed lightly. The two of them turned around and saw Yan Xuehen with a menacing expression.
