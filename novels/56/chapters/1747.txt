Chapter 1696: Imminent Battle

Tranquility Temple’s little monk Jie Se widened his eyes and exclaimed, “Oh my goodness, what a great living transformation!”

Master Jian Huang couldn't help but shoot him a glare. He replied, “Weren’t they living people before too?”

“Master always calls women rouge, powder, and skeleton. We only saw the skeleton before, but only now is there rouge and powder!” Jie Se said with a sigh of admiration.

Master Jian Huang smacked Jie Se’s round head and snapped, “Women really are the only thing filling that head of yours all day.”

Jie Se felt wronged and replied, “I’m still young, so isn’t it normal for me to be young and vigorous? I don’t want to be like master, who's so old that you don’t even have any reaction anymore.”

Master Jian Huang’s expression immediately became dangerous. He said, “Copy the Heart Sutra two hundred times tonight. You’re not allowed to sleep until you finish it.”

Jie Se immediately cried out in alarm. “Master, you’re only doing this out of pettiness…”

“Three hundred times,” Master Jian Huang said, his expression frightening.

Jie Se had an expression of loss on his face, but in the end, he really didn’t dare to challenge his master any further.

…

Meanwhile, on the Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s side, all of the disciples were stupefied. Cai Yu muttered to himself, “I didn’t expect that witch to have such looks…”

Yun Jianyue was also incredibly beautiful, but she still had her identity as the Devil Sect Master, so Cai Yu subconsciously treated her as someone from the last generation and didn’t dare to have any bad thoughts. However, it was different for Qiu Honglei. She was young and pretty, and had an especially dainty and weak appearance that made others cherish her. She looked like a gentle, kind, and distinguished daughter! There wasn’t a trace of a Devil Sect witch in sight!

Zhi Yin’s breathing quickened. He had been completely infatuated with Chu Chuyan before, yet today, he finally saw someone whose beauty was comparable to hers.

Previously, even though Pei Mianman was pretty, he had lost to her and thus developed a bit of a mental shadow. As such, he found her a bit less attractive. However, Qiu Honglei was different. She made him unable to help but feel a sense of protectiveness. He even began to wonder if there was some sort of misunderstanding. How could this woman be a witch? Even though he didn’t know the whole story, he knew that she had definitely been wronged somewhere just from looking at her appearance.

Zhao Xiaodie was a bit absent-minded. Before joining this Great Daoist Competition, she had absolute confidence in her appearance. She was a goddess with countless pursuers in the Heavenly Sorrow Sect. And yet, after coming to Violet Mountain, she had encountered Chu Chuyan, Pei Mianman, and now Qiu Honglei, who were all exceptional beauties. She suddenly felt a bit overshadowed. That wasn’t even factoring in the two seniors, Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue. She had never felt so inferior before.

The disciples of the other sects were more or less the same too. Even Wu Xiaofan couldn't help but give her a few extra glances. They had never expected to be defeated at the hands of such a delicate and pretty woman.

Only Supreme Mystery Cave’s Shi Dingtian had a rather normal expression. For him, her appearance wasn’t even as interesting as his dog's.

…

Li Changsheng coughed and said, “Outstanding. I didn’t expect the Devil Sect’s Saintess to have already cultivated the charm arts to such a superb level. Yun Jianyue, you’ve really found a worthy successor.”

When they heard his cough, the disciples felt as if thunder had resounded in their ears. All of them trembled and quickly snapped out of their daze. When they recalled the thoughts they had, they all felt incredibly ashamed. At the same time, they consoled themselves by thinking that this woman was just so cunning that they had fallen for her charm arts, and that it wasn’t because they were excessively perverted.

Only Xie Daoyun had a worried expression as she looked at Zu An. She naturally recognized Qiu Honglei. The other woman had made all of the men in Brightmoon City go crazy for her, after all.

However, Xie Daoyun had also heard that Qiu Honglei had gone all the way to Chu Manor and requested to become Zu An’s concubine, and that she was Chu Chuyan’s rival in love. Later, even though she had failed, her relationship with big brother Zu had clearly remained quite close. Now that the master and disciple were in trouble, how could big brother Zu just stand to the side without doing anything?

It would be one thing if they met in a different place, as with big brother Zu’s cultivation, it wouldn’t be too much trouble to save them. However, there were so many daoist experts on Golden Peak right now, and Sir State Teacher was present. If Zu An helped the Devil Sect under so many prying eyes, how was he supposed to remain in the court in the future?

Yan Xuehen also understood that point. Furthermore, she knew that Zu An and Yun Jianyue were extremely close. There was no way he would just watch everything with his hands folded. When she thought about how Yun Jianyue’s whims had put Zu An in this predicament, she couldn't help but shoot Yun Jianyue a glare. It’s all this woman’s fault!

Yun Jianyue could feel the provocative look, so she also shot Yan Xuehen an angry glare. If not for this stone cold woman’s meddling, she wouldn’t even have been exposed.

Just then, Wang Wuxie asked, “Sect Master Yun, why have you caused trouble in Violet Mountain? Do you really think that the daoist sects are pushovers?”

Yun Jianyue said proudly, “The world is so large, I can go wherever I please, so why would I have so many misgivings? But this time, my disciple didn’t even use any underhanded means and even held back on her strongest skills for fear of exposing her identity. Even so, she still surmounted all difficulties and even took first place. Is that all the daoist sects amount to?”

When they heard that, the young disciples of the daoist sects all felt their faces heat up. They had actually let the inheritor of the Devil Sect take first place!

Wu Xiaofan and the others had conflicted expressions. Wu Xiaofan in particular had been a bit unconvinced about losing to Qiu Honglei at first, because he was injured going into the fight. Now that he learned that she had actually been holding back, all that remained was a feeling of shame.

Wan Tongtian harrumphed. “Who says she took the number one place? She still hasn’t fought with Jadefall Palace’s martial niece, so how can you just say that she’s the first place winner?”

Yun Jianyue retorted, “My disciple is here, so why don’t you bring that niece of yours here to fight her?”

Wan Tongtian angrily replied, “You clearly know that she’s missing…” He suddenly realized something and asked, “Did you kidnap her because you wanted your disciple to take first place?”

Yun Jianyue said indifferently, “Your own Jadefall Palace didn’t keep a good eye on your disciple. What does this have to do with me?”

At the same time, she secretly said to Zu An, “Don’t worry, that Pei girl is hidden in my room’s wardrobe. She isn’t hurt.”

Zu An’s worries were finally set at ease. But soon after, his expression changed. Then, didn’t that mean she had seen everything between him and Yun Jianyue? Just what kind of a weird fetish does this Yun Jianyue have?

As if guessing what he was thinking, Yun Jianyue blushed. She gave him an annoyed look and added, “What kind of nonsense are you thinking? She was unconscious last night.”

Zu An chuckled awkwardly when he heard that, but then sighed in relief.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

…

Nearby, Yan Xuehen saw the two of them exchanging looks and knew that they were definitely up to something. For some reason, she felt a bit unhappy.

…

Just then, Li Changsheng added, “Witch, aren’t you acting a bit too arrogant here? Since you’re so fond of coming to Violet Mountain, you should just remain here for a hundred and eighty years to quell your evil tendencies.”

Yun Jianyue sneered. “Are you daoist sect people planning on going against the etiquette of the world of warriors by using your advantage in numbers?”

Guan Chouhai replied with a laugh, “Sect Master Yun, what use is such sophistry? Against those like you who have walked the crooked path, there is naturally no need to talk about any so-called etiquette.”

“As expected of you, Mister Guan. You’re actually able to talk about something so despicable in a dignified manner,” Yun Jianyue said, her expression cold. “Still, even if all of you come at me together, even if I can’t win, none of you can stop me if I want to leave.”

The conspirators from the daoist sects exchanged a look. They knew that what she said was true. Previously, they had needed to ambush Wang Wuxie, and they even had Feng Wuchang working for them from the inside; that was the only reason they had succeeded. Right now, Yun Jianyue was in tip-top shape. It wouldn’t be so easy to keep her here. With their important mission to take care of as a priority, they didn’t want to suffer any serious injuries.

Feng Wuchang chuckled and said, “We might not be able to keep you here, but we can definitely keep your disciple here.”

Yun Jianyue’s expression changed. She snapped, “What right does a trifling peak master have to interrupt when we’re talking?!” She appeared right in front of Feng Wuchang and sent a palm straight at his head as soon as she spoke.

Feng Wuchang’s body instantly turned ice-cold. He felt an endless sea of blood and a mountain of corpses in front of him. Yun Jianyue seemed to have come from the very depths of hell. He actually couldn't muster even the slightest strength to resist!

Just as the palm was about to make contact with his head, a Buddhist sound filled the air, and a golden buddha suddenly appeared amid the world of corpses and blood. It reached out a hand to stop her lethal attack.

Yun Jianyue gave Master Jian Huang a displeased look and called out, “Baldie, are you going to make our Holy Sect your enemy too?”

Master Jian Huang put his palms together and said, “Amitabha buddha, this old one is quite indebted to Benefactor Feng’s treatment as of late, so I have accepted this piece of karma. That is why I cannot remain a bystander.”

Guan Chouhai, Li Changsheng, and the others cried, “Witch, you actually dare to hurt one of us? Do you really think we wouldn’t act at all?”

They began to surround Yun Jianyue. A battle seemed on the verge of breaking out at any time. With them taking the lead, Kunlun Void’s Elder Xuan Dou, Mount Luofu’s Elder Xu, Purity Temple’s Sect Master and Vice Sect Master, Supreme Mystery Cave’s Cave Master Mu, and the others also moved closer.

Yan Xuehen frowned, but she didn’t move. After what they had gone through in the secret dungeon, she couldn't bring herself to surround and attack Yun Jianyue.
