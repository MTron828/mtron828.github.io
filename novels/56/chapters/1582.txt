Chapter 1531: Return to True Self

Long, long ago, it was recorded that there was a fish fry that dwelled deep in the dark north, named Kun. It was so large that it couldn't be cooked in a single pot…

The young Kun was thousands of miles long; it could transform into a bird, becoming a Peng. The Peng’s wingspan was thousands of miles wide as well. When it took flight, it could cover the skies like clouds. It would nest deep in the south instead…

Various records all stated that the Kun could transform into a Peng. That Peng wasn’t quite the same as the Fiend races’ Great Peng race, though. It was clearly many, many times larger and stronger.

The Kun grew through feasting. There were different types of Kun depending on how they feasted, such as the Corpse Kun, Bright Kun, Blue Kun, Earth Kun, Herbivore Kun, Bone Kun, Giant Kun, Spirit Kun, Vicious Kun, Devouring Kun… The Kun’s skills were completely reliant on such feasting.

Meanwhile, the Kun Peng diagram in Zu An’s body had awakened the Kun Peng’s power. Feasting on enemies would make him stronger, and there were no side effects.

Zu An was really happy to see that at first. The Heaven Devouring Sutra could swallow the cultivation of his enemies, but there were a lot of side effects, so he didn’t want to use it recklessly. However, when he saw the word ‘feasting’, his eyelids couldn't help but twitch. Wouldn’t he be just like a wild beast, a cannibal? He wanted to throw up just thinking about it.

Just then, however, a noise went off in his mind due to a message from the Keyboard System. Because he had the Heaven Devouring Sutra, the two skills were merged to form a new ability.

He didn’t have to feast as the initial description suggested; instead, he would just have to kill his opponent. At the same time, the entire cultivation system would be reconstructed. It would no longer be the path of an ordinary cultivator, but rather an entirely new numerical system.

Something similar to an experience bar appeared in his mind. Subsequently, whenever he killed an enemy, that experience bar would grow. Once it was maxed out, his level would increase. Furthermore, there was the number 69 next to the experience bar. It was clear that he was currently at Lv. 69.

‘Isn’t this a bit too ridiculous?’ Zu An thought, unable to help but mock the Keyboard System. Why did it seem almost as if he were in a game? It didn’t even feel like cultivation anymore.

He had discovered that as his cultivation rank increased and he unlocked more of these smaller systems, the system also became much smarter. At the very least, it could respond to some of his simpler questions.

The current system layout has been modified into the format easiest for the user to understand. There are other interface models, but based on the user’s knowledge and background, the user would not be able to understand them.

That was the keyboard’s reply.

Zu An was speechless. He was actually being looked down on by this damn keyboard!

Still, he had to admit that it made some sense. This was indeed a much easier way for him to understand what was going on. Thus, he swiftly checked his own condition. He discovered that he couldn't tell whether he was at the core form or power soul stage anymore.

He couldn't help but become a bit worried. Big sis Yun was teaching me how to temper my heart at the power soul stage, but the entire stage is now gone?

Yun Jianyue suddenly voiced her surprise. “Huh? What’s going on? Why do I feel as if your impure flame has disappeared? Wait, why can’t I sense your cultivation anymore? What happened? Did you become a normal person?”

Yun Jianyue really was shocked. Previously, even though Zu An was mysterious, she had still been able to more or less tell what cultivation rank he was at. For a grandmaster, it would be strange if she couldn't recognize the cultivation rank of someone at a lower rank than her. But now, she couldn't sense the slightest bit of ki from him. He didn’t even feel like a cultivator; he now seemed no different from an ordinary person… apart from being a bit more handsome.

There was no way his cultivation rank was higher than hers either. For those with higher cultivation than her, it was hard for her to see through them too, but she could at least sense the power coming from their bodies and know not to provoke them.

Did something happen when I was helping him before? Did I make his cultivation deviate and turn him into a cripple?

She was so scared she was about to cry when she thought of that. But I didn’t do anything wrong before!

This won’t do. I have to find Yan Xuehen to take a look. Her daoist faction might know a bit more about these things.

She couldn’t waste time worrying about Yan Xuehen finding out what had happened. All she wanted was to save Zu An as quickly as possible.

Zu An had a strange expression when he saw Yun Jianyue’s nervous appearance. He grabbed her hand and said, “Big sis Yun, I’m probably okay.”

“What do you mean you’re okay? I can’t even sense your cultivation anymore! Are you really no different from a pretty boy now?” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, her voice shaking a bit. Even though she didn’t mind having a pretty boy like that, she still didn’t want Zu An to become a cripple.

“I really am okay,” Zu An said. He thought for a bit, then realized that his words were a bit powerless. As such, he took out the Tai’e Sword and casually brandished it to one side. Blinding sword ki fired outward, causing a huge explosion.

When she saw a nearby mountain split apart, leaving behind a new valley, Yun Jianyue blinked. It seemed that the whole process seemed to be beyond her grandmaster rank perception.

“You clearly don’t have any ki fluctuations coming from you though…” Yun Jianyue muttered, unable to understand. Furthermore, she couldn't sense the slightest bit of a cultivator’s energy when he attacked. Just what the heck was going on with this world?

“It might be because my cultivation method is a bit special, so it’s changed somehow…” Zu An trailed off, not knowing how to explain it either. However, he finally convinced her that he was fine and that he was now in the best possible condition.

Yun Jianyue examined Zu An’s body for a long time, but she didn’t find anything strange, so she sighed in relief. Then, a strange smile appeared on her face. She said, “If you were to ambush someone in your current state, you really would be unstoppable.”

After all, in the eyes of other cultivators, Zu An was no different from an ordinary person. They wouldn’t even put up any precautions against him. How could they possibly react if he suddenly attacked them? For someone like Yun Jianyue from the Devil Sect, a surprise attack wasn’t really dishonorable. On the contrary, if it succeeded, that was the embodiment of wisdom.

Zu An shook his head slightly, saying, “I don’t think I even need to use surprise attacks anymore.”

After thinking to herself for a bit, Yun Jianyue didn’t say anything else. Zu An had finally obtained the conviction of the invincible, so there was no need to make it waver.

“You really scared me to death just now,” Yun Jianyue said, getting dressed while holding her chest. “Seeing as you seem fine now, it’s time for me to go too.”

Zu An jumped in fright and quickly hugged her, exclaiming, “Didn’t you say you weren’t going to go?”

A gentle expression appeared on Yun Jianyue’s face when she sensed his warm hug. She replied, “I only said that before to appease your inner demon state. I already told you that I’ve been away for too long and the Devil Sect is a mess. I have to go back, or else there will be… problems.”

Zu An knew that she was speaking the truth, but he still couldn't hide his disappointment. He asked, “Then was everything else you agreed to real or fake?”

Yun Jianyue raised her brows. A hint of dangerous intent appeared in her eyes. She asked, “What did I agree to?”

Zu An had an embarrassed smile. He discovered that now that his inner demon was gone, he had many more misgivings. He could only say, “You know.”

“Damn punk, why didn’t I realize you were this daring before? You actually dare to have those kinds of dreams?” Yun Jianyue harrumphed. Still, she came from the Devil Sect and usually went against established practices, so she nonchalantly said, “As long as you can convince that stone cold woman, I have no objections.”

She assumed that if this guy treated Yan Xuehen disrespectfully, her Snowflake Sword would fly straight over to him. There was no way Yan Xuehen would ever agree to such a ridiculous request. As such, she wasn’t losing out on anything by giving out such a blank check. If that scenario never happened, it would be because of Yan Xuehen, and she wouldn’t have to be the bad guy.

If you’re going to hate someone, go and hate Yan Xuehen~ she thought, suddenly feeling that she really was smart.

However, she hadn’t expected Zu An’s eyes to light up as he asked, “Really?”

Yun Jianyue was stunned. What is up with this guy’s strange confidence?

Why do I suddenly feel as if I’ve dug a huge pitfall for myself?

However, she quickly tossed that absurd thought aside. How could the stone cold woman possibly agree to that?!ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Of course,” she said, intending to send him off so she could get away. “Alright. I really have to leave now.”

“Why not stay here and keep me company for three more days?” Zu An asked somewhat reluctantly.

“Three days?” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, turning red-faced. Forget about three days, she wouldn’t even last another three hours. She really could break if she stayed here!

As such, she refused no matter how sweet-sounding Zu An’s words were. In the end, Zu An couldn't really keep her from her important tasks and reluctantly let her leave.

After refusing Zu An’s offer to send her off, Yun Jianyue waved her hand casually. She wanted to leave in a confident and easy way, but as soon as she flew into the air, she felt her legs weaken. She staggered and almost fell straight down. She shot Zu An an annoyed look, and only then did she stabilize herself and disappear into the horizon.
