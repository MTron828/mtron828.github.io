Chapter 1189: Golden Crow Crown Prince

The expressions of those present changed. They thought to themselves, How daring! The Snake race’s leader is right here, and yet this person is actually hollering for them to choose a new clan leader?

Yu Yanluo’s expression was grim. She walked straight in. The two young ladies, Little White and Little Blue, followed her in too. Zu An knew Yu Yanluo was wounded, so he followed behind her while on guard.

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen exchanged a look. Both of them would just be watching from the sidelines, so they didn’t mind seeing some drama at all. They also followed her in.

These fiend race people can argue among themselves as much as they want; the more they fight the better!

The group entered the discussion hall and saw two elders standing in the center. One was dressed in white, while the other was dressed in blue. The clothes they wore were much fancier than those of the Snake race civilians they had seen along the way.

The elders’ breathing was steady, and the light within their eyes was reserved. They were clearly both powerful cultivators. These two were probably the Elder White and Elder Blue Maid Xing had been talking about before.

But at the moment, they were nothing like the powerful officials Maid Xing had spoken of, and were instead extremely respectful to the young man in the highest seat, as if they were humbly awaiting his instructions.

The young man’s clothes flickered with golden light; his entire figure was bright yellow, looking incredibly gaudy. He looked rather handsome and extraordinary. Unfortunately, his slightly protruding mouth ruined his entire appearance, making him look somewhat fierce and malicious.

There were several golden-armored warriors standing by his side. All of them had resolute expressions. Their gazes were a bit different from those of normal guards; they seemed to contain a hint of pride.

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen both frowned, a hint of worry appearing in their eyes. This young man was probably the Fiend King Court emissary Little White and Little Blue had spoken of.

Are the fiend races really that strong already? Even a mere emissary is at the master rank, and not someone who’s just entered the master rank at that?

“Who was it who said that my clan should reselect our leader?” Yu Yanluo called out, looking coldly at the person. Hmph, you’re far too inferior to my Ah Zu.

The white and blue-clad elders turned around, looking overjoyed when they saw her. They both greeted her respectfully. “We greet the clan leader!”

Zu An was very surprised. The two looked extremely respectful, completely different from how Maid Xing had described them. When he gave Maid Xing a look, he saw that she was completely stunned.

Yu Yanluo was also somewhat stunned. However, she quickly gestured for the two to stand back up, saying, “The two of you are elders; there is no need for such formality.”

The young man’s flickering golden eyes lit up. He said, “I have heard about the Snake race’s Medusa Empress’ beauty for a long time. Today, I see that your reputation is fully deserved.”

Yu Yanluo frowned slightly. The man’s undisguised expression made her feel extremely uncomfortable. She asked, “And your distinguished self is?”

Elder White and Elder Blue introduced him, saying, “This is the Golden Crow Crown Prince.”

“What?!” Let alone Yu Yanluo, even Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue’s expressions changed. None of them had expected the emissary of the Fiend King Court to actually be the Golden Crow Crown Prince.

The current Fiend Emperor was also a Golden Crow, and the Golden Crow Crown Prince was the next successor to the throne. Why would such a person run all the way over to be an emissary? Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen couldn't figure it out no matter how they thought about it.

Could it be that there’s some kind of dispute within the fiend races’ royal family, and that the crown prince lost his status and was dispatched to the border?

But judging from how arrogant and despotic he seemed to be, that really didn’t seem to be the case.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I greet the Golden Crow Crown Prince,” Yu Yanluo said, bowing slightly. His status was respected among the fiend races, so she had to at least show him that level of respect. Even though she didn’t like him, as the clan leader, she couldn't bring her clan unnecessary trouble.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince gave her a look. His eyes wandered across her chest, waist, bottom, and other sensitive areas. He said, “You seem to be wounded. This crown prince has a spiritual pill here that can help your injuries.”

Yu Yanluo said indifferently, “There is no need. I have already taken the world’s best pill medicine. There is no need for the crown prince to use up anything for me.”

“Oh? The world’s best pill medicine? May I ask what kind of medicine it is to claim such a title?” the Golden Crow Crown Prince asked excitedly.

Yu Yanluo’s face turned a bit red as she replied, “It is just the best medicine in my opinion. It might not be useful for others.”

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue’s expressions became strange. They obviously knew how she had been treated. But did she really have to say she had taken medicine…

Don’t tell me…

Yun Jianyue was from the Devil Sect, so she had been influenced by it. Even Yan Xuehen was someone who had dominated the world for many years, so she wasn’t as naive as an innocent young lady. The same scenes appeared in the two women’s minds at the same time.

Hmph, this woman really is shameless!

The Golden Crow Crown Prince just assumed it was an excuse for refusing his medicine. He couldn't help but feel a bit annoyed. This woman doesn’t want a medicine I’m personally bestowing? She really doesn’t know how to appreciate others’ kindness.

But her exceptional beauty gave him much more patience than normal. Anyone so beautiful had the right to be somewhat headstrong. This young master likes girls that are a bit feisty.

His gaze made Yu Yanluo extremely uncomfortable. She changed the topic and asked, “What was going on, with the crown prince asking for the clan leader to be replaced?”

“Medusa Empress, please do not feel offended,” the Golden Crow Crown Prince replied with a chuckle. “This crown prince came with a decree to summon the leaders of the different tribes. Father emperor has something to discuss with everyone. You have been absent from the Snake race all this time, so that was why I told them to just choose someone else to join. But since the empress has returned, there is naturally no reason to choose another leader.”

“A Fiend King Court general assembly?” Yu Yanluo asked seriously. “I wonder what kind of matter it is about?”

The Golden Crow Crown Prince said, “Father emperor said that it has been many years since he has seen all the tribe leaders. Now that he is getting older, he misses you all, and wants to summon you to have a lively get-together.”

Yu Yanluo’s expression changed. The crown prince put it nicely, but these clan leaders were all off enjoying their time in their respective domains; who would want to go to the Fiend King Court? Besides, who knew what would happen in the Fiend King Court? It was entirely possible that he would just take all of them hostage.

Zu An suddenly realized something. No wonder Elders White and Blue had acted differently from how Maid Xing described them, and had instead politely welcomed Yu Yanluo back. It turned out they had such a hot potato to hand off to her!

Yu Yanluo hadn’t expected to have such an annoying thing to deal with as soon as she returned. She said, “The crown prince can see that I am currently injured. Furthermore, the Snake race has gone through some great changes, so I have a lot of things to deal with. I fear that I cannot join this great meeting. I hope that the crown prince can pass on some good words to the Fiend Emperor for me.”

The Golden Crow Crown Prince’s expression immediately darkened. He said grimly, “Before I left the Fiend King Court, father emperor told me that the various tribes’ kings must all be present. Otherwise, it would be viewed as a rebellion, and the clan would be punished as well. I hope that the Medusa Empress will not make that mistake.”

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen exchanged a look. They could both see the shock in each other’s eyes.

The Fiend Emperor is making such a huge fuss over this. Just what is he trying to do?

Don’t tell me he plans to coerce all of the clans to attack the human world?

Yu Yanluo’s expression changed. She said, “Since it is the Fiend Emperor who is summoning me, then our Snake race must naturally join.”

The Golden Crow Crown Prince nodded in satisfaction and said, “Good. Now that official matters are completed, this crown prince has heard that the scenery around the Snake race territory is quite good. I wonder if the empress can show me around as a guide?”

Little White and Little Blue rolled their eyes. There’s absolutely nothing around the Snake race territory; what do you mean nice scenery? It was blatantly obvious that he just wanted Yu Yanluo to accompany him.

Before Yu Yanluo could reply, Zu An couldn't hold back any longer and said, “The empress’ body is unwell, so it is inconvenient for her to go out. Furthermore, she does not often spend time here, so she is unfamiliar with the local surroundings. If the crown prince wishes for someone to show you around, Elders White and Blue should be more suitable.”

The expressions of Elders White and Blue changed. They began to curse at Zu An inwardly, yet they couldn't really say anything. They could only agree. After all, helping an outsider target their own empress really would be a bit unsightly.

But suddenly, the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s expression sank. He remarked, “And where did you crawl out from? This crown prince is talking to the empress about proper matters; where is there any room for a guard like you to interrupt?”

He had had his subordinates gather information about the Snake race. He knew about all of the Snake race’s important figures, and there was no information on this man. He just treated him as an ordinary guard.
