Chapter 1708: One for Another

Zu An said seriously, “You can send that message once you escape yourself. For now, first take off your clothes.”

Concubine Bai was stunned. In that instant, she felt as if she had completely misjudged the person in front of her. Was he going to assault her in her moment of crisis?

However, when she saw him take off the chubby nanny’s clothes, she knew that she had misunderstood him. An awkward look flashed across her beautiful face as she said, “That won’t work. You won’t be able to fool a three-year-old child if you only change the clothes.”

Whether it was their age, appearance, or build, there wasn’t a shred of similarity between them. If such a thing really worked, everyone in the world would have to have gone blind.

“Don’t worry about that. I have my ways,” Zu An said as he took off the nanny’s clothes while feeling really conflicted. Just what kinds of women did he remove the clothes from with his own hands? Chuyan, Manman, Yanluo, Xuehen, big sis Yun… Which one of them wasn’t an extraordinary beauty? And yet today, they were being wronged like this. He was removing the clothes of such a large, disgusting woman.

Fortunately, the nanny wore a lot of clothes, so he didn’t touch anything he didn’t want to. Soon after, he finished removing her outer garments. When he turned around, he saw Concubine Bai sitting in bed with her eyes wide, looking in his direction. Her clothes were still untouched.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zu An couldn't help but frown. He asked, “Why are you wasting time right now?”

Concubine Bai was embarrassed as she replied, “I… can’t muster any strength. I can’t take them off.”

Zu An then remembered that her restrictions were special. That Zhao Han really is something. Even some random seal he made is enough to turn a powerful cultivator completely harmless.

After some hesitation, Concubine Bai asked, “Will we really be able to fool them if I change my clothes?”

“Trust me, it’ll work,” Zu An said with a nod.

Concubine Bai bit her lip. She looked conflicted, but she still said, “Then please help me take them off.”

Zu An was speechless. Just what kind of situation had they gotten in already? He wanted to be a gentleman, and yet he always ended up in these kinds of situations where he had to make mistakes.

Still, he knew that there was no time. After some slight hesitation, he didn’t refuse her, saying, “Sorry.”

Concubine Bai pursed her lips and moved her hand aside. She knew the importance of the situation and didn’t demand something melodramatic such as making Zu An close his eyes. However, when his hand touched her body, she still couldn't help but shake all over. A layer of redness covered her skin.

Zu An had a strange expression. This woman was clearly a mother, and yet she was acting like a maiden when embarrassed. He said, “Don’t worry too much. I’m only taking off your outer garment. You’ll still be wearing your inner clothing.”

Concubine Bai voiced her understanding and knew that she was overreacting too. However, when his hand pressed against her body, she felt as if electricity ran through her entire body. It was something she had never experienced before.

Even though Zu An did his best to avoid touching her as much as possible, he still couldn’t avoid making contact sometimes. He sighed inwardly at how soft her body was, and how amazing she smelled. Compared to that big nanny, it really was like the difference between heaven and earth.

In order to ease their mutual awkwardness, he took the chance to ask, “Why was that nanny so terrible to you? No matter how dire of a situation you’re in, you’re still a concubine.”

Concubine Bai explained, “Nanny Ping is an old face in the palace, and quite a few young maids and other newcomers have been bullied by her before. In the past, because of something minor, a young maid was tormented to death. After I learned of that fact, I punished her for it. She probably still harbors a grudge over that incident.”

Zu An nodded. In a place that was as freakish and dangerous as the Imperial Palace, there weren’t many nannies who were normal.

Finally, after a rather intimate process, he successfully removed her dress. Concubine Bai felt very embarrassed and ill at ease. She hugged her knees as she curled up on her bed like a little white flower amid frigid winter winds.

However, she still summoned her courage and said, “Even if I change clothes, it won’t fool anyone.”

Zu An frowned and said, “Don’t worry, I have a way.”

He didn’t swap their clothes, and instead took out a wardrobe. Under Concubine Bai’s shocked gaze, he put the nanny’s clothes inside. Concubine Bai noticed that when he put the clothes inside, he seemed to be hesitant. He grimaced and muttered something under his breath.

However, Zu An still put them in. A while later, he took them out again and said, “Alright, you can change into them now.”

The wardrobe was ‘Pin Ru’s Wardrobe’, which he had obtained from the system in the past. As long as the clothes were placed inside, then put on someone else, they would look just like the original owner. The effect was only useless against Zu An, perhaps the creator of the wardrobe had been worried that he would do some filthy things with it…

Concubine Bai was surprised. However, when Zu An put her clothes on Nanny Ping, her eyes widened. She was shocked to discover that the large and stocky Nanny Ping had actually taken on her exact appearance!

“Just what kind of ability is this?” Concubine Bai exclaimed. She was quite knowledgeable herself, but the sight before her was still beyond her wildest imaginations.

“That’s a secret,” Zu An said with a chuckle. In truth, he didn’t really understand the principles behind it either. Rather than trying to explain it, it was better to act a bit mysterious to get by for the time being.

Concubine Bai looked at the man in front of her with a strange expression. Even though she had already known that he was different when she met him in the palace, she had always been quite confident in her ability to see through him. She knew he had his secrets, but only now did she realize how arrogant she had been. This man was actually full of mysteries!

Zu An walked over again. He put on her clothes while saying with a frown, “Your current condition might make things a bit hard.”

Nanny Ping had a rough and tough appearance, and was normally quite vigorous. If she suddenly became weak and passive, her appearance would easily draw suspicion.

Concubine Bai’s face reddened. She said, “I have a pill in my satchel that can temporarily stimulate one’s energy. Even though it won’t be enough to break the emperor’s seal, it shouldn’t have any problem returning me to the level of a normal person.”

Zu An asked, “Won’t it have a lot of side effects?” He knew the Devil Sect loved to use things that ignited their own blood essence.

Concubine Bai shook her head slightly and said, “There are some side effects, but I’ll be able to recover after a period of time. We don’t really have the luxury of worrying about those right now, anyway.”

Zu An figured that what she said made sense. With her life being at risk, they could worry about everything else later. Thus, Concubine Bai guided him toward her most personal area. He felt a soft and incredible sensation. Both of them were stunned.

Concubine Bai began breathing quickly. She bit her lip and said, “It’s… a bit further inside.”

Zu An focused his attention, and finally took out the drug and fed it to her. A flush of rosiness returned to Concubine Bai’s face. A while later, she said, “I can move now. I’ll put on the clothes on my own.”

Zu An nodded. After letting her go, he quickly set up the room.

Suddenly, however, he noticed something. Concubine Bai made a shushing motion and looked vigilantly at the door.

“Sir Zu, why is it not finished yet after all this time?” Eunuch Wen called out, seeming to have already moved closer to the tent.

“It’s already done,” Zu An said, striking Nanny Ping’s lethal acupoint and moving her to the bed. Concubine Bai coordinated with him and stood next to him.

Eunuch Wen pushed aside the curtains and walked straight in. He gave Concubine Bai a look, and her heart immediately began to race. However, Eunuch Wen didn’t seem to have noticed anything strange. Instead, he moved closer to the bed to examine the corpse. Even though she wasn’t breathing anymore, he secretly blew apart her meridians while examining the corpse. Now, she really couldn't be more dead.

Zu An felt a sense of lingering fear. Fortunately, he hadn’t used that fake death pill Ji Xiaoxi had given him, or else Concubine Bai would really have died even though she was pretending.

Eunuch Wen got up afterward, seemingly satisfied. He said to the two of them, “Take care of the corpse. Don’t let anyone else find out about this.”

“Understood!” Zu An replied. Suddenly, however, his expression changed.

That was because at the same time, Eunuch Wen sent him a ki transmission that said, “Once you’re done with this, kill Nanny Ping too.” Then, before leaving, he patted Zu An’s shoulder and gave him a look, implying that this was the emperor’s will.
