Chapter 75: The Treatment

Translator: Pika

Snow’s face reddened. Failing to deal with someone of Zu An’s caliber was utterly shameful. “I’m still not sure what happened, but I suddenly felt an unbearable pain in my abdomen. That fellow is simply too lucky to have encountered me in such a state.”

As she said those words, she recalled that this wasn’t the first time she’d been done in by Zu An.

“Yes, that fellow does have oddly good luck,” replied Mei Chaofeng. Could someone who had won seven-and-a-half million silver taels from his casino in two rounds possibly have bad luck?

Women really can’t be trusted. Snow acts as if she owns the world, but she messed everything up as soon as she got down to business. If I’d known she was so untrustworthy, I would never have written out the promissory note for seven-and-a-half million silver taels!

It was his faith in her ability to easily retrieve the note that made Mei Chaofeng accede to writing it out in the first place. Who could have known that Snow would actually fail in her mission, and leave a huge, steaming pile for him to clean up?

A murderous glint flashed across Mei Chaofeng’s eyes. “It looks like I have to personally make a move then!”

The seven-and-a-half million silver taels’ debt was a curse that constantly plagued him no matter what he was doing. He was constantly worried about complications that could arise from it. Things would remain manageable if the note stayed with Zu An, but what if Zu An were to pass it on to someone else?

Snow was quick to advise him, “You mustn’t act recklessly. After the recent incidents, the Chu clan would surely tighten its security and assign some personal guards to protect Zu An. Even if you make a move, the chances of success would be slim at best.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“What should I do then?” Mei Chaofeng was exasperated. It was still this woman’s fault for alarming the Chu clan. “We can’t touch him in the Chu Estate, and it’s even more impossible in the academy. In fact, I suspect that Plum Blossom Twelve’s death might have been the doing of the academy.”

He suddenly recalled Plum Blossom Thirteen’s report that Zu An had been chatting amicably with Shang Liuyu in the gazebo. He couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to that meeting, especially considering everything that had happened recently. He couldn’t wrap his head around how a piece of trash like Zu An managed to obtain the help of so many distinguished individuals.

A smile crept onto Snow’s fair face. “Don’t worry, I’ll arrange something soon. It won’t take us long to drive him out of the academy.”

Mei Chaofeng knew that Snow was a special envoy dispatched to Brightmoon City by the young master, and she had access to many resources if required. He did not doubt her words.

“As long as you can get that scum expelled from the academy, I’ll personally make a move to ensure his death.” After all that had happened, Mei Chaofeng dared not delegate the matter to his subordinates anymore. To prevent further mishaps, he had to deal with this problem personally.

Snow was relieved by his declaration. “With Sect Master Mei personally making a move, that fellow’s days are numbered!”

She was confident she could deal with Zu An by herself, but the excruciating abdominal pain she had suffered earlier had left her traumatized. It was an experience she never wanted to go through ever again. Mei Chaofeng’s decision to take a personal hand in this was truly a blessing.

...

The following morning, Zu An woke to the sight of a beaming Cheng Shouping standing right beside his bed. He recoiled in shock, then asked warily, “What are you up to?”

“Young master, Master has told me to inform you that you don’t have to head to the academy today. You may stay at home to recuperate from your injuries,” Cheng Shouping replied, his smile growing more delighted.

Zu An nodded and asked, “Is that why you have that silly look on your face?”

“I’m just feeling happy on young master’s behalf. It looks like Master and Madam regard you very highly. They even sent professional guards to your side in order to ensure your safety. This is a special treatment that even the young miss doesn’t enjoy!”

As Zu An became more valued in the eyes of the Chu clan, Cheng Shouping, as Zu An’s study companion, would be pulled up well. It looks like a brilliant future awaits me. I’ll become the most respected among the servants, and the maids will be desperate to gain my favor. Even Snow...

Thinking about Snow, Cheng Shouping’s smile suddenly froze. “Young master, was it really Snow who injured you last night? It’s hard to imagine that such an adorable girl could actually be so ferocious.”

Zu An glared impatiently at Cheng Shouping and berated him. “Do you think that I’d lie to you about that? My father-in-law and my wife have already investigated the matter, and they concluded that Snow had infiltrated the Chu clan with ulterior motives. She’s serving another master. Hm? It can’t be that you have some sort of special relationship with her, right?”

Cheng Shouping stiffened. He hurriedly waved his hands in denial. “No no no, please don’t misunderstand. I am completely unrelated to Snow. I knew that she wasn’t a good person right from the start. Despite being the First Miss’ maidservant, she dressed herself up and threw tantrums as though she were the mistress of the estate. It looks like I was right after all; she was indeed a spy. If I were to see her on the street in the future, I’ll surely bring her before you so that you can punish her accordingly!”

Zu An was shocked by Cheng Shouping’s ability to change his tune faster than even the most experienced of opera singers. If you really met Snow, all she would need to do is to toss her hair gently, and you’d be a goner. Tsk, you’re really all say.

“Ahem ahem~”

A light coughing came from outside. Zu An raised his head, and a smile broke out on his face as he saw Chu Chuyan standing by the doorway. “My wife dotes on me the most. She’s the first one in the entire estate to visit me personally.”

Cheng Shouping eyes were filled with indignant hurt. Am I not a human to you? Of course, he dared not put himself on the same pedestal as the First Miss, so he quickly stepped aside and invited Chu Chuyan in. “First Miss, please.”

Chu Chuyan stared at the two of them, a complicated look on her face. She’d heard the conversation between the two of them loud and clear. Birds of the same feather do flock together.

She did not enter the room, but spoke from where she was. “Divine Physician Ji will be coming over to treat you later on. He’s an eccentric person, so I came to warn you to restrain yourself in front of him. Make sure that you don’t offend him with your words.”

From the time they had spent together, she’d concluded that Zu An was a troublemaker through and through. It was as if his vile mouth existed for the sake of infuriating everyone around him. She wouldn’t have cared if it were anyone else, but Divine Physician Ji was no ordinary man. She was worried that Zu An would create a scene in front of Divine Physician Ji, and came to offer him a piece of advice.

“Divine Physician Ji? That’s great!”

Zu An was stunned for a moment before exploding in joy. He had thought of slipping out to look for Divine Physician Ji, just to find out how preparations for the treatment of ‘little Zu An’ were coming along. However, the personal guards assigned to him were, in every sense of the word, personal. There was no way to shake them off, and he could come up with no legitimate excuse for him to leave Chu Estate.

Just as his frustrations mounted, the Chu clan had actually invited Divine Physician Ji over for him.

Chu Chuyan’s mouth dropped open slightly, then she nodded. “Ah, I nearly forgot that you’re acquainted with Ji Xiaoxi. There should be no problem then.”

She had already heard about what had transpired in the academy.

“Honey, Ji Xiaoxi and I are only friends. There’s nothing going on between us.”

“Hm? Why are you clarifying that to me?” Chu Chuyan was baffled.

“There’s no need to be shy,” Zu An said with a chuckle. “An amazing man like me is bound to attract the attention of women no matter where I go. But, honey, there’s no need to get jealous. I swear that you’re the only one I like. I’d never do anything to let you down!”

Chu Chuyan stared at him, speechless, and Cheng Shouping mirrored her expression.

“Speaking of which, honey, were you the one who specially invited Divine Physician Ji over to care for me? Ahh, my wife is really the best!” Zu An walked over and seized the moment to hold her hands.

Chu Chuyan left the room, her face livid. I should never have dropped by this fellow’s room!

Cheng Shouping stared at Zu An, a complicated look in his eyes. Finally, he muttered, “Young master, now I understand how you were able to marry the First Miss.”

“Is that even a question at all? It’s all due to my charming looks!” Zu An boasted smugly.

Cheng Shouping shook his head. “No, it’s because you’re thick-skinned.”

Zu An’s eyes narrowed sharply. “Oh? Are you done copying the family rules?”

Cheng Shouping immediately lost his bravado. He put on a fawning smile and replied, “Ah... Hahaha, not yet. I’m still on my break.”

“Break, my ass! Hurry up and finish copying them!” Zu An bellowed. “I already gave you the money. You were the one who chose to be a scrooge and not hire any helping hands!”

“I’ll head over right now...” replied Cheng Shouping hurriedly. The young master is not just thick-skinned, he’s narrow-minded too. I must pay heed never to offend him.

Shortly after Cheng Shouping left the room grumbling, the butler, Hong Zhong, showed Ji Dengtu into Zu An’s room.

“Divine Physician Ji, this way please!”

Hong Zhong’s austere manner was highlighted by how he dressed. His hair was combed neatly, without a single strand out of place, and his clothes were free of wrinkles. All these gave him an imposing presence.

At the moment, though, he was conducting himself humbly and respectfully.

Zu An was reminded of Chu Chuyan’s personal visit to offer her warning. From the looks of it, this licentious physician was really quite a big deal.

Hong Zhong began introducing the two men to one another. “Young master, this is Divine Physician Ji. He boasts incredible medical skills, so please do not offend him.” He bowed toward the divine physician. “Divine Physician Ji, this is young master Zu An of our Chu clan. He was severely injured by a fifth rank cultivator last night. We’ve already treated him at the manor last night, but we’d like for you to take another look, just to be safe.”

“Oh~” Divine Physician Ji's reply was perfunctory. He stroked his beard and put on an arrogant air. However, when he finally caught sight of Zu An on the bed, his eyes immediately widened in astonishment.

Hong Zhong was thrown off by his reaction, and he asked hurriedly, “What’s wrong, Divine Physician Ji? Is there a problem here?”

Divine Physician Ji coughed lightly to conceal his surprise before replying, “I’m going to examine him now, and I need some privacy.”

“Yes, please go ahead. We’ll be right outside, so feel free to give us a call if you have any need for us.” Hong Zhong knew that Divine Physician Ji had many rules when it came to treating a patient, so he didn’t enquire further. With a wave of his hand, he gestured for the other servants in the room to leave.

Once they were all gone, Divine Physician Ji walked over and sat beside the bed. He slapped his hand down on Zu An’s thigh and exclaimed, “Not bad! I didn’t think that you would be able to escape from a fifth rank cultivator. You sure are a bag of surprises, aren’t you?”

His physical greeting had been none too gentle, and Zu An gasped in pain.

Zu An had a strong feeling that Divine Physician Ji had done it on purpose. Didn’t I earn just a few silver taels from your daughter back then? Do you really need to go this far?

“It was just luck. She fled in a hurry when she noticed the experts in the estate rushing over. I only survived by a hair’s breadth,” said Zu An almost truthfully. There was no way he would reveal his trump cards to others.

Divine Physician Ji nodded in understanding. “Dumb Chu is an eighth rank cultivator after all. It’s normal for any assassin to fear him.”

The way Divine Physician Ji addressed Chu Zhongtian as ‘Dumb Chu’ made Zu An wonder if there was some conflict between the two of them. Considering that perverted request Divine Physician Ji had made, could it be that... he had pursued Qin Wanru in his earlier years, only to have Chu Zhongtian beat him to it?

That’s not right. If that was the case, why would the Chu clan invite him over to treat him?

Forget it, I will have nothing to do with whatever grudges they hold. What’s important right now is that one little matter.

“Divine Physician Ji, have you found a cure yet?”

“Why don’t you go out to the streets and find out who I am? How could it be impossible for me to cure you?” Divine Physician Ji scoffed. “Don’t worry, I’ve brought it here!”

Zu An looked out of the doorway, and saw Butler Hong and the other guards standing not too far away. He was a little hesitant to talk about this in the presence of so many outsiders.

“Don’t worry,” Divine Physician Ji assured him, “they won’t be able to hear what we’re saying.”
