Chapter 1532: The Sound of a Heart Shattering

When he saw Yun Jianyue’s look of shame and anger, Zu An couldn't help but laugh. Her reaction was the greatest praise to a man. In the end, however, he reluctantly waved toward Yun Jianyue. It was time for him to return to the Imperial Palace too and get used to the new system.

…

In the following days, it turned out to not be too convenient for him to live in the Imperial Palace. Instead, he took up residence in a nearby place.

Various officials of the Fiend King Court all came to congratulate him and give him blessings as the new Regent. After all, what had happened that night was too shocking. They all knew that the young prince had been able to become the new Fiend Emperor almost purely through Zu An’s strength.

Furthermore, the Second Empress treasured him greatly. There were even some rumors of something between them. After all, one was a young widow, while the other was handsome and confident. It was easy to make that association.

Still, that kind of thing was also quite common among the Fiend races. It wasn’t something too shocking. Furthermore, no one had any proof, so they merely gossiped a bit during their leisure time. Many men were even jealous of Zu An’s happiness.

Of course, many young ladies who had witnessed Zu An’s handsomeness that night were also jealous of the Second Empress. They thought, This is a woman who already had a child, and yet she’s taking such a handsome young man for herself! It’s like feeding young grass to an old cow…

However, the ones who arrived were all respected figures. Even though they were all amazed, feeling that the Regent was even more handsome than the rumors claimed, they were more surprised about something else. The Regent didn’t seem to have the slightest bit of a ki aura around him. It was as if he were an ordinary person without any cultivation.

Of course, even though they were curious, none of them suspected anything. After all, he had just killed several grandmasters not too long ago. They all just assumed that his cultivation had already reached the point of returning to one’s true self, and that they just couldn't see it. As such, they all remained polite and courteous. Nothing unpleasant happened.

Zu An also received them patiently. After all, he didn’t have much of a foundation in the Fiend King Court right now. Making more friends was better than having more enemies. Of course, that wasn’t the most important thing. The most important thing was that the emissaries all brought abundant gifts, so why would Zu An refuse to meet them?

Money and precious metals were the basics, but in order to stand out more, they also carefully selected other valuable treasures to offer up. Many of them were helpful for cultivation, medicine, and health, while others were useful for pill refinement and forging. How could Zu An not become excited?

After taking stock of everything and collecting it into his Brilliant Glass Bead, even Zu An couldn't hide the smile on his face.

As expected, wealth comes quickly with authority! I worked so hard to gather all of my wealth alone, and yet it’s less than what I’ve received over the past few days.

“May I ask what happened that put such a huge smile on your face?” someone asked with a soft laugh. Zu An turned around and saw a beautiful figure standing nearby, wearing a long dress covered in blue scales.

“Big sis Shang!” Zu An exclaimed happily.

The person was none other than Shang Liuyu. She wasn’t dressed in the luxurious princess gown she had worn that night, but rather something more similar to the flashy scale dresses he often saw in his previous world’s nightclubs. That kind of dress was very alluring, and yet on her body, it seemed elegant. He had no idea how she was able to accomplish such a thing. Her hair was decorated simply with a piece of coral that added a moving, fiery red color to her beautiful hair.

However, the most eye-catching things were still her flawless exposed feet. Whenever she stepped on the ground, a faint ripple of water spread out from beneath her feet. They seemed to vaguely form a lotus diagram, giving her an air of detachment from this world’s vulgarities.

Shang Liuyu was also a bit lost in her thoughts at the moment. She blinked as she looked at the man in front of her. She knew he had always been good-looking, but she had never been someone who cared too much about appearance. But today, wasn’t he a bit too attractive…

Compared to how he usually looked, he almost seemed to have a faint holy glow around his entire body. He looked pure and refined. When she saw him, it was as if a great azure sea appeared in her mind, with floating clouds and a gentle breeze… She always had a vaguely pleasant impression of him for some reason.

However, her expression quickly changed. She asked, “Why did your cultivation disappear?”

Compared to his changes in appearance, she was more concerned with that. The Fiend races worshiped power above all. There were countless ambitious individuals with sinister designs in the Fiend King Court. If Zu An didn’t have his cultivation anymore, wouldn’t he be quickly chewed up until there weren’t even bone fragments left?

“Really?” a pleasantly surprised voice asked all of a sudden. Then, a distinctively large mouth appeared. Who else could it be but Chi Wen?

He was really excited, as if he had heard the best news ever. As the Dragon King’s ninth son, he had always been full of mettle. And yet, after he met this guy, he had faced setback after setback. The power Zu An displayed in the battle a few days prior had already left him in absolute despair. Thus, when he heard that Zu An had become a normal person, it was like music to his ears.

“Huh? You were here too?” Zu An asked in surprise.

Chi Wen glowered. He snapped, “You only care about my little aunt, so of course you didn’t notice me.”

Shang Liuyu’s face heated up. She shot her nephew a look and exclaimed, “Watch your mouth!” Then, she looked at Zu An worriedly.

Zu An said with a slight smile, “Don’t worry. I’m fine. Actually, I’m better than ever.”

Concerned that she wouldn’t believe him, he reached out a hand and fired a streak of sword ki. A nearby flower vase quickly had a hole blasted through it. The cut was incredibly smooth, and otherwise didn’t damage the vase at all. His control over his power was extremely fine.

Shang Liuyu sighed in relief when she saw that. In contrast, Chi Wen felt incredible despair. He had thought he could make a comeback, and yet harsh reality had struck, raining on his parade once again. He was left feeling incredibly gloomy.

Up until this point, he had even made sure to dress up in the Dragon Palace’s most luxurious clothes. He had thought he looked really handsome, and thus went to pay the Demon race’s Princess Suolun a visit.

As for Yun Jianyue, Yan Xuehen, the Medusa Queen, and the Elf Princess, even though they were goddess-like beauties, they were too close to Zu An. After taking his own safety into consideration, he didn’t dare to set his eyes on them.

However, Princess Suolun was different. He had already asked around and found out that she wasn’t Zu An’s woman. He thus felt his opportunity had come. As such, he had chosen a beautiful pearl from the Dragon Palace as a gift, then dressed himself up in an ‘incredibly handsome’ fashion to visit Princess Suolun.

Princess Suolun had received him and expressed her thanks for his gift. But for some reason, their conversation just seemed a bit dry, and her expression had remained rather indifferent. It was almost always Chi Wen talking, bragging about his recent achievements. Meanwhile, the princess’ responses were always ‘oh’, ‘haha’, or ‘I see’.

Even though Chi Wen really wanted to deceive himself into believing that she was captivated by him, he still had some self-awareness. Compared to Zu An’s appearance that night, he really wasn’t making much of an impression at all.

But Zu An already had so many beauties! There was no way that the glorious Demon race’s Princess Suolun would willingly lower herself to serve as a concubine, right? That was practically impossible! As such, he had released a deep sigh and launched a second assault on Princess Suolun.

It might just be a young lady’s reservations, so maybe she had feelings for me, but was just too embarrassed to show it!Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, who would have thought that after just a few words, Princess Suolun would yawn and get up, saying she was going to take a bath?

Chi Wen’s eyes had lit up. She’s going to take a bath, so soon after we started talking? Don’t tell me… She’s actually seducing me?

Or maybe she’s been completely won over by my charm and feels as if she has to dress up a bit better before meeting me? Women care a lot about their appearance, after all.

Maybe after being so close to me, she became infatuated with my masculinity and became a bit… down there, so she had to wash up?

He became more and more excited. He wanted to stay there longer, but he ended up getting shooed away by the Demon race’s staff. He was furious!

These people really don’t have an eye for good things at all! If not for Princess Suolun, this prince would have already taught them a lesson!

But for the sake of not leaving Princess Suolun with a bad impression, he hadn’t caused any trouble, and just quietly left to show his own elegant demeanor.

“Princess Suolun is definitely secretly watching me, heheheh…” When he thought such beautiful thoughts, Chi Wen’s eyes rolled upward and his mouth hung wide open; he even unwittingly stuck out his tongue.

Shang Liuyu gave her nephew a look of disdain. What is wrong with this kid again?

She turned to Zu An and said, “Now that the dust has settled here, I have to return to the Ocean races too.”

Zu An was surprised. He was just about to ask more about that when someone came to report that Princess Suolun had arrived to visit him.

Chi Wen’s eyes immediately lit up. Princess Suolun actually knew I was here and came looking for me?

She’s so caring and considerate… Where can you find a better woman in this world?

Once I return, I’ll definitely beg my father to agree to our marriage.

Then, he saw that Princess Suolun was wearing a fine, extravagant long dress. She’d had makeup done on her pretty face; she wore some powder, and her lips were bright red. Her skin was glowing, and her hair was glossy. Her freshly-bathed body gave off an almost misty air.

“Princess!” Chi Wen exclaimed as he ran over with a big smile, thinking he had to find a chance to tell her that there was no need for her to go through so much trouble when they met each other, that he liked it no matter what she looked like.

And yet, who would’ve thought that Princess Suolun didn’t even seem to have seen him? She had a brilliant smile as she sprinted toward Zu An in high spirits, exclaiming, “Big brother Zu!”

Chi Wen was dumbstruck.
