Chapter 1394: Wisdom in a Crisis

They had just run into one of the Four Perils, the Taowu. The monster had filled the entire mountain with resentment and had strength comparable to the Fiend Emperor. Now, they had run into an ascension soul sea monster?!

The ascension soul wasn’t that far from the earth immortal rank. Furthermore, it was in its home domain, so even if the Taowu came over to mess with it, nothing good awaited it.

Zu An thought to himself that his luck really was freaking terrible today. He even started to wonder if there was something wrong with the Unknown Region this time. Even though the previous Unknown Regions were dangerous, there hadn’t been any creatures this terrifying. Now, he felt like a noob player who had accidentally entered the highest-level dungeon.

The giant octopus-like sea monster’s tentacles swept toward them. However, Yun Jianyue harrumphed and took out her Crescent Ring, hacking at the closest tentacle. She had already recovered seventy percent of her strength by relying on the spring. She had much more confidence now than before.

However, she was stunned to find that the monster sent her weapon flying with a single lash of its tentacle. Even though her Crescent Ring wasn’t a divine weapon, it was a heaven-grade weapon! It could cut through metal effortlessly, and yet today, it couldn't even cut through the giant octopus’ flesh!

“Be careful!” Zu An warned her. There were more tentacles sweeping toward her. Even though he had seen some tentacle works, actually leaving the beauties around him to be at their mercy felt entirely different.

However, Yun Jianyue reacted quickly. Tapping her toes, she leaped backward like a mermaid, avoiding the attacks of the tentacles all around them. Despite that, she didn’t even have a moment to catch her breath before more tentacles surrounded her.

She recalled the Crescent Ring back to her side. Her hair that reached all the way to her bottom spread outward. Her face was completely dark, her eyes full of killing intent. Her surroundings turned blood-red as she activated her domain, no longer holding back at all. Despite blocking all the tentacles, however, she was still trapped.

Meanwhile, the temperature suddenly dropped. A trace of white crept across the azure seawater as part of it froze into ice. The Snowflake Sword in Yan Xuehen’s hands flew around gracefully, neutralizing the tentacles’ vicious attacks one after another.

Zu An noticed that whenever her sword tapped against the tentacles, a layer of frost covered their surface. However, they didn’t really freeze.

How terrifying was Yan Xuehen’s Snowflake Sword? When she used it in conjunction with her domain, any human cultivator, even those at the master rank, could end up instantly turning into a frozen sculpture. And yet now, this big octopus only had a layer of frost covering its tentacles!

Comparatively, Yu Yanluo was in much more danger. Her cultivation was inferior to that of the two grandmasters. A tentacle quickly wrapped around her. Her failure to evade in time quickly resulted in more tentacles binding her firmly in place.

Zu An was shocked. He was just about to rush over to save her when he saw that Yu Yanluo suddenly reappeared a dozen or so meters away. Meanwhile, the tentacles also loosened their grip. It turned out they had only captured a drawing, which had already been torn to shreds.

Zu An quickly used Grandgale to move over to Yu Yanluo’s side. Her face was pale white, and she still felt fear as she looked at the giant octopus’ tentacles. She explained, “After seeing Paper Bride’s methods, I also learned how to make a few substitutes.”

She excelled in drawing, and drawings were made on paper, so their abilities shared many similarities. It had been easy for her to learn from reference.

However, Zu An didn’t have time to praise her, because many more tentacles swept toward the two of them. He took out the Poisonous Prick, thinking of teaching it a proper lesson. The Poisonous Prick was a weapon that seemed to contain its own laws and principles. As long as it could pierce through and cause a wound, this giant octopus would be dead for certain, despite being a terrifying ascension soul grandmaster.

If it were any other ascension soul cultivator, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to hurt them, but this octopus was too big. Furthermore, it was brandishing its tentacle at him. If he couldn't land a shot even in such a situation, he would be just like the national soccer team’s strikers from his previous world.

Zu An was worried that its defense was too high, so he used the Star Shattering Imprint. His power increased tenfold as he thrust the Poisonous Prick at the incoming tentacle.

Spurt!

Zu An cheered inwardly, because it hit! However, his expression immediately changed, because something wasn’t right with the tentacle. It was too slippery, so his attack was deflected at an angle.

The great octopus seemed to have been scared badly and immediately pulled back all its tentacles. A world-shaking roar echoed through the region. The giant octopus was clearly infuriated that it had almost died at the hands of an ant.

You have successfully trolled the Kraken for +999 +999 +999…

Zu An felt a chill down his spine. This thing is called the Kraken?

As the tentacles withdrew, Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue finally broke free and moved over to his side. They all tacitly agreed to turn around and run on the spot. They knew that even if they joined forces, they might not be a match for the ascension soul stage sea monster.

Because their cultivations were quite high, they had been able to continue for a long time underwater without breathing. However, if they fought intensely, they definitely wouldn’t be able to hold on for that long. Furthermore, when they were underwater,whether it was the speed of their attacks or their ki consumption, it would be several times more difficult to maintain than on dry land.

“What happened? Did you miss?” Yun Jianyue asked in alarm as they fled.

The women naturally knew how powerful the Poisonous Prick in Zu An’s hands was, since they had teamed up with him to kill the Scaled Deathworm.

Zu An raised the dagger in front of them. As they saw the layer of pink mucus around it, he said with a strange expression, “That thing’s tentacle is covered in layers of thick mucus. Not only did it have extremely powerful defensive strength, it also made my attack slide to one side, causing it to miss.”

The Poisonous Prick was only a certain length, so he hadn’t been able to stab into the sea monster’s flesh at all. After learning that lesson, however, the Kraken wouldn’t give him a second chance.

“This is bad. That sea monster is chasing after us, and it’s much faster than us. We won’t be able to get away,” Yu Yanluo said. She turned around and saw the giant octopus swinging countless tentacles all over, wrapping around them like a huge web. Her face became deathly pale.

Women had a natural sense of fear and disgust toward tentacle-like objects. When they thought about being captured by those things, even Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen, who weren’t scared of death, felt frightened. Zu An knew they would be captured soon, too.

A resolute expression appeared on Yu Yanluo’s face. However, at that moment, Yan Xuehen stopped her and said, “Don’t do it. There is too big of a cultivation difference between the two of you. Even if you unleash the Medusa’s Eye at full power, you will not be able to petrify it, and will only destroy yourself.” She had personally experienced the highest level of the Medusa’s Eye before, so she had the right to say that.

Yan Xuehen’s hair fluttered around, and white light gradually spread outward from her. Meanwhile, Yun Jianyue also took out the Empress Lantern with a cold expression.

Zu An quickly grabbed Yun Jianyue’s hand and said, “You two, don’t be so hasty. I have a way.”

He remembered that back in Brightmoon City’s secret dungeon, he had personally witnessed Chu Chuyan using a certain forbidden skill to defeat Shi Kun, whom they hadn’t been a match for at all. After using the skill, she had almost perished. Yan Xuehen had clearly taught her that skill, and the current situation was just like Chu Chuyan’s back then. Even though he didn’t know what Yun Jianyue was doing, he knew it definitely involved a similar method.

To begin with, the two were injured. Using a forbidden technique to defeat an enemy this powerful could cause them to die on the spot, and it wouldn’t even be guaranteed to save them.

“Are you going to use that ‘come keyboard’ or something again? If you do that, you will also die,” Yan Xuehen said with a frown. The Kraken was an ascension soul cultivator that had already cultivated a yin soul. The entire sea was within its control. Even if they traveled several dozen li away, they still wouldn’t be outside its perception.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

If Keyboard Come were used to defeat the sea monster, with their huge difference in strength, Zu An would die first before it died.

“No…” Zu An replied. He didn’t have time to explain. He took out the Scaled Deathworm’s corpse from the Brilliant Glass Bead and threw it at the giant octopus behind him. Then, he grabbed the three women and swam toward the ocean bottom.
