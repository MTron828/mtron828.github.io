Chapter 1443: Disappeared Memories

Yan Xuehen cultivated the Unshakable Daoist Manual, so she didn’t care too much about worldly affairs, even in matters of life and death. She had always believed that she didn’t fear death, and of course, at present, she didn’t feel fear either.

However, she just couldn't remain as indifferent as before. She felt too many regrets. If she could do it all over one more time, there were many things she wanted to tell ‘him’ clearly.

Yun Jianyue sighed deeply. As the Devil Sect Master, there was already too much blood on her hands. She hadn’t expected that being killed by another would feel this way. Still, with this stone cold woman and Little An keeping me company, the Yellow Springs won’t be that boring, I guess.

Even so, dying together with her disciple’s man just felt a bit weird. Honglei, you can’t blame me for this later, alright…

Yu Yanluo was surprisingly calm. The fact that she would be able to die together with her lover made her feel much more blessed than Zu An’s other women outside.

However, she was still reluctant, especially when she thought about how wonderful their days would be if the two of them could spend the rest of their lives together.

In the end, the three women had already steeled their resolve to die here.

However, to their surprise, the terrifying woman before them lowered the hand she had raised. There was a somewhat strange and conflicted expression on her face.

Xi He was very confused. After seeing her ten sons leave together, she was furious and anxious, so she naturally took it out on the humans she encountered. And yet, suddenly, she felt as if this man seemed quite calm and open-minded in the face of death, and that he had a bit of a heroic appearance.

Even though he is a bit weak, he has some special qualities that other experts don’t have.

And I have to admit that he’s pretty handsome…

How many years has it been since I last saw Emperor Jun?

It’s been so long that I can barely remember.

Could it be that he’s already forgotten that he has a wife?

She suddenly felt a bit of resentment.

Are you not scared that I’ll find another man?

However, she quickly laughed to herself. Who would dare to touch Emperor Jun’s woman?

As all sorts of thoughts rushed through her mind, her killing intent dissipated too. She lowered her hand and decided to interrogate the man in front of her first.

However, when she saw the other three women, she was shocked by their beauty. Every single one of them wasn’t inferior to her at all! It was to the extent that she didn’t even know any other woman more beautiful than them!

When she saw the affection in their eyes when they looked at Zu An, she couldn't help but feel a hint of annoyance.

So he’s just a womanizer! He’s the same as Emperor Jun! 

She felt killing intent again. Of course, it wasn’t directed at Zu An, but rather at the women hanging around him. It was as if she were rebuking the three stunning women for seducing her man.

When he saw her movements, Zu An knew that there was trouble. He quickly shouted, “If you kill them, I’ll hate you for the rest of my life!”

Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue were stunned. Who are you to her? Why would she care what you think?

However, what almost made their eyes pop out was that the mature woman actually didn’t continue. Instead, she glared at Zu An and retorted, “What, would you even kill me for their sake?”

Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue thought to themselves, Doesn’t something sound a bit off?

Zu An didn’t dare to continue provoking her. Otherwise, if she really became angry, she could really kill the three women. That would be a total game over. He said, “Of course I wouldn’t kill you, but I would always feel bitter. We don’t have any grudges between us, so why should we create one?”

Xi He frowned. After some hesitation, she didn't follow through on her decision. She asked, “Was it really not you who caused trouble and made the little Golden Crows all go out at the same time?”

“It doesn’t have anything to do with us! Look at our cultivations. We couldn’t do anything to them. Why would they possibly listen to us?” Zu An replied.

“That makes sense,” Xi He said with a nod. With a wave of her hand, she brought them onto her carriage before continuing, “I will confirm things with them. If it really has nothing to do with you, I will let you go.”

Yun Jianyue and Yu Yanluo were stunned. They didn’t know why this terrifyingly powerful woman would suddenly become so agreeable. Had Zu An used some kind of witchcraft against her? When they thought about how powerful she was, though, they didn’t dare to ask any questions while so close to her. They could only remain quiet for the time being.

Only Yan Xuehen could roughly guess the reason. She felt both angry and embarrassed. She was embarrassed because she had suffered from the very same ‘Love Is More Solid than Gold’ skill. However, she was angry because the skill really was effective, and even someone as powerful as this woman, who was at the same rank as Zhao Han and the Fiend Emperor, couldn't resist it.

Then… Are the changes in my feelings for him really my true thoughts, or were they influenced by this skill?

The most hateful part was that he had actually used the skill on another woman!

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +300 +300 +300…

When he saw the Rage points pouring into the backend, Zu An could roughly guess what Yan Xuehen was thinking. However, he really didn’t have any way to explain himself.

Xi He steered the carriage directly out of the valley, toward the ten suns. She seemed to be really interested in Zu An along the way, continuously asking him about his background.

Yun Jianyue had a very strange look on her face. Why did this woman seem to have caught feelings for Zu An? That made no sense! Zu An was pretty handsome, but it wasn’t enough to make someone so powerful, the mother of the ten Golden Crows, experience love at first sight, right?

Zu An carefully replied to Xi He while finding a chance to ask, “Madam, how do the Golden Crows normally behave?”

Now that they were talking about her sons, Xi He’s expression became a bit softer. She replied, “Do you see the jade chicken atop the Fusang Tree? Whenever the darkness of night is about to disappear and daybreak is soon to arrive, the jade chicken spreads its wings and cries out. Once the jade chicken cries, the Golden Crows on Peach Valley Mountain also begin to cry out…”

“Peach Valley Mountain?” Zu An asked, stunned. He had never heard of that place before.

Xi He didn’t become impatient when she heard his question at all, and instead gently explained, “There is a demonic gate by Peach Valley Mountain, a place where countless demons travel through. Normally, Yu Helei oversees that place. All demons who dare overstep their boundaries are executed without exception and fed to the great tiger on the mountain. That is why many people from the secular world worship those two as gate deities. The people’s drawings depict their appearances warding off evil spirits by the gate…”

Zu An was startled. The gate deities he had always seen in his previous world were Generals Qin Shubao and Yuchi Gong. Back then, Emperor Taizong had been scared of the supernatural, so he had used two fierce generals’ portraits to ward off evil spirits. The gate deities were probably those two.

No wonder there were rumors that ghosts feared the cries of chickens. It was because, when the Golden Chicken of Peach Valley cried out, the demon gate would close. It would also peck at all sorts of monsters.

Wait, Xi He used the term ‘secular world’. Is she already an immortal?Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xi He continued, “When the Golden Chicken of Peach Valley Mountain cries out, all the stone chickens across the mountains and rivers also cry. When they cry, the rest of the chickens under the heavens also cry out. As waves of chicken cries resound, a bright and pure red sun appears from the surging tides and multicolored glow. I then ride this carriage, carrying that Golden Crow through the sky, bringing the world light.

“It has always continued like that everyday without any mistakes. And yet today… Something like this happened. A huge disaster is about to take place!”

Zu An thought of something and asked, “Madam, could it be that the Golden Crows just wanted to go out and play, so they secretly went out together?”

“That is impossible! A disaster happened in the past, and they would not dare to repeat it again…” Xi He’s expression suddenly stiffened as she spoke. Then, she felt a bit of pain in her head. She wondered, “Something major must have happened before, but why can I not remember what it was?”

Zu An and the others exchanged a look. All of them recalled the legend of Yi shooting down the suns. They thought that had already happened in this world, and yet why were there still ten suns? If nothing had happened, why would Xi He remember something?
