Chapter 1172: Little Bastards Don't Fight with Honor

Yun Jianyue shivered in horror, thinking, It’s all over!

The exact scenario she had feared the most had happened, but there was nothing she could have done other than to risk it all. Despite that, she had lost the gamble.

It was easy to imagine that Zu An would quickly be killed by the enemy. The three of them wouldn’t be able to escape either.

Even taking a thousand steps back and assuming that some of them managed to escape, the Scaled Deathworm wouldn’t be fooled so easily a second time. As long as it hid underground, who could even do anything to it?

From then on, it would just bide its time underground, only attacking when there were good opportunities. They would only be able to passively defend at that point as it attacked again and again. By then, a single slip-up would make them food.

Yan Xuehen clearly realized that as well. She shot Yun Jianyue a glare and cried, “The stuff you taught him is way too unreliable! You ended up sending Zu An to death!”

When faced with such criticism from her old enemy, for the first time, Yun Jianyue didn’t retort. Instead, she only looked nervously in Zu An’s direction.

Just then, the Scaled Deathworm moved. It suddenly turned around, biting down on the place where Zu An had just been

But Zu An had already used Grandgale to move several zhang away. He left behind a pile of assorted bottles and containers in his original location. The Scaled Deathworm just happened to bite down on that spot, swallowing up those containers.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue frowned. Did Zu An plan to poison it? They obviously knew that the worm had been venomous to begin with. It had extremely high poison tolerance. There probably weren’t any poisons that could injure it, right?

Yu Yanluo was even more worried because she had personally seen Venom Child being chewed to death by a Scaled Deathworm. Back then, when Venom Child was on the verge of death, not even his best poisons had been able to do anything against that worm. Venom Child was extremely skilled in the use of poisons, and the worm that had bitten him was nothing more than an ordinary worm, and yet his poisons didn’t do anything. There was even less of a need to talk about the more formidable mother worm.

It was no wonder that even though the Scaled Deathworm had clearly sensed the medicine bottles, it still hadn’t avoided them at all and had just swallowed them. These drugs were probably nothing more than nourishment for it.

Just then, Zu An appeared next to the women. He grabbed their hands and ran frantically, crying, “What are you all staring for? Run!”

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen were both stunned. A slight blush appeared on their faces. Fortunately, none of them could see each other because it was pitch-black. They quickly flung aside Zu An’s hand. The two of them had already recovered a bit of cultivation. They were grandmasters, after all, so they weren’t much slower than him.

Zu An didn’t pay too much attention to that. He had been worrying about how he was going to bring Yu Yanluo with him anyway. By the time he reached her, his hands were empty, so he grabbed her and ran.

Yan Xuehen noticed that and suddenly felt a bit of regret. However, she quickly snapped out of her daze and called out, “We won’t be able to escape that deathworm’s pursuit with our current speed!”

Suddenly, however, she was stunned. She saw that the deathworm didn’t chase them, and instead began to jerk wildly back and forth in place.

Only after they reached a safe spot did all of them stop. Yan Xuehen asked, “Just what kind of poison did you feed that strange worm? Why did it look as if it had been poisoned?”

Yu Yanluo brought up what had happened with Venom Child previously as well. The three women were all curious. Unfortunately, Zu An didn’t give them any details no matter how they asked.

Eventually, even Yun Jianyue began to sound angry as she said, “Ah Zu, we’re all in the same boat here. We haven’t withheld anything from you, so why are you hiding this from us?”

For the first time, Yan Xuehen stood on the same side as her. The two had already taught him their very best techniques, and yet he still wouldn’t tell them the truth.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +100 +100 +100…

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +100 +100 +100…

Yu Yanluo spoke up for Zu An and said, “Seniors, please do not misunderstand! Ah Zu is not that type of person. There is definitely something too embarrassing for him to talk about.”

When she heard that, Yan Xuehen’s expression grew even colder. Yun Jianyue also harrumphed. “You’re the only good guy here, and the rest of us are villains?”

Yu Yanluo felt wronged too. She subconsciously trusted Zu An, so she had spoken up for fear that he would misunderstand. But in the end, these two had interpreted it as her scheming.

Seeing that the situation was getting a bit out of control, Zu An could only say, “I can tell you all, but you can’t get angry.”

“Your drug worked against that worm, so why would we get angry?” Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen asked, somewhat confused.

“Alright then,” Zu An said. “Because the things I tossed into its mouth were ‘Bull’s Cream’, ‘Eighteen Spring Winds’, ‘Worries Be Gone’...”

Yu Yanluo cried out in alarm. Her cheeks flushed red, because she had been a direct victim of Bull’s Cream! When she remembered what had happened, she wanted to crawl into a hole and hide forever.

Yan Xuehen was baffled. She asked, “What kind of drugs are those?” Considering her status and the reputation she had of being an ice queen, who would dare to bring up such drugs to her?

On the other hand, Yun Jianyue, despite being of high status, came from the Devil Sect and had heard all sorts of rumors. She harrumphed and said, “They’re all lowlife aphrodisiacs!”

“Ah?!” Yan Xuehen was stupefied. A faint layer of redness appeared on her sparkling skin.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +198 +198 +198…

Zu An became depressed when he saw her furious expression.

Yun Jianyue spoke again. “Actually, calling them ‘lowlife’ isn’t quite right; they’re all the best of the best in their field. Their effects are hundreds to thousands of times stronger than other drugs in their category… Damn kid, how do you have so much of this stuff? You really are a womanizer!”

She was actually quite glad. Previously, she had heartlessly tried to break up Zu An and Qiu Honglei. Now, that seemed to have been a good choice, or else Honglei might have suffered from his drugs.

Zu An looked extremely wronged. He protested, “I’m the victim here! There were villains who used these drugs to harm others, but then I heroically stepped forward to save their victims! These drugs were all just spoils of war obtained from those people…”

Yun Jianyue had an ambiguous smile on her lips as she remarked, “Oh, what a hero you are…”

Yan Xuehen didn’t notice her implication and only coldly said, “If you truly had no bad thoughts, why would you keep these things on you? A gentleman would have destroyed them all!”

Zu An said with a resolute expression, “Sect master is an honorable grandmaster; how can you ask such a childish question? Let me ask you: Your Snowflake Sword and the techniques used by those bad people can both take lives, so how can you decide which ones are good or evil?”

Yan Xuehen subconsciously replied, “Based on the user, obviously. Considering their different motives, you can tell whether they are good or evil.”

“Right, so ultimately, it depends on the one using it,” Zu An replied. “Drugs can be used to harm others, but they can be used to save people too.”

Yan Xuehen harrumphed. “How can filthy drugs like these be used to save people?!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zu An gave her a strange look and shot back, “Didn’t I just use them to save you?”

Yan Xuehen was left at a loss for words. She knew Zu An was engaging in sophistry, and yet she couldn't really find any words to argue against him.

Yu Yanluo asked curiously, “Ah Zu, Venom Child used all sorts of poisons against that worm, and yet none of them worked. Why did these drugs of yours work?”

“It;s probably because these items aren’t poisons, but rather magnify one’s primal desires a thousandfold,” Zu An explained with a smile. “Venom Child’s life was hanging by a thread at the time, so he naturally subconsciously chose to use poison. He wouldn’t realize that it was this kind of drug that would be incredibly effective.

“I recalled that the Scaled Deathworm was female. In that case, I thought, these drugs might be of some use. After I gave it a try, sure enough, they were effective.”

Yun Jianyue said with a sigh, “Brat, you’re pretty sharp. I thought you were done for, but you actually found this damn way out of that dire situation.”

Zu An gave her a look and said, “I’m actually really thankful to you. It was you who told me that I needed to be mentally prepared for the Star Shattering Imprint’s chance of failure. That was why I had a backup plan.”

Yun Jianyue opened her mouth, looking extremely conflicted. She had actually just said that without too much thought, but Zu An had actually really taken it to heart.

It’s no wonder that even though his cultivation wasn’t high before, he managed to escape from all sorts of dangerous situations, even becoming more and more powerful. Honglei’s eyes are quite good, but this stone cold woman’s disciple managed to act first! Ah… I’m so angry!

Several strange screams emerged from the distance, accompanied by the sounds of activity.

Zu An said, “The effects will probably wear off soon. Let’s head over and take a look. Those drugs might not last very long against its enormous body!”

The women all blushed. If it were a human, they probably wouldn’t agree to head over. But because it was a worm, there was no reason for them to refuse.

…

The group quickly followed the sounds to a massive cave. When they saw the scene before them, all of them were stupefied.

There were several smaller deathworms gathered there. They were all winding around the mother worm, seemingly giving everything they had. Several deathworms lay on the ground nearby; they were all completely still, as if they had been sucked dry.

Under the dim light, their scales reflected multicolored radiance, making the atmosphere look even stranger…
