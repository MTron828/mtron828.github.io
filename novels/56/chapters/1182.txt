Chapter 1131: Right Up to His Door

Jiang Luofu had been staring at Zu An as she spoke. She only saw that he was a bit startled at first, but then his expression calmed down. She couldn't help but feel a bit surprised, asking, “You don’t seem to be worried or scared…?”

“What’s there to be worried or scared about? Either way, I’ve already seen this kind of thing happen many times,” Zu An replied. He thought back to how Qiao Xueying was from the Elf Race, and Kong Nanwu was also a fiend race individual. He was already used to it.

Jiang Luofu thought he was just talking about Yu Yanluo, so she didn’t feel too much suspicion and continued, “Third brother chased after her, then successfully seriously injured her. But later on, by coincidence, he learned that she had never harmed anyone before and instead saved many people. Furthermore, because of the feelings he harbored, he couldn't kill her and instead let her go.

“After that battle, he developed doubts toward his own convictions. The reason why his sword had been unrivaled was precisely because of his unwavering faith. After his principle of slaying all evil was shaken, his sword was no longer as sharp anymore.”

Zu An’s expression became strange. He recalled a popular phrase from his previous world’s web: ‘Only a girl will affect my speed of unsheathing.’ He hadn’t expected that to really be the case in reality…

“At first, that wouldn’t have been too big of an issue. With third brother’s aptitude, he would be fine after spending some time to steady his mind again.” Jiang Luofu lowered her teacup and sighed, continuing, “Unfortunately, something happened afterward…

“Because of her injuries, Pei Mianman’s mother wasn’t able to protect herself. She was seriously injured while being pursued by an enemy. Even though third brother rushed over promptly, it was already too late. She was poisoned and beyond saving, passing away soon afterward.

“Third brother believes he was the reason for her death, so he’s always felt torn up inside. Furthermore, because it was the death of someone he loved, it became a two-fold blow. His mental state completely collapsed, and he sank into depravity for many years. People all thought he had already died, and only recently did he show himself again.”DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Zu An quickly asked, “Just who was it that harmed Manman’s mother?”

Jiang Luofu shook her head and replied, “That person’s origins were unclear. Furthermore, it happened so long ago. I don’t know who that person was either.”

Zu An began to think to himself. Was it the humans who were pursuing her, or was it the fiend races who wanted to eliminate her? The key issue was, why had she married Pei Shao? Pei Shao hadn’t known her identity as a Demon race person either…

“Hm?” Zu An suddenly realized something. He asked, “By the way, after she was injured, how much time passed before she gave birth to Manman? I feel as if the time doesn’t really match up somehow.”

Jiang Luofu replied, “She gave birth before she was injured, of course. She was injured by third brother not long after Manman was born.”

Zu An was stupefied.

If I’m not mistaken, didn’t Xiao Yao like Manman’s mom? She had already given birth at that point?!

He liked married women, and those who already had kids, at that?

That Xiao Yao seemed like an honest guy, but he was actually that kind of person!

But jokes were jokes. He still had to solve the problem. He said, “Even so, he clearly knows Yu Yanluo is his junior sister, and yet he still did this. Is he not scared of his past regret repeating itself?”

Jiang Luofu sighed and said, “The events of the past have always been his inner demon. He won’t back down here.”

“Then what are you going to do? You can’t just leave your junior sister to die, right?” Zu An asked. He thought, There’s no way that old fox libationer didn’t plan a single thing, right?

Jiang Luofu hesitated, then said, “I can help you, but I need you to give me something.”

Zu An was shocked. He replied, “What the heck is this? She’s your junior sister, not mine. Why does it suddenly seem as if I’m the only one who wants to save her?”

Jiang Luofu showed him a crafty smile and said, “By now, you should understand well that the master takes in disciples of all different ages and backgrounds. There are many whom even I don’t know the real identities of, let alone having met them. Yu Yanluo is precisely one of them. We’re fellow disciples, but we don’t share any real affection. Our relationship is definitely not as close as yours. I’ve been wandering around Cloudcenter Commandery these days, and I’ve heard quite the rumors about you two.”

She sounded shocked too when she said that. Yu Yanluo’s beauty had stunned the entire world for many years. Even his majesty had been one of her admirers, and yet she had never truly gotten close to anyone. Even though she had always greeted others with warm smiles, anyone with a discerning eye could tell how estranged she actually was.

Only this guy, Zu An, seemed to be closer to her. There had even started to be gossip about the two of them in the street stalls.

Even though some people had noticed that ever since the duke had come back, the married couple seemed to have grown closer, for most commoners, that was completely normal behavior between a husband and wife. It was instead a third party like Zu An that drew the most attention. Such secret adulterous relationships were the most stimulating.

Zu An’s forehead creased when he heard that. The libationer’s disciples really were each more abnormal than the next. Even Jiang Luofu was completely indifferent; no wonder Xiao Yao didn’t feel any misgivings even after finding out Yu Yanluo was his junior sister. He asked, “What do you want?”

Jiang Luofu looked at him with a cool and elegant gaze. After a while, she spoke. “The Phoenix Nirvana Sutra.”

“What?!” Zu An exclaimed. No matter how firm his will was, his expression still couldn't help but change greatly.

Jiang Luofu sighed and said, “I know you’re shocked right now. I’ll be honest with you, I’m asking this because of someone else. They want the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra from you.”

“King Qi?” Zu An asked quietly.

“Madam Qi. But that’s no different from King Qi asking for it,” Jiang Luofu said. “They know about our relationship in Brightmoon City, so they wanted to somehow get the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra from you through trickery. I’ve always been quite distressed over this matter.

“But after thinking about it, I really didn’t want to fool you, so I just decided to tell you directly. That way, regardless of what the result is, you won’t blame me too much in the future.”

Zu An couldn't help but laugh. He replied, “Big sis principal, do you know what the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra signifies? How could it be something that can be randomly stolen?”

“Of course I know that, and many people do too. Otherwise, someone like you who had obtained such a powerful cultivation in just a year or two of time, ranking up from an ordinary person that way, would’ve already been captured and locked up for research a long time ago,” Jiang Luofu said. She leaned backward, her legs changing positions again. “But the more that’s the case, the more people covet the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra. It’s only because of their fear of the emperor that King Qi alone is able to act on such thoughts.

“Ah Zu, you’re an intelligent person. You should understand that treasuring a jade ring can become a crime. I don’t know why his majesty would let you go, but with his majesty’s nature, his tolerance will soon run out.

“Rather than facing his majesty alone, you should let King Qi face him. King Qi has already schemed for many years; the only difference is his individual cultivation. If he could obtain the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, he could then fully face his majesty. At that time, they would be evenly matched, and you would become safer. Your value would also climb higher.”

Zu An asked indifferently, “Are you speaking as a mouthpiece for King Qi right now?”

Jiang Luofu shook her head and replied, “Even though the Jiang clan has always been on good terms with King Qi, we haven’t completely sided with them. Everything I am saying right now is solely from the perspective of your friend. Your situation right now is too dangerous. Whether it’s the emperor or King Qi, neither side is likely to let you go. That’s why you need to have a plan of your own.”

She continued, “You can choose to refuse me; I just need to report that to Madam Qi.” She looked worried as she said, “But if you choose to do that, King Qi will view you as a thorn in his side. You’ve caused him to lose a lot of the resources he’s accumulated over the years too. If it weren’t for this, he might have already come after you. His majesty could also find a justification to use King Qi to get rid of you, as that wouldn’t tarnish his reputation then.”

Zu An couldn't help but say with a sigh, “Big sis principal, you are the academy’s lawyer after all. You’re able to come up with all kinds of reasons one after another. Now, it almost sounds as if it’s in my best interest to hand the secret text over.”

Jiang Luofu leaned forward and said, “Regardless of whether you believe me or not, I’m considering things from your perspective. Actually, this is a mission I received a long time ago, but I’ve never done anything about it. Only recently did I realize that this was in your best interest.

“I know my request will definitely make you feel extremely disappointed… Forget it, I’ll just refuse her. However, you really need to be careful. Whether it’s his majesty or King Qi, neither side is a kind sort. They’ll act against you soon.” She got up to leave after speaking. However, Zu An grabbed her and stopped her from leaving.

Jiang Luofu turned around. When she saw Zu An grabbing her arm, she was a bit confused.

However, Zu An said calmly, “Why are you in such a rush to leave? I didn’t even say I wouldn’t agree.” He took out a book and handed it to her, saying, “This is what you’re looking for.”

Jiang Luofu was shocked. She replied, “You actually agree to it?”

She hadn’t had high hopes for the idea to begin with. Even though she had indeed been considering things for Zu An’s sake, she knew that such an exceptional secret manual was something no one would be willing to give up.

Zu An smiled. “If it were anyone else, no matter how reasonable and fair their words, I would still only spit in their face. But big sis principal is different. As long as you want it, I’ll give it all.”

He had been wondering just how he was going to give the fake Phoenix Nirvana Sutra to King Qi. And yet now, a solution had come right up to his door!

Jiang Luofu was stunned at first. Her expression that had remained serious and ice-cold for so long because of her role as the academy principal now turned visibly red.
