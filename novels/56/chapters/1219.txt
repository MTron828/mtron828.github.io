Chapter 1168: Investing a Lot

Zu An felt moved as he looked at Yun Jianyue and exclaimed, “Big sis sect master, so you fought against her because you thought I had died!”

Yan Xuehen felt sore inside. She must have become a villain in his eyes. But she quickly realized that there was something wrong with her mood, and only felt more and more vexed.

Yun Jianyue cleared her throat and said, “You don’t have to be too thankful. You are Honglei’s… good friend, after all. Even I owe you, so how could I just watch without doing anything?” She suddenly realized something and said, “How about this? If you’re grateful to me, then just accept me as your master.”

Zu An and Yu Yanluo were speechless. Zu An thought, Why is another woman wanting to take me as a disciple? Am I a hot commodity or something?

Yan Xuehen began to panic. She exclaimed, “Demoness, you are shameless! I was clearly the one who decided on that first!”

“He didn’t even agree to join you,” Yun Jianyue remarked, rolling her eyes. She said to Zu An, “If you make me your master, you’ll be Honglei’s junior brother. It’ll be easier for you two to be around each other.

“Furthermore, in our Holy Sect, Honglei is the saintess. But as a preventive measure, we actually have many saintess candidates, and all of them are stunning beauties. If you like any of them, you can take them as your companion and do whatever you like.”

Zu An and Yu Yanluo were speechless once again.

Fortunately, Yan Xuehen was the first one to blurt out, “Miss Yun, do you even have any sense of shame left? Are you looking for a disciple, or are you… Are you…” She was too embarrassed to even finish her sentence.

Yun Jianyue gave her an indifferent look and said, “Considering Zu An’s aptitude, strength, appearance, and his status as my disciple, those saintess candidates would be fighting for the chance to become his companion. What would there be to feel unhappy about?”

Yan Xuehen was really getting annoyed. She shot back, “That really is something only the Devil Sect would do. Utterly shameless!”

Yun Jianyue said coldly, “The way our Holy Sect does things is actually practical and realistic. You clearly want to take him in as a disciple, and yet you’re acting like a petulant child. How fake!”

“You!” Yan Xuehen didn’t know how to retort. She definitely wouldn’t be able to make a similar offer. Forget about the fact that she had never intended anything like that; even if she did, the others in the sect wouldn’t agree. That would shake the very principles of the White Jade Sect.

She took a deep breath and looked at Zu An, asking, “What do you think?” She figured that even though this man was a bit perverted, he already had so many beauties at his side. Furthermore, he actually had a bit of a chivalrous side to him deep down. Yun Jianyue’s temptation might not necessarily work.

Zu An thought to himself, Do you even need to ask? Of course big sis sect master’s offer shows more sincerity.

He was just about to speak, but when he saw her expression that was as clear as water and full of expectations, he changed his wording just as the response left his lips. “Only a child would answer that multiple-choice question. A mature person would obviously… want it all!”

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were speechless.

Zu An coughed and said, “The two of you are both extraordinary legends. If I could take both of you on as my masters, I would definitely be able to learn even more formidable things.” As for Master Empress, he’d just coax her a bit afterward. She probably wouldn’t mind letting a few more little sisters teach him.

Yun Jianyue was so annoyed she laughed, saying, “Kid, your appetite is surprisingly big, hm? If it were anyone else, I would already have smacked them to death. But you are quite something. I like this domineering side of yours.”

Even though Yan Xuehen wasn’t happy to hear that, she didn’t refuse it either. Her own conditions were far inferior to Yun Jianyue’s, and yet the other party still wanted to take her as his master. Didn’t that mean that to some extent, she had actually won against Yun Jianyue?

Yu Yanluo couldn't keep watching the scene. She said, “Ahem, everyone. Isn’t the more important matter now how to deal with that Scaled Deathworm?”

The two women’s eyes were practically turning green from greed. Where had their grandmaster attitudes gone? It was as if they were trying to fight over a man or something! Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue immediately realized how they were acting and felt somewhat embarrassed.

Zu An said, “Actually, I had a chance to kill it, but it noticed me ahead of time…” Then, he gave them a rough recount of what had just happened.

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen were both shocked, exclaiming, “You ran into that worm again?” They looked at each other when they realized they had blurted out the same thing.

Yan Xuehen quickly asked, “Just what kind of skill was that, if it allowed you to avoid its spiritual senses?”

“Exactly! Why did I not know that you had such a formidable skill?” Yun Jianyue also expressed her disbelief.

After all, even the two of them wouldn’t have been confident in their ability to escape its perception even when they were at their strongest. Just how had Zu An done it?𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s a new skill.” Zu An chuckled in embarrassment. “I can hide myself in absolute darkness, but as soon as there’s a bit of light, or if I attack, it’ll lose its effectiveness.”

They had to work together to defeat the terrifying monster in the future, so he didn’t hide such a crucial piece of information. Otherwise, the consequences might be really terrible if there were any slip-ups.

Yan Xuehen’s expression became a bit conflicted. Previously, she had realized that Zu An and Yan Jianyue had already known each other for a long time, and that their relationship was special. Otherwise, Yun Jianyue wouldn’t have gone crazy when she heard that I had killed Zu An.

I was trying to kill him not too long ago, and yet he’s actually telling me the flaws of this skill so easily. He is a true gentleman after all…

She couldn't help but ask, “Did you plan on using that pitch-black dagger, then?”

Zu An hesitated. He took out the Poisonous Prick and said, “Indeed. This thing has something similar to a curse. Once injured by it, the target will immediately lose their life.”

“There’s something so magical in this world?” Yun Jianyue exclaimed in incredible shock. “This thing might be deity-grade! Brat, how do you have so many secrets?”

Yan Xuehen was also extremely moved. With her and Yun Jianyue’s status, they had seen all sorts of deity-grade weapons. However, it was the first time she had seen one like this. Even they were a bit tempted. She said with a serious expression, “Don’t tell anyone about this item in the future. Possessing a treasure will arouse the envy of others; you might incite the jealousy of the powerful in this world.”

Yu Yanluo had been about to say that herself. When she heard Yan Xuehen say it, she sighed in relief.

Zu An chuckled and replied, “You aren’t outsiders, and we’re stuck in the same boat right now. I can’t hide such important information from you.”

Not outsiders… Yan Xuehen’s heart skipped a beat. Her expression was also a bit unnatural; she wasn’t willing to look into his eyes again.

“With this thing, there’s indeed a chance to kill that worm,” Yun Jianyue said. “But at the grandmaster level, we become extremely sensitive to killing intent. That worm isn’t any weaker than me or this stone cold woman. Between that and its animal instincts, it can only be even more sensitive than us. It can hide underground at any time. So even if you lurk beside it, once you decide to attack, your stealth will disappear, and it’ll sense your killing intent. It could easily kill you instead.”

“I have a solution to that,” Yan Xuehen said. “I’ll pass the ‘Unshaken Daoist Manual’ onto you. It can help you restrain your killing intent. As long as you attack while you’re close enough, it shouldn’t be able to sense anything.”

Yun Jianyue asked in surprise, “You’re even teaching him something like that?”

Yan Xuehen said indifferently, “This matter is related to the safety of the human race. He is risking his life for the people, so how can I cling onto a trifling technique? Furthermore, he was already willing to take me on as his master, so it would not go against the rules for me to teach him this.”

Yun Jianyue sighed and said, “Look at you. Normally, you’re all rigid and inflexible, a bit temperamental, and kind of annoying too… but today, I’m even feeling a bit of admiration for you.”

Yan Xuehen’s eyes twitched when she heard the string of adjectives. She shot back, “I suppose I should be thankful for that?”

Yu Yanluo said through ki, “Ah Zu, you’re really fortunate! The ‘Unshaken Daoist Manual’ is White Jade Sect’s supreme treasure text. Yan Xuehen relied on that art to reach the level she has today.” She felt a strong sense of danger when she said that. These women really were going all out for Ah Zu!

But Zu An instead sounded a bit hesitant as he replied, “Um… I’m just a normal person; I like to experience feelings of love. Will I lose my emotions if I learn your technique and become a daoist, heartless and emotionless? If that’s true, I don’t want to learn it…”

Yun Jianyue’s body rocked back and forth with laughter when she heard that. She remarked, “Stone cold woman, I didn’t expect you would even go through something like this today!”

Yan Xuehen was speechless.
