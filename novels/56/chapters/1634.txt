Chapter 1583: Coroner

Normally, that should have been impossible. Not even a master rank cultivator could travel back and forth over such a long distance in a single night. However, Zu An was different. He had the Wind Fire Wheels to help him, which was practically like a private jet from his previous world… No, the Wind Fire Wheels were even faster than a private jet.

After Zu An made sure all the military affairs of the camp were in place, he warned everyone else not to disturb him in the evening.

After his achievements during the day, his prestige in the army had skyrocketed. The soldiers were all in admiration of him. No wonder General Zu was so formidable; he cultivated so bitterly even at night. They all vowed inwardly not to disturb him.

Just in case, Zu An left Daji behind, dressed in his clothes. Meanwhile, he secretly snuck out. When he found a secluded area, he flew into the sky. After reaching a certain distance away, he took out the Wind Fire Wheels and rushed toward Yi Commandery.

They were close to ten thousand kilometers away from Yi Commandery, so Zu An didn’t dare to waste any time and used the Wind Fire Wheels at full output. As he rushed through the sky, he resembled a shooting star. Once he broke through the sound barrier, the air around him became as viscous as water. It was only because of his body’s current toughness that he was able to endure the powerful winds. An ordinary cultivator would likely have melted on the spot.

…

After flying all night, Zu An finally reached Yi Commandery City in the middle of the night. Even with his current cultivation, he was still a bit exhausted.

He quickly found an opportunity to land. These cities usually had defensive formations, but they weren’t that effective against master rank and higher cultivators. Of course, as long as a large-scale enemy force didn’t invade, how could a few grandmasters be a threat to such a massive city?

He had passed by Yi Commandery once before on his way to Cloudcenter Commandery, so navigating around wasn’t difficult at all. He looked around the city and finally found the secret signal Xiao Jianren had left behind. Fortunately, it was already the dead of night, which saved him a lot of difficulty.

He followed the source of the signal and eventually reached a remote courtyard. He searched around with his divine sense and didn’t notice anything strange. Thus, he silently climbed the wall and went inside.

He saw some candles flickering in the distance, accompanied by some dancing human shadows. He was stunned. Why weren’t they asleep yet even though it was already so late at night? He felt rather gratified, as Xiao Jianren was still pretty reliable and was no doubt still investigating the case. Once they went back, Zu An planned to make a report to apply for his promotion.

He was about to head in and offer praise when he suddenly heard Xiao Jianren’s voice. “Miss Zhang, next time you come to the capital, I’ll take you around the overhead walkway. That’s the most lively place in the capital, a feeling that’s completely different from Yi Commandery’s.”

“What are you saying, Sir Xiao? If we’re going to the capital, we definitely have to taste the capital’s delicious food! They sell roast duck wrapped in a flour bun dipped in a special sauce. That’s the real deal,” came a rather lowly voice from off to the side; it was Dai Seventh.

“Stuff like that roast duck is just for duping foreigners. If we’re going to talk about the capital’s food, of course it’s the charcoal fire pot that’s really good, especially the mutton hot pot we enjoy during the winter. That’s what really hits the spot,” Chen Eighth chimed in.

Zu An was confused. Who was this Lady Zhang they were talking about? Why did their words sound so much like simping? 

When he snuck a look, he saw that his three subordinates were currently surrounding a tall and gorgeous woman and trying to woo her. The woman had a tall ponytail and was dressed in tight clothing. Her appearance was neat and tidy, and yet she also had a strong and vigorous air about her. The two perfectly proportioned legs beneath her leather armor, in particular, made one feel that if one could be clasped between them, perhaps the feeling would take them straight to heaven.

The woman’s face was beautiful to begin with, and together with her shocking long legs and the heroic air about her appearance, it added even more charm. It was no wonder the three grown men were completely infatuated with her. However, Zu An had sent them here to investigate a case; why were they actually flirting with a woman?

The woman with the tall ponytail seemed a bit uninterested in their enthusiastic wooing. She said, “The reason for my visit is to discuss Sir Seven’s case with all of you.”

Xiao Jianren laughed and replied, “Work and life need balance, right? Miss Zhang, you’re a bit too tense. You might be able to develop a new sense of spirituality if you relax a bit.”

Zu An was a bit speechless. The usually wooden and inarticulate Xiao Jianren was actually so good at conversation all of a sudden? Zu An hadn’t expected him to actually have this kind of taste.

The ponytailed woman frowned. She was about to say something, but she suddenly sensed something. She suddenly turned toward the entrance and cried, “Show yourself!”

Xiao Jianren and the others were stunned and all turned around. However, when they saw Zu An’s figure, their expressions changed greatly. Their smiles faded as they said, “We greet Sir Eleven!”

Zu An said coldly, “All of you really are working hard, still investigating the case so late into the evening.”

How could Xiao Jianren and the others not hear the mockery in his voice? They felt guilty and didn’t dare to retort. Meanwhile, when the ponytailed woman heard that it was Golden Token Eleven, she sized him up curiously.

After all, there had only been ten Golden Token Envoys for a long time. Every single one of them had been assigned to oversee one area, and they were all influential and critical individuals. And yet, in recent years, a Golden Token Eleven had suddenly appeared. The different rumors she had heard all made that person seem extremely mysterious. It was hard to say what that person’s real cultivation rank was.

However, the woman had believed that as he could become one of the Golden Token Envoys, just like her adoptive father, he likely wouldn’t be too weak. And yet, now that they’d met, only two words appeared in her mind: That’s it?

Even though this person looked pretty well-built, she didn’t sense the slightest ki aura from him, and he even seemed to be a bit out of breath. He looked just like a normal person! Could it be that his majesty had ended up just promoting someone randomly from his family? Or had this person relied entirely on his brain and taken the path of intellect?

As he was a Golden Token Envoy, then he definitely had his secrets, so she didn’t dare to look down on him and also greeted him. “Golden Token Seven’s subordinate, Zhang Zitong, greets Sir Eleven!”

Zu An was stunned. This woman was actually Golden Token Seven’s subordinate! She looked like a capable individual. He only had people like the middle-aged Xiao Jianren who had already been stuck at his rank for a long time, while Golden Token Seven had actually found a long-legged hottie. Had he been looking for a subordinate or a freaking secretary?𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He had often heard the phrase ‘if you have something to do, let the secretary do it; if there’s nothing to do, then do her…’ He subconsciously began to suspect the woman’s relationship with Golden Token Seven, and he even wondered whether Golden Token Seven’s death had anything to do with her.

Zhang Zitong was already used to similar looks after so many years, but she still felt rather angry inside. 

This guy was staring at my legs right from the get-go, and there’s still a bit of a wretched look in his eyes! No wonder Xiao Jianren and the others are like that. If the upper beam isn’t straight, the lower beam will be crooked!

You have successfully trolled Zhang Zitong for +250 +250 +250…

Zu An was stunned when he noticed the Rage points coming in, but he could roughly guess why she was angry. Even so, he didn’t really take it seriously and just nodded toward her. He turned to Xiao Jianren and said, “I sent you here ahead of time to investigate. Did you obtain any useful information?”

“I did, I did…” Xiao Jianren said guiltily, then took out a file and handed it to him. It was a summary of the most recent discoveries.

Zu An scanned the contents. His expression darkened as he said, “There’s not much to see here. This is all you’ve found after being here for so long?”

Xiao Jianren replied, “Sir Eleven’s criticism is well deserved. But this matter really does seem purely like a freak accident. I really couldn't find any holes in their report.”

Zu An frowned and said, “Then call over the coroner who autopsied Sir Seven’s corpse. I want to personally ask him some things.”

Zhang Zitong spoke up just then, saying, “I was the one who carried out the autopsy on Sir Seven.”

“You?” Zu An replied, stunned. Even though this woman was outstanding, he hadn’t expected her to be a forensic investigator at all.

“Can a coroner not be female?” Zhang Zitong replied, raising her head to look straight at him. “I vow with my reputation and my life on the line that there were absolutely no mistakes in my autopsy report. Even though Sir Seven was my superior, he treated me extremely well. He took me in when I was wandering the streets when I was a child. In my heart, I already considered him my real father. I wish for his killer to be discovered more than anyone else here!”
