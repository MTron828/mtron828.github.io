Chapter 100: What Do You Mean By That?

Translator: Pika

Shi Kun choked. Despite his careful maneuvers, he had still fallen into Zu An’s trap.

If he said that he’d failed to find Chu Chuyan, he would be admitting to being incompetent. If he said that he did, that would mean that he had indeed concocted a deliberate ploy to feign a coincidental meeting with her. Neither outcome was acceptable to him.

Fortunately, someone stepped forward to cover his awkwardness—Yuan Wendong. “Zu An, it looks like the time you spent loitering in the streets has taught you how to bandy words with others. Who do you think young master Shi is? A gentleman like him doesn’t get into arguments with others, so it’s only natural that he’s at a disadvantage in your sort of exchange. In any case, how could young master Shi possibly be incompetent?

“Not one person hasn’t heard of young master Shi’s talents. He’s a prodigy in cultivation, and it’s said that he’s already on the verge of reaching the sixth rank, despite his young age. On the other hand, what are you good at? Mooching off women? Bickering like a common street urchin?”

Shi Kun’s entourage immediately burst into laughter. They were making use of this opportunity to help him vent his anger.

Zu An tilted his head to observe Yuan Wendong. He asked him, “You must be very fond of bones, yes?”

Yuan Wendong had expected Zu An to fly into an ugly state of rage, and was caught off-guard by such a nonchalant response. Without thinking, he said, “No, I’m not.”

A young master of a wealthy clan like him had no lack of delicacies on his table. Why would he bother chewing bones?

“If that’s the case, why do you keep wagging your tail before Shi Kun as if you’re begging him for a reward?” replied Zu An contemptuously. “We had our differences the last time we met, but your guts were still respectable. Where did your pride and your honor go? Even I am starting to feel embarrassed on your behalf!”

“You are really...” Yuan Wendong’s face reddened in anger. Zu An had unexpectedly laid a trap for him, and he had foolishly jumped into it on his own accord!

You have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for 888 Rage points!

Most importantly, what Zu An said wasn’t wrong. He used to be the star of the academy, and had countless followers fawning in his wake. He wasn’t used to his new role, but there was no helping it, since the Shi clan was simply too important. He had no choice but to set his discomfort aside, and do his best to please Shi Kun.

Having Zu An point it out in public was like a tight slap in his face. It left him feeling so humiliated, he would have dived right into a hole if there had been one in front of him.

“Brother Yuan, please do not mind him. This fellow knows nothing but how to engage in meaningless bickering. You mustn’t lower yourself to his level,” Shi Kun consoled him.

Yuan Wendong gave Shi Kun a grateful glance for giving him a way out. He gritted his teeth tightly to snap him out of his daze, and glared angrily at Zu An. “Young master Shi is right! You only know how to engage in meaningless squabbling! This is the world of cultivation. If you’re that capable, why don’t you duel with me? I’ll beat you up so badly, even your mother wouldn’t be able to recognize you anymore!”

Zu An immediately retreated behind Chu Chuyan. “Honey, that fellow dared to threaten me. Beat him up!”

Chu Chuyan felt a headache setting in. I really chose the wrong husband. This fellow sure knows how to stir up trouble.

However, with the purpose of the confrontation firmly in mind, she played along. “Yuan Wendong, no matter what, Zu An is still the son-in-law of our Chu clan. I can’t allow outsiders to take advantage of him. If you want to challenge him, you have to get past me first.”

As Chu Chuyan took a step forward, Yuan Wendong subconsciously took a step back. If I had the ability to defeat you, do you think I would bother to bend over backwards for Shi Kun?

Of course, there was no way he dared to vent his rage at Chu Chuyan, so he kept his eyes fixed firmly on Zu An and said, “Zu wastrel, how can you call yourself a man, when you hide behind a woman’s back every time something happens?”

Just thinking of how comprehensively he had been defeated by Pei Mianman the previous time was enough to make his face turn ominously dark.

Zu An shrugged in response. “If I, who managed to get so many beautiful and powerful women on my side, cannot be considered a man, what does that make someone who couldn’t even find a single woman like you?”

“I...” Yuan Wendong was at a loss for words. Why the hell am I feeling so cornered?!

You have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for 642 Rage points!

Just then, Shi Kun muttered something, and Yuan Wendong’s eyes lit up. A gleeful smile crept into his eyes as he replied, “Gloat all you want now. You might be able to hide behind a woman for now, but let’s see what you can do at tomorrow’s Clans Tournament!”

Zu An sighed deeply. “It looks like you’re a sucker for pain, huh? You really want to have the living daylights beaten out of you. Oh well, forget it, it’s time to drop the act. I’ll show you my true prowess at tomorrow’s Clans Tournament. Just try to hold back your tears then, all right?”

“Your true prowess?” Yuan Wendong cackled wildly, his spine arching backward. “Very well, I’d love to see young master Zu’s incredible strength tomorrow! Hahahahaha!”

Shi Kun wore a satisfied smile as well. According to Snow’s testimony, Zu An was only a third rank cultivator. No matter how powerful he was, there was no way he could defeat a fifth rank cultivator like Yuan Wendong.

Of course, in order to prevent any mishaps, he would make sure to inform Yuan Wendong about Zu An’s true strength.

“I can even tell you right now that I’ll be the last one up as the Chu clan’s secret weapon. I hope that you won’t back out at the last moment!” said Zu An.

Yuan Wendong laughed. “Rest assured, I’ll show you the true meaning of despair!”

The Chu clan’s intentions were clear as day. They were most likely putting Zu An’s match at the very end in order to protect him. By then, if victory had already been decided, there would be no need for him to fight anymore. Hmph, did you think that our Yuan clan is still the same as before? Be prepared for the shock of your life!

Zu An was really making a big show of everything right now. Yuan Wendong could scarcely contain his excitement as he imagined just how ridiculous that wastrel would look when he was forced into the dueling ring the next day.

This idiot!

This was Yuan Wendong’s evaluation of Zu An.

Seeing that their goal had been achieved, Chu Chuyan quickly pulled Zu An away from the scene. Shi Kun stiffened as he witnessed that.

The relationship between Chu Chuyan and Zu An doesn’t seem as stale as Snow put it out to be. Could they have gotten closer to one another during this period of time?

Feeling as if he had been cuckolded, Shi Kun felt rage boiling in his blood.

You have successfully trolled Shi Kun for 222 Rage points!

Zu An was in no mood to care about the Rage points he was receiving. He was focused on Chu Chuyan’s hand, which was cool, soft, and smooth to the touch. He was pleased that the latter had taken the initiative to grab his hand this time around.

However, as soon as they were away from the crowd, Chu Chuyan released her grip and said, “You did well earlier. You managed to stir up his rage. It’s very likely that he would choose you tomorrow.”

Zu An was also pleased with his performance. “I’m pretty confident in my ability to infuriate others, after all.”

“Yes, I can tell.” Thinking about how Snow was often left fuming in his wake, a smile slowly spread across Chu Chuyan’s face.

Chu Huanzhao did not share their confidence. “Big sister, what if Zu An really finds himself in a position where he needs to fight Yuan Wendong? Yuan Wendong is a fifth rank cultivator, and he hates Zu An with a passion now. It’s almost certain that he would take advantage of the duel to hurt Zu An!”

Chu Chuyan tried to allay her fears. “Based on our arrangements, the tournament should be decided in the first few rounds. Rest assured, Zu An wouldn’t have to fight at all.”

“But what if things go wrong?” Chu Huanzhao insisted anxiously.

“If things don’t go according to plan, Zu An should just admit defeat right away. Besides, my father and I will be there to observe. We won’t allow anything to happen to him,” replied Chu Chuyan.

Chu Huanzhao frowned. “Still, Zu An has already challenged Yuan Wendong publicly. If he admits defeat right away on the dueling ring, how could he face anyone else in the future?”

“Is his dignity or his life more important?” asked Chu Chuyan. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After saying those words, she turned to Zu An and said, “I must give you fair warning. I recognize that you have a tendency to provoke others. You have been able to remain safe thus far mostly due to luck, but your luck will eventually run out. You really should try to change your behavior. You might end up regretting it if you offend someone you shouldn’t.”

“Rest assured, I only offend the people I can afford to offend,” replied Zu An. If I don’t offend others, how do I get my Rage points? Besides, it’s not like I indiscriminately anger everyone around me. I’d never offend someone I know I can’t afford to.

To date, Zu An had never tried to earn Old Mi or Ji Dengtu’s Rage points, and for good reason. While it looked like he had been living recklessly so far, in truth, it was all a calculated risk.

Of course, once my little Zu An is released, I’ll find an opportunity to get even with Ji Dengtu. Hmph!

Chu Chuyan misunderstood his meaning. She thought that he was disregarding her kind advice, and she let out a resigned sigh. It seems like there’s no persuading him.

“I’ll head to my classroom. We’ll meet after school.” With that, Chu Chuyan walked away with a heavy heart.

Once she was gone, Chu Huanzhao heaved a deep sigh of relief. “Oof, I feel so stifled I’m about to burst! There were so many times that I nearly succumbed and told her about it!”

Zu An looked at Chu Huanzhao curiously. “Is it really a good idea for you to team up with me to fool your big sister?”

“It’s more interesting this way, isn’t it? Mwahahaha!” Chu Huanzhao let out a villainous cackle. “She even said that she’d meet you after school. I wonder how she would react when she sees you in the classroom.”

“Now I’m quite curious to know too.” Zu An was hyped up by Chu Huanzhao’s remarks. “What do you think I should say when I meet her in the classroom later on, to make the scene even more dramatic?”

“Isn’t speech and drama your specialty? Why are you asking me instead?” Chu Huanzhao scoffed. “Just look at what happened with Yuan Wendong and Ye Chenliang! I reckon that there’s no one better than you at teasing others!”

“Awww, you’re flattering me. I’m usually quite honest, y’know.” Zu An was starting to feel a bit embarrassed by her compliments.

“Honest?” Chu Huanzhao looked at him with an enigmatic smile on her lips. “Did you think that I’ve never caught you eyeing my legs from time to time? Confess! You’ve actually thought of taking both of us sisters to be your wives before, haven’t you?”

“No no, definitely not!” Zu An was shocked by the thought. Isn’t Chu Huanzhao being a little too forward, asking such a question directly?

“Tsk! You think I don’t know what you men are always thinking about?” Chu Huanzhao sniffed disdainfully at him. “You’d better not let my mother or my big sister know that you’re harboring such thoughts. They’ll take turns to skin you alive!”

After saying those words, she skipped off toward her classroom, leaving a dumbfounded Zu An in her wake.

Wait a moment, what does she even mean by those words?
