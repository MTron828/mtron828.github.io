Chapter 1784: Wife of the Immortal Ruler

Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman both tumbled down the hill. Normally, they both had extraordinary movement skills and definitely wouldn’t fall down such a hill, but they were no match for the Glare of Eternal Slumber. Even their souls felt a tremendous sense of fatigue, and they could no longer control their bodies normally, which was why they fell.

Still, the forceful movement allowed them both to retain a bit of clearheadedness and not immediately fall asleep. After all, falling was the best way to wake up a drowsy person. The two of them couldn't really control their bodies, so they just instinctively hugged each other and used their backs to deal with the rubble and tree branches. Their bodies were soon covered in wounds, but the sharp pain was enough to keep them awake.

After tumbling for who knew how long, the two smashed into a cliffside that held a giant boulder. The two of them braced for impact. With their momentum, if they smashed straight into it, the impact would be enough to make a normal person explode into pieces on the spot. Only cultivators such as them whose bodies were extremely tough and flexible wouldn’t die. However, their wounds definitely wouldn’t be light.

However, who would have thought that right as they were about to crash into it, several profound runes suddenly flickered across the cliffside? A second later, after they crashed into it, the giant boulder rolled inside. A gentle force wrapped around the two of them, neutralizing the tremendous momentum.

The two women looked at each other in dismay. Suddenly, their faces reddened. They discovered that they were still clinging tightly to each other. They could even clearly feel the air the other exhaled. They quickly pushed each other away, staggering to their feet.

“What kind of place is this?” Chu Chuyan muttered absent-mindedly. Inwardly, she thought, No wonder Ah Zu always called her Big Manman. She really is very, very big…

Pei Mianman felt a bit awkward too. She had never been so intimate with another woman before either. When she heard that, she raised her head and looked around before replying, “I don’t know. It seems to be a cave.”

Inside the cave, they could even see simple stone tables and chairs, as if someone had lived there before. But everything was too simple, as if the inhabitant had been carrying out the ascetic practice of a monk. The cave wasn’t that large, and they could see all the way to the very end of it. In the very depths, there was a sculpture of a woman carved out of the wall. In front of the sculpture was a tattered praying mat that the previous owner of this place had evidently used for meditation. Unfortunately, because of the sheer amount of time that had passed, it was already somewhat rotted.

The two women reflexively walked up to the sculpture. They were about to observe the woman’s face when they both frowned. They nervously said to each other, “This is bad. I can feel that drowsiness again.”

They could see the severity of the situation in each other’s eyes. With their cultivation, they wouldn’t feel tired even if they didn’t sleep for several days. Their current condition was clearly strange.

“It’s probably because of those two streaks of light,” Chu Chuyan said, thinking back to what had happened. She looked behind her and continued, “It seems to be a power that can put someone to sleep.”

“But we don’t know how long we’ll sleep. If it’s just a few days, we might be able to wait it out here,” Pei Mianman said with a frown.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This cave was hidden quite well, so they didn’t have to be scared of anything dangerous happening while they were asleep. However, both of them knew very well that there was no way the powerful Ghost King would only make them sleep for a few days. If they slept for a few months, they could hold on with their cultivation, but if they had to sleep for a few years, the energy inside their bodies wouldn’t be enough to keep them alive. Furthermore, the Ghost King’s skill could make them sleep for even longer. It could even be endless.

The two women didn’t dare to fall asleep. They both agreed to take out their weapons and stab their own thighs. The intense pain temporarily drove away the endless drowsiness.

“What do we do?” Pei Mianman asked. She couldn't figure out a solution even after thinking through all of the daoist sects’ methods.

Both of them could see the despair in each other’s eyes. If they slept outside, with their extraordinary appearance, it was easy to imagine what would happen once they were left completely powerless. But if they slept here, there was no way Ah Zu would be able to find them. They could end up asleep forever in this darkness.

“It’s all my fault that you’re in this situation,” Chu Chuyan said apologetically. If not for her, Pei Mianman wouldn’t have fallen into such a desperate situation.

“We’re best friends. You would have saved me too,” Pei Mianman said with a sigh. She also knew that there was no solution. “I really never expected that even though our personalities are completely different, we would end up liking the same man.”

“Indeed, the ways of the world are truly unpredictable,” Chu Chuyan said with a sigh. The two of them had been competing against each other to an extent, and yet in the end, it was all for naught.

“The fact that those other vixens are having it easy annoys me so much! I would have just given that guy to you,” Pei Mianman said dejectedly. She knew that Zu An had a lot of beauties at his side. Now that the two of them were backing out, they were letting the others win way too easily.

“Exactly. If I knew, I would have just let you have him too,” Chu Chuyan said with a sigh. They exchanged a look and laughed. They felt as if they had returned to the time when they were really close.

Suddenly, Pei Mianman said, “There is one matter that I wonder if you know about. Your master…”

She suddenly stopped midway through her sentence. Previously, she had seen Yan Xuehen and Zu An share an intimate scene. But she could end up hurting Chu Chuyan if she talked about it. After all, Chuyan’s master was the one who had stolen her man, which really couldn’t be particularly pleasant to discover. If she finished her sentence, it would also feel as if she were talking behind their backs to drive a wedge between them. As such, she hesitated.

“What happened to my master?” Chu Chuyan mumbled, struggling to open her weary eyes and looking at Pei Mianman in confusion.

Pei Mianman thought, We’re both about to die anyway, so who cares anymore. At least Chu Chuyan will know the truth, that Ah Zu doesn’t only have those pretty and flirtatious beauties, but also some unimaginable people.

“Your master and Ah Zu…” she began.

Halfway through her sentence, however, a streak of light appeared from the sculpture beside them. A female figure slowly rose from the surface. The two then saw that the figure was identical to the stone sculpture. She had a dignified and peaceful expression, and her gaze seemed to carry a sense of pity for all life.

“Whose blood was it that has awakened me?”

The two women looked down. They discovered that because they had stabbed their weapons into their thighs to fight against the drowsiness, blood had continued to flow along the ground. Meanwhile, there was a slight slope from the floor to the wall, so the blood had flowed toward the foot of the stone sculpture.

The two women were stunned and reflexively asked, “This senior is…?”

“The people of the world refer to me as Baogu. This is but a strand of divine will that I have left behind. The blood the two of you have seems to be quite special and has woken me up,” the figure replied. She almost seemed to be waiting for them to sigh in amazement.

However, the two women were completely puzzled. They weren’t people of this world and had never heard such a name before. They had heard of ‘xingbaogu’ (king oyster mushrooms), but they were scared they would offend her by saying that out loud.

The figure clearly froze for a moment. She could only ask, “Then have you heard of Immortal Ruler Baopu?”

The two women nodded and replied, “We have.”

‘Immortal Ruler Baopu’ was a name known by practically everyone. After all, he was the only one who had been able to ascend to immortality in the past thousand years.

The figure’s expression evidently became a bit unhappy. She then said, “He is my husband.”

The two women’s faces were covered in question marks. They asked, “The Immortal Ruler had a wife?”

The figure said impatiently, “It’s not as if he ascended to immortality from birth. Of course he had a wife.”

“So you were Immortal Ruler Baopu’s wife? We greet senior,” the two said, bowing again. The wife of an immortal could already be considered a legendary being.

“Do you think I wanted him to become an immortal?” the woman remarked unhappily, especially when she thought about how they only recognized her because of her husband. She was feeling irritated and was about to storm off when she noticed their condition, saying, “Hm? The two of you seem to be wounded.”

The two women said with a bitter smile, “Our wounds are a small matter. We were struck by a strange light from the Ghost King that made us feel extremely tired. The only reason we can even remain awake is because of our last bit of willpower. We might fall asleep at any moment.”

The two exchanged a look and saw a sliver of hope in each other’s eyes. After all, even though this was merely a remnant will, when she was alive, she had been the wife of an immortal! There could be an opportunity for them to be saved.

“Ghost King?” the figure repeated with a frown; it was impossible to tell whether it was because she had never heard of the Ghost King or because she had thought of something. She continued, “From the looks of your condition, you seem to have been afflicted by a powerful skill of the Yin Yang Realm, the Glare of Eternal Slumber. Those struck by the skill forever fall asleep and never awaken, all the way until they become nothing but bones.”

Pei Mianman and Chu Chuyan were both crestfallen. It was the worst possible situation, as expected.

“May I ask if senior has a way of helping us?” Pei Mianman quickly asked. A sliver of hope appeared in Chu Chuyan’s eyes as well.

The woman shook her head and replied, “If you had come to me in the past, then I would have a solution. However, I am nothing more than a strand of will and do not have much power. There is nothing I can do to help in your current situation.”

The two women immediately sank into despair when they heard that.

“Pitiful, lamentable,” the woman muttered, shaking her head and preparing to leave.

When they saw that she was walking out of the cave, Chu Chuyan suddenly asked, “Senior can leave this place?”

The woman nodded and replied, “That’s right. I can sense that the great tomb is opening once more. There are some unresolved ashes of fate that need to be resolved at last.”

Upon hearing that the woman seemed to be heading to the great tomb, Chu Chuyan was surprised. She asked, “Could we entrust senior with something?”
