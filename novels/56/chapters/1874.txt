Chapter 1823: To Steal a Chicken Only to Lose the Rice

Zu An tried to store the Violet-Gold Alms in his Brilliant Glass Bead, but it didn’t work even after trying several times, which meant it was probably an item that had an owner. It clearly had that old monk’s imprint, so he couldn't store it away. As such, he tossed it into his inner pocket and ran.

The old monk was completely stunned now. He hadn’t expected Zu An to run away, because he had already said he would pass his entire inheritance on. In that case, that alms bowl would be Zu An’s anyway, so why would he run?

After watching for a while, however, he saw that Zu An had no sign of stopping. Only then did he quickly shout, “What are you doing?!”

“Do you think you can get away with my treasure?” the monk called out with a sneer. He started to chant an incantation.

Zu An’s chest suddenly shone brilliantly. The Violet-Gold Alms flew out of his clothes and started vibrating all over, as if it would soon fly away. However, Zu An quickly reached out and grabbed it. In that instant, he found himself in a deadlocked state with the alms bowl. It couldn't go back, but he couldn't continue running either.

The Violet-Gold Alms shook intensely all over, seemingly struggling. The power that emanated from it grew greater and greater. Zu An even started to feel almost as if he couldn't hold onto it anymore.

This old monk’s cultivation is so terrifying! The pressure he’s giving off doesn’t seem to be weaker than the Ghost King’s.

The old monk cackled sinisterly and said, “That item has already acknowledged me as its owner, so you won’t be able to take it away. I’ll give you one last chance. Come and receive this old one’s inheritance, and this old one can ignore what just happened.”

Zu An didn’t say anything; instead, he tried to erase the divine will attached to the item.

The old monk was furious. He cried, “You’re courting death! Since you’re not willing to let go, you can just come over together with it!” As soon as he spoke, a powerful force emanated from the Violet-Gold Alms, making Zu An stagger. He was swept up, and flew in the old monk’s direction.

Zu An knew that if he didn’t let go, he would fall into the lava. At that point, he would die for certain. However, he really didn’t want to just let go and give up on it.

He suddenly thought of something and quickly took out a certain someone. She was dressed in a cropped leather top and a miniskirt, with corset straps around her belly. She had tanned skin and sturdy thighs. There was a sense of explosive power coming from her, as if she were a beautiful leopardess. Who else could it be but Mo Xi?

“Hurry and help me cut through this contract!” Zu An didn’t even have time to speak and conversed through divine will.

Mo Xi had been planning to wait until she received Ki Fruits first, but she quickly noticed the dire situation and didn’t dare to act carelessly. A pair of golden shears appeared in her hands, cutting the space between the Violet-Gold Alms and the old monk.

The Farewell Nanchao skill activated!

it could sever all kinds of contracts and oaths, bringing forth endless rebellion and hatred!

A weight suddenly dropped in Zu An’s stomach, because he remembered that the skill had a prerequisite. If it was voluntary, it would only work if Mo Xi’s cultivation and the other party’s were within one great cultivation rank of each other. If it wasn’t voluntary, Mo Xi’s cultivation had to be greater. Each increase in Farewell Nanchao’s rank would allow that requirement to have some leeway of 20% of a cultivation rank.

However, Mo Xi’s cultivation rank wasn’t that high, and even if he gave her all of his resources, her rank would still be far from that old monk’s.

The monk’s fury made Zu An a bit frightened. His true strength could even exceed the Ghost King’s. How could someone so terrifying possibly allow Farewell Nanchao to sever the connection with his magical treasure?

Zu An was about to make the decision to let go when he felt his hands loosen up. The Violet-Gold Alms actually stopped struggling and instead floated gently in his hands, almost as if it had become really intimate with him. Zu An was stunned.

The old monk was utterly flabbergasted. He exclaimed, “How is this possible? How could an ant like you possibly sever the connection between me and my treasure?!”

Zu An also looked at Mo Xi in confusion. She had a proud expression as she reached her hand out to him, clearly demanding Ki Fruits to eat.

Zu An quickly took out a large pile of Ki Fruits for her, and quickly asked her what was going on as he watched her eat, seemingly enraptured. Mo Xi casually pointed at the Violet-Gold Alms. Even though she couldn't speak, because of the soul contract, he could more or less understand her intentions.

This Violet-Gold Alms had originally been a Buddhist sacred item, but it had ended up falling into the hands of a monster. The creature’s power was too great, so it had ended up being refined helplessly and could only serve the monster. However, as a sacred object of the Buddhist sects, it naturally loathed evil beings. Previously, it had been controlled by force and didn’t have a choice, but Farewell Nanchao gave it an opportunity. By working together with Mo Xi, it had broken the imprint forced on it by Golden Mountain Motuo

Farewell Nanchao’s condition became more lenient if either party was willing. The old monk was too strong to affect, but the Violet-Gold Alms had agreed, making things easy.

When he noticed that his precious treasure really had been stolen, the old monk could no longer hold it in. He had tried to steal the chicken. only to end up losing the rice used to lure it! He roared furiously, causing the entire cave to continuously tremble. The terrifying roars made even Zu An shudder.

When Zu An turned around, he saw that the lava lake seemed to be boiling. A massive figure rushed out from within. He could vaguely make out that it resembled a giant crab. Meanwhile, the old monk wasn’t a monk at all; rather, it had been transformed from one of the monster’s bulging eyes.

It turned out that the monster had been restrained within the lava the entire time, to the point that only its eyes just barely stuck out. Now that it was furious, it actually struggled and brandished its many arms at Zu An.

Zu An could sense that he had been targeted by its divine sense. He knew that an attack was coming soon.

However, suddenly, a strange rune flickered within the lava. Then, the monster screamed miserably, “Noooo!”

Then, its massive body was dragged down by something and pulled into the lava once more. Even the eye that had reached above the lava at first was almost completely submerged. Most of the monk’s body was now immersed in lava, his skin sizzling. There was an expression of pain on his face. He quickly joined his hands and sat down in meditation, murmuring verses. Streaks of light appeared around him, and only then did he prevent his entire body from being submerged.

However, that meant he could no longer stop Zu An. He could only look in Zu An’s direction with resentment.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zu An sighed in relief. He wondered just what kind of seal there was in the lava. It was actually so terrifying!

He thanked Mo Xi, but she completely ignored him and just frantically gorged on the Ki Fruits. After eating her fill, she yawned and returned to her space in satisfaction, seemingly falling asleep.

“Sleeping after you eat, eating after you wake up, and yet you don’t get fat at all,” Zu An couldn't help but say in amazement.

Mi Li suddenly appeared. After stretching a bit, she gave him an annoyed look and remarked, “Have you cursed me that way before too?”

“I wouldn’t dare! You’re my master, right?” Zu An replied, looking at the red-clad woman in front of him. Even though he had already seen her many times, there was still a look of amazement in his eyes.

Mi Li rolled her eyes. She clearly didn’t care about that; instead, she asked curiously, “How did you know that the inheritance he wanted to give you was fake?”

Whether in terms of his costume or tone, the old monk hadn’t made any mistakes. She had only realized that something wasn’t right when she sensed the terrifying aura in the lava. However, she hadn’t spoken out to warn Zu An so that could mature and grow. She had always followed that principle over the past two years as well. If he relied on her power too much, it would be difficult for him to become a truly strong person. However, she had never expected him to successfully pass the trial so easily, and he had even scammed the old monk so beautifully, obtaining a precious treasure from the monster.

Zu An said with a smile, “There’s no such thing as a free lunch. After almost having my body stolen by Old Mi in the past, I’ve become really guarded against similar things. It was strange enough to see someone like an old monk all the way down here, and he even wanted to give me his inheritance from the first meeting. His performance and getup were actually really good, but there was only one thing he did wrong, which was that he acted a bit too enthusiastic. He didn’t even give me a test or something else, and he looked a bit too eager to pass on his legacy.”

Mi Li couldn't help but say, “It might have been because he really didn’t have much time left. Being anxious in that situation would be understandable.”

“That was a possibility, so I tested him a bit on purpose. Sure enough, he exposed himself,” Zu An said. Inwardly, however, he thought to himself, How could a real monk come up with that many Rage points?

“I’ll give you credit for being sharp,” Mi Li said with a chuckle. She was about to say something when her expression suddenly changed. She said before disappearing, “There’s someone coming.”

A sweet scent blew by, and a woman ran over from a corner. She was shocked and happy when she saw Zu An, exclaiming, “Big brother Zu?”

However, she quickly said, “Hurry and follow me! The Ghost King is chasing after me!”
