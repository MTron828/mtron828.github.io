Chapter 1722: Death

Yan Xuehen’s beautiful brows furrowed slightly. She said, “The Righteous Sun Sect has always been number one among the daoist sects, and their mountain defense formation is unquestionably formidable. The only way I could find a way to break through would be if we could find a weak point. But the Righteous Sun Sun Sect’s mountain defense formation has never been activated before, and no one has seen it either. Finding some weaknesses might be…”

She had spent the whole time nearby, waiting for Chu Chuyan and the others to come out. Initially, upon hearing that the emperor was coming, she hadn’t really wished to interact with him, so she had decided to just stay far away. However, when she sensed the tremendous explosion and the battle that had taken place, she naturally decided to head over to see what was going on.

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Why even bother? If we attack it together, I refuse to believe that we can’t blast open a path.”

Yan Xuehen rolled her eyes and muttered, “An impulsive and reckless woman with too much muscle and not enough brain.”

“What did you say?!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, erupting into a rage.

Zu An felt a huge headache. These two really just naturally didn’t get along… They always started fighting as soon as they met.

Mi Li remarked with amusement, “These two can be considered powerful and famous individuals in the world of warriors, and yet they’re like two little girls when they’re jealous.”

Zu An could only say, “It’s not that they’re jealous, but rather that their natural dispositions are just a bad match.”

“Hm… I want to see what kind of reaction they’ll have if they find out what kind of relationship the other has with you. Would they start fighting with each other even in bed?” Mi Li wondered with a smile.

“A master should act the part, right? Isn’t your behavior a bit too over the top?” Zu An remarked in annoyance.

“I’m worrying for your sake here! By the way, which of these girls do you actually like?” Mi Li asked with great interest.

Zu An was stunned. After a while, he replied, “I refuse to answer that question.”

“Heh, men,” Mi Li retorted with a sneer. “Isn’t it just that you want them all? But for someone like you who’s always sneaking around, you might just lose them all if you’re exposed.”

Zu An was dumbstruck. He asked, “Why is this what you’re concerned about? Isn’t Zhao Han still fighting up there?”

“What does his fight have to do with me?” Mi Li harrumphed. “It’s these women of yours who all have to pour me tea respectfully in the future. Of course I have to keep my eyes on them.”

Zu An asked in surprise, “They’ll serve you tea?”

“I’m your master, so isn’t that only natural?” Mi Li replied, before suddenly realizing what he was thinking. She couldn't help but snap in annoyance, “Damn kid, what kind of nonsense are you thinking right now?!”

You have successfully trolled Mi Li for +333 +333 +333…

Xie Daoyun suddenly said weakly, “I might actually have a way.”

“Huh?”

The others all looked at her with strange expressions.

After all, even these grandmasters couldn't do anything. Furthermore, Yan Xuehen was a runemaster herself. And yet, this junior actually had a solution?

Now that so many eyes were on her, Xie Daoyun was a bit embarrassed. She said, “Actually, the reason I came to investigate Violet Mountain was to see if there are any killing formations. Because I had to examine many places, I set up some transport formations to make it easier for me to move around. I just happened to leave one by Golden Peak too. I was going to secretly destroy it before, but I didn’t expect something like this to happen today.”

Qiu Honglei couldn't help but voice her puzzlement. “But now that the mountain defense formation is activated, it should restrict all transport formations. Your transport formation should also have become useless, right?”

Yan Xuehen said seriously, “I think I have an idea of what Miss Xie is saying. This mountain defense formation should not have any weaknesses, or at the very least, it should be impenetrable in the short term. But with this formation she has created, we will have an opening to exploit. If we modify it a bit, we should have a way of getting through.” She was also knowledgeable about formations, so she quickly followed Xie Daoyun’s line of reasoning.

Xie Daoyun hurriedly nodded. Her expression suggested she had found someone who truly understood her.

Yun Jianyue’s face heated up, but she quickly changed the topic. “Then let’s get moving already. What are we wasting time here for?”

Yan Xuehen paid her no mind. After asking Xie Daoyun a few questions about where she had set up the transport formations, she then discussed how they would get through the mountain defense formation.

…

Meanwhile, on Golden Peak, the atmosphere was very tense because Zhao Han had suddenly killed Feng Wuchang.

When he saw that his side’s morale was dropping, Zhao Jing harrumphed and no longer held himself back. A tremendous aura erupted. Divine splendor surged behind him and rushed into the heavens.

The civil and military officials at Guidance Palace, halfway up the mountain, all trembled. There was actually another aura at the earth immortal rank!

The emperor had been publicly acknowledged as an earth immortal over the years, so everyone knew about his aura. However, this new aura was entirely different from the one they were familiar with. It was actually a newly ascended earth immortal!

At first, Bi Qi and the others hadn’t been all that worried about the emperor’s safety. But now, they immediately lost confidence.

On Golden Peak, Zhao Han looked at Zhao Jing and said, “You’ve ascended to earth immortal rank, as expected. You have hidden it quite well these years.”

Zhao Jing said indifferently, “In terms of talent, I am no worse than you. You relied on your advantage of age to seize the throne, and afterward, you had the entire empire’s resources to aid your cultivation. That was how you became the first one to break through into the earth immortal rank. With enough resources and time, catching up to you was not too difficult.”

“Catch up to me?” Zhao Han repeated, laughing mockingly. He looked amused, as if he didn’t really feel like arguing.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zhao Jing was annoyed, but his brother’s many years of accumulated prestige still remained. He still didn’t dare to act rashly. However, because his earth immortal rank power spread out and countered some of Zhao Han’s pressure, the others had clearly become more confident too.

A splendid and magnificent palace suddenly appeared in midair. It targeted Zhuxie Chixin and Eunuch Wen, who were fighting intensely.

“Immortal Sword?” Zhao Han muttered with a frown. Just then, however, Zhao Jing took a step toward him, as if to stop him from rescuing them.

A figure with an aloof and transcendent bearing suddenly appeared out of thin air. A longsword that resembled a lunar palace thrust out.

Eunuch Wen had been using all of his power to face Xuan Bajing’s attacks. How could he have anticipated that someone else would suddenly appear behind him? By the time he reacted to what was happening, it was already too late. He could only hurriedly use the Pure Yang Art of Youth to shield his back. He thought to himself that as long as he evaded the attack, the emperor would be able to bail him out.

However, the immortal sword calmly thrust forward, and the faint barrier behind Eunuch Wen was instantly sliced apart. Then, the longsword sliced right through with irresistible force, sending sword ki straight into his heart.

Eunuch Wen roared. The Pure Yang Art of Youth he had cultivated his entire life fiercely exploded. He only had a single thought in his mind, which was to at least drag one opponent down with him even if he had to die to do it.

Unfortunately, the one behind him backed off immediately after approaching and wasn’t injured at all. He appeared next to Zhuxie Chixin a second later.

Zhuxie Chixin was shocked. Fortunately, Eunuch Wen had been there to at least buy him a bit of reaction time. The death energy around him surged ferociously. It was so dense that even the Imperial Guards that were farther away paled, then fell; their life force had been seized by the death energy.

When it approached his body, the spotlessly white longsword instantly turned ash gray, as if it were losing its spiritual nature. Even Li Changsheng groaned, clearly not having expected Zhuxie Chixin to possess such concentrated death energy.

Even so, he was a grandmaster who was famous for many years. He suddenly erupted with dazzling splendor. In a moment of imminent peril, he recalled his sword and blocked the reaper’s scythe.

Zhuxie Chixin was about to launch another attack when his expression changed. When he looked down toward his chest, he saw a golden armband there. It was rapidly spinning and vibrating after blasting straight through from behind him!
