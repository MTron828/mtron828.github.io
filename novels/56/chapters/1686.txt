Chapter 1635: Golden Peak’s Silence

Zhang Zijiang couldn't help but remark to Xie Daoyun, “Lady Xie, say, why are there so many stupid people in this world? Sir Zu is clearly speaking the truth, and yet not only do these people not feel grateful, they are all rushing at him for a beating.”

He was starting to feel a bit of regret. Just now, he had been a bit frightened by the sect masters’ prestige and hadn’t remembered to promptly praise Sir Zu. He had missed such a great opportunity for nothing!

When she saw how this man was about to smack his thigh rotten from regret, Xie Daoyun had a strange expression. She replied, “It’s normal for them to misunderstand. After all, big brother Zu’s situation is a bit special.” If she hadn’t personally witnessed big brother Zu fight, even she wouldn’t have been able to imagine how his seemingly powerless appearance could hide such strength.

Tranquility Temple’s little monk Jie Se tugged on Master Jian Huang’s sleeves, saying, “Master, I feel that great senior brother’s name isn’t a good fit for him anymore.”

Master Jian Huang remained silent for a long time. In the end, he sighed and said, “Once we return to the temple, help your master change his name.”

Jie Se’s great senior brother’s Buddhist name was Jie Kuang, because he was just too arrogant and egotistical. However, compared to this guy, he didn’t even have the right to call himself arrogant anymore.[1]

“Xu Chuan, you are a power form stage master rank cultivator, and yet you have the nerve to bully a youngster? If you want to fight, I’ll fight against you!” Elder Huo Ling roared furiously. Even though she also felt that Zu An’s words were way too egotistical, he was still helping Manman, so she couldn't just stand by without doing anything.

Elder Xu was about to die from resentment. Are you blind? Just who was bullying whom just now? Still, he knew he wasn’t a match for Elder Huo Ling, so he ignored her challenge and just looked at Zu An. He asked, “Are you planning to hide behind a woman again?”

Zu An said indifferently, “I’ve been waiting for you to make your move. It’s you who doesn’t seem to have the courage.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Damn it all! None of you had better stop me!” Elder Xu yelled, his eyes erupting with red light. He rolled up his sleeves and jumped onto the stage.

The sect masters nodded inwardly. This brat really was too infuriating. We couldn’t take it even as spectators.

The disciples were even more excited. They had thought that they were only going to watch disciples fight, but now, they would be able to see the judges face each other! This trip really hadn’t been made in vain! The only regret was that one of the judges was a bit too weak, so the fight could end too quickly.

Elder Huo Ling panicked and wanted to rush forward, but she was stopped by the other sect representatives.

“Elder, as Sir Zu has already spoken such words, he clearly has some confidence. There is no need for you to worry about him.”

Even though that was what they said, they were clearly happy to see this unfortunate situation. They didn’t think Zu An really had anything to rely on.

Now that she had been stopped, Elder Huo Ling couldn't go over there even though she wanted to.

Elder Xu walked over to Zu An and stopped i n front of him, saying, “You can make your move first.”

He cared about his status, after all. Even though he was furious, he still couldn't make the first move against a junior. It was more appropriate for the other party to attack first, and for him to retaliate after.

“If I make my move, you might not have a chance anymore,” Zu An said with a calm expression. “Besides, I’ve already said that I don’t even need to use my hands to deal with you.”

Elder Xu was so angry he laughed. He replied, “Fine, then I want to see how you wouldn’t give me another chance if you moved first!”

You have successfully trolled Xu Chuan for +666 +666 +666…

The surrounding sect masters, and even Huo Ling, felt that Zu An really was going too far in terms of exaggerating his own abilities.

Elder Xu couldn't be bothered with the world of warriors’ rules. His fist slammed toward Zu An. As a power form master rank cultivator, this fist had the power to uproot mountains. The surrounding disciples all clutched their ears in pain because of the sound waves from his punch… no, from the blinding flash of power created by the friction of his fist moving through the air. The boundaries around the stage began to split apart, and the entire stage was eventually brought to the edge of collapse.

When they sensed that terrifying power, the few master rank sect elders, as well as Wu Xiaofan and Wan Guiyi of the younger generation disciples, were horrified. Was this the strength of a power form master rank cultivator?! If they were hit directly by such a fist, not even fragments of bone would remain, right?

Even Zhang Zijiang and Xie Daoyun both felt nervous. They had seen Zu An fight before, but back then, it had only been against a hero form master rank cultivator, Scarface Yang Shen. Right now, this Elder Xu was three whole cultivation realms above, at the power form stage! His attack’s strength far, far exceeded that of Yang Shen’s.

Only Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue remained expressionless. They felt completely calm.

A huge explosion erupted. The stage Elder Xu was on completely collapsed, and even the surrounding stages were affected, several of them breaking down. Fortunately, Wang Wuxie and a few others acted promptly, forming a new barrier and preventing the blast waves from harming all of the disciples.

“That Zu guy is dead, right?”

“If he doesn’t die from this, what is he, a god?”

“Still, he is a court official, after all. Mount Luofu’s future seems a bit troublesome.”

Zhao Xiaodie voiced her alarm. She nervously looked at the smoke and dust, with an expression that seemed to carry a mix of anxiety and relief.

The ninth disciple Cai Yu remarked, “Junior sister cares about senior brother after all. That pretty boy is dead for certain. In a way, that is also a form of justice for senior brother.”

Zhao Xiaodie forced a smile, her expression extremely conflicted. Shouldn’t I be happy that that bastard died? But why do I just feel empty inside?

However, she keenly sensed the sect masters all staring at the stage with grave expressions, as if they had seen something appalling.

“Look, there’s golden light in the sky!”

No one knew who shouted, but everyone present looked up. They suddenly saw golden ripples appear one after another. Furthermore, there was a figure floating in front of those ripples.

Who else could it be but Zu An?! He was holding Pei Mianman, as well. Perhaps because she had fainted or because she was embarrassed, her head was buried into his chest.

“He doesn’t even let a single chance to flirt with a woman go,” Yun Jianyue cursed. She clearly looked down on his actions.

Meanwhile, Yan Xuehen also looked down slightly, her expression seemingly becoming thirty percent colder than normal.

Xie Daoyun had been worried at first, but when she saw that Zu An was fine, she sighed in relief. But when she saw him carrying Pei Mianman in his arms, she felt sour inside. Still, she quickly remembered that he had carried her just like that before, and her mood quickly improved a lot.

He actually escaped that attack and even had the leisure to save Pei Mianman?

Elder Xu was completely shocked. He had clearly locked onto Zu An, but had suddenly lost track of him in an instant.

“That guy was pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger!”

Wan Guiyi, Wu Xiaofan, Lou Wucheng, and the other representative disciples’ eyes all shone. They all felt a strong fighting spirit surge within them. They had never expected that there would actually be a peer with such profound cultivation on Golden Peak! As for the other disciples, all they had left now was jealousy, envy, and hatred.

“If I could be saved by a heroic young master like this one day, it would be worth it even if I died!”

Many female disciples were afflicted by starry-eyed infatuation.

The other male cultivators cursed inwardly. Why don’t you all look in a mirror? Still, their hearts were also pounding in their chests. They were all young men; which one of them hadn’t dreamed about becoming unmatched heroes who descended from above to save their sweethearts?

However, as they grew older, they had all come to believe that that was nothing more than an illusion. They hadn’t expected to witness it for themselves today. There really was light in this world!

Just then, the golden ripples gradually condensed into shining longswords. Every single one of them released pressure at least on par with the heaven-grade.

“How does he have so many incredible weapons?” Wang Wuxie and the others wondered. Now, even they were flustered.

Meanwhile, Elder Xu, who was at the center of it all, realized that something wasn’t right. He wanted to run, but he discovered that he had already been locked onto by a terrifying aura. He couldn't escape at all! In that instant, the golden longswords all flew forth. They were like streaks of flowing light, instantly enveloping him within.

“Mount Luofu Defense!” Elder Xu cried in horror, quickly using his most powerful defensive skill. A projection shaped like Luofu Mountain surrounded his entire body and released a sturdy aura. At the same time, he took out his greatest weapons and treasures, seemingly not even caring about money anymore.

Unfortunately, the golden light in the sky seemed to purge everything in its path. All of his treasures and weapons shattered one by one. In the end, the mountain projection completely collapsed…

“Sir Zu, please be lenient!” Wang Wuxie quickly advised.

While carrying Pei Mianman in his hands, Zu An turned around slightly and replied, “Can you give me a reason to do so?”

Wang Wuxie wanted to say ‘do it to give me face’, but he suddenly realized that his face wouldn’t necessarily be suitable. He was suddenly moved and quickly said, “He held back when he struck you before and didn’t plan to kill you!”

Whether it was because of the unwritten rules of the orthodox sects or because he didn’t want to kill a court official, most of Elder Xu’s power had been directed at the surrounding stage. Of course, if Zu An couldn't block it, he would have been seriously injured. However, there would have been no danger to his life.

Zu An nodded when he heard that. The sword light closest to Elder Xu suddenly stopped just an inch from his forehead.

Elder Xu gulped. He released the breath he had been holding, then fainted on the spot. Only then did the spectators see just how bitter of a state he was in. He didn’t have a single piece of clothing intact, and there were bloody sword scars all over his body. It was clear that if Zu An hadn’t held back, Elder Xu would already be nothing more than a pile of mincemeat.

It had to be stated that a master rank cultivator at the power form stage had both ridiculous strength and constitution. Meanwhile, Mount Luofu Defense was Mount Luofu’s most powerful fighting skill, known as the greatest defensive skill of the daoist sects, and yet Elder Xu had actually still been injured to such an extent!

No one knew who spoke up, but that person said, “He really didn’t seem to have used his hands from start to finish…”

Whether it was the young disciples of Golden Peak or the aged sect masters, all of them were silent.
