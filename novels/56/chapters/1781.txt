Chapter 1730: Wedding Clothes for Another

Just then, Zhao Han had appeared to be at the end of his rope, even going so far as to haggle with King Qi over Zu An’s group. But who could have expected the situation to suddenly be reversed like this?

Before Zu An had time to react, Ruhua moved even more quickly. With a roar, he shot toward Zhao Han like an artillery shell. He had been most worried about what other methods Zhao Han could be hiding, but he hadn’t expected it to be something like this at all! How could he still just watch without doing anything?!

Just then, Zhao Han waved his sleeve. A meticulously crafted jade ruler’s seal, carved with nine dragons, flew out. A second later, those dragons seemed to come alive as they surrounded the seal! A powerful imperial aura spread out, making those present feel an intense urge to worship it.

“A deity-grade weapon!”

“The Human Emperor’s Seal!”

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen’s expressions changed. They both recognized the object.

Zhao Han was the most powerful cultivator in this world, and he was also the ruler of an empire. He had endless riches at his disposal, which naturally included divine weapons. However, he was really just too strong. He could subdue the world’s powerful beings with just a turn of his hand, and didn’t need to use a divine weapon at all. Over time, the people of the world had already forgotten about the existence of the Human Emperor’s Seal.

The Human Emperor’s Seal turned toward Ruhua and attacked him by unleashing a vast and profound aura. Even Zu An’s group, which wasn’t its real target, felt its earth-shattering power. In that instant, it was as if the heavens itself were going to collapse.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue both took measures to protect the people around them. After all, Qiu Honglei and Xie Daoyun had weaker cultivations, so only then did they feel a bit better.

Ruhua didn’t dare to face the Human Emperor’s Seal head-on. Instead, he chanted an incantation, and an intricate brass bell appeared above his head. It was filled with Buddhist light, and mysterious voices chanting Buddhist scriptures emanated from it. As the flickering light and sacred scriptures surrounded him, a giant bell projection formed. It blocked the incoming Human Emperor’s Seal.

Dooooooong!

The bell rang with a long and drawn-out noise. All of Golden Peak seemed as if it had been swept through by a hurricane. Not a single blade of grass remained wherever the force passed.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing raised their respective sect treasures to protect themselves. However,, their bodies trembled and they fainted on the spot. They had been secretly adjusting their internal energy and finally managed to recover a bit of strength, and yet in that instant, their efforts were all for naught.

Guan Chouhai had just managed to regain a bit of consciousness, and yet he was immediately met with the terrifying noise. He raised the Twin Vajra Armbands in a hurry, but the powerful shockwave sent his armbands straight into his forehead. With a loud clang, he fainted once more while foaming at the mouth. His hands and feet twitched a few times.

The Human Emperor’s Seal clashed with the Tranquility Bell in a trial of strength. At that moment, Ruhua couldn't move at all and could only focus on controlling his weapon to defend against the Human Emperor’s Seal as much as possible.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Zhao Han had King Qi’s yang spirit detained. A malicious smile appeared on his face as he said, “My foolish little brother, I know that you have never been satisfied being under me, and that you would have just as easily replaced me in a different situation. Unfortunately, you have never been anything more than a little clown in my eyes. Everything was within my grasp all this time.”

King Qi’s yang spirit had a warped and malicious expression, as if he wanted to say something, and yet couldn't at all.

Zhao Han could roughly guess his thoughts. He said with a smile, “You must be thinking that this is strange. Why is it that even though you are clearly already an earth immortal, you cannot resist in the slightest?”

He paused before continuing, “You thought that your talent was unparalleled, and yet you could not break through into the earth immortal rank after remaining at the grandmaster level for so long. That was why I arranged a ‘miraculous encounter’ for you and allowed you to receive a certain cultivation method. As soon as you cultivated it, you felt that you could break through into the earth immortal rank, so you studied it more and more.

“Unfortunately, you never could have expected that I was the one who prepared all those things. That cultivation method’s true name is ‘Wedding Clothes for Another’. As the name implies, all of your cultivation is just for another. This skill allows the strong to devour the weak. That is why even though I might not be able to win easily against other earth immortals, against you, you cannot muster any strength to resist as long as I will it!”

While he was speaking, endless rays of light gathered toward the forehead of King Qi’s yang spirit. Then, it flowed into Zhao Han’s body through his hand, causing his aura to grow more and more powerful. His strength was gradually restored to its peak.

Perhaps due to the damage to his yang spirit, King Qi’s flesh also shriveled up. His tall and stalwart body now looked like a withered corpse. At last, he understood everything. He knew that he had already been utterly crushed.

A hint of despair flashed through his eyes. However, he was still a hero of his generation. Knowing that he was definitely going to die in this situation, his yang spirit suddenly erupted with dazzling brilliance. He chose to detonate his own yang spirit!

After all, he was one of this world’s strongest beings and own3ed countless secret texts. Now that he had chosen self-destruction, not even Zhao Han could stop him.

Boom!

How powerful was the explosion of an earth immortal’s primordial spirit? Zhao Han’s expression changed a bit. He quickly brought back the Human Emperor’s Seal to protect himself.

No one knew what motives he had, but Ruhua surrounded the others present within the Tranquility Bell as well; only then were Guan Chouhai and the other unconscious experts saved from the fate of dying while unconscious.

…

Halfway up the mountain, the officials all looked at the mountaintop in horror. Just what kind of explosion could produce such power?

The officials of King Qi’s faction couldn't help but remark, “Wouldn’t we be throwing our lives away too if we went up and got ourselves involved?”

Many people agreed, adding, “That’s right, an earth immortal rank battle isn’t something we mortals can participate in.”

Murong Tong exclaimed furiously, “What kind of nonsense are you saying? The court has taken care of you so well for so many years; when it really needs our help, how can we get cold feet?!”

Murong Qinghe said in agreement, “Exactly, exactly! Even if we can’t join the fight, with so many of us together, we’re not a force to look down on either! Furthermore, the armies below will arrive soon. With the support of military formations, even if we face an earth immortal, so what?!”

She knew why her grandfather had to voice his opinion so firmly. If something really happened to the emperor, the other officials could turn out fine, but not her grandfather. He was the Supervisor of Attendants and had the duty of ensuring the emperor’s safety to begin with. There was no way he would avoid responsibility! His punishment would be dismissal at best, and at worst, it could even be an execution of the entire clan down to the third generation! Furthermore, with the Murong clan’s conviction, now wasn’t the time to cower either.

When he heard that, Meng Yi nodded and said, “Indeed. His Majesty is in danger, so we absolutely need to help him!”

At the same time, he secretly conversed with Bi Qi and the other core forces serving the emperor. Now that King Qi had gone missing, they all suspected that he was on Golden Peak. As such, they secretly wanted to detain King Qi’s faction.

Currently, King Qi’s faction was far from its previous prestige. The Fengshan Ceremony was a clear display of the dominance of the emperor’s faction.

The officials of King Qi’s faction also had similar suspicions. All of them had heavy moods. Something so important could only have been told to a few participating people, so most of the faction hadn’t known what would happen beforehand. They were all extremely alarmed.

Soon after, the officials agreed on a decision. They quickly rushed out to help the emperor. Additionally, they decided to retrieve the siege cannons that had been waiting beneath the mountain. Murong Tong took Murong Qinghe with him to personally handle them, intending to blast open the formation as quickly as possible.

…

Meanwhile, on Golden Peak, all of the light and smoke dispersed. A giant pit that was several dozen meters wide had appeared, the result of King Qi’s self-destruction. It was easy to imagine just how devastating the power of an earth immortal’s suicide was.

Nine shining dragons swirled around the Human Emperor’s Seal as Zhao Han reappeared with the item in hand. Apart from the scorched black traces on his clothes, however, he hadn’t really suffered any damage from the explosion. He looked at the deep crater in the ground. He had a hint of a forlorn expression as he said, “He at least had a resolute character. It is no wonder that he was able to fight against this emperor for all these years.”

Ruhua knew that there was already no way to reverse the result, so he wasn’t in a rush to attack. Instead, he looked at Zhao Han with a hint of puzzlement and asked, “If your majesty already had a way to restrain King Qi, why didn’t you use that ‘wedding clothes’ or whatever skill on him from the start?”

Zhao Han sneered and replied, “If I hadn’t acted like this, how could I have drawn out someone like you who was hiding so well?” He paused, then looked at Zu An and continued, “As well as some individuals who seem to have some ulterior motives?”
