Chapter 1612: Jadefall Palace

At Wang Wuxie’s cultivation realm, he had long reached a point where not many things could make him feel strong emotions. Normally, all the members of the Righteous Sun Sect called him emotionless in private, saying that he was unfathomable, but their jaws would undoubtedly drop if they saw what he was acting like at that moment.

Wang Wuxie’s expressions had turned uncharacteristically rich. He appeared nostalgic, happy, and yet also in pain… To think such complicated expressions could actually coexist on one person’s face at the same time!

Wang Wuxie walked over to the place where he had been meditating. He opened a secret compartment below it and took out a scroll. He slowly unfolded it, revealing the image of a young, beautiful woman wielding a sword. Her white dress and long hair fluttered in midair. She looked as if she were a goddess dancing in the clouds. However, her expression in the picture carried a hint of anger...

When he saw the woman’s lovely appearance, Wang Wuxie recalled some memories from the Nine Sects Competition of that time. A slight smile appeared on his lips. The picture was something he had personally drawn. Only by drawing the scene of their first meeting had he been able to even slightly alleviate his longing for her.

If Yu Yanluo were present, she would definitely have commented that even though the drawing was only made with above-average skill, there were decades of feelings contained within. That have it much more charm and grace, making it no worse than the work of any great master.

If Zu An were present, he would immediately recognize the woman in the drawing as his big sis Yan. However, the young lady looked much more underripe than the mature and ice-cold Yan Xuehen he knew.

As he stared at the woman in the picture, Wang Wuxie remained absentminded for a stick of incense’s time. Afterward, he slowly exhaled. He laughed self-deprecatingly, muttering, “Wang Wuxie, Wang Wuxie, aren’t you always flaunting yourself as some extraordinary genius? The real person has already arrived, and yet you only dare to stare blankly at this inanimate thing?”

He carefully rolled up the drawing, seemingly scared of damaging it in the slightest. He returned it to the secret compartment. Then, he sorted out his clothes before walking away with a big smile. His heart burned with red-hot passion, as if he had returned to the times of his youth.

He pushed open the door. As the sunlight hit his face, even though he had lived on Golden Peak for so many years, he felt that it was more beautiful than ever before. However, as soon as he took a single step, he was struck by biting cold winds that wailed past him.

Wang Wuxie was completely stunned, and his boiling blood gradually calmed down. He was the Righteous Sun Sect’s Master, as well as the State Teacher. He was no longer that immature brat who could give up everything else for the sake of love.

As he stood there by the entrance, his deep and profound gaze fell upon the winding road beneath him. He knew that Yan Xuehen was standing somewhere on those stairs. He stood there in the cold winds for a long time without moving; it was as if he had become a sculpture. In the end, however, he closed the door again, cutting off the sunlight.

He understood Yan Xuehen too well. She was most likely here to bring her disciple to the Great Sects Competition. Even if he met her, so what?

She didn’t accept me back then; how could she be willing to accept me now?

He laughed self-deprecatingly. Even though they had been separated for several decades and never met once, he had collected every bit of information he could get about her. Yan Xuehen’s ice-cold personality was something he understood better than anyone else. If they didn’t share any fate, what was the point of forcing things? He would only make everyone in the world look down on him.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The only thing worth feeling gratified about was that even after all these years, Yan Xuehen was still alone. She had never thought highly of another man.

That means that it isn’t my fault for not being charming enough. Perhaps I’m still the most special one in Xuehen’s heart.

After centuries have passed, when the world of warriors talks about our past, perhaps it will be considered a beautiful tale.

His heart gradually calmed down when he thought of that.

…

Meanwhile, at the foot of the mountain, Zhang Xi and the other disciples were all restless. They clearly still hadn’t recovered from the shock of seeing Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan. They naturally didn’t dare to have any thoughts about a glorious senior like Yan Xuehen, but Chu Chuyan was their peer. She was like the little sister next door! Perhaps they could still have the slightest sliver of a chance.

Suddenly, a slight disturbance happened not too far away.

“How big…”

No one knew who had started the conversation, but several voices rose and fell. Even though they deliberately suppressed their voices, because of how many people there were, Zhang Xi could still vaguely hear them.

“What do they mean, how big? Don’t tell me monsters have come to attack Violet Mountain?” Zhang Xi muttered in shock. He didn’t have time to focus on his lingering feelings for Chu Chuyan anymore and quickly looked into the distance. At the same time, he reflexively moved his hand to the hilt of his sword.

However, the moment he saw what was happening, Zhang Xi couldn't help but sigh in admiration. He finally understood what those people were saying. He too remarked, “How big!”

A group was moving toward the gate; they were clearly from another sect. The one in the lead was a large, tall man with some stubble around his mouth. His appearance lent him a sense of imposing pressure.

Next to him was a middle-aged daoist nun who was actually quite good-looking, but because she always had a frown on her face as if everyone owed her money, and they had just seen the extraordinary beauties Chu Chuyan and Yan Xuehen, her looks didn’t do anything for the onlookers.

However, all of their attention was drawn to the young lady next to her. She was dressed in a red top and black dress, giving her both the energetic air of youth and a hint of dangerous beauty. This young lady’s appearance actually seemed to be on par with that of Sect Master Yan’s disciple!

The onlookers were all shocked. Just what was happening today? They were actually fortunate enough to encounter so many extraordinary beauties!

Compared to Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan’s composed demeanor, this young lady looked much more enthusiastic. Her charming smile and pretty eyes made her extremely captivating. However, what drew the most attention was her chest; her top looked as if it were about to burst with every step, taking the hearts of the men present up and down as her chest moved. There wasn’t a single exposed area, but that couldn't stop their imagination from going crazy.

If the feeling Yan Xuehen’s disciple gave off was akin to an ice-cold glacier, this young woman made the onlookers feel as if they were next to a volcano… no, as if they were about to become volcanoes themselves, ready to erupt at a moment’s notice.

“Ah, I’m going to die, I’m going to die! How can there be such a beautiful woman in this world? If I could make her my wife, I’d lose at least 20 years of my life, right? But which man wouldn’t be willing to accept such a burden?”

Many of the disciples present no longer had Chu Chuyan in their minds. She was beautiful, but she was just too cold and seemed quite difficult to approach. However, this woman looked like the open-minded and enthusiastic sort. She would no doubt be easy to get along with.

Even Zhang Xi became a bit absent-minded, trapped by the woman’s massive… smile.

“Hmph!” the middle-aged daoist nun harrumphed. A chilly pressure spread outward, and the onlookers’ bodies trembled. This woman’s cultivation was actually incredibly high! It seemed to be at the grandmaster level.

Zhang Xi also trembled, and only then did he remember his role. He scolded himself inwardly, thinking that he had really cultivated for nothing all these years. How could he have so many filthy emotions within him?

He quickly stepped forward and greeted them. “May I ask if senior came here to participate in the daoist sects’ competition?”

Someone at that cultivation rank definitely wasn’t someone a junior like him could stop. He naturally couldn’t ignorantly ask for a jade token. However, the middle-aged woman gave him a look of disdain, as if she felt that he didn’t have the right to talk to her.

While Zhang Xi was overwhelmed with embarrassment, the young lady helped him out of his conundrum, saying, “Hello, senior brother. We’re from Jadefall Palace. This is our invitation jade token.” Afterward, she handed him the token.

The woman’s bright and beautiful smile made Zhang Xi feel dizzy. In that moment, he immediately made a pledge of undying love.

Mom, I think I’m experiencing true love!

It’s completely different from what I felt toward those junior and senior sisters, Xiao Youchu, Chen Rongyu, Gu Hengbo, Li Xiangjun, Kou Baimen, Ma Xianglan…

Uh… Let’s not talk about junior sister Chu Chuyan for now.

He received the jade token in a daze. When he saw the contents, he immediately broke out into a cold sweat. All of the fluttering feelings within him disappeared. He bowed respectfully to the large, tall man, saying, “So Jadefall Palace’s Palace Lord came personally! Please forgive my negligence!”
