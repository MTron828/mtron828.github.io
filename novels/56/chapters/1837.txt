Chapter 1786: Mutual Salvation

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman were both stunned. They had initially thought that Baogu would have some miraculous method of solving their problem. And in the end, it was a kiss? In order to pass down this skill, she had ended up using the rest of her soul force. They naturally didn’t blame her and could only hold gratitude. But why had this senior come up with such a… such an indecent skill?

“What do we do now?” Chu Chuyan asked, looking at Pei Mianman with an awkward expression.

When Baogu passed the skill to them, they had gained a brief bit of clearheadedness. Now, the powerful drowsiness attacked them again. Their eyelids continued to droop. But such a thing was just too strange!

Pei Mianman also blushed. However, she was a bit bolder and said, “What else can we do? We’ll just kiss then. Either way, we’re not strangers.”

Then, she just wrapped her arm around Chuyan’s waist and drew her close. She sighed in amazement, thinking that Chuyan’s waist really was slender. She didn’t hesitate any longer and tilted her head. Faced with Chu Chuyan’s shocked expression, she kissed her. Chu Chuyan knew that this was the only solution. Even though she was incredibly embarrassed, she didn’t dodge.

Their lips pressed together gently. Their eyes widened, and their breaths quickened.

Her lips are so soft! No wonder Ah Zu likes it…

At that moment, both of them thought the same thing.

Then, they stared into each other’s eyes. An extreme sense of awkwardness spread throughout this cave. Both of their feet seemed about to dig into the ground.

Why isn’t it working?

Both women saw the confusion in each other’s eyes.

However, they were both smart women. The ‘Kiss of the Goddess’ skill description was extremely clear. Only a kiss would work, not merely pressing their lips together.

A hint of resolve appeared in Chu Chuyan’s eyes. Just then, she was too embarrassed and had ended up letting the other woman seize the initiative, which she regretted. How could she let Pei Mianman take charge again?

I was clearly the first one!

Motivated by an inexplicable desire to w in, she reached her tongue in and transferred her internal energy the way Kiss of the Goddess directed her to.

Sensing Chuyan’s movements, Pei Mianman’s eyes widened. Who would have thought that even though Chu Chuyan normally looks cold and indifferent, she actually has such a naughty side to her!

Still, there was no way she would show any weakness here! She acted quickly to return the kiss.

Is it so amazing that you were the first wife? Ah Zu and I spent the longest time together!Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Sensing Manman’s retaliation, Chu Chuyan’s pale cheeks became flushed. She was rather cold in nature, and whenever she was with Zu An, she usually just responded to his initiative. She wasn’t good at these things at all. Now that Pei Mianman had launched her assault, she quickly lost power. Feeling really embarrassed and awkward, she couldn't help but feel a bit aggrieved.

How can she be this good at this?!

Manman and Ah Zu had definitely kissed countless times. When Chuyan thought of that, the embarrassment withdrew. Instead, she felt a strong sense of unhappiness.

In the domain of cultivation, not only did talent matter, one’s temperament was even more important. Only those who would never give up and keep pushing forward would be able to shine in cultivation. Both Pei Mianman and Chu Chuyan had already proven that they had the will of the strong.

Chuyan wasn’t willing to admit defeat so easily. She quickly calmed down and seriously launched her counterattack.

The two had never fought at Violet Mountain; now, they were ready to settle things. But the weapons they used weren’t swords…

At first, Chu Chuyan was definitely no match for the skilled and passionate Pei Mianman. However, they had both received the inheritance of Kiss of the Goddess. When it came to the skill, Pei Mianman’s advantage in technique was very slight.

At first, because of Chu Chuyan’s personality, she was pushed back bit by bit. However, when she started taking things seriously, Pei Mianman’s face gradually turned red too. She was no longer as calm as before.

As expected of the world’s most powerful kissing skill…

The two women were evenly matched. Both of their eyes were soon covered in a faint layer of mist. Their bodies also became softer and softer. The sleep-inducing energy that had entangled them from before also gradually disappeared…

After an unknown amount of time passed, both of them couldn't help but lie on the ground. They didn’t know whose hand moved first, or if it was at the same time, but when their skin made contact with the ice-cold air, both women trembled and gradually woke up. Then, they immediately pulled their hands away as if they were shocked. They sorted out their clothes with their backs to each other.

“We should be… okay, right?” Chu Chuyan said, her expression a bit unnatural. She could sense that the powerful drowsiness was already gone.

“We should be okay,” Pei Mianman replied, also feeling really embarrassed. She didn’t think she could forget the previous experience for the rest of her life. Fortunately, she was with Chuyan this time. If it were another woman, she really wouldn’t know what to do.

Chu Chuyan also felt something similar. In that instant, the cave was once again filled with an awkward silence.

After sorting out their clothes, in order to get rid of the awkwardness, Pei Mianman deliberately tried to hook her finger around Chu Chuyan’s chin and said, “Girl, your kiss wasn’t bad.”

Chu Chuyan flicked the slender, jade-like finger, preventing it from making contact and replying, “You’re not all that bad yourself.”

When they recalled the strange experience from earlier, both women quickly fell back into awkward silence. Then, they spoke quietly.

“Let’s not let anyone else know about what happened today.”

“Yeah, I had the same thought.”

It was still better to keep such a humiliating thing a secret.

…

Chu Chuyan cultivated the Unshakable Daoist Manual, so she gradually calmed down. She asked, “By the way, what did you want to say about my master before?”

Pei Mianman raised a brow. Back then, she had thought that she was going to die anyway, so she could let Chuyan know the truth before she passed on. However, they had already been saved, so the situation was different.

A master stealing her disciple’s man? Just the thought was interesting. She could even potentially turn that into a great ordeal. How could she play such a trump card so easily? They had been as close as sisters before, but now that they were both safe, wasn’t Chuyan her rival again?

“Oh, I was thinking that Sect Master Yan seems to appreciate Ah Zu quite a bit,” Pei Mianman said with a smile.

Chu Chuyan couldn't help but chuckle, replying, “Master dotes on me quite a bit. Back then, she was scared that I would be fooled by a man, so she helped me keep an eye on him. Later, because of a series of events that took place over at Cloudcenter Commandery, they fought side by side. That’s how she came to understand Ah Zu better. Ah Zu is a very, very good person, after all. After being around each other for a while, it would be stranger if master didn’t appreciate him at all.”

“Oh my. Ah Zu really is a very, very good person. I am so envious!” Pei Mianman mimicked her and exaggerated her tone. Inwardly, however, she was thinking, What a scandal. He wouldn’t just take her to bed, right?

As a result, Chu Chuyan was really embarrassed and hit her playfully.

…

After messing around for a bit, Pei Mianman asked curiously, “I didn’t have time to ask you before, but it sounds like Ah Zu also came to this world, right?”

Chu Chuyan voiced her agreement. She explained Zu An’s bounty, as well as her conflict with the Gray Wolf Mercenary Group, and said, “I don’t know why Ah Zu would be in this secret dungeon either. He probably wanted to save us, since we didn’t come out after all this time.”

“Tsk tsk, that man really doesn’t treasure his own life. If I hadn’t been there, wouldn’t you have been done for? Ah Zu would definitely be frightened if he found out,” Pei Mianman said teasingly.

Chu Chuyan rolled her eyes and replied, “Isn’t my man also your man? On the contrary, if you hadn’t saved me…”

She was stunned and stopped midway through her sentence. The topic was a bit sensitive, so both of them tacitly decided to change it.

“Ah Zu really is a little rascal. Just how long has he been in this secret dungeon, and yet he already has a bounty on his head!” Pei Mianman remarked in annoyance. She knew just how terrifying the assassination order was.

“With his personality, it would be weirder if he didn’t provoke trouble,” Chu Chuyan remarked with a smirk. When she thought about everything she had gone through, she felt as if she had traveled back to the past again.

“It’s useless to think about all of this right now. Let’s reunite with him as quickly as possible and warn him to be more careful,” Pei Mianman said as she got up.

Chu Chuyan nodded. The two walked up to Baogu’s statue and bowed respectfully. “Thank you for saving our lives, senior. We will definitely help you with the task you have entrusted us with.”

The two women both felt a bit mournful. If not for the fact that she had decided to save them, Senior Baogu could have left this cave and met the immortal ruler again.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An’s group had just descended from the mountain and started moving in the great tomb’s direction. That was where Jing Teng’s body was. Suddenly, they sensed the earth trembling and mountains rumbling. A terrifying aura erupted by the great tomb. Then, a golden giant appeared in the sky.

Jing Teng’s face paled. She remarked, “I didn’t expect there to be someone this powerful in this world.”

Zu An and Qiu Honglei exchanged a look, both of them seeing the grave expression in each other’s eyes. The aura was just too familiar! It was Zhao Han’s power! It seemed they had to postpone their visit to the great tomb by a bit. Meeting Zhao Han head-on wasn’t a smart choice.

When she heard that the mysterious person was their enemy, Jing Teng exclaimed in shock, “You actually made such a formidable person your enemy? Most importantly, you were even able to survive.”

Zu An said impatiently, “Your enemies aren’t all that weak either, you know? That Ghost King and the Adventurer’s Guild Leader from before are both the strongest experts.”

Just now, even though Zang Ao had acted like an ordinary person who didn’t know cultivation, the moment he heard Jing Teng say Zu An was her man, the aura that had erupted felt as if a primordial beast were staring at the group. Even though it wasn’t at Zhao Han’s level, it wasn’t that far off. It was just that Zang Ao’s aura seemed a bit unstable, as if it didn’t truly belong to him.

When Zu An mentioned the prior events, Jing Teng quietly tugged at Qiu Honglei’s sleeve and asked, “What is that white-clad woman’s relationship with him? Why do I feel as if they have a thing?”

Qiu Honglei’s beautiful eyes immediately widened.
