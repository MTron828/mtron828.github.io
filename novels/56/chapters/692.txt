Chapter 677: Strange Peace

Translator: Pika

She could still tolerate it if this kid was disrespectful towards her. But now, he dared to publicly disrespect her like this?

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +999 +999 +999…

She really was angry now. After all, she had her fair share of blood on her hands as the Holy Sect’s secz master. She killed until rivers were formed out of blood when the court faced the Holy Sect in the past.

The temperature of the entire room dropped by several degrees. Zu An felt all of his fine hairs stand on end. He felt killing intent surge from the other party’s eyes.

He quickly explained, “It’s a misunderstanding! Big sis sect master, didn’t you say that my ki will surge when the seal is undone? I can’t control this!”

Yun Jianyue’s eyes narrowed. She indeed recalled this. This really wasn’t his fault. It wasn’t he who had strange thoughts towards her, but rather because of the ki suring within his body.

But why did she feel so unhappy when she thought of this?

She subconsciously lowered her head and scoffed inwardly, so ugly!

The ferocious thing remained in her head for a long time. She was finally convinced that Zu An wasn’t poisoned, but rather that he was just naturally like that. Those rapists from the past can’t compare at all…

Ah!!! Yun Jianyue, Yun Jianyue! What kind of nonsense are you spouting?! He’s so much younger than you, and also your disciple’s lover! Stop thinking about it, stop it, stop it!

She did her best to calm herself down. She turned him around with a smack to his body, and then continued to break up his seal.

Zu An sighed in relief. It looks like he made it through this trial! Little guy, little guy, do you know that you almost killed me just now?

He had his back towards her, so he didn’t notice that there was an abnormal redness by Yun Jianyue’s neck.

It wasn’t just him, Yun Jianyue didn’t notice either.

A while later, Yun Jianyue’s furrowed brows relaxed a bit. She was close to completely erasing the emperor’s seal.

She took a deep breath, and then she slowly transferred the energy that was scattered throughout Zu An’s body. She wanted to take out all of the emperor’s remaining power in one go.

However, when her energy surrounded that seal, it was as if the seal the emperor left behind knew about its situation. Its aura became much more powerful. This seal that looked like a surrounded worm suddenly turned into a roaring golden dragon. It immediately became much stronger than before.

How could the seal of the most powerful cultivator in this world not have any trump cards?

Yun Jianyue couldn’t help but remember Zu An’s ferocious scene when she sensed this massive dragon that just appeared. Her heart began to pound crazily. She quickly focused her attention.

But this moment of distraction created an opening for the emperor’s seal. It began to fiercely retaliate.

Pfft!

A mouthful of blood sprayed out of Yun Jianyue’s mouth. Her eyes were filled with horror.

The emperor was just too terrifying! This seal could actually use her ki to replenish itself! This meant that it would continue to grow more and more powerful! Most of the aura that was destroyed before was instantly recovered. Now, it was instead launching a counterattack on her.

If Yun Jianyue was at her strongest, then even if this seal had some tricks, it wouldn’t be able to injure her. However, she was already seriously injured, so her cultivation was greatly affected. It was now hard for her to withstand the retaliation.

She could even feel that this seal was about to enter her body and lock her up as well.

She was frightened when she saw this. She quickly used all of her strength to deal with this terrifying seal.

Unfortunately, the more she retaliated, the more nourishment the emperor’s seal received, which made it more and more powerful. But if she didn’t retaliate, then the seal would enter her body!

This was completely a two-fold poison! She was dead either way.

Yun Jianyue quickly thought about a way to deal with this. However, no matter what she tried, she could not stop the invasion of that golden power.

There was only one way, which was to directly explode Zu An’s heart. This way, their connection would be separated, and the emperor’s seal wouldn’t have any living organism to live off of. She would then be completely free.

But…

She remembered how she was seriously wounded by the emperor in the palace, and then it was this man who saved her when she was in a desperate situation.

Later on, he even taught her how to sleep in the air on a rope.

The two of them slept on the same bed.

He was willing to risk saving her sect’s members so that she wouldn’t have to be in danger.

…

She remembered all the things that happened between the two of them during this period. In the end, the ki that was transferred to her palm wasn’t released.

Forget it, he is Honglei’s lover. I cannot kill him and make Honglei resent me for the rest of her life.

She continued to tell herself this.

As for the emperor’s seal, she’ll just think of a way to get rid of it herself later.

Suddenly, she sensed a wave of power surge from deep within Zu An. Even though this power was rather weak, the level was extremely high, even much higher than her grandmaster cultivation. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

With the help of this power, it was as if there were suddenly reinforcements. The situation was suddenly reversed.

Yun Jianyue didn’t let such a great chance go. She guided this pure wave of power into her body, and then her entire body received nourishment. In the end, it condensed into an even more powerful force to retaliate against the emperor’s golden seal.

That golden seal was pushed back into Zu An’s body step by step. Yun Jianyue didn’t plan to let it go. It left her in such a sorry state earlier. She was definitely not someone who would just take that lying down!

That golden seal was pushed to the limit. It gave up on fleeing and retaliated with everything it had.

Yun Jianyue’s expression grew grave, because a large portion of power became the seal’s replenishment. With her current state, even after obtaining that mysterious pure energy’s nourishment, it was still difficult to completely neutralize this seal.

It would be really bad if she ended up just like how she was earlier.

When she thought of this, she decided to stop for now. She’ll help him eliminate this seal when she completely recovered from her injuries.

Right at this time, Zu An suddenly felt a swirling black hole like existence within him. There was a terrifying force that appeared.

Regardless of whether it was the golden seal or Yun Jiayue’s energy, everything was sucked towards that black hole.

“This is…” Yun Jianyue’s expression changed. She suddenly recalled the attack Zu An revealed when they first faced each other. This was precisely what her wounded self was almost defeated by in the rock garden.

She didn’t hesitate at all. She completely severed the connection between that energy and herself. Even though she would lose some of her cultivation this way, she could still slowly recover it later. She might just lose all of her cultivation instead if she tried to contend against that black hole.

This rascal, I’m helping him get rid of this seal, yet he’s actually trying to suck away my cultivation?

Yun Jianyue’s expression grew cold. She slowly raised her fingers and prepared to stab them into the back of his head.

But she was suddenly stunned, because she noticed that the other party’s eyes were closed. His body was shaking all over. He was unconscious.

Looks like the clash with the golden seal earlier knocked him out.

Yun Jianyue sighed in relief. She silently withdrew her long and slender fingers.

Not even she could stand against that golden seal’s retaliation, so how could Zu An possibly do it with his cultivation?

“Just what kind of crazy technique did this kid cultivate?” Yun Jianyue frowned. In that instant, she could feel that the energy the emperor left within his body was refined by that black hole in his body.

Hmph, this kid really did profit from our disaster.

Yun Jianyue didn’t want to stay here anymore now that she knew that his seal was gone. This man’s body was getting more and more stiff. This was especially the case after the last struggle. Right now, his entire body was releasing astonishing heat. She felt extremely uncomfortable being so close to him.

She got off the bed and prepared to leave. However, when she stood up, she suddenly felt light-headed. An unprecedented feeling of weakness spread through her body. She had suffered too much just now.

Everything in front of her eyes went black, and then she began to fall. However, she reacted quickly as well. She subconsciously reached her hand towards the bed to support herself.

What followed left her completely stunned. Zu An was roused awake by the stimulation. He lowered his head, and then he looked at the long haired beauty before him. The two pairs of eyes stared at each other. This entire room entered a strange moment of peacefulness.
