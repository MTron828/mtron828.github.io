Chapter 667: Suspicion Aroused

Translator: Pika

At this time, a delicate voice sounded from the side. “Sir Zu, why are you still here after such a long time?”

King Qi frowned when he heard this voice.

Zu An was immediately overjoyed when he heard the voice. He saw a beauty in a palace dress standing there, behind her a group of imperial guards led by Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun.

He quickly greeted them. “I greet the crown princess.”

Everyone from the Devil Sect lowered their heads as well. Gu Yueyi sneaked a look at her, and then his eyes widened.

The girls he spent his life around were all the flirtatious and witch-like sort. They were incredibly charming and lovely. However, in terms of class and elegance, none of them could compare to the girl in front of him.

He felt his throat go dry when he saw the graceful palace outfit and the lavish decorations. His heart began to pound. Holy sh*t, holy sh*t, how can someone be this pretty? Junior sis, it’s not that I’m not loyal to you, it’s just that this crown princess is too pretty!

It wasn’t that Qiu Honglei’s appearance was better than the crown princess’. In terms of beauty, this crown princess instead seemed to pale a bit. The key was that Gu Yueyi lived his life at the bottom levels of society, and he was always around the Devil Sect’s people normally. That was why this type of high class feeling was fatal against him.

Things like princesses, upper-class ladies, as long as their looks were about the same, these people were much more charming than the girls of the world of warriors.

The crown princess slowly walked over. There seemed to be a bit of sweet fragrance lingering about the air. This type of smell was different from the perfumes of brothels, but rather a high class smell. He couldn’t describe it in detail, but it smelled like burning silver.

King Qi’s attention shifted as well. He looked at the crown princess. “Linglong, why did you have the leisure to suddenly pay this place a visit?”

The crown princess was annoyed when she heard that he called her by her name and not the crown princess. He was clearly trying to exert pressure over her with his status as her senior. However, she didn’t act out and only replied, “I had Sir Zu take care of some matters, but he didn’t come back after so long. The palace has been rather restless after the assassins’ attack, so I was worried that he might have been attacked by someone with ill intent. That was why I decided to come here for a visit.”

Zu An felt warm inside. This woman acts fierce on the outside, but she’s not so bad inside after all, huh?

He saw Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun behind her as well. It was probably these fellas who warned the crown princess. I’ll take them to the government brothel once things calm down.

Everyone from the Devil Sect was incredibly shocked inside. They didn’t expect this young master Zu to already have so much status! Just how many days has it been since he entered the palace? Yet the Right Guard General was already calling him brother, and now the crown princess cared so much about him too.

Gu Yueyi was incredibly jealous. Zu An is only a bit more handsome than me, so why do all these pretty girls like him so much?

Junior sister is like this, and now even the crown princess is acting like this! How are the rest of us supposed to even live?

King Qi remained expressionless. However, he obviously knew that the other party was hinting towards him. “Sir Zu is someone who easily gains the favor of others after all. It’s only been a few days, yet Linglong is already taking such good care of him.”

The crown princess knew that the other party was implying that she was only doing this because he was handsome. She was furious and said coldly, “I will take care of everyone who works earnestly for the crown prince’s sake.”

King Qi chuckled and didn’t debate with her further on the topic. “This king merely wanted to invite Zu An for a chat. Linglong won’t mind, right?”

The crown princess chuckled. “King Qi, please feel at ease. I’ll just be waiting right here.”

She made it clear that she was watching, so he better not try anything.

King Qi laughed. He said to Zu An, “Sir Zu, follow me.”

Zu An bowed. “King Qi, please.”

King Qi nodded and walked towards the side on his own first.

Zu An gestured towards Sun Luzhen and the others, indicating for them to leave right away.

Sun Luzhen and the others weren’t stupid. They quietly withdrew using this chance. Only Gu Yueyi gave the crown princess one last reluctant look.

King Qi was already further away, and the crown princess’ group was watching Zu An, so no one was looking at them.

After walking a couple dozen meters, King Qi stopped by a rock garden. “Let’s talk here. Any further and Linglong will worry since she won’t be able to see you.”

Zu An replied in a standard manner, “The crown princess empathizes with us subjects.”

At the same time, he mocked inside, do you really have no understanding of yourself? The reason she is acting like this is because you killed without a second thought before.

King Qi sized him up out of curiosity. “Linglong has never cared so much about someone before. You’re a first.”

Zu An replied with silence. He suspected that the reason he said these words was to make him produce unnecessary delusions about the crown princess. If the crown princess actually fell in love with him, then that would be too great.

King Qi continued, “I heard that the Chu clan’s first miss took you in as a drafted son-in-law. I am quite surprised, as I’ve met that girl before. It isn’t going too far to call her a stunning talent. Everyone in the capital was wondering just who this outstanding girl was going to marry. When they learned that she was going to marry you, their eyes almost fell out of their sockets. I even found it quite surprising myself. But now that even the crown princess cares so much about you, it seems like there really is something special about you.”

Zu An revealed an embarrassed expression. “I’m really not as great as King Qi is making me out to be. Maybe I am a bit handsome, I’m pretty cool too I guess, and I am loyal, upstanding… The rest isn’t worth talking about, since I can’t compare to King Qi at all.”

King Qi’s eyelids twitched. For some reason, he really wanted to give this brat a beating whenever he spoke to him.

You have successfully trolled King Qi for +213 +213 +213…

He took a deep breath and suppressed the urges he felt inside, wisely choosing to change the topic. “What does Sir Zu think about the Cheng Xiong case?”

Zu An feigned naivety. “It hasn’t been long since I arrived at the capital, and I am merely a trivial small official. The amount of information I have access to is very limited. I really do not know the details of Sir Cheng’s case at all.”

King Qi couldn’t help but give him another look. There was something this shameless in this world?

If it wasn’t because the crown princess was watching nearby, he might just smack this kid dead.

You have successfully trolled King Qi for +300 +300 +300…

Even though he was usually shrewd and careful, he was really annoyed after experiencing this type of situation again and again. He said coldly, “According to what I know, it was only after those assassins met with Sir Zu that they decided to implicate General Cheng.”

Zu An was alarmed. This man’s sources ran deep, he had eyes even in the imperial prison.

He replied without batting an eyelid, “King Qi should know who the one who wanted to bring down General Cheng really is. I am but a small figure. How could I affect the greater situation on my own?”

King Qi gave him a look of surprise. “You’re quite daring. You dare to even say something like that.”

Zu An spoke with an honest face, “In front of King Qi, how could I dare to hide anything?”

King Qi smiled ambiguously. “Is that really true?”

Zu An slapped his own chest in assurance. “Of course it is! Heaven and earth can serve as witnesses.”

“Fine then. I just happen to have something I want to ask you about.” King Qi stared into his eyes. “Can the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra truly grant eternal life?”

Zu An revealed a forced smile. “His majesty has already informed the world. There is no need for King Qi to ask me.”

King Qi said coldly. “I am asking you to speak right now.”

Zu An immediately replied. “His majesty obviously cannot obtain eternal life through this technique.”

As for whether or not I can, I didn’t say anything about that.

When he heard the sincerity and assurance in his voice, King Qi was surprised. “Do you know that you might have just committed a capital offense if these words reach his majesty’s ears?”

Zu An revealed a forced smile and said, “King Qi is such a renown and wise sage. I believe you will not trouble me over such things.”

King Qi chuckled and gently patted his shoulder. “You have some prospects, kid. I am optimistic about you.”

Zu An’s expression changed. His eyes looked at his shoulder. Don’t tell me this is some bone melting palm or something, right? I won’t even know how I died if a grandmaster wanted to kill me.

“Hurry and go back. Linglong is already starting to panic.” King Qi said with a smile.

“Thank you, King Qi.” Zu An hurriedly left. The pressure he faced when being around this type of person was just too great.

When he saw that Zu An was far away, a finger appeared a zhang behind King Qi. King Qi’s smile instantly vanished. “Help me look into two things. The first is why the emperor would ask for Liu Chenyu, and the second is to help me keep an eye on Golden Token Eleven. For some reason, I feel like he and Zu An are the same person. The timing for these two’s appearance is a bit too odd.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The one in the shadows replied, “Understood!”
