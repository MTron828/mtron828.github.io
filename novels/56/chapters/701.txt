Chapter 686: I Mean, You Said It

Translator: Pika

You have successfully trolled Yu Yanluo for +222 +222 +222…

All women cared about their age. She was just watching from the side for fun, yet now, she was caught up in the drama too.

Uncle Fu’s expression also became extremely strange. It has already been so many years, yet this was the first time a man showed disdain towards the madam because of her age.

Did age even matter when the madam was that pretty?

Furthermore, she wasn’t even that old! She looked just like those other young ladies! Is this kid blind?

Murong Qinghe tugged on Chu Youzhao’s sleeves. “Your brother-in-law really is brave. He actually dares to say something like that, hehe.”

As someone who grew up in the capital, she obviously knew who Yu Yanluo was. Back then, her stunning looks were known throughout all of the noble circles. Just how many men of their father’s generation were bewitched by her looks?

Chu Youzhao’s eyelids jumped. “What brother-in-law? I don’t know who he is.”

This is too embarrassing! What the heck are you even bragging about? Did you really have to go this far?

You’re even saying how close you are with another woman in front of my face! How is my big sis supposed to feel?

King Qi’s heir was first stunned, and then he roared out with laughter. “You and Yu Yanluo are close? Hahaha, are you trying to make me die from laughing? Do you know what kind of person Yu Yanluo is? She is the number one beauty in this world! Back then, both his majesty and my father pursued… ahem…”

He realized that he had misspoken and quickly stopped himself. “If a goddess like her ended up liking an idiot like you, then I’ll do a handstand and eat sh*t right now!” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zu An curled his lips. “I mean, you said it.”

He fished out an entirely white jade pendant from his inner pocket. There were meticulous flower and animal decorations on it, and there was a ‘Yu’ character at the very center. “Do you recognize this pendant? This was the keepsake of love Yu Yanluo gave me. She normally always keeps it on her, but she can’t always be with me, so she gave me this so that it could be with me all the time in her place.”

He once saved Yu Yanluo from the hands of the Blackwind Stockade. She said that she would return the favor once she returned to Brightmoon City, but when he looked for her later on, he couldn’t find her at all. Furthermore, she never came back.

Didn’t this mean that she scammed him?

You can’t blame me then. I’ll just use her to make myself look good.

It was now King Qi’s heir, Chu Youzhao, and the others’ turn to be shocked. Even though they didn’t recognize this as Yu Yanluo’s personal keepsake, the ‘Yu’ character on the pendant was something they recognized. Furthermore, the decorations were the Yu clan’s crest that outsiders couldn’t fake.

“Wait, does brother-in-law really have a relationship with Yu Yanluo?” Chu Youzhao and Murong Qinghe looked at Zu An in shock. Both of their little mouths were wide open.

“How is that possible?!” Zhao Zhi was also shocked. In that instant, he even felt a bit of jealousy.

Who was Yu Yanluo? It might have been a while since she was the star of the capital, but she was the undisputed number one beauty!

Even his father pursued her yet failed! He had seen her a few years ago too. He could never forget her stunning features after that single glance. She appeared in his dreams countless times afterwards.

But he understood clearly that nothing would ever happen between someone like him and Yu Yanluo. That was why he only purely admired her.

If the goddess even he only dared to silently admire ended up liking a man who he looked down on himself, then wouldn’t he be so angry his insides would feel like it's exploding?

How is this possible?!

King Qi’s heir quickly snapped out of his daze. There was no way a goddess like her would like a drafted son-in-law like this. He took a deep breath and felt his rationality returning to him. He sneered and said, “You’re probably just saying any random Yu clan pendant is Yu Yanluo’s. Do you think I’ll believe you? Yu Yanluo would like you? Why don’t you look in the mirror once in a while!”

Murong Qinghe and Chu Youzhao nodded in sympathy. They felt like this was a reasonable explanation.

Only the driver with the missing tooth knew that this pendant wasn’t something an ordinary Yu clan member could have. It was indeed something the madam kept on her.

He looked towards the carriage with disbelief. “Madam, did you really end up liking that young man?”

The woman inside harrumphed. “Hmph, even you’re falling for his bluff?”

The driver with the missing tooth chuckled awkwardly. He should’ve been the first to reject this thought. After all, his madam hadn’t gotten close to any men in recent years. It was to the extent where she didn’t even give her nominal husband much attention…

Yet today, she was strangely interested in this kid named Zu An. That was why it wasn’t strange for him to become suspicious.

“Since the madam doesn’t have anything to do with him, then I will tear up his mouth so that he doesn’t ruin madam’s reputation.” The driver with the missing tooth said with righteous indignation.

“Forget it.” The woman in the carriage quickly said. “Let’s watch for a bit longer first.”

The driver’s eyebrows rose. Looks like this madam really did have a different relationship with this brat!

Zu An put away the pendant and said with disdain, “You really are jealous. If you don’t believe me, then go ask around in the Yu clan. However, I fear that you’ll refuse to believe it even if Yu Yanluo comes out herself and explains that to you, so you don’t have to do a handstand and eat sh*t.”

The young noble’s face immediately turned purple. “Hmph! I’m not going to waste words with you. Yu clan’s people will get their revenge on you later now that you’ve spoken behind Yu Yanluo’s back. Why don’t we talk about our thing.”

“What thing do we have between us? I am only interested in women. I have no interest in you no matter how pretty you are.” Zu An said with contempt.

King Qi’s heir: “……”

You have successfully trolled Zhao Zhi for +444 +444 +444…

He took a deep breath to calm himself down. He said with a snort, “You have a sharp mouth, but this is a world of cultivators where everything depends on strength. This young master will make you understand how big the world really is!”

Chu Youzhao’s heart began to pound nervously again. Everyone knew that King Qi’s heir had eight ranks of cultivation. Now that her brother-in-law completely offended him, would he really hold back?

“Hold on!” When he saw that Zhao Zhi was about to charge over, Zu An quickly raised his hands to stop him.

“What, scared?” King Qi’s heir sneered. He wasn’t in a rush to attack anymore. “If you are scared, then I’ll give you a chance. If you kneel and knock your head against the ground, then I can consider letting you go.”

He only said that he would consider it, not that he agreed to let him go. Once Zu An really did bow in front of everyone, he would then teach him how cruel this world really was.

Zu An said with a sigh. “I’m just worried that things will get annoying. What if I beat you up so badly that you run crying to your mom and dad later? Then this matter will never end.”

King Qi’s heir laughed in disdain. “I need to cry for help against trash like you?”

Even though Zu An’s cultivation was already quite impressive, in the eyes of an eighth rank cultivator, he could indeed only be considered trash.

“That’s hard to say, man. How about this? Let’s make a vow and have a fair fight. Neither one of us can get revenge on the other afterwards. What do you say?” Zu An wasn’t scared of this fella in front of him, but he had to consider the element of King Qi.

King Qi’s heir frowned. He was actually a bit moved by this suggestion. Zu An was a subordinate of the eastern palace after all. According to the reports of his spies, the crown prince and crown princess seemed to trust him a lot. It would indeed be a bit troublesome if the eastern palace’s side questioned him afterwards.

If this type of vow was made, then he didn’t have to worry about these consequences.

But why is this fella saying this? It feels like something is off…

When he saw that the other party went silent, Zu An began to spur him on. “What, the glorious heir of King Qi is scared of me? Whatever, you can just call your pops over and I’ll just have to deal with him.”

King Qi’s heir erupted with rage. “Me? Scared of you?!”

You have successfully trolled Zhao Zhi for +888 Rage points!

Even though his extraordinary background brought him endless benefits, it had its faults too. Everyone believed that everything he had was because of his father.

But he felt like he obtained his accomplishments on his own and that he didn’t abuse his resources. That was why he hated it when others thought that he completely relied on his father.

“If you want a vow, then a vow it'll be! You better not regret it afterwards.” King Qi’s heir knew that the other party was taunting him, but he didn’t care. This was a good chance to reduce his worries.
