Zu An smiled and said, “It’s not something I dealt with alone. Rather, we worked together to defeat it. Without your help, I would already have been cut in half by that monster.”

A grin appeared on the corners of Jing Teng’s lips. Her mood suddenly improved a bit.

Qiu Honglei bowed toward her and said, “Miss Jing, thank you for saving Ah Zu. I hope you won’t hold any grudges if I’ve offended you previously.”

For some reason, when she saw how Qiu Honglei looked at Zu An so sincerely, Jing Teng immediately felt a bit annoyed and said, “My choice to save him has nothing to do with you. Why would you need to thank me for him?”

Qiu Honglei raised a brow. Was this woman clearly stating some intent to go against her? She suddenly thought, Wait, why is the way she is talking so similar to Ah Zu’s?

Zu An coughed and quickly changed the topic. “What other monsters are left? Miss Jing, please give us a rough overview of this place so we aren’t suddenly caught off guard later.”

Jing Teng shook her head and said in frustration, “I don’t know either.”

Wei Suo voiced his surprise. “Huh? But didn’t you know about that Death Reaper? Why don’t you know anything else?”

Qiu Honglei also looked at her in puzzlement. This woman hadn’t seemed to say that much from the start until now. They had no idea just what kinds of things she was really plotting.

Jing Teng explained, “Previously, I already told you that my memories were incomplete, but I suddenly remembered some things when I saw that monster. It may be that I’ll only remember some things when we encounter other creatures.”

“So that was the case,” the others remarked, nodding inwardly.

Qiu Honglei secretly sent a voice transmission. “Ah Zu, this Jing Teng is a bit strange! If she really is just a vine that Immortal Ruler Baopu enlightened, isn’t this a bit too much?”

“It is indeed a bit strange. However, so far, she hasn’t seemed to carry any malice. We just need to be a bit more careful,” Zu An replied.

“How do you know that she doesn’t carry malice? Isn’t it just because she’s pretty?” Qiu Honglei harrumphed. Truly, emotions and the like really were strange. She had felt sincerely grateful that Jing Teng helped earlier, and yet now, she felt suspicious again.

When he saw the small amount of Rage points coming in, Zu An couldn't help but chuckle.

…

The group quickly continued into the great tomb. Its walls had all sorts of exquisite murals carved into them. They seemed to depict scenes of battles, journeys, and sacrificial offerings. Strangely, however, none of the figures had heads. If it were because of the erosion of time, it wouldn’t make sense for only the heads to have issues; but if someone had deliberately removed them, what was the meaning behind that?

“Miss Jing, do you know the story behind these murals?” Zu An asked, turning to Jing Teng, who was to him. Her cheeks looked as if they were drawn by a brush, and her skin was exquisite and flawless. Her brows were like umber mountains with spring waters. She really was pretty.

Qiu Honglei secretly perked up her ears too. Even though she was unhappy that they were chatting, she was also curious as to whether these murals had any secrets.

Jing Teng gently clutched her forehead and said, “No. I don’t have the slightest impression of these murals.”

“What’s wrong, Miss Jing?” Wei Suo couldn't help but ask when he saw that she was feeling uncomfortable.

Jing Teng shook her head and replied, “It’s nothing. I just have a slight headache.”

Zu An and Qiu Honglei exchanged a look. Could it be that as they entered the great tomb, she had begun recovering more and more of her memories?

Suddenly, Zu An shivered. All of his fine hairs stood on end. He looked into the distance with a grave expression.

A playful voice suddenly called out, “It truly is a small world, my great marquis.”

Zhao Hao was standing nearby, his hands behind him as he looked coldly at Zu An. Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing stood respectfully at his side. They were fully enjoying every second of the scene.

We can’t be the only ones to endure abuse! Brat, it’s your turn now!

When she saw Zhao Han’s group, Qiu Honglei’s expression became a bit bitter. After all, the Devil Sect opposed the court to begin with, and they had even launched an attack on the Imperial Palace. Now that they were meeting face to face, it boded ill.

Jing Teng didn’t recognize Zhao Han, but she could feel a profound and unfathomable power emanating from him. She also noticed that Zu An and Qiu Honglei’s bodies were completely tense. She had never seen them so nervous before.

“So it was your majesty. We truly do share some destiny. This world is so large, and yet we ended up encountering each other so easily,” Zu An said with a sigh. At the same time, he was curious as to why Zhao Han’s group was here. Weren’t they the first to enter the tomb? Why were they still here?

Jing Teng was alarmed. ‘Your majesty?’ There is no ‘your majesty’ in this world!

There had been an emperor in this world a long, long time before, but the world had already been broken up for quite some time. There were only kings of small nations left. Concepts such as commanderies, city lords, and emperors had quickly disappeared after the passage of time.

“You must have seen this emperor a long time ago,” Zhao Han remarked. He seemed to see right through Zu An’s thoughts and explained, “I did charge ahead in the beginning, but later, I noticed that there were many formidable restrictions and monsters. There were even some that would be a bit tricky for even this emperor. If I continued to run ahead, wouldn’t I just be working for those in the back? What right do those people have to make me do such a thing?”

“What your majesty says is true,” Zu An said, sighing in disappointment. “If you let those people go ahead, they can just scout out the way for you. Why didn’t I think of something like that?”

What kind of person was Zhao Han? He was an old fox who didn’t act without an incentive. How could he possibly work for another?

When he saw Zu An’s dejected expression, Zhao Han only felt incredibly pleased. He remarked, “This emperor also figured that since Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing were able to enter this world, your group would likely be here too. Furthermore, this great tomb was bound to be the most likely thing to draw the attention of the entire world, so I concluded that you must have arrived as well. As such, I decided to wait here. Lo and behold, you really did show up.” He then paused for a moment and looked around Zu An before asking, “Hm? Is it only the two of you? Where are the others?”

Zu An thought of something and quickly said, “We split up. They’ve already gotten further into the tomb. The libationer seemed to have discovered something.”

Zhao Han’s expression changed a bit, but he quickly said with a smile, “Brat, your words are always mixed with lies, as expected. You want this emperor to not tangle with your group and look for them instead, right?”

Xuan Bajing said in agreement, “That’s right! How could an insignificant talent like you possibly fool his majesty?”

Li Changsheng also said, “His majesty is wise!”

Zu An had a strange expression as he remarked, “Hey, for better or for worse, the two of you are grandmasters, and yet you’ve actually ended up becoming lackeys. Weren’t you two scheming to kill him not too long ago?”

He knew that Zhao Han already wanted him dead, so any further pretense of being a loyal subject would be useless. As such, he was already thinking of ways to save his skin.

Li Changsheng’s aged face heated up. He usually considered himself elegant and graceful, viewing his own conduct and deeds as those of an immortal. However, he’d had no choice but to serve Zhao Han this time, which inevitably affected his own dao heart somewhat.

“There’s no need for you to try and sow dissent between us,” Xuan Bajing said. In contrast, he was a bit more slick. He cupped his hands toward Zhao Han and said, “It was because of his majesty’s generosity that you overlooked our mistakes. The fact that we could serve your majesty is the greatest blessing.”

Li Changsheng almost threw up from those words. This guy was way too shameless!

Zhao Han wasn’t in a rush to act. He looked at Zu An like a cat playing with a mouse, saying, “The people of the world always said that you spent your days relaxed and carefree. Today, even this emperor is left in admiration. Just how long has it been? And yet, apart from the Devil Sect’s Saintess, you’ve managed to pick up another extraordinary beauty.”

Even though he was already old now and cared more about immortality, and women no longer moved him, he was still a man. He was the emperor himself, and yet even he didn’t have as many beauties as Zu An. He couldn't help but feel a bit unhappy.

Jing Teng’s face turned a bit red, but even after opening her mouth, she didn’t say anything else.

“Your majesty has misunderstood. Miss Jing and I don’t have that kind of relationship. Rather, she has a connection with this great tomb,” Zu An replied.

Jing Teng’s face paled. She suddenly looked at him. Don’t tell me this guy wants to sell me out in exchange for a chance of survival?!

Sure enough, Zhao Han was suddenly interested. He replied, “Oh? What kind of relationship does she have with this great tomb?” His voice carried a hint of doubt. Jing Teng looked a bit too young and weak, so it really was hard for him to imagine her having a relationship with this great tomb.

“If I’m not mistaken, what your majesty seeks is an immortal opportunity, the chance for eternal life. This Miss Jing just happens to have met the past Immortal Ruler Baopu,” Zu An said with a smile.

Jing Teng’s heart completely plummeted. She had already experienced betrayal in the past. Was she going to experience another one today? Why does it hurt a bit more this time…

Qiu Honglei looked at Zu An in confusion. She refused to believe that her lover was that kind of person. Could it be that he had thought of some solution? But Zhao Han was the publicly acknowledged strongest being in the world, and their side was far too lacking in comparison. Even if Xuan Bajing and Li Changsheng changed sides, they still wouldn’t have even a sliver of a chance! How could he have found a way out?

“Immortal Ruler Baopu!” Zhao Han exclaimed, his eyes lighting up. He looked at Jing Teng with a burning gaze. He had already spent some time in this world and naturally heard of the legends surrounding the immortal ruler. “If the lady can tell me everything related to Immortal Ruler Baopu, this emperor can consider letting those at your side go.”

Jing Teng replied coldly, “Whether they die or not has nothing to do with me. Why do I need to tell you anything?”

Zhao Han’s expression turned cold. When had he ever been refused so bluntly before? He raised his hand and prepared to restrain Jing Teng.

However, Zu An suddenly said, “Actually, it isn’t just his majesty alone who wants to obtain her. Even the Yin Yang Realm’s Ghost King has been looking for her the entire time. If I’m not mistaken, he should be in this great tomb too. Can your majesty win against the legendary Ghost King?”
