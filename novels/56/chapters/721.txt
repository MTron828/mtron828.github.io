Zu An’s first reaction was to teach the crown prince the way of guaranteed victory in five-in-a-row. After all, his age already completely studied this game. As long as he went first, he would definitely win.

But after thinking about it to himself, he still dispelled this thought in the end.

Even though five-in-row was easy, the sure-win method had all types of variations as well. If the crown prince could remember every choice he needed to make, then he wouldn’t be known as an idiot.

He thought for a bit, and then said, “With the crown prince as he is, we might have to cheat. What is he being tested on? We can give the crown prince the answers beforehand.”

The emperor replied, “The contents of the test have not been confirmed yet, but it will most likely be held by the Royal Academy. The academy’s staff are all stubborn and smelly like rocks in a latrine pit. They would never agree to helping the crown prince cheat. Your idea will not work.”

Neither side would be okay with the other side presiding over this test. Only the Royal Academy could receive the trust of both sides.

The Royal Academy had always remained neutral after both sides struggled for so long. They refused to join in on this struggle, but there was no need for them to participate either.

There were many outstanding cultivators who came out of the Royal Academy. They were scattered all across the world and had great status.

Regardless of who became emperor, it wouldn’t bring them any benefits, but it wouldn’t hurt them at all either. The people inside were all fanatical researchers without any interest in authority. It was to the extent where they believed that authority would only distract them from their cultivation.

It was precisely because of their zealotry towards cultivation that both the emperor and King Qi trusted that they wouldn’t act impartially.

Zu An frowned. “Then things are much trickier. Should we have someone pretend to be the crown prince and take the test in his place? Are there any miraculous transformation techniques?”

This was a world of cultivation after all. There should be a way to pass off as the crown prince.

The emperor slowly shook his head. “There is, but it can only fool those who are not familiar with the crown prince. King Qi’s faction will definitely investigate closely. I do not think this will escape their detection.”

Zu An shrugged his shoulders and spread his arms. “Then there’s really nothing I can do. Your majesty is powerful and brilliant. You will definitely think of a solution.”

“I don’t want to hear that pompous nonsense.” The emperor paced around in the imperial study with an annoyed expression. If even he was using crude words, then that means that this matter really left him really annoyed today. If his mood was bad, then that meant even more people would become unhappy. “I’m giving you half a month to think of a solution. Otherwise, if the crown prince cannot remain the crown prince, then there is no use for a crown prince secretary either. I’ll just throw you into the castration room.”

Zu An: “???”

Motherfucker! You’re making me do everything for you? Not even a production team would order their people like this!

Even though this was what he was thinking, he didn’t show any dissatisfaction on the surface. “Understood!”

…

Zu An felt extremely irritated when he left the imperial study. He walked out of the palace. Fuck the crown prince and princess! If there’s no choice, I’m just going to leave alone! The emperor might think that his seal is still in place, but he has no idea that a grandmaster already helped me get rid of it!

Hmph, I’m going home and embracing my lovely Chuyan! Like I give a sh*t if the crown prince dies or not.

A lesser eunuch ran over while he was thinking to himself. “Sir Zu, my clan’s master invites you for a meeting.”

Zu An was stunned. This lesser eunuch looked familiar. “Who is your master?”

“My master is Concubine Bai.” The lesser eunuch replied respectfully.

Zu An gave the dusky sky a look. “It’s already getting late. I don’t think this is a good time?”

Normally speaking, subjects cannot walk willfully around in the palace. Only a few officials had this authority, and most of them were like secretaries and assistants to the emperor’s everyday life.

Zu An could go as he wished with his status as the crown prince’s secretary, but that was limited to the daytime. He had to leave the palace once it got dark, or else that would be a huge crime.

If there were any subjects who were still inside the palace after it got dark, ahem, there probably isn’t a single emperor who is fond of being cucked.

“It’s related to the crown prince’s exam.” That lesser eunuch said.

“Lead the way!” After a bit of hesitation, he still followed this lesser eunuch. The emperor just gave him this mission with his life on the line. Even though he would run if he had no choice, it was best not to run away when he didn’t have to yet.

Concubine Bai was the crown prince’s concubine, so her rise and fall were tied to his. Her concern for the crown prince was real, so she might really have some ideas.

When they arrived at the Hundred Flowers Garden, the eunuch bowed before leaving.

A maid walked out from inside. It was precisely Concubine Bai’s personal maid Xin Rui.

“Sir Zu, this way please!” Xin Rui bowed slightly and invited him in.

Zu An couldn’t help but say, “Why didn’t I see you first? I almost thought that the eunuch was trying to harm me.”

Even though it never happened to him, he had seen more than enough examples of this. He didn’t watch those dramas for nothing.

Xin Rui covered her mouth and laughed in a bashful manner. “Sir Zu must be kidding. Who would be brazen enough to harm someone in the palace?”

Zu An thought to himself that the servant really was a reflection of the master. Concubine Bai’s personality was gentle and soft, Xin Rui’s nature was also similar, perhaps even a bit more bashful.

The crown princess was rather tough, and Rong Mo was also like a hot pepper.

While he was thinking random thoughts, he was soon brought into the main hall. Xin Rui gestured inside. “Sir Zu, please come in.”

Zu An nodded and walked inside. He had a good opinion of Concubine Bai the last time they met, and he also wanted to try that tea again. He wondered if he would have a chance to drink it again today.

He saw a beautiful figure seated at the other end of the table. Her posture was dignified, and her delicate body’s lines were incredibly charming. He quickly shook his head. Stop, don’t think that before I end up with some weird fetish!

But when he got closer and saw her appearance, he was stunned. It wasn’t that she was ugly, but rather that even though she was gentle, graceful, and poised, she wasn’t Concubine Bai at all.

This woman also looked at him in shock. Both of them spoke at the same time, “Why are you here?”

“Crown princess, why are you here?” Zu An asked in confusion.

The crown princess also harrumphed in annoyance. “I was the one who asked first.”

This kid really doesn’t follow the rules! I need to properly discipline him later.

Sigh, forget it. It’s normal for talented people to have a bit of pride. I don’t have too many people to use right now, so I shouldn’t chase him away.

Zu An wrinkled his nose. This woman was always so domineering. I’ll peel away your outer shell one day, let’s see if it’s still hard or soft inside. “Concubine Bai invited me and said that she had something to say about the crown prince’s matter.”

The crown princess frowned. “That’s what she said to me too.”

She suddenly got up and started to walk out after saying this.

After being in the palace for so long, she was naturally sensitive towards these matters. It was already dark outside, and there was no third person present. Being in the same room as another man would start a huge scandal.

But Xin Rui just happened to walk in with a cup of tea when she reached the entrance. “Huh? Crown princess, why are you suddenly leaving?”

The crown princess harrumphed. “What is Concubine Bai trying to do? Why isn’t she here yet?!”

She was the crown princess. When had she ever waited for a concubine?

However, Concubine Bai sent someone to pass on the message that there was a solution to the crown prince’s test. That was why she endured and came here.

But that woman invited a man here! Even though she was already familiar with Zu An, interacting in private like this still left her a bit uncomfortable.

Xin Rui explained, “Crown princess, please feel at ease. My master is currently preparing something and will come out soon. She told me to bring this Hundred Flower Tea to the two of you in apology.”

The crown princess subconsciously licked her lips when she heard the words Hundred Flower Tea. She naturally knew of Concubine Bai’s unique tea. She drank it a few times before and absolutely adored the flavor.

But because of her conflicting relationship with Concubine Bai, they didn’t get along with each other. She was also stubborn as well, so she naturally couldn’t lower her pride to ask for any. As such, she could only secretly long for it.

It would be a waste to not drink it since she is offering…

Pah! I am here because of the crown prince’s test, it’s not for drinking her shoddy tea!

“Fine then, I will wait for half a stick of incense’s time for her. I will immediately leave if she is still not here by then.” The crown princess sat down again and gracefully sipped on the fragrant tea. She sighed inwardly in praise. She really didn’t know how Concubine Bai made such a delicious tea! She had some maids try to imitate it in private, but it would always be sickeningly sweet, and drinking it just didn’t feel right. It lacked the natural simplicity and elegance of this Hundred Flower Tea.

A while later, she subconsciously tugged on her collar. She looked at Zu An and asked, “Do you feel like it is a bit hot today?”
