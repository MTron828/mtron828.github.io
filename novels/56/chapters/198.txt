Chapter 198: Double the Happiness

Translator: Pika

“Chuyan!” exclaimed Zu An in horror.

The severity of his injuries was enough to offset any enhancements he received from the effects of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, such that he couldn’t even draw his sword back properly.

The sword pierced into her chest, and a trail of blood began seeping out.

Zu An despaired, but all of a sudden, he noticed that the sword had come to a halt.

It turned out that her right hand also reached out to grab the sword, desperately trying to hold it in place. Or to be more exact, it was Mi Li who was trying to stop her from committing suicide!

It was yet another incredibly eerie side. One hand was trying to hold the sword back whereas the other was trying to push it in, resulting in a standstill.

Zu An found his head descending into a mess. He knew that this standstill wouldn’t last for long. He would have to kill her now, or else she would be overwhelmed by Mi Li soon enough.

But he really couldn’t do it!

“Is there anything I can do to save her?” Zu An racked his brain to see if there was anything he could do, but he had only transmigrated into this world not too long ago, so his knowledge was severely lacking. He had already used all of the tools he could in order to deal with Mi Li.

Wait a moment, there’s something which I haven’t used yet—’Knock-You-Up Eyes’! I still have one use of it. I nearly forgot that there’s still this skill.

However, his joy swiftly dissipated into despair. This skill still couldn’t save Chu Chuyan. All it could do was to inflict severe pain on Mi Li, perhaps opening a window of opportunity for him to kill her. If he really wanted to kill Chu Chuyan, he could have done it right here, right now.

He suddenly thought about the words the man in dragon robe told him in the seal. It seemed like he could use some sort of ‘purifying ability’ from the Primordial Origin Sutra, but the problem was that he didn’t know how it worked! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

So far, he had only learned how to channel the primordial ki to temper his body and recover his injuries. He hadn’t been taught anything about purifying at all.

Then, he thought about how he was able to reconnect Chu Chuyan’s ki meridians earlier.

Do I need to connect our bodies together in order to do the purification?

However, he soon shook off that thought. One must know that the man in dragon robe was likely to be Ying Zheng, and regardless of how their relationship was, it didn’t change the fact that Mi Li was his empress. Just how messed up did he have to be to tell another man to screw his wife?

At the very least, it didn’t seem likely for Ying Zheng to have any fetish about infidelity.

But how do I purify her then?

It was then that Zu An suddenly felt the pushing force on the sword growing stronger and stronger. Mi Li was clearly gaining ground here. He had to do something right away, or else it would be too late.

Forget it, I should just give it a try!

“Big sis empress, I’ve been going easy on you thus far, but it looks like I’ve no choice now,” said Zu An.

“You’ve been going easy on me thus far?” Mi Li burst into laughter.

Even Chu Chuyan and Qiao Xueying also widened their eyes, unable to comprehend what Zu An was intending by saying those words at a moment like this.

Zu An sighed deeply and said, “Since you know that I’ve learned the Primordial Origin Sutra, you should know from whom I’ve learned it too.”

“Ying Zheng!” exclaimed Mi Li in astonishment.

“Indeed. Not only has he imparted to me the Primordial Origin Sutra, but he has also told me the way to purify you!” said Zu An.

As expected, Mi Li’s face immediately darkened. She was so shaken that Chu Chuyan managed to garner greater control over the body, resulting in the sword being pulled even deeper into her chest.

Alarmed, Zu An quickly pulled the sword outward with all his might.

“...” Chu Chuyan.

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +250 Rage!

This bastard! It wasn’t easy for me to find an opportunity to make a move, but you’re foiling it right now!

“No, that’s not right. You would have done it earlier if you were able to purify me. There’s no need for you to sustain such severe injuries at all in the first place.” Mi Li soon found a gap in Zu An’s words.

To that, Zu An quickly replied, “What can I say? I’m a pervert. Big sis empress, how could a pervert like me possibly be willing to kill someone as beautiful as you?”

“...” Chu Chuyan.

“...” Mi Li.

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +333 Rage!

You have successfully trolled Mi Li for +333 Rage!

You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +256 Rage!

Zu An was quite curious as to why the Rage points he was receiving from Chu Chuyan and Mi Li were the same.

Could it be because they’re sharing the same body? What a pity it is that Chu Chuyan would soon die under Mi Li’s possession. If the two of them could share consciousness, wouldn’t it be double the happiness for me?

But speaking of which, why are you joining the crowd too, Qiao Xueying?

It took a bit of effort for Zu An to shrug off his miscellaneous thoughts and continue on, “Besides... we did have an intimate moment with one another. I’m not as heartless as you as to be able to turn against someone whom you were... tightly bonded with just a moment ago!”

“...” Chu Chuyan.

“...” Mi Li.

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +1024 Rage!

You have successfully trolled Mi Li for +1024 Rage!

You have successfully trolled Qiao Xueying for +1024 Rage!

This huge output of Rage points frightened Zu An.

What the hell! Why are they supplying me the same amount of Rage points all at once? Heh, this means that the excuse I’m spinning up works, right?

It was then that a resounding explosion sounded.

All of them quickly turned their heads over, only to see the lake not too far away bubbling furiously. The massive green lotus leaves had already vanished without a trace, and the entire underground cavern began shaking intensely. Bits of stone fragments fell to the ground from the ceiling.

“What’s going on?” asked Zu An.

“The ghosts are here,” replied Mi Li with a deep frown.

“???” Zu An.

Mi Li quickly elaborated, “Zhang Han has incited the death of the 200,000 elite soldiers of the Qin Dynasty back then. Afraid that these soldiers would rise as vengeful spirits to exact vengeance on him, he conspired with the Hegemon-King of Western Chu to use the lingering aura of my Soul Suppression Seal together with the Evanescent Lotus to set up a smaller Soul Suppression Seal to suppress those 200,000 evil spirits.”

Zu An was impressed. “Just the lingering aura of your seal is enough to suppress over 200,000 evil spirits? My gosh! You’re even more frightening than ghosts!”

“...” Mi Li.

You have successfully trolled Mi Li for +378 Rage!

“After you released the Soul Suppression Seal, the foundation of the smaller seal that Zhang Han had set up gradually lost its effectiveness,” replied Mi Li. “It’s all your fault! If not for your intervention, I wouldn’t have forgotten about this. I was going to leave here as soon as possible, but now I’m forced to deal with this trouble with you lot!”

Zu An rolled his eyes. “Are you saying that you’re afraid of those 200,000 evil spirits? I mean, those evil spirits were sealed with just the lingering aura of your Soul Suppression Seal!”

“Of course I wouldn’t be afraid of them if I was in my peak. However, the Red Tear of Lady Xiang has destroyed my body, and the current body I’m using is simply too weak. I won’t be able to cope with them in my current state.” Mi LI harrumphed coldly.

“...” Chu Chuyan.

She had been viewed as a prodigious cultivator even from a young age, an existence who towered over the others. This was the first time that someone had scorned her to be weak, and to make things worse, she actually couldn’t refute it.

How maddening!

“Why are you telling me all of this?” Zu An was perplexed as to why Mi Li was suddenly explaining all of this to him.

A commotion suddenly happened not too far away. The terracotta soldiers had also noticed the happenings over at the lake and quickly made their way over, but a large bunch of blue evil spirits abruptly rushed out of the lake and swiftly engulfed the first row of the terracotta soldiers.

While Zu An was dumbfounded by the sight, Mi Li’s voice suddenly sounded, “Why don’t we make a deal?”
