Chapter 1510: The Wind Is So Noisy Today

The Second Empress blinked her beautiful eyes. She discovered that in the end, she had still underestimated this man. Even though she knew he was really strong, killing Shi Zhentian with a single arrow was just too ridiculous. She had subconsciously attributed it to the power of the Sun Slaying Bow.

But now, Zu An had actually killed the great devil-like Sir Fu, who had already been infamous for so many years. Just what kind of concept was that?

Previously, when she only examined his ki aura, Zu An had seemed to only be at the early master rank in the hero form stage. She had been worried for him back then. Now, she only felt that he had to be trying to hide his power, deliberately keeping his cultivation lower. When she thought of that, Zu An’s presence instantly became much greater in her mind.

The young prince recovered from his alarm and quickly ran over to his mother’s side. He tugged on her sleeves and said excitedly, “Mother empress, mother empress! I want to be just as strong as adoptive father in the future!”

A look of surprise appeared in the Second Empress’ eyes. After all, in the past, the one her son had admired was his father, the late Fiend Emperor. However, the late Fiend Emperor rarely fought, so her son had never really witnessed his strength. That was why the shock of Zu An’s power was something he had no frame of reference for at all. She didn’t know whether it was a good or bad thing for her son to admire Zu An so much.

Yu Yanluo felt a strange sense of pride when she saw the mother and son’s expressions of shock and admiration. Is killing a grandmaster that special? In the Unknown Region, he killed the unrivaled Fiend Emperor. He even shot down the suns in the sky!

Qiao Xueying’s eyes shone as she thought, Ah Zu is so, so much stronger than before! Hmph, he actually hid it from me! I’ll definitely let him have it later! When she saw Yu Yanluo looking at Zu An with a proud expression, she couldn't help but feel a bit jealous. I clearly got here before you!

Chi Wen, who had fled into the distance, was absolutely horrified. I really was courting death before! I actually tried to steal the woman of someone this scary?

I was upset when little aunt made me compensate him with so many heaven-grade weapons. I thought little aunt and this guy had something going on between them, and thought she was trying to raise an outsider man using the Dragon Palace’s treasures. I almost thought she was betraying our people back then…

But little aunt was actually helping me! I had no idea that she saved my life!

Forget it, forget it, I’ll definitely stay far away from his women. Yup, I should just go after my Demon Race princess.

He looked dotingly at Princess Suolun, but what he saw was her star-struck expression as she looked at Zu An. He immediately suffered another mental blow.

She treated me so coldly when she looked at me. Isn’t she the proud and cold type?

She’ll excuse herself after just a few sentences with me.

But judging from how she looks right now, if Zu An started a conversation with her, she would probably be the one to invite him inside first!Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Screw all of you!

Sigh, what a shallow world. Thank goodness I’m so handsome I can still fight in this battle.

…

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen, who were fighting high up in the sky, had been paying attention to the situation below the entire time. When they saw Sir Fu suddenly attack Zu An, both of them were alarmed. They subconsciously wanted to save him, but their opponents kept them busy and didn’t let them go.

However, just as they were starting to feel worried, Zu An had already easily dealt with Sir Fu. There weren’t even any bones left.

The two women were a bit speechless. Yun Jianyue struggled a bit as she sent a ki transmission. “Stone cold woman, is this that so-called ‘unrivaled conviction’?”

Yan Xuehen was also a bit stunned. In her mind, even though Zu An had unexpectedly nurtured the belief that he was the strongest in the Unknown Region, something others could take centuries to grasp, he still had to borrow the power of the Sun Slaying Bow because of his own low cultivation rank.

And yet, he had defeated a grandmaster bare-handed, just like that? How was this possible?!

Was all of the common sense I developed over the years wrong?

Is there something wrong with us, or is there something wrong with the world?

Seeing as Yan Xuehen didn’t reply, Yun Jianyue asked, “Stone cold woman, say, if we were to fight him, who would win?”

A bitter smile appeared on Yan Xuehen’s face as she replied, “I do not know.”

She really didn’t know. At first, even though Zu An did have unrivaled conviction, they had thought they knew enough about Zu An’s various skills. As long as they watched out for them, winning against him wouldn’t be too difficult. However, after witnessing Sir Fu’s tragic death, that belief wavered.

…

The two female grandmasters weren’t the only ones who witnessed the scene. The Second Prince’s subordinates witnessed it too.

Heichi Suiya, in particular, was also someone most people viewed as a devil. His cultivation method shared some similarities with Sir Fu’s, so they had often shared their feasting experiences with each other. He naturally knew that Sir Fu’s cultivation might even have been a bit higher than his own. And yet, someone so terrifying was disposed of so easily. What the hell was he still fighting for?

The only reason he had sided with the Second Prince was because he was fed well and didn’t have to constantly be on the run anymore. As such, he didn’t have any desire to fight anymore. He found an opening to slip away, then fled for his life.

Hu Qianxiao knew fighting Heichi Suiya wouldn’t end without serious injuries. Thus, he didn’t stop him.

While running away, Heichi Suiya ran into the Second Prince’s camp. When he saw the soldiers in his way, his bloodthirsty nature filled his mind. He opened his mouth and swallowed up hundreds of elite soldiers in a single gulp. Panic quickly spread through the entire camp.

The Second Prince’s eyelids twitched when he saw that. Just what kinds of bastards had he ended up raising?!

He had invested so much and sacrificed countless lives to raise these two devils, and yet one was killed instantly, while the other ran from his fight. Not only that, the latter had even eaten his own troops, causing his army to become disorderly!

Unfortunately, there was nothing else he could do. These two were too strong, so he had to treat them politely. If Heichi Suiya wanted to run, the prince couldn't stop him either.

…

However, just because the prince couldn't stop him, that didn’t mean Zu An couldn't.

At that moment, Zu An felt as if he were filled to the brim with energy. A burst of sinister energy suddenly spread across his chest. He knew it was probably because of the impurities formed from Sir Fu absorbing the blood essence of too many people.

He just happened to see Heichi Suiya swallow up several ordinary people. If he let this kind of monster go, who knew how many innocent lives would be harmed? As such, he picked up the Sun Slaying Bow. The Rune Weapon Chart produced a white arrow, and he fired it at the back of the opponent’s head.

The fleeing Heichi Suiya was alarmed. He reflexively turned his head, and for the first time, he saw a shooting star from up close. When he saw that there was no way for him to avoid it, he opened his mouth to bite it. All of his cultivation was focused on his teeth. He could even bite through a mountain, so he was confident he could stop the attack.

However, he split apart…

A blazing radiance rushed through him. His entire body exploded into a blast of light, turning into a dazzling meteor shower.

The fighting by the palace gate had already reached its most intense point. Most people were only focused on the enemy in front of them, and thus, not many people had witnessed Sir Fu’s death.

However, this scene was just too blinding, drawing the attention of all those present. They saw Heichi Suiya explode, and the entire battlefield instantly fell dead silent.

The Second Prince’s heart beat crazily. He suddenly realized that the reason why he was able to successfully kill the crown prince was because there had been a ‘shooting star’ like that in the Imperial Palace’s direction that distracted the crown prince.

That light had actually been fired by Zu An? Sir Fu had been killed in a single attack, and Heichi Suiya had been shot down by a single arrow?

The ground clearly wasn’t moving, but he felt as if his body were swaying from side to side. Was there something wrong with this world?

Above the palace gate, Zu An felt as if the explosive and chaotic ki inside him had become much more comfortable. However, it still hadn’t become completely peaceful yet. Thus, he raised his head. Another white arrow appeared, and he aimed it at Duantian Chou, whom Yan Xuehen had begun fighting[1].

Duantian Chou was horrified. He had been paying attention to the fight below too, and just happened to see Heichi Suiya die from a single arrow. Then, he saw another shooting star rushing at him. All of his ki was being locked onto. He couldn't avoid it at all.

He knew he probably couldn't stop its power either. However, the Dark Elves were famous assassins with unmatched escape abilities. He bit the tip of his tongue and sprayed out a streak of blood essence. Then, an identical clone remained where he was, while the other copy rushed into the distance.

A blinding streak of radiance passed. His substitute was blown to pieces, while his main body also coughed out a mouthful of blood. He had used an ultimate last resort skill that consumed half of his blood essence. He wouldn’t use it except in a situation where he would otherwise die for certain.

However, he had managed to survive.

Hmph, just wait until I recover. Then, I’ll slowly…

Huh? Why are my surroundings so weird?

The black vortex hadn’t brought him away. Instead, he had entered a mysterious space.

“A Beauty Mirror?” Duantian Chou screamed in alarm. He immediately realized what this was.

The onlookers noticed that the vortex Duantian Chou created had suddenly turned into a mirror. Then, the handsome Great Elf King appeared. He reached out his hand, and the mirror quickly shrank. He picked it up and admired his own reflection. At the same time, he used his hand to sort the hair by his temples, saying, “Oh my, the wind is so noisy today. This king’s hair was almost ruined.”

1. The author actually made an error here initially, as Duantian Chou was previously fighting Yun Jianyue and Sixth Uncle was fighting Yan Xuehen. The only way it would make sense is if they switched targets, so the line was changed a little to reflect that. ☜
