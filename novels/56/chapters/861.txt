Chapter 833, (1): Hunter and Prey

A malicious grin appeared on Wei Pingyang’s face when he saw Zu An wrapped within his technique. “Just go to hell!” he exclaimed.

The flying sword in his hands vibrated with noise, and white mist suddenly emerged from behind it. Immediately afterward, an ear-splitting boom followed. This was a result of the flying sword breaking the sound barrier!

Furthermore, Zu An was currently trapped in his technique right now. Wei Pingyang smirked. Once this guy died, he didn’t have to worry about anyone else on the crown prince’s side. Even though he had lost a life saving treasure, that pitch-black dagger was definitely more than enough compensation.

Suddenly, a terrifying pressure surged from Zu An’s position. Even Lu Xiao, who was focused on recovering, couldn’t help but open his eyes in shock as he looked in Zu An’s direction. How could there be such a terrifying pressure? Even he felt an urge to kneel.

As the main target of the pressure, Wei Pingyang was affected even more. His entire body turned deathly pale, and he began to shake uncontrollably. His knees buckled, and then he dropped from the sky, kneeling on the ground.

This was the Tai’e Sword’s Domain of Power!

Zu An felt the pressure around him immediately lessen. He didn’t hesitate and charged straight at Wei Pingyang. He could only use the Domain of Power once, as it had a long cooldown. He obviously couldn’t waste this opportunity.

However, a figure flickered in front of Wei Pingyang, blocking Zu An’s strike of inevitable death for him.

Zu An was stunned. This person was another of King Qi Manor’s guardians, Mu Ping. Why would he step out just then to block this blade for Wei Pingyang? Were the guardians that close to each other? He should have hesitated for a moment even if Wei Pingyang were his own father, right?

While Zu An was confused, Mu Ping didn’t look at him. Instead, he turned to look at Wei Pingyang, murmuring, “You…”

Unfortunately, the Poisonous Prick’s curse had already activated. Mu Ping’s entire body was covered in black runes and he perished.

Meanwhile, Wei Pingyang finally recovered given the opportunity. He was a master rank cultivator, after all. Even something like the Domain of Power could only make him lose his composure for a moment. He controlled his flying sword, sending it at Zu An’s wrist.

Zu An quickly pulled back. Unfortunately, he was still a bit too late. He felt a sharp pain from his left hand, and then he could no longer hold onto his Poisonous Prick.

“Hahaha, your wrist’s tendons have been cut!” Wei Pingyang exclaimed, still feeling some lingering fear. He had never expected that a glorious master rank cultivator like him could have almost died twice because of this opponent.

Zu An clutched his wrist and remained silent. If it were anyone else, that entire hand would have been lost after being struck by the flying sword. However, his body was tough enough that it hadn’t crippled him. But he didn’t expose that fact and instead planned to use it to fool his opponent. He was going to use it to give Wei Pingyang a surprise later.

What he couldn’t understand was why Mu Ping would block that blade for Wei Pingyang. Otherwise, Wei Pingyang would already be dead.

Fortunately, Lu Xiao helped clear up Zu An’s doubts by exclaiming, “Wei Pingyang, you actually set up a puppet curse on Mu Ping?”

He Li stayed far away, his eyes full of anger and fear as he looked at Wei Pingyang.

A puppet curse, as the name stated, would turn someone into one’s puppet. Nothing strange could be detected normally, but if their master’s life were in danger, they would immediately prioritize saving their master over everything else.

The skill was incredibly vicious, and its conditions were also harsh. That was why it had always been denounced by the world. Those who practiced this technique had practically all been wiped out. No one had expected King Qi Manor’s guardian Wei Pingyang to possess such a malicious skill.

Wei Pingyang said indifferently, “If I hadn’t just happened to pick up this skill, I would’ve already been done in by that brat. If I died, Brother Lu, you wouldn’t have any chance of living either.”

His vigilance had increased greatly when his life saving pendant broke. He had been worried that the opponent might have some other unpredictable skills, so he’d decided to use the puppet curse on Mu Ping, who was closest to him.

Among the guardians, his relationship with Mu Ping was quite good, and he understood the other person’s cultivation the best. Mu Ping didn’t have any reservations against him either, making the curse easier to apply. If he had used the puppet curse on anyone else, unless their cultivation was as high as Mu Ping’s, the effects definitely wouldn’t have been as good.

Lu Xiao didn’t say anything in response when he heard those words. He was at a key point in his recovery. If Zu An had killed Wei Pingyang and then attacked him, he wouldn’t have been able to stop him at all.

Wei Pingyang continued, “With things already as they are, it’s meaningless even if you blame me. We need to kill this little bastard first, then complete the mission our king gave us.”

Lu Xiao nodded. “You’re right. Completing the king’s mission is top priority right now. He Li, what are you dilly-dallying for? Why aren’t you dealing with that woman and chasing after the crown prince?!”

He Li was quite troubled. Even though the woman was only at the sixth rank, which man would be able to resolve to kill someone like her?

But when Lu Xiao spoke King Qi’s name, he couldn’t argue against it. He could only harrumph and say, “I’ve got it already.”

He was an expert at the peak of the ninth rank. Once he became serious, Daji would be in great danger. If not for her beauty that naturally made men hold back, she would have already died many times over.

Zu An knew that keeping Daji here wasn’t a solution and quickly gave her an order. She brought out a pipa and gently plucked the strings. Voice of the Devil’s music spread outward. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Those from King Qi Manor who had lower cultivation suddenly turned their spears on their comrades. The battlefield quickly became chaotic.

Meanwhile, a large group of beasts suddenly appeared in their surroundings. Even though the strongest were only beasts on the level of Giant White Wolves, their numbers were too great. They immediately charged at the people there, sending blood and flesh flying everywhere.

“What the hell is going on?” Those from King Qi Manor were alarmed. Even Lu Xiao and Wei Pingyang were confused.

They were able to understand why their companions had suddenly gone crazy; that was probably because the ridiculously beautiful woman had used a charming technique. But what about these beasts? Why had they run out?

They obviously couldn’t have known that it was the result of Zu An using his jade badge to control some nearby creatures to disturb the nests of vicious beasts and bring them over. Unfortunately, there was a limit to what his jade badge could control. Otherwise, he might even have been able to win against these people from King Qi Manor if he could control a huge army of beasts.

As he was helpless to do anything about the situation, He Li couldn’t be bothered with Daji. He had to calm the disturbance first, or else they might not have enough men to hunt down the crown prince’s people afterward.

He had thought that he could defeat Zu An, but even the master rank Wei Pingyang had almost died twice. He shivered when he thought about that. He decided to just leave the little monster for a master rank cultivator to deal with.

“Damn, kid, I have to admit that I underestimated you. You were able to pressure us this far with your insect-like cultivation! However, all of this ends here.” Wei Pingyang stared at Zu An with his sinister eyes. With a raise of his hand, the Poisonous Prick that had fallen to the ground was sucked into his hand. “This thing is mine now. I want to see just what other tricks you have left.”

“Idiot.” Zu An sneered. With just a thought, the Poisonous Prick returned to his keyboard space. He felt a bit of regret that he couldn’t control the Poisonous Prick like a flying sword, or else this battle would have already been finished if he could make a cut in Wei Pingyang’s hand.

Wei Pingyang didn’t become upset when he saw the dagger disappear into thin air, and instead felt even happier. He exclaimed, “So it’s a treasure that’s bound to a master! It is a divine weapon after all, hahaha! As long as I kill you, the dagger will be mine!” After he finished speaking, he no longer stood there calmly. Instead, he used his hand as a sword and charged at Zu An.

“Fast!” Zu An felt a chill. He quickly evaded, but even though he used the Sunflower Phantasm and split into three identical copies that ran in three different directions, Wei Pingyang still easily saw through it.

Wei Pingyang roared with laughter. “Those tricks are useless before the divine will of a master!” As he spoke, the flying sword attacked Zu An from all sorts of different directions, as if two master rank cultivators were attacking at the same time.

How could Zu An possibly stop them? His body was soon covered in blood.

“Oh? Your body seems to be quite sturdy. You can still hold on even after taking so much damage.” Wei Pingyang sneered. “But it’s all over now. Let’s see if you can still continue fighting after having your heart pierced through.”

His speed suddenly increased as he stabbed toward Zu An’s chest.

At that instant, Zu An felt as if no matter which direction he dodged in, this sword would still hit his heart.
