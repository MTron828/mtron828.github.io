Chapter 1776: Original Body

When they saw him remain quiet, Qiu Honglei and Yan Xuehen’s eyes became colder and colder.

You have successfully trolled Qiu Honglei for +444 +444 +444…

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +444 +444 +444…

Zu An grimaced inwardly and quickly said to the two women, “This is a misunderstanding. I’ll explain everything to you in detail after.”

A sneer appeared on the two girls’ faces. They clearly didn’t trust what he said.

Zu An sighed. He told Jing Teng through voice transmission, “Miss Jing, you’ve really put me in a bad situation here…”

Jing Teng gave Qiu Honglei a look and saw that she was about to erupt like a volcano. She couldn't help but grin. At the same time, she found it a bit strange. Why is that white-clad woman showing me such hostility?

She couldn't help but ask the middle aged man, “Zang Ao, is this your new lover?”

Yan Xuehen’s expression turned cold when she heard that. She became even angrier.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +500 +500 +500…

Zang Ao quickly waved his hand and said, “You’ve misunderstood. Miss Yan is nothing more than a friend I invited for assistance. We don’t have that kind of relationship.”

Jing Teng didn’t believe him at all and turned to Yan Xuehen, saying, “This lady seems to be quite exceptional, so I really don’t wish for you to get stuck in the mud pit that is this man. He has the ambition of a wild wolf and isn’t the kind sort. You absolutely can’t be deceived by him.”

“I have nothing to do with him,” Yan Xuehen said coldly.

Jing Teng was stunned, and she could sense that Yan Xuehen wasn’t lying.  Then why do you bear so much hostility against me?

Zang Ao smiled and said, “I’ve been quite broken-hearted over the years, but I hadn’t expected Tengteng to actually become jealous because I have other women at my side. I suddenly feel a bit happy. You even brought a man with you to pretend to be lovers to make me upset. As expected, you’re just as mischievous as ever.”

Qiu Honglei and Yan Xuehen both sighed in relief. They had really gotten too worked up out of concern. After thinking about it for a bit, they had also realized that this woman was just using Ah Zu to anger her previous boyfriend. Even if they didn’t believe her, they should have trusted Ah Zu! He wasn’t some male stallion protagonist; how could he possibly get another woman this beautiful so quickly?

Jing Teng looked at Zang Ao as if he were an idiot, replying, “Aren’t you a bit too narcissistic? Is there a need for me to lie to you?” Then, she grabbed Zu An’s arm and continued, “Big brother Zu treats me really well, and I love him a lot. The two of us are perfect lovers, and I’m already his.”

Zu An was stunned, Sis, you can’t say things like that! You’re asking for my very life here!

Yan Xuehen and Qiu Honglei had felt as if they had blamed Zu An wrongly, and yet this explosive news appeared a moment later. They were completely stunned.

She’s already his?

Yan Xuehen thought, Zu An really is a scoundrel! He clearly already has Qiu Honglei at his side, and yet he was still unfaithful! Also, what the heck is up with Yun Jianyue’s disciple? She was supposed to be the Devil Sect’s witch, but why can’t she even keep a leash on her own man, letting someone else steal him so easily?

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +911 +911 +911…

Qiu Honglei’s eyes were also wide open as she thought, I was always with Ah Zu; when did these two end up getting together? Was it after I fell asleep? She didn’t doubt what Jing Teng said, because the other woman had always been rather proud during the trip. She definitely wouldn’t joke around with her own purity.

Ahhh! This woman is so shameless!

You have successfully trolled Qiu Honglei for +748 +748 +748…

When he saw Zu An’s arm buried in Jing Teng’s soft chest, Zang Ao began breathing rapidly. Jing Teng had never been this close to him before! He stared at Zu An and said, “Good, very good.”

You have successfully trolled Zang Ao for +444 +444 +444…

Then, he did his best to sort out his feelings before looking at Jing Teng and asking, “Did you come all the way back here to look for your original body?”

“What, are you going to stop me?” Jing Teng retorted, giving him an indifferent look.

Zang Ao released a deep sigh and replied. “Even though you hate me, how could I do something that would harm you like that? I was muddle-headed in the past and regretted what I did… Forget it, you might not even want to hear about those things. I’ll bring you there.”

Afterward, he led the way, and they soon arrived at the rear courtyard of the residence. He took out a token and pushed it into the air. Then, a translucent barrier appeared around the area. The scenery nearby changed, and the ruined place overgrown with weeds disappeared and was instead replaced with a beautiful flower bed.

Zu An was stunned. This was most likely some kind of profound diversion. If Zang Ao hadn’t personally undone it, outsiders would have a hard time finding this place.

The flower bed was full of luxuriant flowers, and butterflies fluttered in the air. There was a small and exquisite grave at the center. Zu An reflexively gave Jing Teng a look. This was most likely her grave.

Zang Ao brought them to the very center. There was a tombstone over the grave that read ‘Grave of My Beloved Jing Teng’. The tombstone was full of candles and ritual money. All sorts of fruits and food had been used as an offering.

Zang Ao gently caressed that tombstone. His voice was full of sorrow as he said, “I always came here to sweep your tomb year after year on the anniversary of your death, and I lived here to keep you company for a few days. I knew you always feared loneliness the most and loved liveliness.”

Zu An and the others couldn't help but give Jing Teng a look. She had clearly lived so deep in that old forest and looked as if she didn’t want anyone near her. And yet, she was actually someone who liked noise and excitement?

Zang Ao smiled and said, “I didn’t expect to meet you here. I’m beyond happy to see that you are still alive.”

Qiu Honglei thought to herself, This guy is quite the sentimental sort. Why isn’t Jing Teng following him, and is going after my Ah Zu instead? So annoying.

Yan Xuehen nodded inwardly. During the trip, she had seen that Zang Ao could still be considered a gentleman. So why had these two ended up in such a conflict? More importantly, Zu An was actually involved. Truly annoying.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Jing Teng didn’t pay Zang Ao’s behavior any attention; instead, she stared straight at the tombstone. Suddenly, a whip appeared in her hands and lashed toward it. The tombstone instantly broke apart into pieces, turning into rubble.

“What are you doing?!” Zang Ao cried, his expression changing greatly.

“The words were irritating,” Jing Teng calmly replied.

Zang Ao was speechless.

The whip lashed out again, and the grave also split apart. Zang Ao could no longer hold himself back and stood in front of her, exclaiming, “Are you mad? This is your tomb!”

Jing Teng looked at him as if he were an idiot, replying, “Am I not alive? What would I need this grave for?”

Zang Ao was stunned. In that instant, he didn’t even know how to reply.

Jing Teng didn’t pay him any attention, and reached out a hand instead. Vines surged from all directions and stabbed into the tomb. The dirt was ripped apart, revealing a coffin within. With a wave of Jing Teng’s hand, the cover flew away.

The others reflexively craned their necks to see what her original body looked like. Was it the same as her current self, or was it just a set of dried bones now?

Surprisingly, however, the coffin was empty. There was nothing inside at all.

Jing Teng turned to Zang Ao and snapped, “I demand an explanation!”

Zang Ao was stunned. He quickly ran over to the coffin and ran his hands around the inside, but there was nothing. He exclaimed, “How is this possible? I personally buried you back then!”

“There are even special formations in place outside. Apart from you, no one should be able to enter,” Jing Teng said, her expression completely cold.

Zang Ao hurriedly explained, “I don’t know what’s happening right now either. You know I didn’t cultivate in the past, so only later did I find someone to set up the formation. I believe someone likely used that opening to steal your body away.”

“This place was a secret to begin with, and there are all sorts of formations outside. Apart from you, who else could have stolen it?” Jing Teng replied with a sneer. She clearly didn’t believe him.

“Could it have been Sun En? He knew that you were here. Or maybe…” Zang Ao started muttering in a panic, seeming to have thought of something. He quickly said, “Tengteng, I’ll get to the bottom of this and give you an explanation!” He hurriedly left afterward, clearly to investigate something. With his current status and position, it wouldn’t be too difficult to look into anything.

Yan Xuehen walked over to Zu An’s side. She looked at him with an ambiguous smile and said, “I didn’t expect you to be this skilled.”

Zu An had a huge headache. He hurriedly explained, “This is a misunderstanding. Actually…”

However, Yan Xuehen stopped him from continuing. He quickly said through voice transmission, “We’ll talk about other things later. Zang Ao is the Adventurer’s Guild leader and has ears everywhere. I’ll try to find out who put you on the wanted list from that side, and see if I can clear your name.”

“I don’t need…” Zu An called out after her, but she was quite stubborn. Together with the anger boiling within her, how could she possibly hear him? She had already vanished into the distance.

Jing Teng looked at the two of them in confusion. This goddess-like white-clad woman actually knew Zu An? She suddenly sensed a tangible killing intent. It turned out Qiu Honglei was glaring at her with unkind intentions.

Zu An could sense that hell on earth was about to ensue and quickly changed the topic, asking, “By the way, what is going on with your original body? Why does it seem as if you don’t actually care about it that much?”
