Chapter 1638: An Impossible Mission

Sir Huo turned around. He suddenly saw an Embroidered Envoy sitting by the window, whose outfit didn’t look quite the same as those of the other Embroidered Envoys. When he examined the patterns up close, he discovered that they were actually dark gold.

“Golden Token Envoy!” Sir Huo muttered, his pupils narrowing. With his status, he naturally knew about the prestige of a Golden Token Envoy.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I came here to ask you a few questions this time. I hope you will cooperate,” Zu An said casually, as if he were talking about something absolutely trivial.

Sir Huo laughed out of annoyance, retorting, “What, you think I have to answer just because you ask a question?” An ordinary person would indeed fear the Embroidered Envoy, but people like him always wandered along the border of darkness. He even had the support of King Yan, so why would he be scared?

“I am only informing you. You do not have the privilege to refuse,” Zu An said, glancing at the other Embroidered Envoys. Their expressions continuously changed, but apart from being unconscious, everything else about them was completely normal. They seemed to be experiencing some kind of nightmare.

Sir Huo roared with laughter, as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world. He said, “You should have moved together with them just now. Then, I might really have been taken down.”

Now that it was just one-on-one, he wasn’t scared of anyone. Furthermore, this person didn’t seem to have any great ki aura coming out from him, so he was probably one of the weaker ones among the Golden Token Envoys.

“There was no need,” Zu An said indifferently. The main reason he had done so was because he had wanted to personally witness the mental attack first. Otherwise, if he encountered someone who specialized in this field in the future, he could end up being caught off guard. Furthermore, he had really wanted to know whether or not Sir Huo had the ability to subdue Golden Token Seven.

“How arrogant!” Sir Huo snapped. The patterns on his forehead activated again, forming a vertical eye. It released a strange light in Zu An’s direction.

Zu An felt his vision blur. The interesting and appealing environment of Wishes Fulfilled was replaced by several massive concrete buildings. All sorts of cars filled the roads, and from time to time, he could even see trams moving in his direction from afar.

The streets were so packed with pedestrians that shoulders often brushed and feet were stepped on. Women were dressed in light and fashionable clothing, while men… well, in comparison, they seemed not to care that much about their outfits.

Nearby, commercials depicting all kinds of celebrities played on the digital screens of shopping malls. Even Zu An’s favorite, Xiaolongnu, was there…

This illusion really is formidable; it can even make these things? Zu An thought with a sigh. He said, “This world really is nostalgic… If I hadn’t been prepared for this, I might have been completely lost here.”

As soon as he spoke, he drew his sword and brandished it. Sword ki slashed outward and covered the entire world. The entire world began to shatter, and Wishes Fulfilled reappeared in front of him.

Sir Huo’s eyes were filled with alarm. He clutched the eye on his forehead, and blood seeped out between his fingers. His other hand shook as he pointed at Zu An, muttering, “You… Just who are you?”

The power of that sword had actually destroyed the illusion he created! Just what level of cultivation was this? Since when did Golden Token Envoys have that kind of ability?

With a flick of Zu An’s finger, several streaks of energy struck Sir Huo, completely restraining his movements. He said, “I am the one asking the questions now.”

Sir Huo’s eyes darted from side to side as he said, “Apologies, great sir, but there seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding here… I am King Yan Manor’s guest, and I normally respect the law greatly. I have done nothing bad!”

“Don’t try to control me with King Yan’s name,” Zu An said, giving him an indifferent look. His gaze was so sharp, it almost seemed to sting.

Sir Huo shivered. This person in front of him was just too mysterious. He asked, “May I ask what this sir wishes to know? This old… This one will definitely tell you everything I know.”

Zu An chuckled and remarked, “To be honest, I liked that arrogant act of yours from earlier more.”

Sir Huo laughed apologetically and said, “I wouldn’t dare to act arrogant in front of great sir.”

“How exactly did Golden Token Seven die?” Zu An suddenly asked.

At first, Sir Huo’s expression froze before changing a bit. Then, he said, “I was also quite curious about that. Actually, even the king was also curious. He has been investigating how Golden Token Seven died this whole time.”

Zu An said with a scowl, “It seems you’re the type who won’t cry until you see a coffin.”

Sir Huo urgently replied, “Sir, I really didn’t fool you!”

“If you still won’t talk about it, I’ll have to resort to torture,” Zu An said coldly.

“What does your respected self want me to say?” Sir Huo replied. He wanted to cry, and yet no tears came out. At the same time, his eyes secretly darted around. He clearly felt that there wasn’t much that could be used for torture in the area.

Zu An didn’t waste any time with words. He immediately used the Ikuu Experience Card on Sir Huo.

If your back hurts, it might not be because of a blade. If you are screaming your heart and lungs out, it might not be because of pain. What rests on your shoulders might not necessarily be responsibility. Things you are forced to learn might not be a lesson!

Skill effect: Only effective on men. Once a target is selected, it will force them to experience a woman’s perspective. They will feel as if they were being powerfully filled by a strong and robust man. One of the four scenarios above will be chosen, and they will continue to scream ‘Ikuu ikuu~’.

Note: This skill is ineffective against those without any intimate experiences.

The Embroidered Envoy’s torture methods were more thorough, but there was no time to return. Furthermore, it would be hard to ensure that there weren’t any spies from King Yan’s side. As for this old bastard, he deserved to be punished for his disgusting fetish. He had to have a taste of being bullied by others.

“Ahhh!” Sir Huo screamed miserably. In his mind, several large and burly men suddenly appeared. They held his arms down, then tore off his pants…

“Ikuu ikuu!”

Soon after, Sir Huo’s entire body was shaking on the ground. He mumbled all sorts of unclear words.

Zu An was stunned. Why is this guy so disappointing? He already came that fast? As such, he stopped the skill. He looked at the old man, who was curled up into a ball, and asked, “Are you going to talk now?”

Sir Huo trembled as he clutched his bottom. Then, as if he had been burned, he quickly pulled his hands back. His face was a bit unnaturally red as he said, “Sir, I really wasn’t lying to you.”

Zu An glowered and said, “It seems you still haven’t had enough.” As such, he activated the Ikuu Experience Card again.

“Nooooooooo!”

Another round of miserable screams emerged.

Zu An gave him a look. He really found the sight a bit harsh on the eyes, so he went over to the window to get some fresh air. A while later, he asked, “Are you going to talk now?”

“I don’t know what to say…”

“Ikuu Experience Card!”

…

A while later, Zu An asked again, “Now?”

“I won’t talk, I absolutely won't!” Sir Huo replied; surprisingly, his attitude just seemed to have become tougher and tougher. “Why don’t you do that again to me if you have the skill?!”

Zu An’s expression quickly turned incredibly strange. When he saw that the old guy’s expression was gradually starting to turn into one of pleasure, he wondered whether Sir Huo was just struggling to hold on, or if he had actually changed…

When he thought about what Sir Huo did to little girls normally, disgust appeared on Zu An’s face. He didn’t use the Ikuu Experience Card anymore, and instead raised his hand. A small black hole appeared in the center of his palm and he said, “Last chance. If you still won’t speak, I’ll suck all of your cultivation away, then throw you out on the streets.”

When he saw the black hole in Zu An’s palm, a hint of fear flickered across Sir Huo’s face. He cried, “I’ll speak, I’ll speak!”

In this world, there was nothing more important than cultivation. Cultivation was money, cultivation got you beauties… If he became a cripple, King Yan would definitely abandon him. Furthermore, with all the enemies he’d made over the years, he would absolutely wish he were dead. More importantly, once one had a taste of what it felt like to be at the top, they wouldn’t be willing to stay at the bottom.

When he saw Zu An staring at him coldly, Sir Huo gulped and quickly said, “Golden Token Seven was investigating King Yan Manor’s military supplies, so King Yan wanted to get rid of him.”

“King Yan Manor’s military supplies?” Zu An exclaimed in surprise. No wonder Golden Token Seven’s mood had been so grave; it turned out he had been investigating something related to a king and didn’t dare to recklessly make a report without proper evidence. Zu An continued, “Be more specific!”

Once he began to speak, Sir Huo let go of his earlier misgivings. He explained, “Over the years, King Yan has secretly raised several personal troops and roped in many powerful experts. In order to accomplish that, he needed a huge amount of money. As such, he was secretly doing business with the Fiend races, sending the court’s military supplies and some standard goods to the Fiend races for money, precious ores, medicines, and other such things. Golden Token Seven apparently caught onto some traces of that exchange, so King Yan was furious and said he had to be eliminated.”

Zu An finally understood what was happening. Previously in Cloudcenter Commandery, he had found out that the Pegasus Merchant Group had King Yan behind it.

Now, after combining all of this information together… All of the private industries in Cloudcenter Commandery were related to King Qi, so King Yan wanted to borrow someone else to do his dirty work. If King Qi’s forces were driven out, he could then take their place. Unfortunately, I ruined everything right when he was on the cusp of success, so it’s no wonder he hates me so much.

As for Golden Token Seven finding out about these things, he was no doubt horrified. After all, a king was doing business with the enemy and raising a personal army, which are clear signs of rebellion. That’s why he didn’t dare to say anything before he found concrete proof. Otherwise, if he falsely accused a king, that would only bring his own clan a great disaster. Still, he never expected King Yan to strike first, and so viciously!

“How many private troops has King Yan raised?” Zu An asked.

Sir Huo shook his head and replied, “I do not know. All of those things are top-level secrets. A follower like me does not have access to much information.”

“Do you really not know, or are you just pretending?” Zu An asked, bringing the Heaven Devouring Sutra closer to Sir Huo’s head.

Feeling as if his cultivation was about to leave his body, Sir Huo was horrified. He replied, “I really don’t know! But I know that King Yan has an account book that records his trade with the Fiend races, as well as the people involved.”

“Where is that account book?”

“It is in a private room behind King Yan’s study. There are many layers of mechanisms, but there is no way any outsiders could obtain it.”
