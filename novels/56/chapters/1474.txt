Chapter 1423: Aloof and Seductive

Yan Xuehen had a strange smile as she said, “Since the Fengxi Boar’s weakness is its perversion, of course we should face it with beauty! Furthermore, it just happens to be a full moon tonight. Yayu said that the Fengxi Boar often stares blankly at the moon, no? Everything has already been prepared; we just need the person now.”

Yun Jianyue snapped in annoyance, “Then why aren’t you going? Aren’t you pretty good-looking too?!”

Yu Yanluo closed her lips tightly. She didn’t dare to get involved in a fight between the two powerful goddesses.

Yan Xuehen replied, “Are you not always blabbing about how your charm skill is unrivaled? I do not know any, so of course I cannot be the one to go.”

She couldn't help but grin as she spoke. She was always the one being bullied. Now that she was the one teasing Yun Jianyue, she discovered that she couldn't hold back her happiness. Sigh, why do I feel like I’ve become corrupted as of late somehow?

Yun Jianyue was briefly left at a loss for words. However, she reacted quickly and retorted, “Who said you don’t know any charm skills? That pure and unsullied goddess act you put on always brings in guests from all sorts of different forces. In the eyes of men, they welcome you far more than me. What else could that be but a charm skill?”

Yan Xuehen’s cheeks heated up. She was worried that someone could misunderstand and said, “Witch, what kind of nonsense are you saying? That is my personality. I always treat people kindly and they return the favor; what do you mean, a charm skill? It is your fault for always being so fierce and drawing public anger. Besides, you always feel that it is beneath you to use charm skills, so it is only natural that the righteous factions do not welcome you.”

Yun Jianyue sneered. “Since you’re so amazing, use that good personality of yours to bring out the Fengxi Boar.”

“That thing is not even a person, so my personality will not work,” Yan Xuehen said, directly rejecting that idea.

Yun Jianyue was so angry she began to laugh, saying, “Fine, it’s not a person. But if your skills won’t work, then why would mine?”

Yan Xuehen gave her a strange look and retorted, “Who is the one always bragging about her charm skills? How, as long as they were male, a target would be unable to escape your charm?”

Yun Jianyue was once again at a loss for words.

Yan Xuehen added salt to the wound, saying, “Wait, I always hear you brag about it, but I have never seen you really use it before. Could it be that you have never been that good at charm skills, so you just say those things to cover up the embarrassing truth?”

Yu Yanluo secretly clicked her tongue. Sect Master Yan always acted like a goddess who didn’t get involved in secular matters, and yet now that they spent some time together, she had quickly learned how to become two-faced.

“Stone cold woman, do you think that your psychological attacks would work against me?” Yun Jianyue snapped, looking at her angrily. “Fine, today will be the day your horizons are broadened.”

Zu An was speechless. You just said that you wouldn’t fall for it, so why did you forget so soon?

“Fine, then we will just wait and see just how great the most formidable user of charm skills in the history of the Holy Sect is for ourselves,” Yan Xuehen said. Her normally ice-cold eyes were now curved like crescent moons.

Yun Jianyue knew that she had fallen for the other woman’s trick, but with her personality, she couldn't just take back her words. She could only harrumph and say, “Then you’d better get ready. I definitely won’t do it again if I lure out that Fengxi Boar and you guys let it escape.”

“Alright, alright. We get it already,” Yan Xuehen said, a big smile on her face. However, she still discussed how they would face the Fengxi Boar again with the others.

All of them were experts, so they quickly drafted up a detailed plan to hunt it down. Then, they looked at Yun Jianyue with expectant gazes.

Yun Jianyue was furious. She hadn’t expected that the first time she used her charm skill would be on a pig! Still, she was an extraordinary person. She quickly adjusted her mental state.

Then, they had to decide on a location. If they wanted to attract the Fengxi Boar, they had to find a place where it could see her. That meant it had to be a high place.

In the Mulberry Forest, the highest point was naturally the large mulberry tree at the very center. Thus, the group arrived at the very center of the Mulberry Forest. Even though they had already made their mental preparations, however, they were still shocked when they saw it with their own eyes.

The mulberry tree trunk was a hundred zhang in diameter, perhaps even wider. The entire tree was like an imperial canopy that covered the sky. The air around them was exceptionally fresh and clean, making the atmosphere feel carefree and relaxed.

Zu An thought to himself, The heaven-reaching divine trees from the legends of his previous world, or the tree from the Classic of Mountains and Seas, are probably only this large at most, right?

Yan Xuehen couldn't help but sigh in admiration, saying, “This place really is a natural paradise. If I could cultivate here normally, my rate of improvement could be around double.”

“If you’re willing, you can stay behind and live here long-term,” Yun Jianyue said impatiently. She was obviously unhappy after falling for the other woman’s trick.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yan Xuehen didn’t get annoyed when she heard Yun Jianyue’s mockery. She obviously knew that they couldn't stay there long-term. In order to not provoke her as much, she decided to bring Yu Yanluo along and start laying out the trap.

Zu An initially planned to help them too, but he was stopped by Yun Jianyue. He asked curiously, “Big sis Yun, do you need me to help with anything?”

“Make sure to watch me properly later,” Yun Jianyue quickly said.

Zu An was completely baffled and speechless. Eventually, though, he said, “Don’t worry, I’ll carefully protect you. I won’t let that wild pig hurt you.”

Yun Jianyue stared at him, retorting, “What kind of identity do I have? Why would I need your protection?!”

She paused for a moment, then snuck a look at the distant Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo. When she saw that they weren’t paying attention, she quietly said, “I want you to watch carefully later. I don’t want the first time I use my charm skill to be for a pig. It’ll make me feel a bit better if it’s for you.”

“Ah?” Zu An exclaimed, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the favor.

Yun Jianyue quickly said, “Don’t think too much of it. I’m not really doing it for you to see. It’s just that you’re the only man in our group. If there were any other man here, I would also invite him to watch. It would still be better than showing it to a pig.”

Zu An endured his urge to laugh. He said warmly, “Okay, I’ll make sure to properly admire it.”

“Why does that sound so strange?” Yun Jianyue asked, her eyes narrowing. “Forget it. I’m going to make some preparations over there.” Then, she floated over to a distant tree, deliberately moving out of view.

Zu An didn’t know what she was really preparing for, but since she was intentionally avoiding the others, she had to have her reasons for doing so. He wouldn’t try to dig too deeply. As such, he went to help Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo set up the trap.

“What did she tell you just now?” Yan Xuehen asked, feigning nonchalance. Yu Yanluo also immediately perked up her ears.

“Oh, she told me to be careful later, and that if she ended up wasting all of her efforts, she’d be sure to make me pay the price,” Zu An replied ambiguously.

Only a dummy would tell the truth in such a situation. However, he couldn't tell a lie either, because that would easily be exposed in the future. That was why he had to say something that could be explained, but also something that wouldn’t make others think weird thoughts.

Raising fish in a fish tank isn’t so easy either… Do you think it’s that easy for me?!

“Oh, is that what happened?” Yan Xuehen asked. She was skeptical at first, but after thinking about it, that did sound like the witch’s personality, so she didn’t say anything else.

Soon afterward, they finished their arrangements. Yun Jianyue also slowly walked out of the forest just then. Zu An’s eyes immediately widened, as Yun Jianyue had changed into a pink dress that was more skintight than her normal attire. He could clearly see her slender waistline, as well as her impressive figure. When she walked, there was a clear ripple that even made him think of Big Manman at that moment.

Several thin strips of cloth fluttered around the dress, adding a bit of mysterious beauty to Yun Jianyue’s appearance. Her waist-length hair was completely free. As her black hair fluttered around, it gave her an air of bewitching beauty. She had changed her makeup too, making her brows and eyes no longer seem as fierce and intimidating as usual. At that moment, she looked gentle and beautiful, full of tender feelings.

The moment she saw Yun Jianyue, Yu Yanluo couldn't help but give the nearby Yan Xuehen a look. Yun Jianyue’s goddess-like appearance was too similar to Yan Xuehen’s temperament.

Upon paying closer attention, however, she noticed that there were several differences. There was a strong aura of seduction emanating from Yun Jianyue’s body too. She was actually able to combine such an aloof fairy-like appearance with an air of passion and desire perfectly!
