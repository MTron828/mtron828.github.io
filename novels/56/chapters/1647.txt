Chapter 1596: Trying to Steal a Chicken, but Ending Up Losing the Rice Used to Lure it

Zu An hadn’t expected Chu Chuyan to be present either, leaving him both happy and worried. He was happy to be reunited with them, but what worried him was that he was meeting both of them together.

By then, King Yan had already seen all of the guests. He said with a chuckle, “You all arrived at the perfect time. Hurry and take a seat.”

Zu An smiled and walked directly toward the two women.

Chu Chuyan’s cold eyes revealed a smile, but Yan Xuehen panicked inwardly. She said through ki, “Don’t come over here. If you dare to expose our relationship in public, I… I…” In that instant, she didn’t even know how to threaten him.

Zu An grinned and replied, “What are you going to do?”

Yan Xuehen was in a tough spot. This kid was going more and more overboard. She shot back, “I will never forget it for the rest of my life!”

“Hmm, making you remember it for the rest of your life doesn’t seem to be too bad of an idea, actually,” Zu An said. He really felt a sense of accomplishment when he saw that she was nervous, but had no way of showing it.

Just like that, the two spoke to each other from a distance. In the eyes of Xie Daoyun, who knew a bit more than the others, she just assumed Zu An was flirting with Chu Chuyan. But how could she possibly know that the one he was teasing was the glorious Sect Master Yan?

In the end, Zu An still gave up on the thought of sitting with them, and sat down at the table next to them instead. The table already had a set of dinnerware laid out, which meant there was already someone sitting there. However, Zu An pretended he hadn’t seen anything; he called over a maid and said, “Bring me a new set of bowls and chopsticks.”

The maid gave King Yan’s heir, Zhao Huang, a troubled look. This was clearly supposed to be his seat.

Zhao Huang looked a bit unhappy, but he couldn't say too much. He could only tactfully remind Zu An, “White Jade Sect’s Master does not like to have unfamiliar people near her. I fear that she is not too used to having unfamiliar people sit at her side.”

Zu An said casually, “Don’t worry, I can just ask her.” Then, he turned to Yan Xuehen and said, “Sect Master Yan, I wonder if you would mind me sitting here?”

Yan Xuehen felt her teeth becoming a bit sore as she gritted them in irritation. She really wanted him to get out of her sight. At the moment, however, she could tell that King Yan Manor was making things troublesome for Zu An, so how could she just do nothing? She merely replied with an unhappy expression, “I am not so petty-minded.”

Zu An’s expression seemed to imply ‘as expected’. Then, he looked at Zhao Huang and replied, “Young master, do you see? Sect Master Yan doesn’t mind.”

Zhao Huang was speechless, overwhelmed with alarm. He had previously heard of Yan Xuehen’s reputation as a goddess, and her stunning disciple was even beside her. He had managed to obtain a chance to sit next to her with great difficulty. Even if they couldn't become close, smelling their fragrance was still delightful.

Now, however, all of his hard work of appearing like a gentleman in front of these two women had ended up benefiting another. He had even ended up losing his seat! The most upsetting thing was that after what Sect Master Yan had just said, he couldn't really say anything either.

Zhao Huang was about to take the next seat when Zu An suddenly called out to Xie Daoyun. “Lady Xie, come and have a seat over here.”

Zu An couldn't call her by her nickname in front of everyone in public, after all. That was just something they shared in private! Still, Xie Daoyun felt a bit sad. He sounds so unfamiliar with me in front of Chu Chuyan.

Both Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan aimed sharp looks at Xie Daoyun. Zu An didn’t want to neglect her even in such a situation! It looked as if their relationship seemed to be quite out of the ordinary.

However, Yan Xuehen quickly realized something. What does this have to do with me? She quickly looked away, recovering her usual indifferent attitude.

Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan recognized Xie Daoyun, and a thoughtful expression appeared on her face.

In that instant, Zu An felt several waves of killing intent aimed at him. He couldn't help but smile bitterly. A certain Chinese proverb said that when there was only one person, they could manage to do things by themselves, but with two people, they could work together and make things easier. However, with too many people, it could be counterproductive instead. 

This is the awkward situation I’m in right now…

When he saw Xie Daoyun take the seat, forcing him to sit all the way off to one side, Zhao Huang’s face twitched. He almost burst out in anger on the spot.

Fortunately, King Yan spoke up just then. “Huang’er, help Sir Zhang and the others to their seats.”

Zhao Huang took a deep breath and adjusted his mood. He seated Zhang Jie and the others, while he himself took an end seat. He hoped that would make him look as if he had an outstanding bearing in front of Yan Xuehen’s disciple. Still, he was incredibly angry!

Yi Commandery’s Zhang Jie and the other officials watched the scene unfolds as bystanders. They discovered that they seemed to have looked down on this Zu An! They had felt very wronged and stifled previously, but now, things had become much more interesting.

Sun Xun frowned, thinking, Was this guy just pretending earlier? However, with so many kings present, it wasn’t his place to speak up.

King Yan said with a smile, “Sir Zu is young and outstanding, as expected. This level of boldness is worthy of admiration.” Even though he had a smile on his face, there was an intimidating undercurrent to his tone

Zu An remained unconcerned, replying, “King Yan overpraises me.”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

At first, when Sun Xun had started causing trouble for him, he had assumed the man was just acting out of pettiness for the circumstances surrounding his son’s death. Now, however, everything made sense. Zu An was representing the court on this trip. If King Yan hadn’t incited Sun Xun into acting the way he did, there was no way the man would dare to be so bold.

Zu An figured that it was probably because Cloudcenter Commandery had uncovered the Pegasus Merchant Group’s scandals, causing King Yan’s plans in Yan Commandery to suffer great setbacks. Thus, this old man had probably hated him for quite a while.

King Yan frowned. This brat seemed to be more difficult to deal with than he had expected!

Suddenly, a woman remarked, “Young hero? Great boldness? Isn’t King Yan exaggerating here?”

Silence fell across the whole place in the wake of those words. The woman was clearly trying to start an argument, and didn’t even show King Yan any respect. Just who could such a fierce individual be?

Zu An was a bit surprised. He looked toward the other table and saw who had spoken. She was a young lady with graceful looks, but the overbearing arrogance on her face made others subconsciously feel uncomfortable. Of course, overall, she was still a beauty. The purple and white clothes she wore were especially unique. Between that and the special style of her upper garment, she looked just like a pretty butterfly. If it were anywhere else, she would definitely be the center of attention. However, with Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan present, she clearly paled a bit in comparison.

Yan Xuehen, Chu Chuyan, and even Xie Daoyun gave Zu An a suspicious look, thinking, Is this some woman he played around with before but abandoned? Is she getting revenge on him right now? After all, they all knew just how much of a playboy he was.

Zu An was also starting to question life. He clearly didn’t know who the woman was, so why did her expression carry so much hatred?

“Little Die, great uncle is confused. What are you trying to say?” King Yan asked. He didn’t get angry at all, and instead pretended to be confused as he spoke. He clearly wanted to see Zu An make a fool of himself.

“Great uncle?” Zu An muttered, startled. Could it be…

Just then, Zhang Zijiang explained through ki transmission, “Sir Zu, she is King Qi Manor’s Princess Xiaodie. I heard that she was sent to an immortal mountain for her studies, but it turned out to have been Heavenly Sorrow Sect.”

As someone who had served as a member of the Imperial Palace for so long, he knew more about the royal family than other people. Finally recognizing who the woman was, he quickly told Zu An.

“King Qi’s daughter?” Zu An asked, now fully understanding the situation. No wonder she had been so hostile from the get-go.

Zhao Xiaodie continued, “That person has a wretched look in his eyes, and he went straight for the women as soon as he arrived. I don’t see any talent or heroism in him. All I see is a bold pervert.”

Yan Xuehen pursed her lips to stop herself from laughing. This little girl really speaks my language! That scoundrel deserves a good scolding.

Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan frowned a bit. She naturally didn’t like anyone cursing her lover.

Zu An didn’t take it personally. He picked up a wine cup and said calmly, “The lady says I’m a pervert, but you don’t see me getting closer to you. Perhaps that might be something for you to reflect over?”

Pfft!

Several people couldn't hold themselves back from laughing and almost spit out wine everywhere. Wasn’t this kid using an indirect method to call her ugly?

Zhao Xiaodie was speechless.
