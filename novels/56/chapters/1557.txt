Chapter 1506: Do You Really Have No Idea?

It wasn’t just the Second Empress at Zu An’s side; there was also the Medusa Queen, Elf Princess, the Demon Princess… And what was going on with those other two women with ridiculously powerful auras?

Judging from their figures and temperaments, they seemed to be the two who had represented the Snake race in the General Assembly’s competition. However, back then, they had been masked. No one could have expected the two to be so beautiful.

The Second Prince was a Fiend race prince, so there had always been countless beautiful women at his side ever since he was little. However, he rarely saw women who were this stunning.

Just what kind of superpower does this Zu An have? How is he able to have so many extraordinary beauties at his side?

However, that was just his instinctive jealous reaction. He was an outstanding individual among his peers, so he quickly turned his attention away from the women and looked at the golden-robed youngest prince. He called out sternly, “Fifth Brother, you dare to selfishly wear the emperor’s robes? Do you know that this is a crime punishable by clan eradication?!”

The youngest prince was still quite young, and a little intimidated by his fierce Second Brother. His entire body trembled as his brother shouted at him, and he reflexively shrank back.

Suddenly, however, a pair of warm and steady hands rested on his shoulders. Zu An called out again, “You’re so easily talking about clan eradication. Has the Second Prince forgotten that you’re part of his clan?”

The young prince immediately felt a sense of peace. He instinctively grabbed onto Zu An’s sleeves, as it made him feel even safer than holding onto the Second Empress.

The Second Empress felt both gratified and a bit strange. In that instant, it was hard even for her to describe what she was thinking.

The Second Prince choked. He almost felt that if he were to say he had fought all the way from the King Court to the Imperial Palace without batting an eyelid, Zu An would ask him if his eyes were dry.

He sneered. “The Fiend Emperor position is not one you can maintain just because you wear the imperial robes. Toward such disgraceful behavior, today, I am going to clean up my own family’s affairs.”

“The late Fiend Emperor personally said to pass on the position to the youngest prince. With this as proof, the youngest prince’s position is justified. Second Prince, don't make a mistake you’ll regret!” Zu An cried, then raised the Sun Slaying Bow, which immediately caused the Second Prince’s faction to cry out in alarm.

The Sun Slaying Bow was a famous divine weapon among the Fiend races. It had always been in the Fiend Emperor’s possession until recent years, but because he was nearing the end of his life, he had passed it onto the next generation’s Fiend Emperor. Over time, the Sun Slaying Bow had become the symbol of imperial power.

Now, when they saw the Sun Slaying Bow in Zu An’s hands, how could the onlookers not feel shocked?”

“Why is the Sun Slaying Bow in your hands?” the Second Prince exclaimed, shocked and angry. In the past, the thing he had carried the greatest reservations toward was none other than the Crown Prince’s Sun Slaying Bow. Even though he was confident that he had a high chance of defeating the Crown Prince, if his opponent had the Sun Slaying Bow, things would become tricky.

For some time, he had been praising himself for his own battlefield tactics having prevented the Crown Prince from getting a chance to bring out the Sun Slaying Bow. And yet, to his surprise, the bow was nowhere to be seen even after the Crown Prince was killed! The Second Prince had been puzzled as to where his brother had hidden the Sun Slaying Bow. Never would he have thought that it would actually appear in Zu An’s hands!

Zu An said indifferently, “Of course it was given to me by the Fiend Emperor back then. Don’t tell me you think I would steal something like this?”

Yu Yanluo, Yan Xuehen, and Yun Jianyue, who knew the truth, had strange expressions. However, no one else doubted Zu An at all. The Fiend Emperor was so powerful that no one could have his possessions unless he gave them away.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Second Prince was bewildered, asking, “But why would Father Emperor give you the Sun Slaying Bow? Was it not with the Crown Prince before? You probably stole it from him.”

Zu An sneered. “The Golden Crow Crown Prince was always with the late Fiend Emperor in the secret dungeon. Would you try to steal it from him in that kind of situation?”

“You went into the dungeon too?” the Second Prince exclaimed in shock. The Crown Prince and Fiend Emperor’s trip into the secret dungeon was no secret. Those at the upper echelons all knew of it.

“Of course. Inside the dungeon, the Golden Crow Crown Prince was cruel and unscrupulous, and he even launched a surprise attack on the late Fiend Emperor. That was why, out of bitter disappointment, the Fiend Emperor seized his right to have the Sun Slaying Bow. Before his death, he gave me the Sun Slaying Bow and asked me to support the youngest prince in taking the throne,” Zu An said calmly. The youngest prince was too young, which would naturally draw a lot of criticism. He needed a proper pretext in order to take the imperial throne.

However, there was still the Crown Prince to worry about. As such, he suddenly came up with an excuse. It not only solved the issue of the Crown Prince’s legitimacy, but also allowed the youngest prince to have a proper reason for ascending to the throne.

Yan Xuehen and the other women were left in admiration. This guy really was sharp. This way, not only would they avoid the problem of becoming hated by all the Fiend races after killing the Fiend Emperor, it would even deal with the issue of legitimacy between the Crown Prince and the youngest prince.

The Second Empress was also somewhat surprised. This was the first time she had heard the details surrounding the Fiend Emperor’s death. She suspected that there had to be something else, but she sensibly chose not to ask more about it. This explanation was favorable for both mother and son.

A commotion broke out among the onlookers. This was the first time many people had learned of the late Fiend Emperor’s death. Many of them even wept bitter tears. They were incredibly shocked, because there was way too much to take in from what Zu An had just said.

The Second Prince thought, So that’s what happened in the dungeon. No wonder… Still, even if it was true, he wouldn’t acknowledge it. He retorted, “Hmph, what kind of joke is this? The Crown Prince has always received the favor of Father Emperor, and the position was already passed onto him. What motive would he have to harm my father?”

He was putting on a bit of an act too. After all, he never could have expected to have to speak up for the Crown Prince. He coughed, then continued, “Let alone the fact that the Fiend Emperor’s cultivation is extraordinary. Even if the Crown Prince did plot against him, there would be no chance for him to hurt Father Emperor.”

His answer received the agreement of his subordinates. Right, who is the Fiend Emperor? He is unrivaled! Even if the Crown Prince attacked him, how could anything have happened to him?

Now, even the Second Empress’ people looked at Zu An with a bit of suspicion.

Zu An seemed to have already guessed that the Second Prince would call things into question like this. He explained in a calm and unhurried manner, “It was because there were clues regarding an immortal medicine in the secret dungeon. The late Fiend Emperor defeated the guardian of the immortal medicine and was about to obtain it when the Crown Prince succeeded in his plan. At the time, the late Fiend Emperor was seriously injured and unable to recover.”

“Immortal medicine?” An uproar arose once again. All those present became a bit excited when they heard about such a legendary substance. They hadn’t expected it to really exist!

Everything now made sense. The Fiend Emperor and the Crown Prince previously shouldn’t have been in conflict… but if the Fiend Emperor had obtained an immortal medicine, he would continue being the Fiend Emperor. How could the Crown Prince accept that? It made sense for him to take a risk out of desperation.

When he heard the discussion taking place, Zu An struck while the iron was hot. “The late Fiend Emperor passed on the position to the youngest prince right before his death. But out of consideration for his young age, he ordered for the Second Empress to rule in his place and assist the youngest prince into adulthood.”

“Rule in his place?” the Second Empress repeated, startled. She felt that all of this was really incredible. She really didn’t know how this guy had thought of such a wonderful method. Now, she could properly hold a position in office. She looked at Zu An with an expression of happiness and gratitude. He really is considerate, even helping me solve all of these problems.

Zu An’s explanation only seemed natural. Even many of the Second Prince’s subordinates believed him.

Still, the Second Prince refused to accept the result. He protested, “What nonsense! Even if Father Emperor gave up on the Crown Prince, he should have passed the role to me. Why would he give it to my young Fifth Brother? Wouldn’t that be placing the Fiend races in danger?”

Zu An retorted indifferently, “Do you really have no idea why he didn’t pass the position to you? How could a bastard child like you have the right of inheritance?”

The Second Prince was speechless.

You went there?!

His rage flared up and he spat, “I have never heard of a young child becoming the Fiend Emperor. The position of Fiend Emperor has always gone to the most powerful. If you refuse to adapt to circumstances, do not blame me for disregarding brotherly affection!”

You have trolled the Second Prince for +444 +444 +444…

“Brotherly affection?” Zu An repeated, pointing at the cross off to the side. “Is this so-called brotherly affection killing your older brother and parading through the streets with his corpse?”

The Second Prince glowered.

“When have our Fiend races’ affairs needed the interference of a human like you?” Regular Attendant Xue Han screamed shrilly. His showing in front of Chief Attendant Wu Fa had been a bit lacking, so he naturally wanted to speak up here to earn back the Second Prince’s impression of him.

Just then, a tiger roared as a yellow and black figure rushed up to Xue Han, grabbing his throat and twisting. With a crack, Xue Han’s body drooped like a dead dog in the figure’s hand.

Hu Qianxiao roared with laughter, exclaiming, “When have the Fiend Emperor’s affairs needed a eunuch’s thoughtless remarks?”

Suddenly, a black ripple appeared by the palace gate. A slender sword stabbed toward the Second Empress and the youngest prince.
