Chapter 1824: Repaying the Fare

Zu An hadn’t expected to reunite with Jing Teng here. He was about to ask her something when he sensed a cold aura quickly approaching. He didn’t dare to delay and immediately grabbed Jing Teng before running.

However, the other party was too fast, and they were caught shortly after.

Zu An took out the Tai’e Sword and was about to fight when a gentle hand grabbed him, saying, “This way.”

He didn’t know how Jing Teng did it, but she pressed against the wall and a door opened, revealing a hidden path. She pulled Zu An in.

As soon as the door closed, the Ghost King called out from outside, “Stop running! You should also understand that I won’t do anything to you. All you need to do is hand over the Baopu Sutra!”

Because they were too close, Jing Teng and Zu An didn’t even dare to move in the tunnel for fear of alerting the Ghost King.

The tunnel was extremely narrow. It was only enough for one person to move through, so the two could only lean tightly against each other to squeeze into it. At that distance, Zu An could clearly smell Jing Teng’s fragrance, as well as feel the warmth and shocking elasticity of her tender skin.

Jing Teng’s entire body was tense; she was clearly a bit nervous in the current situation. However, when she sensed Zu An’s warm embrace, her trembling body gradually calmed down as well. She leaned against him just like that. The two hadn’t spent much time together, but apart from that one time, they had never been so intimate with each other.

Jing Teng’s face gradually turned red in the darkness. Her heart was also pounding. Fortunately, because the outside world was shaking and rumbling, and Golden Mountain Motuo’s furious roars had created a chain reaction, making other mysterious beings roar as well, they had escaped the Ghost King’s detection.

“Hm? Why did they suddenly disappear?” the Ghost King muttered, searching the nearby area.

Zu An had a grave expression. If they were discovered here, they would be in a really bad position. The secret passage was so narrow that he wouldn’t be able to do much.

He felt a ticklish sensation by his ear. It turned out Jing Teng had moved close to his ear, saying through ki transmission, “Don’t worry. This passage is extremely well-hidden. He won’t be able to find us.”

At the Ghost King and Zhao Han’s level, if they were paying attention, not even the fine vibrations in the air created by ki transmissions would escape their notice. However, if Jing Teng got this close to him, it would be easy enough to control and ensure no sound would leak out. Even earth immortals wouldn’t be able to hear what they were talking about.

Jing Teng’s lips were really close to Zu An’s ear, so he could even feel the air she exhaled. Zu An felt a bit ticklish and reflexively turned to look at her. However, Jing Teng pulled her head back as soon as she finished speaking, so their lips actually touched.

Both of their bodies trembled and their heart rates accelerated.

Zu An was about to pull back and apologize, but when he recalled her ‘confession’, as well as how they were gently embracing each other, his face heated up. Not only did he not back off, he even continued to kiss her.

Jing Teng’s eyes widened. In that instant, her mind went completely blank. At first, she clung tightly to Zu An’s arm, but later on, her body softened up. Her grip also gradually changed to an embrace. Arcs of electricity passed through her body. She thought to herself, So this is what kissing feels like?

The Ghost King was looking around outside, and they were only separated by a single wall, bringing him closer than ever to them. With such a powerful enemy so near, the two of them became even more nervous. Even so, due to the stimulation of the nervousness, they felt that their kisses became even more sweet and memorable.

The Ghost King spoke again. “Jing Teng, I know you probably haven’t run away that far and can definitely hear me. If you continue to play this game of hide and seek, I might not be able to find you, but I can return to the throne room and kill the other women. Don’t force my hand.”

Zu An was alarmed, but the Ghost King continued, “No, those are all your rivals in love, so you might even be hoping for me to do that for you. Instead, I’ll kill your lover. After that happens, it will be too late for regret. Even though the Baopu Sutra is precious, it’s only an inanimate object. How could it compare to a living lover?”

Jing Teng felt a bit dizzy. She thought to herself, What are you saying? My lover is right at my side… When she thought of that, she couldn't help but return the kisses even more intensely.

The Ghost King didn’t get a reaction even after waiting for a while. They said coldly, “Fine. Since you don’t care, I’ll kill those women first, and I’ll say that it was because of you. That pretty boy will hate you for the rest of his life.”

For a moment, Zu An was worried, but his thoughts were interrupted by several furious roars. They were Golden Mountain Motuo’s screams of hatred. “Damn brat, I’ll definitely chop your corpse into ten thousand pieces!”

You have successfully trolled Golden Mountain Motuo for +999 +999 +999…

Zu An thought to himself, I really did offend this guy badly. I could pick up his Rage points even from so far away.

“What is this bastard always screaming for?” the Ghost King muttered in annoyance. Suddenly, they exclaimed in surprise, “Damn brat?”

The Ghost King quickly rushed in Golden Mountain Motuo’s direction.

…

When he sensed that the Ghost King had left, Zu An said to Jing Teng, “He left. We should take the chance to leave this place.”

Jing Teng voiced her agreement. She held his hand tightly like a young maiden.

“Where do we go now?” Zu An asked.

This great tomb’s lower levels really were a bit too dangerous. Even some random monster was that strong… It really would be best if they didn’t move too recklessly. However, as Jing Teng had taken the initiative, that meant she definitely had more confidence down here.

“This way…” Jing Teng said, leading the way ahead. As soon as she took a step, her legs buckled and she almost fell. She gave Zu An an accusatory look before continuing.

Zu An couldn't help but smile, saying, “Everything seems like a dream. I feel as if our relationship is really moving a bit fast.”

Jing Teng turned around and looked at him vigilantly, asking, “What, are you going to leave me now that you’ve gotten what you wanted?”

When he saw her nervous appearance, Zu An gently caressed her face, replying, “You’re so beautiful; how stupid would I be if I did that?”

Jing Teng asked unhappily, “Does that mean you would do that if I weren’t pretty?”

Zu An was speechless. He could only reply, “I’d like you no matter what you look like.”

Jing Teng harrumphed. “Slick-tongued, I knew you weren’t a good person. No wonder you already bullied me not long after we met.”

Zu An was startled. He asked, “Wait, that time with Ghost Bride… was real?”

Jing Teng’s face reddened. She replied, “My body wasn’t, but… my mind was. It was all because I was too careless and ended up falling for that monster’s schemes.”

Zu An quickly understood her intentions. When they fell for Ghost Bride’s illusion, many of those events hadn’t taken place with their physical bodies, but rather their souls. So even though they hadn’t experienced it with their flesh, they had through their minds. In a way, an intimate experience in the mind was even deeper than one in the flesh. No wonder Jing Teng’s attitude toward him had changed a bit after that event.

His expression suddenly became a bit strange. Does that count as repaying the fare after already getting on the bus…

“Big brother Zu, I’ve actually been watching you closely this entire time. In every aspect, you’re the best of the best. There’s just one part that’s not good, which is that you’re a bit too unfaithful,” Jing Teng said with a sigh.

She had previously thought that she only had to compete against Qiu Honglei, and judging from their interaction, she could sense that she wasn’t a bad person either, so they could become friends. However, who would have expected that so many women would appear later on? She didn’t know what to do at all anymore.

Zu An was a bit speechless. He really didn’t know how to explain the situation.

Jing Teng quickly smiled and added, “But it’s okay. I don’t mind. Either way, I also…” She stopped midway through her sentence and changed the topic. “Why are you here, though?”

“When I saw you draw the Ghost King away on your own, I was worried about your safety, of course,” Zu An said casually.

Even though Jing Teng usually had a cold expression, her eyes were now curved like crescent moons as she smiled. She said, “Don’t worry. He can’t catch me down here.”

“Did you have a plan by drawing him down here?” Zu An asked curiously.

“I didn’t really have much of a plan, but I couldn't continue to remain up there. Otherwise, all of you would die,” Jing Teng replied. She grinned and continued, “I thought I would be separated from you forever because of it, but I’m so happy that I can see you again.”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Zu An’s heart skipped a beat. He just felt that there was something ominous behind her tone.

He was about to ask something when her cold finger pressed lightly against his lips and she said, “Big brother Zu, all I want is to spend this peaceful time with you and not talk about anything else. Is that okay?”

Zu An remained quiet for a moment. Then, he held her hand and replied, “Okay.”

Jing Teng was immediately in high spirits. She said, “Then I’ll bring you around.”

Zu An was startled, thinking, I was about to say that you were pretty familiar with this place!

However, after recalling what she had just said, he didn’t say anything. He silently cooperated with her, chatting about more leisurely topics. He didn’t mention the great tomb or the Ghost King at all.

…

Meanwhile, the Ghost King flew up to the edge of the white lava, looking at the old monk who seemed almost to have gone insane.

“It’s you?” the old monk exclaimed in recognition. His expression changed slightly.

“What the hell are you going crazy here for?” the Ghost King said coldly.

“Earlier, I was…” the old monk began, although he suddenly felt that it was too shameful and changed his tone. “Let me out. I’ll definitely repay you properly for it.”

The Ghost King said coldly, “You’re sealed by the Endless Fire Prison. I can’t help you.”

“You were even able to leave this place, so you definitely have a way to help me!” the old monk exclaimed urgently.

The Ghost King sneered and replied before turning around to leave, “Laughable. Even if I could, why would I help you?”

The old monk suddenly asked, “Aren’t you looking for someone?”

The Ghost King stopped moving.
