Chapter 1452: Real and False WorldNnêw n0vel chapters are published on n0v/e/(lb)i(n.)co/m

Xi He had been wounded quite badly when she fought against Nuba. She had then returned to Scalding Valley to recover, and also to try to contact her husband. She just had a feeling that there was something fishy about the situation, and that there was a huge plot behind it. Meanwhile, the ten Golden Crows didn’t return with her, instead remaining in the air to recover. Xi He was in a rush to contact Emperor Jun, so she didn’t have time to pay attention to them.

Unfortunately, she couldn't contact that playboy Emperor Jun.

She understood clearly that Emperor Jun had many women at his side. Even though she was the Sun Goddess, she was nothing more than another of his lovers. Who knew which vixen’s arms he was resting in right now?

It had been so many years since the two last talked, so how could she contact him so easily? She was starting to feel a bit angry that she couldn't contact him too. That bastard Emperor Jun left just like that without saying a thing. Is he really not worried that I’ll start an affair with someone else?

When she thought about how many lovers Emperor Jun had, Xi He ground her teeth in annoyance. Zu An’s face suddenly appeared in her mind.

It had already been so many years, and this was the first time she had met such a handsome human. Furthermore, he had his unique personality and charm…

Her face turned red when she thought of that. What is going on with me? Why am I thinking about this kind of nonsense? And besides, the other party is a human!

She was still the Sun Goddess, the wife of Emperor Jun. She had experienced many things. She immediately realized that something was wrong with her. She had managed to live for so long without letting any feelings get to her, so why would she suddenly feel as if she were going through the springtime of youth again?

Her expression changed. She suddenly realized something, exclaiming, “The Golden Phoenix’s ability!”

The Golden Crow, Phoenix, and Vermilion Bird all came from the same source. That was why they knew about each other’s skills.

That bastard actually dared to use that kind of skill on me!

You have successfully trolled Xi He for +999 +999 +999…

Xi He was proud and had a high status. How could she stand being cheated by a man? Either way, she couldn't even contact Emperor Jun, so she decided to get revenge on Zu An first.

However, not long after she left Scalding Valley, she felt several destructive auras that made her heart tremble. She watched from a distance as the Golden Crows fell one after another. She was absolutely heartbroken and quickly rushed over.

Unfortunately, the other party fired too quickly. By the time she arrived, nine of the Golden Crows had already been shot down. Nothing else mattered to her anymore, and she quickly spread her arms to protect her sole remaining son.

Her body shook uncontrollably. She felt the terrifying power from the Sun Slaying Bow, and knew that such a divine weapon that was born naturally from the world and supported by the power of a Celestial Emperor wasn’t something she could stop. Still, she didn’t hesitate to use her own body to block its trajectory for her son.

She was extremely startled when she saw the man who was holding the bow. Never could she have expected it to actually be Zu An. They had faced each other in Scalding Valley. Although he could be considered quite excellent among humans, in front of her, he wasn’t even worth mentioning.

And yet, in the end, her sons had actually lost their lives to his arrows…

Xi He was overwhelmed with hatred. If she had known this would happen, she would have killed him back in Scalding Valley. She felt that way even more intensely when she remembered that he had used the Golden Phoenix’s skill on her, and how miserably her sons had died. All she felt was endless hate for Zu An.

You have successfully trolled Xi He for +1024 +1024 +1024…

When he saw Xi He and the endless stream of Rage points, Zu An’s head gradually cleared. He saw Xi He staring at him, filled with anger and fear. In that instant, he was filled with all sorts of emotions.

Yun Jianyue quickly warned him through ki transmission, “Little An, don’t show any mercy right now! You already killed nine of her sons and established a terrible grudge. If you show mercy now, she’ll definitely seek revenge on you.”

Yan Xuehen cultivated the Unshakable Daoist Manual. Even though she felt the suggestion was a bit cruel, she knew it would be the most suitable method, so she didn’t argue against what Yun Jianyue said.

Even though Yu Yanluo’s natural disposition was kind, when it involved Zu An’s safety, she would naturally stand by his side.

Zu An’s expression changed several times. In the end, however, he put the bow away and said, “You should leave.”

Yun Jianyue exclaimed in shock, “Little An?!”

Zu An shook his head slightly toward her. Then, he looked at Xi He in the sky and said, “You let us go before, so how could I do this to you? As for the Golden Crows earlier, it wasn’t because we had any private grudges, but rather because they came out together and harmed the people of the world. A decree came from above, so of course I had to help the people.”

When he saw that there was only one sun left, he knew he couldn't continue to fire at it. Otherwise, the entire world would fall into endless darkness. It was the perfect chance to appease Xi He.

Of course, he could have set his resolve to shoot down Xi He with the last arrow, which would leave behind one sun. He wouldn’t have to worry about Xi He’s revenge then, either.

However, he had used ‘Love Is More Solid than Gold’ on her and felt guilty to begin with. He had even killed nine of her sons. He wasn’t a cold-blooded murderer, so how could he continue doing something like that?

Still, he wasn’t stupid either. He placed all of the blame on Zhuan Xu, implying that he was the main culprit behind all of this, and that if Xi He wanted to get revenge, she should take it out on Zhuan Xu. However, he had killed nine of her sons, so he couldn't control how she would feel.

Xi He stared at him with a conflicted expression. She had never expected him to show her mercy. After all, the rational choice was to kill her to prevent future disaster. Could it be that he really does care a bit about me?

She quickly tossed that thought out of her mind. Damn it, that Golden Phoenix’s skill is activating again!

“You will regret it if you do not kill me,” she said coldly.

Zu An replied with a sigh, “Regardless of what kind of consequence it brings, I won’t regret my choice today.”

Xi He gave him a deep look. Then, she took her last, trembling son into her carriage and flew away, exclaiming, “One day, I will definitely kill you!”

Her voice echoed in the air as she left.

Zu An’s expression stiffened, leaving behind only a bitter smile.

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “You really are a sex-crazed maniac.”

Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo also had strange expressions when they looked at him.

Zu An could only explain, “I couldn’t just shoot down all ten suns. What are the living things of the world supposed to do if there’s no sun?”

“You could have left behind one Golden Crow, but why Xi He?” Yun Jianyue asked. She was the Devil Sect’s Sect Master, so she knew the importance of pulling out problems by the roots.

Zu An said, “The ones who caused the disaster were the ten Golden Crows, not her. Furthermore, she’s Emperor Jun’s wife. I left behind one Golden Crow and spared Xi He, so to a certain degree, I’ve shown some kindness. Otherwise, Emperor Jun might really go all out to kill me.”

When they heard his explanation, the three women realized that the decision did make some sense. Still, they couldn't help but mumble, “You’re speaking such high-minded words, but isn’t the main reason because she’s a pretty woman?”

Zu An chuckled in embarrassment. Indeed, he just couldn't bring himself to kill Xi He.

Spirit Mountain’s Ten Shamans slowly recovered. One after another, they expressed their thanks to Zu An for saving the world. Zu An only replied humbly, but he secretly worried, wondering when Emperor Jun’s revenge would come.

Suddenly, an indescribable ripple of natural ki coursed through the world, and it seemed to be disappearing quickly.

Spirit Mountain’s Ten Shamans seemed to have received some kind of order. Their expressions changed greatly, and they said to Zu An, “After this matter, the heavens have reached an agreement to sever the paths between heaven and earth completely, to fully separate the mortal realm and heaven. We must follow the will of heaven and leave. Little brother, we’re sure we’ll meet you again!”

As soon as they finished speaking, an incomparably powerful radiance scattered down through the world. Spirit Mountain seemed to be covered in a layer of translucent film. Then, the shamans vanished right before the group’s eyes.

When the light passed, Spirit Mountain was still in front of them, and the plants weren’t too different from before, but Zu An knew that it was no longer the Spirit Mountain from before. The abundant ki had grown sparse, and it no longer felt too different from the ordinary mountain in his previous world. He couldn't sense the many mysterious, hidden auras across Spirit Mountain anymore.

It wasn’t just Spirit Mountain; the rest of the land had changed completely too. For example, the Weak Water was no longer boundless, and had instead turned into an ordinary, broad river.

Zu An was alarmed. This place clearly looked the same from the outside, but it was completely different in essence. It was like the difference between the real world and an illusory world.
