Chapter 191: Choice

Translator: Pika

“How do I do it? Can’t you just finish your words at once?” Zu An was frustrated at how Mi Li seemed to reveal bits and pieces of information, as if trying to reel him in.

Chu Chuyan also looked at Mi Li in anticipation. Needless to say, she would rather recover her full cultivation than to just recover her mobility.

With a gleam in her eyes, Mi Li asked, “Have you heard of ‘transcendent aptitude’ before?”

“Transcendent aptitude?” Chu Chuyan and Qiao Xueying traded gazes, but they could see the doubt in each other’s eyes.

Qiao Xueying pondered for a moment before speaking up, “Based on what I know, transcendent aptitude is just a legend. In fact, many doubt the veracity of its existence as even the most talented cultivators in the world are only at Upper Jia (A+), and there are less than ten of them around. Given so, how could transcendent aptitude really exist?”

Both Chu Chuyan and Qiao Xueying were already extremely talented individuals, but they were only at Lower Jia. Every step above signified a huge difference, such that even cultivators of Upper Jia aptitude were far beyond their reach, let alone transcendent aptitude.

“You need not doubt the validity of its existence,” said Mi Li. She pointed to Zu An and continued, “That’s because he’s one.”

“???” Chu Chuyan.

“???” Qiao Xueying.

The two of them turned to look at Zu An in unison.

He possesses the legendary transcendent aptitude? How is that possible?!

The two women were extremely familiar with him, so they knew how much of a renowned wastrel he was in Brightmoon City. Back then, before taking Zu An in as her husband, Chu Chuyan even secretly had his aptitude checked, and he should have been at Lower Ding (D-).

Even if he had been hiding his true skills and cultivation all this while, surely he couldn’t conceal his aptitude too?

“He’s a transcendent aptitude cultivator? Elder, could you be mistaken?” asked Chu Chuyan.

It was true that Zu An had impressed her with his skills this time around, but she was still unable to even fathom him being of the legendary transcendent aptitude. Even her Lower Jia (A-) aptitude was already enough for her to reach the sixth rank, so how could he possibly still only be at the third rank at the moment?

“I’m also perplexed by how weak he is, but there’s no way I would be mistaken about this. I came into contact with his blood earlier, and he definitely possesses transcendent aptitude,” replied Mi Li.

Feeling the gazes of the three women being centered on him, Zu An scratched his head in embarrassment and said, “I was intending to conceal my aptitude and blend into the midst of normal folks like you, but it looks like I’ve been found out. Yes, I’m indeed someone who possesses the legendary aptitude. I hope that you won’t treat me any differently because of that in the future.”

“...” Chu Chuyan.

“...” Qiao Xueying.

The two of them were utterly bewildered by his admittance. What’s wrong with the world? A fellow like him actually possesses transcendent aptitude?

Even with both Mi Li and Zu An confirming the matter, his lackadaisical air around him still made them think that he was just joking with them.

“It’s common knowledge that transcendent aptitude cultivators grow swiftly, but that in itself is not enough to be considered transcendent. The key reason why they are considered transcendent is because their blood essence is top-notch nourishment to all cultivators. Those who consume the blood essence of a transcendent aptitude cultivator can greatly increase the speed of their cultivation and heal all of their injuries. In fact, there are even rumors that if one were to assimilate all of the blood essence a transcendent aptitude cultivator possesses, one can achieve true longevity,” said Mi Li.

“Big sis empress, can you stop licking your lips? You’re making me a bit afraid.” Zu An gulped fearfully as he finally understood why Jiang Luofu had directed a weird look toward him upon realizing that he was a transcendent aptitude cultivator.

Aiyo, you should have just said it earlier. If gorgeous principal needs my ‘essence’, I’d be more than willing to give it to you... Ah, wait a moment, it’s not the same essence.

“Longevity?!” Chu Chuyan and Qiao Xueying exclaimed in astonishment.

There were many cultivators in this world who lived a far longer lifespan than ordinary humans, but thus far, none of them had been able to truly escape death. Even for Mi Li, they thought that she had only been able to live so long because she had been converted into an undead even if there were some anomalies here.

Undead creatures trade their bodies and physical functions in order to attain a greater lifespan, so it was unheard of for any undead to be able to retain their beauty like Mi Li.

“The part regarding longevity should be false,” said Mi Li with a shake of her head. “In the history of humankind, I’ve never heard of any transcendent aptitude cultivator achieving true longevity before. Ying Zheng has also tried pursuing longevity back then, resorting to all sorts of means including capturing and assimilating a transcendent aptitude cultivator, but he wasn’t able to achieve his goal in the end.”

Chu Chuyan and Qiao Xueying looked confused. They clearly had never heard of Ying Zheng before.

Zu An, on the other hand, was appalled. As expected of Qin Shihuang! He actually has the ability to find a transcendent aptitude cultivator and assimilate him.

On one hand, he felt sympathetic to his ‘fellow comrade who possessed transcendent aptitude’, but at the same time, he found himself wondering what kind of state Mi Li was in at the moment. If even Qin Shihuang was unable to achieve longevity, it was hard for him to imagine how Mi Li was able to survive through so many years, albeit in a sealed state.

“Elder, you still haven’t told me what I have to do in order to restore Miss Chu’s ki meridians.” Qiao Xueying had always been short-tempered, and she noticed how Mi Li still hadn’t gotten to the crux of the matter despite blabbering on for so long.

“Haven’t I made it plenty obvious by now?” Mi Li harrumphed. “He just has to infuse his blood essence and channel the Primordial Origin Sutra along with his primordial ki into her body, and that would be sufficient to restore her ki meridians.”

“Blood essence?” Chu Chuyan was confused. “Do I have to drink his blood?”

Mi Li frowned. “Aren’t the two of you a couple? Why don’t you get anything at all?”

All of a sudden, Chu Chuyan suddenly realized something, and the same thought surfaced in Qiao Xueying’s mind as well. The two of them quickly whispered to one another as their faces reddened in embarrassment[1].

“B-but... How can that be drunk...” Chu Chuyan had never felt so embarrassed before. She had to squeeze out the very last bit of courage she had in her body in order to utter those words.

“Drunk?” Mi Li was stunned for a moment before realizing what Chu Chuyan was thinking of. A bizarre smile crept on her lips as she said, “It’s not wrong to put it that way, but you’re ‘drinking’ it not through that mouth.”

“...” Zu An.

Big sis empress, you would surely have been a meme master had you lived in the modern era.

Qiao Xueying and Chu Chuyan were maidens, but they weren’t so ignorant as to be unable to comprehend what Mi Li was talking about, especially since the latter had made it rather explicit. Their faces turned so red that they looked almost like ripe apples ready to be bitten into.

Mi Li also didn’t bother beating around the bush. “The bloodline of a transcendent aptitude cultivator possesses great life force and mystical energy whereas the primordial ki is the purest substance in the whole world. You’d need the two of them in order to restore your ki meridians I’ll impart to you a formula in order to draw in the ‘essence’ he’s pumping into you during the amalgamation of yin and yang later on, lest you end up wasting such precious energy and fail to make a full recovery.”

“H-how can I do that?!” Chu Chuyan’s face was completely flushed, and she was so nervous that she could hear her own heart beating in a fluster. She had never thought that the cure would be something like this.

While she was a couple with Zu An, that had only been in name. It was just to silence the mouths of the other powers.

She was touched that Zu An had put his life on the line to save her, and there was no doubt that she carried great goodwill for him at the moment. But still, this was her first time encountering such a situation, so it was inevitable that she would feel intimidated and frightened.

Meanwhile, Qiao Xueying pressed her lips together with a brooding look in her eyes. She had never expected things to turn out like that, and it left her feeling a little dazed.

“What’s wrong with this?” asked Mi Li in bewilderment. “The two of you are a couple... Hm? You’re still a maiden?”

She finally understood what the crux of the problem was. She turned to Zu An and exclaimed, “You’re unable to do it?”

How could a man be told to his face that he was ‘unable to do it’? Zu An immediately roared back, “Who says that!”

His voice was a little shaky though since he was indeed impotent till a while ago...

Nevertheless, his words reminded Mi Li of that tent in his pants she saw in the crystal coffin a moment ago, and it brought a hint of awkwardness to her face. I guess I had misunderstood him. “Since you’re able to do it, why in the world are you leaving your beautiful wife to wilt on her own?”

“...” Zu An.

Sis, trust me. I want to do it too! I just... can’t!

“Forget it, you don’t have to say anything. I reckon that it’s some sort of ridiculous melodrama at play here.” Mi Li suddenly sounded a little irritated. She turned to Chu Chuyan and said, “Based on what I’ve seen thus far, the two of you carry mutual feelings for one another. I don’t understand what your reason for rejecting is, but are you certain that you would rather remain an ordinary human who can’t even raise your hands above your shoulders for the rest of your life?”

Qiao Xueying hesitated for a moment before advising her too, “Miss Chu, you should know of the terrible plight the Chu clan is in at the moment. You won’t be able to protect the Chu clan anymore if you were to become a cripple. Zu An has nearly lost his life multiple times in order to save your life. Are you going to let his sacrifice and hard work go to vain?

“I know that someone of your caliber is bound to have high expectations for your future partner, but what’s done is done. Zu An is your husband after all, and a day like this is bound to come. Do you detest him so much as to reject him even when your future is at stake here?”

“No, that’s not it... It’s just that...” Chu Chuyan’s eyelids fluttered as an internal conflict broke out in her heart.

Mi Li shot a glance at Zu An and urged him with her voice transmission. “Are you a man or not? What are you standing there in a daze for?! Are you still expecting her to make the first move?”

Zu An finally snapped out of her daze. He gathered his determination before walking over to Chu Chuyan’s side and carried her soft body up before whispering tenderly in her ears, “Am I not alright?”

Chu Chuyan was taken aback by the sudden snow of tenderness, and it left her even more flustered. “N-no, that’s not it. It’s just that...”

“Just listen to me this once. For both of our sakes...” said Zu An while gazing deep into her eyes.

Chu Chuyan had never seen such an earnest look on Zu An’s face before, and it made her face turn red. She hesitated for a long moment before finally nodding inconspicuously.

Qiao Xueying sighed deeply before walking out.

Mi Li quickly imparted a formula to Chu Chuyan before remarking, “You should have the formula remembered by now. Make sure to use it later on.”

Before taking her leave, she noticed that quite a few terracotta soldiers were still sneaking peeks over, so she sneered and said, “The lot of you want to watch the show?”

The terracotta soldiers immediately turned their heads away and stood still, as if having turned back into statues.

Mi Li harrumphed before. She flung her sleeves and formed a veil of ki around the altar.

Inside the veil, Zu An placed Chu Chuyan on top of the stone tablet as he gently undid her belt, revealing her fair skin.

The chilling sensation tingled Chu Chuyan’s skin. She couldn’t help but hesitate here. “W-wait a moment, Zu An! I... I don’t know...”

Zu An sighed softly and said, “Do you hate me?” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“N-no, that’s not it...” Chu Chuyan couldn’t even meet Zu An’s gaze. She turned her head sideward as a tinge of red consumed her body. “It’s just that... just that...”

Chu Chuyan was so flustered that she couldn’t say anything meaningful in a long while.

Zu An leaned in closer and gently sealed off her cherry lips, causing Chu Chuyan’s eyes to widen largely. In that instant, her mind turned blank.
