Chapter 1705: Royal Family Chaos

“What kind of problem?” Zu An asked, stunned. When he saw her serious expression, he didn’t dare to joke any further.

Yan Xuehen’s pretty brows furrowed. She replied, “Think about it. When Yun Jianyue was exposed, as the leader of the daoist sects, wasn’t Wang Wuxie a bit too quiet?”

Zu An recalled the previous situation and reflexively nodded. Back then, Wang Wuxie seemed to have lacked more presence than even Watchful Heart Peak Master Feng Wuchang. Furthermore, Wang Wuxie hadn’t interfered when Yun Jianyue was about to attack Feng Wuchang. It was actually Master Jian Huang who had saved him.

“Also, when the secret dungeon was opened, Wang Wuxie didn’t say much either. His behavior just seems really strange,” Yan Xuehen continued. Even though she was frowning, she was still extremely beautiful.

Zu An said with a smile, “Maybe his condition has just been poor these past few days. He said earlier that he had something he needed to work with the emperor on for the Fengshan Ceremony. Maybe his attention isn’t on the daoist faction right now? His cultivation is so high, there’s no way someone could be impersonating him the way Yun Jianyue impersonated Elder Peng, right?”

“I don’t think it’s an impersonation. He’s probably still Wang Wuxie, but I just feel that something is strange…” Yan Xuehen trailed off, hesitating for a moment. Eventually, she said, “You’ve probably heard that Wang Wuxie pursued me in the past…”

“What do you mean, pursued? He was crazily infatuated with you,” Zu An said with a sigh. After all, no one wanted another man to keep thinking about their woman.

“That was nothing more than his one-sided attention. I’ve never liked him,” Yan Xuehen quickly replied. She was stunned after she said that, too. Why did she have to explain such a thing to him?

Zu An felt a bit happy when he heard the enthusiasm in her reply. He asked, “What does him liking you have to do with what you just said?”

Yan Xuehen’s face turned a bit red. She said in embarrassment, “Ever since I arrived at Violet Mountain, I’ve gotten the impression that Wang Wuxie was no longer as… crazy as before. However, occasionally, he still… looked at me with that strange gaze. I didn’t want him to have any misunderstandings, so I pretended not to notice. However, he hasn’t looked at me once over the past few days.”

Zu An couldn't help but laugh. He remarked, “Isn’t it a bit saddening when you find out one of your fans no longer cares that much about you?” He had even seen a few of those expressions himself, so he had a pretty strong impression.

Yan Xuehen frowned and snapped,“I’m talking about something serious here. If you continue to act like that, I’m going to become angry!”

Zu An set aside his joking demeanor and said, “This really is quite strange. Then perhaps we should look around Pure Yang Palace tonight?”

Yan Xuehen shook her head and said, “Forget it. Wang Wuxie’s cultivation is extremely high. If we went over and got discovered, that would only cause a lot of complications.” She didn’t want her close relationship with Zu An to be known by those from the daoist sects.

Zu An was stunned. He asked, “If you don’t want to look into it, why did you come to talk about this with me?”

Yan Xuehen said emotionlessly, “I just wanted to warn you, that’s it.” She left in annoyance afterward.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +222 +222 +222…

Zu An felt a bit strange as he watched her leave, thinking, What is she suddenly getting angry for?

A while later, he finally realized what just happened. I really am dumb! She just came to see me, and that was just some random excuse! And there I was, digging into her excuse.

However, he had a huge smile on his face when he realized that.

…

When he returned to his room, Zu An took out his recording mirror and began to dial a special rune code. A while later, the call successfully connected. A ripple spread across the mirror surface like water, and a beauty with a red beauty mark between her brows appeared.

“Did anything major happen?” Bi Linglong asked in surprise.

After all, the cost of activating the recording mirror was quite high. Not even the court would use such a method unless it was extremely important. That wasn’t even accounting for the fact that she was the crown princess. If someone saw that she was secretly talking to a man through the recording mirror, that would cause huge problems. Fortunately, she was away from the capital and had a bit more freedom.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Can’t I just call you if I miss you?” Zu An replied with a sigh. “I thought that you wouldn’t be doing so well after I left, but your face is glowing with health. You’re even a bit prettier than when I left the capital now… Sigh, I feel so broken-hearted.”

“Hmph, no way,” Bi Linglong said with a scoff. She subconsciously touched her face. Even though she knew that he was flattering her, she still couldn't help but feel happy. She said, “You’re the one who's rosy from ear to ear. I reckon that you have quite a few beauties at your side.”

Zu An cried out inwardly in guilt, but there was no way he would admit to it.

After the two of them chatted for a while, Zu An finally began to ask indirectly about Concubine Bai’s situation. Bi Linglong’s expression immediately changed. She said, “I was just wondering why you contacted me. So it was because of another woman!”

The screen blurred, and the recording mirror turned into an ordinary mirror. Bi Linglong had clearly hung up on Zu An, leaving him speechless.

A while later, the recording mirror suddenly rippled. Bi Linglong was clearly calling him back. Zu An tapped the mirror to activate it, and Bi Linglong appeared again with an ice-cold expression.

“His Majesty had Concubine Bai accompany him when he left the capital. I do not know anything else,” Bi Linglong said coldly.

Zu An was stunned. He asked, “Shouldn’t the emperor have brought his own wife? Isn’t it a huge scandal to bring his daughter-in-law?”

Bi Linglong corrected him unhappily, “His majesty only has one daughter-in-law, and that’s me. Concubine Bai is nothing more than a concubine of the crown prince. Even though it’s a bit inappropriate to bring her, it isn’t anything to make a huge fuss over either.” After a brief pause, she continued, “Furthermore, Concubine Bai was his majesty’s woman to begin with. It was because he was worried about the crown prince’s… slow nature that he had her serve him. Then, Concubine Bai gave birth to the imperial grandson not long after.”

Zu An’s expression changed. He replied, “You’re implying that the child is actually the emperor’s?”

Apart from playing around with mud every day, what else did the crown prince know? He had never even touched such a pretty crown princess after so many years, so how could he possibly impregnate Concubine Bai in such a short amount of time?

“I never said that,” Bi Linglong said expressionlessly. She continued, “But her status is quite special. Even if you are a pervert, keep your paws off her.” She cut off the call again immediately afterward. Zu An tried to call her again, but there was no response.

Zu An was a bit flustered by this information. Even though he’d had his guesses earlier, he was still a bit alarmed now that it had been confirmed.

This Zhao Han really does play hard! He gave his own concubine to his son to become his concubine, but then he wanted his own son to call his older brother dad?

Still, this was the same man who had previously sent a split soul into the crown prince’s body, and had also prepared his daughter-in-law, the crown princess, for himself in the future. Now that Zu An thought about it again, it wasn’t that strange anymore.

After receiving that information, Zu An wasn’t all that worried about Concubine Bai’s safety anymore. At the very least, there would be no threat to her life for some time. However, could the Devil Sect’s plan be considered a success now? The future imperial grandson even carried their bloodline…

When he thought about that complicated relationship, after a while, Zu An sighed. He muttered, “The imperial family really is messy!”

…

There wasn’t much left for him to do in Violet Mountain. Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman had both gone into the dungeon and wouldn’t come out for a while. As such, Zu An decided to take on the role of messenger to report on their work and to greet the emperor’s troops, which would also let him look into Concubine Bai’s situation. Concubine Bai’s identity was very sensitive, so there was no way the emperor would let his subjects deal with her. He probably still kept her by his side.

Zu An woke up Xie Daoyun, who had been knocked unconscious by Yun Jianyue, and told her where he was going. He thought of escorting her back along the way too.

However, Xie Daoyun shook her head and said, “The task teacher assigned me isn’t complete yet. I need to stay at Violet Mountain for a while longer.”

Zu An was a bit surprised. Just what kind of mission had Yan Xiangu given her, for her to have to stay here for so long? Still, he couldn't ask too many questions. He left after telling her a few more things.

Next, he went to Yan Xuehen’s courtyard to bid her farewell. Of course, the pretext was that the emperor had summoned him.

When she listened to what he had to say, Yan Xuehen said indifferently, “Just leave if you’re leaving. Why are you telling me?”

Zu An stared at her perfect face before saying, “I was worried that you wouldn’t be able to find me if you ever needed me.”

“Who would look for you?!” Yan Xuehen snapped with a frown. She immediately turned around.

Zu An knew that this was just how she was and didn’t push the issue. He waved toward her, then walked out.

Just as he was about to leave, Yan Xuehen said gently, “Take care of yourself.”

“I will,” Zu An replied, immediately feeling his mood improve a lot. He turned around and opened his arms toward her before saying, “We might not see each other for a long time. Can I get a hug as a goodbye?”

He thought she would tell him to get lost, but to his surprise, after a moment of hesitation, Yan Xuehen slowly walked over and hugged him lightly. She knew that Zu An wouldn’t be in any real danger with his current cultivation. Still, the one he was facing was Zhao Han… Furthermore, after recalling what Yun Jianyue had said earlier, she was suddenly a bit worried that if she gave up on this chance, she could end up with some irredeemable regret.

At first, Zu An was stunned when he sensed the cold and soft body in his arms. Then, he was overjoyed and took her firmly into his arms.

Yan Xuehen was extremely embarrassed. She instinctively wanted to push him away, but was no match for how tightly he was holding her. She gradually stopped resisting so much.

“It’s a good thing that there are no White Jade Sect disciples in this courtyard. Chuyan also went into the secret dungeon…”
