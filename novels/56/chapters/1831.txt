Chapter 1780: Surrounded

Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan followed the Gray Wolf Mercenary Group up ahead. She secretly felt happy that she was going to reunite with Ah Zu in the secret dungeon. It seems like the heavens are quite kind to me.

However, she suddenly shivered and quickly drew her longsword and vigilantly looked behind her.

With a frivolous whistle, a voice suddenly said, “Oh? This girl is actually pretty vigilant.”

Soon, a group of people emerged from all sides. They were none other than the mercenary group from earlier, but there were no horses in sight.

Chu Chuyan shivered. When had these people circled around her? She hadn’t noticed any changes happening ahead because she was being extremely careful and following from a distance. She coldly asked, “What is the meaning of this?”

“Shouldn’t we be asking that same question back at you?” the mercenary group leader replied as he completed the encirclement. “What are you following all sneakily behind us for?”

Chu Chuyan felt a shiver run down her spine. However, she still replied, “This road is so large; it doesn’t belong to you. Why would you assume that I’m following you just because I’m taking it?”

The scar-faced leader roared with laughter and replied, “Your tongue is quite sharp, little girl. But we’re all smart people here. Do you think we’ll believe your nonsense?”

“What are you doing right now?” Chu Chuyan asked. However, she gathered all her ki while secretly sizing up her surroundings to look for opportunities to break out.

However, the group seemed very experienced in this kind of maneuver. They appeared to be standing around her rather carefreely, but they actually cut off all angles of escape. No matter which direction she ran in, she would be caught by three people. Then, the others would quickly catch up.

The scar-faced leader laughed maliciously and said, “I already let you go earlier, and yet you just continued to throw yourself at us. Thus, you can only blame…”

Midway through the sentence, Chu Chuyan quickly attacked. She knew that there was no way for the two sides to settle things peacefully, so she didn’t wait for him to finish his sentence and seized the initiative instead. With a flash, she arrived in front of the weakest-looking mercenary. Snowflakes fluttered through the air, and her sword flickered through the air, thrusting through his neck before he could even react. There was no chance of him surviving the attack.

The two other men nearby were furious. They both drew their weapons to attack her. The two were clearly seasoned fighters and different from ordinary people. Even so, a snowy mist appeared in front of them, and by the time their attacks entered the snow, the target was already missing.

“Be careful!” the scar-faced leader roared, having already run in the other direction.

It turned out that after Chu Chuyan’s first lethal strike drew the others’ attention, she had used the mist to dart in a different direction to attack another mercenary who looked weaker. The mercenary frantically blocked with his weapon, but unfortunately, Chu Chuyan had remained in seclusion for so long that her cultivation had already reached an entirely different level. When her sword thrust forth, it quickly passed her opponent’s weapon and appeared next to his throat.

At first, it seemed as if she would be able to take another life, but a projection of armor appeared around his body. Even though it definitely couldn't block Chu Chuyan’s sword, shattering almost instantly, the mercenary managed to buy a moment of respite. He quickly fled backward.

At the same time, countless attacks came from all directions. Chu Chuyan could only evade and couldn't continue the assault.

…

“Miss Chu really is too beautiful. Even while dodging, her movements look as if she’s dancing,” said the distant Rising Sun Prince, who was secretly watching.

“Prince, should we go and help her now?” the protector surnamed Sun asked.

The Rising Sun Prince shook his head and replied, “Not yet.”

Gray Wolf Mercenary Group, you guys are so famous; you’d better not let me down!

…

Meanwhile, on the battlefield, Chu Chuyan’s gaze landed on a tall and skinny man in the distance. He had a yellow talisman in hand and was muttering something. The scale armor projection had clearly been created by that talisman. Her brows furrowed. This mercenary group had close combat attackers, and even a talisman user hiding in the back. If she couldn't deal with that person, his preparations would result in her inevitable defeat.

The scar-faced leader warned the others, “Be careful. This girl is even stronger than we imagined.”

Even without his reminder, the mercenaries who were used to licking blood off their blades had already put away their initial carelessness after seeing her attacks. There were no smiles left on their faces; now, there was only ruthless bloodlust.

Thus, there was no need to give any instructions. They all unleashed their attacks. A giant wolf covered in flames, countless streaks of blade energy, an arrow that was as fast as lightning… Countless fists that carried tremendous power, a ball of light that flickered with electricity, an earthquake from below, two large hands grabbing at her…

They clearly didn’t hold back at all despite her extreme beauty. They all used their most powerful skills to immediately restrain her.

Chu Chuyan’s expression changed. Snow  lotuses suddenly appeared beneath her one after another. Her extremely profound movements seemed as if they would let her dodge the attacks. Suddenly, however, she felt her body become heavier. In that instant, it was as if the space around her had been restricted. She shivered. When she looked at the distant talisman master, she immediately realized that he was using a skill.

With that delay, all of the dazzling attacks arrived, and a grave look appeared on Chu Chuyan’s face. A dense gathering of snowflakes suddenly appeared all around her. Every single one was made of sword energy condensed from the Snowflake Sword.

When those attacks entered the surroundings, the snowflakes exploded. The arrow at the forefront was deflected by her sword. The powerful fists were turned into frozen sculptures by the countless snowflakes as well. The ruthless blade energy continued to clash with the snowflakes and melted. The giant wolf of flames began to sizzle, as if it would be extinguished at a moment’s notice…

However, these attacks were a bit too tough, so even with the Snowflake Sword, she couldn't block all of them. Some of them struck Chu Chuyan’s body, and she coughed out a mouthful of blood. The mercenaries were all quite strong, and they were too numerous. Alone, she wasn’t their match at all.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“There are actually signs of a domain forming! She’s still so young. If she’s allowed to grow a few more years, none of us will be her match!” the scar-faced leader cried in horror. His eyes were filled with killing intent. When a genius with unlimited potential was offended, the best thing to do was to kill her before she was allowed to grow. He could no longer sit still and attacked her too.

Chu Chuyan’s internal energies were in chaos, but she didn’t have time to adjust her condition. She quickly avoided the mercenary leader and used her incredibly ingenious movement skill to rush at the others. She no longer wanted to experience being surrounded and attacked from all sides again.

Soon after, two people were injured by her sword. However, she sighed in regret. She didn’t have time to kill them before the other attacks arrived. The mercenaries were worried that they would be dragged down with her during her final desperate struggle, so they did their best to protect themselves. Either way, they had so many people that they could just slowly wear her down.

Chu Chuyan tried to break out several times, but she was always blocked and forced back. When the scar-faced leader saw that victory was already in his grasp, he roared with laughter and said, “Little lady, I didn’t expect you to be so pretty and so formidable. Us Gray Wolf Mercenaries respect the strong the most. If you surrender to us and become our madam, we can just forget about today’s matter. How about it?”

Before Chu Chuyan even answered, the other mercenaries became rowdy and saying, “Boss, you’re being unfair here! We already said that this beauty belongs to all of us, so how can you enjoy her all on your own?”

The scar-faced leader roared with laughter and replied, “I didn’t say that she would be my own madam; of course she’ll be our entire stockade’s madam.”

He felt a bit of regret inwardly. This woman really was too strong and he really wanted her all to himself. Unfortunately, there were several others in the group who were about as strong as him. If he pissed them all off, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to remain the leader.

Suddenly, Chu Chuyan’s figure flickered. She completely turned into fluttering snow and attacked in the opposite direction.

The people there were stunned when they saw her sword technique. Did she lose her mind? Would an attack from that far away hit?

However, they didn’t act carelessly and raised their weapons to defend themselves. As long as they defended for a while longer, their companions' attacks would be enough to seriously wound her first.

Suddenly, bright red silk shot out from her sleeves, instantly passing over them and wrapping itself around the talisman master behind them. That person was horrified. He immediately tried to use talismans to resist, but the red silk quickly pulled back with a bone-shattering crunch. He screamed miserably.

The man had actually been strangled to death on the spot!

Talisman masters weren’t good at close combat, and their bodies were weak too. How could they endure the full force pull of the Primal Skysilk?

The scar-faced leader's eyes immediately turned red. Only then did he realize that this woman’s efforts to break out of the encirclement were all a facade. Her real target had always been that talisman master!

After all, the use of a talisman master for a mercenary group was extremely great. A talisman master could offer shields, healing, and all sorts of controlling skills. It could be said that their importance in a mercenary group definitely ranked among the top three. Now that the talisman master had died, even if their strength didn’t decrease by half, it would at least drop by a third!

Chu Chuyan used the force of the Primal Skysilk’s pull to avoid the attacks behind her. She leapt over the mercenaries who were completely focused on defending and jumped straight out of their encirclement!

Just then, however, a hammer roared over from right in front of her. Chu Chuyan had no choice but to dodge to the side. In that instant, the mercenaries surrounded her again.

“Boss, I didn’t expect you to almost let this little lady get away. Thank goodness I got here promptly,” a man with softer features said as he gradually appeared from the road ahead.
