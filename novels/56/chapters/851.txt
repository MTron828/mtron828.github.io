Chapter 824: A World for Only Two

The Jade Moon Serpent had wanted to try to drown him to death. Unfortunately, it had made the wrong choice.

If it were any other human, even if it were a master rank cultivator, they would be in quite the tough spot once they were dragged to the pool’s depths Whether it was breathing or fighting, humans would be at a disadvantage. But Zu An had the Blue Mallard skill, granting him powerful water affinity. The water was like a second home for him.

How could the Jade Moon Serpent have known about this? It had seen that not only was Zu An not affected, he had instead become stronger and stronger. That huge psychological blow made it panic. Together with Zu An constantly approaching its weak point, it was ultimately killed by Zu An after a long battle.

Zu An jumped back into the pool. With Blue Mallard protecting him, it was as if he were walking on smooth ground. He quickly searched the area.

Because of the waterfall and the intense battle, the water was rippling so greatly that it was hard to see. However, that didn’t block Zu An from sensing what he needed to see. He could sense the situation through his affinity with the water element and didn’t need to use his eyes.

He suddenly thought of something and quickly dove down like a fish. Soon, he noticed Bi Linglong. She was struggling frantically in the water, her face entirely red. She had ended up being caught within several undercurrents and couldn’t break free no matter what she did. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Sixth rank cultivators could form a ki barrier around themselves, and that would provide them with some air underwater. However, Bi Linglong had clearly already run out of oxygen. She was now suffocating and couldn’t even maintain the ki barrier. She had already drunk a lot of water. A hint of despair flashed through her eyes. She hadn’t expected that not only would she fail to save anyone, but she herself might also drown here.

Suddenly, the figure of a familiar man came into view. Bi Linglong felt a bit dizzy. It was rumored that people would see things when they were about to die. Could it be that even though she was going to die, she didn’t see her parents, didn’t see the crown prince, but instead saw him?

Suddenly, she felt a strong arm pull her in, and then a steady voice spoke in her ears. “It’s alright now!” She felt a sense of relief overtake her. She no longer tried to hold on and immediately fainted.

Zu An hadn’t expected her to faint. He raised his head and looked around. This was close to the bottom of the pool, so it would take some time before they would reach the surface. She might not be able to hold out for that long.

Suddenly, a light caught his eye. He turned around and saw a giant aquatic cave. This was probably the Jade Moon Serpent’s dwelling! It had probably used its water abilities to set up an energy barrier in the vicinity, opening up a space there. There were formations set up nearby because the nest was right there. The whirlpool that had trapped Bi Linglong just now had been formed because of one of the formations.

Zu An didn’t dare to waste time and quickly carried Bi Linglong to the transparent barrier. It clearly contained a restriction, but it didn’t stop him, as he had a strong affinity with the water element. When he reached out his hand, the barrier and the water element resonated. Then, he went inside with Bi Linglong.

Past the barrier was a dry world. Apart from the bit of water on the ground, the rest of the space contained oxygen.

Zu An carried Bi Linglong to a gazebo inside the barrier and called, “Linglong, wake up!”

But Bi Linglong was still unconscious and didn’t respond at all. Zu An saw that her belly was swelling a bit. He realized that she had drunk too much water, and so he quickly moved to apply CPR.

His palms crossed over her chest and continuously pressed down. He suddenly remembered that when he had first crossed over, this was how he had saved Snow as well, and Chu Chuyan had just happened to catch him doing that. There won’t be some weird misunderstanding this time as well, right?

After performing compressions for a while, his expression grew serious. Even though Bi Linglonghad already spat out a lot of water, she still hadn’t woken up. Furthermore, her breathing was becoming increasingly weak, like a candle flame in the wind that might go out at any time.

Zu An quickly stooped down to provide her with oxygen. After the procedure continued for a long time, Bi Linglong finally slowly opened her eyes with a few coughs.

Zu An sighed in relief, saying, “You’re finally awake. Looks like I didn’t learn CPR in my past world for nothing.”

“Ah Zu…” Bi Linglong’s vision was blurry. She didn’t dare to believe what she was seeing. “Did I already die, and are we meeting in the afterlife?”

“Pah pah pah! We’re both perfectly fine, okay? What do you mean dead?” Zu An quickly corrected her.

Bi Linglong snapped out of her daze. She asked with shock and pleasant surprise, “Did you save me?”

“Of course!” Zu An said confidently. “I’ve been pressing on you for so long that even my hands are… numb.” He suddenly realized that something wasn’t quite right. Such a rescue treatment didn’t seem to exist in this world.

Sure enough, Bi Linglong lowered her head and saw that his hands were still pressed against her chest. Her face instantly turned bright red. Her instincts as a young lady subconsciously made her swing her palm at his face, exclaiming, “Shameless!”

You have successfully trolled Bi Linglong for +55 +55 +55…

Zu An jumped backward, exclaiming, “Hey, you better not bite the hand that fed you. I was saving you earlier, okay? If I hadn’t continued those compressions, how could I remove all the water you drank? You would have been dead a long time ago.”

Bi Linglong sat up and crossed her arms tightly around her chest. “Couldn’t you have just hit my acupoints and infused your ki to release the water inside me? Why did you have to press my… chest?”

Zu An was stunned. Only now did he remember that back then, Chu Chuyan seemed to have done the same to help the drowning Snow. He couldn’t help but chuckle in embarrassment. “This is what people in my hometown do, and I already got used to it, haha… I forgot I could use ki to do the same thing.”

Bi Linglong was speechless. However, her eyes suddenly shifted to his lips. There was a bit of color stuck there, and it was a bit familiar. She subconsciously touched her lips, and then her palm smacked toward Zu An again. “You dare use this chance to take advantage of me?!”

Right now, she was actually feeling more disappointment than anger. She hadn’t expected this man to take advantage of her in that situation and do something so shameful.

Zu An dodged while exclaiming as if he had been wronged, “That was to save you! Your breathing almost stopped; my hometown calls this artificial respiration! We do this every time for those who have almost drowned!”

Bi Linglong ran after him while feeling embarrassed and angry. “Nonsense! There’s no such thing in Brightmoon City! How are drowning girls supposed to even continue living even if they’re saved?”

Zu An was starting to feel a headache. He really didn’t know how to explain himself. After all, everyone thought that Brightmoon City was his hometown, and he couldn’t say that he was a transmigrator, that his hometown was Earth, right?

Mi Li snickered in his head. “Serves you right!” She was sitting nearby, watching the situation with amusement. After all, Bi Linglong couldn’t see her as long as she didn’t want her to.

When she saw Zu An remain silent, Bi Linglong became more and more embarrassed. “See? You’re not saying anything because you’re guilty, right?”

You have successfully trolled Bi Linglong for +77 +77 +77…

Zu An was getting annoyed as well. It doesn’t matter how I explain myself here, right? He decided to just not dodge anymore. “Are you done yet? What part of your body haven’t I touched before anyway? Do I have to take advantage of you this way?”

Bi Linglong’s face turned beet red as she exclaimed, “You…!”

But she had to admit that there was some reason behind his words. Back then, the two of them had been tightly embracing each other without a single piece of clothing. He truly didn’t need to take advantage of her like this.

Furthermore, judging from their time together, she didn’t think he was that kind of person. She was only acting the way she did because she was still a young lady. Now, she gradually calmed down and slowly began to believe him.

After all, she wasn’t a normal girl. She calmed down after taking a deep breath, saying, “Sorry, my emotions were a bit worked up just now because of the situation. Thank you for saving me.”

Zu An was quite shocked. He hadn’t expected her to be so reasonable. He felt a newfound level of respect for her. He said, “I’m discovering that I’m starting to like you more and more.”

“Who wants you to like them, hmph!” Bi Linglong harrumphed and took a step back apprehensively. “You can’t say these things outside, or else you’ll really die.”

Zu An couldn’t help but laugh. “Are you worried about me? I can’t say this in front of others, and I can only say this when it’s just the two of us?”

Mi Li, who was watching from a distance, sneered. “Pah, playboy. Deceiving another innocent girl.” However, she knew that this was a crown princess who was knowledgeable and experienced. She wasn’t some naive and innocent girl.

“You can’t say it even when it’s just the two of us.” Bi Linglong was starting to panic. Her heart was pounding crazily. She liked to be in control, yet she was clearly losing it right now.

“But I think I heard them say that when you saw that I was in danger, you jumped in without any hesitation to save me?” Zu An looked at the beautiful and stunning woman with passionate eyes.
