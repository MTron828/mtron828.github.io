Chapter 688, Part 2: Lightning Descends Upon the Arrogant

Translator: Pika

King Qi’s heir finally revealed joy when he saw Zu An’s expression change. “Looks like you must’ve realized it as well. I didn’t want to cause that big of a scene in the capital before, but you forced my hand! I will let you witness the terror of an eighth ranked cultivator!”

He rushed straight up to Zu An as soon as he finished what he was saying. He moved extremely quickly, to the extent where not even Chu Youzhao or Murong Qinghe could react in time.

Zu An was shocked. The other party’s speed increased several fold compared to before! He already couldn’t evade in time, so he clenched his teeth and thrusted his sword at his opponent’s vitals. When two warriors clashed, the more courageous one will win. He refused to believe that a rich brat like this fella would be willing to fight while risking his own life.

“Peasants from the streets always fight with their lives like this.” King Qi’s heir sneered. “What a pity. Before absolute strength, everything else is meaningless!”

He easily blocked the Tai’e Sword while speaking. With his current speed, his opponent’s self sacrificing strike was laughable.

His fist swung out at the same time. White colored energy surged on his fist, the result of speed breaking past the sound barrier. It was like a sonic boom caused by fighter jets.

Zu An reached out his hand to block it, but he was too late. His opponent’s fist smashed into his chest.

Sounds of bones cracking erupted. Zu An’s body was flung through the air like a broken sack and crashed heavily into the ground.

“Brother-in-law!” Chu Youzhao turned pale with fright. She even saw blood gush out of Zu An’s mouth when he fell from the sky.

She ran out and blocked in front of Zu An. “Young heir, please be magnanimous.”

“Big brother Chu!” Murong Qinghe was shocked and quickly ran over as well. How terrifying was the strength of an eighth ranked cultivator? Any random blast wave would be fatal to them.

Even so, she still subconsciously ran over to Chu Youzhao’s side to protect her.

King Qi’s heir stopped a zhang in front of the two of them. He said with a frown. “Out of favor for the Qin clan and Murong clan, I can pretend that the two of you didn’t say anything just now. Step aside.”

Murong Qinghe quickly tugged on Chu Youzhao. “Exactly! Big brother Chu, this is your brother-in-law and the young heir’s battle! Furthermore, you can’t do anything even if you stay here. We need to step aside.”

The first reason was because he was worried about Chu Youzhao’s safety, the second was because the Murong clan backed King Qi’s faction. There was no way she would clash with King Qi’s heir, as she didn’t want to ruin their relationship.

As for Zu An, even though it was a pity, he had no one to blame but himself for being so arrogant.

As a martial idiot, she only acknowledged victory or defeat in fair battles like these.

“No!” Chu Youzhao screamed. Even though she was so scared her entire body was shaking, she still didn’t move at all.

She didn’t know if she was doing this because of her big sis or if it was because her brother-in-law saved her several times. She only knew that she couldn’t back down right now, or else she would definitely regret it for the rest of her life.

Zhao Zhi’s expression turned cold. “Young master Chu, you should do what you should before you are forced to!”

The Chu clan of Brightmoon City indeed had strength, but they refused their offers again and again. King Qi’s faction was already growing increasingly impatient with them.

The reason why he spoke kindly wasn’t because of the Chu clan, but rather out of favor for the Qin clan.

But if Chu Youzhao didn’t back down now, then the Qin clan’s two masters wouldn’t blame him even if something happened.

Chu Youzhao was shaking under the pressure of an eighth ranked cultivator. She thought to herself that it would be great if her big sis was here. She was still too young, and her cultivation wasn’t high. The man in front of her could crush her with a single finger, so she really was scared out of her mind.

However, she quickly realized that it wouldn’t make a difference even if her big sis was here. She wasn’t a match for an eighth ranked opponent!

Even though she was already this scared, she still stubbornly spread out her arms and refused to move at all.

“Big brother Chu!” Murong Qinghe began to panic. She even wondered if she should knock him out and bring her away. Even if he blamed her afterwards, at least he would be alive!

Suddenly, there was a voice that sounded behind the two of them. “Youzhao, is that really all the confidence you have in your brother-in-law?”

Chu Youzhao trembled. She turned around in disbelief. She saw that Zu An was standing behind her with a smile.

“Brother-in-law!” Chu Youzhao was shocked and happy. “You’re okay?”

Zu An nodded slightly. “Don’t worry. His punch only tickled a bit. It wasn’t a big deal.”

The proudly smiling Zhao Zhi’s eyes narrowed. “How can that be?!”

He was sure that his punch shattered his opponent’s sternum, so how can this guy stand back up again? Furthermore, didn’t his aura seem a bit thicker than before?

Zu An didn’t pay him any attention and only said to Chu Youzhao, “Youzhao, stand off to the side. I need to settle things with this young heir.”

He had to admit that this Chu clan little sister was a bit bratty before, but underneath the tough outer shell was an extremely soft inside. He didn’t feel like saving her was done in vain.

“Okay!” Chu Youzhao happily ran off to the side when she saw that he was fine. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Murong Qinghe was speechless. You didn’t move at all when I tried to convince you, but you’re doing it so happily with just a word from your brother-in-law?

When they left, Zu An gave the young heir a look. “It’s time for us to settle things.”

“Why do you look completely fine?” Zhao Zhi didn’t panic at all even when the other party stabbed him earlier. He felt like everything was still within his grasp then. However now, he really was starting to panic. The unknown would forever be the greatest source of fear.

Zu An chuckled. “You have no one but yourself to blame for being so superficial. Your punch only tickled.”

Zhao Zhi’s breathing stopped. His fist could bring down a city wall, yet this guy called it a tickle! “Hmph, I don’t know what kind of secret method you used to recover so quickly, but let’s see how many more of them you can take.”

He already rushed at Zu An as soon as he finished speaking. In his eyes, there was no way something so ridiculous wouldn’t have a cost. Zu An would fall sooner or later.

But for Zu An, the Primordial Origin Sutra’s powerful recoverative ability and the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra worked in synergy, one helping him take a beating, while the other increased his strength. Zu An wanted to try and use this chance to improve both the Primordial Origin Sutra and the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra.

But his little sister-in-law and the others were watching. It’ll really look quite bad if he was beaten up too badly.

Forget it, my reputation is the most important!

Zu An really couldn’t bring himself to look bad in front of everyone, so he decided to just end this quickly.

Zhao Zhi was shocked to discover that his opponent’s power and speed went up several fold, he was already on par with him! Together with his strange movement technique, he instead quickly fell into a disadvantage.

He was only at the initial stage of the eighth rank, while Zu An was already at the peak of the seventh rank. Furthermore, Zu An’s cultivation was different from others to begin with, so he was far stronger than others with the same cultivation level as himself.

That was why in terms of cultivation, King Qi’s heir was instead weaker.

But the young heir didn’t know this. The more he fought, the more nervous he became. When his body was covered in injuries, he finally felt scared. He roared out. He gave up on fighting against Zu An in close range and used his ultimate move.

“Holy Lightning of the Hegemon!”

His body slowly rose into the air. He spread his arms, and then his entire body was suffused with purple light. He became absolutely dazzling, as if he turned into a giant ball of lightning.

Thick streaks of lightning rushed out in all directions from him like chains, surrounding everything within a dozen zhang. Electricity hackled about within this zone. This place was turned into a sea of lightning.

Zhao Zhi’s voice sounded through gnashing teeth. “Keep dodging, keep running around! What does it matter no matter how crazy your movement technique is? This is a sea of lightning, there’s nowhere to hide! You will now pay the price of angering this young master!”

Chu Youzhao’s face turned completely white under the lightning’s illumination. Murong Qinghe already learned her lesson and grabbed her firmly.

The woman in the carriage could no longer remain calm. She urgently cried out, “Hurry and save him!”

The driver had a grim expression. He was about to get up, but suddenly stopped. “I might not have to interfere.”

...

Inside the sea of lightning, Zu An sighed and said, “Do you know what I hate the most in this life? Fucking lightning!”

He was struck by lightning when he first crossed over! He never wanted to experience that again.

“You hate it, but it is precisely my lightning that will punish you, and you cannot do anything about it? How does that feel?” King Qi’s heir finally vented a bit of his resentment. This kid’s words stabbed at him again and again. It was about time he made him pay the price for offending him. “I will give you one last chance. If you kneel down and kowtow a hundred times, then I might spare your life.”

It has already been so long since he was pressured to this point. Only by thoroughly humiliating him, would he be able to vent out his frustrations.

Zu An chuckled. “Then I’ll give you a chance as well. If you kneel down and kowtow a thousand times, then I'll spare your life as well.”

King Qi’s heir erupted with anger. “Since it is death you are seeking, I will grant you your desire!”

“God of thunder, aid me!”

His hands pointed towards the heavens. Thunderclouds rumbled in the skies above. Everyone here could sense the terrifying pressure.

Then, electricity cackled. A malevolent face already appeared within the lightning radiance.

Suddenly, a massive ball of lightning appeared at this time, hitting the young heir floating in midair.

In that instant, he was completely soaked. The lightning that was aiming at Zu An instantly changed directions and all concentrated towards him.

“Motherfucking...” King Qi’s heir only had time to curse a single word, and then he was cooked from the outside. Then, he dropped straight down from the sky.
