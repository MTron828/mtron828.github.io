Chapter 1495: Great Elf King

They were actually doing that kind of thing in the room?

The two women were shocked and furious. However, they couldn't act up in front of so many people. They could only glare at Zu An.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue +222 +222 +222…

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen +222 +222 +222…

Yan Xuehen felt even angrier because she had even said he wasn’t that kind of person in front of Yun Jianyue. And yet now, those words had immediately come back to bite her.

After Zu An emerged, he gathered everyone and shared what he and the Second Empress had just agreed on. Then, he said, “Let’s go and save the Great Elf King first. His prestige has always been high, so if he leaves, things will become much easier.”

Qiao Xueying’s eyes shone brightly. Ah Zu remembered my father all this time! He really is good to me.

Zu An walked up to Lei Xin and Wu Cheng. He said coldly, “I’ll give you two a chance. If you bow down to the Second Empress and the young prince now, I’ll make the two of you lords. Once the young prince ascends to the throne, you’ll be dragons among subjects.”

The two looked at each other in dismay. The young prince as the emperor? What kind of joke is this?!

He’s still so young! What right does he have to fight over the throne with the crown prince?

Seeing that the two remained silent, Zu An said straightforwardly, “If they aren’t willing, just kill them.”

“Sounds good!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed. She had been angry to begin with. She immediately took out her Crescent Ring.

When they sensed the thick killing intent in the air, Lei Xin and Wu Cheng were horrified. Why aren’t you acting like a normal person? Shouldn’t you have tried to move us first or rope us in?

Then, we would act all reluctant, and you’d give us even better conditions! How can you just skip immediately to killing?

When they felt the Crescent Ring draw closer and closer to their necks, the two of them didn’t dare to show any hesitation. They immediately got down on their knees and exclaimed, “We are willing to take on her highness and the young prince as our masters! We will obey your orders.”

They were helpless in the current situation. They planned to agree for now, then find a chance to run later.

Zu An continued, “Then let’s start with some self-expression. Hmm… There’s nothing else we need you to do right now, so just curse the crown prince in front of everyone. Curse that his son won’t have a butthole, that his daughters…”

The women’s faces heated up. This guy is really hateful! Just where did he learn all of these disgusting words from?

Lei Xin and Wu Cheng were stupefied. They wanted to refuse, but when they saw the trembling Crescent Ring, they still chose to obey.

“I, Lei Xin, hope that the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s son will be born without a butthole, that his daughters…”

“I, Wu Cheng, hope…”

The two shook in fear as they repeated those terrible words.

The Golden Crow Guards looked at them as if they were dead people. There was no way their cursing of the crown prince could be hidden. In the future, even if they said they were forced to by Zu An, the crown prince would still carry a grudge and make them pay. Lei Xin and Wu Cheng both clearly understood that as well. They thought to themselves, Now that we’ve fully offended the crown prince, we have no choice but to rely on the Second Prince now.

As for the little prince, he’s just a baby. How is he supposed to be a Fiend Emperor?

That was why they didn’t even consider it.

However, immediately afterward, Zu An said, “Right, repeat those curses against the Second Prince too. Same thing.”

Lei Xin and Wu Cheng were flabbergasted.

Are you not going to give us any chance to live?!

In the end, they could only repeat the curses out of helplessness. They could end up really suffering in the future by saying those things, but if they didn’t, they would die right there and then. It wasn’t that hard of a choice to make.

…

After wrapping things up, Zu An and the Second Empress headed toward the Imperial Prison.

Along the way, Zu An asked Lei Xin and Wu Cheng about the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s current plans. When he learned that the troops had been divided into four different groups, he couldn't help but give the crown prince some credit. He didn’t plan on letting a single brother go! Even if the Fiend Emperor hadn’t died, he might have just died from anger if he found out what happened.

The group strutted straight into the Imperial Prison. The prison guards immediately acted as if they were facing a great enemy, pointing weapons at them and asking what they were doing.

However, Zu An quickly pushed the Second Empress forward to let her take care of the situation. Sure enough, when they saw the Second Empress, the guards’ attitudes improved a bit. Because of the Second Empress’ beauty and unique charm, the soldiers all had good impressions of her.

The Second Empress said gently, “We came here to escort the Great Elf King out. I must trouble the hardworking men here to help us with this.”

When they heard her gentle plea, the soldiers immediately felt as if they were melting. However, they were still quite troubled, responding, “Your highness, his majesty issued the decree that unless he gave the order himself, the Great Elf King was not to leave this place.”

The Second Empress said, “It was the Fiend Emperor who sent me to release the Great Elf King.”

The soldiers were startled, asking, “Does your highness have an Imperial Edict?”

The Second Empress shook her head, but replied, “Could it be that you think this empress is lying to you? Who in this world would dare to forge an Imperial Edict? If something happened, it would not be something this empress could shoulder on my own.”

When they saw her getting angry, the guards didn’t dare to say anything else. They all moved out of the way.

Qiao Xueying couldn't hold herself back anymore. She was the first to rush forward. Zu An was worried that something might happen to her and followed behind her. The Second Empress wanted to get the Great Elf King on her side, so she naturally followed along as well.

After some hesitation, Yu Yanluo also went into the Imperial Prison. She had to go and meet the Great Elf King, whether because of his status as the Elf King or as Qiao Xueying’s father. Meanwhile, Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue stayed outside to prevent Lei Xin and the others from misbehaving.

The Great Elf King was locked up at the very bottom of the Imperial Prison. When Zu An saw him, he couldn't help but sigh. This guy is damned handsome, almost at my level!

He looks like the freaking elf prince from The Lord of the Rings! But of course, he looks much more mature.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

However, the Elf King had several thick stakes digging into his back, and he was surrounded by chains binding him to the walls.

“Dad!” Qiao Xueying called out, quickly rushing over.

The Great Elf King was moved when he saw her. He wanted to hug his daughter, but he couldn't move his body.

Qiao Xueying exclaimed tearfully, “The Fiend Emperor actually made you suffer so much!”

Zu An took out the Poisonous Prick and cut the chains. He was about to remove the stakes when the Second Empress stopped him.

“These are Dragon Imprisoning Nails that can restrain even a giant dragon’s powerful body. They have to be undone through a special method,” the Second Empress said while swiftly moving her hands in a special pattern, removing the stakes one by one. However, she was injured, making the process difficult. She soon found it hard to continue.

The Great Elf King suddenly said, “The Dragon Imprisoning Seal has already been undone. Your highness does not need to be troubled for the rest.”

Afterward, he began to transfer his ki. His robes quickly surged, and the remaining three nails popped out from his back one by one, shooting into the walls to the side. The long Dragon Imprisoning Nails stabbed deep into the hard walls. It was easy to see just how powerful their impact was!

Then, a powerful aura surged outward. Zu An sighed in amazement. As expected of one of the three elders of the Fiend Races! The Elf King’s power was at least at the grandmaster rank.

The Great Elf King bowed toward the Second Empress, saying, “I greet the Second Empress. Has his majesty allowed me to leave?”

The Second Empress shook her head. Qiao Xueying ran over, saying tearfully, “It would be strange if the Fiend Emperor let you go. He’s already dead.”

“The Fiend Emperor died?” the Great Elf King repeated, trembling. The explosive news was clearly hard for him to immediately take in.

Zu An said, “That’s right. The Fiend Emperor died in an Unknown Region inside the Imperial Tomb. I personally witnessed it.”

The Great Elf King looked at him in surprise, asking, “This little brother is?”

Previously, Zu An had easily cut the chains forged of cold steel surrounding him. He was definitely a capable individual.

Qiao Xueying blushed, saying, “Dad, he’s the Zu An I told you about before.”

“That was you?” the Great Elf King asked, an extremely strange and complicated expression suddenly appearing on his face. He looked at Zu An as if he were feeding his family’s pearls to swine.

“I greet the elder,” Zu An said, feeling a bit embarrassed. After all, he was taking the other man’s daughter, so he felt a bit of guilt.

The Second Empress said, “The two of you should slowly get to know each other later. Ah Zu, you should tell the Elf King about more pressing matters.”

The Great Elf King was surprised. Judging from the Second Empress’ tone, it seemed she favored him! Still, he just couldn't figure out how these two had gotten acquainted with each other no matter how he thought about it!
