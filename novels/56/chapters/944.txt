Chapter 907: I Am a Rough Man

Zu An said with a smile, “I’m investigating this case on his majesty’s orders. Of course, I believe King Qi as well… The people in this manor wouldn’t harm the concubine, but there’s no such guarantee for the ordinary people outside. You know how quickly gossip travels, so there might be rumors that King Qi killed his own concubine in just a few days, or that King Qi’s concubine had a lover behind his back, and that was why she was killed. If we can investigate the concubine’s corpse and confirm that she did die from an accident, this case will be enough to convince the masses. I’m considering things from the perspective of King Qi’s reputation and prestige here!”

Han Fengqiu was speechless. King Qi’s reputation among the people was excellent. He was always praised as a sage among kings. Why would anyone criticize him that way? If there were any vile rumors like this, they would probably be started deliberately by a brat like you!

He knew that Zu An was unpredictable. If he didn’t allow this investigation, Zu An might really start something like that. But how could he agree to something like examining her highness’ remains?

Both sides quickly began to argue again. Neither side was willing to back off in the slightest.

Just then, a voice asked in confusion, “What are you all arguing about over here?”

Zu An turned around, and his eyes lit up. He saw that there were several pairs of men and women nearby. Some were dressed in fancy clothing and had excellent features. But the most eye-catching was the beautiful man at the very front… It wasn’t that he swung that way, but that he was just too handsome.

His skin was like jade, his bearing graceful. Even though he appeared to already be middle-aged, it didn’t decrease his charm at all. On the contrary, it made him look more steadfast. Together with his luxurious, and yet not tacky outfit, he would become the spotlight of any group.

There was actually someone this handsome in the world? Zu An was incredibly shocked. This man is almost as handsome as me!

“I greet Princess Changshan, Sir Yu, Sir Lian, and Madam Lian!” Han Fengqiu greeted those people.

Zu An was surprised, but he had already guessed who those people were.

Princess Changshan was the emperor’s little sister. She had been married off to the Yu clan’s young master when she was young. Zu An gave her a look. Her appearance was only ordinary, but the noble aura she gave off added a few points. However, because her cheekbones were a bit too high, it made her look a bit too harsh and fierce. Together with the fact that she resembled the emperor a bit, it was really hard for Zu An to have any good impression of her.

The ridiculously handsome man was her husband, the Secretariat Assistant Director Yu Nan. The honest-looking man, on the other hand, was probably the Secretariat Director Lian Yu.

It really was quite strange when Zu An thought about it. Lian Yu was clearly the Secretariat Director, and Yu Nan was supposed to be his subordinate, and yet he allowed Yu Nan to walk in front when they moved together. Apart from Yu Nan’s temperament standing out, it probably had something to do with their family background too.

Yu Nan was the celebrated eldest son of the Great Zhou Dynasty’s Yu Clan. His father was the current Imperial Secretariat’s Left Confidential Assistant, Yu Xuanchong. The Yu clan even operated the largest ki stone business, making them incredibly rich. Together with the clan’s members occupying high positions, it made them one of the Zhou Dynasty’s greatest clans.

As for Lian Yu, even though his background was also distinguished, the Lian clan couldn't compare to the Yu clan at all. Furthermore, Lian Yu’s wife was Yu Nan’s younger sister, so he could be considered the Yu clan’s son-in-law. When he walked together with the eldest son of the Yu clan, Yu Nan, he couldn't help but pale in comparison.

Zu An gave the woman next to Lian Yu a look. So this must be his wife. She looks much more beautiful than Princess Changshan. As expected of a girl from the Yu clan. Yu Yanluo’s gorgeous appearance appeared in his mind. The Yu clan’s genes are truly amazing… The men are handsome and the women are pretty.

“Sir Han, what are you all arguing about?” Yu Nan took the initiative to ask him. Even though his tone was polite, he had a naturally arrogant bearing.

But Han Fengqiu didn’t feel that was excessive. Yu Nan’s status gave him the right to act arrogantly. As such, he told them about what happened.

“So you’re Zu An?” Yu Nan asked. The others also turned to look at Zu An when they heard his question. After all, Zu An had been quite the hot character for some time.

Zu An frowned when he heard the other man speak his name so casually, his tone full of arrogance. “And who are you?” he replied. Even though he could guess who they were, they had never met before. It wasn’t surprising for him to not know who Yu Nan was.

Yu Nan’s breathing stopped. He wanted to tell Zu An who he was, but he felt that would be too low for his status. He was momentarily at a loss for what to do.

Lian Yu grinned. He’d had to suffer quite a bit because of this brother-in-law of his, and seeing him like this now felt pretty good. Of course, he would only think that on the inside; he would never show it on the surface.

Fortunately, Han Fengqiu was tactful enough to quickly introduce them. Along the way, he even praised them quite a bit. Only then did Yu Nan’s expression ease a bit.

But Princess Changsan wasn’t too happy when she saw her husband suffer a loss. She remarked, “I heard that the Eastern Palace got quite an uncouth newcomer, that he was most glib in speech. I can see today that that reputation was fully deserved.”

Zu An said with a smile, “If I’m not mistaken, Princess Changsan is his majesty’s younger sister, no? You should be quite close to the Eastern Palace. Why is it that not only have you not helped the Eastern Palace, you’re instead criticizing the one who has been helping the Eastern Palace?”

Princess Changsan’s expression immediately changed. Those words really stabbed right at her. She couldn't just say that she was also King Qi’s younger sister, right? But there was no need for her to speak reasonably with Zu An. She exclaimed, “Brazen! You dare talk disrespectfully to me?!”

The guards under Zu An looked at each other in dismay. We messed up now… We ended up offending someone like Princess Changshan! Are our petty lives going to end here?

Zu An sneered inwardly. Looks like the imperial family and I really are destined to clash!

“As the princess states, I am indeed just a rough man. That’s true in every way.” He paused for a moment and said, “I’m acting under the emperor’s orders, and everything is going through proper procedures. I hope the princess doesn’t take offense, if there’s any way I’ve offended you.”

The guards looked at each other in dismay. They hadn’t expected Sir Zu to be so bullheaded. Was he going to just fight back directly? Just where does he get his confidence from? He clearly doesn’t have any clan power backing him. Is he really not scared?

They obviously had no idea that Zu An had already faced the emperor himself in the dungeon, and that he had chatted happily with the celebrated ancestors inside. This was just a trifling little sister of the emperor; why would he treat her as a big deal?

It would be one thing for him to just suck it up when he faced the emperor, since he couldn't win against him, but who did this little sister think she was? Either way, since she was closer to King Qi, the emperor wouldn’t side with her either.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You dare use my brother, the emperor’s name against me?!” Princess Changshan erupted into rage.

You have successfully trolled Zhao Xiao for +999 Rage points!

“What’s going on?” called a familiar voice in the distance. King Qi walked over with a group of escorts.

Han Fengqiu sighed in relief when he saw King Qi. He quickly ran over and whispered some details. King Qi quickly became aware of what had just happened.

“Second brother, this person…” Princess Changshan was cut off by King Qi before she could even finish.

“I came out to take a look when I saw that all of you still hadn’t arrived. I didn’t expect all of you to be here.” King Qi smiled toward Yu Nan and the others, then looked at Zu An. “Sir Zu, it’s been a while. Your cultivation has advanced greatly. Your talent is unmatched since ancient times.”

Princess Changshan and the others felt something heavy drop inside of them. Only now did they realize that Zu An’s cultivation seemed to have already reached the ninth rank at his young age. If nothing unexpected happened, someone like him would surely have endless prospects. Even an ordinary ninth ranked cultivator couldn't be rashly provoked, let alone someone like him.

Zu An chuckled ‘bashfully’ and replied, “My aptitude is just ordinary. I was even placed in the lowest class in Brightmoon City. It’s mainly because my luck has been good. Perhaps it’s a reward for being a good person.”

The others almost vomited blood when they heard him call himself a good person. This guy is utterly shameless!

But King Qi was thinking on a deeper level. His cultivation aptitude is ordinary, but his cultivation advanced so quickly. Looks like it’s because of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra. That technique really is as wondrous as the legends state!

His eyes began to burn with passion when he thought of that. “Sir Zu, you came at a perfect time. I’ve prepared some wine over here, so why don’t you join us?”
