Chapter 1527: A Test Lingering on the Brink of Death

Yun Jianyue was stunned. She hadn’t expected this guy to actually admit it just like that, so she didn’t even know how to behave anymore. When she saw his scorching gaze, she began to panic a bit inwardly. She slapped his hand away and said, “Stop causing trouble.”

She subconsciously tightened her clothes around her, then said, “Both the stone cold woman and I gained a lot of benefits from this trip to the Unknown Region. The two of us have been stuck at our current level for many, many years, but we witnessed beings of a higher level, and powers even higher than the earth immortal rank, such as true immortals. We even witnessed the trace of power that was revealed when the Celestial Emperor bestowed the Sun Slaying Bow upon you. These things wouldn’t be too useful for an ordinary person, but for us grandmasters who have been stuck at this level for so many years, they’re more precious than any treasure.

“I merely sealed up and preserved what I’ve seen and heard, and I need time to slowly digest and comprehend it all. I kept you company before because your affairs weren’t over yet. Now that you can already fend for yourself, I feel reassured. With your current strength, as well as the Fiend races’ Committee of Elders, the Elf race, and other supporters, there shouldn’t be anyone else who can harm you in the Fiend King Court. It’s time for me to return and tend to my own affairs.”

She felt a bit troubled as she spoke those words, adding, “That stone cold woman is really devious. She definitely went back to cultivate in seclusion. She didn’t even say a thing before she left! And now, I’m the one who has t-to…”

“Has to what?” Zu An asked curiously when he suddenly heard her stutter.

“Nothing,” Yun Jianyue said, her face heating up. She couldn't say she had ended up really treating Yan Xuehen as a sister of hers after their experiences together, right?

Pah, the two of us are famous enemies! We’ll decide who’s better through a fight to the death the next time we meet!

Hmph, that hypocritical stone cold woman took all of the Prime Souldew to use on herself. It’s a good thing everyone took their share of Feather Mountain’s spring water, or else she would have taken all of that for herself too.

“Is it possible for you to stay?” Zu An asked, feeling dejected. He had fought alongside Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue through so many difficult situations, and they had gone through so much, that they had unknowingly developed strong affection for each other, almost as if they were one family. Now, however, Yan Xuehen had already left. If Yun Jianyue also suddenly left, he would feel as if he had been abandoned by the entire world.

He didn’t know why he had such a strong negative feeling either. It was clearly just a temporary separation and not permanent, and he knew it was something that had to happen eventually.

When she heard his reluctant tone, Yun Jianyue’s normally fierce nature softened a bit. She said, “Little An, I’ve already been gone for a long time. Our Holy Sect isn’t as stable as the stone cold woman’s White Jade Sect. Those guys fight and scheme against each other day and night, always trying to harm others for personal benefit, trying to take their place. I wouldn’t be surprised if a heap of trouble in the Holy Sect built up while I was away. Those problems won’t go away unless I deal with them.”

At the same time, she was worried as to how her disciple Qiu Honglei was doing. Even though Honglei’s place of seclusion was safe, there was no way she could peacefully remain in seclusion if something major happened in the sect. Still, she didn’t speak of that reason, perhaps because she didn’t want to talk to Zu An about Honglei’s affairs.

When she saw him remain silent, Yun Jianyue sighed and said, “I really have to go. We’ll meet again someday.”

She turned around to leave. With her grandmaster cultivation, she could have disappeared in a flash, but for some reason, she decided to walk slowly. It was almost as if she didn’t realize that she didn't want to leave either.

A pair of strong arms hugged her from behind, and a voice called out, “Don’t go!”

Yun Jianyue immediately became angry. Her many years of instinct almost made her attack, but when she realized that it was Zu An, her movements stiffened. She bit her lip and asked in annoyance, “What are you doing?”

“I don’t want you to go!” Zu An replied in a rude and unreasonable tone. He didn’t know why either, but his thoughts were incredibly messy. He seemed to have become much braver than usual, too.

A hint of a conflicted expression flashed across Yun Jianyue’s face. She replied, “Kid, you’re getting more and more daring, aren’t you? You even dare to take advantage of me now? Let go already!”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“No!” Zu An exclaimed, looking completely unaffected. He smelled Yun Jianyue’s fragrance from just beyond his nose and thought, Big sis Yun isn’t the type to wear perfume. Why does she smell so good?

His actions were already bordering on disrespectful. No matter how much Yun Jianyue deceived herself with the idea that it was just a hug between an older sister and a younger brother, it had become inexcusable. She glowered, exclaiming, “I am Honglei’s master!”

Zu An moved closer to her ear and replied quietly, “I know, but so what?”

Ears were normally sensitive to begin with. Yun Jianyue immediately felt her entire body shiver when she felt the hot air he breathed out. She laughed out of sheer anger. Not even those from the Devil Sect would ignore things like status. She exclaimed, “Damn punk, are you the one from the Devil Sect or am I?!”

“I don’t know. I only know that I don’t want you to leave,” Zu An said, hugging her tightly. He felt as if his brain had become a complete mess, and his body was also really worked up.

“Let me go! If you keep going… Mm!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed in shame and anger. She was just about to act when her mouth was suddenly plugged up. Her eyes immediately widened, and an explosion went off in her mind!

I was forcefully kissed?

If there had been anyone around them, their eyes might have just popped out. Who was Yun Jianyue? She was the Devil Sect Master, an infamous demon! Untold numbers of people had died at her hands. Even though she excelled at charm skills, she had always remained pure in romantic affairs. Her temperament was intimidating and inviolable.

There had been no lack of daring and malicious individuals from the Devil Sect who figured that she probably had her needs too from being alone for so many years. As such, they had sought her out for dual cultivation, under the pretext that it would help them mutually improve their cultivation. Even when they were refused, however, they still hadn’t given up. Some of them had even entertained sinister thoughts of using some despicable drugs to take advantage of her.

And yet, all of them had died miserably. Some of them had ‘it’ forcefully pulled out by the roots, while others had red hot iron wires stabbed straight into ‘that area’… From then on, no one in the Devil Sect dared to have any such thoughts about her.

As for those outside the sect, there were rumors that someone had simply stared a little too long, but she had gouged out their eyeballs…

As such, even though everyone in the world knew she was ridiculously beautiful, she was a thorned rose to them, a vicious and merciless demon. No one had dared to try anything else because of that. They had learned a lesson from their predecessors and didn’t even dare to let their eyes roam around her body for fear that she would be in a bad mood and do something ferocious. And yet now, there was someone who dared to hug her, and moreover force a kiss on her?

Yun Jianyue was also a bit stunned. For countless years, she hadn’t even let any man within three inches of her, so nothing of this sort had ever happened. That was why she hadn’t immediately reacted. But after her initial shock, she quickly felt ashamed and furious!

Her natural instincts trained across countless years couldn't be changed. She sent her elbow straight at Zu An’s chest. A muffled sound followed. If it were anyone else, even if they weren’t seriously injured, a few bones would break. In contrast, she had no idea what Zu An’s body was made out of, but not even a single bone had broken.

Yun Jianyue felt the taste of blood surge within her mouth, realizing that Zu An was injured. She felt a bit of regret that she had attacked too fiercely. It would have been bad if she really hit a vital point. However, even though she thought it was enough to make him back off, he continued to kiss her as if he didn’t care about his life anymore. He even stuck his tongue in!

Yun Jianyue finally couldn't take it anymore. She pushed Zu An with all of her strength, no longer holding back. Still, Zu An wasn’t stupid either. No matter how tough his body was, he couldn't endure successive attacks from a grandmaster. He grabbed her arms.

Yun Jianyue struggled frantically. She discovered that her strength seemed to have been sucked away like a black hole. She couldn't muster any more.

When she recalled what Zu An told her before, she finally understood how Sir Fu had died. However, what was fortunate was that Zu An had only neutralized her force and hadn’t absorbed her cultivation.

“You damn punk, don’t force my hand!” she cursed. Even though her mouth was blocked, she could still send ki voice transmissions.

As an infamous great demon, she naturally wouldn’t be restrained so easily. She had more than ten ways to fully retaliate. If they were used, Zu An would be seriously injured even if he didn’t die.

Still, Zu An still didn’t respond. He only continued his offense. Yun Jianyue was embarrassed and irritated. She wanted to attack, but she was also worried about really hurting him. She was suddenly left in a dilemma.

Soon, she began to feel a bit strange. Even though she was a senior, she was as innocent as a young maiden. How could she stop the teasing of a veteran like Zu An?

When she felt his strong arms, especially when he didn’t even have clothes over his torso, her breathing also quickly became hurried from his masculine energy. A blush spread across her cold and dignified face for the first time. Her struggling arms also slowly lost their strength, no longer as resolute as before.

What am I doing right now?

Yun Jianyue’s brain felt as if it were turning to mush.

This is Honglei’s man! Wouldn’t I be laughed at to death by the stone cold woman in the future?!

When she thought of that, she finally recovered a hint of reason. She was about to push him away, but Zu An’s hand clenched. She groaned, and her entire body went limp.
