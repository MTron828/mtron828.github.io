Chapter 1554: Wasted Effort

“You came out of seclusion! Last time, I heard Yan… Ahem, I heard Sect Master Yan say that you were cultivating in seclusion, and that you were at an important breakthrough point in your cultivation, so I didn’t even dare to disturb you out of fear of affecting your cultivation.” 

Zu An wasn’t telling a lie. The two of them were newlyweds, and yet they had already been separated for so long.

When she felt the sincerity in his words, Chu Chuyan’s expression finally became a bit less cold. She said, “I was going to spend some more time in seclusion, but master suddenly came back to tell me that rather than cultivating alone in seclusion, it could be better for me to cultivate in the secular world for a while. That, and she told me to go and have a contest with the Devil Sect’s Saintess. That’s why I came out.”

Zu An was surprised and happy. He asked, “Yan… The sect master returned? Was she injured at all?”

He had suspected that she suddenly left without saying anything; even though he knew she was more than strong enough to protect herself, he had still been worried that something unexpected had happened to her. Now that he learned that Yan Xuehen had returned safely, he felt a huge burden disappear.

Chu Chuyan gave him a confused look, unsure as to why he was so concerned about her master. She replied, “Master’s cultivation is so high; how could anything have happened to her?”

“That’s good then, that’s good,” Zu An said, sighing in relief. Then, he realized that his question was a bit strange. He quickly added, “I fought alongside Sect Master Yan previously, so we can be considered friends now. She suddenly left the Fiend races’ territory back then, so I was worried that something could have happened to her.”

“Master mentioned that briefly to me before. But you say the two of you are friends?” Chu Chuyan asked with a strange expression. She understood her master’s nature better than anyone. Yan Xuehen was more like a frozen mountain than any other being in the world! She already lived in her own world of indifference. Chu Chuyan really couldn't imagine her being friends with Zu An.

Furthermore, if they’re friends, wouldn’t Zu An become my senior?

Zu An’s expression stiffened. He replied, “She didn’t tell you anything?”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Looks like Yan Xuehen still can’t face our relationship after all and is subconsciously running away.

Chu Chuyan shook her head and said, “She didn’t mention that your relationship was that great, but seeing as you were able to entrust a gift to me through her, your relationship probably isn’t bad.”

“Gift?” Zu An asked, stunned. How could he have possibly had the nerve to ask Yan Xuehen to bring a gift for another woman? That would just be scattering salt on the wound!

Chu Chuyan looked down at the red silk band. A hint of redness appeared on her face as she said, “I really like this Primal Skysilk. Thank you.”

Zu An finally realized what had happened. He chuckled and said, “It’s good that you like it.”

Inwardly, he sighed deeply. What is the meaning of this, Yan Xuehen? Are you trying to say goodbye forever?

“Right, there was something strange about master this time,” Chu Chuyan suddenly said. 

“What was strange?” Zu An asked, his heart skipping a beat.

“Sometimes, she just sat there by herself in a daze. A silly smile appeared on her face for a while, but it was replaced by anger the next moment. It made me worry that something was wrong with the Unshakable Daoist Manual’s cultivation, but she said that she was fine whenever I asked,” Chu Chuyan replied, furrowing her brows. Then, she looked at Zu An suspiciously and asked, “You’ve been with her for so long. Do you know the reason?”

Everyone had a bit of a gossipy side to them, and Chu Chuyan was no exception. She really wanted to know what her master had encountered, to the point that she wouldn’t be told about it.

Zu An looked a bit embarrassed. He naturally knew the reason, but he couldn't say it… He could only say, “It might be because she saw some immortals in the Unknown Region. That might have left her quite shocked.”

“Immortals?” Chu Youzhao asked, a curious look on her face as she hung from her big sister’s elbow. She quickly grabbed Zu An’s arm instead and cried, “My good brother-in-law, hurry and tell me about it!”

When she saw how Chu Youzhao was acting, Chu Chuyan frowned a bit. The Chu clan had needed to go through a huge ordeal to raise Chu Youzhao as a true heir. Why did she look like a little girl again?

Murong Qinghe’s ears perked up too. Zu An couldn't help but laugh. Either way, these were all people he was close to. Considering Murong Qinghe and Youzhao’s relationship, Qinghe was an insider too. As such, he gave them a rough summary of what had happened in the Unknown Region. Of course, he gave them a simplified version and didn’t go into too much detail. He could tell Chu Chuyan about such things, but knowing too much would only be bad for the two girls.

Still, it was already enough to leave the two girls astonished. Even Chu Chuyan was a bit stirred. For some reason, she felt as if her master had become a different person or something. Yan Xuehen had also begun to act a bit unfamiliar around her, to the point that Chu Chuyan felt as if her master was scared of being seen or something.

In fact, her master had only given her a very simple account of her experience in the Unknown Region. Chu Chuyan didn’t know that much. When she heard Zu An’s version now, her pretty eyes sparkled with amazement. Still, with her keen perception, she noticed that he was withholding some details. However, she didn’t suspect anything and just assumed it was because of the two girls off to the side. She could just ask him about those things in private later.

Suddenly, Zu An belatedly asked, “Right, you said that you were going to compete with the Devil Sect’s Saintess?”

Chu Chuyan nodded slightly and replied, “Indeed. Previously, Master and the Devil Sect Master agreed that their disciples were to have several competitions. However, the first meeting was originally going to take place a few years from now, but for some reason, master suddenly changed her mind. I’m not sure if the Devil Sect’s side will agree or not.” Her brows furrowed slightly. She just felt as if she had been a bit rushed this time, as if her master were chasing her out.

Zu An gave her a careful look. He sensed her ki aura and exclaimed in surprise, “You’ve already reached the ninth rank?”

Chu Chuyan responded in the affirmative, adding, “Master used a lot of effort to help me, and the White Jade Sect has favored me as well, offering me all sorts of cultivation resources. That’s why I was able to improve quickly. If I had emerged when we originally planned, there was a high chance I would have reached the master rank.”

That was something she couldn't understand. At this rate, she should have been able to break through into the master rank before leaving seclusion. At that time, she would have had more confidence against the Devil Sect’s Saintess.

Still, she had always admired and respected her master, knowing that she was experienced and knowledgeable. She believed the sect master definitely had something in mind, and she missed Zu An a lot. That was why she had agreed to leave the mountain.

“Big sis is so amazing!” Chu Youzhao exclaimed, her gaze full of adoration. She thought, As expected of my big sis, my idol!

Murong Qinghe was also shocked. Just how old was Chu Chuyan? Less than twenty, right? And yet she was already at the ninth rank! I am a genius too, but compared to Chu Chuyan, the difference is way too huge!

The Fiend races’ younger generation had individuals at a higher rank than her, but on average, they were practically on par with middle-aged uncles on the human side. Furthermore, the Fiend races attached more importance to bloodline power.

Chu Chuyan’s expression suddenly changed. She grabbed Zu An’s hand and examined him, asking, “What happened to you? Why are you even weaker than when we first met? Don’t tell me that your injuries ended up affecting your cultivation…”

This was a world that relied on cultivation. If Zu An had become an ordinary person, his days would be much more difficult. In that instant, she even thought she had to work harder to become stronger, because only then could she protect him.

“Don’t worry. I’m fine. It’s just that my cultivation method is a bit strange, so it’s hard for others to detect my ki aura,” Zu An said reassuringly. Then, with a light wave of his hand, he sliced a fluttering leaf nearby in half.

“That’s a relief then,” Chu Chuyan said, letting out the breath she had been holding. She suddenly thought of something and said with a strange expression, “I almost got distracted by you! Where did you spend the night yesterday?”

Zu An’s fine hairs stood on end. Even though Chu Chuyan knew about his relationship with Zheng Dan, telling the truth would only get him into deep trouble. Fortunately, he had already thought of an excuse. He replied, “I was investigating the Sang clan’s situation last night. Sang Hong went missing after an assassination attempt. I hold a share of the responsibility too…”

Chu Youzhao and Murong Qinghe had both heard people from their clans mention the affair. They both spoke up to console him, saying it wasn’t his fault.

A strange look flickered through Chu Chuyan’s eyes. She replied, “Sang Hong? I know where he is.”
