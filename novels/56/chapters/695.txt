Chapter 680: Meticulous and Careful

Translator: Pika

This was already Yun Jianyue’s second time saying something like this to Zu An. This kid was always testing her patience!

It really was strange though. Anyone else would’ve died many times over by now if they said something like that, yet she just couldn’t do anything to this guy.

Zu An immediately smiled in apology. “I was saying if, haha, just if. If big sis sect master has no such plans, then we obviously don’t need to talk about it.”

Yun Jianyue yawned. Her red lips looked especially soft and enchanting. “Is there anything else? If not, get lost!”

She had been tormented by this stupid episode of heat all night and was already extremely tired. Even though she didn’t mind chatting with a handsome and strong young man right now in her current state, her rationality still won out in the end. She really shouldn’t be with him in her current state.

“I have one last question!” Zu An quickly said, “Who is your inside man in the palace? You can tell me this now, right? That way, we can help each other. Otherwise, it’ll be really bad if we end up harming each other without knowing our identities.”

Yun Jianyue shook her head. “You will know when it is time.”

Zu An frowned. “You still don’t trust me?”

Yun Jianyue explained, “This isn’t a matter of trust, but rather that this person’s identity is special. I promised this person that I will not tell a third person, so I hope you can understand. As for what you are worried about, that won’t happen. That person won’t harm you and might even help you.”

“This person is that mysterious?” Zu An saw that she really didn’t plan to tell him. He could only sigh. “I hope things are as you say.”

He no longer let this bother him and instead said, “Then where is Honglei? I’m going to tell her goodbye.”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Wait a bit. I’ll let you two meet when the sun rises.”

Are you kidding me? It’s still dark outside. What if you cannot hold yourselves back because you’re about to separate?

Zu An: “……”

Who the hell are you being so wary against? Am I someone like that?

…

Zu An was quickly chased out of Yun Jianyue’s room. He could only return to his room and go back to sleep. However, his head was filled with Yun Jianyue’s seductive figure. There were several times where he almost couldn’t hold himself back, but he still managed somehow in the end. He had just enjoyed Honglei’s soft, little hands. He was even starting to look down on himself a bit.

After toiling an entire night, even though his thoughts were all over the place, he still gradually fell asleep.

The next morning, Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun both left their rooms at the same time by chance. Then, they exchanged a smile.

“How was last night?” A refreshed Jiao Sigun loosened his brows and quietly asked.

“It was a great battle of course. That girl continued to beg for forgiveness.” Piao Duandiao said while sticking out his chest. However, he secretly rubbed his lower back. I’m so sore… Isn’t this kind of bad?

“Really?” Jiao Sigun was suspicious.

Piao Duandiao coughed guiltily. The one who was begging for forgiveness last night was him. But how could he say that? He immediately changed the topic to escape his embarrassment. “What about you?”

Jiao Sigun replied with an ‘oh’. “I asked that girl how much they normally charge.”

“Oh?” Piao Duandiao was curious. He would never have a chance to be with a girl like this normally either. He wasn’t clear on the prices.

Jiao Sigun said, “That girl told me that it was twenty taels on the ground and a hundred taels in bed. Do you know which one I chose?”

“The bed?” Piao Duandiao asked. Zu An was paying anyway, so they might as well enjoy themselves, right?

Jiao Sigun shook his head. “The floor of course.”

Piao Duandiao: “???”

Jiao Sigun said as if it was to be expected, “Even though Sir Zu is the one paying, we should try to help him save money as much as possible, right? With the same amount of money, I could do it five times on the ground instead of once on the bed. Isn’t this more valuable?”

Piao Duandiao was completely stupefied. He was first shocked at how this man’s head worked, and then he was shocked at his endurance.

Five times… five times…

This number continued to ring in his head. He was just too jealous!

“Sirs, there is no need for you two to wait. Young master Zu is resting inside.” A maid quickly came to contact them.

“It’s already morning, why does he still need rest? Can it be that big bro Zu is the one with some trouble down there?” Piao Duandiao cried out in delight. He finally regained some confidence.

Jiao Sigun quickly corrected, “How many girls did he have with him last night? Forget about five times, he might’ve even done it fifteen times. Sir Zu really is amazing. I’m left with nothing but admiration.”

“Fifteen times…” Piao Duandiao’s smile immediately froze.

Jiao Sigun said “Sir Zu worked for an entire night, so he should sleep a bit longer. Let’s leave first and not disturb him.”

“Oh…” Piao Duandiao shuffled his feet numbly. He thought to himself that he really needed to get some proper rest so he could get some respect from the others next time.

…

When the two of them left, the government brothel became quiet again.

A while later, Yun Jianyue was roused awake from the knocking on the door. “Master, master!”

Yun Jianyue suddenly sat up. She subconsciously rubbed her legs. Her face was extremely red. Why did I dream about him? Ah!!! I shouldn’t have treated that scoundrel.

The knocking on the door became more and more urgent. It was now more like a pounding.

Yun Jianyue put on some clothes, covering her stunning figure. She then undid the seal on the door. “What is making you all nervous like that? You’re not acting like a saintess at all.”

Qiu Honglei walked inside unhappily. “Master, why are we leaving so urgently?”

“Something happened back at the sect, so we need to return as soon as possible.” Yun Jianyue replied with a cold voice. She thought to herself that she’ll explain it to her once they get back so that she didn’t make a scene here.

She twisted her waist unnaturally while talking. The clamminess down there wasn’t very comfortable.

Qiu Honglei’s expression changed when she heard that something happened back at the sect. She wasn’t the narrow-minded type, so she no longer refused to go back. “I only have one request. Let me meet with Ah Zu once before we go back.”

Yun Jianyue was really annoyed when she heard this for some reason. She harrumphed. “Being obsessed with a man will only hinder your cultivation.”

Qiu Honglei didn’t back down at all. “That’s only because master doesn’t know anything about love…”

But when she saw her master’s brows stand up, she changed her tone. “Ahem, master isn’t someone any man in this world is worthy of. This disciple hasn’t reached that level yet. Once I head back, I will focus on cultivation.”

Yun Jianyue’s brows finally eased. “Hmph. Have Leng Shuangyue accompany you so that you don’t disappoint our clan morals.”

Qiu Honglei’s face turned red. Everyone else calls us the Devil Sect! What kind of clan morals are there?

But she didn’t dare speak these thoughts and quickly left. When she reached the entrance, she suddenly turned around and gave Yun Jianyue a look. “Master, you’re okay, right?”

“What could have possibly happened to me?” Yun Jianyue harrumphed. She dragged the comforter over her legs in an awkward manner. I need to take a bath after this.

Qiu Honglei was puzzled. She felt like her master was a bit off today for some reason. Normally, she was aloof and cold like the moon. She gave a natural feeling of alienation. Yet today, she seemed full of worldliness, and even she, as another woman, was starting to become stirred…

She quickly shook her head. I’m definitely overthinking things. How can anything happen to someone like my master?

She quickly rushed over to Zu An’s room. Her maid Leng Shuangyue watched the two of them from the entrance. “The sect master has given me orders. I hope the saintess does not force me to do anything.”

“All of you are so annoying.” Qiu Honglei waved her hand and impatiently entered.

Meanwhile, in another extravagant guest room on the only road between the imperial palace and the government brothel.

A noble young master stood in front of a slightly open, second floor window sill. He gazed upon the street outside and said with a frown, “It has already been so long, why hasn’t Zu An come out yet? It’s already been a long time since those two eastern palace imperial guards left.”

His subordinate next to him replied, “We’ve already sent someone to investigate. It is rumored that Zu An ordered a dozen courtesan queens and is currently sleeping.”

“Hmph, that kid has some talent I guess.” The noble young master harrumphed. “Unfortunately, I fear that this might be the last time he gets to act so carefree.”
