Chapter 1732: You Shouldn’t Have Come

When they saw Xie Daoyun’s delicate figure shaking in the cold wind, the other beautiful women had strange expressions on their faces. 

This woman really is good at acting innocent! She’s still acting like this despite our current situation?

But if even such a weak person was willing to speak up for Zu An in this kind of situation, it just went to show just how great her courage was. After all, several grandmasters had been crushed by Zhao Han just like that. If he got angry at this point, just a single look would be enough to completely erase her from existence.

Just what kind of crazy superpower did this brat Zu An have to make her so dead set on him? She would even dare to protect him in such a situation?

This kid’s ability to pick up women really is on an entirely different level…ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +111 +111 +111…

Zu An felt his scalp become a bit numb when he saw the Rage points, but overall, he still felt more moved. He really hadn’t expected Xie Daoyun to take such a risk to plead for him. After all, as long as she was determined to be involved with him, she wouldn’t be able to escape the consequences. It could even end up affecting her clan.

“All of his hard work?” Zhao Han repeated. Even he was a bit surprised. This little lady looked pretty smart, but why does she seem a bit slow now?

“Was this kid really getting rid of hidden dangers, or was he the one planting trouble for me?” he wondered as he looked at the sacrificial altar that had already vanished without a trace. “He investigated for so long, and yet he couldn't even detect all of that gunpowder hidden here?”

Even though Xie Daoyun’s body was still shaking, her voice was quite a bit calmer than before as she continued, “Your majesty, when Sir Zu was investigating, Golden Peak’s stage hadn’t been built yet. Later, he was transferred away and always remained at his majesty’s side. This matter might not be his fault…”

Zhao Han almost laughed. He replied, “It’s not his fault? Then is it this emperor’s?

“That kid already had thoughts of disloyalty for a long time. He was even trying to gain some benefits out of this earlier. If this emperor continues to feign ignorance, how will I unite and lead the people in the future?!”

When she felt his awe-inspiring voice, Xie Daoyun’s face paled. She wanted to say something else, but Zu An stopped her, saying, “Little sister Ling’er, there is no need to continue.”

Little sister Ling’er?

The three other women immediately perked up their ears.

They even shared nicknames? They really are acting close!

Even though this wasn’t the time to act jealous, they still couldn't hold themselves back.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue, Qiu Honglei, and Yan Xuehen for +66 +66 +66…

Zu An had a helpless expression, but he still prepared for battle. Even though Zhao Han was powerful, just waiting to be captured without doing a thing wasn’t his style.

However, Zhao Han seemed to completely overlook him, and instead looked at Xie Daoyun. He had an appreciative expression as he asked, “Who is this young lady? This emperor seems to sense the academy’s aura.”

Xie Daoyun bowed slightly and revealed her identity to him.

“So it was Brightmoon City Lord Xie Yi’s daughter. As expected, valiant fathers do not bear useless daughters. Now, you have even become Yan Xiangu’s disciple; your future accomplishments will not be beneath those of your father,” Zhao Han said. The more he looked at her, the more he appreciated her. This girl was educated and well-balanced. She looked weak on the surface, but she had exceptional insight and bravery deep down.

After so many years, he had only sensed something similar from Bi Linglong. If the crown princess had not already been there, Xie Daoyun would be completely fit to wed the crown prince.

When he thought of Bi Linglong, he suddenly frowned. He looked at Zu An and asked, “Just what exactly happened in that secret dungeon the crown prince went into? What are you and the crown princess still hiding from me?”

Even though both Zu An and Bi Linglong had already explained things seamlessly, he didn’t actually believe them. After all, his yang spirit had been attached to the crown prince, so how could it possibly be destroyed so easily?

Judging from the emperor’s tone, it seems like the brat might even have a thing with the Crown Princess?!

Yun Jianyue, Yan Xuehen, and Qiu Honglei all looked at Zu An. They didn’t even feel any anger at this point, and instead felt a bit of respect. Just how many things were there that they didn’t know about?

When he heard Zhao Han mention that, Zu An knew clearly that the emperor had abandoned all thoughts of feigning civility. No doubt there would be a reckoning today. He secretly warned the three women to prepare for battle while pretending not to understand what the emperor was saying. He replied, “I have already explained everything that happened to your majesty. Why would you ask about that now?”

Zhao Han harrumphed. He was about to say something when he suddenly thought of something else. He turned around and looked at Xie Daoyun, asking, “Why did you come to Violet Mountain?”

Xie Daoyun was stunned at first, but she still explained her mission properly.

“Yan Xiangu sent you to examine Violet Mountain’s formations?” Zhao Han asked. His expression changed a bit when he heard the explanation, as if he had realized something.

Zu An suddenly realized something as well. He figured out many things that had previously left him puzzled. As such, he called out, “Since you’ve already been here for so long, why didn’t you show yourself and say hello?”

The women all looked at him in confusion. They didn’t understand who he was talking to. In contrast, Zhao Han appeared as if he were facing a great enemy. He looked in a certain direction with a grave expression.

A rift suddenly opened up in midair and a figure slowly walked out. This person had silver hair, but even though he was on the older side, it was clear that he had been incredibly handsome in his youth.

Most importantly, there was a sort of transcendent air to his presence, and yet he wasn’t as threatening as Zhao Han. However, no one dared to look down on him, because there was a mysterious and profound feeling emanating from him.

“The libationer?” Xie Daoyun exclaimed, stupefied. She had never expected to see such a person in this situation.

It wasn’t just her; even Yan Xuehen was a bit absent-minded. As the spokesperson of the White Jade Sect, she had also met the libationer several times. It could even be said that they shared a level of friendship. However, she hadn’t expected to see him here.

Yun Jianyue had a nervous expression. She said secretly through ki, “Ah Zu, the situation doesn’t look too good. You should take Honglei with you and get away, I’ll protect you two. We should try to save as many of our group as possible.”

She was usually a fearless person, so now that she had spoken such discouraging words, it meant she didn’t even have a shred of confidence.

If it were just Zhao Han alone, perhaps they would have a small chance by working together. But if the libationer joined in, even that last shred of hope would disappear. Even a single person getting away was something to be incredibly happy about.

Unlike Yan Xuehen, her Devil Sect background made her an enemy of the libationer. She naturally assumed he was her enemy.

Zu An said in consolation, “Things might not be as bad as you think.”

Yun Jianyue was stunned. Before she could grasp the meaning of Zu An’s response, however, the libationer looked at Zu An in confusion and said, “Not even his majesty was aware of my presence. Why were you able to see through it?”

Zu An smiled and replied, “I just made a blind guess. It might just be my usual good luck.”

It naturally wasn’t just a blind guess. Over the years, he had received all sorts of information, and yet he hadn’t been able to connect it all together even after all this time. Only when Xie Daoyun mentioned that Academy Master Yan had sent her and Zhao Han’s expression changed did he finally understand many things he had previously been clueless about.

Of course, his various hurried inferences weren’t enough. It was to the extent that he hadn’t even thought it through at all. But Zhao Han’s pressure was imminent, so he had just given it a shot. He hadn’t expected it to actually work!

Seeing that he wasn’t willing to talk about it, the libationer didn’t force the issue either. Instead, he looked at Zhao Han.

“You shouldn’t have come here!” Zhao Han said, his eyes narrowing. His expression was much more serious than when he had faced King Qi.

“And yet here I am,” the libationer said with a sigh. His expression was one of great sorrow, and yet it carried equally great resolve.
