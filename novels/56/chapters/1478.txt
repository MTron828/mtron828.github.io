Chapter 1427: Killer

Zu An and the others reacted quickly to dodge the incoming arrows. When they prepared to retaliate, however, they were shocked to discover that the arrows had actually curved in midair, circling around before going after them again.

“They even have heat-seeking properties?!” Zu An exclaimed, flabbergasted. However, he didn’t have time to admire the arrows, because he hadn’t expected them to be like that. The women had prepared to retaliate too, so they didn’t have any opportunity to dodge.

Zu An used Grandgale to move in front of the three women. He had no time to bring out any weapons, so he sent a fist flying toward an arrow.

However, the arrows weren’t tangible, and his fist didn’t hit anything. The incorporeal arrows pierced directly into his body, causing bursts of bloody mist to spew forth.

“Ah Zu!” the three women all cried out in alarm.

“It’s fine. I won’t die from something like this,” Zu An said with a pale smile. Fortunately, he had used the Heaven Devouring Sutra to neutralize quite a bit of the force at the last moment. Otherwise, if he had used his body alone to defend against them, no matter how tough he was, he would still have exploded under the four arrows.

As expected of someone the divine archer Yi had personally taught! These arrows were too powerful. He wondered just how powerful they would have been if Yi had fired them himself.

Seeing that there was no danger to Zu An’s life, Yun Jianyue’s gaze filled with killing intent. She quickly rushed toward Pang Meng.

Yan Xuehen’s expression grew cold, and she rushed over with the Flying Snow Sword as well.

Yu Yanluo took Zu An into her embrace, tears falling from her eyes. She quickly applied medicine on his wounds.

When he saw that Zu An hadn’t actually died from the arrows, a look of shock and regret appeared in Pang Meng’s eyes. However, he knew that in his injured state, he wouldn’t necessarily be a match for the two women. He could only toy with them slowly once he recovered completely. Thus, he turned into a streak of black energy and disappeared.

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen were both dejected. It turned out the Fengxi Boar’s demonic energy hadn’t been eliminated from Pang Meng’s body, or perhaps he had been the Fengxi Boar to begin with! More importantly, they had seen the speed at which the black energy disappeared. The two of them weren’t at their strongest, so they wouldn’t necessarily be able to catch up to him.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just then, Zu An laughed coldly and taunted Pang Meng using the Fragrant Barf skill. “You want to run?”

The black energy paused for a moment, condensing into Pang Meng again. He stared at Zu An with red eyes and yelled, “I’m going to kill you!”

This guy was clearly worse than him in every way, so why did he have three women who were so beautiful at his side?

Even someone like you?

The women only cared about that guy, just like his martial mother who only cared about Yi!

At that instant, the man and his former master began to combine in Pang Meng’s mind. His many years of hatred and grievance were multiplied many times over. He wanted to kill the three women’s lover right before their eyes and make them clearly understand who the strongest man was.

He raised his arms, and an intangible bow appeared in his hand. Even though it didn’t have a physical form, when he drew the bowstring that shouldn’t have existed, an arrow of light condensed on it. The arrow contained a terrifying aura.

Right at that moment, a streak of poignant moonlight flickered past Pang Meng, and he was shocked to discover that his hands seemed to have left his body. Yun Jianyue had used the Star Shattering Imprint on her Crescent Ring, increasing its power tremendously.

The intense pain coming from his severed arms made Pang Meng come to his senses. Did I go crazy? I actually ignored the two women who were attacking me, all because I wanted to kill that man?

He was about to withdraw when the Flying Snow Sword pierced through his forehead like a streak of flowing light. He was completely stunned. He mumbled to himself, “Martial mother…”

Afterward, his body came crashing to the ground, completely devoid of life.

As soon as the two women released a sigh of relief, a strand of faint black energy appeared from Pang Meng’s body and moved toward their group. It was clearly the Fengxi Boar’s demonic energy, trying to find a new host.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue’s expressions changed. If they were possessed by the demonic energy, that really would be a life worse than death. Unfortunately, they didn’t know any skills that could deal with the energy. One of them relied on killing intent, while the other used a profound sect’s techniques.

Just then, Zu An calmly intoned, “Dust to dust, earth to earth. What ought to have departed, do not remain here…”

The black energy seemed to have met something extremely terrifying. It released a miserable shriek before vanishing into thin air.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue both turned around to look at Zu An, looking a bit absent-minded. Because they were so powerful, they often ended up becoming shields for the people around them. They were always the ones who protected others. Now that they were the ones being protected, it really felt amazing. When they recalled how calm and steady Zu An had sounded just then, they felt a mysterious sense of safety.

The two of them realized they were in a daze. Their faces turned red from guilt. They quickly moved over to Zu An’s side and asked, “Are you okay?”

“I’m pretty thick-skinned. I won’t die,” Zu An said. He tried, to show them a confident smile, but he quickly grimaced in pain, tarnishing his image quite badly.

“Don’t do such reckless things in the future. I’m a powerful grandmaster. Did you think that I couldn’t take one of those arrows?” Yun Jianyue replied, looking unhappy.

Yan Xuehen’s face was as white as frost as she added “Right. With our cultivation, even though we are injured, we could still at least have taken an arrow each. You just needed to save little sister Yu.”

Zu An chuckled. These two had already been famous for many years, but after being around them for so long, he had discovered that they were sometimes like little girls. Of course, other people would likely never have the chance to see this side of them.

He replied, “There was something strange about those arrows. You should have seen that from how I miscalculated earlier. It’s better for me to get injured than for you beauties to have some bloody holes in your bodies, right? Either way, I recovered really quickly.”

“Even if you recover quickly, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t cherish your body,” Yu Yanluo said as she gently touched the area around his wounds, her voice trembling a bit.

Yun Jianyue gave Zu An a conflicted look, saying, “Brat, you really do use your very life to flirt with women. No wonder Honglei… Ahem, you can use this stuff to deal with little sister Yu and the stone cold woman, but it’s useless on me. Don’t do this again in the future.”

Yan Xuehen began to panic, exclaiming, “What does this have to do with me? Do not use that on me either.”

Yu Yanluo said with a frown, “Ah Zu is already this badly wounded. Are you two really going to argue now?”

Normally, with Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue’s status, who would dare to lecture them? For the first time, though, they didn’t get angry and felt a bit guilty instead. They thought to themselves, had they gone too far? It wasn’t that they weren’t grateful to Zu An, but rather that they couldn't express it too openly. Even so, they couldn't bring themselves to explain that out loud.

Sensing that the atmosphere was becoming a bit awkward, Zu An stepped forward to resolve things. He asked, “Right, did you guys hear a warning earlier?”

The three women were stunned. They all nodded, saying, “Yes. Just now, we did indeed hear a faint voice.”

Just who did the voice belong to? They looked around, but they didn’t see anyone. Cold wind rushed past them, and they couldn't help but feel a chill run down their backs.

Zu An suddenly thought of something. He turned around toward the large mulberry tree and called out, “It should be your respected self who warned us, right?”

“Who are you talking to?” The three women weren’t stupid and reacted quickly.

A light breeze blew past them. The leaves rustled with a noise that resembled a person’s voice, but it was extremely indistinct. “Indeed, it was this old one who warned you.”

The group was stunned. This large mulberry tree really had developed sentience?

As if seeing through their thoughts, the big mulberry tree sighed. “The laws of this world are a bit deficient, so that is why I have not been able to fully take form. I have only developed a consciousness.”

“Thank you, your respected self, for saving us,” Zu An said, continuing to speak politely. After all, this entire place was the mulberry tree’s domain. Offending it wasn’t a wise choice.

“It cannot be considered saving you; it was merely a reminder,” the large mulberry tree said, sounding deeply moved. “I simply did not want that Fengxi Boar to harm any more people.”

Zu An was startled, asking, “Was that the Fengxi Boar the entire time? Then was he also fooling us by claiming to be Yi’s disciple Pang Meng?”

“Those words were not spoken to deceive you either. He was indeed Yi’s disciple Pang Meng. However, the master and disciple had a poor relationship, and it is rumored that he plotted to cause Yi’s death,” the mulberry tree said, revealing an earth-shattering secret.
