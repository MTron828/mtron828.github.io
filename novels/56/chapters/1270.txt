Chapter 1219: Completely Blank

Yun Jianyue intended to use the Empress Lantern to freeze everyone inside, not even giving them the chance to hurt Yan Xuehen. As she barged into the room, she scanned the entire place with her sharp eyes. However, she didn’t see anyone.

Yan Xuehen’s heart was beating crazily, but she still did her best to remain calm. She protested, “I already told you it was fine, but you just won’t believe me! You just had to cause all of this trouble!”

Yun Jianyue frowned and said, “Something is weird about you.”

“What do you mean, something is weird about me?!” Yan Xuehen exclaimed, panicking. Isn’t this witch a bit too sharp?

“I don’t know either,” Yun Jianyue replied. However, she didn’t lower her guard and instead began to look around. Soon afterward, her eyes landed on the wardrobe. When she saw Yun Jianyue walk toward the wardrobe, Yan Xuehen thanked the heavens that she hadn’t told Zu An to hide there. Otherwise, they would immediately have been exposed.

However, she then remembered where Zu An was hiding. Her pretty face inadvertently turned red.

I really am going crazy! How could I let him hide in that place? If Yun Jianyue finds out, I’ll really be too embarrassed to continue living!

She hadn’t realized it at first, but she was actually already going for broke. At first, it had only been because she didn’t want Yun Jianyue to know her secret, but now, she was falling deeper and deeper into the pit she had dug for herself.

Zu An was also a bit stunned. He had just been about to say ‘we might as well explain this to Yun Jianyue and be done with it’. Either way, she was on the same side. Even if she wanted some kind of proof, there was nothing she could really do about it.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

And yet now, a second later, Yan Xuehen had pushed him right under her covers? As he breathed in the wonderful smell and felt the soft, warm body touching him, he felt as if he were dreaming. He subconsciously pinched his own thigh to check whether all of this was real.

“Ah…” Yan Xuehen cried out in alarm.

Yun Jianyue suddenly turned around, asking, “What’s wrong?”

“Nothing,” Yan Xuehen replied, her entire face red. “Are you done yet? Get out of here already.”

Yun Jianyue had an ambiguous smile as she asked, “Why do I feel as if you have a guilty conscience?”

“Do I have any reason to feel guilty toward you?” Yan Xuehen replied, pretending to be calm.

“That’s hard to say,” Yun Jianyue said while suddenly opening the wardrobe next to her.

Only then did Yan Xuehen have a chance to ask Zu An through ki, “Why did you pinch me?”

Zu An replied in embarrassment, “I thought I was dreaming, so I was just checking to make sure I wasn’t.”

“Then why the heck didn’t you pinch yourself?!” Yan Xuehen hissed, gritting her teeth in anger.

“Would you believe me if I told you that I pinched the wrong person…” Zu An replied weakly.

“Like hell I’d believe that!” Yan Xuehen snapped. She thought to herself, How can there be someone this shameless? I really must’ve gone mad to hide him under my own covers.

It’s definitely because of that damn skill!

Once Yun Jianyue leaves, I’ll immediately get rid of this stupid ‘Love Is More Solid than Gold’ skill. Then, I won’t have anything to do with this guy again!

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +233 +233 +233…

She could feel the boiling heat from Zu An’s body. Her heart was pounding like crazy, her entire body going taut.

What she was the most worried about at the moment was that Zu An would use the chance to take advantage of her. Even though she was still clothed, it was all sleepwear. If his hands moved even a little bit, he would easily reach her body.

According to all the information she had collected about him before, this Zu An was a total pervert. He had all sorts of different lovers at his side.

Her expression turned a bit cold. She thought to herself, If he dares to take advantage of me, I have to kill him even if the secret gets exposed! Then, I’ll end my own life. The dead don’t need to listen to rumors and slander.

But what surprised her was that he actually acted properly. Apart from that pinch, he didn’t do anything else. That wasn’t all; he even deliberately shifted a bit to the side, as if to avoid contact with her.

Am I really that terrible to be around?

Am I the same as an old grandma in his eyes…

Yan Xuehen felt truly awful when she thought that.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +377 +377 +377..

Zu An was completely baffled. Why the hell are you getting even angrier at me when I’m trying to be a gentleman?

Do you want me to touch you or something?

But of course, he kept that thought to himself. He didn’t dare take advantage of her like that.

Meanwhile, Yun Jianyue just finished checking the wardrobe. She exclaimed, “Huh? There’s no one here?”

Yan Xuehen quickly said, “I already told you so many times, but you just didn’t believe me and kept thinking about your weird conspiracy theory. Get out already! I want to sleep.”

Yun Jianyue scanned the room once more. The layout of the room was simple, and after a sweep, she indeed didn’t see anyone. She even scanned the place with her ki, but she still didn’t sense anything.

How could she possibly know that Zu An was hiding under the covers? That environment could be considered absolute darkness, so with Hidden in the Dark, of course she wouldn’t sense him.

“Was I really just overthinking things?” Yun Jianyue mused with a frown. She was just about to leave when her eyes suddenly flickered, and she turned toward the bed. Yan Xuehen’s figure was tall and slender; weren’t the covers swelling a bit too much?

Yan Xuehen felt her heart skip a beat when she saw Yun Jianyue look in her direction. She quickly pulled Zu An closer to herself.

It’s all this brat’s fault! Why don’t I ever see you act like such a gentleman normally? And yet you moved away so far that even Yun Jianyue noticed that something was off!

Zu An’s face was being squished a bit from how close he had been pulled. Just who’s taking advantage of whom here? Still, he was someone who had gone through his share of hardships.

Even though the pressure was extremely high, Yan Xuehen still remained calm on the surface. She asked, “What? Don’t tell me you think someone is hidden in these covers?”

Yun Jianyue’s breath caught in her throat. The two of them had faced each other for so many years. Even though she didn’t lie to her rival, she had to admit that this stone cold woman lived a pure life. She would feel uncomfortable even getting a little close to a man, so how could she possibly do something like that?

But the seed of doubt had already been planted within her, and it was sprouting. If she couldn't get to the bottom of this today, she might not be able to sleep well for a long time. Thus, she walked over with a smile and replied, “Who are we talking about here? You’re the immortal fairy who’s clear as ice and pure like jade. Of course there’s no way a man could be hidden in your covers. So many things have happened today, so I might indeed be a bit overly suspicious and can’t sleep. In that case, why don’t us sisters have a nice chat?”

Yan Xuehen was really about to collapse under the pressure now. She shot back, “Who’s your sister? Get away from me.”

“Come on, don’t be like that… We’re in an unfamiliar land right now, so I feel a bit strange sleeping alone. Why don’t we just sleep together?” Yun Jianyue suggested, moving to jump into Yan Xuehen’s covers.

Yan Xuehen cursed inwardly. You’re the freaking Devil Sect Master, who’s known to be fierce and ruthless, and furthermore a glorious grandmaster. Someone like you is scared of sleeping alone?!

Yun Jianyue clearly hadn’t let go of her misgivings yet and wanted to see just what was inside the covers. But Yan Xuehen couldn't think of anything else to stop her. When she thought about what would happen if Yun Jianyue found out Zu An was inside her covers, or about Chuyan’s shocked expression if she found out, as well as how she would become the laughingstock of the entire world, her head went completely blank. I’m finished!

Yun Jianyue became more and more suspicious when she sensed Yan Xuehen’s heart rate becoming faster and faster. She quickly grabbed a corner of the covers, then slowly started pulling it away.
