Chapter 1768: Reversal

Wang Youjun secretly ordered his companions to watch Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun.  The elders all nodded.

However, just as Wang Youjun was about to rush up the platform to seize those three talismans, the elders moved. They didn’t attack Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun, but rather also rushed toward the three talismans on the stage!

“Old Eighth, what are you all doing?!” Wang Youjun exclaimed in shock and fury. He had never expected these people to make such a choice!

The one he called Old Eighth chuckled and said, “These divine talismans should belong to the capable. If the clan master can go after them, why can’t we?”

Wang Youjun’s expression darkened and he asked, “Are you all planning to rebel?”

Another replied, “The clan master speaks too harshly. We are also from the Wang clan and all of us have done much for the clan. How is there anything wrong with our actions?”

Wang Youjun’s face was completely ashen as he said, “As the clan master, it is right and unalterable that these divine talismans go to me. If we each took one and many factions appeared, wouldn’t the Wang clan be left in complete chaos then?”

“What chaos? The reason our Wang clan was able to remain one of the world’s most powerful clans was none other than the mutual influence between the clan master and the elders. But in the clan master’s generation, everything changed once you obtained that special red radiance yellow talisman. If the clan master obtains the three divine talismans too, what are the rest of us supposed to do then? We might very well be thrown into the lightning just like the others earlier,” said another elder.

“Good, very good. It seems you’ve all been colluding on this for some time,” Wang Youjun said, feeling so angry he burst into laughter. “But do you really think you can seize any of these divine talismans from me with just your group?”

“If it were one on one, of course we would be no match. But if we four work together, why would we fear you?” one of the elders with a long beard immediately fired back. “Could it be that you are going to rely on that trash son who only knows how to fool around with women?”

Wang Neishi, who had been watching with a stupefied expression, immediately turned completely red. Just talk and argue among yourselves if you’re going to argue! What are you cursing me for?

Wang Youjun’s gaze turned cold. He was about to interfere when the Eighth Elder said, “Clan master, whether you obtain them or we obtain them, at least they will remain within the Wang clan. This can still be considered keeping the good things inside the family. It would only be an irredeemable loss if those two women got them instead.”

“That’s right. Why not work together to deal with them first before we struggle over who the three talismans belong to?” Wang Youjun replied with a nod.

Xie Daoyun was shocked. She quickly took a few steps back and became extremely vigilant.

However, Yun Jianyue told her secretly, “Don’t worry, nothing bad will happen.”

Xie Daoyun was stunned. She didn’t understand why Yun Jianyue was so confident. After all, they were at an absolute disadvantage.

Suddenly, the Eighth Elder shook his head and said, “Clan master, you’ve misunderstood. I am saying that you should stop those two women while we take those three talismans.”

Wang Youjun’s expression darkened. He shot back, “Are you trying to make a fool of me right now?”

“Of course not,” the Eighth Elder explained. “The clan master is the strongest. If we fight alongside you, there is no guarantee that you would not betray us. If that happened, we would have no way to resist. In contrast, even if we obtained the divine talismans, with our strength, we would only be closing the gap between us and you. You would not need to worry too much either. But if we let you obtain those divine talismans, we would just be waiting for death. So, we have no choice but to face you first.”

Xie Daoyun was stupefied. She couldn't help but feel more and more admiration for Yun Jianyue. Her understanding of human nature is far greater than anything I could possibly hope to have!

“Are you threatening me?” Wang Youjun asked, laughing out of sheer anger.

“This is no threat; we are just trying to use reason. In the end, the clan master will still be the clan master, and with several powerful helpers, the other great clans added together would never be a match for our Wang clan,” the Eighth Elder said.

“Old Eighth, I have to admit that you are quite good at coming up with nonsense. However, there is one matter you are all mistaken about,” Wang Youjun said with a sigh.

The Eighth Elder shivered and asked, “What do you mean?”

“You’ve overestimated yourselves, and you’ve underestimated me!” Wang Youjun cried. He rushed toward the weakest elder, the long-bearded one, like a streak of lightning.

The long-bearded elder was horrified. He frantically evaded to the side while bringing out all sorts of treasures without restraint to attack Wang Youjun. However, a completely white scroll suddenly appeared in Wang Youjun’s hand. That bearded elder was horrified, but it was already too late.

Whoosh!

When the elder’s hand touched the painting scroll, he vanished. Soon, he reappeared inside the scroll. The others could see him roaring furiously inside the scroll, trying to get out.

A brush appeared in Wang Youjun’s hand. With powerful strokes, he began drawing the character ‘death’ in midair.

A look of despair appeared in the bearded elder’s eyes when he saw that character. He struggled even more fiercely, but he knew that he would already be done for as soon as it was completed. Even though he was the one with the weakest cultivation among the four, the four of them were at the very peak of the entire Wang clan. In such a moment of crisis, the power he erupted with suddenly made the painting scroll crack. It seemed as if he would break out at any moment.

Suddenly, the other three elders quickly rushed over to provide aid. One slashed with a blade, sending endless waves of blade energy at Wang Youjun’s hand, while yelling, “Let him go!”

If Wang Youjun didn’t dodge and chose to finish the ‘death’ character, he would surely lose his hand. Unexpectedly, however, he didn’t stop at all and chose to complete it anyway.

The ‘death’ character really was magnificent, every stroke exuding great power. It was the finest calligraphy anyone present had ever seen. When it was finished, it surged with red light and flew toward the painting scroll, causing the scroll to fall silent. The bearded elder’s face was stuck in a horrified expression, but he couldn't move at all anymore. He had already died.

…

In the distance, Yun Jianyue watched, thinking this skill was a bit similar to Yu Yanluo’s. However, Wang Youjun’s was clearly more treacherous.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, at the same time, the blade waves reached Wang Youjun’s hand. With the sharpness of the blade energy, there would be no way of saving that hand. Additionally, once it struck his body, Wang Youjun would likely be seriously injured and lose fighting strength.

And yet, what happened next made the others’ eyes widen. When the blade energy landed on Wang Youjun’s hand, it all vanished without a trace, like a drop in an ocean. The next moment, it suddenly reappeared around the blade user and crashed down.

With a miserable scream, the blade user was sliced into mincemeat by his own terrifying technique.

The Eighth Elder and the other surviving elder both backed up uncontrollably. They all looked at Wang Youjun with horror. They had thought that with the four of them working together, they could defeat him, and yet he had defeated two of them in an instant! The situation was instantly reversed.

“You can reflect the attacks of another?” the Eighth Elder exclaimed, his expression darkening. This was completely outside of their expectations. They had never expected him to have hidden such a formidable ability!

Wang Youjun smiled and said, “Now, you understand just how terribly you’ve miscalculated, right?”

“I refuse to believe you can reflect anything!” the Eighth Elder roared in anger.

He suddenly took out a talisman, and a blue flame rushed toward Wang Youjun. Simultaneously, the other elder also made a move, unleashing a storm to support him. Spurred by the power of wind, the flames quickly engulfed the entire space.

Yun Jianyue’s expression became serious. She had planned to just watch from the side and reap the benefits, but the situation had changed way faster than she expected. Thus, she didn’t hesitate anymore. She picked up Xie Daoyun and rushed at the stage, planning to seize the divine talismans first.

Just then, the endless storm of flames covered Wang Youjun. Eighth Elder sighed in relief. Wang Youjun was skilled in the way of art, so his flames would naturally counter that. Together with the assistance of Old Tenth’s wind, it would be enough to burn Wang Youjun to ashes. His reflection power wouldn’t be able to reflect an intangible elemental force… right?

The firestorm swept over Wang Youjun, not leaving a single trace where he had been standing.

“Was he burned into nothing? But it doesn’t make sense for Wang Youjun to not have had any strength to fight back…” the Eighth Elder muttered, shivering.

Suddenly, the air around him became scorching hot. When he looked down, he was horrified to see blue flames surging all around him! His eyes widened, but in an instant, he was burned to a crisp, leaving behind only a skeleton. Meanwhile, the Tenth Elder wasn’t much better off. He screamed miserably as he was ripped apart by a vicious tornado.

Wang Youjun instantly appeared in front of Yun Jianyue. The moment she saw him, Yun Jianyue activated her blood sea domain, however, dyeing the entire area dark red.

Wang Youjun shivered. What is this woman’s background? How is she able to gather such terrifying killing intent?

Yun Jianyue sneered and said, “That strange reflection ability won’t work against me in my domain.” At the same time, her other hand lightly tapped Xie Daoyun’s body, gently launching her onto the stage so she was only a step away from the three divine talismans.

Xie Daoyun’s hands were about to touch the three talismans when a voice said with a cold snort, “Exchange Shift Talisman!”

A yellow talisman burned in Wang Youjun’s hands. In the same instant, Xie Daoyun grabbed the air, but when she raised her head with surprise, she saw that she was no longer on the stage, but instead where Wang Neishi had been. Meanwhile, Wang Neishi had swapped positions with her and was now standing on the stage. He grabbed one of the talismans.
