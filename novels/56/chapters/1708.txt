Chapter 1657: A Condition

After discussing some details of the plan with the Silver Token Envoys, Zu An then left quickly. However, he didn’t return directly to Violet Mountain, instead paying the governor manor a visit. He had to admit that the manor’s security was a bit tighter than that of other governor manors. He wondered if that was because of King Yan’s influence.

Of course, the guards were still far inferior to those of King Yan Manor. Between that and the fact that Zu An was already a long-time expert in such infiltrations, he quickly arrived outside Governor Zhang’s room.

“Who is it?!” Zhang Jie called out. He was the governor of the commandery, after all. Furthermore, Zu An had deliberately avoided hiding his presence, so Zhang Jie instantly leaped out of bed and looked at the window in alarm.

Zu An saw the pretty woman at Zhang Jie’s side and thought to himself, This fella really knows how to play, huh?

Then again, which authority figure in this world didn’t have a few concubines in their harem? As such, he didn’t really pay it any mind and replied seriously, “Golden Token Eleven!”

Zhang Jie was shocked and quickly got up, saying, “Please wait just a moment, Sir Eleven.”

The concubine was a bit annoyed that she had been woken up in the night, but she didn’t dare to say a thing when Zhang Jie shot her a look.

Zu An didn’t go inside, and instead admired the moon outside the courtyard. Fortunately, Zhang Jie didn’t have him wait for too long; he quickly draped a coat over himself and came out, asking carefully,

“May I ask what honorable intent Sir Eleven has for visiting us so late at night?”

Zu An didn’t give a direct reply, instead asking, “How does Sir Zhang really feel about King Yan?”

After some hesitation, Zhang Jie replied, “King Yan is devoted to the empire and guards these lands in the court’s place…”

Zu An sneered when he heard those half-hearted, cliched words. He said, “But according to my investigation, it seems that you and King Yan haven’t gotten along with each other for quite some time. Doesn’t that imply you aren’t loyal to the court, and that you’re even dragging down King Yan, who is fully devoted?”

Zhang Jie became a bit alarmed. He replied, “This humble official is left in fear! In truth, King Yan is arrogant and despotic, overstepping his authority all over this region. This humble official is loyal to his majesty and cannot tolerate that, which is why we have engaged in many conflicts.”

Even though his official rank was higher than Zu An’s, Golden Token Envoys often represented his majesty’s own intentions. As such, there was no way he wouldn’t be scared, making him refer to himself as a humble official.

“What kind of overstepping? Why don’t you tell me a bit about that?” Zu An asked, sounding unconvinced.

Zhang Jie was a bit hesitant as he asked, “Sir Eleven, could it be that his majesty also plans to censure King Yan?”

“Don’t ask things you shouldn’t be asking,” Zu An said bluntly. The Embroidered Envoy had a special status, so explaining the situation was sometimes inappropriate.

Sure enough, Zhang Jie wasn’t surprised. He respectfully told Zu An about the things King Yan had done over the years to abuse his authority.

“Do you have any proof?” Zu An asked.

Zhang Jie shook his head and said, “There are some witnesses, but that isn’t enough to convict King Yan of any crimes. On the contrary, it would only worsen the relationship with King Yan Manor and make future work more difficult.”

Zu An had an ambiguous smile as he said, “It looks like Governor Zhang really wants King Yan to be convicted of a great crime.”

“This humble official doesn’t dare!” Zhang Jie exclaimed, wiping away cold sweat from his forehead in alarm.

“Find a reason to meet with King Yan tomorrow. The farther away it is from the king manor, the better,” Zu An said, finally expressing his true intentions after having sounded out Zhang Jie for a while.

Zhang Jie was alarmed. An old fox like him could naturally guess what was happening, though. Didn’t that mean Sir Eleven was going to enter King Yan Manor? Still, after his earlier lesson, he didn’t dare to ask any further. He could only say with a miserable expression, “Sir Eleven, this humble official doesn’t have a good relationship with King Yan. I might not be able to bring him away…”

Zu An said indifferently, “You’re the leader of a commandery and haven’t backed down against King Yan after all these years. Don’t tell me you don’t have any methods.”

Zhang Jie took out his handkerchief and wiped the sweat from his temples again. He said, “This humble official will think of a way; I will do my best…”

Zu An knew that if an old fox was saying such things, that meant they had already agreed. He nodded and disappeared into the night.

As he watched Zu An leave, Zhang Jie muttered to himself, “Golden Token Envoys really are profound and mysterious. This Sir Eleven is even more so…”

…

After leaving the governor manor, Zu An hurried to Violet Mountain. He had too many things he had to deal with today. Even with the Wind Fire Wheels, it was already late into the night by the time he returned.

He didn’t go back to his own residence; after some hesitation, he went to Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan’s place. However, he couldn't just announce himself at the front entrance with how late it was, or else it would only create more rumors. As such, he snuck in instead.

As soon as he opened the window, an ice-cold sword appeared in front of his throat. A cold voice said, “How brazen!”

Zu An instinctively moved backward. The other person was surprised by his quick reaction and thrust the sword forward.

Zu An dodged backward while quietly stating his identity, saying, “Big sis Yan, it’s me!”

The longsword froze briefly when Yan Xuehen heard his voice. She exclaimed, “It’s you?” Then, she snapped coldly, “Shameless!”

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +777 +777 +777…

Yan Xuehen had felt very restless after the tournament. As such, she had started to meditate. However, just now, she had sensed someone’s presence. She had thought that it was some daring scoundrel from the nine sects who was up to no good, but it was actually Zu An.

This guy had come for Chuyan so furtively in the middle of the night, and furthermore, he had even arrived when most people were supposed to be asleep! It went without saying what kind of motives he had.

“You misunderstood! I didn’t come for Chu Chuyan, but for you!” Zu An said as he looked at Yan Xuehen. As the moonlight scattered across her white clothes, it seemed to surround her in a hazy veil. He had to admit that his big sis Yan was really pretty even when she was angry.

Yan Xuehen was stunned when she heard that he had come for her. She was immediately filled with embarrassment, snapping, “Why would you look for me in the middle of the night? Get lost!” She turned around and tried to walk back in afterward.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +77 +77 +77…

When he saw how she was trying to create some distance between them, Zu An panicked and quickly grabbed her, saying, “I have something to say to you.”

“There’s nothing to say between us,” Yan Xuehen snapped. She flung his hand away and coldly said, “I believe I already explained it clearly to you before.”

“I really do have something important to say this time!” Zu An replied, briefly at a loss for what to say.

For some reason, both of them had tacitly agreed to speak very softly, as if they were scared that someone else would hear them.

Yan Xuehen gave the surroundings a look. After some hesitation, she said, “We’ll talk outside.” Afterward, she walked outside.

Zu An felt happy and followed her. They quickly arrived at a bamboo forest outside the courtyard, where Yan Xuehen stopped and said, “Speak. What is it that you need to find me in the middle of the night for?”

Zu An had a strange expression as he replied, “You weren’t thinking that I came here to assault you in the middle of the night, right?”

A trace of redness flashed across Yan Xuehen’s face as she said, “If you have something to say, then say it. Otherwise, I’m leaving.”

Zu An quickly said, “Actually, I wanted to ask for your help.” Then, he told her that he needed an expert in formations to help him with King Yan Manor’s study.

Compared to Xie Daoyun, Yan Xuehen was a more qualified candidate. After all, they had already worked together several times and couldn't be more familiar with each other. Furthermore, both she and Yun Jianyue knew about his Embroidered Envoy identity.

“You’re going to go against King Yan?” Yan Xuehen asked with a frown.

“It’s not that I’m out to take him down, but Golden Token Seven died and I need to investigate something,” Zu An said seriously. “Back then, Golden Token Seven helped me once. Even though we weren’t friends, I can’t just stand by and do nothing now that he’s died mysteriously.”

Yan Xuehen remained silent for a moment before saying, “King Yan’s status is special. Even with my identity as the White Jade Sect Master, just a bit of carelessness would result in tremendous danger.”

When he heard how apathetic her tone was and how she seemed to be refusing him the same way she would refuse anyone else, Zu An couldn't help but feel downcast. He said, “In that case, I won’t force you either. I’ll try to think of another way.” He turned around to leave afterward.

Yan Xuehen said calmly, “King Yan Manor study’s formations are definitely troublesome. Where would you be able to find another way in such a short time?”

“Sect Master Yan doesn’t need to trouble yourself over that,” Zu An said. He waved his hand and didn’t even stop.

When she felt the lack of emotion in his tone, Yan Xuehen trembled. She bit her lip and had a troubled expression. In the end, as she saw him recede into the distance, she couldn't help but say, “It’s not as if I said I wouldn’t help!”

This damn kid didn’t even speak any more flattery when asking me for a favor, and now he’s already leaving!

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +222 +222 +222…

Zu An was stunned. He turned around in disbelief and asked, “You’re really willing to help me?”

Besides, if she was agreeing to help, why did she seem a bit angrier than before?

Yan Xuehen harrumphed. “I can help you, but I have a condition.”

“Forget about one condition, I’ll agree to even ten conditions. I can even devote my whole body to you!” Zu An replied. He was overjoyed by the turn of events and ran back.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Keep dreaming.” Yan Xuehen harrumphed. She felt her heart beating a bit faster than normal for some reason. She asked, “How did you make Pei Mianman draw a bye today at Golden Peak?”

Zu An was stunned, replying, “That’s it?”

“Is that not enough?” Yan Xuehen asked, furrowing her brows slightly when she recalled that scene. It had been bothering her all day, but she hadn’t been able to bring herself to ask.

Meanwhile, in a distant tree’s shadow, Wang Wuxie had an expression of utter shock. He muttered to himself, “Why are the two of them together?!”
