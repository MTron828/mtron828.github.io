Chapter 261: Assassination

Translator: Pika

Zu An swallowed. He had a bit of history with this Wailing Whip himself. As for how it felt... he really didn’t want to bring back those memories.

Who could blame Cheng Shouping for screaming so miserably?

Chu Huanzhao had gotten more and more frustrated as time went on, and had come back for an explanation from Zu An. Who knew she would end up hearing Cheng Shouping say these things as soon as she returned? She was already fuming to begin with—this was simply pouring fuel on the fire!

One lash wasn’t enough to make her feel better. A second strike followed.

Seeing that she was about to strike out a third time, Zu An immediately rushed in to stop her. “Okay, okay! This pitiful kid is going to die at this rate.”

Chu Huanzhao became more annoyed the more she looked at him. She raised her whip, about to strike him again.

In the end, she decided against it. She huffed angrily before turning around. “I don’t want to talk to you!”

Zu An chuckled at her tantrum. Wasn’t this lass getting more and more adorable?

Didn’t I say this before? Good genes and a pretty face are all that are important in the end. Even if she throws a bit of a tantrum, no one will find it that annoying.

He then turned around to give Cheng Shouping a look. “Honestly, you’re going to get done in by that mouth of yours sooner or later. Be more careful in the future, and don’t blabber about everything all the time.”

“Ow...” Cheng Shouping had a resentful look on his face. What the heck is this? The one who went to the Immortal Abode was young master, and the one who got to enjoy himself was also young master! Why am I the one getting beaten just for casually bringing this up?!

Hmph! I thought highly of the second miss and young master all this time, but it’s been all for nothing! I’m only going to support the first miss from now on!

Seeing his hurt and indignant expression, Zu An tossed him a silver tael. “Get some medicine for yourself and rest up. Don’t go with me to the academy today, lest lil’ Huanzhao gets angry at you again.”

The silver immediately made Cheng Shouping’s eyes light up. He said with a beaming smile, “Thank you so much, young master! Young master really is the best!”

Someone as straightforward and generous like the young master deserves to have a different girl by his side every night! Of course, he didn’t dare say this out loud, out of fear that he’d get whipped again.

Zu An couldn’t stand his fawning look anymore. He turned to run after Chu Huangzhao.

Usually, she always waited for Zu An before heading to the academy together. Yet today, she had mounted a horse and ridden off immediately.

Only after great effort did Zu An finally catch up. “Aiyo, who was it that made our lil’ Huanzhao so angry?”

Chu Huanzhao’s expression was still furious, and she refused to say anything.

Zu An nudged his horse over. “Are you still upset that I didn’t get you a gift? I’ll buy you whatever you want right now! Big bro has money~”

Chu Huanzhao couldn’t stand his pestering. “You know that’s not why I’m upset!”

“Then why are you upset?” Zu An asked with a smile.

Chu Huanzhao’s turned her head away. “You already know the answer.”

Zu An’s put on a pensive expression. “Was it because of what happened in the Immortal Abode?”

Chu Huanzhao huffed angrily. Her small, snow-white face became a bit colder.

“I really was dragged there by those second and third branch fellows! They wanted to find out about your older sister’s condition, so I had to deceive them and say that it wasn’t a big deal! But they aren’t stupid, so how would they trust me that easily?

“They wanted to bring me along with them to the Immortal Abode as a test. If there really had been something wrong with your older sister, then I wouldn’t have had the heart to go and play around.

“I had to beat them at their own game. This was really a huge sacrifice for me! In order to make them think that Chuyan was fine, I had to brace myself and go to that sort of place!”

Zu An said all of this with a deadly earnest expression. He was even slightly amazed at his own ability to bullshit his way through.

As for Chu Yucheng and Chu Hongcai... the two of you can just carry all the blame for me! It was your fault for calling me out anyway.

“Are you telling me the truth?” Chu Huanzhao’s expression finally eased a little.

“Of course! You know that I’ve always been an upstanding person, so how could I let myself willingly enter such an establishment if I had a choice?!” Zu An said in a righteous manner. He stuck out his chest as he spoke, making himself look even more tall and upright.

“But... but I heard that the Immortal Abode’s courtesan queen chose you... chose you to... enter her chambers alone,” said Chu Huanzhao angrily. Why do all of these wretches keep going after my brother-in-law day and night?

Zu An said with a chuckle, “You’re worrying too much. The two of us only chatted over some tea. We ended up running into Blackwind Stockade’s Chen Xuan before our conversation even got that far.”

“Chen Xuan!” Chu Huanzhao gave a frightened start. Even someone like her who paid little attention to the clan’s matters knew about this great bandit. Chen Xuan plundered the trade routes around Brightmoon City, and had given the Chu clan much grief over the years.

“Brother-in-law, nothing happened to you, right?” Even though he looked perfectly fine, Chu Huanzhao still tugged on his arm in worry, trying to check for injuries.

A warm feeling surged within Zu An when he saw her sincere concern. Even though this brat was a little crafty and unruly, she really did treat him well.

When he’d landed in this world filled with dangers, she’d been the only one who had made him feel some warmth. “Don’t worry, I’m fine. A mere ant like Chen Xuan can’t do anything to me.”

You have successfully trolled Chen Xuan for 431 Rage points!

Zu An was stunned by the sudden influx of Rage points. What kind of situation was this? Why did he end up receiving his Rage points?

Don't tell me...

Just in time, he noticed a streak of black approaching. All of Zu An's hairs immediately stood on end. He grabbed Huanzhao and leaped off of their horses.

Almost at that same instant, an arrow landed where he had just been. The poor horse he’d been on just a moment ago exploded under the powerful impact.

Chunks of flesh splattered everywhere. Chu Huanzhao's horse was absolutely horrified, rearing up on its hind legs before bolting for the hills.

If Zu An hadn’t grabbed her earlier, the consequences would have been too horrible to imagine.

"What happened?" Chu Huanzhao was so scared that her face had gone deathly pale. She was usually extremely bold, but she had never seen flesh flying everywhere like this before! She held onto Zu An's sleeves tightly, her body shaking uncontrollably.

The surrounding Chu clan guards snapped out of their shock. All of them hurriedly drew their weapons, protectively encircling the two of them as they began to scan the surrounding area vigilantly.

The people around them were in even greater panic. With all of them screaming and running around hysterically, how were they supposed to find out where the assassin was hiding?

Zu An seemed to have picked up on something. He turned his head in a certain direction. A red-haired man was standing behind a pillar on the third floor, a large bow in hand. When Chen Xuan realized that he had been discovered, he smiled cruelly. He raised a hand and drew his thumb across his throat before disappearing without a trace.

Zu An frowned. This guys was actually a master at assassination! He immediately fled the scene after a failed attempt.

Zu An would have preferred to fight the other party right here. If he could hold him here, the problem would have been dealt with once the City Defense Army or more Chu clan guards arrived.

What a pity!

No wonder this fellow was still alive and well despite being constantly pursued by both the Chu clan’s and the City Lord’s forces.

Zu An’s expression grew grim, knowing that he now had to be constantly on guard against a powerful assassin. This fellow could fail all he wanted, but his life would be forfeit if he messed up even once.

“Second miss, young master! We weren’t able to find the assassin!” A skinny Chu clan guard reported after searching the surrounding area.

This guard’s name was Jiao Shanhe. Although he looked a little like a monkey, he was the most outstanding scout in Chu clan’s private army, and was known to be extremely sharp and astute. After Snow’s assassination attempt on Zu An, the clan had arranged for him to protect Zu An.

“The assassin has already left,” Zu An said with a disappointed tone.

Those guards were all stunned. How would you know that? But, having been around him long enough, they had come to recognize that this young master had some secrets, so they didn’t doubt his words.

“Let’s head to Brightmoon Academy first, just to be safe,” said another guard. This was Feng Daniu, the most evenly-tempered of the three guards. He was built like an ox, tall and large, just as his name suggested.[1]

“Indeed, no one will dare to cause trouble in the academy. The Chu clan will receive news about this soon, so Commander Yue will be there to escort the young miss and young master back.” Another guard swept an intimidating look over anyone who tried to approach them.

This person was another guard the Chu clan had assigned to watch over Zu An, named Zhou Lujun. His blade technique was just as cold and sharp as his appearance.

“Okay!” Zu An had no objections. The academy was full of powerful individuals. Chen Xuan would be completely outmatched if he went there.

Zu An took in the young lady’s alarmed expression, so he tried to console her in a quiet voice. “Huanzhao, don’t be scared. The assassin has already left.” She was still young, after all.

“Brother-in-law, did you get hurt anywhere? Oh my goodness, there’s so much blood!” Chu Huanzhao finally snapped out of her daze. Her small hands searched his body, a worried expression on her face.

“I’m fine, this is all horse blood. That horse really had it rough!” Zu An felt terrible inside. He hadn’t spent that much time with that horse, but he had always been someone who got attached easily.

He would definitely make Chen Xuan repay this debt that was owed.

“That’s good, that’s good.” Chu Huanzhao slowly recovered from her shock. After such a bad scare, she had completely forgotten about the previous matter.

Seeing these two holding each other, comforting each other so intimately, Jiao Shanhe and the other guards looked at each other in dismay.

“Aren’t the second miss and the young master a little too close?”

“I don’t think we should get too involved in Master’s family affairs.”

“But what if something really does end up happening between them? Will Master and Madam blame us?”

“I don’t think they will. Besides, second miss is still so young. Would young master really do something like that? Does he look like a savage?”

“He kind of does to me.”

...

Their party rushed to the academy. A few guards remained at the entrance, while Chu Huanzhao left to attend her classes.

Zu An went back to his staff dormitory instead. He wanted to wash up and get all of this blood off of him first.

He had just taken off his clothes when he suddenly heard some activity by the entrance. His heart trembled. Did that Chen Xuan really sneak into the academy? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

With the Tai’e Sword tightly clenched in hand, he swung the door open and thrust outwards.

“Ah!”

There was a cry of alarm. Zu An pulled back his sword in a panic. He immediately grew embarrassed when he saw the stunning beauty before him. “Big sister Shang, why are you here?”

“I noticed someone was in when I was walking by. We haven’t chatted in a while, so I decided to drop in.” Shang Liuyu was dressed in a long green skirt today. She quickly recovered from her shock. “Who did you think I was? Why would you suddenly pull a blade on me...”

Before she finished her sentence, she noticed the incredible muscles on his exposed upper body. A light flush of color immediately spread across her neck.
