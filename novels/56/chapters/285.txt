Chapter 285: Fire in the Back Garden

Translator: Pika

Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru’s faces turned pale with fright when they heard her words.

Qn Wanru immediately pulled her daughter to the side. “Chuyan, you cannot make such a rash decision! We will think of a different way!”

Chu Zhongtian, on the other hand, was studying Zu An with an extremely complicated expression. This son-in-law of his really was something else!

Everyone knew that there was nothing special about him, and even viewed him as a piece of trash. They had already been incredibly jealous when they heard that he had ended up marrying the Chu clan’s first miss.

Yet now, even this absolutely stunning Qiu Honglei had fallen for him. She was even throwing herself at him so aggressively!

Could this be attributed to luck anymore? Had he truly been a hero in his past life or something?

Sigh, even with my status as Brightmoon Duke, I probably won’t be able to land a girl like Qiu Honglei unless I use my authority. Why is there a sour taste in my mouth all of a sudden?

The hero in this situation, Zu An, was currently thinking about the soap operas of his previous world. There were many instances where the heroine would offer up their body to the villains to save a captured protagonist.

Then, is Qiu Honglei that villain, and I am the heroine?

This truly doesn’t feel bad at all, though. I’ll take another one, please.

Chu Chuyan tried to placate the distraught Qin Wanru. “I know what I am doing, mother.”

Many of the clan’s matters were already managed by Chu Chuyan. To a certain extent, she was already a vice clan master.

There was nothing much Qin Wanru could say after hearing that she had made her decision. However, she couldn’t shake her discomfort.

What clan in Brightmoon City—no, in the entire Great Zhou Dynasty!—has ever had a son-in-law this unbridled?!

Just how long has it been since he joined the clan? And he already has a concubine?

Speaking of, can drafted son-in-laws even have concubines?

The wife’s family is even helping him get a concubine!

Why do I feel like everyone is taking advantage of our Chu clan these days? Just who is the dukedom here?!

You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for 66... 66... 66...

Qiu Honglei relaxed when she heard Chu Chuyan’s agreement. Her actions indeed carried quite the risk. If the Chu clan hadn’t agreed, things would have taken a complicated turn.

She also knew to get out while she was ahead. Since the other party agreed, she wouldn’t play any other tricks. She immediately revealed Wang Yuanlong’s whereabouts to quell their anger. “From the information I received, young master Wang seems to be kept in Cleverjade Lane.”

“Cleverjade Lane!” Chu Zhongtian exclaimed. No wonder they couldn’t find him! He was actually being kept in a brothel!

All of their men were busy searching remote and hidden places, but their target was actually hiding right in the city!

“Yue Shan!” Chu Zhongtian immediately gave out orders. Now that they knew where Wang Yuanlong was, it would be much easier to carry out a rescue.

Such matters did not require Chu Zhongtian’s personal attention. With Yue Shan commanding a group of elite troops, they’d even be able to take care of Chen Xuan if he showed up.

Yue Shan quickly acknowledged his orders and left. When he had departed, Chu Zhongtian brought his focus back to Qiu Honglei.

After all, his daughter’s happiness was much more important to him than Wang Yuanlong.

Chu Zhongtian thought over how to phrase his question. “So, Lady Qiu, why did you end up... favoring Zu An? To be honest, I find it a bit hard to believe, even now.”

Qin Wanru and Chu Chuyan nodded in full agreement. They weren’t saying that Zu An was bad, but that this situation was just too strange.

“Respected Brightmoon Duke, I truly do not know either. Love moves in strange ways. These days, I’ve only had a single thought in my mind, and that was to marry him,” Qiu Honglei said with a bashful expression.

Chu Chuyan gave Zu An a fierce glare. What in the world did this guy do to scam this girl?

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for 33... 33... 33...

Zu An burst out laughing when he saw the Rage points come in. His wife’s jealousy was adorable.

Chu Zhongtian was stupefied by her answer. He was silent for a long while, before he finally sighed and said, “How does lady Qiu plan to leave the Immortal Abode if Wang Yuanlong is successfully rescued? I can send some people over to pay your release fee.”

Qin Wanru kicked her husband fiercely under the table, leaving Chu Zhongtian completely dumbfounded. “Dear, what’s wrong?” he asked via ki transmission.

Qin Wanru replied, “Why are you being so proactive on this matter? Are you itching to bring her into our estate or something?”

Panicked, Chu Zhongtian tried to defend himself. “What are you saying? We’ve already promised her! The Chu clan has been as good as their word for hundreds of years. We cannot be the cause of our reputation being ruined.”

“Do you care about your daughter at all? It seems like you’re already eager to drag in a vixen to compete with her!” Qin Wanru kicked with even more force. “Are you really doing this for Ah Zu or for yourself?”

Chu Zhongtian smiled bitterly, “Wife, it’s not like you don’t know about my situation. How could I ever harbor such thoughts?”

Qin Wanru’s face flushed red. She knew that she was being unreasonably jealous here. However, that was in her nature, and she wasn’t willing to just back down. She continued to grumble, “Even if you can’t touch her, just looking at her is probably still enjoyable to you, isn’t it? This is a vixen that even makes my heart rate quicken when I look at her. I can’t imagine what she does to you men!”

Chu Zhongtian had no words left to say.

He realized that reasoning with his wife wasn’t an intelligent move. The more he said, the more mistakes he made. He decided just to shut his mouth.

Qiu Honglei gave the two of them a look. As if she guessed what they were discussing, she said with a smile, “There’s no need to trouble Brightmoon Duke. I have put aside some savings during these years, and I’ve already talked things out with mama Hua in the Immortal Abode. There is no issue with me obtaining freedom on my own.”

The three Chu clan members looked at each other in dismay. Even Qin Wanru was dumbstruck. She had seen people make stupid choices that lost them money instead of making them money, but this was on a whole different level.

Allowing their daughter to marry Zu An had already seemed like a loss to the Chu clan, but compared to Qiu Honglei’s choice, it was absolutely nothing.

However, just thinking about how her daughter had to share a man with a brothel girl slowly made her more and more annoyed. She said coldly, “Our Chu clan can still pay this bit of money. If news got out that we let Lady Qiu pay her own way to freedom, our Chu clan will become a huge laughingstock.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Qiu Honglei shook her head. “Madam Chu, I wish to make one point clear. I am not marrying into the Chu clan. I am not someone who belongs to the Chu clan, but rather to Ah Zu. That is why I truly do not dare act so shamelessly as to take Master and Madam’s money.”

For the umpteenth time that night, the three Chu clan members were stunned speechless.

Even Zu An couldn’t help but sigh in admiration. “Honglei, you really treat me too well.”

“Shut up!”

Chu Chuyan and Qin Wanru both glared daggers at him.

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for 250 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for 250 Rage points!

Zu An wisely shut his mouth. He was already the winner out of all of this, yet he was still causing trouble. No wonder they got upset at him.

Qiu Honglei looked like she was given a scare. She gave Zu An a shy look, and then her eyes returned to the three Chu clan members, her expression as pitiful as it could be.

Chu Chuyan felt a wave of annoyance surge within her. I’m not even yelling at you! Who are you putting on this performance for?

Qin Wanru was extremely irritated as well. This girl was making them look like monsters! However, there really wasn’t much she could say.

It’s all that brat Zu An’s fault!

They glared at Zu An a second time.

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for 444 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for 444 Rage points!

A flash of inspiration struck Zu An when he saw these Rage points. He’d discovered another way to make a killing on Rage points.

It seems like having more close girlfriends doesn’t only make others donate Rage points to me out of jealousy. I can even earn Rage points from my close girlfriends themselves!

Those guys with harems are always scared of their girls getting angry at each other, but I’m different! The more they fight, the better! The more angry they get, the more Rage points I pocket.

I’m such a bloody genius!

Chu Chuyan tamped down her rage and said coldly, “Lady Qiu does not wish to become a part of the Chu clan, but Ah Zu is part of the Chu clan. Even if we leave aside other matters for now, where does Lady Qiu plan on living?”

“Big sis’ is correct to reprimand me. This humble one has taken things for granted.” Qiu Honglei smiled. “As for where, I’ll obviously live wherever Ah Zu lives. But, if he is living together with big sis, then pretend I didn’t say anything. It is enough if you arrange a small room for me.”

The clump of anger in her chest grew steadily. This woman clearly knows that I don’t live with Zu An! Did she say this on purpose?!

Ah Zu definitely spilled everything. How else would she know all of this?! Chu Chuyan shot Zu An another hateful look.

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for 666 Rage points!

Qin Wanru sneered inside. This woman really is worthy of her place in the Immortal Abode. Her methods are incredibly savage! How can my pure little girl be a match for her? This won’t do. I have to lend my daughter a hand.

Zu An wanted to ease the tension. Actually, I don’t really care where I stay, haha...

He didn’t even mind if all three of them stayed together. However, for the sake of keeping his head attached to his shoulders, he wisely chose to keep these words to himself.

Qin Wanru said, “Lady Qiu, it is already late. Let’s slowly discuss these matters another time.”

This was where her experience kicked in. She would get rid of this girl first, and then discuss things privately at another time.

No one expected Qiu Honglei to say with a slight blush, “Actually, I don’t have to go back. Either way... either way I am already Ah Zu’s.”

“Zu An!” Chu Chuyan suddenly got up. She couldn’t hold herself back anymore. A chilling wave of energy suddenly spread outwards.

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for 1024 Rage points!

Just as she was about to say something, her face flushed with an unnatural redness. She spat out a mouthful of blood, and her entire body crumpled.

Before the blood even landed on the ground, it had already turned into crystals.

“Honey!” Zu An screamed, rushing to support his unconscious wife. His mischievous expression disappeared without a trace.

Qiu Honglei wore a pensive expression. There were rumors that Chu Chuyan suffered serious internal injuries, but others said that she was perfectly fine. Now that she had witnessed this firsthand, she knew that her condition was far worse than the rumors stated.

“Get lost! It was you who caused her such harm! How could you have the nerve to touch her?!” Qin Wanru was a bundle of nerves. She reached out a hand to push him aside.

You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for 678 Rage points!

“I am the only one who can save her right now,” Zu An replied coldly. “Do you really want to vent your anger or do you want to help save Chuyan?”

Qin Wanru felt a chill run through her body. Her daughter had indeed said that it was Zu An who had been treating her condition. She couldn’t find any words to rebut him.

Zu An quickly carried Chu Chuyan back to her room. Qin Wanru followed them in a state of panic.

Chu Zhongtian saw that his wife hadn’t argued when Zu An said that he would save Chuyan. There was clearly something he didn’t know. However, he trusted his wife’s judgment.

He stayed behind to deal with the aftermath. “Lady Qiu, it is already late. The city has not been too peaceful recently, so please rest in the estate tonight.”

Qiu Honglei knew that he was worried she might reveal Chu Chuyan’s real condition to outsiders. She bowed slightly. “Thank you Brightmoon Duke. I really must apologize for today’s matters.”

“What happened earlier cannot be put on your shoulders.” Chu Zhongtian waved his hand distractedly. “Send someone to bring Lady Qiu to the room to rest.”

He too was worried about Chu Chuyan’s condition, and beat a hasty farewell. He wasn’t in the mood to deal with her.

“Understood!”

Some servants escorted Qiu Honglei away.

Qiu Honglei flashed a sudden, sweet smile. “Excuse me, which room do you plan to bring me to?”

“The guest room, Lady Qiu.” The servant could feel his soul about to leave his body, just from her smile alone.

“How about you bring me to the young master’s room?”

“Isn’t that a little inappropriate?”

“Did the Master and Madam not tell you? That was what they arranged for.”

“Ah, is that so? All right, then.”
