Chapter 772, Part 1: The Royal Academy’s Eighth Senior

Translator: Pika

Her thighs were thick, but her calves were slender, drawing a perfect curve. Together with her fair and smooth skin, it formed a powerful contrast.

But Zu An wasn’t in the mood to admire any of that. He gave the mature and sophisticated woman seated on the windowsill a look of surprise and asked, “Principal Jiang, what are you doing here?”

“I heard you were ambushed, so I came to take a look. The Xie siblings wanted to come as well, but Xie Daoyun was instructed to practice rune drawing by her teacher, while Xie Xiu’s teacher made him play chess with him. They’re quite busy, so they entrusted me to visit you.” Jiang Luofu’s fine black hair was held up with a jade hairpin, making her long and slender neck appear even more graceful. She was wearing a pair of elegant flat-framed glasses today as well.

If Zu An had seen her at any other time, videos of sexy teachers, secretaries, and office ladies might have already filled his head. Even now, he was dazed as he looked at the familiar figure in front of him. It was as if he had returned to his old world.

“Did you hurt your head? Your face looks pretty stupid right now.” Jiang Luofu grinned.

Zu An was upset. “You aren’t acting like a caring visitor at all, but more like you came here to make fun of me.”

“Don’t you look fine?” Jiang Luofu leaped down from the window and walked over gracefully, her long and slender legs on display.

Zu An had to admit that just watching this woman walk was the most delightful scene. Not many of the girls from the media he used to watch could compare to this principal.

“There’s quite a bit of dust on your window. You should clean it sometime,” Jiang Luofu said, frowning slightly while patting away some dust from her bottom.

Zu An said a bit apologetically, “It hasn’t been long since I moved into this place, and there’s no one around to help me clean it up. Only a few servants were added recently.” He couldn’t help but think of Chu Chuyan when he thought of that. She usually seemed cold and aloof, but she was the one who cared the most about him.

“Why didn’t you come in through the front? Why did you have to jump in through the window?” he asked. Even though there were simple defensive formations in place around this residence, they clearly couldn’t stop true experts.

Jiang Luofu said with a gloomy expression, “I did try to go in from the front, but those servants said that you weren’t in a good mood, and that you weren’t taking guests. What else could I do but break in then?”

“Sorry.” Zu An chuckled in embarrassment, now remembering his earlier discouragement. That was why he had indeed warned those servants beforehand.

“Looks like your mood really wasn’t too great today. If it were any other day, you would have already said a bunch of nonsense to me. What happened?” Jiang Luofu was a bit surprised.

“Nonsense, am I that type of person?” Zu An replied, standing up. However, he quickly became listless again as he said, “Chuyan went back to Brightmoon City.”

Jiang Luofu voiced her surprise. “I didn’t expect you to be someone so affectionate.”

Zu An was stunned. He replied, “Sis, you’re praising me, but why do I feel like you’re mocking me?”

Jiang Luofu laughed, but as she approached Zu An, her expression turned serious. “I heard that you might have been hit by a siege crossbow. How’s the injury now?”

“It’s fine—” Zu An began, but he was interrupted before he could even finish.

Jiang Luofu cut him off. “Take off your clothes and let me take a look.”

Zu An was speechless. Are these mature big sisters all so aggressive? Why do I feel like I’m losing my place as the protagonist?

While Zu An was hesitating, Jiang Luofu had already walked over to his side. She took off his clothes without any explanation.

Zu An was stunned as he asked, “Principal Jiang, are you trying to assault me?”

“Why would I assault a brat like you?” Jiang Luofu laughed and said, “Also, I'm no longer a principal, so you don’t need to call me that anymore.”

“You’re not a principal anymore?” Zu An asked, stunned.

“Did you already forget that I told you I was transferred back to the capital’s Royal Academy? The principal is now Libationer Chen,” Jiang Luofu explained while examining his body. “Hm? It really did penetrate your chest! But why did this wound heal so quickly?”

No matter how fast Zu An’s recovery was, the wound was extremely massive. The color of the newly replaced skin was still a bit lighter, and there were signs of scabbing.

“It’s not as if you don’t know what kind of crazy abilities I have.” Zu An chuckled. Either way, the other party had never seen anyone else with transcendent level aptitude, so she couldn’t prove him wrong.

Jiang Luofu propped up her chin with one hand and said to herself, “The transcendent level aptitude has such strong regeneration abilities? That’s too ridiculous! No wonder there weren’t many of them, and yet eventually, all of them became legendary figures.”

Zu An really couldn’t take it anymore. It was one thing for her to be all dressed up like an office lady, but now, even her current posture was incredibly seductive. Sigh, aren’t these women just baiting me into doing something bad?

Jiang Luofu snapped out of her daze shortly after and said, “Right, apart from checking up on you, there was something else I wanted to say to you today.”

“What is it?” Zu An’s frivolous smile faded when he saw that Jiang Luofu was serious.

“According to what I found out in these past few days, I discovered that you’ve already suffered several assassination attempts since you arrived in the capital. Furthermore, there are several powers who are opposed to you, both in the open and in the dark.” Jiang Luofu’s gaze revealed a bit of concern.

Zu An sighed. “What can I say? I always draw attention wherever I go, and all men become jealous. They naturally wish I were dead.”

“Your mouth is always the same after all.” Jiang Luofu chuckled and asked, “Do you still remember your identity as a teacher in Brightmoon Academy?”

“Yeah, but that was just a temporary post,” Zu An muttered.

Jiang Luofu was silent for a moment. Eventually she said, “I’ll try to see if I can get you the title of a teacher in the Royal Academy again. This way, with the identity of a Royal Academy teacher, I believe those powers will have to have more misgivings before doing anything to you.”

Zu An was a bit surprised. “Principal Jiang, why are you so good to me?”

“Maybe we were brought together by fate.” Jiang Luofu smiled and said, “But don’t think anything strange. This is purely out of favor for you, as well as your transcendent aptitude that has raised my interest. I want to see for myself just how far you’ll go.”

“There’s not even a speck of love?” Zu An asked, sounding a bit disappointed.

Jiang Luofu’s expression darkened. “Get lost!”

A while later, she said, “Follow me to the academy. We’ll pay Sir Libationer a visit. If you want to become a teacher in the academy, you need his approval.” Jiang Luofu got up from her seat. Her long legs truly were fair and dazzling.

“Okay.” Zu An had already wanted to pay the libationer a visit to get some answers to his confusion.

“Then let’s leave now.” Jiang Luofu gestured with her fingers, and then turned around to leave.

When the servants saw Zu An follow her out, their eyes widened in shock. The group of maids and servants began to whisper among themselves.

“Her legs are so long! Isn’t this too much?”

“Hmph, she’s dressed so frivolously. How can she compare to our first miss?”

“But how long has it been since the first miss left? Yet the young master is already meeting other women! Pah, a playboy!”

“What do you understand? That only proves the young master is extremely charming.”

…

The Royal Academy was located west of the city, at the foot of Mount Yuquan. There weren’t many places in the capital with mountains.

The most majestic and elegant mountains were Mount Zijin and Mount Yuquan. Mount Zijin was near the imperial palace, while Mount Yuquan was beside the Royal Academy. It was easy to see just how high the status of the academy was.

Zu An followed Jiang Luofu to the foot of Mount Yuquan. He saw a grand memorial arch, large vermilion pillars, and a blue backdrop. Three characters were written in bold calligraphy: ‘The Imperial College’.

When she saw the confusion in Zu An’s eyes, Jiang Luofu explained, “The Royal Academy was called the Imperial College at first, and then it was changed to the name Royal Academy afterward. However, because this placard was written by the first generation libationer and is related to the academy’s mountain protecting formation, this placard had been left behind all this time.”

“Why was its name changed?” Zu An was confused. The new name was so modernized. Had a transmigrator come up with it?

Jiang Luofu was stunned. “You really asked a good question; even I’m stumped. I don’t know why it was changed either. Maybe everyone just eventually started calling it the Royal Academy.”

“Oh?” Zu An began to think to himself.

Past the memorial arch was a perfectly straight path. The trees on either side were tall and ancient, further illustrating the academy’s history. Then they arrived at a grand gate; written on it were the words ‘Royal National Academy’. Judging from the calligraphy, it didn’t seem to have been written by the same person as the previous placard.

Perhaps because they saw Jiang Luofu, the guards at the entrance didn’t stop the two of them. Zu An followed Jiang Luofu inside, and he discovered that the interior felt completely different from Brightmoon Academy.

Brightmoon Academy was somewhat brighter. Whether it was the trees or the buildings, everything seemed newer. The Royal Academy was somewhat darker. The trees reached into the skies, and the buildings looked somewhat more aged. The walls were also covered in vine-like plants, conveying a sense of the passage of time.

Zu An suddenly sensed something strange. Some students were looking in his direction from time to time.
