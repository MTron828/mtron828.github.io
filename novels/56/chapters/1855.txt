Chapter 1804: Entrusted With a Mission (Teaser)

The Ghost King and Zhao Han were both feeling pretty awful. 

We’re fighting with our lives on the line here, and yet that brat is playing the kissing game over there?! And with two freaking beauties at that?

F*ck that!

Zhao Han suddenly felt a bit weary deep down. He felt that he should have just let the Ghost King smack them to death. All of you can just disappear!

The Ghost King stared at Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman. He could sense that their kiss really did seem to counteract his Glare of Eternal Slumber. The grayish-white energy in Zu An’s body was already growing fainter.

Don’t tell me that these two were able to free themselves from the Glare of Eternal Slumber precisely through this method? Preposterous!

Who the hell came up with this damned method? It’s clearly just to deal with me!

…

At that moment, Zu An was already about to faint, but not because of the Glare of Eternal Slumber. He was about to faint from bliss. He had never expected that he would be able to experience such a thing. These two women had both taken the initiative to kiss him! On top of that, they were just too good! The wonderful feeling that seemed to caress one’s very soul made his entire body stiffen, but he then melted under their soft fingers. He felt as if every single pore on his body were cheering with joy.

Kiss of the Goddess was the world’s most powerful kissing art, after all. What could be more wonderful than a goddess’ kiss?

Of course there was something better, which was to be kissed by two goddesses at the same time.

What was one plus one? Zu An had never thought of that question in such a context, but now, he suddenly became confused. It was much more than just twofold joy; it was an exponential increase! A spiral explosion!

Not even Baogu could have anticipated such a situation. After all, from her perspective, those who could use Kiss of the Goddess could only be incredibly rare beauties who had tons of admirers. Anyone who could obtain their favor would definitely be among the most outstanding of men. How could there be two goddesses who liked the same man at the same time, let alone ones who would use Kiss of the Goddess on that same man?

They practiced the same skill, so when it was used at the same time, it had an even more incredible synergistic effect. It was at a level not even Baogu had reached.

Soon after, the grayish-white energy in Zu An’s body completely disappeared. The Glare of Eternal Slumber was finally completely cured. But Zu An didn’t let the two women go, nor did they leave him. They cuddled quietly together just like that, basking in the divine feeling.

Mi Li secretly appeared. She couldn't help but rub her own arms. This really was a bit too cringy for her to watch.

Youngsters nowadays really know how to go crazy. But these two disciple-in-laws are pretty interesting.

When she thought about how both of them would serve her respectfully in the future, she couldn't help but smile in satisfaction.

I’ll just leave this hellish battlefield for them to fight over.

Mi Li quickly disappeared. Due to her soul being bound to Zu An, unless she wanted to show herself, no one else would notice her. As such, no one noticed her at all.

…

Qiu Honglei’s eyelids twitched. When she saw that the two women were still clinging onto their love and kissing affectionately, she suddenly felt as if the world had a slight green tint to it. She finally couldn't take it anymore and asked with an impatient cough, “Are you still not done?”

Jing Teng rolled her eyes.

You’re finally saying something now?

Chu Chuyan was usually quite easily embarrassed. Earlier, she had only done something so brazen because she couldn't stand all those beauties hanging around at Zu An’s side. Now, after using Kiss of the Goddess, not only had she gotten rid of all of Zu An’s drowsiness, she had also vented out all her frustrations. How could she continue to act the same way?

She quickly jumped away, her face as red as a tomato saying, “We… We’re done.”

After Chuyan left, even Pei Mianman didn’t have the shame to stay there. With her nature, she normally wouldn’t mind staying a bit longer, but when she thought about how doing so would really anger the others, setting Chuyan and the other women completely against her, she decided that would be a terrible result.

Zu An felt as if he still hadn’t fully expressed himself. That experience was just too amazing! Even though it was just a kiss, it was much more enjoyable than many other things.

When she saw him lick his lips, Qiu Honglei nearly imploded from anger. 

Was it really that great?!

You have successfully trolled Qiu Honglei for +399 +399 +399…

However, she reacted quickly as well and collected her thoughts. She walked over and held Zu An’s arm, asking, “Ah Zu, do you feel a bit better? Should we have them treat you a bit more?”

Zu An felt a bit warm inside when he sensed the concern in her voice. Even though he did kind of want to continue, he couldn't bring himself to say it out loud. Instead, he replied, “I’m alright.”

Qiu Honglei then bowed to Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman, saying, “Thank you for saving Ah Zu, big sisters, and for making such a great sacrifice…”

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman both raised their brows. 

Do we need you to thank us for saving our own man? Look at this girl acting like a green tea bitch; as expected of the Devil Sect witch.

Qiu Honglei then feigned curiosity as she asked, “By the way, where did big sisters learn such an incredible kissing technique from?”

Now, even Zu An looked at the two women skeptically. He had kissed them before, but they hadn’t been so incredible at it. The difference in skill now was astronomical.

Jing Teng’s expression changed a bit. Even though she hadn’t spent that much time in the world of humans, her feminine instincts made her realize that those words were actually incredibly dangerous.

Does young master Zu really have this kind of hellish battlefield around him?

Every single one of these women is terrifying!

Chu Chuyan’s face reddened. She tried to stay calm as she replied, “I accidentally stumbled into a cave and received the guidance of a female senior. Then, I unwittingly ended up learning it.”

Pei Mianman also matched her story as she explained herself. She couldn't just say that they had practiced it together, right?

Meanwhile, the Ghost King was practically about to cry, thinking, Just what female senior was this, actually leaving behind a kissing skill and targeting me?! Just what kind of field did that damned woman work in when she was alive?

Pei Mianman suddenly remembered something and said, “Right, we promised that senior something.”

Chu Chuyan also remembered that. She looked at the coffin not too far away, asking, “Is that Immortal Ruler Baopu over there?”

The reason the two of them had ended up finding this place was because the power of the inheritance Baogu left behind had led them to it. There seemed to be something present that drew them toward it.

“It is,” Jing Teng said, nodding reflexively.

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman walked up to the sides of the coffin. However, when they saw the man in the daoist robes, they suddenly hesitated. After all, this was the legendary Immortal Ruler Baopu! The only one who had successfully ascended to immortality in thousands of years!

However, even though both women’s natures were different, they weren’t the kind who would back out of a promise. In order to save them, Baogu had used up the last of her energy and couldn’t personally come here. As such, they exchanged a look, and both saw the determination in each other’s eyes.

“Senior, we apologize for our offense,” they said. Then, they each raised one hand and gave the remains a slap.

Slap!

Slap!

“What are you two doing?!” Jing Teng exclaimed in shock and fury.

A second ago, these two had been showing Immortal Ruler Baopu great respect, and yet a second later, they actually slapped him?! A slap to the face was extremely humiliating even for an ordinary person, let alone someone like Immortal Ruler Baopu!

The Ghost King and Zhao Han were stupefied. A second before, these women had still been hugging and kissing each other, practically about to melt into water in Zu An’s arms. And yet a second later, both suddenly became this fierce? After all, not even they would dare to rashly show Immortal Ruler Baopu disrespect. He did have his great reputation after all, and who knew what kind of traps he had left behind.

Sure enough, the tomb room suddenly began to rumble with noise, as if it could collapse at any moment. Waves of energy began to gather toward the copper coffin. Immediately after, a terrifying aura rose from it.

A dazzling golden figure slowly emerged from the coffin. Compared to Zhao Han’s golden light that was full of oppressive power, the figure’s aura carried a special divine nature. Those present all realized that the figure was none other than Immortal Ruler Baopu, who had been lying in the coffin.

Zhao Han had a strange expression. They had tried all sorts of things before, and yet nothing happened at all. He had even knelt down and respectfully kowtowed a couple dozen times, and yet the immortal ruler had remained indifferent. But now, the immortal ruler woke up after two slaps to the face?

What the hell is wrong with you?!

Of course, he would never say that out loud. The aura around that person’s body seemed to carry an even higher grade of natural law. Could he be none other than a legendary immortal?

Zhao Han tried to study it and see if he could sense the gateway to immortality himself. However, no matter what he did, he didn’t gain any inspiration. These were natural laws on a completely different level. Without someone to provide guidance and lead the way, one could never hope to approach such a level of mastery. He began breathing heavily. If he could obtain that inheritance, wouldn’t he become immortal?Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Immortal Ruler Baopu’s eyes slowly opened. He silently scanned his surroundings with his gaze, then asked, “Who was it that dared to treat this immortal ruler with disrespect?”

The Ghost King had planned to leave the place first, but when he heard the voice, he stopped.

Are those two women idiots? They actually went over and slapped the face of an immortal ruler for no reason. There’s something interesting to watch now.

Once the immortal ruler dealt with those women, that kid Zu An would definitely help out. Meanwhile, Zhao Han was part of their group, so wouldn’t he, the Ghost King, end up reaping all of the benefits?

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman were closest to the coffin and felt the greatest pressure. However, they still had the mission Baogu entrusted them with, so they braced themselves and replied, “It was us!”

Immortal Ruler Baopu’s eyes narrowed. Zu An quickly moved in front of the two women for fear that he would just end their lives out of anger.
