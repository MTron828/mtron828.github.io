Chapter 1769: Shocking Developments

Wang Youjun sighed in relief, thinking that the situation was resolved. He was starting to regret bringing Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun along. They had added unnecessary variables for no reason. Still, without them, they wouldn’t have been able to move past the sea of mist either. Fortunately, the final conclusion was good.

He didn’t really believe his relationship with his son was that good; rather, he thought Wang Neishi was nothing more than a wastrel who spent all of his time on women. Even if his son obtained the three talismans, he definitely wouldn’t be a match. It would still be easy enough to deal with him.

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun both felt their hearts plummet. There was no chance to stop what was happening. They could only watch as Wang Neishi grabbed the three talismans.

“Hahaha, I never expected them to enter my hands in the end! Looks like I was the one chosen by the heavens after all!” Wang Neishi cried, breathing quickly. With these three talismans, forget about the brothers he competed with, even his father’s position as the clan leader could potentially become his.

However, his expression suddenly changed. He frantically tried to throw the three talismans away, but they didn’t leave his hands no matter what he did. The three who were fighting couldn't help but stop attacking, turning to look at the stage.

Wang Neishi’s hand reached toward Wang Youjun, his eyes filled with a pleading gaze as he began, “Save…”

Wang Youjun was shocked. He quickly looked at the three talismans and saw that the yellow paper’s cinnabar diagrams had turned a sinister red, as if blood had been used to draw them again. At the same time, Wang Neishi’s entire body shriveled at a visible rate. In just a few moments, his once sturdy figure became a shriveled, dried corpse.

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun were speechless. However, Xie Daoyun couldn't help but feel grateful. If she hadn’t been swapped out earlier, she would have been the one to end up as a shriveled corpse.

Wang Youjun didn’t have time to feel regret. Instead, he looked at the stage. The three talismans shone with a malicious red glow as they spun wildly around the corpse at the center. Blood-colored threads connected the talismans with the scorched corpse. It was as if they were transporting blood essence to it. Gradually, the scorched corpse began to grow new flesh beneath its charred black surface.

When she saw the shocking scene, how could Yun Jianyue still be in the mood to fight? She couldn't help but swallow with great difficulty, saying, “I recall you saying that your Sect Master Sun En failed tribulation and was blasted to death by lightning.”

“That is what should have happened, in theory,” Wang Youjun said, his voice hoarse.

An indescribable aura began to surge. Both of their expressions changed greatly. They immediately turned and ran. Yun Jianyue picked up the stupefied Xie Daoyun along the way. Soon after, though, the three had no choice but to stop, because they were stopped by the terrifying lightning stone forest. They couldn't leave even if they wanted to.

Crackle!

The three turned around and saw that the charred skin of the corpse was coming off piece by piece. Eventually, a powerful figure stood up from the throne. Wide-eyed and broad-nosed, the man was surrounded by a mysterious aura of power. A daoist robe formed over his body, and the three talismans that were quickly spinning around him quickly vanished into its sleeves. He looked down at the area; his gaze was so sharp it seemed tangible, making the three feel their skin hurting.

Xie Daoyun was one thing, but Yun Jianyue’s cultivation was higher, and she clearly understood that this guy’s aura was no weaker than Zhao Han’s!

Thud!

The proud and confident Wang Youjun audibly dropped to his knees, saying, “This subordinate pays his respects to the sect master! The sect master’s martial and artistic virtue is a blessing to the people; your longevity will last thousands of autumns, ten thousand generations! You will unify the martial world!”

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun exchanged a look. They both saw the surprise in each other’s eyes. Was this really the Divine Firmament Sect Master, Sun En? When it came to the two of them kneeling and kowtowing, that was completely impossible, though. Forget about Yun Jianyue’s pride, Xie Daoyun didn’t even need to bow to her own teacher, let alone to a stranger.

“Oh, so it was Elder Wang,” Sun En said, giving him a look. “What were you doing here?”

When he sensed Sun En’s gaze, Wang Youjun’s back was completely drenched in sweat. He said, “After sect master disappeared, this subordinate searched the world for your whereabouts. Recently, I finally found some clues. I was originally going to bring sect master back for a proper burial, but I never expected sect master to still be alive! This is an incredibly joyous affair! Once your respected self returns, our Divine Firmament Sect will no longer be split up and divided.”

“Split up and divided?” Sun En asked, his eyes narrowing.

Wang Youjun didn’t even dare to wipe the sweat on his forehead. He quickly explained, “It is mainly because sect master disappeared for many years, so Elder Sun, Elder Qian, Elder Li, and the others all wanted to become the new sect master. None of them were willing to give in to the others, so…”

Sun En gave him a deep look and asked, “You were one of them too, no?”

Wang Youjun was now sweating even harder. He quickly said, “It was only because I didn’t wish for the Divine Firmament Sect to be divided! If I had known that the sect master was still in this world, I naturally wouldn’t have dared to have such thoughts!”

Sun En sneered and said, “Fine. Seeing as I was able to come back to life because of your arrival, I won’t bicker with you.”

“Thank you, sect master!” Wang Youjun replied, kowtowing while feeling his stomach turn over. He had lost so much on this trip. Over half of Wang Port’s elites had been lost, and even his own son had died. And yet, even after all of that, this was the end result! Of course, he didn’t dare to show any of that on the surface.

Sun En looked at Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun, asking, “Who are they? Why aren’t they kneeling in my presence?”

Yun Jianyue said proudly, “No one in this world can stand in this one’s way. I’ve never even knelt in front of the emperor himself, so why should I kneel in front of you?”UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Wang Youjun quickly said, “These two aren’t from the Divine Firmament Sect. I invited them to deal with the mist formation outside, but they had rapacious designs and actually coveted the sect master’s three records!”

He was worried that what these two said would put him in danger, so he decided to speak first. He also bore a deep grudge against the two of them for ruining his plan. If not for them, he might have already succeeded, not giving Sun En the chance to revive.

Sun En’s expression couldn't help but darken when he heard the explanation. He yelled, “You dare to put on airs in front of me?”

As soon as he spoke, a talisman suddenly appeared. He chanted a few lines and a storm surged around him. Several dozen figures condensed in the clouds, and a suit of lightning armor flickered around his body and emanated waves of powerful and divine energy. It was as if he had become a general from the heavens.

Wang Youjun looked at the celestial troops in the clouds. Every single one was incredibly powerful. He thought enviously, The Record of Emperor's Suppression is powerful beyond compare, as expected…

Just then, the celestial army brandished an assortment of weapons. They rushed straight at Yun Jianyue. Yun Jianyue shivered. Every single one of these celestial troops was at least at the master rank. Furthermore, the divine aura coming from their bodies seemed to have a restraining effect on her.

However, she was the kind of person who responded to strength with more strength. She didn’t have any fear on her face. The Crescent Ring spun and slashed toward the troops as she charged in like a tiger among sheep. The Crescent Ring drew out profound arcs around her, and the celestial troops never even had a chance to encircle her before they were destroyed. In just a few breaths of time, the endless soldiers were completely slaughtered.

Even though the celestial troops had master rank strength, they were dead creatures. They couldn't really bring out the true power of master rank cultivators. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been so easy for her.

When he saw the tangible killing intent in Yun Jianyue’s eyes, Wang Youjun shivered. This woman’s mysterious weapon really is outrageous. If I really fought against her, I could be injured before I even had the chance to use the talisman’s power.

After being killed, the celestial troops turned into wisps of mist.

Sun En voiced his surprise, saying, “It seems I underestimated your cultivation. You were able to gather such shocking killing intent at such a young age; truly an incredible genius.” But he quickly changed his tone and added, “Even so, you are still a mortal in the end. You cannot resist true heavenly might.”

Yun Jianyue sneered and retorted, “I just heard that Wang guy say that you were blasted to death after failing ascension. What right do you have to represent heavenly might?”

Sun En glowered and snapped, “Impudent!”

With another wave of his hand, another group of celestial troops condensed. Unlike the previous time, there were almost a thousand of them. The whole army surrounded Yun Jianyue.

Yun Jianyue was alarmed. Even though these soldiers didn’t really have souls, so they couldn't bring out their true strength, their numbers were a different problem. If they attacked together, they could smother her with sheer quantity!

Suddenly, a sound filled the air as Xie Daoyun’s hands quickly formed a seal. A blue formation flew at the celestial troops. Surprisingly, however, they weren’t harmed at all.

While Yun Jianyue was confused, Xie Daoyun said urgently through ki transmission, “Hurry! I divided them into several groups, so they can’t attack you together for some time! However, I can’t hold on for that long.”

“Thanks!” Yun Jianyue replied, quickly understanding. She charged forth like a streak of light. The Crescent Ring was like a reaper’s scythe, harvesting batch after batch of heads.

Sun En didn’t seem to mind it at all as those celestial troops were slaughtered. Rather, he carefully sized up Xie Daoyun.
