Chapter 1761: Wang Port

Those people entered the cabin of the flying ship and reported what they saw. Shortly after, a silver-robed young master walked out while holding a wine cup. Following behind him were eight beautiful servants; Two of them helped him pour wine, while two others peeled fruits for him. The others either stood or leaned at his side, using their hands to intimately massage his shoulders and legs.

He arrived near the bow of the ship. When he looked down, a look of surprise instantly appeared in his eyes. He pushed the servants at his side away and stared at the two women below. One was stunning and elegant, while the other was pure and lovely. They really were a rare pair of beauties! Could they fly up here?

However, the two seemed to be in the middle of a battlefield. There were monsters all around them and they had no time to be distracted at all.

Suddenly, the flying boat slowly descended. The ghosts that continued to charge at the two ladies began to hesitate. They even reflexively backed up as if they were scared of something.

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun both shivered. Their strength was actually quite shocking when they worked together, and yet these ghosts weren’t scared of them at all and continued to charge at them relentlessly. However, they were actually scared of someone on the flying boat! Could it be that there was someone even more powerful inside?

In truth, they could still just about hold off the ghosts. As long as they lasted until daytime, they could make it through this disaster. However, if the flying boat contained some being even more terrifying than the ghosts, they would truly be in danger.

While their expressions became more and more grave, a refined young master walked down from the boat and asked, “May I ask why the two ladies are moving through the night? Ghosts roam around at night, making it really too dangerous.”

Yun Jianyue was stunned. Even though this slick-haired, powder-faced pretty boy’s cultivation was decent, forget about herself, even Xie Daoyun was much stronger. Was he the one those ghosts were scared of?

Xie Daoyun understood her personality as the Devil Sect Master and was worried that she would anger the other party. As such, she said gently, “We sisters had a reason to hurry along on our journey. That was why we accidentally ended up trapped in this valley.” She was the daughter of a city lord and had the bearing of a distinguished daughter since her youth. This kind of situation wasn’t difficult for her to deal with at all.

“Sisters?” Yun Jianyue repeated, raising a brow. In the past, with how different their statuses were, Xie Daoyun wouldn’t have had the qualification to call her sister at all. After they had fought together in this blasted world for several days, however, their relationship had improved considerably. When she thought about how they didn’t know anything about these newcomers, she realized that being known as sisters would save them from quite a bit of unnecessary trouble.

“So that was what happened!” the pretty boy young master exclaimed, sighing in admiration. This woman was good-looking, intelligent, and her personality was gentle. How could one not like her? Comparatively, the more mature woman off to the side seemed to have more of a domineering gaze. She wasn’t his type.

He walked up to them and took out a yellow talisman. He muttered some incantations, and the yellow talisman flew into the air. Radiance erupted in the skies, and a giant figure gradually appeared. It was ferocious and intimidating, looking even more menacing than all of the surrounding evil spirits.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Yun Jianyue shivered. She quickly stood protectively in front of Xie Daoyun.

“The two ladies can feel at ease. This is a ghost general that I summoned. It won’t harm you two,” the young master said with a smile, then pointed casually with his hand.

The ghost suddenly reached out its large hands and grabbed at its surroundings. The ghosts that were around the two women fled in alarm when they saw that. Unfortunately, there were too many of them, and many of them were blocked by the ghosts behind them and couldn't escape. Thus, several dozen ghosts were caught in the ghost general’s hands; it fished them up and tossed them into its mouth. The air filled with the sounds of crunching bone and rending flesh.

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun both shivered when they heard that. Just what kind of being was that ghost general?

On the flying ship, several servants exchanged a look. They quietly spoke among themselves.

“Second young master is flirting with women again…”

“But women always love the things he does. If a confident and handsome young master swoops in from the skies and saves some beauties, how can they not be touched? Didn’t those maids all become the way they are because of that?”

The eight beautiful maids felt a bit sad when they saw that scene. They had also experienced similar things in the past. The young master treated them really well at first, and they thought that he was their ideal husband; but later, once the young master obtained them, he gradually stopped cherishing them. More and more women appeared at his side too, upon which they themselves could only fall to become maids…

The young master seemed to have sensed something and secretly glanced back. Those servants who were gossiping immediately shut their mouths. The slightly resentful maids regained their previous warm and gentle smiles.

The endless ghosts in the valley had already disappeared without a trace, clearly fearful of the giant ghost general in the sky. They all scattered who knew where.

“Beautiful ladies, it isn’t safe traveling in the outskirts at night. Why not join me on my flying boat and let me take you on a journey?” the young master said in a refined and courteous manner.

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun exchanged a look. They nodded and said, “Then we’ll be troubling the young master.”

“Please enter!” the young master said, turning to one side and making an inviting gesture. No flaws could be discerned from his movements.

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun got onto the flying boat and took the chance to secretly look around. In terms of appearance, the entire vessel wasn’t too different from a normal boat, albeit more streamlined in shape.

Their gazes both landed on the yellow runes on the bottom of the flying boat and the sides. It seemed that the vessel could fly because of those runes.

“We welcome the two misses!” several lovely voices called out. It turned out that the beautiful maids were greeting them.

“We greet the ladies,” Xie Daoyun hurriedly replied, while Yun Jianyue only nodded slightly.

The two couldn't help but look at the pretty-faced young master. They thought, This guy has so many pretty girls serving him all the time; just what kind of disgusting tendencies does he have? Their impression of him immediately plummeted.

The servants sneered inwardly, thinking, Hmph, you can act all arrogant now. You’ll be just like us soon. When the time comes, you’ll have to call us big sisters too!

“This humble one is Wang Neishi. May I ask what the two ladies are called?” the young master asked the two with a smile.

“I am Yun Chouxue,” Yun Jianyue replied first.[1]

Xie Daoyun was stunned, but she was quick and said, “I am Xie… Yan.”

Yun Jianyue looked at her with an ambiguous smile. She secretly asked through voice transmission, “The same Yan as Chuyan?”

Xie Daoyun’s face turned red and she ignored the message.

“So it was Miss Xie and Miss Yun. Please have the seat of honor in the cabin,” Wang Neishi invited them.

“I’m more interested in seeing how this boat is capable of flight,” Yun Jianyue said with a smile. “I’ve never seen a flying boat before.”

The maids revealed a look of disdain. You haven’t even seen flying boats before? Just where did these bumpkins come from?

“Haha, the lady seems to be quite frank in nature. Admirable as expected,” Wang Neishi said. He didn’t seem to mind, and instead made a gesture. The flying boat began to move soon after. The air around it stirred, and the entire ship’s body became light. Then, it gradually rose into the sky.

Xie Daoyun couldn't help but move to the edge of the flying boat and look at the yellow runes at the sides. She exclaimed, “Hm? These seem to be made from all kinds of formations, but I can’t see the corresponding rune patterns. Could it be that they’ve all gathered inside this yellow rune?”

“Does Miss Xie also understand the methods of using runes?” Wang Neishi asked in surprise.

“I only know a bit of humble knowledge. However, I can't understand the talisman the young master used earlier or this flying boat at all,” Xie Daoyun said in amazement. She thought to herself that she had believed she had some knowledge in the field of runes, and yet now, she was nothing more than a frog at the bottom of a well. She asked, “By the way, young master, why can’t I sense the power of ki stones? What does this flying boat use for its power source?”

Wang Neishi smiled and said, “There is no need to provide it with power. Our Wang clan’s runes can borrow the supernatural force of this world. What power source can compare to the power of the world?”

He had thought that this young lady was someone who was proficient in runes, and yet she had ended up not even knowing such basic knowledge. 

It seems she was just pretending to have some knowledge to try and impress this young master. Women… They are all just scheming beings like this.

But it’s fine. This young lady does match this young master’s preferences. I’ll just play along with your games for a bit.

“It doesn’t need a power source?” Xie Daoyun exclaimed, now feeling truly shocked. In her world, the formations all needed ki stones to provide power. The higher the level of the formation was, the higher the purity and grade of the necessary stones climbed. She hadn’t expected this world to not need ki stones at all.

Yun Jianyue had a pensive expression. Borrowing the power of the world? It seems a bit similar to our cultivation system.

This pretty boy’s cultivation isn’t all that, but the monster he summoned from the yellow talisman seems to be pretty strong.

They chatted for a while, but then Wang Neishi couldn't help but ask curiously, “Why are the two ladies in such a rush to move through the night?”

Xie Daoyun replied, “We wanted to reach the nearby Wang Port and ask the local lord a question…”

Wang Neishi was surprised and said with a smile, “What a coincidence; I came from Wang Port, and the lord is my father. I wonder what the two ladies need from my father?”
