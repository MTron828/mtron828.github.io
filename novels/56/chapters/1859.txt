Chapter 1808: A Melon to Eat (Teaser)

Almost every man in the world would say that the more women they had, the better. There was only one situation in which they wouldn’t hope for such a thing, which was when their women met each other.

Even though the women never said anything, just the looks that were being exchanged contained countless vicious battles.

“Master!” Qiu Honglei suddenly shouted, breaking the awkwardness. Even though she wasn’t too happy that Xie Daoyun was here, seeing her own master was still a heartwarming experience.

Even though her master was powerful in theory, so Qiu Honglei didn’t have to worry too much about her safety, this secret dungeon’s world was a bit too strange. All sorts of monsters had appeared one after another. This world was so large too, so she had been worried that her master wouldn’t be able to return or something.

When she heard her disciple call out to her, a smile appeared on Yun Jianyue’s face. She thought, As expected of the disciple I raised myself. She’s much better than these other gaudy-looking things.

Sun En was a bit surprised, asking, “You actually knew each other? Then that makes things much easier.”

Zu An and the others looked at him in confusion. Who was this person?

Yun Jianyue was worried that they would end up creating unnecessary trouble because they didn’t know the situation, so she quickly said, “This is Divine Firmament Sect Master Sun. His strength is at the very peak of this world, and he isn’t weaker than Zhao Han.”

Zu An immediately understood. Back then, Jing Teng had mentioned that one of her enemies in this world was none other than Sun En. This was someone else who was at the top of the whole world. He hadn’t expected to meet Sun En in such a situation. He looked around, and guessed that Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun were both in Sun En’s custody at the moment.

Another voice said just then, “There was an immortal’s aura here. The sect master wishes to know what happened here.”

When he saw the elder next to Sun En, Zu An frowned and asked, “And who are you?”

The elder said proudly, “I am the master of the Wang clan, Wang Youjun.”

The Wang clan didn’t need any introduction. As soon as the Wang clan was mentioned in this world, everyone would know who was being talked about. Thus, after introducing himself, Wang Youjun paused to wait for the expected sighs of admiration.

However, he didn’t hear anything even after a long time passed. Instead, the group looked at each other in dismay.

“Have you heard of them?”

“No, I don’t think they’re all that famous.”

…

They weren’t lying. They were from a different world and didn’t know much about this one, and the ones they had been watching out for were people like the Ghost King, Sun En, and Zang Ao. Even though the Wang clan was formidable, they still couldn't be discussed on the same level as those three.

But who would have thought that their reaction would completely infuriate Wang Youjun? 

If the sect master weren’t here, I would already have taught you all a good lesson!

He was used to being in a high position, so the time he spent under Sun En had already left him feeling really suffocated. He had been trying to show off a bit in front of this group, but who could have expected the result?

You have successfully trolled Wang Youjun for +444 +444 +444…

Sun En stopped him from acting rashly and looked at Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun, saying, “Since they are your friends, I’ll leave it to the two of you so that we don’t sour the mood.”

The two women shivered. Even though he spoke courteously, there was clearly an implied threat behind the words.

As such, Xie Daoyun asked, “Big brother Zu, can you tell Sect Master Sun what happened just now? Where did the immortal go?” She figured keeping that information a secret wasn’t too important. However, if they angered Sun En, big brother Zu would be in danger.

Zu An was about to reply when he heard her gentle request, but Jing Teng suddenly said, “You’re not allowed to tell him!”

Zu An was stunned. He felt a bit troubled, as he would be in trouble whether he said it or not.

Sigh… Women really are difficult when you have too many of them.

Hm? Wait, Miss Jing and I don’t have any special relationship. What am I feeling guilty for?

Xie Daoyun was stunned. When she saw Jing Teng’s appearance, she wondered who this woman was. She was so pretty, and could even make a request of her big brother Zu in such a confident manner! The woman’s relationship with big brother Zu was clearly special.  When she thought about how even she herself didn’t dare to order Zu An around, she couldn't help but feel a bit jealous.

Yun Jianyue also narrowed her eyes and looked at Jing Teng, thinking, When did Zu An pick up another vixen? Why don’t I recognize her at all?

The stone cold woman’s disciple and the big-boobed woman are both here, so how could they allow him to fondle the flowers and trample the grass like this?

On top of that, Honglei is here too. Are these women all good-for-nothings?

“Sect master, allow this subordinate to teach these ignorant people a lesson,” Wang Youjun, who was still furious about what had happened previously, said.

However, who could have expected that Sun En would stop him? Sun En had a complicated expression when he looked at the young lady, saying,“So it was Miss Jing. It has been several decades since we last met, yet the lady is still just as graceful as ever.”

The others were all shocked when they heard those words. Wang Youjun hadn’t expected this young lady to actually be an acquaintance of the sect master! No matter how resentful he was, he still didn’t dare to protest.

Qiu Honglei and Zu An, who knew the truth, were one thing, but Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman looked at Jing Teng in shock. They had never expected this dainty-looking woman to have already met Sun En decades ago.

Are Ah Zu’s tastes really that strange now? He likes women who are that old?

Yun Jianyue had originally been full of hostility toward Jing Teng, but then started viewing her in a new light when she heard that.

Hm? She’s actually the same age as me, then? Maybe I should even find a chance to ask her a bit about her beauty routine. She still looks like a young lady despite being older.

Even though Yun Jianyue was incredibly beautiful, she had her fair share of both experience and age. It was impossible to hide her mature, elegant grace. Whenever someone saw her, they would only think of her as a strong, mature woman, and definitely not a young lady.

Jing Teng replied with a snort, “Isn’t that all thanks to this sect master?!”

Sun En smiled and didn’t get angry, saying, “Different people make different choices. This one merely did what I had to do in the past, and in the end, everything that happened was due to that heartless person’s love crumbling in the face of the slightest trial. What, then, does that have to do with me?”

Suddenly, a voice said with a sigh, “Sect master Sun is really downplaying the truth and pushing all of the blame onto this humble one. In the past, if not for your provocation, why would I have made such a great mistake?”

Afterward, a middle-aged man with an impressive presence walked in. Four attendants followed behind him, each one powerful and domineering in appearance. They were clearly all strong cultivators.

“Zang Ao!” Qiu Honglei exclaimed, recognizing the person. They had met previously at Jing Teng’s old home.

Meanwhile, Zu An was paying close attention to the people behind Zang Ao, hoping to see a certain familiar white figure. However, he felt his heart sink in disappointment as he thought, Where is Yan Xuehen?Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Previously, she had said that she would look into just who had issued that highest-level bounty in the Adventurer’s Guild, because it seemed really suspicious. Why didn’t he see her at all? Could it be that something had happened to her?

Sun En looked coldly at Zang Ao, saying, “Mister Zang, you came at just the right time. You really screwed me over quite badly back then.”

Zang Ao looked quite confused as he replied, “If we’re really talking about screwing over anyone, it was clearly you who harmed me. I haven’t even spoken of my own grievances yet.”

Sun En said with a sneer, “Mister Zang, please don’t try to play innocent. How could I have failed my tribulation if not for the trap you set up in the past? If I hadn’t been careful and made some preparations of my own, I might already have been burnt to ash.”

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun exchanged a look, thinking, No wonder Sun En ‘died’ on that island, and he was only revived after the Wang clan’s ship arrived.

Zu An’s group started to think about the implications behind the tribulation Sun En had spoken of. Could it be that this person was already just a step away from immortal ascension?

Zang Ao shook his head and said, “I don’t understand what you’re saying. I believe there must be some misunderstanding here.”

Sun En sneered and didn’t say anything else. Inwardly, however, he was weighing whether to get revenge first, or to find out information about that immortal first.

Just then, Jing Teng didn’t hold back at all, and enthusiastically took Zu An’s arm into her impressive bosom. Chu Chuyan, Pei Mianman, Yun Jianyue, and Xie Daoyun’s eyes all widened.

How can this woman be that shameless? Did she and Ah Zu really have a relationship?

You have successfully trolled Chu Chuyan for +233 +233 +233…

You have successfully trolled Pei Mianman for +233 +233 +233…

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +233 +233 +233…

You have successfully trolled Xie Daoyun for +233 +233 +233…

Qiu Honglei almost laughed out loud. Perhaps she would have imploded from anger if she hadn’t seen the same thing before. However, such a ‘joyous happening’ naturally had to be shared with these wonderful sisters of hers.

Hmph, I had to watch you all assault my man right in front of me… Now, you all can properly experience what I had to go through.

But why do I feel as if my master is also a bit angry?

Zu An felt his scalp turn numb. He reflexively wanted to pull back his hand, but Jing Teng firmly held it in place. She even used the chance to nestle her soft body against his like a little bird. He knew that this was the moment when she needed protection the most, so in the end, he sighed and tacitly allowed it.

Sun En’s previously stern expression turned strange. He ordered Wang Youjun, “Little Wang, why don’t you take out that melon we bought earlier and give each person a slice?”
