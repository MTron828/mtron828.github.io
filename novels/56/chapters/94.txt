Chapter 95: Sunflower Phantasm

Translator: Pika

While the Heiress’ Ball of Delights or the Knock-You-Up Eyes had names and descriptions that sounded utterly horrendous, they were items that could bring forth incredible effects in desperate moments if used well.

However, Zu An couldn’t think of even a single practical use for this skill.

All it did was make the other party reply ‘I’m staring at you, shithead’. Could there be anything more useless than this?

A sudden thought surfaced in Zu An’s mind. Could it be a taunt skill to earn the enemy’s Rage points?

However, he soon dismissed that line of thought. Even if it hadn’t been turned into an official skill, just saying the words ‘Whatcha starin’ at?’ was more than enough to provoke most people.

One thing that surprised him was that this skill didn’t have a limit to its use, unlike the other artifacts and skills he had received.

Although this assuaged Zu An’s heart a little, it didn’t change the fact that this skill was much less useful than the previous few. He didn’t know whether to celebrate or weep in sorrow.

With a deep sigh, he continued to draw the lottery. He didn’t get anything else new after that—they were all either ‘Thanks for playing’ or Ki Fruits. This outcome was well within his expectations. After all, it was nearly impossible for him to be lucky enough to draw two skills or artifacts in a single sitting.

So far, his third formation was one-third full, and devouring all of the Ki Fruits he had drawn was enough to fill it up fully. Based on the amount of ki he had currently, he was confident that he could summon Grandgale twice now. Previously, summoning it just once would sap him dry.

It looks like my ki capacity is indeed increasing along with my growth.

Zu An wondered if he would really unlock a new skill once the nine formations in his muscles were fully filled. Grandgale was a truly formidable skill, yet it was only the first one. Surely the skills that came after it would be even more powerful.

However, just thinking about the astronomical amount of Rage points he would require to raise his cultivation level was enough to leave him shaking his head helplessly. Forget it, I shouldn’t think about all this now. For the time being, I should focus on preparing for the battle two days from now!

With his current ability, he was pretty confident that he would be able to protect himself against Yuan Wendong in the dueling ring. However, from what Jiang Luofu had said, cultivators would grow exponentially stronger the higher their rank. Since strong cultivators had the ability to secure cultivation resources for themselves, this let them grow faster than the others below them. Therefore, it was unwise for him to simply keep hiding his abilities.

Zu An also belatedly realized the significance of being a member of the Chu clan. He was sitting on such a huge ship right now; it would be a huge waste if he didn’t take full advantage. At the very least, he was determined to make the other members of the Chu clan acknowledge him.

While he did grumble about his wife’s and in-laws’ cold attitude towards him, deep down, he was aware that their prejudice toward him was justified. He had indeed been a good-for-nothing before. Had he been in their position, he would have surely scorned himself too.

In fact, putting aside Chu Huanzhao, both Chu Chuyan and Chu Zhongtian actually treated him fairly well despite harboring the notion that he was a good-for-nothing. It was only Qin Wanru who berated him constantly, even punishing him by making him copy the family rules.

Hmph, I should have given your dudou to that pervert Ji Dengtu...

Jiang Luofu’s advice made him realize that it was time for him to demonstrate his capability before the Chu clan. At the very least, he had to let them know that he was an asset to the Chu clan. When that happened, perhaps even Chu Chuyan would willingly fawn all over him...

Just thinking about it made Zu An giggle under his breath. Saliva dribbled out of the corner of his lips.

Unfortunately, he didn’t think he was strong enough to defeat Yuan Wendong yet. After all, Yuan Wendong was a fifth rank cultivator, and his ability to control multiple weapons simultaneously in battle made him seem almost like those swordmasters in fantasy novels. Pei Mianman was able to melt his weapons with ease, but if he were to be placed in her position, the most likely outcome was him ending up being punctured full of holes.

Also, he didn’t want to showcase all of his trump cards in a public dueling ring. He did want to prove his worth, but giving away all of his techniques was nothing short of foolishness. It would give his enemies the vital intelligence required to deal with him.

That’s why people in my previous life preach about the importance of humility, and keeping a low profile. A wise man would rather silently strike it rich than parade his wealth around. Those who stick out too much would only incur the envy of others and eventually be destroyed.

He spent a long time deep in thought, and decided to turn his attention toward the Thirteen Forms of Elementary Swordplay Bai Susu had imparted to them earlier in the day. This swordplay might be of limited use to ordinary folk, but its nature fitted him like a glove. If he could defeat Yuan Wendong with this swordplay, he would be able to prove his own worth without giving away his trump cards.

This thought made him quiver with excitement. He picked up the sword he received from the academy and began practicing the moves. Somehow, he was able to clearly remember the movements Bai Susu had demonstrated. He could almost see himself back in the classroom, with the moves playing out in front of him. Perhaps this was an effect of his transcendent-class aptitude.

His movements started off a little awkward, but after several repetitions, they began to flow much more smoothly.

An eerie voice cut through the silence of the night. “Oh? I didn’t expect your talent to be so high. You were actually able to grasp the academy’s Elementary Swordplay so quickly. All you’re lacking now is practice.”

Zu An recoiled in shock. He spun around, only to see a scrawny, hunched-over figure standing in the garden not too far away. Who else could it be if not Old Mi?

“When did you arrive?” asked Zu An with an innocent smile. On the inside, however, he warned himself to be more careful. If Old Mi were to discover the trump cards he had, he might just get screwed over.

“I’ve been here for some time now,” replied Old Mi. “I heard that you’re likely going to be up against Yuan Wendong in the Clans Tournament?”

“Yeah, it seems so,” replied Zu An helplessly. What could he do when the Chu clan wanted to use him as the ‘inferior horse’ to tie down the ‘superior horse’?

Old Mi stroked his beard as he stared at Zu An intently. “You’re intending to use the Elementary Swordplay to deal with Yuan Wendong?”

Zu An felt his goosebumps rising up under Old Mi’s sinister gaze. “Yeah, I don’t know any combat skills other than this.”

“The Elementary Swordplay is the basic swordplay imparted to everyone in the academy. No doubt Yuan Wendong has learned it as well. I heard that he’s a fifth rank cultivator. Aren’t you courting death by attempting to challenge him with the Elementary Swordplay?” Old Mi scoffed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“But the teachers of the academy said that this swordplay isn’t as bad as its name makes it out to be. It’s the foundation of all swordplay, and even true swordmasters who have reached a certain point eventually return to it...” Zu An’s weak protest buckled under Old Mi’s glare.

“You actually believe the nonsense the teachers of the academy spout in order to spur their students’ motivation?” Old Mi looked at Zu An as if he was an idiot. “You’re not wrong to say that cultivators, upon reaching a certain level, would return to the basics, but it only works because they have developed the overwhelming speed and strength needed to crush their enemies. A newbie like you using this swordplay to deal with an expert... you’re really asking for a good walloping!”

Zu An offered up a sheepish smile. “Well, my match is scheduled at the very end. I probably wouldn’t have to get into the dueling ring in the first place.”

Old Mi fell silent for a while, then said suddenly, “I heard that you have a grudge against Yuan Wendong?”

Zu An was surprised. The old gardener was always puttering about the Chu clan estate, yet he seemed to know everything that was going on outside. “Ah... We did get into a small scuffle in the academy.”

“A small scuffle?” Old Mi snorted. “I heard that Yuan Wendong declared that he’d cripple you.”

“Well, he had some strong grievances against me. He might have just been spouting empty threats in a fit of anger,” replied Zu An.

“You had someone there to fish you out the last time, but who would be able to save you in the dueling ring two days from now?” Old Mi rolled his eyes, which gave his already-terrifying face an even more frightening aspect. “I heard that the First Miss wanted you to provoke Yuan Wendong again tomorrow?”

“Y-yeah...” Zu An felt a shiver run down his spine. This matter had only been shared among the few of them at the dining table earlier. How in the world did Old Mi learn about it too? Could he possibly know about the Keyboard as well?

Old Mi stomped his feet in anger. “Preposterous! Even if the First Miss doesn’t like you, she shouldn’t toss you into the fiery pit just like that!”

His outburst heartened Zu An. “Elder, please don’t worry. My wife is just resorting to the strategy of using the weakest horse to tie down the strongest one. I’m the one going up last, so there’s a good chance that I won’t need to fight at all.”

Old Mi shook his head. “It’s different this time. The Yuan clan came prepared. There’s a high probability that you would have to fight as well. I’ll impart a movement skill to you. Hopefully, you’ll at least be able to protect yourself in the dueling ring.”

Zu An was shocked into a moment of silence, before he suddenly cried out, “Elder, you treat me too well!” To think that he had actually doubted Old Mi’s kind intentions all this while!

Old Mi replied with a smile, “I don’t hope for much in this life; I just hope that you can fulfill my regrets. I can’t have you losing an arm or a leg.”

You must be joking. It wasn’t easy for me to find someone suitable. How could I let that brat, Yuan Wendong, leave any scars on your body?!

Zu An had no inkling of Old Mi’s sinister intentions, so he was utterly moved by the old gardener’s gesture. So few people had treated him kindly ever since he came to this world, and Old Mi was, without a doubt, one of them.

Old Mi cleared his throat and said, “This movement skill is called ‘Sunflower Phantasm’. It doesn’t require much ki to activate, but its effects are top-notch. Those who are talented only need half a year in order to reach a level of minor accomplishment. We’re short of time, but considering that your opponent is Yuan Wendong, it should be enough.”

Zu An was a little perplexed. “That doesn’t make sense. If the movement skill is top-notch, shouldn’t its activation require a large amount of ki?”

Old Mi chuckled. “Don’t worry, I’m not trying to trick you. While this movement skill requires very little ki to execute, most people face a huge hurdle that they are unable to overcome. But as for you...”

At this point, Old Mi glanced meaningfully at Zu An’s crotch and continued, “The hurdle is nonexistent for you!”

Zu An blinked his eyes in bewilderment. What does that mean?

Old Mi coughed lightly and said, “Gather your focus. I’m going to impart to you Sunflower Phantasm’s formula, ki pathways, and crux to you. Listen carefully...”

Roughly two hours later, Zu An began moving, flitting from left to right, again and again, leaving Old Mi utterly giddy. It took him a while to find his voice. “Did you actually know the Sunflower Phantasm beforehand?”

Zu An shook his head and replied, “Of course not.”

“Then how did you manage to grasp it so quickly? You’re already at the level of minor accomplishment!” Old Mi exclaimed.

“I guess I’m just talented?” Zu An offered shyly.
