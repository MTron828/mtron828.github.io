Chapter 79: Honorary Teacher

Translator: Pika

Chu Huanzhao was elated by the disappointed reactions of the two men. “Her fiancé is none other than Sang Qian, the man you met last night. Sang Qian’s father is obviously coming after our Chu clan, and the Zheng clan has quite a few business-related conflicts with us here in Brightmoon City. Zheng Dan surely has an ulterior motive in mind in approaching you. Only perverts like you would fall for her honey trap!”

Sang Qian’s fiancé? Zu An fell deep into thought as he recalled the arrogant young commander from the casino.

...

The ornate carriage of the Zheng clan sat in a remote alley. The panic on the coach master’s face had long since vanished. His voice was calm and composed. “Young miss, did you manage to obtain the debt note?”

Zheng Dan shook her head. “It wasn’t on him. It seems we’ll have to try a bit harder.”

When Zu An had caught her earlier, she had snuck her hands into his pockets and searched them. Unfortunately, she hadn’t found anything.

“That wastrel must have used up a lifetime’s worth of good fortune for a chance to touch our young miss’ body with his unworthy hands!” the coach master spat in a huff.

Zheng Dan smiled faintly. “It’s fine. I was fully-clothed, and he hadn’t dared to let his hands wander about. I suffered no outrage.”

The coach was relieved. “Young miss, I’ve been by your side since you were young. I can’t bear to see anyone taking advantage of you. Speaking of taking advantage, that Sang fellow sure is ridiculous. How in the world could a man possibly think of having his fiancée lay a honey trap for another man?”

Zheng Dan brushed the matter aside. “Uncle Yue, calm down. First and foremost, my engagement with Sang Qian is a political marriage, a relationship built on mutual profit. It’s inevitable that there would be some give and take."

The coach master named Uncle Yue sighed deeply. “Young miss, you’ve suffered much for the Zheng clan.”

“It’s for myself too,” Zheng Dan replied with a smile. “Anyway, I won’t really let Zu An take advantage of me. Besides, the earlier encounter with him has made this matter even more interesting.”

...

Chu Huanzhao continued to assault Zu An’s ears with her ranting, and the torture only came to an end when they arrived at the academy. Chu Huanzhao headed straight toward her classroom, but Zu An headed for the administrative building and the office of the beautiful principal.

He knocked on the door. “You may enter,” Jiang Luofu’s captivating voice came in response.

Zu An pushed the heavy door open and walked in. There were many interesting objects inside the office, but it was still Jiang Luofu herself who stood out the most.

Under the rays of the morning sun, her skin looked fair like snow. Her eyes were deep and enchanting, her nose was sharp and lofty, and her bright red lips looked ever so inviting. She was the perfect blend of imposing and seductive, two seemingly opposite characteristics somehow working in perfect harmony.

Her long, lustrous hair, put up in a perfect bun with a golden hairpin, was just begging to be let loose. Her cascading long hair would feel smoother than silk flowing through Zu An’s fingers.

It was only out of fear that he dared not make a move.

“What a coincidence, I was just about to look for you.” Jiang Luofu was mildly surprised by Zu An’s visit. She gently waved her hand, and a light breeze blew across his face. The heavy door behind him closed smoothly.

“Principal, you have something for me?” Zu An wasn’t so narcissistic to think that Jiang Luofu had somehow fallen for his good looks.

“You’re acquainted with Shang Liuyu?” Jiang Luofu arched an eyebrow at Zu An as she fiddled with a hairpin that was the twin of the one holding her hair in place.

“Shang Liuyu?” Zu An shook his head. “I don’t know her.”

His thoughts began to race. Could it be that Ji Dengtu’s request to have him steal Shang Liuyu’s dudou had been exposed? Probably not. I haven’t even met her before!

“You don’t know third place Shang Liuyu of the Sweetheart Ranking?” Jiang Luofu’s eyes narrowed skeptically.

“I mean, I have heard of her name, but I’ve never met her in person.”

Zu An was oddly reminded of Wei Suo’s starry-eyed excitement over Jiang Luofu, and his gaze slowly drifted down to take in the beautiful principal’s legs.

Hmm, they do look as smooth as jade. Oh, nude stockings today? Wow, they look good on her.

Jiang Luofu swifty noticed his crude stare, and her eyes narrowed in displeasure.

Zu An gave a frightened start, and he quickly added, “I think that those are nothing more than empty rumors. How can that Shang-something possibly be more beautiful than you? With those legs you have, there’s no way she could hold a candle to you!”

Zu An’s extremely earnest tone drew an amused chuckle from Jiang Luofu. “I’ve received countless compliments from others in the past, but you’re the first one to dive into such elaborate detail.”

Spurred on by her playful tone, Zu An straightened his back and doubled down, “Of course, it’s a sincere thought from the bottom of my heart!”

“Shang Liuyu will be upset to hear your words,” Jiang Luofu replied with a teasing smile. “Don’t you think it’s ungrateful of you to talk badly of her behind her back?”

“Ungrateful?” Zu An was confused. I don’t even know this person, so how could I possibly be ungrateful to her?

Jiang Luofu took out a book from her drawer and began flipping through it. “Didn’t I tell you not to reveal the fact that you possess transcendent-class aptitude? You mentioned the aptitude test you had at the school entrance, and I said I would deal with the relevant records. However, someone else had already dealt with them before me. I did a little digging, and it was Shang Liuyu.”

She stared at Zu An intently for a moment before asking once more, “Are you certain that you aren’t acquainted?”

“Hmm... Could my charm have reached such a level where I unknowingly made a woman fall head over heels for me?” Zu An lightly caressed his face as he remarked with astonishment.

Jiang Luofu didn’t know whether to roll her eyes or laugh.

Wow. This guy’s skin must be as thick as the city walls.

“If you don’t know her, then forget I ever asked.” Jiang Luofu cleared her throat. “You were looking for me?”

Zu An walked over and casually pulled himself a stool. He sat down opposite her. “Yes, I was. I want to become an honorary teacher at the academy.”

Amused by what she had just heard, Jiang Luofu crossed her legs subconsciously. “Are you insane, or am I out of my mind? Did you just say that you wish to be a teacher at our academy?”

“That’s right!” Zu An nodded vigorously.

Now that he was closer to Jiang Luofu, he was able to truly savor her beauty. Her ample breasts led down to a slim waist in a perfect curve that excited his visual senses. Just staring at her like this would likely make his nose bleed.

Jiang Luofu scoffed at his request. “Don’t you know the requirements to become a teacher in our academy? If you wish to teach cultivation-related subjects, you need to be of the sixth rank or above. A teacher of literary subjects can be of a lower rank, but these staff we employ are all officials from the royal court who are skilled in their respective fields, be it laws, rites, or social affairs. May I ask if you’re a sixth rank cultivator or an official of the royal court?”

“Of course I know all that, but I’m not planning to apply the proper way. I’m hoping that it’s possible for me to become an honorary teacher or something by sponsoring the academy,” replied Zu An sheepishly.

Most institutions in his previous life had such a ‘hidden clause’. A tycoon sponsoring a school would be able to get a building named after him, and his children would get preferential treatment when it came to enrolment. If the donor had a high standing in society, he might even be conferred the title of an honorary professor.

“Sponsor?” Jiang Luofu blinked her eyes in surprise. She had never heard of something like this before, but it did sound like a worthwhile option to discuss. After a moment, however, she shook her head. “Tsk, you’re just a drafted son-in-law of the Chu clan. How much money could you possibly have?”

“Is seven-and-a-half million silver taels enough for you?” replied Zu An.

The promissory note he held was utterly useless if it remained in his hands. He didn’t have the ability to cash out the money, and it was more than likely to bring him more trouble in the future. Most of all, holding on to it nullified his greatest trump card, the Heiress’ Ball of Delights!

That was equivalent to losing a life!

Money was wonderful, but survival came first.

After careful contemplation, he had decided to donate the money, but where and how to donate the money were questions worth pondering. It was best if he could get tangible benefits out of it.

“Seven-and-a-half million silver taels?” Jiang Luofu’s eyes widened in shock. Even by her standards, this was a ridiculous amount of money. “Where did you manage to get so much money?”

Sensing Jiang Luofu’s doubts, Zu An quickly shared the encounter he’d had at the Silverhook Casino with her. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“How did you manage to do it?” exclaimed Jiang Luofu.

She had never been too bothered with the affairs in Brightmoon City, which was why she was only hearing about this major incident now.

“I was lucky, I’d say,” replied Zu An shyly.

It wasn’t technically a lie, since he had used the Fortune Pill to boost his luck.

“If you aren’t willing to speak the truth, then no matter. Well, well, well, you’re really piquing my interest here.” Jiang Luofu leaned forward slightly to reassess Zu An. “Everyone says that the First Miss of the Chu clan has married a useless husband, but why does it seem like there’s more than meets the eye? You sure are hiding many secrets, be it your transcendent class aptitude, your cultivation; even a trip over to the Silverhook Casino easily scored you seven-and-a-half million silver taels from Mei Chaofeng!”

Zu An cowered slightly at Jiang Luofu’s sudden approach. His gaze was filled with a snowy valley that was so enticing, he was afraid that he would inadvertently make a move to offend the beautiful principal.

Attraction usually starts from interest. After careful contemplation, Zu An felt that informing her of her immodesty was the best choice. “Your skin is peeking through your clothes.”

Jiang Luofu lowered her gaze to her own attire, and the edges of her lips inched upward. “You’re not like any other men. I don’t mind showing myself off if it’s you.”

Zu An was taken aback. “Really?”

Dammit, I should have taken my own sweet time looking! Could I actually be a lady killer? How could I have won goodwill from Jiang Luofu and the legendary Shang Liuyu so easily, otherwise?

“Of course. You aren’t a real man in my eyes; more like a fellow sister, I’d say.” Jiang Luofu waved her hand dismissively.

Zu An had expected her to say ‘little brother’, but being viewed as a ‘fellow sister’ was not a remark that he could tolerate. “Principal, what do you mean by that?”

Jiang Luofu chuckled softly at Zu An’s livid expression. “Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone about it.”

The sympathetic gaze directed at his crotch was more than enough for Zu An. In that instant, he felt a tremendous urge to smash his head against the wall and end his pitiful life right there.

What the hell is going on? Why are more and more people finding out about it?!
