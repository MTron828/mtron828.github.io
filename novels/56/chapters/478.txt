Chapter 478: The Most Intimate of Strangers

Translator: Pika

Ao Quan froze. “What did I forget?”

“You forgot that I’m still here.” Zu An sighed.

Ao Quan roared with laughter. “It’s precisely because you’re around that this woman can’t defeat me! Given her cultivation, she can choose to fight or leave at will. Unfortunately, it seems she is going to give up her life for the sake of protecting your sorry ass.”

“Please stop trying to ruin our relationship. We love each other in sickness and in health. How could an old and impotent dragon who can’t get it up ever understand such a thing?” Zu An said with a snort.

Yun Yuqing’s face became hot. This guy really let his mouth run wherever it wanted to go! Can this thing we share even be considered love? I’m someone else’s wife!

Then again, she didn’t really know what she was really feeling either. She only knew that she had rushed over the moment she heard that he was in danger.

“Can’t get it up?!” Ao Quan’s eyes went red when he heard this. He howled in anger, “I won’t kill you immediately when I get my hands on you. Instead, I will tear your manhood apart piece by piece while you’re still alive! We’ll see how long you can maintain your cockiness!”

You have successfully trolled Ao Quan for 1024 Rage points!

These Rage points weren’t a result of the Fragrant Barf skill. Rather, Ao Quan himself was legitimately furious with Zu An.

“I’m actually worried for you. Your mind might become permanently scarred if you catch a glimpse of mine.” Zu An said as he searched for a weakness in his opponent. Even though Ao Quan’s body had been constrained by the Demonic Eye, he wasn’t completely immobilized. It was just that his movements had become extremely sluggish.

Yun Yuqing’s heart was pounding. She clearly knew where this man got his confidence from—she had experienced it personally! The shock she had felt back then was still fresh in her memory.

But this is a real dragon! He is a hundred zhang in length. Why would he be scared of you?

For some strange reason, however, Ao Quan seemed completely infuriated! His body twitched and wriggled, trying to break free from the Demonic Eye’s influence. “I want to kill you! I want to kill you!” he cried out continuously.

You have successfully trolled Ao Quan for 999... 999... 999...

Yun Yuqing felt the pressure mounting, and was afraid that she might lose control at any second. She quickly said, “Stop provoking him! I’m...”

Before she could finish, Zu An’s eyes lit up. “Now!”

As soon as he said this, he leapt forward, leaving behind a streak of afterimages as he attacked his opponent’s claw.

Ao Quan immediately realized what he was trying to do. He roared with laughter. “What are you trying to do? Are you trying to injure me with your pitiful, ant-like cultivation?

“No, someone your size will only reach my knees no matter how high you jump! What can you do to harm me?”

Zu An’s trash talk had hurt his ego. He wanted a chance to fire back, and he had finally been granted one.

Letting it all out felt awfully good!

Zu An snorted coldly, and a pitch-black dagger suddenly appeared in his hands.

Ao Quan burst out laughing when he saw this. A dagger that small was like a toothpick compared to its massive body. It wouldn’t do anything, no matter how much it prodded him.

This overconfidence was precisely what Zu An was counting on. Seeing that the dragon was making no move to avoid it, he thrust it straight into his claw.

He had learned from his previous encounter, and didn’t try to stab it through the dragon’s thick scales. Instead, he carefully aimed for a joint between two scales, and thrust the dagger into the flesh beneath.

Ao Quan felt a slight stinging sensation spread outwards from his toe. He was surprised by the sharpness of the dagger. After all, dragons did not only possess famously tough scales—even their hide was too thick for an ordinary weapon to penetrate.

He dismissed the matter. Instead, he let out a hearty laugh and said, “Is that all? That’s it? Huh...?” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

His smile froze, and he was overcome by a feeling of extreme fear. His body was covered in cryptic and profound-looking black runes. Not even he, with all of his knowledge and experience, could decipher them.

“How is this possible?!”

That was his last thought, before his mind was overwhelmed by darkness. His massive body fell out of the sky, crashing into the ground in a cloud of dust.

“Keep showing off!” Zu An put away the Poisonous Prick then spat on the old dragon’s corpse.

He hadn’t expected to obtain two dragon corpses in quick succession! Even a single dragon’s body was a treasure in itself. I’ll have to study them properly later...

He let his imagination run wild as he placed the massive dragon corpse into the Brilliant Glass Bead.

One moment, Yun Yuqing had been struggling to control that massive dragon, and yet, in the next instant, it had unexpectedly breathed its last. This sudden twist left her completely stunned.

Zu An ran over to her side and waved his hand in front of her eyes. “So, what do you think? Your man is formidable, isn’t he?”

“Yeah...” Yun Yuqing nodded instinctively, but quickly realized what had happened. “You’re not my man.”

Zu An laughed. This woman was willing to sleep with him and bear his child, yet she still quibbled over these small details.

“Right, how are your injuries? I have some medicine on me.” Zu An’s voice was full of concern. After all, she had suffered the full brunt of Ao Quan’s tail strike earlier.

“It’s no big deal.” Yun Yuqing shook her head. Given her level of cultivation, she would be fine after some rest. Something else was on her mind. “How did you do that?”

That dragon’s strength was far above her own. If he had been able to use Dragon Soulspeak, not even a master rank cultivator would have been able to do anything. However, he had been dealt with so easily by Zu An.

“My weapon is a little peculiar. It can kill as long as it draws blood,” explained Zu An. She had already seen what had happened, so there was no way he could hide it from her. It seemed better just to tell her the truth.

“Such a miraculous weapon actually exists?” Yun Yuqing was taken aback. That was a giant dragon, but it died with just a little poke from that weapon. Is it coated in some poison? But what kind of poison could be that strong? “Right, do you have a spatial artifact on you?”

Zu An nodded. “Yup. I put that massive dragon’s corpse inside it.”

“There’s actually a spatial artifact with that much storage space in this world?” Yun Yuqing shook, and she grew unsteady. Her brain was just about to give up on her. Too many inconceivable things had happened this day, and every single one of them seemed impossible to process.

Zu An chuckled. He reached out an arm and wrapped it around her supple waist. “So, what do you think? Now you know how amazing I am, right?”

Yun Yuqing blushed, although it was unclear whether he had read her mind or not. She snorted and said, “Don’t you know that wealth should be hidden away? You have so many amazing items on you. Aren’t you scared that I’d kill you and steal everything?”

Zu An put on a scared expression. “Are you trying to steal my money or my body? I don’t care if you steal my wealth, but if you want my body, please at least let me take the lead...”

“Hmph!” Yun Yuqing’s heart began to pound like crazy. “You’re always like this, not a shred of decency at all,” she spat.

Zu An laughed and wrapped his arms around her again. This woman’s body was fragrant and supple. She felt really comfortable in his arms. “Right, why are you here? I thought that I wouldn’t be able to see you again for a long time.”

Yun Yuqing released a long sigh. “I inadvertently learned that King Wu had arranged for some men to kill you... This all came about because of me, so I couldn’t bear to see something happen to you. That’s why I came to take a look.”

Zu An stared at her blankly. He wasn’t surprised at all to find out that King Wu wanted him dead because of what had happened that night. Whether it was King Wu’s way of venting his frustrations, or an attempt to silence him, there was no way he would allow him to survive.

But Yun Yuqing had rushed all the way here just to prevent that from happening! That was completely unexpected.

After all, the two of them could only be described as the most intimate of strangers.

They hadn’t spent that much time together, and they held very different levels of status in society. Ordinarily speaking, there should have been no way for them to cross paths.

“Why are you looking at me like that?” Yun Yuqing shifted her gaze away bashfully. “Don’t think too much into it. I didn’t... I didn’t come for your sake. I just didn’t want to see you get into trouble because of me.”

Zu An smiled and remained silent. He gently undid the veil on her face, and lifted her chin to kiss her.
