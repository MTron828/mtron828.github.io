Chapter 1420: Three Times Stronger than Yi

The translucent figure was briefly stunned. It said, “That was probably because of the Weak Water. Immortal medicines are well known for their prowess, so how could they produce such a side effect?”

The others had strange expressions. Hadn’t this guy just said that he became muddle-headed after he ate the immortal medicine, and that was why he fell into the Weak Water? As for whether he became a monster because of the immortal medicine or the Weak Water, however, it was hard to say.

“Was the immortal medicine you ate from the Queen Mother of the West?” Yun Jianyue quickly asked. That was the very item Shun had used to entice them. If there was something wrong with it, didn’t it mean Shun had ulterior motives?

The figure shook its head and replied, “That, I do not know. I was already dead at the time, and it was an immortal medicine bestowed by the Celestial Emperor. I do not know if it came from the Queen Mother of the West.”

“If you were already dead back then, how did you know that it was the Celestial Emperor’s immortal medicine that saved you?” Yan Xuehen asked, keenly sensing an issue.

“I…” The figure was about to reply, but it suddenly clutched its head and said, “I do not know. I think someone told me, but who was that person? Ahhh… I cannot think of the answer at all.”

When he saw its expression of pain, Zu An was worried that it could turn into a demon again. He quickly said, “If you can’t think of it, it doesn’t matter. Do you know how to cross the Weak Water?”

Inwardly, however, he was also curious about who had told it that. He thought, Why do I sense a sinister plot behind all of this?

With its attention diverted, the figure gradually calmed down. It replied, “The Weak Water cannot be crossed. However, because I was born from the Weak Water, I can carry you all across.” Then, it once again transformed into the Yayu. It swam to the shore, exposing its back to them.

“How can we make you do something like that?” Zu An asked, feeling a bit embarrassed. After all, Yayu wasn’t a monster, but actually a person. Using it as a mount really felt weird.

“You have completely set me free. I do not even have enough time to thank you, so what is the issue with carrying you all over?” Yayu said. There wasn’t a single trace of hatefulness left in its demeanor.

They couldn't turn down such an enthusiastic invitation, so Zu An and the three women climbed onto Yayu’s back. They had to admit that it was large enough; its back was wide. Even though there were four people there, it didn’t seem cramped at all.

Yun Jianyue said secretly through ki, “Be careful of something strange happening. It’ll be bad if it ends up taking us into the middle of the Weak Water and throws us in.”

Yan Xuehen frowned and asked, “Could it be that in your eyes, everyone is a bad person?”

Yun Jianyue narrowed her eyes, retorting, “Stone cold woman, with your personality, you’ll be scammed by others before you even know it. This kind of thing happens all the time in our Holy Sect. There are always stories of how righteous ladies from the orthodox sects have fallen. I definitely don’t wish to hear such a story about you one day.”

“You!” Yan Xuehen exclaimed, feeling ashamed and annoyed. Even though she stayed away from worldly things, she still knew what ‘fallen’ meant.

“Don’t worry, he’s no longer the Yayu from before,” Zu An replied. He had the Rage system, so he could determine whether another party bore kind or malicious intent against him. He continued, “Yun Jianyue did come from a place filled with deception and betrayal, the Devil… Ahem, the Holy Sect. Being this guarded is only natural.”

The two women both turned their heads away, clearly still mad at each other.

Zu An felt a huge headache coming on. He could only ask Yayu, “By the way, do you know what the Queen Mother of the West’s immortal medicine is?”

Yayu swam smoothly through the water, so it felt as if they were on dry land. The once surging Weak Water actually looked completely calm. The group thus felt that this world really was amazing.

“The Queen Mother of the West’s immortal medicine is extremely mysterious. Only a few people in the world know about it,” Yayu said, shaking its head. It clearly wasn’t one of those few.

“Can you tell us a bit more about the Queen Mother of the West?” Zu An asked. He had only heard that name from folktales. After entering the Unknown Region, he had discovered that that person really did exist. He had no choice but to pay attention to the subject.

“The Queen Mother of the West came from Kunlun, so no one knows about her background. However, she has great status, so great that even the Celestial Emperor must treat her with respect. The Queen Mother of the West resides in a place called the Jade Lake. That is where the natural ki of the world gathers, which is why immortal peaches and other immortal medicines exist there,” Yayu slowly said, seemingly searching its memories. It continued, “However, I cannot remember anything more. I was a monster for too long after all; my mind has already suffered irreversible damage. I have forgotten many events of the past.”

Just then, Yu Yanluo then asked, “Do you still remember Yi?”

Yayu’s entire body trembled when it heard that name, almost throwing the people on its back into the Weak Water. However, it stabilized itself and apologized, saying, “Sorry, I was shaken up a bit and could not control myself.”

“It seems you do remember,” Zu An said, his interest piqued.

“That is someone who is quite hard to forget.” Yayu sighed. “Long, long ago, so long I cannot remember when it was, I seem to have been killed by him once. After all these years have passed, you are just like him, the only man who has subdued me.”

Zu An had a strange expression, thinking, Can you not use such weird verbs? Why do I feel so strange?

Yun Jianyue asked curiously, “Huh? You said that Yi killed you? I thought you couldn't be killed, though.”

That was what had given them a headache earlier. Whenever they killed the Yayu, it had just revived..

Yayu replied, “Yi had a formidable bow, a divine weapon. After being hit by it, I could not revive anymore.”

Zu An and the others were shaken. Shun had mentioned that Yi used a bow to shoot down nine suns. It seemed to be the same bow. Why was it so similar to the Sun Slaying Bow passed down through the Fiend races’ royal family, though? It couldn’t be the same one, could it?

However, the Sun Slaying Bow was in the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s hands, and he was with the Fiend Emperor. If Zu An passed the trial and obtained the divine weapon’s acknowledgment, the Sun Slaying Bow wouldn’t just fly over into his hands on its own, right?

Zu An couldn't help but laugh at himself when he thought of that, though. Shun had only said that the acknowledgment of a divine weapon could be obtained once the heroic path was completed. It wouldn’t necessarily be the Sun Slaying Bow.

“However, my constitution is special, and I was born again through the Weak Water and the lingering resentment. That was why, after countless years passed, when the power of that arrow disappeared, I was still able to resurrect once more. Eventually, I met all of you, and I was really blessed to be completely freed,” Yayu explained, its voice full of gratitude.

The group offered some modest remarks in return. Then, Yan Xuehen asked Yayu, “How great was Yi’s strength compared to his?”

The Yayu hesitated for a bit before saying, “It was much higher than his, maybe even higher than all of yours added together.”

The others were speechless, thinking, Are you really going to be that straightforward….

They quickly became dejected. If their strength was that far from Yi’s, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to successfully complete his heroic path.

As if sensing how grave their attitudes were, in order to make them feel better, Yayu said, “However, there is one aspect in which he is three times stronger than Yi.”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“What is that?” the others asked, stunned. There was an area in which Zu An was stronger? That meant they had to make sure to take advantage of it.

“Back then, Yi had an extremely beautiful woman at his side, one who seemed to be named Chang’e,” Yayu recalled. “However, you have women who are just as beautiful as Chang’e, and you have three of them. So actually, it is not exactly three times stronger.”

Zu An was speechless. Meanwhile, the three women blushed. Even though being praised as beautiful was worth being happy about, why did the praise sound so strange?

Yun Jianyue quickly said, “Don’t misunderstand. The two of us don’t have that kind of relationship.”

Yan Xuehen immediately said in agreement, “Nor I!” She was scared that she would look guilty if she acted even a bit slower.

Zu An shot her a look of annoyance. This woman spoke blind words with her eyes open.

Yu Yanluo’s cheeks were red, and she didn’t say anything in protest.

Yayu chuckled and said, “How similar… truly similar.”

“Similar how?” the three women asked curiously..

“Back then, that woman at Yi’s side also denied it like this. Later, did they not still become husband and wife?” Yayu said proudly, as if it had seen through everything.

The three women were speechless.

Zu An quickly asked, “Ahem, senior, do you know what kind of monster will be up ahead?”

“Up ahead is the Mulberry Forest. That is the Fengxi Boar’s territory,” said Yayu.
