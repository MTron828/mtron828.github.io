Chapter 1764: Red Brilliance Yellow Talisman

The two women both frowned. They had thought that it would be quite hard to convince this man to help them, but things seemed to have gone even more smoothly than they imagined. However, they couldn't bring themselves to feel happy about it at all.

After thinking about it, Xie Daoyun said, “But we want to look for our companions, so we might not have the time to help you…”

This world was so strange and unpredictable that things could happen at a moment’s notice. How could they have the leisure of helping someone else with something? Furthermore, if it was something even Wang Youjun found tricky, it would definitely be full of dangers. It could be better for them to not get involved.

Wang Youjun laughed and said, “You don’t need to worry about that. This issue will only take around three to seven days to settle.” When he saw that the two women were still unmoved, he added, “Without my help, wouldn’t looking for your companions be like finding a needle in a haystack? It wouldn’t make a difference for you two even if you had that extra time. As long as you agree to help me, not only will I find where your companions are, I’ll also provide you with the Wang clan’s best flying boat. I believe you should both understand fully well that flight isn’t allowed in this world. But if you have our flying boat, it should be able to save you a lot of time.”

The two women exchanged a look. They knew that what he said made some sense. Xie Daoyun was about to reply when Yun Jianyue first asked, “Then how about helping us look into where our companions are first? Otherwise, if we help you and you can’t help us, won’t we have made that trip for nothing?”

Xie Daoyun was full of admiration. It’s still big sis Yun who has more experience in the world of warriors.

Wang Youjun reached out his hand, and a special yellow talisman gradually appeared. There were some extremely complicated runes written in cinnabar on its surface. The entire talisman gave off a faint red glow.

The two women’s expressions changed slightly. This was the second time they had seen such a talisman. The first time was when Wang Neishi had used one. This talisman seemed to have a life of its own.

Wang Youjun turned to look at the two women and asked, “Who’s the one you two are looking for? What kind of distinctive traits does he have?” The two women were about to reply when he added, “Don’t talk about that adoptive brother or sister-in-law. Tell me about the other one.”

His gaze was clearly much sharper than his son’s. He keenly sensed that their relationship with that so-called adoptive brother was extraordinary. The one they cared about the most was likely him. He naturally didn’t want to tell them where that man was right from the start. Otherwise, what if they just left after hearing the information?

Yun Jianyue cursed him for being an old fox, but she still told him Yan Xuehen’s distinctive traits. Xie Daoyun hadn’t had much interaction with Yan Xuehen after all, so she didn’t know her as well as she did. Yun Jianyue thought, Stone cold woman, stone cold woman… I never expected you to be the first one I would look for…nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As Yun Jianyue spoke, Wang Youjun unrolled a white sheet of paper with one hand while moving a pen in his other hand with extraordinary skill. A sketch of Yan Xuehen quickly appeared. He was able to achieve such a thing effortlessly with just a single pen. His artistic skill was truly incredible.

Yun Jianyue’s expression changed. She asked, “What are you doing?” She remembered the painting from before, and felt shocked and annoyed. Even though she and the stone cold woman were sworn enemies, she still didn’t want Yan Xuehen to be schemed against by another.

Wang Youjun smiled and said, “Don’t worry; this isn’t a soul painting. I’m merely sketching out her appearance to make it easier for us to look for her.”

Yun Jianyue still didn’t feel at ease. She walked over and took a look. However, it was indeed just an ordinary paper and ink drawing. There weren’t any tricks being played. She sighed in relief.

Wang Youjun quickly finished up the drawing. When he completed the last stroke, he suddenly stared blankly for a moment.

“Is there something wrong?” Xie Daoyun asked worriedly.

“There isn’t. I just never expected there to be such a person in the world. She’s like a goddess from the heavens,” Wang Youjun said, giving them a deep look. He said with a sigh of amazement, “The two ladies are already incredibly beautiful, but I didn’t expect your companions to be so dazzling too. I’m even starting to wonder just what kind of superpower that Zu An has. He actually has so many incredible beauties at his side.”

“What are you saying? He’s only my big brother (friend)!” Xie Daoyun and Yun Jianyue both blurted out at the same time.

Xie Daoyun thought, Thank goodness we need something from this man. Otherwise, with big sis Yun’s temper, if anyone dared to claim that she and big brother Zu were an item, wouldn’t she pull their tongue straight out?

“Whatever you say,” Wang Youjun said with a knowing expression. Then, he made a gesture in the air. “Come!”

A picture scroll flew in from outside. The two women had good eyes and recognized that it was none other than one of the scrolls they had seen on the way. Just then, the one on the scroll seemed to realize something and began to struggle frantically. His mouth formed a roar, but no sound came out. No matter how he struggled, there was no way for him to struggle free from the drawing.

Wang Youjun summoned the scroll toward him, then chanted a strange incantation. The talisman in his palm suddenly erupted with red light. The profound pattern lit up, shining red light on the scroll.

The face in the scroll warped, then seemed to be sucked out by something. It turned into a strand of smoke and flew out of the painting, instantly entering the bright red talisman. Seemingly having just obtained the nourishment of soul force, the talisman shook a bit, as if it were doing a happy dance. Meanwhile, the drawing on the scroll became completely empty. There was no one left in it, as if there had never been a drawing in the first place.

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun’s expressions changed. They naturally knew what had just happened. The soul had been devoured in an instant, just like that!

Wang Youjun pointed at Yan Xuehen’s drawing and said that he was looking for her whereabouts. The talisman flew into the sky and released a vibrating noise as it circled around. Then, it stopped and shone a red light toward the northwest. Afterward, the light withdrew. The talisman returned back to normal and landed in his hand.

Wang Youjun pointed and said, “The lady named Yan is northwest, several tens of thousands of miles away. Hmm… That seems to be close to where the Adventurer’s Guild headquarters is. You can ask around for her information near that area.”

Yun Jianyue asked seriously, “Is that all it can do? The northwest is so large; how can we find our companion?”

Xie Daoyun was also a bit unhappy. They had gone through all that to find out such a small amount of intelligence? It really didn’t seem worth it.

“Don’t worry. I’ll give you several one-time-use copies of the talisman. If you use one every thousand miles, it will point you in a new direction. After a few times, you should be able to get close to roughly where your target is. I believe that with your skills, it won’t be too difficult for you to find that person from there,” Wang Youjun replied.

Xie Daoyun’s expression finally eased a bit. She looked at the special talismans in his hand and couldn't help but ask, “I remember that the second young master mentioned that the talismans don’t need energy sources. Why is it that your rune talisman can only operate after absorbing one’s soul?”

“That child is always fondling the flowers and trampling the grass. How would he know about these things?” Wang Youjun replied with a disappointed expression. “Who says talismans don’t need energy? Rune talismans and offerings have always been spoken of together. Why do you think that is?

“The rulers of the world have always made all kinds of sacrifices and offerings throughout history to ask the heavens or mysterious forces for protection and blessings.

“Our Divine Firmament Sect immerses itself in offerings, and we’ve traditionally used mainly fruits and vegetables as our sacrifices to the forces behind the runes. Normally, those offerings are the energy needed to activate the rune talismans. The more sincere the offerings, the more pleased those forces are. The effects of the talismans naturally become better as a result.”

“So that was it!” Xie Daoyun exclaimed, suddenly understanding the situation. She was more and more amazed at the profoundness of this world’s rune talismans.

“My rune is a bit special. It likes the power of souls. When the rune’s grade is higher, its needs are naturally a bit higher as well,” Wang Youjun said proudly. He clenched his hand, and the yellow talisman instantly disappeared.

Yun Jianyue cursed silently. The talisman was probably an evil artifact. She asked, “Then can I ask your respected self what help you need from us exactly? I hope you can explain the potential hidden dangers ahead of time.”

“It’s mainly to borrow Lady Xie’s power to undo some rather tricky defensive formations. The other monsters will be dealt with by our Wang clan. As for the dangers…” Wang Youjun paused with a chuckle, then continued, “This old one and the Wang clan’s experts will be present. Furthermore, with Miss Yun watching over things, I don’t believe that Miss Xie will be in any danger.”

When she sensed the disdain in his voice, Yun Jianyue thought to herself that what he said was correct. If the two of them and the Wang clan worked together, no dangers would be too big of an issue. But what I’m scared of is the Wang clan being the source of the danger…

Still, with how things were, she didn’t have the luxury to worry about that. She asked, “When do we leave?”

“Everything else has already been prepared and we’ve just been waiting for a formation expert. Now that everything is in order, we can depart in two hours whenever I give the order,” Wang Youjun said, taking out another talisman. With a light tap, an invisible ripple surrounded the entirety of Wang Port.
