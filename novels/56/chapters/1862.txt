Chapter 1811: A Single Mishap and Utter Defeat

When they first heard Jing Teng’s serious ‘confession’, all of the women were stunned. Initially, they had felt that perhaps Jing Teng was just trying to piss off her ex-boyfriend, and thus was saying those things to provoke him. Using Zu An as part of the act wasn’t that big of a deal. But the more they listened, the more they felt that something was off. She was now talking about them being destined for each other!

Are you two pretending as if we don’t exist?

In this world, divinations were no joke. They were a genuine school from among the seven cultivation skills. They held great and mysterious power.

While the women were still upset, they also wondered whether they could get a divination done between them and Ah Zu. Unfortunately, Immortal Ruler Baopu had already passed away, and there was no one else whose skills were on his level. Thus, they all held some resentment, but fortunately, Sun En diverted their attention.

As soon as Sun En finished speaking, he sent a palm smack at Zang Ao. Even though it was just a casual attack, that palm instantly became larger, spreading out a hundred meters across. Even the light at the edges of the palm began to warp. It was clear that space itself was starting to collapse.

“Great Heavenfall Hand!” Wang Youjun cried out, his heart pounding fiercely. His attention had previously been concentrated on the sect master’s three talismans, and he had almost forgotten about Sun En’s original ultimate skill.

Zu An and the others were also watching carefully. Sun En’s attack was indeed powerful, but when compared to Zhao Han’s moves, it was still a bit weaker. However, when they heard Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun mention that he still had three powerful divine talismans, they concluded that all of Sun En’s techniques most likely put him on the same level as Zhao Han.

However, the entire exchange passed in an instant. The Great Heavenfall Hand quickly slammed down toward Zang Ao’s head. Despite that, he didn’t evade and just stood leisurely with his hands behind his back.

The four elders he brought with him quickly moved. They roared loudly, then pressed their hands on each others’ backs. All four of them formed a straight line, and the chest of the one at the very front swelled up like a ball. He slowly pushed his palms out in front of him, and a mountainous force surged forward to face Sun En’s Great Heavenfall Hand. With a great explosion, the giant palm dispersed, sending chaotic winds in all directions.

Sun En voiced his surprise. He had wanted to test out Zang Ao with his attack, but hadn’t expected his opponent’s subordinates to block it instead. Even though they had clearly used a coordinated attack, the fact that they were able to stop his palm at all was something to be proud of.

Zu An thought, As expected of the Adventurer’s Guild Leader; he has all sorts of powerful cultivators under him.

“Four Sages of Liangshan!” Wang Youjun cried out. Apart from Zang Ao’s group, he was probably the only one in the room who had a great deal of knowledge about the Adventurer’s Guild. He quickly explained, “It was rumored that the Adventurer’s Guild had four mysterious guests. I never would have expected that not only did the guild leader come personally, he even brought his main force as well.”

Zang Ao smiled and said, “It can’t be helped; the great tomb is dangerous, so I need at least some guards to protect myself.”

The others in the tomb had strange expressions.

Like hell we’ll believe you! Your cultivation is clearly so high; why would you need others to protect you?

Sun En replied with a snort, “You have your subordinates, but did you really think I didn’t have mine?”

Wang Youjun felt his scalp turn numb when he heard that.

You’re not going to send me, are you? Even though it should be fine for me to deal with one or two, they have four! I’ll lose for sure!

Suddenly, Sun En took out a special talisman and said, “Obey my orders; all generals under the command of the true lord of the north must suppress the demons. Heed my call!”

It was the Record of Emperor's Suppression!Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The talisman emanated waves of radiance. Then, celestial troops and generals appeared, rushing toward the Four Sages of Liangshan to carry out Sun En’s order.

It was the first time Zu An had seen the talisman. He clicked his tongue in wonder. He even felt as if the figures it summoned were quite similar to ones he had seen in movies. Could it be that there really was a Celestial Court whose army descended to this world when they heard a summons?

Chu Chuyan’s beautiful eyes were also wide as she studied the talisman in the air. The White Jade Sect was actually skilled in talismans as well, but they were mostly things that assisted cultivation. How could they compare to the power of this miraculous talisman?

It wasn’t the first time Xie Daoyun had seen this talisman being used, but she was still dazzled. Unlike Chu Chuyan, who only studied talismans on the side, they were her main field of expertise. However, the runes she studied were more for use in formations. She had never thought about runes being capable of such attacks. Thus, she observed every single detail closely. She gained some insights, but had even more questions.

However, even if she couldn't comprehend the profundity of this talisman, she could share what she saw with her master. Perhaps they would even be able to break new ground.

Meanwhile, the Four Sages of Liangshan quickly sank into a difficult position. Their combination technique was best against a single powerful opponent. With their combined power, they could deal with one opponent. On top of that, no matter which of the four the enemy attacked, the other three would be able to immediately retaliate.

Of course, it wasn’t that they didn’t have any ways to deal with numerous enemies. After all, they all had extremely high cultivations. However, if they had many enemies, and every one of them was strong, that would be an issue.

The celestial troops quickly surrounded the Four Sages of Liangshan. Even though at first, the four were able to hold on by coordinating with each other, there were just too many celestial soldiers. They were quickly overwhelmed…

This was something their enemies often felt. They hadn’t expected fortunes to rise and fall so quickly.

One celestial general couldn't get to the four sages, so he decided to just target Zang Ao instead. He brandished his massive golden hammer and brought it down ferociously on Zang Ao’s head. The hammer was massive, and together with his great strength, forget about a human, even a prehistoric mammoth would be flattened into a meat pancake.

Zang Ao finally moved, sending a fist strike upward. Compared to the massive golden hammer, the fist was like an ant against an elephant.

However, as soon as the two made contact, something strange and yet somehow inevitable-seeming happened. Zang Ao didn’t move an inch, but the giant hammer’s surface began to crack. Those cracks extended along it, eventually reaching the golden armored general himself. Eventually, the cracks became more and more numerous until they resembled a spiderweb. With a loud noise, the massive celestial general’s entire body split open and scattered into smoke and ashes.

Zu An’s group had grave expressions. No wonder Jing Teng had said that Zang Ao was one of the world’s strongest individuals!! Now, that indeed seemed to be the case.

Yun Jianyue felt really dejected. She had always been a proud and arrogant person, and yet in this world, she had experienced setback after setback. Sun En was one thing, as his cultivation was far greater than her own. He even had those three talismans, so it wasn’t too surprising that she couldn't win against him. They were all sect masters either way, so they could still get along. It wasn’t too embarrassing.

However, what was going on with this Zang Ao? The power of his fist alone already proved that he was considerably stronger than her! Despite that, he wasn’t that old. Furthermore, judging from their conversation, it sounded as if it hadn’t been that many years since he began his cultivation. How did that make any sense?

She had always been extremely confident in herself, and thought she was outstanding. And yet now, she felt strangely powerless and defeated.

“You were finally unable to hold back and used your power, I see,” Sun En said as he calmly looked at Zang Ao.

Zang Ao looked at the nearby Four Sages of Liangshan. Even though they were in terrible condition, they wouldn’t fall for some time. He said, “Sect Master Sun, we don’t share any grudges that can’t be settled between us. Why do you insist on fighting against me? Shouldn’t you first capture that group and learn where the immortal opportunity is? Their strength isn’t anything to scoff at. If we take each other out, won’t they be able to take advantage of us after?”

Sun En said indifferently, “What you say indeed makes sense, but you already plotted against me once in the past. I will not make the same mistake again.”

As soon as he spoke, another talisman rose above his head, glowing a faint purple. Lightning flickered across its surface, with each arc carrying the energy of annihilation.

It was the Record of Divine Firmament!

The talisman suddenly lit up. At the same time, a bolt of lightning that was as thick as an arm crashed down. It wasn’t normal lightning, but something closer to tribulation lightning. Not only did it target the body, it also aimed at the soul.

Not even Zang Ao dared to face it directly. His body flickered, actually moving faster than the lightning as he charged at Sun En. He knew that dodging the lightning would only force him into a passive position. Thus, he had to close the distance so Sun En couldn't use the lightning anymore.

However, who could have thought that Sun En had already expected his choice? Purple light suddenly erupted between the two of them. Countless bolts of lightning that were as thick as buckets flooded every inch of the space. The lightning seemed practically tangible, and it was completely red.

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun’s expressions changed. The power of this attack was even greater than the expanse of terrifying lightning back on that island. It seemed that Sun En was going all out against Zang Ao.

This was the first time Zu An and the others had seen such lightning. Their expressions all changed. The legendary immortal ascension required a baptism of tribulation lightning, but which cultivator could survive such a powerful lightning storm?

Zang Ao, who had just rushed in, looked as if he had been caught in a web. He was instantly drowned within the expanse of terrifying lightning, causing him to scream bitterly. A faint sphere of light formed around him; a protective treasure had clearly activated. Unfortunately, inside the terrifying tribulation lightning-like domain, the treasure couldn't last long at all. It shattered almost instantly.

However, as expected of the Adventurer’s Guild Leader, he quickly took out all sorts of magical treasures. Even so, they quickly exploded one after another. Amid the horrifying tribulation lightning, each of them could only buy him a single second of survival.

As time went on, he used up more and more treasures, but the lightning showed no sign of stopping. Still, he didn’t have endless treasures. Eventually, he could only rely on his own cultivation and defend with various skills.

Unfortunately, they were no match at all for the tribulation lightning’s power. Soon, he finally couldn't take it anymore. His entire body was electrocuted until he resembled a lump of coal, and he fell with a loud bang.

“Guild leader!” the Four Sages of Liangshan exclaimed, their faces completely ashen. They had thought that with the guild leader's cultivation, even if he wasn’t a match for Sun En, he wouldn’t be defeated that quickly. And yet now, he was completely and utterly crushed in an instant!”
