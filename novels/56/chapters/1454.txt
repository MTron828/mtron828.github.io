Chapter 1403: Jiuyi Mountain Range

The two women had a fine layer of sweat covering their faces. The graceful hair around their temples had stuck to their skin, and an unnatural redness had spread across their faces. They looked even more lovely than usual.

At that instant, it was as if the two of them were the most popular courtesan queens, and they were showing their most attractive sides. However, Zu An couldn't help but laugh. What brothel had such stunning girls?

Yan Xuehen rolled her eyes, replying, “Oh? It almost sounds as if you want something to happen to us.”

“Of course not,” Zu An said, chuckling in embarrassment. Then, he looked at Yu Yanluo. She was sitting with her eyes shut, focusing on getting rid of the poison.

Yun Jianyue said, “We’ve already completely removed the poison. Fortunately, we didn’t consume any directly, or else it would have been much more troublesome. I really hadn’t expected there to actually be such a disgusting beast in this world.”

Yan Xuehen nodded in deep sympathy as she imagined those slimy tentacles. That kind of thing made women feel extremely uncomfortable.

When he heard that the two women had already gotten rid of the poison, Zu An’s expression grew strange. As expected of the two arch-enemies! Their cultivations were close, and even the amount of time it had taken for them to remove the poison was identical.

Yun Jianyue noticed his expression and remarked with an ambiguous smile, “Oh? You seem to be quite disappointed to hear that we’ve gotten rid of the poison.”

Zu An chuckled and said, “Of course. At first, I thought that if the two beauties couldn’t get rid of the poison, I’d have no choice but to sacrifice my own body to help.”

“Shameless!” Yan Xuehen harrumphed. She hadn’t expected this guy to say such a thing in such a bold and confident manner.

Yun Jianyue had initially been planning to tease him for a bit, but instead, she was the one who had been provoked! Even though she was normally tough, she was still a maiden. How could she win against such fierce aggression? She exclaimed, “You damn brat, if anyone else had spoken such filthy words to me, I would have already pulled out his tongue and fed it to the dogs!”

Zu An smiled and said, “It is true that big sis Yun really dotes on me.”

“Hmph!” Yun Jianyue finally couldn't take it anymore. She turned around to look at Yan Xuehen, suggesting, “Stone cold woman, why don’t we go and take a bath?”

Yan Xuehen voiced her agreement. After removing the poison, her entire body was sticky and uncomfortable.

Zu An’s expression turned a bit strange when he saw that. Where had they expelled the poison from…?

After getting up, Yan Xuehen gave the concentrating Yu Yanluo a look. Her cultivation was a bit lower, so she couldn't finish as quickly as them. She asked, “Should we help her?”

Yun Jianyue rolled her eyes, replying, “What are you worried about her for? Even if she fails, there’s a stick of the antidote right there.”

“A stick?” Zu An hadn’t expected he would be described like that by someone one day. As expected of the Devil Sect’s big sis Yun, she really was straightforward with her words.

Yan Xuehen harrumphed, clearly disapproving of the description. Furthermore, for some reason, she felt a bit strange when she heard what Yun Jianyue said. She became a bit absent-minded.

Zu An asked, “Do you guys still dare to go into the water? Aren’t you scared of that big octopus?”

“We’re just going to wash by the shore,” Yun Jianyue said proudly. “That octopus is so large, how would it even be able to cross over? Furthermore, even if it shows up, with our cultivation, we should be able to safely escape back to shore.”

Zu An couldn't help but picture the two beauties running out of the water in a sorry state without a shred of clothing on them. He suddenly began to hope that the huge octopus monster would come back.

After taking a few steps, Yun Jianyue turned around again and said, “Damn brat, you’re not allowed to peek!”

“You are not allowed to use your divine sense either!” Yan Xuehen added.

“Am I that kind of person?” Zu An muttered unhappily. These two women really were something… He had already seen everything anyway, so why did they still have to deceive themselves like that?

“What are you mumbling about?” Yun Jianyue snapped, giving him a fierce look.

“Nothing, haha. I just wanted to say to be careful,” Zu An quickly responded.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue thus left in satisfaction.

When he heard the sounds of splashing water soon afterward, Zu An shook his head and focused his mind to help Yu Yanluo watch her surroundings.

…

Nearby, two beautiful figures bathed in the water. Surrounded by azure seawater, their skin looked even fairer and more moving.

Yun Jianyue secretly glanced at Yan Xuehen, thinking to herself that this woman normally always acted as if she were above everyone else, but she actually had such a seductive chest. It’s not even outdone by my own.

“What are you looking at?” Yan Xuehen asked, covering her chest when she sensed Yun Jianyue’s scorching gaze. Even though she was a woman too, it still felt a bit unnatural.

Yun Jianyue reached out a hand to touch them, but Yan Xuehen smacked it away with a palm. However, she didn’t seem to mind and remarked, “It’s not as if you’ll lose anything from a touch.” She then added, “Right, why do I feel as if you’re acting a bit too enthusiastic around Yu Yanluo? It’s almost as if you did something to let her down and you’re working hard to make up for it.”

Yan Xuehen had been about to get angry, but upon hearing that question, she just felt a bit guilty. She quickly explained, “Back then, she was seriously injured because I was the one who chased them. Of course I feel a bit guilty toward her.”

“Is that really it?” Yun Jianyue replied, feeling a bit suspicious. She was about to ask more when Yu Yanluo ran over to them with a reddened face. She had clearly just finished removing the poison as well.

Because of the trauma they still shared from the huge octopus, the group didn’t dare to mess around too much. They returned to shore after bathing.

When Yun Jianyue arrived ashore, she wasn’t in a rush to put on her clothes and instead said to Yan Xuehen, “Stone cold woman, help me out.”

Yu Yanluo was puzzled. However, Yan Xuehen waved her hand, and fluttering ice and snow wrapped around their bodies. Then, the snowflakes flew away, completely drying up all the seawater on their bodies. Yu Yanluo was amazed when she saw that.

The women thus put on their clothes and returned to where Zu An was.

A dangerous smile appeared on Yun Jianyue’s face as she asked, “Little An, you didn’t peep on us, did you?”

Zu An plucked a leaf from the branch in front of him and harrumphed in annoyance, retorting,“If I wanted to look, I would just go over and be open about it. Would I have to peep?”

Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo’s faces turned red. Zu An had seen both of them openly before. As for Yun Jianyue, she also felt a bit ashamed, because Zu An had seen her openly too…

Fortunately, Zu An didn’t press the matter. He said, “Right, I looked around while you guys were washing up. I noticed a stone tablet by the foot of the mountain.”

The three women immediately focused their attention. In this Unknown Region, everything around them was unfamiliar. If there was a stone tablet, it could indicate some treasure! They quickly followed Zu An in the direction of the stone tablet.

When he saw the three ladies’ dresses fluttering around, Zu An suddenly asked, “Can you give me a set of your clothes?” Now that he thought about it, did women naturally have so many clothes? It had been so long, and yet he had never seen them wear the same outfits again.

“What do you need them for?” the three women asked, looking at him strangely.

“I have a skill that requires clothes,” Zu An said without batting an eyelid. It had been such a long time already; he had change out the clothes in Pin Ru’s Wardrobe. Otherwise, the next time he used it, it could end in disaster.

After being together for so long, the women knew that Zu An was extremely reliable. When they heard that it was related to a skill, they didn’t worry too much and agreed. They all looked in their spatial storages.

“I need clothes that you’ve worn before,” Zu An reminded them. If they were completely new sets, he wasn’t sure if Pin Ru’s Wardrobe would activate.

The three women immediately stopped, crying, “Pervert!” Then, they didn’t pay him any more attention and walked away.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Zu An finally reacted and said, “Ah, you’ve all misunderstood! It’s not that I want the authentic taste or something like that, it’s just that I need some clothes you’ve worn before! Sigh, why can’t I explain this…”

…

As the group bickered, they inadvertently arrived in front of the stone tablet Zu An had mentioned before.

“Jiuyi Mountains[1]?” Yun Jianyue’s eyes narrowed when she heard Zu An’s reading of the text. She asked, “Stone cold woman, have you heard of this mountain before?”

“No,” Yan Xuehen said, shaking her head. They were all experienced and knowledgeable individuals, and yet they had never heard of this place before.

Zu An only felt that the name was a bit familiar, but he couldn't recall where exactly he heard it before.

Just then, a slow, drawn-out voice called out, “The Puppet Curse of the White Emperor’s lineage?”

1. The Jiuyi Mountains are a mountain range in Hunan province, China. They are located in the Yongzhou, Ningyuan, and Lanshan region, bordering Guangdong province. These mountains are reputed to be the burial place of Emperor Shun. ☜
