Chapter 1820: How Lowly

The reason Zu An could fight against those with higher cultivation ranks than him was that he had the Heaven Devouring Sutra, as well as the Kun Peng’s power, for defense. Those two techniques allowed him to absorb and neutralize attacks that far exceeded what other cultivators could endure. In terms of offense, he also had the Star Shattering Imprint Yun Jianyue had given him, which was why he could threaten beings on the Ghost King’s level.

Otherwise, no matter how many more cultivators like Zu An there were, even if the Ghost King or Zhao Han stood there and did nothing, they still wouldn’t be able to do a thing. Just a single slap would destroy all of their defenses and crush them into meat pancakes.

That was why the Ghost King was starting to question life. It was as if an elephant were fighting against an ant, and the elephant thought it would be able to completely crush the ant, and yet they were actually fighting bitterly against each other. Even though the elephant still had the advantage, that was still enough to make its eyes pop out.

Zu An didn’t respond to the Ghost King; he was full of worry. The Ghost King’s skill was too strange and he couldn't do much to counter it alone. If they worked together, they could have a chance, but the women were defending against the Demonic Voice of the Ghost King and couldn't emerge to participate in the battle at all.

He suddenly thought of something and shouted at the Ghost King, “What you lookin’ at?”

“I’m looking at you, shithead!” the Ghost King reflexively replied, leaving him a bit stunned. Even though he had seen Zu An use the skill before, he hadn’t expected to not have any resistance to it either. The principles behind the skill were extremely high, to the point that it was quite horrifying.

However, Zu An frowned. ‘What you lookin’ at’ actually hadn’t stopped the Demonic Voice of the Ghost King. Even though he had responded, there were still other skulls that continued to roar and weren’t affected.

F*ck! Why does this monster have so many goddamn heads?

“I’m becoming more and more interested in you,” the Ghost King said. He carefully sized up Zu An as if he were looking at a bizarre and fantastical creature, almost as significant as the Baopu Sutra Inner manual. There were just too many secrets to uncover behind this youngster.

Zu An said indifferently, “Unfortunately, I have no interest in you.” He immediately used the ‘Ikuu Experience Card’, but the Ghost King didn’t respond to it.

The Ghost King was stunned. He could vaguely sense that some special technique had been used on him, but nothing else happened.

“Did Sun En end up like that earlier because of this skill?” he muttered while carefully examining himself to see if he could decipher the principles behind the skill. Unfortunately, he could only sense that it was incredibly profound and actually couldn't understand it.

Zu An voiced his surprise. “Who would have thought that you were actually a virgin!” This really was depressing. This guy was called the lord of the Yin Yang Realm, the king of all ghosts, and yet such a person had never experienced any romance. What the hell…

The Ghost King snorted. “What right do you have to assume I’m a man?”

Zu An was stunned, saying, “Don’t tell me you’re a woman.”

“Are you a perverted maniac or something? You actually imagined me as a woman?” the Ghost King sneered. “I am a being that does not distinguish by sex. How could a lower-level being like you possibly comprehend something on my level?”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

…

Meanwhile, the women all had strange expressions. However, the one they were looking at wasn’t the Ghost King, but rather Zu An.

Just what is this kid thinking every day? He actually imagined the Ghost King as a woman?

When he saw the Rage points that appeared on the backend, Zu An felt as if his head would explode. He didn’t know what they were getting angry for.

The Ghost King said he wasn’t a guy, so what’s wrong with me guessing that they were a girl? How could I have known that they were neither male or female?

“I don’t like that look in your eyes at all,” the Ghost King said, glowering. The black mist started to look as if it were burning, and the skulls began to sparkle as if they were jade. The skulls then attacked Zu An again; both their power and speed had increased by several times.

Zu An soon found himself in great danger. The Heaven Devouring Sutra and Kun Peng’s absorption had limits, and there was no way his opponent would let him slowly digest the absorbed power. If he absorbed too much in a short amount of time, his body wouldn’t be able to take it either.

…

When they saw the danger Zu An was in, the women were all really anxious. However, in order to keep them under control, the Ghost King made sure to leave behind a ring of skulls to continue roaring at them. The black tortoise and other various techniques could barely hold on, but if they left that barrier, their souls would be instantly sucked out. Not only would they not be able to help Zu An, they would only make him worry and become distracted.

In the end, there was just too big of a gap in strength between them and the Ghost King. Not everyone was as much of a monster as Zu An, who had many skills to fight against someone on that level.

Xie Daoyun was struggling to maintain the formation. Suddenly, however, a voice spoke in her ear. “Miss Xie, are you willing to become my inheritor?”

Xie Daoyun was stupefied, because that voice was too familiar. They had frequently conversed with each other as of late. Who else could it be but Sun En?! However, he had clearly been ambushed by the Ghost King and killed!

She quickly turned to look to one side. She saw that Sun En’s corpse was still nearby. Her eyes widened, because he couldn't be any more dead.

Sun En spoke again. “Stop looking already. I am over here.”

Xie Daoyun followed the source of the sound and saw that there was a talisman calmly floating next to Sun En’s corpse.

It was the Record of High Firmament!

“You’re still alive?” Xie Daoyun was scared of startling the Ghost King and quickly replied through a ki transmission.

“Sigh, I am already dead. This is nothing more than a lingering will attached to a talisman,” Sun En said. “Chasing a wild goose will only end with getting your eyes pecked out in the end.”

It was clear that after being schemed against twice in a row, he was extremely unhappy. However, after learning that Zang Ao was the Ghost King, he couldn't help but feel that it made sense.

“To make a long story short, my divine will is about to scatter soon,” Sun En said hurriedly. “I cannot let the Divine Firmament Sect’s three records end in my hands and become the sect’s greatest sinner. Our conversation on the way here was still rather pleasant. I know that you have some accomplishments in runes and formations, so you are perfect to pass on my legacy to.”

Xie Daoyun was a bit hesitant. She protested, “But I already have a teacher, and I can’t change to another school!”

Sun En said impatiently, “I do not need you to make me your master; I only hope that out of respect for our pleasant times together, you will take care of the Divine Firmament Sect a bit.”

He felt really dejected. Normally, what kind of a being was he? There were countless people who wanted to be his disciple, and yet he hadn’t even given them a second look. He had never expected that this little lady he asked to become his disciple would be so unwilling, and he had to even plead with her. He wouldn’t even have the title of master.

Sigh, how lowly am I…

Xie Daoyun was a bit troubled. She said, “Even so, I’m not someone of this world, so I might not be able to take care of your respected sect.”

Sun En was speechless. If he still had a flesh body, perhaps he would have already coughed out a mouthful of blood.

Is this retribution for assaulting that noble clan daughter in the past? Sigh… The two of us even spent some time together afterward, but she ended up finding a chance to end her own life. Only then did I realize that I actually came to like her.

However, time couldn’t be turned back. That event had also become an inner demon to him. The reason he had been unable to successfully pass through tribulation in the past was probably related to it.

For some reason, from the very moment he first saw Xie Daoyun, he hadn’t been able to avoid thinking of her. Even though they didn’t look even remotely similar, perhaps it was that noble bearing that had made him remember the past. That was why he hadn’t troubled her or Yun Jianyue along the way, and had instead chatted quite pleasantly.

“Enough, enough. I don’t need you to take care of them. All I need is for these three records to have a successor. If you are going to die, whether it is your daughter or your disciple, it doesn’t matter. That’s all fine,” Sun En said. He had actually already guessed that these two were from a different world from their conversation on the way. More importantly, practically everyone here wasn’t from this damn world!

I can’t just pass them to the Ghost King, can I? Forget it, forget it. As long as the three records can be passed down, I’m sure there will be some mysterious fate in play.

“You’re not trying to possess me, right?” Xie Daoyun asked vigilantly when she sensed that he had become so agreeable.

Sun En was stunned.

I’m already so damn sincere, yet she’s actually still doubting me?

This girl looks all gentle and weak, but why is she so vigilant?

“Do you want to help your man or not?” Sun En hissed through gritted teeth.

“Big brother Zu isn’t my man or anything…” Xie Daoyun said, blushing. She glanced at Zu An, who was fighting bitterly nearby, with eyes full of worry.

“I didn’t even say the name Zu An.” Sun En harrumphed. This young lady’s thoughts were so easy to read. None of those pretty women at that man’s side were easy to deal with; the water around him was full of sharks. This petite young lady wouldn’t even have any bone dregs left over if she tried to struggle in that pond. He said, “If you don’t want them, then forget it.”

“I do! I want them!” Xie Daoyun exclaimed, panicking.

Sun En was speechless. All of his sincere words were nothing compared to just mentioning that pretty boy.

This really is a blasted world.

However, he knew he didn’t have any more time, so he didn’t dare to hesitate anymore. He quickly passed on a mnemonic chant to her and immediately warned her, “Your cultivation is still too low right now, so you won’t be able to use their full power. Cultivate properly so that in the future…”

His voice became softer and softer, then finally disappeared. However, those three talismans were quietly floating in front of Xie Daoyun.

Yun Jianyue, who was still passing ki to her, was startled. She quickly asked her what happened.

Xie Daoyun gave her a rough summary of what had happened, but Yun Jianyue was still worried. She said, “Be careful. That bastard is a bad person. He might use this chance to possess you.”

Xie Daoyun shook her head and replied, “The words of the dying carry benevolence. Big sister Yun, please don’t worry.”

Nearby, Qiu Honglei perked up her ears. You’re calling her big sister? Then doesn’t that mean I’m an entire generation beneath you now?

It wasn’t just her, even Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman had strange expressions. They were of the same generation as Qiu Honglei, but now, they had a little senior?

This girl doesn’t seem to be the weak little white rabbit she looks like!

Yun Jianyue carefully examined the three talismans, then sighed in relief when she saw that there were no souls attached to them. She said, “Sect Master Sun really is quite the character. It seems I’ve viewed his generosity with the attitude of the petty.”

“That’s because big sister was worried about me,” Xie Daoyun said sincerely.

Yun Jianyue suddenly noticed the way the others were looking at her and couldn't help but cough. She said, “Ahem, don’t call me big sister in the future. That was just something we did as a measure against Sun En on the way here.”

Seniority wasn’t something that could be messed with. She couldn't just let her own disciple suffer because of that.

Xie Daoyun voiced her understanding. However, she suddenly thought of something and exclaimed, “Ah, I have to go help big brother Zu!”

Then, her hands came together. She extended two fingers vertically in front of her, then chanted some words. The Record of High Firmament suddenly began to glow a faint blue, unleashing a bolt of lightning at the Ghost King.

Pika's Thoughts

Editor Felis: I decided to go with the neutral 'they' to refer to the Ghost King for now, considering the whole point of the start of this chapter. Besides, the Ghost King is made up of countless skulls, so it makes sense regardless... and there's another reason this will be relevant later.
