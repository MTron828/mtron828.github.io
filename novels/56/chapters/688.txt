Chapter 673: No Meaning Left

Translator: Pika

“Alright, you can leave now.” The crown princess waved her hand. Her head was all over the place right now so she needed to be alone.

Zu An cupped his hands and left. Outside, the crown prince was currently having the time of his life beating the two lesser eunuchs.

When he saw how into it the eunuchs looked in this battle between noobs, he sighed in admiration. This was just a small eastern palace, yet there were two oscar worthy actors right here.

When he saw that it was already getting dark, he found Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun. “Are you guys off yet? If you’re done, then let’s go!”

“Off?” The two were stunned, but they could guess what this meant. They both looked excited. “Let’s go!”

Even though none of them said where they were going, any man would understand from how they were gesturing towards each other.

Zu An was, obviously, not that excited about the government brothel. The girls at his side were prettier than even the courtesan queens, so why did he need to play around in that type of place?

He did this mainly to find Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei. He wanted to see if they already made it out safely. Furthermore, he wanted to ask Yun Jianyue about the one who had been tailing them before.

The Devil Sect’s base of operations was located in the government brothel. Even though it experienced the Cheng Gang disturbance, that was something they did set up deliberately. They already made preparations beforehand and only gave up some resources to look the part. That was why the court didn’t didn’t end up endangering their real base there.

Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun saved him from King Qi by informing the crown princess. This was a gratitude he had to repay. This visit was also a good excuse to hide his real objective.

“Big bro Zu, a night in the government brothel is practically half a month of salary for us. It hasn’t been that long since you’ve entered the capital, so you haven’t gotten paid yet, right? How about we come back next month?” After his initial excitement passed, Piao Duandiao realized this and asked out of consideration.

Zu An said with a smile, “It’s fine, I can at least pay for a single night in the government brothel.”

This fella was already calling him big bro! This guy was easy to get along with after all.

Piao Duandiao’s eyes immediately lit up. His dark circles also became more obvious. “Big Bro Zu is really generous! I heard that there were a few new courtesan queens in the government brothel. Let’s visit one of them today.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Jiao Sigun sneered. “Who was the one complaining about waist pain and looking for stimulation medicine everywhere? Will you even be able to get it up even if there was a courtesan queen right in front of you?”

Piao Duandiao was furious, but his expression lacked confidence. “Nonsense! When did I have any of that? I was just looking for some sleeping medicine, okay? Hmph, forget about a courtesan queen, I would be able to do it even if it was you lying on the bed. Would you believe me?”

“Tsk, with your little toothpick of a thing, who knows who will be the one screwing who.” Jiao Sigun fired back.

“Who is a little toothpick? If you have guts, then let’s compare!” Piao Duandiao was like a cat that had his tail stepped on.

“Sure, why not? I was about to take a piss anyway.” Jiao Sigun chuckled. He walked over to a large tree, and then he whistled while doing a number one.

This world wasn’t a clean and orderly metropolis like the modern world. There were no proper public toilet systems. This type of thing was incredibly common.

Piao Duandiao’s expression changed several times. In the end, he still braced himself and walked over. He did his best to stay a bit further away from Jiao Sigun.

Jiao Sigun gave him a sidelong glance. He almost blurted out laughing. “That’s it?”

Piao Duandiao snorted. “Yours is about the same.”

Zu An suddenly felt the urge to go as well when he heard them peeing.

He walked over. Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun quietly glanced over. Jiao Sigun was full of confidence, while Piao Duandiao wanted to find some confidence.

However, both of them trembled the moment they took a single glance. Their smiles instantly froze.

What the fuck? Is that something a human should have?

The two of them both took a step to the side to stand a bit further from him.

Then, they shook their legs a few times before pulling up their pants in dejection.

Piao Duandiao felt like everything was meaningless, while Jiao Sigun was questioning life.

The two no longer argued with each other for the rest of the way. Both of them were quiet.

Zu An smirked. He asked a rhetorical question. “Why aren’t the two of you saying anything?”

Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun turned around to give him a look. Their expressions were incredibly conflicted.

There will always be people better than you… I won’t act cocky about this ever again. Sigh, I shouldn’t have tried to show off when I didn’t even have anything special. After seeing Zu An’s, what is the point of anything anymore… thought Jiao Sigun.

I need to ask Sir Zu just how he got it that big in the future. Even if I only learn some small tricks, it’ll be enough to destroy that bastard Jiao Sigun! I can’t let him brag in front of me all the time. Piao Duandiao thought.

Am I being mean? Sigh, but not showing off is just like wearing your best stuff at night in total darkness. I had a rare chance to show off a bit, so it’s fine, right? Zu An thought.

All of them were preoccupied with different thoughts. They arrived at the government brothel soon afterwards.

Zu An contacted the female brothel keeper through the secret signal he agreed on with Qiu Honglei. She quickly returned with a bunch of girls.

“Young master, these are all popular girls in the government brothel. You may choose whichever one you like.” The female brothel keeper said with a big smile. She leaned towards Zu An with her large chest while speaking. There was a powerful perfume coming from her body.

Zu An nudged to the side without batting an eyelid. He wasn’t someone with such a high tolerance that he would even choose a brothel keeper.

But these girls she brought weren’t bad at all. All of them were cute and lovely. They would easily be the prettiest girls in school in his past world.

Sigh, this scheme really does bring back memories… He was already starting to miss his past glory days a bit…

Pah! I’m an upright and outstanding person! How could I have possibly gone to those types of places?

He cleared his throat and pointed at Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun. “They’re the main characters today. I’ll be satisfied as long as you take good care of them.”

Isn’t prostitution illegal in many countries… But I’m not paying them anything, right? Then this doesn’t count?

There’s no way the Devil Sect will charge me with our relationship.

Zu An immediately felt much better.

The brothel keeper was beaming with smiles. “No problem! Girls, take care of them well.”

Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun were alarmed. They began to whisper among themselves.

“You really can’t judge a person by appearances! Big Bro Zu looks upright and honest, but he’s actually so experienced in this type of place!” Jiao Sigun said with a sigh. Zu An looked like he was right at home here.

Piao Duandiao was also completely convinced. “And I thought that I was already quite the old hand in this place. Compared to Big Bro Zu, I’m nothing.”

They would only play with some ordinary girls whenever they came here. Yet now, the ones they were with were all the most popular girls they didn’t even dare to dream about before!

In terms of face and body, these girls were far, far superior!

“If we keep following Big Bro Zu, we’ll definitely live well!” Piao Duandiao said sincerely.

Jiao Sigun surprisingly didn’t argue back at all. Instead, he nodded in deep agreement.

The two of them quickly chose a girl they liked. Piao Duandiao chose a girl who looked a bit older and a bit more voluptuous.

Jiao Sigun chose a petite girl who looked charming and pitiful.

Zu An gave them a look. He finally knew why Piao Duandiao was always so fake.

As for Jiao Sigun, he looked cold and aloof, but he actually liked this green tea bitch type. He told himself that he had to make sure to warn the brothel keeper, or else this innocent fella might end up losing everything to this girl.

The brothel keeper said with a smile, “The other two sirs have already chosen. Which girl does Sir Zu wish to choose?”

Zu An waved his hand and said, “Only a kid would choose. An adult will take all of them.”

Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun were horrified. Their big bro really was the big bro. This type of style wasn’t something they could ever hope to achieve.

The brothel keeper was shocked. “You… want all of them?”

“Is that a problem?” Zu An gave her a look.

“Not at all!” The brothel keeper smiled. “I’m just worried about the young master’s body. Not even iron could last that long!”

Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun looked dejected. “Brothel keeper, I think you should worry more about your girls.”

Both of them recalled the same scene…

Damn it! We can’t keep remembering that scene! We’ll become depressed at this rate!

The two of them quickly took their girls with them to their rooms. They didn’t want to look at Zu An anymore and remember that scene.

Zu An had girls all around him. He leaned back in comfort and enjoyed the service of these lovely girls all around him. It was like heaven on earth!

Meanwhile, a beautiful young lady who was watching from inside of a nearby room stomped her feet in anger. “This scoundrel! He’s pissing me off!”
