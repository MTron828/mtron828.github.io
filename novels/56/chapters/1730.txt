Chapter 1679: Assassin

When she heard what he said, Zhang Zitong’s expression revealed a hint of pain. Perhaps because she had already shown her most embarrassing and private side to him, the way she looked at Zu An became gentler, and she didn’t hold back from revealing some information that wasn’t critical. She explained, “Sir Seven did treat me really well. If he hadn’t been the one who forced my clan to complete ruin, I might really have treated him as my adoptive father.”

Zu An repeated in surprise, “Forced your clan to ruin?”

“That’s right,” Zhang Zitong said, a hint of hatred flashing through her eyes. “I was still young back then. I remember that one day, Golden Token Seven appeared in my clan’s home with some people. My father was really scared at the time, but still went out to greet him. Then, for some reason, both sides began to fight, and then my clan was wiped out.

“If not for the fact that my nanny risked her life to send me out, I might have also died in that disaster. But in order to save me, my nanny swapped the clothes of her own child with mine, to die in my place. Furthermore, she eventually also died because of an arrow wound.” As she spoke about the past, her eyes clearly became red, either out of grief or hatred.

Zu An frowned. He asked, “Your clan belonged to an official? When did this happen?”

A clan that required a Golden Token Envoy to personally deal with it definitely couldn’t be an average one.

“My father’s tabooed name was Zhiquan. In the past, he was an Imperial Censor, but this all happened thirteen years ago,” Zhang Zitong said with a voice full of grief.

Thirteen years before the present, Zu An still hadn’t transmigrated to this world yet. He naturally didn’t know Imperial Censor Zhang. He said, “I’ll help you look into this matter if I get a chance in the future, to find out what happened.”

Sure enough, whether it was Zhang Zitong’s appearance or aptitude, they were features that an ordinary pair of parents couldn't produce. Even though Zu An wasn’t willing to admit it, this cultivation world was even more cruel in that respect than his previous world. The stronger the bloodline of the parents was, the more outstanding their posterity would often be. In contrast, it was difficult for ordinary people to produce even a single individual with cultivation aptitude.

Zhang Zitong had a distressed smile as she replied, “What would be the use even if you looked into it? Our Zhang clan has already been wiped out. The dead can’t be revived. Furthermore, I’ve already gotten revenge for my clan, so I don’t have any regrets left in this life.”

“If some injustice really took place, there might still be a chance of righting that wrong. I believe you wouldn’t want your Zhang clan to still carry a shameful name even after death, right?” Zu An asked, seeing the resolve to die in her eyes. He knew that after completing her revenge, she had lost all her will to live. That made things really troublesome, as it would be hard to get any more useful information from her. Thus, he had to give her some hope first.

Sure enough, Zhang Zitong’s previously dull eyes revealed a sliver of emotion. Zu An used the opportunity to say, “From what I know, you were taken in by Golden Token Seven and raised by him at a young age. According to what you said earlier, you were the only one left of your clan. At that age, I don’t believe that you could have already developed any thoughts of carrying out an infiltration and waiting for revenge.”

After a moment of hesitation, Zhang Zitong still replied, “Someone appeared in front of me back then. He asked me if I wanted revenge, and as I was in the pits of despair, I agreed immediately.

“I trained with them for a year or so. Later, he told me that there was an opportunity for revenge, which was to join the Embroidered Envoy. So, I pretended to be an orphan on the streets. I pretended to have coincidentally bumped into Golden Token Seven, and sure enough, he ended up favoring me. However, he had no idea that it was all a plot.”

In truth, if not for the embarrassment from the treatment that had mysteriously made her feel closer to Zu An, she wouldn’t reveal such information. However, she didn’t even feel as if telling him these things was that big of a deal anymore.

Zu An frowned slightly and said, “Normally, with Golden Token Seven’s cautious nature, any traces of cultivation shouldn’t have escaped his notice.”

Zhang Zitong explained, “My benefactor didn’t teach me any cultivation on purpose, only training my will and other aspects. Golden Token Seven thought that I was more mature than others because I had to wander the streets, so he didn’t suspect anything.”

Zu An nodded. He asked, “Who was the one who raised you?”

To place that chess piece more than ten years in the past, only to reap the benefits now… just how great of a scheme was that?

Zhang Zitong shook her head and said, “That person has shown me great favor. There’s no way I could tell you that information.”

Zu An scowled and said, “Since you were an Embroidered Envoy for so many years, you should understand their methods. There are ways of making you speak.”

Zhang Zitong looked away. She bit her lip and asked, “In that case, why did you save me then?” She clearly knew about those methods too. Her voice now carried a hint of fear.

She took a deep breath to calm herself down and said, “I knew this day would come back then, so I already made my preparations. Even if all my acupoints are sealed, I still have ways of ending my own life. The only reason I haven’t used them is because you went through so much to save me just now, so I didn’t want to waste your goodwill.”

Zu An was stunned. He didn’t know if what she said was true or not, but there were many mysterious things in this world. Perhaps she really did have something like that. As such, he changed his approach and asked, “Have you thought about this before? What if that so-called great benefactor was actually the one who truly forced your clan into ruin? Otherwise, why would he have just happened to appear in front of you when you were at your lowest point? On top of that, everything just lined up afterward and you were planted into the ranks of a Golden Token Envoy, and as the right hand of Golden Token Seven, no less?”

Zhang Zitong was stunned. Her expression immediately changed, because she realized that there was truly such a possibility. But as someone who had worked as an Embroidered Envoy and spy for so many years, she was incredibly strong-willed. She quickly calmed down and said, “Please don’t try to drive a wedge between us. I won’t fall for it.”

“You should get some rest. Don’t think about suicide for now. I won’t order anyone to punish you immediately either,” Zu An said, then got up to leave.

Zhang Zitong was alarmed. She reflexively asked. “Where are you going?”

The Embroidered Envoy had been her home, but now, for her current self, it was no different from a devil’s nest. The only thing that brought her a bit of warmth was this Sir Eleven. If he left, perhaps she would immediately be completely swallowed up in darkness.

“Since you aren’t willing to talk, I can only look for others,” Zu An said with a chuckle. He pushed open the door and walked out.

Xiao Jianren rushed over when he saw him leave. He asked without thinking, “Did you finish?” His face heated up afterward. He really wanted to fan himself.

Zu An was confused. What the heck are you asking? Still, he replied, “How can things be finished that easily? She’s been saved for now. We’ll keep her restrained here. Don’t let anyone get closer to her.”

“Understood!” Xiao Jianren replied with an eager smile. “Sir’s way of saving someone is a bit unique… Judging from how sir is dripping with sweat, you must be exhausted.”

Even though he liked Zhang Zitong, he had merely been infatuated by her beauty and long legs. That was just a man’s instinctive reaction. If one were to ask if he loved her, things definitely hadn’t gone that far. That wasn’t even considering the fact that Zhang Zitong hadn’t returned those feelings at all.

Now that this shocking disaster of a plot against Golden Token Seven’s life had been revealed, he wouldn’t dare to get involved any further. Even though he had felt terrible while waiting in the courtyard, after so much time, he had also thought things through. For Sir Eleven to take Zhang Zitong in was already quite a good conclusion.

After their two years of interactions, he had already been completely won over by Sir Eleven.

“I do feel a bit tired,” Zu An said, not realizing the misunderstanding. After exchanging a few more words, he quickly left.

Xiao Jianren was a bit envious. He wanted to find a chance to properly consult Sir Eleven about just what kind of skill it was that could bring so much pleasure and cure poison.

When she heard what was being said outside the door, Zhang Zitong couldn't help but cover her burning cheeks.

Ah… So embarrassing…

But Sir Eleven really is a warm and gentle person. He still didn’t pressure me in this kind of situation. Just how did someone like that survive in the Embroidered Envoy?

…

Meanwhile, after he left, Zu An went straight to the governor manor. Zhang Jie was a bit surprised by his quick return.

“We’ve hooked a big fish this time,” Zu An said as he picked up a teacup and sipped it. Then, he gave Zhang Jie a rough summary of Zhang Zitong’s identity as a spy.

Zhang Jie was surprised, asking, “Then what can we even get from an interrogation? A spy like her would definitely be extremely cautious. Be careful that she doesn’t end up taking her own life!”

Zu An nodded and said, “She did try to take her own life, but was saved. She didn’t reveal too much even after a day of interrogation. However, it’s fine. I’m going on a trip to request a Truth Talisman from Master Yan’s disciple Miss Xie. I should be able to get what I want from her then. I’ll have to entrust her care to Sir Zhang. Help me ensure the safety of the Embroidered Envoy’s surroundings.”

Zhang Jie’s expression became serious. He said, “Don’t worry, Sir Eleven. These are special circumstances, so I’ll definitely increase the number of personnel to ensure Zhang Zitong’s safety.”

Zu An nodded and said, “I’m pressed for time, so I must leave.” Afterward, he quickly left.

Zhang Jie immediately summoned his subordinates and assigned them security tasks.

Late in the night, Zhang Zitong was curled up on her bed. She had her arms around her legs, a blank look on her face. However, when she heard a light noise outside, she was overjoyed. Had Sir Eleven hurried back?

Suddenly, a black-clad individual rushed in. A glistening blade slashed straight at her.
