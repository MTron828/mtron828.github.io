Chapter 902, Part 2: Alliance

Sang Hong didn’t want to call him ‘Sir Zu again’, but he didn’t know if he would offend Zu An by calling him a worthy junior. That was why he decided to just call him ‘Ah Zu’ to pull their relationship closer together..

Zu An said with a smile, “I don’t understand what Sir Sang is saying. Why would his majesty criticize King Qi?”

Sang Hong chuckled. “I know that you have your misgivings, but you’ve shown tremendous favor to our clan. Our Sang clan only has gratitude toward you, and we’ve always been wondering how to repay you. We’re now in the capital where the various powers are twisted and intertwined. People like us without much of a background should be sticking together and looking out for each other.”

Even though he didn’t know what exactly had happened in the dungeon, it wasn’t hard to guess that King Qi had definitely done something inside. Furthermore, the ones who had come out in the end were Zu An, the crown prince, and the crown princess. That meant King Qi’s plans had failed.

Zu An didn’t keep up the act when he saw that Sang Hong was already going so far. “Uncle Sang, please don’t take offense. The capital is extremely dangerous right now, so I have to be careful with every step I make.”

Zheng Dan couldn't help but roll her eyes when she heard Zu An even call Sang Hong ‘Uncle Sang’. These two had been at each other’s throats just a few months ago, and yet they were now like family? This world really was strange.

Sang Hong said, “We don’t have any grudges between us that can’t be resolved. On the contrary, there are many areas in which we can work together and combine our strengths.”

He had always followed the emperor as a loyal subject with absolute devotion. Yet in the end, he had lost his only son due to an unforeseen event. In the end, it was because the emperor hadn’t hesitated to abandon him. He knew that there was no meaning left in remaining a loyal subject, so that was why he changed his mind.

But he had already offended way too many clans from all the dirty work he had helped the emperor with. There was already practically no place left in the capital for him.

However, Zu An was different. He was a rising star, and he had the Chu clan behind him as well. Furthermore, even his relationship with the Royal Academy didn’t seem to be bad. More importantly, the two of them had already shared joys and sorrows on their way to the capital. To a certain degree, they already carried a somewhat sturdy friendship. That was why Zu An was the one most worthy of his investment right now.

Zheng Dan was quite shocked. The other party was already being sincere, and he was playing along even though he had seen her right here. That meant he had already tacitly approved of her relationship with Zu An! She was happy, and yet also apologetic inside. She subconsciously looked toward Zu An, her eyes filled with pleading. She hoped that Zu An and the Sang clan could retain a good relationship.

Zu An thought for a bit, then smiled. “I’ve benefited greatly from uncle’s advice about the capital’s powers on the way to the capital. I’ll definitely need uncle’s help more and more in the future.”

The previously tense Sang Hong sighed in relief. Zu An had already tacitly accepted their alliance. That meant things would become much easier now.

Zu An didn’t hold back anymore and said, “The question uncle raised just now leaves me puzzled as well. Both sides have already fought for so long, and he had a justifiable reason to eliminate King Qi this time. Why would his majesty instead give up such a great opportunity?”

He actually already had his own answer to that question. He wondered if it was because the emperor had lost a portion of his soul, causing his strength to decline greatly and preventing him from winning against King Qi. But he couldn't tell Sang Hong that and discuss it together with him.

As for the threat of Zhuxie Chixin, Zu An didn’t really care about him at all anymore.

Sang Hong said, “It’s to be expected. Do you know that the capital’s situation has always been extremely tense? The armies are all being transferred in private, and the entire capital is like a bucket of gunpowder. With just a single spark, the entire thing will detonate.

“King Qi has already had many years to plan. His power and influence are great, and almost half of the entire court’s civil and military officials are on his side. If his majesty decides to break off all relations now, everyone related to King Qi will have no choice but to brace themselves and risk it all. That’s a situation his majesty absolutely doesn’t wish to see.”

Zu An hadn’t expected that the two sides were already on the brink of war!

“But is he really going to just let it go like this?” he asked. “With his majesty’s nature, I don’t believe he’s willing to suffer such a loss.”

Sang Hong smiled, but didn’t reply. Instead, he looked at his daughter with a tense expression and asked, “Qien’er, what do you think?”

Sang Qien was caught off guard, but she still replied, “His majesty obviously wouldn’t let things be. If he’s acting according to our predictions, he’s trying to avoid large-scale conflict, but he’ll definitely try to break down the core forces of King Qi’s faction first. Then, he’ll settle the score when there’s an opportune moment.”

She gave Zheng Dan a look, then said, “Furthermore, the part of King Qi’s faction that will bear the brunt of this will be precisely the Qin clan. The Qin clan’s forces are deeply rooted in the military. The reason why his majesty isn’t willing to make a big fuss is also because of the Qin clan.”

Zheng Dan was confused. Why are you looking at me when you’re talking about the Qin clan? Don’t tell me you really think I’m Chu Chuyan?

Zu An quickly asked, “Then how do you think his majesty will act against the Qin clan?”

The Qin clan was Qin Wanru’s original family after all, and they treated Chu Chuyan and Chu Youzhao well. They would definitely feel bad if something really happened to the clan.

Sang Qien shook her head. “We don’t have enough information right now. However, what I can be sure of is that his majesty’s first target will definitely be the Qin clan. Moreover, it won’t be long before he makes his move.”

“Keep going.” Zu An sat up straight as well. Sang Qien’s analysis was extremely important. He didn’t want to miss anything.

“Next will be the Yu clan. If the Qin clan represents military authority, the wealthy Yu clan represents King Qi Manor’s financial power,” Sang Qien continued. “Of course, it might be the Pei clan. After all, the Pei clan has substantial influence in the court’s governmental affairs.”

Yu Yanluo and Pei Mianman appeared in Zu An’s head. He felt a bit of a headache. Why did all of these people he was close to have to be in King Qi’s faction? He shared a huge grudge with that clan’s father and son!

As Sang Qien spoke more about her analysis, Zu An felt that he was benefiting greatly from what she said. He sighed in admiration and said, “Little sister Qien’er really deserves your reputation. You really are a female Zhuge.”[1]

“Who is Zhuge?” Sang Qien was confused. She had already corrected him a few times, and yet Zu AN still called her ‘little sister Qien’er’. She didn’t even feel like commenting on it anymore.

“Um…” Zu An thought for a bit before explaining, “A wickedly intelligent person.”Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Sang Qien’s face turned red. She became a bit bashful as she mumbled, “I’m not that great…”

“Little sister Qien’er is being too humble.” Zu An suddenly found that teasing this girl was pretty fun. She was incredibly mature when it came to political affairs, and yet she was as shy as a young lady on normal topics.

Sang Hong coughed and cut short Zu An’s teasing. “Ah Zu, my status is special, so his majesty might start suspecting me if I chat with you for too long. That’s why, if you have anything you need to talk about, please seek out Qien’er. There are many areas in which she isn’t inferior to me.”

“Sure,” Zu An said with a smile. Chatting with a young lady was obviously more interesting than talking to an old man.

But he suddenly felt a small hand pinch his waist. Zheng Dan said in his ear through ki transmission, “Tsk tsk, that old man is trying to give you two a chance to get together in private.” She was slowly starting to see Sang Hong’s plans. She felt a bit unhappy. She had clearly come here first!

After some hesitation, Sang Hong said, “Right, the Zheng clan started some businesses in the capital, and Zheng Dan has always been busying herself there. It’s not easy for her all on her own. Ah Zu, if you’re willing, please look after her too.”

Sang Qien looked at her father in shock. Even though she’d had her suspicions, she hadn’t expected her father to actually say that out loud!

Even though nothing had been said openly, everyone present was intelligent. They knew what those words implied.

Zheng Dan lowered her head. She was so embarrassed she wanted to run away and hide forever. And yet, she was happy inside too. The mountain weighing down on her mind could now finally be shifted aside.

Zu An had a strange look on his face. He said, “Um… I’ll do what I can to take care of her.”

Sang Hong nodded, then got up, saying, “Alright, I won’t disturb your reunion with your spouse any longer.”

“Why don’t you stay for a bit longer? You can leave after a meal.” Zu An pretended to try to keep them, but how could the father and daughter not know his intentions? They obviously wouldn’t stay.

…

When the two left, Sang Qien secretly asked her father, “Dad, why does Chu First Miss seem a bit strange today?”

Sang Hong nodded. “She was indeed acting a bit strange, as if she was scared of us.”

“Hm? Did you say Chu First Miss?” asked a curious voice from the side.

The two gave each other a look, and saw that a pretty young man was looking at them. Next to him was a tan-skinned young beauty.

“So it was the Chu clan’s young master! We just visited Sir Zu earlier, and we met your sister inside,” Sang Qien replied with a smile. There was no need to hide it. Because of their relationship with Zu An, their friendly relations naturally extended toward the Chu clan.

“My big sis came to the capital?” Chu Youzhao’s eyes lit up. She couldn't be bothered to chat with the two of them anymore and rushed into the house.

Zu An held onto Zheng Dan’s hand while saying, “Dan’er, your father-in-law already gave you to me in public. You don’t have to worry about anything else anymore.”

Zheng Dan harrumphed. “What are you saying? He only asked you to look after me. Stop thinking about such random things.” Despite those words, her heart was pounding.

“Right, something’s really strange. Why didn’t they get upset at all when they saw me? It was almost as if… I really was Chu First Miss.” Zheng Dan was confused. This matter was just way too strange.

Zu An was about to reply when an energetic voice suddenly came from the distance. “Big sis? Big sis?”
