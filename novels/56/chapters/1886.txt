Chapter 1835: Isn’t It Just Mating?

“Just what is really going on?” Zu An exclaimed, panicking.

Dark Jing Teng sighed and said, “The two of us were hit by that being’s attack earlier. It was only due to the protection of the great formation that our souls didn’t disperse on the spot. Still, how powerful was that attack? The fact that we were able to last until now is a miracle in itself.”

When he saw that Jing Teng’s body was flickering unsteadily, Zu An became sullen. He had already used up all of his Freeloader skill uses. If he used Keyboard Come to try and save them, he himself could…

He suddenly looked at the Heavenly Demon-Suppressing Great Formation above and asked, “Then can you enter the talisman to recover? You two come from the same source, and now that the talisman has been restored to its strongest state, it doesn’t need you two to destroy yourselves to repair it.”

Dark Jing Teng shook her head and said, “It won’t work. I already gave it a try earlier. Even though it’s still the Demon-Suppressing Talisman, the talisman can already be considered a whole new thing. It doesn’t recognize our spirits.

“Of course, we do come from the same source, so if we spent more time to become closer to it, we would be able to enter it again. In our current state, though, we probably wouldn’t last that long,” Dark Jing Teng said with a hint of frustration.

Zu An’s expression darkened and he said, “I didn’t expect that keeping you here would only harm you.”

Dark Jing Teng waved her hand dismissively and said, “If you didn’t keep us here, we would already have died. At least we have a bit of life in us to have a conversation.”

Zu An knew that what she said was true, but he couldn't bring himself to feel happy at all.

He quickly took out some treatment medicine and offered it to her, but Dark Jing Teng shook her head after giving them a glance, saying, “That being’s attack is on too high a level. These medicines won’t help at all.”

There was a great deal of destructive power that continued to break down their body. If they hadn’t been born of the divine talisman, thus making them quite extraordinary, they would have lost their lives on the spot.

Zu An was flustered. Could it be that he just had to watch as Jing Teng died?

Just then, a red figure floated over to his side and asked, “Are you really that stupid or are you just pretending?”

When she saw the figure, Dark Jing Teng was startled, exclaiming, “What kind of devil are you?”

Apart from them, anyone else in the room could only be a devil. However, where would anyone find such a stunning devil? She began to think bitterly to herself about the devils on each floor, wondering which one looked closest to the figure.

Mi Li said impatiently, “I am his master.” Her soul was bound to Zu An, which was why she could also resist the demon-suppressing formation.

“Master?” Dark Jing Teng exclaimed in surprise. When she saw Zu An nod, she couldn't help but feel deep veneration. She said, “So it was a senior. The fact that you were able to produce a disciple like this truly is admirable. I wonder what your level of cultivation is?”

Mi Li rolled her eyes and ignored her.

Meanwhile, Zu An asked her what she was talking about. “Master empress, what did you mean by what you said?”

Mi Li looked at him with an ambiguous smile, saying, “Could it be that you’ve already forgotten that the Primordial Origin Sutra can also save others?”

Zu An seemed to have realized something. His face heated up, but then he still shook his head in the end. He said, “It might not be enough. That being is on too high a level. How could an injury it created be healed like that?”

“Is it really that high a level?” Mi Li replied with a snort. “That skill you have isn’t that low-level either. In the end, it’s just because you are too weak. If you were strong enough, there would definitely be no problem saving her with that skill.”

Zu An became quiet. He had thought that he was already pretty good. He had only cultivated for two to three years, and yet he had already grown to his current level. However, only after facing these terrifying creatures did he realize that he was just a frog in a well.

“Don’t worry. Even though you can’t completely restore them with that method, it’ll stabilize their injuries and their lives won’t be at risk anymore. You can slowly look for ways to heal them in the future,” Mi Li said.

Dark Jing Teng couldn't help but ask, “Just what kind of mystery are you two discussing? If there is a way, hurry and save us!”

Zu An was a bit embarrassed. He said, “That method is a bit… a bit… I think you should call out your big sister.”

“Why do I have to bring out my big sister in order to be saved?” Dark Jing Teng replied, looking at him in dissatisfaction. “Is this woman’s life not a life?”

Zu An was speechless. He eventually said, “That method really isn’t suitable for you.”

“How would you know whether it’s suitable or not if you don’t tell me about it?” Dark Jing Teng snapped impatiently. “Why is the man big sister chose so wishy-washy?”

Zu An was stunned. He said, “Call out your big sister first, and I’ll tell both of you.”

Dark Jing Teng shook her head and said, “I can’t wake her. Big sister suffered more of the attacks. She was protecting me, but even so, that being’s attack was just too strong. I was still seriously injured as a result, and will only live a bit longer than big sister. She’s already entered a deep slumber and only has a single breath left in her. She might not be able to wake up.”

Zu An’s expression changed. He didn’t dare to waste any more time. He quickly tried to tactfully explain the Primordial Origin Sutra’s way of aiding people.

“Isn’t it just mating? You’re speaking in such a fancy way for just that? Just do it,” Dark Jing Teng said impatiently.

Zu An was stunned. When he saw how open she was about it and how she even seemed eager to give it a try, he couldn't help but ask, “Could it be… that you don’t fully understand what I just said?”

Dark Jing Teng harrumphed. “This king has dominated this world for so many years. What haven’t I seen before? Do you take me for a fool?” When she saw his strange expression, she said in a carefree tone, “I naturally need to try the things my big sister has tried. She looked as if she had experienced so much bliss that she was about to faint. I have to try it to see if it really is all that. Besides, it can also save my life. Only an idiot would refuse.”

Zu An was speechless. This woman was being so straightforward that he didn’t even know what to do anymore.

“What are you hesitating for? You’re not acting like a man at all.” Dark Jing Teng harrumphed. She hooked her arm around his neck and just kissed him.

Zu An was dumbstruck. If he still refused her at this point, he really would become a joke. The woman was already being so open-minded, but he was the one who was overthinking things instead? Saving Jing Teng was more important, right?

Thus, his arm wrapped around her waist. His other hand reached straight into her collar, thus immediately seizing the initiative.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Dark Jing Teng’s eyes widened, and her breath quickened. When she finally found a chance to catch her breath, she quickly said, “This king wants to be on top!”

“You’re not allowed to!” Zu An quickly replied.

“Sniff… You scoundrel, I’m going to tell on you to big sis later.”

Mi Li shook her head when she saw that. Her figure flashed, and she returned to her special space.

…

Meanwhile, in Immortal Ruler Baopu’s burial room, the women had just applied the medicine Chu Chuyan shared with them, and their injuries had improved considerably.

At that moment, they were gathered in front of the gate. Previously, the entire tomb had been rocking back and forth intensely. Streaks of light flashed past, and the door to the burial room closed again. They were worried that they would be locked in the tomb forever, so they all tried to open the door, but they couldn't find a single point to focus their strength on.

In the end, Yun Jianyue eventually moved over a giant stone pillar from the burial room to ram into the entrance. That way, they could all combine their strength. They carried the thick pillar together and continuously smashed it against the door.

No one could tell what the door was made of, but it was incredibly tough. It didn’t budge at all no matter how they struck it. The women exerted their strength for a long time, but for some reason, this door that had been really easy to open on the way in just wouldn’t open up again. They all used their skills on the stone pillar to continuously bash the tomb opening, trying to find a weakness. They all ended up so tired that sweat dripped down their faces.

After an unknown amount of time, however, the strange light covering the door disappeared. With another strong strike, they successfully smashed through the door, driving the siege weapon-like pillar deeply into it.

Only then did the women discover that the tunnel outside had already caved in because of the previous activity. The falling stones and collapsing earth had made the path extremely narrow and tight.

These women all loved cleanliness. They didn’t want to use their hands to pry apart the stones. And yet, if they used their skills, they feared they could stir things too roughly and cause another collapse. As such, they could only use the pillar to slowly test things out and carve open a path. In that way, they worked together and continued to explore ahead.

“Ah, why is there so much liquid coming out? It’s so sticky, too…” Qiu Honglei cried out in alarm as she dodged to the side.

The women all looked up and saw that some liquid continuously dripped down from the walls around them.

Yun Jianyue said grimly, “We were on ground level when we entered the tomb, but now that we’ve come all the way here, we’ve already arrived underground. All that terrifying shaking might have ruptured an underwater riverbed and caused water to flow in this direction.”

“Then what do we do? If all that water gets in here, won’t we all drown here?” Xie Daoyun asked, her face deathly white.

Yun Jianyue gave Yan Xuehen a look, saying, “Stone cold woman, it’s your turn to shine.”

Yan Xuehen harrumphed. With a wave of her hand, cold air spread out. Soon after, all of the water was frozen. She said gravely, “We need to hurry. This won’t last for long.”

No one dared to treat the situation carelessly. They carried the stone pillar and continued to thrust it forward. After doing that for a long time, the space ahead finally cleared up.

At first, the path was narrow and only had enough room for one person. After a few dozen steps, however, a wide space suddenly appeared before their eyes!
