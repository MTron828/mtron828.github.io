Chapter 1240: Followed

At the same time, Zu An was extremely curious about the weapons. Weren’t they all the legendary Nezha’s weapons?! Why had they ended up with the ocean races? Nezha had messed with the sea, but then after all of that, he had still been captured by the ocean races and had all of his weapons stripped away?

But even though these weapons were heaven-grade and already quite powerful, they were still quite far off from the legendary deity-grade.

His expression suddenly went momentarily blank. The cultivators of this world could all fly and go wherever they wanted. They weren’t that much weaker than the legendary figures from his previous world! Could it be that Nezha really had crossed over to this world, but for some reason, he had ended up dying? In the end, had his weapons also been lost?

Zu An suddenly felt a bit uncomfortable when he thought of that.

…

Meanwhile, Shang Liuyu had already poured out some ki stones and other treasures from the conch. She said, “Chi Wen caused Bluefield Country quite a bit of damage. I’ll have to trouble you to pass on these things to their people.”

Chi Wen was starting to get really upset. Bluefield Country’s fox women couldn't even win against him, so why did they deserve any compensation? Still, Shang Liuyu had already guaranteed things, and there was that reaper Zu An next to her. He didn’t dare to voice any objections.

Zu An was stunned. Judging from her intentions, it seemed like…

“Are you going to leave?” he asked.

Shang Liuyu nodded and replied, “I prefer peace and quiet, so I don’t wish to have any dealings with them. There are all of those female friends of yours too, so meeting them would be annoying.”

Zu An’s face heated up. He indeed did have a bit too many female friends with him.

“There’s not much time left; it’s time for me to leave. We’ll meet again if fate wills it,” Shang Liuyu said. She smiled at Zu An and casually waved her hand. Then, she hooked her slender finger around the wine gourd’s strap, and left in a carefree and easy manner. Her figure gradually faded into the distance.

She hadn’t even given Chi Wen a single look during the entire process, leaving him incredibly downcast. Just who is Auntie closer to?

However, he noticed how absentminded Zu An was as he watched his auntie’s departing figure. He was alarmed, thinking, These two have an affair going on!

I see how it is… I’m an idiot for thinking that auntie was doing this to save me. Looks like she was just using this chance to give all the Dragon King Palace’s treasures to her lover. Preposterous! I’ll definitely report this to my dad once I get back!

You have successfully trolled Chi Wen for +555 +555 +555…

Zu An snapped out of his daze when he saw the Rage points. He gave Chi Wen a cold look, asking, “Do you want to die?”

Chi Wen jumped in fright, thinking, Is this guy a mind reader? He quickly said with an apologetic smile, “I really failed to recognize someone close. If I knew you were my auntie’s partner, I wouldn’t have dared to do anything to you…”

Auntie’s partner? Zu An was a bit dumbfounded by the term. Shang Liuyu had just left, and yet Chi Wen was already selling her out.

However, he didn’t feel like explaining himself. He replied, “Hmph, as a favor for your aunt, I’ll spare you today. I hope you’ll shape up after today.”

Chi Wen chuckled and said, “Auntie’s partner, this is our first meeting. Aren’t you going to give me some blessings?” Now that he knew that there was something going on between Zu An and his aunt, he was no longer that scared.

Zu An’s expression turned cold. This guy had been acting all arrogant before when he was bullying the fox women; it clearly wasn’t the first time. If not for Shang Liuyu, he might have just skinned this guy alive. Yet this guy dared to ask for a gift?

Still, seeing how much this fella had paid up this time, if Zu An didn’t give him a thing, he might instead take his anger out on Shang Liuyu. That wouldn’t be good for Shang Liuyu once Chi Wen went back to the Ocean Races. As such, he opened up the Brilliant Glass Bead. He was about to give him some medicines to help with his injuries, but when he remembered Chi Wen’s deeds, Zu An thought it would be better for him to suffer for a bit. And yet, Zu An really didn’t know what else to give him.

Chi Wen moved over to him. He got up on his tiptoes and looked into the Brilliant Glass Bead. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he said, “That one, I want that one, that blue one.”

The items stored in the Brilliant Glass Bead could vaguely be discerned from the outside.

Zu An had a strange expression as he asked, “Are you sure you want this thing?”

“Yeah, I’m sure,” Chi Wen said. He was worried that Zu An wouldn’t be willing and quickly added, “Auntie’s partner, I gave you so many heaven-grade weapons earlier. If you aren’t even willing to give me this single thing, aren’t you being a bit too selfish?”

That thing sparkled with blue light; it was clearly not an ordinary object.

Zu An’s expression became even stranger as he said, “It’s not that I’m not willing, but rather that I’m scared that you’ll blame me in the future.”

When he saw Zu An’s conflicted expression, Chi Wen thought to himself, Are you trying to fool me like this on purpose?

After all, anything stored in a magical artifact would be precious. That thing looked so mystical, it was definitely extraordinary. As such, he patted his chest and said, “Auntie’s partner, this is where you’re mistaken. The gift of an elder should never be refused. Anything you give me will be good for me, so how can I blame you?”

.

Seeing that Zu An was still hesitating, he grew nervous. He continued, “Once I go back to the Dragon King Palace, my father the king will definitely ask me where all those weapons went. I can’t just say that auntie gave all of them to you, right? You have to give me some kind of gift in return, and only then can I barely explain things in front of my father…”

Zu An gave him the blue chunk of ice after hearing that, but he said, “It really isn’t that I’m not willing, but that this thing isn’t something good.”

It was the ‘Blue Ice From Beyond’ he had gotten recently from the valkyrie gacha! To put it frankly, it was urine and stool that had been processed in an airplane and stored in an ice chunk. Of course, that kind of ice was a bit special and wouldn’t melt that easily.

“It’s fine, it’s fine. What kind of treasures is the Dragon Palace lacking? I just like these kinds of new and novel things,” Chi Wen replied. Inwardly, he thought to himself, Are you still keeping up this act? You’ll have to try harder if you want to fool this prince!

Fearing that the other party might regret it, he seized the chunk of blue ice and fondled it admiringly. He thought to himself that in the past, his father had obtained a stalk of king medicine. He had soaked a bit in water and drank it everyday, extending his life. If he drank this thing every day, his lifespan might catch up to his father’s too!

Zu An was speechless. He could only say helplessly, “If you like it that much, you can just take it. Everyone has a right to decide what they want for themselves.”

Chi Wen’s thoughts were completely focused on the chunk of blue ice; he wasn’t in the mood to talk anymore. He hastily exchanged a few more words before rushing off on his own.

Zu An shook his head. He was definitely not going to eat at the same table as this guy in the future, and he had to remember to remind Shang Liuyu too.

…

After dealing with that matter, Zu An returned to Bluefield Palace. He discovered that the women were all staring at him.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Why are you alone?” Yu Yanluo asked, looking behind him.

“I let him go.” Zu An replied. He added to Tushan Yu, “He’s a relative of my friend; this is the compensation he gave as an apology. I hope the country lord doesn’t take too much offense.” He took out the ki stones and medicines Chi Wen had given up.

Tushan Yu said gently, “It is all thanks to your help this time, so why would I blame you? Furthermore, Chi Wen is a son the Dragon King dotes on. If something really happened to him in Bluefield Country, it would have become a disaster. Letting him go is good too.”

The other three women all raised their eyebrows. This woman really is understanding; no wonder men like her so much.

Then, Tushan Yu tried to refuse the compensation, feeling that it was what Zu An should take. After expending great effort, Zu An finally convinced her to take it all.

Yun Jianyue was getting annoyed. She said, “Damn brat, there’s proper business to talk about. Where’s the other one?”

Zu An was stunned. He asked, “Didn’t I just say I let him go?”

“I’m talking about that friend of yours!” Yun Jianyue replied. SHe added, “Yu Yanluo is too embarrassed to ask about it, so that’s why I’m asking.”

Yan Xuehen subconsciously pricked up her ears. Meanwhile, Yu Yanluo began to panic. They were clearly interested too, so why is all of this being pushed onto me?

Zu An couldn't help but laugh, saying, “It was an old friend from Brightmoon City. She had something to deal with, so she left first.”

“Really?” The three women were all suspicious, but there wasn’t much else they could say.

Tushan Yu said, “Everyone has helped Bluefield Country out a lot, so please stay for a few more days so we can properly repay our guests.”

The women immediately became vigilant. They were about to refuse when Zu An replied first, “That’s fine too. I’ll have to trouble country leader, then.” He wanted to take the chance to see who this woman had been receiving instructions from.

The other three women didn’t know what he was thinking, however. They just assumed he thought Tushan Yu was pretty and that he was infatuated with the fox spirit. All of them became a bit unhappy.

You have successfully trolled Yu Yanluo for +88 +88 +88…

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +88 +88 +88…

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +88 +88 +88…

Zu An felt a headache. I’m definitely only bringing a single woman with me when I go out next time.

…

Then, the Fox race’s people began to repair the destroyed palace. Tushan Yu had her clansmen prepare a banquet to thank Zu An’s party. Tusahn Yu wanted to talk to Zu An several times, but each time, she could only withdraw guiltily when she saw Yu Yanluo and the other two women’s looks.

Zu An wanted to find out what had been going on the previous night, so he used the excuse of relieving himself to leave the banquet. Somewhere in a remote garden, Tushan Yu seemed to have had the same idea, making her way around and rushing over.

Zu An looked at her pretty features that looked innocent, and yett carried a trace of loveliness. He cut right to the point, asking, “Did you approach me on orders from that Hu Qianxiao?”

Tushan Yu was initially all smiles, but when she heard that, her little face immediately turned deathly white.

She was just about to reply when Zu An suddenly frowned, because he could sense that Yu Yanluo and the other two women were walking over from different directions, seemingly looking for him.
