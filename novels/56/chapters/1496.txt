Chapter 1445: Spirit Mountain’s Ten Shamans

“Nuba?” Yu Yanluo and the other women wondered, completely in the dark. That name was extremely unfamiliar to them. They didn’t understand why Xi He suddenly looked as if she were facing a great enemy.

Zu An explained, “Do you still recall the Yellow Emperor that person mentioned? Back then, his most dangerous battle was against Chi You. Back then, Chi You had Rain Master Feng Bo under his command. The great rain and mist left the Yellow Emperor’s troops in a terrible situation. Fortunately, just then, the Yellow Emperor received the help of Nuba.

“Wherever Nuba went, a great drought always followed. That was why the wind and rain stopped, and the Yellow Emperor’s army turned defeat into victory.

“Opinions on Nuba’s origins differ. Some say she was the Yellow Emperor’s daughter, while others say that she was a heavenly woman who descended from above.”

Zu An couldn't help but curse inwardly as he said that. Who the hell said all fairies were pretty?

The three women suddenly realized the problem. Anyone who could join a battle on the scale of Yellow Emperor and Chi You, and furthermore be a deciding factor in its victory and defeat, was definitely terrifyingly strong.

…

Nuba’s aura suddenly surged. The few trees that still remained had already been struggling at death’s door under the power of ten suns. Now, they all began to burn. As for the flowers and grass, they instantly completely withered into nothing. The entire landscape turned into an expanse of arid, cracked yellow earth. Even the distant sea began to boil, and the ocean waters began to evaporate and recede at a visible rate.

As she charged at the Golden Crows, Nuba’s entire figure began to glow red. Soon afterward, light erupted again. Large amounts of golden blood and feathers scattered down from the air.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Xi He was shocked and furious. She took the golden war chariot and rushed over to help. However, because of that, Zu An’s group was placed in a tough situation. They were almost completely blinded by the powerful radiance, and the extreme heat burned them.

Perhaps out of concern that they would be burned to death, or perhaps because she was focused on facing Nuba, Xi He withdrew the golden light that was binding them.

Zu An took the chance to hold Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue’s hands. He used the Snow Phoenix’s power to frantically use the Snowflake Sword, providing them with much-needed relief. In addition, Yan Xuehen also considerately held their hands, as she cultivated the true Snowflake Sword. She quickly adjusted her aura to match Zu An’s, creating a degree of balance between the four of them.

…

Meanwhile, the conflict soon reached its climax. Even Xi He was wounded. Nuba wasn’t in a good state either, but the red radiance only shone even more blindingly around her.

After some time, Xi He suddenly called out, “Use the Great Sun Formation!”

The ten Golden Crows tacitly understood what she was saying. They quickly stood in formation, then released golden light from their bodies, focusing it on Nuba.

Nuba screamed bitterly. The red light emanating from her entire body became even fiercer, and she also released a terrifying aura. Zu An was alarmed, as Nuba’s aura was reminiscent of a nuclear reactor, and one that was going out of control, at that. The red radiance surrounding Nuba’s body became more and more ferocious, to the point that it was even more dazzling than a sun. It was clear that she couldn't even control herself anymore.

Then, her body turned into a ball of light that exploded. At that moment, a mushroom cloud even seemed to rise into the air, accompanied by a devastating shockwave.

Xi He groaned, coughing out a large mouthful of blood and flying backward. Even the golden war chariot was a bit deformed from the impact. The six dragons that pulled the carriage cried out miserably. Their bodies were covered in terrifying injuries, and it was unclear whether they were even still alive.

The powerful impact also threw Zu An and the others out of the golden war chariot. Xi He was shocked. She instinctively wanted to save Zu An, but her injuries were so serious that she couldn't even muster any strength. She could only watch as they fell, disappearing into the endless smoke and dust.

Fortunately, most of the impact was blocked by Xi He, the six dragons, and the golden war chariot. Meanwhile, Zu An and the others had been linked together to resist the heat. They actually managed to successfully block the terrifying blast waves. Even though they all coughed up blood, they weren’t too injured.

Yun Jianyue was a bit absent-minded. What had just happened was practically a once-in-a-lifetime event. After all, in the world of warriors, even if it were one’s own parents or siblings, practically no one would trust their comrades to such an extent, releasing all their defenses.

As long as another person had sinister motives, even if one didn’t die, one would immediately be left with serious injuries. That was why, even among family members, it was rare to see anyone achieve what Zu An’s group had just done.

And yet, they had managed to display such unconditional trust. To think she had previously been arch-enemies with that stone cold woman; they had been rivals who wished each other dead!

After fighting Yan Xuehen for so many years, even though she really couldn't accept many of her ways, she still trusted the other woman’s character. The fact that the other woman hadn’t done anything bad to her at that moment was understandable.

However, she had actually given up on taking advantage of the situation herself, and she didn’t even feel any regret about it at all!

What in the world is going on? When did I start becoming like this?

Her gaze shifted to Zu An. It seemed as if everything had changed after she met this man.

Zu An instantly summoned the Wind Fire Wheels. He grabbed the people around him and tried to fly away. However, the powerful shockwave made it hard for him to control his balance. Soon afterward, the group lost their center of gravity and began to plummet.

Fortunately, Zu An worked hard to control their descent, so they weren’t too far from the ground. Even so, the fall wasn’t light. Zu An gritted his teeth, then turned around to use his own body as a cushion. He took the three women into his arms and slammed into the ground.

With a huge noise, a human-shaped crater appeared in the ground. Zu An felt as if all his internal organs had shifted positions. Blood spurted out of his mouth.

The three women quickly got up. With Zu An acting as their cushion, even though they still had suffered under the impact, with their cultivation, they could still tolerate it. They examined his injuries while crying out in alarm.

“Why are you so foolish? With our cultivation, we wouldn’t die from a fall like this!” Yu Yanluo said, half-sobbing as she wiped the blood from Zu An’s mouth.

Zu An showed her a grin with great difficulty, saying, “All of you were created so wonderfully by this world. If your faces were tarnished, or if you lost a limb, that would be this world’s greatest regret.”

Now, let alone Yan Xuehen, not even Yun Jianyue could take it anymore. Her face heated up as she scoffed, “Look at you! Do you know what kind of situation we’re in? And yet you’re still trying to swindle women with your flowery words!”

“Stop talking!” Yan Xuehen snapped in annoyance and embarrassment. She quickly helped Zu An treat his injuries. At the same time, she sighed inwardly, thinking, No wonder he has so many beauties at his side.

Just how many women in this world could refuse a man who was willing to risk their life for them?

Zu An chuckled and replied, “Don’t worry, my skin is pretty thick. I won’t die.”

Yu Yanluo had a somewhat helpless expression, mixed with a hint of regret. Suddenly, the look on her face changed and she said, “That Xi He seems to be coming over.”

They could vaguely make out Xi He and her carriage amid the smoke and dust. She seemed to be looking around for something. When she saw Zu An’s group, her eyes immediately lit up.

Zu An felt discouraged. It would be dangerous if they fell into this woman’s hands again, especially now that she had the ten Golden Crows with her. He wouldn’t necessarily be able to protect the three girls.

Just then, ten more powerful auras suddenly rushed over. He was stunned. The auras didn’t seem to be the Golden Crows!

“Mother, Spirit Mountain’s ten shamans are here. We need to hurry and leave!” the Golden Crows called out as they flew over to Xi He’s side; their remaining feathers were sparse and blood was all over their bodies. They had clearly been injured quite badly from the explosion.

Xi He gave Zu An a reluctant look, but in the end, she was still worried about her sons’ safety and steered the carriage away hurriedly.
