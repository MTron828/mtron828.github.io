Chapter 1404: Black Emperor’s Descendant

“Who said that?” Zu An and the others called out, suddenly looking up. They looked all around them, but they didn’t see anyone present no matter where they looked.

They exchanged a look, seeing the grave expressions on each other’s faces. In truth, they were already some of the most powerful experts in the world. Their perception of their surroundings was incredibly sharp. Normally, not even the movement of a single blade of grass would escape their perception. And yet, the voice had emerged without any warning. They were completely unable to locate the source of it, before or after it spoke.

That meant the voice’s cultivation was far above their own. They would be in great danger if this individual had evil intentions.

“Hm? You even have the skills of the White Emperor lineage, so why would you be afflicted with the Puppet Curse?” the voice wondered, seemingly full of confusion.

“Who are you?” Zu An called out. He looked around vigilantly at his surroundings because the voice hadn’t come from a single direction; rather, it seemed to come from all directions. He couldn't locate its exact position at all.

“Who am I?” The voice seemed to be a bit surprised as it repeated, “Right, who am I? Who exactly am I?”

Zu An and the women looked at each other in dismay. This voice seemed to have something wrong with its head. As such, they gestured toward each other, deciding that they had to leave this weird place as quickly as possible.

The voice suddenly said, “I remember who I am. I feel so much hatred!”

Zu An’s expression changed slightly. The level of hatred that filled the air meant the voice could be considered a malicious spirit even in his previous world! He thought, I have to quickly put some oil on the bottom of my feet.

“Could it be that you don’t want to get rid of the Puppet Curse?” the voice asked.

Forget about Zu An, even Yan Xuehen, Yun Jianyue, and Yu Yanluo couldn't help but stop then. The Puppet Curse was related to Zu An’s life and death. If it couldn’t be removed, even if they left the Unknown Region alive, he would still be the Fiend Emperor’s slave. At that point, he would probably be better off dead than alive.

Zu An knew that Mi Li could only borrow the Unknown Region’s chaotic laws to temporarily seal off the Puppet Curse. Once they returned to the normal world, her methods likely wouldn’t be useful.

“There are no free lunches in this world. What do you want?” Zu An asked cautiously.

“There are no free lunches in this world?” The voice repeated that sentence. It seemed to be entertained as it continued, “That sentence is quite amusing. Why don’t you come to the foot of the mountain first?”

Zu An was hesitant, but the voice said, “Don’t worry. Since you have the White Emperor’s Puppet Curse on you, that means that we share a common enemy. You don’t need to worry about me harming you.”

Zu An had never been the type to be overly cautious to begin with. When he heard that, he decided to head over and take a look.

He warned the three women to stay away first, but Yan Xuehen said, “We should go together. If there is any danger, we will be able to face it together.”

Zu An felt warm inside, thinking, It seems that even though she normally treats me with that indifferent demeanor, she actually still cares a lot about me.

When she sensed his fiery gaze, Yan Xuehen’s face heated up a bit. She turned around and didn’t look at him anymore. However, Yun Jianyue and Yu Yanluo were worried about the mysterious being, so they didn’t notice the other two’s gazes.

Just like that, they began to be guided along by the voice. They soon arrived at the foot of the giant mountain in front of them. Only then did they notice that there was a simple cave entrance there.

Zu An stopped, maintaining some distance from the entrance. He said, “I’m already here, so if you have something to say, please say it.”

Who knew if there was another damned old freak who wanted to possess his body or something? Ever since he had been schemed against by Old Mi, that mental shadow had always loomed over him.

As if it ‘saw’ the women at Zu An’s side, the voice said with a sigh of amazement, “I had a few beauties close to me back then too, sigh…” It seemed to be full of disappointment and frustration.

Zu An cursed inwardly, So it was just another old pervert. Wait, why did I say another?

Yun Jianyue couldn't hold herself back from asking, “You said you could undo the Puppet Curse?”

The voice said, “The Puppet Curse is one of the ultimate skills of the White Emperor lineage. It’s very difficult to undo.”

Yun Jianyue’s eyes widened as she exclaimed, “Were you messing with us?”

She was knowledgeable herself. Even though the mysterious voice’s cultivation realm was extremely terrifying, if it really was so formidable, there would be no need for it to call them over at all. It could just use its skills to forcibly bring them over.

When she saw the cave, it only made her more confident in her suspicions. The voice had probably been trapped there for some reason, and that was why they were called over. As long as they were careful, there likely wouldn’t be too much danger.

“I merely said that it was very difficult. I didn’t say I couldn't get rid of it,” the voice replied.

The voice was making things more complicated for no reason, so Zu An didn’t want to be led by the nose either. As such, he took the initiative to ask calmly, “What was that White Emperor thing you mentioned about?”

The Puppet Curse on him had clearly been applied by the Fiend Emperor. Why was this guy talking about a White Emperor?

“Before I explain that, answer me first. Why do you know the White Emperor lineage’s Heaven Devouring Sutra and Phoenix Nirvana Sutra?” the voice asked.

The three women looked at Zu An. They knew some of the skills he had, but this was the first time they had heard about both of those skills. Furthermore, how was it related to the White Emperor?

Zu An was also confused. He replied, “I don’t even know who the White Emperor is, so why would I know his skills?”

This person really was mysterious; he could actually sense Zu An’s Heaven Devouring Sutra and Phoenix Nirvana Sutra! However, Zu An thought, Huh, why can’t he sense the Primordial Origin Sutra?

“Judging from that slow-looking demeanor of yours, you don’t seem to be cunning and treacherous like those White Emperor descendants, so you’re probably not one of them,” the voice said, thinking aloud.

Zu An was speechless. He cursed inwardly, You’re the slow one! Your entire family is slow!

The voice said slowly, “A long, long time ago, my ancestor, the Yellow Emperor, dominated all challengers, defeating outstanding individuals throughout the world. He was publicly acknowledged as the emperor.”

The other three women thought he was just talking about a normal emperor, so they didn’t think too much of it.[1]

However, Zu An was shaken up. Is this ‘the’ Yellow Emperor? Is it the same one I remember?

“When the Yellow Emperor ascended, he passed on his throne to his son, Shao Hao. He was known as the White Emperor,” the voice continued.

“Ascended? What do you mean ‘ascended’?” Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen exclaimed. Let alone Yu Yanluo, they were both stunned. They were just as confused as the Fiend Emperor had been. In their cultivation realm, they cared more about the pursuit of immortality than anything else. The so-called ascension and transcendence were things that had only existed in legends. They hadn’t truly seen it before.

“It refers to someone ascending and becoming an immortal, of course,” the voice said, sounding a bit strange. It asked, “Is it really something that surprising?”

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen were both speechless. This guy really knows how to act! Judging from his tone, however, it didn’t seem that he was showing off on purpose.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The voice continued, “After the White Emperor ascended, because of his son’s unworthiness, the throne was passed onto his nephew, my ancestor Zhuan Xu. He was known by the people as the Black Emperor. He succeeded the throne properly, but the White Emperor’s descendants have always felt as if the Black Emperor used some kind of scheme to seize the throne. From then on, they always hated the Black Emperor’s lineage.”

Zu An cursed inwardly to himself. The Black Emperor had been the winner there, so of course they felt that it was natural. Meanwhile, the other side had seen that the throne wasn’t passed down to the son, but to the nephew, so they had every reason to think that something was fishy.

The voice continued, “After the Black Emperor ascended, it was supposed to be his son who took the throne, but unfortunately, the White Emperor’s lineage Jun took back the throne. The world knows him as Dijun.”

Zu An was a bit moved. He hadn’t actually known that much about the Black Emperor and White Emperor, but Dijun was extremely famous, especially in various Eastern fantasy novels. Dijun was a super huge boss-level existence!

“After the White Emperor lineage seized the throne, they suppressed our Black Emperor faction greatly. That wasn’t all, though; they even wantonly slandered us,” the voice said with a hint of hatred. “For example, three of the Black Emperor’s sons were plague demons. One was known as the malaria demon, one was the goblin demon, and the last was the child demon. Another son was known as the worst of villains. After he died, his resentment became known as one of the Four Perils. Truly absurd!”

Zu An’s expression was strange. He had thought that those things were just lesser demons, but their father was actually the Black Emperor, Zhuan Xu? However, he asked calmly, “Do you want me to help you defeat the White Emperor?”

“No. Even though the White Emperor’s lineage is hateful, as we’re from different factions, their unscrupulous means are understandable,” the voice said coldly. “On the contrary, those who betray the same faction are the most hateful. The one I hate is someone who’s also from the Black Emperor’s faction!”

1. ’Emperor’ sounds the same as ‘Yellow Emperor’. ☜
