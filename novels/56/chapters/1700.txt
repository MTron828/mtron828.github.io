Chapter 1649: Proud Yun Jianyue

“What are you crying about? It’s not as if he’s dead!” Yun Jianyue cried out as she slammed the table and stood up too.

At the same time, she sneered inwardly. You still haven’t seen a truly merciless scene. If this weren’t a daoist competition, that guy would already have been chopped up into eight pieces. There’s no way he would have gotten away with just some injuries.

Zu An was alarmed. Why does this Elder Peng’s personality seem a bit similar to big sis Yun’s? However, he laughed inwardly. He really did have quite the imagination. Big sis Yun was way prettier than this woman, after all.

The main reason no one took that possibility seriously was because this was clearly a gathering of the orthodox faction. If those two from the Devil Sect arrived, wouldn’t they just be throwing their lives away?

Wang Wuxie had a huge headache. What was going on today? The judges were fighting even more aggressively than the competitors. Were they going to start another conflict?

He was about to say something when a low and deep voice called out from below, “Elder, I haven’t lost yet.”𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The spectators turned around and saw that Liang Ling, who had been lying flat on the stage, slowly stood back up. There was a layer of flames surrounding his entire body.

When the Kunlun Void Sect Elder saw that, his expression immediately changed. He cried out, “You absolutely must not!”

At the same time, however, there was a huge explosion as Liang Ling’s entire body erupted into flames. His aura, which had become extremely weak, surged once more; additionally, all his wounds quickly healed at a visible rate.

The sect masters watching sighed. With their knowledge and experience, they naturally recognized that this was Kunlun Void Sect’s ultimate skill, Inferno Rebirth. Through igniting their blood essence, they could quickly recover in a short amount of time.

Even though the effects were powerful, however, the cost was just as severe. After using the skill, one would be lucky to get away with only serious injuries. Some users even died or became crippled. Furthermore, even if one recovered, there was a chance of it affecting one’s upper limit. As such, the skill was normally never used, except by those who knew they were going to die. And yet, Liang Ling had used it in the current situation. Even if he won, there was no way he could fight in the next round.

Kunlun Void Sect’s Elder Xuan Dou struck his thigh and continued, “Sigh, why did you have to go that far? Did you lose your mind?”

Liang Ling had a resolute expression as he said, “I can lose, but I won’t lose that easily.” As he looked at Qiu Honglei, his eyes were filled with high-spirited fighting intent.

…

Even Zu An couldn't help but feel some admiration when he saw that.

Though there were all sorts of mediocre individuals in this competition, there were also quite a few excellent youngsters. For example, this Liang Ling was a bit hot-headed, but his unyielding nature proved that he was a real man through and through. The nine daoist sects were part of the righteous faction, and the disciples they had raised had some skill, as expected.

“As you wish!” Qiu Honglei replied, putting away her carefree smile. With her short blades in hand, her figure turned into afterimages as she rushed at Liang Ling.

Liang Ling didn’t retaliate with his spear; instead, he turned his entire body into a blazing tornado of fire. Scarlet flames appeared all around him, and burned the entire stage until its surface became a dark red. Streaks of red veins ran across the ground like lava.

Qiu Honglei seemed to have been burned. She quickly kicked off the ground to cancel her charge and jumped back. However, the giant flame tornado at the center scattered into several smaller pillars of flame, attacking the surrounding area.

Even though the place was protected by formations, the arena’s stage still turned into a sea of fire. No matter how outstanding Qiu Honglei’s movement skill was, she still had nowhere to go. Helpless to do anything else, she could only fly into the air.

Liang Ling seized the opportunity and rushed into the air, surrounded by flames. His opponent hadn’t reached the master rank yet, so her mobility was greatly reduced in the air.

Just then, the flames flooded the entire arena. The formation flickered rapidly, clearly under tremendous pressure. It was doing everything it could to prevent the battle from affecting the spectators around the stage.

The whole stage was like a volcano on the verge of erupting. There was crimson lava everywhere, and the air inside was quickly burning up. There was nowhere to run inside the arena.

Amid the flames, Qiu Honglei’s figure just looked insignificant, as if she would be swallowed up at any time.

Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s Cai Yu said with a sigh, “As expected of Kunlun Void Sect’s representative disciple, this level of skill is on a different level. Emptiness Isle’s ugly woman might be defeated.”

Zhi Yin’s expression became grim. Even though this Liang Ling was formidable, the current result had only been achieved because of Inferno Rebirth activating his potential. If he were the one on the stage, all he would have to do was hold out until Liang Ling used up all of his strength. Winning wouldn’t be too difficult. He would even have been able to use both the Push of the Iron Mountain and the Shadowless Ball to attack from the very start. That way, Liang Ling wouldn’t have had a chance to use his ultimate move. However, there was no such opportunity left for him after his loss in the group stage.

When he remembered the cause of all that, he stared hatefully at the distant Jadefall Palace’s Pei Mianman.

It’s all this woman’s fault!

However, when he saw her expansive chest and her eyes that looked as if they could smile, he discovered that he couldn't bring himself to be mad at her at all.

Sigh, I didn’t expect the daoist sects to have another being on the same level as Fairy Chu in both looks and cultivation. It would have been great if I just hadn’t underestimated my opponent from the beginning.

After thinking things over, he felt that there was no way he would lose if they fought again. But the more he thought about that, the more depressed he felt.

…

Suddenly, a powerful wave of light flashed into existence. Many people couldn't help but close their eyes. They screamed, “What the heck? I can’t see anything!”

In the air, Qiu Honglei’s entire body erupted with blinding light, making her look like a sun.

The sect masters all sat up. This seemed to be a blinding skill from the light element. Because the light element was so rare, many of them had only read about it in certain texts. Now that they were able to see it for themselves, there was no way they would give up such an opportunity. Even though the blinding light made all of their disciples cover their tear-filled eyes, with their cultivation, it naturally didn’t have too much of an effect on the sect masters.

However, that didn’t apply to Liang Ling. Even though he was surrounded by tornadoes of fire, he had been watching Qiu Honglei the whole time. In that instant, the damage the powerful light inflicted against him was greater than what the spectating disciples suffered. He felt a wave of stinging pain, and a vast expanse of white temporarily robbed him of his sight.

That was no small matter. He could only send his flames in the direction he remembered his opponent had been in. However, why would Qiu Honglei be foolish enough to remain in the same place? She quickly appeared behind Liang Ling, and the blades in her hands crossed. A 乂 shaped blade of light shot out.

“Holy Cross Slash?” someone exclaimed, recognizing the origins of the move. That light condensed from sword ki could slice through metal and jade alike. It was incredibly sharp.

Liang Ling finally noticed that something was strange. He quickly summoned flames behind him, but he was still a bit too late.

Boom!

The light crashed down on the spiraling pillar of fire. The terrifying flames were actually torn apart directly. The raging flames seemed to be suppressed by something, and clearly became much smaller. Liang Ling’s true self also appeared from within the flames as he quickly tried to defend himself with his spear.

Blinding radiance flickered, and he was knocked out of the sky. There were clear marks left on the spear, and his hands were drenched with blood as well. The clothes in front of his chest were torn apart, revealing a deep wound beneath them.

“Do you still want to continue?” Qiu Honglei asked with a smile.

The expressions of those present turned strange. This woman was clearly ugly, but her movements almost seemed like those of an exceptional beauty. At first, they found it a bit revolting. But as they continued to watch her, they found her more and more charming.

Is this the so-called power of the strong?

Liang Ling remained silent on the ground for a while. In the end, he said in an extremely bitter tone, “There’s no need. Thank you for being lenient; I’ve lost.”

He previously thought that he had lost because he was careless and let himself be ambushed. He clearly still had many stronger moves that he hadn’t used yet; losing during a once in a decade competition, just like that, had been too hard to accept. That was why he had recklessly used Inferno Rebirth.

However, as the fight continued, he had discovered that this woman was actually profound and incomprehensible. Anyone who could become a representative disciple definitely wasn’t stupid. He knew that the cost of Inferno Rebirth would grow greater and greater if he continued to fight, and his chances of victory were low. What reason was there left in continuing?

Wu Xiaofan, Wan Guiyi, and the other representative disciples carefully sized up Qiu Honglei. This woman was stronger than they had imagined.

As Liang Ling had admitted defeat, Elder Xuan Dou couldn't really say anything. He quickly rushed out to feed Liang Ling some of the Kunlun Void Sect’s medicines.

Meanwhile, Wang Wuxie and the other sect masters looked at Yun Jianyue with conflicted expressions, remarking, “Emptiness Isle usually remains secluded, but when they do make an appearance, they really dazzle the world.”

After all, in the past, Emptiness Isle’s sole purpose seemed to have been to make the other sects look better. And yet, this disciple seemed to be ridiculously strong! Liang Ling didn’t even seem to have pushed her to the limit yet.

“I agree, I agree~” When she saw these orthodox sect representatives who normally cursed her to death now praising her, Yun Jianyue felt like someone who had found a watermelon ice in the middle of the desert. She wondered just what kind of expression they would show her if they took the crown and revealed who they really were! She almost laughed out loud when she thought about how her scheme would turn these daoist sects into a laughingstock.

“As we have already decided the top four, we will rest for a day and carry out the semifinals the day after tomorrow,” Wang Wuxie remarked.

Just like that, the day’s competition came to an end. The disciples excitedly discussed the previous matches. Many of them ran over to Emptiness Isle to curry favor with them. Now that they had such a formidable disciple, Emptiness Isle would no longer be the weakest in the future. It was a place worthy of their shows of goodwill.

Yun Jianyue normally hated this kind of social interaction the most, but at the moment, she was actually delighted. After all, the more enthusiastic these people were, the more interesting their reactions would become once the truth was revealed.

Her tail was practically about to point to the sky when Yan Xuehen suddenly appeared in front of her, saying, “You are very similar to an acquaintance of mine.”
