Chapter 700: Intentional Trouble

Translator: Pika

Zu An shook his head. “As a man, how can I hide under another person’s protection forever? Even though the capital is dangerous, it is also full of opportunities.”

Chu Chuyan looked sad. “I know. You’re still blaming us for abandoning you back then. But I wasn’t in Brightmoon City back then, or else I would’ve definitely stopped this from happening!”

Zu An pulled her soft body closer to himself. “You’re thinking too much. Your father and mother treated me very well. They only made that choice because there was no other way. They actually secretly helped me escape, so why would I hate them?”

Chu Chuyan was shocked. “I can understand if you don’t hate my father. However, I thought you and my mother never got along?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Zu An sighed. “Many things happened between your mother and me after you left. The past grudges are already completely gone.”

“What happened between the two of you?” Chu Chuyan was confused. Why did these words sound so strange? “Also, my mother keeps asking me about you from time to time. She would never care much about what happened to you before.”

Zu An’s face heated up. “It's nothing much. Your amazing husband helped her stop the Chu clan’s rebellion and saved your dad. After that, her opinion of me naturally improved.”

Chu Chuyan smiled and pressed her cheeks gently against his chest. “You’re right.”

But there was still worry on her face. “King Qi is at the Grandmaster rank, and what’s even more terrifying are the forces under his command. He has more than half of the court under him, and not even the emperor could do much to him. It’ll be way too dangerous for you in the capital now that you’ve offended him.”

“Don’t worry, I’m not alone. I still have the emperor behind me. Furthermore, with the crown prince and crown princess’ support, at least on the surface, he cannot act against me. He can only scheme in the background. However, I have some strength myself now. What can they even do against me?”

In terms of scheming, who can win against me?

Chu Chuyan remembered how not even Han Fengqiu, who was at the peak of the ninth rank, could take him out, so she knew that he had enough strength to protect himself. She thus calmed down a bit. However, she soon realized another problem. “The crown princess? Why would the crown princess help you? Could it be that you and her…”

Zu An couldn’t help but chuckle. “My Chuyan is jealous. How in the world did you come to that conclusion? What kind of status does the crown princess have? You are suspecting that something happened between me and her?”

Chu Chuyan’s face turned red with shame. She felt like it was ridiculous as soon as the words left her mouth. This was the crown princess, the future mother of the nation! Why would she do anything foolish with another man?

“It’s all your fault for messing around with Yu Yanluo. Who would’ve thought that you and the capital’s number one beauty had a connection?” She harrumphed to hide her embarrassment.

Zu An laughed. “What can I say? I’m just too charming of a man.”

Chu Chuyan: “……”

Even though what he said was true to a certain extent, Chu Chuyan still felt like he really deserved a good beating.

Zu An’s expression suddenly became serious. “Oh, right. From what you’ve just said, it sounds like you’re going back to Brightmoon City?”

Chu Chuyan bit her lip and nodded her head. “Yeah. I already stayed in the capital for a long time because of the account book. Then, I was moving around because of you. I never returned to Brightmoon City all this time. The Chu clan has survived its worst crisis, but regardless of whether it is the emperor or King Qi, they won’t stop here. Furthermore, the Chu clan has suffered a great blow after experiencing those tribulations one after the next. There are too many things that need to be taken care of. The Chu clan might even really collapse if I don’t return to pacify the people.”

Chu Zhongtian already gradually placed most of the authority of the Chu clan into her hands over the years. She was the one who managed the operations of the Chu clan. If she was missing at this crucial time, then it would indeed be dangerous for the Chu clan.

Zu An sighed and said, “Even you are leaving me. Everyone is leaving…”

These close friends of his were leaving one after the next. He already experienced enough of this pain.

If Chu Chuyan left as well, then even if this capital was bustling with activity, it would still be nothing more than a lonely prison for him.

Chu Chuyan pursed her lips when she sensed his sadness. “Ah Zu, even though I have decided to return to Brightmoon City, I’m not leaving immediately. I’ll stay in the capital with you a while longer.”

Zu An immediately became happier. He hugged her and said, “Haha, it’s still my wife who is the best.”

Chu Chuyan playfully hit his chest. “You’re making it sound like you know other people’s wives.”

Zu An laughed and said, “Why would I love and pamper anyone else’s wives?”

Chu Chuyan just felt like his words were strange. Before she could ask more about it, her expression changed, because he went on the offensive once more. “Ah Zu, stop…”

She still hadn’t fully recovered after their last session.

How could Zu An still hold on when he saw the usually cold and aloof goddess beg for mercy? He carried her over to the window.

“Where do you come up with all of this…” Chu Chuyan was embarrassed and nervous. She always felt like this fella was a bit too experienced.

Zu An obviously wouldn’t reply to a death question like this. He might be able to talk glibly in other situations, but right now, actions were much more useful.

Chu Chuyan frowned tightly at first, as if she was enduring something. However, her brows quickly loosened up, and her expression became sweet again…

…

The next morning, Chu Chuyan helped Zu An get dressed with tender feelings. She really looked like a gentle and soft young wife.

Chu Youzhao was off to the side with dark circles around her eyes. She gloomily watched as the two of them acted all lovey dovey around each other.

It’s all big sis’ fault that I had to stay out all night. Thank goodness I came out with big sis, or else my grandfathers would have already sent out people to look for us.

But this really was strange. The two of them had tossed and turned all night, yet they both looked extremely energetic, while I’m the one who’s all haggard.

Her big sister in particular, was practically glowing! Even she, as a girl, was staring blankly in awe.

She understood her big sis’ beauty extremely well. However, her big sis was usually rather cold, but she now looked extremely captivating. Was this still her same big sister?

…

When Zu An left to report for morning roll call, Chu Chuyan also brought her younger sister to the Qin clan.

Along the way, Chu Youzhao kept looking at her big sister. Chu Chuyan was confused. “What are you doing?”

Chu Youzhao had a weird look on her face. “Big sis, aren’t you walking kind of weird?”

Chu Chuyan was stunned. “Am I?”

“Yeah.” Chu Youzhao nodded with a serious expression. She gestured with her fingers. “Your legs used to be like this, but now, they’re like this. They look like they’re a bit more separated than usual.”

“You’re seeing things!” Chu Chuyan’s face became entirely red. How can they not be separated? After being tormented for an entire night, she was already used to Zu An’s shape. That guy’s is just a bit too…

Chu Youzhao said quietly, “Also, big sis, can you guys not do it by the window sill? You’ll end up disturbing other people’s rest, you know?”

She ran away after saying this.

Chu Chuyan finally couldn’t take it anymore. “You brat, stop right there!”

…

While the two sisters were bickering with each other, Zu An already arrived at the imperial palace.

He was just about to head inside when a young official stopped him. “Your uniform is not orderly. Step back!”

Zu An was stunned. “Who the hell are you?”

What the fuck? Chu Chuyan helped me sort out my clothes today, and I’ve never even dressed this orderly before. You dare claim that my clothes are messy?

He had never seen this person before him before. He looked to be in his early thirties. He had a decent appearance, and together with the mustache above his lips, he did look quite scholarly.

“This official is the Assistant Minister of the Huang gate. Our posts have been rotated today, and I am in charge of observing the bearing of all officials.” This official said proudly.

Zu An was baffled. Was King Qi already getting revenge on him so quickly?

But he didn’t want to give the other party anything to take advantage of, so he endured his dissatisfaction and asked, “May I ask sir which part of my uniform is not orderly?”

The official with the beard said indifferently, “If I say that your clothes are not orderly, then they are not orderly. Go off to the side and sort them out by yourself. Stop loitering here, blocking other officials from entering.”
