Chapter 1580 – Internal Psychological Warfare

Xie Daoyun’s eyes widened. She really hadn’t had many chances to see Zu An fight. However, as someone from a prestigious family, she still had good judgment. Still, she couldn't really figure out what type of attack it was. Even so, she was incredibly shocked.

At first, Scarface Yang Shen had an expression of contempt because Zu An didn’t have any ki aura whatsoever. The only thing noticeable about him was that he was somewhat handsome. However, when Yang Shen saw the scene, his expression immediately changed. He roared, “Retreat! All of you, retreat right now!”

In that instant, he felt his entire body tremble. In all the years he had spent doing as he pleased, this was the first time he had felt such a thing. Unfortunately, his subordinates were all excitedly charging toward their ‘spoils of war’. How could they still hear him?

Just then, Zu An didn’t forget to ask Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang, “Is this the Devil Sect’s rebel army?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The pair’s jaws practically dropped to the ground when they saw the display in the air. When they heard the question, they reflexively shook their heads and replied, “No, they are the Twin Dragon Mountains bandit group.”

When Zu An saw the injuries on Xie Daoyun and the damage sustained by the Armed Escort Division, he had already been quite unhappy. It didn’t seem like the work of a righteous army that was fighting for their freedom and beliefs. Now that he heard that they had nothing to do with the Devil Sect, however, he wasn't worried about hurting Yun Jianyue or Qiu Honglei’s feelings.

As such, he just released the Blue Luan Sword Formation. After all, he now had the Rune Weapon Chart to make copies of many weapons. Even though their power didn’t match up to real heaven-grade weapons, they were perfect for such an area-of-effect attack.

Swords flew forth like streaks of golden light, resembling a barrage of missiles that crashed into the rebel army’s ranks. Each one exploded in a radius of over a dozen meters, and there were thousands of the swords.

…

After the purge of firepower, only a blasted, empty circle remained in front of the Armed Escort Division. There were no corpses or blood, only an uneven pit in the ground.

The rear guard of the rebel army blinked. Where had their comrades, who had charged ahead, gone? Only after a while did they realize the answer. They all screamed and ran for their lives, moving even faster than when they had previously charged forth.

The rebel army wasn’t necessarily good at many other things, but they had to be good at running. Those who weren’t good at running away already had weeds growing all over their graves.

The rebels didn’t care about army discipline or anything like that. They were used to breaking up and fleeing in all sorts of different directions, and only later would they find a chance to regroup. That was always what had left officials’ armies with the biggest headaches.

Scarface Yang Shen had thought about saving his subordinates, but when he witnessed the power of the sword formation, he decisively turned tail to run. What kind of a joke was this? Where the hell had this monster come from? He would just be throwing his life away if he continued! He saw that Monk Lu Zhi was already running far ahead of him with his stocky legs and cursed to himself, What a disloyal bastard! He didn’t even give me a heads-up before running away.

He had learned the importance of running away over the years. He didn’t use his master rank ability to fly, because that would just be practically begging the enemy to chase him. After witnessing the power of Zu An’s attack, he didn’t even have any confidence in escaping through flight.

His plan was successful. The rebel army had several thousand members; as they began to run, they covered the entire area, and they had all kinds of different appearances. When the two leaders entered the crowd, they didn’t look all that different from the other rebel army soldiers.

Zu An wasn’t someone who enjoyed wanton killing. When he saw the rebel army escaping, after some hesitation, he didn’t decide to wipe all of them out. Just then, however, he felt a mysterious aura enter his body. The experience bar seemed to have moved a bit. He had broken through Level 70, and even advanced a bit more.

Even though none of the rebel army members were all that strong, there were some with unique talents. Furthermore, there had been quite a few of them. When all of them were added up together, they had become a good amount of experience points for him.

Zu An thought, thank goodness he was someone with a bottom line. Otherwise, if it were anyone else, wouldn’t they leave the world strewn with mountains of corpses and seas of blood for the sake of growing stronger?

Just then, both Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang snapped out of their daze, muttering, “You can’t let the leader go…”

They both shut up halfway through their sentence. They thought to themselves that Sir Zu was so powerful, how could he not know about the risks of letting the leader go? With his ability, it wasn’t a big deal even if he let them go. If he had done so, he definitely had his own considerations, perhaps even seeking an opportunity for bigger returns later.

Questioning him now would only make us look immature.

When they thought about how they had questioned Zu An and even looked down on him before, both of their faces heated up. Zu An had even warned them before, but they hadn’t listened and gone on their own with their men. Then, everything had almost ended up in a disaster, and they had needed Sir Zu to save them.

That was just how human nature was. The words spoken previously by Zu An had only made them think that he was cowardly and timid. However, after they saw his devastating power, they were quickly convinced that Zu An’s earlier words were actually profound and that they hadn’t understood because they were slow-witted, and there were things they hadn’t considered.

…

Zu An had no idea what internal psychological battles the pair was going through. He gave the Armed Escort Division soldiers a look. Even though they seemed injured, fortunately, there was no danger to their lives. The medicine they carried with them was enough to stabilize the situation.

After dealing with his subordinates, he then turned to Xie Daoyun and asked, “How is your condition?”

“My mind has been exhausted quite severely, but I’ll be fine after some rest,” Xie Daoyun replied with a reddened face.

In reality, the mental strain she was talking about was the most troublesome thing for a runemaster. She wouldn’t necessarily be able to recover after readjusting herself for several years. However, that wasn’t what she was worried about at all. Instead, her heart was beating like crazy. The image of Zu An in the air with swords glistening behind him, and how with a wave of his hand the rebel army had been turned to dust, was just so handsome…

“Your mind is exhausted?” Zu An replied. He thought for a bit, then said seriously, “You can’t treat something like that lightly. It might affect your cultivation prospects if this isn’t taken care of properly.” After thinking about it, he took out a small jade bottle and said, “Drink this.”

“What is it?” Xie Daoyun reflexively asked, but she still drank it without question

She was actually someone who had been raised strictly. Because the seniors in the clan had been used to seeing all sorts of unscrupulous methods used in the court, they had warned her that she absolutely couldn't eat or drink things strangers gave her, especially if it was a man. However, those many years of concern didn’t do a thing when she was with Zu An.

As soon as the substance entered her mouth, her eyes lit up. She felt incredibly rich ki flow down her throat, spreading through her entire body. All of the wounds she had suffered were nourished, and even the bit of pain in her head, as well as the dizziness and nausea she felt, were greatly alleviated. She felt much more refreshed.

The substance almost seemed like liquefied natural ki. There wasn’t much of it, because how could ki have that much mass? It was just like the ancient legendary natural ki her teacher had mentioned in the past.

Zu An said in passing, “It’s spiritual spring water from Feather Mountain, which was created from condensed natural ki. It should be helpful for your soul.”

He had had quite a few divine items for treating the soul, such as the Five Aggregates Root and Milk of Purple Frost, but he had already used them up. Now, he only had this Feather Mountain spring water that he had acquired from his last trip to the Unknown Region. Even though Feather Mountain’s spring was miraculous, he was concerned that it wouldn’t necessarily be the right treatment for her needs.

Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang’s eyes widened. Sir Zu really invested heavily in chasing after women! He was even willing to give out such a spiritual substance? Even though they were envious, they still understood their limits; let alone the fact that they had offended Zu An not too long ago. The two of them sighed, really wishing they were women too. If they were, they could have been able to get some benefits too.

They exchanged a look with each other and saw each other’s faces. When they each imagined what the other would look like as a woman, both of their stomachs churned, and they almost threw up.

Meanwhile, Xie Daoyun stared at Zu An in infatuation. Even though she had never heard of Feather Mountain’s spiritual spring, she could sense how incredible it was. It was definitely an incredible treasure!

Sir Zu has given me so many precious things such as the Exotic Witchsand, and now, he’s even given me this rarely seen divine substance…

Is he actually interested in me too? Ah, but he has a wife! No, Miss Chu clearly already divorced him…
