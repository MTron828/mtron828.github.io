Chapter 1524: The Fiend King Court Will Not Tolerate One So Outstanding

“Understood!” Eunuch Wen replied, shivering when he sensed the anger in the emperor’s tone.

Sir Sang really has offended his majesty this time! Isn’t he usually the careful sort who knows how to guess his majesty’s intentions? Just what is happening this time?Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

He didn’t dare to ask anything further and quickly left. The emperor was angry, so he didn’t even dare to send the lesser eunuchs to take care of it; instead, he personally headed out to handle it. He quickly had Zhuxie Chixin send the order to the diplomatic mission through the Embroidered Envoy.

He was moving quickly through the imperial garden when suddenly, a melodious and sweet voice called out, “May I ask why Eunuch Wen is in such a hurry?”

If it were anyone else asking, Eunuch Wen would have erupted into fury and not given them any time. However, he didn’t dare treat the one who was asking with any carelessness. He could only reply, “I greet the Crown Princess!”

Standing nearby were several palace maids surrounding a beautiful woman. Who else could it be but Bi Linglong?

Because there were no important events at the palace today, she wasn’t dressed as lavishly as usual. She had a simple emerald green hairpin in her hair, and was dressed in a long white dress made of soft fabric; around her waist was an elaborate jade belt. With a light sway of her body, the entire dress moved like flowing clouds, making her figure look even more sweet and fair. She also had a fiery red fox fur coat draped across her shoulders, which made her fair skin look as if it had a slight blush.

Even though Eunuch Wen frequently saw her in the palace, he still praised her inwardly. The Crown Princess really was an absolutely incredible beauty! When he thought about the Crown Prince’s slow-wittedness, he once again felt as if a pearl were being fed to a swine. He sighed inwardly.

However, he quickly lowered his head and tossed out that outrageous thought. He said, “Replying to the Crown Princess. This old servant was going to see where Sir Sang’s envoy is right now.”

Bi Linglong nodded and replied, “Indeed, their envoy has been acting a bit strangely. They should have already returned a long time ago.”

That guy Zu An really is a dummy!

The two of them had met through the special mirror, but because so many people were watching, there had been many things they couldn't say. They didn’t even dare to spend too much time talking to each other.

Eventually, she’d had the Eastern Palace’s members send all sorts of letters to the Imperial Envoy asking about different things. Of course, they were all under the pretext of official business.

She had believed that with Zu An’s wit, he would definitely understand her intentions and quickly reply. Even though it would surely be under the pretext of official business as well, she always felt really happy whenever she received his letters. Furthermore, considering that guy’s nature, he would definitely have a way of sharing some real information with her.

And yet, even after the Eastern Palace sent countless letters, it was as if all of them had been swallowed up by an ocean.

Of course, it wasn’t as if they had been completely swallowed up. They still received many replies, but they were either sent from Sang Hong or someone else. Not a single one was from Zu An!

A young lady’s thoughts were just that strange. Her reason told her that there was no way his messages would really contain anything, but she couldn't help but get angry when he didn’t write anything.

“What the Crown Princess says is correct. The fleet is moving abnormally slowly,” Eunuch Wen said. He noticed that the princess didn’t trouble the maids and instead held up an exquisite umbrella alone. The surface of the umbrella had simple yet elegant plum blossom designs, which added a bit of vibrancy to the garden.

He was stunned at first. Even though it was snowing a bit, the ki surrounding cultivators could usually disperse the snow quickly. As such, cultivators normally wouldn’t bring umbrellas in such weather. For example, he hadn’t.

However, he quickly realized that it was a matter of aesthetics, which young ladies cared about. The Crown Princess was indeed extremely pretty. With the umbrella, her appearance looked even more captivating.

Eunuch Wen suddenly snapped out of his daze.

I’m a eunuch; why do I care if she’s pretty or not? Sigh, it really is one tragic story after the next.

Then, he responded to some more of Bi Linglong’s questions before leaving in a hurry.

Bi Linglong looked toward the northwest; it was unclear what she was thinking. Her beautiful brows furrowed into a concerned arc.

…

“Achoo!”

In the distant Fiend races’ Imperial Palace, Zu An rubbed his nose. He felt a bit strange. He was clearly feeling hot and restless, so why would he sneeze?

He felt as if his aura was about to erupt! Zu An felt the urge to continue venting, but he still retained some of his reason. Being too reckless in the Imperial Palace wasn’t a good idea. As such, with a kick off the ground, he swiftly flew over to the mountains beyond the Fiend King Court.

…

Meanwhile, in the Golden Crow Ancestral Land, someone quickly came with a report. When the elders heard what had happened, they all voiced their surprise. “The new divine weapon is in the Regent’s hands?”

A rather irritable elder named Wu Fan said with a sneer, “The royal family’s current generation really has no sense of honor. They actually let a human control the entire situation and become the Regent. Is he going to lead the Fiend races to prosperity? He doesn’t have that ability at all…”

He continued to talk non-stop. When the Great Elder saw that Wu Fan was about to mock the new Fiend Emperor, he finally couldn't take it, because he had been there the previous day too. He replied, “That brat isn’t that weak. He killed several grandmasters yesterday.”

“Hmph, I’ve heard you say that already. In the end, wasn’t it because of the Sun Slaying Bow’s power? He himself is nothing more than a brat who has just broken through the master rank’s hero form stage.” Wu Fan said with a cold laugh.

“But he killed the Blood races’ Sir Fu with his bare hands, and it seemed to have been done almost instantly too!” another elder retorted. He had been there the previous night too.

“Sir Fu? Even though that guy is infamous for his atrocities, after absorbing the blood essence of so many people, his cultivation was mixed and impure. Eventually, it would have been easy for the ki to reject him, which would lead to deviation and death. I think he just happened to have reached the moment of deviation and that brat took advantage of it,” Wu Fan said forcefully with the courage of his convictions.

“But… How can there be that big of a coincidence?” another elder asked.

“Then let me ask you, could any of us kill Sir Fu in a single move?” Wu Fan countered.

Now, the others all fell silent. There were actually some people who could defeat Sir Fu in a single move, as they were all old monsters from the Fiend races’ royal family with profound and immeasurable skills. Still, Sir Fu wasn’t someone who would fight fairly. His skills had been obtained through endless slaughter. Someone like that definitely had top-notch survival skills. They were confident they could defeat him in one move, but not kill him in a single move.

“Then doesn’t that explain everything now?” When he saw the others standing speechless, Wu Fan sneered. “Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth.”

Even the Great Elder was now convinced, saying, “That kid is quite lucky. He managed to obtain two divine weapons at such a young age.”

Wu Fan harrumphed. “In my opinion, it’s nothing good. Having two divine weapons at such a young age is like a child parading around the street with money. He’ll definitely bring disaster upon himself. Let this old one go, and I’ll be sure to bring back the divine weapon, which can be considered saving his life.”

The Great Elder frowned and said, “He is now the Regent, though. Just seizing it doesn’t seem too good, right?”

“The Sun Slaying Bow was our Fiend races’ divine weapon to begin with. The late Fiend Emperor merely placed it in his hands so it could return to us. It’s only reasonable for us to take it back now,” Wu Fan said with a snort “He’s still so young, and yet he’s already a Regent and wants to hold two divine weapons?

“The Fiend King Court will not tolerate one so outstanding!”
