Chapter 1772: Extreme Joy Turns to Extreme Sorrow

Zu An was confused. Why didn’t he feel the same way? Were these ghosts just on a different wavelength from him or something? Perhaps the way they made decisions wasn't quite the same as what humans used…

“Since you all know that Jing Teng is formidable, the trap you made is definitely really strong, right?” he then asked.

“But of course,” Hidden Dragon said, sticking out his chest. “I was the one who personally designed many of them. For example, the Hundred Ghost Spirit Devouring Formation, which will prevent her from using any spiritual power.

“The Great Slowing Ice Formation will make her thirty percent slower.

“The Treacherous Bone Howling Formation will injure her soul and decrease her defenses by twenty percent.

“Also…”

…

He continued for a long time with an extremely proud tone. That was because most of the traps were his own work.

Zu An was quite shocked as he listened. If Jing Teng came over without any idea, perhaps she really would be done in. If these two ghost generals then started their attack, how could she possibly survive?

“Aren’t I amazing?” Hidden Dragon concluded, looking at Zu An as if he were waiting for him to hurry and praise him.

“You really are pretty amazing. You’re already so amazing, so why aren’t you challenging the Ghost King to become the new Ghost King?” Zu An asked curiously. He had heard Jing Teng mention that ghosts all followed the law of the jungle. This Ghost King had reached his position by taking down the previous Ghost King as well.

“How could I possibly be a match for the Ghost King?!” Hidden Dragon exclaimed, a hint of fear flashing across his face. “The Ghost King has the Ghost King Staff, which has absolute power over ghosts. It can grant life or death, and it can give and take away. We don’t have a chance at all.”

Zu An was startled. No wonder all of the ghosts were under his control.

Hidden Dragon gradually realized that something was off. He asked, “Hey, kid, why are you asking me questions again? Hurry and tell me all of your group’s skills. I want to know just how my ghost brothers were defeated.

“If you don’t tell me, I’ll carve your flesh away piece by piece and eat it right in front of you! Trust me, the humans I’ve dealt with in the past believed that they were men of steel, and yet they all collapsed one after the next after I ate just a few pieces of their flesh. Even they couldn't endure it, let alone a little pretty boy like you.”

When he sensed the intimidating tone in Hidden Dragon’s voice, Zu An sighed with amazement. Demons were demons deep down, after all! As a ghost general, who knew how much blood Hidden Dragon had on his hands…

“Sorry, but it’s my turn to ask you the questions now,” Zu An said, standing up. Because Phoenix Chick had just left, he was worried about Jing Teng and Qiu Honglei’s safety. He wasn’t in the mood to waste any more time.

Hidden Dragon cried furiously, “And who do you think you are?”

You have successfully trolled Hidden Dragon for +444 +444 +444…

He sent a punch toward Zu An. Surrounding his fist was a sphere of black energy, full of corrosive power. He wasn’t the brightest of the bunch, but the fact that he could get to his position and become a ghost general proved his skill in formations and his personal strength.

There had been many ghosts who looked down on him, thinking that he was easy to bully because he was a bit slow. That was why, out of all the generals, he had been challenged the most. And yet in the end, those ghosts had all died miserably, becoming nourishment in his belly.

The worst part was that any fights against him were always full of tricks. He had many strange formations that could drain up to half of an opponent’s strength. As a result, the ones who lost found it hard to accept that defeat even after death. Furthermore, the black energy around his fist was also quite famous in the Yin Yang Realm. It could corrode all things, including one’s body. That really was torture beyond what one could endure.

He could sense that he had been fooled by Zu An, which made him attack even more viciously. He wanted this pretty boy to have a taste of suffering, and planned to get rid of one of his arms first.

Just then, however, Zu An raised his fist and sent a punch right back.

“Huh? A pretty boy like you actually dares to fight against me?” Hidden Dragon remarked in confusion. He saw a layer of white light covering Zu An’s fist, but he didn’t treat it as a big deal. Either way, there was no way he would lose.

And yet, when the two fists collided, a miserable scream filled the air… and the one who was screaming wasn’t that pretty boy, but rather Hidden Dragon!

Hidden Dragon looked at his fractured arm and was stupefied. His black energy was the one famous for its corrosion, so why was he the one being corroded instead?

Still, after fighting in the ghost realm for so long, he still had some battle instincts. He didn’t have time to think about why that had happened and immediately widened the gap between them. At the same time, he activated his talent, triggering several formations.

The Hundred Ghost Spirit Devouring Formation restricted spiritual force, internal energy, and the like. The Great Slowing Ice Formation slowed down an opponent. The Treacherous Bone Howling Formation had an intimidating effect on the soul.

Zu An looked down and saw that there was a trail of frost beneath his feet. It froze his feet in place and prevented him from moving. He thought of something and phoenix flames quickly surged, instantly melting the ice. At the same time, however, sinister winds stirred. An endless swarm of white skeletons flew around him and released shrill shrieks, inflicting some kind of suppression on his soul.

With a loud and clear noise, Hundredwarble automatically activated. A strange giant bird projection rose from Zu An’s body, instantly devouring all of the white skeletons. As for the Hundred Ghost Spirit Devouring Formation, it didn’t have any effect on him at all. Ever since he had awakened the ‘Kun Peng’ bird in the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra and it had merged with his Heaven Devouring Sutra, his cultivation had stopped being something that could be assessed in terms of spiritual force or internal energy.

As the white skeletons were all devoured, Hidden Dragon screamed and howled while clutching his head.

In that moment of distraction, Zu An’s hand quickly landed on his shoulder.

Hidden Dragon smiled maliciously. This person actually dares to touch the body of a ghost general? He won’t even know how he died!

He was about to release a black mist to devour his opponent when his expression changed a second later. He noticed that Zu An’s hand was like a sun, instantly blasting through the black mist protecting him and grabbing his real body. Then, he felt a terrifying suction force, as if there were a black hole in Zu An’s hands. All of his essence quickly flowed into that black hole.

“Great hero, please spare me!” Hidden Dragon cried, pleading for mercy. Dying in battle wasn’t that scary, but having all of his cultivation sucked dry by such a skill really left him terrified.

In the world of ghosts, the strong usually sucked the weak dry of soul force. As such, those kinds of skills were naturally intimidating to them.

“Then are you willing to answer my questions now?” Zu An asked with a smile. The Primordial Origin Sutra had a powerful restrictive effect on all things sinister. Otherwise, this ghost general’s black mist really would have been quite tricky to deal with. The Kun Peng and Heaven Devouring Sutra’s combined absorption skill also inflicted a sense of despair.

“I am, I am!” Hidden Dragon quickly replied with a nod.

“The reason you’re so scared of that Ghost King… Is it because of that staff that rules over your lives?” Zu An asked. To a certain degree, his primordial ki had similar effects. Did that mean he could also become a ghost king?

“That’s one of the reasons,” Hidden Dragon explained. “But if that were all, only ghosts would fear him. Human cultivators wouldn’t. The truth is, though, all the cultivators of the world shiver at the sound of his name.

“The reason for that is mainly due to another ability of his, ‘Demonic Voice of the Ghost King’. That skill can strip the souls right out of the living. If you become a disembodied soul, you’ll be completely subdued.”

Zu An’s expression darkened. That skill was indeed tricky to deal with. He wondered if a grandmaster or earth immortal’s yin and yang spirits would be affected too. He continued, “Apart from that, what other skills does he have?”

Hidden Dragon thought to himself, s that still not enough? Don’t tell me you’re planning to really fight the Ghost King? But he still replied, “As far as I know, he also has immunity against all kinds of elemental and physical damage.”

“How is that possible?” Zu An asked, stunned. Everything had a predetermined fate, and they naturally had things that counter them. But this Ghost King had complete immunity against physical and elemental powers? Didn’t that make him invincible?

“It’s true! I’m not lying to you!” Hidden Dragon cried in alarm, thinking, Just look at the candle if you don’t believe me! He had never expected that the candle he used for interrogation would be used on him instead.

“How do you know so much?” Zu An asked, looking at him suspiciously.

“Because this Yin Yang Realm is one that runs on the law of the jungle. There have been many strong ghosts who wanted to challenge him, but all of them suffered miserable defeats without exception. All those with power in this world secretly observe and gather intelligence. All this was learned through countless lessons of blood.”nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Zu An remained quiet for a while. If that really was the case, the Ghost King would be really hard to deal with. He didn’t even know how to begin fighting against that kind of opponent. He continued, “Does he have any other abilities?”

Hidden Dragon shook his head. “I don’t know anything else. But even if there were, it wouldn’t be able to compare to these skills. They shouldn’t be a problem for your distinguished self.”

“Those people fell for it after all! They’re rushing over here in alarm right now…” Phoenix Chick called out as he ran over excitedly. “That Jing Teng is someone the Ghost King wants, so we can’t touch her, but the other woman is ours. She’s quite pretty, so I’m going to do her first, then eat… Huh, what are the two of you doing?”
