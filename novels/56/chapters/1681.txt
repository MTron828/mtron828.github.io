Chapter 1630 – Push of the Iron Mountain

Zhi Yin shook his snow-white cloak when he got on the stage. Between that and his handsome smile, the women who were watching the battle all screamed.

“Big brother Zhi Yin is so handsome! I’m going to die~”

“We have to protect the world’s greatest big brother, Zhi Yin, together!”

“Big brother, you can do it!”

…

When he heard the female disciples’ encouragement, Zhi Yin’s previously gloomy mood due to Chu Chuyan’s situation finally eased a bit. He looked at the woman across from him and suddenly became a bit absentminded.

He had thought that Chu Chuyan was the world’s prettiest woman, but he hadn’t expected there to be someone else who wasn’t inferior to her at all. The woman in front of him had a beauty that was entirely different from Chu Chuyan’s. Every frown and smile she made seemed to tug at his very soul! Of course, the most alarming feature she had was the movement of her chest. It really made one’s eyes and heart jump along with it.

He took a deep breath and secretly warned himself not to do anything that would let down Fairy Chu, reminding himself that he was fully devoted to her. Only then did he say to Pei Mianman, “Lady Pei, you should forfeit. With your strength, you absolutely have the qualification to become the second place in our group. Obtaining a spot in the quota shouldn’t be too difficult of a matter for you.”

Pei Mianman sorted out her hair, which had become a bit messy due to the wind. She said with a smile, “Thank you for your reminder, senior brother. However, I still want to give it a try.”

Zhi Yin’s smile froze when he heard the response. Just then, a strange silence fell. Ever since that Mount Luofu disciple who had overestimated his own abilities and was seriously injured as a result, Pei Mianman was the first one who had challenged a representative disciple. Many people were worried for her. After all, this was such a pretty woman with such a big smile, so how could they not have a good impression of her?

The sect masters exchanged a look. Apart from Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s Guan Choutian, whose expression was a bit ugly, the others all nodded. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Wang Wuxie couldn't help but say in praise, “As cultivators, we should be facing challenges head-on like this and strive to be number one.”

The others immediately surrendering as soon as they encountered a representative disciple really weren’t what the leaders had had in mind when they planned the Nine Sects Great Competition. This competition was supposed to forge the disciples into something stronger.

Guan Chouhai thought, This guy sure speaks nice words, but isn’t this only because she isn’t challenging your Wu Xiaofan?

He naturally wasn’t worried that Zhi Yin would lose, but Pei Mianman’s cultivation wasn’t low. After fighting with her, he will definitely be a bit worn out. Then, once the first-place participants from each group fought, it would be disadvantageous for him.

Mount Luofu’s Elder Xu had an even unhappier expression. Earlier, why hadn’t there been any words of praise when their disciple challenged Peng Wuyan? Wasn’t it all because Pei Mianman was pretty?

Yan Xuehen gave Pei Mianman a careful look and nodded inwardly. This woman’s talent wasn’t bad, but her steadfast will and courage were even rarer traits. It was a pity that Yan Xuehen hadn’t met her earlier; if she could have taken Pei Mianman as a disciple too, her achievements would definitely have been on par with Chu Chuyan’s.

However, she suddenly remembered her relationship with Zu An; in that case, both of her disciples would have been swindled by that brat Zu An! She practically wouldn’t even be able to sleep at night from anger.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +20 +20 +20…

…

Meanwhile, Qiu Honglei tugged at Yun Jianyue’s sleeves, asking, “Master, who do you think will win?”

Yun Jianyue thought to herself for a bit and replied, “It’s hard to say. That big-boobed woman was holding back before, but that pretty boy is Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s representative disciple. He’s definitely a tough opponent.”

Qiu Honglei was speechless. Her master’s habit of giving people nicknames hadn’t changed, but they really were big…

…

On Tranquility Temple’s side, the little monk Jie Se asked a similar question. “Which benefactor below does master think will win?”

Master Jian Huang had a profound look as he replied, “Who do you want to win more?”

“I hope Lady Pei wins. Her courage in facing a challenge is admirable,” Jie Se reflexively replied.

“Is her bravery what you admire?” Master Jian Huang harrumphed. “Copy our tenets a hundred times when we go back, then write the heart sutra from memory a hundred times.”

Jie Se was speechless.

…

Xie Daoyun secretly asked Zu An, “Big brother Zu, can Miss Pei win?” After all, they had been fellow students before at Brightmoon Academy, so she naturally felt closer to Pei Mianman than Zhi Yin.

“I’m not sure,” Zu An said with a frown. Then, he sent Pei Mianman a ki transmission, saying, “Big Manman, there’s no need for you to take the risk here. Second place is already practically yours.”

That pretty boy Zhi Yin was Heavenly Sorrow’s representative disciple, after all. With Big Manman’s previous cultivation, she definitely wouldn’t have been his match, but he didn’t know how much she had improved since then.

Pei Mianman had a huge smile as she replied, “You know, I was a genius before I met you. I don’t want to lose to anyone.” If she didn’t even dare to face Zhi Yin, how was she going to beat Chuyan?

When he sensed the firmness of her resolve, Zu An couldn't really try to convince her further. After remaining silent for a moment, he said with a smile, “Then Big Manman can just fight to your heart’s content. If there are any consequences, I’ll help you cover it up.”

A bright and beautiful smile appeared on Pei Mianman’s face. The two of them were already connected in body and spirit, so there was no need to say too many words of gratitude.

Meanwhile, Zhi Yin only felt everything in front of him blur. This Lady Pei’s smile really was beautiful! He thought, I should be a bit more lenient later. I can’t make her loss look too ugly.

As such, he gestured for her to start in a noble manner, saying, “Lady Pei, please make your move.”

His confident appearance left many young ladies star-struck.

“Big brother is so handsome!”

“As expected of Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s noble prince!”

…

Pei Mianman didn’t decline and slowly drew her longsword, replying, “I’ll be offending big brother.”

Then, her longsword thrust toward her opponent, unleashing a wildly powerful wave of energy. The longsword clearly looked graceful and thin, and yet it unleashed incredible power when it was thrust forth! Her fighting style really was ferocious. Most importantly, every single slash contained an extremely vicious power, as if she were a general who had survived battles involving thousands of people. The disciples nearby with low cultivations even found it a bit hard to breathe.

The expressions of the disciples from the nine daoist sects changed. The competitors who had lost to her before fully accepted their defeat. Previously, they had felt that this woman just relied on that strange black flame of hers and that her true strength wouldn’t have been sufficient to win against them, but at this moment, they all subconsciously thought that she hadn’t been using her full strength before at all.

A reminiscent smile appeared on Zu An’s face. In the Yinxu secret dungeon, Pei Mianman had lived for many years as the war goddess Fu Hao, someone who left enemies terror-stricken on the battlefield! That level of boldness had already been etched into her bones. If anyone mistook her for some dainty flower vase, they would pay a big price for that error in judgment.

Sure enough, Zhi Yin hadn’t expected her attack to be so overwhelming. He couldn't help but become a bit flustered. Fortunately, his movement technique was profound, and he was always able to just barely avoid the attacks. However, he had already long forgotten his previous thoughts of going easy on his opponent. On many occasions, he wanted to counterattack, but now that he had lost the initiative, seizing it back wouldn’t be so easy.

Sword ki flew across the battlefield and their clothes fluttered around. The surrounding disciples were dazzled by the battle, shocked by Pei Mianman’s ferocious attacks and in awe of Zhi Yin’s advanced movement skill. This was the first time they had seen a representative disciple put in such a tough situation.

Suddenly, with a loud and clear sound, a white cloth fluttered through the air. It turned out that Zhi Yin hadn’t evaded in time, and Pei Mianman’s sword had sliced through the cloak he was wearing!

The entire battlefield erupted with gasps. They hadn’t expected that the first one left at a disadvantage would be Zhi Yin! Could it be that a representative disciple was going to lose for the first time?

In the previous daoist sect competitions, there had been instances of representative disciples experiencing upsets, but it was extremely rare. Only three or four instances had ever been recorded. Every single one had been used by the sects as teaching material for their disciples. Those individuals had practically been nailed to a pillar of humiliation for over a thousand years. Could it be that Zhi Yin was going to become the new laughingstock?

However, others had deeper insights. Jadefall Palace’s Wan Guiyi sneered and said, “That was only because Zhi Yin was trying to act handsome, always wearing that hindrance of a cloak. Now, he has paid the price for it. But now, he has obtained an opportunity.”

Sure enough, after losing his cloak, Zhi Yin’s movements became much more agile. After avoiding the sword strike, he brought his knee downward. When his foot made contact with the ground, it struck with enough force to produce cracks. Borrowing that force, he leaned into his opponent’s sword.

Pei Mianman’s blade immediately bent like a crescent moon, groaning under the pressure. Fortunately, her reaction was extremely quick. She did several somersaults backward, all the way to the edge of the stage; only then did she finally neutralize the tremendous force. Even so, there was still an unnatural blush on her face. She was clearly injured.

“Push of the Iron Mountain!” those who knew the skill shouted.

The other representative disciples also narrowed their eyes. This was Zhi Yin’s ultimate skill. It used his entire body as a conduit to transfer the force of the earth. Its power was rumored to feel like the weight of a mountain. They had finally seen it for themselves today! As expected, its strength was exceptional.

Zhi Yin didn’t press the attack, instead saying elegantly to Pei Mianman, “The fact that you were able to pressure me this far is already something to be proud of. However, if you still refuse to use your black flames, you might not have another chance.”

His gestures and movements made a group of female disciples scream again.

“He’s so good! I really…”

Of course, the male disciples next to them all wrinkled their noses and rolled their eyes.

“Then senior brother needs to be careful,” Pei Mianman said. At the same time, a ring of raging black flames surrounded her entire body.
