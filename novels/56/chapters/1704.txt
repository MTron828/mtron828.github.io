Chapter 1653: All’s Fair in War

Qiu Honglei nodded. Then, she kicked off and landed gently on the stage.

Many people nodded to themselves when they saw that. Even though this woman was a bit ugly, her etiquette in her actions was still top-tier. They wondered just how she had managed to merge two completely contradictory characteristics into one person.

Shi Dingtian walked over with his characteristic simple and honest expression. He scratched his head from time to time, which drew quite a few amused looks.

Compared to the crazy affair that was the last battle, this fight would definitely be much more mediocre. If they had found out that these two would be the ones fighting before the competition, not many spectators would have bothered showing up to watch. Even so, the combatants’ performances as dark horses made those present look forward to the battle.

The disciples speculated as to who would win the fight among themselves. The overwhelming majority supported Shi Dingtian. After all, Peng Wuyan was quite unattractive, and the way she fought was a bit too ruthless. As such, most of the people present didn’t really like her. In contrast, Shi Dingtian had an honest and straightforward nature that made it hard for others to dislike him. Seeing as they had to root for someone, he naturally gained more support.

Meanwhile, in the judges' section, Zu An was leaning more toward Peng Wuyan. For some reason, he felt a mysterious sense of intimacy with the woman.

What the heck is wrong with me? Is there something wrong with my perception of aesthetics?

He began to even question life when he realized that.

…

After Watchful Heart Peak Master Feng Wuchang declared the start of the fight, the formations around the stage lit up to prevent the battle’s effects from harming the spectating disciples.

Shi Dingtian had a blade in hand as he greeted Qiu Honglei. The weapon was something Supreme Mystery Cave had specially prepared for him. Judging from the aura it was giving off, it was clearly a heaven-grade weapon.

Tranquility Temple’s Jian Huang and Jie Se both sighed inwardly. As expected of the daoist sects! Even Supreme Mystery Cave, which was in dire straits, had such resources to spare. It was easy to imagine just how powerful they had been in their most glorious era.

Qiu Honglei didn’t reply to the greeting; instead, she said unhappily, “You didn’t even use a blade against other opponents, so why are you using it against me? Is it because you think I’m ugly, so you’re not holding back at all?”

When they heard those words, many of the female disciples felt a bit of sympathy as well. The way they looked at Shi Dingtian became a bit strange.

Yun Jianyue inwardly gave her a thumbs up. As expected of my most talented disciple of the past few decades! Even with such an ugly face, she can still turn it into an advantage.

Shi Dingtian’s face immediately turned entirely red. He quickly tried to defend himself, protesting, “That’s not it at all! It’s because Cave Master Mu told me that I’d be looking down on my opponent if I appear barehanded, so I should use all of my strength now as a sign of respect for my opponent!”

Many of the sect leaders in the judges' area looked at Cave Master Mu. Cave Master Mu was a bit embarrassed. He knew that his disciple was simple and honest, and any other explanation would have been hard for him to understand. He had to use that explanation to ‘trick’ Shi Dingtian into being a bit more serious. However, even if he could deceive that silly disciple of his, how could he deceive these old foxes?

Qiu Honglei sneered. Shi Dingtian was ill at ease and quickly said, “Then I just won’t use it, okay?” He put the blade away.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Cave Master Mu almost vomited blood when he saw that. He had finally managed to make that foolish disciple of his use the blade, and yet, after just a single sentence from this woman, Shi Dingtian had discarded that advice!

Qiu Honglei nodded in satisfaction, saying, “That’s more like it. I’m about to start, so you have to be careful.”

“Thank you… Thank you for your reminder, miss,” Shi Dingtian said, feeling really moved. Even though this girl does look a bit fierce, she’s the first one to worry about me. She’s really a great person!

Qiu Honglei chuckled. Then, she raised her hand and fired a shining sphere. Shi Dingtian was surprised and quickly dodged. He had seen her use the move before, so it wasn’t too big of an issue or anything. Qiu Honglei didn’t give him a chance to react, however, continuously launching shining spheres of light at him.

Shi Dingtian dodged from side to side. However, he eventually started feeling that avoiding the spheres was too troublesome and decided to just hit them. His fists unleashed ferocious winds with each strike, and always managed to knock the spheres of light away.

Meanwhile, Kunlun Void Sect’s Liang Ling watched the battle. He thought that Peng Wuyan was just wasting her ki for nothing, and wondered when she would use the move that had taken him out before.

Sure enough, after several rounds of fast light spheres, several massive light bullets followed. If Shi Dingtian took them head-on, he would probably be seriously injured.

…

In the judges' area, Cave Master Mu stroked his beard with a smile. He had previously advised Shi Dingtian on how to deal with that attack.

Sure enough, when Shi Dingtian saw the massive projectiles, he didn’t wait for them to get close and simply jumped, choosing to attack Qiu Honglei from above. Two massive fists slammed down toward where his opponent was standing. The entire stage shook violently.

Feng Wuchang’s eye twitched. It seemed this stage probably wouldn’t last long either.

“Huh?”

However, not only Shi Dingtian was stunned; even Cave Master Mu stood up straight. Qiu Honglei had already disappeared! The next second, she appeared behind Shi Dingtian, as if she had already anticipated his reaction.

“How fast!”

Countless people cried out in alarm. Only then did they remember that the legendary light element excelled in speed.

The short swords in Qiu Honglei’s hand lit up. Shi Dingtian suffered several dozen strikes aimed toward his vitals in an instant.

Liang Ling gritted his teeth. He had almost been chopped into pieces by that very same attack! The other spectators also remembered that scene. Could it be that this round would be decided just like that?

However, their eyes soon widened, because Shi Dingtian was sliced to shreds by the blades…

And yet, it was just a substitute! His true body was already more than thirty meters away.

The spectators finally realized that Shi Dingtian was of the wind element, so he could keep up with his opponent’s speed!

Qiu Honglei harrumphed. With a flash, she instantly appeared next to Shi Dingtian and attacked again.

Shi Dingtian could face others bare-handed, but he was at a significant disadvantage against his opponent’s sharp blades. His arms were quickly drenched with blood.

Cave Master Mu looked extremely anxious and nervous. He couldn't help but call out, “Hurry and use your weapon!”

However, Shi Dingtian didn’t seem to have heard him and stubbornly refused to bring the blade out.

“A true gentleman doesn’t speak during a match,” Yun Jianyue remarked, unhappy with Cave Master Mu’s mid-match coaching.

“It’s your disciple’s fault for tricking him into not using a weapon!” Cave Master Mu retorted, fuming.

“Even then, that’s something the combatants on the stage have decided on. What’s a senior like you getting involved for? Mister Wang, are you going to turn a blind eye to this type of behavior?” Yun Jianyue immediately shot back angrily.

Wang Wuxie had a strange expression. He had never expected to be caught up in this too. Even though he looked down on Qiu Honglei’s actions a bit, the rules were the rules, so he could only remind Cave Master Mu, “Judges are not permitted to interfere.”

Cave Master Mu’s face turned entirely red. He wanted to say something, but Zu An couldn't help but say with a chuckle, “There is no need for Cave Master Mu to be too upset. Suffering a bit on stage might serve as a solid reminder if he ends up facing some despicable individuals in the future. At the very least, no lives will be lost on this stage. I feel that this Lady Peng’s choice is quite wise.”

Cave Master Mu was stunned when he heard that, but he felt that it made some sense. If that foolish disciple of his encountered the Devil Sect’s monsters in the future, there was no way they would follow the rules. Rather than suffering then and bringing about a huge disaster, Shi Dingtian would be better off gaining some experience here. The thought calmed Cave Master Mu down, and he no longer argued with Yun Jianyue.

Yun Jianyue shot Zu An a smile. This kid understands us after all. Even if we change our appearances, he actually still stands on our side. Doesn’t that mean it’s fate?

…

Meanwhile, several new developments had occurred during the match. Shi Dingtian realized that he couldn't win against his opponent like this, so he turned around and ran. He was also quite fast, being of the wind element. He turned into a wisp of smoke, and using a special movement skill, he avoided Qiu Honglei’s attacks one after another.

“What kind of movement skill is that? Why is it so incredible?”

The disciples in the audience all talked among each other. Even Supreme Mystery Cave’s disciples were stunned, because none of them recognized it.

The White Jade Sect’s Lou Wucheng had been feeling a bit unhappy that he lost to Shi Dingtian. He had thought that it was simply because he had been too emotional and thus revealed too many openings. However, he now realized that if Shi Dingtian had combined such a mysterious movement skill with blade ki, he could well have lost even without making those mistakes.

This Miss Peng was a bit too despicable, actually preventing Shi Dingtian from using a blade through her words!

Still, it really was weird. Even though Lou Wucheng had lost to Shi Dingtian, he was actually hoping for him to win now. After all, the stronger the one he had lost to was, the more that proved his own strength. Otherwise, if Shi Dingtian ended up being eliminated easily, wouldn’t he look even worse?

Kunlun Void Sect’s Liang Ling had similar thoughts. When he saw Qiu Honglei battering Shi Dingtian with attacks, he felt rather pleased. He actually hoped that she would take the crown, because that would mean he had only lost to the final victor.

Meanwhile, Qiu Honglei gritted her teeth as she discovered that her attacks couldn't hit the erratically moving Shi Dingtian. If she could use her Empress Lantern, she would already have frozen this stupid kid a long time ago. Why would she have to go through so much trouble?

As such, she gave up on her attacks and roared angrily, “Hey, brat, are you only going to run? Can you even call yourself a man?”

Shi Dingtian scratched his head and said, “But you’re too strong. I can’t win against you…”

“Then just admit defeat if you can’t win.” Qiu Honglei harrumphed.

“But Cave Master Mu will scold me if I do that…” Shi Dingtian replied, scratching his head.

“Then just how many months and years will this fight continue for if you just keep running like this?” Qiu Honglei shouted angrily.

“Then I won’t run anymore, okay?” Shi Dingtian replied after thinking for a bit.

Cave Master Mu spat the tea he had been sipping out of his mouth. Even this kid wasn’t usually so stupid, right?

Shi Dingtian added, “But you can’t use that flashing skill either. My eyes can’t handle that.” Qiu Honglei’s blinding attack scared him quite a bit. What if she used that when they were fighting up close?

Cave Master Mu finally nodded in appreciation. This silly disciple of his had finally grown up and learned how to negotiate.

“Fine!” Qiu Honglei replied with a nod.

Shi Dingtian sighed in relief. Then, he charged with a shout, his entire body surging with ki. His eyes were wide open, making him look even more imposing than before.

Qiu Honglei grinned. Suddenly, a blinding sun appeared on the stage.
