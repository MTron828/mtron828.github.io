Chapter 1220: A Lesson

Yan Xuehen’s head went blank. Her entire body was soaked in cold sweat. The fact that she had reached grandmaster rank meant she had experienced countless dangerous situations, yet all of them added together couldn't compare to this moment.

Just as she was about to acknowledge her fate, however, a figure suddenly flashed past her window.

“Who is it?” Yun Jianyue called out.

She had been on high alert to begin with. Even though that person had moved extremely quickly, it didn’t escape her detection. She kicked off and chased after them. Looks like there really was someone who wanted to harm Yan Xuehen after all!

That person had actually managed to escape her detection? She had been about to check the bed, so they had probably seen it as an opportunity to make their move.

Even after Yun Jianyue left, Yan Xuehen’s heart kept pounding. It was so loud that it was audible even without a cultivator’s boosted senses.

She was about to say something to Zu An, but the covers flipped over and a figure rushed out before hiding in the wardrobe. The wardrobe’s doors weren’t even properly closed; they remained in the same position they had been left in after Yun Jianyue examined them. Of course, that meant one of the doors was half-open.

Zu An did his best to hide inside. Unless one looked closely, it would be hard to notice him. He broke out into a cold sweat. If he had been discovered just then, it really would have been hard to explain himself. Fortunately, he had summoned Daji at the most crucial moment to draw Yun Jianyue away.

Yan Xuehen was a bit surprised, but she quickly reacted. She felt admiration for Zu An’s quick thinking inwardly. The most dangerous place had instead become the safest place. Yun Jianyue had just examined the wardrobe, which would make it a blind spot in her thinking. She wouldn’t pay attention to that area again.

But her expression became stranger and stranger. This fella’s movement seems really practiced… Does he do this kind of thing often or something?

Yun Jianyue quickly returned with an awful expression.

“What happened? Did you lose him?” Yan Xuehen asked. Zu An was no longer under the covers, so she felt much calmer. A slight smile was on her lips.

“That person’s movement ability was too fast, and they actually vanished in an instant. Looks like my injuries have affected me more than I thought,” Yun Jianyue replied, feeling extremely annoyed. That person had been so close, and yet a grandmaster like her had lost track of them? It really was a bit embarrassing.

“Do you think it might just be you being overly suspicious?” Yan Xuehen remarked coldly. At the same time, she remembered how Zu An had recalled Mo Xi; not even she had seen anything. Could it be that the one outside was summoned by Zu An?

“My body is injured, but my eyes aren’t. How could there have been any mistake?!” Yun Jianyue snapped impatiently. At the same time, she gave Yan Xuehen a doubtful look and asked, “Who was that person just now, really?”

“How would I know?” Yan Xuehen replied. She was feeling great. Hmph, I was scared so badly earlier; now it’s your turn to feel frustrated.

“You seem to be sheltering this person…” Yun Jianyue remarked, giving her a look of suspicion.

Yan Xuehen snorted coldly and said, “You were the only one being overly suspicious from the start, thinking someone snuck into my room or something. Even when I tried to explain it to you, you didn't believe me. Now you believe it, right?”

“Why do I feel as if you’re happy about this for some reason?” Yun Jianyue asked. She felt that there was something off about Yan Xuehen’s expression, that the difference from before was too big.

“I just saw a great grandmaster like you suffer a bit; of course I’d feel happy.” Yan Xuehen felt completely relaxed at the moment, so she began her counterattack.

Yun Jianyue’s gaze suddenly shifted to the covers. She said, “I saw you grabbing onto the covers as if your life depended on it when I came in earlier. Don’t tell me there’s some incredible secret under there?”

Even though she had chased after that figure, she had returned quickly as well. Furthermore, she had been paying attention to what was happening in the room too. There was no way there would have been time for that person to get out.

Yna Xuehen’s expression turned cold. She snapped, “Witch, what kind of person do you take me for?”

Yun Jianyue’s expression also became a bit unnatural. She didn’t believe that Yan Xuehen would hide someone in her covers. But she had already searched the entire room, and Yan Xuehen’s reactions were suspicious too.

“I was just messing around with you…” Yun Jianyue said. Despite those words, she quickly grabbed the covers, not giving Yan Xuehen any time to react.

Her eyes quickly narrowed, because apart from Yan Xuehen herself, there was nothing strange at all. Did I really guess wrong?

“Ahhh!” Yan Xuehen screamed and sat up straight. She cried, “Witch, what is wrong with you?!”

Yun Jianyue felt a bit embarrassed. However, she was used to acting in an overbearing manner, so it wasn’t her style to admit mistakes. When she saw that Yan Xuehen was so injured, yet still dared to argue back, she felt annoyed. She grabbed the other woman and put her on her knees again.

“Witch, what are you doing?!” Yan Xuehen cried out furiously in alarm.

Yun Jianyue rubbed her hands together and said, “I came here with good intentions, and yet you actually treated me so rudely? In that case, you deserve to be punished!”

Zu An had a strange expression. Looks like Yan Xuehen is going to suffer again… But Yun Jianyue really has been doing this quite often. Don’t tell me she feels as if she won’t be able to do this again after Yan Xuehen recovers from her injuries?

Yan Xuehen struggled frantically. It was one thing for her to be beaten in secret, because it would just be between the two of them anyway. She’d just get revenge once she recovered. But Zu An was still there! Getting spanked by Yun Jianyue right in front of him… Forget about a grandmaster, that was a humiliation not even an ordinary woman would be willing to accept!

However, her injuries were just too serious, and she wasn’t Yun Jianyue’s match at all. Even after struggling for a while, she was still firmly pushed down by Yun Jianyue, unable to move anymore.

Pa!

A loud and clear slap rang out. A contented look appeared on Yun Jianyue’s face.

Yan Xuehen was humiliated and furious. She had actually been hit right in front of Zu An! She hissed, “Witch, you should just kill me right now. Otherwise, once I recover, I’ll definitely repay this a hundredfold.”

Yun Jianyue was a bit embarrassed. However, she exclaimed, “Huh? Why is your reaction this time so great? Didn’t you just silently accept it the last two times?”

Zu An and Yan Xuehen were speechless.

“Witch, let go of me!” Yan Xuehen protested. She felt as if she might go mad. She began to struggle again.

Yun Jianyue smiled and replied, “Tsk tsk. The more you struggle, the more excited I get!”

“You’re a freaking pervert!” Yan Xuehen complained. She wanted to cry. It was one thing being beaten in private, but Zu An could see everything at the moment! How was she supposed to raise her head again in the future?

Yun Jianyue sneered. “You actually dare to curse me? Looks like you haven’t suffered enough yet. I’m going to properly teach you a lesson today.”

Then, she tore off Yan Xuehen’s pants, and brought her palm down on the other woman’s white and fair bottom. Loud and clear slaps echoed through the room for a long time.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

How could Yan Xuehen stop her? When she felt the slight chill from below, her entire brain went blank.

Zu An opened his mouth. His brain was also ringing a bit. How could he have expected such a shocking scene?

“Wow, I didn’t expect a stone cold woman like you to have such elasticity down here…” Yun Jianyue sighed in amazement. Suddenly, she saw two lines of tears trickling down from Yan Xuehen’s eyes. She jumped in fright and asked, “You don’t have to go that far, do you? I’m not a man; so what if you get hit by me? You’re making me look as if I stole your purity or something.”
