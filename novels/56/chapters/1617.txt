Chapter 1566: News of Death

Xie Daoyun quickly began grumbling to Zu An about her little brother’s womanizing. She pointed at the assortment of gifts on the table, saying, “Look, all of these are from the academy’s female disciples. That’s not all; there are also things to wear and use, which come from those women.”

Zu An couldn't help but chuckle, replying, “What’s so bad about that? Getting gifts is better than not having anyone who would give you gifts.” He thought, These gifts are all pretty precious. Those female students really are liberal with money…

“Yeah, this just shows how awesome your little brother is!” Xie Xiu exclaimed, feeling proud when he heard someone supporting him.

“Do you think they’re treating you well for nothing? They all desire your body,” Xie Daoyun said in an intimidating tone.

Xie Xiu grumbled, “It’s hard to say who wants whom. Either way, it’s not as if I’m losing out on anything.”

Xie Daoyun felt so annoyed she grabbed his ears, retorting, “My Xie clan has always been strict with our education and never permitted our people to take advantage of others. How did we end up producing someone like you?”

“I treat every single relationship seriously; we mutually consent. What do you mean by taking advantage of others?” Xie Xiu protested, sounding a bit upset, as if his romantic affairs were being slandered.

“Then why did you abandon them?” Xie Daoyun retorted, seemingly taking it to heart.

“I’m someone who’s very dedicated to love. If I don’t love them, I won’t waste time deceiving them. Is there something wrong with that?” Xie Xiu replied with an innocent expression

Zu An could tell that Xie Xiu wasn’t just messing around, but rather that he actually believed it. Still, such behavior really was rather irresponsible. He wanted to say something, but when he thought about how he was also a playboy, he really felt a bit guilty…

“Won’t waste time? What you’re doing is just getting bored with old things!” Xie Daoyun exclaimed. As a woman, Xie Daoyun was quite sensitive toward the topic. She was so upset she started lecturing her little brother again.

Zu An finally stopped the siblings from arguing. Xie Daoyun was a bit embarrassed, saying, “I’ve made a fool of myself in front of big brother Zu.”

“There’s nothing like that. On the contrary, I feel as if I’ve returned to Brightmoon City. It’s a sense of reuniting with friends from my hometown,” Zu An said with a smile.

Xie Xiu immediately felt much better when he heard that. As expected, it’s still men who understand other men best!

After they chatted for a while longer, Xie Xiu felt a bit curious about what was happening on the Fiend races’ side. He asked, “Big brother Zu, I heard that you made a huge contribution on the Fiend races’ side. Can you tell us more about that side? Do they really eat people?”

Xie Daoyun was full of curiosity too. She had only learned about that side from books ever since she was little. Neither of the siblings had ever been to the Fiend races’ territory themselves.

Zu An couldn't help but chuckle, saying, “They’re not that scary…” Then, he began to tell them about the Fiend races’ local customs and living conditions. The two siblings clicked their tongues in wonder.

“Right, I came back with a special gift this time. It should suit you quite well,” Zu An said, taking out the Exotic Witchsand from his Brilliant Glass Bead. He had obtained it from the Fiend King Court’s Jade Garden.

“Exotic Witchsand?” Xie Daoyun remarked, recognizing what it was before Zu An even introduced it. She was so excited her entire body was shaking. “This item can be used to create the legendary forbidden rune formations! Even master only used it in the past, but doesn’t have any left. He’s been searching all this time, and yet never found any!”

Such a thing would be precious for other cultivators, but it didn’t have much use for Zu An. However, for rune cultivators, it was equivalent to a divine item. That was why Xie Daoyun couldn't believe it was real.

After her initial shock, Xie Daoyun quickly refused, saying, “Big brother Zu, this item is too precious! I can’t take it.”

Zu An pulled her hand over and placed it into her hands, replying, “If not for the protection talisman you gave me, I would already have lost my life. Compared to saving my life, this Exotic Witchsand is nothing.”

Xie Daoyun instinctively pulled back her hand when they made contact. However, after she pulled her hand back, she couldn't really continue her protests. Her elegant face immediately turned red as she said, “My protection talisman wasn’t that amazing at all… But thank you, big brother Zu.”

Zu An let go, feeling satisfied when he saw her take it.

Xie Daoyun pursed her lips. At that moment, she looked very conflicted. She seemed happy, but also worried.

Xie Xiu suddenly remarked in a strange tone, “Who said just a moment ago that gifts were only given because someone wanted your body?”

“Do you want to die?!” Xie Daoyun cried out, feeling ashamed. She ran over to beat him up.

Xie Xiu dodged while reaching his hand out to Zu An, asking, “Brother Zu, what about my gift?”

Zu An glanced at the mountain of gifts on the side. He smiled and replied, “You already have so many women to give you gifts, so there’s no need for me to go through the trouble.”

Xie Xiu quickly cried out, “Brother Zu, you really are the type to neglect friends for love!”

Zu An quietly stuck out his foot, and Xie Xiu lost his center of balance, falling into Xie Daoyun’s clutches. He was disciplined on the spot. The entire room was filled with cheerful laughter and chatter.

“What are you all chatting so happily about?” someone asked curiously just then. It turned out that Chu Chuyan had returned.

Xie Daoyun stopped beating up her little brother, recovering her usual wise, virtuous, and ladylike demeanor. She replied, “It’s just a fight between siblings. We’ve made a joke out of ourselves in front of Miss Chu.”

Xie Xiu couldn't help but ask with a sigh, “Miss Chu, just what did you eat to grow that big? Why do you seem more and more like an immortal now?”

Xie Daoyun shot her little brother a glare, snapping, “Watch your mouth.” She knew about her little brother’s playboy nature and was scared that he would go after Chu Chuyan.

Xie Xiu wrinkled his nose. He wasn’t crazy enough to do something like that. Even though Chu Chuyan was pretty, she was a bit too outstanding. If someone so outstanding played his temperamental game of love, he would already be dead without knowing how he died. A woman at that level was someone he wouldn’t even touch. Staying away would save him endless trouble.

Everyone else in the world was jealous of the beauties at Zu An’s side, but only he sympathized with Zu An. Zu An didn’t have much chance to play at all! Women of that caliber would definitely be far fewer in number than what he had.

Zu An was confused. Why do I sense pity in Xie Xiu’s eyes when he looks at me? However, he didn’t have the time to think about that, as his attention quickly returned to Chu Chuyan. He asked, “Did you finish what you have to do?”

Chu Chuyan voiced her confirmation. Thus, Zu An got up and said, “I need to see the libationer for something, so you should wait here for me.”

Chu Chuyan replied in surprise, “But the libationer has already left.”

“Huh?” Zu An exclaimed, stunned.

Chu Chuyan said, “I passed on what my sect entrusted to me. When he looked through it, he flew into the sky. I don’t know where he went after that.”

Zu An was immediately dejected. Once the libationer disappeared, who knew when he could be found again?

Chu Chuyan continued, “Right, I’ve always thought that little sister Zheng Dan was quite good, but because of her family, she’s never had much room to do much. So, I asked the libationer to take her on as his disciple, but he said that he wouldn’t receive any more disciples. Later, however, when he heard of Zheng Dan’s past, he decided to place her under his first disciple.” She paused for a moment, then looked at Xie Daoyun, saying, “At that time, Zheng Dan will be sisters under the same master as Miss Xie. I hope Miss Xie can look out for her.”

“Huh?” Xie Daoyun replied, briefly distracted. Then, she eventually reacted, saying, “We used to be fellow students, and we came from the same place. Of course we need to watch out for each other.”

She was a bit curious why Chu Chuyan would do so much for Zheng Dan. She had heard the rumors about Zheng Dan and big brother Zu before, though. Could it be that Zheng Dan had already received Miss Chu’s recognition?

Sigh, Chu Chuyan’s nature really is something else. I can’t even muster any feeling of going against her.

Zu An was overjoyed by the unexpected good news, because he had wanted to seek out the libationer precisely to solve Zheng Dan’s issue. With her aptitude and temperament, being neglected in the Sang clan was just too much of a waste. He hadn’t expected Chu Chuyan to be on the same wavelength, thinking the same thing.

More importantly, that act meant she already accepted Zheng Dan’s presence. He didn’t have to worry as much about their relationship anymore.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Right, what did you need to see the libationer for?” Chu Chuyan suddenly asked, curious.

“It’s nothing, not important at all,” Zu An replied with a big smile on his face.

Meanwhile, in the Imperial Palace, the emperor received top-secret information from the Embroidery House. He replied with a grim expression, “Golden Token Seven[1] died?”
