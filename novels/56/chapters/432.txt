Chapter 432: Malding

Translator: Pika

A sudden thought occurred to Chu Zhongtian as he heard this. “By the way, isn’t Chuyan in the capital? Have her make some preparations and see if she can do something about this.”

Qin Wanru shook her head. “She should already be on her way back to Brightmoon City. I lent the recording mirror to Zu An, so we have no way of contacting her.”

Chu Zhongtian stared blankly for a moment, then sighed. “Is this fate?”

...

While the Chu clan was in despair, the others around them bustled with energy.

Xie Yi took his leave after saying a few things to Chu Zhongtian. He was in a rush to report the matter of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra to King Qi.

Quite a few people here had similar ideas, although they all had different powers behind them.

Jiang Luofu gazed in the direction the carriage had taken. Her beautiful brows were knit together in a frown. This was an extremely difficult problem.

“This kid keeps making others worry for him!” She said with a huff. With a flicker, she disappeared.

Within another building, a beautiful figure stood behind a window. Even though her face was hidden by the window, her voluptuous figure still gave away her identity.

Pei Mianman continuously twirled her hair between her fingers. She muttered to herself, “This guy never fails to surprise me! Sigh... if I had known this was how things were going to turn out, I would have brought you over to my side earlier! But this is fine as well. At least I don’t have to fight Chuyan for you anymore.”

Her smile quickly disappeared. Fighting against the emperor was much more difficult.

“It looks like I need to go back and beg my clan for help. I’m pretty sure they’ll be interested, though.” With that, she turned and left, leaving nothing but a faint fragrance lingering in the air.

At the same time, within the academy, a young lady was resting her chin on her hand. “Stinky brother-in-law, it’s been so long already! Why aren’t you back yet?”

...

“Achoo! Achoo! Achoo...”

Zu An sneezed again and again in his prison carriage. He sighed. “There are definitely beauties thinking about me, and more than one at that.”

Zheng Dan rolled her eyes at him. “Teacher Zu truly is as narcissistic as ever.”

There were so many eyes around them, and Sang Qian’s ears were sure to be constantly perked up, so she didn’t dare to say anything out of the ordinary. She could only interact with Zu An through her persona of Zheng First Miss.

Zu An laughed. “What can I say? It can’t be helped that I’m so welcome wherever I go.”

Zheng Dan couldn’t hold back a sigh. “I don’t know if I should praise Teacher Zu for your optimism, or laugh at your stupidity. Do you know that your fate is already sealed, now that you are being brought to the capital?”

She used her mocking words to mask her inner concern for him. She just couldn’t understand why this fella would show himself like that.

You have successfully trolled Zheng Dan for 233 Rage points!

Zu An was stunned by the sudden inflow of Rage points. However, he quickly caught onto what was going on. “Could Miss Zheng somehow be jealous?”

Zheng Dan flicked her head to the side. “Please conduct yourself with dignity!” she said with a huff.

That’s what I’m talking about! In the other prison carriage, Sang Qian’s face immediately lit up when he heard his wife’s words. If not for his restrictions, he would have cheered and given her a round of applause.

Zu An scooted over towards Zheng Dan just a little, and shot Sang Qian a taunting look. “What are you looking at? Come at me if you have the guts!”

Sang Qian worked his jaw visibly.

I’m going to fucking kill you!

He was on the verge of exploding when he saw Zu An inching closer and closer to his wife, yet he couldn’t do anything about it. He was making a bunch of sounds, but he couldn’t speak any words because the acupoint in his throat was sealed.

This only made him even more angry.

You have successfully trolled Sang Qian for 999 Rage points!

He could only continuously smack the bars of the prison carriage while screaming towards the soldiers.

“What is it?” The soldier that was looking after the prison carriage turned around impatiently.

Sang Qian pointed at Zu An and gestured to describe his anger.

That soldier said impatiently, “They’re not even close to each other. What are you getting so anxious about?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Sang Qian became even more distressed. Wouldn’t it be too late once the two of them were next to each other?

Another soldier berated him as well. “What can he do, with so many people watching? Please get your mind out of the gutter! We’ll have no choice but to treat you poorly if you don’t quiet down!”

If it had been any other time, they might have treated Sang Qian and his father a little better. After all, Sang Hong was at the eighth rank, and there was still a chance for them to make a comeback.

However, King Liang’s instructions had made it clear to them that the father and son of the Sang clan were both finished.

King Liang had access to more information than them. If even he didn’t care to treat these two with any respect, it surely meant that there were too many problems facing these two. As subordinates, they might not be skilled at other things, but they were masters of reading the situation.

It was obvious to them that they didn’t have to treat Sang Qian with much respect. Furthermore, given how much King Liang cared about Zu An, they knew which of them was the real young master.

Forget about Zu An sitting a little closer, they wouldn’t even have stopped him if he really threw himself at Zheng Dan. Either way, they would be treated to quite a scene—why would they be against that?

Of course, Sang Qian was still an official, and he clearly understood what was happening. He was completely furious. You bootlicking dogs, just wait until I get out! I’m going to kill that Zu An first, and then I’ll slaughter the two of you!

Sang Qian’s manic activity did not escape Zheng Dan’s notice. She couldn’t help but say, “Why do you have to provoke him?”

Zu An laughed and said, “It can’t be helped. We just don’t get along! He gets irritated when he sees me, and I get angry when I see him as well.”

Zheng Dan gave him an annoyed look. “Haven’t you bullied him enough already?”

Zu An laughed. This was a secret only the two of them shared.

The beauty in front of him was dressed in a magnificent wedding dress that had been carefully prepared for her. It was decorated with ninety-nine gemstones, which had been the Sang clan’s betrothal gift. They made her seem even more gorgeous and glamorous.

He didn’t have the time to admire it before. Now that he could see her up close, Zu An was stunned. He sighed and said, “You really are stunning. You look so beautiful even when you’re angry.”

“Mmmm mm mm!” Sang Qian slammed his hands against the side of his carriage again. This bastard is taking advantage of my wife!

The sight of his own delicate and beautiful wife being teased by this scoundrel was enough to send blood shooting into his eyes.

You have successfully trolled Sang Qian for 1024 Rage points!

Zu An turned around. “Hey man, what the heck is wrong with you? Just ask anyone here! They’ll all agree with me that Miss Zheng is pretty! Should I curse her for being an ugly hag? Would that make you happy? You’re so fucking weird.”

“Exactly!” The soldiers all directed scornful looks at Sang Qian. What’s wrong with praising your wife for being pretty? Aren’t you a little too sensitive?

Sang Qian couldn’t contain himself anymore.

I’m going to fucking... The other party clearly has ill intentions. Why is this somehow my fault?

He almost fainted on the spot!

You have successfully trolled Sang Qian for 999... 999... 999...

Sang Hong reached out a hand and pushed him back down. He wrote on the ground with his finger, “Eyes closed, mind at peace.”

Sang Qian was so angry that he was about to vomit blood. His thoughts were obvious from his expression. “Am I supposed to just let him bully my new wife?”

Sang Hong continued to write, “Has he done anything yet? And even if he has, have you already forgotten what I told you before?”

Sang Qian stared blankly for a moment. Then, he remembered the advice his father had given him when he first used his wife as a honey trap to investigate the mysterious expert supporting Zu An. Back then, his father had said that, even if his wife really did do something, he should never act out on the spot, but find the proper way to maximize his own benefit instead.

However, understanding this logically was one thing. Whether or not he could accomplish this was something else. Seeing the bastard cheekily eyeing his new bride was enough to set a malicious flame burning within him.

Zu An was even a bit worried when he saw how many Rage points were coming in. This guy really is malding... I hope he doesn’t go completely bald.
