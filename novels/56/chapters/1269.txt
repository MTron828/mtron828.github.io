Chapter 1218: Too Smart

Even though Yun Jianyue was teasing her rival, she was actually a bit worried. She had been sleeping next door, but was suddenly roused awake when she sensed the killing intent that had erupted from Yan Xuehen’s room.

Yan Xuehen was so injured right now, and it was the dead of night. Why would she suddenly use force? Some scoundrel had definitely snuck in.

Yun Jianyue had actually felt amused when she first realized that. After all, the two of them had fought for so many years. They were more enemies than friends.

She really had enough of the double standards the world had for the two of them. She really wanted to see what it would be like once the world’s ‘immortal fairy’ fell down into the mundane world.

After a while of tumbling back and forth, however, she’d suddenly discovered that she wasn’t as happy as she had imagined. Instead, she was actually feeling a bit worried about Yan Xuehen.

Yan Xuehen was still a grandmaster, someone of the same level as herself. Even if Yan Xuehen were to be humiliated, she had to be the one to humiliate her, not some random scoundrel.

She could no longer sit still when she thought of that, and went over to ask about it. Of course, there was no way she would admit that she was actually worried about something happening to Yan Xuehen. Instead, her words were full of mockery.

However, that actually gave Yan Xuehen a fright. Previously, when she had gone to Zu An’s room, she could justify her actions by saying that she was paying him a visit. Even helping him apply medicine wasn’t too absurd of a matter. But this was her own room, and she was in her nightwear. What would Yun Jianyue think if she saw her with Zu An at that moment?

It would be impossible to explain no matter what she said! That was, unless she told Yun Jianyue about ‘Love Is More Solid than Gold’. However, that was not only her greatest secret, but also related to the glory and humiliation of the White Jade Sect. If Yun Jianyue found out, it would make her feel worse than death.

She took a deep breath and replied, “I made some progress in my recovery, so I decided to test something out.”

Zu An widened his eyes. This woman looked as pure as driven snow, and yet she didn’t even blink as she spoke such a blatant lie.

“Is that so? Your injuries recovered so quickly that you were able to act so willfully?” Yun Jianyue replied doubtfully.

“Witch, is there something wrong with you? It’s already the middle of the night,” Yan Xuehen replied. She was getting a bit annoyed. Even though she could also guess that Yun Jianyue was worried about her, Zu An’s damn skill was about to be broken, and yet the other woman had come over to interrupt them. Yun Jianyue really had no sense of timing.

“Stone cold woman, you really can’t recognize others’ good intentions! If someone takes advantage of you, you deserve it!” Yun Jianyue shot back, also getting a bit annoyed. She stormed off in a huff.

Yan Xuehen finally sighed in relief. She was about to say something to Zu An when Yun Jianyue suddenly appeared by the doorway again and said, “Forget it, open-minded people don’t bicker with the petty. I’ll forgive you this once. Hurry and open up.”

“I’m fine! You don’t need to help me.” Yan Xuehen gestured for Zu An to hide while replying. Zu An first recalled Mo Xi to make it easier for himself to hide.

Yan Xuehen’s eyes quickly widened. Why did that person vanish into thin air? Even with her grandmaster rank perception, she didn’t see how the other person had disappeared.

Yun Jianyue called out again, sounding serious. “If you were fine, you wouldn’t have emphasized that you’re fine. Something is definitely wrong!”

Yan Xuehen’s eyes widened as she replied, “But I didn’t say anything like that!”

“Of course you can’t speak. I fully understand your situation; you probably can’t say what you really want to say right now. It’s fine; you only need to reply yes or no to my questions.” Yun Jianyue specially changed to ki transmissions when she said that. She even added, “Remember, you have to act natural.”

Yan Xuehen was caught up in a huge storm all of a sudden. Never would she have expected Yun Jianyue to have assumed she was in such a situation.

“Did a man sneak into your room?” Yun Jianyue quickly asked.

“No!” Yan Xuehen immediately replied.

Zu An was confused. Why had she suddenly said that? Were they talking through ki?

Yun Jianyue couldn't help but clench her fists. She replied, “You’re quite smart; you know to say the opposite. I understand. Who is this person? Are they human? Snake race? Or maybe from a different fiend race?”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Yan Xuehen was speechless. She shot back, “Stop guessing randomly already!” She was really panicking at the moment. When she saw that Zu An was still pacing back and forth, she shot him a look. Her intentions were clear: Why haven’t you hidden yourself yet?

Zu An shrugged. There’s nowhere to hide here, you know?

There was a wardrobe, but after what had happened before, checking it would definitely be Yun Jianyue’s first instinct. As for any other places, because Yan Xuehen was used to simple and quiet environments, she had made sure to have Yu Yanluo arrange a neat little room. However, that made it so that there weren’t any places to hide at all.

“Stop guessing?” Yun Jianyue frowned. She continued, “That means I guessed incorrectly. Don’t tell me Zu An came over?”

Yan Xuehen’s forehead darkened. What is up with this witch? No matter what she said, the other woman would always interpret it in a weird way. The worst part was that she was getting closer and closer!

“Is the other person one person or multiple?” Yun Jianyue asked, looking around her. She thought to herself that once she broke in, she had to be prepared. Otherwise, she would look bad if the other party injured the stone cold woman.

“Do you think the glorious Snake race’s Clan Leader Manor is some market? Why would anyone be able to sneak in?!” After thinking for a bit, Yan Xuehen decided to use logic against her.

“If it’s not a market, that means there aren’t many people. Oh, there’s only one person.” Yun Jianyue’s eyes lit up. “And since you said that no one would be able to sneak in, this means that it’s one of this manor’s people who has decided to do evil.”

Yan Xuehen felt as if she were about to go mad. She replied, “Witch, are you crazy? We’re talking through ki right now. If there really was something, why wouldn’t I just tell you?”

“That may not be the case.” Yun Jianyue sneered. “You came from the orthodox sects, which means you care about a lot of things. There’s a chance that you are being threatened by someone right now. There’s a good chance that someone might know something that puts you completely at their mercy, and that’s why you can’t speak the truth.”

She began to think to herself, If there’s only a single person, it won’t be that hard to deal with.

Even though she was injured, she had the vision and experiences of a grandmaster. Furthermore, she came from the Holy Sect, making her proficient in various assassination methods. It wouldn’t be too difficult for her to deal with an ordinary enemy at all.

“The one who loves bullying me the most is probably you!” Yan Xuehen replied in alarm. Is this woman a freaking mind reader? She kept trying to chase Yun Jianyue away, and yet the other person was getting closer and closer to the truth.

“Looks like you have a bit of resentment toward what happened over these past few days. But only I can bully you; how can I let anyone else bully you?” Yun Jianyue replied, her smile quickly fading. “Get ready, I’m about to break in. Cooperate with me in taking down that scoundrel.”

Yan Xuehen immediately panicked. If she had known that things were going to be like this, she would have just said that it was Zu An who was present! However, she had tried to hide it the entire time. If Yun Jianyue really did barge in and saw the two of them together, there was no way she could properly explain things!

When she heard Yun Jianyue start to count down, she knew that nothing she said would matter anymore. She immediately urged Zu An to go into hiding, but for some time, she had already noticed that there really was nowhere for him to hide.

Her gaze moved to the bed next to her. She gritted her teeth, then pulled Zu An over to the side of the bed, shoving him under the covers. She hissed, “Don’t say anything!” Then, she also jumped into bed and covered herself with the blanket.

Almost at the very moment she did that, the door was quickly smashed open. A faint yellow light surrounded the place, and the pressure of a grandmaster instantly filled the room.
