Chapter 1504: Doing All the Work for Another

I was known as the child blessed by the heavens, someone most of my peers looked up to in admiration! It wasn’t only because of my status, but also because of my cultivation. I had my father personally instruct me, and my talent was extraordinary. That was why my cultivation advanced so quickly.

I can still remember second brother following behind me, begging me to teach him some things before. Back then, I saw him like an ant. He would become really, really happy if I just told him even a little bit. How could I have known that I would die to that person?

Just how did he reach this level? Did he sell his soul to the devil?

No, his cultivation isn’t actually that high, and his real strength is lower than mine. But I could feel that for some reason, I couldn't use all of my strength.

Could it be that my will faltered after being defeated by Zu An again and again?

Meanwhile, the Second Prince’s will remained firm, and he was always filled with resentment over the unfairness of life, so that was why he was able to display a hundred and twenty percent of his strength. Between my weakness and his strength, that was why I was defeated by him.

I can’t accept this!

I was clearly about to become the Fiend Emperor, so why did this happen?

“Crown Prince!” Elder Wu, who was fighting in the distance, felt as if his eye sockets were splitting apart. He immediately flew over.

However, a black ripple suddenly appeared in the sky. A slender, pitch-black sword reached out from within. It was like a sickle from hell. A treacherous arc slashed through the air, and Elder Wu’s head flew off his shoulders.

Elder Wu had been focused on saving the Crown Prince, while the rest of his attention was tied up in remaining on guard against Sixth Uncle’s attacks. How could he have anticipated that there would be another grandmaster rank cultivator here?

The spinning head vaguely made out a handsome, fiendish figure walking out from the black vortex. His mouth opened wide and he exclaimed, “Dark elf!”

Unfortunately, he was unable to utter another word before falling into eternal darkness.

After cultivating to his level, his regeneration ability had become extremely powerful. Even if he was seriously injured, he would be able to slowly recover given some time. He could even regrow a severed arm or leg.

However, that was only if he didn’t suffer a fatal blow. The head was the most important part of the body. There was no coming back after losing one’s head.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince recognized the dark figure. He was the Dark Elf King’s younger brother, Duantian Chou. He was a famous genius from the Dark Elves. He had never expected the Second Prince to have even gotten someone like that on his side! The loss this time wasn’t entirely unreasonable.

The Second Prince’s side clearly had the advantage in their trump cards, and on top of that, Duantian Chou had remained in hiding all this time. When he interfered, victory and defeat had instantly been decided. How treacherous!

Still, he wasn’t willing to die just like this. He secretly used the Golden Crow Sacred Fire to repair his crushed heart. The Golden Crow Sacred Fire was the Golden Crow Royal Family’s most powerful self-healing ability; in the past, he had been able to recover even after having the entire lower half of his body blown up by Zu An. Naturally, he was able to regenerate his heart too.

He was worried that the Second Prince would notice something, so he didn’t even dare to use the Golden Crow Sacred Fire too overtly, and he pretended to be dead. He carefully circulated it around his heart to secretly recover. He knew he had already suffered a crushing defeat today, but as long as he was still alive, there would be chances to make a comeback.

Soon, however, a strong gust of wind swept past. The Second Prince’s voice soon reached his ears. “Do you know how far I went for the sake of defeating you, just how thorough my research has been in all these years? Every single detail of your life, every single skill you have, I know it all like the back of my hand. I even know clearly how long you can last with women. Did you really think I would make the mistake of overlooking you playing dead?”

He swiftly thrust his hand through the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s body. When it left, it was clutching a heart wrapped in golden flames, which throbbed slowly.

The Second Prince threw the heart into his mouth and swallowed it. A satisfied smile appeared on his face as he said, “Ah, the hearts of the strong are truly delicious. I can feel my body surge with power. I am becoming bigger, and I am becoming stronger!”CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Golden Crow Crown Prince could no longer hold on. He spat out a mouthful of blood and died just like that.

The Second Prince lifted up the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s corpse like that of a dead dog, calling out, “The Crown Prince has already died. Cease your futile struggle. I will spare those who surrender!”

When they saw the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s corpse, the Crown Prince’s many trusted aides immediately wept bitter tears and howled in pain. Then, they drew their swords to end their own lives. They knew that as the Crown Prince’s trusted aides, there was no good end awaiting them. Rather than begging the Second Prince to kill them, they would rather do it themselves; there was no need to trouble the other side.

Afterward, the morale of the lower-level soldiers fully crumbled, leaving them without any intention of resisting. They all threw their weapons away and kneeled toward the Second Prince in surrender.

When he saw the Crown Prince’s people all bowing toward him, the Second Prince finally couldn't hold it in anymore. He clutched his face and laughed madly. “HA HA HA HA…”

He had waited for this day for far too long. Decades of painstaking plotting, even for someone with a will as firm as his, had carried doubts; he had felt uncertain several times along the way. After all, anyone would think this task lacked the slightest chance of success.

But this impossible feat… I’ve achieved it!

Now that I’ve taken in the Crown Prince’s subordinates, there’s no one stronger than me in the entire Fiend King Court! Who else would be fit for the position of Fiend Emperor but me?!

Duantian Chou spoke up in his sinister voice. “Second Prince, now that the Crown Prince has been eliminated, what is most important is entering the palace and taking control over everything, then summoning all of the officials into the palace for an audience.”

A near-crazed glint flickered through his eyes. At that time, the Great Elf King would have to move to the palace as well. Duantian Chou would kill him when he least expected it, and the thousand-year grudge between the Elves and the Dark Elves would reach its conclusion.

My big brother will definitely be completely shocked, right? His expression will no doubt be really interesting then, hehe~

No one knew what he was thinking, but Duantian Chou’s eyes carried a hint of zealotry and strange madness.

The Second Prince reflexively made some space between them. The Dark Elves were all crazy, and they were crazy people who were good at killing. No one was willing to be within three feet of a Dark Elf; otherwise, their life and death would no longer be in their hands.

“Fine. We are heading to the Imperial Palace!” the Second Prince then replied.

They quickly incorporated the Crown Prince’s troops into their own ranks, then marched toward the Imperial Palace. Soon afterward, they heard sounds of battle. The Second Prince frowned.

A subordinate came to report, “I believe they are Grand Secretary Heichi Fei and Right Guard General Niu Dao’s men.”

The Second Prince sneered. The Crown Prince had really underestimated him. If he had gathered all of his forces, I might not have won, and yet he just had to split up his troops. If he didn’t end up losing, who else would?

The sounds of slaughter slowly became quieter and quieter. When the Second Prince came closer, he saw that it had indeed been Heichi Fei and Niu Dao fighting against each other. Niu Dao was carrying the Third Prince. The two both lay in pools of blood, already dead.

From the looks of it, Niu Dao, who was loyal to the late emperor, had thought he only had to capture the Third Prince. He hadn’t agreed with Heichi Fei’s decision to kill the Third Prince, so a dispute had started, leading to an internal conflict.

Niu Dao wasn’t a match for Heichi Fei. Furthermore, his opponent had the Crown Prince’s support, so the numerous Golden Crow Guards couldn't just stand to the side without doing anything. In the end, he had faced impossible odds and was killed by Heichi Fei.

“Hmph, you should learn to adapt to the times!” Heichi Fei remarked, spitting on the ground. Suddenly, he saw the Second Prince’s group and exclaimed, “Crown Prince, you have returned… Huh? Why is it you?!” The first half of his sentence was full of joy, but the latter half suddenly increased in pitch, his voice filling with shock.

The Second Prince’s gaze shifted to Niu Dao and the Third Prince’s corpses. He thought, The Crown Prince really did take care of everything for me.

I felt that my brothers were a bit annoying anyway. Now, it looks as if I don’t have to deal with them myself.

“Why can it not be me?” the Second Prince replied, happily admiring Heichi Fei’s look of alarm. He waved his hand and asked, “Is he the one you were waiting for?”

His subordinate brought over a wooden stretcher that had the Crown Prince’s corpse tied to it. It also carried the heads of Elder Wu, Commandant of Guards Wu Li, Left Guard General Ma Tian, and a few others.

When he saw that, Heichi Fei felt as if his entire body had fallen into a frozen cellar. He screamed, then turned to run. However, a black vortex suddenly appeared in front of him, and a slender sword emerged from it, sending his head flying.

Duantian Chou gave his sword a lick and said, “The taste of blood is so delicious, especially the blood of the strong.”
