Chapter 1836: Not Owning Up

As it turned out, it was just the passage that was blocked. Once it was cleared, it revealed a spacious area ahead.

The women’s faces were all red, and there was a layer of fine sweat around their temples. They had all been worried that they would completely destroy this place if they used too much force, so they had needed to maintain all their focus; that left them extremely tense. It was to the extent that even simple things left them much more exhausted than normal.

“Chuyan, what do you think Ah Zu is doing right now?” Pei Mianman asked, fanning herself with her hand while asking the blue-clad woman next to her.

“I don’t know. He might be fighting a bitter battle right now,” Chu Chuyan said with a frown; she was clearly extremely worried.

“Don’t worry. That guy is always full of weird tricks. He should be fine,” Yan Xuehen said in consolation, but she didn’t have much confidence either.

After all, there had been such a huge disturbance in the tomb, which meant something major had taken place below. All sorts of terrifying energies had emerged, making the entire great tomb more and more dangerous.

However, no one was willing to leave, because Zu An was still down there. They didn’t know if he was alive or not, but they couldn't just abandon him.

“Not only is he fine, he might even be having the time of his life indulging in pleasure.” Yun Jianyue harrumphed. That brat was a walking aphrodisiac. Just a few days apart and he’d bring back another woman. Jing Teng was also with him down there, after all.

Yan Xuehen gave her an annoyed look and said, “There is no way that could be the case. The Ghost King is still chasing them right now.”

“I guess you’re right,” Yun Jianyue said; instead of getting annoyed, she also started worrying.

“It would be great if that Ghost King were a woman. I’ve never had to worry about Ah Zu suffering from a female enemy,” Pei Mianman suddenly said.

A lot of them suddenly had strange expressions. Most of them had at one point been Zu An’s enemy, but not only had Zu An not suffered at all, they had been the ones on the losing end instead.

“There’s no way Ah Zu will bring that Ghost King to bed, right?” Qiu Honglei couldn't help but wonder with a harrumph.

The others couldn't help but laugh too. That kind of thing was clearly too absurd.

It’s impossible for humans…

…

Meanwhile, in the depths of the great tomb, the very Ghost King they spoke of was struggling. She sobbed, “It hurts! I don’t want to do it anymore!”

Zu An was stunned, asking, “What is going on?”

He seemed to have broken through something earlier, but he and Jing Teng had been intimate not too long beforehand! Could that kind of wound really be healed just like that?

“You still have the nerve to ask that?!” Dark Jing Teng exclaimed, biting down on his shoulder fiercely. “I can’t be the only one hurting here!”

Then, through her stuttering explanation, Zu An realized what happened. It turned out that in order to free herself from the Lord of Black Mist’s control, she had chosen to completely merge with her big sister. The two were sisters from the same source, so they merged together easily. It involved a combination of both sisters’ best traits, so some of the body’s wounds were naturally repaired…

Zu An was also really embarrassed. He had thought that he was just making love with his girlfriend, and they had already done it before, so it would be much easier. How could he have known that this girl had become a virgin again?

No, this wasn’t a virgin’s body, but rather their shared new body…

Sigh, what in the world is going on…

How could Zu An have predicted that there would be something so inconceivable in this world?

“I’m really sorry,” Zu An said, reflexively trying to pull out. He had thought that it was Jing Teng’s body anyway, and yet now, how could he continue?

However, Dark Jing Teng’s legs clamped down on him and she retorted, “If you leave now, then wouldn’t I have been hurt for nothing?”

Zu An’s expression darkened and he said, “We have to swiftly cut our losses.”

“I’m even about to lose my life, so what losses are we cutting? Just continue, and save me and my big sister. Do you think this king is scared of you?!” Dark Jing Teng hissed through clenched teeth.

Zu An figured that made sense too. He quickly set aside his wayward thoughts and channeled primordial ki between the two of them to repair Jing Teng’s body, keeping it from breaking down.

Dark Jing Teng couldn't help but groan. She looked at him unhappily, tears glimmering in her eyes as she asked,

“Are you really not some donkey fiend?”

Zu An frowned and replied, “Of course I’m human!”

Dark Jing Teng harrumphed. “I really have no idea how big sister was able to handle you before. Did she cry back then?”

“Um… No,” Zu An replied.

Dark Jing Teng’s expression was full of doubt and shock. She secretly wiped away her tears and said through clenched teeth, “If even she could take it, there’s no reason I can’t. Continue!”

…

“Were you gentler with my big sister and rougher with me?”

“No.”

“You definitely were! You’re definitely holding a grudge because I beat you like a dog before, so you must be using this as a chance to get revenge!”

“Do you want to try what it would feel like if I really tried to get revenge?”

“Do you think this king is scared of your revenge?”

…

“Stop, I’m sorry! I was wrong! This humble one couldn't recognize the generosity of a gentleman! Please…”

…

After a long time passed, Dark Jing Teng’s entire face was red as she lay completely limp against Zu An’s body. She said, “No wonder big sister likes you so much. So this kind of thing was actually so wonderful.”Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Zu An said impatiently, “It’s not as if she likes me because of this kind of thing.”

“Is there a difference?” Dark Jing Teng replied impatiently. “Did she not like this earlier?”

When he recalled White Jing Teng’s gentle and charming expression, Zu An couldn't refute that.

Suddenly, White Jing Teng exclaimed in alarm, “What are the two of you doing?”

“Enjoying your man, of course,” Dark Jing Teng said, raising a brow. As if she were wishing for chaos to take the world, she said, “This guy really is a sex demon. He knows I’m your little sister, and yet, not only did he not stop, he even went harder.”

Zu An was speechless. Now that he knew that White Jing Teng was awake, he quickly stopped Dark Jing Teng from starting more drama and said, “Just now, I was actually trying to save the two of you.”

White Jing Teng temporarily seized control of her body again and asked, “You were going to save us like that?”

When he saw her strange expression, Zu An could only give her a rough account of what happened.

White Jing Teng’s face turned entirely red when she heard that. Dark Jing Teng took over and asked, “Hmph, you know what I’m really curious about? What if we were men? Would you still save us all the same? Through the same method?”

Zu An’s expression darkened and he said, “I would have buried you properly.”

“Tsk~” Dark Jing Teng harrumphed. “In the end, isn’t it all because you’re perverted? You actually learned such a biased way of saving others. I’m definitely judging you right now.”

Zu An was getting a headache from all of this. This woman was completely different from her big sister; her chattering just never stopped! Even while they were doing ‘those’ things, she had been saying all sorts of things, only becoming a bit more obedient later on. And yet, now that she caught her breath again, she was right back to being a brat.

“Enough. Big brother Zu did that to save us,” White Jing Teng said.

“What do you mean, us? He was clearly trying to save you,” Dark Jing Teng said in annoyance.

“Weren’t you saved too? And who was it that was having a good time just now? You were even moaning so shamelessly.” White Jing Teng harrumphed. She had actually already recovered her consciousness because of the nourishment of primordial ki, but her injuries were more severe than her sister’s, so she had only been able to give up control over her body for the time being.

“What moaning? I was clearly doing your man! I was toying with him!” Dark Jing Teng quickly replied.

Zu An didn’t feel like disputing this sensitive topic with them and quickly asked, “How are your injuries now? How much have you recovered?”

Both women fell silent. A while later, White Jing Teng replied, “That being’s attack was just too strong. It’s thanks to your… help that our injuries have stabilized for now, though. As of right now, it doesn’t seem as if our injuries will worsen.

“Still, if we want to make a full recovery, only someone close to that being’s power could completely erase the power of destruction still inside us. That’s why we haven’t really recovered much.”

Zu An understood what they meant. Judging from the sound of things, there was no danger to their lives, but they hadn’t made any progress in their recovery at all.

“Even so, where would we find someone on par with that being?” Zu An asked with a grave expression. Even though he was getting stronger quickly, his power was still many orders of magnitude away from matching that being.

White Jing Teng suddenly replied, “There is actually a method, which is for us to return to the Demon-Suppressing Talisman. Now that our injuries have recovered, as long as we familiarize ourselves with the talisman again, we should be able to return inside and use the talisman’s power to slowly recover.”

Zu An was overjoyed, but he quickly noticed her expression. He was startled and asked, “How long would that take?”

White Jing Teng didn’t say anything. Dark Jing Teng said, “I’d say tens of thousands of years at the very least.”

Zu An was speechless.

Tens of thousands of years? My own grave will already be overgrown with weeds who knows how many times over!

White Jing Teng said, “Compared to tens of thousands of years of loneliness, I would rather be with you. Little sister, you can go back by yourself.”

Dark Jing Teng immediately cried out, “Are you kidding me? I can only handle that power of destruction by being with you! If we separate, I’ll immediately be wiped out by that power!”

White Jing Teng’s expression changed. She was momentarily troubled.

Dark Jing Teng said, “Actually, you don’t need to feel that conflicted. After getting used to the outside world’s pleasures, I don’t really want to stay here all alone for tens of thousands of years either. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have tried to run away.”

“What are you trying to say?” White Jing Teng asked, stunned.

“I’m going with big sister and brother-in-law, of course. Furthermore, brother-in-law assaulted me just now, so he has to take responsibility, right?”

“That was my body.”

“Isn’t it also my body? Brother-in-law, say something, won’t you? You aren’t going to pull up your pants and not own up, are you?”

Zu An was speechless.
