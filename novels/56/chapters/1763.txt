Chapter 1712: Dispute

Unlike the carriages of the period shows Zu An had watched in his previous world, it was hard to even call what Zhao Han was riding on a carriage. There were four beasts pulling the cart, and the carriage itself was so big it resembled a miniature palace. The entire carriage flickered with light blue runes that represented formations in charge of the carriage’s stability, wind resistance, and other such things designed to grant as much comfort to those inside as much as possible. They wouldn’t even feel any movement.

Almost all of the court’s important officials were present, as if it were an imperial assembly. After Zhao Han spoke, they all looked at Zu An with different expressions. Some were full of shock, while others were delighted to see him suffer. Some were worried, while others were just watching because they wanted to see something interesting…

Zu An’s expression changed several times as well. At first, he had thought that his rescue of Concubine Bai had been exposed or something, and wondered how to explain himself. He hadn’t expected it to be because of this. He had known that his identity as the Regent would be exposed sooner or later, but he hadn’t thought it would be this quick. Thus, he was caught off guard.

However, he didn’t choose to argue against it as that would be meaningless. The human emperor’s judgment wasn’t like the law in his previous world, which would need some kind of proof. He even felt the urge to run. Even though Zhao Han was extremely strong, with Zu An’s current level of cultivation and confidence, it wasn’t as if there was no chance of escaping at all.

Suddenly, Zu An heard a familiar voice at his side. “There’s no need to be so alarmed. Even though the Regent identity will bring you some trouble, it can also serve as your very own protective talisman.”

Zu An was briefly stunned. Then, he exclaimed happily, “Big sis empress, you woke up?”

Ever since Mi Li had gone to sleep that time, she had gone in and out of dormancy. Zu An had already gotten used to life without her.

“Call me master!” Mi Li corrected him in annoyance.

“Big sis master…” Zu An called out happily. For some reason, he always felt much calmer whenever she appeared. I really am a natural-born moocher after all!

“Quit it with your slick tongue! Deal with your current predicament first,” Mi Li warned him.

Zu An nodded. He had already regained his composure, so he bowed to Zhao Han and said, “This matter is a long story. Previously, I had many misgivings, so I didn’t immediately report to your majesty. I hope for your majesty’s forgiveness.”

Zhao Han was stunned. He had thought that with Zu An’s personality, he would definitely at least argue a bit. Then, after such a shameful performance, he could simply be completely crushed and subdued. He hadn’t expected Zu An to admit to it in such a straightforward manner.

The elders in the court had all kinds of exaggerated expressions. Some of those who were close to Zu An had hoped that the accusation wasn’t true, and had wondered if they could speak up for him. And yet, judging from the looks of things, all of that would have been completely useless.

Bi Ziang was present as well, but with all of the court present here, his usual proud and arrogant nature had to take a backseat. In front of so many bigwigs, he was as insignificant as an ant. At the moment, however, his jaw was about to fall off. He had previously held absolute confidence in front of Zu An, and he hadn’t treated it as that big of a deal no matter how the other man acted. He had seen Zu An as nothing more than his little sister’s pet. No matter how formidable the other man was, he was nothing more than the Bi clan’s dog.

But now that he had learned that Zu An was actually the Fiend races’ Regent, everything changed! The Fiend races were known for being vicious savages who were addicted to killing, and their powerful clans made them the human race’s greatest enemy. What kind of concept was ‘Regent of the Fiend races’? Forget about Bi Ziang, even those on his father’s level would be a bit inferior in status!

Just who was the dog here?

King Qi, who was standing at the forefront of the gathered subjects, raised his brows. He had thought that this brat was nothing more than a frolicking little clown who frequently ruined his plans. But now, he couldn't help but reevaluate Zu An again.

Chief Attendant Pei Zheng stepped forward and said, “Your majesty, this youngster has committed the crime of deceiving our ruler. Furthermore, he has colluded with the Fiend races to hide such a high position; he truly has ravenous designs. I hope that your majesty will execute this youngster for his crimes and investigate the Fiend races’ defeated remnants!” His voice was incredibly impassioned, as if full of anger, and yet also full of extreme excitement.

His reaction wasn’t that surprising. A year or two prior, King Qi had been incredibly powerful, making others confident that he would become the next emperor. And yet, ever since this brat Zu An came to the capital, everything had changed. Several low to mid-level officials of King Qi’s faction had been stripped of their positions; after some time, even the core forces of King Qi’s faction, such as Secretariat Assistant Director Yu Nan and Imperial Secretariat’s Left Confidential Assistant Yu Xuanchong, had been overthrown one after another. Decades of plans in Cloudcenter Commandery had been completely ruined. Right now, the King Qi faction’s forces had already deteriorated to the extreme.

That all had something to do with Zu An. Pei Zheng had only been able to watch his meteoric rise without being able to do a thing. Now, he had finally found a chance to retaliate, so how could he not become excited?

Zu An thought to himself, Big Manman’s grandfather really is a letdown. If this man knew about his relationship with his granddaughter, would he still attack so ruthlessly?L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Guard General Liu Yao also stepped forward and said, “Indeed. Our dynasty punishes those who have secretly colluded with the Fiend races with three generations of executions. This Zu has committed a deliberate violation. He has received benevolence from your majesty, and yet he actually served as the Fiend races’ Regent! This is another tremendous crime!”

Many people’s expressions became a bit strange. King Qi and the emperor’s faction were usually awfully busy arguing over every little thing. And yet today, they actually both stood on the same front against Zu An.

The emperor nodded slightly and said, “What you say carries some reason.”

Just then, Bi Qi, who rarely expressed his opinion, surprisingly said, “Your majesty, this humble subject feels that this is inappropriate. We were previously suspicious as to why the conditions for the Fiend races’ armistice were so favorable for us, and we were worried that they could be plotting something. Now, it is clear that it must have been because of Sir Zu’s influence. As such, if we look at it from this perspective, Sir Zu was actually acting in the human race’s interests. Not only has he not done anything wrong, he actually carries merit.”

Bi Ziang was stunned. He hadn’t expected his father to actually speak up for Zu An at such a critical moment!

That Zu bastard might be a trusted aide little sis raised up, but he’s already the Fiend races’ Regent! There’s no way he’d be willing to let the Bi clan order him around! Even little sis herself might not be able to control him now.

Father has never been one to act on impulse, so there’s no way he doesn’t understand that. Why would he take such a huge risk here?

Pei Zheng sneered and retorted, “Then according to what Sir Bi is saying, this Mister Zu should not be punished for colluding with the Fiend races, but should instead be rewarded? Then what purpose would the law of our empire serve? In the future, everyone would be able to act like him and collude with the Fiend races. Would we even be a country anymore?”

Bi Qi was a leading figure of the crown prince’s faction, so the two sides often clashed with each other. Pei Zheng found Bi Qi’s personality completely unbearable, so that was why he immediately fired back. Soon after, those who were on good terms with Bi Qi and Pei Zheng argued with each other. The place became extremely noisy at once.

Zhao Han frowned when he saw the familiar scene. These two sides were always arguing. Just looking at it made him angry.

This time, however, the different sides unexpectedly broke up into two new factions. Some of them approved of Bi Qi’s opinion, while others demanded Zu An’s execution with Pei Zheng. It was quite a novel sight.

As such, Zhao Han looked at Jiang Boyang and said, “Boyang, you are the Commandant of Justice, someone who is in charge of the court’s laws. What do you think about this matter?”

Jiang Boyang bowed and said, “This subject believes that colluding with the Fiend races is the most severe offense. Because of that, Sir Zu deserves execution for his crimes.

“However, he has helped the human race receive great benefits in the negotiations this time. If we deny him of this contribution, we may receive criticism. Furthermore, he is the Fiend races’ Regent, so if something happens to him, would the Fiend races really just leave the matter at that? Perhaps the peace talks we have just begun will once again return to the flames of war. That is not something that would bring the common people happiness.

“This is not something that can strictly be decided through law, so this subject does not dare to make a decision. I can only hope that your majesty’s wise and brilliant self can come to a righteous judgment.”

All of the other subjects cursed him for being an old fox, not offending either side and being so cunning.

Zu An thought to himself, It’s still Principal Jiang’s pops who cares more about me. Pei Zheng, why don’t you learn a bit from him?

Zhao Han declined to comment and looked at Zhao Jing, asking, “King Qi, what do you think?”
