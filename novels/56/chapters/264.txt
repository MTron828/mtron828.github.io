Chapter 264: Probing

Translator: Pika

Zu An’s face was as black as charcoal. The chances of getting a skill were just too rare! Yet now that he’d finally gotten one, he’d ended up with this garbage.

Seems like it going to be one of those days...

Sure enough, other than Ki Fruits, there were only ‘Thanks for playing’ messages.

He didn’t even get a single bottle of medicine. He really wanted another bottle of Faith in Brother Spring!

He had no idea when Chen Xuan would pop up again. Knowing that guy, there was no way he was going to up just like that.

If he had a bottle of Faith in Brother Spring, he could still bounce right back if he was unlucky. Since he didn’t have this to count on, he had to constantly remain on guard.

This round of drawing netted him a total of 320 Ki Fruits.

Considering the odds, his luck wasn’t actually that bad.

His mood improved slightly. Making sure no one was paying attention, he tossed these fruits into his mouth one after another.

His face immediately went rigid when he examined himself.

What the heck? Why did only a tenth of the formation fill up?

This was the most Ki Fruits he ate in one sitting!

He examined himself carefully, and then he noticed where the issue lay.

He was now already at the eighth step of the third rank. Since the number of Ki Fruits needed for each formation increased in accordance with the Fibonacci Sequence, he would need 2,584 Ki Fruits to reach the ninth step.

He’d only eaten 320, so naturally, it would only fill up by slightly more than a tenth.

In reality, the seventh and eighth formations, which required 987 and 1597 Ki Fruits respectively in order to fill completely, wasn’t something he could have easily achieved through Rage points alone.

It had been all thanks to that blood-soaked battle against Mi Li... but of course, that had just been a one-sided butchering.

Under the effects of the Heiress’ Ball of Delights, his body had suffered countless fatal blows, suffering slash after slash, with blood flying everywhere. Only in such a situation did the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra show its true prowess, allowing him to gain two steps.

Trying to fill in these formations without such external help seemed like an extremely slow process.

It was already so hard for him to advance, even when he was only at the third rank. Once he climbed higher, wouldn’t the number of Ki Fruits he needed really reach astronomical quantities? It seemed almost impossible to reach the lofty heights of cultivation.

He couldn’t find a way to solve this issue no matter how he racked his brains, so he gave up on thinking.

I’ll just cross that bridge when I get there.

Without him noticing, the class came to an end. His desk-mate Wei Suo, unable to hold himself back any longer, immediately scooched over. “Boss, so how did the courtesan queen... taste?”

He’d been dying to ask this as soon as Zu An had come back, but after seeing his knitted brows and gritted teeth, he hadn’t dared ask him anything.

Since Zu An seemed back to normal, he eagerly seized the chance to ask.

He was fully aware that Qiu Honglei was far outside his league. However, he could still share this divine experience indirectly through his boss!

All of the nearby students rushed over when they heard Wei Suo’s question. News of the courtesan queen’s choice had clearly spread like wildfire. All of them looked at him with eager eyes.

Zu An was embarrassed to admit that nothing had happened, especially in front of all these hopeful eyes. He immediately began to brag. “It was obviously the best! Really a divine experience...”

He blurted out whatever came to mind, throwing them some random plot from an extremely explicit web novel he’d read before.

Even though Brightmoon Academy had many students from influential families, there were also many from ordinary backgrounds, which was especially true for the Yellow class.

All of them were still quite young, so they didn’t have much experience in this area. Their blood began to boil as they listened, their faces and ears flushing red. Their eyes were filled with a jealous hatred.

You have successfully trolled the Yellow class for 66... 66... 66...

Zu An was miffed. These fellas really have no conscience. They’re getting a free audiobook here, yet they still have the nerve to get angry.

Hmph, whatever. Since you’re already providing me these Rage points, this young master won’t stoop to bicker with the lowly. You’re all forgiven.

A student ran over to pass on a message. “Ah Zu, someone is looking for you by the door.”

Everyone was already used to his nickname.

Some students had already been completely sucked into his tale. They grew angry at this sudden interruption, wondering who it was that was disturbing them.

When they turned around, they saw a traditional beauty in a long skirt standing by the doorway, waving at Zu An with a smile.

“Isn’t that the ninth-ranked beauty Zheng Dan?”

“She truly is a fairy-level girl! The fuglies in our class don’t stand a chance.”

“Her manners are so wonderful. This sort of gentle and sweet-tempered woman is definitely the perfect candidate for a wife!”

“Keep dreaming ,man. She’s already engaged to the Sang clan’s young master. Besides, even if she wasn’t, you wouldn’t stand a chance.”

“Then why is she here looking for Ah Zu? This isn’t even the first time.”

“Dammit, now that you mention it, is there some kind of scandal going on here as well?”

...

Zheng Dan’s cheeks flushed from all the whispered gossip, and she lowered her head in embarrassment. Her appearance was perfectly bashful and reserved.

Zu An walked over to the doorway. This shy-looking young lady dressed in a long skirt really was the textbook example of a Green Tea Bitch from his previous world.[1]

But she’s just too damn pretty! No wonder it wasn’t really the men who hated this type of green tea...

“What did Miss Zheng need me for?”

Zhen Dan pursed her lips, hesitating as her eyes darted around. “Can we find another place to talk? This place is too embarrassing...”

“Sure, let’s go for a stroll.” Zu An thought about bringing her to his staff residence, but he soon abandoned the thought. There wasn’t much time between classes.

The two of them walked off, shoulder to shoulder like a pair of lovebirds.

Wei Suo immediately prostrated himself in admiration. “Boss is truly worthy of the title Great Boss! You just played with a courtesan queen last night, yet Miss Zheng is already throwing herself at you today!”

“Hmph, it’s probably nothing dirty, and not at all like what’s in your head. Miss Zheng is engaged, okay? She probably needs to consult him on some proper business,” another student retorted immediately. Learning about the Qiu Honglei affair from the night before had been enough to fill his heart to the brim with jealousy and resentment. Yet now, Zu An was immediately getting together with another beauty right in front of his eyes! The student felt that his small heart was on the brink of shattering.

“Are the matters between men and women not considered proper?” Wei Suo glared at him. “So what if she’s engaged? Wouldn’t conquering someone else’s fiancée bring an even greater feeling of victory?”

Someone else to the side couldn’t help but laugh. “Aren’t these some bold words coming out from your mouth? Are you really imagining yourself in Ah Zu’s place, since such a thing is impossible for you? Don’t you feel any sense of shame?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Wei Suo’s face became red. “Nonsense! I am just feeling happy for my boss.”

...

When he saw this new stream of Rage points flow in, Zu An grew curious as to what those guys were doing back there. He’d already left, after all. Why were they still angry at him?

“Ah Zu, I heard that you were attacked by Chen Xuan on the way here. Are you okay?”

The two of them had moved to a more secluded area. Her bashful and reserved appearance had disappeared completely, and was replaced with an extremely concerned expression. She nervously tugged his hand, searching his body for injuries almost frantically.

“I’m gonna have to charge you if you keep touching me.” If he hadn’t already guessed at her intentions, Zu An might really have been bewitched. Her acting skills were far too good. She really did look like a deeply concerned young lady.

“Really, what am I going to do with you...” Zheng Dan’s face flushed slightly. “Since you can still talk like that, you’re probably fine. I’m so relieved.”

“Many thanks for Miss Zheng’s concern.” Zu An reached out smoothly and grabbed her hands. Just what kind of routine does she have to make her hands this soft? Do you soak them in milk every day, or something?

Zheng Dan pulled back her hands somewhat awkwardly. The image of this man stroking her bare leg flashed into her mind again.

She really didn’t know what had come over her the last time. Things had really gone too far. Zheng Dan warned herself sternly not to repeat that particular disaster again.

She hadn’t forgotten the reason why she’d come looking for him today. “Ah Zu, I heard that Chen Xuan is at the sixth rank! If he’s determined to kill you, you’re surely in great danger!”

“What can I do? Anyway, if push comes to shove, I’ll just hide out in the academy every day. I don’t think he has the guts to enter the academy,” Zu An replied.

“You’re actually still quite safe in the Chu Estate. Brightmoon Duke is a mighty eighth rank cultivator, after all, and there are so many other experts in the estate. You even have a master that you can rely on for help.” Zheng Dan smiled sweetly, acting as if she was just chatting casually.

1. The term ‘Green Tea Bitch’ (绿茶婊 - lü cha biao) was popularized some time in 2013. A Green Tea Bitch is a woman who looks pure, sweet and innocent on the outside, but is secretly ambitious inside, willing to sell even her soul for money and success.
