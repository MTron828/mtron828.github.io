Chapter 891, Part 2: New Function Unlocked

Included among the items were things like Taotie Horns and Dragon Scales.

Zu An was alarmed. So he could have just purchased these things from the Shop! He had been worried that as Daji’s skill rank increased, he would need more and more Ki Condensation Pills, Dragon Scales, Taotie Horns, and silver. Silver wasn’t too big of a problem, but the other things weren’t so readily available! What if he couldn't find the materials needed for the ranking up of other valkyries?

But with the Shop, that problem would easily be solved. He glanced over at the Taotie Horn’s selling price. The goods sold here were all purchased through Rage points. He had saved up a good amount since the last time he pulled the lottery system.

But when he saw the string of 0s behind the price, he cursed, “This is a fucking scam!” Do you think it was easy for me to earn these Rage points? Look at the number of 0s behind every single item! Fuck, not even the currency in Zimbabwe was devalued to this extent, right?!

He became gloomy and skipped straight over that section. The next items in line were some more familiar goods, such as Ki Fruits, Marrow Cleansing Pills, and all kinds of ores.

Zu An was shocked. In Shang Liuyu’s class in Brightmoon Academy, he had learned that many ores were actually quite precious. They were essential for the creation of high level weapons. He hadn’t expected the Shop to have them for exchange. However, the amount of Rage points needed to purchase these ores was also considerable.

He continued to look around. There was only a single item in the fourth category: Tiger Talismans. These were the Tiger Talismans used to pull the Valkyrie System!

“I can buy Tiger Talismans?!” Zu An’s eyes lit up. He wouldn’t have to do a thing in the future if he pulled a few more valkyries! He’d just throw his harem at the enemy. Even if they couldn’t win, they’d defeat the enemy with their beauty.

He almost drooled when he thought of that. He had only saved up 431,472 Rage points so far, however, which was only enough to buy six Tiger Talismans.

But the chance of actually pulling a valkyrie was incredibly low. And with just six talismans, he might not get a single thing. Zu An quickly realized that exchanging for anything directly from the Shop was a pretty bad deal for him… It was better to try and obtain the things present, such as the Taotie Horns, Dragon Scales, and Ki Condensation Pills, through other means.

Zu An’s pounding heart calmed down when he understood that, and he continued scrolling. His eyes widened when he saw the last category. He hadn’t expected it to be titled ‘Apparel’! There were some smaller characters that explained that the clothing in that category could be used by valkyries.

Zu An had tried all sorts of things after he obtained Daji. Even though she had carried out all sorts of orders for him, anything intimate was immediately rejected. Not even simple things like holding hands were allowed.

As for clothing, even touching was out of the question. Back then, Zu An had purchased all kinds of pretty dresses hoping that she would change into them, but she had completely ignored him. She had only looked at him as if he were a complete idiot.

“What the hell? Who the heck would spend that much for a stupid outfit?” Zu An sneered. So what if those valkyries would change clothes if he bought these for them? It was just for looks anyway. Furthermore, their original clothing looked pretty good too, and they seemed to have anti-dust runes on them or something. Those clothes never got dirty and could be worn for the rest of their lives.

The clothes offered in the Shop didn’t even grant any skills or assistance in battle. Only a moron would buy these clothes! Zu An firmly made the decision not to.

Even so, he was still worried that he might have missed out on something, so he decided to take a look at the clothes first. However, his eyes widened as soon as he checked out the pieces available. His breathing became rushed as well.

“Wait… There seems to be much less material used in these outfits…

“Won’t their thighs be showing if they wear this?

“You should be able to see more of her cleavage with this one, right…”

…

When he saw the last outfit, he was stupefied. It was a black-laced bikini!

“I swear, the creator of this system is a damn pervert!”

Zu An couldn't take his eyes off of that outfit. He thought to himself, I have to get at least one set of these clothes, right? It’s not that I want to see her in a bikini or anything, I’m just trying to save the keyboard system cloth.

He completely forgot about his firm and decisive choice from a moment before. He clicked the purchase button without any hesitation.

However, a row of characters immediately showed up on the screen: ‘Insufficient Rage points!’

“Damn it!” Zu An gritted his teeth. This thing was actually that expensive?!

Ten, one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand, one hundred thousand, one million… He didn’t even feel like counting the 0s anymore after a certain point.

“Forget it, everything needs Rage points. I’ll hold off on this for now.” Zu An continued to console himself. However, he still glanced reluctantly at that outfit in the shop window from time to time, imagining just how amazing Daji would look in it.

Zu An returned to reality and began to think about the purpose of the shop’s existence. According to what he had just seen, he noticed that the Shop didn’t have many things that could make him stronger. Its goods seemed to mainly be for the valkyries. “Looks like the valkyries have a lot of potential there… Ahem, potential for growth.”

After understanding that point, he realized that the Shop wasn’t too useful for him at the moment, so he decided not to pay too much attention to it. There was another problem he had to tackle.

Zu An undid the seal on Bi Linglong’s fainting acupoint. The beauty in his arms groaned and slowly opened her eyes. Her red phoenix eyes were usually awe-inspiring and majestic, but now, those eyes looked delicate and charming.

“I… What happened to me?” Bi Linglong saw Zu An looking at her up close as soon as she opened her eyes. Her heart pounded crazily.

“You might have been too tired.” Zu An used a random excuse. Bi Linglong quickly recalled what the two of them had done. Her face flushed bright red.

Zu An realized the implications behind what he had just said. However, he didn’t plan to explain anything and instead said, “Linglong, you’re amazing.”

Bi Linglong couldn’t keep looking at him, and turned her head away. Zu An was used to seeing her proud and mighty appearance. This was a rare bashful side of her. He felt his heart stir, and couldn't help but lower his head for a kiss.

Bi Linglong instinctively wanted to evade him, but she immediately remembered that the two of them already had a physical relationship, so there was no need for her to evade this. As such, she slowly closed her eyes. Her long eyelashes fluttered gently, exposing just how hard her heart was pounding.

Zu An kissed her. He hadn’t expected her lips to be that soft. There was even a bit of sweetness. Bi Linglong moaned while leaning her entire body against him, as soft as cotton. Once her defenses were broken, it was hard for her to resist the man she had given everything to.

Zu An had acted without thinking just then. Now that he had recovered a bit of his rationality, he immediately wanted to experience ‘that’ seriously again.

Bi Linglong’s status was special, and she was rather prideful by nature. When had anyone ever done such a thing to her? She was completely defeated by Zu An’s proficient skills. She leaned gently into his embrace and looked as if she were ready to let him do anything he wanted.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Just then, Zhao Ruizhi’s naive and simple voice came from outside. “Linglong? Linglong, where are you? I’m scared…” His voice sounded wronged and helpless.

Bi Linglong’s body went rigid. She instinctively sat up and pushed away the man beside her.

Zu An was a bit unhappy. This damn fatty could have woken up earlier or later; why did he have to wake up just now? He rushed outside the room, and Zhao Ruizhi’s voice stopped.

When he returned, Bi Linglong couldn't help but ask, “What did you do to him?”

Zu An replied, “Don’t worry, I just knocked him out for a bit. Why don’t we continue where we left off?”

Bi Linglong’s face turned red. However, she still firmly shook her head. Zu An saw that she had already fixed her messy clothes and knew that there was no chance today. As such, he had some more ‘nice things’ to say to that damn fatty inwardly.

“Let’s talk about what we should do now.” Bi Linglong looked extremely worried.

“How about we just get rid of that stupid fatty, and then the two of us will elope?” Zu An asked with a smile.

“I can’t.” Bi Linglong quickly shook her head. “Even though I don’t have feelings for him, we’re still husband and wife in name. Just now… I’ve already let him down, so how can I kill him?”

Zu An smiled. How could someone like her, who had been raised with the etiquette of a noble, be able to do what Pan Jinlian and Ximen Qing from their story… Pah pah pah! I’m no Ximen Qing[1]!

“But things will become tricky if we don’t kill him,” Zu An reminded her. He didn’t want to kill Zhao Ruizhi and then go on the run either, though. After all, there were still so many lovely friends waiting for him! But he couldn't really say that for fear of Bi Linglong feeling that he didn’t care about her, so he could only put on an act.

Fortunately, Bi Linglong’s reply wasn’t anything unexpected. “If his majesty’s split soul hadn’t perished, I would’ve run as far away as I could. But his split soul has been devoured by that weird octopus, so that gives us some room to work with.” She hesitated a bit at first, but she calmed down the more she spoke. She clearly already had some plans.

She had always been the one managing the Eastern Palace for many years. She felt she was already more than halfway to her goal, and obviously didn’t want to abandon everything she had at the capital.

“What happened here is easy to explain, but it might not be so easy to deceive the emperor,” Zu An said gravely. To be honest, that old and tricky bastard of an emperor was incredibly tough to deal with.”

Bi Linglong moved over to his ear and whispered, “I have a plan. Let’s do this…”
