Chapter 1050: Came at the Perfect Time

“Sect Master Yan left,” Zu An replied.

“She left?” Yun Jianyue was a bit dissatisfied. “Could it be that she knew I was coming? Is that why she ran so quickly?”𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Qiu Honglei said, “Ah Zu took out the imperial decree just now and scared her away.”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Hmph, just a trifling imperial decree was enough to scare that hag away? Just the incantation time alone would be enough for her to kill you dozens of times over.”

Zu An chuckled in embarrassment. What she said was indeed the case. If a grandmaster really did insist on attacking him, he wouldn’t have the time to finish the chant at all.

Qiu Honglei explained, “That was because Ah Zu was incredibly smart, making Sect Master Yan promise that she couldn’t interfere ahead of time…” She gave her master a rough recount of what had happened.

Yun Jianyue didn’t approve of what she heard, saying, “Great warriors need to be crafty as well. Only a wooden plank for a brain like her would agree to something so unreasonable.”

Qiu Honglei had a strange expression as she said, “Fortunately, Ah Zu was able to scare off Sect Master Yan. Otherwise, master is still injured, so you might not be able to win against her.”

Yun Jianyue was speechless. She exclaimed, “Stupid girl, do you have no loyalty toward your master at all?!”

Qiu Honglei shrunk backward and muttered, “I wasn’t being serious…”

Yun Jianyue grabbed her collar, then flew into the distance as if she were carrying a small chick. She said, “Follow me back and cultivate well so you don’t get beaten up by that woman’s disciple next year.”

Zu An was stunned. He quickly shouted, “Big Sis Yun, are you really going to just take her away like that? What about me?”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Who’s your big sis? I’m going to let you go today because of Honglei. I’m going to break your third leg if I see you hanging around her again in the future.” Her voice lingered in the air, but she had already vanished without a trace.

Zu An was speechless. This woman really was fickle! That wasn’t how she had treated him when they were back in the Imperial Palace at all.

…

Off to the side, Tang Tian’er was speechless. His relationship with the Devil Sect Master is that good? He can even chat with her like that?

Who was Yun Jianyue? She was a cold-blooded monster, infamous throughout the mountains and rivers! If she saw anyone she didn’t find pleasant, she might just erase them from this world.

Yet she actually said she’d break Zu An’s third leg…

Why does this sound like a joke between friends?

Just then, Zu An’s figure rocked unsteadily. Even though his body was tough, his injuries weren’t light. He was feeling quite weak at the moment too. Once Yun Jianyue left, he finally found it a bit hard to keep up his tough facade.

“Young master, what’s wrong?” Tang Tian’er asked as she ran over to support him.

“I’m fine. I just need a moment to catch my breath.” Zu An nodded toward her. At the same time, he looked behind her. He didn’t see Zhuang Hetong there anymore.

Tang Tian’er also realized something. She pleaded weakly, “Young master, can you let my uncle go as a favor to me?”

Zu An had to admit that this woman really was naturally gifted in communication. She had clearly already hidden Zhuang Hetong beforehand, so he wouldn’t be able to find him even if he wanted to. Furthermore, he was in the Zhenyuan Merchant Group compound. If there really were any more fighting, it was hard to say who would come out on top.

And yet, even in that situation, Tang Tian’er still looked at him with that pleading look, giving him face. She really could hold the hearts of men within her palm.

Zu An chuckled and replied, “Miss Tang is too polite. You even saved me once earlier, so how can I not do you this favor?”

Suddenly, a burst of densely packed footsteps rang out. Xu Yu and Gao Ying had rushed over with the commandery’s troops when they heard the activity.

Tang Tian’er quickly said, “Young master, it’s not convenient for me to show myself with my identity. I’ll be leaving first.” She then quickly sprinted away.

But after a few steps, she stopped and said with a voice as soft as a mosquito’s buzz, “Just now in that room… If it had been anyone else, there’s no way I would have saved them.” With reddened ears, she quickly ran away after saying that.

Zu An couldn't help but laugh. This woman really was good at pushing her advantages. It was hard for others to tell if her words were real or fake, and yet no one would ever get upset at her over it.

Xu Yu and the others quickly arrived with their troops. Xu Yu asked, “What happened here? A large flame shot into the heavens just now, and there seemed to be powerful cultivators fighting as well.”

Their expressions couldn't help but change when they saw the scene that seemed as if it had just experienced a crazy storm. Eventually, their eyes fell onto Zu An.

Zu An removed his mask and said, “Sir Xu, Brother Gao, it’s me.”

“Sir Zu?”

“Brother Zu!”

Xu Yu and Gao Ying immediately walked over to support him to his feet.

“Brother Zu, how did you end up like this?” Gao Ying asked. Zu An opened his mouth to speak, but in the end, his head tilted to the side, and he fainted in Gao Ying’s arms.

Naturally, he hadn’t really fainted. He just didn’t want those from Cloudcenter Commandery to know the true state of his wounds.

After all, he had just fought against a master rank cultivator and several ninth ranked experts. Not only had he seized total victory, he had even scared off a grandmaster! If he weren’t injured in the slightest after all of that, that would be way too shocking. Furthermore, he had another plan that was just starting to take form. He needed those ‘injuries’ to help him cover it up.

“Brother Zu!” Gao Ying obviously didn’t know about all of that. He was alarmed when he saw Zu An’s condition and quickly fed him some medicine. At the same time, he had some men call over a physician.

Xu Yu sealed off the area, then he detained some Zhenyuan Merchant Group members for interrogation.

However, the battle just then was so intense that those from the merchant group had stayed far away to avoid the blast waves. The experts who were aware of what was actually going on had already left in advance under Tang Tian’er’s guidance. That was why even after their questioning, the troops were only able to gain a rough idea of what had happened.

When he heard that Zu An had fought against a few master rank experts, Xu Yu couldn't help but become alarmed. Even though Zu An’s injuries were extremely severe, such battle accomplishments were world-shocking!

…

Two hours later, Zu An was brought back to the Imperial Envoy’s temporary residence. Compared to the doctors of the Civil Affairs Manor, Gao Ying trusted the ones at the temporary residence more.

When he learned of Zu An’s critical condition, Sang Hong rushed over in alarm. He was nowhere near as calm as he normally seemed.

Zu An felt warm inside when he saw that. Looks like ever since that night, he really did start treating me as one of his own.

When everyone else left, Zu An pretended to have become a bit more clear-headed. Sang Hong, Pei You, and the others quickly rushed over to check up on him, asking, “How do you feel?”

“I won’t die. However, I might have to rest for a while,” Zu An said ‘weakly’.

Sang Hong could no longer suppress his curiosity and urgently asked, “Just what happened? Why did it all end up like this?”

Zu An thus gave them a rough summary of what had just happened in the Zhenyuan Merchant Group area.

“Absolutely preposterous! Zuo Su was colluding with Jian Taiding after all. Not even death can wipe away their crimes!” Sang Hong was enraged. After all, Zuo Su was supposed to be someone from their own side, a capable helper who would assist in bringing down Jian Taiding. But now, they had discovered that all of Cloudcenter Commandery’s officials had long since colluded together!

“Jian Taiding is seriously injured right now. Is there a way to arrest him right now?” Zu An asked. He added regretfully, “It’s a pity that he got away just now.”

Pei You said from off to the side, “Brother Zu, you’re just too crazy! You defeated a freaking master rank cultivator, and yet you’re not bragging about it, but are instead sad that you weren’t able to capture him?”

“It was just through a fluke,” Zu An said humbly. He didn’t want to reveal too much of his strength.

“Even if it was just a fluke, that would be shocking in itself.” Sang Hong gave him a complicated look. I was still a bit hesitant over tacitly approving of his relationship with my daughter and daughter-in-law. Now, it seems it was definitely worth it.

My grandson is going to have a man like this as his father! How blessed of a thing is that?

Sang Hong quickly gathered his thoughts and continued, “Ah Zu, there is no need for you to blame yourself too much. Even if you captured Jian Taiding just now, we would have no way of convicting him. On the contrary, his trusted aides back in the Military Affairs Manor might take a risk out of desperation instead and make things even more unfavorable.”

“What do you mean?” Zu An frowned.

Sang Hong explained, “We do not have any proof right now. The matter of colluding with the fiend races only mentioned Zuo Su. Jian Taiding’s name was not there.

“Furthermore, the fact that they were the ones who killed Zuo Su is something only you alone heard in person. There is nothing we could do if they refused to admit it.

“That is, unless you can capture that fiend race master and all of the others together in one go. But with that fiend race master rank individual there, it would be too dangerous for you.”

Zu An agreed with all of that. The reason why he had been able to seriously wound Jian Taiding was also because the other party hadn’t expected his body to be so sturdy, nor had he expected that Zu An would choose to trade blow for blow.

If that fiend race cultivator had been there as well, Zu An might have been the one who died. After all, the fiend race cultivator wasn’t someone who cared much about virtue like Yan Xuehen. He would just completely overwhelm Zu An.

When he thought of that, Zu An couldn't help but say, “The White Jade Sect seems to be involved here too. With a grandmaster here, I fear this matter is beyond our power.”

Sang Hong shook his head. “In my opinion, White Jade Sect is a top-level sect in the martial world; they have always considered themselves upright. It is unlikely for them to have participated in this collusion with the fiend races. The reason why she interfered was most likely because Jian Taiding was one of their sect members.”

Pei You couldn't help but say, “In that case, can we ask Sect Master Yan to clean up the actions of her own sect members?”

Sang Hong looked at him as if he were stupid. He replied, “How could it be that easy? The court has acted powerfully over the years, taking in most cultivators to use as national power. This has incurred the dissatisfaction of many sects. The smaller sects’ eradication is one thing, but a large sect like White Jade Sect decided to seal off their mountain. They have already been dissatisfied with the court for a long time; why would they help us with anything, let alone to deal with one of their own members?

“Furthermore, if I am not mistaken, Jian Taiding must have offered up much wealth and many gifts to the sect. They will definitely keep him alive if it is within their power.”

“Then what do we do now?” Zu An was getting a bit of a headache.

Sang Hong replied seriously, “Have the Civil Affairs Manor order the arrest of the fiend race master Kong Qing immediately. Whether it is the Civil or Martial Affairs Manor, neither of them should have any reason to oppose that. Pei You, you are to lead your men to find the Yu clan’s Yu Xuantao. Hmph, we cannot do anything to Jian Taiding, but do you think we cannot do anything to Yu Xuantao?!”

“Understood!” Pei You left excitedly. He thought to himself, This time, I should be able to finally meet the legendary Yu Yanluo, right?

Zu An wasn’t so optimistic. He said, “Kong Qing is a powerful master rank cultivator. What will ordering his arrest do for us?”

“It is merely a stance to test the waters.” Sang Hong continued, “Furthermore, I will contact the court with the recording mirror tomorrow morning and ask for reinforcements.”

They had naturally brought recording mirrors on a mission as important as this. It was just that each use would consume a lot of materials, so they wouldn’t use them unless they had to. It was already such an essential time.

“You should take care of yourself first. You do not have to worry about anything else.” Sang Hong left in a serious mood after speaking.

Zu An lay in his room, secretly transferring his primordial ki to mend his wounds. Even though his injuries weren’t as serious as they looked, they definitely weren’t light.

However, he suddenly noticed something and opened his eyes. He saw a white-clothed woman standing quietly by the window, looking at him. Who else could it be but Yan Xuehen?!
