Chapter 284: I'd Rather Be the Concubine of a Hero than the Wife of Someone Mediocre

Translator: Pika

Qin Wanru sneered inside. This woman finally revealed her true intentions! That thing about being a servant or a slave had all been a pretense. With Qiu Honglei’s status, it was completely out of the question.

This was her true objective.

She had come all the way into the Chu Estate to steal another person’s man. Absolutely preposterous!

Qin Wanru squashed down her anger. She didn’t act out on the spot, instead giving Zu An a big smile. “Our Chu clan has always been a reasonable clan. We have never relied on our authority to push around the common people. That is why this decision will rest with Ah Zu himself. He should decide if he is willing to have you or not.”

She didn’t want the Chu clan’s reputation to be tarnished either. This was a mess he had made, and so he should be the one to clean it up.

“Sure, I’m willing. Why wouldn’t I be?” Zu An blurted out. Why would he refuse such a beautiful courtesan queen taking the initiative to free herself to become his concubine? Just call me the King of Moochers in the future!

Wait, why does this sound like I’m criticizing myself?

Even though he didn’t mind mooching off of women, his argument with Qin Wanru last time made him realize that the status of a drafted son-in-law really was too low. He was completely attached to the clan, and there were no laws to protect him.

I should get rid of this status as soon as possible.

Besides, I’m so handsome, I’d still be able to mooch off girls even if I become something other than a drafted son-in-law... Ah! Pui, pui, pui! Who is mooching off women?

I’m so handsome, so suave, girls with money and beauty are naturally drawn to me! Isn’t that right?

Qin Wanru stared at him, speechless. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

She had expected Zu An to find some excuse to reject her. In her opinion, no man would ever give up the revered and similarly beautiful Chu Chuyan for some brothel girl, even if she was a courtesan queen who had bewitched countless men.

With that, she could then move in to ease the situation.

But this guy just refused to behave like a normal person!

As a duchess, how could she be so shameless as to go back on her word?

While she struggled with this dilemma, Chu Chuyan suddenly spoke out.

“I don’t agree!”

Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru were both surprised. Their daughter actually straight-up opposed this!

Chu Zhongtian’s reaction was one thing, but Qin Wanru actually knew some things about what was going on between her daughter and Zu An. Don’t tell me... my daughter really likes Zu An?

Her daughter—who many considered a goddess—and the extremely famous Qiu Honglei were both chasing after the same man! Those who didn’t know the full details might well think that this man was some incredible person.

What virtue or ability did this Zu An possess?

Qiu Honglei gave her a surprised look. “Why is First Miss Chu opposing this? According to what I’ve heard, the two of you are actually not that close. Ah Zu’s status in your clan is also extremely low, so continuing on like this will only torment both parties.”

Zu An sighed inside. This woman is taking the words straight out of my mouth!

If I didn’t know of this woman’s hidden agenda, I might really be moved to tears!

“Did Zu An tell you these things?” Chu Chuyan’s expression grew dangerous.

Zu An could sense that his wife really was angry this time. She didn’t even call him ‘Ah Zu’.

Qiu Honglei shook her head. “How could a wonderful man like Ah Zu talk behind others' backs? These are things that he doesn’t even need to say; things everyone in Brightmoon City are aware of.”

Wonderful man?

Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru both had strange looks on their faces. Did she not know what those two words meant?

Chu Chuyan’s felt her mind shudder. She had an inkling that this was the case, but she had subconsciously chosen to avoid thinking about it.

Only now, when she heard this from the mouth of another, did she realize just how wronged Ah Zu had been all this time, and just how much others looked down on him.

Chu Chuyan’s guilt kept growing as she thought of these things. “Who said we don’t share a good relationship?” She grabbed Zu An and latched onto his arm. “We’ve gone through life-or-death trials and tribulations in the Ursae Dungeon. Our affection for each other is far closer than you could imagine. Isn’t that right, Ah Zu?”

Even though she had a smile on her face, she pinched his waist hard with her free hand, reminding him to watch his mouth.

Chu Zhongtian was completely stunned by how close his daughter was with Zu An. He subconsciously looked towards his wife, his eyes full of confusion. Is there something I don’t know about?

He did not expect Qin Wanru to be just as surprised. This didn’t match her daughter’s nature at all!

Sensing the hostility around him, Zu An said with a smile, “Indeed, we husband and wife feel incredible affection for each other. I really don’t want to leave my wife! Honglei, I fear that you have no choice but to become a concubine.”

With his personality, how could he give up such a great chance? He reached out a hand to hold Chu Chuyan’s waist as he said this. Oh man, this is what I’ve been missing!

Chu Chuyan’s entire body went rigid when she noticed his actions. She was so tense, it was as if she would blow up at any moment.

However, she didn’t say anything in the end. She pursed her lips and slowly relaxed her entire body.

Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru almost spurted blood when they heard Zu An ask Qiu Honglei straight up to become a concubine. This guy’s shamelessness really was in a class of its own!

But they quickly noticed what was happening between Zu An and their daughter as well. They stared at the hand which had snaked around their daughter’s waist. When they saw that she didn’t show any signs of resistance, they couldn’t help but exchange glances. Did their daughter and this man already become true husband and wife?

Chu Zhongtian was usually kind and polite to Zu An, but that was only because of his self-restraint. When he thought about how his precious daughter could have been toyed with by a swine, he was overcome with a gloominess and dejection that all fathers could sympathize with.

Comparatively, Qin Wanru was slightly better off. After all, she had already heard from her daughter about how she received her life-saving treatments while naked, and she was more mentally prepared.

Qiu Honglei looked at the couple that were glued together, and a faintly discernible smile appeared at the corners of her lips. “Honglei is definitely not the type of shameless and brazen girl who wishes to break up families...”

Qin Wanru scoffed inwardly when she heard these words. Isn’t that exactly who you are?

Chu Chuyan’s expression also grew cold. Her mood was clearly not that great either.

Qiu Honglei said, “Since Ah Zu isn’t willing to leave miss Chu and I don’t want to be away from him either, then I guess I’ll become miss Chu’s younger sister. I wonder if First Miss Chu is willing?”

“I already have a younger sister!” Chu Chuyan wanted badly to refuse her, but she was well aware of the current predicament the Chu clan was in, and her logical mind prevailed. She coldly added, “If I say that I am not willing, will Lady Qiu choose to not tell us about young master Wang’s whereabouts?”

“Big sis Chu’s words really make me feel slightly ashamed. However, people like us who are tormented by fate only wish to seek that one true love in our lives, and we can’t help but use whatever methods are available. I hope big sis doesn’t mind.”

Chu Chuyan still felt somewhat uncomfortable. This girl even called her big sis!

She took a deep breath, and then said with a darkened tone, “Lady Qiu’s prestige is renowned. There are too many men who are willing to make you their wife outright. Wouldn’t you feel it an injustice if you merely became our Zu An’s concubine?”

She was still slightly baffled. No matter how outstanding Ah Zu was, he was but the lowest drafted son-in-law. Just what was she plotting?

“I won’t feel unjustly treated at all!” Qiu Honglei turned around and gave Zu An a sincere look. “I would rather become the concubine of a hero than the wife of someone mediocre! If I can become Ah Zu’s woman, then that would be the greatest blessing of my lifetime! How can I call this an injustice?”

The three members of the Chu clan could barely believe their ears. They stared at her, speechless.

Zu An was the only one struggling to hold back his laughter like an idiot.

Chu Chuyan’s face became gloomy. She was silent for a while before saying, “I have a question I wish to ask Lady Qiu. Just how did you find out about young master Wang’s whereabouts? After all, our Chu clan couldn’t find him even after mobilizing all of our men.”

“Is big sis suspecting that I was the one who sent out men to kidnap young master Wang? Where would Honglei get the courage to do such a thing?” Qiu Honglei smiled. “Everyone employs their own methods. Our Immortal Abode has all sorts of guests, and information flows more quickly there compared to elsewhere. I just happened to pick up this piece of information as well.”

Chu Chuyan nodded, accepting her explanation. “Fine, I’ll agree to let you join our household. When the time comes, the Chu clan will also send people to pay the fee to take you out of the Immortal Abode and formally bring you in. You can tell us where young master Wang is now, right?”
