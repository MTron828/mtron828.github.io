Chapter 1815: Questioning Life

Chu Chuyan’s sword was powerful, and more importantly, every skill was beautiful. She was like a goddess on an ice mountain. She really was stunning.

Pei Mianman had black roses blooming all around her. The flames she brandished seemed extremely magical. Even the celestial soldiers were burned and corroded if they made contact with even a bit of the fire.

Qiu Honglei was graceful and elegant. Her skills were clearly vicious and ruthless, but in the eyes of others, it was as if she were performing a beautiful dance that didn’t seem repulsive in the slightest. Any onlookers would only want to see her complete the dance. However, at that point, perhaps her blade would already have pierced their vitals. Besides that, the mysterious lantern she had made even the celestial army’s movements slow down when they entered its light.

Yun Jianyue was like a goddess of death. A mountain of corpses and a sea of blood appeared behind her. Whenever she attacked, it always left many dead. Even the celestial troops were subconsciously avoiding her.

There was no need to even say too much about Jing Teng. The level of skill she used was high. The white tiger she summoned was incredibly fierce, to the extent that it could be considered the main force of this battle. If not for the fact that her cultivation wasn’t high enough, Sun En suspected that her white tiger alone would be enough to wipe out his celestial army.

It’s actually even higher-level than my Record of Emperor’s Suppression?

As for Xie Daoyun, she didn’t fight on the front lines; instead, she hid in the back and used all sorts of formations. A hazy radiance surrounded the women on the battlefield, increasing the recovery of their ki, offering defenses, eliminating negative effects…

The other women all looked at her with goodwill. Who didn’t want a reliable supporter in their party? Furthermore, from the looks of it, she only had a sibling level relationship with Zu An, and things hadn’t gone any further.

When he saw his impressive looking army being pushed back bit by bit, Sun En suddenly wondered whether there was something wrong with the world.

Most of these women were only master rank, but were they really freaking master ranks? If they were normal master rank cultivators, just a single divine soldier would’ve been enough to kill one of them! They were all geniuses who could fight enemies at a higher level than themselves.

How was that pretty boy able to gather so many outstanding women? Most importantly, they’re all so devoted to him too!

Furthermore, they’re all so absurdly beautiful! Hey, if you’re that outstanding, which man can’t you go after? Why do you have to hang yourself on this single tree?

They had been getting all jealous over a single man. Just the thought alone made him feel annoyed.

In this battle against the celestial army, Zu An never did a thing. He only let his women fight.

Sun En was a bit alarmed. It was as if he were looking at a male lion on the prairie, and everything was being done by the lionesses. All the lion had to do was open his mouth to eat.

This level of mooching… is really freaking enviable.

Sun En looked at Zu An and said, “Kid, I’m suddenly starting to be interested in you.”

Zu An shivered and reflexively took a step back. He looked at Sun En vigilantly and exclaimed, “Sorry, but I don’t like men!”

Sun En was stunned.

This one doesn’t fucking like men either! Why the hell are your thoughts going in that direction?!

You have successfully trolled Sun En for +444 +444 +444…

Zu An became even more guarded when he sensed the anger. He thought that his rejection had angered Sun En.

Sun En forcefully suppressed his anger and said, “How about we make a deal? If you tell me where the Baopu Sutra is, I can ignore the fact that you killed my subordinates earlier. Also, I will spare your lives.”

He didn’t even need to talk to Jing Teng directly. Judging from how intimately she was clinging to his arm, she would definitely agree with whatever Zu An said.

Zu An couldn't help but laugh. He said, “It seems you don’t need to give a single thing, and yet you want to get the most precious thing. Isn’t this transaction a bit too unfair?”

“Killing Zang Ao for Miss Jing can be considered getting revenge for her. How can you say that I didn’t do anything?” Sun En retorted, then changed the topic. “Furthermore, aren’t your lives the most precious things? Could it be that you don’t even cherish that?” He didn’t mention Wang Youjun’s life. It was clear that in his eyes, that wasn’t much of a cost at all.

Zu An couldn't help but sigh, saying, “You really know how to make up cards to play. How did our own lives become your condition?”

Sun En said apathetically, “It seems I was too nice to you all, and you developed some unrealistic delusions.”

Now that the women were preoccupied by the Record of Emperor’s Suppression, it was the perfect time to deal with this pretty boy. As soon as he realized that, he pointed at Zu An from afar.

In that instant, a vision of a streak of lightning crashing down on his head appeared in Zu An’s mind. With a flash, he evaded to one side. Sure enough, a bolt of lightning as thick as an arm struck down on where he had been. Sun En was clearly still holding back, worried that he would accidentally kill Zu An and make Jing Teng completely opposed to him.

Zu An was about to say something when a vision of him being surrounded by a sea of lightning appeared in his mind. His expression changed. He knew that these were warnings from ‘The Book’. He quickly used Grandgale to move another hundred meters away.

The instant he left, everything within dozens of meters around where he had been turned into a sea of lightning. Berserk lightning bolts lashed out like whips, sealing off every corner of that space. It was just like the sea of lightning that had killed Zang Ao before, but a bit smaller in scale.

Zu An’s expression changed. He had thought that Sun En would go easy, but he had never expected the guy to actually be this fierce! The first bolt of lightning seemed to have actually been for the purpose of chasing him away from Jing Teng and Xie Daoyun. Then, what followed was the real trap that awaited him.

Zang Ao had fallen into a similar trap earlier. Zu An wondered just how Sun En had set up that lightning field, and how he had predicted the direction of that dodge.

Sun En was even more shocked, exclaiming, “You actually avoided it?”

After all, he had managed the Divine Firmament Sect for so many years and had all kinds of tricks. He had actually secretly planted lightning seeds everywhere. As long as he willed it, the seeds would trigger and instantly produce a destructive lightning field. Of course, once they were activated, it would be some time before they could be activated again.

However, the skill was practically impossible to defend properly against. Unless one was at the same rank and could tell that something was off through divine sense, a single careless moment would lead to one’s end, just as with Zang Ao.

And yet, what kind of cultivation did Zu An have? How could he possibly have divine sense on the same level as Sun En, enough to avoid this ultimate attack?

“Could it just be a coincidence?” Sun En wondered, sending another bolt of lightning over.

Zu An dodged once again, as if he had foresight.

“This guy really can anticipate danger, as expected,” Sun En remarked with a cold snort.

There has to be a limit to this kind of premonition. Let’s see just how many times you can dodge.

Then, several bolts of lightning continuously targeted Zu An. This time, Sun En didn’t use his ultimate lightning domain so he wouldn’t waste energy on a miss. First, he would use frequent lightning strikes to keep Zu An running. That way, he would eventually create an opportunity Zu An couldn’t react to.

Sure enough, Zu An began to slow down as he dashed all over the area. After all, his soul couldn't completely endure The Book’s operation at full power. Eventually, he began to feel waves of fatigue. Furthermore, whenever he used Grandgale, there was actually a cooldown period too. It wasn’t too big of a deal against others, but someone like Sun En naturally noticed the opening. As such, he increased the frequency even more so Zu An couldn't fully avoid them.

Fortunately, Zu An wasn’t foolish enough to just let himself get hit without doing anything. From time to time, he used ‘What you lookin’ at’, forcibly interrupting Sun En’s skill, giving him a bit more time to catch his breath.

“I’m looking at you, shithead!”

After being interrupted several times in a row, Sun En was getting frustrated. Even though this youngster’s cultivation was low, he had all sorts of strange abilities. They were so strange and unique that even he was starting to wish he could get his hands on them.

“These are nothing more than small tricks. I want to see just how long you can last!” Sun En said with a snort. He decided to not use his mouth, instead using instant-cast abilities.

‘What you lookin’ at’ was quite effective against Soulspeak, but Sun En’s skill was clearly not Soulspeak. As long as he was ready for it, even if he was interrupted by ‘What you lookin’ at’, he could still use his skill.

When they saw that Zu An was surrounded by danger, the women wanted to help, but Sun En was prepared. He used the Record of Emperor’s Suppression to summon even more celestial soldiers, keeping them busy once more.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Sun En sneered.

You can’t mooch off women forever. Let’s see who’ll come and save you now!

Eventually, Zu An failed to dodge in time and was hit by a bolt of lightning. Several more bolts of lightning quickly followed and hit him. After several bitter screams, he collapsed to the ground, unable to resist at all anymore.

Sun En commanded the celestial army to keep the women preoccupied while saying to Jing Teng, “Hurry and tell me where the inner manual is. Otherwise, I will first cut off one of his arms. It will be too late for regrets if you continue to resist.”

Jing Teng’s expression changed several times. She was clearly struggling a lot. She was about to say something, but then Zu An, who had been lying on the ground, suddenly moved.

Sun En frowned. Was there any point to this kind of futile struggle? He was about to do something when he felt his entire body tremble. He couldn't help but scream, “Ikuu ikuu!”

The Ikuu Experience Card had been activated!
