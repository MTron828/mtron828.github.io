Chapter 270: A Beautiful Woman’s Deep Affection

Translator: Pika

Who else has reached my level of awesomeness as a man?!

It’s not that I want to criticize all of the men I’ve met so far, but all of you are trash!

If Zu An had a tail, it would be pointing straight at the ceiling right about now.

However, he did find things a little strange. For better or for worse, Shang Liuyu was already a close friend of his. After the interactions that they had, it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that even their souls had grown closer together. There was even less of a need to talk about Chu Chuyan—she was his wife, after all. The two of them had gone through a life-or-death ordeal together, and had even engaged in the most intimate exchange...

It wasn’t strange for them to give him such items at all.

But this Qiu Honglei, on the other hand...

The two of them had clearly tried to deceive each other right from the very start, both of them scheming endlessly in hopes that the other would fall into their trap first.

Their interactions seemed full of joy and affection, but Zu An knew just how much of it was merely an empty show.

Right now, however, he had no idea what in the world this lass was trying to do.

He didn’t take it in a hurry. Instead, he looked calmly into Qiu Honglei’s beautiful eyes. “This thing is way too precious. Why would the lady give me something like this?”

“Young master’s words truly leave me broken hearted!” Qiu Honglei’s expression was full of sorrow. “My heart already belongs to the young master! I don’t want the lover I have chosen to face an early death... I’m still waiting patiently for the day young master takes me away from the Immortal Abode...”

Zu An pressed his lips together tightly.

His rational mind told him not to believe a single word coming out of this woman’s mouth. However, there was no way his heart could be unaffected by a show of such deep affection!

He took a deep breath, doing his best to settle his chaotic thoughts. He finally said with a chuckle, “Thanks a bunch, then! I’ll come to claim my lady when I get a chance!”

What do I have to be scared of? I’m a man, after all! Besides, it’s not like I have anything to lose anyway. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Even if there is some trick behind this, if worse comes to worst, I’ll just offer my body or something as compensation.

Qiu Honglei smiled. “Young master better not turn your back on me.”

The tenderness in her tone was enough to melt even the most well-tempered steel. Zu An immediately warned himself to stay calm. “Lady Qiu is so beautiful, I don’t think there’s any man in the world who could turn their back on you.”

Qiu Honglei gently shook her head, her expression slightly melancholy.

“How can a lasting relationship be built on looks alone? Honglei has always been seeking someone who is truly caring. I hope the young master doesn’t disappoint me.”

Damn it, damn it I can’t take it anymore! This woman is too bloody good! “Ahem, ahem... since this Mirror Mirage can hide one’s cultivation and aura, I wonder if the lady’s cultivation is extremely high? Was this the skill you used to deceive the eyes of everyone in Brightmoon City?”

Qiu Honglei smiled. “The young master’s imagination is truly rich. All types of guests come to Immortal Abode, and Honglei only has a small reputation. Many of them bring all sorts of precious gifts, hoping to see me smile. How could I refuse them? That’s why I’ve ended up collecting so many secret manuals. If the young master has a need, you can see if there is anything else that catches your eye.”

Zu An felt as if he was being tossed about in a storm. There are always many simps around, regardless of what world you’re in... They have no idea their precious things are being used to curry favor with another man!

Hm? But why does this make me feel so good?

Zu An smiled. “Gorgeous lady, your affection for me is too strong, and I really don’t know how to repay you. How about I devote my body entirely to you?” With that, he threw himself at her.

Qiu Honglei tapped her feet lightly. Her dress fluttered about, as she perfectly escaped his grasping hands. “Ah Zu, you’ve already made me a promise! Only after you take me in will I... will I... serve you.”

Her words were punctuated with a natural shyness, truly taking her performance to the next level.

“Honglei, it seems like I’ve been too rude to you.” Zu An laughed heartily, but his mind was incredibly clear. It seems like this woman really is putting on an act.

His actions had looked willful, but he had actually paid special note to the angle and timing of his approach. There shouldn’t have been any way for this lass to escape, yet she had done so effortlessly. As expected, her cultivation was high.

It even seems to be much higher than mine.

Zu An grew depressed at that thought. Why are all the girls I run into so terribly strong?

Can’t I run into some that are weaker, to boost my confidence a little?

That brat Huanzhao immediately appeared in his mind. At least there’s lil’ Huanzhao to keep me company.

“Ah Zu~” Qiu Honglei was elated that Zu An had changed the way he addressed her, and she called out to him intimately in response.

Zu An was still trying to figure out her objective, but it somehow kept eluding him. He let the matter rest. At least it doesn’t seem like she wanted to harm him.

In that case, he would try to make use of her as much as he could.

He thought for a moment, then asked, “Honglei, your Immortal Abode has an excellent information network, right?”

“Men from all over the world love to frequent this place. You know how men are—once they’ve had a little to drink, they would easily run their mouths in front of women. That is how our Immortal Abode gets to know about many things.” Qiu Honglei favored him with a sweet smile. “I wonder what it is that Ah Zu wants to know?” she asked.

“Do you know about the situation surrounding the illicit salt trade in Brightmoon City?” Zu An’s mind came to rest on the issue that was troubling Chu Chuyan deeply. He couldn’t help but ask about this.

“The illicit salt trade?” Qiu Honglei’s heart skipped a beat. “Ah Zu is worried about the Chu clan’s current situation?”

“Honglei is exceptionally intelligent, as expected,” Zu An said with a bitter smile. “The Chu clan is slightly troubled by the rampant trade in illicit salt, and is struggling to find a suitable way to deal with this issue.”

He wanted to test the waters using the Chu clan’s current situation, in order to see which side Qiu Honglei was on.

Qiu Honglei frowned. “Brightmoon City’s illicit salt trade has indeed begun to spread unchecked, mostly because the profits from it are too great to ignore. All those who engage in the illicit salt business are known criminals. In order to find the strength to stand against the authorities, they’ve come together to form their respective underworld gangs.”

“Gangs?” Zu An was stunned.

“Indeed.” Qiu Honglei gathered her thoughts before continuing. “From what I know, the largest gang in the area is the Whale Gang, and they have amassed a fortune precisely through this illicit salt trade. Their leader has always been a mystery. There are many different speculations over his true identity, without a single definitive conclusion.”

“The Whale Gang...” Zu An wore a pensive expression. “Is there any other information?”

Qiu Honglei shook her head. “You know full well what my current status is. A person like me rarely comes into contact with such people. I’ve never paid special attention to this affair either, so I don’t know too much,” she said apologetically. “But, since you want to know so badly, I can help you look into it over the next few days. I might be able to gather some information.”

“You have my thanks, Honglei!” Zu An was overjoyed. The Chu clan was still considered part of the government, after all, so it would be hard for their investigations to produce anything. However, the Immortal Abode straddled the line between the legal and illegal. It would surely be much quicker for him to discover the information he needed in such a place. Moreover, Qiu Honglei’s status would help to move things along as well.

“Why is there a need for thanks between us?” Qiu Honglei said with a smile.

...

Zu An chatted with her a while longer. Eventually, the sky grew dark, and he got up to bid her farewell.

Qiu Honglei didn’t pressure him to stay. She was worried that he might do something that crossed the line if he stayed over. She saw him out.

When she returned to her room, Gu Yueyi was already waiting by the doorway.

His eyes were still completely bewitched by her appearance, but he was smart enough to show more restraint, especially after what had happened the last time. He immediately lowered his head and asked, “Junior sister, why do you treat that fellow so well? You’ve even passed on your clan’s special skill to him!”

Qiu Honglei leisurely sat down on a chair. “I hand-picked him personally, after all. How can I allow him to be killed by Chen Xuan just like that?”

Gu Yueyi raised his head to sneak in a peek. Her dress rustled as she sat down, and he hoped that something would be revealed. Unfortunately, he saw nothing.

Screw that absolute area!

Worried that she might notice his actions, he hurriedly asked, “Do you really want to help him deal with the illicit salt traders? Those fellas are all ruthless and cold-blooded criminals!”

“Are we any different?” Qiu Honglei sneered. She folded her legs in an extremely natural manner. “I was worried about how to get myself involved, but it seems a good opportunity has presented itself. Zu An’s standing in the Chu clan is still too low right now, and he won’t be beneficial for our future plans.

“If we use this chance to help him stamp out this illicit salt trade that is troubling the Chu clan, it should allow him to slowly climb up the clan’s ranks. I can even use this opportunity to get closer to him. He’ll come to realize that he would definitely need our help if he wants to have some say in the Chu clan.”

Gu Yueyi stared at her legs and swallowed. “It seems junior sister has thought far ahead after all!”

Qiu Honglei snickered. She reached out her hand and clenched it into a fist. “Even though that fellow is somewhat different from other men, he still won’t escape my grasp.”

...

“Achoo!”

On his way back to the Chu Estate, Zu An suddenly sneezed. “I wonder which beauty is thinking of me.”

Jiao Shao and the other two guards exchanged glances. They idly wondered how this fellow had trained himself to develop such thick skin.

However, the three of them had had a wonderful time in the Immortal Abode, and they knew that it had all been because of Zu An. As such, their eyes carried a little more admiration for him than usual.

Zu An paid them no attention. He was constantly scanning his surroundings, but failed to find any trace of Chen Xuan.

I didn’t get any Rage points, either. He’s probably not here.

With that, Zu An began to flip through the jade strips he’d received from Qiu Honglei.

He channeled a wave of vital energy into one of the jade strips, and a streak of light flickered across the surface. He sensed a series of words entering his mindscape.

“The body is the tree of wisdom, within the heart rests a mirror. Wipe it frequently, do not let it grow dusty...”

Upon careful study, he discovered that the principles of this secret art bore a similarity to the Buddhist philosophy of his previous world—they both pursued a state of ‘nothingness’.

If one wanted to completely conceal their cultivation and auras, they had to become ‘nothing’ first.

The further he comprehended ‘nothingness’, the greater the effects of concealment. This would enable him to hide his cultivation from even higher level experts.

He continued to ponder over the principles of this secret art on the journey back. Just as they were about to reach Chu estate, Jiao Shan, Feng Daniu, and Zhou Lujun all turned around suddenly, and let out identical cries of surprise.

“What’s wrong?” Zu An asked.

“Nothing. It could be that our perception failed us. Young master seemed to have suddenly disappeared just now.” Zhou Lujun replied. The other two nodded in agreement.

Despite what they had sensed, Zu An was clearly still there! Could it be that they had enjoyed themselves a little too much in the Immortal Abode, and their minds had become weak?

It seems like we really need to show a bit more restraint in the future.

Shame burned within the hearts of all three guards.

In contrast, Zu An was delighted. He was a genius with transcendent talent after all! He had already mastered this secret art so quickly!

When he reached the estate, Zu An returned to his room first, then secretly made his way to Chu Chuyan’s residence.

It was time for his dear wife’s treatment again.

Peering into the pitch-black interior, Zu An suddenly felt a wave of hesitation wash over him. Qin Wanru won’t be inside again tonight, will she?
