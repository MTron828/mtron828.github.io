Chapter 1799: Methods Left Behind

“What? Agate of Enlightenment?!” Zu An exclaimed in his mind. He had only picked it up to draw Zhao Han’s attention. How could he have known that it was that thing?

After all, it was one of the ingredients Mi Li said she needed to reconstruct her body. So far, he had only found enough of the Five-Colored Springflower. Even though he had found some Agate of Enlightenment in the Fiend races’ treasury, it was the main material for reconstructing the body.

There were some who liked to praise beauties by saying that their skin was as fine as jade, but if Mi Li really came back to life, that would actually be the case. A human body wasn’t that large, but it wasn’t that small either. That was why they needed more than just a bit. The amount he had obtained back in the treasury was only enough to create a loli.

Even though that would be quite the interesting sight too, Mi Li definitely wouldn’t be happy. Perhaps it wouldn’t even be enough after adding this bottle. She’d definitely be unhappy if they ended up largely discounting her chest.

He had just casually grabbed it before, but now that he knew it was the Agate of Enlightenment, he had to get it no matter what.

However, Zhao Han had already seen his movements and taken a look. How powerful was his divine will? He instantly noticed the contents of the bottle. “Hm? It seems to be jade, but I’ve never seen it in this state. It seems to be releasing endless spiritual energy, so it’s definitely extremely precious…”

Zu An immediately interrupted him. “Your majesty, we already agreed that you’d give us the first pick. You already obtained the immortal pill, so you won’t act up so quickly, right? There’s no way, obviously.”

Zhao Han narrowed his eyes. He hadn’t expected the flag he had set up himself to come into effect so quickly. After some hesitation, he didn’t fight over it in the end. It wasn’t time for them to grow hostile yet. Furthermore, even though the jade was precious, it wasn’t all that useful for him.

However, that was only because he didn’t know much about the Agate of Enlightenment. Otherwise, he definitely wouldn’t have stepped aside so easily.

But why is this brat’s tone so irritating?

You have successfully trolled Zhao Han for +110 +110 +110…

Zu An put the Agate of Enlightenment into the Brilliant Glass Bead, then secretly said to Mi Li, “Master empress, I’ve found another portion of Agate of Enlightenment so quickly! I’ll be able to recreate your body soon.”

“That’s right. I didn’t expect it to be so soon,” Mi Li said, her voice trembling a bit. This rate of progress was clearly outside of her expectations. At first, she had been worried that there wouldn’t be any hope at all in this lifetime, and yet in just a few years, they had found two of the materials! The only thing was that her body could be forced to shrink a bit.

“Haven’t you suddenly discovered that you didn’t follow the wrong person?” Zu An remarked, smiling proudly.

“Hmph, who’s following whom here? I’m your master, you cheeky brat,” Mi Li said. However, When she thought about the Agate of Enlightenment, her mood was really good and she didn’t get angry. “That flame inside the coffin is pretty special. I don’t know anything about it either, but it should be quite helpful for Qiu Honglei. You have to help her obtain it.”

Zu An was stunned, asking, “You’re actually thinking about other women?”

Mi Li said proudly, “But of course. I am your master, and these women will become my disciple’s wives and need to treat me with utmost respect. Of course I need to treat them well.”

Zu An was speechless. However, he had already thought of that even without Mi Li telling him anything. As such, he said, “I’ve already chosen this item, but Honglei, you haven’t picked one yet. How about you just take that flame?”

Qiu Honglei was inwardly happy. She actually really wanted that flame, so her hands formed a seal to try and take it.

Zhao Han raised his brows. He was about to say something when Zu An said first, “Your majesty already said that we’d be allowed to choose first. I just chose one, so it’s their turn. Your majesty’s words are more precious than jade and gold, and your generosity knows no bounds. Hey, why aren’t you thanking his majesty yet?”

Qiu Honglei was also sharp. She smiled and said, “Thank you, your majesty.”

Zhao Han’s face twitched. He hadn’t expected the Devil Sect’s Saintess to actually thank him one day. But why couldn't he bring himself to feel happy at all?

He looked at Jing Teng with a scowl. Only then did he say, “There’s no need for that. Once we find another treasure, this emperor will choose first again.”

He didn’t know Zu An’s hidden cards and still needed his help in defeating the Ghost King. At the same time, however, Jing Teng was too mysterious. She had an extremely close relationship with the great tomb and Immortal Ruler Baopu. They still hadn’t encountered the immortal opportunity, so it was best to not offend them for now.

Zu An smiled and said, “But of course.”

Qiu Honglei was alarmed, thinking, What if the next thing is the immortal opportunity or a method of immortality? Why isn’t Ah Zu worried at all?

However, when she recalled what he said earlier, she still calmed herself down and continued to collect the flame. As the Devil Sect’s Saintess, she didn’t lack inheritances or secret methods. Unfortunately, no matter what she did, she just couldn't make the fire her own. She was starting to sweat from anxiety. Zu An wasn’t as experienced as her in that field, so he couldn't help her even if he wanted to.

Mi Li suddenly said, “Tell her to use that Empress Lantern.”

They called it the Empress Lantern, but it was actually just an imitation from the Devil Sect. It was far from the one Yun Jianyue had. Still, Zu An quickly reminded Qiu Honglei, whose eyes lit up. She took out the replica Empress Lantern. When the flame saw the lantern, it immediately brightened a bit and jumped straight in.

The lantern’s ember immediately became much brighter, as if it were trying to chase away the invader. The two began to struggle; the others now noticed that it wasn’t an ember at all, but rather a wick.

Eventually, the new wick tangled around the original one like a snake. The intense fighting gradually calmed down, and the two wicks merged into a new one.

Zu An had a strange expression as he thought, Are there male and female wicks? Did they join together somehow?

Qiu Honglei didn’t pay attention to that stuff. She could clearly sense her own Empress Lantern becoming stronger. It was giving off a hint of aura that even she didn’t understand. Since it had just merged together, perhaps because it still needed some time to stabilize, she wasn’t too sure what kind of ability it had yet. However, after using it for so many years, she knew for certain that the lantern had become stronger. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even Zhao Han was becoming a bit moved when he saw that. If not for the fact that what he really cared about was the immortal opportunity, he likely would have already tried to steal it. The wick was clearly quite magical. If he got his hands on it and properly refined it, he could even have a chance of creating another divine weapon.

Qiu Honglei fondled her Empress Lantern lovingly while Zu An walked over to Jing Teng’s side and said, “Miss Jing, you should pick one too.” He figured it would be a good idea to get as many items as he could while Zhao Han was still trapped by his earlier words.

However, Jing Teng shook her head and said, “There’s no need.”

Forget about Zu An, even Zhao Han was a bit puzzled. Why did this woman look as if she didn’t care about any of the treasures here? Could it be that what she wanted was that immortal opportunity?

Zhao Han immediately grew nervous and walked over to her side, saying, “Miss Jing, Immortal Ruler Baopu’s corpse is right here. Did he truly ascend to immortality?”

“That’s right. I don’t know what’s going on with these remains either,” Jing Teng replied.

Zhao Han frowned and asked, “In that case, does he have any inheritances or… immortal opportunities that he left behind?”

When she heard the words ‘immortal opportunity’, even Qiu Honglei paid closer attention.

Mi Li said to Zu An, “Look, another person driven mad by the thought of immortality. Emperors are all the same no matter which generation. As soon as they’re about to die, they all become freaks over that.”

Zu An said with a frown, “I’m actually a bit confused about something. There are many warriors who don’t fear death, and all those who become emperors are outstanding warriors. Why do they always suddenly become even worse than ordinary ruffians?”

“Are the lives of ordinary people the same as those of emperors? Normal people live difficult lives, so they don’t cherish life even if they end up giving it up for things others might not believe are worth it. But emperors grasp the greatest authority in the world. A single word can control the lives of countless people. How could they be willing to give up on that kind of life?” Mi Li remarked with a sneer.

Zu An suddenly felt as if he understood a bit. In his previous world, the leaders and bosses all praised 996 as a karmic blessing. They all boasted about how long they worked and how they had to come into the office all the same. But did the bosses really experience the same things as ordinary workers?

“That’s why Qin Shihuang sent out so many people in search of the immortal medicine even though he knew fully well that most of those were fake, and did it happily,” Mi Li said. She suddenly added, “I recovered some memories not too long ago. Actually, my relationship with Ying Zheng wasn’t what you might be thinking. We weren’t close…” She tried to say something but then hesitated, as if she didn’t know how to describe it.

Zu An was stunned; he had never expected her to suddenly talk about that.

He was about to ask her about it when Jing Teng suddenly replied, “Since it’s called an immortal opportunity, it naturally belongs to those who are destined for it. If I knew about something like that, I would already have ascended back then. Why would I have waited all the way until now?”

Zhao Han frowned. Even though he wasn’t quite satisfied with the answer, he knew that what she said made some sense. He thought, Hmph, since this emperor is here, the timing is definitely meant for me. Even if it isn’t, I’ll just steal it from the real inheritor then.

He became much more certain afterward. Then, he asked another question he had been concerned about. “Right, the lady said earlier that you had a way of dealing with the Ghost King. Since we’ve already arrived in front of the immortal ruler’s tomb, just what was it?”

Jing Teng shook her head and said, “I don’t know, but I just feel that there’s something that can deal with the Ghost King here. But as for exactly what it is, I don’t know.”

Zhao Han frowned. Even though he had the Human Emperor Seal protecting him and it wasn’t that difficult for him to ensure his own safety, he really didn’t feel all that at ease with someone so terrifying and powerful constantly eyeing him covetously. If he couldn't figure out the way to deal with the Ghost King, the immortal opportunity could end up being lost.

Zu An walked over and stood protectively in front of Jing Teng, saying, “I’m sure the immortal ruler left behind some other methods. Let’s try to find them.”

Jing Teng felt warm from his concern. She gave him a faint smile, her face slightly pale.

…

Then, thee group looked around the coffin. Even though there were still some more treasures, none of it could compare to the Agate of Enlightenment and the strange wick. They just couldn't figure out what exactly could defeat the Ghost King.

In the end, their gazes all landed on the immortal ruler’s remains. If there really was something, it would most likely be on his body, right?
