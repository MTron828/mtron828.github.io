Chapter 281 - A Visit from a Beauty

Translator: Pika

“Oh? What kind of business proposal?” The woman behind the screen sounded curious.

Chen Xuan laughed loudly, but didn’t answer her question immediately. “Both sides should express their sincerity before business is discussed,” he said instead. “I’ve done my part by coming here personally, yet this gang boss still shuns me and refuses to show herself. Don’t you feel that this lacks sincerity?”

A delicate laugh came from behind the screen. “This is a custom that I have already gotten used to after so many years. I hope Stockade Master Chen does not take offense.”

A beautiful and enchanting figure slowly emerged from behind the screen as soon as she finished speaking.

Chen Xuan’s eyes immediately lit up. The girl in front of him was dressed in a fiery red outfit. She wore a cropped top that exposed her tight, well-sculpted abs. Her skin was fair and smooth, supple and soft, yet he could tell from a single look that her waist was extremely flexible. He fantasized about her sitting on him while gyrating her hips. Her movements would definitely be graceful and full of explosive strength.

Not only did her top fail to cover her stomach completely, it was tight enough to reveal an ample amount of cleavage. A deep valley sat between her tall peaks, drawing attention and yet revealing none of its secrets.

Of course, the more was teased, the more it caused the heart to quicken.

The only regret was that most of her face was concealed under a red veil. He couldn’t make out her facial features clearly.

But, with those large and beautiful eyes, it was clear that the rest of her face below definitely wouldn’t disappoint.

Of course, with an exceptional figure like that, whether her face was beautiful or not didn’t detract from her attractiveness.

At the same time, however, he found her appearance a little strange. Those involved in underground smuggling were usually outside every day, eating and sleeping outdoors. Her skin should have been more tanned. Why did it look like she took milk baths everyday? This gang boss looked more like a girl from a wealthy family.

However, this gang boss had always been mysterious, and never appeared in front of others. That could explain her fair complexion.

This red-clothed young lady didn’t seem to mind his hungry gaze. A charming smile appeared at the corners of her lips. “Is this enough to express my sincerity?”

“But of course!” Chen Xuan exclaimed immediately. There’ll be even more sincerity if you stripped a bit more.

“Then, I wonder just what kind of business Stockade Master Chen wishes to discuss with me?” The woman’s voice carried a flirtatious tone. Together with her sexy outfit and toned body, they were more than enough to make any man turn into an animal.

This chick could even hold her own against that Immortal Abode’s Qiu Honglei! Chen Xuan swallowed. He felt an unbearable urge to rush up and give that amazing body a squeeze.

However, the Whale Gang’s reputation was fearsome, and it gave him some pause. He didn’t dare act recklessly before he learned more about this group.

“I came here today to discuss an investment.” Chen Xuan’s eyes roamed back and forth between her chest and bottom. I want to invest in both of these assets.

“I do not know what Stockade Master Chen is referring to.” The woman sounded a little confused.

“I’m clearly talking about the illicit salt trade! Could it be that the Whale Gang is involved in other businesses?” Chen Xuan leisurely leaned back into his chair, wantonly admiring the beauty before him.

Discussing business with such a pretty woman really was a joyful thing.

The woman’s brow furrowed, and her voice cooled slightly. “The Blackwind Stockade has always been an independent operator. What is the Stockade Leader trying to say?”

The illicit salt trade generated tremendous profits, and she obviously didn’t want to split the profits with another.

“There’s no need for you to worry. I didn’t come here to fight for a share of your respected gang’s business. Rather, I propose that we cooperate,” Chen Xuan explained.

The woman was puzzled. “How do you want to cooperate?”

Chen Xuan said, “From a certain perspective, your Whale Gang’s business is even more dangerous than our Blackwind Stockade’s activities. Both the royal court and Brightmoon Duke would be much happier without your business, which is a constant thorn in their side. The stuff you sell isn't even inferior to the official salt at all—perhaps it is even slightly better. The only thing separating your goods from the official ones are the salt permits.”

“Could it be that you can fetch some salt permits?” The woman suddenly grew interested.

Chen Xuan smiled. “Why else would I dare come to this island to disturb you?”

“These salt permits are controlled extremely strictly by the royal court, and only a fixed amount are issued every year. How could you possibly...” Something struck her mid-sentence. “I heard that Wang clan’s young master was kidnapped. I reckon that this is the stockade master’s work?”

Chen Xuan was slightly surprised. “I didn’t expect the gang boss to have such a great information information network on this island.”

The woman smiled faintly. “Of course we do. In our line of work, a good information network is crucial. If not, our gang would have already perished several times over.”

Chen Xuan felt that her words carried a lot of sense. “You are correct,” he confirmed. “I have a way of obtaining a batch of official salt permits through the Wang clan, which is why I want to invest these salt permits in the illicit salt business.”

The woman thought for a moment, then nodded. “I must admit that this deal interests me. I wonder how Stockade Master Chen wishes to split the profits?”

Chen Xuan laughed and said, “Since both of us have expressed such sincerity, then it obviously must be fifty-fifty! That way, neither side loses out.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The woman laughed coldly at his proposal. “Neither side loses out? The stockade leader is merely providing us with some salt permits and does not need to do anything else. Moreover, your salt permits cost nothing to you. Isn’t it a bit too much to ask for fifty percent?”

Chen Xuan put away his smile. “This is where the gang boss’ words are incorrect. The salt trade is full of profit to be made. The biggest difference between illicit and official salt are the salt permits. We are now offering you all a means to sell your product legally. How can fifty percent be too much?”

“That is not how the numbers are tallied up,” said the woman, her voice growing darker. “The illicit salt we sell and the sales of official salt go down entirely different paths. If we give you half our profits just like that, we might even end up with less than if we had just sold all the salt illegally. Why would we bother going through all this effort, then?”

Chen Xuan shook his head. “Gang boss, please do not try to bully me just because you think I do not understand this trade. Illicit salt sells for twenty to thirty qian a jin, while official salt normally sells for a hundred qian, and up to even a hundred and fifty qian. That is six to seven times the profits! How can you say that you might be losing money through this deal?”

“Stockade master only knows part of the information. Even though the price of government salt is high, the ordinary people cannot afford it, and all of them turn to our illicit salt,” explained the woman. “That is why the six- to seven-times profit is only theoretical. In reality, it doesn’t reach this price at all, and actually sells for far below this price.”

“Then how much does the gang boss feel is suitable?” Chen Xuan knew about the reality of the situation as well. He was only deliberately pressuring the other party earlier.

The woman remained silent for a while. Then, a number escaped her red lips. “Ten percent of next year’s profits, at most.”

“Ten percent?” Chen Xuan was furious. He suddenly stood up from his chair. “Are you trying to bait a beggar or something? I came in good faith! Isn’t the gang boss crossing the line?”

A wave of pressure surged outwards. The Whale Gang members outside tried to rush in, but they were halted by a command from the woman.

After ordering her subordinates to stand down, she turned around and said in a steady voice, “Please do not be quick to anger, Stockade Master Chen. Listen to me explain more in detail. Our illicit salt will sell even without salt permits—compared to selling salt officially, these two modes are entirely different. Of course, having salt permits can add an extra layer of protection, decreasing our business risk. It is just a pity that Stockade master’s salt permits are only a one time deal. You have no way of providing a steady source of them.

“In addition, the stockade leader should not think that our position is comfortable. In reality, a portion of our income is used to bribe various parties. How else could we have survived for so many years? Most of the profits go into the hands of those people, and we only have a small share to ourselves. That is why offering the stockade master a tenth of the profits is already a strain.”

A secretive smile appeared on Chen Xuan’s face. “I’ve heard that the Whale Gang has some connections within the government. I wonder—which great figure is sharing the limelight with you?”

This woman’s expression grew dark. “The stockade master is going too far with this question.”

Chen Xuan knew that she would remain silent on the matter. He laughed loudly and said, “Twenty percent, then. I can’t go any lower.”

The woman shook her head. “Fifteen percent at most!”

Chen Xuan was silent for a moment. “Fine, we’ve reached a deal!”

Heh, this one is going to take you into a room sooner or later. At that time, you’ll be mine, your money will be mine, and everything you have will be mine. It’s not a big deal to settle for a little less now.

“I hope for a successful partnership.” The woman wore a faint smile. She raised her teacup in a toast.

Chen Xuan was experienced in these things as well. He had no fear that she was about to poison him. Raising his cup, he took a sip and said, “I still haven’t heard the gang boss’ name after chatting for so long.”

The woman replied, “My surname is Guan.”

“Guan...” Chen Xuan was a bit annoyed. This woman didn’t even want to give him her name. It didn’t matter. He’d find out one day, anyway.

...

While this business deal was being carried out on the island, Zu An was busy searching for Chen Xuan’s hiding place, using the documents Jiang Luofu had given him.

She had constantly racked her brains over how she was going to take over the Plum Blossom Sect’s property ever since Zu An had given her the promissory note for seven-and-a-half million taels of silver. With the academy’s connections, it wasn’t too difficult to find all of Plum Blossom Sect’s assets, whether legal or underground.

When Zu An came calling, Jiang Luofu had no hesitation in handing him the information she had compiled. She was going to have him take over the property anyway, so giving him this information ahead of time wasn’t that big of a deal.

When he saw the information on all the properties packed together, Zu An was inwardly speechless. A casino actually made that much money!

He didn’t dare dally. He brought Jiao Shan and the other Chu clan guards with him. Unfortunately, their search was fruitless, even after searching for most of the evening.

Did I guess wrongly? Zu An felt dejected. He returned to the Chu Estate empty-handed.

He still had to provide Chu Chuyan with her treatment, after all.

When he returned to the Chu clan and reported what had happened, Master, Madam, and Chu Chuyan all frowned. This situation was clearly what they were the most worried about.

If they couldn’t save Wang Yuanlong, then the relationship between the Wang and Chu clans would be done for. That would truly complicate matters.

Just then, Cheng Shouping came bounding over. “Young master, young master! Someone is looking for you outside!” he said excitedly.

“Who is it?” Zu An was slightly curious. Who was looking for him so late at night, and could even make this fellow so excited?

Cheng Shouping opened his mouth. He suddenly noticed Chu Zhongtian and the others standing there with him, and immediately swallowed what he was going to say. “This humble one doesn’t dare say.”

“What is there that you don’t dare say? When did you learn to hem and haw like this?” Qin Wanru said impatiently. She had a bad impression of this fellow. Back then, he had offered to find the best concubines for her husband, which had angered her quite a bit.

Cheng Shouping was well aware that his injuries from the whipping that Second Miss Chu had given him were yet to heal. However, with Master and Madam staring at him, he didn’t dare to remain quiet. “It’s Lady Qiu,” he said.

“Which Lady Qiu?” Chu Zhongtian was stunned, his brain not quite working up to speed.

Cheng Shouping said proudly, “What other Lady Qiu is there in Brightmoon City? It’s obviously the Immortal Abode’s Qiu Honglei!”

Endless men found it difficult even to be granted a meeting with her, and yet, she had come all this way in the middle of the night just to seek out the young master! He immediately felt a measure of second-hand pride.
