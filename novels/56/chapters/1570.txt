Chapter 1519: Agate of Enlightenment

“Sect Master Yan disappeared?” Qiao Xueying asked. She had felt very worried that Yun Jianyue was there to criticize her, but when she heard the reason for the visit, she sighed in relief. “I don’t know either. She left after our chat. I didn’t notice anything strange back then.”

“Oh? Then what did you chat with her about yesterday?” Yun Jianyue asked, also feeling confused. Yan Xuehen wasn’t someone who couldn't distinguish between what was important and what wasn’t. Had something unexpected happened?

“It’s… nothing,” Qiao Xueying said, her face heating up. “I was just asking about big sister Chu’s current situation.”

She couldn't tell Yun Jianyue that they had been discussing how to deal with her disciple, right?

“That’s it?” Yun Jianyue asked with a frown. Generally, there wasn’t anyone in the Fiend King Court who could threaten the stone cold woman. Even if their cultivation was higher than hers, there was no way a battle wouldn’t cause any commotion at all.

“Yes,” Qiao Xueying said, nodding quickly.

“Snow, what happened?” the Great Elf King asked as he walked over, making sure to flip the strand of hair in front of his forehead. It was a move he had perfected over many years, as it would fully display his exceptional appearance and carefree attitude. Each time, it always made a group of young ladies or aunties scream.

However, he never really showed off because he really did like someone. After all, in his opinion, there wasn’t a single woman who was as good looking as him. The reason he did it was to enjoy the looks of shock and adoration toward his stunning beauty.

It was just a pity that Yun Jianyue wasn’t that type of woman. Furthermore, because of the annoyance she felt from not being able to find Yan Xuehen, she only found his display even more pretentious. She said, “In that case, then, I’ll ask around somewhere else.”

She knew that the Great Elf King was probably worried that she would bully his daughter, and that was why he had arrived. As Qiao Xueying had said she didn’t know, Yun Jianyue really didn’t feel like dealing with this crazy narcissist.

Seeing that she was about to leave, the Great Elf King couldn't help but say with a sigh, “You were born with a passable face, but it’s a pity that you’re blind.”

“Blind?” Qiao Xueying repeated, stunned.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Otherwise, why would she be indifferent toward my stunning appearance? If she isn’t blind, she definitely can’t be a woman,” the Great Elf King quickly replied.

Qiao Xueying was speechless. She found it a bit hard to handle her crazily narcissistic dad and shot back, “Maybe it’s because she’s seen a man who’s more handsome than a certain someone that she’s acting like that?”

“How could that be? In this world, whose looks can compare to mine?” the Great Elf King exclaimed furiously.

Qiao Xueying harrumphed, then didn’t feel like paying him any more attention. She reflexively glanced toward Zu An, who was on the elevated stage. A hint of pride appeared on her beautiful complexion.

“So it was him,” the Great Elf King harrumphed. “You’re just in your honeymoon phase. As a father, I’ll just forgive you. Right, once things are finished, you should go back to the Elf King Manor. I’ve already arranged for a few elders to personally instruct you on how to deal with the clan’s affairs. You know that I was locked up in the Imperial Prison for a period of time, and too many things have accumulated in the clan. Recently, the Empress Dowager has massively promoted the Elf race, so we need someone to take care of all those things now.”

“Isn’t that your work? Why aren’t you doing it?” Qiao Xueying asked nervously.

She still had to find her sweetheart afterward. It was one thing when he had been on the human side, and she could only think about him due to the physical distance. But now, he had finally come all the way to the Fiend race territory, and yet the two still rarely spent time together!

The Great Elf King proudly raised his chin and replied, “These complicated matters are too much work; it’ll damage my perfect skin and accelerate my aging. I naturally need to leave them to you.”

Qiao Xueying looked wronged, protesting, “Excuse me, are you not worried about the same thing happening to me?”

“You’re still young, so it’s fine,” the Great Elf King replied, waving his hand. However, when he saw her pouting, seemingly really unwilling, he changed the subject. “Do you really like that kid?”

“Isn’t that a rhetorical question? If I didn’t like him, would I give him half my lifespan?” Qiao Xueying asked, looking at him as if she were looking at an idiot.

The Great Elf King didn’t get upset as he replied, “Then there’s even more of a reason for you to do these things.”

“Why?” Qiao Xueying asked, sounding completely confused.

The Great Elf King’s expression wasn’t as frivolous as before, but instead filled with a wise air as he replied, “From what I know, that brat always has a lot of women around him, and they’re all the world’s most powerful individuals. The Medusa Queen, the White Jade Sect’s inheritor, the Devil Sect’s saintess, the Ocean races’ Mermaid Princess, even the Demon races’ princess… In terms of beauty, none of them are inferior to you, and those people all have powerful forces behind them. At the same time, because of their status, their experience and skills absolutely aren’t something a naive young lady like you can compare to. Won’t you be completely swallowed up by those women at this rate?

“Additionally, from my perspective, that White Jade Sect Master Yan and Devil Sect Master Yun both seem to carry more than just a positive impression of that kid. If you don’t accumulate some skills and experience, how will you fight them?”

Qiao Xueying rolled her eyes, retorting, “Are you crazy? They’re Chu Chuyan and Qiu Honglei’s masters. Why would they like their own disciples’ man?” She sneered. “Whatever.”

She just assumed her narcissistic dad was being dumb again. Still, even though she didn’t believe that the two seniors would like Zu An, she still acknowledged her father’s advice. She felt that she had to deal with the Elf race’s affairs to raise her own personal skills, as well as to prepare for the future.

…

Even after the coronation ceremony ended, the Second Empress had many things to take care of. Zu An couldn't seek her out during the day, as a result.

Yu Yanluo planned to establish a new office in the Fiend King Court for the Snake race. The Second Empress had granted them a new residence and several other awards. There were many things that the two of them, as master and servant, had to take care of.

Apart from that, her gains in matters of cultivation had been great too. She had received all kinds of insights, which she needed to slowly digest in seclusion to break through into the master rank. Because she had the Holy Pearl and her bloodline talent, together with the Boulder Topaz precious to earth element cultivators that Zu An had given her, there was no risk at all for her breakthrough this time. She didn’t even need anyone else to watch over her.

…

Yan Xuehen had disappeared off to who knew where, and Zu An didn’t know where Yun Jianyue was either. Qiao Xueying had also left in a hurry…

He looked around and saw that everyone had left, so he decided that it would be best to return to the Imperial Palace. When he arrived, he withdrew a batch of goods from the treasury. He had always been worried about his Tai’e Sword being damaged; as he had some free time now, it was the perfect time to fix it.

Previously, the Rune Weapon Chart had unlocked the Forging System. It allowed him to repair weapons, but he needed all sorts of materials. In the past, it might have been a bit difficult, but with his current status and authority, the materials issue had suddenly become extremely easy to solve.

He had mentioned it in passing to the Second Empress the previous night. The Second Empress was already completely submissive and obedient by that point, simply giving him her token. Together with his status as the Regent, none of the guards of the treasury had dared to stop him.

When he returned to his room, Zu An was a bit excited. His rewards this time were a bit unexpected.

First off, he had a large batch of heaven-grade ores. That was the bare minimum for repairing heaven-grade weapons. Furthermore, he even had eleven Meteor Spark Pills. Such items were extremely precious, and they were all the Fiend Races Imperial Palace had in their treasury. The pills weren’t for people to eat, but rather, were used to forge weapons.

He planned to use up the Calamity Gold he had gotten from the Jade Garden rock betting game to increase the Tai’e Sword’s grade too. However, for something like Calamity Gold, not even true fire was guaranteed to be able to melt it. The Meteor Spark Pills were needed as supplementary materials. Such pills could greatly increase the power of all kinds of fire. At the same time, rather than being explosive, they uniformly distributed the fire, greatly increasing the success rate of the process.

The previous night, when the Second Empress heard what Zu An was thinking, she had felt that using up Calamity Gold on a heaven-grade weapon wasn’t really worth it. Zu An didn’t think so, however. The Tai’e Sword had a special meaning to him. As he had managed to actually get some Calamity Gold this time, he would naturally have a chance to obtain other exceptional metals in the future too.

Seeing how he had already made his decision, the Second Empress didn’t say anything else. They had quickly entered another round of crazy ups and downs again.

However, whether it was the large batch of heaven-grade ores or the precious Meteor Spark Pills, they weren’t really why Zu An was excited.

What he was most excited about was that he had found the Agate of Enlightenment, one of the three divine objects Mi Li had said she needed to reconstruct her body!
