Chapter 134: They Are My Wife and Children Now!

Translator: Pika

Zu An immediately used the fake Sunflower Phantasm to dodge to the side, successfully surviving Mei Chaofeng’s first strike.

Unfortunately, Mei Chaofeng had seen his movement skill the other day too, so he knew how to overcome it as well. With a cold harrumph, he hurled another punch over, but this time, he made sure to seal off Zu An’s path of escape.

Cornered, Zu An had no choice but to use the real Sunflower Phantasm to dodge this strike. While evading the attack, he cried aloud, “Gorgeous Principal Jiang, I know my mistakes now! Save me! If I die here, there won’t be anyone to help you take over the Plum Blossom Sect!”

“Hm?” Mei Chaofeng had no idea how Zu An managed to dodge his attack at all. Perplexed, he hurriedly tried to follow up with another attack, only to recoil in shock in the next moment.

A woman had suddenly appeared right in front of Zu An.

Her long beautiful legs were as attractive as ever, but Mei Chaofeng’s attention was captured by the pencil she was holding in her hand. “P-Principal Jiang!”

Zu An heaved a sigh of relief. “Principal Jiang, you’re finally willing to come out!”

“Didn’t you say that someone who is in a position of power like you and need not lift a finger at all? What a wonder it is for me to spot you in such a terrible position, isn’t it? Hm?” remarked Jiang Luofu with an enigmatic smile.

“Hahaha, my useless mouth just can’t help but brag. Don’t mind it too much!” Zu An laughed it off sheepishly. This woman sure is narrow-minded. She actually got offended by those remarks.

“I heard that you’re intending to mooch off me too?” However, Jiang Luofu wasn’t intending on letting him off the hook so easily.

“Of course I am!” replied Zu An matter-of-factly.

“What did you say?” Jiang Luofu frowned.

“I mean, I haven’t managed to mooch off you yet.” Zu An quickly changed his words. “Hey, Mei Chaofeng is getting away!”

While the two of them were chattering off, Mei Chaofeng immediately sprinted off with all his might. From the moment Jiang Luofu appeared before his eyes, he had already realized that there was no way he would be able to kill Zu An anymore. In fact, under normal circumstances, he would have already been a goner, but by a stroke of luck, she ended up getting distracted, creating an opening for him to escape.

Jiang Luofu raised her head calmly before casually swiping the pencil in her hand across the air with a cold harrumph.

Mei Chaofeng felt a chilling sensation on his legs before abruptly tumbling forward.

“What happened?”

Bewildered by this mystifying situation, he turned around to take a look, only to see his legs standing upright on the ground several meters behind him. Then, he lowered his head to take a look at himself and saw that half of his legs had been amputated. It was also then that the pain finally started setting in, and he let out of a shriek of agony.

Zu An gulped. He secretly glanced at Jiang Luofu’s side profile as he quietly patted his chest in relief.

Holy shit! I didn’t know she was this strong! If she really held a grudge against me for all of the remarks I’ve made, wouldn’t I have already died several times by now?

Just look at what happened to Mei Chaofeng!

Ah, but again, he isn’t as good-looking as I am. It might just be the disparity in our looks.

“I’ll leave the rest to you.” Jiang Luofu couldn’t even be bothered to talk to Mei Chaofeng. She took a seat in the gazebo and naturally rested her legs on the bench.

Zu An walked over to Mei Chaofeng’s side gleefully and gazed down at him from above, “You thought that it was just me, but Principal Jiang is here too! Are you surprised?”

“...” Mei Chaofeng.

He would have never known that the tables would be turned on him so quickly. The words that he had just spoken were returned to him right away.

“You son of a bitch! What are you acting so smug for? You’re nothing more than a weakling who relies on women!” Mei Chaofeng gritted his teeth furiously.

Zu An sighed deeply and said, “Don’t you think that it takes true skills to be able to tap into the strength of others?”

“How could you possibly be able to get Principal Jiang’s help? This is impossible...” murmured Mei Chaofeng in disbelief. He couldn’t accept how things had turned out.

“This is the privilege entitled to good-looking people like me. Hideous beings like you will never understand it.” Zu An looked at Mei Chaofeng in pity.

“...” Mei Chaofeng.

Zu An took a step sideward to dodge the blood spurting out of Mei Chaofeng’s wounds due to his emotions getting the better of him.

Wow. The people in this world sure are tenacious like cockroaches. Even in such a state, he still hasn’t fainted yet.

“This reminds me of my encounter with Plum Blossom Twelve. He also persevered for a very long time before he finally collapsed,” remarked Zu An cheerily.

“You were indeed the one who killed Twelve!” Mei Chaofeng glared at Zu An furiously. Just thinking about how he had the tables turned on him yesterday despite having spoken the truth made blood rush to his head in a fit of anger.

Zu An walked up to Mei Chaofeng and squatted down in front of him. “Plum Blossom Twelve tried to kill me, so I returned the favor to him. It’s justified self-defense. Now that I’ve satisfied your curiosity, it’s time for you to spill the beans. Tell me where your accounting book and assets are. And not to forget, your connections with other officials, your supply routes, and all of the vital information concerning your businesses.”

Mei Chaofeng had chosen to lie down on the ground, seemingly having accepted his fate. Nevertheless, Zu An’s words still made him laugh in ridicule, “Just how foolish do you think I am to tell you all of those?”

“Don’t you know that being able to die an easy death is a blessing as well?” Zu An sighed deeply as he gazed down at Mei Chaofeng with eyes filled with sympathy.

“Hmph! Try your worst then! I won’t be a man if I even let out even a squeak!” The Plum Blossom Sect had tortured innumerable people over the years for information, so Mei Chaofeng was familiar with how interrogation worked.

“It looks like people in this world really do lack imagination. Well, let me educate you a little.” Zu An moved a boulder from the side over and settled himself down on it, reminiscent of a bard getting into a comfortable position for a long story.

“You should have heard about how eels and loaches dive into any holes that they see, right? If I strip you bare and throw into a barrel filled with eels and loaches, where do you think they’ll head into?

“If that isn’t enough for you to talk, we could have you buried into the ground, revealing only just your head. I’d slice the skin at the top of your head and pour mercury in. Before long, you’ll find yourself itching from head to toe. It would be so unbearable that you would be wiggling desperately, hoping to alleviate the itch, but of course, what could you do when you’re stuck in the ground with nowhere to go. Eventually, you’re left with no choice but to dive out, tearing your skin out of your body. Hmmm, would a person without skin start bleeding profusely? I guess we could put that to the test.”

...

Those bizarre torture methods made even Jiang Luofu’s heart skip a beat. Where in the world did someone as young as him learn of all of these vicious means? Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Brat, kill me if you want to! There’s no use talking such crap with me!” Despite Mei Chaofeng’s words of bravado, his quivering voice gave his fear away. He suddenly felt that the Plum Blossom Sect didn’t look that vile anymore compared to the great villain standing before him.

“I’m not done yet. Based on what I know, you fooled around with quite a few women over the years. You don’t harbor any feelings for most of them, but it seems there’s an exception. If my memory fails me not, there’s a woman living in the northern part of the city who goes by the name of Wang Cuihua. She bore twins for you, did she? Ahh, it must be relieving for you to depart with the knowledge that your blood continues to exist in this world even after your death,” remarked Zu An with a smile.

Mei Chaofeng’s eyes immediately reddened. He quickly turned to Jiang Luofu and roared anxiously, “Principal Jiang, is the academy going to condone such actions? ‘Never bring one’s family into the picture’—that’s a rule that even those in the underworld like us observe!”

Before Jiang Luofu could respond, Zu An had already cut right in. “Who says that I’m going to harm them? I just want to reassure you that you don’t have to worry about them after your death. I’ll make sure to take good care of your wife and raise your children as if my own. Ah, I should probably call them my wife and my children now.”

“You!!!” Mei Chaofeng was so angry that he wanted to lurch at Zu An to tear his head off, but Jiang Luofu’s earlier strike had severed his ki meridians as well, leaving him utterly powerless at the moment.

“Have you thought it through yet?” asked Zu An. “Do you want to just get it over and done with, or do you want to first suffer a little first before finally caving in to my demands? I don’t particularly mind it either way.”

Why in the hell did I get myself involved with this demon!

Mei Chaofeng began sobbing sorrowfully. He was intending to grit his teeth through Zu An’s torture and die a valiant death, but he wasn’t even given that option at all. He knew deep down that he would never toil through the tortures Zu An spoke of, not to mention that the latter was even holding his wife and children as hostages against him.

This wasn’t even a choice at all.

“There are two accounting books for the Plum Blossom Sect. One of them is in the secret chamber in my study room, and the other one is located in a secret compartment in my bedroom...”

Mei Chaofeng stared numbly at the blue sky above him as he monotonously revealed everything regarding the Plum Blossom Sect.

“Fucking Zu An, you’ll die a horrible death!” Mei Chaofeng cursed with gritted teeth. He could already feel himself coming closer to death’s embrace as blood continued to flow out of his legs.

Zu An smiled in response, “My apologies, but according to my wife, good people tend to die prematurely whereas vermins plague the world for centuries. It looks like I still have hundreds of years ahead of me.”

Pu~

Unable to take it anymore, Mei Chaofeng spurted a mouthful of blood.

Just like that, the powerhouse who had ruled Brightmoon City’s underworld for decades was angered to death. Even in his dying breath, his eyes continued to glower in indignation.

Zu An rushed over to the gazebo and exclaimed excitedly, “Gorgeous principal, I’ve accomplished my mission perfectly!”

Jiang Luofu looked at Zu An with a conflicted gaze. “It must be agonizing to be your enemy.”

Zu An flashed her an innocent smile in response, saying, “I’m also glad that you’re a friend too.”

Jiang Luofu harrumphed softly before rising to her feet. “Let’s go, I’ll get someone to clean up this area afterward. As for the takeover of the Plum Blossom Sect later on, I’ll send someone over to help you with it later on.”

“You can leave it to me!” Zu An patted his chest as he gave his guarantee.

Just like that, the two of them returned to the academy.

...

Two hours later, Shi Kun finally heard of the news and ended up dropping his cup onto the floor. “Mei Chaofeng is dead? How can that be possible?”

Shi Lezhi replied grimly, “I’ve verified it personally. There’s no doubt about it.”

“This doesn’t make sense. Mei Chaofeng is a pinnacle fifth rank cultivator, so killing Zu An should have been a walk in the park for him. How could he have failed?” Shi Kun couldn’t understand what was going on.

Snow remarked softly by the side, “Young master, someone spotted Zu An returning back to the academy together with Principal Jiang.”

“Jiang Luofu? Are you saying that she’s working with Zu An now?” Shi Kun was appalled. Jiang Luofu’s cultivation and standing made her a dangerous enemy. He would think twice whether he really had the means to deal with her right now.

“It should just be a coincidence. Mei Chaofeng might have just been unlucky to bump into her,” remarked Shi Lezhi. Not even in his wildest imagination could he fathom any sort of relationship between Zu An and Jiang Luofu.

Shi Kun also shared the same thoughts too. “Goddamnit! Why does that scoundrel have such good luck?”

This was not the first trap he had laid for Zu An, but the latter was able to overcome them every single time.

“Young master, the Ursae Dungeon will be opening three days from now. No one will know if we make a move against him there. I’ll make a move personally then to destroy him for good!” said Snow.

Shi Kun nodded in agreement. “That’s the best we can do for now. I’ll bring in a batch of people into the dungeon to aid you.”

As Zu An got stronger, the threat he posed would become greater as well. Every night that passed, there was a chance that the woman he had set his eyes upon could lose her chastity. This was not something he could accept.
