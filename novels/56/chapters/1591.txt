Chapter 1540: Not Even an Immortal Can Save You Now

“What do you mean?” Zheng Dan asked, although she naturally knew what he was saying. She only pretended otherwise because she was secretly gauging the distance between them to see if there was a suitable opportunity for a surprise attack.

Even though Yi Zhibing’s character was rotten, and his aptitude seemed low, he had quite the providing father. He had definitely gotten access to more cultivation resources than Zheng Dan had been able to obtain in a more rural location. Meanwhile, even though Sang Qien’s father had a high rank, as an honest official, he hadn’t been able to provide her with a sea of cultivation resources either. Because of that, the difference between their cultivation wasn’t all that great. If Zheng Dan couldn't restrain him immediately, that would end up startling the bailiffs outside. She wouldn’t get a second chance then.

“Madam is an intelligent person. Do you really still not know what I’m getting at?” Yi Zhibing replied, greedily admiring Zheng Dan’s body. “The Sang clan’s safety rests on just a single thought from the madam. As long as I’m happy, I can pretend this proof doesn’t exist. The Sang clan will naturally be safe then. Also, your clan back in Brightmoon City won’t be involved either. Otherwise…” He didn’t finish his sentence, but his threatening intent was evident.

“That was clearly something you forged. Even if this issue is dealt with, you can use the same method to frame us again,” Zheng Dan said coldly. At the same time, she gave Sang Qien a look, hinting for them to both take action together.

“Heh, madam really is smart,” Yi Zhibing said, his smile fading. He continued coldly “I won’t waste any more time with you. As long as the madam can please me, nothing will happen to the Sang or Zheng clans.” He was like a knife, and they were like fish on a chopping board. He wasn’t scared of being direct.

In the past, Sang Qian had been incredibly proud and arrogant, and had bullied Yi Zhibing. Unfortunately, Sang Qian’s cultivation had been higher than Yi Zhibing’s at the time, so he couldn't even get revenge. He had thought he’d never get another chance, and yet the heavens seemed to pity him today! This time, they had placed the Sang clan’s fate in his hands.

Sang Qian had died, so Yi Zhibing couldn't get revenge on him anymore, but he could still get revenge on the other man’s wonderful wife! What other revenge could bring one more joy than dominating and firing crazily into the wife of one’s enemy?

On top of that, a single wife wasn’t enough to satisfy Yi Zhibing. He even set his eyes on Sang Qian’s little sister. Still, considering how she was still a distinguished daughter who hadn’t married yet, she could end up reacting too strongly if he forced her, keeping him from achieving his objective.

As such, he didn’t show any desire for Sang Qien at first. He only focused his thoughts on Zheng Dan for the time being. Even though her husband had died as soon as she got married, she was someone who had gotten married before. She wouldn’t have as much resistance toward such a thing as an unmarried woman. If he obtained her, the Sang clan’s reaction wouldn’t be as strong as before. Then, as he would frequently come and go from the Sang Manor, wouldn’t getting to Sang Qien be easy enough?

Just the thought of having both in bed made his blood boil. It would be even better if Sang Hong’s spirit could watch that happen! Wouldn’t his revenge be the best thing in the world then? His excitement made his entire body feel as if it were about to burst.

Zheng Dan’s gaze turned cold as she thought, The time is now! Just like that, she moved swiftly to attack!

Yi Zhibing was alarmed. He hadn’t expected a classical beauty like Zheng Dan to actually be so experienced. Whether it was in terms of her timing or her fighting experience, she was comparable to someone from the world of warriors.

Yi Zhibing was forced to go on the defensive while dodging to one side. However, his feet felt a bit sluggish. As it turned out, Sang Qien had flung out a ribbon and wrapped it around his ankles, causing him to stagger. He cursed inwardly. I did want the two of them together, but not like this!

The two women were fully experienced in combat. They weren’t like unmarried noble daughters in the slightest! They were more like veterans from the battlefield! Yi Zhibing was caught unprepared, so how could he retaliate at all?

Zheng Dan was happy to see the result, and tried to strike Yi Zhibing’s throat to restrain him. However, a flash of blue light appeared from his body, blowing the two women back. Next, The bailiffs outside heard the activity and rushed in. The one in front was none other than the head constable. He stood in front of Yi Zhibing and stared both women down.

Zheng Dan and Sang Qien’s faces were pale. They knew they had missed their best opportunity. Things would be difficult now.

Yi Zhibing stood up. He looked as if he had just recovered from shock. He took out a pendant from around his waist, saying, “Thank goodness I had this pendant my dad bought at a high price. It can even stop the attack of a master rank cultivator! You two brats can’t do a thing to me.”

A hint of despair appeared in Zheng Dan and Sang Qien’s eyes. Such a treasure made Yi Zhibing practically invincible. What else could they do?

Just then, Yi Zhibing’s expression contorted and he spat, “Fine, seeing as you didn’t want to listen while I was talking nicely, you leave this young master with no choice but to use force. Men, remove all their clothing for me!”

The head constable couldn't help but frown, asking, “Young master, isn’t that a bit inappropriate?”

“What’s inappropriate? The Sang clan is already done for, and sooner or later, they’ll be thrown into the government brothel. We brothers might as well enjoy them for ourselves first,” Yi Zhibing replied, his mind overcome with lust. To think that mere moments before, he had almost been done in!

The bailiffs’ eyes all turned red with lust when they heard him. Many of them threw themselves at the women like wolves.

However, some bailiffs looked at each other in dismay. They found such behavior a bit hard to accept. Still, they didn’t dare to stand in young master Yi’s way. The only thing they could do was choose not to participate.

When she saw the men move toward them, Zheng Dan stood in front of Sang Qien, fending them off one after another.With her cultivation, how could they harm her at all? Still, there were just too many of them, so the situation soon reached a stalemate.

Yi Zhibing’s expression became a bit unpleasant. He hadn’t sent his men at the women out of kindness, but rather because he knew the women’s cultivation was high. Even he wouldn’t be able to deal with them, so he sent out his subordinates to wear them out first. However, from the looks of it, there was no way to capture the two quickly. Thus, he looked at the bailiff next to him and said, “Brother Wang, I’ll need your help.”

The bailiff frowned slightly, clearly unwilling to join in. However, Yi Zhibing said, “What’s our mission this time? These two women are resisting arrest right now, and furthermore, they’ve injured quite a few of the bailiffs. We won’t be able to handle the responsibility if we let any of them escape!”

That bailiff frowned when he heard that, but he finally moved. He reached out toward the two women, and a metal glove that flickered with light suddenly appeared on his hand. When it made contact with the metal glove, Zheng Dan’s dagger immediately broke into several pieces.

Yi Zhibing smiled. Bailiff Wang had had a miraculous encounter in his earlier years and obtained an earth-grade weapon; it was considered particularly formidable within the earth-grade. As such, even though his individual cultivation wasn’t too stunning in the capital, he had been able to rely on his glove; his name had thus left countless criminals terror-stricken. Compared to that, these two dainty women weren’t much at all.

Sure enough, after a few moves, the situation soon turned critical for the weaponless Zheng Dan and Sang Qien. Eventually, while they were evading, they accidentally tripped on a fallen chair, revealing a huge opening as they staggered.

How could Bailiff Wang miss out on such a great opportunity? His fingers immediately turned into chains that wrapped around their bodies. In all his years, those who were restrained by his iron glove became powerless, unable to resist further.

Despair appeared in the two women’s eyes, as they had just seen Yi Zhibing’s despicable and shameless nature. They knew that if they fell into his hands, they would meet a horrible end.

Suddenly, a streak of sword light flashed past them, cutting the long chains into several pieces. A tall and slender figure appeared at their side and carefully supported them, asking, “Are you two alright?”

“Ah Zu!” Zheng Dan exclaimed, recognizing the face she  yearned for day and night. Her eyes became a bit wet as she threw herself into his arms enthusiastically.

Sang Qien was shocked and happy. However, her relationship with Zu An was very awkward. They were clearly so familiar with each other that they knew every inch of each other’s body, and yet their relationship was actually a bit estranged. As such, she was comparatively more restrained.

Meanwhile, Bailiff Wang was shocked. When he saw that the fingers had been cut off from his iron glove, even though Zu An had his back turned, he still didn’t dare to do anything.

Yi Zhibing recognized Zu An and exclaimed, “Wow, who do we have here? Isn’t this the human traitor who colluded with the Fiend Races?!” In the past, he had suffered quite badly along with Yu Nan when they competed over a courtesan queen. Zu An’s face remained fresh in his memory.

Zu An supported both women as he looked around. When he saw the messy situation, his expression darkened and he said, “So you were the ones who did this.”

“And so what if we were? The Sang clan has committed a huge crime, and we came on orders to investigate. I advise you to cooperate and wait to be captured. Otherwise, resisting arrest is a tremendous crime,” Yi Zhibing said with a sneer. This guy didn’t even have the slightest bit of ki aura. Had he ended up becoming crippled somewhere?

There’s no Bi Ziang to stand up for you this time. Just watch as I deal with you properly, he thought as he waved his hand, gesturing for his subordinates to capture the man.

The bailiffs had all thought that they would be able to enjoy two charming beauties, and yet now, things were suddenly incredibly complicated. They had been frustrated and annoyed to begin with, so they didn’t see what had just happened clearly at all. When they received the signal, they charged with a roar, their eyes filled with lust and desire.

“No, don’t!” Bailiff Wang yelled, horrified. He tried to stop them, but it was already too late.

Zu An waved his hand, and a streak of sword energy hacked outward. A streak of bloody mist appeared from the bailiffs' bodies, and they fell like broken sacks.

Yi Zhibing was shocked, but also happy. He exclaimed, “You actually publicly killed court officials? You’re finished! Not even an immortal can save you if they come for you! You’re done!”

Sang Qien and Zheng Dan couldn't help but look at Zu An worriedly. This was precisely the reason they had held back before: The Zhou Dynasty had always been extremely strict with their rules and laws. Even if one were wrongly accused, one had no choice but to go through the legal path of righting wrongs. Otherwise, practically anything would be a grave offense, let alone publicly killing court officials. That would be treated as a full-on rebellion!

However, Zu An didn’t pay Yi Zhibing any attention. Instead, he asked Zheng Dan just what exactly had happened. He had just returned to the capital, planning to first get some intelligence from the Sang Manor. And yet, as soon as he arrived, he had seen the mess that was taking place, putting the two women in a dangerous situation; he had been overtaken with fury. Only now did Zheng Dan give Zu An a rough account of what had happened to them.

When Yi Zhibing saw how close they were, he finally reacted and said, “Haha, the Sang clan has always been careful about their family matters, and yet their daughter-in-law was already colluding with an outsider! What were you still acting like a chaste woman in front of me for?!”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
