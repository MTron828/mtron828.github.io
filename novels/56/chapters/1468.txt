Chapter 1417: Red Eyes Deep Underwater

Zu An’s Fragrant Barf would make the target forget everything else and attack Zu An. It was a skill he normally didn’t dare to use willfully. However, he hadn’t expected that after he used it, the skill would be undone as soon as the monster died and came back to life.

After that, no matter how the group taunted it, the Yayu no longer took the bait, continuing to hide inside the Weak Water. Zu An even flew over the Weak Water several times, making it easier for it to attack him, but the Yayu wasn’t tempted at all.

All of them felt powerless. They looked at each other in dismay, wondering, “What do we do now?”

“Should we follow the river and see if we can make our way around the Weak Water?” Yu Yanluo suggested.

Yun Jianyue shook her head and said, “That won’t work. This Weak Water is definitely strange. It’ll probably just extend as we move, so we won’t be able to make our way around it.”

Yan Xuehen actually agreed with Yun Jianyue. She added, “Additionally, this is the first trial Shun mentioned. If we do not solve it, it will be meaningless even if we do make a detour around this place.”

Zu An asked seriously, “Why do you think it can revive endlessly?”

Yan Xuehen thought for a bit before saying, “It does not seem like a normal creature to me. It might be an incarnation of this Weak Water’s essence.”

“Are you really going to make such a ridiculous assumption? Based on what you’re saying, if we can’t get rid of this Weak Water, we can’t deal with this monster?” Yun Jianyue replied doubtfully. “I think dealing with the Weak Water would be countless times harder than dealing with this monster. There’s no reason to try to solve an easier problem with a more difficult solution.”

Zu An said, “This Yayu definitely isn’t a living object. I used the Poisonous Prick, but there was no reaction. It’s clearly not a living thing. It’s more likely to be a departed spirit of some sort.”

“You’re right. I could sense strong resentment coming from it when we fought earlier,” Yun Jianyue said with a frown. “Why do we keep running into these things filled with resentment? That Taowu from earlier was also like this.”

Yu Yanluo cried out in alarm, “Then doesn’t that mean the Taowu can also revive endlessly?”

“That might not be the case. Even though both are full of resentment, the feeling they give off is a bit different,” Yan Xuehen said. “The Taowu is already at the earth immortal rank, so killing it is extremely difficult. However, if it is killed, it will not be easy for it to revive either. Earth immortals are all connected to the natural laws of the world. The amount of natural ki they need is much greater. If they could revive endlessly, this world would be unable to support it.”

Zu An thought for a moment before saying, “According to what Shun said before, the Taowu was a monster created after Gun’s death. This Yayu doesn’t seem like a reincarnation, though, but rather…” He paused, thinking for a while before coming up with a suitable description, “...something like a mutated zombie.”

Yan Xuehen was stunned. She quickly said, “You are right. I could sense what you are describing too. There was a corpse-like energy emanating from its body. No wonder we were unable to eliminate it after all this time.”

“It looks quite agile, though. It’s completely different from the zombies we’ve encountered before,” Yu Yanluo said with a frown.

With their cultivation and identity, they had naturally encountered such sinister creatures before. Even though they were physically powerful, they were often lacking in intelligence, so they weren’t too hard to deal with. Just then, however, the Yayu had behaved extremely intelligently, to the extent that it could see through the traps they had set up. It just stayed in the Weak Water without coming out no matter what.

“Regardless, this is a breakthrough,” Yun Jianyue said excitedly. “Stone cold woman, do you have any peach wood swords or black dog blood, or anything like that?”

“Why would I have those things on me?” Yan Xuehen asked, stunned.

“Your White Jade Sect is a daoist sect. Aren't those weird talismans and exorcism rituals things you like to do?” Yun Jianyue replied, as if that were just how things were.

Yan Xuehen was speechless. She eventually replied, “You are a glorious grandmaster, so why do you believe such things like some countryside woman?”VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“The daoist sects can’t even do something like that? Sigh…” Yun Jianyue replied bitterly.

Yan Xuehen furrowed her brows and snapped, “Witch, are you really picking a fight with me right now?”

Yu Yanluo was starting to get a headache. These two really never stopped fighting! She quickly said, “Since it is a corpse, why not usse fire to see if we can restrain it?”

Yan Xuehen shook her head and said, “Normal zombies might fear fire, but at the Yayu’s level, it likely does not fear water or fire.”

“Normal fire wouldn’t work, but what about that White Lotus Flame Little An got not too long ago?” Yun Jianyue replied.

Yan Xuehen didn’t reject the proposal, saying, “That is worth a try.”

Zu An thought for a bit. I do specialize in getting rid of ghosts, but I don’t know if it’s effective on zombies…

Then, however, they came back to the question of how to draw out the Yayu. Zu An said, “Since it's too scared to come out, I’ll go down to find it!”

The three women immediately blurted out at the same time, “No, it’s too dangerous!”

“It’s actually not that dangerous,” Zu An said while thinking to himself. “The scariest part of the Weak Water is that we don’t know much about it. However, I already went into the water earlier, and I’ve seen how powerful it is. I’m already mentally prepared for it.”

“According to what you said earlier, though, you become incredibly heavy as soon as your body enters the Weak Water. How will you come back up?” Yan Xuehen asked worriedly.

Zu An looked at the fiery red waistband tied around her waist and replied, “Don’t we have that? We already tested it out and saw that the Weak Water’s corrosion was ineffective against the Primal Skysilk. Besides, the Primal Skysilk can lengthen and contract, so if there are any issues, you can just pull me up.”

The three women actually felt that the plan was feasible when they heard Zu An’s idea. They weren’t girls raised in pampered chambers. They knew they couldn't just be trapped like this and that some risk was acceptable.

Yun Jianyue shoved the Empress Lantern into Zu An’s hands, saying, “Little An, you probably don’t know how to use the Crescent Ring, so just take this with you. It might not be enough to stop theYayu, but it can at least restrict its movements to some degree.”

Almost at the same time, Yan Xuehen gave him her Flying Snow Sword and said, “This sword can be used to unleash the Snowflake Sword with greater efficacy. You will be able to use ice powers more easily underwater.”

The two women were stunned when they saw each other’s actions. Whether it was the Empress Lantern or the Flying Snow Sword, each was respectively their most precious treasure and never left their bodies. Who would have thought that one day they would both be lent out, and furthermore to the same man? Still, both of them understood the severity of the issue at hand, so they didn’t bicker for once.

Zu An was a bit stunned, but he didn’t act pretentiously. He took the items and said, “Thank you, big sisters.”

Yu Yanluo also walked over, then got on her toes and kissed him. When their lips separated, there was a smooth and cool pearl in Zu An’s mouth.

“Carry the Holy Pearl with you. It contains endless power. I hope it can protect you,” Yu Yanluo said, blushing as they separated. Even though others called it Lord Sui’s Pearl, as a Snake race descendant, she still liked the name Holy Pearl more.

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen’s eyes both widened when they saw how forward Yu Yanluo was being. However, both of them had been saved by the pearl back on Feather Mountain, so they quickly realized what she was doing.

Even so, Yun Jianyue still couldn't help but mutter, “Look at these two, showing so much public affection.”

Yan Xuehen’s beautiful brows furrowed slightly. She thought to herself, Why are you acting all intimate in front of us on purpose? Are you asserting your importance as his main partner or something?

However, she quickly stopped worrying about that, telling herself that it had nothing to do with her. When had she become filled with random thoughts, just like some simple-minded young woman?

After a while, she tied the Primal Skysilk around Zu An’s body. Yun Jianyue couldn't help but chuckle, saying, “You actually made our Goddess Yan undress three times. Little An, you really are the first one to do something like that.”

Yan Xuehen had already recovered her composure after being provoked by Yun Jianyue repeatedly. She retorted, “If you were asked to undress to save him, could it be that you would refuse?”

Yun Jianyue was suddenly at a loss for words. If she said she wouldn’t, then that would affect her relationship with Zu An, and she would be lying to herself. As for admitting it… That was even more impossible for her. When had this stone cold woman become so clever and eloquent?

Zu An obviously wouldn’t be so senseless as to get involved in their dispute. He gave the three women a signal, then jumped into the water. Sure enough, he felt his body becoming incredibly heavy as he went down. He quickly sank downward, and the light around him became visibly dimmer.

Just then, two giant red eyes suddenly lit up in the distance.
