Chapter 1724: Primordial Spirit Appearance

Zhao Han’s expression was ice-cold. When he raised his hand, streaks of black runes were faintly visible on it. He said, “These shamans’ strange skills do have something to them after all. It seems I underestimated you. However, if you really believe that this is enough to deal with this emperor, you are far too naive.” As soon as he spoke, two streaks of golden light suddenly fired from his eyes. They were so fast that the others couldn't even react at all.

Wu Wuyan was engulfed by the golden light and shrieked in pain. Her body began to burn at a visible rate. Her flesh and blood were almost instantly burned up, leaving behind only a skeleton. Then, in a gust of wind, her corpse turned to ashes and blew away without a trace.

The conspirators on Golden Peak shivered. In contrast, the Right Guard General Guo Zhi’s Imperial Guards and the remaining Embroidered Envoys got a morale boost. Earlier, Eunuch Wen and Zhuxie Chixin’s deaths had made them lose all confidence. It was to the extent that they had even begun to doubt their invincible emperor for the first time. But in that instant, they all knew that his majesty was still his majesty. No one could rival his might. As long as they followed him, they would inevitably achieve the ultimate victory.

Elder Xuan Dou and the other daoist experts immediately felt a lot more pressure. Even though their individual strength exceeded that of the Imperial Guards and Embroidered Envoys, their opponents were good at coordinated attacks using ingenious formations, resulting in the two sides being evenly matched. Now that the other side’s morale had increased, their own side was at a disadvantage.

“Amitabha buddha!” Master Jian Huang exclaimed in shock and anger. He created a giant 卍 symbol and sent it at Zhao Han. In truth, he had begun preparing his move when Zhao Han attacked Wu Wuyan, but he was still a bit too slow. That was why it seemed as if he had started reacting afterward.

The 卍 symbol grew larger and larger, eventually weighing down on Zhao Han like a mountain. Even the officials at Guidance Palace stopped and looked at Golden Peak. Even though they were blocked by the mountain defense formation and couldn't see what was happening up there, they could sense a terrifying pressure. It was as if all of Violet Mountain would be crushed beneath it.

Zhao Han snorted. Suddenly, a golden figure flew out from behind his head. It looked exactly like him, except it was much larger. It rapidly grew in size, almost instantly becoming as large as the 卍 symbol. With a mere wave of its hand, the terrifying symbol was smashed apart.

“He separated his primordial spirit from his body!” Master Jian Huang cried as he coughed out blood, dyeing his white beard red.

Just then, the giant golden figure sent a palm pressing down that seemed to cover everything. Master Jian Huang could no longer see anything else; there was only that giant palm left. It was as if everything in the world had disappeared. As the leader of a Buddhist sect, he naturally had exceptional cultivation and skills. But in that moment, he was shocked to discover that he couldn't retaliate in the slightest! He could only watch as the golden palm crashed down on him.

He realized something. A battle at the primordial spirit level could completely break through the various domains and principles of the world, unless he also cultivated a primordial spirit. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even have the qualifications to resist. He felt incredibly sullen. He had several trump cards and had thought he was only a hair behind the emperor in terms of strength. However, that hair was actually as wide as a heavenly moat. He couldn't use any of his trump cards and was facing death.

Just then, King Qi shouted. Then, a golden figure also flew out from the top of his head. A magnified version of King Qi brandished his fist at Zhao Han. Zhao Han’s primordial spirit frowned; he could only turn around and block.

A terrifying ripple spread outward. Even the nearby Pure Yang Palace was submerged within its power and was directly blown to ashes.

This Pure Yang Palace was the most sacred place of the Righteous Sun Sect, a symbol of the sect. The most powerful of defense formations had definitely been set up there. Furthermore, it was also the place where Wang Wuxie had usually cultivated in seclusion. This was where he had absorbed the essence of the sun and moon and bathed in the benefits of violet ki. As such, the daoists had always considered it unlikely to ever be destroyed. And yet, before the blast waves of two earth immortal experts, it couldn't even hold on for a moment.

Li Changsheng and the other grandmasters’ expressions changed. They all took out their magical weapons to protect themselves. However, they were too close and didn’t have much confidence in stopping the power of a battle between earth immortals.

Just then, the long, drawn-out sound of a bell filled the air. Then, a giant bronze bell descended from above, covering all those on Golden Peak. When the terrifying energy made contact with the giant bell, it vibrated intensely and rang in tremendous waves.

Violet Mountain began to quake and rumble. Countless birds in the forest flew away in alarm. The officials stuck halfway up the mountain paled in fright. Those with higher cultivation ranks only felt their stomachs churn, while those with lower cultivations vomited blood and fainted on the spot. Guidance Palace also began making strange noises, with tiles and beams falling. No one dared to remain inside.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An and the women were researching how to pass through the mountain defense formation. When they saw what was happening, their expressions all changed.

Xie Daoyun had the lowest cultivation among them. Her face turned pale and her body rocked back and forth, and she seemed about to fall. However, Zu An quickly held her hand and infused a large amount of ki. Only that way could he protect her from any injuries.

A while later, the ringing that could make one’s blood vessels directly explode finally eased up a bit. Zu An’s expression was incredibly serious as he wondered, “What kind of a bell is that? Why is it so formidable?”

However, who could have thought that before he could even receive an answer, he felt a wave of faint killing intent? Zu An instinctively looked up and discovered that the other women were all glaring at him holding Xie Daoyun’s hand.

Xie Daoyun suddenly realized something and quickly pulled her hand back. Her pretty face was a bright pink. However, it only left Zu An in an even more awkward position.

Mi Li almost burst into laughter. She exclaimed, “This is great, this is great! How can the happy fate of a man with several partners be so easily enjoyed?”

Fortunately, Yan Xuehen spoke up to ease his awkwardness, saying, “That is most likely Tranquility Palace’s deity-grade weapon, the Tranquility Bell. It seems this scheme against the emperor runs quite deep, to the point that they will have to suffer terrifying consequences after being exposed. The fact that they brought out the Tranquility Bell means they already have no choice left.”

Yun Jianyue looked in the direction of Golden Palace and said, “It felt as if there were two earth immortal rank individuals fighting. That battle should already be nearing its climax.”

Qiu Honglei said weakly, “I’m a bit worried about whether this is a suitable time to go there… We might just end up getting in trouble…”

No one made fun of her, because what she said was indeed the truth.

Yun Jianyue asked seriously, “Stone cold woman, how much longer will it take for you to crack that formation?”

“It is unlikely that this great mountain defense formation can be completely undone in a short amount of time. However, if it is just to make a small door for us to pass through, then around an incense stick’s amount of time should be enough,” Yan Xuehen replied. She couldn't help but give Xie Daoyun a look. This girl really was a formation genius. Without her help, such a thing likely wouldn’t have been so easy.

Zu An said, “Let’s do that first then. We’ll see if there’s a suitable opportunity to cross over afterward.”

The women nodded, agreeing with his plan. After all, if there was a good opportunity up there and they missed out on it because they didn’t do anything, perhaps such a thing would never appear again.

On Golden Peak, a small and exquisite bell in Master Jian Huang’s hand spun frantically. The massive bell in the air was none other than its projection. With the protection of the bell, all those present on Golden Peak at least managed to keep their lives. Even the Imperial Guards and Embroidered Envoys were included. That couldn't be helped, because the daoists were tangled up with them and wouldn’t separate for some time, so he had to save them all.

King Qi staggered a bit. He was clearly not Zhao Han’s match.

When Master Jian Huang saw that, he chanted several Buddhist sutras. Then, a giant buddha suddenly appeared behind him, rushing into the clouds to fight against Zhao Han.
