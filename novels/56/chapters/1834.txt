Chapter 1783: Glare of Eternal Slumber

Where did that sword come from? Wasn’t the vice-leader holding off that big-chested woman? How could she still have time to attack me?

Could it be that the vice-leader was messing with me?

Only when he felt that familiar chilliness did he suddenly realize that it was the Chu woman.

Just how was she able to see? These two women really do work well together. No wonder they like the same man…

In that instant, countless thoughts passed through the scar-faced leader's mind. Then, he was lost to endless darkness. His headless corpse came crashing down. As cold energy entered his body, he had frozen into a statue; when he fell, he exploded into fragments.

The feminine vice-leader felt a blast of hot blood spray all over him. Then, he stopped being able to sense the leader's energy. It was obvious that the leader was already dead! He was horrified.

It really was ironic. Before this, he had wished for the leader’s death countless times, so as to replace him. And yet now, the leader had actually become his most reliable shield. When the vice-leader saw him die, he felt as if he had fallen into a frozen cellar. He hadn’t even felt so bad when his parents died in the past.

Unfortunately, he didn’t have too much time to think. Attacks surrounded him from all directions again.

So those two women were working together! But how could that Chu girl see?

Chu Chuyan naturally couldn't see anything. However, Pei Mianman constantly described the situation in her ear, and she just had to follow the directions.

It sounded easy, but it was extremely difficult to achieve. After all, they needed to have absolute trust. If the other person were to give the wrong direction on purpose, she could end up handing over her own life on a silver platter instead of striking the enemy.

When she sensed that Chu Chuyan was doing exactly what she said, Pei Mianman’s expression was extremely strange. She thought, Is this silly woman really not scared that I might harm her?

Hand in hand, their swords matched each other harmoniously as they attacked the vice-leader. Even though his cultivation was higher than both of theirs, he couldn't see, and the range of his divine sense was also extremely small. As such, he was completely left in a passive position. Soon after, one after another, wounds opened up on his body. As blood flowed from his body, he became weaker and weaker as well. He knew the situation couldn't continue. Otherwise, he would definitely die within an incense stick of time.

“Is there still anyone alive? All of you, come over to where I am, or else you’ll definitely die!” the vice-leader roared.

Unfortunately, it was completely silent. No one responded. There were no blood-curdling screams either. He felt his mind go completely cold as he realized that the Gray Wolf Mercenary Group had already been eradicated. Furthermore, as the only survivor, he would also die soon.

He was a bandit who had dominated this area for many years. Even though his appearance was a bit weak-looking, deep down, he was tougher than anyone else.

“You whores, the two of you have forced my hand!” he cried. He quickly chanted some cryptic words, then yelled out a summoning. “With my flesh, blood, and soul, summon the king of all ghosts here! Help me destroy the two women here and make them wish they were dead!”

He knew he was definitely going to die, so he decisively chose to drag down these b*tches with him.

As soon as he finished speaking, thick black smoke immediately surrounded him. His miserable screams resounded from within, as if he were enduring an inhuman form of torture. Then, his flesh and blood quickly shriveled up until nothing more than bones remained.

When she saw what was happening, Pei Mianman knew that things were becoming dangerous and quickly attacked the vice-leader to interrupt this ritual. Unfortunately, all of her attacks just vanished as soon as they made contact. Helpless to do anything else, she could only drag Chu Chuyan with her and back up quickly. At the same time, she explained the situation.

At almost the same time, a terrifying aura descended. A black mist surrounding a head made of countless skulls descended from above. It wrapped around the vice- leader's body as a voice intoned, “Who has summoned me?”

“Respected king of all ghosts, it was this lowly one who summoned you. I hope that your respected self can make these two women wish they were dead instead, for them to endure eternal torment.”

“The smell of fresh blood, as well as a curse full of hatred… These are truly the most delicious things in this world,” the skull head remarked with an elated look. “I have received your request.”

“Thank you, Ghost King!” the vice leader cried, even though he was nothing more than a skeleton. His empty eyes were still full of hatred as he stared in the two women’s direction.

“We need to run!” Pei Mianman cried, grabbing Chuyan and running.

They had already spent some time in this world, and judging from the things they’d heard, they knew that this Ghost King was an unrivaled being. Countless people feared him, and she didn’t believe that her Fu Hao’s Owl Statue domain could affect someone as powerful as him.

Sure enough, the skull head cackled. “You wish to run? How could it be that easy?”

Countless skulls rushed out surrounded by black mist, instantly filling up every inch of the black domain. Pei Mianman knew that maintaining Fu Hao’s domain against such an all-encompassing area of effect skill was useless. It would only affect Chu Chuyan’s sight and judgment. Thus, she put the owl statue away, and they both used their best movement skills from their respective sects. One turned into a ball of surging black flames, while the other turned into a hazy ice mist. They became countless times faster than usual.

“All resistance is futile before me,” the skull head said with a harsh, ear-splitting laugh. They moved like a flood as they chased the two women. Whether it was trees, flowers, birds, or beasts, everything they passed withered away and turned into bones.

In the blink of an eye, the black mist was just a few dozen meters behind the two women. When she saw that she couldn't get away, Chu Chuyan gritted her teeth, saying, “Manman, hurry and run. I’ll stall it!”

“Don’t be stupid! How could I leave you alone?” Pei Mianman replied, knowing that she still had a forbidden skill she could use. She naturally couldn’t just leave.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“If you don’t leave now, both of us are going to die!” Chu Chuyan cried, panicking. If Manman hadn’t rushed over, she would already have died. Pei Mianman had already saved her life once, so doing the same in return was fair.

Pei Mianman sighed and replied, “Do you think I’ll be able to find peace in this life if I abandon you in this situation? What do you think Ah Zu will think of me then? Good sisters should live together and die together!”

Chu Chuyan stared at her blankly for a moment. In that instant, she didn’t know how to respond. The black mist was already a mere meter away from them.

“Look how deep your shared emotions are. There is no need for you to try to yield to each other, because neither of you will be able to get away,” the skull head said. The black mist surged. A second later, both women were wrapped up within.

Suddenly, the earth quaked and the mountains shook, and a vast and ancient energy spread out. The world was filled with a refreshing vitality that was several times richer than normal. There were even some cheers in the distance. For it to reach so far, it was clearly not something one or two people could create, but something thousands upon tens of thousands had created.

The black mist paused for a moment, then shrank somewhat. The spiritual energy that suddenly flooded the world had clearly affected the Ghost King a bit too.

“The great tomb has opened!” the skulls cried as they turned to the great tomb, revealing looks of excitement.

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman didn’t hesitate. They both used their greatest skills to dash hundreds of meters away.

However, a harrumph emerged from the black mist. A skull turned in the direction the two women had fled in. Its empty eyes suddenly lit up, and two gray beams of light fired out, practically at the speed of light. The two women were hit at almost the same instant.

There seemed to be a hill right ahead of Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman. However, they staggered and fell. The black mist decided not to chase after them anymore and went in the direction of the great tomb’s entrance.

In the black mist, the vice-leader's skeleton screamed, “Ghost King, how can you let them go?!”

“Let them go?” the skull head replied, “They were struck by the Glare of Eternal Slumber and will quickly fall into a never-ending sleep. With their cultivation, they cannot to use their energies to protect themselves. Shortly after, their bodies will waste away until they turn into bones.”

“That’s different from our transaction! I wanted them to suffer and wish for death. Isn’t this kind of death through sleep too easy on them?” the vice-leader cried out. Their entire mercenary group had been wiped out today. Decades of work had turned into wasted effort. He had even offered himself up to summon the Ghost King. If all of that was just to make two women sleep, how could he accept that?

“The great tomb has already opened. This one has more important matters to tend to, so how can I bother with your task?” the skull head replied, already floating in the direction of the great tomb as it spoke.

“No! This is different from our deal! You’ve violated the ancient summoning principles!” the vice-leader roared in anger. He had already offered up everything he had, so he didn’t have anything else to lose.

“Summon? Even an ant like you has the qualifications to summon me?” the skull head replied. A ghost claw suddenly reached out from the black mist and grabbed the vice leader's skull. “This one was just bored and sent a bit of my aura here to play around. Otherwise, how could that trifling amount of flesh truly summon me?”

A look of extreme pain immediately appeared on the vice-leader's skull. Soon after, a soul flew out from between his eye sockets and was absorbed by the black mist. His skull was also absorbed, becoming no different from the countless other skulls in the mist.
