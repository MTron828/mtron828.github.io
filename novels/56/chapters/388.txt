Chapter 388: Twisted

Translator: Pika

Zu An frantically evaded with Sunflower Phantasm when he saw Old Mi’s sinister expression.

He was captured before he could react back in Chu Estate, but that was mainly because he was caught off guard. There was no way he would let the same thing happen again now that he was completely vigilant. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Old Mi sneered. I was the one who taught you the Sunflower Phantasm! Aren’t you showing off before a real expert here?!

As such, he confidently grabbed out, predicting where Zu An was moving towards next.

He could only seize Zu An and knock him out before using the possession technique now. The success rate will obviously be lower, but the odds were still in his favor. It was still worth the risk.

“I’ve caught you!” Old Mi grabbed at Zu An. However, his smile instantly froze.

That figure immediately shattered. He realized that he grabbed a fake clone.

“How is this possible?!” Old Mi suddenly turned around to look at the other Zu An.

He was the one who passed on this Sunflower Phantasm! He understood this technique far better than this brat, so why did things end up like this?

This youngster actually split up into two figures! Moreover, it was completely impossible to differentiate the difference between the clone and the real person before making contact! Their auras, ki flows, everything was completely the same.

“How did you manage to get to this level?” Old Mi stared at Zu An. He merely attributed this to something Zu An accidentally stumbled upon while practicing the Sunflower Phantasm.

This type of stuff has happened before. There were so many miraculous techniques in the world, and many of them were created from accidents and coincidences.

“Making a new technique isn’t anything too hard for an awesome genius like me!” Zu An replied. But inside, he was thanking the heavens. Thank god big sis empress modified his Sunflower Phantasm! Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to do anything against Old Mi!

Old Mi was annoyed when he saw Zu An’s smug appearance. How could the technique he was so proud of be modified on a whim? This kid really overestimated his own abilities!

You have successfully trolled Mi Lianying for +666 Rage!

Zu An immediately said when he saw the rage points, “Senior, is there some kind of misunderstanding between us? I just don’t want to learn this ‘Steps of Rising Lotus’, so why are you so upset?”

Old Mi harrumphed. “As matters stand, there is no harm in telling you. This old one likes your body.”

“Fuck!” Zu An immediately ran for his life. He covered his but while pulling open as much distance between them as he could. “Senior, I’m straight! I have no interest in other men!”

But he soon realized something. This old man is a eunuch, so he can’t do anything even if he has such thoughts. What am I so scared of?

He dropped his hands from his butt when he thought of this.

But Old Mi doesn’t have the ability to be on top. Is he a bottom?

He felt his stomach churn.

Old Mi also realized what he was thinking when he saw Zu An’s expression. He erupted in fury. “Damn brat, what kind of nonsense are you thinking?”

You have successfully trolled Mi Lianying for +781 Rage!

He decided to just say things clearly to prevent Zu An’s imaginations from running wild. “I might as well just tell you. You’ve heard from Wei Dan that even though he has died, there will be endless people pursuing me because I took the emperor’s possession for myself. For the sake of ending all of my troubles, I thought of a perfect solution.”

“What kind of solution?” You’re the wanted man here, why are you involving me?

Old Mi sized him up and down. He revealed a sinister smile. “It’s obviously Possession-Rebirth!”

“This body of mine is already old, and it is flawed to begin with. That is why I don’t have much reluctance in leaving it behind. However, you are different, and you even have the number one beauty in Brightmoon City as your wife! The Chu clan’s authority can provide me with status and wealth. Once I become you, not only would I have gotten rid of all of my worries, I would have a bright and beautiful future.”

“Possession?” Zu An was horrified. He immediately understood everything. This old man actually had this type of plan! No wonder he always felt like he was being looked at like prey.

This old man passed on all types of techniques to him so he felt a bit guilty for thinking such thoughts. But now that he knew about the real objective, he knew that all of this was for the sake of protecting his perfect vessel!

Old Mi smiled when he saw his stupefied appearance. “There is no need for you to feel so scared either. You don’t have much prospects with your bit of cultivation. You will forever be a useless drafted son-in-law. But I am different! With my cultivation and experiences, the Chu clan will soon be under my control. All of the Chu clan’s beauties will be mine to enjoy, and after a few years, your reputation will become widespread and glorious.”

“You will become a big winner in the eyes of this world’s people, a hero! Your name will echo for thousands of years and remain in the records of history! So? Isn’t this deal quite good for you?”

Zu An: “......”

“Are you actually being serious?”

Old Mi frowned. “Did I not make myself clear enough?”

“Screw you, you damn eunuch! You are lusting after my wife and other women! Something has to be fucking wrong with my head to agree to something like that...” Zu An couldn’t hold himself back anymore and began to curse Old Mi out.

Old Mi’s face twitched. He was furious.

You have successfully trolled Old Mi for +444 +444 +444...

“You ungrateful brat!”

He didn’t feel like saying anything else to Zu An. He charged straight at him.

Zu An used the modified Sunflower Phantasm at once. He turned into two different figures and ran in two different directions.

He already made his decision. He was going to run to the gorgeous principal for help as soon as he returned to Brightmoon City. At the same time, he would fetch Ji Dengtu and the others too. He’ll even contact Governor Sang Hong and City Lord Xie Yi. The one this old fart offended was the emperor, so there was no way these officials would turn a blind eye.

No matter how strong Old Mi was, there was no way he was a match for all of these experts!

But even though his plan was wonderful, reality was harsh. He suddenly felt his shoulder sink. Turns out Old Mi already caught up!

“How?!” It was now Zu An’s turn to feel shock.

Just how did this old man know where he was? Was his luck that bad?

Old Mi snorted. “You are only splitting into two identical figures. Why would I need to guess between the two? I’ll just capture both!”

The difference in cultivation between the two of them was too great, so Old Mi was obviously faster as well. When Old Mi knew that one of them was fake, then he would just attack both at the same time. This wasn’t too difficult with his speed.

He was just about to seal Zu An with his ki, but Zu An’s shoulder twisted. His arm twisted at a strange angle, and then his body slipped away like a loach. He instantly fled several zhang out.

“Oh? Pei Clan’s Feathersilk Entangling Art?” Old Mi was shocked. He spent quite a bit of time back in the capital as well, so he was familiar with those major clans’ techniques. He immediately recognized this technique.

Zu An gasped for breath. He would’ve been captured if he was even a second too late. He didn’t have Wei Dan to distract Old Mi this time, so it would be much harder to break out of the seal.

“Looks like that Pei clan girl treats you quite well.” Old Mi snickered. “Brat, you seem ordinary, but you do have some skills in chasing girls. Don’t worry, this old one will take care of those girls well for you. That Pei clan girl actually knows this Feathersilk Entangling Art... her body is definitely supple and strong! She is surely top-notch.”

Zu An’s face darkened. “Are you eunuchs all this nasty?”

“Haha, you can’t even begin to fathom how excited I am knowing I will become a complete man again!” Old Mi laughed. He didn’t feel embarrassed at all. Zu An was already a dead man in his eyes.

As for Zu An’s seal down there, he would just undo it after he possessed him. That wasn’t a problem at all.
