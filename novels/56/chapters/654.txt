Chapter 639: Kill the Criminal

Translator: Pika

Zu An smiled in embarrassment. “Eunuch has misunderstood. I have utmost respect for the empress. Why would I do anything that offends her?”

“Heh.” Eunuch Lu smirked.

Zu An really didn’t want to talk too much with this old creep. After a few more sentences, he bid him farewell.

He quickly arrived at the side chamber. The crown prince was stuffing his face, his mouth and fingers covered in grease.

The crown princess’ expression was completely cold. She clearly wanted to lecture the crown prince, yet she was worried that this was the Palace of Peace, so it was bad if others saw her lecture the crown prince. She could only hold it all in, but the more she endured, the more angry she got. She said with a sneer, “Crown prince, have you finished your meal? It is time for us to go back.”

The fatty shook his head. “They said that there’s still a lot of food coming! There’s steamed lamb, steamed bear’s paw, steamed deer tail, roast duck, roast chicken, roast goose, stewed pork, stewed duck, stewed chicken, spiced meat, air-dried meat, sausages, assorted vegetables, smoked chicken, pork soup, sticky rice duck…”

The crown princess’ eyelids jumped when she heard all of this. This fella couldn’t even remember more than three sentences from the Three Character Classic, yet he remembered the names of all of these dishes. Were you a pig in your last life?

When Zu An arrived, he almost saw steam come out of her head.

He hesitated. Would now be a bad time to talk to her?

But the current matters were pressing. He couldn’t be bothered with all of that right now and braced himself. “Crown princess.”

“What is it?” The crown princess was extremely unhappy.

Zu An was annoyed. This woman really was fickle. She was so nice when I wore that mask, why are you completely different now?

He could only say patiently, “The empress bestowed us many things, but I wasn’t even in the eastern palace yesterday. I feel guilty accepting all of this, so how about we pass them onto people who really need these goods?”

“Those who really need it?” The crown princess felt like this guy at least had some self-awareness. “Forget it, just take them. Those who deserve rewards already received them, so you can just keep what you were given.”

As a crown princess, she naturally wouldn’t do something like take the rewards of her subordinates. Otherwise, the empress would become the philanthropist, while she became the evil person.

“Hm, wait…” She suddenly thought of something. There was indeed someone who didn’t receive any rewards.

She suddenly felt excited and called over the big fatty. “Crown prince, we should express our thanks to golden token Sir Eleven. He saved us yesterday.”

The nervous Zu An sighed in relief when he heard her say this. Thank goodness the crown princess was smart.

It was because she was smart that even though Zu An wanted to drag the crown princess straight over to deal with Cheng Xiong, he was worried that she might smell something fishy afterwards.

He couldn’t let anyone make the slightest connection between the crown prince’s secretary and Golden Token Eleven.

That was why he could only make tactful suggestions and make the crown princess think of Golden Token Eleven herself. That way, there wouldn’t be any problems.

The crown prince was completely immersed in the food right now. When he heard this, he waved his hands and said, “I’m not going. I didn’t finish eating yet.”

“Eat, eat, eat, that’s all you know how to do!” The crown princess finally couldn’t hold it in anymore. Her face was covered in disgust when she saw the crown prince’s jiggling fat. “You don’t even care about the one who saved your life? Once his majesty and the lesser tutor find out about this, they’re going to scold you again!”

The crown prince protected the food in front of him as if he was worried that she might just swipe all of it onto the floor. After all, it wouldn’t be the first time she did that.

After successfully protecting the food, he sighed in relief and said, “Can’t we just have that imperial guard come over and give him some reward? Why do we have to run all the way there?”

Zu An panicked. What the crown prince said wasn’t entirely without reason. All of the guards and officials were the royal family’s subjects. Why did the master have to visit the subject themselves?

Fortunately, the crown princess harrumphed and said, “We obviously need to express our sincerity when others save our lives. Furthermore, as the royal family, we should be winning over our subjects with goodwill. This is something that should be little effort but great benefits.”

But regardless of how she tried to reason with him, the crown prince remained unmoved. “Go by yourself then, if you really wanna go.”

Food was clearly a higher priority than the one who saved his life.

The crown princess gritted her teeth. She decided she wasn’t going to say anything else. She waved her hand and said, “We’re going!”

Zu An followed behind her. He sighed when he heard the clinking of the decorations on her dress. The crown princess was definitely in a horrible mood, or else her dress wouldn’t be making so much noise.

High ranking officials always loved to wear jade ornaments on them. This served to express their honesty and upright character, as they would make noises wherever they went, so they couldn’t sneak around with them on. At the same time, this was a type of decoration, as well as a way to help restrict one’s bearing and only allowing a graceful gait that wasn’t too fast or too slow. Only at the perfect speed would the jade pendants make the most pleasant sounding noises.

That was why the noise coming from the crown princess’ dress was already a bit discourteous. She was definitely angered quite badly by the crown prince.

He already quietly left the troop a while ago. He brought his Golden Token Eleven uniform out from his Brilliant Glass Bead and quickly changed along the way, hurrying to his own palace residence.

I hope I can make it in time! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

He prayed inside. Cheng Xiong made it clear that he was going to target him. He might make it look like he was targeting the other Embroidered Envoys, but he will definitely head his way soon.

Sure enough, Cheng Xiong already surrounded the courtyard with a large group of imperial guards.

Cheng Xiong said, “Sir Eleven, we are carrying out a routine inspection. If you do not reply, I will come inside with my men.”

Seeing that there was no response after saying this, his lips curled upwards. Then, he said to his subordinates, “Since Sir Eleven is not here, then just open the door.”

Zu An noticed that there were two imperial guards who were dressed differently. They didn’t look like imperial guards but rather like librarian researchers. These were probably rune masters! They specialized in engraving runes and were capable of bringing about many miraculous things.

The runes of these courtyards were all made by them, so of course they could unlock them.

Zu An harrumphed when he saw that they were about to break open the formation. He walked over. “What are you all doing?”

Cheng Xiong smirked when he saw him arrive, and then he put on an embarrassed smile. “Sir Eleven came back at just the right time. You saved us the effort of breaking down the door. We are examining the situation with the Embroidered Envoy’s uniforms. I ask sir to bring them out so everyone can take a look.”

Zu An sneered. “Bastards, what right do you have to investigate the Embroidered Envoy? Am I supposed to do whatever you tell me to do? Who do you think you are?”

Cheng Xiong’s breathing stopped. He didn’t expect this guy to straight up drop the pretenses!

You have successfully trolled Cheng Xiong for +888 Rage points!

Don’t blame me for being rude then!

Chng Xiong’s expression immediately became cold. “The imperial guards reported seeing someone dressed in an Embroidered Envoy uniform that shouldn’t be. That is why we are investigating the Embroidered Envoy’s uniforms.”

Zu An cut him off. “What a joke. Since the palace guards noticed that it was an assassin, why didn’t they arrest him on the spot and insist on doing all of this afterwards? I have enough reason to suspect that you are deliberately making false charges.”

Someone like Cheng Xiong who reached his position was naturally someone with enough resolution. He immediately said, “The truth will come to light. If Sir Eleven has no guilt, then why aren’t you letting us investigate this situation? You could easily convince us with the truth.”

Zu An sneered. “What kind of logic is that? You are throwing sh*t at my face and demanding I prove my innocence? Then what if I said that you ate two bowls of sh*t for breakfast, and so we should have your stomach cut open for everyone to see. That way, we can prove your innocence by seeing if there is sh*t inside or not!”

The surrounding imperial guards all did their best to hold in their laughter. They wanted to laugh, but couldn’t. It really was quite the terrible feeling.

“You bastard!” Cheng Xiong roared in anger.

You have successfully trolled Cheng Xiong for +999 Rage points!

“Arrest this man! Cut him down if he resists!” He was already full of killing intent, to the extent where he was starting to feel excitement. As the investigator of this case, he currently had the authority and reason for his suspicion. As long as this fella resisted, then he could claim that he was resisting due to guilt, so killing him was a logical choice. Zhuxie Chixin and the others wouldn’t be able to say anything afterwards.
