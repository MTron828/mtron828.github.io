Chapter 1010: My Wife Really Is Adorable

Zhao Zhi was all smiles. Suddenly, he frowned and said, “But she didn’t seem to want to meet me during the day. Don’t tell me she isn’t willing?”

Han Fengqiu replied, “Which woman in this world doesn’t wish to become a concubine of King Qi Manor? Such an increase in status is something countless people hope for but will never be able to obtain, so why wouldn’t she be willing? She might’ve just been too embarrassed, or maybe she’s deliberately feigning a reserved nature to draw your respected self’s attention.”

“Indeed, this woman has successfully drawn this young master’s attention.” Zhao Zhi’s entire head was filled with that gorgeous figure he had seen during the day. He thought to himself just how great being with that woman would be.

“I don’t know why, but I just feel a bit anxious.” Zhao Zhi suddenly voiced his thoughts. He looked in the Pei clan's direction with a distracted expression.

…

Meanwhile, in Pei Manor, a moan that would make anyone’s bones melt rang out. “It hurts…”

“Huh?” Zu An raised his head in puzzlement.

“Dummy.” Pei Mianman giggled when she saw him in a rare state of confusion. However, she looked away in embarrassment and continued, “Did you forget? In Yinxu, only… Only our souls were together.”

Zu An was stunned. Then he realized, “Then doesn’t that mean you’re still…”

An ice-cold finger pressed against his mouth. Pei Mianman looked at him with a lovable, yet annoyed expression. “You’re not allowed to say it!”

“I won’t, I won’t, haha.” Zu An couldn't help but chuckle. There were no men who wouldn’t be happy in such a situation.

“You’re a bad man~” Pei Mianman was finally a bit annoyed. She bared her fangs and was about to bite him. The two of them quickly tangled around each other.

After they fought for a bit, Zu An embraced her soft body, saying, “Manman, I missed you so much.”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Me too.” Pei Mianman’s charming gaze was extremely gentle. She looked at him with tender feelings, as if she were silently inviting him in.

How could Zu An hold himself back? He immediately kissed her. In the secret dungeon, the two of them had been husband and wife for several generations. They had already become extremely intimate.

“Mmm… It hurts…”

…

A while later, a maid below suddenly woke up with a start. She heard creaking coming from above. She was confused, wondering whether her lady couldn't sleep. Why was she tossing and turning restlessly in bed?”

Since Pei Mianman usually spent her time cultivating, she didn’t let the maid disturb her. That was why the maid could only feel nervous. She muttered, “I’ll make my lady some soothing medicinal congee to drink and help her sleep better. Right, I should also tell the housekeeper that the bed needs to be changed.”

Even though my lady doesn’t receive much favor, she can’t just sleep on an old bed that groans like this just because she can’t sleep! the maid thought to herself in a daze. Then, she turned around and tried to go back to sleep. For some reason, she also began to feel a bit restless as she listened to the creaking.

…

The next morning, Zu An felt a stinging pain. He woke up because someone had bitten him. He grimaced, asking, “What are you doing?”

Pei Mianman’s long hair scattered across his arm. She bared her small canines and exclaimed, “You baddie, you took my virginity three times!”

Zu An chuckled and took her into his arms, saying, “You baddie, you should be happy about that. Other girls will never have an experience like yours.”

“You’re probably the one who’s the happiest!” Pei Mianman was really annoyed seeing him so happy. She moved over to bite him again, starting another round of wrestling.

…

A while later, Pei Mianman pushed the man next to her away. There was still a bit of lingering redness on her face as she said, “It’s almost daytime, and the maid will come up soon. You should hurry back.”

Zu An looked a bit gloomy, asking, “Why do we always have to be so secretive? Should I just propose marriage to your father?”

Pei Mianman replied with an ambiguous expression, “Then what about Chuyan?”

Zu An choked Pei Mianman laughed and said, “It’s okay; I’m happy enough just to hear that you had that intention. My clan wants to marry me off to King Qi Manor as a concubine, so how could they allow me to marry anyone else?”

“You clan’s members really are impossibly stupid. King Qi is already almost finished, and yet they still keep throwing things straight into the fire pit.” Zu An naturally knew that the emperor was already targeting King Qi.

Pei Mianman smiled and replied, “I don’t like anyone else, so who cares if he’s King Qi’s heir or a random commoner? I won’t marry them. I will only marry you alone.”

Zu An was truly moved when he heard that. He immediately pulled her close to him. Pei Mianman was immediately shaken up and said, “I really can’t keep going; let me slowly…”

…

As Zu An was about to leave, he suddenly remembered something and took out the ‘toothpick’ sword Xiao Yao had given him, saying, “Keep this with you. If you end up facing someone you can’t defeat, just use this against them. It will release an attack on par with the full-forcestrike of a master rank cultivator.”

Xiao Yao didn’t know that Zu An still had other trump cards under his belt. Such a thing wasn’t too useful for him. After all, should he encounter something too hard to deal with, he still had the emperor’s decree at his disposal.

Meanwhile, even though Pei Mianman’s cultivation wasn’t low, and she even had Fu Hao’s owl statue, it wouldn’t be enough against a true expert. Furthermore, he couldn't always stay at her side, so such a thing would make Zu An feel a bit more at ease.

“Did you get that from the drunkard? I don’t want it.” Pei Mianman immediately recognized the little sword’s background. She harrumphed and refused.

“Don’t make a fuss. It’s something I’m giving you now.” Zu An tossed it into her clothes. “Cloudcenter Commandery is extremely dangerous, and the Pei clan even wants to marry you off. Having more things to protect yourself can only be a good thing. You’re now mine, so you have to protect yourself well for me.”

“Hmph, who’s yours?” Pei Mianman scoffed, a pink blush crossing her cheeks.

Zu An suddenly felt he was in the mood again… but he was chased out in the end.

…

When he returned to his residence, Zu An felt as if all of the stress he experienced from the mission had vanished. When he remembered his gentle and enthusiastic night with Pei Mianman, he immediately felt invigorated.

Gao Ying and Pei You were washing up. They couldn't help but ask when they saw how happy he looked, “Brother Zu, what’s caused you to be in such a good mood today?”

Zu An coughed and said, “It’s nothing. I’m just in a good mood.”

Pei You moved over and gave him a sniff. He remarked, “Hm? You smell pretty good. It smells a lot better than the girls from the pleasure quarters. Do all the girls in Cloudcenter Commandery have such noble tastes?

Gao Ying had an expression of hidden bitterness on his face. He said, “Brother Zu, you didn’t even invite us.”

Zu An was speechless. These two really have become addicted to playing around in those brothels!

He saw Sang Hong come out from his room too. Zu An coughed and said, “We are members of the imperial envoy; we represent the dignity of the court. How can we go to the pleasure quarters? We would end up becoming the laughingstock of Cloudcenter Commandery’s officials.”

Sang Hong nodded in appreciation. Even though Ah Zu did behave a bit frivolously sometimes, he still knew when to act seriously. Qien’er wouldn’t be wronged by following him. Sigh, we’ve been gone for so long already. I wonder if Qien’er was able to get pregnant or not…

Pei You and Gao Ying had strange expressions. They thought to themselves, Who are you talking all fancy like that to? They were just about to mock him when they noticed that Sang Hong was nearby. They immediately changed their tone.

“Brother Zu’s words are correct.”

“Brother Zu is a model for our generation.”

…

Zu An was a bit embarrassed when he saw the two grit their teeth. He immediately changed the topic, asking, “Haha, why did you all get up so early? Do you already have plans?”

“We were about to pay Madam Yu a visit. She’s a key component of the case this time.” Their expressions became somewhat moved. Yu Yanluo had been the number one beauty in the past. Even though they knew someone like that would never have any relationship with them, as men, who wouldn’t want to admire her beauty from up close?

Zu An replied, “Oh, then you guys should go; I won’t come along with you. I looked around last night, so I feel a bit tired right now. I’m going to get some rest.” He thought, Big Manman really is a little enchantress. I didn’t get to sleep much last night at all!

Gao Ying and Pei You were confused. You’re not even interested in seeing the number one beauty? Are you even a man or not? Still, it was better for them if Zu An didn’t go. Otherwise, he would always end up stealing the spotlight somehow.

“Ah Zu, rest well. There is no need for you to worry about Yu Yanluo’s matters,” Sang Hong said. Even though he was curious as to what Zu An had been investigating the previous night, judging from how tired Zu An looked, he couldn't really ask about it at the moment. It was more important for Zu An to go back and rest first.

“Thank you, respected uncle.” Zu An’s face heated up, and he quickly returned to his room. When he entered the covers, he fell asleep just a few moments after hitting the bed. He really was too tired after the previous night.

…

Meanwhile, in Pei Manor, Pei Shao was politely receiving King Qi’s heir with his wife.

Zhao Zhi pointed at the exquisite gift case on the table, saying, “These are special cakes that I purchased from Cassia Moon Restaurant for Miss Pei. I hope they are to the young miss’ taste.”

“The young heir is too kind.” Madam Pei had a big smile on her face. She then urged a maid off to the side, “Why aren’t you inviting the young miss over yet?”

The maid left, then came back. She stuttered, “The young miss… The young miss said she was tired, so she was going to sleep some more. She said the master and madam should eat on their own.”

Madam Pei’s smile froze. She exclaimed, “That damn lass! Was sleeping all night not enough? The young heir came all the way here to see her; how can she be so indiscriminate?!”

Zhao Zhi frowned. Pei Mianman is going to be my concubine in the future; how can you talk about her like this?

Pei Shao seemed to have sensed Zhao Zhi’s change in attitude. He quickly stopped his wife from berating Pei Mianman further, saying, “Ahem, madam, how about you call her over personally? I must ask the heir for your pardon. That child has been spoiled a bit by us, so she has become a bit headstrong.”

“It’s fine; let her sleep for a bit longer. We can just chat on our own.” Zhao Zhi smiled. He wanted to leave Pei Mianman with a good impression. A woman as pretty as her ought to throw a bit of a tantrum from time to time.

Furthermore, she must be a bit shaken that she’s going to be wed to this young master. Her predicament is understandable. I should show her my gentlemanly side. She’ll soon have a favorable opinion of me.

Pei Mianman’s incredible appearance and voluptuous figure appeared in his mind again. No wonder she has such an amazing figure; it was all from good rest.

My wife really is adorable.
