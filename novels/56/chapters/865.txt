Chapter 834, (2): Emperor’s Trump Card

Zu An just happened to arrive at that moment. His gaze immediately turned cold, but he didn’t act rashly and instead continued to remain hidden, waiting for the best opportunity to strike.

Mi Li nodded as she watched him. This kid was growing up. He was clearly furious, yet he didn’t act impulsively.

Lu Xiao dropped from the sky and looked at the fat crown prince. “Hm? You’re actually not that scared even in this situation? You really are an idiot after all.”

“Why do I have to be scared?” The crown prince looked at him with a strange expression.

Zu An was shocked as he remained in hiding. His attention had originally been completely focused on Lu Xiao in order to find a chance to take him down, but now, he couldn’t help but take a look at the crown prince. It was the same face; however, it seemed extremely unfamiliar. He didn’t know if it was because the crown prince’s usual stupid smile was no longer there.

Lu Xiao also frowned, having sensed the same strangeness. “Because you’re about to die… Sigh, I actually have to explain this to an idiot.”

Seeing Lu Xiao’s annoyance, the crown prince replied, “Do you think you’re really smart then?”

“At least smarter than you,” Lu Xiao subconsciously replied. Then, he frowned. “Do you understand your situation? Stop trying to show off already. Do you really think that you have any qualities of an emperor?”

The crown prince sighed. “Zhao Jing’s subordinates are getting more and more out of hand.”

Zu An felt a chill run down his back. He didn’t know exactly why either, but all of his fine hairs were standing on end.

Mi Li’s voice said in his head, “Be careful, something isn’t right with this crown prince.” Her tone was extremely serious, as if she had also noticed something.

“You scoundrel, you dare utter King Qi’s taboo name?” Lu Xiao exclaimed. However, he suddenly frowned and stared at the crown prince halfway through his sentence, asking, “You aren’t an idiot?”

The crown prince laughed. “Who said I was an idiot?”

Zu An felt his mind explode when he heard what the crown prince said and saw how he was speaking. He had thought that he was surrounded by old foxes in the capital; he hadn’t expected the trickiest one to have been right next to him! Wait, if he isn’t a fool, doesn’t that mean that everything he did with Bi Linglong…

Lu Xiao was also quite shocked. “Wow, I never expected this! You actually fooled everyone in the capital for so long.”

The crown prince didn’t reply, and only continued to stare at him indifferently.

Lu Xiao really didn’t like being looked at that way. He should be the one looking at others as if they were ants, not the one being looked at that way. “Damn fatty, you’ve hidden it quite well all this time, huh? You even tricked King Qi. However, it’s all meaningless. You’ll still die here.”

“Are you sure I’ll die?” A mocking smile appeared on the fatty’s face. His smile would normally have only seemed comical, but now, it instead caused a strange sense of fear.

Lu Xiao didn’t know why he was getting scared. He quickly suppressed his emotions and looked at the other party. “Crown prince, you’ve really hidden this well. But it’s still meaningless! You’re still too young. Even if you cultivated ever since you were born, what level could you reach? Do you think everyone’s a monster like Zu An?!”

Zu An cursed inwardly. If you’re going to talk, then just talk; why the hell are you dragging me in too? Right now, every single one of his cells was on alert. He really wanted to teach Lu Xiao a lesson, but he didn’t dare to make any moves and instead focused on hiding his aura.

“Zu An?” the crown prince muttered to himself. “That fella is indeed a bit strange.”

Lu Xiao frowned. He just felt that something wasn’t right, yet he couldn’t really put his finger on it. However, he quickly calmed down again. He was a powerful expert at the mid stage of the master rank. Even in the capital where powerful cultivators were everywhere, he was still among the very best. Why was he being scared by a damn fatty here?

He snorted. “I don’t feel like wasting any time on you anymore. Once I kill you, I’m going to go after the crown princess and the others.”

As he spoke, he kicked outward. A blade that had landed on the ground next to the guards shot out like a cannonball. It had enough power to blast apart every blood vessel in the crown prince’s body, then nail his corpse to the tree. Lu Xiao then planned to lure vicious beasts over to devour the crown prince’s entire corpse until there wasn’t even a single bone left. This way, the emperor wouldn’t find a single trace even if he sent people inside to investigate later.

The crown prince didn’t evade at all; he didn’t even move. Lu Xiao initially thought that he had been scared stiff. But his smile quickly froze, because the blade suddenly stopped cold, floating three feet in front of the crown prince.

Lu Xiao subconsciously took a step back, exclaiming, “What’s your real cultivation?!” He couldn’t even sense how the other party had neutralized his ferocious attack. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

The fatty had a strange smile on his face. “It’s already been many years since anyone dared to attack me. This kind of feeling really brings back memories.”

Lu Xiao’s expression changed as his entire body went on high alert. As a mid stage master rank, he was capable of anticipating danger ahead of time. He didn’t hesitate at all and rushed into the sky. The only thing in his mind right now was to fly as fast as he could, the faster, the better. He had to get out of here.

But as soon as he began his ascent, he suddenly felt lighter. Then, he lost his center of gravity and crashed into the ground. He lowered his head and discovered that his legs had been cut off at the knees. Just then, intense pain finally spread through his body. He screamed in pain as he clutched his legs, rolling on the ground in agony. The cocky and arrogant Lu Xiao from just a moment before was nowhere to be seen.

Zu An felt a chill run down his back. He stared at the ordinary guard’s blade in front of the crown prince. It was actually still three feet in front of him, as if it had never moved. However, the drop of blood that slowly trickled down the blade declared that it was precisely that blade that had cleaved through Lu Xiao’s legs.

It’s over just like that? Zu An was horrified. He hadn’t seen how the blade attacked either. If that blade had been aimed at him, he probably wouldn’t have been able to evade it either.

“Who exactly are you?” Lu Xiao stared at the distant crown prince in horror. The laughable fatty had now become utterly terrifying.

“Who do you think I am?” The crown prince cracked a grin.

Lu Xiao gritted his teeth. He formed a sword seal with his hand, and the iron sword he had used in his younger years appeared next to him. He was a mid stage master rank cultivator, after all. Even though his legs were crippled, he could control a flying sword without them.

The iron sword screamed as Lu Xiao pointed at the crown prince, exclaiming, “Swiftly!”

The flying sword transformed into a comet, moving twice as quickly as Wei Pingyang’s sword! This was Lu Xiao’s most powerful attack, his pride, the accumulation of a lifetime of cultivation. Whether he won or lost would depend on this attack.

The crown prince finally made his move. He slowly raised his hand. His fingers clearly appeared to move slowly in Lu Xiao and Zu An’s eyes, yet they moved faster than the flying sword. His two chubby fingers clamped down on that lightning-fast flying sword.

“What?!” Lu Xiao exclaimed.

Zu An and Lu Xiao’s eyes were about to pop out of their sockets. This was a scene neither of them had expected.

Lu Xiao’s entire body trembled as he sensed the threat of death. He struggled to maintain his sword technique, trying to regain control over the flying sword. If a normal person had tried to clamp down on the flying sword like this, or even an ordinary master rank cultivator, he could just spur on the flying sword and slice those fingers to pieces. Under his control, the flying sword vibrated with noise, struggling intensely as it tried to free itself from the crown prince’s fingers.

The crown prince gave it a look, and his fingers crossed. The flying sword broke apart inch by inch, and then turned to dust in the wind!

“Pfft!” Blood spurted out of Lu Xiao’s mouth. His expression instantly became haggard, his hair turning gray.

Not only had the flying sword been smashed; the attack also continued to crush his soul! This was only something a grandmaster could do! No, not even a grandmaster could do something like this so easily.

He thought about the aura he had felt, and finally realized something. He looked at the fatty in horror, saying hoarsely, “Your majesty, it was actually your majesty…”
