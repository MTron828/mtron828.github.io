Chapter 288: Furious

Translator: Pika

Only then did Chu Chuyan realize that it was her own mind that was coming up with the wrong thoughts. Her pale face tinged with a layer of redness, and her ice-cold body also warmed slightly from her embarrassment.

Zu An grinned mischievously when he noticed her body’s sensitivity. “Honey, you still haven’t replied to my question! Which part of your body feels the most uncomfortable? I should treat that part first.”

Chu Chuyan gritted her teeth. This guy just doesn’t know when to stop!

The two of us are already engaged in this act. What else do you want me to say?

“If you don’t tell me, I’ll have no choice but to randomly treat you my way, you know?” Zu An whispered beside her ear.

Chu Chuyan frowned when she noticed his movements. She tried to stop him at once. “Wait...!”

Zu An looked confused. Chu Chuyan’s eyes swirled with mist, as if she were on the brink of tears. “Please, stop for a bit. Let me catch my breath.”

Even though this wasn’t the first time the two of them had been so intimate with each other, for some reason, her memories of their last experience in the dungeon were extremely blurry. She only remembered a mixture of anger, embarrassment, and confusion.

This was the first time she was still rather clear-headed.

Are all men this extreme? Chu Chuyan clenched her teeth tightly as she endured it bitterly. This sudden thought made her face flush red. Her strict upbringing immediately stopped her from exploring it any further.

She clung tightly onto his clothes, breathing heavily as she gradually got used to the feeling of a man.

When he saw her beautiful brows knit together, Zu An’s heart welled up with sympathy. He couldn’t help but lean down to kiss her red lips.

Chu Chuyan’s entire body trembled. She felt as if an electric current had shot through her entire body.

Zu An was stunned. He hadn’t expected this ice queen to be so sensitive.

A naughty smile appeared on his face. “I’m going to start, then.”

Chu Chuyan was so embarrassed she didn’t dare to look him in the eyes. She turned her face to the side, exposing her neck, which had flushed red as well. She quietly voiced her agreement.

She didn’t know what in the world was coming over her. Her previous self would never have agreed to letting any man do this to her. Even the Chuyan from yesterday definitely wouldn’t have agreed to it.

But now...

She didn’t understand why either.

She didn’t want to understand right now.

Soon, she didn’t have any room to think about these things. She felt as if her body was like a skiff in the sea, tossed and turned under a violent storm. Sometimes, she was sent towards the clouds, at other times dragged deep into the ocean depths... she didn’t know if she would live, or be drowned in the endless abyss...

Quite some time had passed, and the Chu clan members outside had grown extremely anxious.

“I wonder what’s going on inside...” Qin Wanru paced about the entrance.

Her daughter had matured at an early age, and had slowly grown more and more reserved. Because of this, she arranged for special rune formations to be placed around the door and windows to isolate all sound.

That was why no one outside had any idea what was happening inside.

Qin Wanru suddenly thought of Snow. It would have been good to have someone like her to check out the situation inside.

Ever since Snow left, Chu Chuyan hadn’t found another maid for herself.

Off to the side, Chu Zhongtian noticed her anxious pacing. “Why don’t you go inside to take a look?” His wife had mentioned that the treatment had to be conducted while his daughter was naked, so it was inappropriate for him to enter.

But that was no issue for his wife at all!

Qin Wanru saw the sense in his words. Although it wasn’t appropriate for others to go in, there should be nothing wrong for her as a mother.

Emboldened, she knocked on the door and said, “Ah Zu, how is Chuyan’s condition?”

Silence answered her.

“I’m going to come in if you don’t say anything!”

There was still no reply. Worried for her daughter’s safety, she tried to push the door open, but it didn’t budge at all.

“That brat locked the door!” Qin Wanru looked angrily at her husband.

Chu Zhongtian nodded. Her daughter was still young, but her cultivation was extremely high. The restrictions she put in place couldn’t be undone by an ordinary person.

He walked over to the door and gently pressed his hand against the door. Ki left his body, undoing the restrictions on the door. “It’s done.”

“Help me keep watch outside. I’m going to take a look,” Qin Wanru said. If a bunch of people accidentally rushed in and saw their daughter without any clothes on, whatever purity she had left would be in tatters.

She needed to know that her husband would stand guard.

Chu Zhongtian gave her a firm nod, which helped to ease her anxiety.

Satisfied, Qin Wanru pushed open the door and entered, quickly closing it behind her and locking it up again.

Only then did she head further inside.

Chu Chuyan was the precious daughter of a dukedom after all, so her room was still quite large. From where she was, Qin Wanru couldn’t immediately make out the situation inside.

She didn’t want to announce her presence with a loud voice either, just in case they were at a crucial part of the treatment process. I’ll just sneak a look and leave after making sure my daughter is fine. I won’t disturb their treatment process.

As she walked further into the room, she suddenly heard some odd noises, almost like a suppressed sobbing and moaning.

“Hm?” Qin Wanru was confused. She was no stranger to such sounds, but how could this be possible?!

Perhaps Chuyan is groaning because her condition is too serious.

This thought had just entered her mind when she made it beyond the screen. The scene before her left her completely stunned.

She had thought of countless possibilities, and had even prepared herself for her daughter’s condition being incurable. This was the one scene she had never expected to see.

Zu An and Chu Chuyan hadn’t expected her to enter either. They turned around instinctively at the strange noise. The three of them grew wide-eyed.

“Zu brat, you bastard!” Qin Wanru finally recovered from her initial shock and astonishment, and instantly erupted in rage.

You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for 1024 Rage points!

Qin Wanru refused to believe that her daughter would allow any man to treat her like this, not even if the man in question was her actual husband.

There could only be one explanation! Zu An had taken advantage of her like a deranged beast while she was seriously injured and powerless to resist!

She thought about how everyone was still worried outside, completely unaware of the misfortune and humiliation that her daughter was suffering inside. It made her want to skin Zu An alive! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for 999... 999... 999...

She could no longer hold herself back, attacking Zu An directly. She was completely ruthless, striking to kill.

In a panic, Zu An dodged to one side. But Qin Wanru was a sixth rank cultivator. How could it be that easy to evade her?

At this moment of crisis, he hurriedly employed Mi Li’s modified Sunflower Phantasm. His figure immediately split into two, both images running in two different directions.

Qin Wanru focused all of her attention on the figure in front of her. She swung a vicious palm which cleaved straight into the middle of his back.

Her hand felt as if it had struck empty air, leaving her shocked. The figure in front of her scattered into an expanse of light and shadows.

A decoy?

She was still a duchess after all, and had much experience. She knew immediately what had transpired.

Her eyes locked onto the other Zu An, who had fled to the other side of the room. Just as she was about to attack again, Chu Chuyan’s weak voice called out to her. “Mom...”

“It’s okay, mom is here.” Qin Wanru immediately rushed over to support her. At the same time, her heart softened. She thought about how proud and arrogant her daughter had been since birth, and how her purity had been destroyed by such a deplorable fellow.

It’s all our fault for trusting him too much!

She moved to renew her attack.

“Stop...” Chu Chuyan grabbed her hand, while using her other hand to wrap the quilt around herself.

Qin Wanru looked at her, puzzled. Her daughter’s reaction was too strange! Was she too shocked by the situation?

“He... he was actually... giving me treatment.” Chu Chuyan lowered her head, her face already completely red.

This really was too embarrassing! Her own mother had stumbled in and seen her.

She was still too embarrassed to say anything, but she was worried that her mother would really kill Zu An, or alarm someone else into rushing in. That would be even more humiliating.

“Treatment? What the heck is being treated here?!” Qin Wanru assumed her daughter was too embarrassed to speak the truth. “Don’t worry, your mother will avenge you! This little bastard will not get away with violating you today.”

With that, she charged at Zu An.

Chu Chuyan panicked when she saw that her mother had not understood. There was only one thing left to say. “Actually... actually... I agreed.”

Qin Wanru came to a screeching halt. She turned around in disbelief. “What did you say?”

Chu Chuyan’s face was clouded over, clearly conflicted. She took some time to steel herself. “Actually... in the dungeon... we... we already became a real... a real husband and wife.”

Qin Wanru was at a loss for words. Her mouth worked furiously, but no sound came out.

She never would have imagined such a situation, not even in her wildest dreams or her darkest nightmares.

Zu An was incredibly moved. After all, even though the two of them had engaged in an intimate act, it had only been to save Chu Chuyan. In their hearts, they knew that they were still far from a true husband and wife, and that Chu Chuyan still didn’t truly accept him.

Who could have expected Chu Chuyan would actually admit to this herself? He felt like he was about to explode with happiness.

“The two of you have already consummated your marriage in the secret dungeon?” Qin Wanru finally managed. She was still completely stunned, but a glimmer of understanding came to her. No wonder my daughter was willing to receive treatment from him without her clothes on, despite her cold and reserved nature! I should have foreseen this!

“Then again, even if the two of you are really husband and wife, to engage in... in this sort of thing at this kind of time... this... this is too much!” Qin Wanru was clearly not in the mood to try and figure out the history behind these two. Right now, her daughter was clearly extremely injured, a group of people were nervously waiting outside, and yet, they were...

Zu An smiled bitterly. “I really am rescuing Chuyan!” he cried.

“Shut your mouth!” Qin Wanru gave him a hateful glare. As her eyes landed on him, her expression suddenly froze.

She had been so wrapped up in her anger while chasing after him that she hadn’t noticed anything else.

Now that she calmed down a little, she suddenly realized that he was stark naked.

Why is this guy so... so... Qin Wanru’s face grew a bright shade of red. She turned a flustered look upon Chu Chuyan. How could her delicate daughter endure such a thing?!
