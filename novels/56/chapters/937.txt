Chapter 902, Part 1: Alliance

Zheng Dan didn’t understand how wearing Chu Chuyan’s clothes would help them through the situation. But now that things had already reached this point, there was nothing else she could do either. Her mind was already a mess, so she subconsciously listened to Zu An’s instructions.

But female clothing wasn't so easy to change into in this world. She couldn’t finish changing even after a long time. She decided to just hide behind a screen.

Zu An moved to stop the Sang clan’s father and daughter duo. The best result would be if they didn’t see anything. After all, he had never tested out ‘Pin Ru’s Wardrobe’ yet and didn’t know if it would work.

But the door slammed open as soon as he reached the entrance. A beautiful figure rushed in.

Zu An stopped her and asked in a serious tone, “What are you doing?”

The figure was alarmed. She quickly covered her chest with her arms, staring at him in embarrassment and anger.

You have successfully trolled Sang Qien for +44 +44 +44…

The young lady that had barged in was, of course, the Sang clan’s young miss Sang Qien. Zu An hadn’t expected that he would just happen to touch some areas he shouldn’t have when he stopped her.

“What in the world are you doing, hiding inside all day!!” Sang Qien was about to cry. It almost looked as if she had been the one throwing herself at him!

“It’s your fault for barging in like this. I was just about to open the door.” Zu An had been planning to criticize her harshly, but with this unexpected situation, his tone couldn't help but ease a bit.

“Ahem!” Sang Hong exclaimed from outside. “Sir Zu, please don’t blame my daughter. She’s a bit rash in nature and has bumped into Sir Zu. This old one will apologize in her place.”

Sang Qien became sullen. She had clearly been taken advantage of, and yet her father was apologizing instead? Such a feeling really wasn’t great.

Zu An had a strange look on his face. I might have believed you if you said that Sang Qian’s temperament was rash, but you’re saying this about the resourceful Sang Qien?

This old fox was clearly using his daughter to get inside. That way, even if they broke inside, Zu An couldn't really say much.

“Master!” Several servants rushed in with clubs in hand. They looked at the visitors with unkind expressions. Letting the pair barge in was already hugely neglectful of their duty.

“It’s fine, we’re old friends. You can all withdraw for now.” Zu An didn’t want this matter to get out of hand either. He gestured for them to leave for the time being. Then, he looked at the father and daughter and said with a smile, “The two of you burst in like this so fiercely. Others might think that you came to catch an adulterer or something.”

Zheng Dan jumped in fright. This guy really dares to say something like that? Hmph, I want to see what you’ll do once they find out!

Sang Qien blushed and looked away guiltily. But the old fox Sang Hong was clearly much more shameless. He replied with a smile, “I see that Sir Zu is still as fond of jokes as usual. We heard that you were injured quite badly in the dungeon, but we couldn't meet with you all this time while you were in the palace. When we learned that you had emerged, we immediately came to see you. Qien’er here was too worried about you and barged in. I’ll have to ask you to forgive her rudeness.”

“Dad…” Sang Qien stamped her feet. Even though she knew that her father was using her as an excuse, her young lady’s shyness still couldn't take it. Sang Hong coughed and pretended to not have seen anything.

Zu An thought of something. He remarked with a smile, “Hm? The two of you came today, but why don’t I see Miss Zheng here?”

Zheng Dan’s heart was about to pop out of her chest. Why does this guy keep talking about our sore spot? He’s completely playing with fire!

Sang Qien gradually recovered her composure and said, “My sister-in-law left earlier. Right, did she come and visit you?” She looked around as she spoke.

Zu An replied with a smile, “Why would your sister-in-law come to find me?”

Sang Qien remarked with an ambiguous smile, “Who knows? You and my sister-in-law are… very good friends, right?”

Zheng Dan held her head in her arms. This little sister-in-law of hers was way too smart! She always felt that this girl actually knew something.

Zu An laughed and said, “But of course! I was locked up in the same cell with your sister-in-law for so long on our way to the capital, so we’ve gone through some stuff together. Of course we’re good friends. I’m also good friends with Miss Qien.”

Zheng Dan blushed when she heard those words. The scene of the two of them sitting together in the carriage resurfaced. This guy really is a little rascal!

Sang Qien harrumphed. Like hell I’d want to be that kind of good friend with you!

Sang Hong had his eyes closed, as if he were taking a moment to rest. Suddenly, though, he looked toward the screen and remarked, “So Sir Zu had another guest over right now. I wonder who it is?”

Zheng Dan’s heart pounded quickly. With Sang Hong’s cultivation, he had obviously noticed her.

Sang Qien suddenly looked toward the screen. Her expression became conflicted. What if it really is sister-in-law? What do we do then?

Zheng Dan was so nervous she almost fainted on the spot. Her head rang with noise. What would she do if her father-in-law and sister-in-law found out?!

Even though her entire marriage with Sang Qian now looked like a farce, and it was mainly in name, the key was that she still hadn’t formally broken things off. If she were found out here, it wouldn’t just be her reputation, but the entire Zheng clan’s reputation that would be ruined.

Zu An said with a smile, “I couldn't deceive Sir Sang after all. The one inside is Chu Chuyan. She just came to visit me. The two of us were just about to get intimate when you two came, so she’s a bit embarrassed.”

Sang Qien harrumphed. Who do you think you’re fooling? Chu First Miss is in Brightmoon City right now, why would she be here?

Sang Hong’s eyes twitched. He obviously didn’t believe that it was Chu Chuyan. It was more likely to be his daughter-in-law Zheng Dan. He actually didn’t really mind the two of them having some relationship in private; since his son was already dead anyway, he could then make full use of his daughter-in-law, turning her into the link that tied Zu An to the Sang clan.

But that couldn't happen out in the open. It would have been crossing the line a bit if Zu An told him that he had been intimate with Zheng Dan just a moment ago.

When he saw Sang Hong’s change in expression, Zu An replied with a smile, “Then should I call Chu Chuyan out to say hello? We’re all acquaintances already, anyway.”

Sang Hong’s expression changed again. He quickly said, “There’s no need.”

Sang Qien also quickly added, “I’m sorry for bothering you. Should we come back at a different time?” She turned to leave after speaking. She really didn’t know what she'd do if Zheng Dan came out at that moment. Her dad was so old already, too. What if he ended up getting a stroke?

But Zu An wasn’t willing to give up and said, “Sigh, of course we should all say hello! Or else you’ll think your sister-in-law is here.” He walked over to the screen and pulled Zheng Dan out as he spoke.

Zheng Dan’s mind went completely blank. What is he doing? Why does he want me to meet the two of them? I’m completely done for… I can’t even go out in public anymore…

But she didn’t display her anger or mockery. The entire room became completely silent. She had been the boss of one of Brightmoon City’s gangs, so her control over her emotions was exceptional. She had to deal with this matter sooner or later, so she’d just do it now.

But right before she spoke, she saw the Sang clan’s father and daughter look at her in shock. Sang Hong exclaimed, “So it was Chu First Miss! We father and daughter have been really rude just now. We hope you don’t take offense.”

Zheng Dan was stunned. Zu An patted her hand and replied, “We’re all friends here, so why are we treating each other like strangers? Why has Sir Sang visited us today?”

Zheng Dan sat down off to the side, puzzled. Countless possibilities flashed through her mind. Why would the Sang clan’s father and daughter call me Chu First Miss? Don’t tell me they’re playing along with Zu An just because they really don’t want to create a fuss in public? Ahh, I’m going to die from embarrassment… Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“We mainly came to pay you a visit and bring you some medicine.” Sang Hong gestured toward his daughter as he spoke.

Sang Qien snapped out of her daze and quickly handed over the gifts they had prepared, explaining, “This bottle of Thousand Year Snow Moon Extract is something my father unintentionally stumbled upon many years ago. It has excellent effects for restoring the body, so we hope it can be of help to big brother Zu.” She felt quite strange. Why had Chu First Miss not said anything? Furthermore, her expression seemed a bit different from usual.

When he saw Sang Qien’s strange expression, Zu An said with a smile, “Little sister Qien’er’s arms are even fairer than this Thousand Year Snow Moon Extract.”

Sang Qien’s face immediately flushed red, and she pulled back her hands at once. Her attention was diverted, as expected.

You really are a brute… Who wants to be your little sister Qien’er?! Do you think I’m as easy to trick as sister-in-law?... Her thoughts continued to go on and on like a broken record.

Sang Hong had a strange look on his face when he saw the scene. He thought to himself, I already gave away a daughter-in-law. Don’t tell me I have to give away my daughter too? He coughed lightly and asked, “Ah Zu, do you know why his majesty didn’t openly blame King Qi?”
