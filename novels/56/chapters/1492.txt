“Ah!”

“No!”

“Don’t look!”

The three women all cried out in alarm as their dresses were blown all over the place because of Grandgale. If they had been in their normal long dresses, the wind wouldn’t have done much at all. However, because of the heat, they had all had their dresses cut. Now, they were all in skirts, so what were they supposed to do about the wind? They all pushed down their fluttering skirts, flustered. At the same time, they looked at Zu An with shame and annoyance.

Zu An really wanted to say that he hadn’t seen anything, but at their cultivation rank, how could he possibly not see? The classic scene of Marilyn Monroe from his previous world had left such a deep impression on people. He hadn’t expected to receive a similar blessing one day.

He was about to explain himself when blood shot out from his nose, causing the three women to immediately speak out together in condemnation. In the end, he had no choice but to beg for mercy before saying, “I’ll head upward to take a look at the Golden Crow situation.”

He had the Wind Fire Wheels, so it was easier for him to move around than the others. Thus, he left the tornado and flew up while riding on the Wind Fire Wheels. The three women couldn't be bothered to blame him further, and all watched him depart worriedly.

Zu An felt his body growing hotter and hotter. In that instant, he almost felt like Icarus from Greek mythology, who fell to his death after the sun burned his wings to nothing.

Fortunately, his body was tough, and he used the Heaven Devouring Sutra to suck away the heat shining down on his body and ingeniously eliminate it. Just like that, he continued flying through the air. In the three women’s eyes, his figure grew smaller and smaller in the distance. Even with their powerful sight, they practically couldn't see him anymore.

However, Zu An noticed that he was still far away from the Golden Crows. He was alarmed. The Golden Crows weren’t as far away as the sun was from the Earth in his previous world, right?

Hm? Wait. I don’t think I’ve ever left the scope of this planet yet…

He had seen many pictures of Earth from space, and yet he had never experienced a similar perspective in this world even though he could fly!

He gritted his teeth when he thought of that, deciding to continue upward. At his cultivation rank, he didn’t need to breathe externally, and could make that an entirely internal process. Together with his tough body, the vacuum of space wouldn’t be able to hurt him right away. Thus, he wanted to take the chance to see just what was going on with this world.

He continued to fly for a while. According to his estimations, he should have already left the atmosphere, and yet there was still only a boundless sky above him.

Suddenly, powerful winds swept past Zu An. Wherever they touched him, his skin began to crack apart. He was alarmed, quickly using the Primordial Origin Sutra to repair his body. Then, he tried to grit his teeth and continue flying upward.

However, bursts of purple lightning suddenly surrounded him. Many of them even seemed to hide human figures and palaces within. The terrifying pressure made all of his hair stand on end. He realized that if he were to be struck by the lightning, he could die on the spot. He was so scared that he didn’t dare to continue.

Thus, he quickly used Grandgale to pull back. The surrounding winds immediately weakened considerably, but there was still one arc of lightning that struck his body. His entire body trembled, and he almost fell from the sky.

Without pausing for a second, he immediately used the Heaven Devouring Sutra to lead the lightning elsewhere. At the same time, he frantically absorbed primordial ki to repair his body.

The power of the lightning weakened significantly compared to what he had felt before. However, that was likely because he had withdrawn promptly; otherwise, if he had continued up and was really hit by the lightning, the consequences would be too horrible to contemplate.

When Zu An flew back to the tornado, the three women jumped in fright when they saw his charred black face. They were about to ask him what happened, but Zu An’s head tilted to one side, and he plummeted from above.

The three women quickly caught him. At this point, they couldn't be bothered by that kind of physical contact.

Yun Jianyue examined the scorched traces on Zu An’s body. Her expression suddenly changed.

Yan Xuehen also turned toward her and remarked, “This is the aura of heavenly tribulation lightning!”

Yu Yanluo had no idea what they were talking about. However, they didn’t have time to explain it to her as they both used their skills to help him recover.

A while later, Zu An finally began to wake up again. From his head to his elbows, to the rest of his body, he felt as if he were surrounded by soft clouds. He could smell an incredible fragrance all around him.

He suddenly realized something, finally understanding what was going on. He really didn’t want to get up and let it end.

“Brat, stop pretending. I already saw your eyes move,” Yun Jianyue said, bonking him on the head, but she didn’t use that much strength.

Zu An opened his eyes, saying, in embarrassment, “I only did that because I was worried that all of you would be embarrassed…”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Do you know what kind of situation you were in? And yet, you’re still thinking about those things? What did you end up experiencing just now?”

Zu An put away his smile and told them seriously about his experiences.

When they heard what had happened, Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue’s expressions became a bit strange. They began, “Should we scold you or laugh at you? You’re already a master rank cultivator, and yet you don’t even have basic common sense! Forget about you, not even an earth immortal can break through the screen in the heavens above.”

“Not even an earth immortal?” Zu An asked, shocked.

“Why else do you think it would be called ascending to the heavens?” Yan Xuehen replied. She explained, “There are actually records of this in the cultivation world. The farther up you go, the more powerful the devastating astral winds and heavenly lightning become. From ancient times until now, there have been countless geniuses who have attempted to surpass them, and yet not a single one has succeeded. There are some who suspect that this world is actually nothing more than a cage.”

“The reason why we didn’t stop you is because this is a secret dungeon, and thus not a complete world. Besides, it was possible that, because of the deficient nature of the laws of this world, it wouldn’t be that dangerous. How could we have expected that you would be so stubborn? You already encountered the astral winds and heavenly lightning, and yet you still went straight in,” Yun Jianyue said. Her tone made it sound as if she were scolding him, but it also carried a hint of worry.

Zu An chuckled in embarrassment. He wasn’t someone from this world in the end, and his strength had increased too quickly. He didn’t cultivate according to the same traditions as other people in this world, which was why he lacked some common knowledge.

He wondered, “But then, if I can’t even get close to those Golden Crows, are they already legendary immortals?”

The three women were all stunned. They suddenly realized that terrifying reality. Even though all of the monsters they had encountered along the way were formidable, the group had still been able to deal with them without too much difficulty by working together.

That was why they had subconsciously assumed the Golden Crows to be on the same level as those monsters. However, even though the Golden Crows were also monsters that had laid the groundwork for Yi’s heroic path, that didn’t mean that their strength was the same.

Furthermore, judging from everything they had seen, the Golden Crows could very well be the Fiend Emperor’s ancestors. The Fiend Emperor was already an earth immortal, so how weak could his ancestors possibly be?

When they thought of that, their expressions became a bit ugly. The atmosphere immediately turned grave.

Yan Xuehen suddenly shook her head, saying, “I think not. If they had already become immortals, it would be completely impossible for us to win. This mission would have been completely impossible for us from the start. Shun would not have sent us on a task that could not be completed.”

“That’s hard to say,” Yun Jianyue said with a sneer. “It might be that he wanted to send us to our deaths.”

Yan Xuehen wondered with a frown, “Who in the world would harm others without any benefit to themselves?”

“Come over to our Holy Sect. I promise you that in a single year, you’ll see something similar every single day,” Yun Jianyue remarked, snorting disdainfully at her naivety.

“He’s still hoping for us to get revenge for him, or set him free,” Zu An said quietly. However, he felt that Shun wouldn’t be that kind of person. He continued, “Either way, we’ve already come so far. Let’s give that Scalding Valley a look first.”

The three women knew that was the case, so they weren’t opposed to it. However, their expressions no longer contained pride and satisfaction with their accomplishments so far, and became extremely grave instead. Even the rate at which Zu An glanced at their thighs decreased by a tenth.

…

A while later, the winds around them gradually became weaker. Yu Yanluo suddenly pointed into the distance and called out, “Look over there!”

The others followed Yu Yanluo’s directions and saw a giant tree that towered into the sky, splendid and magnificent.
