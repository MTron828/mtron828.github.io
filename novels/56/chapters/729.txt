Chapter 712: Reward

Translator: Pika

Zu An took a deep breath. “In the end, it was because you’re too smart for your own good. You just had to add that you were a virgin. That was just too forced.”

“Originally, my impression of you was that of a noble person of naturally high status. Even when you removed all of your clothing without any reservations before me, it matched that type of style. However, you insisted that you had nothing to do with the crown prince, which instantly made you seem like a young lady who had just awakened her feelings of love. This sudden change didn’t really mesh well, so I couldn’t help but start to worry.”

The crown princess’ face turned red. “I already went this far, and yet you’re still analyzing everything so coldly. Are you even a man at this point?!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Zu An smiled. “Didn’t you already find out whether or not I was a man earlier?”

The crown princess recalled that scene she had seen when she just woke up. Her expression grew strange. This guy is like a freaking donkey! If he isn’t a man, then no one else could possibly be male.

Zu An continued, “I was already beginning to feel vigilant when you silenced those Embroidered Envoys. After all, they didn’t know your identity, and they could only give tiny clues, but you still killed them. So how could you possibly feel at ease about someone like me, who experienced the entire event?”

“That’s why the more gently you treated me, the more worried I became.” Zu An chuckled. “Of course, the reason you even managed to lead me on to this extent is that I’m just too outstanding. Pretty girls can’t help but end up liking me. I thought that was what was going on here.”

The crown princess was silent. This guy really is shameless to an unimaginable level.

“Woman, tell me, how should I deal with you?” Zu An reached out and grabbed her chin, raising her head up. Unfortunately, the crown princess stubbornly jerked her head to the side. She was clearly full of unwillingness and anger.

You have successfully trolled Bi Linglong for +233 +233 +233…

Zu An’s face turned cold. He exerted force, roughly turning her head back around. “Woman, you don’t seem to understand your current situation.”

The crown princess sneered. “What, could it be that you would dare to kill me?”

Zu An frowned. To be honest, this is indeed a bit difficult… Her status is too special.

The crown princess laughed in contempt when she saw his hesitation. “Of course you wouldn’t dare. Hurry up and release me. Let’s just pretend that nothing happened. My promise towards you before is still in effect. I’ll do my best to promote you and advance your career.”

Zu An sighed. “Indeed, I can’t kill you. However, by provoking me like this… It seems you’re not aware that there’s something else I can do to you?”

“What?” The crown princess’ heart began to pound as she began to have a bad premonition.

Zu An revealed an evil grin. He reached his hand toward her neck and began to gently massage it. “If I force you to sleep with me here, what else can you do about it?”

“You dare?!” The crown princess’ expression changed. This guy was a disgusting pervert after all!

You have successfully trolled Bi Linglong for +444 +444 +444…

Zu An shrugged. “And why wouldn’t I? Either way, we would be the only ones to know. Knowing you, even if I did something to you, out of consideration for your identity, for the Bi clan, or even for your own ambitions, you wouldn’t disclose anything. Am I wrong?”

The crown princess’ face changed several times. Even though she didn’t want to admit it, most of what he said was true. Could she really go all out and accuse him? If she did that, then she would be finished, and so would the Bi clan.

Zu An laughed when he saw her changing expression. He raised her chin and gave her a strong kiss.

“Mmm…!” The crown princess struggled fiercely. The last time they had kissed was because they wanted to make it past Zhuxie Chixin. Now, they were in private. How could she agree to this type of thing?

Zu An pulled away from her lips. He said with a smile, “This is your punishment for trying to kill me. The next time you think of something like that, I won’t be so polite.”

The crown princess fell weakly onto her bed and began to whimper, “I was sleeping with you without any clothes until the moment I woke up. Then, you groped and kissed me. If you were me, what would you do? I carry the clan’s glory on my shoulders! If something happened, everyone in the Bi clan would be silenced. How could I take that gamble? Of course killing you was the safest choice!”

She had experienced more danger in the last few hours than she’d had in the last decade or so of her life. She had gone through a rollercoaster of emotion, and now, she finally collapsed.

Zu An remained silent. He knew that if it were anyone else, they probably would have made the same choice. That was human nature.

Furthermore, he had taken advantage of her today, which was why he didn’t get too upset. However, he obviously wouldn’t admit to that. “You also touched and kissed me. Is my purity not worth anything? Do you see me crying like you?”

The crown princess couldn’t even cry anymore when she heard Zu An’s words. After a long time passed, she gloomily said, “You really are shameless!”

Suddenly, there was clamoring outside. A voice called out, “Who are you people? You dare barge into the eastern palace?!”

Shi Jun could be heard saying, “We received a report from the guards that the crown princess was kidnapped by a man. That’s why we came to check on the crown princess’ safety.”

Zu An and the crown princess exchanged a look. “They didn’t find us out there, so they came back here to prove you weren’t in the eastern palace.”

“Concubine Bai, that bitch really wants to kill me!” the crown princess exclaimed angrily.

“Scoundrels, is the crown princess’ personal chamber a place you all can barge into just because you want to?” Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun asked. They were clearly the ones stopping the intruders.

“Hmph, I’m in charge of inspecting the palace, so of course I have the authority to do that! Why are you giving me so many excuses? Is it because there’s something shameful you can’t let others know about?” Shi Jun replied arrogantly. He had been born under an influential clan, and he had a high status himself. He obviously didn’t care much about two small guards.

“The ones Sir Shi inspects should be outer subjects, right? When have the palace’s women been a part of Sir Shi’s management?” a female voice said.

The crown princess’ eyes lit up. That was her personal maid Rong Mo. Looks like this girl isn’t stupid. She didn’t find me in the Hundred Flower Palace, so she came back to stabilize the situation here.

Another female voice said, “Sir Shi is only concerned about the crown princess’ safety, so we should confirm this properly. Could it be that you don’t even trust me?”

The crown princess’ expression changed. She said quietly, “That’s his majesty's Concubine Shu. You should leave through the secret passage.” All of their efforts would be wasted if they saw Zu An here.

“Okay!” Zu An didn’t hesitate at all. He immediately prepared to leave through the passage by the bed.

“Wait!” The crown princess grabbed him. “Unblock their acupoints first, but don’t let them see you.”

Zu An praised the crown princess’ attention to detail internally. He nodded, transforming into afterimages. He undid the servants’ seals, and then leapt into the secret passage.

The crown princess quickly began sealing the secret tunnel again. However, Zu An suddenly turned around and gave her a kiss. “I’ll just treat this as my reward for saving you!” Then, he left with a laugh.

The crown princess clutched her mouth. She was ashamed and panicky. This guy! I have to pay him back later! But she couldn’t be bothered to be angry right now. She quickly sorted out the bedding. She couldn’t let anyone else know about the existence of this secret passage.

The door slammed open as soon as she finished fixing the bed. It was clear that Rong Mo, Piao Duandiao, and Jiao Sigun couldn’t stop Concubine Shu and Shi Jun’s combined forces.

The crown prince was also there, but he really was a good-for-nothing! Not only had he not stopped them, he had even followed these two excitedly as if there were some drama to watch. The crown princess was seething with rage when she saw his expression. No matter how much of a rascal Zu An was, he was still far more reliable than this guy.

Concubine Shu and Shi Jun barged in looking as if they were already confident in their victory. However, when they saw the crown princess sitting on the bed, they were completely stupefied. “Why… Why are you here?”

The crown princess replied coldly, “What, is there something wrong with me being in my own chambers?”

…

Meanwhile, Zu An had just exited the other end of the secret passage. He could sense that there were people everywhere in the imperial palace. He knew that all of the guards in the imperial palace were searching for any suspicious personnel. Furthermore, the palace gates were already shut, so he abandoned all thoughts of leaving the palace.

He found a secluded place to change into his Embroidered Envoy uniform, becoming Golden Token Eleven once more.

I wonder what the crown princess’ reaction would be if she finds out I’m Golden Token Eleven.

He grinned when he felt the lingering sweetness on his lips. Even though today had been quite dangerous, all in all, it wasn’t that bad. He headed toward his own little courtyard and decided to just spend the night there to ride the storm out.

But he was stunned as soon as he approached his courtyard. He noticed that there were quite a few people waiting to ambush him.
