Chapter 1710: King Guangling

The two of them talked for a while longer until drowsiness gradually overtook Concubine Bai. After all, she had been sealed, and had also gone through such a frightening experience. Later, she had even eaten a drug that activated her hidden potential. Her body was a bit weak as a result. Thus, she unwittingly fell asleep.

Zu An didn’t really mind, and continued cultivating while meditating. Nothing melodramatic or intimate happened all night. Concubine Bai didn’t invite him into the bed with her and slept soundly from start to finish, and she actually slept quite well. She was quite the quiet sleeper, not exposing her thighs in the middle of the night or anything like that.

Zu An remained completely calm. He wasn’t as inexperienced as he had been in the past, when he would have been hopeful for those kinds of things.

The next morning, when Concubine Bai woke up, she was startled at first. However, when she saw that Zu An was still seated in the same position, as steady as a boulder, she smiled. It had been a long time since she had last slept so well. She was actually quite surprised at herself. As someone from the Devil Sect and a survivor of a place as dangerous as the Imperial Palace for so many years, she actually trusted a man like this…

Zu An sensed her movements and opened his eyes, asking, “You’re awake?”

“Yes,” Concubine Bai replied, feeling a bit embarrassed. After all, she felt as if these were words that a married couple would say to each other. Just how many women would reveal such an intimate sight in front of a man?

“Then let’s clean up and prepare to set out. If I’m not mistaken, Eunuch Wen should have already informed the surrounding guards,” Zu An said as he got up. Daytime was different from nighttime. The patrolling soldiers were far more tense at night. In order to guard against any potential dangers, they paid far more attention to any suspicious behavior. In the day, however, they were more relaxed.

“Am I going to leave just like this?” Concubine Bai asked, and was about to put on her clothes when Zu An stopped her.

“You should put on Nanny Ping’s outfit again. Just in case, you should act like a corpse,” Zu An said. That way, just in case someone checked in on them, he would be able to explain things.

“Okay,” Concubine Bai said, although she felt an instinctive rejection of Nanny Ping’s clothes. They were dirty and oily, and they also had a strange smell. However, she understood the seriousness of the issue and didn’t refuse.

Zu An took out a small chest. After some hesitation, he said, “I’ll have to trouble you to lie inside here. I don’t know if you’ll fit. If it’s too small, I’ll look for a larger one.”

Even though he stored all kinds of daily use items in the Brilliant Glass Bead, who in the world would always keep a chest nearby to store a corpse with them? Even this chest was something he had barely managed to find.

Concubine Bai looked at the chest in surprise and asked, “Would such a small chest be able to hold Nanny Ping? Won’t people grow suspicious?”

“It’s precisely because it’s small that people won’t suspect that there’s someone inside. As for Nanny Ping’s body being too large, either way, it’s already a corpse to those in the know. It should be able to just barely fit.”

“Then what about my corpse? Won’t they suspect that?” Concubine Bai asked worriedly. She’d naturally be fine once she escaped, but Zu An might get in trouble.

Zu An showed her a small bottle in his hand and said, “Eunuch Wen gave this to me yesterday. It’s some kind of corpse-dissolving powder. You are a palace concubine, after all. Even if you die, your corpse can’t be wantonly touched by men. So, your body was supposed to be dissolved completely to take care of the situation.”

The medicine was extremely precious, and he only had enough to dissolve a single corpse. As for why Eunuch Wen hadn’t done the deed himself, it could be because he didn’t want to get involved too heavily and end up being killed down the line by the emperor. He had already remained in the Imperial Palace for many years, and so had already become a cunning old fox.

Concubine Bai was full of admiration. She said, “This situation that already left me in absolute despair has been dealt with so smoothly and rationally. It really is inconceivable.”

“Alright, enough with the flattery already. Can you fit inside?” Zu An asked worriedly.

“It should be fine,” Concubine Bai said with a blush. Then, under Zu An’s shocked gaze, she first sat down in the chest, and her body trembled. Her legs moved behind her head, while her arms wrapped around her body and twisted at an exaggerated angle. In the end, she contorted herself into a sphere.

Zu An was a bit absent-minded as he looked at the bowling ball-shaped woman in front of him. He remarked, “Now this is what I call inconceivable.”

Concubine Bai said in embarrassment, “My body is a bit more flexible than usual, and I learned some body arts in the Holy Sect. That’s why I’m able to do this.”

Zu An thought to himself, How is this just a bit more flexible? You’re already practically boneless.

Just who the heck came up with the Devil Sect’s skills? Whether it’s Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei’s charm skills, or Concubine Bai’s body arts, they really are lethal to all men!

“I’ve scared you, haven’t I?” Concubine Bai asked, feeling a bit worried when she saw his stupefied appearance.

“Not at all. It’s incredible,” Zu An said sincerely with a sigh of admiration.

Now, it was Concubine Bai’s turn to be embarrassed. Being stared at like this made her feel as if all her secrets had been completely exposed.

Fortunately, Zu An quickly snapped out of his daze and took out the Fake Death Pill Ji Xiaoxi had given him. He said, “Eat this. You’ll quickly enter a fake death state. That way, no one will be able to sense your aura anymore.”

There would be many strong individuals in the emperor’s procession. If her aura were exposed, many imperial guards could realize that there was someone living inside. All of their efforts would be in vain then.

Concubine Bai nodded and swallowed the pill without any hesitation. She knew she wouldn’t be aware of anything else that happened once she took the pill. Still, she felt that this man in front of her was worthy of her trust.

When he saw her gradually fall asleep, to the point that even her heartbeat and breath were almost nonexistent, Zu An sighed inwardly. Xiaoxi’s drug really is incredible. He couldn't help but touch his lips when he remembered that kind and pure little lady. He still remembered the soft sensation from when she had given him the drug. He really owed her a lot. But this world was so big, he didn’t know when he would next meet her.

After sorting out his thoughts, he closed the container and brought Concubine Bai outside. He had to admit that her body was really light. It was almost as if the chest didn’t have any weight at all.

The camp was packing up to move again, so the surroundings were a bit noisy. However, the trip was quite smooth. Perhaps because Eunuch Wen had already informed the others, none of the imperial guards stopped him.

However, when Zu An reached the outermost area of the camp, there just happened to be troops passing by. The one in the lead was clad in golden armor and had sharp eyes. They were a group of elite troops.

Zu An cried out inwardly because the other figure was King Guangling, Zhao Yuan. He led the most elite troop of the entire Imperial Guard. Their status was quite a bit higher than his own Armed Escort Division. Most importantly, this man had always been on good terms with King Qi. The two of them were more than allies.

Sure enough, Zhao Yuan frowned when he saw Zu An, calling out, “Halt. State your intent!”

“Does General Zhao have guidance for me?” Zu An replied, not calling him by his noble title so as to not lose out in his presence. After all, their official ranks were similar, and between that and his position in the Eastern Palace, perhaps he was even ranked a bit higher.

“So it was Sir Zu,” Zhao Yuan said, pretending to have just recognized who he was. “I wonder what Sir Zu is doing in such haste?”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“There is a matter that requires me to make a trip outside,” Zu An said, feeling a bit regretful. If he had known that it would be like this, he would have changed into his Golden Token Envoy attire. Then, no one would dare to question him. He thought, Sigh, I’ve made a blunder!

“The army is about to set out. Could it be that Sir Zu’s matter is more important than his majesty’s procession?” Zhao Yuan said in surprise. Then, his gaze moved to the chest in Zu An’s hands. “I wonder what is stored in Sir Zu’s chest?”

The chest was a bit conspicuous, so it was hard to not notice it.

“There is no need to try to pressure me with his majesty’s name. I am precisely acting under his majesty’s orders. There is something related to my task inside,” Zu An said unhappily. “Could it be that the general wishes to look inside?”

“If Sir Zu doesn’t mind, then please open it up for us to examine,” Zhao Yuan said with an apologetic expression. “Please do not feel offended, as this is just procedure. Anything and anyone that leaves must be examined. I am not only targeting Sir Zu.”

Even though that was what he said, his expression seemed to be saying ‘I am targeting you; what are you going to do about it?’
