Chapter 1179: Keep a Secret

“Can you stay still, please? You are making me all annoyed from pacing back and forth,” Yan Xuehen snapped. For some reason, she just felt a bit fidgety.

But not only did Yun Jianyue not stop when she heard that, she even deliberately walked over to pace around Yan Xuehen. She said tauntingly, “I’m going to pace around right in front of you. What are you going to do about it? Are you going to bite me?”

Yan Xuehen was speechless. She cried, “You damn witch, how did you end up becoming just as shameless as Zu An?”

Yun Jianyue was stunned. Her actions were indeed a bit similar to that damn brat’s. She thought, Don’t tell me I’ve already unknowingly become affected by him? She blushed and quickly tried to hide it, retorting, “Shameless woman, aren’t you always bragging about how emotionless you are? Why is it so easy to make you angry then?”

Yan Xuehen was momentarily distracted. It seemed as if ever since she had met Zu An, ripples had begun affecting her previously calm mind. When she thought of that, a mouthful of blood suddenly filled her throat.

Yun Jianyue jumped in fright, shouting, “What’s up with you?!”

“Nothing,” Yan Xuehen replied, wiping the corners of her lips with a grave expression. Her Unshaken Daoist Manual could quickly increase her cultivation, but strong emotions were taboo. She could already feel her cultivation becoming a bit unstable.

Yun Jianyue was about to say something, but she suddenly stopped. She turned to one side and listened carefully, asking, “Do you hear something?”

“What?” Yan Xuehen replied, snapping out of her daze and thinking, Did some worms manage to get away? But instead of the rustling noises from before, she heard some faintly audible moans.

Even though they were seriously injured, they were still grandmasters. Their gazes quickly turned to the lakeside.

Yun Jianyue exclaimed in annoyance, “That damn brat! He told us to wait here while he went down there to enjoy himself?!”

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +666 +666 +666…

Yan Xuehen’s cheeks also turned red. Even though she remained pure, she had lived for a long time. She naturally guessed what was happening below. It made her feel extremely strange, though. According to the original plan, she was supposed to have been the one who engaged in intertwined cultivation with him. Yet now, it had become him and Yu Yanluo! Why do I feel so strange?

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +666 +666 +666…

Yun Jianyue managed to recover more quickly. She said, “Even though that guy is perverted, he wouldn’t go so far as to take advantage of others. Don’t tell me he’s treating Yu Yanluo right now?”

Regardless of which one it was, she really had to protect Honglei better. This fella really does take the purity of women as if it’s nothing! He even dared to do this kind of thing in front of two grandmasters.

Yan Xuehen thought back to everything that had happened. She nodded as well, saying, “He is indeed not that kind of person.”

Yun Jianyue was a bit surprised, saying, “I’m surprised you’re speaking up for him.”

“I am just speaking the truth,” Yan Xuehen said indifferently. “But I did not expect him to actually know an intertwined cultivation method.”

Yun Jianyue was a bit worried too. She said, “His body is on the verge of collapse, so how can he save someone else? Furthermore, Yu Yanluo was about to give out too… There’s no way she could be saved just by relying on intertwined cultivation!”

Their injuries were different. Even though Zu An had been seriously injured, he still had a bit of vigorous life force within him. On the contrary, Yu Yanluo’s life force was on the verge of fading at any moment.

With their strength, they would have at least fifty percent chance of successfully healing the wounded Zu An. But even if they were male and in their best condition, the chances of them saving Yu Yanluo would have been infinitely close to zero.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It might just be their final exchange of feelings before they pass away,” Yun Jianyue said. After thinking for a long time, she could only think of that reason. “But Yu Yanluo is already in that kind of state; how can she handle such tossing and turning? That brat really is a rascal.”

Yan Xuehen’s expression was also strange. She thought back to the couple’s previous intimate interactions and said, “But Yu Yanluo should be willing.”

Yun Jianyue sat down next to her and said, “Sigh, the two of us really are quite the troubled sisters here. We actually ended up guarding another couple’s bedroom.”

Yan Xuehen was speechless. She could only reply, “You can think that if you want. I am going to focus on my wounds; do not bother me.” She closed her eyes to rest after saying that. However, when she recalled what the two of them were doing down there, she couldn’t calm down at all.

Yun Jianyue began feeling bored, but she didn’t want to meditate and focus on her injuries either. As such, she propped up her chin with her hand and eavesdropped on the rhythm below. Her finger tapped against a stone wall as she suddenly said with a sigh of amazement, “That guy would definitely be really popular as a gigolo.”

A while later, she cried out in alarm, “That Yu Yanluo looks all soft and delicate, but she has quite a bit of endurance!”

…

Yan Xuehen finally couldn't stand it after listening to Yun Jianyue’s endless commentary for some time. Her eyes widened as she glared at the other woman, snapping, “No one will think that you are mute if you stop talking!”

Yun Jianyue wrinkled her nose and said, “I was talking to myself. Who said you could eavesdrop on me?”

“Your voice is so loud; is it really my fault for listening?” Yan Xuehen replied with an icy expression.

Yun Jianyue said with a smile, “Are you taking me for a fool? With our cultivation levels, if we really wanted to focus, would we be bothered by these sounds? That means you’re not calm, and that you wanted to listen to what I was saying.”

Yan Xuehen’s face heated up. She replied, “I just thought that since you were so close, you might suddenly attack me.”

“I’m not that despicable, alright? Even if I want to win, I’ll do it properly,” Yun Jianyue replied, seemingly offended.

Yan Xuehen suddenly frowned and said, “But this really is a bit strange. Are they not taking far too long? It has almost been two hours already.”

Yun Jianyue sneered and said, “Did you forget what Yu Yanluo just said? When the Snake Race does those things, they often continue for several hours. Honestly, I feel as if it’s that brat that’ll give in first.”

Yan Xuehen gave her a look and asked, “Did you forget that Yu Yanluo was wounded?”

Yun Jianyue’s smile froze. She quickly turned back to look at the pond. Right… With her condition, there’s no way she can last that long! With that intensity, she should already have been completely destroyed!

“Don’t tell me Zu An’s treatment really worked?” both women blurted out at the same time.

Yun Jianyue suddenly thought of something and said, “Right, I once heard Honglei mention that your disciple was injured so severely that she was going to become a cripple, and it was hard to say whether she’d even survive, right?”

“Indeed, that seems to have happened, but when I asked her, she did not go into detail and said that it was Divine Physician Ji who saved her. Since her body was fine, I did not ask too much either,” Yan Xuehen replied after a bit of thought. Suddenly, she was shocked. Don’t tell me…

Yun Jianyue was clearly thinking the same thing. She said, “It sounds as if she was saved by that brat Zu An too, and it was precisely through that kind of method!”

Yan Xuehen’s expression changed. It was no wonder that no matter how she asked, Chuyan had still remained hell-bent on staying with him. It turned out there was a deeper reason!

“Alright. If Yu Yanluo can be saved, that’s a good thing too.” Yun Jianyue sighed in relief. She began to wonder how Zu An knew that kind of skill.

Could this be a special effect of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra?

No wonder even the emperor seems to want it.

That kid Honglei is so useless. I taught her the perfect charm technique, yet she was still outdone by someone else in Brightmoon City.

Yan Xuehen’s brows furrowed deeply. With how vigorous Zu An seemed, he was probably fine. Yu Yanluo was probably going to be saved too. Even though Yun Jianyue’s injuries were serious, one day in the future, she would recover.

Only I might die over here.

I can’t have that fellow Zu An, use that method to save me, right…?

She jumped in fright as soon as that thought emerged. She quickly tossed it away. Yet the more she tried to do that, the easier it became for all sorts of scenes to appear in her mind.

Just like that, the two women fell silent.

…

Some time passed, and the noise below only became more and more intense. Yun Jianyue’s eyes twitched. She finally couldn't take it anymore and roared at the pond, “Damn brat, are you freaking done yet? How much longer are you going to keep going?!”

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +777 +777 +777…

Silence fell for a moment. Zu An’s guilty voice called out from below, “Almost, almost…”

Yan Xuehen covered her mouth and smiled. This was the first time she had found her adversary Yun Jianyue so refreshing.

Some more time passed. The waters finally parted, and Zu An brought Yu Yanluo out. Zu An appeared to be completely at ease, while Yu Yanluo was hiding behind him, not daring to look at the two women at all.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue’s eyes widened. Yu Yanluo could actually stand on her own! Even though the way she walked was a bit strange, she could move on her own. And yet, she had looked as if she might pass away at any time previously!

This kid Zu An really is that awesome?

Yu Yanluo pinched Zu An’s waist when she saw the two’s vicious gazes. It’s all this guy’s fault! He just kept going again and again. I’m so embarrassed…

Zu An crossed his arms and looked at the two grandmasters vigilantly, asking, “What are you two doing…?”

Yan Xuehen awkwardly shifted her gaze, her cheeks turning a bit pink. Meanwhile, Yun Jianyue said with a sigh, “So you were actually a human-shaped spiritual medicine, brat? If news of this got out, people would probably squeeze you dry.”

Zu An said with an embarrassed smile, “My constitution and the technique I cultivate are a bit special. I can save women who are injured externally or internally. I hope you big sisters can protect this secret of mine.”

But Yun Jianyue refused, replying, “No way, unless you agree to a condition of mine!”
