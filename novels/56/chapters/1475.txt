Chapter 1424: Bewitching Dance

Yun Jianyue looked incredibly seductive, and yet she didn’t really show anything either. The only part that could be considered revealing was her delicate collarbones.

Zu An remembered Qiu Honglei previously telling him that showing one’s chest was something only those at the lowest level would do. The higher level one’s charm skill reached, the purer one would become, and the more aloof and transcendent they would be.

In fact, according to that standard, Yan Xuehen was actually at the highest level too. That was why, when Yun Jianyue had first appeared, she had immediately been mistaken for Yan Xuehen.

Of course, Yan Xuehen’s personality was much more indifferent and cold. In contrast, Yun Jianyue instead revealed charming traits that could tug at others’ heartstrings. Forget about men, even Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo’s hearts began beating quickly when they saw her.

“What kind of expression is that? Can I not choose to be feminine if I want to?” Yun Jianyue snapped, her eyes widening.

Zu An sighed and said, “The big sis Yun we know has returned. To be honest, that really is hard to get used to.”

“What, do I not look good right now?” Yun Jianyue asked. Her brows furrowed a bit, and she sounded a bit nervous.

Zu An couldn't help but laugh, replying, “How could that be? Whether it’s your current self or your past self, both are devastatingly beautiful. If anyone dared to say you aren’t pretty, they would have to be blind.”

Yun Jianyue now felt happy, replying,“Damn brat, no wonder you were able to trick so many girls. That mouth of yours is simply slathered with honey. Your ways are useless against me, though.”

“Is that so? Why is there a huge smile on your face then?” Yan Xuehen retorted, ruthlessly exposing her.

“Hmph, can I interpret that as you being jealous? I’m not going to lower myself to your level,” Yun Jianyue said. She was in a good mood and surprisingly didn’t get angry.

“Me? Jealous of you?” Yan Xuehen exclaimed in annoyance. For some reason, when she saw Zu An praising Yun Jianyue with ‘flattery’, she felt angry inside. Even though she knew that there wasn’t anything wrong with Zu An’s praise, she just felt that he was kissing up to her rival.

“You’re jealous that I can have the same temperament as you, right? It’s just that I don’t feel like doing that stuff you do,” Yun Jianyue said disdainfully.

Yan Xuehen laughed, retorting, “Sure, then why not use this act once we get out? I will be sure to introduce everyone to the Devil Sect Master’s other side.”

“Hmph, I don’t want to be like you and those other hypocrites,” Yun Jianyue said. She knew she had to use her charm skill continuously to maintain such a state. She felt disgusted when she thought of having to use a charm skill on people she usually looked down on.

Zu An quickly interrupted them, saying, “Ahem, we should focus on preparing our trap for the Fengxi Boar.”

“Leave that to me,” Yun Jianyue said, smiling proudly. When she passed Zu An, she paused for a moment and told him through ki, “Don’t forget what you said before.”

Zu An smiled and said, “Don’t worry, I promise I won’t even blink.”

A hint of red flashed across Yun Jianyue’s cheeks. She quickly kicked off the ground and arrived at the top of the tree. Even though the mulberry tree was tall, Yun Jianyue’s movements were light and graceful. The leaves were just like solid ground for her.

After nightfall, the winds became colder and stronger. However, that didn’t affect Yun Jianyue at all. On the contrary, the light fabric of her dress fluttered around, making her look even more like a goddess.

She gave Zu An a deep look, then gently raised her wrist and got on her tiptoes. She was like a soft willow amid a breeze, looking as if she were dancing lightly and gracefully within the moon’s silhouette. As the moonlight shone from behind her, her dress seemed to become translucent, further displaying her sweet, fair, and graceful figure. She almost looked as if she weren’t wearing anything, and yet no one could see anything.

She had a sort of mysterious beauty that tested onlookers’ patience. She didn’t have to do a thing, and yet it was already enough to make their imaginations run wild.

Soon afterward, a gentle and sweet hum began to echo through the entire Mulberry Forest. It wasn’t like any written song; instead, it was more like heavenly music that originated from the soul.

Zu An felt as if his hair had begun to stand on end. Yun Jianyue’s moving dance, together with the voice that made one’s imagination roam, made him feel as if countless succubi had surrounded him, whispering sweet words into his ears. Many lovely scenes immediately appeared in his mind. He even felt as if all of his blood had begun to boil. He unconsciously leaned forward a bit and covered his eyes with his hands, using his sleeves to hide his embarrassment.

This is bad! I’m going to make a fool of myself! Zu An’s heart pounded like a drum. Even with his willpower, he seemed to be on the verge of breaking apart. The worst part was that Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo were right next to him. If he made a fool of himself in front of them, wouldn’t his image be completely ruined?

Despite that, his body refused to remain under his control, and his instinctive reactions ran wild. The only way to just barely stop it was to avoid looking at the woman at the very top of the tree. However, the scene seemed to have some kind of bewitching power, making one completely unwilling to shift one’s gaze away.

If that were all, however, with Zu An’s willpower, he could still just barely look away. However, he had just promised Yun Jianyue not to, so how could he go back on his word?

As such, he just braced himself and continued to watch. Soon afterward, a pair of penetrating, beautiful eyes met his. It turned out Yun Jianyue had always been looking at him! Perhaps it was because she saw how hard-pressed he was, but a proud expression flashed through her eyes. Then, her movements became even gentler.

This woman is playing with fire! Did she forget that I’m her disciple’s man?! Zu An thought, completely covered in sweat.

Meanwhile, Yan Xuehen’s face was also flushed. The memory of the Great Snowy Mountains’ hot springs kept appearing in her mind. She instinctively glanced at the man beside her. At that moment, she was shocked to discover that Yu Yanluo was also looking at Zu An with red cheeks and tender feelings. They were each stunned when they saw how the other was acting.

Yan Xuehen’s heart jumped in alarm. She quickly regained her composure and said, “The Devil Sect’s legendary Bewitching Dance and Charming Voice are outstanding, as expected.”

Yu Yanluo had also remembered her activities with Zu An in the bedroom, so she was lacking in confidence as she exclaimed, “Ah, so this is the legendary Bewitching Dance and Charming Voice!”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

With her status, she had naturally heard of those two astonishing skills. It was rumored that no man could resist their temptation, but she had never met anyone who had experienced them personally. They were probably the Devil Sect’s most mysterious charm skills and definitely wouldn’t be used on ordinary men.

They hadn’t expected to have the fortune of seeing those skills today. Forget about men, even as women they could barely hold on!

Yan Xuehen secretly observed Zu An’s expression. When she saw that he was completely red and sweating madly, she didn’t get angry. Even though he was about to break down, it would be weirder if he didn’t have any reaction.

On the contrary, the fact that he could hold on this long already made his willpower greater than that of countless men. Who would have thought that even though he usually acted so perverted, in reality, he was actually such a gentleman?

Just then, a boar cried out. With the rustling of leaves from the forest, a giant body jumped out and roared toward the woman in the moon. Its small eyes seemed to have already become a bit red.
