Chapter 956: Defending Purity

Chu Youzhao harrumphed. “Even Big Sis isn’t worried, so what is she getting all worried about? Someone who had no idea might think that brother-in-law was her husband instead…”

Zu An couldn't help but smile when he heard her complaint. The two were pretty close in age, so she wasn’t really willing to call Huanzhao her big sister. Of course, with Chu Huanzhao’s temper, she had definitely bullied Youzhao quite a bit back then.

“Stop reading it already! Kick the shuttlecock with me!” Chu Youzhao reached out her hand, about to rip the letter to shreds out of annoyance.

Fortunately, Zu An put the letter away quickly, saying, “Alright, alright. You better not cry when you lose.”

Chu Youzhao wasn’t stupid either and quickly added, “You’re not allowed to use your cultivation!”

“I won’t, I won’t!” Zu An said confidently. Do you really think I can’t deal with a brat like you?

But soon afterward, he was left so regretful his stomach was turning sour. Chu Youzhao was way too flexible and agile, always able to kick the shuttlecock right back at seemingly impossible angles.

Chu Youzhao’s loud and clear laughter echoed throughout the entire courtyard. The maids and servants outside were all whispering among themselves. They had never seen their young master so happy before! But why did their young master’s laughter seem a bit like a girl’s…

After playing with Chu Youzhao for a while, Zu An insisted on leaving despite her asking him to stay. Chu Youzhao still hadn’t had enough fun yet, though. She waved at him from the entrance, calling out, “Brother-in-law, let’s play again next time!”

When he turned around and saw her big smile, Zu An suddenly felt that it didn’t really matter even if he always lost.

“Right, remember to reply to my big sisters! They’re both waiting.” Chu Youzhao remembered what her big sisters had told her when she saw him wave back at her and quickly warned him.

“Got it.” Zu An felt warm inside. He thought to himself, It really is nice to have people who think about you. Sigh, I didn’t even remember to write them a letter and only focused on my own fun and happiness here. What the heck is wrong with me… I have to change my ways. From today on, I need to live my life as a good man. I need to defend my purity! He continued to warn himself.

…

After walking around for a bit, he suddenly noticed a familiar courtyard. After some hesitation, he still decided to walk in that direction. He had to deal with Sang Qien’s situation eventually. He wasn’t someone who would run away after the matter.

Furthermore, the Sang clan was his ally at the moment. It would be much worse if there were some suspicion or negative influence on their relationship later on because of that matter.

…

When he arrived at the Sang clan, Sang Hong and Zheng Dan were both shocked and pleasantly surprised to see him. They both greeted him enthusiastically.

“What about little… sister Qien?” Zu An asked. Why did the way he had always used to call her now sound so strange? He looked from side to side, but he didn’t see Sang Qien anywhere.

“She isn’t feeling well, so she’s resting back in her room,” Sang Hong said with a smile. There was nothing strange that could be seen from his expression.

Zu An was alarmed when he heard that Sang Qien wasn’t feeling well. He obviously knew why she was uncomfortable. He had thought that she was Zheng Dan and tormented her all night. How could a little girl like her possibly handle something like that? He felt more and more guilty when he thought of that. After some thought, he said, “Respected uncle, there’s something I need to tell you.”

Sang Hong looked a bit shocked. He seemed to have thought of something, but he didn’t show it. “Worthy junior, we’re now allies, so our relationship is close. Please speak freely.”

Zu An felt guilty when he saw Sang Hong’s amiable smile. After all, Sang Hong had already tacitly agreed to his and Zheng Dan’s relationship, and yet he had even taken Sang Hong’s daughter. No matter how good their relationship was, they’d probably still have a falling out, right?

He was going to get cut either way, whether he extended his head or shrunk back. He took a deep breath, and eventually said, “Respected uncle, so Little Qien and I…”

“Dad!” A fragile voice interrupted him before he could finish. When those present turned around, they saw Sang Qien standing by the entrance. Her complexion was pale, and there was a hint of fatigue between her brows. Her eyes were red, as if she had just been crying.

“Qien’er.” Sang Hong was a bit surprised to see her. His expression was extremely conflictedd.

Sang Qien ignored him and walked straight to Zu An, asking, “What are you doing here?”

Zheng Dan had a suspicious look on her face. She just felt that the exchange sounded a bit strange for some reason.

It was instead Zu An who was the most shameless. He felt a bit guilty under her stare and said, “I came to clear something up. I need to…”

“There’s nothing that isn’t clear.” Sang Qien cut him off. “Isn’t it fine if we just continue like before? Did you come to discuss your plans in Cloudcenter Commandery?”

“Um… I guess that’s part of it.” Zu An was stunned and replied instinctively.

Just then, Sang Qien said through a ki transmission, “Did you already forget what you promised me? No one is allowed to talk about what happened last night.”

“But that’s not fair to you at all,” Zu An replied.

“There’s no such thing. If you really feel sorry for me, just do what I say. Otherwise, I’ll immediately show you my resolve right here.” Sang Qien’s voice was cold.

“Um… Alright then.” Seeing how firm her attitude was, Zu An could only agree.

“It’s already time for dinner, so big brother Zu should stay here for a meal.” Sang Qien concluded their private chat and spoke out loud.

“Okay.” Zu An felt overwhelmed by her favor. What is she thinking though? Why doesn’t she want me to tell the truth? Wouldn’t she be the one at a loss here then?

A father understood his daughter best. Seeing her behavior, Sang Hong sighed inwardly. His daughter was probably dissatisfied with what he had done and didn’t want to cooperate with the plan to use her as a bargaining chip to threaten Zu An. But how could she know that the more she did that, the better it actually was for the plan?

Then, a maid quickly came over with food and drink. Sang Hong and Zu An chatted happily. There appeared to be nothing strange at all.

Sang Qien felt awful, but she still forced herself to smile and chat with her sister-in-law. Zheng Dan’s eyes darted between the two of them from time to time. She had a pensive look on her face.

A while later, Sang Qien got up and said, “I don’t feel too well, so I’m going to head back first to get some rest.” Sang Hong and Zu An naturally didn’t try to keep her. They both warned her to take good care of herself.

Sang Qien stopped after taking a few steps and said, “Big brother Zu may visit our manor more often to discuss what you need with my father. You can just stay here for the night. After all, there’s no one else back home, and it’ll be troublesome to go back.”

Zu An had a strange expression on his face as he said, “Thank you, little sister Qien.” What is she trying to say? Is she deliberately keeping me here?

Sang Hong sighed. He knew what his daughter was thinking. Even though his daughter hated what he did, she had always been a smart girl. She knew that since things had already happened, she would choose to make the greatest use of it. By keeping Zu An near, she clearly wished to increase the odds of pregnancy a bit higher.

Of course, he knew that his daughter would never have the shame to actually say that to Zu An. She was probably going to leave that task to Zheng Dan. After all, she also knew that if she couldn't get pregnant fast enough, her father and Zu An would have to go to Cloudcenter Commandery. If Zheng Dan got pregnant after that, no one would believe that it was Qian’er’s posthumous child.

They all had their own thoughts. This time, Zu An watched himself and didn’t drink too much.

…

When the meal was over, Zu An was led to a guest room by Auntie Mu, who said, “Young master Zu, this is where you will stay tonight. In the future, this will be your special room. You may stay here as you wish.”

“Thank you, Auntie Mu.” Zu An felt her words were quite strange, as if she were implying something.

In the dead of night, he secretly left the room and went to visit Sang Qien. He obviously knew the layout of their respective rooms after having gone there several times.

When she heard the knocking, Sang Qien asked vigilantly. “Who is it?”

“Little sister Qien, it’s me. I have some things to talk to you about.” Zu An really couldn't tell what she was thinking, so he decided to talk things out first.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“There’s really nothing to talk about between us.” Sang Qien took a deep breath. “There’s no need for you to feel any internal conflict either. Just pretend that nothing happened at all yesterday.”

“How can you pretend something like that never happened?” Zu An felt somewhat sad. “What are you really thinking? To be honest, I’m a bit confused.”

“Even the girl here doesn’t mind it, so what is a big man like you acting like a freaking sissy for?!” Sang Qien was getting annoyed too. “Or are you saying that you want to use this chance to take advantage of me again? If that really is what you’re thinking, then just barge in and do what you will.”

The door groaned as soon as she finished speaking, having been pushed open from the outside. Sang Qien sat on her bed, completely stupefied.
