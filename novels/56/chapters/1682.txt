Chapter 1631 – Sword Destroyed

Pei Mianman shouted lightly, and a dragon made of black flames wrapped around her longsword. Then, she attacked her opponent again.

The heat of the black flames spread outward. Even the air around the entire stage began to ripple. As the powerful heat spread throughout the entire place, even the people on the other eight stages began to feel its destructive power.

All of the disciples were horrified. Pei Mianman hadn’t been using all of her black flames’ power at all!

At first, most of the disciples had just been enjoying the view of Pei Mianman’s movements, but the fact that they could participate in this competition meant they were their clans’ elites. There was no way they would only think about romance. As such, they had all been studying the essence of the two opponents’ fighting skills while continuing to admire the beauty of her ‘movements’.

After learning his lesson, Zhi Yin didn’t dare to underestimate his opponent’s attack. The golden radiance of earth elemental power surged around him, then gathered around his palm. His hand became as tough as a weapon, quickly blocking the black flames around him.

After her earlier attacks, which had been for the sake of testing out her opponent, Pei Mianman didn’t hold back anymore. She immediately used her ultimate skill, calling out, “Flaming Rose!”

Roses made of endless black flames blossomed like celestial flowers on the stage. Every single one was just like Pei Mianman herself, beautiful and dangerous.

“This attack really is too beautiful…” Xie Daoyun muttered to herself, looking dazzled.

Zu An recalled seeing Pei Mianman use the skill previously in Brightmoon City, but Flaming Rose was now countless times stronger.

When she heard the gasps coming from all directions, Elder Huo Ling stuck out her chest proudly. This disciple she found really had exceptional talent. There was even a chance for her to become the best among the younger generation one day.

Wang Wuxie secretly sent Yan Xuehen a ki transmission, saying, “These black flames are a bit strange. What does Sect Master Yan think about them?”

He naturally wanted to just call her Xuehen, but he had been bluntly corrected when he did so in the past. He didn’t want to increase her negative impression of him, so he changed back to a proper form of address.

Sure enough, Yan Xuehen still responded to him, saying, “Don’t know.”

Even though it was just two words, Wang Wuxie was already perfectly satisfied. He had been scared that she would distance herself from him because of what had happened in the past, but the fact that she had replied meant that there was still a chance in the future.

Then, he discussed the situation with the other sect masters. The others were also surprised, and couldn't see through the origin of the black flames. They just thought of it as a powerful variant of fire elemental energy.

Only Master Jian Huang had a pensive expression, muttering, “Could it be…”

…

In that time, the battle had already taken a different turn. Zhi Yin’s entire body surged with earthen yellow light as he used the power of the earth element to face the black roses. The earth element was known for its defensive characteristics, and was quite sturdy. However, as the black roses exploded one after another, the yellow barrier around him began to tremble. Eventually, it couldn't hold on anymore and shattered, sending smoke and dust into the air.

“Did Zhi Yin lose?!”

Many people stood up out of concern, trying to see what was happening inside. However, judging from Pei Mianman’s serious expression, the more intelligent onlookers could tell that it was nowhere near that simple.

Suddenly, a sphere flew fiercely out of the smoke and dust, as fast as an artillery shell. The black roses were all destroyed when they made contact with the sphere, which didn’t stop at all and continued straight at Pei Mianman. She hurriedly raised her longsword to block the sphere, but with a loud noise, she was blown back more than ten meters before finally stabilizing herself. When she saw the small nick in her sword, her expression became extremely grave.

Boom! Boom! Boom!

Heavy collisions rang out again and again. Each sound seemed almost to strike against the audience’s hearts. Even the contestants of the other eight stages couldn't help but stop. They felt their internal energies stir and couldn't keep fighting at all.

Forget about the surrounding competitors, those with lower cultivations vomited blood on the spot. The elders all used their skills to protect their disciples, and only then did the weaker spectators return to normal.

A figure slowly stepped out from amid the smoke and dust. His figure was tall, and his hair was graceful. He was dribbling a ball in his hand. The same terrifying noise resounded whenever the ball made contact with the ground.

The spectators’ expressions changed. Just the sound of the ball hitting the ground alone was so powerful; just how terrifying would it be if that ball made contact with one’s body?

Even Wu Xiaofan and Wan Guiyi, who had just been watching the battle with amusement, now straightened up. They looked at the ball in Zhi Yin’s hands with serious expressions. Was this his trump card?

“I originally prepared this for the others, but I didn’t expect you to force me to bring it out ahead of time. Now that you’ve made me use the Shadowless Ball, you can be proud of yourself even if you lose,” Zhi Yin said, starting to feel annoyed. However, when he saw the charming and delicate woman on the other side, he really couldn't bring himself to get mad. Still, he didn’t dare to hold back now. The ball in his hand vanished as soon as he spoke.

Pei Mianman was alarmed. Her body flickered as she left her original location.

Boom!

A huge crater appeared in the ground where she had just been standing. The black ball that had been in Zhi Yin’s hand was rapidly spinning inside.

…

“This power seems to be on par with an immortal-grade weapon!”

The sect elders were all knowledgeable and immediately recognized that the Shadowless Ball in Zhi Yin’s hands was extraordinary. They all gave Guan Chouhai looks of admiration and envy. After all, even with the resources at a daoist sect’s disposal, immortal-grade weapons were still extremely hard to obtain. They hadn’t expected him to find one for his disciple.

Guan Chouhai’s expression was conflicted. He couldn't bring himself to feel happy at all. He had initially planned for Zhi Yin to catch Wu Xiaofan off guard in the following struggles between the representative disciples. He hadn’t expected that trump card to be revealed ahead of time so early! Now that Wu Xiaofan could prepare himself, it wouldn’t be as effective.

…

Meanwhile, Pei Mianman seized the chance to thrust her sword at Zhi Yin. She wanted to take the opportunity to defeat him while he wasn’t in control of his weapon. However, as soon as she carried out her attack, she suddenly sensed danger.

Zu An also sent a frantic warning through ki transmission: “Be careful!”

Pei Mianman didn’t take the time to think and dodged to one side. A terrifying wind brushed past her. Fortunately, her body was extremely flexible, allowing her to carry out a difficult evasive movement. Her posture made many of the spectators’ eyeballs almost pop out of their sockets.

However, Pei Mianman wasn’t in the mood to pay attention to these things at all. Instead, she clutched her arm with an expression of pain on her face. She hadn’t been able to completely avoid the attack, and the Shadowless Ball had lightly brushed her arm. Even so, she felt half of her body turning a bit numb. She couldn't help but feel alarmed by the Shadowless Ball’s power. Furthermore, the sound it made when it hit the ground could make one’s internal energies stir and one’s ki distribution unstable, so the opponent’s reactions would also become slightly slower.

…

Zu An’s expression grew stranger and stranger as he watched the skinny, tall, and handsome man continue to dribble the Shadowless Ball, sometimes even between his legs. Is this guy also a transmigrator?

However, his thoughts quickly changed direction, because he noticed that Zhi Yin wasn’t just dribbling the ball, but actually adjusting his position for the best opportunity to attack.

Soon afterward, the black ball shot out without any warning, slamming toward Pei Mianman. At first, she tried to use the black flames to guard against the Shadowless Ball, but it was just too ferocious. The black flames broke apart as soon as they made contact with the ball. She didn’t dare to take a hit from it head-on, so she could only do her best to evade.

Her opponent clearly kept dribbling the ball, but it seemed to be sending countless shadows at her. Furthermore, the ball could return like a boomerang, which was really hard to defend against.

The entire stage was quickly filled with balls. However, Pei Mianman seemed to have a kind of intuition that could only have been polished on the battlefield, constantly allowing her to just barely avoid it at the last moment.

Boom!

On several occasions, the ball slammed into the defensive barrier around them, causing the barrier to flicker and eventually producing cracks, as if it would break at any time.

Wang Wuxie’s expression changed a bit. He reached out his hand and sent out some violet ki, gradually stabilizing the stage.

The sect masters thought to themselves that Wang Wuxie’s cultivation seemed to have only grown harder and harder to measure. However, the most shocking thing was that Zhi Yin’s attacks with the Shadowless Ball were so terrifying that not even a barrier created by so many elders could withstand them.

The proud Wan Guiyi’s expression changed a bit as well. He had to admit that he had looked down on this pretty boy. If they really fought, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to win easily.

“Manman, you should just admit defeat!” Elder Huo Ling called out as she stood up nervously. The armrest of her chair had been unwittingly crushed to pieces already.

As Pei Mianman’s master, she naturally knew what kind of situation her disciple was in. Even though she looked as if she could avoid the attacks at the moment, she would be hit sooner or later. Furthermore, how could an immortal-grade weapon be so easy to endure? Elder Huo Ling knew that with Pei Mianman’s talent, the only thing she lacked was time. Losing to Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s representative disciple wasn’t too embarrassing.

When the others heard the usually unyielding Elder Huo Ling speak that way, they all assumed that Pei Mianman had no chance of making a comeback. However, Pei Mianman bit her lip and stubbornly shook her head. Right at that moment, the Shadowless Ball roared toward her. She could no longer evade and could only raise the longsword in her hand to face it head-on.

Crack!

The longsword that had already been full of cracks shattered into several pieces on the spot. Meanwhile, the Shadowless Ball continued to rush at her chest without any signs of stopping.
