Chapter 1601 – Wordless Edict

Chu Chuyan showed Zu An a smile as she explained, “The Great Sects Competition is a convention that was created over a thousand years ago. Many years ago, the daoists divided themselves into the nine sects. Every single one believed that their theories and cultivation methods were correct. They were all very proud people too, so fights easily broke out whenever there were disagreements. That caused all nine sects to suffer severe casualties.

“Later, the sages from the nine sects realized that things couldn't continue that way, as it would not only cause their geniuses to perish, but also easily form grudges that couldn’t be dissolved. However, there was already a grudge between the nine sects, so there was no way for the fighting to completely end. As such, someone proposed the idea to hold a great competition within the nine sects. This way, the disciples could fight on a stage, and with the elders watching, it was easier for them to keep it under control.

“The great sect leaders at the time felt that method would not only eliminate conflict, but also motivate their disciples to cultivate earnestly. Thus, the tradition continued. Out of consideration for the clans’ cultivation resources, they chose to hold it once every ten years. Now, it’s been just about ten years since the last competition.”

“This kind of competition should have some benefits, right? Otherwise, it would just be known as some kind of chicken-ribs competition,” Zu An remarked. He thought about how in his previous world, just glory alone wasn’t enough for the athletes in basketball and soccer competitions to do their best. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Of course there are,” Chu Chuyan said with a smile. The eyes of Heavenly Sorrow’s disciples widened. When had they ever seen her smile so brilliantly? Meanwhile, Chu Chuyan continued, “The winning sect can obtain the daoist treasure ‘Wordless Edict’ for ten years. That text will remain in that sect for them to consult.”

Zu An was stunned, asking, “Wordless Edict?”

Now, even King Yan’s people were interested. They looked as if they were still chatting with their friends, but their ears perked up in Chu Chuyan’s direction.

“The Wordless Edict is a text rumored to have been passed down by a daoist ancestor. It’s claimed that the daoists’ ultimate secrets are recorded in it. However, even after all of these years, not even the most stunning talents have been able to comprehend its mysteries,” Chu Chuyan said, a hint of longing in her expression.

“Does the Wordless Edict really not have any words?” Zu An asked.

“I’ve never seen it before, but it’s rumored that it is indeed the case,” Chu Chuyan said with a nod. “Still, the book is truly profound. Even though there are no words, the contents seem to carry the great dao of the universe. Even though the sects haven’t been able to comprehend its ultimate secrets, they’ve still gained a lot of enlightenment from its contents. It’s to the extent that just staying closer to the Wordless Edict can improve one’s cultivation speed.”

“It’s that amazing?” Zu An asked, inwardly thinking to himself that he had to get his hands on the book one day. Naturally, he wouldn’t say that in front of the two sects.

Chu Chuyan continued, “Apart from the Wordless Edict, the top ten disciples of the competition can participate in the Daoist Secret Dungeon that opens once a year. That’s a tremendous opportunity for the younger generation, and the reason why the disciples sent to participate in the competition always try their hardest.”

Zu An nodded. The different powers all had their corresponding dungeons; for example, even Brightmoon City’s Academy had its own. If this was a dungeon that the nine daoist sects shared, it was definitely a place full of treasures and cultivation secrets. Such a thing was obviously extremely alluring for younger cultivators.

Suddenly, he thought of something and asked out of concern, “Aren’t you going to compete against the Devil Sect’s Saintess? Doesn’t that mean joining the competition will become really dangerous?”

If Chu Chuyan joined this Great Sects Competition first, wouldn’t that mean she had to face Qiu Honglei while she wasn’t at her strongest? The Devil Sect had always antagonized the daoist sects. She could be injured in the battle. Meanwhile, if she fought against Qiu Honglei first before joining the competition, that would also be dangerous. Even though the daoist sects claimed to be unified and hold the same beliefs, they actually viewed the other sects as competitors. Furthermore, with the allure of a prize, there was no way they would hold back. Whichever situation it was, it was going to be really dangerous for her.

Chu Chuyan felt warm inside when she sensed Zu An’s concern. She replied, “Don’t worry. I don’t need to join the Great Sects Competition. The White Jade Sect’s candidate spot will be taken by one of my senior brothers. The great sects have given me a special condition. As long as I can win against the Devil Sect’s Saintess, I can obtain a spot for entering the secret dungeon.”

Zu An sighed in relief when he heard that. Still, he felt even more worried afterward. After all, Chu Chuyan had to win in order to further her prospects. However, if she won, that meant Qiu Honglei had to lose. The Devil Sect was no doubt using similar strategies to encourage Qiu Honglei, but there could punishment waiting if she lost.

Zu AN really was torn, as he didn’t want to see either one of them lose. In that instant, he felt the helplessness of fate. There were some things one really couldn't get the best of both worlds for.

…

While the two of them were chatting, the Heavenly Sorrow disciples’ mouths hung wide open. Zhi Yin in particular felt his head ringing.

He still remembered the first time he had met Chu Chuyan. Back then, she had apparently come to the Heavenly Sorrow Sect to deliver a letter. He had thought that she was a goddess the moment he saw her, instantly falling for her. He had even thought of what to name their kids. The son would be Zhi Chu, the daughter would be Zhi Yan… No, how can we only have two children if we get married? That would be such a waste of a beauty! We need at least ten!

In that time, he had immediately ended his relationships with other female disciples and wholeheartedly pursued her. Unfortunately, Chu Chuyan was way too cold and rarely said anything. When he thought about it, he didn’t even remember her saying too much to him. The words that had left him with the greatest impression were ‘oh’, ‘ah’, ‘alright’, ‘I see’, and so on. The longest sentence he had ever heard from her was ‘thank you, senior brother’!

The good thing was that her voice was so pleasant to listen to that even a single word had made him feel incredible. Furthermore, he had felt a sense of superiority because she had spoken even less to other disciples than she did to him. Afterward, when he tallied everything up, he found that she had said a whopping 78 words to him!

Unfortunately, that sense of superiority was completely shattered in this instant. Never could he have expected that the usually silent and ice-cold beauty would be so enthusiastic in conversation with another man. The most important part was her warm smile! There wasn’t even any trace of coldness left!

What right does he have to deserve this?!

Zhi Yin felt anger bubbling within him. He almost vomited blood on the spot.

You have successfully trolled Zhi Yin for +888 +888 +888…

When he saw the surge of Rage points, Zu An gave Zhi Yin a strange look. Why is this little pretty boy throwing a fuss now?

However, he lost interest after a single glance. He continued to chat with Chu Chuyan, but worrying that he was leaving Xie Daoyun alone for too long, he even introduced them to each other. They had been acquaintances back in Brightmoon City, so they weren’t all that unfamiliar.

Secretly, however, the two women had some other thoughts going on behind the scenes. Chu Chuyan tried to guess the nature of Xie Daoyun and Zu An’s relationship, and Xie Daoyun felt that Chu Chuyan and Zu An weren’t like a divorced couple at all.

Meanwhile, Yan Xuehen watched everything unfold indifferently. She thought to herself, This kid really is energetic in his skirt-chasing. He really deserves a proper beating.

…

Meanwhile, Zhi Yin’s entire body trembled with rage. His fists were tightly clenched under his sleeves, his nails digging into his hands.

Next to him, Zhao Xiaodie eventually noticed something. She muttered, “That Chu girl looks all cold on the surface. I didn’t expect her to be such a kissass! She’s so enthusiastic just because she’s talking to an important official.”

Zhi Yin suddenly turned around and snapped, “Shut up! You’re not allowed to speak ill of her!”

His sudden outburst drew people’s attention. The other guests looked at the two of them with surprise, wondering just what had happened.
