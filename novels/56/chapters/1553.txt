Chapter 1502: Committee of Elders

“I wouldn’t dare!” Hu Qianxiao exclaimed in embarrassment.

Meanwhile, however, he felt truly depressed inside. When had he ever spoken in such a submissive manner before? Even if he had been facing the Fiend Emperor, he could at least serve as a guest, right? At least the Fiend Emperor wouldn’t kill him for no reason, and would feel some apprehension toward the Tiger Race’s forces and the views of the other races.

However, today’s situation was different! Shi Zhentian had just been killed, so killing him too wouldn’t make much of a difference either. Between that and the fact that there were two grandmasters on the other side, he decisively chose submission.

Even though he wanted ‘face’, what was that worth if even his life would be forfeit? For example, Shi Zhentian was now lying on the ground, his face already smashed rotten.

The most unusual thing was that no one present looked down on his behavior; instead, they simply acted as if it were only natural. They had clearly been frightened quite badly by the arrow.

Zu An remained quiet for a moment. He and Hu Qianxiao didn’t share much enmity. If he really thought about it, this guy had even helped him out by laughing at Shi Zhentian.

However, he suddenly thought of something else and remarked, “I heard you and Bluefield Country’s ruler had some kind of relationship?”

The women all perked up their ears when they heard that. Yu Yanluo, Yan Xuehen, and Yun Jianyue in particular had even spent some time in Bluefield Country before. They all thought, We were already suspicious that he had something to do with Tushan Yu. Now, it looks like there was something strange after all!

You have successfully trolled Yu Yanluo for +66 +66 +66…

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +66 +66 +66…

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +66 +66 +66…

The others were all really curious about what was going on too. Bluefield Country’s ruler Tushan Yu was a famous beauty among the Fiend races. It would be hard to call her the number one beauty, but if they were to debate which one was the most alluring, then among the entire Fiend races, it was likely that only she and the Second Empress would be qualified to compete for that title.

Still, the Second Empress was the Second Empress in the end. Her presence carried a noble and superior aura. That was why most people discussed Tushan Yu more, always calling her the ‘Seductive Fox’. Even though her normal behavior didn’t carry any of those intentions, those who saw her always thought that way.

There was also the fact that over the past few years, rumors of Tushan Yu being Hu Qianxiao’s private property had become pretty widespread; many people among the Fiend races had heard about that affair. Today, however, they were hearing about some new drama.

Hu Qianxiao quickly explained, “That’s a misunderstanding! In the past, Bluefield’s ruler and I spent some time together, so I took care of her out of consideration for our old affection to prevent other people from bullying her. But in the end, some senseless people began to spread falsehoods.”

Zu An replied with an ‘oh’. He told Hu Qianxiao after glancing at the Second Empress, “If you want to rely on our help, it’ll depend on whether the Second Empress and the young prince want to accept you.”

Hu Qianxiao sighed in relief when he heard that. As long as you aren’t opposed to it, it’s all good. The Second Empress definitely won’t refuse assistance from a powerful group.

Sure enough, the Second Empress nodded and said, “As the Tiger King is willing to renounce your wrong ways, the young prince and I will naturally welcome you…”

At the same time, she spoke a few words of encouragement. Hu Qianxiao was so moved he was about to cry. After all, keeping his life was at least guaranteed now! Sigh, for a grandmaster to have to live like this, how pathetic…

Still, when he recalled that terrifying arrow from before, he still felt that his choice was correct.

Now that Hu Qianxiao had changed sides, the Golden Crow Guards left by the palace gates no longer had any backing. The Second Empress’ faction quickly gained control over them.

Lei Xin, Wu Cheng and the others had initially been unhappy that they were forced to support the young prince. But now, they suddenly felt that the chances of the young prince rising to the throne were growing greater and greater. For all they knew, they could really become dragons among subjects! That meant their fate would be bright and optimistic, no longer doomed!

The other Golden Crow Guards likewise felt inspired. After occupying the palace gate, they were easily able to take over the Imperial Palace. Together with the Second Empress’ trusted aide Central Regular Attendant Bi Cui working from inside, the entire palace quickly fell under the Second Empress’ control.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

While her subordinates were running around, the Second Empress kneeled down by her son’s side. She pointed at the distant Zu An and said, “Remember, if you really become the Fiend Emperor, you have to thank him.”

The little prince nodded, saying, “Adoptive father’s arrow is really strong. I want to learn how to cultivate from him!”

The Second Empress had a doting smile when she heard her son say that. When she looked at Zu An, her eyes shone.

…

Unlike how smoothly Zu An was having things, the Golden Crow Crown Prince wasn’t having an easy time at all. He had sent his subordinates to capture the other princes, but he understood his greatest enemy well. That was why he had gathered all of his elite troops to face the Second Prince’s manor.

Initially, he had thought that defeating the Second Prince wouldn’t take much time at all. However, his brother seemed to have already anticipated this a long time ago and had been waiting in the manor for them ahead of time. A fight had thus broken out without much of a prelude.

The Golden Crow Guards led by the Golden Crow Crown Prince were all the most elite of elites, but the Second Prince’s men weren’t bad either. As one of the Fiend Races’ four great generals, he had elite soldiers who had fought many battles.

In theory, that army wasn’t supposed to be his private army, and without the Fiend King Court’s token, he couldn't transfer them however he pleased. But that was only in theory. Over the years, he had privately roped in a large number of trusted aides, secretly turning them into his own private troops. Tonight, they finally showed their use.

The elite Golden Crow Guards faced off against the Second Prince’s war-hardened soldiers. Their tactics were all excellent, and neither side showed the other any weakness. Just like that, they clashed over and over. Blood and flesh flew in all directions, and the battle was incredibly bitter. Both sides’ officers and soldiers had similar skills, capable of all the things the other side was. There was no way for either side to pull a fast one on the other, making it a war of attrition.

When he saw the state of the battle, the Golden Crow Crown Prince’s eyelids twitched. This bastard actually prepared this well? He had thoughts of rebelling after all!

“Elder Wu, help me take down that evildoer!” he secretly ordered. It was common knowledge that to defeat one’s enemy, it was wise to take down the leader first.

A grunt of acknowledgment came from midair. Then, an elder suddenly appeared above the battlefield and rushed at the Second Prince. Even though the Second Prince was also a strong cultivator, he didn’t stand a chance against the might of a grandmaster.

Suddenly, however, there was another ripple. A figure rushed out from the Second Prince’s manor, stopping Elder Wu. The two exchanged blows. The terrifying blast wave that ensued shook the entire Fiend King Court!

The Golden Crow Crown Prince recognized the other person. He exclaimed in shock and anger, “Sixth Uncle, is the Committee of Elders not supposed to avoid interfering with matters of the Fiend King Court?!”

The Golden Crow royal family had some elders who joined the Committee of Elders, spending their time in seclusion. The Fiend Emperors had formed an agreement with them that only when there was a matter related to the survival of the Fiend Races would they make an appearance. Otherwise, they were not allowed to show themselves randomly.

Of course, these elders were all individuals nearing the end of their lifespans. All of them relied on secret dungeons or formations to enter hibernation, which was why they could live a bit longer. They weren’t really willing to recklessly use up their lifespan either. That was why, as time passed, people among the Fiend races had stopped considering their presence when making decisions.

The individual who was called Sixth Uncle wasn’t the late Fiend Emperor’s blood brother, but rather his cousin in the clan. He was someone who had only joined the Committee of Elders a few years prior. That was why the Golden Crow Crown Prince recognized him.

Sixth Uncle replied indifferently, “You brothers are fighting against each other, so how can this old one remain unconcerned?”

Elder Wu said coldly, “It is clearly the Second Prince who has rebelled with malice. Furthermore, the late Fiend Emperor has already perished, and the Crown Prince is already the new Fiend Emperor. Old Six, why are you not bowing down to him yet?”

“New Fiend Emperor?” Sixth Uncle sneered. “Who said so?”

The Golden Crow Crown Prince raised his head proudly and said, “I was designated as the Crown Prince by my father for so many years, and I even experienced the Imperial Tomb’s trial, receiving the recognition of the Fiend Ancestor. Now, father emperor has passed on, so of course I am the undisputed new Fiend Emperor.”

Sixth Uncle looked at him and replied, “Oh, in that case, then I believe the late Fiend Emperor has already passed on all of his cultivation to you, right?”

The Golden Crow Crown Prince’s face turned rigid when he heard that. It was none other than his greatest sore spot.

The Fiend Emperor had died mysteriously in the secret dungeon and hadn’t even had time to pass on his cultivation. Otherwise, the Crown Prince wouldn’t need to lead so many troops to kill his brothers; he could have just relied on his earth immortal cultivation to make sure not a single person in the Fiend King Court could complain.
