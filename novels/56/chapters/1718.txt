Chapter 1667: Other Hidden Motives

The whole affair caused a massive disturbance, as even the emperor himself had personally come. The important officials from Yi Commandery rushed over when they heard the news, including Yi Commandery’s Martial Supervisor Yang Sheng and Yi City Lord Liao Ling.

Of course, some of King Yan’s officials also arrived without knowing about the situation. When they heard that King Yan had been detained, their expressions changed greatly. However, Zhang Jie didn’t give them the chance to leave. He seized the chance to take all of them into custody too.

The only regretful thing was that Yan State’s Xiang Minister Sun Xun hadn’t come. It was rumored that he was away.

When Zu An returned to the courtyard, the way people looked at him was different. Previously, even though his status as an Embroidered Envoy was frightening, there were quite a few local bigwigs present, so they hadn’t been that scared. However, after finding out that he could summon the emperor at any time, who wasn’t scared of him?

They had heard that Embroidered Envoys could summon the emperor, but that the ceremony was incredibly complicated. When had they ever summoned the emperor just like that, so quickly and easily?

Furthermore, this Sir Eleven was clearly different from other Embroidered Envoys. According to the intelligence they had gathered, when other Embroidered Envoys summoned the emperor, it would just be an emotionless projection that would disappear after he was summoned. But this time, it was as if the emperor himself had really come!

“Sir Eleven has both wisdom and bravery, as expected. He was able to capture King Yan so quickly,” Zhang Jie said, giving him a thumbs up. He couldn't hold himself back from offering praise.

The others also rushed over to praise Zu An. Even the normally aloof Liao Ling’s expression changed a bit when he looked at him. Zu An’s mood wasn’t all that great, however, because he had just met with Zhao Han. He didn’t feel as good about all of the praise as usual.

…

After he ordered Zhang Jie to arrest any related individuals, he found a chance to meet with King Yan alone. Normally, that wouldn’t be too appropriate, but his prestige was extremely high at the moment. Who would dare to criticize his actions?

The previously high and mighty King Yan was bound up in Soul Reaping Chains. He looked just like an old man with one foot already in the grave. He sat quietly in the corner just like that, as if he would decay away at a moment’s notice.

When he saw Zu An arrive, King Yan raised his head. A hint of resentment flashed through his eyes as he said, “Very good! This king never expected to be pecked in the eye by the goose he was hunting.”

You have successfully trolled Zhao Li for +555 +555 +555…

Zu An said coldly, “You should have anticipated that this would happen to you one day from the moment you decided to conspire with the Fiend races.”

He felt a bit strange after saying that. He was the glorious Fiend races’ Regent, the adoptive father of the little emperor and the lover of the Second Empress. And yet, he was accusing someone else of conspiring with the Fiend races?

Sigh, even though I told the Second Empress to do her best to cut off any news about me being the Regent, the Fiend race territories are so big. The court will find out sooner or later one day.

King Yan harrumphed. There was no one else here, so he didn’t bother defending himself meaninglessly.

Zu An calmed himself down and said, “I came here to ask you about something this time. How did you kill Golden Token Seven?”

King Yan gave him a cold look and shot back, “What, do you think a rebellion isn’t enough of a criminal accusation, so you want to accuse me of even more?”

Zu An said indifferently, “We’re all people in the know. Is there any meaning in your quibbling here?”

“Heh.” King Yan sneered and said, “And I was wondering just how brilliant and heroic of a man you are. It turns out you thought that I was the one who killed Golden Token Seven!”

Zu An was alarmed, replying, “Don’t tell me you’re not?”

“Of course not,” King Yan said, his eyes flickering. It seemed almost as if he had learned something interesting, which gradually calmed his mood. He continued, “With how things are, there would be no reason for me to lie about something like this.”

Zu An frowned. Compared to the crimes of smuggling and rebellion, killing Golden Token Seven indeed seemed unimportant. However, it was hard to say too. After all, those crimes he had been accused of could end up not being proven. There was a chance that he just didn’t want to admit to the murder of Golden Token Seven.

As if sensing that Zu An didn’t believe him, King Yan continued, “It’s true that Golden Token Seven always got in this king’s way, so I loathed him and had thoughts of getting rid of him. However, his status was too sensitive. He was someone his majesty personally appointed. In a place like Yi Commandery that is full of the emperor’s eyes, touching him would have been the same as publicly rebelling against the empire. This king knows at least that much.”

“But all of the evidence so far seems to point toward you,” Zu An said, looking into his eyes.

“Were you the one who captured Sir Huo?” King Yan suddenly came to a realization and said angrily, “That guy doesn’t do things properly and just causes more trouble.”

That person was normally antisocial and strange. Sometimes, he left to do some mysterious things, only to return a few days later. Thus, he hadn’t been too worried at first, thinking it was a normal occurrence. Only now did he realize that something had happened to Sir Huo.

“Do you have nothing left to say?” Zu An replied with a sneer. “Back then, Golden Token Seven was hit by a spirit element attack. That was how he died in such a mysterious way.”

“So it was because of Sir Huo that you suspected me,” King Yan said, suddenly realizing the truth.

“You have the strongest motive. You have a spirit element expert, Sir Huo, under you as well. Who else could it be but you?” Zu An retorted. His expression was calm, but all kinds of possibilities appeared in his head.

“Since you’ve captured Sir Huo, then did he confess to killing Golden Token Seven?” King Yan sneered.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Zu An frowned. Indeed, Sir Huo didn’t seem to have admitted to that when he was caught. The group had then focused on Golden Token Seven and King Yan’s grudge, however. Then, they had all begun to search for the account book proving King Yan’s betrayal. Everything seemed to be rational and clearly structured…

Seeing that Zu An had fallen silent, King Yan harrumphed. “This king knew that I would be the biggest suspect following Golden Token Seven’s death. That’s why I sent some people to investigate this case as well.”

“Oh? You had your own investigation?” Zu An asked. His surprise was real this time. “Who did you send?”

“That’s something I can’t tell you.” King Yan said mysteriously.

Zu An frowned slightly. He didn’t know whether King Yan was deliberately making things complicated, or if something really had happened. Still, that helped him make many connections between the details he knew.

“There’s just one thing that I don’t understand. You should have investigated the Hub of Freedom back then. Why did you investigate me instead?” King Yan spoke up again. His expression was full of confusion.

Zu An thought of something and said, “So you actually bought out that Embroidered Envoy.”

Previously, the traitor’s description had ended up involving the Hub of Freedom’s Tang Tian’er. However, they hadn’t expected him to know Tang Tian’er personally.

“Was that Embroidered Envoy later silenced?” Zu An asked. Later, Xiao Jianren’s group had investigated everywhere, even going to his home, but there was no news of him at all.

“There was someone who wanted him silenced, but it wasn’t me,” King Yan replied with a chuckle, as if he had thought through some things.

“Where is he now?” Zu An asked. This traitor didn’t seem to just be a simple nobody.

“You haven’t even told me why you didn’t investigate the Hub of Freedom and instead came after me. Why do I have to tell you that?” King Yan bluntly refused.

Zu An frowned. That subject was related to too many things. Tang Tian’er was his friend, so he didn’t want to involve her.

“Even though I don’t know why you weren’t willing to investigate the Hub of Freedom, I’ll still give you a word of advice. In the case of Golden Token Seven’s death, the Hub of Freedom is likely involved,” King Yan said with a smile. After the initial alarm of being arrested, he seemed to have realized some things. He was more relaxed now.

Zu An asked him about a few more things, but he didn’t say a word. Zu An gritted his teeth when he saw that. He really wanted to use the Ikuu Experience card against this guy. However, after some hesitation, he didn’t do so and instead left the prison.

…

Zu An summoned Zhang Zitong and Xiao Jianren, ordering them to work with Zhang Jie’s officials to investigate the account book’s details, as well as to secure any related human testimonies and evidence.

The two of them were both excited. This was a big case! If they succeeded, they would obtain several years’ worth of merits!

Zu An then talked to Zhang Jie, Yang Sheng, Liao Ling, and other local officials of Yi Commandery. He had them track down the rest of King Yan’s people, and tasked them to detain people such as King Yan’s heir and Xiang Minister Sun Xun as quickly as possible.

After assigning all of those tasks, he left. He had too many doubts that he had to look into.

…

As soon as he left the governor manor, he suddenly felt something. He turned to look in a certain direction. He saw a figure slowly walking out from behind a large tree. Even though she was dressed all in black, with that familiar figure and outstanding aura, who else could it be but Yan Xuehen?

“Big sis Yan!” Zu An exclaimed. His previously irritable mood suddenly became calm.

“I was not doing this because I was worried about your safety or anything! I just sensed the emperor’s power, so I could not hold back my curiosity and came to take a look,” Yan Xuehen said with an unnatural expression.

Zu An sighed and said, “You’re finally here! I was almost killed by the emperor just now.” He had a weak expression. He closed his eyes and fainted, falling to one side. A cry of alarm filled the air, and then he could feel that he was leaning against a soft body.

“What’s wrong?” Yan Xuehen asked nervously. She checked his pulse. However, her expression quickly changed and she pushed him away, exclaiming, “You tricked me again!”

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +33 +33 +33…

However, Zu An wasn’t pushed away. In fact, he latched onto her like as if they were stuck together.

“Let go!” Yan Xuehen cried, struggling more fiercely. However, in the end, she didn’t use her grandmaster rank power out of fear of accidentally hurting him.

Zu An sighed and said, “Big sis Yan, it looks like you clearly worry about me. Why do you have to lie to yourself?”

“Who is worried about you? I already told you that I suddenly noticed the emperor… Mmm…” Her mouth was covered by scorching hot lips before she could even finish her sentence. Her beautiful eyes immediately widened, and her mind also went blank.

A while later, she finally snapped out of her daze and pushed him away. She was both ashamed and annoyed, snapping, “What are you doing?” Meanwhile, she reflexively looked around.

“Don’t worry, there’s no one else here,” Zu An said, looking at her with a smile. An icy peak crowned with a touch of rosiness really was an incredibly beautiful sight.

“Is this an issue of whether there’s anyone around us or not? You actually dare to treat me with disrespect!” Yan Xuehen cried. Her entire body was shaking, perhaps because of anger or alarm.

“Is this called disrespect? Then what would you call what we did before?” Zu An retorted, looking directly into her eyes.
