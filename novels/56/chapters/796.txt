Chapter 775, Part 1: This Dungeon Is Indecent

Translator: Pika

The old farmer raised his head in shock, looking toward Zu An. “This one is?”

Jiang Luofu helped introduce Zu An. “He is my friend, Zu An.”

“Oh, so it was eighth sister’s friend. It’s nice to meet you.” The old farmer smiled sincerely.

Judging from his reaction, it didn’t seem as if he had ever heard Zu An’s name before. Not only did Zu An not feel a trace of dissatisfaction, he instead respected the man even more. After all, it was because the farmer was completely devoted to helping the common people that he paid no attention to outside matters and didn’t know about the disturbances in the court.

“Ah Zu, this is my seventh brother, Wang Shuyang.” Jiang Luofu told Zu An in secret, “He’s a virtuous and prestigious elder. You absolutely can’t trick him like you did Yin Shi.” She was worried that Zu An might do something similar to the previous incident and gave him a warning ahead of time.

Zu An couldn’t help but laugh inwardly as he asked, “Am I that type of person to you?” At the same time, he replied to the old farmer, “So it was Senior Wang. It’s an honor.”

Wang Shuyang smiled, clearly not caring much about Zu An’s flattery. He asked, “What did this little friend mean when you suggested a hybridized paddy field?”

Zu An said, “Elder Wang, you mentioned that rice paddies had two major issues. The first is the output ceiling, while the second is the lack of resistance toward plant diseases.”

“You’re right. This is actually a problem that has troubled me for many years. No matter which choice I make, I can only improve things slightly. I can’t make any substantial improvements.”

Zu An said, “To be honest, solving this problem can be challenging if you think it’s challenging, but it can also be quite easy if you change your perspective.”

“Oh? Then may I ask what this little friend has in mind?” Even though Wang Shuyang’s words sounded polite, he couldn’t help but frown inwardly when he saw Zu An’s age, as well as his clean fingernails. This youngster had clearly never lived the life of a farmer. There were some calluses, but that was clearly from training with the sword. No matter how he looked at it, this shouldn’t be someone who knew anything about farming.

“Ah Zu!” Jiang Luofu gave Zu An a look. She didn’t believe that he knew about such things either.

Zu An said with a smile, “Elder Wang must have traveled extensively over the years in search of seeds. Have you ever found any wild crops?”

“I have indeed.” Wang Shuyang had almost thought that Zu An had some enlightening remarks. Yet when he heard him say this, he couldn’t help but feel a bit disappointed. “But those wild crops are dry and shriveled; they can’t be treated as foodstuffs or planted.”

Zu An countered, “The disadvantage to wild crops is a lack of flesh, and so they can’t be used as food. However, they have an advantage, which is that by growing in the wild, their vitality is extremely strong. They have powerful resistances against various illnesses, and they have higher tolerance against temperatures than paddy crops.”

“Hm…?” Wang Shuyang was moved. He felt as if a spark had gone off in his head, yet he couldn’t fully grasp it yet.

Zu An continued, “The advantages of wild crops are precisely the weaknesses of grown crops. Meanwhile, their disadvantages just happen to be the advantages of the other. If we could hybridize these two types of crops, then wouldn’t they balance each other out perfectly?”

Wang Shuyang’s eyes immediately widened. He was extremely excited as he exclaimed, “Wonderful, wonderful! Why have I never thought of this before? Why haven’t I?! Hahaha! The people are saved, they’re saved…”

Jiang Luofu jumped in fright when she saw her usually quiet and gloomy seventh brother suddenly becoming lively like a child. She quickly asked Zu An, “What’s wrong with him?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Zu An said with a smile, “I think he’s just excited.”

Hybridized rice fields had only been made possible through generations of scientific research in Zu An’s old world. All of that knowledge had only provided results because of Mr. Yuan Longping’s consolidation. As someone who devoted himself to farming, how could Wang Shuyang not see the value in it?

If it were someone else, Zu An might have held back a bit and used that as a scheme, but even in his few minutes of interaction with Wang Shuyang, he already understood that this person truly lived for the people. Handing such new technology to people like him was the best choice for the people of the world.

Furthermore, he only knew a bit about the concept. As for how it could truly be put into practice… um… If he really were that awesome, then he wouldn’t have wasted his time every day arguing with strangers online.

Wang Shuyang finally snapped out of his daze. He grabbed Zu An’s hands excitedly. “Little friend Zu, um… no, Sir Zu! Please receive three kowtows from me.”

Zu An jumped in fright. “Senior, you mustn’t!”

Jiang Luofu was also stunned. What was up with her fellow disciples these days? Why were all of them bowing to Zu An all of a sudden? It was one thing with Yin Shi, as that fellow was a bit weird. But what was happening to her seventh brother? He had always been upright. He would never willfully produce nonsense like Yin Shi.

Wang Shuyang said seriously, “There’s nothing improper about this. The first kowtow is for the common people of the world. Once the hybridized rice field concept bears fruit, then you will be the savior of millions and millions of lives! Forget about three kowtows, even if it were three hundred, three thousand, thirty thousand… It would still be worth it.”

Jiang Luofu was stunned. She hadn’t really felt anything after hearing about Zu An’s plan. What he had said was actually that important?

After Wang Shuyang completed his bows, he gestured toward her. “Eighth sister, you should come and kowtow to him too. Thank this hero for saving the lives of millions and millions.”

Jiang Luofu was speechless. Seeing her in a daze, Wang Shuyang didn’t explain further and tugged on her sleeves to make her kneel down.

Jiang Luofu remembered that this senior brother had taken good care of her when she was little, and she had always admired his character, so she couldn’t really be disrespectful right now. She could only pout while kowtowing to Zu An.

Zu An broke out into a sweat. He quickly helped Jiang Luofu back up and said, “Big sis, you don’t need to do this.”

Unfortunately, Jiang Luofu was quite upset. If you don’t want me to do it, then I’m going to freaking do it! We’ll see how you’ll pay for this later.

Zu An began to panic when he saw the resentment in her eyes. He quickly said, “Stop already, stop! I’ll return the favor!” He kowtowed as he spoke.

His actions drew the attention of the surrounding farmers. Rather than farmers, they were all Wang Shuyang’s students. They couldn’t help but whisper among each other when they saw what was happening here.

“Huh? Don’t those two look like they’re bowing to each other in marriage?”

“Is Mr. Wang the wedding witness?”

“Wait, isn’t that Ms. Jiang? Who is that pretty boy she’s kowtowing to?”

Jiang Luofu’s long legs drew a lot of attention to begin with; anyone would recognize her from a single glance. When those students recognized her, their expressions were filled with jealousy as they looked at Zu An.

Teacher Jiang was incredibly beautiful, her gorgeous legs deeply engraved in the mind of every single student. Together with her cold demeanor, there were just too many students who dreamed about her…

She had always treated other men coldly, and there had never been any rumors of her being affectionate with another man, so everyone was still equal in this regard. However, they had discovered that the woman of their dreams was kowtowing with another man! How could they not become depressed?

Zu An jumped in fright and turned around. He saw a group of male students staring daggers at him.

Jiang Luofu immediately jumped to her feet as if she had touched something hot. She was quite hard pressed here as well, and hadn’t expected the students to misunderstand like this. To be honest, they really did look like they were kowtowing to each other in marriage. Sigh, what the hell was I thinking?

“Nonsense! Hurry and bow to Sir Zu.” Wang Shuyang had clearly heard the whispers as well. He gave his disciples a fierce look.

“Sir Zu?” The students’ reactions were identical to those of Yin Shi’s disciples.

“His knowledge is enough for him to be the master of you all! Why is it hard for you good-for-nothings to call him sir? Hurry and kowtow already!” Wang Shuyang’s personality had been quite old-fashioned to begin with. Now that he was glaring at them like this, the students didn’t dare to retort.

One after another, all of them greeted Zu An unwillingly. “We greet Sir Zu!”

What was the most painful thing in the world? It was seeing the woman of their dreams enter the arms of another man. What was even more painful than that was that they had to bow to that man in respect!
