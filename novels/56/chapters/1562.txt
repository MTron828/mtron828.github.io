Chapter 1511: Great Elder

“Qiao Xugong, how can you take advantage of others’ difficulties like this? Are you proud of yourself for stabbing an injured person in the back?!” Duantian Chou protested, his miniature figure barely discernible in the mirror. He kept flinging himself from side to side, but he was trapped inside the entire time, only able to helplessly vent his anger at the Great Elf King.

Zu An was stunned. This weird father-in-law of his was actually named Qiao Xugong?

Still, that makes sense. He wasn’t the Great Elf King from birth, and he had his own name. But once he became the Great Elf King, people rarely called him by his real name. That’s probably why most people forgot about his name.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

However, when he heard this name, he suddenly felt the urge to ask his close female friends, Between me and Xugong, who is more handsome?

Also, isn’t this guy a bit much?

Still, he saw that no one seemed surprised at all. They must have already become used to such scenes from being a part of the Fiend King Court.

“Take advantage of others’ difficulties? Backstabbing?” the Great Elf King replied, showing the mirror a perfect smile. “Isn’t this what you Dark Elves are best at? I’ve merely learned a trick or two, and yet you already can’t take it anymore?”

“F*ck!” Duantian Chou cursed. “Don’t show me that disgusting smile of yours!”

The Great Elf King was in a good mood and was about to continue, but when he heard that, he immediately erupted in fury. “You actually think such a handsome, refined, amiable, and flawless smile is disgusting? Are you blind?!”

Duantian Chou naturally wouldn’t back down. The two quickly began to curse each other.

Those present were speechless.

The Second Prince’s expression changed several times. With the arrival of the Great Elf King, today’s battle was likely already lost. If he didn’t quickly leave and bring Sixth Uncle with him, good things would come to those who…

Wait!

His eyes quickly widened, because he saw that Zu An had added another arrow and aimed it at Sixth Uncle.

Sixth Uncle was also horrified. He had already been panicking when he saw Sir Fu and Heichi Suiya’s deaths, starting to entertain thoughts of fleeing. As a grandmaster, which place wouldn’t welcome him?

However, this long-haired large-chested woman was just too vicious. She had brought out all kinds of powerful and mysterious skills, preventing him from leaving.

Motherf*cking… We don’t even share any grudges! Do you have to go all out like this?

However, he had no idea that Yun Jianyue was actually furious right now.

That idiot Zu An actually helped the stone cold woman first! Why didn’t he help me first?

We clearly knew each other first, and we even lived together in the Imperial Palace for so long. Our friendship should be greater!

And yet that punk is just like other stinky men, all becoming enamored by that stupid stone cold woman’s aloof and fairy-like act.

All men should die!

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +444 +444 +444…

Sixth Uncle didn’t know why his opponent’s aura suddenly erupted and she attacked with twice her previous ferocity. Several injuries quickly appeared on his body. Then, he saw Heichi Suiya explode from an arrow, leaving him completely overwhelmed by fear.

Dark Elves could escape through spatial skills. Normally speaking, only they ambushed others. If they wanted to leave, it would be really hard for others to pursue them. Even so, Duantian Chou had managed to avoid the arrow by sacrificing half of his own blood essence to create a substitute. That meant his aura had already been completely locked onto by that arrow. Even if he escaped through space, he wouldn’t truly have escaped. That was why he had to choose such extreme measures.

Sixth Uncle didn’t have such a survival skill! If he were hit by an arrow, he would just explode on the spot! Thus, he reacted quickly. He immediately gave up resistance and pleaded with a smile, “This is a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding! We are all our own people!”

His sudden change in behavior caught Yun Jianyue off guard too. She was briefly at a loss for what to do too.

“Our own people?” Zu An sneered. He kept his arrow aimed at Sixth Uncle.

Sixth Uncle broke out into a cold sweat. He quickly said, “Young prince, I am your Sixth Uncle! I even bought candies for you when you were little! Right, I have nothing to do with the Second Prince, but I came to preside over things because the Crown Prince ruthlessly killed his brothers today. That does not mean I support him!

“Compared to the Second Prince, I feel like the young prince is more suited to becoming the Fiend Emperor! You are now the late Fiend Emperor’s sole direct descendant, and your mother is the empress. Of course you are the one with the most qualifications to become the Fiend Emperor!”

He blurted out all sorts of reasons in one go. Even he hadn’t known he could become so good at bootlicking, and that he could speak so quickly.

The onlookers were a bit alarmed. They really had widened their horizons today. Not only had they seen so many grandmasters fight against each other, they had even witnessed grandmasters being instantly killed. Now there was even a grandmaster begging for his life!

Hu Qianxiao suddenly teared up. My grievances have finally been justified, someone understands my pain! I am the glorious Hu Qianxiao! If not for the fact that I was really going to die, do you think I would suddenly become a kitty cat?!

The Second Prince’s nose started to become crooked from anger. Just what kind of idiots had he ended up raising? He had built everything up with such difficulty, and yet all of it became a joke!

Zu An hesitated. Suddenly, his expression changed and he turned in another direction.

The winds became violent and the clouds rushed around. A terrifying aura spread from the clouds, and several faces gradually condensed in the sky. All of them were incredibly old, but their auras were powerful. Even Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue both backed up. These were clearly just projections, yet their auras were stronger than the two women’s own. That was especially true for the one in the lead. His aura wasn’t too far from the past Fiend Emperor!

“Great Elder, your respected self has finally arrived,” Sixth Uncle said, tears streaming from his eyes when he saw the figures.

“Silence, you disgraceful thing,” the Great Elder said, shooting him a look. Two streaks of light surrounded Sixth Uncle’s body, as if the Great Elder could instantly turn him into smoke. Sixth Uncle’s entire body shivered. He didn’t dare utter another sound.

The Second Empress quickly tugged on Zu An’s arm and hinted for him to put his arrow away. She quietly said through ki, “These are some of the royal family’s elders. Many of them are even older than the Fiend Emperor. They are usually sealed in the Imperial Tomb and have extremely shocking cultivations.”

Zu An nodded. Sixth Uncle also seemed to be from the Committee of Elders, but he had only joined a few years ago. He was just like an intern at most.

These individuals all had extremely high cultivations. They were all people whose lives were nearing their end, but they couldn’t break through to a higher realm, so they had sealed themselves up. They hoped that the world would change one day, upon which they would see if there was a chance to break through and obtain a new life. They hadn’t sent their real bodies, but rather cast projections of themselves; it was probably in order to preserve their lifespan.

“I greet the elders!” the Second Prince exclaimed, his eyes shining with a look of excitement. He had initially thought that everything was over today. But now that the clan elders had come, there was a chance of things turning out for the better.

No matter how high that bastard Zu An’s cultivation is, could it be higher than the elders? Especially Great Elder, whose strength is comparable to father emperor’s; he alone could deal with this entire situation!

Let alone the fact that there are still other elders!

The Great Elder nodded slightly, then swept his gaze around the room. Soon afterward, his eyes landed on Zu An, as well as the Sun Slaying Bow in his hand.

The Great Elf King coughed and asked, “May I ask why we are suddenly honored with the elders’ presence?”

His status was high, and because of his naturally proud nature, he wasn’t as scared of these elders as ordinary people. When he saw the Great Elder look at that lacking son-in-law of his, he was worried they’d start fighting. After all, even though his son-in-law looked a bit ordinary, and far, far from being as handsome as himself, at least he was decent at shooting. He was still pretty satisfied with his son-in-law.

In his eyes, there were only three grades for beauty in this world. The first was, of course, himself. No one else was his equal. The second was merely ordinary-looking people. They were just too far from his own beauty. As for the others, all of them were ugly clowns.

Pretty leather bags were still leather bags. Once you saw one, you’d seen them all. As for ugly clowns, they could be ugly in all kinds of fantastic and odd ways. That was why the fact that this lacking son-in-law of his could reach the normal category was already quite amazing.

The Great Elder harrumphed. “The entire Fiend King Court has become such a huge mess. Did I even have a choice but to come?”

The Second Empress spoke up just then, saying, “Great Elder, that cannot be blamed on us, but on the Second Prince. He went after his brothers, and we were merely acting out of self-defense. I hope Great Elder can bring justice to us all.”

As the empress, she was naturally the one with the most qualifications to speak. Furthermore, she was extremely beautiful, and together with the young child in her arms, she really was lovely and pitiful. It was hard for others to develop animosity toward her.

The Great Elder followed her line of sight and saw the Crown Prince’s corpse bound up in the Second Prince’s group, as well as Elder Wu’s head. His expression immediately darkened.
