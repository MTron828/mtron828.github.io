Chapter 1537: Anything Is Possible with Determination

In the end, Sang Hong was still a powerful cultivator who had already been famous for a long time. In such a moment of imminent peril, he had managed to avoid the most dangerous attack. However, there was still a deep, bloody gash across his chest. It was as expected of a dark elf’s attack; they were the best of the best in terms of assassination.

“Shadow Group!” Sang Hong exclaimed, recognizing the assassin’s outfit. He couldn't help but yell in shock and anger, “How brazen! You actually dare to assassinate the Imperial Envoy!”

Even though the Shadow Group was famous for being mysterious, as long as one paid enough money, they were able to go after any target. However, as an assassin organization, they still had some unwritten rules. They were willing to assassinate officials, but they were still careful about their targets. The targets usually weren’t individuals with especially sensitive statuses.

For example, even though Sang Hong’s official position wasn’t that high, he was still the Imperial Envoy, making him an important minister. He represented the dignity of the court. If even an Imperial Envoy could be killed, the court would definitely be furious, not hesitating to pay any price to punish the offender. That was why assassin organizations like the Shadow Group normally didn’t take such risks in their assignments.

“Hah, I don’t know anything about an Imperial Envoy or anything like that. All I know is that you’ve offended the wrong person, and they don’t want you to return to the capital,” the black-clad assassin said with a sinister laugh. Then, he rushed at Sang Hong like a swooping owl.

The others from the Imperial Envoy’s group came out to offer their assistance. Unfortunately, another group of assassins rushed forth. Even though there were capable members among the Imperial Envoy’s group, they had been roused awake by a sudden fire in the middle of the night and didn’t even have their clothes on properly, let alone being equipped with weapons. Some hadn’t even escaped from the fire in time. How could they be a match for several well-prepared killers? They quickly collapsed in pools of blood. It was a one-sided massacre.

Just then, the recording mirror in Sang Hong’s room shone, receiving a call from the other side. Unfortunately, it was hidden within fiery flames, and no one could hear anything. As the flames eventually covered everything, the mirror cracked from the heat, its surface dimming.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An frowned as he watched the recording mirror darken. If that happened, it either meant his call had been refused, or there was something wrong with the mirror itself.

Previously, he had been inside the Xia Dynasty’s Unknown Region the entire time. He hadn’t been able to contact the outside world then. After he emerged, he had been caught up in the struggle over the Fiend Emperor position. Now, he finally had some free time and wanted to contact Sang Hong, and yet he discovered that he couldn't.

“Could it be that something happened to them?” Zu An muttered with a frown. He looked toward the south and sank into his own thoughts.

“What’s wrong?” a gentle voice called from behind him. Yu Yanluo sat up on the bed, holding the covers in front of her chest. Her beautiful hair fell across her snow-white skin like a waterfall. It really was one of the most beautiful sights in the world.

“Sorry for waking you up,” Zu An said somewhat apologetically. He gave her a summary of what had happened. “It’s already been quite some time since I left the human side, so it’s time for me to go back.”

Yu Yanluo voiced her understanding, even though her expression was full of reluctance. She was now the Snake race’s leader, and she had been able to secure many benefits for them. That left her with many things to do, so she really couldn't leave. Still, she didn’t stop him in the end and instead consoled him gently, saying, “You came to the Fiend Races because of me, so how can I stop you from going back?”

When he saw her broken-hearted expression, Zu An said quietly, “I’ll try to clear your name when I return. One day, you’ll be able to return to the Yu clan.”

Even though Yu Yanluo did have the Medusa bloodline, she was also half-human. Furthermore, with the way she had conducted herself over the years, she had never done anything to let down the human race. And yet, in the end, she had been schemed against and had no place left to stay on the human side. That was a debt that had to be repaid.

Yu Yanluo was a bit moved too. Compared to the Fiend races, she was still more used to life with the humans. But in the end, she still shook her head and said, “There’s no need for you to give yourself that much pressure. Based on what I know, Zhao Han is only treating you as a blade. A blade is something that can easily be thrown away. If you’re ever unhappy with the human side, you can just return here. You’re the Fiend races’ Regent here, and you even have me and little sister Snow, the Mermaid Princess, as well as the Demon race’s Princess. All of them are close to you. You and the Second Empress already have that kind of relationship too. You don’t have to put up with anyone you don’t want to.”

Zu An chuckled in embarrassment, saying, “So you already knew.”

“Her smell is all over you; it wasn’t hard to figure out at all,” Yu Yanluo said with a sigh.

“Sorry,” Zu An said, sweating nervously.

Yu Yanluo shook her head and replied, “You don’t have to be apologetic. Actually, I was more worried that your relationship with the child emperor and his mother wouldn’t be too secure. After all, the Regents of the Fiend races have never met good ends. But now, it seems I was worrying too much. With that level of relationship, our interests actually align, and we can make decisions together.”

As someone who came from a great clan, she looked at things from a different perspective than other women. Great clans would usually send their children off to other clans in marriage. Feelings were secondary; making sure that families were well-matched in social status and creating alliances was the most important. Zu An and the Second Empress only maintained a secret relationship, and yet they had achieved the same result. From that perspective, it was more than worth it.

Of course, from a lover’s perspective, Yu Yanluo was still a bit jealous. However, this guy’s body had already been tempered several times by the Primordial Origin Sutra and was way too tough. Even someone like her couldn't take it alone, so it was still best to have more companions to share the burden. Besides, compared to ordinary women, it was better to have someone with the Second Empress’ status help out.

…

In the following few days, Zu An began to arrange his departure. When the Second Empress heard that he was going to leave, she actually had the strongest reaction of anyone. After all, she and her son didn’t have anyone else to rely on at the moment. Previously, it had purely been through Zu An’s strength that they could keep everyone else in check.

However, Zu An finally managed to convince her after a long time. The young prince had already ascended to the throne, but he was still too young. He was only the Fiend Emperor in name. And yet, now the Committee of Elders supported the young prince. The Great Elf King, the Peacock Wise King, the Ocean races, and the Demon race were all friendly with him, and he also had Hu Qianxiao, who was a smart person. As long as the Second Empress let things take their course and didn’t start anything that caused public anger, there wouldn’t be any issues.

Furthermore, Zu An had the Wind Fire Wheels now. If something did happen, he could return as quickly as possible.

The Second Empress felt relieved when she heard him explain those things. However, because he was going to leave, she kept clinging to him for the next few days. It was as if, after she had found out he was leaving, she was scared that she wouldn’t be able to enjoy a certain kind of pleasure again for a long time.

…

On the other hand, when Qiao Xueying learned that Zu An was going to return to the Human race, she excitedly said that she was going to follow him, but was stopped by the Great Elf King. In order to preserve his own beauty, he didn’t want to be bothered with the clan’s affairs and had begun to raise his daughter as his successor. She had to learn many things, so how could he just let her go like that?

Qiao Xueying was naturally unwilling. Compared to being his successor, she would much rather stay by Zu An’s side. However, the Great Elf King explained Zu An’s terrible situation on the human side, and that this side was actually his foundation, but once he left, this place wouldn’t necessarily remain stable. Snow was then convinced that she had the responsibility to watch over Zu An’s home as his woman.

Furthermore, when he was young, the Great Elf King had used to be a veteran playboy. He knew what kind of woman would remain the most important in a man’s heart. The more power and bargaining chips the girl had, the more initiative they would hold. After all, his daughter’s beauty was still far too lacking compared to his own and she couldn't really stand out among all of Zu An’s extraordinary partners. She would have to rely on other things.

Qiao Xueying was still a bit hesitant at first, but when she heard about her father’s ‘path of the playboy’, she immediately changed her mind. She took the initiative to tell Zu An that she would help him watch over this part of his foundation. Zu An was incredibly moved when he heard that.

In the end, Zu An set off on his path back to the human side. Because his identity as the Regent was sensitive, apart from a small group of people, the public was only informed that he had gone into seclusion. Then, he secretly got on the Wind Fire Wheels and flew south.

He turned around and looked at the Fiend King Court as it grew smaller and smaller. Zu An muttered to himself, “I originally only came to protect Yu Yanluo and was just passing by. How could I have known that I would play around here for so long…”

He couldn't help but massage his sore back. Those women had all known he was going to leave, so all of them had been incredibly enthusiastic. With that level of intensity day after day, even a back made out of iron would break down!
