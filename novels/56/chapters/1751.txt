Chapter 1700: Enchanting Both Men and Women

Chu Chuyan’s shadows attacked Qiu Honglei from several different directions. Quite a few even passed directly through her body.

The spectators craned their necks toward the stage. Many people wondered if victory and defeat had already been decided right there and then. They had never expected that Chu Chuyan could actually be this strong! Most people were extremely excited. After all, she represented the daoist sects, so her victory brought them glory too.

Only Wan Guiyi was a bit sulky. He had been quite drawn to Qiu Honglei’s strength previously. After watching her fight round after round, he had actually developed a good impression of her without realizing it. Now, however, her appearance had changed so much. Still, even though she no longer had that beauty of strength from earlier, she was still the same person after all. He really didn’t want to see her just lose like that.

Xie Daoyun looked at Zu An worriedly. These two sweethearts of his were fighting intensely. He’d definitely be really hurt if Qiu Honglei ended up dying during this decisive battle, right? However, apart from a frown, Zu An didn’t look too alarmed. She then looked at Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen, and saw that both of them were calm too. She suddenly thought, Maybe the result hasn’t been decided yet…

Suddenly, the icy white energy gradually scattered, revealing Qiu Honglei inside. There was a layer of glowing moonlight surrounding her entire body that protected her. She wasn’t injured at all.

“Wall of Sighs!” many daoist disciples cried out in surprise. They had seen her use this skill once before, but that wall could only defend against a single direction. They hadn’t expected her to be able to protect her entire body! They had to admit that this Devil Sect witch was really strong.

The light around Qiu Honglei withdrew. She said with a sneer, “Is that all?!”

The two blades in her hand combined together to form an S-shaped blade. Then, she thrust it forth, and endless waves of S-shaped blade ki flew toward Chu Chuyan.

Chu Chuyan’s expression changed. She didn’t dare to face the attack directly. She kicked off the ground and darted to one side. Mere moments after, the blade ki hacked through a centuries-old tree behind where she had just been standing. The cut was completely smooth, like a mirror’s surface. If a person were to take the blow directly with their body, even if they had ki protection, they would likely still be cut in half.

Xie Daoyun clicked her tongue in wonder. She was one of the few who knew what was actually happening. She had thought that Chu Chuyan was too vicious earlier, but now, it seemed that Qiu Honglei wasn’t any better. There was something she was confused about, though. Since they were all good friends of big brother Zu, weren’t they supposed to be getting along? Why were they fighting like irreconcilable adversaries?

Qiu Honglei didn’t hold back at all. Instead, she continued to brandish her Moon Demon Blade. Towering trees collapsed wherever the blade ki passed. Buildings were destroyed, giant boulders crushed…

When they saw the destruction, the eyelids of many of the disciples from the Righteous Sun Sect twitched. Some couldn't help but mutter, “Why is that Chu Chuyan only running away?! So many of the buildings on this mountain are being destroyed!”

Watchful Heart Peak’s chief disciple Zhang Xi shot them a look. He immediately defended his goddess. “It’s not as if you haven’t seen that Moon Demon Blade’s power before. Even Senior Brother Wu’s powerful violet ki and the Green Scaled Armor couldn't stop it. Wouldn’t Fairy Chu be stupid if she took the attack directly?”

Some disciples couldn't help but retort, “But if this continues, Golden Peak might even be entirely destroyed…”

Still, they couldn't win against Chu Chuyan’s fans, who retorted, “Don’t worry, the sect elders definitely won’t let that happen.”

…

Chu Chuyan seemed to overhear their discussions and deliberately avoided important structures like the Pure Yang Palace. Instead, she flew over to the peaks next to it.

Qiu Honglei naturally continued the hunt. The two continued like that, one advancing and the other retreating. As their ki clashed, it caused thunderous rumbles. A string of explosions detonated along the mountain peaks, causing countless boulders to tumble down. Fortunately, this entire place was the Righteous Sun Sect’s territory, so there were no homes for ordinary people. Otherwise, the losses would have been disastrous.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The disciples were envious as they watched. Both of these women were actually already at the master rank! Furthermore, from the looks of it, their cultivations were stable in that realm. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to fly so freely.

The sect masters on Golden Peak cared about their status and pride, so they didn’t fly over themselves. After all, the two competitors were still within their grandmaster rank divine perception.

“Little sister Chu, do you only know how to run? In that case, why don’t you just admit defeat? Don’t worry, as long as you call me big sis a few times, I won’t make things hard for you,” Qiu Honglei said. Even though she had a smile on her face, however, she didn’t loosen up on the attacks at all. Her attacks were heavy, and her opponent’s window to evade grew smaller and smaller.

“Little sister Qiu, did you forget how passionate you were when you called me big sister back in Brightmoon City? Why do you suddenly want me to call you big sister?” Chu Chuyan replied. She looked calm on the surface, as if she didn’t feel anything about her current disadvantaged situation.

Many people on Golden Peak were confused. Why were they fighting over who would be called big sister? Why did they keep bickering over that?

Suddenly, Chu Chuyan waved her long sleeves. Her icicle-like longsword immediately split into two, then two split into four, and four into eight… Eventually, several dozen swords appeared all around her. When Qiu Honglei’s sword ki struck at her again, the swords around her fired outward. They clashed with the blades of light like meteors, releasing a blinding flash.

Xie Daoyun couldn't help but give Zu An a look. Chu Chuyan’s sword technique was quite similar to his skill. Could it be that big brother Zu had secretly taught it to her?

Yun Jianyue frowned slightly as well. She didn’t seem to recall the Snowflake Sword having such a skill, and it was quite similar to that brat Zu An’s attack.

Meanwhile, Yan Xuehen was in a bit of a daze. She thought, Chuyan really is a genius among geniuses! She was able to derive this kind of attack from the Snowflake Sword just from watching Zu An.

…

In the distance, Chu Chuyan and Qiu Honglei continued fighting at the center of the brilliant light. The longsword and curved blade clashed with loud and clear rings.

Qiu Honglei was thinking about how to win when she suddenly heard Chu Chuyan say, “I’ll cover you. Find a chance to run then. Once you leave, there’ll be nothing to worry about for your master.”

Qiu Honglei was stunned. Only then did she understand that Chu Chuyan had begun flying toward this mountain peak on purpose. It was to bring her farther away from Golden Peak. For a moment, she looked conflicted. Then, she smiled sweetly and said, “I can also get away once I defeat you.”

While speaking, her waist twisted. Unlike her previous ferocious attacks, she now practically appeared to be dancing, carrying a mysterious and enchanting sense of charm.

The disciples on Golden Peak all blushed, their breaths quickening. In that instant, they suddenly felt as if the goddess like Chu Chuyan wasn’t as incredible anymore, and that she couldn't compare to the Devil Sect witch. They began to feel that this Devil Sect woman was the most beautiful woman in the world. Many of them were so infatuated they couldn't even control themselves anymore.

Even Wu Xiaofan and Wan Guiyi, who had strong willpower, felt their blood boiling.

“Amitabha buddha!” Master Jian Huang spoke the name of Buddha.

The other sect masters also quickly lectured their own disciples. “That is the Devil Sect’s Heavenly Devil Temptation. All of you, close your eyes and calm your minds! Focus on the self!”

The disciples became a bit more clear-headed again when the sect masters’ pressure surrounded them. They quickly closed their eyes, but deep down, they were still incredibly flustered. Many of them still couldn't help but sneak some looks, but once that happened, they completely lost control.

The sect masters and elders quickly flew around to knock those disciples who had lost themselves unconscious. At the same time, they were really alarmed. Wasn’t this Qiu Honglei’s charm skill too absurd? Forget about the ordinary disciples, even they were starting to feel something. That was equally true for men as well as women.

Xie Daoyun groaned, and couldn't help but fall weakly to the ground. The memory of her nightwear being seen by big brother Zu flooded her mind, but the scene quickly changed. She didn’t know why, but big brother Zu appeared under her covers. Even though she was a bit flustered, she didn’t resist him…

Zhao Xiaodie bit her red lips. An image of Zu An whipping her appeared in her mind. Her body couldn't help but twist around.

Even Chu Chuyan blushed. The intimate times she had spent with Zu An appeared in her mind. Her body couldn't help but increasingly soften…
