Chapter 1627 – Envy, Jealousy, and Hatred

A beautiful figure in a red and black dress walked onto the stage. Her stunning eyes and enthusiastic smile gave people a good impression of her from the very first glance. However, the most eye-catching thing about her was still the waves that rippled when she walked. It made people wonder just how that thin cloth was able to hold it all in.

Zu An was shocked and overjoyed. He had actually been a bit upset when the emperor sent him to Violet Mountain. And yet, not only had he been able to meet Chuyan and Yan Xuehen, now, he could also meet Pei Mianman! It really was unexpected and happy.

Even Yan Xuehen couldn't help but give the young lady a second look. As Chuyan’s master, and after all of the things that had happened with Zu An at the Fiend King Court, she had needed to look into Zu An’s history. As such, she naturally knew of Pei Mianman’s existence. She had to admit that this girl was the polar opposite of Chuyan. One was as cold as ice, while the other was enthusiastic like fire. She wondered just how these two had ended up becoming such close friends.

If not for the fact that Chuyan was cultivating on her own and hadn’t come along, Yan Xuehen would have lectured her a bit on her choice of acquaintances. Isn’t becoming close friends with this kind of woman just inviting a wolf right into the house?

When she saw Pei Mianman’s dynamic figure, she couldn't help but furrow her brows. She’s still so young; just what in the world did she eat to grow so big?

…

“Huh? Why is she also part of the nine sects?” Qiu Honglei cried out in surprise with a strange expression. Another familiar person had shown up, adding another variable to worry about.

“Is that girl from the Cow race or something?” Yun Jianyue muttered, feeling strangely vexed. She was usually quite confident in ‘that’ respect, and yet now, it seemed there were horizons beyond horizons. “Why do you have so many love rivals, and why do they only ever seem to grow more and more powerful?”

Having talked to her disciple all the time, and with Honglei not holding much back, Yun Jianyue already knew practically everything Qiu Honglei knew about Zu An. She naturally knew who Pei Mianman was. Upon finally seeing her for herself, even though she was the Devil Sect Master, Yun Jianyue could still feel a mysterious pressure.

“I’m pretty helpless here too…” Qiu Honglei said, propping up her chin with her hand. “But if you look at it from another perspective, that just means Ah Zu really is charming and I didn’t choose the wrong person.”

Yun Jianyue couldn't help but turn around and stare at her, muttering “Why did I raise such a dumb disciple?”

This girl is normally pretty smart, but why is she becoming dumber and dumber? She isn’t even on guard against me at all and tells me everything.

Qiu Honglei giggled and said casually, “Isn’t it great that I have a smart master to take care of those things?”

Yun Jianyue suddenly asked, “Then what if one day, your master becomes your enemy too?”

Qiu Honglei was stunned. However, she quickly shook her head and said, “That won’t happen. No matter what kind of situation we’re in, I’ll stand on the same side as master.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Yun Jianyue was speechless.

…

Meanwhile, the other disciples’ reactions weren’t any less intense. They all began to ask about the identity of this woman, whose beauty wasn’t inferior to Chu Chuyan’s, and whose chest was just too impressive. When they learned who it was, many of them stated that they would become Miss Pei’s dogs in the future, and that following Fairy Chu or whatever was just heresy.

Because she had already gotten married before, Chu Chuyan’s reputation among the daoist sects had already suffered. However, some people not only felt that there was nothing wrong with her being previously married, but even became more excited.

Despite that, Pei Mianman’s breathtaking entrance suddenly made her even more popular than Chu Chuyan.

“I think I’m really in love with Lady Pei. Her smile is so big… Ahem! I mean, so round… Wait, no! So warm.”

“Is that even love, or are you just after her body? What a pervert.”

“What, are you not the same?”

“My feelings for her are different from yours!”

…

However, their discussions were soon replaced with sighs of admiration, because Pei Mianman placed her hand on the measuring crystal.

A dazzling light appeared as the ranking was announced: Ninth rank!

This delicate and pretty woman was actually at the ninth rank! Many of the arrogant sect disciples all felt their souls leave their bodies. What the hell had they spent all those damn years of cultivation for?

Even Wang Wuxie and the other sect masters couldn't help but give her a second look. Apart from Wan Guiyi, Jadefall Palace actually had such an outstanding disciple? Could it be that in the future, Jadefall Palace would become the number one daoist sect?

Only Huo Ling raised her chin proudly, enjoying the looks of jealousy she was receiving from the different powers.

Qiu Honglei couldn't help but mutter, “Master, is there something wrong with our Holy Sect’s Heavenly Devil Temptation?”

Yun Jianyue replied in confusion, “Of course not. Why are you asking that?”

“I spent so much time in seclusion for the sake of cultivation before, and I couldn't even be around big brother Zu. On several occasions, my cultivation almost deviated; only then did I reach my current level of cultivation. She doesn’t seem to have gone through much, and yet she easily reached roughly the same level,” Qiu Honglei said, starting to wonder whether the Holy Sect’s spiritual cultivation method was inferior to those of the orthodox sects.

Yun Jianyue almost died from anger right there and then. She said, “First of all, her cultivation isn’t at your level. Second, she definitely has to have encountered some opportunities to have cultivated so quickly. This cultivation speed definitely isn’t something those Jadefall Palace disciples can reach.”

Those like Wan Guiyi, who had been nurtured with the entire sect’s best resources, could naturally reach that level. However, it hadn’t even been that long since Pei Mianman had joined Jadefall Palace. Normally, there should have been no reason for her to have advanced so quickly. That meant the only explanation could be that she’d had some special encounters.

“Oh~” Qiu Honglei said with a deep sigh, clearly not too convinced by the explanation.

…

None of the disciples who followed could surpass Pei Mianman in cultivation. That continued until the Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s Zhi Yin.

“Peak stage of the ninth rank!”

Even Watchful Peak’s master, Feng Wuchang, gave him another look. Even though this youngster looked like a pretty boy, his talent was quite high. Apart from Wu Xiaofan, no one else in the Righteous Sun Sect even came close to him.

“As expected of a representative disciple!”

The disciples were all excited and began to discuss who would win the competition.

“I support big brother Zhi Yin!”

“I think Lou Wucheng has a higher chance. He obtained the true inheritance of the Immortal Sword. We can personally witness the power of the Immortal Sword now.”

“Wu Xiaofan should be the number one among the daoist sects’ younger generation, right?”

“Tsk, isn’t that only because the Righteous Sun Sect is now the strongest, and that’s what they’ve been bragging about? In my opinion, Wan Guiyi from Jadefall Palace isn’t inferior to him.”

…

Soon afterward, the representative disciples of the nine sects came out one after another.

White Jade Palace’s Lou Wucheng, peak stage of the ninth rank;

Kunlun Void Sect’s Liang Ling, peak stage of the ninth rank;

Mount Luofu’s Luo Dongjiang, mid stage of the ninth rank;

Purity Temple’s Qiu Chanzi, mid stage of the ninth rank;

Emptiness Isle’s Peng Wuyan, mid stage of the ninth rank;

Supreme Mystery Cave’s Shi Dingtian, mid stage of the ninth rank.

…

Among them, Emptiness Isle’s Peng Wuyan drew quite a bit of attention. Normally, because cultivators gathered the natural ki of the world into their bodies, their skin was normally in excellent condition. Even if the cultivator wasn’t ridiculously handsome or beautiful, they definitely wouldn’t be ugly. However, this Peng Wuyan was exceptionally ugly, to the extent that others wouldn’t want to give her a second glance.

In the meantime, everyone had already gotten used to seeing the White Jade Sect’s Fairy Chu and Jadefall Palace’s Lady Pei. The Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s Princess Butterfly was also present. They were all top-tier beauties. When they saw Peng Wuyan now, they all felt a stark contrast, almost as if it hurt their eyes.

Zu An was a bit confused. He had noticed Peng Wuyan sneaking a few secret looks at him. He clearly didn’t have anything to do with her, so why would she pay attention to him?

Could it be because I;m handsome?

Shortly after, however, a cry of alarm rang out, because Righteous Sun Sect’s Wu Xiaofan stepped forward to test himself. Wu Xiaofan had thick eyebrows and big eyes. He looked very ordinary as well, just like any normal, honest person.

However, his cultivation wasn’t ordinary at all: Master rank! He was so young, and yet he had already reached the master rank! His cultivation speed had to be unprecedented, right?

The sect masters and elders all offered Wang Wuxie their congratulations. Their overwhelming jealousy was evident.

Wang Wuxie had a humble expression, as if to downplay the situation. Inwardly, though, he felt ecstatic, only hoping they would praise him more.

Only Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue had ordinary expressions. In the past, the two of them would have been shocked by such cultivation speed. But after seeing a monster like Zu An, they could only conclude that this Wu Xiaofan was still far too lacking. The two couldn't help but give Zu An a look.

Meanwhile, Zu An was secretly comparing these elites with the Fiend races’ younger generation. The Fiend races’ cultivation ranks were a bit higher. At the very least, master rank wasn’t something to be that happy about. However, the Fiend races relied on awakening their bloodlines to a certain extent, so the rate at which their strength increased was faster than it was for humans to begin with. In contrast, the humans relied on studying and slowly accumulating their strength. At first, they wouldn’t necessarily be able to compare to the Fiend races, but in the upper bounds of the later stages, they could actually reach higher peaks.

Suddenly, more people gasped. As it happened, Jadefall Palace’s Wan Guiyi’s cultivation was shockingly also at the master rank.

Wu Xiaofan had previously been assumed to be the number one among the younger generation. That was why his being at the master rank wasn’t too big of a surprise. However, what no one had expected was that there was actually someone else on par with him. Now, this competition would be even more interesting to watch.

It was now Wan Tongtian’s turn to stick out his chest in pride as he received everyone’s seemingly enthusiastic, but inwardly envious, congratulations. I don’t care! The more jealous you are, the happier I am!

Even Wang Wuxie was feeling a bit jealous. Wan Tongtian gave birth to a good son! If Xuehen and I had ended up together in the past, our child’s talent would definitely be even higher than Wan Guiyi’s.

He couldn't help but feel a bit downcast when he thought of that. He reflexively glanced at Yan Xuehen, and was stunned by what he saw. She seemed to be staring at Zu An absentmindedly.
