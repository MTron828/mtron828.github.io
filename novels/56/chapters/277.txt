Chapter 277: Will You Take Responsibility?

Translator: Pika

Hm?

Despite the obvious alarm in the young lady’s voice, it still sounded extremely pleasant. Moreover, it seemed somewhat familiar.

Even though he hadn’t bumped into her, it was his actions that had indirectly caused her to fall. As someone who came from a different civilized world, he could just ignore this.

He hurriedly got off the horse and asked, “Miss, are you all right?”

Even though the weight of the palanquin and its occupant was heavy, he had little difficulty supporting it thanks to his cultivation. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Unfortunately, his good intentions instead made things worse. There was a sound of something heavy bumping against the side of the palanquin. The sudden movement of the palanquin most likely made its occupant lose her balance. The palanquin rocked back and forth.

“Ah!!!”

Its occupant was clearly having a rough time. She instinctively tried to clamber out of the palanquin. Unfortunately she wasn’t able to steady herself, and fell out instead.

“Be careful!” Zu An hurriedly reached out a hand to support her.

Something soft and gentle landed onto his hand. Zu An was startled.

He was confronted by a lovely but displeased face. Her elegant brows and graceful nose made her seem like a noble lady of the court.

“Miss Zheng, what are you doing here?”

There was no mistaking this woman’s appearance. Who could it be other than Zheng Dan?

Good thing it’s someone I already know. I’ll be in a lot less trouble this way. I wonder if there are the equivalent of car crash scams in this world.

“Ah Zu, why are you here?”

Zheng Dan recognized him as well, a look of pleasant surprise on her face.

“Ahem, ahem~” Sang Qian’s dissatisfied cough came from behind them. “How long are you two planning on embracing each other?”

Only then did they realize that they were snuggled against each other. They leaped apart at once as if shocked by electricity.

Zheng Dan was extremely flustered.

Zu An grew indignant. Why do I feel like I was just caught red-handed while engaging in an affair?

Bro, I just saved your wife! You should be thanking me.

A strange flame burned within Sang Qian. Zheng Dan didn’t even let him hold her hand, yet she was being so intimate with another man right in front of him.

This was the last thing he had expected to witness. Why, then, was there such a strange feeling within him?

“Ah Zu, where are you headed to in such a rush?” Zheng Dan asked. She had finally recovered some of her composure. She fussed at several stray strands of hair which had come loose in the earlier chaos, tucking them behind her ears.

Why are you asking me this and not your fiancée?

Despite his puzzlement, Zu An still replied, “We have things to take care of. We’ll explain things to miss Zheng when we return.”

With that, he mounted his horse.

Zheng Dan took in the surrounding troops from the police camp. “Are you all cracking down on some salt smugglers?” she asked.

Zu An’s narrowed his eyes. “How did you know?’

Were they already exposed?!

Zheng Dan smiled. “There’s no need for you to be nervous. Aren’t the troops at the police camp in charge of capturing those salt smugglers? A large portion of our Zheng clan’s revenue comes from the salt trade, so I’m familiar with these things.”

Her reply helped to settle Zu An’s nerves.

“Take me with you. My Zheng clan also hates these smugglers bitterly,” said Zheng Dan. “I’ve never seen these smugglers get caught, so this’ll be a good experience.”

“Don’t cause trouble. We are taking care of official matters. How can we allow our women to come along with us?” Sang Qian gruffly refused her request.

Zheng Dan smiled. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but I haven’t joined the Sang clan yet. Strictly speaking, I am not the Sang clan’s woman, but rather a daughter of a salt merchant. My request to witness this scene is perfectly reasonable, don’t you think?”

Zu An’s eyes widened as he watched this exchange. Zheng Dan always seemed so warm and reserved before. Why did she suddenly decide to spit in Sang Qian’s face like this?

Isn’t she screwing herself over if she’s going to marry into his family?

Maybe she’s just putting on an act because I’m here? Sigh, it really sucks to be too handsome. You end up ruining other people’s households.

Sang Qian snorted. “So what if that’s the case? We are in a hurry, and your palanquin won’t be able to keep up.”

“I can ride a horse as well!” Zheng Dan proudly tilted her chin upwards, her snow white neck stretching like a beautiful swan.

Sang Qian frowned. “I don’t have any horses that you can ride. These are all army horses, and not for personal use. I’ll be accused of misconduct if I let you ride them.”

Zheng Dan pursed her lips. She knew that he was telling the truth. She found herself in a quandary. Just then, a voice came weakly from off to the side. “This horse of mine isn't an army horse. I can bring you with me.”

Steam almost shot out of Sang Qian’s ears and nose when he heard this. Are you flirting with my fiancée in front of me?

Bring her with you? Are you shitting me? Are the two of you going to ride on the same horse?

How could my subordinates ever respect me again as a commander if they see this happen?

You have successfully trolled Sang Qian for 666 Rage points!

Zu An sneered inwardly. Why does this guy get angry so easily?

Did Zheng Dan really not approach him with ulterior motives this time? Oh baby, that makes things way more interesting.

Zheng Dan considered Zu An for a moment, then looked at Sang Qian. In the end, she shook her head. “Thank you young master for your good intentions,” she said to Zu An, “but there is no need for that.”

If the two of them had been alone, she might have agreed on an impulse. Her honey trap was still in play, after all.

However, riding with another man in such an intimate manner, and in front of so many other witnesses, would definitely mess up the marriage alliance between the Zheng and Sang clans.

The Sang clan would never allow themselves to become laughingstocks.

Even the Zheng clan might start whacking her with broomsticks.

Zu An was only testing the waters—he wouldn’t really be that brazen.

He quickly had one of his guards give up his horse for her. Then, they headed out.

After a stick of incense’s worth of time, their group finally arrived at the pier. The pier was bustling with activity, with countless boatmen busy unloading their cargo.

“Immediately cease everything you are doing! Comply, or you will be executed for smuggling without exception!” Sang Qian hollered.

He was already furious to begin with. It felt good to finally have a channel to vent his resentment.

His voice carried loudly across the pier, and his command was backed up by his soldiers dispersing across the pier. All other activity ceased in an instant.

Zu An was a bit alarmed. This guy is actually pretty strong.

“Zu An, according to your sources, who is the one engaging in the salt smuggling?” Sang Qian didn’t bother being polite.

Zu An frowned. He didn’t know which clan it was exactly. Qiu Honglei’s intelligence wasn’t that detailed.

His mind raced, and he thought up a suitable response. “We’ll investigate the goods first!”

The illicit salt trade could generate staggering returns, but it was also dangerous. If the smugglers shifted too little each time, then they wouldn’t make much profits. If they tried to shift their goods too often, then the risk would increase greatly. That was why they had to find one chance to smuggle in a lot of their product.

Sang Qian nodded. With a wave of his hand, his subordinates fanned out.

Their search provided instant results. A group of soldiers brought a middle-aged man up to Zu An and Sang Qian. “Reporting! Most of the goods on the pier belong to his clan.”

Zu An looked at this middle-aged man once over. His appearance was completely ordinary, and wouldn’t have stood out in a crowd.

The only thing worth noting was his smooth skin and his hands which were not callused. It was obvious that this guy normally lived quite the good life.

“Uncle Hou, what are you doing here?” Zheng Dan suddenly said in surprise.

Zu An was startled. He turned around to face her. “Do you recognize this person?”

Zheng Dan nodded. “He is our Zheng clan’s butler, Hou Yun. Father has put him in charge of many things.”

“Oh?” Zu An’s expression grew immediately curious.

A thought surfaced in his mind. Zheng Dan’s sudden appearance might not actually be a coincidence.

After all, they had been stalled for almost an hour because of her. Maybe she was trying to buy time.

Does that mean that Sang Qian has no clue, then?

Sang Qian questioned the butler. “Hou Yun, what are you doing here?”

“Some goods that our Zheng clan imported were scheduled to arrive today, so I came to monitor the situation.” Hou Yun replied with an apologetic smile.

“Since these goods belong to the Zheng clan, there shouldn’t be any issues. Examine the other goods.” Sang Qian waved his hand, indicating that he was letting this matter go.

“Hold on!” Zu An ordered.

What the heck is going on here? How can this guy be let off that easily? There was no way Zu An was going to let this matter rest just like that. He stared straight at Hou Yun and asked, “What goods were you expecting today?”

“Just some ordinary goods,” Hou Yun replied respectfully.

“Don’t feign ignorance. What are they?” Zu An said fiercely.

Zheng Dan stepped forward. “Ah Zu, are you suspecting my Zheng clan of taking part in the illicit salt trade?”

Zu An snorted in his heart. Is there even a doubt? Could it be any more clear? Who would have expected the Zheng clan, one of Brightmoon City’s biggest salt merchants, to be engaged in the illicit salt trade?

It kind of makes sense, though. The Chu clan dominated the market share for salt in Brightmoon City, while the remainder was split between the other three clans. This was certainly not enough to satisfy their appetites.

There was no way Zu An would voice his suspicions out loud. “Of course not,” he said instead. “However, I am worried that some of your subordinates might be a little too daring, and do some foolish things under the Zheng clan’s name. If such matters were to be explosively revealed later on, the Zheng clan’s reputation will be severely tarnished! That’s why we should still examine this matter carefully.”

Zheng Dan smiled. “Ah Zu has thought things out well.”

She turned to Hou Yun and said, “Uncle Hou, did you hear what he said? Just report things as they are.” Her voice remained as calm as the surface of a winter lake.

Zu An sighed secretly in admiration. He really had no idea anymore if this woman was innocent, or if she was just pretending. Her acting skills truly were amazing.

“We’re expecting some cotton and other raw materials. The Zheng clan runs a large clothing business. Transporting these things shouldn’t be illegal, right?” Hou Yun bit out. He was in a sour mood after having been doubted, and his reply carried more than its fair share of attitude.

“What about the gate procedures and the written official approval? Bring them out so we can have a look.” Zu An reached out a hand.

Sang Qian gave him a sideways glance. Didn’t everyone call this guy an ignorant and incompetent fool? Why does he know about all these things?

This was where he was mistaken. While Brightmoon Academy’s Yellow class received few lessons on matters relating to cultivation, they were lectured often on practical and business matters.

Many students found these lectures boring, but Zu An listened to everything he could, in order to gain a better understanding of this world.

Such a large shipment of goods definitely required corresponding official approvals.

Hou Yun gave Sang Qian an inquiring look. Sang Qian snorted. “What are you looking at me for? Zu An is here representing Brightmoon Duke. Do as he says.”

“Yes, yes, yes~” Hou Yun immediately handed over the official documents.

Zu An examined them, and noted that they were indeed for cotton and other raw materials.

Despite the official documentation, he still had his doubts. He walked straight up to the cargo ship. “Open up the cabin! I want to search this place.”

Hou Yun immediately grew angry. “But the goods have already been properly stowed! If you open up the cabin now and search it, we would have to load everything up again, and we’ll be delayed by at least a day! Our Zheng clan has to pay compensation if the goods do not reach their destination on time.”

Zu An ignored his protests and repeated coldly, “Open up the cabin!”

With a wave of his hand, the Chu clan’s guards spread out to secure key areas of the ship. They were ready to make a move if given the order.

Hou Yun’s darkened further. He said fiercely, “If you don’t find anything, will you take responsibility for the Zheng clan’s losses?”
