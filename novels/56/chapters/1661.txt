Chapter 1610 – Infatuation

One of the two, a young lady, muttered quietly, “The powerful cultivators of the nine daoist sects are all here. The two of us are from the Devil Sect, so I can’t help but feel as if we’re walking straight into a tiger’s den.”

The older one scolded her. “It’s the Holy Sect! What Devil Sect?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The young lady couldn't help but grumble, “That’s what everyone calls it though, and I think it sounds pretty good.”

“Other people call us the Devil Sect to slander us. Why are you also saying it? Did your brain rot or something?” the older one replied in annoyance.

“But doesn’t even master call us the Devil Sect sometimes?” the young lady retorted, sticking out her tongue. She hugged the older one while acting like a spoiled child.

The other disciples all glanced at them. They thought to themselves, That woman is so ugly, and yet is still trying to act cute; how disgusting. But that little tongue of hers is still pretty cute…

The young lady shot all of them a look and said, “If not for the fact that we can’t let our identities be exposed today, I would already have dug out their eyes.”

The older woman said with a slight smile, “That’s more like our Devil… Ahem, Holy Sect’s style. Focus. We’re almost at the mountain gate. They seem to be checking something there.”

…

The two of them quickly arrived at the mountain gate. There was a group of Righteous Sun Sect disciples standing there, all standing with upright postures. Their ki surged powerfully around them, showing that they had excellent cultivations.

The older lady sighed, saying, “Just a single Righteous Sun Sect already has so many talented people; even the disciples watching the gate are so strong. Things are going to become more and more difficult for our Holy Sect in the future.”

The young lady tried to make her feel better by saying, “Master, don’t think too much of it. These were clearly carefully selected talents, put here to serve as a shop front. It’s definitely not representative of their disciples’ average level. Those daoist hypocrites love doing that kind of thing.”

The older woman nodded in agreement, saying, “You’re right. That stone cold woman’s sect in particular loves doing these things. Your master was too worried for nothing.”

Naturally, these two were the Devil Sect’s Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei. They had both changed their appearance. Even someone such as Zu An, who was very familiar with them, would find it difficult to recognize them.

“Guests, please wait for a moment,” a Righteous Sun Sect disciple called out when they arrived in front of the mountain, approaching them and adding in a refined and courteous manner, “Do these guests here have an invitation letter?” Afterward, seemingly concerned that the guests would be unhappy, he quickly added, “Each year, many people come to admire Violet Mountain. There are many people joining the Nine Sects Competition this time and it is impossible to recognize everyone. In order to prevent our competition from being disturbed by bystanders, we have decided to go through this process. I hope that seniors can forgive us for this.”

Yun Jianyue nodded slightly. Qiu Honglei then handed over a jade tile with a big smile. The Righteous Sun Sect disciple sighed in relief when he saw the jade tile. It was a specially made invitation tile made by the Righteous Sun Sect. It wasn’t something outsiders could imitate.

But which sect is this junior sister from? Her mental cultivation really is powerful. She clearly looks so… and yet she can still be so optimistic. She really is a model for us to learn from.

When he saw the information on the jade tile, he couldn't help but exclaim in astonishment, “So it was Emptiness Isle’s Elder Peng; it’s an honor! Please follow this path up the mountain; that is where the golden peak is located. There will be a disciple there to arrange your check-in…” As he spoke, he called over a junior brother to guide them.

Yun Jianyue nodded and walked in that direction. Qiu Honglei quickly followed along, thinking that her master was really composed. I’m about to die from nervousness at the thought of being exposed.

…

When they left, some of the Righteous Sun Sect disciples secretly conversed through ki.

“I heard that the nine sects have had different levels of development for some time. Many of the sects have already fallen. But I thought that no matter how bad it was, it couldn’t be to that extent, right? But today, I’ve realized the truth. This is all the people who came from Emptiness Isle? And it’s only an elder leading the way. The disciple’s cultivation doesn’t seem to be all that impressive either.”

“What’s going on with that Elder Peng in front? I’ve never heard of this person before, and yet she put on such arrogant airs, not even willing to speak much with us. She clearly looks down on us.”

“I’ve actually heard of a strange-tempered woman from Emptiness Isle surnamed Peng. But she usually remains in seclusion and rarely comes out. Between that and her irascible temper, no one likes her. That’s why it’s best not to provoke her. She is still an elder, after all.”

“We’re not that dumb, okay?”

“Also, their looks are quite… unique. They don’t look anything like our majestic sect.”

Their leader scolded them just then. “One’s appearance is dictated by nature. All of you, watch your mouths!”

“Yes, senior brother!” the others replied, shivering. They didn’t dare to keep joking around in private anymore.

…

Because Violet Mountain was located in Yi Commandery, there had long been many myths and legends surrounding it since ancient times. In the past, because the Righteous Sect’s Sect Master at the time, Wang Wuxie, had supported the founding emperor, he was given Purple Mountain as his own dao rite for his contributions. Furthermore, he had been given the title of State Teacher.

Even though Violet Mountain was only a few hundred li from Yi City, its status in Yi Commandery was extraordinary. They were outside the jurisdiction of the local government or King Yan Manor.

The vast Violet Mountain Range extended for thousands of li. However, everyone often calls Violet Mountain the territory of the Righteous Sun Sect. Apart from the main peak Crouching Cloud Crown, there is also Heavenly Lake Peak, White Dragon Peak, Heavenly Bamboo Peak, Watchful Heart Peak, Restful Heart Peak, Immortal Rock Cliff, Thunder Peak, and other smaller peaks. Even smaller peaks than these were too many to count.

Those peaks were often occupied by the sect’s elders and other individuals with extraordinary status. They cultivated on those peaks with their disciples.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An’s group proceeded toward Violet Mountain. A journey of several hundred li would take at least a few days for an army from the ancient world, but this was a world of cultivation. The Armed Escort Division was a carefully selected army consisting solely of cultivators. Their mounts were of excellent breeds, so they arrived at the foot of Violet Mountain in just half a day.

When he heard Xie Daoyun’s description, Zu An couldn't help but sigh in amazement at the Righteous Sun Sect’s history. No wonder they had come to lead the nine daoist sects.

“The violet ki that rises each day in Violet Mountain is of great benefit to cultivation, and it can promote the growth of all kinds of spiritual medicines and mineral resources. That’s why the Righteous Sun Sect has only grown stronger and stronger over the years,” Xie Daoyun explained as she followed behind him in a normal soldier outfit. She really was pretty and especially endearing.

Zu An asked Xie Daoyun curiously, “Just what kind of background does this violet ki have? Has no one been able to figure it out in the past thousand years?”

“Many learned people have entered the mountains to investigate before, but they all returned without any new information,” Xie Daoyun said, shaking her head. “In the last hundred years, Violet Mountain became the dao rite of the Righteous Sun Sect. After that, no one was allowed to enter the mountains to investigate.”

Zu An chuckled and remarked, “If it were me, I wouldn’t want my territory’s secrets to be known by the entire world either.”

Nearby, Zhang Zijiang and Wang Bolin speculated as they watched the two chat happily. If they had such a pretty personal attendant, how great would that be? Every night back at their tents would simply be wonderful. The two reflexively looked at the boorish men around them. They immediately felt their stomachs churn.

Zu An then asked more about the State Teacher, Wang Wuxie. Xie Daoyun replied, “The State Teacher is an exceedingly talented individual. In the past, the Righteous Sun Sect was actually one of the lower mid-ranked sects. It was through his own strength alone that the sect reached its current heights.

“He rose above all of his peers in the Righteous Sun Sect at a young age, then seized the victory in the Nine Sects Competition, establishing the record of being the youngest one to win in history. His appearance was also handsome and refined, capturing the hearts of countless female cultivators back then. Unfortunately, even until now, he has never gotten married.”

Zu An was stunned, saying, “He’s the State Teacher and even part of the daoist sects. He can still take on a wife and have children?”

“Of course. Among the nine sects, apart from the White Jade Sect and a few other daoist sects that don’t practice marriage, the other sects have no such restrictions. Of course, as cultivators, they don't really encourage it either.”

Zu An thought, What kind of stupid rules are these? It’s really harming my relationship with Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan.

“You made him sound so amazing, and yet he never got married his whole life. Does he not like women?” Zu An asked curiously.

Xie Daoyun replied with a blush, “What are you thinking? The reason why he’s never gotten married is because of one woman.”

Zu An was stunned, asking, “Just which woman has such charm, to leave such an outstanding man in that state?”

“You’ve met that woman before,” Xie Daoyun said with a smile.

Zu An was stunned. Suddenly, his expression changed and he asked, “It’s not the White Jade Sect’s Sect Master Yan again, is it?”

“Who else could it be?” Xie Daoyun replied with an expression that seemed to be saying ‘of course’.

Zu An was speechless.
