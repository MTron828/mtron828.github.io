Chapter 1792: Demonic Voice of the Ghost King

The Ghost King’s giant ghost face was made up of black mist and skulls. As the skulls moved around, they resembled a burning fire. When he heard Zu An’s explanation, he clearly stopped for a moment. Then, he said in an eerie voice, “Youngster, you seem careless on the surface, but you are actually quite cunning.”

Meanwhile, Zhao Han nodded in deep sympathy. Originally, he had considered Zu An no different from an ant. However, this brat really had come up with all sorts of annoyances and even put him somewhat on guard.

Zu An continued, “Also, when I encountered Zhao Han, whether it was Jing Teng or Honglei, both of them were incredibly nervous. Normally, with Wei Suo’s nature, he should have been shaking all over, yet you weren’t. I could sense calm hidden within the depths of your expression.”

Now, the others really felt admiration for him. After all, in that life-and-death situation, he actually still had room to observe the one in the corner who didn’t have much of a presence at all!

Zu An looked at Wei Suo, who was lying on the ground under the giant ghost face; it was uncertain whether he was dead or alive. He had no idea when the Ghost King had possessed him. After some hesitation, he decided not to ask the Ghost King about Wei Suo’s condition. If the Ghost King found out that he actually cared a lot, it would only bring Wei Suo even more danger.

“You are indeed a meticulous person. No wonder Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick died at your hand,” the Ghost King said, nodding in admiration. He then turned to Zhao Han and asked, “Just who are you? Why have I never heard of you before?”Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Someone this formidable shouldn’t have been unknown in the world for so long.

Zhao Han harrumphed. “I am merely passing by. I have no intention of being your enemy.” He actually felt a bit of apprehension after that momentary clash. If they could avoid conflict, that would be for the best.

The Ghost King also hesitated. Zhao Han was clearly stronger than he had imagined. Dealing with him wouldn’t be that easy.

Just then, however, Zu An said, “His majesty is experiencing heaven and man deterioration right now. This matter is related to an immortal opportunity, so he must obtain it. If I’m not mistaken, Ghost King should also be interested in the immortal opportunity. Miss Jing, you’re familiar with this great tomb. Are there two immortal opportunities?”

Jing Teng was smart, so she deliberately raised her voice somewhat as she replied, “Of course there’s only one. Since it’s called an immortal opportunity, only the destined can obtain it. How can there be several shares for everyone to enjoy?”

The Ghost King and Zhao Han’s expressions immediately changed when they heard that. They knew that Zu An was sowing dissent, but this was an unavoidable conflict. Unless one side gave up, there would eventually be a decisive battle.

More importantly, Zu An was especially vicious, even giving away that Zhao Han was going to pass away soon and had been looking for this immortal opportunity to save his life. As such, the Ghost King also realized that there was no chance of Zhao Han giving up on the opportunity. In that case, continuing the battle while the other side was injured was the best chance to completely erase his competitor.

Having made up his mind, the Ghost King’s large face rushed straight at Zhao Han.

A fierce look flickered across Zhao Han’s face as well. As he faced his opponent, his entire body erupted with golden light. He wanted to see just what this world’s most terrifying Ghost King had for himself.

In their eyes, the greatest competitors in the great tomb were each other. As for Zu An’s group, even if they had some tricks, they were still mere ants. As such, they could be dealt with later. Eliminating their greatest foe was the most important thing.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing quickly ran to one side. A battle at this level would leave them severely injured just by being caught up in the blast waves.

Zhao Han quickly rushed into the center of the black mist. Endless skeletons charged at him. His entire body overflowed with golden light as he threw punches with his left hand and used skills with his right. Both sides struck ferociously, with each strike blasting many skulls to pieces.

Zu An and the others were in awe as they watched. On the surface, Zhao Han’s punches seemed ordinary, but he had clearly already reached the realm of retracing the original path. He didn’t need any fancy techniques, as every attack carried the brilliant power of an emperor. Compared to the Ghost King’s sinister style of fighting, his style looked more domineering.

Now that both sides had started fighting, Zu An didn’t try to run anymore. He remained in place to see if he could take advantage of the aftermath. After all, even though both the Ghost King and Zhao Han believed that they had already learned his true capabilities, in reality, they had still underestimated him. He had enough power to affect the battle’s conclusion.

Suddenly, Zhao Han frowned, because he discovered that no matter how many of those skulls he shattered, his opponent’s energy wasn’t affected in the slightest. On the contrary, the aura around the skulls was incredibly treacherous, so he ended up becoming affected a bit. Even though it wasn’t much, as time went on, he would eventually be at a disadvantage.

Zu An nodded inwardly, thinking,?It seems like what Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick said was true. This Ghost King seems to be immune to physical attacks.

Zhao Han released a cold snort and suddenly landed on the ground. A golden figure rose from above him and formed the projection of a golden-armored war god; it was his primordial spirit. He had clearly noticed that physical attacks were useless and wouldn’t be enough to defeat his opponent.

When his primordial spirit left his body, the black mist immediately pulled back substantially. Quite a few skulls even directly melted. The golden giant’s fist scattered the black mist, and endless skulls screamed as they fled in disarray.

However, the golden giant sneered and grabbed toward them with its massive hand. All of the surrounding space seemed to be restrained. Many skulls that looked as if they were about to escape ended up being caught. The great hand clenched, and the skulls screamed bitterly, turning to scattered ashes.

…

Li Changsheng was completely dazzled. Was this what a battle between earth immortals was like? When would he be able to reach such a level?

Meanwhile, Xuan Bajing was eagerly bootlicking. “Your majesty is without equal, as expected! Long live, long long live the emperor!”

Jing Teng couldn't help but give Zu An a look. This emperor was actually so powerful, but more importantly, Zu An had offended someone so formidable?

Qiu Honglei also looked as if she had a huge headache. The stronger Zhao Han was, the greater the pressure she felt. Whether it was her identity as a part of the Devil Sect or her relationship with Ah Zu, both made her an absolute enemy of the emperor.

Meanwhile, Zu An observed the battle with a grave expression. He believed that the Ghost King definitely wouldn’t be defeated by just that.

…

.

Sure enough, there was no look of happiness on Zhao Han’s face. Rather, he looked in a certain direction.

The black mist gathered in that spot once more. Countless skulls gathered to form a giant ghost face. It said in a low, muffled voice, “Interesting…”

Zhao Han frowned, thinking,?Is this guy immune to all attacks? But that’s impossible! How can this world have something so incomprehensible? There has to be a way to deal with it! It’s just that I haven’t found it yet.

Suddenly, the giant ghost face looked at the golden giant and laughed, remarking, “A soul? That’s my favorite.” As soon as he spoke, he opened his giant mouth and unleashed waves of shrill screams. A terrifying ripple of sound passed through the air.

After hearing all the activity, a group of people tried to come closer to see what was happening. However, when they drew near, despite being strong individuals in their own right, they couldn't hold on. Their souls flew straight out of their bodies.

Even though those souls struggled frantically to hold onto their bodies, the shrill screams continued, making their struggles futile. Countless struggling souls entered the giant ghost face’s mouth. That ghost face had a satisfied expression as it appeared to start chewing.

“Demonic Voice of the Ghost King!” Zu An cried out in horror. Hidden Dragon had described the Ghost King’s ultimate skill before.

Fortunately, he’d had the foresight to bring the others some distance away. Even so, he had still felt his mind tremble. The women were in even worse condition, their expressions turning somewhat blank. Zu An immediately used Hundredwarble and Lion’s Roar, using sound against sound. Only then did they wake up a bit.

“We’re leaving!” Zu An said. He didn’t dare to remain any longer, because he saw that Zhao Han’s primordial spirit was also affected. He was clearly at an absolute disadvantage. If they remained here, not only would they not benefit from the conflict, they would be caught up in the disaster.

Jing Teng’s mind became clear again. She knew that the situation was dangerous and hurriedly led the group to a wall. The others didn’t know what she did, but the wall suddenly opened and the group went inside. Only then did that frightening pressure disappear.

Meanwhile, Zhao Han saw their movements, but he was completely powerless to stop them. In fact, it was a little difficult for him to even protect himself. He could sense that a terrifying power was trying to cut the connection between his primordial spirit and his flesh. He knew that even though his primordial spirit was powerful, the world was a sea of bitterness, while the flesh was the boat that protected it. If it fell into the sea from the boat, it would no longer have a root to attach to. Eventually, it would completely break and collapse. Then, he would no longer be able to resist the Ghost King’s absorption, and he could even become its food.

…

While he was doing what he could to resist, Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing were also struggling bitterly. They were famous grandmasters in their own right, as well as the leaders of their sects. The secret techniques they knew also far exceeded those of normal grandmasters. They both used their respective skills to protect their souls, so they didn’t have their souls immediately sucked out like the others around them.

Still, as time went on, they were shocked to discover that they were about to fail themselves! Their souls gradually began to leave their bodies. They frantically clung to their bodies while pleading with Zhao Han, “Your majesty, save me!”
