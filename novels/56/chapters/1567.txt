Chapter 1516: I Came at the Wrong Time

As she left through the door, Yan Xuehen hesitated for a moment. She thought, What if Zu An is together with Yu Yanluo? If she barged in in the dead of night, there was a high chance that there would be a misunderstanding.

She took a few steps back, but her mind was a mess. She couldn't calm herself down to meditate at all. In the end, she clenched her teeth and decided to continue forward.

Even if it’s embarrassing to look for Zu An, it should be fine for me to seek out Yu Yanluo for some chit-chat, right? she thought, surprising herself with her own wit. She thus sought out a palace maid to ask about Yu Yanluo’s whereabouts.

The palace maid recognized Yan Xuehen as one of the grandmasters who had fought in the skies for the Second Empress’ side. Yan Xuehen looked so quiet and transcendent that it was hard to refuse her. As such, she respectfully replied, “The Medusa Queen needed to take care of some Snake race affairs and has already left the palace.”

“Left the palace?” Yan Xuehen repeated, stunned. However, she quickly realized what was happening. The Second Empress had definitely promised the Snake race some generous conditions, so Yu Yanluo had needed to hurry back to discuss things with her clansmen and bring some people over to the Fiend King Court to see things through. After all, the Snake race’s rise was already inevitable, and they definitely didn’t have enough representatives in the Fiend King Court.

“Then what about Zu An?” she asked, feigning nonchalance. However, she laughed inwardly in self-mockery. Why did she have to go this far with a maid?

“The Regent is overseeing her highness and the young prince from a nearby residence to prevent any evildoers from starting any trouble in the palace,” the maid replied.

She and her fellow maids grew excited as soon as they heard the name ‘Zu An’. Word of Zu An’s powerful achievements had quickly spread throughout the entire Imperial Palace. This world worshiped the strong, let alone someone who was so handsome on top of that.

When she saw the maids’ starstruck eyes, Yan Xuehen thought, Zu An really is always surrounded by these love affairs. My… disciple will probably end up encountering a lot of future troubles.

Regent… That woman really is going all out!

As the White Jade Sect’s master, she naturally knew what kind of authority a Regent symbolized in the history of the Fiend races.

Her pretty brows couldn't help but furrow when she thought about how Zu An was located near the Second Empress’ chambers.

Don’t tell me fiend women don’t understand the concept of laying low?

Of course, even though she was a bit unhappy, she didn’t think too much of it. There were just too many things that had happened during the night, and it was almost daybreak. At dawn, the young prince would ascend to the throne, and everyone present would become awfully busy. They would all have too many responsibilities, so how could anything happen?

She expressed her thanks to the maid, and with a tap of her toes, she swiftly floated into the distance.

The maids’ little mouths hung wide open. They all had looks of envy. One exclaimed, “If I were as formidable as Lady Yan… No, even just a tenth of how amazing she is would be enough!”

“Hmph, even a wench like you has such high demands? I’d be fully satisfied if I could have even a tenth of her beauty,” another remarked.

The other maids all stared at her, replying, “Isn’t your requirement even higher?”

…

Yan Xuehen naturally wasn’t paying attention to the conversation of the maids behind her. She quickly arrived outside the Second Empress’ chambers.

She had always enjoyed peace and quiet. She didn’t want her unannounced visit to Zu An’s place to be known by more people, so she didn’t alarm the guards outside. Her figure was like a wisp of smoke as she quickly entered the empress’ palace.

Her divine will slowly spread out. Soon afterward, she cast her gaze onto a side chamber. Her usually cold gaze gave way to a hint of a gentle smile. That was Zu An’s aura. Her gait quickened as she walked over, but she suddenly slowed down again. There was another person’s aura there.

It was the Second Empress!CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The gentle look between her brows instantly disappeared. What were a grown man and woman all alone in a room together for?

Still, she quickly calmed herself down. Zu An had already become the one the Second Empress relied on the most. It was understandable for her to discuss national affairs with him.

She felt more at ease now when she thought of that. As such, she stopped in place and admired the moon for a bit. She decided not to disturb their official business for the time being.

She planned to seek out Zu An after the two finished their chat. She didn’t want to meet with the Second Empress, in order to avoid trouble. She had always enjoyed peace and quiet, and didn’t like such social affairs.

Just like that, she continued to stand there for an indeterminate amount of time. At some point, a cold wind blew past, bringing with it a leaf that landed on Yan Xuehen’s head.

Yan Xuehen removed the leaf from her head, feeling a bit surprised. The Fiend races’ territory was located in the northern frontier, and it was winter right now, and yet there were still green leaves. She had to admit that the Fiend races’ royal family really was impressive. They were able to raise many trees that could only be found in the sunny south.

But why are they still not done after chatting for so long?

She hadn’t probed the interior with her divine sense out of courtesy and her own pride. But now, she found it a bit hard to hide her curiosity.

If it were anyone else, with the Unshaken Daoist Manual that Yan Xuehen cultivated, she wouldn’t even have that thought. However, when it was related to Zu An, she felt as if her heart were being clawed at.

After some hesitation, she muttered to herself, “I have to see if something unexpected happened inside. Zu An won against those grandmasters, but he might have an internal injury that has only flared up now…”

When she thought of that, it was even harder for her to resist. She quickly extended her divine sense inside. For a grandmaster, divine sense was just like one’s eyes. Even if there was a wall in between, they could see everything clearly.

Hm? Why is the Second Empress collapsed on the ground? Wait, she seems to be kneeling on the floor.

What’s up with Ah Zu? Why are his eyes closed as if he’s in pain?

From her viewing angle, she could only see the Second Empress from behind. The empress’ body was blocking what was happening, so she couldn't exactly see what was going on.

As such, she extended her divine sense a bit deeper to look from a different angle. However, when she did that, her pretty eyes immediately widened. She was completely shocked by the scene.

She saw the Second Empress supporting her heaping mounds, then lowering her head just like that…

There’s even something like that?!

Is this woman not scared of choking to death?

In the end, the problem was that Yan Xuehen was too detached from the secular world and naturally gave off a distant air to the people around her. People all treated her like a goddess and chose their words carefully. Nobles were always scared of being shown disgust by such a goddess; between that and her upbringing, she was as innocent as a white sheet of paper in this regard. Even though she had shared physical intimacy with Zu An, she still knew far less than even young virgins and unmarried maidens.

If it were the Devil Sect’s Yun Jianyue, she would have already known what they were doing just from seeing the empress’ back.

Still, no matter how innocent Yan Xuehen was, she still knew what was happening when she saw the scene. She glowered. A layer of ice began to spread outward from her, covering everything in the vicinity.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +999 +999 +999…

When Yan Xuehen’s divine will entered the room, Zu An had already noticed it. However, while he was in heaven, his reaction speed was naturally a bit slow. Only when he saw the backend explode with Rage points did he snap out of his daze.

I’m finished! I’m done for!

Yan Xuehen’s gaze was completely cold. She turned around and left.

Zu An panicked and got up to chase after her.

The Second Empress felt a bitter chill sweep over her. She reflexively covered herself with her clothes. She wondered why she suddenly felt cold, but how could she have expected Zu An to suddenly stand up? She clutched her mouth and moved to one side, holding onto the table as she began to cough fiercely.

Zu An felt apologetic when he saw that. If he just ran away from the situation, that would be trashy of him and it would create a rift between them. It wouldn’t be good for their cooperation in the future. As such, he gently patted her back to help her sort out her condition.

When the empress recovered a bit, Zu An quickly ran out the door. However, how could he possibly catch up to Yan Xuehen?

“What’s wrong?” a tender voice called out. It turned out that the Second Empress had emerged while holding her clothes tightly around her, a pitiful look on her face. What had just happened left her confused. She thought that perhaps she had done something wrong.
