Chapter 1205: Cards Laid on the Table

Zu An reacted quickly, however. He replied, “Oh, it might be the smell of medicinal ointment.” He pointed at the Myriad Flower Ointment by the bed.

Yan Xuehen gave it a look and exclaimed, “Hm? This medicine seems to be quite the precious item.” With her knowledge and insight, she was naturally able to distinguish which medicines were good.

Zu An chuckled and said, “A good friend gave it to me.”

Little Blue smiled sweetly inside the cabinet when she heard him call her a good friend. Little White thought that he was talking about the Hundred Herb Pill she had given him, so she grinned as well. Neither of them could see each other, but both of their hearts were pounding crazily.

If Yan Xuehen hadn’t been seriously injured, with her cultivation, she would immediately have noticed the two of them.

“I’m guessing it was given to you by those Snake race girls,” Yan Xuehen said. She suddenly felt annoyed for some reason, especially when she recalled how Zu An hadn’t refused anyone when those Snake race women had flocked around him enthusiastically.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +53 +53 +53…

Zu An thought to himself, Don’t you cultivate the Unshakable Daoist Manual? Why are you always getting angry so easily?

Of course, he wouldn’t be so stupid as to directly ask something like that. He suddenly thought of something and changed the topic, asking, “Sect master, can you help me apply the medicine? It’s a bit difficult on my own.”

Yan Xuehen was a bit stunned. Her expression became a bit unnatural. In the past, no man would have dared to propose such a thing before her. There was no way she would have had any type of physical contact with another man either. In contrast, this fellow didn’t seem to treat her as an outsider at all.

But her many years of habit made her instinctively refuse. “I will do no such thing!”

“Oh…” Zu An said with a regretful sigh.

Yan Xuehen felt herself soften a bit when she saw his disappointment. She suddenly remembered that he had just fought such a great battle, and that it had mainly been to protect her and Yun Jianyue after the Golden Crow Crown Prince favored them. The reason why he had been injured so badly was also because of her…

She suddenly felt a bit apologetic. She sat down next to him and picked up the Myriad Flower Ointment, saying, “Take off your clothes.”

Zu An was stunned. He had only planned to say that to distract her, and had never expected her to actually agree! He took off his clothes in confusion.

Yan Xuehen’s fine cheeks began to burn when she looked at his body up close. She thought to herself that if he said anything along the lines of telling her she owed him again, she would immediately fight him.

Fortunately, Zu An didn’t say anything. She sighed in relief, and began to help him apply the medicine with her ice-cold fingers. She couldn't help but tremble when she felt his boiling hot skin. Only after a while did she calm down and say, “Your wounds seem to have already been properly treated.”

Zu An said without any sense of shame, “There are still some wounds that haven’t been properly treated. Since you’re here now, I’ll have to trouble you.” He made it sound as if he had been struggling to apply the medicine on himself previously.

Yan Xuehen harrumphed. “What’s with that Yu Yanluo? She’s an honorable clan leader, yet she didn’t send anyone to take care of you.”

Little Blue felt angry and frustrated. She was supposed to have been the one to help her big brother Zu apply that medicine, yet now, another woman had ended up taking her spot!

But when they heard the other woman actually criticizing Yu Yanluo, she and Little White were both stunned. They had thought that she was big brother Zu’s concubine, and thus the little sister of the main wife, the clan leader. But judging from those words, that didn’t seem to be the case.

Zu An chuckled in embarrassment and said, “Yanluo sent someone, but I wasn’t too used to being served and had her leave.”

Yan Xuehen felt annoyed when she heard how affectionately he said ‘Yanluo’.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +58 +58 +58…

“Hiss…” Zu An sucked air in through his teeth.

Only then did Yan Xuehen notice that she had accidentally jabbed his wound with her finger. She felt apologetic and moved more gently. However, she wasn’t willing to admit that openly. Instead, she said, “I have a question. I need you to answer me honestly.”

Zu An suddenly sighed and replied,“I know what you want to ask about. But, you have to promise not to get mad after you hear the answer.”

Yan Xuehen panicked when she heard that. Is it really as I suspected?

Zu An continued and said, “Indeed, last time, we were in a moment of life and death, so I couldn't be bothered to have so many misgivings. I used everything I had and harmed you. I’m really sorry.”

Yan Xuehen’s entire body trembled. She cried, “Then why did you refute that when I asked you last time?!”

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +555 +555 +555…

Zu An had a bitter smile as he replied, “It wasn’t a good time to tell you the truth then.”

Yan Xuehen’s expression turned cold. She shot back, “So now, when I’m not your match, you dare to speak the truth?”

“That’s not what I’m saying,” Zu An said, shaking his head. “I could have chosen to never tell you the truth, but I still didn’t want to lie to you.”

Yan Xuehen knew that what he said was the truth. If he had never admitted to it, even if she suspected something, she would have no proof. But this matter was just too ridiculous. She retorted, “What, am I supposed to thank you for being honest then?”

“Um… I mean, you can thank me if you really want to,” Zu An said, feigning a shy expression..

Yan Xuehen was dumbfounded. She was so angry that she pinched Zu An. How could this guy be so shameless?!

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +66 +66 +66…

Zu An screamed bitterly. The two young ladies in the wardrobe were furious. Why was this woman so fierce? Their big brother Zu was still injured! If they weren’t hidden in the wardrobe, they might already have barged out to criticize her.

Yan Xuehen took a deep breath. She suppressed her surging emotions and said coldly, “Is your skill some kind of Gu bug technique?”

Zu An shook his head and said, “It’s a technique from the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra.”

When she heard that it wasn’t some Gu bug skill, Yan Xuehen sighed in relief. Otherwise, the thought of having some kind of bug squirming inside her would have made her shiver all over. However, when she heard that it was from the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, she was stunned. A skill from that legendary technique definitely wouldn’t be simple.

“How long are the effects going to continue?” Yan Xuehen asked. She was incredibly embarrassed about how she kept thinking about him day and night. No wonder she had still ended up liking this man, even though she cultivated the Unshakable Daoist Manual!

She felt a chill when she noticed that Zu An hadn’t replied. She asked, “There’s no way that this skill would last forever, is there?”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

There was no avoiding pain regardless, so Zu An decided to just tell the truth. He said, “I don’t know.”

“How can you not know?!” Yan Xuehen cried furiously. “Did you use the same skill on Chu Chuyan and Yu Yanluo?!”

It was no wonder that even though that girl Chuyan was normally arrogant and aloof, she was still dead set on him. Yu Yanluo was known as the world’s greatest beauty, someone who had rejected so many pursuers, and yet she had fallen under his hands. It was probably all because of Zu An’s despicable methods. When she looked at him, her expression was full of disappointment and disdain.

Little White and Little Blue were confused. What were the two of them talking about? They had even brought up the clan leader.

Zu An said with a serious expression, “I never used this skill before that time; those two and I are each other’s sunshine. I wouldn’t need to rely on such a thing to reach my objective. The only time I used it was on you, and it was because I’d already used up everything else.”

He was starting to get annoyed at this point. He protested, “Do you have no idea how strong you are? Since you were bullying the weak in your position, what else was I supposed to do?!”

Yan Xuehen opened her mouth, but she didn’t know how to retort against that. For some reason, she didn’t feel that angry when she heard that the only time he had used that skill was on her. She even felt a bit happy.

Damn it, it’s definitely because of that blasted skill!

She quickly calmed down and deliberately put on a serious expression, saying, “Tell me the exact details of the skill. I’ll see if there’s some way to break it.”

Zu An obviously didn’t want to take advantage of her through the skill. He described the Gold Phoenix’s details to her.

“Gold Phoenix, love is more solid than gold…” Yan Xuehen blushed. Why did the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra have such indecent effects?!

Since Zu An and Yan Xuehen were the only ones who knew what was going on, Little White and Little Blue were completely confused. They didn’t understand what the two were saying at all.

“It seems to be some kind of contract. If it’s a contract, how can it ignore the disparity between the two sides and come into effect on its own? Or perhaps it’s something else…” Yan Xuehen began to think to herself. As a grandmaster, she was knowledgeable and experienced. She began to analyze the various possibilities.

Zu An was in admiration as he listened. As expected of the leader of the human race’s righteous faction!

However, Yan Xuehen couldn't figure anything out even after a while. She got more and more annoyed. Eventually, she said, “This is something only the two of us can know about. Don’t let anyone else know, especially Chuyan, do you understand?”
