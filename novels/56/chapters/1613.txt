Chapter 1562 – Battle Within the Harem

Zu An felt as if his entire body were soaked in sweat. He asked, “Why would you think something like that?”

It was one thing if it involved other women, but Yan Xuehen was Chu Chuyan’s master! If Chuyan learned the truth now, there really could be chaos. The only thing he could do was to gradually make the two of them accept such a relationship…

As soon as that thought appeared in his mind, Zu An couldn't help but laugh to himself bitterly. To be honest, he didn’t have any hope in that regard at all.

“It’s because the two of you are both just way too good to me,” Chu Chuyan said with a confused expression. “My master especially. She always used to be ice-cold and really strict with me. I was even a bit scared of her. But when she came back this time, she was suddenly much warmer, and she also looked at me with a lot of care.”

Zu An was speechless. Big sis Yan, you really aren’t trying your best here! Weren’t you known for cultivating some kind of emotionless state?

Fortunately, he reacted quickly and said, “We’re the people closest to you, so what’s so strange about being good to you? Wouldn’t it be stranger if we treated you badly?”

“But my master’s transformation is just too…” Chu Chuyan muttered skeptically.

Zu An explained, “It’s probably because she met too many powerful beings in the Unknown Region. We almost died many times. That experience definitely left her with a huge impression, so that’s probably why her mental state has changed a bit.”

Chu Chuyan nodded slightly, replying, “I think that’s the case too. I could clearly feel that my master’s strength has increased a bit. Furthermore, she quickly entered seclusion. According to what the others at the sect are saying, she should be able to reach a new level in her cultivation this time.”

Zu An sighed in relief when he saw that Chu Chuyan was convinced.

…

Just like that, the two of them wandered around the capital. The capital was the most bustling city in the world; apart from a few areas, most city districts didn’t have a night curfew. That was partly why people from other places all had a yearning for the capital. The two ate while strolling through the streets; Zu An felt as if he had returned to the night markets of his previous world.

Chu Chuyan had always been raised carefully and not allowed to indulge in many different things. Furthermore, she had always carried the entire Chu clan’s safety on her back. She had never felt so relaxed before. Her ice-cold expression was gradually replaced with laughter and smiles. As she hugged Zu An’s arm, a blissful glow radiated from her face.

No men with impure motives hit on her along the way. The first reason was that the capital was different from other places, with much better public security. After what had happened today in particular, there were patrolling guards everywhere. The second reason was that by now, almost any sensible person recognized Zu An. They knew he was a rising star. Who would stick their head out and willingly get in trouble?

As such, the two of them were able to stroll around until late into the night before they returned home reluctantly, still wishing for more.

When they returned to the manor, the two of them sat side by side on a windowsill. Chu Chuyan leaned against Zu An’s chest, and they both just admired the moon in the sky. They shared everything that had been on their minds while they were separated, including their thoughts about each other.

There were endless things to talk about between lovers. Soon, it was already late at night. The two of them both unwittingly fell asleep by the windowsill, leaning against each other side by side.

…

This continued until the next morning, when the servants were shocked to find the two of them sleeping like that. Thankfully, the two of them had high cultivations; otherwise, sleeping like that in the middle of winter would have easily made them extremely sick.

A clear and melodious bell rang through the air, notifying all the palace officials to report to the morning court session.

Zu An wasn’t surprised at all. After what had happened the previous day, it would be strange if there were no morning court session today. With his current identity, he needed to attend the morning court session too. Thus, he let Chuyan sleep for a while longer, because it was still too early.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Chu Chuyan nodded slightly. After cleaning up a bit, she returned to the room to cultivate in meditation. Zu An was full of admiration. People all said that Chu Chuyan had exceptional talent, but her level of diligence in cultivation was far above most cultivators of the world.

“I’ll try to come back as soon as the court session is over. I’ll take you around the Royal Academy,” Zu An said.

The previous night, during their conversation, he had learned that Chu Chuyan was given some tasks to complete by her teacher and had to pay the libationer a visit, while bringing over some gifts. He realized he still hadn’t met his friends at the academy after returning to the capital.

“I’ll wait for you,” Chu Chuyan said, sounding gentler than her usual ice-cold nature.

…

When Zu An arrived at the Imperial Palace, sure enough, many officials recommended vigorously investigating the attack that had happened the previous night. Others said to investigate what had happened at Cloudcenter Commandery because Sang Hong had brought back new proof. Of course, the attack on Sang Hong’s Imperial Envoy fleet also had to be investigated.

Even though no one said King Qi’s name, they all knew that the target was King Qi. He was in the wrong to begin with, so even if King Qi’s faction wanted to retort, now wasn’t the time at all.

A while later, other officials suddenly pointed out each dynasty and generation’s rules. Kings had to return to their fiefdoms after they matured, and there was no reason for them to remain at the capital. At the same time, they mentioned how only a few kings in history had remained in the capital, and how that hadn’t been a blessing for the world. In the end, they suggested for King Qi to return to his fiefdom.

The entire court instantly broke out into a commotion. Every single person present knew what King Qi had been fighting for all these years. If he returned to his fiefdom, wasn’t that the same as demanding his life?

Some of the middle and lower-class officials from King Qi’s faction who weren’t privy to insider details protested, but after arguing for a while, they suddenly realized something. Why weren’t the heavy hitters of their faction saying a thing?

Every person who had the right to be in the court was smart. They had only come to their misunderstanding due to a lack of information. When they saw how the other members of their faction were acting and associated it with what had happened the previous day, all of them woke up to the truth.

The morale of King Qi’s faction instantly plummeted. Thus, they were pushed back bit by bit. Eventually, the matter was practically set in stone.

Zu An didn’t find it too surprising, because he realized that King Qi seemed to be too calm. He didn’t see King Qi’s forces back at all from start to finish. Could it be that King Qi had really just acknowledged his fate here?

Of course, Zhao Han’s strategy was excellent. Not a single one of those disgraceful things had been pointed at King Qi. It seemed almost like a silent offer: ‘I won’t pursue this matter, so you should obediently crawl back to your fiefdom.’

…

When the court session ended, Zu An reported to the Eastern Palace’s morning roll call as usual. He found a chance to ask Bi Linglong, “Is King Qi really just going to accept his fate and return to the fiefdom?”

“How can it be that easy?” Bi Linglong replied. She looked beautiful today, because she had put special care into her makeup. “But the current situation isn’t in his favor, so he is lying low for now. I believe that he will start his counterattack soon.”

Zu An asked her about what King Qi’s counterattack could potentially look like. Bi Linglong shook her head and replied, “King Qi is someone with deep plans and distant thoughts; how can they be things that a junior like me can presumptuously try to guess at? Does Sir Zu have anything else to report? If not, then you can withdraw.”

Zu An was surprised by her cold tone. He wondered if she had eaten something wrong this morning. What happened with the empress doesn’t seem to have been exposed, though? He could only continue, “There have been some important events at home recently, so I want to ask for a few days of vacation…”

“No.” Bi Linglong cut him off before he could finish.

Zu An was a bit annoyed now. He suddenly got up and asked, “Why?”

Bi Linglong looked up at him. There was no emotion visible on her face as she replied, “The Eastern Palace has too many things to take care of, and you are the crown Pprince’s chamberlain. You were out for a long time and were away from the Eastern Palace. Too many documents have already accumulated here. You’ve finally returned, and yet you want to ask for a vacation?”

“I really am a bit busy these days. I promise I’ll work overtime to deal with it all,” Zu An replied, feeling puzzled. Even though his position as crown prince’s chamberlain had a high status, the work was almost all taken care of by the people under him. The one who made the decisions was the crown princess. When did they ever need him to deal with documents?

“What can you even be busy with? Isn’t it just keeping that Chu clan woman company?” Bi Linglong retorted coldly. “From what I know, the two of you have already been divorced. She is no longer your spouse, so why do you have to stay with her?”

Zu An suddenly realized what was happening. He couldn't help but look at her with a smile, saying, “So you were jealous.”

“You rascal, I am the crown princess; why would I be… jealous of you?” Bi Linglong replied, her expression stiffening. “Servants, bring all of the documents that have accumulated in this time to Sir Zu.”

She got up to leave afterward, not even giving him a chance to retort. Soon after, Rong Mo quickly delivered a huge pile of documents to Zu An. She had a huge smile on her face as she enjoyed his misery.

Zu An was also stunned. With the amount there was, forget about a single day, he wouldn’t even be able to finish it all if he worked three days and three nights in a row!

Chuyan is still waiting for me at home…
