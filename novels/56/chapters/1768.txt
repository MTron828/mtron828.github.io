Chapter 1717: Ambush

The area halfway up the mountain was engulfed in chaos, but Golden Peak was even more so.

Zhuxie Chixin and the others didn’t have time to focus on their own injuries and sprinted toward the spot at the center of the stage, calling out, “Your majesty! Your majesty!”

Wang Wuxie’s expression also changed, and he followed them over too.

Smoke and waves of heat filled the air in all directions. Those present felt their hair and beards being instantly scorched. If not for the ki armor protecting them, they could already have been burned to death from the extreme temperature.

The Embroidered Envoys and guards who were fortunate enough to survive all rushed over to save the emperor. Unfortunately, they were blown back several times by the heat.

When Wang Wuxie saw that, he waved his sleeves. A wave of powerful ki immediately scattered the smoke. The others were left in admiration when they saw that, thinking, As expected of the State Teacher. His level of cultivation really was admirable.

The smoke gradually scattered, leaving them surprised to discover that the altar had already disappeared, having been replaced by a deep crater. It was easy to imagine just how great the power of the explosives was. Their expressions darkened. If even the altar had ended up like this, everything boded ill for his majesty…

Wang Wuxie continued to wave his sleeves. The smoke became fainter and fainter, revealing what was within. Those present noticed a golden sphere of light inside, with a figure in its center.

“Your majesty!” Zhuxie Chixin and Eunuch Wen exclaimed, overjoyed. Who else could it be but Zhao Han?

He walked out with an ashen expression and called out, “What is going on here?”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The crown he wore had already fallen off, and his hair was disheveled. There were scorched black marks and signs of damage on his dragon robes. It was clear that the terrifying explosion had affected him. In all these years, when had he ever been left in such a sorry state? He was absolutely furious. At that moment, the only thought in his mind was that he wanted to kill.

Zhuxie Chixin and Eunuch Wen exchanged a look. Who knew how many heads would to tumble because of this…

That guy Zu An and the Armed Escort Army had been sent out ahead of time to clear out any potential dangers; what the hell were they doing? Could it be that he really had colluded with the Fiend races and wanted to get rid of his majesty together with them?

Wang Wuxie kneeled straight down and said while trembling, “Your majesty, please forgive me. It was because this poor daoist was incompetent that there were traitors among my sect’s leadership. That was why so much gunpowder was delivered to Golden Peak.”

When they saw the usually arrogant State Teacher shaking, Eunuch Wen and Zhuxie Chixin could understand how he was feeling. After all, now that something so huge had happened, there was no way his Righteous Sun Sect could get away scot-free.

However, they didn’t suspect Wang Wuxie. After all, he was the State Teacher, someone who was already incredibly respected. Furthermore, he had stood at the emperor’s side when he was at his lowest point. The emperor even viewed him as a friend. How could someone like that possibly betray the emperor?

Zhao Han didn’t suspect him and quickly supported him, saying, “Wuxie, there is no need for you to be like this. This isn’t your fault.”

He would only falsely pretend to support them if it were anyone else, but he really did treat Wang Wuxie differently. He personally supported the man to express how much he cared.

Suddenly, something unexpected happened. A strange expression flashed through Wang Wuxie’s eyes. Then, while the emperor was supporting him, his hands suddenly slammed into the emperor’s chest.

As the number one of the daoist sects, how powerful was his cultivation? As he displayed the powerful skills he had cultivated for so many years, violet ki appeared in his hands. He was so fast that Zhao Han, who was right next to him, couldn't react. He was struck firmly by those palms.

However, he reacted quickly as well. His entire body erupted with golden light that instantly devoured the violet ki. Then, his palm hacked straight through Wang Wuxie’s defenses and struck his body.

Wang Wuxie’s daoist robes exploded fiercely, and his chest caved in by a few inches. His body slammed heavily into the ground like a broken sack. He vomited a mouthful of blood that carried fragments of dark red innards. It was clear that he wouldn’t survive.

Zhuxie Chixin and Eunuch Wen were alarmed. They instinctively rushed at Wang Wuxie to attack. When he saw that the man was about to be ripped apart, however, Zhao Han called out, “Stop!”

A hint of unnatural redness had appeared on his face. It was clear that Wang Wuxie’s attack had dealt him considerable damage. However, his gaze was as sharp as lightning as he stared at Wang Wuxie and asked, “Why?”

That was what he couldn't figure out. Between their friendship and his current standing in the Righteous Sun Sect, there was no reason for Wang Wuxie to betray him.

Wang Wuxie’s strange expression faded. Perhaps because of a last dying flash, the murkiness in his eyes also scattered. He recovered a bit of clarity, gasping in a tone full of anger and helplessness, “Shamans!”

“The shamans’ possession arts?” Zhao Han muttered with a frown.

He had only instinctively retaliated against Wang Wuxie’s move just then. However, just how powerful would such a reaction be? Only someone with cultivation as profound as Wang Wuxie could barely keep his body intact. He was already at his deathbed and couldn't hear what Zhao Han was saying at all.

Wang Wuxie felt endless frustration and regret. His aptitude was outstanding, and his cultivation had been growing by the day. He had even seen the door to the earth immortal stage recently, and yet who could have thought that he would be plotted against in the name of love and fall in such a wretched manner?

“Xuehen, you’ve come…” he murmured as he raised his hand to a certain place in the sky, seemingly struggling to grasp something.

He seemed to have seen a goddess who resided in the clouds, walking toward him with a look of pity and tenderness. She even reached out her hand, as if to save him.

And yet, no matter how he reached out his hand, in the end, their hands never touched. In the end, he departed this life with deep regrets.

“Your majesty, how do you feel right now?” Eunuch Wen and Zhuxie Chixin asked with concern, surrounding Zhao Han.

However, Zhao Han suddenly looked up, his gaze resembling that of a ferocious tiger ready to devour everything. Both of them were so frightened their entire bodies quivered. They didn’t dare to take even half a step closer. Both of them realized that after Wang Wuxie’s betrayal, Zhao Han no longer trusted anyone, not even them.

Suddenly, there was a ripple in the distance and runes appeared. There were clearly people being transported into the area.

The Embroidered Envoys and Imperial Guards all drew their weapons to surround the emperor. The arrival of trespassers at this point in time was definitely bad news.

“Haha, as expected of your majesty! You actually managed to kill the number one of the daoist sects despite his ambush, and you even look perfectly fine,” a good-looking middle-aged man with a neatly trimmed beard said as he strutted out. The guards tried to stop him, but they were all blown back with just a wave of his hand, sustaining serious injuries.

Zhuxie Chixin’s eyes narrowed. This aura was clearly that of a grandmaster! Furthermore, it didn’t seem as if the other man had just entered that level either; rather, he was an experienced veteran.

Zhao Han frowned, clearly recognizing him. He called out, “Guan Chouhai?”

“I didn’t expect your majesty to still remember me,” Guan Chouhai said with a sign. “I didn’t expect to make your majesty my enemy today either.”

“Even someone like you?” Zhao Han remarked, laughing in contempt. “You’re not qualified.”
