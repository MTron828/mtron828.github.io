Chapter 666: Exposed

Translator: Pika

The jailers were all bunched up together. When Zu An saw how high up these fellas’ trousers were bulging, he wondered if their butts will hurt once they get up.

He suddenly noticed something. One of these guys’ trousers were ordinary. He felt great sympathy. If not even one of the world’s most powerful aphrodisiacs worked on you, then what was the point in living anymore?

After completing these tasks, Zu An quickly arrived at the golden armored guards’ corpses side and stripped off their armor and clothes. Then, he stored their corpses into the Brilliant Glass Bead.

The reason why he didn’t use any weapons was because he was worried that the blood might stain these clothes. Things might get annoying later on once the investigations began.

After completing all of this, he opened up the prison cells and woke up the Devil Sect’s people.

“What happened just now?” Gu Yueyi looked around in confusion.

Sun Luzhen and Solitary Fire were more collected. They could both sense that it was a spiritual attack.

Zu An didn’t explain anything and said, “I knocked them out. Hurry and change into these clothes. I’ll bring you out of the palace.”

The Devil Sect’s people snapped out of their daze. All of them were excited when they discovered that there was hope in living again. All of them rushed over to change into these clothes.

Even though there were many people who were captured, many of them were wounded from the day of the attack. Then, after strict torture, more and more died in succession. Now, including Sun Luzhen, there were only seven left.

There were eight golden armor guards who entered, so it was perfect.

Zu An quickly helped them undo the Embroidered Envoy’s restrictions. They were already incredibly weak from the torture. It would take a long time for them to recover their original strength.

When he saw that some of them were having trouble even walking, Zu An sighed. He took out some of the medicine he got from Divine Physician Ji before.

Warm streams filled their bodies when they took the pill, allowing them to recover quite a bit of strength. Even the weakest one among them could walk again.

Sun Luzhen was the first to cup his hands towards Zu An. “Sir Zu, you have shown us great favor this time. We will engrave this gratitude forever. Even if there are mountains of daggers and seas of flames, as long as Sir Zu requests it of us, we will not show any hesitation.”

Zu An replied with a smile. “There’s no need to speak so seriously. We still haven’t gotten out of danger yet, so let’s not lower our guard.”

He didn’t take these people’s words to heart. They might be sincere when they were saying these things now, but people will always change. There was probably no one in this world willing to go through mountains of daggers and seas of flames.

He was doing this to gain Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei’s favor anyway. These fellas’ gratitude was just a bonus.

They all snapped back to reality and voiced their agreement. They were still in the palace, so it was still too early to feel happiness.

After they changed into the armor, Gu Yueyi raised a blade to end those jailers’ lives. They had been tormented by these fellas day and night. Now that the situation had turned around, how could he just let them live and swallow this down?

Zu An quickly stopped him. “Brother Gu, I still have a use for these people here.”

Gu Yueyi said reluctantly, “But many of our brothers died under these people’s interrogations!”

Zu An said with a serious voice, “The top priority is to rescue all of you right now. I need them to deal with the aftermath.”

Sun Luzhen frowned and said, “Yueyi, do not bring young master Zu trouble.”

He was an elder with great status in the sect. Gu Yueyi could only resentfully put away his weapon.

Zu An sighed in relief. He beckoned towards them and led them out.

They didn’t bump into anyone along the way because he already called all of them down beforehand.

All of them were moved when they left the imperial prison and saw sunlight once more. They thought that they were dead for certain, yet they were actually able to see the light of day again.

All of this was thanks to young master Zu!

They looked at Zu An with gratitude. Even Gu Yueyi’s positive feelings surpassed the negativity of when they were at odds before.

“I’ll bring you guys out of the palace gates. You all have King Qi’s waist tokens. Together with this set of armor, it shouldn’t be too hard to leave.” Zu An said with a lowered voice.

“Thank you, young master Zu.” All of them cupped their hands.

However, not long after they left, there was a soft voice that suddenly sounded. “Wait!”

Zu An’s entire body went rigid when he heard this voice. He felt as if he sunk straight into a frozen sea.

How was he this unlucky? He actually ran into King Qi here!

He noticed that Sun Luzhen and the others silently moved their hands to their sword hilts. He quickly sent them voice transmissions. “Don’t act rashly. The one who came is King Qi. He has grandmaster level cultivation.”

He didn’t need to continue. When they heard his identity, all of them gave up their plans of taking down this person.

They were well-aware of King Qi’s reputation. This was a man with grandmaster level cultivation! Forget about all of them being seriously injured right now, even if they were at their very best, they still wouldn’t be able to put even a scratch on him!

“Where are you all going?” King Qi asked with a frown.

He noticed that the emperor’s will descended here. He wondered what kind of thing happened here that drew his attention, so he decided to come for a look.

He just happened to run into Zu An’s group.

Zu An’s thoughts moved quickly. He immediately produced many methods to deal with the other party. In the end, he said, “Didn’t King Qi ask me to come meet with you?”

He thanked the heavens that he didn’t make these people wear the uniform of the guard with the big nostrils. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to bluff his way through.

King Qi shouldn't have recognized the normal guards, right?

There wasn’t anything else he could do, he could only make a gamble here.

If there really was no choice, then he would just call over the emperor. Screw it all, if his plan to have him infiltrate the Devil Sect failed, he couldn’t just throw his life away here.

King Qi replied with an ‘oh’. “Indeed, I was looking for you about something. The rest of you can withdraw for now.”

The first half was for Zu An, the latter half was for the guards.

Zu An sighed in relief. Thank goodness the other party didn’t recognize them, or else the consequences would be horrifying.

He gave Sun Luzhen and the others a look, indicating for them to leave first. Now that King Qi was so close, he didn’t even dare send a voice transmission out of fear that he might notice something was off.

Either way, he already told them everything they needed to know. As for leaving the palace, they even managed to infiltrate the palace that day, so it shouldn’t be an issue, right?

Sun Luzhen’s group didn’t even dare to raise their heads. They cupped their hands and turned around to leave.

“Wait!” King Qi suddenly frowned. “Why don’t I see Liu Chenyu?”

Sun Luzhen and the others’ hearts began to pound. They didn’t even know who Liu Chenyu was, so what were they supposed to say?

Zu An received this person’s Rage points before, so he knew that it was the big nostril leader. His mind moved quickly and he said, “Leader Liu was summoned by the emperor just now.”

“Summoned by brother emperor?” King Qi’s expression changed. Could it be that the reason the emperor’s will descended was because of Liu Chenyu?

But that doesn’t seem right. Would he be able to draw the emperor’s divine will?

He looked at Sun Luzhen’s group. “Hm? Why don’t I see leader Wang either? All of you, raise your heads.”

All of them felt chills run through their bodies when they heard this.

Zu An was panicking. He didn’t know how to explain himself now either.Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com
