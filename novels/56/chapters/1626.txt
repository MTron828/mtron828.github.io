Chapter 1575: Entrust

“I want…” Kong Nanwu couldn’t help but chuckle when she saw Zu An’s vigilant appearance. “I want a new story like ‘Strange Tales’. Even though ‘A Chinese Ghost Story’ is good, I’m already so familiar with it that it doesn’t give me that new and fresh feeling anymore.”

“That’s it?” Zu An asked, feeling a bit stunned. He had thought that she would ask him something that was extremely difficult. He hadn’t expected it to actually be something so easy.

When she saw him relax, Kong Nanwu couldn't help but say, “Young master, this isn’t a simple matter at all. After all, a story like Strange Tales is something an ordinary person won’t be able to come up with even if they spend their entire lives on it. Please don’t bring out any random story to try and appease me half-heartedly.”

Nan Xun covered her smile with her hand as she said, “As young master was able to write ‘A Chinese Ghost Story’, how could he be someone ordinary? I’m sure that was just something he wrote casually.”

When he saw the two women look at him with eyes full of expectation, Zu An wiped at his cold sweat. If not for the wisdom of his predecessors, how could he possibly come up with a brilliant story? He thought for a bit, then said, “Then I’ll tell you about the story of ‘Painted Skin’. A long time ago…”

He didn’t tell the story exactly the way it had been in Strange Tales, but rather added some plot from the movies Painted Skin 1 and 2. After all, these were young ladies, so they were fairly interested in romance.

Sure enough, when they heard the story, Nan Xun and the little fox both sobbed tearfully. Kong Nanwu was more composed than the other two, but her eyes were also red; clearly, she had been deeply affected.

“That female ghost is just too pitiful. She paid such a huge price for love, and yet she was the one who had to bear all of the tragedy in the end, not obtaining a thing out of it all,” Nan Xun said, wiping away her tears. To a certain degree, she was also a female ghost, so she sympathized even more with the lead role.

Kong Nanwu frowned and said, “I feel as if that female ghost was a bit… green tea. Is that how you use that term?” She asked Zu An for confirmation. Green tea was slang she had picked up from him, after all. When he gave her his approval, she then continued, “She knew he was a husband with a wife, and yet she still insisted on going along with it. She even used all kinds of tricks to insert herself between them.”

As the Peacock King Race’s princess, her status was noble. If she ever got married, she would become the main wife. For example, she had almost become the Crown Princess. That was why she naturally felt a kind of vigilance against such mistresses.

Nan Xun replied unhappily,“Why are you making it sound so bad? She was only doing it out of love too.”

The little fox replied in her small voice, “I think that man was really bad. He already had a wife, and yet he still had that kind of relationship with another woman!”

When they heard her words, the women in the room couldn't help but look at Zu An, giving him a huge headache. He asked, “What are you all staring at me for?”

“That male lead actually wasn’t that bad; he didn’t really do anything. Even later on, when he thought his wife was a monster, he didn’t leave her. It was to the extent that in order to prove that he wasn’t someone who only judged based on appearances, he even cut his own eyes out and became blind…” Kong Nanwu trailed off, looking at Zu An with a strange expression. There was a trace of a smile hanging from the corners of her lips as she continued, “Could it be that the young master felt that the male lead was too fickle, so you subconsciously painted him in a better light?”

Zu An grumbled, “It’s not as if that guy in the story was modeled after me…”

He continued to try to explain himself for a long time. In the end, even though the three women said they believed him, they still had a ‘we understand’ look on their faces, making him feel a deep sense of powerlessness.

Soon afterward, Kong Nanwu asked Zu An about the events on Violet Mountain. Someone as well-informed as her had naturally learned about his court mission. She said, “Young master, this Violet Mountain trip might be full of dangers. I’ve received information stating that many evildoers are heading in that direction with unknown intentions.”

Zu An was stunned, asking, “Where did you obtain that information from?”

For better or for worse, he was the Regent of the Fiend races. His status was supposed to be higher than hers, right? Despite that, he hadn’t even received any information yet, so why did she know about that?

“I’ve been on the human side for some time now, so I still have some things I’ve gained,” Kong Nanwu replied. She downplayed the situation, but she couldn't hide her proud smile.

Zu An couldn't really push her about the details either. He said, “Thank you for your reminder, Lady Kong.”

At the same time, he felt a bit strange. Just what is going on? Why are even those fellas from the world of warriors getting involved with Violet Mountain?

After all, the empire had already pretty much roped in most of the elites. Even though the world of warriors still had some powerful individuals, they were completely insignificant compared to the massive court. They couldn't even get away if the court went after them.

Kong Nanwu picked up the wine pot off to the side and poured out two cups. She brought one of them up to Zu An, her fair wrist being exposed within her sleeves and reflecting on the jade cup’s surface. She said, “Cheers! I wish the young master a safe journey.”

“Thank you!” Zu An replied as he received the cup and drained it in one go. At the same time, he felt a bit regretful. Weren’t peacocks green? Why was she so white?

…

After arranging various affairs in the capital, Zu An brought a group consisting of the Armed Escort Army and several craftsmen to Violet Mountain.

Zhao Han clearly cared a great deal about the ceremony. The number of men he had sent out this time exceeded the previous Imperial Envoy fleet. It wasn’t just more people, either; there were even two Armed Escort Army generals accompanying them.

One man with a dark-reddish complexion was named Wang Bolin. He always had a miserable look on his face, as if everyone else owed him money or something.

The slightly younger one was named Zhang Zijiang. He always had a smile on his face no matter who he was talking to. However, a glint occasionally flickered through his eyes, showing that he wasn’t as kind as he looked on the surface.

Even though the two of them had different tendencies, Zu An could sense hostility from both of them.

Still, that couldn't be blamed on them. The two of them were quite capable figures in the Armed Escort Division and had even worked as deputy generals for many years. Whether in terms of their ability or prestige, they had already received people’s acknowledgment.

These two normally butted heads with each other, because both of them wanted to stand out and become the new Armed Escort Division General. And yet, after fighting for so many years, that vacant space had been given to a guy named Zu An.

If he had come from an influential clan and had a great reputation, that would be one thing. However, he was so young, even younger than many of the new recruits from the Armed Escort Division! On top of all of that, he had been born to a poor background! There were rumors that he used to be a drafted son-in-law, at that!

As such, even though Zu An had displayed outstanding achievements in the past two years, they still didn’t feel good about it. With such a ‘common enemy’, the two rivals actually felt a sense of unity for the first time. 

In the end, Zu An had Bi Linglong to thank. When she learned that these two deputy generals were heading out to Violet Mountain, she had made sure to warn him. Otherwise, how would Zu An have been able to so clearly deduce what they were thinking?

“Even though Linglong has been throwing a fit recently, she still really cares about me, it seems,” Zu An muttered to himself. When he thought about how Bi Linglong was upset, but wasn’t willing to admit it with that proud expression she had, he couldn't help but grin.

“Brother Zu is thinking about another woman again. Look at that lewd smile on your face,” someone said, patting him on the shoulder. Someone wearing a silver mask appeared in front of him. Even though the person was masked, he had eyes that were even brighter than peach blossoms. Who else could it be but Xie Xiu?

When he saw Xie Xiu, who was more beautiful than many women, Zu An inadvertently thought, Is this kid not scared that he might be kidnapped by a dude and r*ped one day?

“Xiu’er! So you had some free time and decided to visit me? Did those female fans of yours come too?” Zu An replied. He still remembered all the women who had followed Xie Xiu during his last trip to the Royal Academy.

Xie Xiu shivered. He looked around and quietly asked, “Can you lower your voice? I actually snuck out this time.”

“You came all the way to see me off even in this kind of situation? You’re a loyal brother,” Zu An said while looking around. He was surprised to find that he couldn’t see a certain graceful figure anywhere.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Stop looking already. My big sis isn’t here,” Xie Xiu said, rolling his eyes.

Zu An chuckled in embarrassment, asking, “Is your big sister busy with cultivation recently?”

Xie Xiu shook his head and said, “Apart from coming out here to see you off, there was something else I have to entrust you with, which is the mission my big sis accepted. It seems she had to go to Violet Mountain too, and she already left a few days ago…”

He gave a rough explanation of what happened. However, because the trip had been conducted in secret, he didn’t have too many details either. “Even though my big sis’ cultivation isn’t bad, she doesn’t have much experience with the world of warriors. Even though she isn’t completely inexperienced, everyone who came and went from Brightmoon City had some status. They all knew she was the precious daughter of a city lord, so they wouldn’t really try anything. After she came to the capital, she spent all her time studying in the rear mountain, hardly ever engaging in conversations with random people. But this time, she left on a journey all alone…”

“You’re worried that something might happen to her out there?” Zu An replied with a chuckle. “I didn’t expect you to be a bit of a sis-con.”

“What’s a sis-con?” Xie Xiu replied, confused. He shook his head and continued, “Your journeys this time are similar, which is why I wanted to ask you to take care of her. I wanted to go with you too, but that old bastard Hei Baizi seems to have gone crazy or something, giving me a load of tasks to do. I don’t have any time to leave the capital. If something happened to my big sis, how would I explain things to my folks?”

Zu An had a strange expression. Is this really an obedient and filial handsome chap…

“Don’t worry. Your big sis is my good friend too. Of course I’ll watch out for her,” he said, patting his chest reassuringly. He thought to himself, The two of us really do share some affinity with each other. Xie Daoyun was actually sent out to Violet Mountain too.

“It’s enough as long as she’s safe; you don’t have to take care of her too well,” Xie Xiu said vigilantly. “Otherwise, if you took care of her all the way to bed, that would be bad.”

Zu An glowered. He retorted, “Do I look like that kind of person to you?”

Xie Xiu gave him a careful look, then nodded seriously and replied, “You do!”
