Chapter 807, Part 2: Destined to Fail

Translator: Pika

However, the young masters didn’t feel dissatisfied at all, but rather felt that this was how it should be. After all, the Royal Academy had never built relationships with any influential clans and only cared about talent. The direct disciples of the libationer in the rear mountain, in particular, were aloof and arrogant. Forget about juniors like them, these teachers might even treat their fathers coldly if they were here in their place.

The group of teachers led by Shen Xuzi arrived in front of the crown prince and princess. They cupped their hands and exchanged some greetings. Then, their attention shifted to Zu An. Their cold expressions immediately changed and were instead replaced with eager attentiveness.

“Sir Zu, why didn’t you tell us that you arrived at the academy? I’m already carrying out experiments on the steam engine you speak of, and I feel like I’m on the verge of an incredible breakthrough!”

“Old fourth, stop trying to hog him to yourself, move out of the way… Sir Zu, I already have some insights regarding the male infertility problem I was stumped on; perhaps I’ll have already found the solution once you guys come out of the dungeon. I’ll need your guidance on the follow-up work afterwards.”

“Tsk, all of you, get out of the way. Sir Zu already promised me that he would play chess with me first once he gets out.”

“What’s the point of playing chess? It’s more fun to have an intellectual conversation. Only then can we discern the truth of the universe.”

…

The teachers began to argue among themselves. Zu An used this chance to walk over to Jiang Luofu’s side, asking, “Big sis, why did you come here? I’m worried that this might affect your clan’s relationship with King Qi.”

Jiang Luofu smiled and replied, “I was a bit worried, but it doesn’t matter if I come together with the others.”

“That makes sense.” Zu An laughed.

“Eighth sister, you have to be careful! This guy is a playboy through and through, you can’t let him trick you! What if he leaves behind his seed, but then leaves in secret or something?” Qi Yaoguang suddenly came up with such a thought somehow.

Jiang Luofu’s forehead darkened. “Don’t try to sound smart if you have no idea what you’re talking about. Just take care of yourself! You’re the one who’s in a daze all the time; you’re the one who might get tricked by him without even realizing what happened.”

“Ah! You’re telling me dirty things when I’m still little! I’m going to tell on you to master,” Qi Yaoguang replied, leaving Jiang Luofu speechless.

The Gu clan brothers and the other noble children were stunned. What the hell was going on right now? Why did these proud and noble figures suddenly seem to have become completely different? They weren’t just friendly with Zu An; it seemed they were… flattering him?

Bi Linglong couldn't help but smile when she saw all of them in a daze. For some reason, she felt even more refreshed from seeing that than venting and criticizing them herself. Hmph, they’re all just a group of opinionated fools.

…

In the distance, in King Qi’s camp, Chu Youzhao saw Jiang Luofu and Qi Yaoguang stand around Zu An. Her eyes couldn't help but be drawn to those long, black stocking-covered legs.

Murong Qinghe sighed in admiration. “Ms. Jiang’s legs are long and beautiful. Even a girl like me can’t help but adore them.”

“Hmph, she’s just a vixen. My big sister’s legs are also beautiful; it’s just that she doesn’t expose them like this,” Chu Youzhao harrumphed.

Murong Qinghe’s expression became a bit strange. There was actually a man who didn’t like Jiang Luofu’s long legs? But she didn’t think too much about it either. She just thought of it as him defending his sister.

Chu Youzhao said, “Let’s go; follow me there.” Murong Qinghe didn’t know why he would say that, but she still followed him over.

Before Chu Youzhao even got close to Zu An, she shouted loudly, “Brother-in-law, you’re finally here!”

Zu An turned around. When he saw that it was her, he couldn't help but smile. “So it was Youzhao.”

Chu Youzhao walked over, unwittingly arriving next to Jiang Luofu and Qi Yaoguang. Then, she took out a bag, bringing out many things from it and shoving them toward Zu An. “Brother-in-law, these are some things I got for you. I hope they can help you in the dungeon. These are some cakes; you might not be able to find food in the dungeon. These are bug repellents so you don’t get bothered by mosquitoes, this is fever medicine for if you get a fever, and these are healing medicines for both internal and external wounds. You’ll definitely have to fight a lot inside, so it’s better to have some medicine just in case. These are poison resistance medicines that can prevent you from being afflicted by poisonous bugs and plants…”

“Thank you, Youzhao.” Zu An became a bit dizzy when he saw all the things she fished out. Ji Xiaoxi had also given him this and that when he was back in Brightmoon Academy, and they really had saved his life in the end.

“Don’t treat me like an outsider, brother-in-law! Big sis told me to take good care of you before she left, remember?” Chu Youzhao replied, shooting Jiang Luofu and Qi Yaoguang a pointed look. She had to protect her brother-in-law, or else he might be bullied by these vixens.

The King Qi faction’s people began to whisper among themselves when they saw the situation.

Murong Tong walked over to Qin Zheng’s side and said with a chuckle, “Daughters really are only good for squandering wealth, and the granddaughters your daughters gave birth to aren’t loyal at all either. Chu Chuyan has already divorced Zu An, yet Youzhao still calls him brother-in-law so enthusiastically and gives him so many things. Doesn’t this mean that Chuyan’s relationship with him is still excellent?”

Qin Zheng’s face darkened. “Youzhao really is outrageous. Even his big sister’s reputation is going to be done in by him.”

Murong Tong was all smiles. Nothing had been going well for him these days, but seeing his old friend’s daughters being all friendly with the other faction allowed him to finally find a sliver of joy.

Just then, Murong Qinghe also handed Zu An a bag. “Big brother Zu, I don’t have much here, so I’ll give you this storage sack. It can hold many things, and you can carry everything big brother Chu gave you earlier. It’ll be easier to carry it all.”

Zu An felt warm inside. “Thank you, little sister Qinghe.”

Even though he had the Brilliant Glass Bead with its massive storage space, it wasn’t convenient for him to bring that thing out and use it. With this pouch she had given him, he could store and take things out in broad daylight.

Murong Qinghe blushed. “Big brother Zu is too polite. I still have to thank you for all your care and help recently.”

In the distance, Murong Tong’s smile immediately froze on his face. Qin Zheng’s gloominess instantly vanished without a trace. He stroked his beard and roared with laughter. “Indeed, daughters are nothing but liabilities.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Murong Tong was speechless. How could he have anticipated that the tides would turn so quickly?

It soon became time to enter the dungeon. No matter what King Qi’s subjects really thought, they still had to wish the crown prince the best. Bi Linglong knew that the crown prince didn’t know how to reply properly, so she did it in his place.

After both sides exchanged fake conversation, King Qi’s eyes landed on Zu An as he said, “Sir Zu, I’ll have to entrust this secret dungeon mission to you.”

When they heard those words, all of the young nobles, including the Gu clan brothers, were furious. By what qualifications?! He’s just a trifling sixth rank! Why would we need to depend on him?

…

There was no lack of intelligent people among them. They quickly realized something. Why was King Qi paying so much attention to him?

Even though they belonged to different camps, they still acknowledged King Qi’s terrifying strength. Furthermore, this was the boss of the other faction, someone who could stand on equal footing against the emperor’ someone who their fathers, and even grandfathers, had to lower their heads to. Yet such a person was that concerned with Zu An?

As someone who was also part of the imperial palace, Bi Linglong knew that King Qi and Zu An had already faced each other several times, yet King Qi had never gotten what he wanted. It was completely reasonable for him to have such respect for Zu An.

Zu An wasn’t fazed at all when he saw the incoming Rage pints. He didn’t regard these people as any threat at all, saying, “King Qi, don’t worry. I will definitely ensure that the crown prince passes this test.”

King Qi’s eyes narrowed. After a moment of silence, he said in a profound manner, “It’s good for the young to be ambitious. However, if you’re too arrogant, you just might meet a premature end.”
