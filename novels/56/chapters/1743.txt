Chapter 1692: Accidental Meeting

Pei Mianman was startled and followed the source of the sound. What she saw was a great beauty whose hair reached all the way down to her bottom. She was devastatingly beautiful, but at the same time, had a dangerous aura. Anyone could tell from just a glance that approaching her for no reason wasn’t a smart choice. Pei Mianman called out, “Devil Sect Master Yun Jianyue?”

Yun Jianyue’s long hair was just too unique. After Peng Wuyan’s recent disappearance, as people had all suspected it was her doing, she had often been talked about. Elder Huo Ling had even specially warned Pei Mianman to avoid her in every way possible if she ever encountered her.

“Isn’t this little girl sharp?” Yun Jianyue remarked, nodding in appreciation. Her eyes couldn't help but dart toward Pei Mianman’s chest. This girl had been sleeping soundly a moment ago, so not even the covers could hide the impressiveness of her chest.

“Where’s my master?” Pei Mianman asked. She was actually completely tense, ready to retaliate at a moment’s notice. After all, Elder Huo Ling was right next door. Her master was always incredibly worried about her, so there was no way she wouldn’t notice a thing if someone barged in like this.

“Huo Ling? She was lured away by a small trick of mine,” Yun Jianyue said with a chuckle. She clearly didn’t treat Elder Huo Ling as a big deal at all.

Pei Mianman’s eyes darted around. She said, “I heard Ah Zu say that his relationship with you was pretty good. Ah Zu is here too, so should I bring you to see him?”

She naturally suspected that Yun Jianyue hadn’t come with good intentions, so she wanted to try to use her relationship with Ah Zu to get on her good side.

“As expected, you’re a smart girl,” Yun Jianyue said, a bit surprised by her reaction. “But I came here to invite the lady as a guest. Don’t worry, I won’t make things difficult for you, as a favor to that brat.”

“But I think right here is a good place. Or perhaps I could consult you for guidance once the competition is over?” Pei Mianman asked to test the waters. At the same time, she was a bit nervous. 

Why is master not back yet? Also, why isn’t the palace lord responding either? Could it be that they didn’t even notice the arrival of Yun Jianyue?

“Little girl, don’t try to play these tricks with me. I won’t make things hard for you because of that kid. But if you go too far, don’t forget that I’m the so-called ruthless and cold-blooded Devil Sect Master you all speak of,” Yun Jianyue said in an awe-inspiring tone. The atmosphere in the room instantly turned ice-cold.

Pei Mianman felt as if she had been targeted by a wave of terrifying energy and couldn't move at all. She could only release a helpless sigh. She had wanted to put up a struggle at first, but now that she saw the difference between them, despair sank in. She even had a feeling that even though her master was also a grandmaster, the difference in pressure between them was worlds apart. She really didn’t know just how Ah Zu could remain completely normal around a woman this terrifying.

Helpless to do anything else, she could only put on her clothes under Yun Jianyue’s supervision and follow her out. But even so, she wasn’t all that frightened. Zu An had mentioned their relationship to her before, to the extent that they were already friends.

They’re already on the level of friends, so no matter how I think about it, there’s no reason for her to harm me. But then, why is she taking me away?

…

Meanwhile, Zu An arrived at the part of Watchful Heart Peak Xie Daoyun had spoken of. He looked all around and quickly noticed some abnormalities. Even though the traces had been swept clean, he could still detect some plants and trees having been ruined. The most noticeable was the vacant expanse that should have held a gazebo; there was nothing at all now.

He could tell from the scale of the destruction that the battle was between master rank or stronger cultivators. But how could not a single person have noticed anything despite there being so many grandmasters present?

He immediately realized something and suddenly turned around. He saw Watchful Heart Peak’s Master Feng Wuchang standing there.

“So it was Sir Zu. What are you doing here so late at night?” Feng Wuchang asked in alarm. Why is this guy here? Could it be that we were exposed?

“I couldn't sleep, so I decided to go for a stroll,” Zu An replied without batting an eyelid. “Though I am curious as to why peak master would be here when it’s so late already.”

Feng Wuchang reacted quickly, replying, “What else could it be but Peng Wuyan’s disappearance? As the peak master of Watchful Heart Peak, as well as the one presiding over matters related to this competition, I need to be on the lookout to see if there is anything strange to prevent another disappearance.”

Zu An nodded. The explanation was reasonable.

Feng Wuchang was worried that he would ask more questions, so he changed the topic. “When did Sir Zu return? I haven’t seen you around recently…”

“I left for an errand a few days ago and just returned,” Zu An casually replied. As he couldn't find any more clues, he decided to say goodbye and leave.

When Feng Wuchang watched him leave, his previous smile gradually disappeared. I need to report this immediately so we can figure out how to deal with this Zu brat as quickly as possible.

…

Meanwhile, after Zu An left, he was full of doubts. This Feng Wuchang was very suspicious, and yet his behavior on the surface was so natural. He didn’t have any proof, but his sixth sense told him that the peak master was suspicious. As such, he went straight to the White Jade Sect’s side courtyard. Xie Daoyun’s cultivation wasn’t high enough, but just because she couldn't sense anything didn’t mean Yan Xuehen couldn’t.

This path to Yan Xuehen’s room was already extremely familiar to him. He didn’t go for the main entrance, but rather arrived by the window. After learning his previous lesson, he didn’t go straight in; instead, he gently tapped on the window.

“Who is it?” Yan Xuehen asked coldly.

“It’s me,” Zu An replied.

“You’re back?” Yan Xuehen called out. Her voice carried a hint of happiness at first, but then she seemed to have thought of something and snapped in annoyance, “Get lost!”

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +110 +110 +110…

Zu An was speechless. He said, “You’ve misunderstood. I came because I really have something to talk about.”

Did this woman think I was here to attack her in the middle of the night or something?

“It is already so late; a man and a woman should keep their distance. Those things can wait until tomorrow,” Yan Xuehen said. Her tone was cold, but she didn’t get angrier.

Zu An could only add, “It’s an emergency!”

There was a moment of silence. Zu An almost thought that Yan Xuehen had already gone to sleep, but then, the window opened. Yan Xuehen was already properly dressed and appeared in front of him as she said, “Speak. What is it?” She had already made up her mind that if he was deceiving her, she would be sure to give him a proper beating.

“This is what happened. Did you notice anything strange on this mountain two days ago? For example, a battle between powerful individuals?” Zu An asked.

Yan Xuehen shook her head and said, “I didn’t.”

Zu An then told her about what he and Xie Daoyun had discovered.

Yan Xuehen began to think to herself before saying, “Then, according to what you are saying, there really might have been an intense battle that took place without my notice. Someone probably arranged some special formations nearby ahead of time to seal off any leakage of energy. That is why no one noticed anything.”

“Who has that level of ability?” Zu An quickly asked.

“The daoist sect masters are practically all capable of that. However, the most adept among them would have to be Kunlun Void’s Sect Master Xuan Bajing. However, he did not come to Violet Mountain this time,” Yan Xuehen said while thinking to herself.

Zu An’s brows furrowed. He just felt as if something shocking had happened, and he just happened to have missed it all.

Yan Xuehen said, “I’ll help you ask around tomorrow. I still have some level of a relationship with the sect masters.”

Zu An was a bit worried. He said, “You need to be careful. If you really encounter those involved in a sinister plot, then things will become tricky.”

Yan Xuehen smiled and said, “Don’t worry. I know what I am doing. There are so many people in the nine sects; there is no way that all of them have allied together, right?”

Zu An figured that made sense, so he didn’t say anything else.

Yan Xuehen asked, “Where have you been as of late?”

Zu An said with a smile, “It’s quite cold outside. Why don’t you invite me in for some hot tea?” However, what he got in return was a window slam. He was completely stunned as he stared at the tightly shut window in front of him. Why did this woman always change her attitude so fast?

Inside, Yan Xuehen actually grinned. This kid really wasn’t good at telling lies. Why would he be scared of a bit of cold with his cultivation?

Zu An couldn’t really look for Chu Chuyan now, so he could only leave helplessly.

When he recalled how upset Yun Jianyue had been along the way, he decided that he would have to talk things out with her this time. At the same time, he could try to appease her anger a bit.

When he arrived at Emptiness Isle’s courtyard, he couldn't really report his visit, so he secretly snuck into Yun Jianyue’s room.

“Who is it?” Yun Jianyue called out, clearly sounding extremely vigilant.

“It’s me,” Zu An said.

“One moment!” Yun Jianyue replied, sounding a bit flustered.

When Pei Mianman, who was next to her, saw that, her eyes lit up.
