Chapter 1338: Excellent Teeth

Heichi Gu laughed loudly and said, “The Snake race really is getting worse with each generation. You want to have a lucky strike with just a thousand ki stones? There’s no harm in telling you this, but in all these years, no one has ever been able to find anything out of these lowest level, cheap rocks on the yellow floor. Only the dumbest newbies would be this naive.”

Since the bet was already set, they weren’t scared of the other party backing out anymore. If they didn’t mock them a bit in such a situation, they wouldn’t feel too good.

Yu Yanluo frowned slightly, but Zu An quickly countered, “Aren’t there still two rocks left? Why are you in such a hurry?”

Heichi Gu sneered. “Hah, look at how he’s still clinging to hope!”

Zu An said indifferently, “Since you all feel that there definitely won’t be anything, why don’t we hold another bet?”

“Do you still have ki stones? Who would bet with you?” Ban Ka noticed how Shi Min and the others appeared to just be watching with amusement, and was now certain that it was all to teach the Snake race a lesson. As such, he didn’t feel any more misgivings and was the first to mock Zu An. He thought to himself that it would be a good way of currying favor with the lion princes.

Zu An frowned and replied, “How about this? Let’s not bet with ki stones. Instead, we can bet with something else. If nothing comes out of these ki stones, I’ll eat all of these leftover rock dregs. Otherwise, you’ll have to eat them. What do you think?”

Yu Yanluo jumped in fright and quickly tugged on his sleeves. She reminded him quietly, “Ah Zu, I’m not sure if any of these will have anything inside either!”

Even though she had confidence that something could come out of the two stones, there was no guarantee. Both of them could have nothing, and at that point, wouldn’t she have harmed her lover badly?

Ban Ka was a bit hesitant at first, but when he saw how nervous Yu Yanluo was, he immediately made up his mind and replied, “Haha, then that’s settled! I’ll make this bet with you.”

Heichi Gu sneered. “Count me in too.”

“Wow, two pleasant surprises.” Zu An chuckled. He then said to Yu Yanluo in consolation, “Don’t worry, my luck has always been quite good.”

When she heard him say that, Yu Yanluo finally calmed down a bit.

Yan Xuehen was a bit puzzled. She asked, “Not even Yu Yanluo is confident, so where does he get his confidence from? He might be the one eating that stuff later, no?”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Rather than him winning, I kind of want to see him lose and eat those rocks.”

He had seen all of her earlier, and yet she hadn’t been able to fight or kill him to vent her frustration. Watching him eat such trash would be good too. She thought, Hmph, it’ll just be heaven’s way of disciplining him. Is my body something just anyone can see?

Yan Xuehen was speechless.

“Hurry up and open them already!” Heichi Gu and Ban Ka urged Zu An.

Shi Rong and Shi Gong were also excited to see Zu An make a fool of himself.

Only Shi Min’s expression was a bit strange. He raised a brow, as if he were about to say something, but he swallowed all his words back down.

The Jade Garden butler wiped some fine sweat off his forehead. He usually didn’t feel a thing even when he opened stones in the heaven or earth rooms, and yet today, he was actually feeling a bit of pressure. He carefully opened up the third stone, but nothing happened.

Heichi Gu and Ban Ka roared with laughter, saying, “I think you should just start eating these rocks already.”

Yu Yanluo was still a clan leader, and she was so beautiful. Even if they were enemies, they couldn't bring themselves to let a beauty like that eat rocks. That meant such a duty would have to be fulfilled by Zu An.

Zu An calmly replied, “We aren’t done yet, so what’s the rush?”

“Are you still not convinced? We’ve already reached this point, so what could still be left…” Ban Ka’s voice came to a screeching halt. He stared at the table in disbelief.

A trace of sparkling radiance appeared, followed by a rich burst of ki.

“This is…” Even the stone-opening butler was stunned.

The people in the surroundings all quickly rushed over. They saw that there was a grape-sized ki stone in the center of the stone. It was sparkling and translucent.

“Earth-grade ki stone!” Someone with sharp eyes immediately recognized what it was and called out. “This piece is quite good. It should be worth at least ten pieces of standard earth-grade ki stones.”

The butler shook his head and said, “It is worth more than that. Regardless of whether it is the color, the purity, or the ki inside, it is top-quality. The only pity is that it is too small. Even so, it is worth twenty standard earth grade ki stones.”

Zu An had already spent enough time in this world to pick up on most basic knowledge. Each earth-grade ki stone was equivalent to a hundred ordinary ki stones. Ki stones were the currency cultivators usually used, while ordinary people usually used gold and silver.

Back in Brightmoon Academy, Zu An had heard Wei Suo tell him that an ordinary ki stone could sell for ten taels of gold, but that wasn’t actually accurate. Normally, one ki stone was worth a tael of gold, but of course, one likely wouldn’t be able to find a ki stone even if one had two gold taels. After all, no cultivators would be willing to sell cultivation resources unless they were really strapped for cash.

Meanwhile, each heaven-grade ki stone was worth a thousand earth-grade ki stones. The higher the grade, the more precious it was, and the more beneficial it would be for one’s cultivation.

As for immortal-grade ki stones, there was no standard price of exchange. They were often only used for direct trades for other items or auctioned off for a good price.

That meant after all the calculations, the grape-sized stone was worth around two thousand ki stones.

As he shrugged and spread out his palms in front of everyone, Zu An had a mocking expression. He said, “I’m truly sorry, everyone, but my luck today seems to be just a bit good. Then, as we agreed, everyone has to pay two thousand ki stones.”

The others all looked as if they were breaking down. How could they have expected that something really would be opened up? How had they really ended up experiencing a low probability like that?!

Seeing that no one moved, Zu An asked with a smile, “What’s wrong? Are you all going to go back on your debt?”

Shi Rong harrumphed. “Look at this bumpkin acting all smug. It’s just two thousand ki stones. Why would this prince have to renege on something so insignificant?”Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He took out a pouch and tossed it over. Shi Gong also tossed over a bag unhappily. Only Shi Min’s expression remained normal when he handed over the ki stones.

Zu An caught them, but didn’t immediately put them away. Instead, he opened up the pouch and began to count them.

Shi Rong and Shi Gong were so furious they screamed, “What is the meaning of this? Do you think we would lie to you about something like this?”

You have successfully trolled Shi Rong for +444 +444 +444…

You have successfully trolled Shi Gong for +444 +444 +444…

“That’s hard to say,” Zu An said nonchalantly. He didn’t even raise his head as he counted the ki stones.

The onlookers were speechless. Why is this guy so freaking annoying?

Zu An’s smile only got bigger as the Rage points climbed higher.

When they saw his cocky smile, the others all felt more and more depressed from making the bet with him.

After counting the ki stones, Zu An handed them over to Maid Xing. Then, he urged everyone else to pay up. The others were incredibly dejected, but with the Lion race taking the lead, they could only admit their defeat.

Two thousand ki stones was no small amount for the people who frequented the yellow floor. There were even some who had to fish out more than half of their family property. They felt endless regret. Why the heck did they have to get involved in this mess?

By the time the others all paid up, Zu An had collected several tens of thousands of ki stones. He handed them all to Maid Xing.

Yu Yanluo had needed to flee to the Snake race territory in too much of a hurry, and had maintained practically no resources at her disposal. Such an amount was perfect for her to use to get on her feet again.

After doing all of that, Zu An then walked up to Ban Ka and Heichi Gu. “Thank you for the ki stones you two gifted me with. Otherwise, how else would we have been able to purchase these stones and find a treasure inside?”

The two were so angry that they were about to vomit blood. It was as if they had fanned themselves in the face, but then still had to pay up a huge amount of money! If they had known it would be like this, they wouldn’t have taken such a huge risk.

Ban Ka shot Heichi Gu a hateful look. If it weren’t for him, he wouldn’t have agreed to the bet. He had lost two thousand ki stones! Just the thought of it alone left him feeling heartbroken. Still, there were so many people watching, so he couldn't just go back on his word. He could only pay up angrily.

Zu An didn’t take the money himself, and instead had Maid Xing count everything. There was something more important to take care of at the moment, though. He remarked, “Perhaps… The two of you have forgotten about something?” He pointed at the rocks on the table after speaking.

Those in the surroundings were shaken. Even though it hurt to spend two thousand ki stones, being able to see two important figures eat the remaining rocks did redeem the situation a bit.

Even though Shi Gong and Shi Rong hated Zu An, they still looked at the two with interest. After all, this was something they had never seen before.

Ban Ka and Heichi Gu’s faces turned entirely red. They had wanted to see Zu An make a fool of himself. How had they ended up becoming a laughingstock instead?

Both of them wanted to walk away from the problem, but the Jade Garden’s butler seemed to have walked over between them and the exit before they realized it. It was hard to say what the Lion race’s princes were thinking. In the end, Ban Ka hardened his resolve and spat, “I’ll just eat it, you think I’m scared of you?”

He picked up the rock remains and tossed them into his mouth. Then, with several cracks, the rocks were quickly ground into powder.

Zu An clicked his tongue in wonder. In the animal kingdom of his previous world, other predators would normally eat meat, but hyenas could even crunch through and eat bones. He hadn’t expected the teeth of the Hyena race of this world to be so formidable too.

Soon afterward, Ban Ka swallowed all of the rock powder. Then, he pointed at the remaining half and asked Heichi Gu, “What are you staring at me for? That’s your half.”

Heichi Gu was speechless. With a harrumph, he took the remaining half and crunched through it. The rubble shattered easily like a frozen popsicle.

Those in the surroundings began to discuss the sight excitedly with each other. No wonder the Black Teeth race were known for their teeth’s prowess. Their teeth really were pretty tough.

“Is that good enough?” Heichi Gu asked. He felt truly humiliated and turned around to leave.

However, Zu An quickly called him back, asking, “What are you in such a hurry for? There’s still one more stone to open up.”
