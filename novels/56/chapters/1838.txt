Chapter 1787: Throwing Lives Away

“You’ve misunderstood,” Qiu Honglei said, secretly shooting Zu An a look. “She’s the master of Ah Zu’s wife. She has nothing to do with him.”

Are you kidding me? Even though that nickname master gave to Yan Xuehen, ‘stone cold woman’, is a bit offensive, it’s quite fitting.

Whether it was the righteous sects or the Devil Sect, all of them publicly acknowledged that Yan Xuehen’s nature was extremely cold. There had never been any news of her being interested in a man before. There were even some who had wondered if she already lost all emotion after cultivating the Unshakable Daoist Manual. How could a woman like that possibly have feelings of romance?

Jing Teng was stunned, asking, “Huh? She is your master?”

“No, my master is someone else,” Qiu Honglei replied, not knowing why Jing Teng asked that..

“But you said she was the master of young master Zu’s wife,” Jing Teng said in confusion.

Qiu Honglei choked for a moment. She could only explain, “I was referring to another wife of Ah Zu…” When she saw Jing Teng look at her strangely, she quickly added, “They’ve already divorced and have nothing to do with each other now.”

A strange smile appeared on Jing Teng’s face. After a pause, she said, “The harem really is messy.”

Qiu Honglei was speechless. To be honest, she was panicking a bit inwardly. It’s all Ah Zu’s fault for being so fickle in love!

You have successfully trolled Qiu Honglei for +99 +99 +99…

Jing Teng had her own thoughts. Qiu Honglei likely couldn’t sense anything because she was involved, but there was definitely something strange about that white-clad woman’s reactions.

Meanwhile, Zu An had been explaining to Wei Suo how he could end up having some conflict with the emperor in the future. When he saw the sudden Rage points, he couldn't help but turn around and take a look. 

What are those two talking about for them to get this angry?

Wei Suo remarked with a bitter expression, “Boss, aren’t you a bit too bold here? You actually made the emperor your enemy!”

“The main reason I’m telling you about this is so that you can prepare mentally. This matter is also extremely important and you have your own clan to worry about, so it’ll be dangerous for you to remain with me,” Zu An warned him.

Wei Suo said with an upright expression, “Am I the type who would run away when my friends are in trouble? Don’t worry, I’ll definitely stand at boss’ side.”

Zu An said with a frown, “I recall that the Wei clan has always been on the emperor’s side. This might bring danger to your clan.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“What clan do I have left? Our Wei clan has already been ruined. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been forced to roam the wilderness,” Wei Suo replied, a courageous expression appearing on his face. “In the end, this isn’t the Great Zhou Dynasty, but rather a secret dungeon. The emperor wouldn’t even recognize me. Furthermore, if we really are going to get rid of the emperor, our Wei clan might even be able to make a comeback.”

Zu An chuckled and said, “I didn’t expect you to have the heart of an adventurer. Alright, then. If that really happens, I definitely won’t forget what you’ve done.”

Wei Suo smiled and replied, “It’s still boss who’s the most dependable.”

…

The group secretly approached the great tomb. But even though they were getting closer, they still remained rather far away.

The area that was closest to the entrance was occupied by the world’s major forces. Past that area were some weaker clans and powers. Even farther out were some wandering warriors and the like. They were kept at a distance by the major powers, so they all cursed at that moment.

Zu An’s group just happened to be near the very outskirts. They weren’t in as much of a hurry as the others. According to what Jing Teng had said, entering first wouldn’t necessarily be a good thing.

Zu An was a bit confused as he looked at the mass of people. In the past, secret dungeons had been limited to a single scenario. Even though the worlds were big, the survivors weren’t normally all that populous. But the things they had seen so far seemed to suggest that this was a thriving world. It wasn’t much different from the Great Zhou Dynasty.

Is this really just a secret dungeon? Zu An thought, suddenly feeling as if he were living in a dream.

While he was confused, however, some strange runes suddenly lit up. The wind and clouds stirred. Rich spiritual energy gradually descended into the world. Those present were alarmed. Such phenomena meant that something major was about to happen.

Sure enough, the great tomb suddenly rumbled. The destructive aura that had gathered around the tomb gradually dissipated.

No one knew who spoke up first, but someone roared, “The great tomb’s seal has been opened!”

Zhao Han was the strongest, so he naturally pushed open the door and entered first. He thought of closing the door to prevent the others from even having a chance at the immortal opportunity. However, after thinking about it, there were many strong beings outside. If he tried to take it all for himself, he could end up incurring the wrath of all of them.

Even though he didn’t fear them, dealing with them would still be a bit troublesome. Thus, it would be better to let them in. The tomb was too large, so he needed people to serve as cannon fodder to explore it too. As for whether or not one of them would really find the immortal opportunity, he just had to steal it from them then.

As such, he stopped hesitating and went straight in to explore. Xuan Bajing and Li Changsheng were also excited. They quickly followed along.

Then, the people outside the great tomb rushed toward it like fish being fed. They all pushed and shoved as they swarmed forward. If someone were to watch from above, perhaps they would even develop agoraphobia just from the sight.

In such a situation, conflict was inevitable. All those who could make it here were tough. It was to be expected for them to shed blood over a single small argument. However, they knew that exploring the tomb was more important. It would be one thing if they were fighting for a treasure, but they hadn’t even entered yet. Fighting to the death outside was a bit laughable. As such, conflict was limited to a certain extent. It ultimately just amounted to some curses directed at other people’s families.

The tomb was just too large, to the extent that it could even hold over ten thousand people entering. Zu An and his party weren’t in a rush at all. Instead, they calmly watched from the outside. After all, Zhao Han was also inside, so it was best if they didn’t bump into each other.

Zu An turned around and asked Jing Teng, “Miss Jing, since your body is in the tomb, you must know quite a bit about it. Do you know of any shortcuts we can take?”

The current situation had even more traffic than roads and trains during Chinese New Year when everyone went home to see their family. He really didn’t want to push and shove with the rest of the crowd.

Jing Teng shook her head and replied, “I don’t. This great tomb is quite strange in that it only has a single path.”

Zu An was speechless.

Qiu Honglei said unhappily, “We’re all helping you out here, so can’t you just tell us what you know? Do you really have to talk in riddles like this?”

Jing Teng was a bit apologetic as she replied, “It isn’t that I don’t wish to speak, but rather that after the great disaster I suffered, I only managed to survive due to a seed I planted just in case. It was already incredible for me to be reborn, but not only have I lost my former power, I’ve also lost my memories.”

The rest of them couldn't really say much else when they heard that. However, Jing Teng continued, “Don’t worry, it isn’t a big deal to let them enter first.”

When they saw that she was completely certain, the group nodded and waited there. Only when even the individual travelers went in did they start moving unhurriedly.

The tomb’s entrance had already been open for quite a while, so it was nowhere near as cramped as before. Looking at it from a distance, the pitch-black tomb gate was like the deep and dark mouth of an endless abyss that waited to swallow up everything.

Only when he came close did Zu An discover that the tomb gate was ridiculously large. It was more than thirty meters tall and several hundred meters wide. No wonder so many people were able to fit inside even while pushing and shoving.

“I wonder just what kind of being created such a grand and massive tomb. Could it really be an ancient daoist immortal?” Qiu Honglei couldn't help but wonder with a sigh. She wondered whether it was some kind of imperial tomb, but which emperor could create a tomb of this scale?

Jing Teng shook her head and said, “In the past, even the immortal ruler didn’t seem to have been able to find out who created this tomb. Of course, there’s a chance that he found out and didn’t tell me, since I was nothing more than a fiend he enlightened in passing.”

When she felt the loneliness and dejection in Jing Teng’s words, Qiu Honglei couldn't help but console her a bit.

Suddenly, there was a strange disturbance. It turned out that many of the people who had rushed into the tomb seemed to have encountered something terrifying and were running back out. Many of them were even flying, meaning that their cultivation ranks weren’t low.

Wei Suo stopped one of them and asked, “What’s happening up ahead?”

However, that person’s face was filled with horror. It was completely pale, as if he had seen something utterly terrifying. He opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Then, he panicked and pushed Wei Suo away.

Wei Suo was caught off guard and staggered, almost falling. Zu An quickly reached out to pull him back, and only then was Wei Suo saved from being trampled into mush.

Zu An took his group to a corner. Qiu Honglei’s hands moved quickly, and a wall of light surrounded them. All of the other people rushing toward them were pushed away.

It was the Wall of Sighs! Who would have thought that it could be used like this?

Jing Teng closed her eyes. A hint of happiness appeared on her face. For some reason, when she bathed in the light, every single cell in her body cheered. She couldn't help but develop a much more favorable impression of Qiu Honglei. She thought briefly, Should I just tie her up next to me and have her feed me light?

Zu An noticed that many of the people who were running back out were covered in blood, and some were even missing limbs. He wondered what they had experienced in such a short amount of time.

Jing Teng said, “In the past, Immortal Ruler Baopu subdued evil throughout the world and encountered countless powerful creatures. It was quite difficult to fully kill those monsters, so he decided to just lock them up in the great tomb.”

The others were speechless. No wonder she had always been so calm. With those terrifying monsters guarding the surroundings, all those people trying to run in first had practically been throwing their lives away!
