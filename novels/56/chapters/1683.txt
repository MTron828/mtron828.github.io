Chapter 1632: Falling Out

“Ah!” Elder Huo Ling cried out in alarm.

She quickly stood up, but Guan Chouhai took a step forward and ended up right in front of her, saying, “Elder, I don’t think we seniors should participate in the battles between juniors.”

Elder Hou Ling’s expression became unpleasant. However, what he said was reasonable and she couldn't retort against it. Furthermore, if she really wanted to go against Guan Chouhai, she wouldn’t be able to take him down in a short amount of time. Meanwhile, Manman would already be seriously injured by that time.

Zu An also suddenly got up, intending to save her, but he suddenly thought of something and sat back down.

Yan Xuehen, who had always been secretly watching Zu An, also retracted her gaze. She thought to herself, This Miss Pei seems to be quite important to Zu An.

Many disciples who were watching couldn't help but cover their eyes. All of them had seen the power of Zhi Yin’s Shadowless Ball. If not for the seniors protecting this place, even the stage would have been destroyed. Now, it was going to slam straight into Pei Mianman’s chest, so how could she possibly take it? Most importantly, even if she survived, would those breasts be okay? If not, what would be the point then?!

Many men cursed Zhi Yin! This guy normally seemed elegant and graceful, but why hadn’t he struck anywhere else this time and gone for her chest? Would he be able to compensate her for her loss?

In contrast, some female cultivators were really excited. The pressure Pei Mianman had given them was way too great. They wanted their big brother Zhi Yin to teach this vixen a lesson.

However, the moment the Shadowless Ball was about to hit Pei Mianman, a large bronze cauldron projection surrounded her.

Bang!Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

With a loud noise, the bronze figure trembled slightly, and the Shadowless Ball was sent flying back. Zhi Yin caught the Shadowless Ball as it returned. He was full of shock. What is this situation?

It wasn’t just him; even the sect masters were all moved. They all stuck out their necks to see what was going on.

The projection wasn’t actually a large cauldron; rather, it was a strange bird with gorgeous patterns around it. It looked a bit like a cauldron, because the bird’s legs and tail appeared to form the supports of one. It looked somewhat similar to an owl, but it was much stranger and more ferocious-looking. Its eyes in particular almost seemed to be alive. They were full of a strange, mysterious air.

What kind of weapon was this? It could actually block the attack of an immortal-grade weapon! That was what the spectators were puzzled about. They all looked at Wan Tongtian and Elder Huo Ling.

Wan Tongtian was also stunned. This wasn’t something Jadefall Palace had given her. He gave Elder Huo Ling an inquiring look.

However, Elder Huo Ling was also completely confused. But if she as the master admitted that she didn’t know, wouldn’t the others all laugh their heads off? As such, she stuck out her chest, looking extremely proud.

When the others saw that, they felt even more admiration. They thought to themselves, Elder Huo Ling really did hide her strength well! In the future, they had to try and build a relationship with her for sure.

Qiu Honglei asked Yun Jianyue, “Master, just what is that? It looks so strong.”

“I don’t know,” Yun Jianyue said, shaking her head. “But that kid definitely knows, so you can just ask him later.”

Qiu Honglei followed her gaze and saw the smile on Zu An’s lips, as if he had already known that this would be the result.

Of course Zu An knew what it was. The object was Fu Hao’s owl statue, which Big Manman had obtained from the Yinxu secret dungeon. He hadn’t expected her to activate its protective effect.

Suddenly, Fu Hao’s Owl transformed, actually taking the form of a giant owl. As it appeared, the entire stage was surrounded by a black, ink-like darkness. The disciples outside couldn't see what was happening inside at all.

Wang Wuxie and the others were all shocked, thinking, What is this? They all extended their auras to sense what was going on. They discovered that their ki, which could normally pass through most things, became incredibly sluggish in the darkness. They could only reach in a bit, even after a long time. With their cultivation, if they were standing at the edge of the stage, they would naturally be able to see what was happening inside; however, with their status, how could they bring themselves to do that?

They were all shocked. The darkness was already approaching the grandmaster level! What kind of incredible weapon was this?

Only Guan Chouhai was worried. He reflexively wanted to move toward the stage. However, Elder Huo Ling moved in front of him with a smile and said, “Sect Master Guan, I don’t think we seniors should participate in the battles between juniors, now, can we?”

Guan Chouhai choked. He hadn’t expected his words to be so quickly sent right back at him.

Suddenly, several roars emerged from the stage, accompanied by heavy impacts at an urgent pace. It was clear that Zhi Yin was sending the Shadowless Ball in every direction. The formation around the stage flickered crazily, clearly on the verge of collapse because of the Shadowless Ball.

The disciples were all incredibly shocked. Zhi Yin’s Shadowless Ball was just too strong, right? One would be seriously injured by a mere brush from it!

Only Wu Xiaofan, Wan Guiyi, and a few others’ expressions grew grave as they muttered, “Zhi Yin might be defeated here.”

Even though Zhi Yin’s Shadowless Ball was powerful, it was still something they could understand; however, this domain of darkness Pei Mianman displayed was completely outside their comprehension. They didn’t even think they could do much better than Zhi Yin. Zhi Yin could rely on the Shadowless Ball to defend himself through offense, but what about them?

…

Meanwhile, on the stage, Zhi Yin was extremely alarmed, because he discovered that he couldn't see a thing. Normally, when one’s cultivation reached a certain point, there was actually no need to use one’s eyes anymore, as they could use their senses to perceive their surroundings. But he couldn't sense a thing! There was only extremely thick darkness.

Helpless to do anything else, he could only frantically send out his Shadowless Ball, hoping he could hit his opponent by chance. It was just too quiet for him, and the dead silence was absolutely frightening. He could only show his fighting spirit through shouting.

Meanwhile, Pei Mianman was hiding only a few meters away from him. The reason why it had been so hard for her to evade the Shadowless Ball was because Zhi Yin could see her. Now, however, it wasn’t hard for her to avoid these aimless attacks. In such darkness, she reigned supreme.

She silently waited for an opportunity. Sure enough, it was difficult for one to show no openings in a place where they couldn't sense anything, and she soon found one.

Jadefall Haze!

A terrifying wave of heat spread outward. It was like a mist, but also like the sunset; it was beautiful and dangerous.

…

Outside the battlefield, Elder Huo Ling’s eyes lit up. She could sense her own absolute skill’s aura. Furthermore, whenever that skill was used, it could often decide victory and defeat.

Sure enough, with a loud noise, a figure flew out of the stage. They were completely scorched black, and their hair was also a mess. Their clothes were tattered like that of a beggar on the street.

“Zhi Yin?”

There were only two people on the stage. It was clear that it wasn’t Pei Mianman, whose body would have surged with waves, so it could only be the other one. Even though they couldn't associate this sorry figure with the handsome and noble prince they had seen before, this was the reality! The spectators were left in disbelief.

“Zhi Yin actually lost?”

“And he lost so badly?”

“I knew that this pretty face didn’t have much skill. He only knew how to act cool all day. Now, he’s become history’s fifth representative disciple to be upset.”

All sorts of gossip surrounded him. Zhi Yin was already seriously injured, so how could he still endure such a thing? Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he passed out.

“My disciple!” Guan Chouhai cried out and quickly rushed to Zhi Yin’s side. When he checked Zhi Yin’s condition, he discovered that many of his bones were broken, and his meridians were in an even worse state from the power of the fire element. He couldn't help but roar furiously at the stage, “How dare you attack so mercilessly!”

The darkness on the stage gradually scattered. Pei Mianman’s figure rocked back and forth as she appeared. When she heard that, she opened her mouth, as if she wanted to defend herself, but for some reason, she said nothing.

Guan Chouhai was shocked and furious. He had never expected Zhi Yin to lose! After all, Zhi Yin was Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s best disciple, someone who represented the dignity of both Heavenly Sorrow Sect and himself! Heavenly Sorrow Sect had been truly humiliated by this event.

Not only would Zhi Yin be nailed to the pillar of shame for the rest of history, as his master, he would also follow in that humiliation. Furthermore, he would become an eternal sinner to the Heavenly Sorrow Sect. Just from the thought that hundreds of years later, Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s disciples would still be blaming him, he felt a chill run from head to toe.

When he saw that Pei Mianman didn’t respond to him, he was even more furious, roaring, “You witch, just what kind of sinister thing did you use to scheme against Zhi Yin?!”

He had already made up his mind that he absolutely couldn’t acknowledge the battle’s results. Furthermore, he believed that Pei Mianman’s true strength was indeed lower than Zhi Yin’s. She must have won purely through that strange bronze statue, as a fluke.

Elder Huo Ling retorted furiously, “Guan Chouhai, what kind of bullshit are you uttering out of that mouth of yours right now? So if my disciple wins, it’s a scheme, but if your disciple wins, it’s right and proper?” Her nature had always been fiery to begin with. Now, she couldn't hold back her curses anymore.

Guan Chouhai was a sect master; when had he ever been cursed at before? He glowered and responded, “What is that ink-like darkness? Don’t tell me it’s a skill from your Jadefall Palace.”

“Is it your business as to whether we have such a skill or not?” Elder Huo Ling retorted. In truth, she was actually really curious about what that move was. Of course, there was no way she would give in here.

Guan Chouhai sneered and shouted, “It had no sign of an orthodox sect’s righteous display of strength at all! It was like some treacherous trick of the Devil Sect. If you don’t explain this properly, for all we know, some damned bastard ended up in our daoist sects to cause trouble!”
