Chapter 1225: Bluefield Country

Zu An’s group hurried along their journey for several days. The lizards moved much faster than horses, almost catching up to the speed of his previous world’s green trains[1].

He sighed in amazement. His previous world had science and technology, while this world had cultivation; and yet for many things, the same result had been achieved, just through different means.

He continued to appreciate the ways of the fiend races’ side of the world. He had previously read some records about them at the academy, but being here personally still felt different. The fiend races’ lands were much poorer than the human territory, and their way of life also seemed to be tougher.

There were several groups observing them along the way, as if they were seriously considering attacking the carriage. But when they saw the strength of the lizards in the front and that the people inside the carriage were even stronger, none of them dared to make a move.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Later on, those forces seemed to have reached some kind of agreement. In the end, they decided that they were going to divide up this nice piece of fatty meat. However, the scouting group they sent out was struck down ruthlessly by Zu An.

From then on, their trip to the capital went much more smoothly. The various forces scattered, and they didn’t even seem to be interested in anything like revenge.

“The fiend races’ side is much more practical after all. They didn’t hesitate to retreat as soon as they realized that they couldn't win,” Yan Xuehen said in surprise.

“If you clearly can’t win but you don’t retreat to preserve your strength, doesn’t that just mean there’s something wrong with your head?” Yun Jianyue said, admiring their way of doing things.

“Hmph, you really are from the Devil Sect; you’re no different from these fiend races.” Yan Xuehen sneered.

“Um, hold on here… I seem to be caught up in the offense too,” Yu Yanluo said unhappily. These were two honorable grandmasters, and yet when it involved each other, they became just like little girls. She really didn’t know how to feel about that.

Yan Xuehen was a bit apologetic. She said, “I’m sorry; I wasn’t talking about you.”

“I know,” Yu Yanluo replied with a smile. But she was getting a headache from listening to them argue constantly, so she changed the topic and said to Zu An, “We’ll be arriving at Bluefield Country soon. The Blue Earthflowers you were looking for before can be found here.”

Beautiful blue-green fields covered the mountains. Sometimes, they flickered beautifully like jade; at other times, they appeared like blue-green flames. This was precisely the place where Blue Earthflowers came from.

Zu An’s eyes lit up. It would have been extremely hard for him to obtain even a single stalk of Blue Earthflower on the human side, but it was much easier here over on the fiend races’ side. He had to establish some kind of trade company here, one that exchanged goods between the humans and the fiends. They would then be able to enjoy the best of each other’s worlds!

Of course, he knew that was probably still something he could only think about. Considering how much both sides hated each other, that would be completely impossible. Even Yu Yanluo’s business dealings with the Snake race were done in secret, and yet in the end, Xu Yu had still caught her red-handed, leading to the destruction of the Yu clan’s foundation.

Yun Jianyue asked curiously, “What do you need the Blue Earthflowers for?”

Zu An replied, “I have a friend who needs them for a breakthrough.”

“What kind of breakthrough needs stuff like that? I’ve never heard of such a thing before,” Yun Jianyue said. She was a grandmaster, so she had all manner of knowledge. However, she had never heard of anyone using Blue Earthflowers for a breakthrough.

Zu An was wondering how to explain himself when Yan Xuehen said with a cold snort, “There are endless cultivation methods in this world; each individual has a completely different constitution. What’s so strange about this?”

She thought that it was a material needed for Mo Xi’s breakthrough, and was worried that Yun Jianyue would keep asking until she found out who Mo Xi was. That was her and Zu An’s secret; she definitely didn’t want other people to know.

“Stone cold woman, it’s already been a few days. Are you already itching for another beating?” Yun Jianyue asked threateningly.

Zu An quickly intervened and changed the topic. He asked, “Yanluo, is Bluefield Country the place where fox-spirits come from?”

Yun Jianyue was also interested now. There were many legends regarding fox-spirits in the human world, and such fox-spirits normally came from Bluefield Country.

Yan Xuehen secretly gave Zu An a look. She remembered how Zu An had suggested that he would talk to Yun Jianyue so that the other woman wouldn’t bully her anymore, but she had refused at the time. Yet now, she was actually secretly grateful for his help. It even felt a little sweet.

Her expression stiffened when she realized that. It’s definitely that damn skill messing with me again!

“It can probably be considered that. Among the Fox race, the majority are women, and the current leader is also a woman. Her cultivation talent is average and she isn’t good in battle, but she is quite good at charm techniques,” Yu Yanluo didn’t want to hear the two other women fight anymore, so she played along and explained to the rest.

Zu An suddenly thought of Daji, wondering if she had any kind of relationship with the Bluefield Country of this world. Is this Fox race made up of her descendants?

“The leader is a woman?” Yun Jianyue asked. She couldn't help but give Zu An a look, remarking, “Then this guy might not be able to walk properly after seeing her.”

Yan Xuehen reflexively replied, “Who knows? He has quite the luck with girls; it might be that Bluefield Country’s leader who can’t walk properly anymore.”

Yun Jianyue had a strange expression as she remarked, “Not bad at all… Stone cold woman, you actually learned a thing or two about emotions? You seem to understand Zu An even better than I do.”

Yan Xuehen’s face turned a bit red. She looked away and ignored the other woman.

Yu Yanluo said, “As a clan leader myself, I ought to pay Bluefield Country’s leader a visit. But in order to prevent side issues from growing, let’s just keep a low profile when we enter the city. Once we procure the Blue Earthflowers, we’ll leave. Ah Zu, is that okay?”

Zu An said with an earnest expression, “Of course it is. Time is pressing, so it’s more important for us to move quickly.” With the most beautiful Fox race individual, Daji, at his side, he didn’t have much interest in that Bluefield Country leader or whatever.

Yun Jianyue sighed and said, “I’m actually pretty interested in that fox-spirit. Since I’m passing through the area, I wouldn’t mind exchanging some pointers with her in charm techniques.”

Yan Xuehen harrumphed. “Hmph, shameless.”

Yun Jianyue was about to act out when Zu An exclaimed in surprise, “Huh? You know charm techniques? I had no idea.”

Even Yu Yanluo gave her a curious look. If Yan Xuehen was like an immortal who stood at the very peak of a snowy mountain, Yun Jianyue usually seemed poised and dignified, full of almost palpable killing intent that prevented others from even daring to look straight at her. Such a woman definitely wouldn’t be alluring or seductive in the slightest.

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “If I didn’t, who would have taught Honglei her charm techniques? It’s just that there hasn’t been any man in this world worth using it on, that’s all.”

As soon as she finished, Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo turned to look at Zu An. Yun Jianyue was embarrassed and angry, protesting, “What are you all looking at him for?!”

…

Just like that, the party bickered and argued along the way. They quickly entered Bluefield City. Since the Snake race’s lizard carriage was too eye-catching and they didn’t want to draw attention to themselves, Yu Yanluo had Maid Xing and her subordinates stay outside. Meanwhile, the group headed into the city.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were both a bit curious about the Fox race, so they went along. Both of them wore veils over their faces to avoid provoking any unnecessary trouble.

.

The city gate was between two large fox-head sculptures. There were all kinds of street lamps and stone carvings along the way, all depicting different foxes. The city was filled with the smell of cosmetics as well.

There were gorgeously dressed fox ladies everywhere; some were tall and slender, some were voluptuous, and some were cute… They dressed more daringly than humans did, but didn’t really reveal anything either. It was precisely that kind of outfit that was right on the verge of showing something that was the most enticing.

The fox ladies all had one thing in common, which was that they all had pretty, fluffy ears. Between that and their natural charm, they gave off a natural sense of seduction. There were men of many different races around them. They chatted in a cheerful and lively manner, as if they were very close.

At that instant, Zu An felt as if he had returned to one of his previous world’s nightclubs!

Yu Yanluo reminded the group quietly, “Don’t think that these fox ladies are affectionate and passionate; in reality, it’s really hard to take advantage of them in any way. Their race loves toying with the hearts of others, and it’s easy to get lost in their games.”

Yan Xuehen was surprised. She asked, “If many people know about that, why do these people still keep going after them?”

Yun Jianyue laughed out loud and replied, “That’s why I always say that you don’t understand men!”

Yan Xuehen sneered. “You make it sound as if you understand them really well or something!”

While the two of them were arguing, a flirtatious voice called out. “I can see that your group seems to have a bloody calamity lingering around you. Perhaps I can carry out a divination for all of you?”

1. The terms ‘green-skinned train’ and ‘green train’ refer to a design that used to be the mainstay of the passenger railway fleets of China and other communist countries during the Cold War. The phrases carry connotations of slow travel on old vehicles with few amenities, most notably lacking air conditioning. Despite those connotations, some newer trains have been painted green for nostalgic purposes. ☜
