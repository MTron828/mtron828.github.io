Chapter 1785: Kiss of the Goddess

“What is it?” Baogu replied, turning around to look at her.

Chu Chuyan struggled to resist the drowsiness. She recalled what the mercenary group had brought up earlier and said, “My husband should be near the tomb. I believe he will most likely participate in something as lively as the opening of the great tomb. I hope that senior can carry a message for me.”

“What message?” Baogu asked curiously.

“Tell him that my greatest blessing in this life was marrying him in Brightmoon City. We no longer share any destiny in this life, but if there is a next life, I hope we can be husband and wife once more,” Chu Chuyan said, blushing faintly as she spoke. After all, Manman was still there.

“Why aren’t you asking him to come and save you?” Baogu asked, finding it a bit strange.

“That is because this is an extreme skill of the famous and powerful Ghost King. If even your respected self cannot do anything about it, telling him would only be adding to his worries. Rather than making him feel the pain of being unable to save me for the rest of his life, I would rather not tell him,” Chu Chuyan replied.

“Famous and powerful?” Baogu remarked, raising a brow. She seemed to have thought of something, but she still held back in the end. She continued to look at Chu Chuyan, and couldn't help but sigh deeply. Eventually, she said, “I didn’t expect you to be the romantic type. Someone who can receive the unswerving favor of a woman like you must be an outstanding man. Fine, I’ll be sure to pass along your message. What is his name, and what characteristics does he have?”

Chu Chuyan was a bit embarrassed, but she still said, “His name is Zu An…” Then, she described his characteristics.

“Is there really a man so handsome?” Baogu muttered as she listened to the description. Then, she nodded and said, “Don’t worry. As long as he appears near the tomb, I’ll definitely bring him your message. However, if he doesn’t come, there’s nothing I can do either. My remnant won’t hold on for much longer either.”

“Thank you, senior,” Chu Chuyan said with a bow.

The female projection nodded, then looked at Pei Mianman and asked, “What about you? Do you have any last cherished desires?”

Pei Mianman’s expression became extremely strange, but she still said, “I also wish for senior to bring my man a message.”

“Hm? This really is strange,” Baogu remarked, thinking to herself, These two are such romantics. Aren’t they a bit too invested in such things? However, she replied, “That’s fine. What do you want to tell your man?”

Chu Chuyan gave Pei Mianman a look. She pretended not to care, but she secretly perked up her ears. There was no way for Pei Mianman to speak privately as she said, “I want senior to tell him that my happiest time was the decades we spent in the Yinxu Secret Dungeon. It would have been amazing if we had never emerged again. If there’s such a thing as reincarnation, I’m willing to be with him again.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Chu Chuyan’s expression grew strange. The two had already been husband and wife for several decades? No wonder their relationship seemed even closer than her own as the proper wife. She hadn’t actually misunderstood the situation!

Baogu carefully examined Pei Mianman and said,“You also have stunning looks. To carry such strong feelings, the man a woman like you favors must definitely be rare. Tell me his name, and I’ll definitely convey your words to him.”

Pei Mianman’s face reddened. She gave Chu Chuyan a really uncomfortable look. Chuyan also guiltily avoided her gaze as she began, “His name is Zu An…”

“So his name was also Zu An. What a coincidence,” Baogu said with a nod. Suddenly, her expression changed and she asked, “Don’t tell me the two of you are talking about the same man?”

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman were a bit embarrassed. They helplessly shook their heads and said, “He is indeed the same person.”

“What?!” Baopu exclaimed, startled. “The two of you are so stunning, and yet you’re actually so hell-bent on liking the same man?!”

The two exchanged a look, then said with a sigh, “That is indeed the case.”

“Are you being controlled by that person through some evil method?” Baopu asked with a frown. Even in her own time, the two women before her would have been extraordinary and devastatingly beautiful people. Shouldn’t countless people have been pursuing them? How had they ended up liking the same man instead?

Both of them saw each other’s worry and quickly explained, “It’s a long story, but we really do love Ah Zu. We weren’t forced in any way.”

“I you love your man so much, shouldn’t love be exclusive? Why are the two of you still able to remain as close as sisters?” Baopu asked in confusion.

“We were actually really good friends, and we’ve gone through too many life-and-death situations together. That’s why our rivalry in love only seems insignificant in comparison,” both women said with a sigh.

Baopu sneered and said, “I guess it’s fine. I’m now quite interested in seeing just what kind of man could steal the hearts of both of you at the same time.”

She was about to leave when Pei Mianman stopped her and said, “Senior, please wait.”

The woman turned around and looked at her calmly, waiting for her to continue. Pei Mianman then said after some hesitation, “When senior finds him, if there are other women at his side, please don’t get upset and blame him.”

Chu Chuyan thought to herself, It’s still Manman who understands Ah Zu well. That guy had so many sweethearts at his side, so there were probably more accompanying him right now. If this Senior Baogu got angry because of the two of them, she could end up berating him for being shameless. In the end, Baogu was the wife of the immortal ruler, so they didn’t know how strong she was. He would be in danger if she attacked him out of anger.

The female figure was so angry she actually laughed when she heard that. She exclaimed, “Is there something wrong with your heads?”

Pei Mianman’s face heated up. Chu Chuyan helped her by explaining, “Senior has misunderstood. We actually know about them too. Ah Zu is someone who understands love and emotions. The women he likes are definitely not ordinary women, and they’ve definitely gone through countless trials together. If we’re going to die, why not just let them enjoy their lives? We sincerely wish for them to live happily, rather than for him to grieve over us for the rest of his life and be like the living dead, something we would never want.”

Pei Mianman also nodded and added, “That’s right. That’s also what I wish for. Ah Zu has sacrificed enough for me in this life. I don’t want him to live the rest of his life like that.”

Baopu paced back and forth in the cave. She was clearly really annoyed. The scene before her seemed to have caused her brain to short-circuit a bit.

After a while, she looked at the two of them and asked seriously, “Why aren’t you two fighting anymore? Are you really going to surrender just like that?”

“If the situation weren’t so dire, of course we would. How could we just step aside for them?” Chu Chuyan harrumphed. Then, her expression darkened as she said, “However, we’re already doomed to die, so how can we still muster such feelings?”

Baopu said with a sigh, “So it was only because you were going to die that you became discouraged. I almost thought that I’d lived all these years for nothing.”

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman were a bit speechless. It was hard for them to even keep their eyelids from falling, and yet this was what the other woman was getting worked up over.

Baopu hesitated for a moment before saying, “Whatever, whatever! This will was woken up by the two of you, so I share some karma with you two. I really can’t just watch such a pair of romantic women become so forlorn.”

Then, she reached out her hand. Two specks of golden light tapped against their foreheads. The two women were already about to fall asleep, so they couldn’t react in time at all.

“Senior, what are you doing?” Chu Chuyan asked in confusion, feeling her mind become a bit clearer.

“My current self indeed can’t undo your Glare of Eternal Slumber. But when I was in a helpless state in the past, I created a skill of my own. The two of you can actually save yourselves,” Baopu said, her expression turning a bit strange.

“What kind of skill is it?” Pei Mianman asked in puzzlement.

Baopu seemed to blush a bit as she replied, “This skill is called ‘Kiss of the Goddess’.”

Pei Mianman and Chu Chuyan were speechless.

When she saw their expressions, Baogu became a bit annoyed. She snapped, “Don’t think random thoughts! The reason I created this ultimate skill wasn’t because of Immortal Ruler Baopu. It’s just… just…

“Forget it, you’ll realize it yourselves later,” she said, her figure fading. “Sigh, I was planning to carry your message, but now, it seems that I’ll actually need you two to help me with something.”

When they saw her current state, Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman already knew that she had used up all of her own power to help the two of them. She would disappear soon. They cried out, “Senior!”

Baopu smiled and said, “Everything is according to fate. There’s no need for the two of you to be broken-hearted. If you remember to help me give Immortal Ruler Baopu’s remains a slap to the face in the great tomb, that should be enough. No, wait. The two of you need to each give him a slap.”

The two women were stunned. This couple’s feelings seem to be a bit…

“The two of you aren’t completely saved yet, so you need to seize the moment,” Baopu said. Afterward, she disappeared into nothingness.

The specks of golden light on the two women’s foreheads entered their minds. The two immediately comprehended a mysterious skill.
