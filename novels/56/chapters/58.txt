Chapter 59: Gambler’s Fallacy

Translator: Pika

“Retaliation?” Chu Chuyan was stunned. “Are you calling gambling a form of retaliation?”

“Indeed,” Zu An replied matter-of-factly. “With all the influence it wields, it would be an easy feat for the Chu clan to deal with a mere underworld organization, or so I thought. It turns out it was all for show. Since your hands are tied, I can only help myself, then.”

“What do you intend to do?” Chu Chuyan asked.

“I’ll win all of their money, of course!” Zu An said earnestly.

Snow sneered. “In the end, isn’t that still gambling?”

“It’s only called gambling if there’s risk involved. If we win all the time, it’s called ‘withdrawing money’. The old patriarchs of the Chu clan forbade its clan members from gambling to ensure that later generations did not repeat their ancestors’ mistakes. They never anticipated one of their descendants marrying a Gambling God like me, who can win every single bet he makes. If they did, they would surely give their wholehearted approval!”

Chu Chuyan scoffed callously. “There’s no gambler in this world who makes a bet thinking that he would lose his money. Just look at how many people have lost their fortunes from gambling!”

Zu An took out a money pouch from his robe and said, “Don’t worry, I won’t be using the Chu clan’s money. I got this from Plum Blossom Thirteen earlier today. Even if I lose, I would just be returning these possessions back to their owner. What do you think about it?”

Chu Chuyan didn’t respond immediately. She seemed to be seriously considering what he’d said. Zu An stared at her for a moment before giving one last push. “Since you have chosen to marry me, you should believe in me a little.”

Those words seemed to strike a chord in Chu Chuyan’s heart. She had the strangest sensation that there was something different about this Zu An, compared to how he was before. Hm? Why would I have such a ridiculous feeling?

Snow interrupted her thoughts, tiptoeing to whisper into Chu Chuyan’s ears. “Young miss, I think that fellow is determined to enter the casino and gamble. Even if you refuse him now, he’ll only come by alone later on. Why don’t you let him use up his money under your watch, so that he’ll drop whatever thoughts he has about buying a house and acquiring a couple of beautiful maids outside?”

Chu Chuyan nodded in agreement. Snow’s suggestion was an insightful one. If Zu An were to use his money to buy a house outside and fill it with pretty maids, what would become of the Chu clan’s reputation?

No wonder they said that men mustn’t be spoilt with money.

“Fine, I’ll allow it this once. However, I expect you to leave with me once you spend all of your money. If not, I won’t hesitate to resort to force,” Chu Chuyan said calmly.

Zu An blushed in embarrassment as he gave her a level look. “You don’t need to resort to force. You can do whatever you want to do with me; I won’t resist at all.”

Chu Chuyan sniffed in response. This fellow always fools around like this.

Just as they were about to enter the casino, Snow suddenly clutched her stomach and gave a loud cry. Chu Chuyan turned to her with concern. “What’s wrong?”

Snow, her cheeks red, walked over to Chu Chuyan’s side and whispered softly to her. After which, Chu Chuyan nodded in response and instructed her, “Go ahead. Come back and look for us once you’re done.”

“Alright. Thank you, young miss.”

Watching as Snow hurried off, Zu An turned to Chu Chuyan and asked, “What’s wrong with her?”

Chu Chuyan glared at him impatiently. “It’s a matter for women only. Don’t even try to pry into it.”

“Alright alright, I won’t pry into it,” Zu An replied with a leisurely smile. He could pretty much guess it, even if Chu Chuyan wouldn’t explain it out loud.

The two of them entered the casino, and soon became the center of attention, drawing the gazes of everyone inside. Chu Chuyan’s outstanding appearance made it impossible to be discreet. Her flawless face, graceful silhouette, and impeccable disposition stood in stark contrast to the crude bustle in the casino.

The men who frequented the casinos tended to be boorish, and Chu Chuyan’s beautiful appearance fanned the flames of their lust. Some of them even began directing catcalls at her.

However, there were many who clearly recognized who she was, and swiftly put an end to their companions’ foolishness.

“Are you tired of living? That’s the First Miss of the Chu clan!”

“Woah, she’s so pretty! Who’s that cocky fellow standing beside her, then?”

“He must be the husband of the Chu First Miss, that wastrel son-in-law.”

“He does look pretty average to me. How did he ever win her fancy?”

“I wonder too. He looks pretty ordinary, although just a little more handsome, and with more delicate features. That kind of man can’t be relied on! If I have to say, masculine men like me are the best!”

“Goddamnit! That lucky son of a bitch!”

...

Zu An was roundly detested by all those in the casino, but he was more than happy to accept their offerings of Rage points. Going on frequent walks in public with his wife seemed a sound strategy. With it, he would never have to worry about a lack of Rage points.

If Chu Chuyan had been privy to his current thoughts, she would have worn through her kindness and patience, and pummeled him until his cheeks were swollen like a pig’s. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Chu First Miss, what brings you here today?”

The manager of the casino was Plum Blossom Seven. As soon as he’d received news of Chu First Miss’ arrival, he had rushed out to welcome her, a professional businessman’s smile masking his uneasiness at her presence.

Is she here to deal with the Plum Blossom Sect? I’ve already sent my men to inform the sect master about it, but heaven knows whether he’ll make it in time or not.

He knew that he didn’t have the means to deal with a rank five cultivator. Moreover, she was the First Miss of the Chu clan as well, which meant that he had to be careful not to insult her. This was a problem far beyond his means to deal with!

Chu Chuyan was clearly unused to such a rowdy and crude atmosphere. She used a hand to fan away the smoke lingering in front of her. “You need not pay any heed to me. I’m accompanying him today.”

It was only then that Plum Blossom Seven noticed Zu An. Then again, who would have bothered with a perfectly ordinary man when there was such a gorgeous woman standing before them?

“Oh, so it’s young master Zu! May I know what business you have with us today?”

Plum Blossom Seven kept his fake smile plastered on his face as he silently cursed Zu An. This fellow was known to be a wastrel who was inept in both academics and martial arts, and had only succeeded in life because of his looks.

In the past, this sort of man would have been beneath his notice, but right now, he actually had to force a smile and speak politely to him. Damn it, I want to mooch off a woman too!

You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for 200 Rage points!

Having received Plum Blossom Seven’s offering, Zu An’s lips curved upwards. “Are you cursing me in your mind right now?”

Plum Blossom Seven’s heart skipped a beat, and he beat out a hasty denial. “No no, of course not. You’re the young master of the Chu clan. How would I dare do something so disrespectful to you?”

There was no missing Plum Blossom Seven’s implication that, if not for his status, Zu An would have been treated as worse than trash.

Plum Blossom Seven noticed Zu An’s gaze wandering around the casino, and tried to probe his intentions. “Young master Zu, may I know what brings you here today?”

“What other reason would I be here for other than to gamble? Do you think that I would come here to eat?” Zu An replied impatiently.

Plum Blossom Seven clicked his tongue quietly. You’re only putting on a smug act because you’re faring well now. Would you have dared to talk to me in such a manner in the past, huh?

You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for 300 Rage points!

Wait a moment, he’s here to gamble?

Realization suddenly struck Plum Blossom Seven, and he turned to look at Chu Chuyan in disbelief. Am I hearing things? A member of the Chu clan is here to gamble, and he even brought Chu First Miss with him?

Chu Chuyan remarked nonchalantly, “Like I said, I’m only here to accompany him. You need not look at me.”

Plum Blossom Seven quickly turned back to Zu An. “You said that you’re here to gamble?”

“Are you that deaf that I need to repeat myself again?” Zu An looked at Plum Blossom Seven in disdain. “Why? Don’t you welcome me here?”

You have successfully trolled Plum Blossom Seven for 99 Rage points!

Plum Blossom Seven’s instinctive rage was quickly replaced by frenzied joy. “Of course not! We welcome you with open arms! Come, invite young master Zu to the VIP room!”

He knew that the sect master had tasked Plum Blossom Thirteen to deal with Zu An, but not only had he ended up losing the promissory note, he’d even gotten his legs fractured. However, since the one responsible was none other than Lu De from Brightmoon Academy, the sect couldn’t exact vengeance.

Similarly, Zu An was the young master of the Chu clan and a student of Brightmoon Academy. Without suitable justification, the Plum Blossom Sect couldn’t afford to lay hands on him. They’d been at a loss as to what to do, yet at a moment like this, this fellow had walked right through their door!

You’re here to gamble? Hah! You must not know what kind of place this casino is! Even if your family is loaded, we’re still able to make you lose everything within a single night!

Everyone knew that Chu clan forbade its clan members from gambling, and Brightmoon Academy had their own rules against it as well. While Plum Blossom Seven had no idea what the Chu First Miss was doing here, their casino had plenty of tricks up to ensure that Zu An incurred an overwhelming debt.

By then, they just had to announce it all over town, and it would be all over for Zu An. Without the protection of the Chu clan and the academy, the Plum Blossom Sect would be able to do as they pleased to him!

Nay, Brother Thirteen would probably want Zu An all to himself.

He wouldn’t have sent his men to inform the sect master, if only he’d known beforehand that their appearance here was nothing major. It would have been much better to wait for Zu An to be drowning in debt before reporting his accomplishments to the sect master.

Zu An raised his hand to forestall Plum Blossom Seven. “There’s no need for the VIP room. I enjoy the bustle out here.” His plan needed plenty of people around as witnesses. The cold and empty VIP room simply wouldn’t do.

Meanwhile, at the main headquarters of the Plum Blossom Sect, a gathering of sect members stood respectfully before a green-robed woman.

“Miss Qiao, what brings you here today?”

If Zu An had been there, he would have surely recognized the green-robed woman as none other than Snow.

A woman hid frantically in a corner, holding up pieces of clothing to cover her naked body. Snow glanced at her and remarked coldly, “There should be a limit to just how lustful you are. You keep her by your side despite having killed her husband; aren’t you afraid of vengeance?”

That woman was the wife of Tan Wei, who had met his end at the hands of Plum Blossom Twelve.

Mei Chaofeng burst into hearty laughter. “You’re thinking too much, Miss Qiao. I have already conquered both her body and her heart!”

The woman lowered her head further, seemingly embarrassed at Mei Chaofeng’s words.

Snow’s forehead furrowed in disgust. “I’m here to inform you that Zu An is at Silverhook Casino right now.”

Mei Chaofeng was stunned. “What’s he doing at the casino?”

“Your brain must have been dulled from lust.” Snow’s expression was disdainful. “He’s at the casino to gamble, of course.”

Her insult stoked Mei Chaofeng’s wrath. If not for the fact that the young master favors you and gave you the Anyang Token, I would have surely toyed with you until your legs wouldn’t close!

His face remained a calm mask. “That Zu An is nothing more than a fool. He lost a thousand silver taels to us the last time around, and yet he still hasn’t learned from his lesson?”

Snow gave a slight shake of her head. “You shouldn’t get careless. Based on what I’ve heard, it seems like he’s pretty confident this time around. He said that he’s here not to gamble but to withdraw money.”

“Hahahaha!” Mei Chaofeng’s laughter was so great that even the tiles on the roof shook. “Just what kind of place does he take our Silverhook Casino to be? No matter how much money he has, I have the means to make him lose it all!”

Snow, however, was unimpressed by how lightly he was taking this matter.

“It’s still best for you to be careful. He seems different than before. I can’t put my finger on it, but since he dared to boast before Chu Chuyan, I reckon that he has some plan in mind.”

Mei Chaofeng shook his head.

“Miss Qiao, you’re only saying all of this because you’re unfamiliar with how the casino works. Those who have lost big in the casino tend to suffer from what we call the Gambler’s Fallacy. They believe that, having lost so much money, their luck will somehow turn around if they keep playing. However, all of them eventually end up losing everything they have, including their wives!”
