Chapter 1521: Key Upgrade Materials

“Divine weapon?” Zu An repeated, stunned. Even though the Tai’e Sword had always been extraordinary, apart from being extremely tough, only its domain ability was special. That power had been really useful in the beginning, but eventually, as the cultivation of his enemies grew greater and greater, the usefulness of its pressure had become more and more dubious.

It was definitely at the level of a heaven-grade weapon, but if one were to call it deity-grade, then it didn’t really fit the description. It wouldn’t even be good enough to call an immortal-grade weapon.

Mi Li harrumphed when she saw his expression. “What does an ignorant kid like you know? The Tai’e Sword is the sword of the son of heaven, reaching into the skies above and reaching the earth below. When this sword makes an appearance, all under the heavens must submit. It was naturally a genuine deity-grade weapon, but due to the corrosion of time and the seals that were placed on it, it fell to its current heaven-grade.”

Zu An thought that made sense. He couldn't help but ask something else that had been puzzling him, though. “Sealed? Who sealed it?”

“It was probably Ying Zheng. He hated me in the past, and the Tai’e Sword was even the Chu State’s divine sword. He was worried that I would use the Tai’e Sword, which was why he placed a seal on it,” Mi Li replied.

“Probably?” Zu An asked with a weird look. “You’re not even sure about such an important thing?”

Mi Li’s expression became a bit strange. She replied, “I don’t know. I feel as if some of my memories are a bit blurry, and recently, I seem to have awakened some other memories…”

“What memories?” Zu An quickly asked.

Mi Li’s face reddened. She snapped, “It has nothing to do with you! Right, greet me as your master again.”

Zu An was speechless. This woman really is fickle. But why does she like hearing me call her master so much?

Still, he didn’t mind, and called her ‘master’ again as requested. Mi Li beamed with joy and murmured, “One day… It will definitely be interesting.”

“When did you become the type for riddles?” Zu An muttered, really speechless.

“Okay, okay,” Mi Li said, putting away her smile. “Let’s use this chance to repair and upgrade the Tai’e Sword.”

Zu An nodded. The other heaven-grade ores were already gradually melting inside the big cauldron. The White Lotus Flame had also begun burning more fiercely. Strong ki filled the room.

He placed the Tai’e Sword inside the big cauldron while controlling the White Lotus Flame. He covered the cauldron while asking worriedly, “You live inside. Won’t the flames affect you?”

“It will affect me a bit,” Mi Li said with a nod. “But my soul isn’t inside the sword right now, so it shouldn’t be too great.”

“Then I’ll do my best to be gentle, or else you’ll be affected,” Zu An replied. He began to adjust the fire afterward. The White Lotus Flame in the cauldron visibly became weaker.

“No,” Mi Li said, quickly stopping him. “How can the refinement of a divine weapon be so easy? Not even your White Lotus Flame is guaranteed to be strong enough, and it needs the assistance of the Meteor Spark Pills, so how can you choose to lower the temperature?”

Zu An also understood that principle. He replied, “Then, if you can’t take it, let me know. Compared to a divine weapon, I care more about your safety.”

“I know that already,” Mi Li said with a hint of a gentle expression in her eyes. How many people could refuse the temptation of a divine weapon? If it were someone else with an ambitious and faulty character, they wouldn’t necessarily care about her if they could create a deity-grade weapon.

Then, Zu An activated the Forging System. He discovered that it was really intuitive. Even if one knew nothing about forging, it didn’t matter. It was enough as long as one controlled the fire’s output.

There was something similar to a speedometer above the cauldron, with a certain range in the center that shone with light. That range moved constantly. As long as one controlled the fire’s strength to keep the needle within the region, that was good, because it meant that the fire was at a suitable level. The range moved very quickly, and the needle was very sensitive. Just a slight bit of carelessness would make it leave the optimal region. Its sensitivity was so high that it was a task completely impossible for ordinary cultivators.

Fortunately, Zu An grasped every strand of ki very carefully. As such, he was able to just barely keep the fire within the right range. Even so, it was still really strenuous. He didn’t dare to show any carelessness.

The heaven-grade ores gradually turned into scarlet liquid that poured onto the Tai’e Sword. Soon, the Tai’e Sword became like a black hole, absorbing the scarlet liquid.

Mi Li’s beautiful brows furrowed. She took a few steps back to avoid Zu An’s gaze. Then, she secretly tugged on her collar, while her other hand gently fanned her neck. Even though her soul was outside, the Tai’e Sword was still where she was rooted. She could still feel waves of heat.

The process continued for a while, before Zu An heard a ‘Ding!’ He was overjoyed, quickly turning around to Mi Li to announce the good news. “It’s already been successfully repaired, beautiful… master…”

Mi Li awkwardly tightened her collar before replying, “Then throw the Calamity Gold in. Use this chance to see if you can return it to its former glory.”

“Oh, alright,” Zu An said, then threw the incomparably precious Calamity Gold into the large cauldron. He didn’t even give it another look, and instead turned around to look at Mi Li, asking, “What are you doing?”

“It’s a bit hot. Can’t I fan myself?” Mi Li replied, shooting him a look.

“Of course you can,” Zu An said, finally realizing what was happening. In a sense, the Tai’e Sword was also Mi Li’s body. Now that it was being cooked like this, it would be weirder if she didn’t feel hot.

A scene suddenly appeared in his mind. Mi Li couldn't take it anymore, and she removed all her clothes…

“Just what kind of nonsense are you thinking for there to be that disgusting smile on your face?” Mi Li asked suspiciously.

“What? I wasn’t, I didn’t! You can’t just say whatever you want!” Zu An quickly refuted her three times. At the same time, he felt a bit weird. Wasn’t he in good condition right now? Why did he still have so many strange thoughts?

At the same time, he felt the ki within him become very restless. However, he just attributed it to being like that because he had been controlling the White Lotus Flame, so he didn’t pay too much attention to it.

“From now on, you’re not allowed to look behind you,” Mi Li harrumphed. She knew that once the divine weapon was being refined, the temperature would grow much, much hotter. She would have to focus on neutralizing the heat, and that meant she would need to open her collar further to help dissipate the heat.

“Understood!” Zu An immediately replied. Inwardly, he thought, But I can still see with my divine sense.

As if guessing his thoughts, Mi Li continued, “Normally, one needs to have earth immortal rank cultivation in order to have a chance of refining a deity-grade weapon. Even though your current cultivation isn’t bad, you’re still far from the correct condition. Fortunately, the Tai’e Sword was a divine weapon to begin with, so you only need to restore it to its former glory. The difficulty is much lower than forging a completely new divine weapon.

“Even so, it shouldn’t be something someone of your level should be able to accomplish. Fortunately, you have this strange, large cauldron that can lend you a helping hand. But you still need to be a hundred and twenty percent focused. Everything will be for nothing if you end up making a mistake.”

Zu An nodded. He knew that if he had been really tensed up earlier, the difficulty would only have been even higher. If he got distracted and looked behind him, the entire process could result in failure.

Seeing as he had heard her message, Mi Li calmed down and said, “Then you should hurry and begin.”

Zu An nodded. He activated the White Lotus Flame, sending the heat toward the Calamity Gold. However, as Calamity Gold was one of the world’s most unique treasures, it actually didn’t react at all.

Under Mi Li’s instruction, he put in the Meteor Spark Stones one after another. The White Lotus Flame’s power immediately climbed considerably. It was thanks to the forging system’s great cauldron being special; otherwise, there wouldn’t necessarily be any furnace in this world that could endure such crazy power.CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

…

The process continued for a while before the Calamity Gold Finally began to show signs of melting. Strands of golden energy that contained natural laws were guided toward the Tai’e Sword at the very center by the big cauldron.

The Tai’e Sword absorbed the wispy golden threads, and its entire body began to gradually release a layer of brilliant light. As it absorbed more golden threads, sparkling radiance began to flow along the surface of the sword’s body.

Suddenly, a voice called out in Zu An’s head.

The system has detected that the forged weapon can be upgraded to immortal-grade. The required materials are True Dragon Blood, True Dragon Bones, and Breath of Rulers from the Lion or Tiger race. Would you like to continue with the upgrade?
