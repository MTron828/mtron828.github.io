Chapter 1482: You Just Had to Go for the Mental Blow Too?

“Flying swords?” Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue exclaimed in surprise.

Upon reaching the highest level of the grandmaster rank and cultivating a yin soul, a cultivator could attach that yin soul to a flying sword and use it to kill even from a thousand miles away. At their cultivation rank, the two grandmasters could use the flying sword skill, but their range was limited. It wouldn’t be as effective even a moderate distance away.

However, Zu An was clearly at the beginning of the master rank. At his current level, he was still cultivating the hero form. He hadn’t even finished a single one of the seven forms and was far, far away from the three souls’ life soul. And yet, he could control a flying sword a thousand miles away?

How could they know that there was a radar diagram in Zu An’s mind? It was likely because he had materialized the complete Dongfeng-17 system, and the radar was a necessary component in order to truly make use of the missiles. As such, he had simply locked onto the Fiend Emperor using the radar. The remaining 17 Dongfeng-17 missiles followed the Fiend Emperor on their own.

A thousand miles away, the air rippled and the Fiend Emperor reappeared. However, unlike his usual confident and arrogant demeanor, he was battered and exhausted. His yellow robes were in tatters, making him look like a common roadside beggar.

No, he was even worse off than a beggar at the moment. His clothes were filled with holes, and blood dripped out of them; he had clearly been injured quite badly.

In truth, he had just barely managed to move out of the way. Even though he had avoided the nuclear warhead’s explosion, he couldn’t completely avoid getting hurt. He shivered inwardly when he recalled what had just happened.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

What were those flaming arrows? Why did they have such destructive power?

If he hadn’t been an earth immortal who could control space, he might have just perished right there and then.

That brat Zu An was clearly only at the master rank. Normally, there should have been no way for him to have such terrifying offensive methods, right? The Fiend Emperor was shocked, unable to understand the situation.

He looked in the direction of where he had just been and sneered, remarking to himself, “Even though I do not know how he did it, master rank is just master rank in the end. I instantly moved a thousand miles away. What can he do to me now?”

For some reason, however, he still felt a strong sense of unease. He didn’t ignore the feeling; at the earth immortal rank, one’s sixth sense was no longer imaginary, but rather a source of true premonitions.

“I feel as if this place is still a bit unsafe,” he muttered, leaping through space again as soon as he spoke. Only after moving three thousand miles away did he feel a bit at ease.

“Hmph. I am already four thousand miles away. Can he still do anything to me?” he muttered. After recovering from his earlier shock, he had regained his usual domineering nature.

The Fiend Emperor figured Zu An would definitely have had to pay a great price for using such a terrifying weapon. There was no reason to face him head on. As such, he planned to avoid Zu An for the time being, only returning to deal with him once he was overcome with weakness.

At that instant, he felt a bit of regret. If he hadn’t pushed so far and had just headed to Spirit Mountain to look for the immortal medicine, he wouldn’t have been forced into his current state. As soon as that thought emerged, however, he was overcome with rage.

Who was he? He was the Fiend Emperor who inspired fear and awe throughout the world! He had remained unmatched for so many years, and yet today, he had actually been forced to use real tactics by a young brat!

Zu An had been able to reach the master rank at such a young age, and his strength even exceeded the normal limits of the master rank. It was to the point that he even posed a threat to the Fiend Emperor. What would happen if he were allowed to properly grow up?

I have to end him now!

Killing intent appeared in the Fiend Emperor’s eyes as he concluded that he definitely had to erase Zu An from the world.

Suddenly, he sensed something. He reflexively raised his head. He saw several specks of light suddenly appear in the air.

“Shooting stars?” he exclaimed in surprise, which gave way to puzzlement. How were there shooting stars in the daytime?

Eventually, however, he saw what the shining things were, and he was filled with horror. They were none other than the ‘arrows’ that had a trail of fire behind them! He tried to flee, but the ‘arrows’ were simply too fast, arriving next to him almost instantly. How could he know that in the world they came from, Dongfeng-17s could reach Mach 10, or ten times the speed of sound? He no longer had any time to dodge.

The Fiend Emperor’s entire body erupted with powerful energy as he clashed directly with the missiles. An enormous Golden Crow image appeared behind him, its golden wings shining with light, and endless streams of golden sword ki flew forth. His body was set ablaze with Golden Crow Sacred Fire, so intense it almost seemed solid; it encased him in a golden barrier of light.

Just then, the Dongfeng-17s struck him.

Boom!

All 17 missiles exploded at once, creating a mushroom cloud countless times larger than before. The harsh, blinding light was visible even from a thousand miles away. The enormous blast waves quickly swept through everything in the vicinity. The nearby plants and trees were vaporized on the spot, and even the hardest rocks melted into lava.

The entire world trembled. People and intelligent monsters alike felt indescribably shaken. Such terrifying eruptions had already happened several times in succession today. Could it be the very end of the world?

Zu An quickly drove the Golden War Chariot close to the site of the explosion. He warned the three women ahead of time, “All of you need to protect yourselves with your skills. Otherwise, the substances in the air will harm you, making you wish you were dead instead.”

“Is it really that serious? The explosion has already ended!” Yun Jianyue replied skeptically.

“Even though the explosion has ended, the area still contains powerful radiation… Ahem, you may be wondering what radiation is. It’s hard for me to explain it to you in a short amount of time. Suffice to say that it’s invisible, but causes harmful changes to the body, resulting in a disease no medicine can cure,” Zu An explained. He thought for a bit, then added, “On top of that, your future children might end up becoming deformed too.”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “As if there’s any man in this world who could make me bear a child for him!”

Yan Xuehen’s expression became unnatural as she said, “I will do no such thing either.”

Despite their protests, they couldn't help but look at Yu Yanluo, each adding a layer of protection around the chariot.

Naturally, high-level cultivators had a defensive membrane around them to begin with. Furthermore, the Golden War Chariot had powerful defenses. Consequently, Zu An wasn’t all that worried about the radiation anymore.

The Golden War Chariot arrived in the air above the explosion site. It has already been some time, and yet extreme heat continued to surge. Fortunately, both Zu An’s party and the chariot were powerful enough to endure it.

As the thick smoke and dust gradually dissipated, they saw a massive crater below; it was clearly the aftermath of the nuclear explosion. It was countless times larger than the previous crater.

“The Fiend Emperor couldn’t have survived this, could he?” Yu Yanluo asked, her voice shaking a bit. The explosion’s power had really scared her badly. Let alone her, even Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue had never before witnessed any weapon with such destructive force.

Zu An didn’t reply. Through the radar, he had sensed that the Fiend Emperor was caught off guard and didn’t have time to escape. However, the Fiend Emperor was just too strong; Zu An couldn’t be certain he had successfully killed his opponent.

If the Fiend Emperor was alive, Zu An had to see him; if he was dead, Zu An had to see the corpse. Otherwise, it would be impossible to feel at ease. However, at the center of a nuclear explosion, even a corpse would be burned to ashes, right?

Zu An quickly realized he was overthinking things, as he saw a figure slowly crawl out from the surging smoke and dust. The group felt nervous. Could the Fiend Emperor even survive something like this?

When the smoke cleared a bit, they finally saw that it was indeed the Fiend Emperor. However, he was in pitiful condition. Every hair on his body, as well as his clothes, had already turned into scattered ash. However, the women didn’t see anything offensive of ‘that’ sort, as the Fiend Emperor was barely recognizable.

Half of his body was missing, revealing bones sticking out of the remaining half, with a few strips of bloodied flesh attached. He looked like a rack of pork ribs, the sort that hung in the meat shops of Zu An’s previous world. The difference was that his body was bloody in places, but charred in others. Apart from the bits of flesh that remained, he was almost more skeleton than man. His inner organs were also a mess. Only his heart seemed to still be in good shape, still throbbing weakly.

The Fiend Emperor looked up at Zu An. The brain that peeked out of his half-skeletal head looked extremely horrific.

“Hahahah, the power of your attack was indeed great. However, you were still unable to kill me. Once I recover, I will definitely reduce you to ashes. I will throw all the women around you into brothels to serve as prostitutes. Every single person with any connection to you will wish they were dead!” the Fiend Emperor snarled. However, as his tongue was already destroyed, he used his consciousness to speak directly to Zu An’s group instead.

You have successfully trolled the Fiend Emperor for +1024 +1024 +1024…

His words were truly disgusting. However, there was no other way for him to vent the hatred and anger he felt. After all, he was the glorious Fiend Emperor of this generation! Apart from Zhao Han, who could just about match him, he was unrivaled in this world. And yet, right now, he had been tormented badly by an ant.

He really had been a bit too careless this time. He hadn’t expected the flaming ‘arrows’ to be able to hit him from several thousand miles away. Now that he was prepared, he wouldn’t give Zu An another chance.

Yan Xuehen’s expression changed. She said, “Oh no. The Golden Crow Sacred Fire has extremely powerful healing abilities. If he escapes, we will not be able to find him again.”

Yun Jianyue added nervously, “Hurry and stop him!”

Unfortunately, she knew that was wishful thinking. Forget about the fact that they had already used up all of their strength; even if they were at their strongest, they still wouldn’t have been able to stop him. Earth immortals could cross space in an instant. How were they supposed to do that?

Sure enough, ripples began to appear behind the Fiend Emperor; they were clearly about to send him away. This time, Zu An could no longer materialize his weapons, and had no way of knowing where the Fiend Emperor was going.

Suddenly, however, Zu An said, “Fiend Emperor, I forgot to tell you a secret.”

“What secret?” the Fiend Emperor replied. He knew Zu An was definitely up to something, but he still couldn't help but ask. Of course, however, he wasn’t stupid. Half of his body was already within the void. A second later, he would be transported away, so he wasn’t scared of Zu An pulling any tricks.

“That secret is…” A strange expression appeared on Zu An’s face as he exclaimed, “Your wife really is great!”

He immediately used the Goldensnake King’s Eye. However, he was worried that it still wouldn’t be strong enough, so he also activated Fragrant Barf at the same time.
