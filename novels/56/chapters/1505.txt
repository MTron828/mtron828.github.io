Chapter 1454: Exactly the Same

“Where is Nanchao?” Zu An tried to ask, but Shun had already disappeared without a trace. He and the others were speechless for a moment.

“Hurry and take a look. There seems to be a map here,” Yan Xuehen called out after a while. It turned out she had already gone inside and looked around the old tomb.

Zu An’s group quickly followed her in. As an emperor, Shun’s tomb should have been extremely large. However, when they went inside, they only saw an ordinary throne room. There were many burial objects inside, but unfortunately, they had already all decayed under the ravages of time.

Yan Xuehen was by the coffin. There was no corpse inside, as if Shun had never existed. Zu An even wondered whether that guy hadn’t actually died.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Meanwhile, Yan Xuehen was staring at a diagram on the surface of the coffin. Compared to the other items in the throne room that seemed to have been eroded by time, the simple and crude drawing looked quite new, as if it had been drawn not too long ago.

There were some characters the three women didn’t recognize. However, Zu An knew they were ancient names. He read them out. He had never heard of some of them before; others, he had. They were likely the locations of places in this world.

Furthermore, there was an area that had been circled, and in it were written the characters for ‘Nanchao’.

When she heard ‘Nanchao’, Yan Xuehen said, “This map was probably drawn by Shun not too long ago. After the world changed, he might have been worried that he would not last until we could find him and left behind these clues. They indeed turned out to be useful after all.”

Yu Yanluo sighed in relief when she heard that there was hope of undoing Zu An’s Puppet Curse. A faint smile appeared on her beautiful face as she said, “It seems this Shun can be considered a good person after all.”

“What good person?” Yun Jianyue sneered. “That guy didn’t even do what he promised us. What about the immortal medicine? He didn’t say a thing. With Little An’s Puppet Curse, he even made us run around some more. We don’t even know if it can be fixed.”

The others felt a bit dejected. The possibility of that was indeed substantial.

However, Zu An was more optimistic. He replied, “Haha, at least we have some clues, right? Besides, we’ve obtained quite a bit of information regarding the immortal medicine. But now that heaven and earth have become separated, the immortal medicine has nothing to do with us anymore. There’s no need to think too much about it.”

Seeing that he wasn’t discouraged, Yun Jianyue sighed in relief, saying, “That makes sense.”

Then, they set out again, seeking out Nanchao according to the instructions on the map. Along the way, the women talked about the ‘paths of heaven and earth’ issue.

Yun Jianyue said, “At first, I thought that the paths of heaven and earth were tangible roads, but from the situation we witnessed in Spirit Mountain and our experiences, that doesn’t seem to be the case.”

“I feel as if the world instantly split onto two…” Yan Xuehen added. She began to discuss all sorts of possibilities with Yun Jianyue.

Yu Yanluo continued to nod with a smile. She had been able to understand what they were saying at first, but eventually, their conversation grew more and more profound. She could only pretend to understand. She really didn’t know what they were talking about at all, which left her bewildered.

Meanwhile, Zu An used some theories from the movies and games in his previous world to compare notes with them. Sure enough, the beauties were incredibly shocked, feeling that his descriptions were quite fitting. They felt even more admiration toward him.

Even though this guy is a bit perverted and acts a bit shameless, I didn’t expect his knowledge to be so extraordinary…

Zu An sighed inwardly. No wonder the emperors of his previous world all loved to call themselves sons of heaven. He had felt that it was nothing more than feudalistic superstition, something they used so that monarchical power had a greater hold on the people. Now, it seemed they hadn’t been lying.

Whether it was the White Emperor faction’s Yao or the Black Emperor’s Shun and Yu, they were indeed the descendants of a Celestial Emperor in the mortal world. The emperors of Xia, Shang, Zhou, and even Qin could more or less have their lineage traced back to those bloodlines. That was why calling themselves sons of heaven wasn’t a problem at all. The emperors who followed had naturally continued using that title too.

…

Just like that, the group followed the map and found Nanchao. It was covered in mountains and lakes, a land of verdant hills and limpid waters. The group wandered leisurely through the place for half a day, but they didn’t find anything.

“What was Shun talking about? Are we supposed to find some kind of treasure in Nanchao? Or is it some monster that can help us undo the Puppet Curse?” Yun Jianyue remarked impatiently. Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo were also confused. They didn’t have any ideas either.

However, Zu An thought of something. He remembered where he had heard the name before. As such, he summoned Mo Xi. Wasn’t one of her skills named ‘Farewell, Nanchao’?

A wild, tan-skinned beauty dressed in leather appeared. Her exposed abdominal muscles, as well as her long and healthy legs, left even the other three beauties amazed.

Yan Xuehen’s heart began beating crazily. Why had Zu An suddenly summoned Mo Xi? Previously, in order to deal with Love Is More Solid than Gold, Zu An had shown her the summoned woman before.

Yun Jianyue wasn’t all that surprised, as she had seen Daji previously. She thought, This guy really is a pervert. Even his summoned creatures are such stunning beauties. Sigh, I really am feeling worried for my silly disciple’s future.

Yu Yanluo and Zu An were closer, so she naturally wasn’t that shocked. She was just curious as to why he had suddenly summoned her.

Zu An didn’t explain anything, though. Instead, he stared at Mo Xi.

Mo Xi was a bit stunned at first, but when she saw her surroundings, she subconsciously tilted her head to one side, looking confused. She seemed to have recalled something. Then, without even communicating anything, she walked toward a specific part of the mountain.

“Follow her!” Zu An called out, waving at the three women to quietly follow her.

Mo Xi walked slowly at first, but eventually, she began moving faster and faster. She leaped through the forest like a beautiful leopard. Fortunately, Zu An and the others had recovered quite a bit along the way, so they weren’t left behind. Just like that, the group followed her through several twists and turns in the forest.

Suddenly, the view opened up, revealing a valley filled with birdsong and fragrant flowers. They sighed in amazement. The ki within was almost on par with the time before the path of heaven and earth had been severed.

Strange sounds came from behind them. They sounded a bit unpleasant, but not to the point that they were extremely shrill and irritating. There even seemed to be a bit of rhythm behind them.

“This is?” Yun Jianyue exclaimed. She felt that the sound was a bit familiar, but she just couldn't place what it was. Yu Yanluo and Yan Xuehen clearly shared similar thoughts. They had confused expressions.

“It’s the sound of silk being torn,” Zu An said. He looked in the direction of Mo Xi, thinking, Is it really as I suspected?

Soon afterward, Mo Xi entered the valley. In it was a pavilion with rainbow silk draped all around it. It was as if they had entered a cloth dyeing store. Meanwhile, at the center of the pavilion was an exceptional beauty.

With their cultivation, the group quickly saw what the woman was doing. She was tearing up silk right next to her ear. As she listened to the tearing sound, a hint of joy appeared on her face. There were large amounts of cloth fragments scattered around her.

The three women thought, This woman must have gone mad. She’s ripping up silk for fun? Who in their right mind would do something like this?

However, their bodies suddenly stiffened. A chill ran down their backs as they finally recognized the woman’s appearance.

She was actually the same as Zu An’s Mo Xi!
