Chapter 1500: I’m Worried That You’ll Just Die

Shi Zhentian was furious. Not only had he almost failed to guard the gates, he had even been laughed at by his old enemy. It was all that brat Zu An’s fault!

It was clearly the Second Empress leading the troops this time, but for some reason, all of his anger was directed at Zu An.

This brat is just too good at taunting people!

You have successfully trolled Shi Zhentian for +444 +444 +444…

When she heard his provocation, the Second Empress quickly grabbed Zu An’s arm, exclaiming, “Don’t be so reckless!” She worried that Zu An was still too young and hot-blooded, assuming he was acting based on emotions.

In the distance, Chi Wen was fighting while drenched in blood, feeling proud of himself. I just performed so many of the Ocean races’ incredible skills and defeated so many enemies! My handsome image must have left the Second Empress with a deep impression, right?

However, he didn’t want her to see that he really cared about that either, so he only secretly looked at the Second Empress out of the corner of his eye. And yet, the Second Empress wasn’t even looking at him at all. Instead, she was tugging on Zu An’s arm with a worried expression. Her eyes were filled with affection! Chi Wen immediately felt depressed.

Heavens, are you messing with me right now?! Sigh, throughout history, all those who have endless love like me have been destined for regret! It seems as if I won’t love again in this life of mine… Chi Wen thought, looking as if his parents had died or something.

The Lion race’s reinforcements and the Golden Crow Guards who had stayed behind with the Crown Prince all rushed to the top of the wall. They all aimed their rune-imbued crossbows at the people below.

Chi Wen was busy lamenting, so he didn’t immediately notice it.

Someone shouted from one side, “Be careful!” Then, a huge pile of vines wove together to form a web, blocking the shower of crossbow bolts.

Only then did Chi Wen realize that he had been saved. He reflexively turned around, saying, “Thank… you?”

When he saw Qiao Xueying’s slender and elegant figure under the moonlight glow, he suddenly felt as if beautiful music were playing in his ears. Oh no! It seems as if I’m able to love again!

“Oh, beautiful Elf Princess, please let me introduce myself…” he began, showing Qiao Xueying a smile that thought was handsome.

Unfortunately, Qiao Xueying cut him off before he could even finish, saying, “Introduce, my butt! Hurry and fight!”

Chi Wen’s smile immediately froze on his face. Why is this Elf Princess not warm at all?

Regardless, he thought, that only proved Qiao Xueying was straightforward in nature, and that she wasn’t the type of woman to put on airs. Ahhhh, I’m in love!

…

Just then, more reinforcements arrived from the Imperial Palace’s side. They seemed to be preparing an even more formidable defensive formation.

Yu Yanluo’s eyes shone with light. The Medusa’s Eye made the strong cultivators who had arrived slowly begin to petrify, their movements slowing down.

Chi Wen’s jaw practically dropped to the ground. He thought, The women around Zu An are all freaking violent! I should just stay a bit farther away from her…

Hmph, it’s still the Elf race’s princess who seems the most gentle and delicate.

Huh? Wait… the Elf Princess seemed to be really close to Zu An on the way here too…

Motherf… how the hell is this fair? Why do all of these beauties have something to do with him?

Princess Suolun used the chance the Medusa Queen provided to lead the Demon race into battle, breaking the enemy’s defensive points one after another. As she charged and moved around in the battle formation, her excellent figure gave off a stirring sense of beauty.

Chi Wen’s eyes lit up. People always say that Demon race women taste quite excellent, but I’ve never tried it before.

Hm… This Demon race Princess matches my tastes, whether it’s her face or her figure. I’ll pursue her then! There’s no way this woman has something to do with that bastard too, right?

Zu An didn’t notice the Rage points continuously coming from the little dragon in the backend. He looked up at Shi Zhentian indifferently, saying, “I’m just worried that if I get involved, you’ll lose your life immediately.”

“Huh?”

Shi Zhentian was stunned at first. Then, he doubled over with laughter. He was almost hurt by Yan Xuehen’s Snowflake Sword as a result, exclaiming, “Are you trying to make me die from laughter?”

Meanwhile, the brothers Shi Min, Shi Gong, and Shi Rong, also laughed in the midst of combat when they heard Zu An. Is there something wrong with this guy’s head? It’s one thing to win against us through schemes and craftiness, but you even dare to provoke our father?

Do you know who our father is? He’s one of the strongest experts among all the Fiend races!

He could kill you as easily as crushing an ant!

However, Zu An didn’t waste any more time with words and took out a bow. Then, an arrow that looked illusory appeared.

Shi Min sneered. “He was actually planning to mount a hidden attack! What a pity that he’s not at a high enough level. That bow and arrow won’t even be able to land a scratch on father.”

“Third brother is wise, as expected!” the two brothers next to him exclaimed, both giving him a thumbs up.

Only Shi Zhentian frowned as he floated in midair. He hadn't noticed anything at first, but then he had suddenly felt an uneasiness he couldn't really explain.

There’s no way I’m scared of that brat, right?

How is that possible?!

He wanted to laugh, but he couldn't. Suddenly, he remembered where he had seen that bow before. Isn’t that the freaking…

Just then, a brilliant streak of light flew toward him, making him think he had seen a shooting star. It was the first time he had seen a shooting star so close up… as well as the last time.

…

Shi Zhentian was full of regret.

Ever since the day he was born, life had always gone the way he wanted, with everyone around him worshiping and praising him. He had been publicly acknowledged to be the most outstanding genius of the last few centuries. There was even an ancient prophecy in the clan that claimed a golden lion would lead the Lion race to glory they had never experienced before.

People had always thought that he was the one the prophecy was talking about.

When he was little, he had already become the young king of the entire Lion race. He had been undefeated among his peers. He had even been able to beat up some kids older than him badly.

Whenever he went out to play in the wild, if he didn’t fall off a cliff, he had been captured by some big bird, or surrounded by ferocious beasts. However, he could always turn misfortune into fortune, falling into some bird’s nest or beast valley and obtaining various secret manuals, divine skills, and wondrous treasures… Compared to his fortuitous encounters, the opportunities found by juniors like Shi Ling and others amounted to nothing at all.

The older he grew, the stronger he grew as well, without end. Forget about people his age, even older generation experts weren’t a match for him. Thus, in order to gain battle experience, he had taken the initiative to separate himself from his father. He had begun to wander across the prairie.

He hadn’t been satisfied with friendly battles, because he knew his opponents would hold back some of their trump cards. The benefits he would gain from such fights would be limited. As such, he had only done one thing: Whenever he passed by a tribe, he stole the wife of the strongest person there.

The greatest grudges came from none other than murdering one’s father, or stealing one’s wife. Only that way could he make so many experts willing to fight him to the death. Such life and death struggles would truly decide who was stronger.

Of course, there was another reason why he had sought out such experts, which was that the women of strong cultivators were often the greatest beauties. Playing around with them really was quite fun.

Just like that, he had wandered the world for a few years, soon leaving all the experts of the prairie terror-stricken. At that point, he could no longer find worthy opponents anymore. As such, he had returned to the Lion King Court, then challenged his father.

After a great battle, the former Lion King had been killed in battle, and Shi Zhentian won. He had thus become the new Lion King.

That wasn’t particularly shocking for the Lion race, however. Changes of leadership among Lion Kings were often accompanied by bloody battles. Only then could they ensure that every Lion King was the strongest, thus bringing the entire race the greatest glory.

However, directly killing the Lion King like that still wasn’t that common. Most of the time, the former Lion King would just leave in disgrace upon realizing he wasn’t a match.

Of course, the Lion race didn’t have any concept of patricide. It had happened more than once or twice in history. That was why, even though it was a bit inappropriate, it had still been considered acceptable.

Then, Shi Zhentian had taken over his father’s harem. He hadn’t emerged from the imperial palace for three months after that. He soon discovered that during those three months, he felt even more tired than when he was fighting against strong experts outside. However, he had been happily tired. His father’s wives really were incredible; their taste really was quite excellent.

People in the Lion race were all used to it; every new Lion King did the same. On the prairie, women were precious strategic resources who could continuously give birth to later generations. In contrast, the human race neglected the wives of the former ruler. That merely seemed like a waste to them.

Thus, after decades of Shi Zhentian’s rule, he had unified the different Lion race tribes on the prairie and forced back the powerful Hyena race bit by bit. He soon expanded his territory there to the limit.

Afterward, however, he was no longer satisfied with the prairie, and thus aimed at the Fiend King Court. He wanted to seize even more benefits for the Lion race. Why were there only three king races, the Peacock, Great Peng, and Elf races, under the Fiend Emperor? The Lion race had every right to become a fourth King race, or to even be above the other king races!

The Golden Crow Crown Prince had recognized his great strength and ambition, so the two sides had hit it off. Shi Zhentian knew that after tonight, there would be a shuffling of the Fiend races’ power structure. The more chaotic the situation became, the more opportunities the Lion race would have.

The Peacock King race, Golden Peng King race, and Elf King race had remained powerful for too long. It was time for them to be replaced. That would bring a kind of glory the Lion race had never experienced before. However, he wasn’t satisfied with just that.

Who says the Fiend Emperor’s position has to be held by the Golden Crow race? Am I, Shi Zhentian, not fit to become the Fiend Emperor? he thought. However, the late Fiend Emperor had just been too strong, which temporarily suppressed his ambitions.

When he was told that the late Fiend Emperor had already died by the Golden Crow Crown Prince, he had been wild with joy. The heavens really are helping me!

No wonder I had so many miraculous encounters ever since I was young. I am a child blessed by fate!

The late Fiend Emperor died unexpectedly in the secret dungeon and wasn’t able to pass on his cultivation to the Golden Crow Crown Prince. Does that brat really think I’ll yield to him?

I’ll work with him to get rid of other powerful enemies first, but once I gain great authority, that will be a chance for me to become the new Fiend Emperor!

His plans were clearly perfect, so why had something unexpected happened?

This little monster Zu An, just where did he come from? Who the hell says he’s just reached the master rank?

Bullshit!

I have so many regreeeeets!

You have successfully trolled Shi Zhentian for +555 +555 +555…

Can I have just one more chance?

Unfortunately, his consciousness quickly plunged into endless darkness.

…

When the onlookers saw a lump of badly-mangled flesh fall from the air, a deep silence fell over the entire place. Many people rubbed their eyes in confusion, thinking that perhaps they were mistaken.

Some of them thought Shi Zhentian was just wounded. However, with a loud noise, his body broke into pieces from the fall.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience
