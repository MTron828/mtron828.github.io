Chapter 1607: Fortunes Rise and Fall

Zu An sighed and remarked, “Women need to pay more attention when they wear dresses, especially when they’re high up. You’re letting others see everything.”

Zhao Xiaodie was briefly distracted and instinctively pressed down on her dress. Then, she floated down like a butterfly and spat, “Bastard, you’re courting death!”Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What are you trying to accomplish here?” Zu An asked with a frown.

“Kneel and kowtow to this princess a hundred times. If my mood improves, who knows, I might just give you some antidote to alleviate your suffering,” Zhao Xiaodie said, a cruel smile appearing on her face.

She didn’t want to kill him that quickly, but if this guy wanted to get the antidote with just a hundred kowtows, that would be nothing short of delusion. First, she would use this method to destroy his self-respect. Once he began to kowtow, everything after would become much easier. She could just turn him into one of her dogs in that case.

Zu An said calmly, “If I recall correctly, yesterday should have been the first time we met. Why do you carry so much hostility against me?”

Zhao Xiaodie said with a sneer, “Only the weak would care about something like that, as if one needed a reason to act against them. But this princess’ mood today is quite good, so there’s no harm in telling you. You plotted against my big brother, and even wantonly destroyed my father emperor’s plans. Those things are already more than enough to offend me, and yet you still have the nerve to ask me why? I really never expected you to be so naive.”

“Plotted?” Zu An repeated, looking at her with a strange expression. Did this woman spend so much time in the mountains that her brain had turned to mush from cultivation?

Zhao Xiaodie got the impression that Zu An was looking down on her strength, making her unhappy. She said, “I understand my big brother’s aptitude best. Even though he wasted a lot of his energy on women and secular affairs, his cultivation definitely wasn’t something you could deal with. I really don’t know what kind of shameful and despicable methods you used to plot against him.”

As she continued to speak, she couldn't help but frown, asking, “Why aren’t you defending yourself?”

Zu An’s reaction was quite strange. Normally, he should have been rolling on the ground in pain after being affected by her poison. His composure left her with an uneasy feeling.

“Why do I have to defend myself?” Zu An replied nonchalantly. “I’m just calmly watching your strange performance.”

His calm demeanor made Zhao Xiaodie feel as if she were a clown. She erupted into a rage.

However, Zhao Xiaodie wasn’t stupid. She didn’t lose her head from anger. She calmly stared at Zu An, asking, “You weren’t poisoned? How is that possible?”

Even a master rank cultivator would be half-dead after being affected by her poison! Of course, a master rank wouldn’t let themselves be poisoned so easily.

Zu An looked at his finger. The wound on his fingertip had already healed. His Primordial Origin Sutra not only granted his body incredible regeneration prowess, but also had detoxification effects. At the very least, no poisons thus far had been able to do much to him.

When she saw him stand in place without moving, Zhao Xiaodie just assumed Zu An was pretending to be calm, but was actually secretly dealing with the poison. As such, she didn’t give him the chance to recover and rushed at him. If he started to fight and used his ki, it would become impossible to suppress the poison anymore.

What surprised her, however, was that he didn’t seem alarmed at all! Still, she wasn’t worried. She had always been a Heavenly Sorrow disciple with outstanding talent to begin with, second only to senior brother Zhi Yin. Wasn’t someone like this, without any ki fluctuations, extremely easy to deal with?

She raised her hand. Her red fingernails were even sharper than a blade. The red color came from a nail polish she had made by combining all sorts of poisonous flowers; it was both beautiful and deadly. Just like that, she brought her fingernail straight up to Zu An’s neck. She controlled her power perfectly; her strike was powerful enough to seriously injure him, while also preventing him from dying immediately.

When she saw Zu An raise his hand, she sneered. Is he only realizing that he needs to put up a defense now? It’s already too late! Such reaction speed was even lower than the ordinary disciples of her sect. She really didn’t know how that trash big brother of hers had lost to this guy.

After a moment, however, she was stunned. He had clearly just been in front of her, but she quickly lost track of him. In an instant, Zu An’s hand arrived first, despite only moving after hers. He grabbed her wrist, using her own momentum and twisting. A tremendous force overwhelmed Zhao Xiaodie, and she could no longer move her hand. Her body spun in a circle, and the sharp, bright fingernails she had aimed at Zu An now rushed toward her own neck.

Zhao Xiaodie’s pupils narrowed. Even she wouldn’t be able to deal with her own poison!

Pu!

Zu An felt his hand become empty. Zhao Xiaodie had disappeared, replaced with countless fluttering little butterflies. Soon afterward, the butterflies gathered again several zhang away, reforming into Zhao Xiaodie.

“Hm? How interesting!” Zu An remarked, feeling a bit of admiration toward the skill. Turning into butterflies to avoid an attack seemed pretty awesome.

Meanwhile, Zhao Xiaodie looked at him with extreme horror. She could no longer act complacent like a cat toying with a mouse. She exclaimed, “Just what is your cultivation realm?”

“I don’t know either,” Zu An replied in annoyance. Ever since the Rune Weapon Chart and the Heaven Devouring Sutra’s effects had merged, his cultivation system had become completely different from the norm. His current level of 70 didn’t tell him anything.

Zhao Xiaodie just assumed he was hiding the truth from her. She said with a sneer, “I admit that I did look down on you earlier. But I’m going to get serious now.”

She could sense a bit even from her powerful sect master. This Zu An probably cultivated some special method that hid his aura. There was no way he could be stronger than the sect master, right?

As soon as she spoke, her clothes rippled and she fluttered around Zu An like a butterfly. She remained on guard against his previous skill, not daring to rashly close the distance again. Instead, she planned to confuse him with a misleading movement skill and find an opportunity to take advantage of him. Her Rainbow Butterfly Steps skill was one that even her master praised. Naturally, it would be more than enough against this bastard.

“Hm? Why are there openings everywhere?” Zhao Xiaodie muttered in confusion. No matter how she looked at it, he seemed just like an ordinary person. So what had happened earlier?

After some hesitation, she clenched her teeth and attacked Zu An from behind. Either way, she could just transform into butterflies and escape, so she was in an invincible position.

Just then, Zu An’s hand moved again. Zhao Xiaodie jumped in fright. When she recalled what had just happened, she immediately turned into butterflies to protect herself and escape.

Suddenly, she saw a strange, large bird, and an invisible sound wave rippled outward. Her mind went blank. The butterflies looked as if they had been battered by a snowstorm and fell from the sky, scattering all over the ground. In the end, they combined back into her body.

When Zhao Xiaodie snapped out of her daze, she discovered that Zu An’s hand was already pressed against her shoulder’s major acupoint. She couldn't muster the slightest bit of ki anymore.

“Do you want to live?” Zu An asked next to her ear, sounding amused. Zhao Xiaodie was filled with grief and indignation. She hadn’t expected her own words to be returned to her so quickly!
