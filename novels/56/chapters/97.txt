Chapter 98: Promise

Translator: Pika

“Thanks to all this, our Chu clan has to tread carefully at the moment. We mustn’t show any openings for our enemies to strike.” Chu Chuyan’s voice betrayed more than a hint of worry.

She knew deep down that there was no way to continuously fend off the schemes directed against them. It was only a matter of time before they got careless and succumbed. However, there was no other choice but to persevere.

Zu An had his own doubts. “I don’t get it. Why do you insist on taking a neutral position? Wouldn’t it be better to choose a faction to side with? At the very least, you wouldn’t end up in this difficult position you’re currently in.”

Chu Chuyan shook her head and said, “The main issue here is that both factions are equally matched, and there’s no way to know which side would emerge the victor. If we pick the wrong faction to work with, our Chu clan would be left in dire straits. Maintaining our neutrality might put us in a difficult position for now, but it would work out better in the long run as long as we can hold on until the fight has been decided. The winning faction would need some time to recover, and would willingly embrace any non-hostile powers. At the very least, this would ensure the survival of our Chu clan.”

Zu An was amazed. Those who dabbled in politics were definitely on a whole different level. Even someone as honest as Chu Zhongtian was thinking several steps ahead.

Yup, I should be more careful. They’re all cunning old foxes! Hmmm, didn’t Pei Mianman sneak into the Chu clan to steal some accounting records a while back? I wonder which faction she’s from...

Their carriage came to a sudden halt. And the sounds of a commotion came from further ahead. With a frown, Chu Chuyan knocked on the side of the carriage and asked, “What’s happening outside?”

A guard of the Chu clan quickly answered, “First Miss, it seems like the Sixth Young Master of the Shi clan is here. Many people have filled the streets, and are throwing flowers and fruits into his carriage. So, the road is a little congested now.”

Zu An was perplexed. “Does he look like an ape or something? Why would so many people gather here to look at him, and even throw fruits into his carriage?”

Chu Chuyan smiled in amusement. Chu Huanzhao stepped in to explain the situation to him. “Silly brother-in-law. Haven’t you heard of Shi Kun from the Shi clan?”

“Is he very famous?” Zu An asked. “No one has ever gathered around to give me flowers even though I’m a famous figure in Brightmoon City too.”

Even Chu Huanzhao found that statement hard to swallow. She rolled her eyes and said, “In your case, it’s more notoriety than fame. His reputation is far better than yours. The Sixth Young Master of the Shi clan is known for his good looks. Have you ever heard of the story of ‘welcoming a carriage with fruits and flowers’?”

“Nope.” Zu An was confused. What the hell is that?

So, Chu Huanzhao launched into a rambling story. “It’s said that the Sixth Young Master of the Shi clan has a beautiful appearance and a graceful demeanor. In his earlier years, whenever he toured the streets of the capital, even old ladies would become infatuated with him and toss fruits into his carriage, filling it up. Upon hearing the story, another young master emulated Shi Kun’s example and drove his carriage around too, only to have the women of the capital fill his carriage up with spit.

“That should give an idea of how good-looking Shi Kun is. I thought that the story was just a rumor, but it seems like it’s real.”

“It sounds like an exaggeration to me.” Zu An was displeased by the excited look on Chu Huanzhao’s face.

“I shouldn’t miss this opportunity. I should head out to see how dashing that man is!” Chu Huanzhao got to her feet and prepared to dive out of the carriage, but her older sister forestalled her.

“The Shi clan belongs to the empress’ faction. It’s best for you not to come into contact with him,” Chu Chuyan remarked calmly.

Zu An nodded vehemently in agreement. He glared at Chu Huanzhao and said, “It looks like your parents are right to constantly nag at you. When will you learn to become more mature like your older sister?”

Disappointed, Chu Huanzhao sank back into her seat, her mouth shaped in an indignant pout. “Brother-in-law, you’re just jealous.”

Zu An sat up straight. “No matter how handsome he is, how could he possibly be more handsome than me? It should be enough for you to admire me!”

A tinge of red graced Chu Huanzhao’s cheeks. She turned her head away and murmured, “Shameless~”

A gentle voice came unexpectedly from outside the carriage. “Is Miss Chu inside? Shi Kun from the capital wishes to meet you.”

Dreamy exclamations immediately sounded outside.

“Waaaaa~ If only young master Shi would ask me out on a date like this!”

“Tsk, you should take a look at the mirror. Do you think you’re worthy?”

“It’s not as if you’re at all pretty.”

“Stop arguing. None of you can possibly compete with Chu First Miss when it comes to looks!”

“Tsk. No matter how pretty she is, it doesn’t change the fact that she’s already married. I’ve been protecting my chastity for young master Shi’s sake!”

The surrounding discussions stoked Zu An’s curiosity. He parted the carriage’s curtains a little and caught sight of a few women swooning. Huh? I expected to see some beautiful women out there, but they’re just a bunch of old hags. They don’t even come close to matching my wife!

Looks like that young master Shi isn’t as suave as the rumors put him out to be.

Zu An turned his gaze to the front, and what he saw was so bedazzling, it almost blinded him. Standing in front was a refined man who was so dashing, all who saw him would sing his praises for an hour straight!

Too freaking handsome!

Even Zu An had no choice but to acknowledge this. In terms of appearance, this man was nearly a match for him. However, it was known that women lacked the ability to accurately gauge how handsome a man was, so he turned away from the view outside and looked worriedly at Chu Chuyan.

Unexpectedly, Chu Chuyan was as calm as the surface of a lake in winter. She replied in a neutral voice, “My apologies, but it’s inconvenient for a married woman like me to meet with another man privately. I beg your pardon, young master Shi.”

After saying her piece, she gestured for the coach to set off.

Zu An was so delighted to hear those words, he was tempted to rush forward and embrace his wife tightly. All along, he had thought that his wife treated him so coldly because she looked down on him. However, it seemed she was impartial to everyone!

In fact, it could be said that she treats me fairly well.

...

Out on the street, Shi Kun watched the departing carriage with a hint of anger on his otherwise-beautiful face. The hands hidden within his sleeves were clenched tightly. Chu Chuyan, just you wait. You’ll be mine soon!

His awful complexion didn’t escape the notice of his surrounding fans, who broke into whispered gossip once more.

“That Chu woman sure is insolent. How dare she snub our young master Shi like this?”

“You could do that if you’re pretty enough too.”

“Hmph! I wouldn’t snub our young master Shi no matter how pretty I was!”

“Indeed! Why is she putting on airs? In the end, she still married a wastrel for a husband. I might not be able to best her in anything else, but at the very least, I’ll find a husband superior to hers!”

Of course, there were some who meekly pointed out, “Young master Shi had a frightening look in his eyes for a moment there...”

Such words of dissent were swiftly drowned out by the other fans. “What do you know? That’s what we call ‘devilish charms’! That’s a unique manner that only our young master Shi possesses!”

...

In the carriage, Chu Chuyan shifted uncomfortably under Zu An’s intent stare. “What are you looking at?” she finally asked.

Zu An replied with a smile, “I’m looking at you, honey. I think I’m growing fonder and fonder of you.”

Chu Huanzhao couldn’t stand this atmosphere. “Hey, hey, hey, there’s a child in here. Please control yourselves, alright?”

Zu An was left speechless. I mean, it’s true that you’re young, but to call yourself a child seems to be going too far, no?

“Don’t misunderstand. I didn’t turn down the young master of the Shi clan for you. I simply didn’t want to get involved with the Shi clan,” replied Chu Chuyan.

That did nothing to dampen Zu An’s joy. “Regardless of the reason, I’m quite happy that you rejected him.”

Chu Chuyan felt her frustration grow. She felt like her point wasn’t getting across to Zu An properly. After a moment’s thought, she decided to state it bluntly. “While I do identify myself as your wife while we’re outside, we’re both aware of what’s going on in our marriage. It’s impossible for me to fulfill my responsibilities as your wife. Therefore, I advise you not to become too involved in this relationship, lest you get hurt in the future.”

Chu Huanzhao felt deep pity for Zu An when she heard those words. While the Chu Estate was rife with such speculations, it was completely different hearing it right out of her big sister’s mouth. My brother-in-law must be really devastated to hear those words.

Unexpectedly, Zu An still maintained his jovial mood. “I know. However, whether I like you or not is my own business. It has nothing to do with whether you like me or not. Besides, who knows? You might just fall for me in the future.”

Chu Chuyan shook her head without a shred of hesitation. “That’s impossible.”

Zu An shrugged casually, thinking nothing of it. “Since you’ve already put it out like that, I have something to clarify with you as well. Since you don’t intend to fulfill your responsibilities as my wife, would you mind if I look for other women?”

Chu Huanzhao, who had been privately grieving for Zu An a moment ago, almost fell over in shock. Her eyes went wide. You horrible brother-in-law! My big sister will teach you a lesson for daring to cheat on her!

Chu Chuyan shared her surprise. She hadn’t expected such a question out of Zu An, but she still answered calmly, “I don’t mind. It’s just that you...”

She let her gaze drop downward to Zu An’s crotch. Since her little sister was in the carriage too, she chose not to say it out loud.

“You don’t have to worry about that. I should be able to recover in due time!” Zu An patted his chest proudly. He wasn’t fully confident in his ability to find the Evanescent Lotus, but his lack of certainty didn’t hinder him from putting on a strong front before Chu Chuyan.

Chu Chuyan let the matter rest. She thought that he was trying to turn his eyes away from the cruel reality.

Chu Huanzhao’s jaw fell open. What in the world is going on here? Not only was it ridiculous for my brother-in-law to ask my big sister if he could cheat on her, but my big sister didn’t get angry at all, and even said that she was fine with it?

Big sister, you must be unaware that my brother-in-law is far more outstanding than you know! If you release your grip on him, all those vixens out there would surely snatch him from your grasp!

No, this won’t do. I need to help my big sister keep him in check!

With the three of them harboring very different thoughts, they soon arrived at the academy. As a rule, students weren’t allowed to ride their carriages into the academy, so they alighted at the entrance.

Chu Chuyan’s appearance immediately stirred up a commotion amongst those gathered there, with many thanking the heavens above for allowing them to catch a glimpse of this elusive beauty at the top of the Sweetheart Ranking.

However, as they saw Zu An alighting from the same carriage, there was a huge outburst of envy. The unpleasant reminder that their goddess was already married to a good-for-nothing immediately soured their mood.

“What a coincidence. I didn’t expect to meet Chu First Miss here too,” a familiar voice drifted over toward them.

Zu An turned to take a look, and saw the magnificent Shi Kun standing not too far away. He had a dashing smile on his face, but, in Zu An’s opinion, it only looked irritating.
