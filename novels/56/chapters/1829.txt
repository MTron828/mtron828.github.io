Chapter 1778: Everyone Has Gathered

Zu An and the others asked in surprise, “Your original body is in that tomb?”

Jing Teng nodded.

The others thought, No wonder she was being so careful. If this information got out, who knew just how much bloodshed there would be.

“So the great tomb was actually built by Immortal Ruler Baopu for you,” Zu An said, thinking, This Immortal Ruler Baopu really treated her quite well.

Jing Teng shook her head and said, “How could I have such a blessing? This tomb existed a long, long time ago. Immortal Ruler Baopu discovered it, and even after exploring it for many years, he still wasn’t able to uncover all of its secrets. He just left my original body there in passing.”

Zu An was stunned. He had been really shocked when he first thought that this great tomb was made by Immortal Ruler Baopu. He had never expected Immortal Ruler Baopu to merely be the one who discovered it!

Just then, a clamor came from the distant tomb. They could vaguely make out the people around it stirring. Wave after wave of people seemed to be charging in as if they had gone mad.

Wei Suo immediately panicked and said, “Miss Jing, they’re already rushing into the tomb. If we let them gain the initiative, what if your original body ends up getting damaged?”

Jing Teng smiled and replied, “Don’t worry. How can this great tomb be entered so easily?”

…

Meanwhile, Zhao Han also arrived in front of the great tomb with Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing had already largely recovered from their wounds along the way, but they still felt incredibly sullen. They had previously been among the strongest of grandmasters, and back in their respective sects, they had been the most respected of individuals. Their lives in the world of warriors had been even more carefree. Normally, there had been many people who flocked around to serve them and were scared of mistreating them in any way. And yet now, they could only lower their heads and bend their backs to serve another for fear of angering him. More importantly, the person they were serving was the powerful Zhao Han. Even if they were unhappy, they didn’t dare to show it.

Only when they saw the sea of people around them and how most of them had inferior cultivation to themselves did they calm down a bit.

They wondered whether to find a chance to find some servants themselves. Otherwise, being at Zhao Han’s beck and call really wasn’t an ideal life.

Zhao Han’s gaze landed on the nearby great tomb. He could sense the ancient and mysterious aura coming from it and felt extremely pleased. Could this truly be an immortal opportunity?

“Go and ask those people why they’re still hesitating,” he ordered.

“Yes!” Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing replied, quickly running to the nearest group to ask around. They returned shortly after and said, “Your majesty, there seems to be some kind of restriction over the great tomb. They’re unable to enter.”

Zhao Han sneered. “They’re all feeble and unskilled, and yet they still wish to get their hands on the immortal opportunity?” As such, he ignored the others and walked straight to the entrance of the tomb.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing exchanged a look and quickly followed. If they clung to this thick leg, they could very well get a share of that immortal opportunity as well.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Who is this person?”

The various parties quickly noticed them.

“I’ve never seen them before. The strongest experts of the world are all well-known and famous.”

“Look at how arrogant he looks; his eyes are almost at the top of his head. Don’t tell me it’s some bumpkin from the mountain recesses…”

“It might not be. The world is large and experts have gathered from all over. Not all of them have made a name for themselves in the world. It might be some hidden expert.”

…

There were a few others in the crowd who quickly changed their expressions. They hid their faces in their cloaks and blended into the crowd.

“Why is he here?!”

“And why did both Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing become his lackeys?”

Zhao Han quickly arrived in front of the tomb entrance. He immediately greeted it with a fist, yelling, “Open!”

A golden fist emerged, becoming large beyond compare, and smashed against the entrance. All those in the surroundings felt a wave of destructive energy, leaving alarmed. How was this guy so strong? Just a random punch carried such force!

There had been some powerful beings waiting for these three to make a fool of themselves, but they all opened their eyes. There was alarm and fear in their gazes.

Even though a huge boom filled the air, the tomb’s entrance was completely unaffected. Zhao Han was speechless.

Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing were both horrified. They naturally knew just how terrifying Zhao Han’s fist was. Forget about a tomb entrance, even a mountain would have been blown apart! And yet, not even a speck of dust fell from the entrance?

Roaring laughter filled the air from all around, mocking them with phrases like ‘overestimating themselves’ and ‘why don’t you take a piss and look into the reflection’.

Zhao Han’s expression darkened. He had never expected to be embarrassed like this here!

A giant golden projection suddenly appeared around him. Its appearance was nearly identical to his own, just magnified countless times. The golden giant went right up to the tomb entrance, then reached out to try and pry it open. The entire great tomb began to rumble and quake.

“Is that the legendary yang spirit?” All those who had previously intended to just watch something interesting were all alarmed. Anyone who could come here had to be powerful. Those who were weaker had already been filtered out in the outer regions. They naturally recognized that this newcomer was extraordinary.

The only ones in this entire world who could reach such a level of power were the Yin Yang Realm’s Ghost King, the former Divine Firmament Sect Master Sun En, the legendary Adventurer’s Guild Guardian, as well as some select few others. Just where had this person come from? If it were just an ordinary hidden expert, that would be one thing, but how could one of the most powerful beings in the world remain hidden all this time?

While the others were feeling shocked, Zhao Han’s expression was grave as well. What was going on with this great tomb? He had already used all of his strength, so why hadn’t this tomb entrance opened at all?

Suddenly, streaks of ancient and desolate runes appeared around the great tomb. The entire tomb seemed to have come alive like an ancient dragon! Even Zhao Han felt a sense of danger.

Suddenly, the powers at the forefront roared, “Hurry and let go! If you activate the great tomb’s defensive formations, everyone here will die!”

Zhao Han’s expression darkened. If it only killed the people around him, he would continue without any hesitation. And yet, he could feel that these strange runes could even threaten his own life. At that moment, he became a bit hesitant. Still, he wasn’t willing to just back down here either.

Someone cried out, “This great tomb’s seal will open up soon. Is there a need for your distinguished self to be in such a hurry?”

There were clearly some who had guessed his thoughts, and they quickly gave him a way to back down. Otherwise, he would bring them all down with him.

Zhao Han finally withdrew his hands when he heard that, asking, “When exactly?”

“Roughly an hour!” someone quickly replied. “This comes from a prophecy from many years ago, so it shouldn’t be mistaken.”

The reason they had kept the weaker individuals farther away was precisely out of fear that they would want to get in on the action. But someone as powerful as this newcomer definitely had the qualifications to participate. That was why the major forces weren’t too inflexible.

“Fine, so what if I wait an hour!” Zhao Han snapped, his body flickering, and he instantly withdrew a hundred or so meters away. The golden projection also returned into his body.

When he saw how Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing wanted to look at him but didn’t dare, his face heated up a bit. They had arrived in such a bold manner, and yet they ended up completely humiliating themselves! Fortunately, there weren’t that many people who recognized him in this world.

He was getting more and more interested in this great tomb. It had a restriction he couldn't open even with all of his strength, which meant that the things inside definitely had the right to be considered immortal opportunities.

The various powers all rushed over to exchange conventional greetings. “May I ask what this daoist friend’s honorable name is? Why have we never met before?”

Zhao Han’s face twitched. This emperor was humiliated and doesn’t wish for others to know about it, and yet these people are still coming up to me.

…

Meanwhile, ten kilometers or so north of the great tomb, Chu Chuyan walked along a road while drawing the attention of everyone around her. However, she was way too beautiful, and she even seemed to have a faint glow around her body. No one dared to look straight into those cold and chilly eyes; they only dared to secretly give her a few looks.

Chu Chuyan didn’t let it bother her, however. This was something she had encountered all the time ever since she was little. She was already more than experienced in such situations. In order to avoid trouble, she used the Snowflake Sword around her. Sure enough, when they sensed her great strength, they didn’t dare to rashly provoke her anymore either.

Still, there were always exceptions in this world. A group of horsemen rushed right past her. Their equipment wasn’t standardized, and was instead all mixed up. This was clearly not the orderly cavalry of a nation, but rather a group of mountain bandits.

“Hm?” The group of horsemen had already passed Chu Chuyan, but then they all stopped. They turned around to look at Chu Chuyan. They were all left breathless.

“Boss, this chick is so pretty!”

“Yeah! I’ve never seen one this hot before!”

“If we could bring her back to become the stockade madam, it would be worth it even if we died tomorrow!”

…

Chu Chuyan’s expression darkened. These people’s filthy speech really was annoying. However, these were definitely not ordinary bandits. There were some whose auras were clearly no weaker than hers at all.

“Worth it my ass!” The one in the leader position immediately smacked the head of the one next to him. “Those in our trade need to value our lives the most. And yet you’re uttering things like ‘it’s worth it if we die’!”

“Boss is right…” that person said, smiling awkwardly in apology.

“But this woman is quite pretty. Why don’t we capture her first and have some fun for now?” another person said with a wicked smile.

The leader gave Chu Chuyan a deep look, but in the end, he shook his head reluctantly and said, “Forget it. This woman isn’t easily provoked. If we try to capture her, we’ll definitely suffer casualties. Our mission is more important right now. The arrival of that person in our territory is a gift to us from the heavens. Since we were able to uncover his whereabouts, we can’t let side issues keep growing. Otherwise, others might get to him before us.”

When he saw that his subordinates were still a bit reluctant, he said with a smile, “Once we kill that target and get the reward, it’ll be enough for us to sleep with a different courtesan every day.”

The bandits’ morale immediately gained a boost. They blew whistles while saying, “Boss is always right!” After saying that, they blew Chu Chuyan a kiss and roared with laughter as they urged their horses to move faster. A trail of smoke emerged in their wake.

Chu Chuyan frowned. Even though she was annoyed, she wasn’t a hot-headed woman. There was no need to fight against a group of strong individuals over some small matters in a secret dungeon. The most important thing right now was to look for her companions and find a way to return to her own world.

However, her eyes suddenly narrowed. She picked up a wanted poster that the group had accidentally dropped. When she saw the familiar face on it, she immediately became nervous.
