Chapter 1611 – One Mistake in Judgment Leads to a Lifetime of Regret

“I used to be really curious too. Just what kind of woman could leave so many outstanding men enamored, choosing to pursue her their entire lives? After meeting her yesterday, though, I learned that she truly is stunningly beautiful,” Xie Daoyun said, sighing. She had an astonished expression as she recalled her meeting with Yan Xuehen the previous day. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Zu An was a bit speechless. He had learned that Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s Sect Leader was one of Yan Xuehen’s pursuers, and now, there was another one. Furthermore, it was the State Teacher, someone with an extraordinary position in the current dynasty.

Just how many pursuers does Yan Xuehen have that I don’t know about?

Now it almost seems as if, out of the people from the previous generation I’ve met, half of them seem to have liked Yu Yanluo, while the other half liked Yan Xuehen. Of course, there were shameless individuals who liked both, such as Xie Daoyun’s father.

Then what about Yun Jianyue? Her appearance clearly isn’t inferior to Yan Xuehen, so why did she have such few pursuers?

However, he quickly realized that Yun Jianyue came from the Devil Sect.As the sect master, she had to maintain a strong and fierce demeanor and lacked the approachable impression Yan Xuehen gave off. Those people probably feared her, so there was no way she could compete with Yan Xuehen.

There was also another factor he wasn’t considering, though. He hadn’t met too many people from the Devil Sect yet. Yun Jianyue had likely captured the hearts of countless people there.

…

Just then, a disturbance occurred in front of Violet Mountain. The appearance of two women immediately drew the attention of all those who were coming and going.

One was dressed in a white dress purer than snow, while the other wore an icy-blue gown. Their clothes fluttered around like their beautiful black hair. Violet Mountain was known for its purple ki that appeared every morning, but these two seemed to be surrounded by a mystical energy too; it seemed some women really did glow, inevitably drawing people’s attention from birth. Furthermore, with two of them standing together, it really was a feast for the eyes.

The two women had veils over their faces that only revealed their beautiful eyes. However, not only did it not tarnish their beauty at all, it actually left quite a bit for the onlookers’ imaginations. There was a cold and detached look in the women’s gazes. Their skin was as exquisite and pure as snow, as if they were two snowy peaks that stood apart from the world with an icy, aloof, and sacred air. They didn’t give off the slightest hint of worldliness.

The previously busy mountain gate fell silent, as people couldn’t help but look at the women. They felt as if they were having an encounter with goddesses for the first time and were completely stupefied. Many of them didn’t even dare to stare directly, as they felt a mysterious sense of inferiority.

Such women were only supposed to exist in the heavens. How could the onlookers meet anyone like that in this world? Furthermore, there were two of them. Were they mother and daughter? Their temperaments seemed to have been cut from the same mold, with the only difference being that one was a bit more mature and the other more youthful.

However, the onlookers quickly dismissed that thought. How could a goddess birth a child for a man? They were definitely sisters! Those present were all outstanding talents, but at that moment, outrageous thoughts appeared in their minds one after another. It was as if their souls had been stolen away.

Sigh, after meeting goddesses like these, how can we ever like normal women again?

The two women walked toward the Righteous Sun disciples at the mountain gate. However, the disciples seemed to be frozen in place and didn’t react at all, causing the women to frown slightly.

The disciples’ leader suddenly seemed to wake up from a dream and quickly swallowed. He said with great difficulty, “Did the two fairies come to sightsee on Violet Mountain? I really must apologize. We plan to hold a Great Sects Competition on Violet Mountain, so no outside guests will be allowed in.” He regretted it as soon as he finished speaking. He had actually called them fairies the way a commoner would! He felt as if he had tarnished the Righteous Sun Sect’s reputation.

Meanwhile, other people shot him murderous looks from every direction. This guy is actually refusing such beautiful women? Did he turn stupid from too much cultivation?

Even if they’re not people from the nine sects, you still have to let them in somehow!

The woman in the icy blue gown took out a jade token and handed it over. The leader felt his heart rate accelerate just from looking at the small part of her wrist that was exposed; his throat went dry. He believed he had a firm will, and yet he had never met someone with a hand this beautiful and perfect.

However, he had been chosen to preside over welcoming the different sects, so he was still extremely talented. He quickly gathered his thoughts, then carefully received the jade token. When he saw the information recorded on it, he exclaimed in shock, “So it was the White Jade Sect’s Sect Master Yan! This junior is the Righteous Sun Sect’s Watchful Heart Peak Master Zhang Xi. I was lacking in manners earlier and hope that the sect master does not mind.”

The onlookers suddenly realized what had happened, and felt that this explained everything. Apart from the White Jade Sect’s Goddess Yan, who else could be so elegant and outstanding? They had heard that she recently took in an outstanding disciple. That was probably the one at her side, right? They hadn’t expected her style to be comparable to her master.

Why the heck did that Righteous Sun disciple give them his name? Is he trying to recommend himself? they thought. Still, they knew that if they were his place, they would want these two goddess-like figures to remember their names too.

The two women were, naturally, Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan. Perhaps because she wanted to avoid Zu An, Yan Xuehen had dragged her disciple all the way from Yi Commandery to Violet Mountain early in the morning. When she saw the disciple apologize, she didn’t say anything and only nodded slightly in return. It was a gesture of appreciation from a senior toward a junior, but that was also all it was. As long as it wasn’t related to Zu An, she could face anything with absolute composure.

As expected of the strongest of the nine sects, just a single disciple from one of their peaks had a great deal of cultivation and composure. Even then, however, the nod was enough to make Zhang Xi excited. Even though he was quite steady at heart, he was still a man. He instinctively wanted to show off in front of a beauty. As such, he continued, “Your esteemed sect’s Elder Li already brought his disciples up the mountain earlier. They are currently stopping over at the Divine Water Pavilion. This junior will bring you two to them.”

Many people around them cursed him for being shameless. Wasn’t this guy supposed to be receiving guests here? And yet, he was abandoning his duty to hang around women!

Sigh, those who are closest always benefit the most. Ah, we’re so jealous!

Chu Chuyan knew her master’s nature. She quickly said, “There is no need. My master prefers peace and quiet, so she will not stay with the other disciples. We will just head up on our own. Thank you for the trouble, senior brother.”

Even though her voice was soft and pleasant to listen to, it still carried a hint of coldness that almost seemed to push people a thousand miles away.

A hint of disappointment flickered through Zhang Xi’s eyes. The women had already tactfully refused, so there was no way he could insist. As such, he said, “Then please head up the mountain. Once you reach the palace, there will definitely be disciples there to make further arrangements for you.”

His expression was calm, but all sorts of emotions swirled within him. She actually called me senior brother! She called me senior brother! How can there be a voice this beautiful in this world? Ah, I’m going to die!

As the onlookers watched the two leave, only leaving behind a faint lingering fragrance, all those present by the entrance suddenly felt a sense of disappointment and loss.

…

Even after a long time passed, Chu Chuyan’s face continued to appear in Zhang Xi’s mind. He muttered to himself, “In the past, I didn’t understand why the glorious sect master would suddenly dedicate his entire life to Sect Master Yan after a single meeting. Today, I finally understand. What is the meaning of love in this world…”

He suddenly shivered as he spoke. He quickly ordered the disciple next to him, “Hurry, hurry and inform the Pure Yang Palace that Sect Master Yan has arrived!”

Each sect naturally had their own special method of passing on information.

…

Meanwhile, atop Violet Mountain’s highest peak, Golden Peak, inside the Pure Yang Palace, a middle-aged man in a robe sat on a praying mat in meditation. Purple ki surged around him as he took in and released the surrounding energies. He was clearly cultivating an extremely profound skill. Even though there were already some signs of age on his face, his complexion was still excellent. He was very handsome, and the purple ki lingering around him gave him the air of an immortal.

He was none other than the court’s State Teacher, the Righteous Sun Sect’s Wang Wuxie!

All of a sudden, a little bell nearby rang. He suddenly opened his eyes. After all, normally, no one would dare to disturb him during his cultivation. That meant the information was extremely important. Could it be that someone was coming to cause trouble at the bottom of the mountain? His expression turned cold. Even though all the members of the different sects were experts, things were now different from before, so even someone like him couldn't underestimate them.

Suddenly, a row of gold letters appeared on the wall in front of him. When he saw the contents, he was so excited he immediately sat up from his praying mat. Even his breathing quickened slightly as he muttered to himself, “Xuehen, so you still came to Violet Mountain after all?”
