Chapter 633: Accidental Collision

Translator: Pika

“The fuck?” Zu An’s eyes widened in shock. He thought that there was a hidden attack, but he relaxed a bit when he saw that it was Yun Jianyue’s overly taut body.

“It’s your fault for disrespecting me!” Yun Jianyue blushed, but she quickly recovered her composure. At the same time, she was glad that she took the initiative, or else if he woke up first and saw her like this, then she would be absolutely destroyed!

When he saw where her eyes moved, Zu An was furious. “This is a man’s natural reaction. You’re sleeping in my house, my bed, yet you’re hitting me. Isn’t this going a bit too far?!”

Yun Jianyue felt a bit guilty. She harrumphed and said, “That kick was also a woman’s instinctive reaction.”

Zu An: “……”

This woman is actually so shameless! As if she inherited my teachings…

Yun Jianyue was now a bit embarrassed. Her voice eased a bit. “Thank you for saving me. My injuries have improved a bit as well, so let’s not bother each other anymore.”

She was a girl after all, so it wasn’t all that comfortable living with another man under the same roof. Furthermore, she had to sleep with him on the same bed, so she felt extremely uncomfortable. If he noticed how she was sleeping… just the thought alone was embarrassing.

Zu An said with a serious voice, “Your injuries were so serious, how could you recover after just a single night? Also, the entire imperial palace is under strict martial law, and the formation is up and running again. His majesty’s divine senses even cover the entire palace. How can you even get out?”

Yun Jianyue became quiet. Of course she knew these things! But she couldn’t bring them up because of various reasons. “My sect’s people have either died off or escaped. They are definitely hiding in the imperial city, leaderless. I need to find a way to contact Honglei and have her take care of some things.”

Zu An thought for a bit, and then he said, “You can’t leave the palace right now. I’ll contact her in your place.”

He still had his identity as the crown prince secretary. Even getting to the eastern palace was a bit of a headache, because all passages through the palace gates were recorded. Later on, once those who were after him investigated closely and discovered that the crown prince’s secretary didn’t pass through the gates, then his identity would be easily exposed.

After a bit of hesitation, Yun Jianyue didn’t persist and said. “I’ll have to thank you for that.”

Zu An took out a bunch of food from his Brilliant Glass Bead. “I’m going out for a bit, you should just rest here. You absolutely cannot go out. Eat some of this first, I’ll bring better things later.”

“Thanks.” With Yun Jianyue’s cultivation, there wasn’t a huge issue even if she didn’t eat for half a month. However, she didn’t refuse his good intentions.

“By the way, if you have the chance, help me buy a hammock.” She added. Since she chose to stay here, then she had to do something about her sleeping arrangements.

She definitely can’t continue to sleep on the bed, yet she can’t sleep on the silk band either. This meant that she needed a bed.

A normal spatial storage might not be able to store an entire bed, but a hammock can be rolled up, so it shouldn’t be too big of an issue.

“Okay.” Zu An felt that it was a bit of a pity. He wanted to pretend to be asleep, but accidentally fell asleep and wasted such an excellent opportunity and even offended her.

Yun Jianyue was a bit apologetic when she saw him leave. “Does it still hurt?”

Zu An was stunned. Then, a smile appeared on his face. “So big sis does care about me after all!”

“Hmph!” Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “I was worried that no one would be able to help me if you got injured.”

Zu An laughed. He left with a good mood.

After an entire night of inspection, the palace doors were already opened up again. After all, the normal officials needed to continue their work, they couldn’t always be locked up.

Zu An’s status as a golden token envoy would allow him to freely move in and out of the palace. He noticed that the palace gate guards were acting a bit strange when they saw his waist token. This reaction left him puzzled. He raised his vigilance. There was someone who was on his trail after all!

Can it be that Cheng Xiong still didn’t give up?

Zu An sneered. With his current strength, it wasn’t so easy to follow him! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He made a few circles around the city. Once he threw off those tailing him, he changed in a corner, and then headed towards his own residence inside the city.

His entire body went taut as soon as he returned to his residence. He suddenly attacked to the side.

A lantern rose at this time, and then a figure attacked at him too.

The two of them immediately recognized each other and stopped.

“Honglei!”

“Ah Zu!”

Zu An was happy and surprised. “It’s great that you’re okay! His majesty sent General Liu Yao and Guerilla Warfar General Zhao Yuan to search the capital city. I was worried that something might have happened to you.”

Qiu Honglei smiled. “This girl has spent many years as a warrior. Do you think I’ll be captured that easily?”

She suddenly noticed that her tone was a bit off and quickly apologized. “Ah Zu, I wasn’t trying to criticize you.”

“I know.” Zu An smiled. He held her hand and walked inside. “Let’s talk inside to prevent anyone from listening in on us.”

“Okay.” Qiu Honglei subconsciously wanted to pull back her hand, but his grip was tight. She bit her lip and let him do what he wanted.

Zu An thought to himself that this girl was already getting used to holding hands and other physical contact. Hugging her didn’t seem to be okay too. Unfortunately, even though he worked so hard to get here, there was no future ahead.

Hm? Wait, even though they cannot lose their virginity because of the method they cultivate, there are other ways to play around! I don’t have a stash of japanese stuff for nothing!

“Ah Zu, did you find my master?” Qiu Honglei asked with worry. She was raised by her master, and she taught her everything too, so she really respected her master. She was extremely worried about her right now.

“I found her, and we slept together.” Zu An’s mind was elsewhere and replied subconsciously.

“Huh?” Qiu Honglei was shocked.

“Ahem…” Zu An’s face heated up and quickly said, “I saved her and brought her to my residence inside the palace.”

“How is the elder master?” Qiu Honglei nervously grabbed his hand.

“Um, your master isn’t old at all.” Zu An said with curiosity.

Qiu Honglei stuck out her tongue. “I was just being respectful…” She remembered being beaten several times for calling her this in the past. Looks like women all cared about their age after all! However, her master really did look like she would be her big sister at most.

Zu An replied, “Her soul was injured from her battle against the emperor… But you do not need to worry. I’ve already given her a Five Aggregates Root to treat her injuries, so she is fine. She was more worried about you guys and told me to tell you guys about her following plans.”

“That’s good then.” Qiu Honglei sighed in relief. “We went into hiding after leaving the palace. We’ve done business in the capital for many years, so hiding some people isn’t too big of a problem. The most regretful part are the brothers who were captured last night.”

There was even an elder who was caught because of her. She felt more and more awful. She was about to say something, but then hesitated. She wanted to ask Zu An to help those people, but these prisoners weren’t easy to rescue at all. He already took a huge risk trying to save her master, so how could she burden him with the others?

“Ah Zu, you’ve really helped us a lot. We don’t even know how to properly thank you.” Qiu Honglei gave him a sweet look.

Zu An laughed and said, “We’re all our own people, you’re treating me like a stranger by saying these things! Of course, if you really want to thank me, then why don’t you offer yourself to me?”

He pulled her into his embrace after saying this. He wanted to see if Yun Jianyue deceived him.

Qiu Honglei’s face reddened when she sat in his embrace. “Ah Zu, the technique I cultivate is special. I cannot let my body be tarnished for a period of time.”

Zu An sighed inside when he heard what she said. It was like this after all!

Qiu Honglei merely treated this as disappointment on his end. She bit her lips, and then suddenly said, “Ah Zu, even though I cannot give myself to you, I’ve seen what those girls in Immortal Abode have done. I can take care of you in other ways.”

Zu An’s heart immediately began to pound. Qiu Honglei’s cheeks became more and more rosy. She was sitting in his arms, so there was no way she didn’t feel his body’s reactions.

…

Meanwhile, a few streets out, a beautiful white clothed woman was currently walking over with a handsome young master. Their attractiveness were both off the charts and drew eyes from all directions.

“Big sis, their looks are really annoying!”

“You have the identity of a man right now anyway. What is there to be scared of?”

“Hmph, I just don’t like it.” The youngster added. Her big sister’s expression was the same! But I guess she doesn’t look as annoyed.

“Your brother-in-law lives here?” The goddess-like white clad woman’s voice was no longer as cold and indifferent. It sounded a bit panicked instead.

“Two more streets. We’re not far already.” The young man couldn’t help but remember that scene from that day upon seeing her expression. His cheeks also became pink.
