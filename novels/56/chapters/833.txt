Chapter 807, Part 3: Destined to Fail

Translator: Pika

Zu An said with a smile, “Apart from me, there are so many children from great clans. How difficult can it be to kill a Jade Moon Serpent? It seems King Qi isn’t so optimistic about this trip. Perhaps you made some arrangements that would cause us to meet premature ends?”

Zhao Xi and the others stuck out their chests when they heard Zu An’s praise. They thought that this fellow at least knew how to talk well.

But who could have thought that he would say that King Qi was laying a trap for them right afterwards? Their expressions all changed. Did this idiot even know the ways of the court? Even though the two factions were already at a point where they couldn’t coexist, they were still friendly on the surface. Someone who just spoke whatever they thought really was just a commoner from the streets.

All of them looked down on Zu An. At the same time, they were worried that King Qi might become hostile. If that happened, all of them would be caught up in the disaster.

You have successfully trolled Zhao Xi for +222 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Meng Pan for +222 Rage points!

You have successfully trolled Pei You for +222 Rage points!

…

However, what was surprising was that King Qi didn’t get mad. Instead, there was a refreshing smile on his face. “Sir Zu, you’re worrying too much. This king only wished to give you a reminder. I once again wish everyone a smooth journey.”

Even Bi Linglong, who hated the man bitterly, had to admit that it was no wonder that King Qi had such prestige both inside and outside the court. This kind of presence and temperament wasn’t something just anyone could have.

Soon afterward, Zhuxie Chixin walked over, as if worried that King Qi would do something to them. The emperor hadn’t arrived today and had only sent Meng Yi, Bi Qi, Zhuxie Chixin, and other trusted aides over. However, there was no need to worry about King Qi’s faction doing anything with these individuals guarding the entrance.

Qi Yaoguang slowly walked onto the stage. Her drowsy eyes became deep like the cosmos. She mumbled to herself as she held a star diagram in her hands. Soon afterward, the air seemed to ripple around them. Those who had higher cultivation levels could sense that the ki in the area was undergoing an intense transformation. Even space and time seemed to be reconstructing themselves.

The small-bearded Liu Xian’s eyes widened. “Wasn’t the libationer the one who was going to open up the dungeon? Miss Qi… Is she enough for this?”

He wasn’t the only one who had such thoughts. Qi Yaoguang looked just too young, almost like a loli. She looked like those daughters of great clans who didn’t know anything. It really was hard to imagine that someone like her was going to manage something so major like controlling the secret dungeon.

Bi Linglong was the crown princess, so she had more information at her disposal. When she heard those words, she explained, “Qi Yaoguang is the libationer’s last disciple, and what she researches is astrology, fate, and other such profound things. That’s why you shouldn’t judge her by her appearance.

“Furthermore, the secret dungeon opens up once every four years. The academy has already had centuries of experience in its operation. There’s naturally no need for Sir Libationer to do the deed himself.”

Liu Xian revealed his trademark smirk. “I’m becoming more and more interested in Miss Qi now. I definitely have to use my masculine charm to completely subdue her once we’re back from this dungeon.”

The people around him rolled their eyes. The stocky Zhao Xi was the most straightforward of them all. He shot back, “Can you shut up about that already? My breakfast might come out if I listen to any more of this.”

Liu Xian harrumphed. “How can a boorish man like you understand the thoughts of a young lady? Talking to you is like playing a lute to a cow.”

“What did you say?!” Zhao Xi was furious when he heard those words. He pulled up his sleeves and walked toward Liu Xian.

Liu Xian reacted quickly as well, quickly hiding behind his cousin. Gao Ying was left with no choice but to stand in front of Zhao Xi.

Zhao Xi frowned. Forget about Gao Ying’s respectable reputation; the test had just revealed that he was at the peak of the sixth rank. If there really was conflict, it might not do him any good. Yet if he let things go just like that, how could he swallow this down? He was trapped between a rock and a hard place.

Meng Pan had never gotten along with Zhao Xi anyway. He was more than happy to see them start a fight, to the point that he was even tempted to cheer the other party on.

Pei You held his sword in his arms in the distance, remaining completely indifferent.

The Gu clan brothers were excited. They wanted to see these youngsters from top clans duke it out. Only then could backups like them truly shine!

Bi Linglong finally couldn't take it anymore. She remarked in annoyance, “What are you all doing? Are the crown prince and I nothing in your eyes? Are we going to start some internal strife before we even go inside?”

Zhao Xi, Liu Xian, and the others took the opportunity to back down. They all expressed their apologies to her.

Zu An didn’t care about this small episode, but was rather preoccupied with another issue. Just now, it had been mentioned that the dungeon opened once every four years, yet Jiang Luofu had said that the last time it was opened was three years ago. That meant it wasn’t time for the dungeon to open yet. It seems they’re opening it up a year earlier for the crown prince’s exam. But are there really no issues with doing that?

After all, to a certain degree, dungeons were spatial rifts that connected independent worlds. If an accident happened, these people would have no hope of ever returning.

However, Zu An saw that the academy’s people didn’t seem to be too concerned about that. Furthermore, if an issue came up, there was no way the emperor would just ignore it. That meant it was probably fine… Right?

Soon afterward, a wormhole-like entrance appeared in front of the group. Bi Linglong waved her hand. Piao Duandiao and Jiao Sigun led the Eastern Palace’s guards inside first to take a look at the situation. Zhao Xi and the others gestured with their hands as well, sending some of their people in as support.

A while later, Piao Duandiao and the others said from the other side, “Everything is normal.”

Bi Linglong nodded, and then gestured for a group of guards to escort the crown prince inside. The Gu clan brothers took the chance to move over to her side, as if they were going to protect her. Zhao Xi, Meng Pan, and the others similarly approached the crown prince. These were the two most important people in this mission, so their safety should obviously be prioritized.

Zu An chuckled when he saw how eager everyone was to head inside. He didn’t feel the need to do that at all and planned to hold up the rear.

But who could have expected that Bi Linglong would turn around and gesture toward him? She asked, “Sir Zu, why aren’t you coming over yet? My and the crown prince’s safety is in your hands!”

The others, who were all doing their best to get closer to the crown prince and princess, immediately shot him looks of jealousy. Why did the crown princess trust him that much? Could it be that it really was because his face was a bit more handsome than average? That was the case for Chu First Miss, and now the crown princess was the same. Hmph, women are all superficial after all!

Zu An had an awkward smile on his face when he saw endless Rage points flowing in. Was this woman trying to get him killed?

But he knew what she was thinking as well. It was hard to predict what kind of dangers they would face in the dungeon this time, and worst of all, they didn’t know what King Qi was up to. That was why they had to act cautiously every step of the way. That was why she would only feel safe when she had the ones she trusted closest to her.

Chu Youzhao’s expression became strange when she watched everyone enter one after the other. “Does the crown princess have feelings for my brother-in-law or something?”

“I don’t think so.” Murong Qinghe jumped in fright. She quickly warned Chu Youzhao to change to ki transmissions. “There was a huge scandal between the crown princess and big brother Zu. She should be avoiding him if something happened, in order to further prove her clear conscience. Also, she’s the glorious crown princess; you’re the only one who puts your brother-in-law on a pedestal all the time, as if everyone were out to steal him away or something.”

Chu Youzhao became upset right away. “What, is my brother-in-law not awesome enough?”

“Big brother Zu is pretty cool.” Murong Qinghe secretly gave Chu Youzhao a look. When she saw how pretty he was, she couldn't help but blush. She added inwardly, But to me, you’re the best.

…

On the other side of the portal, Zu An’s group had entered the secret dungeon. Their party was made up of carefully selected elites from all sorts of different clans, and all of them had experienced other secret dungeons before. That was why the distribution of roles went smoothly, and they quickly formed a well-knit formation.

Some scouts were quickly sent out to find a safe path. The outer ring was made up of warriors from the different clans, while the ones in the middle were the Eastern Palace guards led by Piao Duandiao. The ones at the very center of the group were the crown prince, crown princess, and Zu An.

They had done their homework ahead of time, so they quickly arrived at Cold Jade Pond. That was the place where the Jade Moon Serpent resided. They were all especially nervous, and they were prepared for a bloody battle. However, no matter how much they scouted thieplace, there was no activity from the waters at all.

Then, the group directed elemental attacks at the Cold Jade Pond to try and draw the Serpent out. But there was still no response. In the end, they sent some deathsworn knights in to look around. However, they still didn’t find any trace of the Jade Moon Serpent.

“That fella isn’t here; I don’t sense its aura at all.” Zu An wasn’t convinced and squatted down by the side of the pond. He withdrew his hand after testing it for a while.

He used the jade badge to try to control the fish inside. However, there wasn’t even a single shrimp inside. Fortunately, he had the Blue Mallard ability, granting him powerful affinity with water. He sensed the movements of the water element inside the Cold Jade Pond and deduced that there was no Jade Moon Serpent here.

Meng Pan muttered to himself, “Look at you showing off. The deathsworn knights already looked around; do we need you to tell us that it’s not here?”

Zu An just chuckled and didn’t argue with him.

“Then what do we do?” Bi Linglong frowned. The crown prince’s task was to kill the Jade Moon Serpent, yet their objective wasn’t even here. Didn’t that mean the exam was a failure?
