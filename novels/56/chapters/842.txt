Chapter 815: Where Do You Get Your Confidence From?

The others were shocked when they heard the crown princess’ words. Gao Ying and Pei You’s eyes lit up. If Zu An came, everyone would have a chance of surviving.

However, their expressions quickly darkened again. After all, in their opinion, even though Zu An might have been hiding his strength somewhat, it would only be around their level at most. It wouldn’t make any difference against someone like Shi Tong who was at the peak of the eighth rank. There was still no chance of victory. He could crush Zu An with a single hand.

A clear and bright voice rang out. “What can I say? I didn’t expect this drama to be so interesting! Of course I should take the time to watch it properly.”

“Zu An!” Shi Tong turned around with gritted teeth when he heard this voice. Flames were almost erupting from his eyes.

You have successfully trolled Shi Tong for +444 +444 +444…

It was precisely this person who had caused their Shi clan to be destitute and ruined. How could he not hate him?

Zu An chuckled. “Oh? I didn’t expect to receive such a warm welcome here. The women are calling out to me, and the men are calling out to me too.”

Shi Tong and Bi Linglong were speechless. Why did this brat always sound as if he really deserved a good beating?

Zu An used this chance to arrive at Bi Linglong’s side and help her up into a seated position. “How are your injuries?”

“It’s not too bad.” Bi Linglong felt warm inside.

Gao Ying and Pei You felt resentful. The crown princess’ injuries are obviously the lightest! Can’t you tell that we’re on the verge of dying here?

But at this point, it didn’t matter. Before someone at the peak of the eighth rank, it was only a matter of dying a bit sooner rather than later.

When they saw how close Zu An was with Bi Linglong, the Gu clan brothers went mad with jealousy. “You bastard, let Linglong go!”

You have successfully trolled Gu Heng for +233 +233 +233…

You have successfully trolled Gu Xing for +233 +233 +233…

Zu An chuckled. “Weren’t the two of you both yes-men when Shi Tong was bullying her? Look at how aggressive you two are acting against me now. Honestly, if the two of you had made a stand against Shi Tong earlier, maybe my opinion of you two might’ve improved a bit.”

The two of them immediately felt tremendous shame when they heard those words. They were indeed terrified under Shi Tong’s pressure.

Gu Heng found it harder and harder to accept when he saw the disdain in Bi Linglong’s eyes. “Who do you think you are? You dare compare yourself to General Shi? Furthermore, why do we brothers need your commentary when we do things?!”

You have successfully trolled Gu Heng for +582 +582 +582…

Zu An laughed in ridicule. He didn’t feel like wasting his breath on Gu Heng and turned to look at Shi Tong, asking, “How did you even get inside? Didn’t they test everyone’s cultivation before we entered this dungeon?”

Shi Tong said coldly, “King Qi has an aura concealing artifact, so it wasn’t hard to get in. As for the mask, we just needed to kill that Bi clan warrior and peel off his skin.”

Bi Linglong glared at the Gu clan brothers when she heard those words. “The two of you actually colluded with outsiders to harm our Bi clan’s warriors!”

The brothers were a bit embarrassed, but Gu Xing reacted quickly and said, “You make it sound as if you treated us as your own in the first place.”

“Indeed, it looks like you already made arrangements with Zu An ahead of time. Chasing him away before was just an act to fool us,” Gu Heng said hatefully. “The one you trusted the most was this lowly person after all.”

Bi Linglong said coldly, “Thank goodness the one I trusted was him and not you two, or else I would’ve already met a tragic end.”

When the scouts had mysteriously disappeared a few days before, she had discussed it with Zu An in private. They were certain that the perpetrator was in their group.

Unfortunately, the enemy was too crafty and didn’t show any openings. As such, they decided to bait the enemy in. Sure enough, the true masterminds began to show themselves bit by bit.

“Look at how cocky all of you are getting.” Shi Tong snickered. “But in my opinion, nothing has changed at all! I was going to hunt Zu An down after I dealt with you all, but now, he’s decided to waddle right back, saving me some time. I can just get rid of all of you together.”

Bi Linglong immediately felt her spirits dampen. Even though Zu An had told her to trust him before, Shi Tong was at the peak of the eighth rank! Furthermore, he was a general of one of the empire’s six great armies. This was absolutely not filth raised purely through the abuse of resources. His real fighting strength was definitely top notch as well. It seemed as if everything was now pointing at disaster.

She said in an overcast voice, “Ah Zu, I’ll stall him, so you should get away from here. If you can, please bring the crown prince with you. If you really can’t, then just run away yourself. Once you get out of the dungeon, report everything that happened to his majesty.”

Zu An shook his head. “How can I leave you behind in a moment of danger and run off alone by myself?”

Bi Linglong’s reason told her that if they both stayed here, then they would all die. But when she heard that Zu An was willing to stay here with her, she instead felt incredibly moved.

Gao Ying and Pei You had strange looks on their faces. Are we seeing things? Why do the two of them seem like lovers?

The Gu clan brothers were already seething with rage. “Bastard, you say some pretty words. But with General Shi here, what difference can you make by staying here?”

You have successfully trolled Gu Heng for +788 +788 +788 Rage points…

You have successfully trolled Gu Xing for +788 +788 +788 Rage points…

Shi Tong was quite satisfied with their tactfulness. He smiled and said, “Indeed. You can all end your delusional thoughts. None of you will get away today.” He took a step forward after speaking. His aura at the peak of the eighth rank erupted forth. The faces of those nearby turned pale, and even breathing became a bit difficult.

Bi Linglong grabbed Zu An’s sleeves tightly. She had already prepared herself for death. She was going to go all out together with Zu An, and as soon as the situation looked impossible, she would immediately end her own life to avoid being defiled by these filthy men.

Zu An patted her shoulder, telling her to calm down. Then, he looked at Shi Tong. “Do your Shi clan’s people all have such blind confidence? Just who gave you so much confidence that you think everything is already decided?”

Shi Tong was unfazed. “I have to admit that you have some skill. Back then, even sixth brother lost to you. Honestly, sixth brother has had it a bit too easy growing up, so that was why he was so disappointing. However, before absolute strength, it’s meaningless no matter how many tricks you have.”

Zu An sighed. “Are fights won through words nowadays? I actually don’t mind fighting with my lips with a pretty girl, but come on, you’re a grown man. I have to politely decline.”

Bi Linglong scoffed inwardly. Just what kind of situation was this? Yet this fellow was still so indecent.

“Are you trying to taunt me to find an opening?” Shi Tong remained unconcerned. “Unfortunately, you have no idea what kind of concept the eighth rank is. We can borrow the power of heaven and earth. All tricks are meaningless. Make your move, or else you won’t have another chance.” He stood there with his arms behind his back.

Together with the pressure Shi Tong was releasing, the Gu clan brothers behind him were both fully convinced of his strength. They thought to themselves, How amazing would it be if we could reach this level one day!?

“Then don’t regret it afterward!” Zu An laughed. His smile was extremely dazzling.

Shi Tong gave him a faint look. “Stop speaking nonsense and treasure this chance I’m giving you…”

Zu An had already moved halfway through Shi Tong’s sentence, closing the gap almost instantly.

How is he so fast?! Shi Tong felt a chill and quickly thought of raising his hands to stop the other party. Unfortunately, he was a step too late. Zu An’s fist had already slammed straight into his face. In that instant, the flesh on his face felt mushy and his entire face warped. As his body flew through the air, he screamed miserably. A line of blood decorated the sky, as well as some broken teeth.

Zu An pulled back his fist, wiping away the blood on it disdainfully. “Keep bragging, let’s see what that gets you.”

The others were stupefied. What the hell was going on? Shi Tong was blasted flying? They had expected Zu An to try all sorts of tricks, while Shi Tong would remain completely unfazed. That was the most reasonable result! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Even Bi Linglong, who trusted Zu An the most, was shocked. Even though she had known that Zu An was hiding his real strength, she had only expected Zu An to have some chance against Shi Tong. However, the scene she had just seen completely shattered her entire worldview.

The Gu clan brothers were so shocked their jaws almost dropped to the floor. They quickly ran out to help Shi Tong, asking, “General Shi, what are you going to do now?”

“Get lost!” Shi Tong flung the two of them away in annoyance. Then, he quickly stood back up and glared at Zu An.

But his nose was now a bit crooked, and his face was covered in blood. Because of the loss of a few teeth, his mouth also looked a bit sunken. His current appearance was as comical as it could get.
