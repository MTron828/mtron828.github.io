Chapter 1807: Dance Offering to the Universe

After some hesitation, in the end, Mi Li didn’t say anything to Zu An. He still wasn’t strong enough, and knowing more would only do more harm than good.

Meanwhile, Qiu Honglei saw the things Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman had obtained. Even though she didn’t understand what exactly the Pure World Ice Lotus or Paramita Butterfly were, they were clearly quite extraordinary. She couldn't help but feel a bit jealous. They were around the same strength, and perhaps she was even a bit stronger herself, but now that they had obtained those inheritances, was she going to fall behind?

Previously, after ending up in this secret dungeon, she had discovered that all of the others had gone missing and only she and Ah Zu were together. She’d believed that she had finally become the female protagonist. And yet, soon after, they had run into the beautiful Jing Teng. Even though Jing Teng had always claimed that it was nothing, the flirtatious looks she kept giving Ah Zu meant something had clearly happened without Qiu Honglei’s knowledge.

Even disregarding Jing Teng, she’d had to watch as Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman ravaged her man right in front of her… Now, she could do nothing as they obtained inheritances that were clearly incredible from the mere sound of them.

I admit, I’m envious…

However, she was the Devil Sect Saintess and had her own pride. She quickly collected her thoughts.

Hmph, my Devil Sect’s inheritance has existed for thousands and thousands of years; how can it be inferior to them? I refuse to believe that I’m inferior to them!

Her eyes burned fiercely when she realized that, and she was no longer as dispirited as earlier.

…

Just then, Jing Teng said to Immortal Ruler Baopu, “Immortal ruler, part of the reason why I was able to safely return was also Miss Qiu’s great help.”

Qiu Honglei was stunned. She had never expected Jing Teng to speak up for her! After all, the two of them had constantly been bickering back and forth on the way like a wife against a mistress. And yet now, Jing Teng was actually helping her.

In that instant, she felt a bit embarrassed and said, “Little sister Jing speaks too courteously. I didn’t do too much.”

Even though she’s older, there’s no way in hell I’ll acknowledge her as the big sister! Everything else can still be discussed, but not this.

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman perked up their ears. These two were already calling each other sisters?

This is bad. We’ll now have another competitor in the future.

…

In the distance, Zhao Han frowned. Something didn’t seem to be right here. As an emperor, he naturally had his harem back in the palace. Those women were always at each other’s throats. Even though they looked amiable on the surface, their smiles all hid blades. Why were Zu An’s women all getting along so well? They even took the initiative to help each other out!

What right does he have to deserve this?!

You have successfully trolled Zhao Han for +666 +666 +666…

Zu An was really confused right now. What is going on with Zhao Han? Could it be that he’s jealous that everyone else is getting something but him?

Immortal Ruler Baopu looked at Jing Teng with a kind expression, saying, “You are surprisingly kind. But it’s fine; I just happen to have something that shares fate with her.”

He took out a talisman, and with a tap of his finger, it turned into a female figure that danced lightly and gracefully in the air. It was very slow at first, but it soon moved faster and faster. The beautiful figure’s movements were simple, and yet the dance seemed extremely profound. There wasn’t the slightest sense of worldly seduction to it; instead, it had a dignified and solemn air. The figure entered Qiu Honglei’s forehead.

Immortal Ruler Baopu said, “Many people cannot understand why rites and music are among the seven skills of cultivation, and the leaders of the seven skills, no less. What does this lady think?”

Qiu Honglei only felt as if she had been filled with inspiration. She quickly replied, “That is because rites and music are the ceremonies used to join heaven and earth!”

Immortal Ruler Baopu nodded in appreciation and said, “As expected, you were the one it was destined for. If you cultivate that dance properly, as your cultivation rises higher and your insights regarding the art of dance grow more profound, it will unravel into information of a higher rank. I hope that one day, you can learn the entire sequence of this Dance Offering to the Universe.”

“Thank you, immortal ruler!” Qiu Honglei exclaimed, unable to contain her joy.

As the Devil Sect’s Saintess, as well as an undercover courtesan queen, she excelled in dance to begin with. This Dance Offering to the Universe seemed as if it had been made just for her! Even though she still didn’t know what it was for, she could already sense some things. She now just had to gain more insights on her own.

Immortal Ruler Baopu smiled. Then, he gave Zu An a long look, but didn’t say anything. Instead, he then looked at Jing Teng and said, “Little Teng, my time is almost up.”

Jing Teng exclaimed in shock, “You’re going to leave?”

Immortal Ruler Baopu replied, “This is nothing more than a strand of leftover will. I already used up all of my power earlier, so I must naturally scatter away.”

Jing Teng’s eyes turned red as she said, “You’re going to be leaving me all by myself…”

Immortal Ruler Baopu shook his head and replied, “No, you are now different from before. You will no longer be lonely.”

Jing Teng’s face became slightly red. She lowered her head, and was too embarrassed to look at anyone.

“You have lived this life alone; it is good that you now have friends. I hope…” Immortal Ruler Baopu trailed off with a sigh. Then, he gradually scattered into specks of light, which gradually converged into a book. Its title was on the surface, written in large text: Baopu Sutra.

Jing Teng was about to reach out to take it when a large golden hand suddenly flashed past and seized the Baopu Sutra.

“Hahaha! This emperor has finally obtained the immortal opportunity!” Zhao Han exclaimed, seeming almost as if he had gone mad. He roared with laughter, and with another step, he instantly disappeared from the tomb room.

He had actually wanted to use the chance to kill Zu An and the others, but this was Immortal Ruler Baopu’s tomb and Jing Teng’s relationship with the immortal ruler was good, so committing murder inside could cause unwanted variables. Besides, he could sense that there were several powerful auras rushing in this direction. Every single one was on par with him, so it was more advantageous for him to leave first after getting what he wanted. He could kill Zu An, that wretched tramp, later.

Everything just happened too quickly. Zu An’s group wanted to stop Zhao Han, but they couldn't react in time at all. He had already disappeared without a trace.

“Oh no! That Baopu Sutra has entered Zhao Han’s hands and he won’t have to worry about heaven and man deterioration anymore. Ah Zu will be in danger…” Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman said worriedly. The happiness they had felt from what they received immediately disappeared.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As Zu An’s lovers, they naturally knew about Zu An and Zhao Han’s grudge. There was no way the two could coexist. They had been hoping that Zhao Han would just die from old age, but now that he had obtained the Baopu Sutra, his life could clearly be prolonged. Perhaps he would even have a chance of immortal ascension! Zhao Han had already been without equal before. If he took another step forward, how could they possibly fight back?

Qiu Honglei was also full of worry.

No wonder we couldn't find the immortal opportunity no matter what we did. So it turns out the remains were none other than the Baopu Sutra, and a soul fragment was attached to it.

Even a portion of Zhao Han’s soul was destroyed by Ah Zu, so he definitely hates Zu An bitterly.

However, this immortal ruler really is something! Why didn’t he just get rid of Zhao Han immediately? Also, the way he passed on the sutra was too negligent. Sure enough, Zhao Han stole it…

Zu An was surprisingly calm as he looked at Jing Teng with a smile.

Jing Teng’s face reddened. After some hesitation, she began, “Actually…” However, she suddenly sensed something and held her tongue.

Right at that moment, several figures flew in. The one at the forefront said in surprise, “A moment ago, my mighty self sensed an immortal’s aura. This is the place; there is no mistake. Why did it suddenly disappear?”

The whole group followed the source of the voice. They saw a disheveled daoist floating in midair. He was dressed in an apricot yellow robe inscribed with divinatory patterns. There was something of a majestic air about the patterns, too. An imposing pressure naturally emanated from that person; everyone present was a strong cultivator with powerful senses, so they immediately sensed that this person’s cultivation actually wasn’t inferior to Zhao Han’s in the slightest.

“Big brother Zu!” a shocked and happy voice cried. A gentle and quiet young lady looked at Zu An with pleasant surprise. Her beautiful eyes were as beautiful as Jiangnan’s waterways.

Behind her was a woman dressed in gold and black embroidered robes, her long hair draped naturally behind her. However, as she stood with her hands behind her, she gave off a mysterious sense of dignity.

“Miss Xie!”

“Yun… Sect master!”

Zu An was also pleasantly surprised. He had been worried about them the whole time, and hadn’t expected to reunite here.

At first, Xie Daoyun had a big smile on her face and only saw Zu An, but a moment later, she saw all the beauties standing around him; some she recognized, and others she didn’t.

No wonder he’s not calling me little sister Ling’er; his other lovers are here…

You have successfully trolled Xie Daoyun for +55 +55 +55…

A dangerous glint flickered through Yun Jianyue’s eyes.

This brat used to call me big sis so sweetly, and yet now, it’s Sect Master Yun? Is it just because the other women are here?

Even though she knew she would actually be the one panicking if he did call her big sis Yun, she still couldn't help but get angry.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue +250 +250 +250…

Why is she suddenly getting angry? Zu An thought in confusion. Just then, however, he suddenly sensed the women exchanging looks with each other. There almost seemed to be dangerous sparks flickering in the air. He shuddered.
