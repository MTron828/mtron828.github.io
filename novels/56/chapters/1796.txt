Chapter 1745: A Unexpected Grandmother

Zu An’s expression grew grave. He asked, “How strong is your Great Sister?”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Little Ying replied, “Not even ten of me would be able to beat her.”

Zu An and Qiu Honglei’s expressions changed. They both saw the worry in each other’s eyes. Wei Suo was still in Ruo Lan Temple! Even though he should have been fine with his cultivation, he was completely smitten with romance. Furthermore, if this Great Sister was so strong, it would be over if he instantly got his blood essence sucked out of him.

Zu An’s body flickered as he ran straight for Ruo Lan Temple. Qiu Honglei kicked off lightly and quickly followed him.

Little Ying was stupefied. She had thought that this gentlemanly young master appeared to be a weak and refined sort. She clearly couldn't sense any cultivation from him, so how was he so strong? Also, that dainty-looking beauty’s cultivation seemed a bit ridiculously high!

After some hesitation, even though she was a bit scared, she still decided to follow along after Zu An’s dashing face appeared in her mind. He’s so handsome, so he’s definitely a good person. He definitely won’t make things hard for me.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An moved as fast as lightning. By the time he arrived at Ruo Lan Temple, he just happened to see Wei Suo being… invaded in the mouth. He was shocked. He had only seen similar scenes from hentai in his previous world, and hadn’t thought he would witness it in person. It really was quite a shock to the eyes.

Wei Suo struggled frantically to use his two fists to fight against the endless… hands. The thick vine reached deeper and deeper down his throat, almost completely filling his mouth. It was difficult for him to even shout for help now.

Suddenly, he saw Zu An and tried to cry out for help, shedding tears of humiliation. “Mmm! Mmm…”

Zu An snapped out of his daze. He reached out and unleashed a blade of flames forward.

Geaaack!

Great Sister screamed miserably as the thick vine that was filling Wei Suo’s mouth was severed. She pulled back all of her vines out of fear, while urgently beating out the flames left on the damaged vine.

Wei Suo was also freed, and quickly pulled out the thing in his mouth. Without the support of the main body, the severed vine no longer had any power, so he was able to quickly pull it out and throw it onto the ground. It wriggled back and forth as if it were still alive.

Off to the side, Wei Suo vomited repeatedly. At the same time, he gasped for air. He had almost suffocated to death just then!

Zu An couldn't help but look at the vine on the ground. His expression was quite strange as he thought, Just how did Wei Suo keep such a huge thing in his mouth…

Qiu Honglei couldn't help but frown when she arrived. She reflexively hid behind Zu An.

Great Sister finally got rid of the flames around her and cursed, “You damn brat, you dare to meddle in the business of other people… Huh?”

She was about to fly into a terrible rage, but when she saw what Zu An looked like, she was completely stupefied. There was actually such a handsome man in this world? When she saw the gorgeous woman next to him, she suddenly understood. These were probably the two Little Ying had talked about.

Her anger instantly subsided and she said, “Greetings, young master. So this one was the young master’s friend! It was all just a misunderstanding.”

“F*ck you!” Wei Suo cursed. He immediately charged at her with his tiger claw saber.

He had been caught off guard earlier and been instantly restrained. After enduring such shame, he was utterly furious. The surface of his saber was enveloped in an earthen yellow light, and it let out an ear-splitting sound as it tore through the air. His skill with the blade was clearly quite proficient.

Zu An nodded as he thought, It looks like Wei Suo is an earth element cultivator. Furthermore, both the strength behind his attack and the angle are remarkable. No wonder he’s been able to live well these years.

Great Sister had been about to let Wei Suo go after seeing such a handsome young master, and yet this damn clown didn’t have any sense of self-preservation! She brandished her countless vines and thrashed them at him.

A cold glint flickered, and the vines were instantly sliced apart. However, her expression didn’t change at all. She didn’t necessarily have a lot of other things, but she had more than enough vines.

When he saw dozens more come after he sliced up a few, Wei Suo hacked at them with his blade again. However, he discovered that it didn’t do too much. The endless tentacles that were all around him made him think about what had happened just a moment before, which made him feel nervous. He was worried that the earlier tragedy would repeat itself and backed up to a safe distance.

Since they had already started fighting, Great Sister didn’t keep up the act anymore. I was going to play nice with you, but if that’s how you want it, that’s what you’ll get! As such, countless vines swept at Zu An and Qiu Honglei. With these two beautiful individuals, why would she still bother with that clown?

Qiu Honglei’s expression turned cold. She was about to attack when Zu An moved first.

A sharp blade of energy slashed through all the vines. At the same time, a burst of dazzling flames erupted. Whether in terms of power or scale, they greatly eclipsed the previous attacks.

“AHHH!” Great Sister screamed miserably. She brandished all of her tentacles to try and put the flames out, but no matter what she did, the flames seemed to stick to her. They quickly began to spread toward her main body.

Wei Suo widened his eyes. He had never expected to see such a strong energy blade! He thought, Boss is boss after all!

Great Sister was absolutely frightened. She gritted her teeth and cut off all the burning tentacles herself. Meanwhile, she began to burrow underground. However, Qiu Honglei quickly took out the Empress Lantern and shone it over her body, and she immediately stopped moving.

With a wave of Zu An’s hand, a streak of sword energy delivered a lethal blow. This thing looked so ugly, and judging from how it sucked out the blood of others, it was clearly a habitual criminal. He wouldn’t spare such a creature.

Great Sister screamed bitterly, “Grandmother won’t let you all go…” Afterward, she took her last breath.

Zu An felt as if his experience bar had increased a bit. However, that wasn’t what he was concerned about at the moment. He looked at Little Ying, who had followed them, and asked, “Grandmother?”

Little Ying just happened to see Great Sister being killed as she arrived. Her entire body started shaking. Fortunately, Zu An’s handsome face calmed her down a bit, and she said, “Grandmother is our master. When she came here for the first time, because she saw that Great Sister was of the same race as herself, she granted her a magical transformation. Great Sister was thus able to achieve a human form.”

“Grandmother is a tree spirit?” Wei Suo asked, turning pale with fright. If even the disciple was so disgusting, what kind of grotesque thing was the master? He recalled the romance in ‘A Chinese Ghost Story’. The grandmother there seemed to have been an ugly tree spirit too. He couldn't help but shiver.

Suddenly, an ice-cold voice called out, “Who dares to kill my disciple?!” Then, a terrifying aura sped in their direction.

Little Ying’s expression changed greatly. She said, “Big Sister was magically transformed by Grandmother, who left an imprint inside her. Grandmother would have found out about her death immediately. Oh no, here she comes! You all need to run!” She didn’t dare to stay there and quickly ran. She was clearly afraid of being brought down by them.

Zu An didn’t stop her either. Little Ying was quite the good-natured female ghost, so there was no need to trouble her. He thought, I’ll just ask that Grandmother for any information I need. She definitely knows more. As he sensed the aura getting closer and closer, he looked at Wei Suo with a smile, asking, “Should it be you or me who greets her this time?”

“Of course it’s boss!” Wei Suo exclaimed, having already hidden himself in a corner at the first sign of danger. 

Are you freaking kidding me? That tree spirit earlier was already nauseating to look at! Now, an old one is coming… Judging from the little one’s appearance, that Grandmother is definitely vicious and nasty.

If he experienced that again, perhaps he would just lose his interest in women altogether. This time, he didn’t think about the fantasy of dating a female ghost. He just wanted to stay away from those things as much as possible.

Zu An didn’t pay him too much mind. He sat at the very center of the room and calmly waited for Grandmother’s arrival. Qiu Honglei stood at his side while preparing to fight with him.

Soon after, a wild wind swept over. All of the trees near the temple began to rustle; something seemed to be rushing through them. Judging from the sound, it seemed to be many times more formidable than that Great Sister.

Soon after, the voice and the aura converged into a figure at the entrance. When he saw the appearance of that figure, the previously calm Zu An was stunned. Qiu Honglei was also stupefied. In the corner, Wei Suo’s eyes almost popped out.

The one who arrived was a woman dressed in an elegant gown. She had long wavy hair, snow-white skin, and red lips. Her figure was slender and graceful, and her features were delicate and beautiful. She was an incredible beauty! She had a unique air of glamor and grandeur.

The woman looked down at Great Sister’s remains. Her expression was cold as she asked, “Was it you who killed my disciple?”

Wei Suo’s jaw almost dropped to the ground. This ridiculously beautiful woman was Grandmother? He thought, If I had known it would be like this, I would have gone!

He immediately began to question life itself. Why is it that boss always faces incredible beauties, while I ended up meeting that disgusting thing?

…

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, there was a sole tavern in a small town. All those inside were looking toward a white-dressed woman seated there, looking aloof and transcendent like a goddess. When had such a small place as theirs ever seen such a beautiful woman before?

Yan Xuehen frowned slightly when she sensed the surrounding gazes. She had thought that this tavern was a good place for information, so she had gone over to see if anyone knew about Zu An’s whereabouts. Unfortunately, with how things were now, it didn’t seem as if she could get any decent information.
