Chapter 1805: One Gaze Ten Thousand Years

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman were both intelligent women. They quickly added, “We were entrusted with this task by Baogu, so we had no choice but to offend the immortal ruler. We hope the immortal ruler can forgive us.”

Are you kidding? Who would dare to argue against someone who gives off such a terrifying aura?

This couple could settle the grudge between themselves! The two women didn’t want to take on any needless blame.

Sure enough, when he heard the name Baogu, Immortal Ruler Baopu’s cold eyes flickered with a bit of emotion. He remarked, “So it was her. She hates me quite a bit, so those two slaps were deserved.”

The Ghost King’s eyes widened in disbelief.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

You’re a freaking immortal ruler, and yet you’re just going to let it go after they slapped you in the face? Are you really that lowly?!

He had been expecting the immortal ruler to slaughter Zu An’s entire group in a bloodbath, and smack Zhao Han to death in passing too. However, who could have thought that the two sides would actually come to an agreement?

This situation isn’t good for me!

He wanted to leave immediately, but he knew that doing so would only end up drawing attention to himself. He was worried that the immortal ruler would have a grudge against him, so he decided to just stay and observe the situation first.

Zhao Han’s brows furrowed deeply.

Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman actually knew the immortal ruler’s wife and even obtained her inheritance? Doesn’t that mean they’re the fated ones?

If the immortal opportunity ends up in their hands…

Zhao Han’s expression became cold. Either way, he had to obtain the immortal opportunity no matter what, even if gods or buddhas stood in his way.

Jing Teng suddenly asked excitedly, “Immortal ruler, has your respected self returned to life?”

Immortal Ruler Baopu’s gaze landed on her and smiled. He said, “So it was Little Teng. This is nothing more than a soul fragment I left behind…”

Zu An and Qiu Honglei exchanged a look. Jing Teng was close to Immortal Ruler Baopu, as expected.

Zhao Han was really moved. A soul fragment… Even though he wasn’t a match against a real immortal, he could still have a chance against a soul fragment.

The Ghost King’s eyes widened. If this was just a soul fragment, his Demonic Voice of the Ghost King would perfectly counter it. However, he was worried that it could still have other undisclosed skills and didn’t dare to act rashly.

Suddenly, Immortal Ruler Baopu’s expression changed. She asked, “Why are you so much weaker?”

Jing Teng replied, “It is all my fault for not following your respected self’s advice and having poor discernment with people.”

Immortal Ruler Baopu didn’t ask for more details. After a while, he said with a sigh, “I carried out a divination in the past and foresaw a great tribulation decreed by fate in your life. However, seeing as you have already arrived here, that must mean the extreme sorrow has turned to joy. You do not need to feel regret over this any longer.”

“Yes…” Jing Teng replied with a nod. Then, she walked over to Zu An’s side and said, “It was thanks to young master Zu’s help in escorting me. That was why I was able to arrive here safely.”

Qiu Honglei was speechless.

Am I just empty air to you? I even acted as a lightbulb to shine light on you not too long ago, you ungrateful wretch.

Even though she was unhappy, she knew this was a great turn of events for Zu An, so she obviously wouldn’t act up and say anything.

Both Zhao Han and the Ghost King were alarmed. Jing Teng was clearly saying those words to give Zu An more merit and have the immortal ruler think highly of him. The immortal ruler could very well just hand over the opportunity then and there.

That’s against the freaking rules! Is an immortal opportunity something that can be gained purely through knowing people?

Zhao Han’s eyelids twitched in irritation. When he first received information on Zu An in the past, one special ability of Zu An’s had been especially emphasized, which was that he was especially good at mooching. At first, Zhao Han hadn’t thought too much of it and thought to himself that personal strength was what was most important. What could one possibly achieve through just mooching off of women? And yet now, he realized that he was wrong, and gravely so!

Jing Teng secretly tugged on Zu An’s sleeves, gesturing for him to say something.

Zu An could only respectfully say, “I greet the immortal ruler!”

Immortal Ruler Baopu gave him a look. He couldn't help but nod, remarking, “An impressive and outstanding youngster.”

Qiu Honglei, Chu Chuyan, and Pei Mianman’s expressions all changed. Why did it seem as if the immortal ruler was picking a son-in-law now?

Suddenly, Immortal Ruler Baopu frowned and said, “It is a pity that he is too fickle in love and not a good match.”

Zu An and the women were all speechless.

Zhao Han and the Ghost King almost laughed out loud. They had been a bit envious of this brat for having women on all sides. Now, it had just ended up bringing him a disaster.

Jing Teng’s face turned completely red as she said, “Immortal ruler, I am just grateful that he brought me here. It is not what you are thinking.”

Immortal Ruler Baopu stroked his beard and chuckled, saying, “Everyone has their own destiny. You will know in the future.”

He didn’t explain further; instead, he turned to look at Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman, asking, “Could you two share the details of your meeting with Baogu with me?”

“Details?” Chu Chuyan repeated, feeling troubled. After all, admitting that she and Pei Manman had mutually saved each other would be a bit too humiliating.

Pei Mianman’s face also turned bright red. If it were just telling it to Ah Zu, that was fine, but there were so many outsiders here. She wasn’t that shameless.

Immortal Ruler Baopu realized something when he saw their expressions. He set up a barrier of light around them before saying, “Don’t worry; now they will not hear what you two have to say.”

They sighed in relief. Then, they bashfully shared everything that had happened from the Ghost King’s Glare of Eternal Slumber to the present.

Zu An immediately panicked when he saw the barrier surrounding the two women. However, Jing Teng quickly said, “Don’t worry, big brother Zu. The immortal ruler won’t trouble them.”

Zu An noticed that the barrier was almost transparent and could see that the two women were explaining something to Immortal Ruler Baopu; it was just that they couldn't hear what was being said. He sighed in relief.

Qiu Honglei’s ears perked up. Jing Teng had still been calling him young master Zu An a second before, and yet it was now already big brother Zu? She couldn't help but give Jing Teng a glance. It was hard to even tell who was older! Judging from Jing Teng’s experience, shouldn’t their party have been calling her ‘granny’?

She’s clearly already old, and yet she still calls a young man big brother. Truly shameless. Look at this cougar acting like a maiden.

…

Meanwhile, Zhao Han’s expression changed greatly. If those two women really ended up obtaining the immortal opportunity, he would just seize it from them if he had to. This soul fragment of Immortal Ruler Baopu wouldn’t be able to exist forever. So, as long as he threatened that brat, he refused to believe the two women wouldn’t speak.

The Ghost King noticed that something wasn’t right, because the two women had been hit by his Glare of Eternal Slumber before. They had then met Immortal Ruler Baopu’s wife… For some reason, he just felt that things were getting worse. He took the chance to turn into a cloud of black smoke and flee.

However, as soon as he arrived at the door, the bronze gate suddenly closed with a loud bang, leaving him confused and disoriented from the collision. He was locked in the room. He was completely stunned. What was going on? After all, in his current state, he should have been able to move straight through.

He was alarmed and quickly turned toward the copper coffin. The light surrounding Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman had already scattered, and Immortal Ruler Baopu was looking at him with an unpleasant expression.

“You actually ruined my final meeting with Baogu? You deserve death!” Immortal Ruler Baopu snapped.

The Ghost King had held back all this time, and yet this was what he got? With his domineering nature, he was starting to become angry as well. He remarked, “Hmph, if your original body were here, perhaps this king would carry some reservations. However, you are nothing more than a soul fragment. You can cease your empty boasts.”

As soon as he finished speaking, black smoke suddenly surged around him. Countless skulls appeared, and they all opened their mouths, releasing terrifying screams. A soul fragment was still a soul, after all, so it would no doubt be restrained by his skill.

“Demonic Voice of the Ghost King!” Zhao Han muttered in alarm, and quickly used the Human Emperor Seal to protect his soul.

Zu An’s group was also horrified. They had already witnessed just how powerful this skill was.

“This is fine,” Immortal Ruler Baopu said, remaining calm as he looked in the Ghost King’s direction.

The formless sound waves rushed toward him. However, when the demonic voice clashed against the barrier of light, a ripple spread across it, but was dispersed away in the end. The others were horrified. They hadn’t expected that demonic voice they were so scared of to be stopped so easily!

Zhao Han’s eyes widened in surprise. At that moment, the others likely hadn’t noticed because their cultivations were too low, but he had vaguely sensed the interweaving power of natural law.

Could it be that this is the path ahead for me?

The Ghost King had thought that he could fight a battle against the soul fragment, but who would have thought that the opponent would be so formidable? How could he still muster any will to fight further? A pair of hands emerged from the black mist to try to push the tomb door open and flee.

However, Immortal Ruler Baopu took a step forward. His eyes suddenly shone like brilliant stars, and his gaze completely surrounded all of the black mist and skulls.

“Noooo!” The Ghost King struggled frantically and screamed. The black mist created all sorts of terrifying techniques that bombarded the surroundings. Unfortunately, the space around him seemed to be blocked off. No matter how he attacked, he couldn’t break through the gaze surrounding him.

Zhao Han broke out into a cold sweat. It was precisely these attacks that had left him flustered a moment before, and he had only just barely managed to deal with them by relying on the Human Emperor Seal and all sorts of magic weapons.

No, many of these are skills the Ghost King didn’t even use before!

And yet, even though the Ghost King was going all out, he still couldn't do a thing against the immortal ruler’s soul fragment?

Immortal Ruler Baopu closed his eyes. A second later, all the black mist and skulls completely disappeared. With just a single look, the world’s most powerful expert, the ruler of Yin Yang Realm, had been subdued.

As he watched, Zu An was full of emotions. He suddenly felt as if he had opened the gate into a whole new world. So even the eyes could be used as a sword!
