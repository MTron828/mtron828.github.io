Chapter 373: Pursuit

Translator: Pika

Ji Dengtu's expression grew awkward. This turn of events had clearly made him feel ashamed as well. “I told you before that the Soul Return Pill is useful in most situations. However, there are some situations where it’s useless. This is clearly one of those few situations where it doesn’t work.”

Zu An couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

Damn you! Give me back my money!

He was well and truly pissed off. “Return me my money then! You scammed me out of so much money over such an unreliable item!”

Ji Dengtu jumped backwards. He said defensively, “I will never refund you the money! Absolutely not!”

Zu An grabbed his collar and roared, “Then save Madam Chu’s goddamned life!”

“Do you think I don’t want to?!” Ji Dengtu pushed him away. He walked over to the side and sat down, lighting a cigarette. The smoke drifted upward, obscuring his face.

Zu An wanted to say something else, but Ji Xiaoxi grabbed him. “Ah Zu, don’t disturb my father anymore. He is blaming himself for this too. He’s definitely trying to think of a way to save her right now.”

“Xiaoxi, do you think your father will be able to think of something?” Zu An asked impatiently.

Ji Xiaoxi shook her head and said quietly, “It’ll be hard. Considering how poorly Madam Chu is faring right now, the fact that she is still alive is already a miracle.”

Zu An despaired when he heard this.

He walked inside. Qin Wanru was lying peacefully on the bed.

Her eyes were closed. And her cheeks still held a tinge of redness, left over from the drug’s effects. Her figure was still as stunning as before, but her complexion was still pale because of her injuries.

Zu An was distraught. If something happened to Qin Wanru, what was he supposed to tell Chuyan? What was he supposed to tell Huanzhao?

Even if it hadn’t been for the sake of those two, his opinion of Qin Wanru had changed after being around her these past few days. He had come to realize that she wasn’t at all what he’d thought her to be.

After fighting side-by-side these few times, camaraderie had already been established between them. That was why he wasn’t willing to see her die, no matter what.

Ji Dengtu suddenly got up. “I’m going for a walk,” he said, his voice heavy.

He walked straight out without waiting for their reply. He didn’t even bother to look back.

Zu An was upset. “How can your dad still be in the mood to go for a walk at this time?”

“My father only goes out for a walk when he is extremely distressed,” Ji Xiaoxi explained. “He likes to walk around Hidden Dragon Mountain, outside the city. It’s more peaceful there, and the air is cleaner. Going for a walk often helps calm him down.”

Zu An recalled that Hidden Dragon Mountain was home to all manner of vicious beasts. It was a place that most people would never dream of going into. However, this guy treated the place like some sort of garden!

Ji Xiaoxi’s eyes suddenly reddened. “Before today, he would only go for a walk on the anniversary of my mother’s death.”

Zu An was stunned. “Your mother has already passed on? I’ve never heard you mention that before.”

Ji Xiaoxi said, “My mother had a difficult time giving birth to me, and then she...”

“Sorry. I shouldn’t have brought this up.” Zu An was surprised. Wasn’t Ji Dengtu a divine physician? Why would his wife pass away from a difficult birth? However, he didn’t want to pry further, since this was clearly a distressing topic for Ji Xiaoxi.

“It’s fine. I’m used to it.” Even though Ji Xiaoxi said this, her expression was still extremely bleak.

Zu An spread his arms. “Your mom is already gone, and now my wife’s mom is going to pass away soon. We are truly bound together by a common suffering. Why don’t we hug to comfort each other?”

Ji Xiaoxi laughed. “You’re really something, you know that? You still behave so indecently, even in this sort of situation.”

Zu An laughed. “You clearly have a misunderstanding about me! When have I ever been indecent?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ji Xiaoxi wasn’t upset at all, but giggled instead. “Thank you.”

“What are you thanking me for?” Zu An said.

Ji Xiaoxi said with a gentle voice, “I know you said that to make me feel better. I know that you’re feeling broken-hearted right now as well, yet you’re comforting me instead.”

Zu An sighed. “Xiaoxi, not only are you cute and lovely, you’re also truly kind and considerate. Your future husband is truly blessed.”

Ji Xiaoxi blushed instantly. “I’m not marrying anyone!”

She ran over to Qin Wanru’s side to tend to her after she said this. Even though there was nothing she could do to treat her, she could help to ease some of her current pain, and monitor her condition. If her condition worsened suddenly, she could promptly administer some medicine to keep her alive until her father returned.

Zu An didn’t dare place his hopes in Ji Dengtu. After all, Ji Xiaoxi had already said that there wasn’t much hope. He needed to find another way to save her on his own.

However, even the glorious Divine Physician Ji couldn’t do anything. What could he possibly do?

Right at this time, a loud knocking came from outside.

*Thud thud thud!*

*Thud thud thud thud!*

Knocking wasn’t the right word—it was more like a heavy pounding on the door.

“Open up!”

Ji Xiaoxi jumped in fright. She ran out and asked, “Who is it? It’s already so late. Please wait until morning if you need treatment.”

“No one is looking for treatment! We’re looking for someone!” A rude voice came from outside.

Ji Xiaoxi looked through a small gap between the doors, and her small face turned pale. She ran back to inform Zu An. “Ah Zu, there are people outside. I think they’re from the Chu clan, and they’re here to capture you!”

Zu An’s expression grew worried. He ran up to the door to sneak a peek as well.

Rows of guardsmen stood outside, and the one in the lead was none other than Chu Tiesheng. The dark circles around his eyes had become even darker, and his expression was truly ugly. Seeing his prey slip through his fingers had clearly infuriated him. He’d yearned for this goddess day and night, and yet he’d lost his opportunity forever! His mood was absolutely terrible.

Hong Zhong wasn’t far away. His hair was neatly combed, as usual. However, if one looked carefully, it wouldn’t be hard to notice that his hand was shaking a little. This was not out of fear, but rather a sign of nervousness and guilt.

How had they managed to track them to this place so quickly?!

It didn’t take long for Zu An to arrive at the answer.

Qin Wanru had been drugged and injured, so she definitely needed treatment. His close relationship with Xiaoxi was no secret, so it wasn’t too far-fetched for them to suspect him of coming here for help. This was clearly why they had immediately led their men here.

Hong Zhong had probably come personally because of his misgivings towards Ji Dengtu.

Hong Zhong was the number two expert after Chu Zhongtian in the Chu Estate. Of course, now that Chu Chuyan’s cultivation had soared, she might be able to challenge him for this position.

“You should expose the schemes of those two in front of everyone,” Ji Xiaoxi suggested. “There are so many guards outside. There’s no way all of them can be their accomplices, right?”

Zu An shook his head. “Xiaoxi, you are too innocent. You don’t know how evil these people are. If they dare to bring these people to hunt me down, they surely have complete confidence that they can control these men. Besides, Madam Chu is unconscious right now. Without her testimony, I fear that these two won’t admit to anything, no matter what I say.”

“Then what do we do? You should take Madam Chu with you and find a place to hide!” Ji Xiaoxi said urgently.

Zu An nodded. He ran over and picked Qin Wanru up. However, he immediately ran into a problem. “Where do I even hide?”

Ji Xiaoxi was at a loss as well. However, the pounding outside was getting louder and louder, and it sounded like the people outside might just barge in at any time. She didn’t have much time to think. She pointed and said, “Hide in my bed!”

Zu An was stunned. He didn’t know why she would suggest this, but the situation was clearly dire. His feet subconsciously took him in that direction.

He carried Qin Wanru into the room. With a loud crash, the door outside the courtyard was smashed in.

“What are all of you doing? Why has no one come to the door even after we knocked for so long?!” One of the guards gave Ji Xiaoxi a ferocious glare.

Ji Xiaoxi subconsciously took a step back in fear. However, Zu An and Madam Chu needed her protection right now. She stepped forward again and stuck out her chest. “How can you call that knocking? I thought you all were bandits trying to rob us in the middle of the night!”

Even though she tried to sound as fierce as possible, her lovely appearance and delicate voice lacked even a hint of intimidation.

Just then, Chu Tiesheng stepped forward. “Miss Ji, please excuse our behavior. We are currently searching for a traitorous brute from our Chu clan.”
