Chapter 1793: Laying Out All Cards

Zhao Han thought, Even I almost can’t f*cking hold on anymore! Like hell I’ll save you bastards!

However, he suddenly thought of something. With a wave of his hand in their direction, the two grandmasters were swept by an invisible force and could no longer maintain their center of gravity. They both fell toward the giant ghost face in midair.

“Zhao Han, you’ll definitely die a miserable death!” Both of them forgot their usual fear and cursed angrily.

However, they were experienced grandmasters and weren’t willing to die just like that. Perhaps because of Zhao Han’s attack, their connections with their bodies had stabilized a bit. Helpless to do anything else, they could only direct their most powerful skills at the giant ghost face. They knew that was precisely Zhao Han’s plan, but there was nothing they could do. After all, they couldn't just let themselves get eaten, right?

The Immortal Sword and Xuan Bajing’s eight swords bombarded the giant ghost face together. The two grandmasters’ attacks were even stronger than usual, but this was an attack with their lives on the line, so they didn’t hold back at all. At the same time, they also used all of their life-saving methods. The Immortal Sword formed a grand celestial palace, while the eight swords merged to become a massive, imposing sword. When two grandmasters attacked with all of their power at the same time, it resulted in an incredibly shocking sight.

Unfortunately, the giant ghost face suddenly opened his large mouth. With a single chomp, the celestial palace and imposing sword were both swallowed. Both Li Chansheng and Xuan Bajing were stupefied!

Before the two of them could do anything else, the Ghost King opened his mouth and inhaled. Their souls couldn't hold on any longer, and their warped figures were pulled into his mouth. Just like that, two glorious daoist grandmasters met their end.

However, their retaliation still bought Zhao Han a bit of time. He activated the Human Emperor Seal, sending it above himself. Strands of profound energy descended, covering his primordial spirit and flesh. The pressure immediately lessened and his primordial spirit returned to his body. Without a sliver of hesitation, he grabbed the Human Emperor Seal and vanished into thin air.

The Ghost King’s expression changed. He hadn’t expected his opponent to actually run. He couldn't even sense Zhao Han’s aura anymore, so he knew that further pursuit was meaningless. He remarked, “That human actually grasps the natural laws of space. I can’t be so careless the next time I meet him.”

The ghost face turned back into endless black mist and skulls before flying into the depths of the great tomb. Living beings turned into bleached bone wherever it passed.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An’s group had entered a narrow secret path. Only after they walked for a long time did things finally open up before them. There was no one else nearby, as they had clearly already entered the tomb’s depths.

As the wall closed behind them, Qiu Honglei asked worriedly, “They won’t chase after us through this path, will they?”

Those two were just far too frightening, to the extent that it made all of them feel a sense of powerlessness.

Jing Teng shook her head slightly and said, “Don’t worry. This tomb’s mechanism is always changing. Once a path is used once, it will change. The route behind us is gone.”

Zu An and Qiu Honglei clicked their tongues in wonder. They had never expected the great tomb to have such an ingenious design.

Qiu Honglei looked at Jing Teng in puzzlement, saying, “You keep saying you don’t have your memories, and yet you even remember these mechanisms in the tomb.”

Jing Teng clutched her head as if she were trying to remember something before saying, “I didn’t fool you all. My memories really are gone. It was just that I suddenly remembered a bit during that moment of crisis when I looked at the nearby wall.”

Zu An and Qiu Honglei exchanged a look. Judging from the way she was acting, she didn’t seem to be lying. However, wasn’t it just too much of a coincidence if she only remembered something at the crucial moment each time?

“I didn’t expect the glorious Xuan Bajing and Li Changsheng to die just like that,” Qiu Honglei said, sounding a bit sorrowful.

They had all seen the two grandmasters being sucked into the Ghost King’s mouth right before they left, and Qiu Honglei was still quite shocked. Zu An was a transmigrator, so he likely wasn’t as strongly affected, but she had grown up in the Devil Sect. Ever since she was little, she had been told just how despicable and powerful the big shots of the orthodox faction were. They were all the sworn enemies of the Devil Sect. Xuan Bajing and Li Changsheng were some of the strongest among those big shots, and they were individuals of equal reputation to her master. And yet, those two experts who had been at the very peak of their world had just been slaughtered like chickens here. The shock of seeing something like that was unprecedented.

“I wonder if Zhao Han was eaten by the Ghost King,” Zu An said gravely.

They had been in too much of a rush and hadn’t seen the conclusion of the battle. They had been planning to stick around to take advantage of the conflict, but the situation had suddenly become one-sided.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zu An’s expression grew even darker when he realized that, and he remarked, “Zhao Han normally seems so insufferably arrogant, and yet he ended up being so useless. He was beaten as if the Ghost King were his damn grandfather.”

Suddenly, a familiar voice called out, “What did you say?”

Zu An and the others were alarmed. When they looked in the direction of the voice, all of their fine hairs stood on end. They saw a yellow-robed man staring at Zu An coldly from not too far away. Who else could it be but Zhao Han?

“You… You… How…” Qiu Honglei stuttered nervously.

Even though Zhao Han had been bullied by the Ghost King, killing their party was still easy enough. They were all speechless. Like hell they were still going to fight! But they couldn't run away either.

Zu An was the first to calm down, saying, “Your majesty is formidable as expected. You were actually able to escape the Ghost King unscathed.”

Inwardly, he was cursing the Ghost King for being useless. Even if you couldn’t keep him there, you could have at least seriously injured him. Zhao Han is in freaking perfect condition, so I don’t stand a f*cking chance!

“Just now, who was it that cursed me for being beaten up like a grandson?” Zhao Han asked, giving Zu An a sidelong glance. His sarcastic grin was even stronger now.

“The Ghost King used his Demonic Voice of the Ghost King against a soul body, and yet he couldn't even remove a single corner of your majesty’s clothing. Of course he’s the grandson,” Zu An said without batting an eyelid.

Jing Teng looked at him with a strange expression. She hadn’t expected Zu An to turn around so naturally.

Qiu Honglei grinned as she recalled how when she first met Ah Zu, he had just been this… shameless. However, she then thought about their fate and couldn't smile anymore.

“So that move was called Demonic Voice of the Ghost King?” Zhao Han asked. He recalled the earlier battle and still felt some lingering fear. He had almost been swallowed whole by that guy. He looked at Zu An in confusion and said, “You seem to know a bit about his skills. Was it this Miss Jing who told you?”

Jing Teng shook her head. This was what Zu An had learned from interrogating Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick, the two ghost generals. Of course, there was no need for her to explain that to Zhao Han.

“Brat, you really are quite the talent,” Zhao Han said, sighing in admiration. After remaining quiet for a moment, he said, “Why don’t we put aside our differences for now and form an alliance?”

Qiu Honglei was stunned. In the eyes of everyone in their previous world, Zhao Han was invincible and untouchable. Who would have expected that he would seek someone else to ally with? Even if he did decide to seek allies, it should have been someone on the level of King Qi or the libationer. What was the meaning behind selecting someone as young as Zu An? Even though she knew her lover was really strong, she still found the offer a bit inconceivable.

Zu An was also a bit surprised, replying, “The two of us becoming allies? Your majesty, has your respected self let your judgment become clouded because of urgency? Do I have the right to fight side by side with you? That Ghost King is far above me. Facing him would be the same as throwing my life away.”

Zhao Han said with a snort, “There’s no need for you to put up that front with me. You definitely have the qualifications to face the Ghost King with me.”

Zu An remained on guard as he replied, “Your majesty, you really are overestimating me. If you don’t find it unappealing, I can shout from the sidelines as your cheerleader if you want me to. After all, even the powerful grandmasters Li Changsheng and Xuan Bajing had their souls sucked right out, so what would I be able to do?”

Zhao Han snapped in annoyance, “I don’t have the time to play these games with you. Others might not know about your ability, but I know it best. Otherwise, how else would the soul fragment I concealed in the crown prince’s body have died?”

Zu An felt goosebumps all over when he heard that. He instinctively prepared to fight to the death here.

“Don’t be nervous. Since I’m talking about that incident now, that means I’ve already let it pass,” Zhao Han said indifferently. “As long as you help me eliminate the Ghost King and find the immortal opportunity, we’ll just write off that grudge. The Fiend races could make you a Regent, so why can’t I? After all, once I ascend, the crown prince will be too ignorant and weak. He might not even be able to hold his position. You can just help him manage the empire.”

Qiu Honglei was incredibly shocked as she listened. The information contained in the conversation was extremely great!

Jing Teng was incredibly confused. Just what are they saying? Why can’t I understand any of it? Are they really people from a different world?

Zu An also put away his smile of contempt. He said seriously, “So your majesty already knew everything.” No wonder he had always felt as if Zhao Han bore killing intent against him the whole time.

Zhao Han harrumphed. “My soul fragment was with the crown prince, and it disappeared mysteriously. Even though you and the crown princess explained everything properly, I didn’t believe it at all. I watched the crown princess grow up and know she doesn’t have that kind of ability. That means the culprit naturally has to have been you.”

“You believed that was true purely based on a suspicion?” Zu An asked, feeling a bit confused.

“For an emperor, suspicion is enough. I would rather mistakenly kill a thousand than let one go,” Zhao Han said coldly.
