Chapter 1556: Death Courting Topic

Chu Chuyan quickly made her move. A longsword appeared in her hand, and cold frost condensed all around her, blocking all the crossbow bolts. Her body trembled, ki and blood surging violently; after all, the shots came from military crossbows with extremely great power. She didn’t hesitate even for a moment, grabbing Zu An and Sang Hong before jumping out through the shattered carriage wall. They would just be sitting ducks if they stayed in place.

However, the enemy seemed to have anticipated that such a thing would happen. A large, thick crossbow bolt flew at her, shrouding the group in terrifying energy. This one was different from the hail of bolts, however; it came from a city defense crossbow!

Chu Chuyan’s expression changed completely. After all, the power of a city defense crossbow could even break through a city wall! Furthermore, they were often supported by all kinds of complex formations that allowed them to lock onto their enemies. There was no way to avoid the bolt; they could only face it head on. Even though she was already at the ninth rank, she wouldn’t necessarily be able to stop the bolt, let alone while protecting two other people.

She was very confused. Military crossbows were all heavily regulated, and city defense crossbows were even higher priority. Other cities could collude with outsiders to use them that way, but wasn’t using one in a place as important as the capital equivalent to open rebellion? With a grave expression, she raised her longsword, planning to use the Snowflake Sword to intercept the bolt.

Even though she thought about many things, it all happened in the time it takes for sparks to fly off flint. The city defense crossbow’s bolt was about to reach them. The terrifying power it carried was enough to blast the entire area to smithereens.

Unlike Chu Chuyan, Zu An was no stranger to such weapons. After all, he had been ambushed by one before and lost half his life as a result. If not for the fact that his body was incredibly tough, reforged by the Primordial Origin Sutra, he wouldn’t even have been able to hold onto the other half of his life.

However, things were different now. Zu An drew his sword, unleashing a sharp wave of sword ki. The giant bolt with its terrifying aura was cut in half down the middle like tofu. The sword ki continued forward, blasting straight through the city defense crossbow cart hidden in a nearby home, not giving it a second chance to attack again.

The entire street fell silent; all those present were stunned. A bolt that massive had actually been cut through so easily?

Sang Hong had been a bit worried at first, but now his eyes were filled with shock. This kid became even stronger than before in the few months we were apart! No wonder he had such confidence, saying he could protect me.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Chu Chuyan was also somewhat stunned, because her master hadn’t really gone into detail about the trip. Thus, she hadn’t known how strong Zu An really was. On the contrary, when they reunited, she had discovered that there wasn’t any ki aura coming from Zu An’s body, making her worry that he had lost his cultivation. She had intended to protect him properly before, but now, it was hard to say who was protecting whom anymore.

The assassins around them snapped out of their daze. They released all their bolts and rushed out from their hiding places. They weren’t wearing black clothes and masks this time; instead, they were dressed in rough hemp clothes, just like the ordinary civilians living in the area. However, their expressions were nothing like those of ordinary civilians, the vicious looks in their eyes revealing that they weren’t real peddlers or carriers.

Chu Chuyan’s expression turned serious. In that instant, she had noticed that there were several eighth rank and ninth rank cultivators present. Such a force was already enough to make someone the boss of any given locality. She didn’t understand why they would be willing to act as assassins.

Even though she didn’t fear anyone in a one-on-one fight, the assassins seemed to excel in cooperation. They sealed off all paths of retreat, and the almost tangible killing intent coming from them made the air feel stiff.

Cooperative skills were often used by lower-level cultivators, especially in the army. Through teamwork, a group of lower-level cultivators could create a force capable of even taking on master rank experts. However, cooperative formations often required long years of training. Only then could the cultivators move and fight together seamlessly.

High-level cultivators all had their own pride, and they had their own methods to focus on. They usually didn’t have much time to train together with others for a long time. And yet, eighth and ninth ranked experts were actually fighting in unified formations, and so proficiently at that! Just who had the skill to raise so many high-level deathsworn soldiers?

Even though Chu Chuyan was shocked, she didn’t hesitate to move. She held her sword at the ready, her dress fluttering as her hair began to emanate an icy-blue radiance. She was about to use her most powerful skill to stake it all against her opponents. In such a situation, victory and defeat could be decided in an instant; holding back was meaningless.

Even though she saw that Zu An’s sword was exceptional, they were clearly outnumbered. Furthermore, their opponent excelled at formations, while the two of them could only fight together back to back. However, they could at least hold on until the City Defense Guards arrived.

Suddenly, however, Zu An brandished his sword. Seeing as he couldn't avoid them, he didn’t even bother trying. The swarming assassins felt as if they were going to go blind. Zu An’s sword was as dazzling as a sun, powerful and direct. It left them with nowhere to run.

Afterward… There was no ‘afterward’.

The assassins had been raised as deathsworn soldiers since they were young. They had received the best training and resources, as well as suitable cultivation methods. They had also worked incredibly hard, because in the cruel elimination system they had grown up under, they could only survive if they were stronger than their companions. The house never raised trash.

Of course, as their cultivation ranks rose, their minds had become more open too. After all, eighth and ninth rank cultivators were all powerful figures in the outside world. Who was willing to spend their lives as a deathsworn soldier forever?

However, they had received constant reminders of the ice-cold reality that awaited. Some of their companions had felt as if they could make it on their own and tried to escape, but they had been fed poison when they were young. When they betrayed the house and didn’t receive the antidote, the suffering they went through had made them wish they were dead instead. Since that incident, the rest had never dared to have such thoughts again.

Of course, in order to appease them and avoid obstructing their cultivation and enthusiasm, the deathsworn had been promised that as long as they completed this mission, they would be sent to become local officials. They could also marry and have children then. The glory that awaited had filled them with motivation. 

We just need to complete this mission…

Another brother from the house was supposed to have come along, but when he heard that promise, he had immediately chosen to take on another mission, claiming that such promises were very ominous. At the time, everyone else had laughed at him for being cowardly, but now, they knew that he was the one who was truly wise. Unfortunately, they didn’t even have a chance to feel regret anymore.

When she saw the fallen corpses, Chu Chuyan was a bit stunned. There were so many horrifying assassins present, and yet they had been dealt with in an instant?

A middle-aged man, who had been hiding in the shadows with his sword drawn, widened his eyes. His jaw almost dropped to the ground. He swore, “F*ck this! I thought my cultivation was already pretty fast, but how can it compare to this brat’s? No way, no way, I won’t go even if you pay more. I’m running away!” He quickly pulled his conical bamboo hat down over his face, then left through a secret path.

If Zu An had seen him, he would have recognized the assassin as ‘Cash Warrior’ Ding Run, whom he had met during the Brightmoon City escort mission. In the last few years, Ding Run had already earned quite a few resources and several opportunities, thus breaking through into the master rank. He had thought that this assignment would pay handsomely, and yet he had almost lost his life in the process.

Zu An patted the dazed Chu Chuyan and said, “Let’s go.” Then, he picked up Sang Hong and continued toward the Imperial Palace.

Along the way, Chu Chuyan secretly sized up Zu An several times. A blush appeared on her face from time to time. Back in Brightmoon City, she had always put on the appearance of a capable woman, but deep down, she was a young lady who liked to dream. At first, when she had been married to this ‘trash’ husband, she had felt tremendous disdain. But now, when she looked at him, why did she feel that he was a bit like the sword immortal protagonist of ‘Dominating Sword Immortal’s Ninety-Nine Days of Searching For Love’?

No wonder master didn’t tell me about what happened in the secret dungeon. She was scared that it would affect my dao heart and affect my conviction for cultivation!

Master really was worried about too many things. He’s not some random person; he’s my husband!

…

The group quickly arrived at the Imperial Palace. Chu Chuyan remained outside, while Zu An brought Sang Hong inside. He first arranged for a proper place for Sang Hong to stay, then headed straight to the Imperial Study.

Just then, he happened to run into Eunuch Wen, who was shocked to see him return. The eunuch said, “Sir Zu came at a good time. His majesty was about to send for someone to summon you to have an audience with him.”

Zu An was stunned. The emperor already found out about what happened so quickly?

As expected of an earth immortal!

He sensed the fragrance of sandalwood wafting through the air when he entered the Imperial Study. The emperor’s eyes were closed in meditation.

Zu An was about to mention Sang Hong when the emperor suddenly asked, “So… what do you think about the Crown Princess?”
