Chapter 532: What Exactly is Being Tested?

Translator: Pika

Zu An turned around and saw a young lady lying next to him. He couldn’t see her face clearly because of the long back hair falling across her face in waves. However, when he got up and the sheets fell off his body, it left a rather large expanse of snow white skin exposed.

Even though he only caught a glimpse, he could already imagine her seductive figure. Her skin was glowing, and absolutely captivating. Zu An immediately felt his body grow stiff.

“Something’s not right with this opening!”

Zu An swallowed, and began to ponder hard.

According to Ya Zhang’s description, no one had ever passed this trial before. That meant that this trial was probably extremely dangerous, yet the environment he found himself in was ridiculously extravagant, and did not seem dangerous at all.

Was the greatest danger of this trial the woman beside him?

Setting a honey trap against me? Oh man, this is super effective…

Wait, where’s Big Manman?

This sudden thought made his expression warp. He looked all around him, but aside from the young lady next to him, there wasn’t another person in sight.

Wait, these spectacular waves look somewhat familiar.

The young lady next to him moaned in a charming fashion. She was about to wake up.

The sound came out of her so naturally, like a cool breeze blowing between the mountains, the song of an oriole, and even a hint of sultry seduction. It was enough to make any man’s heart go wild.

Zu An’s entire body went rigid. He felt as if he was about to explode. However, there was something else that he was considering: How was he supposed to explain the current situation to her?

This is just like the beginning of a damn soap opera! Wait, no… a soap opera wouldn’t dare let the actors really go this far.

The young lady gradually woke up. She sat up subconsciously, and seemed just about to look around her.

But she suddenly sensed the chill on her chest, and swiftly realized that she wasn’t covered at all.

She screamed in alarm and covered her chest, but there was no way her dainty fingers were enough to cover those majestic peaks.

Zu An felt his nose grow terribly hot. It felt as though blood might gush out at any time.

By now, though, he had already recognized who she was. He laughed and said, “You know, in this sort of situation, the first thing you should cover is your face.”

The young lady realized that a man was beside her, and was just about to go crazy when she recognized his familiar and playful voice. She was overcome with surprise and joy. “Ah Zu?”

Zu An smiled. “Big Manman, it’s me~”

He wanted to exchange a warm gaze with her, but his eyes were sucked downwards, as though drawn by a magnet.

Pei Mianman noticed his gaze moving, and her devastatingly charming face flushed completely red. Her beautiful peach-blossom eyes were shrouded with a watery mist.

“Do you like them?” Her voice sounded even more lovely than usual.

“I do…” Zu An nodded subconsciously, but quickly realized what he’d said and frantically tried to explain himself. “Um… I wasn’t looking on purpose! When I woke up, we were already like this…”

He knew that the women of this world cared a lot about their chastity. Even though Pei Mianman was usually flirtatious and charming, he knew that it was just a front. She was actually still a maiden. Now that a man had seen all of her, she might be furious and ashamed.

Before he could finish blurting out an excuse, a soft finger pressed against his lips. “You dummy, what are you getting so nervous about? Do you see me accusing you?”

“Huh?” Zu An blinked. His mind couldn’t process what was happening.

Pei Mianman slowly leaned into him. She pressed her cheek against his chest, and she said with a gentle voice, “I was about to go mad when I woke up and realized that I was naked, with a man beside me. I was just about to kill him when I realized that it was you.”

“So what if it’s me?” Zu An felt his heart racing as he took in her beautiful fragrance, and he subconsciously wrapped his arm around her shoulder.

The feel of her bare skin under his hand made him feel as though he was in heaven.

Pei Mianman pursed her lips, then tilted her head up to look at him. “If it’s you, then I’m okay with it.”

“Manman…” Zu An felt his entire body go rock solid when he heard her affectionate words, and even the softest parts deep within him were touched as well.

Pei Mianman smiled sweetly when she saw his astonished expression. “You dummy, we already established our relationship outside. What’s up with that look?”

Zu An chuckled and said. “This blessing came so abruptly that I didn’t have time to react.”

Pei Mianman snorted. “You woke up first. Why didn’t you wake me up as well? I was given a fright for nothing.”

Zu An stared at her and mumbled, “Your face was covered by your hair, and I really didn’t recognize you with your clothes off…”

Pei Mianman was speechless. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Both ashamed and furious, she hit him with a playful punch.

Zu An fought back just as playfully. As their bodies pressed against each other, the both of them began to heat up.

In the end, Zu An grabbed her hands, and Pei Mianman also stopped moving. Her large, misty eyes stared straight at him, full of tenderness and affection. There was no mistaking her intent.

Staring at her soft, red lips, Zu An could no longer hold himself back. He slowly moved closer.

Pei Mianman’s entire body went rigid when she sensed him coming nearer to her. However, she relaxed just as quickly, and stayed where she was. She slowly closed her eyes.

Pei Mianman’s entire body trembled when she sensed his lips. It was as if electricity was flowing through her entire body. Her arms moved subconsciously to envelop him.

Sweethearts who have just established their relationship were all like this, fully immersed and affectionate as they shared their kiss.

After what seemed like forever, their lips finally parted. Pei Mianman’s cheeks were rosy, and her voice grew gentler and more lovely. “Your sword is pressing against me.”

Zu An’s face went red. He didn’t know how to explain himself.

But Pei Mianman was also quick to react to what was happening. Both of them were naked in the same bed. How could he possibly have a sword with him?

She lifted a corner of the covers to take a look, and her peach-blossom eyes immediately grew even more misty.

Zu An was just about to say something when Pei Mianman giggled. “I was wondering why all of the boys in the academy were acting so strangely after making their way out of the Ursae Dungeon. Some rumors were spreading, and I even caught a few of them to interrogate them, but not a single one dared to speak. Now, I finally know why.”

Zu An blushed with shame. This woman really was tough! She had actually captured some other students and interrogated them about this!

Pei Mianman’s face turned pink when she said this. She snorted and said, “No wonder those men called you a donkey. I thought they were cursing you back then, but now…” Her words dissolved in a fit of giggles.

Zu An was upset. “You evil witch, are you taunting me? If I lose control, you’ll have to bear the responsibility!”

Pei Mianman leaned into his embrace. She twirled a strand of hair between her fingers. “I’ll bear the responsibility.”

Zu An’s heart was beating fiercely. He wasn’t entirely sure what she meant.

Once again, Pei Mianman lifted a corner of the covers. She gasped and said, “Wow… how did Chuyan’s delicate body take on such a monster?”

How could Zu An still possibly hold himself back? He rolled and pressed himself down on her, looking straight into her eyes. “Won’t you know once you give it a try?”

Pei Mianman looked back at him with her misty eyes. “You dummy, I’ve already told you that I’m yours. Why are you hesitating?”

Zu An let out a bestial roar. He pressed his lips against hers and kissed her passionately.

…

A while later, Pei Mianman’s beautiful brows knit together in a frown. Her charming face showed the barest hint of pain. She pressed a hand against his chest and said, “Hold… hold on…”

“What’s wrong?” Zu An was about to curse. My bowstring is pulled all the way back and ready to fire! Are you trying to kill me?!

The sensation of pain had triggered another thought in Pei Mianman’s mind. “Ah Zu, aren’t we still in a trial?”

Zu An nodded. He remembered the reason why they were here as well.

Pei Mianman pursed her lips for a moment, then asked him a few small secrets only the two of them knew about. When he answered every one correctly, she sighed and said, “I was worried that I might have fallen for some sort of illusion. That’s why I had to confirm your identity first.”

Zu An chuckled and said, “Manman, you really are sharp.” At the same time, he was a little perplexed. What exactly was this trial supposed to be about? Could it be that this trial really was a honey trap?
