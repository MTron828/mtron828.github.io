Chapter 1602: Remarry

Zhao Xiaodie was shocked and angry, not having expected her good intentions to be rewarded with an angry reprimand from Zhi Yin instead.

Zhi Yin was handsome, and he was also Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s most talented disciple. He was quite popular among the sect’s women. Furthermore, he had taken care of Zhao Xiaodie when she was new to the sect, which was why had a good impression of him. Even though it wasn’t to the point of feeling love, she still attached more importance to him than other men.

She saw that Zhi Yin felt anger and great pain. When she thought about how, back when she had arrived at the Heavenly Sorrow Sect, Zhi Yin had been at Chu Chuyan’s beck and call but received only cold treatment in return, she hadn’t been able to hold herself back from speaking up against the injustice.

“Are you yelling at me right now?” Zhao Xiaodie replied with a scowl. After all, she was the daughter of King Qi, someone of noble status. When had she ever experienced such treatment before?

After Zhi Yin shouted at her, he saw several other people looking at him and was inwardly shocked. Only then did he snap out of his daze and quickly apologize. “Sorry, junior sister. I didn’t do that on purpose. That wasn’t what I meant; I must have just become a bit absent-minded…”

After Zhi Yin’s panicked explanation, Zhao Xiaodie’s expression finally eased a bit.

Meanwhile, Guan Chouhai took in the sight. He couldn't help but sigh. It seems this disciple of mine is following the same disastrous path as his master.

In this world, what is love…

He couldn't help but give Yan Xuehen a look. Her skin was fine like jade, and her beauty was simply outstanding. Furthermore, she seemed to look even more mature and stunning than ever. That sensation seemed to exist in harmony with her aloof and untainted beauty. How could there be a woman so perfect?

When she sensed Guan Chouhai’s scorching gaze, Yan Xuehen was unhappy. As such, she asked King Yan for permission to excuse herself. Due to her nature, she had never liked such gatherings to begin with. If Zu An hadn’t arrived, she would have long since left.

King Yan naturally tried to stop her, but when he saw that she remained unmoved, he could only say with a sigh, “In that case, this king will see off Goddess Yan.”

Xie Daoyun couldn't help but move closer to Zu An. She quietly asked, “Sect Master Yan really is an outstanding individual among those of the previous generation. My dad was apparently infatuated with her at one point in time too. My mom was pretty jealous over it for a while.”

Zu An was a bit surprised, replying, “Huh? If I’m not mistaken, didn’t City Lord Xie used to like Yu Yanluo?”

In truth, there weren’t many men from that generation who hadn’t liked Yu Yanluo.

“Aren’t men all like that? If they see a pretty woman, they fall in love with them,” Xie Daoyun said, and then her face reddened. She said in embarrassment, “Big brother Zu, I’m not criticizing you here. I know you’re not like that.”

Zu An was speechless, thinking, Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo are both women whom men from the previous generation dreamed about. If they found out what kind of relationship I have with the two of them, I’d probably be hunted down by all of the big shots of the world, right?

Yan Xuehen refused King Yan’s urging for her to stay and left. Chu Chuyan was a bit reluctant, but she didn’t dare to go against her master’s words. She could only give Zu An an apologetic look.

Zu An wasn’t in that much of a rush. Being able to meet them here was already an unexpected joy. Either way, as long as they were in Yi Commandery, there would be more than enough opportunities for them to meet.

Guan Chouhai also got up to leave when he saw Yan Xuehen leave. Additionally, when they saw Chu Chuyan leave, Zhi Yin and the others immediately felt as if the evening banquet had become dull and senseless. They naturally followed their sect master out.

Zu An also took the chance to leave. If Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan both left, staying behind with these old foxes would only leave him tired. After all, he and King Yan found each other irritating.

Even though King Yan acted as if he wanted Zu An to stay on the surface, those with discerning eyes could tell that there was much less sincerity than when he had tried to keep Yan Xuehen.

After leaving King Yan Manor, Zu An initially planned to look for the two girls, but Zhang Jie and the other Yi Commandery officials sought him out, trying to get closer to him. They had felt a bit of disappointment when they saw that he didn’t retaliate at all against Sun Xun’s mockery. However, after seeing how tough he had been in the king manor, they immediately changed their attitudes.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Local officials represented the interests of the court, and were used by the emperor to keep the local kings or other nobles in check. As such, they didn’t get along with King Yan. It would be one thing to go against weaker kings or nobles, but against the powerful ones such as King Yan, their work as local officials became very difficult. As they had finally met the kind of court representative they longed for, they naturally had to use him to change the situation.

Zu An felt quite helpless. He had no way to chase these people away and could only respond to them. By the time he was done, Yan Xuehen and Chu Chuyan had long since left.

Along the way, Zhang Jie invited them to stay in his side courtyard. The conditions there were much better than they would be at a relay station.

Naturally, Zu An tactfully declined. The first reason was that he couldn't really tell what this man’s motives were, and didn’t want to rashly make a decision that would leave him bound up in the same camp. The second was that he had many secrets too. If he lived in Zhang Jie’s courtyard, the maids and servants would all be keeping an eye on him.

Zhang Jie didn’t force the issue, and personally accompanied Zu An to Yi Commandery’s relay station and arranged the best room for him. 

…

When Zu An finally managed to see off all the officials, he sat down on a chair and released a long sigh.

“It must have been tiring to greet and see off all those officials,” Xie Daoyun said with a smile. She took a porcelain bottle from her waist and poured out a small blue pill, dissolving it into a cup of water. “This is Sobering Relief Tea. Please give it a try, big brother Zu.”

“I really do feel even more tired than after a great battle,” Zu An said, taking the teacup. When he smelled its refreshing fragrance, he felt his spirits immediately being roused. He remarked, “Little sister Ling’er really is ingenious, making this Sobering Relief Tea into a pill that can be carried with you.”

“That can’t really be helped,” Xie Daoyun said as she sat down next to him. Her waist and back were perfectly straight, truly giving off the air of a distinguished daughter from a refined family. “My father often needs to deal with social niceties and comes back drunk as mud. That little brother of mine always causes trouble, often coming back dead drunk from brothels. A long illness makes a patient into a good doctor, in the end. That was how I created this Sobering Relief Pill. Actually, I’m quite grateful to little sister Xiaoxi. If not for her help, I wouldn’t have had the skill to create it at all.”

“Ji Xiaoxi?” Zu An asked, stunned. That young and tender girl appeared in his mind. He couldn't help but feel warm inside.

“Yup. Her father is a divine physician, after all, even though his temperament is a bit strange. Fortunately, Xiaoxi isn’t like her father and has a kind nature. She went out of her way to help me make this,” Xie Daoyun. When she thought of that girl, who was like a cute little sister, a smile spread across her face.

Zu An thought about the time when he encountered a huge disaster and was arrested by the Embroidered Envoy. Ji Xiaoxi had given him some medicine, pretending to kiss him to do so… He wondered whether she was doing well. There was also the adorable Huanzhao; was she still fretting over cultivation every day in the academy?

Sigh, it’s a pity that I’ve never had a chance to return to Brightmoon City!

“Big brother Zu? Big brother Zu?” Xie Daoyun suddenly called out to him several times in confusion.

“What were you asking about?” Zu An asked, sounding apologetic. She seemed to have been saying something, but his mind had been elsewhere.

Xie Daoyun  blushed. After some hesitation, she still said, “You met Miss Chu again today. Your relationship seems to be really good. Why don’t you two… remarry?”
