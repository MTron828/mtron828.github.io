Chapter 1660: Interrogation

“It seems a bit like Devil Sect Master Yun Jianyue’s Crescent Ring,” Guan Chouhai muttered.

“It is a bit similar, especially with all of the killing intent,” Wan Tongtian said with a frown. The dense killing intent clearly made them uncomfortable.

…

As the others were talking to each other, Wang Wuxie had his own thoughts. He didn’t involve himself in the conversation.

Yun Jianyue frowned slightly when she heard them mention her name, but she wasn’t too worried. Qiu Honglei had never used these blades before in the world of warriors, so she wasn’t scared of them finding out anything.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

She suddenly heard Zu An’s voice call out, “This is far from Sect Master Yun’s Crescent Ring.”

Yun Jianyue raised her brows. She looked at him with an ambiguous smile.

“Oh? I’ve heard that Sir Zu faced Sect Master Yun in the past. You must have a very deep impression,” Wang Wuxie said as he looked at Zu An. As the State Teacher, he naturally knew more about court matters than his fellow daoists. Zu An had been famous during the Imperial Palace invasion, and then enjoyed a meteoric rise in the Eastern Palace.

However, when Wang Wuxie had first seen that Zu An didn't have even the slightest bit of ki fluctuations around his body, he assumed that Zu An had lost all of his cultivation in the Fiend races’ territory from his serious injuries. How could he have known that this kid was even more formidable than the rumors said?

The other sect masters all looked at Zu An. They hadn’t expected him to have already faced Yun Jianyue!

“We indeed had a deep interaction…” Zu An said with a reminiscent smile.

Yun Jianyue’s face reddened. What is this damn brat thinking right now?

Yan Xuehen gave him a confused look. Why do those words sound so strange?

“That witch has always been cold-blooded and ruthless. The fact that Sir Zu was able to keep your life after facing her is quite a rare experience,” the White Jade Sect’s Li Changsheng said, sounding deeply moved.

Yun Jianyue narrowed her eyes. This damn White Jade Sect is always opposing me. I should pay them a visit one day, and let them experience what it really means to be cold-blooded and ruthless.

Wan Tongtian laughed heartily and said, “I was able to see Sir Zu fight. It’s not all that surprising for him to be able to escape from that witch’s clutches at all.” Since Zu An had helped him before, he had quite a good impression of him.

“Witch?” Yun Jianyue muttered with a dangerous expression. Still, seeing as he was praising Zu An, a smirk appeared on her lips. She couldn't bring herself to get angry.

“She’s actually not as scary as you’re all making her out to be. She looks pretty fierce on the surface, but she’s actually quite soft inside,” Zu An said, speaking up for her. He just didn’t feel all that great listening to others talk badly about her.

Yan Xuehen gave him a look, then shifted her gaze. They had all fought together while risking their lives, so it wasn’t that surprising for him to speak in such a way.

However, the others didn’t think the same way. Their expressions all changed as they said, “Sir Zu, please speak cautiously. That witch is absolutely heartless, an absolute criminal wanted by the court. Please remember to not make friends with her at all costs.”

Wan Tongtian, who carried good intentions for Zu An, emphasized further in a sincere tone, “Indeed, Sir Zu, those witches are best at deceiving people. Do not let yourself be fooled by that side of theirs.”

Zu An frowned. In the end, he didn’t say anything else. His time in the online forums of his previous world had taught him how difficult it was to convince others. These people’s impressions were already set in their ways and they couldn't coexist with the Devil Sect. Anything he said here would be meaningless.

However, Yun Jianyue was completely amused. She thought to herself, This kid is surprisingly loyal. I… My disciple didn’t choose the wrong person.

…

Meanwhile, there were new developments happening on stage. With the emergence of Qiu Honglei’s curved blade, both her weapon and her entire figure began to flicker with overlapping afterimages.

Wu Xiaofan was shocked. What kind of skill was this? Which one was her real self?

Qiu Honglei’s blade sliced outward. A line of explosions erupted across the entire stage. Wu Xiaofan didn’t dare to take the attack head-on and quickly dodged; a huge groove instantly appeared in the spot he had been standing on. The entire stage was almost sliced in two.

Feng Wuchang was heartbroken over how much money they were going to lose, even as he worried for Wu Xiaofan. The power of his opponent’s sword was actually so great! It was clearly a heaven-grade weapon at the very least. Would Xiaofan be able to stop it?

When they saw Wu Xiaofan evade in a panic, the spectators erupted into discussions. Even though he was injured, the Green Scale Armor made up for that. And yet, he was still being pressured right now! Wasn’t this Peng Wuyan a bit too strong?

On Zhao Xiaodie’s side, she couldn't help but frown. She gave Zhi Yin an inquiring look and said, “Senior brother, master rank cultivators can anticipate attacks beforehand with their souls. Shouldn’t all those under the master rank be easily crushed? Why does the current situation almost seem backward?”

Zhi Yin replied with a sneer, “Do you really still believe that Peng Wuyan is only at the mid-stage of the ninth rank?”

Zhao Xiaodie was stunned, saying, “But the test previously said…”

Zhi Yin shook his head and added, “She probably used some kind of skill to hide her cultivation. I believe that was precisely to catch us off guard.”

He felt even worse when he thought about how he had been kicked out beforehand. In order to make sure that this pretty junior sister of his didn’t look down on him, he added, “Actually, the idea of master rank cultivators overwhelming all those beneath that cultivation stage only applies to ordinary ninth ranks. For representative disciples like us from the great sects, we all have special ways of weakening the soul advantage of master ranks. I believe the others also have that ability.”

“Senior brother is incredible!” Zhao Xiaodie exclaimed; she was sincere in her admiration. As someone who was also from the Heavenly Sorrow Sect, she knew just how strong Zhi Yin was. These people were proud of themselves, and had enjoyed countless miraculous encounters ever since they were young. Meanwhile, challenging opponents above their current cultivation rank was something others wouldn’t even dream of doing.

…

Wu Xiaofan was left with no choice. He could only enlarge his staff. Whenever he swung it, it was as if a mountain crashed down.

He knew that he would only be worn out quickly if he continued like this and could even collapse from his injuries, but he didn’t dare to show any hesitation either. He had already mustered all of his fighting spirit. If he didn’t face her with his full power, he even suspected that he could be cleaved in two by that blade. Even though he had the Green Scale Armor covering him, he still didn’t have much confidence when he sensed the opponent’s overwhelming killing intent.

Is this woman really from the righteous faction? Why does she have such a sinister weapon?

As the massive staff came at her, Qiu Honglei didn’t dodge this time. Instead, she brought her curved blade straight down. A blade beam, filled with killing intent that almost seemed tangible, emerged. It actually sliced the massive staff image apart!

“What?!” Wan Guiyi exclaimed as he stood up. He had faced Wu Xiaofan before, so he naturally knew that the staff was a projection of ki, but it was so powerful it felt real. Back then, even his own sword ki couldn't slice through that staff, and yet this woman had managed to accomplish it!

As expected of the woman I appreciate! Her entire figure gives off the aesthetic of strength!

Wu Xiaofan was also stunned when he saw his staff projection sliced through. He had no choice but to continuously back up. He retreated all the way to the edge of the stage, where he had nowhere left to run.

“This Wu Xiaofan is no good too. Everyone praises him as if he’s some deity, and yet he’s been beaten up like this by a woman.”

Even though the truly strong understood how powerful the two competitors were, there were far more ordinary disciples. They weren’t on the stage, so they couldn't really understand what Wu Xiaofan was going through. They just saw him being forced back again and again. Furthermore, when they remembered all the rumors about how strong he was, they immediately developed feelings of contempt, as if they could do better if they stepped up themselves.

Wu Xiaofan turned a deaf ear to these remarks. His gaze was steady as a burst of violet ki suddenly surged around him.

“Mist of Violet Ki!”

The sect masters on the elevated section looked at Wang Wuxie in shock. They hadn’t expected him to have already passed on his ultimate skill to his disciple! Furthermore, because of Wu Xiaofan’s exceptional talent, he had actually learned it.

Wang Wuxie continued to observe the situation on the stage without any noticeable changes in emotion.

With the support of the violet ki, even the winds around the massive staff carried hints of violet luster now. One strike after another, it smashed apart Qiu Honglei’s sword ki.

“That’s more like it! How could Wu Xiaofan possibly have an undeserved reputation?!” many of Wu Xiaofan’s supporters immediately cried out in excitement.

Qiu Honglei rubbed the bruise on her arm. It had just been brushed by that staff, and yet it had made half of her body numb. Her expression was cold as she suddenly raised her hand. A layer of dazzling light covered the surface of the curved blade.

“Could it be that she still has some other secret move that she hasn’t used yet?” the disciples exclaimed as they all extended their necks.

“Huh? Why did her blade disappear?” Zhao Xiaodie exclaimed. She had also been watching the fight closely. She suddenly cried out in alarm.

Only then did the spectators see that after the light passed, the blade in Peng Wuyan’s hands had disappeared.

On the stage, Wu Xiaofan was both nervous and vigilant. Violet ki surged all around him, as if he was guarding against something.

A moment later, a spatial rift suddenly appeared in front of him. Only those who were close to him could see that countless stars appeared within that spatial rift. It was like a portal that led to a galaxy beyond. In an instant, a terrifying blade of light slashed outward from the rift. It almost instantly sliced through all of the violet ki around Wu Xiaofan, then crashed into the Green Scale Armor he wore.

Boom!

A deafening noise resounded. A blast of bloody mist erupted from Wu Xiaofan’s body. The famous Green Scale Armor was left with a clear crack, and soon grew dim. Wu Xiaofan himself was knocked off the stage by a tremendous force, and his body fell heavily to the ground. He struggled to raise his head, but he still fainted in the end.

The entire place fell dead silent.

All the spectators looked at the woman on the stage. What kind of monster was this? She had defeated Wu Xiaofan without even any visible injuries on herself, other than being a bit out of breath! Even though Wu Xiaofan was injured, her performance was a bit too absurd, right? Why did such a woman previously not have any reputation among the daoist sects at all?

The Righteous Sun Sect’s people hurriedly rushed forward. When they saw that Wu Xiaofan had only fainted from serious injuries and that there was no risk to his life, they all sighed in relief. Wang Wuxie remained on the elevated area and didn’t head out, however.

Meanwhile, the spectators all congratulated Yun Jianyue. Now that Emptiness Isle had such a talented disciple, they were destined for a glorious path ahead of them! The pupil could even surpass the master, raising their sect to the point of becoming the leader of the daoist sects!

“Not at all, not at all. We were just lucky, haha~” Yun Jianyue humbly replied, although she was practically unable to suppress her laughter. The feeling of seeing these daoists who normally cursed her to death now congratulating her really wasn’t bad at all. She wondered just what kind of amazing reactions they’d have if the truth was revealed one day.

Wang Wuxie suddenly said, “If I recall correctly, that blade is the Moon Demon Blade used by the Devil Sect’s Great Demon Ding Tianle a century ago. It is an important treasure of the Devil Sect. Why would it end up in Lady Peng’s hands?” He stared at her with his sharp eyes as he spoke.
