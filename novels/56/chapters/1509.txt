Chapter 1458: I Wouldn’t Mind Being Called Master

Mo Xi knew Zu An was talking about the puppet from before. However, now that they had merged into one, they were already one person. This kid really is outrageous. He actually dares to claim to be my master?!

Meanwhile, Xia Jie was thinking, This noble’s wife became your servant?

Absolutely preposterous!

As such, they both stopped fighting at the same time and rushed at Zu An, looking as if they were about to tear him to shreds.

However, both of them stopped again because a red bow suddenly appeared in his hands. It swirled with an aura that made their hearts shudder. It was an air of world-destroying power. Not too long before, they had sensed that the suns fell from the heavens precisely because of that same power.

Great one, we’re sorry for disturbing you!

It just so happened that the two both backed up at the same time.

Zu An also broke out into a cold sweat. He really had been dancing around the gates of hell for the sake of some Rage points!

“We share no grudges with you two. Let’s just mind our own business,” Zu An said. He gestured toward Yun Jianyue and the other women, and they slowly withdrew into the distance. It was clear that Xia Jie and Mo Xi wouldn’t necessarily fight against each other if the group remained present.

When they withdrew to a hidden place some distance away, Yan Xuehen quietly asked, “Will they continue fighting?”

After all, now that the two had seen that Zu An had something that could threaten them, they wouldn’t necessarily decide to fight to the death. If they hadn’t completely lost their minds, they had to know that they couldn't put themselves in a situation where a third party could take everything from them.

Zu An said, “Don’t worry. They share several millennia of hatred. Furthermore, with the matter of Yi Yin in the mix, it won’t be that easy for them to remain rational.”

Sure enough, they saw that Xia Jie and Mo Xi seemed to have exchanged a few more arguments, then began to fight again.

Yu Yanluo was a bit worried, saying, “That Mo Xi seems to be a bit weaker than Xia Jie.”

Naturally, they preferred to side with Mo Xi.

“Don’t worry. Mo Xi is indeed weaker than Xia Jie, but Xia Jie is merely a soul right now. His real strength isn’t as great as when he was at his strongest. Meanwhile, Mo Xi has just found her flesh body. There’s also that spear a certain someone gave her for free; the flames on it seem to have a natural restrictive effect on soul bodies. It’ll be hard to say who comes out on top as the battle continues,” Yun Jianyue said, giving Zu An an ambiguous smile. “Little An, you seem to give out heaven-grade weapons whenever you meet a pretty woman. You really do invest a lot into your girl-chasing!”

Yan Xuehen began to panic, saying, “Nonsense, I am his… senior. How could something he gave me be like what he gave someone else?” The Primal Skysilk felt as if it were burning around her waist as she spoke. She could even feel heat coming from it, even though it clearly wasn’t hot.

“Senior?” Zu An replied, looking at her with an ambiguous smile. Were there any seniors who were willing to be their juniors’ sheaths?

Yun Jianyue sneered, saying, “If it weren’t because you were pretty, do you really think he’d give you anything?”

Yu Yanluo nodded in agreement. Ah Zu was really good in many areas, but… He was a bit too fickle in love.

Yan Xuehen was starting to panic. She quickly changed the topic, saying, “Stop getting distracted! Have you noticed that this ‘Yi Yin’ seems to be good with all kinds of weapons? There have been several times when Mo Xi’s spear was clearly about to injure him, and yet was deflected by some kind of mysterious power.”

Because of the Nickname Card, she thought Xia Jie was Yi Yin. Yun Jianyue nodded and said, “You’re right. I noticed that earlier as well. This fatty looks clumsy, but in reality, he seems to be proficient with any weapon. Whether it’s flowers, plants, trees, or even the silk around him, in addition to the stones on the ground, he can use them ingeniously.”

When one’s cultivation reached a high enough level, even flowers and leaves could become fatal weapons. However, that usually referred to a situation where there was a big disparity in cultivation. If both sides’ strength was similar and one used flowers or leaves to attack, not only would it not do much, it would just exhaust their energy for no reason.

And yet, Xia Jie was different. Every ordinary article in his possession seemed to become a true weapon, and their strength was always maximized.

After fighting for a while, Mo Xi began to struggle greatly. Suddenly, one of her openings ended up being exploited, as Xia Jie used a rock behind her to strike her in the middle of her back.

Pfft!

Mo Xi felt as if she had been hit by a heavy mallet. A mouthful of blood spurted out from her mouth. More importantly, her body staggered forward from the inertia.

A malicious grin flashed across Xia Jie’s face. He rushed over to take her life! He already hated this woman bitterly. He had doted on her so much, and yet she had harbored evil intentions and overthrown his entire country!

That was one thing, though; he could understand to a certain degree, as those were grudges related to family and country. However, this slut had seduced another man! Who knew how many shameful things she had done?! As the ruler of a country, how could he tolerate that?

A hint of despair flickered across Mo Xi’s face. She hadn’t expected to die so soon after retrieving her body. She hadn’t even had much time to feel happy about that.

However, she was no pushover either. She gritted her teeth and brandished her spear at Xia Jie’s vitals. Even if she was going to die, she had to make him pay the price.

Xia Jie sneered when he saw that. He had enough of an opportunity to avoid the deadly strike even after killing Mo Xie. This woman is as vicious as expected. She wants to drag me down with her even when she knows she’s going to die.

He was just about to end Mo Xie when he suddenly heard an irritating voice call out, “Whatcha lookin’ at?”

“I’m looking at you, shithead!” Xia Jie subconsciously replied, unable to resist the urge. Then, his entire body stiffened, because he felt fear from his very soul. It was just like before; it was the power that had shot down the suns.

At that instant, Mo Xi’s flame-tipped spear struck between Xia Jie’s brows. The flames instantly devoured his entire body, greedily swallowing up his soul.

“Ahhhh!” Xia Jie screamed miserably. He slammed a fist into Mo Xi’s body, and she flew far into the distance like a broken sack.

However, he staggered and struggled in place, the flame-tipped spear still embedded in his head. His body began to expand and contract rapidly. Then, with a loud boom, he exploded with a great ripple of power. The surrounding forest was completely destroyed, leaving a football stadium-sized crater where Xia Jie had been standing.

The distant Zu An and the others were forced back by that great power. They were horrified. Was this the power of an earth immortal’s death? If even they had been affected even while being so far away, what of Mo Xi, who had been at the center?

Mo Xi had already been struggling to avoid it, but the blast erupted so quickly that it was completely impossible to dodge. The tremendous wave of power sent her into the air like a kite with its string cut.

Zu An quickly rushed forward to catch her.

Yun Jianyue’s lips curled when she saw that, and she remarked, “Look at this guy. It’s always in these kinds of situations that he runs the fastest. Are you going to twirl a few times with her in your arms before you come down?”

Yan Xuehen and Yu Yanluo almost burst out laughing. They really felt the meaning behind those words.

Zu An naturally wasn’t in such a carefree mood that he would chase after Mo Xi, though. He was just worried that his valkyrie would die here. That would be too huge of a loss!

He noticed that Mo Xi’s entire body was covered in injuries, and her aura was also incredibly weak, as if she would breathe her last at any moment. He quickly took out several herbs to treat her, but her body seemed to be special. There was no reaction to the medicine at all.

He was startled. Next, he fished out a handful of Ki Fruits and tossed them into Mo Xi’s mouth. Sure enough, the Ki Fruits melted into her mouth as soon as she took them. A hint of rosiness quickly returned to her deathly pale face. That way, Zu An quickly helped her to recover by transferring energy.

A while later, Mo Xi groaned and gradually woke up. She couldn't help but feel stunned when she saw Zu An. She gradually remembered the earlier events, and eventually said, “Thank you!”

“How do you feel now?” Yan Xuehen asked as she and the other women moved over. They naturally didn’t want anything to happen to Mo Xi, because Zu An still had the Puppet Curse that needed her help to resolve.

“Not good at all,” Mo Xi said weakly. “That guy wanted to drag me down with him and has caused my soul serious damage. I might have to sleep for a long time before I recover.”

Zu An felt regret. If he had known it would be like that, he would have stepped in earlier. However, if he had gotten involved too early, Mo Xi and Xia Jie wouldn’t necessarily have started fighting.

Suddenly, Mo Xi pressed her finger against Zu An’s forehead. A strand of golden light flickered.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“What are you doing?” the women exclaimed, sounding shocked and angry. They hadn’t expected her to suddenly attack at this time.

Mo Xi said calmly, “I’m merely fulfilling my agreement with him. My soul is going to sleep. If no one takes care of this body, it will be dangerous. In the end, I can only entrust it to him.”

Now that her soul and flesh were one, she knew about what had happened between her and Zu An. She knew he had a way of taking her into a mysterious space. That would be much safer, as she could sleep peacefully and let her soul recover.

Zu An was shocked and pleasantly surprised. He hadn’t expected that not only would he regain the valkyrie he lost, she even had a complete soul!

Even though she was going to sleep for a long time and wouldn't be able to fight for some time, that wasn’t a problem! Either way, Mi Li was always sleeping too, so he was already used to that kind of thing.

Honestly, if Mi Li woke up and met Mo Xi, what kind of scene would that create?

When he saw the other woman’s proud and noble expression, Zu An couldn't help but say, “I wouldn’t mind being called master right now, you know?”
