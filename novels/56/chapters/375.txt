Chapter 375: A Win-Win Situation

Translator: Pika

Zu An was overjoyed. He grabbed her arm and asked, “What is it?”

Ji Xiaoxi was also curious. After all, her aunt didn’t possess much medical knowledge, and neither she nor her father could do anything about Qin Wanru’s condition. What kind of method would she propose? Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Jiang Luofu gave Zu An’s hand a cold look.

Zu An let go of her guiltily. “Sorry, sorry. I was just anxious.”

Jiang Luofu continued, “Unfortunately, it’s no use even if I describe this method to you.”

“How could it be of no use? Please, tell us. Perhaps we can think of a solution if we work together!” Ji Xiaoxi cried in panic. She had always been extremely interested in medicine, so she was eager to learn any new treatment methods. She was also naturally kindhearted, and was desperately hoping for Qin Wanru's recovery.

Jiang Luofu hesitated, but in the end she still said, “I read an ancient record that stated that those with transcendent aptitude who have also cultivated the ‘Primordial Origin Sutra’ have the ability to revive others.”

“Transcendent aptitude?” Ji Xiaoxi was stunned. There had never been anyone with transcendent aptitude in hundreds of years. It was so rare that everyone had begun to believe that transcendent aptitude was just a legend.

This ‘Primordial Origin Sutra’ was even more unheard of. No wonder her aunt felt that it would be pointless for her to say anything.

Jiang Luofu gave Zu An a long look. She knew that Zu An possessed transcendent aptitude, but she had never even heard of this ‘Primordial Origin Sutra’ before. That was why this information was useless.

Only Zu An wore a strange expression. He had transcendent blood essence, and he had cultivated in the Primordial Origin Sutra as well. He even knew the treatment method.

But how would he be able to save her?!

The method he’d used to save Chu Chuyan... How could he use it on Qin Wanru as well?!

Even though this world was more liberal than the ancient China of his previous world, there was still a limit as to what would be accepted.

They were treading the line of morality right now. Regardless of whichever world and whichever Age it was, such actions were a huge taboo.

He might regret this for the rest of his life.

Zu An was overwhelmed by internal conflict. He would be a monster if he didn’t save someone even though he had the means to do so! However, if he did save her, he would be worse than a monster!

If Qin Wanru had been any other woman, Zu An would’ve charged straight in, duty-bound. Qin Wanru was the only one he couldn’t do this with.

“There’s no need for all of you to worry about me anymore. I already know that I am doomed.” Qin Wanru’s weak voice pierced the silence. She struggled to a seated position. Zu An quickly moved over to support her.

Qin Wanru gave him a grateful look. Gathering her strength, she said, “I don’t have many regrets, but I am worried about Huanzhao, since she is still in Chu Estate, and my Zhongtian is also locked up. Ah Zu, can you promise me...”

An incredible pain pierced Zu An’s heart. He immediately cut her off. “It’s not time for last words yet.”

He immediately turned around and said to Jiang Luofu and Ji Xiaoxi, “I have some things I need to say to her privately. Can you guys give us a bit of time alone?” The two women would obviously never refuse him in this sort of situation. They nodded and left the room.

Zu An suddenly called out to Jiang Luofu. “Principal, please don’t listen in on our conversation.”

Her cultivation was just too high-level. She could easily listen in on what they were going to discuss inside the room.

Jiang Luofu pressed her lips together briefly.

“Don’t worry. I have no interest in your conversation.”

You have successfully trolled Jiang Luofu for 111 Rage points!

Qin Wanru looked at Zu An in confusion. “What did you want to say to me?”

Zu An quickly closed the door, then moved closer to Qin Wanru’s ear.

Discomforted by his proximity to her, Qin Wanru subconsciously moved away.

Zu An quickly said, “I’m going to tell you something extremely important. No one else can know about this.”

Qin Wanru stopped moving when she heard this. However, her eyes still shone with bewilderment.

After a slight hesitation, he said, “Did you hear Principal Jiang explaining the possible treatment method?”

Qin Wanru nodded. “Doesn’t it require someone with transcendent aptitude and the ‘Primordial Origin Sutra’, though? These are both things only found in legends, so there’s no need to waste time thinking about them.”

“Actually...” Zu An paused for a moment. “I possess both these things.”

“What!?” Qin Wanru couldn't have been more shocked. She didn’t even know what the ‘Primordial Origin Sutra’ was, so she wasn’t too surprised by that. However, her knowledge about transcendent aptitude couldn’t be any clearer!

That was something straight out of legend! Chu Chuyan’s aptitude had already gotten her publicly acknowledged as a genius. With her aptitude, she had been able to reach such great heights of cultivation at such a young age, which earned endless praise from all who saw her.

She couldn’t fathom the possibility of someone with an ever higher level of aptitude.

“Don’t worry about anything else right now,” Zu An said hurriedly. “Even though I have a way to save you, the method is extremely shameful. You have to be the one to choose whether or not you wish to be treated.”

Qin Wanru was confused. “Of course I want you to save me! Why wouldn’t I want that?”

The betrayals of both Chu Tiesheng and Hong Zhong had ignited a huge flame inside of her. Once she recovered, it would be time to get her revenge.

If she died, it would only make it easier for the seat of power in the Chu clan to shift. Huanzhao would most likely meet a miserable end, and her own husband would definitely be beyond saving.

Before now, she had thought that she was dead for sure. She’d even begun to utter her last words earlier on. How could she give up now, when there was hope?

Seeing his uncertain expression, Qin Wanru said, “Don’t worry, I’ll cooperate with you no matter how harsh or painful it might be. I’ll be satisfied even if you could only keep me alive long enough to see the Chu clan stabilize again.”

The conflict within Zu An was clearly evident. “Madam, I urge you not to agree too quickly. Please let me explain what the treatment requires first.”

He gave a quick explanation of how the Primordial Origin Sutra and transcendent blood essence was used in treatment. He even told her about his experience with Chu Chuyan in the dungeon.

Qin Wanru was confused at first, which slowly gave way to shock. By the end of his explanation, her face had gone completely red. “Enough. You don’t need to say any more. I absolutely will not agree to this method.”

When she thought of her and Zu An...

She shivered. Being saved in that way would be a fate worse than death!

Zu An smiled bitterly. “I told you it would turn out like this. This method is just too shameful, isn’t it?”

Her reaction had been completely expected.

He sighed. It seems like we can only accept fate.

Qin Wanru finally understood why his expression had been so conflicted all this time. She didn’t think that he was deliberately deceiving her, because her daughter also told her a little bit about what had happened in the dungeon.

However, there was no way she could agree to such a means of treatment. How would the two of them even be able to look at each other afterwards? How could she face Chuyan? How could she face Chu Zhongtian? How could she face the whole world?

Suddenly, a thought crossed her mind. She remembered the drug Chu Tiesheng had mentioned while he was threatening to humiliate her. That drug could make her forget everything within a few hours. If the two of them found an empty room, and both of them took this drug, neither of them would remember it afterwards. Wouldn’t that be a win-win situation...?

Her heart began to pound as soon as this thought entered her mind. She immediately strangled the thought. Had she gone mad? How could she have actually considered such a thing?!

She quickly gathered her thoughts and said to Zu An, “Ah Zu, I didn’t expect you to actually have transcendent aptitude, let alone such a miraculous technique! It seems like I’ve really underestimated you. You aren’t a useless person at all. That is why, after I die, you have to promise me that you will protect Huanzhao, and save your father-in-law. Zhongtian has always treated you well, so you cannot let him down.”

When he heard her stress the words ‘father-in-law’, he knew that she was secretly warning him. He sighed and said, “Don’t worry, Madam. I would’ve done all of those things, even if you hadn’t told me to.”

A calm smile finally appeared on Qin Wanru’s face. “It seems I don’t have anything else to worry about, then...”

Her voice became softer and softer. And her hand also gradually slid away. Zu An immediately panicked. “Xiaoxi, Xiaoxi! Come quickly! Help!”

Jiang Luofu and Ji Xiaoxi rushed in when they heard the panic in his voice. Seeing Qin Wanru’s condition, Ji Xiaoxi quickly gave her a pill, and began to treat her with acupuncture.

Jiang Luofu couldn’t stop herself from giving Zu An a look. “Did you say something to provoke her? There’s no reason for her condition to suddenly deteriorate so quickly.”

Zu An didn’t argue with her. He only sat down by the side of the bed, and began racking his brains for any other ways to save Qin Wanru.

He rejected one idea after another. He suddenly remembered something. Since none of the methods in this world would work, he would use his Keyboard instead!

If I can pick up something good...

Wait! I don’t even need anything new! That item would be more than enough!
