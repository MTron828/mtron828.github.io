Chapter 588: Persona Destroyed

Translator: Pika

“Yes ma’am! We will take care of all who dare offend our Holy Sect! Blood for blood!” Those subordinates rushed out excitedly to organize this attack.

The charming lady was naturally Qiu Honglei. She was currently reclining on a soft couch, perfectly displaying her seductive figure. However, none of the surrounding sect members dared to sneak any disrespectful looks. The saintess’ status was great. She was definitely not someone they could offend. Furthermore, even though she was beautiful, she was also vicious and decisive.

Qiu Honglei yawned lazily and casually asked, “Right, who is the new official taking the place of Ding Manor? It’s not every day we see the Embroidered Envoy personally cleaning out a manor for an official.”

The capital city division replied, “I believe it is some fella named ‘Phoenix Man’. He offered up something to his majesty and received great favor. I think his name was Zu An or something?”

The capital city division didn’t participate in the attack on Zu An, so they didn’t know about their relationship.

Qiu Honglei’s originally disinterested expression immediately froze. She sat up from the couch and ordered, “Tell them to cancel the attack immediately!”

Everyone from the capital city division: “???”

There was someone who immediately voiced his doubts. “Why are we cancelling the attack? Are we not going to retaliate against those who challenge us? Our Holy Sect will become the laughing stock of the entire world!”

“Because… because…” Qiu Honglei also felt a huge headache. How could she have expected that this random manor would be connected to Zu An? But she couldn’t explain their relationship. However, her mind was starting to move quickly again, so she quickly thought of a solution. “Because I plan to personally set out myself.”

“There is no need for our saintess to take care of such a small matter. Our people will deal with it nice and cleanly. We will definitely chop that fella up to pieces and make him regret being born!” The capital division’s people expressed their loyalty one after another. How could they give up such a good chance to show off in front of the saintess?

“I am glad that everyone is so brave and loyal…'' Qiu Honglei was all smiles, but she was cursing them to death inside. She wasn’t in the mood to praise them at all.

All of these capital city division members relished in this moment. They were all thinking to themselves that there were definitely going to be great benefits from receiving the saintess’ favor this time.

After thinking for a bit, Qiu Honglei said, “The sect master will come to the capital soon and prepare that important matter. I am worried that this might be a trap set up by the Embroidered Envoy. We might end up alerting our enemies if we send out our subordinates now, so it’s best if I make a trip myself and adapt to the situation.”

“The saintess is wise and farsighted after all, far greater than what we could ever hope to match…” Everyone flattered her like crazy. “We will arrange for some experts to accompany the saintess. They’ll be able to protect you then.”

“There is no need!” Qiu Honglei immediately refused. When she saw her subordinates’ alarmed expressions, she coughed lightly and returned to her usual charming voice. “I alone am enough. It will cause too much of a disturbance if more people go.”

Her thoughts were all over the place right now. After her separation with Zu An last time, she didn’t expect him to really make it through his predicament. She definitely had to hear just how he managed to get out of that kind of situation today.

…

Zu An wasn’t in the mood to think about anything else. The only thing in his mind was what he was going to do to this ice beauty in his arms.

At first, Chu Chuyan only allowed him to hug her closely, but that quickly developed into groping, which she tacitly accepted with a red face. However, this fella was going further and further, insisting on continuing. How could she accept that? “No, stop! There are still people waiting outside!”

“It’ll be fine as long as I finish quickly.” The more she acted like this, the more evil thoughts appeared in Zu An’s head.

Chu Chuyan bit her lip. “When have you ever finished quickly…” When she recalled how she was tormented by him in the middle of the night, her body would go weak no matter how cold she was.

How could Zu An still hold back when he saw the bit of sweetness in her expression? He pounced.

Chu Chuyan moaned. She tightly embraced the man in front of her. As a well-behaved daughter of a wealthy clan her entire life, she discovered that ever since she met this fella, she developed a bunch of bad habits. She learned how to lie, and then there was all of this stuff… she became shameless.

She knew that all of this stuff was absolutely crazy from her upbringing, yet for some reason, she always felt a strange sense of excitement. She became much more sensitive than usual.

…

A while later, there were small and quick steps that sounded. “Big sis, brother-in-law, are you guys not finished… Huh?”

The two of them were already extremely nervous. When they suddenly heard this sound, both of them jumped in fright.

Chu Chuyan cried out. Her entire body shook fiercely like ripples.

Zu An sucked in cold air. Who was the one who cultivated the Heaven Devouring Sutra here? He couldn’t hold back at all under the waves of powerful suction force. He released everything.

Chu Youzhao, who was standing by the entrance: “……” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

She was completely stupefied. Her big sister was always like an ice queen who stood at the peak of a frozen mountain, cold and proud. She was like a goddess who accidentally stumbled into this secular world.

She wasn’t the only one who had this thought. This was what all of the young masters in the capital thought.

Whenever Chu Chuyan entered the capital, just a single glance of her graceful figure would be enough to drive those young masters crazy. All of them pursued her madly, yet her big sister didn’t pay them any attention.

Those people could only ask about her big sister through her, because they were ‘sister and brother’. All of them wanted to slide in through this roundabout way, treating this ‘younger brother’ extremely well while asking her about some of her big sister’s hobbies and interests.

Chu Youzhao suddenly felt sympathy for all those bootlickers. If they knew that their queen from the heavens was being ravaged underneath another man, as if she would give birth to his child as long as he gave the word, would die for him if he said so, she wondered just how many of those men would decide to just hang themselves.

Your persona is falling apart, big sis!

Chu Chuyan was already so embarrassed she wanted to find a hole to hide in. However, Zu An was shameless enough. He helped her sort out her clothes while getting up. “We were busy discussing our opinions and suggestions on this matter. We didn’t expect time to pass by so quickly, haha…”

Chu Youzhao: “……”

There is actually such a shameless person in this world?

This guy is a big scoundrel after all!

It’s good that you are helping my big sis with her clothes, but why aren’t you putting on your own pants?!

Chu Youzhao immediately covered her face with her hands. However, she secretly peeped through the gaps between her fingers. “Um… Grandfather is getting a bit impatient. He told me to come and see how things are going.”

Chu Chuyan finally recovered a bit of composure. “Alright, we will head over soon.”

At the same time, she pinched Zu An’s waist. This fella really was a wicked scoundrel!

Chu Youzhao had a weird look on her face when she heard her big sister’s usual clear and cold voice. Your cover is already blown, big sis! The only thing in my head is the two of you…

“I’m… going to report to my grandfather so that they don’t send anyone else.” Chu Youzhao was still a young lady after all. Even though she was a bit curious at first, her embarrassment still won out in the end. She quickly ran away.

“It’s all your fault.” Chu Chuyan was already about to cry.

Zu An chuckled. “It’s fine, we’re all from the same family anyway. Youzhao won’t tell anyone else. But really, that kid really is something for watching the whole thing.”

Chu Chuyan bit her soft red lip and said quietly, “It’s not that big of a deal for Youzhao to see, because she isn’t my little brother, but… my little sister.”

Even though this was the Chu clan’s greatest secret, there was no need to hide this from him. She was worried that he might mind that Chu Youzhao saw them, that this would leave behind some unnecessary misunderstandings. It was best that she explained this sooner.

Zu An subconsciously replied, “Yeah, I know.”

“Huh? Why do you know that?” It was now Chu Chuyan’s turn to be surprised.

“Uh… I saved her when we were attacked during the assassination and found out then.” Zu An said ambiguously. He couldn’t just say that he accidentally touched her chest, right?

“I didn’t expect you to have already saved Youzhao too.” Chu Chuyan said with a sigh. “Our Chu clan really owes you too much. I have no idea how we are going to repay you.”
