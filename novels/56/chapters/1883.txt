Just as Jing Teng seemed about to be hit by the streaks of radiance, Zu An instantly appeared at her side. Sword radiance erupted from his hands and blocked the lights head on.

A strong wind blew toward them just then. Zu An had to stand protectively in front of Jing Teng and couldn't dodge in time, so he could only do his best to prevent his vitals from being hit.

Boom!

A fist slammed into him, and a strand of blood trickled out of the corner of his lips. He did everything he could to frantically suck away its power with the Heaven Devouring Sutra and Kun Peng force, while retreating several dozen zhang backward with Jing Teng.

He saw that the one who had attacked was none other than the Ghost King. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly. That attack seemed to be far from the Ghost King’s normal power.

“You damn kid, you’d better be careful. You might not be so lucky next time,” the Ghost King warned him.

Zu An now noticed that the Ghost King was sometimes conscious, and sometimes muddle-headed. She was clearly doing everything she could to fight the black mist for control over her own body. However, judging from the looks of things, it didn’t seem as if it would be long before she completely lost control.

Just then, those strands of aura roared, “Lend us all of your power, or else none of us will be able to get out!”

As if some other things had heard what they were saying, the entire great tomb began to tremble intensely. Countless auras rushed toward the area. Soon after, the lights became thicker and seemed to condense together.

The red light formed a middle-aged man that was dressed entirely in blood-red clothes. His robes’ spacious sleeves, his scarlet cloak, and everything else was red.

Meanwhile, the green radiance condensed into a green-robed elder. His eyes flickered brightly, but he looked like a shriveled corpse.

On the other hand, the black energy around the Ghost King had already turned into black mist and skulls again.

Jing Teng quickly said, “They’re all the most powerful beings in this prison. Among them, the Blood Devil is the weakest, but his ability is special and he excels in escape. The green-robed one is from the bug race, so be careful of his bugs. The other one is the Lord of Black Mist. Many of the abilities my little sister used came from none other than him.”

Zu An’s expression changed. He asked, “All of them escaped?”

If all of these beings had broken out of prison, like hell was there still a fight to be had! He wondered whether he could take the chance to just escape with Jing Teng. At that point, there would be no reason for her to sacrifice herself anymore.

However, to his surprise, Jing Teng shook her head and said, “They actually haven’t. It’s just that there are issues with the divine talisman, so the seal has loosened up a bit. These powerful beings managed to send out a bit of their aura through that opening. Even if they’ve absorbed the power the other monsters have supplied, they’re definitely not as strong as they would be at their peak. Otherwise, now would be a good time to end our own lives.”

Just then, the Ghost King could no longer hold on. Her legs stomped the ground, and she frantically rushed forth, calling out, “Fine, I agree to help you!”

A cruel laugh emerged from within the black mist. The Lord of Black Mist replied, “Wouldn’t it have been great if you said so earlier?”

Zu An’s expression changed. He quickly rushed over to stop the Ghost King. There were three terrifying beings with them. Even though they hadn’t completely recovered to their strongest state yet, they still had their experience and insight. This was already a situation that was difficult for them to escape from, and yet the Ghost King was going to join in too?

“You want to stop her? How could it be that easy?” the green-robed elder called out, laughing sinisterly. Suddenly, his entire body collapsed and turned into endless green beetles that swarmed at Zu An.

“Be careful! Those Sacred Heart Beetles’ mouths are incredibly sharp. There’s nothing they can’t eat!” Jing Teng cried out in alarm. She quickly charged at the divine talisman, trying to seize the opportunity to enter it.

However, how could the Blood Devil give her that chance? It turned into a sea of blood and blocked her path. Helpless to do anything else, she could only form an imprint to fight against the sea of blood.

When he saw the sea of endless bugs rush at him, Zu An shuddered. Even though he had never seen the opponent fight before, he hadn’t watched countless shows in his previous world for nothing. He thought to himself that if he let those bugs surround him, he would definitely be instantly chewed to the bone.

Thus, he decided to immediately use Lion’s Roar against these endless bugs. A powerful sound wave rippled out. Those bugs that were at the forefront were immediately blasted into pieces. Lion’s Roar wasn’t too effective against a singular powerful enemy, but when used against such weaker bodies, it had miraculous effects.

“Insignificant talent!” the other bugs cried out as they quickly spread their wings in fury, releasing a concentrated, ear-splitting buzz. Not only did it disperse the Lion’s Roar effects, the sound wave even continued spreading outward to attack Zu An.

You have successfully trolled the Green-Robed Bug King for +888 +888 +888…

The Violet-Gold Alms appeared above Zu An again and scattered its golden light, resisting all of the sound waves.

“It’s actually Golden Mountain Motuo’s alms bowl! That guy really isn’t good at anything but screwing up!” the swarm of bugs roared furiously. It no longer tried any sound-based attacks; instead, it tried to completely devour Zu An.

Boom!

A white lotus blossomed. Pale flames immediately enveloped Zu An’s surroundings.

It was the White Lotus Flame!

Zu An was still worried that the true flame wouldn’t be enough to deal with these terrifying things, so he also used phoenix fire alongside it. A phoenix spread its wings above the white lotus.

The sea of bugs immediately began to sizzle loudly. A scorched smell quickly filled the air. The remaining bugs released ear-splitting screams and quickly gathered to become the green-robed elder again. However, his complexion was now much paler. His green robe was also no longer as glossy as before.

He was full of regret. Earlier, this pretty boy’s cultivation had seemed completely ordinary and unbearably weak. He had been planning to just let his bugs do the work and turn the boy into a set of bones, thinking that would also deal a heavy blow to Jing Teng’s mentality. How could he have expected this brat to have so many mysterious area of effect attacks?

If he had attacked the opponent in his normal state, those skills wouldn’t do much to him. Why had he decided to turn into those bugs?! That way, the individual bugs had much weaker defenses, which meant that Zu An’s skills had ended up wounding him considerably.

However, even though he was seriously injured, he had at least stopped that brat. The Ghost King, Lord of Black Mist, and Blood Devil had Jing Teng surrounded, so she was done for!

The Ghost King’s entire body was covered in black mist as she rushed up to Jing Teng. Jing Teng’s attention was fully concentrated on dealing with the Blood Devil, so how could she still have the energy to guard against them?

The Lord of Black Mist snickered. He could almost picture Jing Teng perishing, and then the Demon-Suppressing Talisman would shatter as a result. All of the creatures sealed by it would then be able to escape.

Suddenly, however, the Ghost King’s body surged with brilliance, drawing the Demon-Suppressing Talisman’s radiance into herself.

The Lord of Black Mist screamed bitterly. The Demon-Suppressing Divine talisman had powerful restrictive effects on him. His soul seemed to be burning altogether, so he had no choice but to withdraw from the Ghost King’s side. He roared furiously, “What are you doing?!”

The Ghost King sneered and replied, “I would rather return to the divine talisman with my big sister than help you all!”

She had always been proud. Previously, she had thought that as long as her big sister returned to the divine talisman, she would be completely free, but now that she knew that her body had already been tampered with by those devils and she would only be restrained, how could she accept such a fate?

“Then die with her!” the Lord of Black Mist exclaimed in shock and anger.

In the past, he and the other monsters had aided in her escape, resulting in her body being tainted by their energy. Now that the Demon-Suppressing Divine Talisman shone on her, she naturally couldn't hold on for much longer.

“So what?!” the Ghost King retorted, her expression indifferent. Then, she gave Jing Teng a look and said, “Since I’m already fated to meet a tragic end, rather than helping outsiders, I might as well help out my big sister.”

Afterward, her entire body suddenly shattered like glass. Then, she turned into a figure of light that embraced Jing Teng. The two of them looked exactly the same. When they made contact, they quickly merged together. The Blood Devil couldn't stop them in time, and Jing Teng immediately erupted with golden light.

The Blood Devil screamed miserably. Sizzling noises filled the air as soon as the golden light shone on the blood all over its body. He immediately moved away to avoid the light.

However, Jing Teng seized the opportunity to fly toward the Demon-Suppressing Divine Talisman. The Green-Robed Bug King and the Lord of Black Mist couldn't stop her. They could only watch as her soul reunited with the talisman.

“We’re done for!”

The monsters shivered in fear. They knew that now, they would be locked away for countless years again. They would have to continue living in this dreadful place.

Just as Jing Teng was about to merge with the talisman, she couldn't help but turn around and give Zu An a look. Her gaze was full of reluctance. This was going to be an eternal separation with her love.

Zu An used his instant movement skill to arrive in front of her and tried to stop her. Suddenly, however, a streak of white light moved even faster than him and struck her body.

Jing Teng looked as if she had been struck by lightning. She coughed out a mouthful of blood and fell from midair. However, Zu An arrived just in time to catch her.

“Which great one is it?!”

The Green Robed Bug King and the others were incredibly moved. They all looked in a certain direction while trembling all over.

It was that unrivaled being that couldn't be looked at or have its name uttered!

When they felt its terrifying aura approach, they were utterly terrified. Even beings as powerful as them would instantly perish if they even looked at that individual. However, they didn’t dare to ask it to return. A feeling of pressure that seemingly came from their very bloodlines forced them to stand in place.

“Hurry, hurry and send me back into the talisman. Otherwise, it’ll be too late!” Jing Teng exclaimed in both her voice and the Ghost King’s. It was clear that they had also noticed that being’s aura approaching. A hint of despair flashed through their eyes.

Zu An suddenly said with a sigh, “Ghost King, you asked me earlier whether I would choose the people I don’t know or my beloved woman, right? You believed that regardless of which one I chose, I would live in suffering after.

“However, I’m not like other people. I’m rather greedy. I choose to have everything!”
