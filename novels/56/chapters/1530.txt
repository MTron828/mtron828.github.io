Chapter 1479: Gatling the Savior

Yan Xuehen and the others had fought by Zu An’s side, so they had naturally seen some of his strongest moves before. What they were seeing now was clearly his Blue Luan Sword Formation.

However, even though the sword formation was extraordinary, it had one fatal weakness, which was that Zu An’s cultivation rank still wasn’t high enough. Perhaps against others of the same level or those who were at a lower rank, the skill would have an overwhelming advantage. If he faced someone whose cultivation was way higher than his, though, the power of the sword formation would be lacking.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue had given him advice on how to improve it in the past, which was to refine a large amount of heaven-grade or better weapons and use them in place of condensed sword ki. That way, its power would greatly increase.

Still, heaven-grade weapons were hard to find in this world. Every single one would be fought over by many different factions when it appeared. Even for the Devil Sect or the White Jade Sect, although those forces did have some heaven-grade weapons, they were exceedingly precious. They were often reserved only for those with high status or power.

If Zu An wanted to replace all of the Blue Luan Sword formation’s swords, who knew just how many heaven-grade weapons it would take? It didn’t seem realistic at all; immortal or deity-grade were out of the question.

They had been together for a long time, and hadn’t seen Zu An obtain any new weapons, let alone refine any. So where had so many heaven-grade weapons come from?ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Wait, why do they look so familiar?

Tai’e Sword, Poisonous Prick, Violetflame Snake Pike, Universe Ring, Gold Brick, Wind Fire Wheels…

Hm? Why are the Crescent Ring and Flying Snow Sword there too?

The two of them began to question life a bit. They reflexively looked down, but their weapons were clearly still with them. They could use them at any time!

The Fiend Emperor’s expression changed as well. As he looked at the suspended weapons, he exclaimed in surprise and fury, “Yan Xuehen, Yun Jianyue, have the two of you gotten with him too? You actually gave him your weapons?!”

You have successfully trolled the Fiend Emperor for +444 +444 +444…

It wasn’t his fault for thinking that way. After all, a cultivator’s weapon was something they nurtured extremely carefully and bound to their soul. It basically reached a point where the weapon would remain as long as the owner remained, but if anything happened to the weapon, the owner often experienced a powerful backlash too.

As such, normally, no one would lend their weapon to another. Otherwise, if the other person bore any malice, they could easily inflict serious damage to one’s soul. And yet, both of these women had actually given their weapons to Zu An, proving that they already had the highest level of trust for Zu An. Their relationships were closer than even husband and wife!

How was that possible, though?!

Even if they were on the same side, the Fiend Emperor had heard of the two women’s reputations before. How could two women who were that prideful possibly have that kind of relationship with Zu An?

Even though he was now old and didn’t care much about beauty, he was still a man. What man could remain calm upon seeing so many extraordinary beauties devote themselves to the same man?

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were alarmed. They both shouted, “Pah, what kind of nonsense are you saying?!”

However, the two didn’t bring out their weapons to disprove it, as Zu An had produced the scene before them using an unknown weapon. If they did that, the Fiend Emperor could potentially find an opening.

The heaven-grade weapons behind Zu An quickly flew toward the Fiend Emperor. Every single one carried terrifying strength and power!

They were, naturally, created from the Rune Weapon Chart. Zu An had never had the time to refine the heaven-grade weapons he had for the Blue Luan Sword Formation. Now, he had discovered that the materialized weapons could actually synergize with the sword formation, so there was obviously no reason for him to hold back.

Faced with the incoming weapons, the Fiend Emperor’s feet moved slightly. It was as if he were just going for a stroll, and yet he avoided the weapons one after another. Even the closest one barely came within an inch of his body, unable to harm him at all.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were both shaken when they saw that scene. Just how incredible was his movement skill? Was the difference in strength between the two parties really so great? They both felt that even if they used everything they had, they wouldn’t even be able to touch a corner of the Fiend Emperor’s clothes.

Zu An frowned slightly. He organized the weapons into a dense net, surrounding his opponent.

As it was called the Blue Luan Sword Formation, there was no way it would only be able to release sword ki normally. Apart from that, the sword ki could be organized into an intricate formation.

When he saw the concentrated formation, the Fiend Emperor was finally forced to treat it a bit more seriously. Still, it cut a single strand of his hair.

However, he didn’t show any alarm, instead nodding in praise and saying, “You are still so young, and yet you were able to cut a strand of my hair. That would already be enough to make your name renowned throughout the world.”

The three women nodded in agreement. After all, the Fiend Emperor and Zhao Han were at the peak of the world, synonymous with invincibility. In the past hundred years or so, there weren’t many who had seen them fight.

Yun Jianyue was even more moved. After all, her cultivation was higher than Zu An’s. Back then, in the human race’s Imperial Palace, she hadn’t even met Zhao Han, and yet she was seriously injured; to say nothing of even touching a single strand of hair.

“Unfortunately, these weapons seem to be a bit weaker than true heaven-grade weapons,” the Fiend Emperor said, already having sensed some things about the move. He had seen Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue’s weapons before; the weapons Zu An wielded were inferior. He continued, “Of course, even so, if there were thousands or ten thousand of these weapons, they could be a threat to me. Unfortunately, right now… They are far from enough!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a Golden Crow incarnation suddenly appeared around him, smashing straight through the net of weapons. The materialized weapons all shattered.

When he saw the fragments disappear into specks of starlight, the Fiend Emperor revealed an expression that seemed to say ‘as expected’. He remarked, “It appears these were all materialized through some method. I did not expect you to have such a trump card. My son’s defeat was not in vain.”

He didn’t suspect that it was the skill Yu the Great had given Zu An; he assumed no one could learn such a skill so quickly.

Zu An had to admit that the Fiend Emperor’s cultivation was astonishing; he had been able to see through the skill from just observing a single move. He sighed regretfully. The amount of heaven-grade weapons he had seen was too small. Recreating the sword formation with only the weapons he had was pushing it too far.

“You have already made your move. It is my turn now,” the Fiend Emperor said, instantly vanishing from his position.

Then, Zu An’s group felt a terrifying pressure that made all their fine hairs stand on end. They all knew their opponent would attack them a moment later. However, because earth immortals surpassed the limitations of space, they couldn't deduce where the attack was coming from at all. They could only await their ‘judgment’.

Yan Xuehen suddenly had a thought. Should I use my body to block the Fiend Emperor’s attack? Then, that could buy Zu An a bit of time to use the Sun Slaying Bow.

Either way, after what had happened between the two of them, she didn’t know how to face Chuyan anymore anyway…

Yan Xuehen drew the Flying Snow Sword. She prepared to use her forbidden skill, but suddenly, Zu An took her in his arms. She was stunned, thinking, What is he doing?

She didn’t suspect that he was using her as a shield; rather, she briefly thought he wanted to die together with her. However, when she saw that he was also carrying Yu Yanluo and Yun Jianyue, those feelings instantly vanished into thin air.

The Fiend Emperor suddenly appeared out of thin air. A giant golden hand imprint slammed down toward the group. If it hit, all of them would be instantly crushed into a bloody paste.

Just then, however, a loud sound rang out. A large cauldron projection suddenly appeared around them, blocking the attack.

“Nine Cauldron?” the Fiend Emperor exclaimed, quickly retreating when he saw it. His eyes were filled with fear. After all, he had just seen Yu the Great use the item to take down Gonggong, so how could he not be afraid?

Don’t tell me Yu the Great isn’t dead yet? he thought. He released his divine will to sense his surroundings, but he didn’t detect Yu the Great’s aura.

Furthermore, after the cauldron took the blow, it immediately cracked and scattered apart. He reacted quickly, saying,, “So it was just something you materialized with that mysterious ability of yours! Hahaha, not even the Nine Cauldron could stop me. What else will you bring out now?”

“Is that so?” Zu An replied, not wasting any more time on words. A burst of light flickered, and a black, barrel-like object suddenly appeared in his hands. The part he was holding was extremely clunky-looking, while the body was made up of several cylindrical tubes bound together. The many holes in its front gave off a mysterious killing intent.
