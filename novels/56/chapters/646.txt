Chapter 631: Sound In the Middle of the Night

Translator: Pika

“You’re going to sleep?” Yun Jianyue frowned. She didn’t immediately react to what he said.

“Of course! Your assassins invaded, and then I ran all over the place saving people. Later on, I was even scared by Zhuxie Chixin and Cheng Xiong a few times. I’m already super tired.” Zu An said this while lying down. “Move over please, you’re in the way.”

“You’re going to sleep on the bed?” Yun Jianyue remained expressionless. Shouldn’t the man normally act like a gentleman in this situation? This fella really didn’t behave like you would expect him to.

Zu An said naturally, “Of course. This is my room and my bed. Where else would I sleep if I don’t sleep here?”

Yun Jianyue took a deep breath. She calmed the rage that was building up within her. “Then where do I sleep?”

“The floor of course. What, do you want to sleep with me?” Zu An held onto his covers and gave her a suspicious look as if she was a pervert.

This was a special courtyard reserved for an Embroidered Envoy to take a short rest, so it wasn’t that large. There was no way it had a guest room or something like that. That was why apart from this bed, there was no other place.

Yun Jianyue: “???”

As a grandmaster, she thought that she was already immune to emotional fluctuations. Yet today, because of this man, she found that this wasn’t true at all.

He was just too shameless!

“You are a man, and I am a woman. Could it be that you just cannot be the gentleman here?” Yun Jianyue naturally didn’t want to sleep on the ground. However, as a grandmaster, she naturally couldn’t just fight with him over this. After all, he saved her and even offered her medicine for her wounds. Even for the Devil Sect’s sect master, doing something like immediately becoming hostile seemed a bit too low.

“Please don’t, I support gender equality.” Zu An immediately said. “You’re even a glorious Devil Sect Master, you’re stronger than all those men anyway. Do you really have the nerveto say these things because you’re a girl.”

Yun Jianyue: “......”

She snorted and said, “Those who dare speak such words to me are already dead. I won’t argue with you since you saved me.”

After saying this, she moved to a wooden stool and closed her eyes. At her level, external weather didn’t affect her much. She didn’t need something like a cover.

Zu An laid down on the bed. He propped up his head and said, “Isn’t sitting there all night kind of uncomfortable?”

He had to admit that her long hair that reached her bottom was a delightful sight. It was just like a natural work of art! He didn’t hope for more, he’ll just treat this as nice scenery.

“Are you planning to give me the bed then?” Yun Jianyue didn’t even open her eyes.

“Uh... I wanted to give you a proposal. Can’t you make your own bed?” Zu An said.

“Make one?” Yun Jianyue said indifferently, “There’s no need.”

She was already extremely familiar with this residence. There weren’t even any extra chairs. Was she going to piece together some chairs and sleep on them? That would completely tarnish her reputation as a glorious sect master!

Zu An said, “There was a goddess-like legend from my hometown who didn’t use beds either. She only needed a rope tied between two walls, and then she would sleep on it.”

“Hm?” Yun Jianyue opened her eyes. She was clearly a bit moved. “There was someone like that?”

Zu An was also a bit excited. He sat up and said, “Yup! She’s a goddess that appeared in the dreams of far too many shut-ins!”

Sigh, this Xiaolongnu brings back too many memories from his past world. It’s truly a pity that he can’t return anymore.[1]

“Disgraceful.” Yun Jianyue was full of disdain when she looked at his appearance.

However, she still got up. She produced a white silk thread from her sleeves. With a flick of her wrist, the ends shot into the walls, forming a simple bed.

Zu An was stunned. Where the heck did this long silk band come from? But he quickly realized that he had a spatial storage himself, so there was no way this glorious sect master wouldn’t have one.

Yun Jianyue tapped her feet, and then she gracefully stood on the band. Then, she laid down, her body slowly reclining backwards. “Is this what you were talking about?”

“Yeah.” Zu An was in a bit of a daze. Her stance was just like the actress in the drama he watched. There wasn’t a trace of inelegance. No, this woman was much more stunning, and even her expression was aloof and distant. Was this the so-called pure yet sexy?

Yun Jianyue laid down on the band. She felt strangely relaxed. “This method isn’t bad. It feels quite comfortable.”

WIth her cultivation, it wasn’t difficult for her to maintain her balance on this thin band.

Zu An gave that beautiful figure on the thread a look. Her long hair fell from above, and her figure really was stunning. Um... the all black outfit could be replaced though.

Yun Jianyue suddenly sat up at this time.

“What is it?” Zu An asked out of curiosity.

“My clothes are too tight, so it’s a bit uncomfortable.” Yun Jianyue said with a frown. She didn’t feel it when she was sitting on the chair, but now that she was lying on this band, her clothes were a bit tight.

Zu An said, “Do you want to change? I have some clothes here.”

Yun Jianyue gave him a strange look. “Are you a pervert? Why do you have female clothes here?”

Zu An immediately became angry and ashamed. “Pah! I was merely keeping them here for my woman!”

“Hmph! If you already have other girls, why are you still chasing after our Honglei?” Yun Jianyue became unhappy.

Zu An said, “I’m sure you know about my Chu clan situation. Furthermore, Honglei knew about it from the start too. I didn’t lie to her or anything.”

Yun Jianyue frowned. What the heck is going on with that girl Honglei? She clearly knows that this kid is a playboy, so how could she still fall for him? She said coldly, “There’s no need, I have my own clothes.”

Then, with a tap of her toes, she arrived behind the curtains. “If you sneak a look, then I’m going to kill you even if I have to permanently sacrifice my cultivation.”

“Who are you looking down on, sis? Am I someone like that?!” Zu An said angrily. He turned around and had his back to her.

“It’s fine as long as you aren’t.” Yun Jianyue sighed when she saw this. She removed a set of clothes from her storage artifact and began to change.

Zu An’s heart pounded when he heard the rustling sounds of clothes being removed. Isn’t this woman freaking seducing me by changing right here?

He felt something stir within him when he smelled the lingering scent.

I can’t turn around myself, but I can use the jade badge’s power to see with their eyes...

He raised his hand and was about to use that ability, but he gave up on the thought in the end. Hmph! I’m a man of character! If I want to look, then I’ll just look openly. What is there to be proud of by being sneaky?

“What are you muttering about over there?” Yun Jianyue’s soft footsteps sounded behind him.

Zu An turned around. His eyes lit up. She changed into a set of white clothes, which completely removed all of the fierceness of a witch. She seemed much more pure and otherworldly.

He couldn’t help but sigh. “Your appearance really doesn’t match how others describe you! The ruler of the Devil Sect should be the aggressive and seductive type, what are you playing around with this immortal goddess stuff for?”

Her brows raised when she heard the words aggressive and seductive, but she felt much better when she heard his following words. She snorted and didn’t bother arguing with him. She returned to that thin band to sleep.

Zu An was more and more moved as he stared at the white clad beauty. Eventually, the last bit of disharmony also disappeared, making her even prettier than the Xiaolongnu he remembered from that drama.

“What are you staring at?” Even though she didn’t open her eyes, Yun Jianyue seemed to be able to sense his movements.

Zu An snapped out of his daze and said with a smile, “It’s nothing important. I just wanted to warn you that when you remain on the silk band, your thoughts need to remain pure, or else you’ll easily fall off.”

Yun Jianyue said indifferently, “Are you doubting my cultivation?”

Zu An figured that this made sense as well. She was already a grandmaster, so this type of thing shouldn’t be too difficult for her.

As such, he laid down again. Even though his mind was going crazy from the lingering scent and how he was sleeping in the same room as such a stunning beauty, he really was too tired today. He quickly fell asleep.

...

There was suddenly a thud sound that roused him awake in the middle of the night. It was combined with a girl’s cry of alarm. “Ah!”
