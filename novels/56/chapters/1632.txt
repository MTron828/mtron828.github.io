Chapter 1581 – Appearance of a Great Treasure

Zu An didn’t know that the young lady next to him was going through an emotional rollercoaster. When he saw her stare blankly, he nervously asked, “Did it not work?”

He hadn’t experienced any soul injuries before, so he wasn’t sure whether Feather Mountain’s spiritual spring would be effective for such an injury.

“No, ah… I mean, it works, and it works really, really well,” Xie Daoyun said, shaking her head briefly before quickly nodding. In that instant, she felt a bit strange. Her thoughts were usually pretty clear, so why was she suddenly feeling so muddle-headed?

“It’s good that it’s effective,” Zu An said, sighing in relief.

Xie Daoyun gave him a look. When she saw him look at her with such a warm and gentle expression, her heart skipped a beat. She lowered her head because her face was heating up.

A while later, she finally summoned the courage to speak. She opened her mouth and was about to say something, but Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang had already detained some members of the rebel army and returned, saying, “General, we’ve captured some of them for interrogation. Their status in the rebel army doesn’t seem to be that low.”

The situation was way too messy, so there were some unlucky individuals who hadn't gotten away. They had been arrested by the Armed Escort Division after they recovered from their initial shock.

The two deputy generals felt ashamed and embarrassed, so they wanted to at least do something to earn back a bit of favor. As such, they had quickly sifted through the captives and brought a few of the leaders up to Zu An.

When he saw their huge change in expression, Zu An found it a bit comical. However, he didn’t make things too difficult for them, saying, “I’ve troubled the two of you.”

“It was no trouble, no trouble at all!” Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang replied, sighing inwardly in relief. They had still been really nervous not too long ago, fearing that he would harbor hard feelings and wouldn’t forgive them. But now, it seemed that Zu An had already let the previous matters pass.

The two of them suddenly felt a bit of shame. Sir Zu’s cultivation was so incredible that they weren’t even on the same level. Why would he bother arguing with them? They thought, We were just too superficial.

Zu An’s attention shifted to the rebel army leaders. He asked, “Why were you all chasing after Miss Xie?”

The leaders looked at him in fear. This man had just killed so many of their brothers with just a raise of his hand. Compared to him, the legendary bloodthirsty killers from the world of warriors were like little brothers.

“Reply… Replying to sir, at first we received news from some of my brothers that they got into a fight with a pretty girl in the town. We’re all from the same mountain, so we naturally had to help them out,” one began.

With someone taking the lead, the others all tried to make themselves sound useful.

“But who would have thought that all of the brothers we sent would be beaten up? We all thought it was outrageous! At the same time, we were interested in where that woman… no, that female hero was so formidable, so we sent more people to investigate the situation. But then we suffered another setback again, so more and more people went out when they heard the news. We had to get revenge for our brothers, and we wanted to see her for ourselves…”

Wang Bolin sneered and said, “It was probably because you heard that Miss Xie was pretty.”

Xie Daoyun blushed a bit, looking rather embarrassed. This rebel army had really done a number on her.

“That… That is true too…” the leaders replied. When they saw Zu An’s sharp gaze, they didn’t dare to hide the truth. “In our line of trade, if the subject isn’t money, then it’s women. A chick as pretty as this Lady Xie… Ahem, we’ve never seen a woman as pretty as her before, so a lot of people got excited.”

“But we definitely didn’t participate in it! It was only later that we followed big boss and second boss here.”

“Right, right. We were in the back and didn’t follow the others. The ones in the front suddenly disappeared after that attack, so we were scared silly, and then… and then you guys captured us.”

…

When he heard them continuously express their innocence, Zu An remarked, “Isn’t it going a bit too far to send out an entire army after a single woman?”

“It seemed big boss was interested in her, so he gave the order that we had to capture her alive. Weunderlings obviously had to listen to his order,” the group of rebel leaders talked over each other one after another as they tried to explain. In the end, what they were saying was that the fault lay with their boss, and that they were innocent.

Zhang Zijiang said, “This general has heard a bit about Scarface Yang Shen. I have never heard of him being a perverted man. The reason he wanted to capture Lady Xie was probably not out of lust, but rather because he valued her identity as a runemaster. A runemaster is invaluable to an army.”

The rebel leaders seemed to have suddenly seen the light. One said, “I was going to say, big boss doesn’t usually care about these things, and yet he insisted on having this woman. We thought it was because she was too pretty and just happened to suit his tastes.”

Another rebel leader immediately corrected him, “This woman is obviously a goddess, so it’s only natural for us to have misunderstood big boss as having those thoughts.”

The rebel army leaders were used to kissing up during their day to day lives, so they were really good at playing supporting roles. Now, Xie Daoyun was the one feeling embarrassed.

Zu An thought for a long time after he heard that, then suddenly said, “There is another problem. Your Twin Dragon Mountains’ territory isn’t here; it’s quite far from this place. Why did so many of you appear here?”

Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang were shocked. They’d had similar suspicions earlier, but they hadn’t thought about it for too long. Now that they had time to think about it in more detail, that was indeed strange.

The leaders looked at each other in dismay. They all closed their mouths, no longer as slick-tongued as earlier.

Zu An glowered when he saw that, saying, “Separate them and interrogate them one by one.”

Often, interrogating people together wouldn’t provide any information. Only if they were separated would they quickly provide the desired results,

Xie Daoyun said, “There’s no need for all that trouble. I have some Truth Talismans. If you apply one to them, they’ll reply to whatever you ask.”

Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang’s eyes widened. They thought, As expected of Master Yan’s disciple; she even had a legendary Truth Talisman.

Still, Xie Daoyun knew that the Truth Talisman had its limitations. It was precious, but its target’s cultivation couldn't be too high, and they couldn't be good at controlling mental force. Making such a talisman was difficult too, so it really wasn’t all that amazing. It wasn’t all that useful normally. The reason she had some was because her master had wanted to train her talisman crafting, so he had made her create the difficult Truth Talisman as practice. That was why she had a few on her.

The rebel army leaders were horrified. They quickly said, “There’s no need to go through that much trouble! We’ll speak, we’ll speak…”

If they were honest, perhaps they would receive lenient treatment, but if they were interrogated like that, they wouldn’t have any room for negotiation anymore. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

One after another, they gave a rough summary of what had happened. It turned out the Twin Dragon Mountains hadn’t been aiming for this place, but rather, were heading toward Yi Commandery. It was rumored that the criminal leader Lu Sanyuan had sent out a great invitation. He had said that a great treasure would appear in Yi Commandery, and he had invited everyone to get together and cooperate in a great undertaking.

“Lu Sanyuan!” Wang Bolin and Zhang Zijiang exclaimed in surprise.

That guy was the most famous among the rebel armies! He was someone who had given his majesty and the court a huge headache. They hadn’t expected to end up attracting such a big fish!

Zu An was no stranger to Lu Sanyuan. In the past, when he was arrested and brought to the capital, Lu Sanyuan’s rebel army had apparently clashed with the official army.

However, he was more concerned about something else. He asked, “A great treasure is appearing?”

Is it really a treasure, or is the treasure a metaphor for Zhao Han?
