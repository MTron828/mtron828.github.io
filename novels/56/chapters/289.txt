Chapter 289: Qin Wanru’s Tortured Heart

Translator: Pika

Chu Chuyan hadn't yet noticed that something was off about her mother. She frantically explained, “Mom, he really was treating me... This method might seem crazy, but it really is healing me...”

Her neck grew red as she spoke. After all, she had been an excellent daughter since she was little, and had never given her parents cause to worry.

Now though, she actually had to explain such an embarrassing scene to her mother. It really was too humiliating...

“It’s all this guy’s fault!” She couldn't help but give Zu An a hateful look.

Zu An felt as if he had suffered a great injustice. How is this my fault? No one could have expected your mom to suddenly break in!

Qin Wanru turned her head rigidly to the side. Then, she looked at her daughter in a deeply concerned manner. “Yan’er, has your condition improved?”

Chu Chuyan bit her lip and said quietly, “I’m not fully healed yet, but I feel much better than before.”

“Such a thing can really produce healing effects?” Qin Wanru was dumbstruck. She had her fair share of knowledge and experience, yet this was the first time she ever heard of such a thing.

“He might be different from other men...” Chu Chuyan explained quietly. As a cultivation genius, she was able to keenly sense that the other party’s ki could repair her meridians naturally in her stead, as if it was her own ki.

But of course, she was a complete newbie when it came to such a thing, so she had no way of confirming if this belief was true.

“It’s mainly because of my constitution and cultivation method. Other men cannot do the same thing,” Zu An anxiously added from the side.

I absolutely cannot have these two have any more misunderstandings at such a time!

Qin Wanru wanted to ask him what kind of constitution and technique he was talking about, but her face became rigid as soon as she turned around. She immediately shifted her gaze away. Now really wasn’t the best time to ask about this.

“Put on some goddamn clothes already!” Qin Wanru sat down so that her side profile was presented to him, her head turned to face away. Her ample chest rose and fell, although it was unclear whether it was because her anger had yet to dissipate, or for some other reason.

“Follow me out when you are dressed, and then explain the situation to Master,” Qin Wanru added. She obviously couldn’t allow Zu An to continue tormenting her daughter now that she had interrupted them.

This is completely outrageous! Can’t you husband and wife just play around at night behind closed doors? You guys just had to fool around now, with everyone still anxiously waiting outside!

Chuyan used to be so good. It’s all that Zu An’s fault for leading her astray.

Her rage immediately boiled over at this thought.

Zu An picked up his scattered clothes and forced a smile. “I still haven’t completed Chuyan’s treatment! If we leave now, all the efforts we’ve put in would be ruined...”

Chu Chuyan was left speechless, but her stunned incomprehension was no match for Qin Wanru’s.

What was this fella trying to say? Don’t tell me he wants to continue?

Qin Wanru was about to lose her mind. “Are you trying to use this chance to take advantage of Chuyan?” she said coldly.

Zu An had a helpless expression on his face. He pointed towards Chu Chuyan. “If you don’t believe me, then ask her.”

Qin Wanru turned to look at her daughter. Her daughter had always been a prodigy at cultivation, so she naturally understood her body’s condition better than anyone.

“Some of the cold energy in my body has started to rebound again...” Chu Chuyan said with some hesitation. Her reserved nature as a young woman made her unwilling to admit this, but after managing many of the Chu clan’s affairs all these years, she had trained herself to remain rational at all times.

If Zu An was chased out now, then all of it would truly have been for naught.

Earlier on, she had been so sure that she was done for. She had even left behind so many last words.

In the end, she couldn’t let go of the Chu clan. Now that there was hope that she could live, how could she give it up because of a momentary impulse?

“Either way, Ah Zu and I are already... like that. A few more times wouldn’t make a difference.”

Even though Chu Chuyan had chosen her words carefully, her meaning was abundantly clear.

Qin Wanru’s mouth worked soundlessly.

She knew that her daughter was earnest to a fault. If she said so, then this was most likely the case.

Even though she felt some mild injustice, her daughter’s health was still the most important thing.

She had no choice but to rise to her feet. “You two... keep working hard, then. I’ll help watch the door.”

Why do these words sound so weird?!

Just what kind of situation have I gotten myself into?!

Qin Wanru wanted to give Zu An one final hateful look, but then she recalled what she’d seen earlier, and her expression instantly became unnatural. She hurried outside.

When her mother left, Chu Chuyan’s strong front disappeared without a trace. “It’s all your fault, making me so embarrassed.” She began to sob on the bed.

Zu An rushed over to console her. “All right, all right, it’s all my fault. I should’ve sensed her coming.”

His expression suddenly went blank as he spoke. The blankets covering Chu Chuyan’s body slid off as she began to sob, exposing her flawless body.

“You are still looking? Haven’t you seen enough already?” Chu Chuyan pulled the blankets back up in a panic. She made a fuss in order to hide her embarrassment.

Zu An said with a sigh, “Wife, you really are too beautiful! I wouldn’t get tired of looking at you for the rest of my lifetime.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

No matter how prideful and cold Chu Chuyan was normally, she was still a little girl who had just experienced her first awakening of love. A sweet feeling blossomed in her heart when her husband’s compliment reached her ears.

How could Zu An possibly resist such a beautiful and shy appearance? He dove into the sheets and embraced her.

“Why are you always so rough?” Chu Chuyan complained as he pressed her down roughly.

Zu An laughed. “Isn’t ‘Dominating Sword Immortal’ a favorite book of yours?”

“Ah! You scoundrel! So you did see it that day!” Chu Chuyan was so embarrassed, she wished fervently for a hole in which she could hide.

He could no longer hold himself back, planting a kiss on her perfect lips...

...

Chu Zhongtian and the others quickly surrounded Qin Wanru as she left the room. Bao Youlu seemed particularly curious.

“How is Chuyan doing?” Chu Zhongtian’s face was full of concern.

Qin Wanru’s face flushed red as the scene she’d witnessed appeared in her mind. “Ah Zu is currently treating her. She should be past the critical phase.”

Chu Zhongtian laughed loudly. “That’s good, that’s good. I have to give this son-in-law some credit.”

Qin Wanru was full of hidden resentment. You might have just killed him there and then if you had seen what he was doing to your daughter in that room!

Bao Youlu was effusive with his praise. “I didn’t expect the young master to have such miraculous skill! He is actually able to treat the young miss! This old one will have to consult him properly when he comes out.”

He had been the first one to diagnose Chu Chuyan back then, and formulating a cure had been beyond his abilities. Who would have expected that Zu An could save her? How could he not be curious?

Qin Wanru had a strange expression on her face. “I don’t think it’s something you can learn.”

Bao Youlu was miffed. “Madam, are you looking down on this old one? This old one still has some achievements in the field of medicine! Even that Ji Dengtu is only a tad bit better than I! What medical skill could there be in this world that I cannot learn?”

“This... I fear that you really might not be able to learn it. He had a very unique and special technique.” Taking in his elderly figure, that young and vigorous thing suddenly appeared in her mind. The powerful contrast made her heart jump. She chased those thoughts out of her head at once.

Bao Youlu wasn’t willing to let her off the hook, and continuously pelted her with questions. Qin Wanru found a random excuse to appease him. Afraid that he would continue to ask about this, she hastily said to her husband, “Dear, why hasn’t Huanzhao returned after so long? Did something happen to her?”

Chu Zhongtian was puzzled. “What can possibly happen in the estate?”

Qin Wanru replied, “She has always been close to her big sister. What if she gets mad when she hears about Qiu Honglei’s situation and uses the Wailing Whip on her? That would be the end of our Chu clan’s reputation!”

“You’re right! I’ll go and take a look right now!” Chu Zhongtian took off in a hurry.

He’d been too worried about Chu Chuyan to think about these things earlier.

Now that Chu Chuyan was no longer in danger, his heart grew more relaxed.

However, he began to panic again when the thought of Qiu Honglei’s beautiful figure being struck by the Wailing Whip emerged in his mind.

Although he harbored no other thoughts towards Qiu Honglei, as a man, he couldn’t bear to see the face of such an exceptional beauty like Qiu Honglei endure the slightest suffering. To him, it was almost an affront to heavenly grace.

Qin Wanru was filled with relief when she saw her husband leave. The matters between the young couple in this room were truly complicated, and it wasn’t convenient to tell him about these things yet.

However, making a father wait outside in ignorance seemed improper as well. That was why she’d found an excuse to send him away.

Bao Youlu was just about to ask for details on Zu An’s treatment method again, but she had taken this short pause to prepare an excuse to deflect him. She said quickly, “I must ask physician Bao to prepare some body-nurturing medication for Chuyan.”

“No problem.” Bao Youlu’s expression flipped instantly, now that he was finally of some use.

Just as he began to leave, Qin Wanru suddenly called out to him again. “Hold on. Please prepare some vitality-boosting medication as well.”

“Vitality boosting?” Bao Youlu was momentarily stunned, but then understanding struck him. With the young miss in her current condition, it would be good to prepare some vitality-boosting medicine, just in case.

As for those from the second and third branch who came over later, they were all turned away. Besides, Chu Yucheng was still seriously injured and needed proper care.

Qin Wanru finally sighed in relief when everyone had been sent away. She didn’t have to worry about anyone finding out about what was happening inside anymore.

A huge scandal was sure to erupt if word of something unexpected got out!

It’s all that Zu An’s fault. Her heart really was being tortured by this guy’s stuff!

Chu Zhongtian was midway to the guest rooms when he ran into Chu Huanzhao coming back. He immediately asked, “Little Huanzhao, what did you do with Lady Qiu?”

“I was just going to ask you about her! I didn’t find that woman at all!” Chu Huanzhao said with an angry huff. A strange look suddenly appeared in her eyes. “Dad, you’re being weird, really weird. She’s not your concubine, so why are you so nervous?”

Chu Zhongtian gave his daughter an annoyed look. “Just where did a brat like you learn to fill your head with so many random things?” He looked around at the Chu estate, his expression becoming a little strange. Did that woman come here to steal?
