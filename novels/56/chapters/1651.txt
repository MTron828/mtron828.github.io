Chapter 1600 – You Don’t Want Anyone Else to Know, Do You?

“Mas… Master!” Chu Chuyan cried, jumping in fright. After all, she had been talking about her master behind her back. Strictly speaking, that was quite ‘unfilial’.

Yan Xuehen said coldly, “You have been away from your seat for so long that it will seem rude to others. You should hurry and return to your seat.”

Chu Chuyan thought to herself, My master normally doesn’t care about what other people think at all. However, she had a guilty conscience and didn’t dare to argue. She meekly replied, “Yes, master…” Afterward, she gestured toward Zu An with her eyes, showing that there was nothing she could do. Then, she left quickly, almost as if she were running away.

Only Zu An and Yan Xuehen were left. The mood quickly turned awkward.

Fortunately, Zu An was rather shameless. He moved closer, but before he could say anything, Yan Xuehen recoiled as if she had been burned. She quickly took a few steps back and snapped, “Don’t come any closer!”

Zu An looked completely helpless as he asked, “Am I really that scary to you?”

A ‘terrifying’ memory appeared in Yan Xuehen’s mind. She looked away, her figure so cold that even the plum blossoms above looked as if they were shivering in fear.

Zu An sighed and said, “You left without even saying goodbye last time. I was worried that something had happened to you, and only when I heard from Chu Chuyan that you had returned to the White Jade Sect did I feel a bit more at ease.”

“What’s in the past is in the past,” Yan Xuehen said, cutting him off. “I came here to remind you to stay some distance away from Chuyan. With her great competition at hand, she needs to remain at peace with herself in order to bring out her greatest strength. The time she spent with you in the capital filled her with unsteady emotions. If she fights in that kind of state, she will most likely lose. She finally regained her mental state recently, and yet you showed up. If you really wish the best for her, then do not disturb her in this time.”

Zu An cursed, “Your Unshakable Daoist Manual really is a troublesome skill. It has all sorts of faults.”

“Shut up!” Yan Xuehen snapped, shooting him a look. “You’re not allowed to disgrace our sect’s skills.”

“Fine, fine, fine, I misspoke,” Zu An said. He knew how sacred the Unshakable Daoist Manual was to those from the White Jade Sect, so he changed the subject and moved closer to her, saying, “Maybe Chuyan can’t be disturbed because of her fight, but you don’t have any competitions. It’s fine if I come looking for you, right?”

“No way!” Yan Xuehen quickly cried out.

“Why not?” Zu An replied, looking at her calmly and leisurely. Seeing this woman, who was usually like a frozen queen, become so worked up really did feel unique.

“There is no ‘why’. if I say no, then it is a no,” Yan Xuehen said, turning around to leave. After taking two steps, she stopped and said, “I have already forgotten about what happened before. Nothing happened. I do not wish to harm anyone, especially Chuyan.”

Zu An grabbed her sleeve, protesting, “But you’ve hurt me!”

“I’ve hurt you?” Yan Xuehen repeated; she was so angry she actually laughed. Just who had hurt whom? “Are you this much of a scoundrel in front of Chuyan too?”

Zu An sighed and said,“You haven’t seen my truly scoundrelly side.”

Yan Xuehen was alarmed. Was that not enough, when you did whatever you wanted with my body? Of course, she would never dare to say that out loud and quickly composed herself. She replied, “Oh? Then may I ask this distinguished sir what your truly scoundrelly side looks like?”

Zu An cleared his throat and looked at her strangely, saying, “Big sis Yan, you don’t want that thing between us to be known by Chuyan, right?”

Yan Xuehen was stunned. Then, a deep blush visibly appeared on her neck. How could someone as intelligent as her not understand the implications behind those words?

What followed was an exceptional amount of Rage points.

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +499 +499 +499…

When he saw that she was about to lash out, Zu An quickly chuckled apologetically, saying, “Big sis Yan, I was just joking around. I’m not that kind of person.”

He had seen so many of those damned plotlines, and all of his online guy friends had thought that sentence had a mysterious power. He had always jokingly used those words online and hadn’t known how it would feel in reality.

When she heard his sincere tone, Yan Xuehen’s expression eased a bit. She said, “That’s good. Otherwise, Chuyan would really have chosen the wrong person.”

Zu An couldn't help but examine her features from up close. Her skin really was exquisite, making him want to kiss her. Of course, he knew that could only be wishful thinking. He said, “Big sis Yan, you seem to have lost some weight.”

Yan Xuehen almost rolled her eyes. Who wouldn’t lose weight from being so vexed and tormented day after day? She retorted, “If you could keep some distance away from me and start treating me with the same amount of respect as others do, I wouldn’t be losing weight.”

“Is there really a need to be like this? We can just keep things separate. There’s no conflict,” Zu An said, sounding vexed.

“You should just forget about everything,” Yan Xuehen replied, her expression clear. She was an extremely talented cultivator, and also the leader of a sect. Her will was extremely firm. She wouldn’t be easily tied up by romantic affairs. She didn’t wait for Zu An to reply and simply turned to leave.

Zu An was about to say something when he saw Sun Xun walk over from close by. He quickly shut his mouth.

Sun Xun was a bit surprised when he saw Yan Xuehen departing. Her beauty was really enough to produce ripples in any man’s heart.

Zu An shrugged and said, “It seems my luck isn’t so good. I didn’t find anything.”

Sun Xun said expressionlessly, “In that case, I suggest that Sir Zu return to your seat. It really would not be too good for you to move around recklessly in your host’s house.”

“That’s reasonable,” Zu An said. He had already saved Zhang Zitong, so there was naturally no need to stay behind anymore.

Along the way, Sun Xun remarked with an insincere smile, “Sir Zu really is more impressive than meets the eye. I have a whole new opinion of you.”

It was clear that Zu An was an unusual person from the way he had behaved on the way to the manor. Sun Xun had been too careless before and hadn’t provided King Yan with the correct information, which was why such a huge disturbance had happened in the room. King Yan would definitely criticize him for that later.

Zu An smiled and replied, “It’s fine; everyone has times when they can’t see properly.”

Sun Xun was speechless. This kid really knows how to console people!

You have successfully trolled Sun Xun for +366 +366 +366…

…

When they returned to their seats, Zu An noticed that the Heavenly Sorrow Sect’s disciples had returned one after another, clearly not having found anything either. Their expressions were all unpleasant. They clearly sighed in relief when they saw that he had returned without anything either.

“That assassin really is formidable. They were actually able to get away even with so many people after them,” Zhao Xiaodie said with a sigh. “Or maybe someone on the inside deliberately helped them get away.” She gave Zu An a look after saying that.

In truth, she was just casting blame baselessly. After all, there were so many people from Heavenly Sorrow present, and yet they had come back with nothing. It really was quite embarrassing. She had no idea that she had actually hit the nail on the head.

However, King Yan said disapprovingly, “A small thief like that is nothing significant. Let us not let it disturb our festivities today.”

When the guests saw that the host didn’t mind, the atmosphere quickly returned to how it had been before.

Zu An remarked with feigned ease, “When I was chasing after the assassin earlier, I ran into an elder in your respected home. I could tell that he was an expert who excelled in spiritual power from a single glance. The king’s manor really is full of talents!”

“The one you are speaking of is most likely Sir Huo. He is someone from the southern border and is indeed good in that field,” King Yan said proudly. Having many capable people under him was clearly something he was extremely proud of. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Guan Chouhai said, “As that Sir Huo excels in spiritual attacks, if the target was able to escape, they have to have been good at such skills too, or perhaps they had an appropriate defensive treasure on them. The king can carry out an investigation from that angle.”

King Yan replied happily, “Many thanks for your reminder, Sect Master Guan!”

…

Then, the mood became joyous and harmonious. Heavenly Sorrow’s disciples forgot about their earlier displeasure and began to chat about the upcoming competition.

Zu An remembered them mentioning that before too, so he turned around and asked Chu Chuyan, “What is that Great Sect Competition they’re talking about?”

Meanwhile, Zhi Yin and the others just sneered, thinking, This brat is quite clever, knowing that we won’t answer him if he asks us. But he really isn’t the brightest. Actually asking Miss Chu? Everyone knows that Miss Chu is very cold-natured and normally keeps a great distance from people.

Even someone as outstanding as Zhi Yin could only leave resentfully whenever he tried to talk to her with kind words. This brat was actually asking her in such a rude and direct way? It would be strange for Miss Chu to reply to him.

However, his eyes soon widened, because Chu Chuyan actually smiled at that brat! He thought, Why?! She’s never shown me a smile before!
