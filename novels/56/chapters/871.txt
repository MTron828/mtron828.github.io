Chapter 840: World Splitting

Elsewhere, Zu An ran as fast as he could with Bi Linglong. But when he sensed the sudden strangeness, he also stopped.

Let alone now, when Bi Linglong was extremely weak, even if she were in her best condition, she still wouldn’t be able to stand still on this quaking ground. She cried out in alarm and fell into Zu An’s warm embrace.

“Are you okay?” Zu An caught her and flew into the air. He didn’t dare to fly too high and only remained several meters above the ground. Otherwise, the emperor would be able to see them from a distance.

“I’m alright.” Bi Linglong blushed from the hug. Her young lady side made her want to subconsciously push him aside.

But the two of them were currently in midair! She would drop if she pushed him away. The ground below rose and fell like waves, and it was quite terrifying. To ease her embarrassment, she quickly asked, “What happened?”

Zu An shook his head. “I don’t know. I feel like something’s changed in this dungeon. The spatial element here has become extremely unstable. Something major might happen to this place soon.”

Bi Linglong was always dignified and proud when she acted as the crown princess, but wasn’t she still soft and lovely in his arms? As expected, even the toughest women were soft when hugged.

Zu An sighed in amazement when he smelled the noble fragrance coming from her clothes. There had always been a saying that dying for the sake of a woman was also a romantic thing. He hadn’t expected it to happen to himself. He would be confident in his chances of fighting the emperor if he were given a few more years. But right now, the difference between them was just too great…

“Hah, look at you using what I taught you to flirt with a girl. Do you feel good about yourself?” Mi Li remarked in dissatisfaction, interrupting Zu An’s thoughts.

“We’re so close already, so what’s the point of distinguishing between the two of us? What’s mine is yours, and what’s yours is obviously mine too,” Zu An replied with a smile.

“Who wants to be close to you?” Mi Li harrumphed. “You’re full of cunning plots, and you’re not all that respectful towards me normally either. I can’t let that continue! You’re not allowed to call me big sis or whatever; we’ll be master and disciple.”

“Master and disciple?” Zu An replied with a strange expression.

“What, are you unwilling?” Mi Li’s voice rose higher. “If you hadn’t received my pointers, do you think you’d have been able to grow to where you are today? You have no idea how many people tried to be my disciple, and yet I didn’t even give them a single look. Why are you still making up excuses when I’m the one saying I’ll take you in as my disciple?”

“Of course I’m willing.” Zu An chuckled. After being around her for so long, the two of them were already no longer on guard against each other the way they’d been before, and instead trusted each other. The things she’d taught him had brought him huge benefits, especially her knowledge that transcended ages. “But isn’t it pretty good being siblings? Why do you suddenly want me to call you master?”

“You don’t have to worry about that.” Mi Li cleared her throat. “Are you willing or not?”

“Sure.” Zu An didn’t ask too much when he sensed that something was off with her. “But I can’t really kowtow to you as my master, the way things are right now.”

“There’s no need for all of that. You just have to call me master,” Mi Li said.

“Mas… ter…” Zu An was still a bit embarrassed at first. But when he did say it, it didn’t seem like that big of a deal either.

“Good disciple.” Mi Li had a gentle smile on her usually dignified and beautiful face.

Zu An was speechless. He’d thought that perhaps it was for something important. Why did he now feel that she was only doing this to take advantage of him? Still, it didn’t matter. Whether he called her master or not made no difference.

Bi Linglong suddenly spoke. “There’s something strange going on with this world? Sigh, our situation is already so grim. When it rains, it really pours…”

When he heard the despair in her voice, Zu An consoled her. “It’s actually the opposite. It’s because of this sudden variable that we might have a chance to survive.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Bi Linglong was stunned. She was a smart person too, so she quickly realized what he was saying. She couldn’t help but sigh in praise. “Even though you’re always goofing around usually, you’re more cool-headed than anyone else would be in critical situations.”

“It can’t be helped; it’s just a habit I ended up having after constantly being on the brink of death.” Zu An chuckled.

Bi Linglong realized something she had never thought about. Indeed, ever since she had first received information on him, she’d found that ever since Zu An was in Brightmoon City, he had always walked on the precipice between life and death! She felt both sympathy and admiration.

Zu An was a bit apologetic as he said, “Sorry, I ended up getting you caught up in my mess. You could have continued to be the crown princess normally.”

Bi Linglong shook her head. “Ever since what happened between us at Concubine Bai’s place, there was already no way he would tolerate my existence. Sigh, I really never expected Ruizhi to have been possessed by his majesty.”

Even though she didn’t feel much love toward the crown prince, they had lived together as husband and wife for so many years. It was normal to develop feelings for even a cat or dog one kept around all the time. She couldn’t help but feel a bit awful when she learned that he had been possessed by his father.

“You’re right, no one expected it,” Zu An said. “The emperor has had his position for so long, his desire for immortality has become too strong. He’s willing to try anything for the sake of his objective.”

“What should we do now?” Bi Linglong had already lost her usual shrewdness and decisiveness. She was still a young lady after all. Anyone would become confused after going through so much in a single day.

The thought that her husband was actually her father-in-law was so horrifying it made her want to puke. WIth how powerful the emperor’s cultivation was, where could she possibly escape to?

“Let’s leave this dungeon first,” Zu An said. “If push comes to shove, I’ll bring you to the north’s fiend races. No matter how powerful the emperor is, his influence can’t reach that place.”

“The fiend races?” Bi Linglong was stunned and shook her head. “I can’t do that. I still have my family behind me. My status would cause a huge controversy among the fiend races. Countless people from my family would die because of me.”

Chu Chuyan, Zheng Dan, and the others had already shown Zu An the sense of responsibility the women of this world had toward their families. He quickly said, “I’m not asking you to announce your identity to the world. We can just live there in seclusion. We don’t have to worry about those things then.”

“Live in seclusion…” Bi Linglong’s face turned a bit red. It almost sounded as if she would be eloping with him. Her heart rate began to speed up. But soon afterward, she thought of the capital, about her ambitions and her years of effort going up in smoke. She felt disheartened again.

Just then, a voice said in the distance, “Heh, you two are still thinking of eloping?”

Zu An and Bi Linglong’s expressions changed. It was the emperor’s voice! Just as Zu An attempted to flee with Bi Linglong, the air and ki around him seemingly solidified. He couldn’t move at all.

Zhao Ruizhi’s fat figure appeared on the horizon. He took a light step, and in the next second, he was already standing in front of them.

“They’re over there!” He Li exclaimed with pleasant surprise. He ran over excitedly with his men, but when he saw that the emperor had arrived before them, he broke out into a cold sweat. He quickly said in praise, “Your majesty is all powerful after all. You arrived first even though you left after us! This humble one is overwhelmed with admiration.”

Zu An and Bi Linglong both frowned. These people had already defected to the emperor? What the hell were they still fighting for then? It wouldn’t be easy even if they were just facing these King Qi Manor experts, let alone if the emperor were also there.

Zu An’s heart sank to rock bottom. However, he didn’t give up, as he felt great resentment inside. At worst, he would just try to bluff it out with Keyboard Come and try to drag down the emperor with him.

As if sensing his thoughts, Mi Li said, “Don’t act rashly. It’s not that sort of time yet.”

Zu An asked happily, “Are you going to help?”

Mi Li shook her head. “I might be able to if I recover, but I’m not his match either right now.”

Zu An was stunned. He said, “I can’t even move right now under his aura’s pressure. How the hell am I supposed to fight him then?”

Mi Li said, “This is probably his domain. To put it simply, he’s using his powerful cultivation to redefine the ki laws of a set space, and that’s why you can’t move. Wait a second. Once I deconstruct these laws, you should be able to move freely again.”

Zu An smiled bitterly. This woman really was giving him a lot of credit. Even if he could move, he still didn’t stand a chance at all! However, he tossed that thought out as soon as it emerged. He’d just fight to the death if he had to. A man could lose his life, but not his pride!

As if sensing his fighting spirit, a startled expression flashed through the emperor’s eyes. “Hm? A lowly servant like you surprisingly has a bit of a spine. You aren’t willing to bow down to another after all. You can’t be left alive.”

As he finished speaking, he raised his finger. He didn’t want to waste any more words on Zu An and planned to directly kill him. But just then, his expression suddenly changed and he lowered his head.

An intense rumble emerged from the depths of the earth. The noise was louder than before, and it didn’t show any signs of stopping. The ground began to crack apart, revealing several bottomless crevices. Some of King Qi Manor’s deathsworn soldiers couldn’t dodge in time and fell in, screaming miserably as they dropped.

Zu An suddenly noticed that he could move. He quickly flew into the sky with Bi Linglong, evading the giant cracks that had appeared in the ground.

“Big sis… Master, did you break through his domain?” Zu An asked excitedly.

Mi Li shook her head. “No. The laws of this world have changed. The emperor’s domain can’t compare to the true power of a world.”

When he saw Zu An’s arm wrap around Bi Linglong’s slender waist, and Bi Linglong also wrapping her arms tightly around his body, Zhao Ruizhi’s eyes released powerful killing intent.
