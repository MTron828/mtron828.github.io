Chapter 1753: Performance

Zu An couldn't help but give Jing Teng a look. He was a bit confused, but when he saw that she remained completely calm, he figured that it was just a coincidence.

Jing Teng couldn't help but ask, “Why are you looking at me like that?”

“Why did you choose that name? Is that your original name?” Zu An asked. Had he ended up meeting an old friend in a foreign place or something?

“When I had a good relationship with that man, he called me Little Tiantian. Later, when he learned what I really was, he called me a vine monster,” Jing Teng said, her tone especially cold.[1]

Qiu Honglei asked, “If you’re using a name with such significance, does it mean you still feel something for that person?”

Jing Teng’s expression was ice-cold as she replied, “I just wanted to make sure I’d never forget about that past betrayal.”

The others were speechless.

Zu An sighed inwardly in relief. It was just a coincidence after all. Then, he asked why they weren’t supposed to give their real names.

Jing Teng replied, “There are many strange abilities that can be activated using someone’s name. That’s why you shouldn’t give out your names in uncertain circumstances.”

“Thank goodness I had the lady’s reminder,” Zu An said gratefully. If they hadn’t had a ‘native’ here with them, they would really have bumped into a lot of trouble along the way.

“The young master is too polite,” Jing Teng said with a slight nod, her expression no longer as cold as before.

Meanwhile, Wei Suo’s eyes darted back and forth between the two of them. Then, he secretly gave Zu An a closer look. When he saw that Zu An remained completely calm, he couldn't help but feel admiration again.

Boss really is the boss. He has his girlfriend with him, and yet he can still flirt with other women. More importantly, his girlfriend seems to approve of it… Why does no one like someone like me who’s devoted and true? This makes no sense!

“I still need to continue patrolling and can’t keep you company. There are people in the manor who will guide you inside,” Zhang Yong said after cupping his hands.

“Thank you very much, Brother Zhang!” Zu An returned his greeting. Then, he watched as the guards disappeared into the distance. They had some cultivation, but it wasn’t that high. Even Wei Suo would be able to crush them. It seemed as if this really was just a normal manor.

Then, Uncle Wang personally brought them in. Zu An was a bit surprised, saying, “There was no need to trouble your respected self.”

Judging from his status, Uncle Wang seemed to be the butler of the place. Wasn’t he acting a bit too enthusiastic in personally guiding them? Could it be because of the gifts Zu An had just given?

“It’s not any trouble, no trouble at all. Pretty much all the guests have already arrived, and there shouldn’t be any more guests. I don’t have anything better to do either,” the elder said with a smile as he began to walk forward.

They couldn't continue to reject him, so they followed behind him.

…

The courtyard was decorated with lanterns and banners hanging overhead, adorned with big ‘double happiness’ characters.

Zu An noticed that Qiu Honglei kept staring at the lanterns. He quietly asked, “What’s wrong?”

“I can’t help but feel as if these lanterns are a bit strange,” Qiu Honglei pointed out. “These lanterns are so big, so this place should be really bright. However, the light seems to have been sealed up by something. It isn’t coming out and can’t illuminate the surroundings.”

The entire group was stunned. Only now did they notice that the lanterns were bright red, and yet the surroundings were still quite dark and weren’t illuminated. Their cultivation was quite high, and they had already reached a point where they could see even in the dark. That was why they hadn’t noticed at first. However, Qiu Honglei was a light element cultivator, so she was especially sensitive to such things.

Wei Suo didn’t seem to mind it and said, “Maybe it’s just because the villagers were trying to show off and set up all the lights, but they felt as if putting a huge candle inside each one would be a bit too much of a waste, so they used some smaller candles to achieve this effect.” He was still a bit upset at the old man asking for a bridal gift.

Zu An said seriously, “Everyone, remain vigilant. Be careful.”

Qiu Honglei smiled sweetly at the butler and asked, “Uncle Wang, could you tell us the name of your young miss?”

She was extremely beautiful to begin with, and as she used her charm skill, every frown and smile she made was full of endless allure. Even Jing Teng couldn't help but give her an extra look.

Uncle Wang was stunned, but then he said kindly, “Our young miss is surnamed Zhang. This is the Zhang clan’s manor. As for her distinguished name, only the master, madam, and some womenfolk in the inner courtyard know it. In truth, it is only because it is you that I am saying this. If someone else immediately asked for our young miss’ name, this Old Wang would already have driven them out.”

Zu An thought to himself, This world is really on the more conservative side. Only the parents and future husband can know your name?

“I really am sorry. It seems I went too far,” Qiu Honglei said with a pitiful expression.

Old Wang was now the one who felt awkward, and advised her to not worry too much. Qiu Honglei then took the chance to gather all sorts of information about the manor.

They learned from the butler that Miss Zhang was a famous beauty in the area, who had attracted endless suitors. Even the city lord’s young master had been infatuated with her and wanted to make her his wife.

However, she had a childhood sweetheart, and the two clans were old friends. Tragically, something ended up happening to the man’s clan and he was the only one to survive. Despite that, Miss Zhang didn’t mind at all and instead showed him her affection.

The master and madam had been a bit unwilling, but when they saw how happy their daughter was, and remembered how he was the son of their old friends, they had agreed in the end. However, the condition was that he had to move in with them. The two clans were just too far apart, and they had once been beautiful childhood sweethearts, so the young man naturally didn’t refuse.

Today was the day of their marriage.

Even Qiu Honglei was a bit affected by the festivities. She couldn't help but grab Zu An’s arm and fantasize about their wedding.

Perhaps it was because of Qiu Honglei’s charms, but even though strangers should have been seated in the most remote corner, they were brought to a table in front.

“You can just sit here. The wedding ceremony has not begun yet. Please enjoy the show to pass the time. I still have something else to take care of and will not be disturbing you,” Uncle Wang said, cupping his hands toward them with a big smile before leaving.

Zu An and the others now noticed that there was a spacious stage in front of them. On it was a group of opera singers who were performing; the other tables all voiced their praise. The atmosphere was quite lively. Zu An and the others had hurried along all day, so they felt much more relaxed now that they were able to sit down. Wei Suo had already begun grabbing the fruits and refreshments on the table.

“Are you that hungry?” Jing Teng asked, unable to help but give Wei Suo another look when she saw him gorge himself.

“We just gave a bridal gift, so of course we have to eat more to earn it back,” Wei Suo replied with a muffled voice. “Besides, I threw up too much earlier, so I’m really, really hungry.”

Jing Teng and Qiu Honglei had been about to grab some refreshments, but suddenly pulled back their hands. They were clearly grossed out by him.

…

Just then, a new opera show began, garnering attention from the preoccupied audience again. It was about the romance of a noble clan’s daughter and a sweetheart she loved. Jing Teng and Qiu Honglei had big smiles on their faces; they clearly enjoyed such love stories a lot.

Next, the scene quickly changed. A wealthy young master favored the daughter and used all sorts of methods to pursue her. However, she was completely devoted to her lover and didn’t have any interest in the rich young master, who could only leave in disappointment.

Then, love eventually found a way, and the woman got married to her sweetheart.

Qiu Honglei sighed and said, “I was just going to say that there had to be a happy ending. After all, this is a wedding ceremony!”

Jing Teng nodded in agreement.

However, their expressions quickly froze, because the story began moving in a strange direction. The rich young master also appeared in the celebration. After getting the groom drunk, he carried him to the inner room. Then, he took the chance to rape the bride.

Forget about the two women, even Zu An was stupefied. Is this plot from some damned Japanese porno?

The bride sobbed and sobbed. She tried to report what had happened to her parents and get revenge, but after the officials rushed over, they said that the groom had gotten drunk and came up with an evil plan, suddenly going to his little aunt’s bed.

When he saw this scene, Zu An felt a sense of deja vu. Right after entering this world, he had also been framed for climbing into Huanzhao’s bed.

The show continued. The officials said that while the groom was carrying out the rape, the parents of the girl rushed over and berated him for his beastly behavior, but he had ended up killing them. Meanwhile, the daughter was already married to the man, so she was also taken prisoner. Thus, the two were sentenced and locked up.

Qiu Honglei cried furiously “This is nonsense! Just what kind of damned officials are these? They don’t have any conscience!”

Jing Teng was calmer in comparison, saying, “The officials of this world are all like this. You’ll get used to it.”

Zu An looked all around him. He saw that the others were watching with keen interest, as if they were obsessed. He was confused. Was such a show really appropriate for a wedding? The scene seemed a bit off.

He got up to strike up a conversation with some guests at a nearby table. He wanted to obtain some information from them, but they all had strange smiles on their faces and didn’t respond to him at all. They were fully focused on the stage.

Zu An shivered. He returned to the table and quietly warned the group, “Something isn’t right!”

Qiu Honglei and Jing Teng also nodded. They had also noticed that something was wrong.

Wei Suo peeled peanuts and chomped on them while pointing at the stage and saying, “You guys, look what’s happening!”

A new twist occurred. An envoy of the imperial palace came to investigate this case, and restored the innocence of the two lovers. The rich young master, as well as the officials he had bribed, were all executed. Some were bisected at the waist, while others were beheaded. Some even suffered death from a thousand cuts.

That wasn’t the most important part, as it was all supposed to just be a show.

But in Zu An and the others’ eyes, the singers were being pushed into torture devices, after which blades were brought down again and again, and blood splashed everywhere. Wasn’t this a bit too lifelike?

A head suddenly rolled over to them, its eyeballs bulging out. Bloody tears flowed out from its sockets. It wasn’t a prop, but rather a real head!

“Stop!” Zu An roared. What the hell was wrong with this manor? Just who was using the performance to commit murder?Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Suddenly, Qiu Honglei cried out. Zu An quickly turned around and saw that their teacups had all become red with blood. The plates of fruits and food suddenly turned into maggots and rats.

Wei Suo, who had been eating with great relish, immediately froze when he saw what was happening!
