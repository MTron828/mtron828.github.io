Chapter 427: No Way Out

Translator: Pika

Mi Li mistook his silence for discouragement. Her tone softened, and she said, “Don’t worry. With your magic weapon, the secret manuals that others could only ever yearn for, and your transcendent aptitude, you don’t need to feel too bothered about this current situation.”

Zu An gave her a look of surprise. “Big sis empress, I didn’t expect your voice to sound so pleasant when you’re being nice. I almost thought you were a different person.”

Mi Li just couldn’t understand what was up with him.

“Do you actually want me to always be strict on you? What’s wrong with you?”

Zu An chuckled and said, “Not at all, not at all. Of course I prefer it when you’re being nice. But you can’t be too nice, or else you’ll lose the sex appeal that comes from being a powerful empress.”

“Piss off!” Mi Li was momentarily speechless. She had no idea how to reply to that, so she quickly disappeared and went back to sleep.

“I really have no idea if she’s actually sleeping or not...” Zu An muttered as he looked out the window in the direction of the Chu Estate, a pensive expression on his face.

...

Liu Yao was busy searching the estate with his Imperial Guard.

The Chu clan’s Master, Madam, and the Red Cloak Army had been suppressed by the imperial edict, so they could no longer stop the search.

Jiang Luofu frowned. She had come to act as a mediator, but the emperor’s personal interference made any further persuasion meaningless. The only thing she could do now was to see if she could do anything to save them from extinction.

As for Zu An, she could only wish him the best.

She had no idea how in the world this kid had offended the emperor. He actually managed to instigate such a huge disaster!

I wonder if His Majesty will pardon his crimes if his transcendent aptitude is reported. After all, such legendary aptitude is just too rare.

Then again, envy was an inextricable part of human nature. If the emperor found out how great his potential was, it might only further strengthen his resolve to get rid of him.

She found herself in a dilemma. She had always been a decisive person, so this was a rare feeling.

King Liang stepped forward. “So, everyone believes me now, right? Principal Jiang, City Lord Xie, do you two have any more opinions to share?”

Jiang Luofu frowned, but didn’t say anything.

Xie Yi immediately smiled apologetically. “None at all! We will let King Liang take charge of everything.”

Are you kidding me? An imperial edict had appeared, and the fear they’d felt from that immensely powerful pressure that had accompanied it still lingered. Even now, he was questioning his decision to side with King Qi.

However, with things already the way they were, there was no way for him to switch patrons at this point. Fortunately, the emperor’s days were already numbered. His only job at this point was to send a report to King Qi as quickly as possible, so he could make plans ahead of time.

Xie Daoyun bit her lip. She knew her father had no choice but to act the way he did. This truly wasn’t something that could be decided by their Xie clan.

She could only hope that Zu An would be able to get away safely.

By this time, Liu Yao had come out, having finished the search of the Chu Estate. He shook his head. “He’s not here.”

King Liang looked at the Master and Madam of the Chu clan. “I believe Brightmoon Duke has heard the imperial edict as well. If you do not hand Zu An over, the entire Chu clan will follow that kid into the grave.”

He felt incredibly happy to see the people who had placed him in such a sorry state earlier end up looking so distraught.

Chu Zhongtian and Qin Wanru exchanged glances. Their faces were extremely pale.

Qin Wanru couldn’t help but say, “You all saw for yourselves that Ah Zu isn’t here. How are we supposed to hand over someone that we aren’t even sheltering?”

King Liang said coldly, “That’s for you to worry about. It's none of my business. Who was the one who decided to take in Zu An as their son-in-law?”

He stationed the Imperial Guard around the Chu Estate and decided to get some rest. It was much better to lie down in a warm place, away from this frigid atmosphere.

That’s right, Isn’t the Immortal Abode in Brightmoon City? I’ve heard that it was quite excellent. Qiu Honglei is there, and she has quite the reputation. I should take a look and experience her for myself.

However, it felt odd to suggest this on his own initiative. Why are these Brightmoon Officials so slow? Shouldn’t they be the ones taking the initiative to make me feel welcome?

As if sensing his dissatisfaction, Xie Yi rushed over with a smile and said, “King Liang, General, the two of you have come all the way to Brightmoon City. Please, let this humble one help you experience the local flavors of Brightmoon City.”

King Liang immediately felt pleased, but he feigned a troubled look. He stroked his beard and said, “Surely that’s too much to ask. I wouldn’t dream of troubling Lord Xie.”

“Not at all, not at all. Respectfully, this humble one also wishes to hear more about the capital city from both you and General Liu!” Xie Yi said with a smile.

Liu Yao laughed heartily. “I will guide Lord Xie around the capital in the future if there is a chance! Haha.”

Xie Daoyun was slightly disappointed by her father’s fawning attitude. She preferred to distance herself from such behavior, but she didn’t feel any real contempt for her father.

As the child of an official, she knew that entertaining guests was an important part of his duties. She was busy burying herself in poetry and the arts, while her younger brother ran around chasing girls, so her father was the one who had to shoulder everything alone.

When everyone had left, Xie Daoyun walked over to console the husband and wife duo of the Chu clan. “Brightmoon Duke, Madam Chu, are you two all right? Should I call Divine Physician Ji?”

Chu Zhongtian shook his head. “These are just minor injuries.” He thought about the bleak future facing the Chu clan, and sighed deeply.

“Uncle, please do not feel too worried,” Xie Daoyun said. “Surely there’s a way to solve this problem.”

Despite her own words, she herself could see no way out for them.

Qin Wanru said, “Thank you Miss Xie, for your help earlier.”

She obviously realized that it had been Xie Daoyun who had brought her father here, and she also heard about how she had helped Ah Zu enter the city. However, even though she was grateful, she couldn’t help but find this a little odd. When did the two of them develop such a cordial relationship?

Their Ah Zu didn’t have many other skills, but his way with women was truly top notch. She might have been worried if they weren’t currently in a crisis, but right now, the more of these female friends he had, the better. They could aid him, at least, and if there was some princess or someone like that among them, then that would be even better. Maybe that would help him come out of this conflict with the emperor unscathed.

Huh? Wait a second. The emperor keeps saying that Ah Zu stole something of his. Don’t tell me it’s his daughter... DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Madam is too kind.” Xie Daoyun was worried about Zu An’s next steps. She clearly wasn’t in the mood to chat, so she bade her farewells and left with a heavy heart.

Jiang Luofu also walked over to them and said quietly, “Ah Zu left your second daughter in the academy’s staff residences. Given the current situation, I will keep her there for now. The two of you need not worry. Even if something does happen, I will ensure her safety.”

Her unspoken words were clear. If the Chu clan really was eradicated, she would continue to protect Chu Huanzhao.

Gratitude shone in the eyes of both Chu Zhongtian and his wife. “Thank you, principal!”

Even the emperor had gotten involved. With matters the way they were, there was not much room for hope. The fact that she was willing to preserve some of their bloodline was already a huge favor.

Qin Wanru asked, “By the way, is Ah Zu in the academy?”

Jiang Luofu shook her head. “No one knows where he is right now.”

Qin Wanru sighed. “That’s good. If Principal Jiang runs into him, please help me pass on a message. He absolutely must not come back! They’ve already set up an inescapable net.”

Even though King Liang and Liu Ya had left, those ten embroidered envoys remained, and the Imperial Guard was still present. The Chu clan had lost all power to resist them.

“Also, tell him to look for Chuyan, and rescue her... her younger brother. They should find a place to lay low and live incognito. Do not let Chuyan seek revenge.”

From her tone, it sounded as if she were already passing on her last words. Jiang Luofu frowned, but in the end she still nodded in acknowledgment. “I will.”

During the next three days, the Chu clan held meetings around the clock, trying to find a way out. However, every option was rejected. This situation was just too grim.

Suddenly, an elder with a walking stick cursed, “It’s all Zu An’s fault! He is the source of this whole catastrophe!”

With him taking the lead, more and more people began to curse Zu An.
