Chapter 1729: You Didn’t Expect That, Did You?

Zu An released a light cough and said, “King Qi, things such as feelings need both parties to be each other’s sunshine. Interfering like that would make a relationship cease to be pure.”

He didn’t have much of a relationship with Zhao Xiaodie to begin with, let alone speaking of marriage. But if he refused King Qi outright when the latter was betrothing his daughter in front of everyone, that would really be too much of a blow to his pride. As such, Zu An wanted to refuse in a more tactful manner.

But who would have thought that the women next to him would immediately raise their ears? 

Be each other’s sunshine?

You have trolled the women around you for +111 +111 +111…

Zu An’s entire body started growing numb when he saw the increasing Rage points.

Fortunately, Zhao Han spoke up, helping him out of his awkwardness. “Zu An, you know just how much Zhao Jing has suffered over the years because of you. His prestige has taken a huge blow. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be taking such desperate actions today like a cornered dog. After forcing him into such a position, do you really think he will actually tolerate you?

“Even if we take a thousand steps back and he barely manages to overlook it, would all those people who follow him accept you? A few days ago, you saw for yourself how they were itching to get rid of you.”

Zu An nodded slightly and said, “What your majesty is saying makes a bit of sense.”

King Qi immediately panicked when he saw Zu An’s changing attitude. He continued, “Don’t tell me you’ve already forgotten that a bunch of the same people who wanted you executed were among his own trusted aides? I’ve lost quite a few men over the years and just happen to need people. On the contrary, he isn’t lacking people at all. How could they possibly allow a latecomer like you to climb above them?”

Zu An nodded again and said, “What King Qi said makes a bit of sense.”

Zhao Han and Zhao Jing were both speechless. The two of them realized that this brat was actually waiting for the best offer, and that he wasn’t about to make a quick decision at all.

Zhao Han gave the brooding Yan Xuehen a look, saying, “Sect Master Yan, I believe that Li Changsheng’s actions were all of his own accord. You have always maintained an unsullied and pure character. There is no need for you to follow his bad example. As long as you help this emperor, I will just let White Jade Sect’s matter pass.”

Yan Xuehen’s eyes moved a bit. She had indeed been worried that this matter would endanger the White Jade Sect.

King Qi shouted, “Fairy Yan, Li Changsheng and many White Jade Sect disciples were involved in this matter. With Zhao Han’s breadth of mind, how could he possibly pretend that this kind of thing never happened? After the matter, he will definitely settle things for good! Rather than live with that worry, why not just get rid of that possibility and side with Li Changsheng? You could even establish tremendous achievements! Has the White Jade Sect not been oppressed enough by that man over the years? If I rise to the throne, I will definitely reverse the limitations he imposed. On the contrary, I will greatly support your daoist sects!”

Yan Xuehen’s pretty brows furrowed. She didn’t have much interest in achievements, but she knew that what he was saying was the truth. Would Zhao Han really let things go after Li Changsheng had participated in this rebellion?

Seeing as she still didn’t reply, King Qi then looked at Yun Jianyue and said, “Sect Master Yun, the Holy Sect’s Marshal Lu is also a part of this affair. We are actually natural allies. Once the matter passes, I will inform the world about everything and restore your reputation, as well as cancel your arrest warrants. Your Holy Sect will be able to stand proudly before the world.”

Zu An was full of admiration as he listened. He had to admit that this man really was good at adapting to situations and making the most of them. No wonder he had been able to gain such prestige and become a publicly revered great sage.

Yun Jianyue frowned when she heard that. She was the sect master, and yet she actually hadn’t known about Lu Sanyuan’s participation in this affair. Over the years, Lu Sanyuan had fought in one place after another with his volunteer army. His reputation had grown greater and greater with each battle, his prestige climbing higher and higher. She had almost started to feel as if she couldn't control him anymore.

After all, the Devil Sect wasn’t one united community. Just as the daoists were divided into nine major sects, the Devil Sect had many factions as well. Yun Jianyue and Lu Sanyuan were leaders of different factions. In the past, when the court’s influence was too great, they had had the same powerful enemy, and hadn’t minded putting aside their differences. But over the years, more and more rifts had grown in their relationship.

Now, it turned out he had even kept something so major from her! He had unknowingly put the entire Holy Sect at such a huge risk! Yun Jianyue felt irritation brew within her as soon as she thought of that.

Zhao Han couldn't help but curse and say, “Zhao Jing, you really have no respect for your ancestors at all! They went through so much effort to get to where we are today, and yet you’ve now completely sold yourself out!”

It wasn’t unreasonable for him to be upset. A hundred years prior, the Buddhist and daoist sects had been shockingly powerful. The world had only known those powers and not cared about the court. The Zhou Dynasty had used the war against the Fiend races and several generations of effort as an opportunity to finally subdue the Buddhists, daoists, and even the Devil Sect. And yet now, Zhao Jing was actually tossing all that effort straight down the drain!

Zhao Jing didn’t give an inch either, retorting, “Hmph, you only oppressed them out of your own selfish desires. Only by allowing the arts free expression can we improve together.”Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Both sides were growing more and more red-faced when Ruhua coughed lightly and asked, “Could it be that you have all forgotten about this poor daoist?”

The place suddenly fell silent.

Right! He’s the one with the strongest cultivation here! If we were going to rope in someone, it should be him!

Zu An said with a respectful expression, “Your majesty, King Qi, it’s not that I don’t want to help, but rather that an earth immortal isn’t someone I can defeat. I really am unable to help as I would like to.”

Zhao Han said, “Even though he succeeded in his plot against me, he was also injured by me. He isn’t even close to his strongest condition right now. If you all work together, you can defeat him.”

Zu An and the other women exchanged a look. In the end, they didn’t move.

Ruhua revealed a smile and said, “Your majesty, please don’t trouble them anymore. Zu An is a smart person and naturally doesn’t wish to get involved in these dirty waters. This is something between the two of us, so let’s not trouble others anymore.”

Afterward, he walked toward the emperor slowly, each step slow and heavy. It was clear that with Zhao Han’s prestige, even though the emperor was injured, he still had to act carefully.

Zhao Han’s expression remained calm as he asked, “Ruhua, aren’t you curious as to why I’m not alarmed in the slightest even now?”

Ruhua suddenly paused and said, “I am indeed a bit curious.”

Zhao Han had said that it was because of Zu An’s group, but it seemed as if that group didn’t want to help. They couldn’t be his trump card.

Zhao Han looked at King Qi. A mocking smile appeared on his lips as he asked, “Zhao Jing, aren’t you feeling quite proud of yourself now that you’ve managed to injure me?”

“What can I say? I do feel a bit proud.” King Qi harrumphed. “You’ve flaunted yourself as invincible, but in the end, this was it.”

Zhao Han said calmly, “The only thing I didn’t anticipate was Ruhua’s century-long scheme. However, all of your plans were nothing more than a joke to me.”

King Qi roared with laughter and exclaimed, “Look around you! Your old friend, your trusted aides, and even those Embroidered Envoys and Imperial Guards who were absolutely loyal to you have all died. Even you yourself have fallen like this. Don’t you find your words a bit laughable?”

“Ignorant,” Zhao Han said with a sneer. “The Phoenix Nirvana Sutra you obtained before… You must have thought that it was the will of the heavens for you to receive it, right? I regret to inform you that what you cultivated was just something I forged. I actually have to thank Zu An over here for that.”

Zu An narrowed his eyes slightly. Zhao Han mentioning such a thing now was clearly to drive a wedge between him and King Qi’s relationship, to destroy any chance of them becoming allies.

However, King Qi remained calm. He gave Zu An a glance, then said calmly, “Brother emperor, I know you far too well. How could you possibly let me have any chance of getting my hands on such a skill? I never believed it was real from the beginning. My efforts to obtain it were nothing more than a cover to numb you. You didn’t expect that, did you? Don’t you feel quite disappointed right now?”

He grinned as he spoke, looking satisfied that he had seen through the scheme. Zhao Han, you bastard, you think too highly of yourself! All of your scheming is nothing more than the tricks of a clown before me.

Zu An was a bit surprised. These two brothers weren’t easy to deal with after all! The fact that King Qi had been able to face the emperor for so many years was proof in itself of his skill.

However, Zhao Han wasn’t shocked at all. He replied, “Oh? It seems you’re not as stupid as I thought… but not as smart, either. Do you really think the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra was the only thing I fed you over the years?

“Are you not curious as to why, even though you were wandering at the life soul grandmaster rank for all that time, you were suddenly able to break through into the earth immortal rank? Do you really think it was because of your luck?”

No one knew what King Qi was thinking, but his expression changed greatly.

Zhao Han suddenly reached out his hand and grabbed toward him. A soul projection was sucked straight out of King Qi’s flesh, entering his palm.
