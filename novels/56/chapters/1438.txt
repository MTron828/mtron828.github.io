Chapter 1387: Method of Salvation

Zu An hadn’t expected the Fiend Emperor to be so lacking in moral principles. He was already one of the world’s strongest. Shouldn’t he have felt a bit of excitement to find a rare opponent? He thought, What the hell? Those stupid webnovels were lying to me!

Then, the Taowu beast gradually approached. The group all felt their lifespans flowing away and their spirits growing weak, as if their minds were already being infected by the strong resentment.

Yun Jianyue had been preparing to attack with her Crescent Ring, but it began wobbling back and forth, and she lost control of it. It dropped to the ground.

Yan Xuehen’s arm also dropped powerlessly as soon as she raised the Snowflake Sword.

Yu Yanluo was surprisingly better off, but her cultivation was the lowest there. With her strength, there was no way she could stop the terrifying monster. She thought about using the Medusa Eye, but the Taowu was an earth immortal, something that was too far above her. Furthermore, there was such strong resentment all around them. The Medusa’s Eye wouldn’t necessarily be able to even petrify the surface of its skin.

Zu An swallowed his saliva and said, “Big bro Taowu, the one who killed the most of your disciples and children is that one over there. This doesn’t have anything to do with us, you know?” He picked up the Nine Cauldron and pointed it in the Fiend Emperor’s direction.

“What an idiot!” The Golden Crow Crown Prince burst out laughing. This guy’s actually trying to reason with a monster? He’s trying to shift that disaster this way?

You look pretty quick normally, so why do you seem kind of mentally deficient now? It would be way weirder if this Taowu or whatever could actually hear you.

The Taowu roared furiously toward the sky when it saw Zu An’s movement, as if it were enraged. It suddenly jumped at him.

Zu An was alarmed, but he still frantically used his ki to activate the Star Shattering Imprint. At the same time, he took out the Poisonous Prick to stake it all against the creature. Still, he clearly understood that the Poisonous Prick normally only worked against living things. The Taowu didn’t seem to be a living thing at all, so the Poisonous Prick wouldn’t necessarily work.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Taowu was about to reach him when its eyes darted toward the Nine Cauldron in his hands. A confused look flickered through its eyes. Then, it turned on the spot, charging at the Fiend Emperor’s group.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince’s smile immediately froze on his face. What the hell is wrong with this monster? It really listened to what Zu An said?!

An earth immortal monster had begun charging at him! The tremendous pressure made it a bit hard for him to even breathe. He could only instinctively hide behind his father.

Wu Liang was already curled up in a ball and trembling all over. It was as if he couldn't care less what was happening in the outside world, because it had nothing to do with him.

The Fiend Emperor hadn’t expected the Taowu to suddenly charge at him. However, he didn’t have time to think about it in more detail. He quickly raised his hand to counterattack. A fight quickly broke out between the two of them.

The terrifying blast waves created were so powerful that the two at his side coughed out blood on the spot. Fortunately, the Fiend Emperor was worried about his son’s safety, so he spared a bit of strength to send the Golden Crow Crown Prince several hundred zhang out.

As Wu Liang was rolled up in a ball, the force sent him rolling far away like a bowling ball.

The Fiend Emperor was a bit surprised by the fatty’s skills, but he didn’t have the luxury to care about someone unimportant like Wu Liang at that moment. Even though the giant monster’s strength was beneath his, it wasn’t enough for a decisive victory. He didn’t dare to be careless.

…

Meanwhile, Zu An was also stunned. He had just said what he said for the heck of it. He hadn’t expected the Taowu to really go after the Fiend Emperor. When he recovered from his daze, he quickly grabbed the women’s hands and yelled, “Run!”

The women reacted quickly too. After all, the Fiend Emperor was fighting against the monster. If they didn’t take advantage of that opportunity, what were they waiting for?

When the Fiend Emperor saw that, he wanted to stop them, but the Taowu was too strong. He couldn't afford to be distracted during such an important battle. However, he figured that Zu An had the Puppet Curse on him either way, and the other women seemed to have a special relationship with him, so it wouldn’t be too late to look for them after.

…

Zu An’s group ran up the mountain. Along the way, there were much fewer black monsters. They had clearly been startled by the Fiend Emperor and the Taowu’s battle. They all instinctively stayed far away. Even so, those that remained were still hard to deal with in the group’s current state.

Fortunately, Yu Yanluo still had some strength left, so she continued to use her World Painting and her Medusa skills. Together with the White Lotus Flame Zu An released from time to time, they were able to just barely keep the path ahead clear.

After they ran for a long, long time, they became slower and slower. They grew weaker and weaker too. Even their minds were becoming muddled. The resentment around the Taowu had taxed their bodies too much.

Even though Zu An’s body was extremely tough, the black scales reached all the way to his neck. Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were in a worse state, however. Even their faces were starting to be covered in black scales. The scales weren’t tangible things, and yet they glinted sinisterly.

The two grandmasters were already completely powerless and half-unconscious. The only reason they hadn’t collapsed yet was because they were relying completely on Zu An and Yu Yanluo.

Zu An wanted to use Grandgale to quickly accelerate, but for some reason, Grandgale actually didn’t respond at all. He didn’t know whether it was scared of the Taowu, or simply affected by the resentment around them.

Helpless to do anything else, he tried taking the Wind Fire Wheels to bring them up the mountain. However, this environment seemed to restrict flight, so the Wind Fire Wheels weren’t able to rise too high. Furthermore, even if they could fly close to the ground, the black monsters seemed to have gone mad, continuing to rush over from all directions to attack them. That made it so the resentment around them only became stronger and stronger. After trying it a few times, they could only give up and walk on the ground.

Finally, Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue could no longer hold on. Zu An secretly asked Mi Li, “Master empress, is there anything we can do about this?”

“No. With your constitution, if you let them go, there’s a small chance that you can reach the mountaintop before the resentment consumes you completely.” Mi Li said coldly.

Zu An replied seriously, “Am I someone who’s only interested in saving my own neck and would abandon my companions?”

“You sound pretty righteous, but aren’t you only doing this because they’re pretty?” Mi Li sneered.

Zu An said in an upright manner, “Since we’re companions, I can’t abandon or give up on them. It has nothing to do with beauty.”

“Can someone ugly become your companion?” Mi Li retorted with a sneer.

Zu An was speechless. However, he didn’t have the strength to argue with her right now. He quickly asked, “Doesn’t the Primordial Origin Sutra have anti-evil effects? Why wasn’t it too effective when I used it earlier?”

“Strictly speaking, the Primordial Origin Sutra is more effective against the energy of departed spirits. What’s affecting you right now is a kind of resentment energy, and a crazy amount of it. I really don’t know just what kind of injustice would create such a terrifying resentment,” Mi Li explained. “Resentment is different from death energy. That’s why it isn’t too likely that you can save them through primordial ki.

“Still, you should be happy, because true primordial ki has a bit of resistance against this resentment. Otherwise, how could you still remain conscious right now? You would have already become like those two women,” Mi Li explained with a harrumph.

Zu An said in surprise, “From the very start, you were still in the mood to joke around with me. That means you definitely have a way, right?”

Mi Li was speechless. This kid really is too smart for his own good.

“Didn’t you notice that Medusa is more or less fine? It’s probably because of that Lord Sui’s Pearl thing you guys got earlier. Share it between yourselves and you should be able to last until the mountaintop,” Mi Li said. She couldn't really keep that information hidden when she saw how Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue could be completely swallowed up by this resentment.

Zu An was overjoyed. He was about to suggest that option to Yu Yanluo, but she had already thought of it as well. She directly pressed her lips against Yun Jianyue’s. Her tongue gently parted Yun Jianyue’s lips, and a bright pearl flew out, entering the other woman’s mouth.

As soon as Lord Sui’s Pearl entered her mouth, the black scales on Yun Jianyue’s face visibly retreated. Meanwhile, the few scales around Yu Yanluo’s wrist began to grow at a visible rate.

Yun Jianyue gradually woke up. She vaguely sensed someone kissing her, which left her shocked and furious. She was about to swing her arm, but when she saw who it was, she couldn't help but become stunned. When she sensed what was in her mouth and the endlessly refreshing sensation it brought, with her knowledge and experience, how could she not know what was going on?

Even with her usual domineering nature, she couldn't help but blush. It made her already beautiful face appear even more stunning.
