Chapter 1478: You Won’t Have a Chance Anymore

Off to one side, the previously grim-faced Golden Crow Crown Prince started feeling happy. As expected of my father!

He looked at Zu An with a smug expression, thinking, Little bastard, what are you going to do now? He even prayed inwardly, Hurry and refuse! That way, Zu An would have provoked his father, creating a proper excuse to kill him.

He didn’t know why he hated Zu An so much, though. After all, before he met Zu An, he had been the leader of the Fiend Races’ younger generation, and fully deserved his title as number one. Most importantly, it wasn’t his status that made it so; it was because he really was that talented. Whether in terms of his cultivation rank or his real combat strength, he was the best among the younger generation.

He was publicly known to be unrivaled among those at the same level. He would often challenge opponents at a higher level than himself, because he often stood a good chance of winning. That was why he had always been high-spirited and incredibly proud.

And yet, he had coincidentally ended up running into Zu An, and then been defeated by him, even though Zu An’s cultivation was lower than his! It had made him feel as if all of his past experiences were a joke.

At first, he hadn’t been willing to admit defeat. He had convinced himself that Zu An could only win through scheming. Even though their second meeting in the palace caused him to be severely wounded in an instant, he had still retained his confidence, because that was an ambush.

Eventually, however, after the events in the Imperial Tomb and the various encounters in the Unknown Region, he was shocked to discover that the person he had previously looked down on was someone he actually had to look up to. He didn’t even think there was any chance he could beat Zu An in the future either.

The worst part of it all was that Zu An’s cultivation was lower than his! That was the final nail in the coffin. As such, he really wanted his father to get involved and eliminate his personal demon.

Just then, Zu An said, “Fiend Emperor, I’ve already told you the information about the immortal medicine, and yet you’re still unsatisfied and covet my belongings. This isn’t how a good partner acts, is it?”

The Fiend Emperor said calmly, “Only a child would be picky about what they want. I have always taken everything.”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Zu An was speechless. If he didn’t know who the Fiend Emperor was, he would have thought he was talking to some damned perverted online friend from his previous world.

The Fiend Emperor looked at all those present and said, “Out of consideration for our cooperation, as long as you hand over what Yu the Great gave you, I can spare your lives. I hope you consider this carefully.”

Naturally, he didn’t actually plan to let Zu An off. He was only saying so to lower Zu An’s guard. At the same time, he was trying to drive a wedge in their group’s friendship. After all, the White Jade Sect Master, the Devil Sect Master, and even the Medusa Queen were formidable individuals in their own right. If they worked together, their power would be far more than the sum of its parts. Even though he wasn’t scared, considering how Zu An had obtained the recognition of the world, he still had to deal with the situation carefully.

After all, Yu the Great had given the benefits to Zu An alone. The three women hadn’t obtained anything. There was no reason for them to take a risk for him. If Zu An couldn't bear to hand it over, the women would definitely change their attitudes. Their relationship with Zu An would start to crack…

…At least, unless they were all passionately in love with him. If that were the case, they would only side with Zu An no matter what choice he made.

The Medusa Queen was one thing, but the White Jade Sect’s ice goddess and the Devil Sect’s slaughtering witch? Would those two ever like a man, and the same man, no less? What a joke!

Ast Zu An didn’t reply, the Fiend Emperor continued with a sneer, “What, are you unwilling to hand it over? Could it be that you want your companions to lose their lives because of your own selfishness?”

Zu An smiled and replied, “Why is the Fiend Emperor playing these games? There’s no harm in telling you this, though. What Yu the Great gave me is a skill, and it has nothing to do with immortality. Fiend Emperor, your cultivation is already extraordinary, and you’re one of the strongest in this world. Why would you care about this skill of mine?”

“A skill!” the Golden Crow Crown Prince exclaimed, breathing heavily. How could a skill Yu the Great had given out be mediocre? He thought, Even if my father doesn’t need it, I need it!

The Fiend Emperor frowned slightly. He couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed when he heard that it was a skill. In his current state, what he needed the most wasn’t some powerful secret manual. However, he didn’t trust what Zu An said about it being unrelated to immortality that easily. Whether or not it was related, he had to take a look at it himself first.

As for whether Zu An’s strength would skyrocket after learning Yu the Great’s skill… It would be strange if he could learn it that quickly. Even for the Fiend Emperor and Zhao Han, who were the greatest geniuses in the present world, it would have taken them at least several months to learn an extraordinary secret manual at Zu An’s level. Even at his current cultivation rank, the Fiend Emperor would need at least a few days to fully comprehend an extraordinary skill.

What level was Zu An at right now, though? He wouldn’t necessarily be able to make much progress even after a year.

The Fiend Emperor said indifferently, “My nature is rather greedy. For all these years, I have always wanted everything that is good. I will not treat you unfairly if you give me this skill of yours. Once we return to the outside world, you will have your share of high position and wealth.”

Zu An sneered. Offering him a high position and wealth like that? Could the Fiend Emperor be any more fake? He hadn’t even bothered going into the details, so it was easy to see that he didn’t have a shred of sincerity.

Of course, even if there had been sincerity, there was no way Zu An would hand the skill over. As such, he replied, “Please forgive me, but I have never been too interested in glory or wealth, so I can only let down your good intentions.”

The Golden Crow Crown Prince almost burst out laughing when he heard the reply. Very good, keep going, court death! The more the better!

The Fiend Emperor’s face darkened and he exclaimed, “Hmph, don’t blame me for not asking you nicely!”

If not for his reservations about the world’s favor toward Zu An, why would he have bothered talking for so long with someone whose cultivation was so far beneath his own?

Suddenly, however, the passage rippled. The aura of the world seemed to have turned chaotic.

Yun Jianyue said seriously, “This tunnel can’t hold on for much longer. If we keep stalling, all of us will be trapped in this world until we die.”

The Fiend Emperor frowned. He waved his hand toward the Golden Crow Crown Prince. A gentle force wrapped around the prince, sending him flying toward the passage. The Fiend Emperor said, “You should leave first.”

He was confident he could quickly deal with Zu An’s group, but he still had to search Spirit Mountain for the immortal medicine. It would be very bad if the passage closed before he could escape. The Fiend Races still needed someone to rule them, after all. As such, he had sent the crown prince out as a precaution.

Even though the Golden Crow Crown Prince wanted to personally witness that despicable person Zu An being crushed with his own eyes, if he really ended up locked inside the Unknown Region forever, it would be too late for regrets. He wasn’t like his father, who was close to passing away. He still had many years to enjoy. He actually had some darker thoughts; if he left and the passage closed, wouldn’t that make him the new Fiend Emperor?

Because the Fiend Emperor was blocking the passage entrance, Zu An’s group could only watch as the Golden Crow Crown Prince left.

The group’s atmosphere turned grave. Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue both felt pessimistic. They really didn’t know how to deal with the Fiend Emperor. He seemed to be injured from the fight against the Qiongqi, but he already seemed to have recovered. His aura was even more imposing than it had been at his previous peak, as if he had improved further.

At the moment, their only hope was Zu An’s Sun Slaying Bow, But they only had one chance. The Fiend Emperor wouldn’t necessarily give him a chance. Unless… Unless someone sacrificed themselves to stall the Fiend Emperor, buying Zu An a chance to use the bow.

As for the skill Yu the Greathad passed on, they believed that with Zu An’s aptitude, he would undoubtedly be able to learn it quickly; however, no matter how quickly he learned, there was no time left.

Yu Yanluo was calmer than the others. She was already very happy to be with Zu An. They would survive together or die together.

The Fiend Emperor said just then, “I will give you one last chance; otherwise, it will be too late for regret.”

Zu An sighed and replied, “Do you have that much confidence that you can really defeat me?”

The Fiend Emperor looked at him as if he were stupid, asking, “Are you telling a joke right now?”

Even Yan Xuehen and the other women looked at Zu An strangely. Isn’t this guy going a bit too far with his bluff?

“Then you can make your move. If I attack first, you won’t have a chance anymore,” the Fiend Emperor said. He was still the most powerful being in the world; he really couldn't bring himself to act first against a junior.

“You might end up regretting that,” Zu An said. As soon as he finished speaking, several waves of blue radiance suddenly appeared behind him. It was as if mirrors had appeared in the air. Weapons gradually appeared one after another, every single one giving off the aura of a heaven-grade weapon.
