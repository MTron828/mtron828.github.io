Chapter 1762: Price

“Huh?” Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun exclaimed in shock. “You’re Wang Port’s young master?”

“That’s right. This one is number two in my clan,” Wang Neishi said as he opened a fan and fanned himself a bit. There was something of an elegant look to his appearance.

“It’s an honor…” the two said with a deep sigh. They both offered up some flattery.

Then, Wang Neishi returned to the previous topic. “Why exactly did the two ladies want to look for my father? Why not tell me about it? Even though I am no genius, I have still learned some skills from my father. I might very well be of some help.”

Xie Daoyun replied, “We’re actually searching for our missing companions.”

“Oh, may I ask what the names of your companions are, and what kinds of distinctive traits they have?” Wang Neishi asked with a smile. Xie Daoyun then told him about Zu An and the others’ distinctive traits.

Wang Neishi’s eyes suddenly narrowed. However, he pretended not to care at all and said, “The lady and this Zu An must be really close. That must be why you’re going so far to find him.”

Before Xie Daoyun could reply, Yun Jianyue already interrupted, “Zu An is her adopted brother, and Qiu Honglei is her sister-in-law. Now that they are missing, we must naturally do everything we can to find them.”

Xie Daoyun was stunned for a moment. Her first thought was that Yun Jianyue was deliberately emphasizing Zu An’s relationship with Qiu Honglei to support her own disciple’s love. However, she quickly realized something. Judging from their interactions over the past few days, she knew Yun Jianyue wasn’t someone that narrow-minded. There was definitely a reason for her saying that.

When she saw Wang Neishi’s expression changing, judging from all of the beautiful women at his side, she quickly realized that he was a lustful pervert. He seemed to appreciate their looks, which was why he was offering to help so enthusiastically. If he believed they were looking for her man, why would he bother helping them at all anymore? At that point, perhaps he would even deliberately conceal any news of Zu An if he found any.

“That’s right. My adopted brother and sister-in-law have always treated me really well. Every day has been full of worries, since we don’t know if the two of them are in danger,” Xie Daoyun said, sobbing.

Yun Jianyue couldn't help but give her a second look. This girl was normally so graceful and refined, and yet her acting skills were actually pretty good!

Sure enough, when he heard what she said, Wang Neishi’s furrowed brows relaxed. Instead, he said comfortingly, “Miss Xie, worry not. Your esteemed brother and sister-in-law will be helped by the heavens.”

Xie Daoyun looked up at him with her large, misty eyes, asking, “Can the young master help us find them?”

“About that…” Wang Neishi said, chuckling awkwardly. The world was so large; how could finding a few people be that easy? If it were someone famous, that would be a bit easier, but he had never heard of those people before. Still, he said, “Worry not, my lady. I will send some people to help you look for information.”

“Is that so? I’ll have to thank the young master then…” Xie Daoyun said, looking a bit disappointed.

When he saw such beauty with that kind of expression, Wang Neishi naturally realized that he had made a mistake. He gritted his teeth and said, “How about this? Please follow me back to Wang Port. My father has a special rune talisman that can search for things. I can ask for his help.”

“Really?! Thank you so much, young master!” Xie Daoyun replied excitedly, looking at him with a starry-eyed gaze.

Off to the side, Yun Jianyue grinned. Look at this girl putting up this green tea b*tch act! 

…

As they began to chat with each other, the mood soon became lively. Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun indirectly inquired about Wang Port, while Wang Neishi also asked about the two girls’ past.

Time quickly passed. A servant quickly arrived and reported, “Second prince, we have already arrived home.”

Wang Neishi nodded, then said to the two women, “The two ladies should get some rest in my humble home first. As soon as the sky brightens tomorrow, I will refer you to my father.” He believed himself to be distinguished and elegant, so he wouldn’t immediately ask them rudely to stay with him.

“Thank you, young master,” Xie Daoyun and Yun Jianyue said, nodding slightly. 

Soon after, a maid came to bring the two into the guest room. Along the way, the two secretly asked around. Wang Port had been built with the mountains on one side and water on the other. Several rivers flowed through the village, so there were boats of varying sizes parked all around. They could tell that water was the main route of transport. In contrast, Wang Neishi’s flying boat was much rarer. It was clear that such a thing was extremely rare and precious even in the Wang clan. Even though it was nighttime, they could still tell just how grand and majestic the Wang clan’s structures were. Furthermore, rather than being the gathering place of a single clan, Wang Port was more like a great city.

When the servant saw the two women’s expressions, she felt a sense of pride. She said, “There aren’t many places in this entire world that can compare to our Wang clan!”

Yun Jianyue was a bit unhappy when she saw the disdain in the maid’s eyes. However, Xie Daoyun tugged on her hand, then looked at that maid with a smile and said, “Big sis, there were only ruined walls and rubble on our way here. Even if there was a town, it was in really bad shape. There were ghosts all around. Your port is so incredible; could it be that there really are no ghosts that haunt this place?”

“Which ghosts would dare?!” the maid cried, her voice immediately rising a few octaves. “Our master is the most senior elder of the Divine Firmament Sect. Do you know about the Divine Firmament Sect? They are the most skilled at driving ghosts away. Just how foolish would those ghosts have to be to come here and court destruction?

“Furthermore, the Wang clan has always produced geniuses. All the most famous forces throughout the world have our Wang clan’s people serving as officials. The ones who stay in the port are numerous and powerful too. Whether it is ghosts or people, none of them would dare provoke us.”

Xie Daoyun and Yun Jianyue exchanged a look. This Wang clan was even more formidable than the rumors claimed! Still, the more formidable the Wang clan was, the higher the chance would be that they could actually find Zu An and the others. 

The maid was in a good mood because she had been called ‘big sis’, so she added, “Also, let me warn the two of you. Our master is not as agreeable as the second young master. There is no way he will agree to help the two of you.”

“Why is that?” Yun Jianyue asked curiously. Wasn’t this maid a bit too sure of herself?

“That is because our clan master has to pay quite the price in order to use that talisman. There is no way he would use it without a good incentive. It was nothing more than something the young master said to… Ahem, the young master just forgot about that due to his admiration for the two ladies,” the maid said with a smile.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

When she saw the two’s flustered appearance, she then added, “But do not worry. Our clan master is an elder of the Divine Firmament Sect. The Divine Firmament Sect has disciples everywhere, and the Wang clansmen are also all over the world. We should be able to help the two of you by borrowing that intelligence network.”

Yun Jianyue and Xie Daoyun exchanged a look and both saw the worry in the other’s eyes. This world was a bit too treacherous. Staying a day longer meant encountering another share of danger. Furthermore, the Wang clan had nothing to do with the two of them. Even if they sent someone to investigate, they likely wouldn’t put in that much effort.

Yun Jianyue suddenly remembered what the maid had said earlier and asked, “In what kind of situation would the clan leader use that talisman?”

“I will not talk about the master using it for his own sake, but if it is for someone else, he seems to have only done so three times in the last hundred or so years. Each time, the other side had to pay a tremendous price in order to get him to agree,” the maid replied.

Yun Jianyue’s eyes lit up. She said, “Then that means a deal can be made!”

“Perhaps, but he is the master of the house, someone who has seen endless treasures. He will have no interest in ordinary items,” the maid said, looking at the two of them with suspicion. They were pretty, but how could they have anything that would move the master?

Yun Jianyue chuckled and didn’t bother explaining anything. As the sect master of the Devil Sect, she naturally had some treasures.

The two of them asked the maid a bit more about the Wang clan. At first, the maid was still guarded, but when Yun Jianyue took out a pretty gemstone, a smile quickly appeared on her face. Not only did she tell them information about the Wang clan, she even told them what kinds of things were offered by those three people who had succeeded.

…

The next morning, Wang Neishi excitedly ran over to invite the two women for breakfast. While they were eating, he told them that his father had already agreed to send some people to search for Zu An and the others, and that the two ladies could wait for good news at ease.

After the maid’s information from the previous day, the two women naturally knew that his father had refused to use that talisman. As for sending some people to look for Zu An and the others, those were nothing more than some pretty words. In the end, he just wanted them to stay here.

Xie Daoyun and Yun Jianyue had already discussed their plan the previous night. When they heard that, they said with a smile, “Thank you, young master! We came here from afar and have a gift to present to your esteemed father. We hope the young master can help us mediate a meeting.”

“A present?” Wang Neishi replied with a slight frown. But when he remembered that the two of them had come to see his father, he thought that it was likely because they had heard about the talisman. As such, he said in a somewhat troubled manner, “But my father is usually cultivating in seclusion. Many years ago, countless people came to request his help, but he was pestered beyond endurance, and gave the order that anyone who disturbed him but could not satisfy him would have to pay with their souls. From then on, he was not bothered so often anymore. Let me remind you two that in all these years, only three people have succeeded.”

He had gotten a bit too excited when he saw how beautiful these two were and made that promise as a result. He had thought that as a doted-on son, it wouldn’t be too hard to convince his father; and yet, his father had refused to help him at all, and still kept the same rules.

Xie Daoyun shivered. She hadn’t expected the Wang clan master to be so dangerous.

However, Yun Jianyue remained calm and said, “Do not worry, second young master. Our gift will definitely satisfy your father.”

The maid had purposely hidden that fact, likely out of ulterior motives. Is she really worried that we’ll fight for this young master’s favor? What a joke!

When Wang Neishi recalled the sight of the two fighting against the endless ghosts in the valley, he knew they weren’t ordinary people. Perhaps they would really have a gift that could move his father. Still, this matter was too dangerous. If they ended up offending his father… 

Xie Daoyun added with a lovely and pitiful expression, “Also, don’t we still have the second young master? If something really happens, the second young master will definitely protect us, right?”

When he saw her lovely and charming appearance, and how she even seemed to have a look of adoration for him, Wang Neishi immediately felt a sense of protectiveness well up inside him. He replied, “Of course!”

The price father has to pay for using that talisman is a bit high, so it makes sense that he wouldn’t agree to my request of helping them.

But with how much my father dotes on me, I should be able to protect these two women. At worst, I’ll just say I like them. There’s no way my old man will kill his daughters-in-law, right?

He was even starting to look forward to the women’s gifts disappointing his father. That way, he would have another chance to play the hero!
