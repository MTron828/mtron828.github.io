Chapter 376: An Embarrassing Misunderstanding

Translator: Pika

Zu An jumped up suddenly and ran outside.

Jiang Luofu was stunned. “What in the world are you doing?”

Zu An waved a hand to stop her from following. “Don’t come over here! I need to be alone right now!”

Zu An almost seemed to have gone crazy. Jiang Luofu wondered if she’d perhaps spoken a little too harshly earlier.

A twinge of remorse tugged at her heart.

Zu An ran into the courtyard and scooped out a bucket of water. He found a washbowl and washed his face ten times.

He offered up fervent and unceasing prayers to all the gods he knew. Finally, It was time to pull the lottery.

He had a total of 51,915 Rage points right now. That gave him 519 chances.

Suddenly, there was a flash of golden light from the Keyboard System:

The total number of Rage points accumulated has reached the required threshold. Award system upgraded! 100 draws of the lottery can now be combined together in one multi-draw. If you have over 100 chances, each draw will be a multi-draw, and you will receive all prizes instantly. If you have less than 100 chances, then each draw will still be a single draw.

Please note: The type of draw does not affect the overall drop rate.

...

Zu An read the notice carefully and managed to get a rough idea of what was going on. This upgrade only helped him save a little time. Playing the lottery one draw at a time was quite the hassle, especially when he had accumulated a large number of Rage points. The more points he collected, the more times he would have to draw. At some point, it might take forever!

This multi-draw function was a good thing as long as it didn’t affect the drop rate!

Nervously, he began to draw the lottery. With the first attempt, he discovered that his Rage points balance immediately dropped by 10,000 points.

A large chunk of information started scrolling up the screen. His eyelids twitched. There were way too many ‘Thanks for playing!’ messages for his liking.

He drew a total of nine Ki Fruits from this multi-draw. It seemed his luck wasn’t anything special this time around.

He pressed the key to draw again. Light flickered across the keyboard, and he was faced with another wall of scrolling text. This time, his haul was sixteen Ki Fruits. This was a much better rate than the first time.

However, he didn’t feel all that happy. These weren’t what he needed right now.

He pressed the key to draw again. Another 10,000 points vanished. He gained another twelve Ki Fruits.

Zu An began to panic. At his current level, every single formation of his needed a crazy amount of Ki Fruits to fill. A dozen more or a dozen fewer Ki Fruits made no difference.

He was trying to save someone! He needed to get that item!

He was just about to do his fourth multi-draw when a thought struck him. He ran off to wash his face again, and then concentrated on the draw.

This time, he got eleven Ki Fruits and a red bottle!

Hell yes!

Zu An screamed in excitement. Washing your face bloody works! I actually got it!

This red bottle was obviously ‘Faith in Brother Spring’!

This was the same as a recovery potion in a video game! No matter how bad your condition was, all you had to do was take one potion and you were good to go again!

He wasn’t in the mood to continue drawing. He ran straight back inside.

Ji Xiaoxi was currently examining Qin Wanru’s injuries. When she saw Zu An suddenly barge in, she hurriedly covered up Qin Wanru’s body with her clothes again. “Big brother Zu, why didn’t you announce that you were coming in first?” she complained.

He noticed that she’d addressed him in her usual manner. Clearly, she’d gotten over her grudge against him, and had forgiven him. He became even happier. “Hahaha! I’ve found a way to cure Madam Chu!”

“What?!” Ji Xiaoxi had only just managed to bring Qin Wanru back from the gates of hell, and it had been a supremely difficult feat. Strictly speaking, she hadn’t brought her all the way back. Qin Wanru was still lingering at the border to the afterlife.

How could Ji Xiaoxi not be shocked by Zu An’s sudden declaration that he had a way to save Qin Wanru?

Jiang Luofu was also mystified. She had been watching as Zu An ran around the courtyard, washing his face furiously. It seemed as though he had gone crazy. She never expected that he would suddenly run back in and declare that he’d found a solution. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Zu An couldn’t be bothered to explain. He ran over and supported Qin Wanru to a more upright position. Strangely, as he placed his hand on her back, it came into contact with something soft and warm. He was surprised. Apparently, Ji Xiaoxi hadn’t had time to dress her again properly after treating her.

“You...!” Ji Xiaoxi stomped her feet in anger. She was clearly annoyed.

Jiang Luofu also stared at him strangely. “Damned brat, are you doing this on purpose? Go outside and wait until we can dress her properly.”

Zu An shook his head. “No! There isn’t a second to waste.”

Qin Wanru’s life was hanging by a thread. If they failed to save her because they were just a little too late, the regret he would feel might be enough to kill him.

He took out the bottle of ‘Faith in Brother Spring’ and administered it to Qin Wanru.

Her complexion improved visibly as the liquid entered her body.

A while later, Qin Wanru slowly opened her eyes. Her heart was free of the piercing pain that she’d been feeling all this while. She was taken aback. “Am I dead?”

Zu An laughed out loud. “Of course not! I saved you!”

“You saved me?” Qin Wanru was momentarily stunned. Then, she remembered the treatment that he had described to her earlier. When she saw that her clothes were half-undone, rage and humiliation flared up within her. “You bastard!”

With a swing of her hand, she slapped him in the face.

*Pah!*

You have successfully trolled Qin Wanru for 1024 Rage points!

Zu An had been completely immersed in the joy of saving her. The last thing he’d expected was for her to suddenly strike him in the face! This sudden slap left him in a daze.

Ji Xiaoxi and Jiang Luofu were similarly stunned.

They had no idea why Qin Wanru would hit Zu An. Shouldn’t she be happy that she’d been saved?

Qin Wanru’s entire body was shaking. She pushed Zu An aside. “Your actions have let down Chuyan and Huanzhao. You’ve let down Zhong...”

Midway through her sentence, she suddenly noticed Jiang Luofu and Ji Xiaoxi beside her, stupefied expressions on their faces. She stopped talking at once.

Since the scandal had already happened, the first priority was to prevent news of it from spreading to others. That would help the Chu clan avoid any further shame.

Zu An was just about to explain himself when Jiang Luofu spoke up. “Madam Chu might still be a little muddle-headed from her injuries, considering how severe they were. She seems a little too agitated right now. It might be better if you waited outside.”

In a daze, Zu An allowed himself to be ushered outside. The cold wind blowing across the barren courtyard helped to bring him back to his senses.

What in the world did I do to deserve this?

He had done everything he could, and yet this was how he was repaid.

Ji Xiaoxi found a fresh set of clothes for Qin Wanru to change into. Jiang Luofu couldn’t contain her curiosity any further. “Madam Chu, Zu An saved your life just now. Why did you hit him?”

“I...” Qin Wanru’s face turned red. Her thoughts were all over the place. He did... that... to me! How can I just accept it meekly?

Her first instinct had been to kill him, but he had saved her, after all.

A deluge of thoughts flooded her mind, but none of them were coherent.

She had no idea how she was going to face Zu An again. Or Chuyan, or her husband...

Jiang Luofu and Ji Xiaoxi were right next to her, so they probably knew about what had happened as well.

Just end me already...

As her mind continued to roil with unease, Ji Xiaoxi suddenly said, “I wonder where big brother Zu found that miraculous bottle of medicine. It really can bring someone back from the dead.”

Qin Wanru stiffened. She turned and saw Ji Xiaoxi pick up a translucent crystalline bottle. Even Jiang Luofu moved closer to her to examine it.

Qin Wanru was in complete disbelief. “He... he used that to treat me?”

“How else could he have treated you?” Ji Xiaoxi’s eyes sparkled as she looked at her. She didn’t know why she would ask such an obvious question.

Qin Wanru stared back at her, speechless.

Ahhh! What an embarrassment!

More than an hour passed, and still Qin Wanru didn’t dare to raise her head to look at Zu An. What a terrible embarrassment! She’d actually suffered such a horrible misunderstanding!

Zu An also understood what had happened. This woman had probably made a wrong assumption earlier. He thanked his lucky stars. At least she didn’t kill me outright.

However, he was still surprised that Qin Wanru hadn’t completely recovered. He suspected that it was because her cultivation was at the sixth rank. That ‘Faith in Brother Spring’ had an ‘S’ tagged to it, which probably meant it was a small bottle. It seemed like this medicine couldn’t completely heal anyone above the fifth rank.

Even so, that bottle had been enough to bring Qin Wanru out of the danger zone. Ji Xiaoxi’s had enough medical skill to complete the remaining treatment.

Ji Xiaoxi gave her a final checkup and said, “I’ll prescribe you some medicine, Madam Chu. Please, get some rest. You should be able to make a full recovery in half a month.”

Qin Wanru shook her head. “I don’t have that much time. I need to return to the Chu Estate and suppress this rebellion."

In half a month, the dust would have already settled. By then, it would be too late.
