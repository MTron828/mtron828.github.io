Chapter 1470: Heaven Never Bars One’s Way

“Xiang Liu!” Zu An and the others exclaimed, instantly recognizing the new arrival. Xiang Liu looked extremely delicate, but he was actually much stronger than the tough-looking Fuyou.

Xiang Liu’s gaze swept over them in surprise. He supported Fuyou while remarking, “Hey, how can you be so careless?”

“There’s something strange about that brat!” Fuyou spat. His entire body was covered in all sorts of injuries, and he seemed somewhat weakened. He shot Zu An a glare, although there was a hint of fear in his eyes. Just then, he really had tasted death.

Xiang Liu looked at Zu An curiously, saying, “So little brother was actually so formidable. I really made an error in judgment earlier.”

Zu An said, “Your majesty’s bearing also leaves me in admiration. As we carry mutual respect, how about we just stop things here?”

Seeing as I’ve been holding up both of Gonggong’s subordinates here for so long, the Fiend Emperor should be alone with him. Together with the Golden Crow Crown Prince to help him, they should be able to deal with that guy, right?

When Xiang Liu returns and sees that something has happened to his master, he’ll definitely be furious. He’ll definitely go all out against the Fiend Emperor to get revenge after, and the result will be one dead, one injured.

Then, if we show up at the very end, won’t we have the last laugh?

Sigh, I really am a genius!

“You seem to look quite confident,” Xiang Liu said in surprise. “Did you think that by stalling me, the Fiend Emperor would act against our master?”

Zu An shivered inwardly. He carefully controlled his expression, thinking, Is this guy a freaking mind reader? At the same time, he asked probingly, “Are you not worried at all?”

Xiang Liu chuckled. “Why would I be worried? On the contrary, you should be more concerned about that companion of yours.”

Even though he knew that the two sides looked united, but were actually divided at heart, the two had still formed an alliance previously.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zu An instantly felt discouraged. Was Gonggong really already so strong that the Fiend Emperor couldn't win, even when Gonggong hadn’t made a complete recovery yet?

Xiang Liu slowly walked over, saying, “The dragon energy summoning skill you used just now was quite interesting. Unfortunately, a large portion of the dragon energy has been used on Fuyou, so it will not be able to deal with me.”

After all, Fuyou was also at the earth immortal rank. Seriously injuring him would require a huge amount of power. Meanwhile, the dragon energy wasn’t endless. It was already much weaker  than before, and it would take some time to recover.

Xiang Liu didn’t give Zu An any time to react. As soon as he finished speaking, two streaks of divine radiance, one black and one green, shot at Zu An.

Fortunately, after Zu An had arrived in this world, he had always been wandering along the edge of life and death. His strength wasn’t necessarily the greatest, but his fighting experience was definitely top-tier. Even though Xiang Liu had still sounded kind on the surface, Zu An had remained alert.

He swiftly used ‘Descending Dragon Eighteen Palms’, summing the dragon energy to rush at the two incoming divine radiances. A huge explosion ensued.

Xiang Liu staggered, while Zu An flew backward and slammed into a wall, his body buried in a pile of rubble. Zu An’s cultivation was still very far from that of an earth immortal. The fact that he could almost end Fuyou’s life through the dragon energy was already something to be proud of.

However, it was precisely because of that battle that too much of the dragon energy had been used up. Furthermore, Xiang Liu was even more powerful than Fuyou.

Xiang Liu clicked his tongue in wonder, saying, “You were actually able to react in that instant even with your cultivation rank. That level of combat and reactive strength is difficult to find throughout the entire world.” Apart from that, what left him even more surprised was that his attacks were poisonous, but Zu An didn’t seem to be affected at all.

Zu An crawled out of the pile of rubble and spat out a mouthful of sand. Sometimes, being praised by an enemy wasn’t something to be happy about.

Because Xiang Liu had just attacked without warning while speaking, Yan Xuehen was worried that Zu An would end up in trouble again, and that Xiang Liu would hurt him. As such, she harrumphed and thrust her Flying Snow Sword at Xiang Liu.

“Your sword technique is not bad, but unfortunately, your cultivation is lacking,” Xiang Liu commented while deflecting the sword with a single finger, neutralizing its sharp strikes one after another.

The recoil that traveled back to Yan Xuehen through the sword made her internal energies stir, and caused her sword strikes to slow down.

Then, Xiang Liu seized an opportunity to catch her sword between his fingers. A wave of black and green energy rushed along the sword, forcing back the cold energy on its surface and reaching the hilt almost instantly.

Yan Xuehen naturally knew the attack was poisonous. She wanted to let go of her sword, but a strange suction force latched on to her and prevented her from escaping.

Fortunately, just then, Yun Jianyue took out the Empress Lantern, briefly interrupting Xiang Liu. She then took the chance to move close to Yan Xuehen, grabbing her and pulling her back.

“Thank you!” Yan Xuehen exclaimed. In the past, she would have cursed her nemesis and asked why Yun Jianyue would save her. However, after everything they had gone through, she was already used to it.

Before Yun Jianyue had a chance to reply, her expression suddenly changed, as Xiang Liu recovered. He opened his mouth and fired a streak of black energy that flew toward the Empress Lantern. The brightly shining Empress Lantern instantly grew dim as if it had been blown out, falling out of the air.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were both stunned. They had both lost their connection to their respective treasures at the same time. Xiang Liu seemed to be able to corrode the ki around magic weapons.

Xiang Liu raised his hand. The two women suddenly felt the presence of danger. Unfortunately, their internal energies were disrupted and they couldn't evade.

Fortunately, Yu Yanluo rushed forward. She used the Dragonsnake’s Nine Transformations to activate the power of the Holy Pearl. A deep yellow light appeared in her eyes.

“Nuwa’s power?” Xiang Liu exclaimed in surprise. A layer of petrification quickly appeared on the surface of his body.

Just as quickly, however, green and black energies moved around his body, undoing the petrification wherever they passed. He couldn't help but say with a sigh, “If we were at the same cultivation rank, I would not have been your match.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he instantly appeared next to Yu Yanluo. He didn’t want to give her another chance to use the Medusa’s Eye.

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue were grandmasters, however. They had already recovered in the short time Yu Yanluo bought for them. They quickly worked together to ward off Xiang Liu. However, the two both thought nervously, Why isn’t Ah Zu coming to help us yet? We can’t hold on for much longer!

Zu An had wanted to help out earlier, but as soon as he got up, he had been stunned once again. He had turned around to see that there was a room beyond the crushed wall behind him. Inside, there was something that resembled an altar. More importantly, there was a groove in the altar that looked somewhat familiar.

He was startled. The group had struggled against Gonggong’s subordinates alone; what of the even more frightening Gonggong?

There’s no way to succeed in this type of situation at all!

But this doesn’t make sense.

Something as terrifying as Gonggong definitely has something that can counter him.

What about those golden whips from before?

No, that was just the power Emperor Yao left.

According to what Gonggong said, several other things were arranged by Yu the Great. Then…

He took out the pocket-sized Nine Cauldron and placed it into the altar’s groove. The ninth Nine Cauldron sank into it, releasing a translucent divine light. The entire altar shone.
