Chapter 682: Trap

Translator: Pika

Zu An immediately became a bit upset. He took a step and blocked in front of the carriage. “I just saved you guys, hello? Even if you’re not deeply grateful, would it hurt you to say thanks?”

The woman in the carriage didn’t say anything else. She clearly wasn’t willing to speak with an outsider man.

The old driver smirked and said coldly, “Who knows how many crazy people have tried to approach our madam because of all types of reasons. There were quite a few who used some cheap tricks to look like a hero.”

He revealed his mouthful of yellow teeth. One of his front teeth was missing, so his smile was rather striking.

Zu An was stunned. Soon afterwards, he realized that the other party had misunderstood.

Doesn’t the girl inside have too big of an ego? Just how beautiful do you have to be for people to do something like that to her?

Their carriage looks ordinary, so I don’t think their clan has much money. Though there is a saying that beauties come from peasants…

But he quickly shook his head and refuted this thought. Those who were truly beautiful were probably long seized into the chambers of bigwigs. Why would they live like this?

This was a world of cultivation ruled by the fist. He refused to believe that those experts would leave a stunning peasant beauty alone.

Right now, his mood was terrible because of Qiu Honglei and Yun Jianyue’s departures, so he didn’t feel like arguing with them. He waved his hand impatiently and said, “Whatever, forget it. My good intention was instead treated like horse sh*t. Just get out of here.”

The driver chuckled a few times. He had already experienced his fair share of these types of events. This person’s reaction was similar to some of the others when they were exposed. Seeing that the madam inside didn’t have any other orders, he swung the reigns to leave.

Suddenly, there was a loud voice that sounded. “Halt!”

The driver’s brows were raised. He thought to himself that he underestimated this brat. Looks like he had other plans! He stopped the reins to see what other tricks he wanted to play.

But when he turned around, he only saw dust flying everywhere. A group of horsemen rushed over. The one in the front stopped in front of Zu An and took a look. He was horrified and turned around to report, “General, Black Ice has been seriously injured! It might not survive!”

“What?” A young man urged his horse forward.

The surrounding individuals’ eyes lit up. This really was a handsome and outstanding young master.

Some nearby girls covered their mouths and whispered among themselves when they saw his lavish golden embroidered robe, his golden band adorned with decorations of dragons and phoenixes, his finely combed long hair, and his sharp eyes. Judging from their starstruck expressions, their husbandos list definitely just added a new entry.

The driver with the missing tooth was shocked. He quickly said to the one inside the carriage, “Madam, I fear that we might have misunderstood this time. The one who has arrived is King Qi’s heir. He seems to be targeting that fella.”

The woman inside gently voiced her acknowledgement. Then, she didn’t say anything.

Zu An frowned. He glanced at the startled horse next to him. This horse’s body was jet-black, while one of its hooves was white like snow. No wonder it was named Black Ice.

But right now, it didn’t look as powerful as before, and was instead foaming at the mouth. Its eyes were bloodshot, and its body was swaying from side to side.

Zu An subconsciously loosened his grip. That horse could no longer stand still and crashed to the ground, its entire body twitching. It was obvious that it wouldn’t survive.

“What is going on? I didn’t use much strength when I was holding it, but it shouldn’t be enough to take its life right?” Zu An was confused.

“Hmph! So many people witnessed you killing Black Ice, yet you dare quibble like this?” That young noble was always glowering at him from atop that horse. He didn’t say anything, and it was instead the knight beside him that spoke.

Zu An began to get angry when he heard his attitude. “Your horse was injuring people in the middle of the street, yet you’re making bogus accusations here? Is there even a law left in this country?”

For better or for worse, he was a serious court official, so he obviously needed to use the law here, let alone the fact that he was on the right side of it.

The young master on the horse finally spoke up. “There are injured people? May I ask where they are?”

“The speeding horse rammed into many people’s booths. There’s probably many people who were injured!” Zu An pointed at the messy street.

“Is that so?” The young noble said with a loud voice. “Which one of you has suffered because of our horse earlier? Please come out so I can compensate you.”

He said this three times in succession. There was no response.

He then slowly turned back towards Zu An, an amused smile resting on his lips. “You’ve seen for yourself that no one was injured by my horse. It was you who killed this young master’s horse instead. This is definitive proof. Do you have anything else to say?”

Zu An immediately realized what was happening. These common people were scared of bringing trouble upon themselves. This young master was definitely not someone they should offend. The followers at his side were all glaring at everyone, so they were scared of retaliating and didn’t dare to say anything.

He didn’t blame these people. That was how human nature worked.

He pointed at the carriage nearby. “Apart from those on the street, the speeding horse charged at them too. If I didn’t stop it, their carriage would’ve been completely destroyed and their people would’ve died.”

The young noble gave that carriage a look. This carriage was quite shabby in appearance and didn’t look like it belonged to any rich household. He became even more relaxed and looked at that carriage in a haughty manner. “Was that true?”

The threatening expression in his eyes was clear.

Zu An frowned. This guy was clearly using his status to pressure them. Wow, I actually ended up getting caught in a deliberate car crash scam today.

He thought that the carriage driver would look after his own hide just like the others, but he instead cracked open a grin and said, “That is correct. That crazy horse was charging straight at us and almost frightened our madam.”

He didn’t admit to Zu An’s claim that the carriage and the people inside would’ve perished. However, no one else here noticed this.

The young noble gave him a look, and then he shifted his gaze, as if giving this ugly man even another look was disgraceful. “But aren’t you guys fine? Who knows if you all are in on this together?”

The driver with the missing tooth chuckled, but he didn’t say anything else.

Now that Zu An knew that these people were here to start trouble, Zu An instead calmed down. So these were the so-called influential bigwigs of this world, huh? They’re quite good at twisting the truth. Unfortunately, none of you can compete with me in terms of shamelessness.

That young noble then looked at Zu An and said coldly, “Black Ice is a military horse. It has brought back great achievements on the battlefield and has a permanent post in the Ministry of War. Do you know what kind of crime killing a military horse is?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Zu An said indifferently. “Nope.”

I really want to see just what kind of show you’ll bring me. I’m someone who has chatted with the emperor, King Qi, and Yun Jianyue, these types of people.

This scene didn’t make him panic even in the slightest, let alone pressure him into using force.

The horseman next to him immediately continued, “Killing a military horse is a huge crime! You will be banished at the very least. If it is a military horse that has an army rank, then your crimes will be even worse, becoming a capital offense.”

Zu An laughed. He looked at that extravagantly dressed young master. “You want my life all because of a deranged horse that tore up this entire street? Y’all are quite the vicious bastards.”

That young noble’s expression grew cold. When had anyone dared to speak like this to him ever since he was young?

You have successfully trolled Zhao Zhi for +444 Rage points!

Zu An’s eyes narrowed. So this kid’s surname is Zhao, huh? Anyone with the surname Zhao had a high chance of being part of the royal family.

The horsemen on the side immediately berated one after the next, “Outrageous! You dare speak so rudely to our general?”

“General? Then do you all know who I am?” Zu An walked with his hands behind his back. After refining the auras of an Earth Immortal and a Grandmaster, he was stronger than he had ever been. He naturally gave off a sense of confidence.

“Hm?” The driver with the missing tooth was surprised.

“What is it, Uncle Fu?” The pleasing voice of the madam inside sounded.

The driver chuckled and said, “Madam, this kid seems to have some guts.”
