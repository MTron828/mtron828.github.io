Chapter 676: Confiscating the Tool of Crime

Translator: Pika

Zu An’s expression suddenly became strange. “Big sis sect master, are you after my body?”

Yun Jianyue was furious. “What are you saying?!”

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +444 +444 +444…

Zu An mumbled, “Then why would you make me take off my pants too? Those are a man’s private parts, you know?”

Yun Jianyue took a deep breath and endured the urge to beat him up. “Didn’t I just explain it to you? The emperor’s cultivation is incredibly powerful, so how can it be that easy to get rid of his seal? I need to do everything I can. During this process, the two types of ki will clash, making your ki surge powerfully. If we do not immediately release the heat, then your meridians will suffer irreversible burns. Your body might even explode and die!”

Anyone else who dared make this type of joke with her would have been executed on the spot, yet this fella provoked her several times! Even though she was furious, she didn’t do anything. Even she surprised herself. In the end, she could only explain it through the fact that the Holy Sect owed him a lot.

Zu An replied with an ‘oh’. “It’s that Sex and Zen stuff, right? I got it.”

Yun Jianyue’s brows furrowed. “Sex and Zen?”

Even though she was knowledgeable, she never heard of this type of technique before.

“It’s nothing.” Zu An barely got by and began to take off his clothes. His healthy and fit chest was exposed.

Yun Jianyue’s eyebrows raised upwards. “Huh, I didn’t expect a kid like you to be that fit. I couldn’t tell with your clothes on.”

Zu An’s body was far stronger than an ordinary person’s after experiencing the Primordial Origin Sutra’s refinement. His body was much tougher than those of high level cultivators.

What was even more remarkable was that this type of refinement used the primordial ki of heaven and earth to temper his body. All of the essence was stored inside. His muscles weren’t bulky and sinister like those martial idiots’, but instead looked slim and soft. His skin was glowing and gave off a type of harmonious sense of aesthetic, yet also looked like it carried explosive power.

Even Yun Jianyue couldn’t help but give him a few more glances. The pursuit of beauty was the innate tendency of all humans.

“Did you say that on purpose to lessen your own embarrassment?” Zu An mocked. “If you keep staring, I’m going to start charging you.”

“Me, stare at you?” Yun Jianyue immediately seemed like a cat who had its tail stepped on. “I was just observing the seal in your body!”

It’s a freaking miracle that this kid was able to live for this long with that filthy mouth of his!

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +567 +567 +567…

Zu An thought to himself, you don’t even have x-ray vision, how can you just see inside my body? Of course, he wouldn’t expose her. “Alright, it’s my misunderstanding. But I’m about to take off my pants, so can you turn around first?”

He didn’t really mind, but he was worried that the other party might just chop off his thing with her sword out of embarrassment. That would really be bad.

Yun Jianyue harrumphed, as if she finally felt like she had a moment to let off some steam. “Brat, you’re still acting all embarrassed? Not many in this world dare stand before me, what do you think I haven’t seen before?” Even though this was what she said, she still turned around.

Zu An cursed inside. Stupid old unmarried woman, it’ll be more stange if you have seen it before.

Yun Jianyue’s chest rose and fell after turning around. She was definitely not as calm as she made herself sound on the surface.

She could hear rustling sounds behind her. A while later, Zu An said, “I’m done.”

Yun Jianyue took a deep breath and told herself to not be alarmed when she turned back around. I am the Holy Sect’s sect master! What kind of trials and tribulations haven’t I faced before? How can I act cowardly in front of a kid like this?

“Hmph! It’s not like I haven’t seen it before!”

Zu An actually did underestimate her. In her earlier years, she had met some filthy men who lusted after innocent wives. She interfered herself to punish them and would often remove their tool of crime. She wasn’t one of those young girls who never saw anything before.

But even though she already mentally prepared herself, she was still a bit absentminded when she turned back around.

Is… is there something wrong with this world?

After chopping off those criminals’ things in the past, she still had some understanding of their length. But why was this guy in front of her different from those people?

After a bit of hesitation, she couldn’t help but ask, “Did… did you end up getting poisoned somewhere? Is that why it’s so swollen?”

Her voice couldn’t help but soften up a bit.

Zu An was stunned. Then, he realized that she had misunderstood, so he could only explain, “There’s no poison, this is just how it normally is. Maybe I am… just too blessed?”

He felt different saying this for some reason.

Yun Jianyue had lived for a long time after all. She quickly realized that she had misunderstood. Her charming face immediately became entirely red. She wanted to find a hole to hide herself in out of embarrassment.

She coughed to dissolve the embarrassment. “Go sit on the bed. I need to help you undo your seal… Um, also, remember to have your back towards me.”

Zu An sighed in relief as well. To be honest, being looked at like this was a lot of pressure for him too.

When he sensed that she was sitting behind him to treat him, Zu An was stunned. “You’re not taking off your clothes?”

“Why would I take off my clothes?” Yun Jianyue was stunned, and then she was furious. “What kind of nonsense are you thinking?!”

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +996 +996 +996…

“Nothing! I was just worried that your ki will surge as well. If we cannot get rid of it in time, then it’ll be dangerous!” Zu An quickly explained. Meanwhile inside, he was full of regret. Didn’t Xiaolongnu and Yang Guo both strip when they cultivated?[1]

Yun Jianyue said coldly, “Stop thinking random stupid thoughts! Move your ki through your dantian and relax your body. Do not reject my ki at all.”

“Okay…” Zu An chuckled in embarrassment. He sat properly on the bed.

Yun Jianyue reached out her fair hand and pressed it against his back, her expression serious. She did her best to remove all unnecessary thoughts. While undoing the seal of the most powerful cultivator in the world, she couldn’t be distracted in the slightest.

Zu An’s suspicions weren’t entirely wrong. Once the heat was released, there would indeed be some danger for her. However, how could she remove her clothes in front of another man? She figured that she should be able to deal with it with her grandmaster level cultivation. That was why she sent her ki into his body.

Zu An felt a powerful wave of ki enter his body. It was different from the scorching heat of the emperor, this ki was like the cool moonlight of the night. It unknowingly made one relax.

Unfortunately, this peace didn’t continue for a long time. The seal the emperor left in his body immediately roared out like a dragon when it sensed that this aura was trying to undo it. It retaliated viciously.

Yun Jianyue did her best to contend against this power with a soft and firm force. The two powers tangled about each other. One moment, Zu An felt like he was being broiled, and then the next, he felt as if he was covered in ice.

Waves of white steam rose from his body. He felt as if he was in a steamer basket. He finally knew why she said that he had to take off his clothes. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Even Zu An’s powerful body was suffering bitterly under the clash of these two powers. However, he had already experienced the brink of death several times. Compared to then, this wasn’t much at all.

A hint of surprise flashed past Yun Jianyue’s eyes. She actually knew just how much pain using brute force to undo the emperor’s seal was. She didn’t say it on purpose before because he always teased her. She wanted to teach him a lesson with this, yet the other party actually endured it, not even releasing a single groan.

She was quite impressed. Even though this man acted rather frivolously, he was a man of steel deep down.

Her voice became gentler as well. “Hold on a bit longer. The emperor’s seal is already starting to loosen up.”

She reached out her hand and patted on the other party’s shoulder, and then he spun in place. She used this chance to strike his front and back acupoints with the stellar force she cultivated.

How powerful was the most powerful cultivator? Another grandmaster might not have been able to neutralize it.

However, the stellar force she cultivated touched upon the laws of time and space. She could even slow down and even temporarily suspend time to a certain extent.

She used the stellar force to temporarily sever the connection between the emperor’s seal and Zu An’s body. Then, she used the chance to slowly destroy this seal.

Of course, if the emperor was here himself, her stellar force wouldn’t do much against him. However, she had confidence in dealing with some leftover power.

A while later, Yun Jianyue finally destroyed most of that terrifying seal. She sighed in relief. Suddenly, she noticed that something was pressing against her. When she lowered her head, she was first momentarily stunned. Then, her cheeks flushed red in rage. “Little bastard, you’re courting death!”
