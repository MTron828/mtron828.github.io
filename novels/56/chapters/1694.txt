Chapter 1643: I Gave You an Opportunity But You Didn’t Cherish it

Freeloader skill description: They can be found everywhere in reality, games, and novels. Their best skill, freeloading, allows them to purchase or exchange for items even without money or other valuable goods. For the sake of freeloading, freeloaders do not fear any trouble. This kind of bravery is something worth learning from for all of us. However, their poor traits of being cheap and stingy has harmed the interests of the creators of value, thus drawing the disdain and contempt of others.

A certain well-known freeloader was once quoted: If I don’t pay once I’m done, it’s not prostitution, right?

Another freeloader often asserted: Freeloading brings happiness. If you freeload once, you feel great once. If you always freeload, you always feel great.

Skill effect: Once Freeloader is used, the negative cost of using any skill can be ignored. Uses left: 3.

Special reminder! There is a limit to freeloading. If the cost exceeds a certain amount, the freeloader will be bitterly punished.

Zu An was completely baffled when he finished reading the skill’s effects. There had been so many freeloaders online in his previous world, and the novels he followed had often begged their readers to not freeload anymore. He hadn’t expected to find the same concept even in this world.

Still, even though the skill’s effects were rather simple, the shorter the wording was, the greater the consequences would be.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This skill was actually a bit ridiculous. After all, many skills in this world followed the principle of equivalent exchange. The greater its strength was, the greater the cost would be. But Freeloader could completely ignore that cost. The only thing that was worth noting was that the skill didn’t seem to be omnipotent. It seemed that not even Freeloader could handle the cost if it was too great. For example, if he wanted to destroy the entire world, even if he used the Freeloader skill, he would be instantly reduced to ashes from the rebound.

He wondered where the limit of the skill was. However, it had a limit on its uses, so he couldn't just recklessly test it. Meanwhile, he could just die if he used it in a real battle…

He quickly finished his pulls. Apart from the Fortune Pill and Freeloader skill, he also obtained 720 Ki Fruits, leaving him quite satisfied with the result.

Next, he summoned Mo Xi. Her tanned skin shone with an enchanting glow, and she herself was like a beautiful leopardess. Her well proportioned thighs were full of explosive youthfulness. Even though this wasn’t the first time Zu An had seen them, he still sighed in amazement. Mo Xi was the complete opposite of Daji. Daji was delicate and soft, a beauty that could bring down an entire country. Meanwhile, Mo Xi was more like a heroic general.

Yup, her tanned skin coupled with her outfit makes her look more like those hot babes at the beach.

Compared to Daji, Mo Xi was more proud. Previously, she had never fully obeyed Zu An’s orders, and only barely accepted when he brought out Ki Fruits. As such, Zu An used the Ki Fruits to make her do what he needed her to do, unlike in Daji’s case, where he just gave them to her without any conditions.

However, Zu An had already thought things through by now. Even though the goddesses lacked souls, they still had things such as impression and favor. If he treated her exploitatively, she would probably treat him the same way. When she reached higher and higher levels, she would be even harder to control. Instead of that, it would be better for him to try to create a good relationship now, treating it like a dating sim.

“Open your mouth~” Zu An said as he took out the Ki Fruits. Together with what had been left over from before, he had 1,634 in total. As Daji had already made her seventh rank breakthrough, her Ki Fruit requirements had grown higher; so, rather than feeding her, he planned to raise Mo Xi’s rank first.

When she saw the Ki Fruits, Mo Xi’s previously cold eyes clearly lit up. After a moment of hesitation, she moved closer, then obediently raised her head and opened her mouth.

Zu An almost had a nosebleed when he saw this. These goddesses had all been exceptional beauties in life. Even though they were lacking souls, even their instinctive actions were just too beautiful.

Then, Zu An tossed the Ki Fruits into Mo Xi’s mouth one after another. Valkyries normally wouldn’t allow him to touch their bodies. However, in the process, he accidentally touched her soft lips, and at times he even touched her tongue. However, she didn’t show any signs of a negative reaction.

Zu An finally understood why so many people online felt that feeding carried a kind of joy. At first, he had planned to just dump the fruits all at once to save time and energy. But now, he changed his plans and fed them to Mo Xi one by one. He found it quite amusing in its own way.

…

Zu AN fed Mo Xi a total of 1,210 Ki Fruits, raising her up to the peak of the fifth rank. He didn’t feed her the remaining 424, because they weren’t enough to bring her to the peak of the sixth rank. It was better to just save them for emergencies.

Mo Xi seemed as if she still hadn’t fully expressed herself. The Ki Fruits were just too delicious for valkyries. She couldn't hold herself back and even licked his finger.

In that instant, every single hair on Zu An’s body stood on end. He thought to himself, She licks my fingers if I hold the fruits, but what if the fruits were placed elsewhere… He immediately got rid of those thoughts as soon as they appeared. Scum, brute, shameless!

When Mo Xi confirmed that there were no more Ki Fruits, she got up and waited for her mission. After all, that was what they always did. She got paid for what he needed her to do.

As if sensing her intentions, Zu An shook his head and said, “There’s nothing I need you to do. You can just rest.”

Mo Xi was stunned, clearly surprised that he didn’t need her to do anything. Her expression seemed to become a bit gentler. Then, she returned to her special space.

…

The next morning, Xie Daoyun saw that Zu An seemed to be constantly massaging his hands. She couldn't help but ask out of concern, “Big brother Zu, is your hand injured?”

“It’s fine. It’s just a small thing,” Zu An replied. Inwardly, he thought, I fed Mo Xi a total of 1,210 Ki Fruits one by one! How could my hand not be sore?

Xie Daoyun took out a talisman and stuck it to his hand, saying, “This is a Pain Relief Talisman. It can alleviate fatigue and pain.”

Zu An felt a refreshing sensation coming from his hand. He immediately showered her in praise. Even though Xie Daoyun’s fighting strength wasn’t that high, she really was a top-notch support unit! Her talismans were extremely practical! She seemed to be able to do anything.

When she heard his praise, Xie Daoyun felt really sweet inside. Her eyes looked like crescent moons as she smiled.

“Little sister Ling’er, why don’t we watch the representative disciples’ matches together? I’m sure it’ll be quite interesting,” Zu An said.

Xie Daoyun was a bit moved, but she still shook her head in the end and replied, “I have to check Violet Mountain for formations. People are all focused on Golden Peak because of the competition, so the security is a bit more lax elsewhere. It won’t be as easy to find another chance as good as this.”

Previously, they had only checked the main peaks. However, Violet Mountain was extremely vast. She had always had a feeling of unease, so she decided that it was better to continue investigating.

“I understand. Your mission is important,” Zu An replied. He knew that she had a mission and didn’t force her. However, he handed her an alert arrow from the Embroidery House and said, “Activate this if you encounter any danger. I’ll come immediately.”

“Okay. Thank you, big brother Zu,” Xie Daoyun replied, feeling really warm inside as she held the alert arrow. Inwardly, she thought, Big brother Zu really treats me well.

…

When Zu An arrived at Golden Peak, he reflexively looked for Chu Chuyan. After all, he felt really guilty after what had happened the previous night. Unfortunately, he didn’t see her. Normally, though, she would come to observe a competition between the representative disciples. Could it be that she was really angry this time?

He turned around to look at Pei Mianman. Pei Mianman clearly saw him, but she pretended not to. Furthermore, her usual charming smile was nowhere to be seen.

“What did they say to each other yesterday?” Zu An muttered to himself, feeling uncomfortable. He wanted to ask her, but he couldn't do so in front of everyone else right now.

Hm? What is going on with Elder Huo Ling and Wan Tongtian? Why do both of them look as if they’re spitting with rage?

I gave you two a chance, but you didn’t make use of it! Zu An thought mockingly.

Just then, Wang Wuxie finished the conventional opening remarks and speech. He formally announced the beginning of the day's competition.

Because today was the day of the battle between the representative disciples to see who was the best, there weren’t too many competitors. There was no need to have several fights at the same time, unlike the matches a few days prior. Instead, the battles would be held one by one for the disciples of the nine sects to view. After all, it would be a rare opportunity for them.

The first match was between the Righteous Sun Sect’s Wu Xiaofan and Mount Luofu’s Luo Dongjiang. When both of them got on the stage, the entire peak fell silent as the spectators watched the two.

Wu Xiaofan looked completely ordinary. No one would give him a second look if they saw him on the streets. In contrast, Luo Dongjiang was much more handsome and impressive in appearance. He had a lofty presence, worthy of his reputation as a representative disciple.

However, no one on Golden Peak dared to look down on Wu Xiaofan. After all, they had heard just too many legends surrounding him. Many of them began to quietly discuss who would win. The overwhelming majority thought that Wu Xiaofan was going to take the win, but some people supported Luo Dongjiang. After all, Luo Dongjiang had been completely unstoppable in the group stage. Furthermore, everyone liked a good underdog story.

“Luo Dongjiang isn’t weak. This is a good chance to see what Wu Xiaofan’s trump card is,” Jadefall Palace’s Wan Guiyi remarked expectantly. At the same time, he couldn't help but give his father a look. Normally, his father would be discussing strategies with him, as well as giving him some pointers.”

What is going on today? Why isn’t he saying anything?

He’s even avoided my gaze several times. It makes him look as if he did something to let me down…
