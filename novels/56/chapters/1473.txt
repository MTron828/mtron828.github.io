Chapter 1422: Seduction

Fortunately, none of them were inexperienced fighters. They quickly evaded using their respective movement skills. There was no need for them to even signal to each other, and they immediately counterattacked at the same time. 

Yu Yanluo didn’t use her World Painting. The boar was too strong; with her current cultivation, the painting wouldn’t be able to trap it. Instead, she supported the others with runes while using her Medusa’s Eye.

A layer of earthen yellow light surrounded the surface of the Fengxi Boar’s body, but it actually wasn’t affected that much by the petrification skill.

Yu Yanluo quickly warned the others, “Be careful. It’s of the earth element. Its defense is extremely powerful.”

Normally, even if one was the earth element and had some resistance against the Medusa’s  Eye, it wouldn’t be able to nullify the effects to such an extent. However, the thick mixture of grease and earth covering the surface of the Fengxi Boar’s body blocked the Medusa’s Eye to some degree.

Zu An instantly dashed over to the Fengxi Boar’s side at lightning-fast speed, stabbing his two swords straight into its body.

However, his eyes quickly narrowed. Even the two heaven-grade weapons, the Yin Yang Swords, actually couldn't pierce it even with the support of the Fire Phoenix and Blue Mallard’s power. The sword tips felt as if they had stabbed into a hard mountain. The swords bent under the tremendous force, releasing a groan and seeming as if they could break at any time.

The Fengxi Boar turned around and tried to chomp down on Zu An. It looked clumsy, but it was actually strangely fast. Fortunately, Zu An had held back a bit after Yu Yanluo’s reminder, so he used the sword’s rebound force to quickly dart backward by a dozen or so meters into a tree. However, the boar’s jaws bit fiercely through the place he had just been.

Such terrifying jaw strength was absolutely ridiculous! Zu An was even starting to doubt whether his body, which had been tempered by the Primordial Origin Sutra, could withstand such force.

That Fengxi Boar was about to chase after Zu An when a streak of light flew past it. It was Yan Xuehen’s Flying Snow Sword.

If not for the danger of the situation, Zu An would have whistled in admiration. No wonder there were so many sword cultivators in the movies of his previous world. That kind of fighting style really was cool.

Yan Xuehen formed a sword-shaped hand seal. The Flying Snow Sword rushed forth like a shooting star, drawing streaks of cold radiance around the Fengxi Boar.

The Fengxi Boar relied on its thick skin to directly ignore the sword, however. A weapon that thin and weak-looking couldn't even break through its defenses.

What kind of person was Yan Xuehen, though? When she saw what had happened to her companions’ attacks, she immediately understood how ridiculous its defense was. As such, she didn’t attack its body, but rather aimed at its head. No matter how strong it was, its eyes couldn’t be just as sturdy, right?

Sure enough, the Fengxi Boar panicked. It tried to dodge, but Yan Xuehen’s sword skill was too fierce, preventing it from avoiding the attack. It roared in anger.

The others also snapped out of their daze. Yun Jianyue took out her Empress Lantern. Under the effects of the lantern light, the Fengxi Boar’s body immediately slowed down.

When it saw that it couldn't avoid the sword, the boar decided to just close its eyes and face the attack directly. The sword stabbed into its eyelid. Even though there was a bit of blood, it clearly wasn’t able to injure the boar’s eyes.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Even its eyes are this thick?

Zu An took out the Nine Cauldron, taking the chance to engulf the boar with White Lotus Flame. He thought, Since this guy has strong physical defense, then let’s give elemental attacks a try.

Sure enough, when the Fengxi Boar was wrapped up in White Lotus Flame, it screamed. Then, it shook its entire body. Countless steel needles covered in embers flew everywhere.

The group knew that they weren’t really steel needles at all, but rather the Fengxi Boar’s fur. Now that they had the White Lotus Flame on them, they had become even stronger. Zu An had no choice but to dodge them in a panic. The steel needles shot into the forest and passed straight through. The flames immediately set the trees alight, quickly forming a sea of flames.

The Fengxi Boar cried out, taking the chance to flee into the forest depths in alarm. Its body was like a burning fireball. However, the flames were already much smaller than before. After all, it still had the protective layer of grease and dirt around its body. After it had released all of its sharp fur, a lot of the flames had gone along with it.

Zu An was worried that the entire Mulberry Forest would be set ablaze. He quickly collected the White Lotus Flame again. However, the steel needles the boar fired out had already turned the forest into a sea of flames.

The group quickly tried to put out the fire, but how could the White Lotus Flame be that easy to extinguish? Furthermore, the Fengxi Boar had shot out too much of its fur, making the fire start from many different places. As soon as they put out one area, even more areas began to burn.

Yun Jianyue said, “I think maybe we should just let it be. Burning up this entire forest is fine too/ We’ll just burn this Fengxi Boar here and save us some trouble.”

Yan Xuehen said with a frown, “That might not be a good decision. That would harm the harmony of the world, which would lead to unpredictable consequences.”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Don’t try to make yourself seem as if you represent the truth or something. Isn’t that what our Holy Sect always does, and aren’t we still fine and well?”

Zu An said, “This Mulberry Forest really is a bit strange. Did you forget about the Weak Water from before? If we really let it burn down the forest, forget about being burned ourselves, what if this forest has a will? That might be troublesome.”

“Look at you, always speaking up for that stone cold woman. Did we meet each other first, or did you meet her first? It’s almost as if there’s something going on between the two of you or something,” Yun Jianyue said unhappily.

“Witch, what kind of nonsense are you saying?!” Yan Xuehen exclaimed, her cheeks turning red. She felt guilty and didn’t dare to look at Zu An.

Yu Yanluo quickly advised them, “Let’s put out the fire, or else it will spread out of control.”

Suddenly, a wave of dense gas spread outward. Then, a drizzle scattered across the surroundings. The burning flames were immediately put out.

“Why did it suddenly rain?” the group wondered as they gathered together. They all felt happy about the unexpected help.

As the fire died out, the rain also stopped.

“How could normal rain put out the White Lotus Flame?” Zu An wondered, puzzled. Even though the main body of the White Lotus Flame had already been collected, the scattered flames weren’t things normal water could put out.

Yan Xuehen glanced toward the sky. She said with a puzzled expression, “That rain does not seem to have been naturally formed from the mountains and sky, but rather…”

“Rather like something this forest made itself,” Yun Jianyue said, her expression turning grave. “Little An, you really might have jinxed it. This Mulberry Forest has also developed its own will.”

Zu An swallowed and replied, “Something strange like that isn’t too likely, right?”

Yu Yanluo’s expression changed a bit. She asked, “Do you think it’s like the relationship between the Yayu and the Weak Water? Perhaps the Fengxi Boar and this Mulberry Forest are already interlinked somehow.”

“I don’t think so. Otherwise, the Fengxi Boar’s movements wouldn’t end up accidentally hurting the Mulberry Forest,” Yan Xuehen said. “It does not seem to bear malice against us so far. It should be fine as long as we do not provoke it.”

The party all agreed with her analysis. After all, they only needed to kill the Fengxi Boar. Thus, they searched the forest for the Fengxi Boar’s whereabouts. At first, they could still see its footsteps and the White Lotus Flame’s burnt traces. The deeper they went into the forest, though, the fewer those traces became. Eventually, they all disappeared, and there were no traces left to be found.

The Mulberry Forest seemed to have a mysterious domain of its own that affected their divine sense. Additionally, Zu An discovered that there were clearly many small creatures in the forest, and yet the jade badge didn’t allow him to use them as his spies.

By the time they searched for a few more hours, the sky began to darken. They weren’t able to find the Fengxi Boar’s whereabouts at all.

“This Mulberry Forest is too large, and the leaves are too lush and flourishing. It will be challenging for us to find the Fengxi Boar if it wants to hide,” Yan Xuehen said.

“This really is strange… Aren’t these monsters proud and powerful? Shouldn’t they be the straightforward and aggressive type? Why are they all such scaredy-cats?” Yun Jianyue exclaimed in annoyance. The Yayu had been like that before as well; they had needed to really rack their brains to draw it out again.

They tried to brainstorm some more ideas, but all of them had to be discarded.

“Come look, the moon is out,” Yu Yanluo said, suddenly pointing at the sky.

Zu An raised his head and looked at the sky. There was a bright moon in the sky that shone like a jade disk. It was bright and pure, beautiful and mysterious.

Just then, he suddenly thought of something. He asked, “Do you still remember when Yayu mentioned that the Fengxi Boar was perverted?”

Yan Xuehen’s eyes lit up. She asked, “Should we try something along those lines?!”

Yun Jianyue snapped in annoyance, “What are you all looking at me for?”
