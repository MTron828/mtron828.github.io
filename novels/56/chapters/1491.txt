Chapter 1440: Miniskirt

Golden flames raged across the Fiend Emperor’s body. The broken limb regenerated at a visible rate, eventually returning to its original state.

In the distance, the chubby Wu Liang was stupefied. The Fiend Emperor really was the Fiend Emperor after all! He had thought that losing an arm would weaken the Fiend Emperor greatly, but he had actually recovered so quickly.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince quickly moved over to the Fiend Emperor’s side, asking, “Father emperor, are you alright?” He was in a sorry state, clearly having just fought a huge battle.

“I am alright,” the Fiend Emperor replied gravely. “I did not expect the Taotie to be so formidable. I was careless just now and let it swallow up an arm.”

Wu Liang curled his lips. What do you mean, careless? You clearly couldn't avoid it. It was always rumored that there was nothing the Taotie couldn't swallow. It seems that was the case after all.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince said, “That Taotie is one of the four ancient perils, and yet it was actually killed by father emperor. Father emperor really is amazing and incredible! You’re without equal in this world!”

The Fiend Emperor shook his head slightly, saying, “There is no use in praising me. That Taotie was indeed extremely strong, or else it would not have been able to swallow up my arm. If just one of the Four Perils is already so formidable, remember that there are still two more. I am worried that we might have made some miscalculations.”

The Golden Crow Crown Prince was conflicted. On one hand, he hoped his father wouldn’t obtain the secret of immortality, as that would forever leave him a pitiful crown prince. However, he was also worried that something would happen to his father. The dungeon was just too scary, and they had already encountered too many powerful creatures along the way. Even though he wasn’t weak, he was nothing before such ancient disasters. Without his father’s protection, he wouldn’t necessarily be able to return alive.

Suddenly, the world began to change. One after another, several suns began to appear, until there were ten overhead.

Wu Liang began sweating buckets. Fat people feared the heat to begin with, let alone when there were ten suns in the sky. He quickly removed his clothes and pulled out a fan from who knew where. He looked at the suns in the sky and murmured in indescribable shock, “This aura seems to be…”

The Fiend Emperor also looked up. His expression began to burn with desire as he said, “This is the Fiend Emperor’s aura… No, it seems to be a bit different.” Then, his expression changed greatly. No one knew what he was thinking.

The Golden Crow Crown Prince also noticed the suns’ aura. He wondered, “They… They are also Golden Crows?”

The Fiend Emperor nodded. The Golden Crow Crown Prince asked, “Should we go and have a talk with them?”

The Fiend Emperor was a bit moved, but he still shook his head, saying, “There is no need. Even if we are of the same species, we might not feel any closeness to each other. Taking the risk to meet them would only be risky. Having ten Golden Crows as our enemies would be too dangerous. We will move according to plan and undo the seals of the other perils first.”

The Golden Crow Crown Prince was left in admiration. Father is father after all. I was actually still so naive. Just because they’re Golden Crows doesn’t mean they’ll definitely be friendly toward us.

Wu Liang said weakly, “Your highness, we have just undone two of the Four Perils’ seals, which triggered the appearance of these ten suns. If we undo all four seals, will the entire world collapse?”

He had to voice his doubts because just the existence of the dungeon alone represented a battlefield on an entirely different order of magnitude. Even someone as powerful as the Fiend Emperor had lost an arm. If he followed along and was unlucky, he could be caught up in the destruction. In that situation, there wouldn’t even be any burnt remains left of him.

“Worry not. I am not the hot-headed sort. We will undo three of the seals first,” the Fiend Emperor replied. Along the way, Wu Liang had already proven his value, especially in the unsealing of the Taotie sealing formation. As such, since the Fiend Emperor still had more uses for him, he was no longer as harsh on him.

Wu Liang sighed in relief. At the same time, his eyes began to dart around. He considered whether there were better prospects in following the Fiend Emperor, or if it would be better to keep looking for a chance to slip away.

Meanwhile, Zu An’s group moved through Bluefield Pond. As the temperature rose higher and higher, their clothes became lighter and lighter as well.

However, the imagination of this world’s people really was too poor. No matter how hot the three women were, they only took off their jackets, loosened their collars, and rolled up their sleeves at most.

Zu An chuckled and asked, “Aren’t you guys hot?”

Yun Jianyue shot him an annoyed look, saying, “We are women, after all. There’s no way for us to just expose our upper bodies like you.”

At the same time, she thought, This kid’s figure really isn’t bad. No wonder those women were so captivated.

“It’s not hard at all. I’ll help you,” Zu An said, walking over toward her.

“What are you doing?!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed, instinctively taking a step back. She felt a bit of pressure emanating from his strong and muscular figure.

“I’m helping you modify your clothes a bit,” Zu An said while raising her arms. Then he tugged on the cloth around her shoulders, tearing off her sleeves and exposing her bright and clean arms.

“Damn brat, you should be grateful we from the Holy Sect don’t bother with trifles. If you did that to other women, others would all call you a scoundrel!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed. However, she only said that because she didn’t want others to see that she was lacking in confidence, so she had to insist she didn’t care.

“That’s why I tested it out on you and didn’t go to big sis Yan. I was scared that she’d get angry,” Zu An said with a smile.

Yan Xuehen was a bit annoyed. Then why weren’t you scared at all when you stripped me naked back then?!

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +110 +110 +110…

“That’s true, that stone cold woman is more sensitive. She loves to do all that… Ah, what are you doing?!” Yun Jianyue exclaimed.

Rip!

Just like that, Zu An tore off most of the lower half of Yun Jianyue’s dress, revealing her perfectly shaped thighs. Yun Jianyue was ashamed and angry! She moved to kick him, but she realized that in her current situation, that wouldn’t look too appropriate, so she lowered her foot again. Then, she glared at Zu An, her eyes filled with killing intent. If it were anyone else, they would have already died countless times. However, even if it was Zu An, she still needed an explanation from him.

“This’ll make it cooler for you. Don’t worry, this kind of outfit is really stylish in my hometown. We call it a miniskirt,” Zu An explained, trying to reason with her using the pretext of ‘technology’.

When she heard his explanation, all sorts of expressions appeared on Yun Jianyue’s face. She was knowledgeable herself, and occasionally saw people from other places dress similarly. However, such a style really was a bit too daring. Most women wouldn’t dare to dress like that, and she was no exception.

However, when she saw Yan Xuehen’s shocked yet amused expression, she immediately said, “Of course I know about that! do I need you to teach me? Hurry up and alter that stone cold woman’s clothes too.”

Yan Xuehen’s smile immediately froze. She had been having a great time seeing Yun Jianyue’s embarrassment, and yet she ended up getting caught up herself. When she saw Zu An walking over with a smile, seemingly really about to do it, she panicked. This guy has always been ridiculously bold, but he won’t really do it, right?

As such, she quickly exclaimed, “You don’t have to! I can just do it myself.”

Then, she tore the bottom of her dress. She didn’t dare to be as brazen as Zu An, only removing half of her dress up to the knees. Her slender and long calves under the dress made her look even more graceful and womanly.

Yun Jianyue and Yu Yanluo were stunned. They hadn’t expected her to do that so easily! With her nature, she shouldn’t have been willing to do any of that, and would only accept it after a lot of effort to convince her.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, the heat didn’t allow them to think so many carefree thoughts. With Zu An lending a helping hand, Yu Yanluo’s clothes were also quickly modified into a short vest and skirt.

With so much skin exposed, the three women were all embarrassed, but the extreme heat quickly weakened their shame.

Even so, that only made it harder for Zu An. The skimpier clothing didn’t hide much of their amazing figures. He had no choice but to continuously use the Snowflake Sword’s heart method to cool the boiling blood running through his veins a bit.

…

After some time passed, the sparsely dressed group arrived at the shore. When they saw the endless ocean surface and the visible steam coming out of it, they were troubled.

Zu An thought of something. He took out Grandgale’s feather and tossed it forward. A small tornado quickly swept them up toward the great sea.
