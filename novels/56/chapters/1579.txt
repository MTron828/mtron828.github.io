Chapter 1528: I, Yun Jianyue, Have Never Been Inferior!

This scoundrel! Who knows how many women he’s practiced this kind of skill with? Yun Jianyue thought, feeling annoyed inside.

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +55 +55 +55…

She was suddenly stunned. She realized that even though she was a bit angry, she wasn’t angry at the fact that he was disrespectful, but rather that he and another woman…

She panicked when she realized that. When had she started to feel that way? After all, in the past, she would gouge out a man’s eyes if he even looked at her disrespectfully. By that standard, after what Zu An had just done, who knew just how many times the ashes of his remains would have been flung around?

As someone from the Devil Sect, she wasn’t like the robotic stone cold woman. She still had her emotions and desires. It was just that she had never seen any man she liked. But Zu An was different. Ever since she first met him in the Imperial Palace, she had already felt that he was different from other men.

After they had ‘lived together’ in the Imperial Palace, she stopped treating him as a normal man, and instead showed him a bit of intimacy.

After being around each other for the past few months, that feeling became stronger and stronger. She had even begun treating him as her own dear little brother. Only now did she realize that the reason for that was only for Honglei’s sake, leading her to subconsciously trt to avoid ‘other’ things.

Sigh, this guy really is a man who can move hearts….

Still, her reason still managed to win over in the end. She finally managed to push him away a bit, giving her a moment to breathe. She snapped, “Did you not consider that I am Honglei’s master?”

“No.” Zu An said, thinking, It’s not as if I haven’t done something similar before. But the bit of clear-headedness that remained in his mind stopped him from talking about Yan Xuehen.

When she saw that his lips were moving closer again, Yun Jianyue felt angry and panicked. She pushed him away again, exclaiming, “If you haven’t, then think about it now! Me or Honglei, who are you going to pick?”

If she came from a righteous background, there was no way she would do such a thing. But after being in a place like the Devil Sect for so long, she didn’t have as many misgivings around etiquette.

She looked deep within herself and thought, Even if my disciple holds a grudge and I’m laughed at by the stone cold woman or even the entire world, so what? As long as I, Yun Jianyue, like him, I don’t need anyone else’s approval!

When she thought of that, her confidence surged greatly. She stared at Zu An, waiting for his response. As long as he chose her, so what if she went crazy with him today?

I haven’t experienced what that’s like after all these years. This little fella is pretty charming. I won’t be losing out by giving myself to him.

“Why do I have to choose?” Zu An replied as he was faced with her expectant gaze, reaching out for her. “I want everything!”

“You want everything?” Yun Jianyue repeated, her entire body trembling. She was stupefied. There was actually someone this shameless in this world?

She was ashamed and angry as she began to struggle again. But this time, Zu An didn’t give her a chance and just firmly hugged her. His embrace was so firm that she found it a bit hard to breathe.

Zu An’s upper body was completely exposed. His strong and lively muscles wore down Yun Jianyue’s mental strength. She was a demoness, but before that, she was a woman. When a man she liked was so close to her, all of her resistance began to crumble under his continuous attacks.

She released a deep sigh. If this guy chose me instead of Honglei in this kind of situation, then he would just be a fickle man. I might have just looked down on him even more. Even though this is a bit shameless, at least he didn’t abandon Honglei.

Forget it, whatever… At worst, I just won't meet with him again. That way, there won’t be any difficult choices between me and Honglei.

When she thought of that, her tense body gradually relaxed. Her hands also slowly stopped flailing, and she even gradually started to proactively respond to him.

She was the glorious Devil Sect Master, someone who left countless people terror-stricken just from hearing her name. How could she just let him do whatever he wanted like a weak little girl in such a situation?

Now that she was also receiving him passionately, the two of them began to kiss even more intensely. Fewer and fewer clothes covered their bodies.

Suddenly, Yun Jianyue felt great pressure. Then, she slowly descended down to the meadow below. However, her usually strong nature quickly returned. With a twist of her waist, she flipped Zu An under her. She hooked her finger around Zu An’s chin, saying, “You’re the pet I’ve chosen, so of course I have to be on top.”

With a wave of her hand, her clothes began to extend, turning into thick strips of cloth. They wrapped around the surrounding trees, forming a firm tent. Her long hair fluttered around in the wind. Together with her stunning facial features, she was like a rose in spring.

The proud and domineering nature she had carried for so many years made it so that she had to take control of this situation. As if to prove that she hadn’t been so easily pushed down, she was the one who undid his belt.

However, when the reveal happened, she was still completely shocked.

Is this guy… really a human?

In that instant, she even felt a bit scared.

Zu An took the chance to take back the initiative while she was in a daze. Yun Jianyue snapped out of her daze, instinctively trying to seize the initiative back again. However, Zu An didn’t give her the opportunity. At such a critical juncture, her entire body was frozen, so how could she still move around recklessly?Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Yun Jianyue clenched her teeth to prepare herself, but surprisingly, Zu An seemed to be in no rush. Instead, he continuously kissed her. His gentleness made her body melt completely.

“You punk, don’t think I didn’t know you sent that strange ki into my body,” Yun Jianyue said, gently biting his ear. She didn’t sound angry, and only sweetness and loveliness remained. “If I weren’t willing, nothing you did would have worked.”

She looked deeply at her lover with her misty eyes. She had been deemed the greatest user of charm skills throughout the Devil Sect’s history; it was just that she usually felt it beneath her to use it. Now that she was with her lover, she naturally didn’t have to hold back at all. She showed him her most charming side.

When she thought about all of the beauties at this guy’s side, especially the stone cold woman’s disciple… Even though she wouldn’t go so far as to compete with Chu Chuyan, she still didn’t want to be defeated.

I, Yun Jianyue, have never been inferior to another in my entire life!

How could Zu An still hold himself back? He was about to launch his attack when Yun Jianyue suddenly reached out her hand to stop him. He looked at her in confusion.

Yun Jianyue’s cheeks were covered with a peach-colored blush as she said, “Promise me that this is the only time, and you can’t tell anyone else, especially Honglei… and also that stone cold woman.”

“Fine!” Zu An replied in a dry, rough voice. In such a situation, any man would agree to any condition, after all.

Yun Jianyue sighed in relief. She showed him a seductive and moving smile that she normally never showed anyone else. She gently embraced Zu An, completely giving herself to him.

After a muffled growl, the typically domineering and imposing Devil Sect Master, one who had caused rivers of blood to flow and countless people to howl in suffering, shed blood and tears for the first time.

…

She didn’t know how much time had passed, but her expression suddenly changed. She exclaimed, “Damn punk, no wonder you were so daring! So you already broke through to the essence mortal form stage, producing an inner demon!”

She hadn’t noticed it before. Only when they completely joined did she understand why his energies were so chaotic. It was clearly because Zu An had absorbed Sir Fu’s cultivation that his cultivation realm soared greatly. Then, he had reached the second stage of the master rank, the essence mortal form.

When one first reached the master rank, one would have a flame ignited by the root, the coccyx. As one’s cultivation realm rose, it would move from the coccyx to the navel region, which represented the essence form. This stage would purify and refine all of one’s ki essence, making it undergo a qualitative change, freeing one from all sorts of desires so one could focus on cultivation. Such desires didn’t only refer to lust, but rather all greed, anger, foolishness, love, hatred…

The most dangerous part of this stage was that it was easy for an inner demon to appear. If one failed to deal with it, one would easily completely lose one’s reason and be dominated by desire. In more serious cases, one would lose all of one’s cultivation and perish.

When a cultivator reached such a point, they would often need their clan elders or masters to watch over them, assisting them in passing the trial. However, Zu An was too much of a monster. He could even kill the Fiend Emperor and some grandmasters. Yun Jianyue subconsciously considered him to be at the same level as herself. Furthermore, it had already been too long since she passed that stage herself, so she had already forgotten about such details. As such, only now did she recognize Zu An’s dangerous situation.
