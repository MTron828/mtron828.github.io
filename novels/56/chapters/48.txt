Chapter 49: The Legend of the Moochlord

Translator: Pika

Ye Chenliang found himself charging headlong toward Pei Mianman all alone.

He had seen how the dozens of swords had been vaporized in an instant, and it terrified him. If the black flame was even able to melt metal, what chance would a body made out of flesh and blood have?

He had never expected Yuan Wendong’s swords to be so useless. At least a rock would still cause a splash when dropped into a pool of water. All of those swords had disappeared without achieving anything at all.

By the time his rational mind had processed the amount of danger he was in, it was already too late for him to stop. He could only watch in despair as his body headed straight for destruction.

A middle-aged man with a bald spot on his head suddenly appeared between the two of them. He placed a hand on Ye Chenliang’s head and stopped his charge in its tracks.

“A mere third rank actually attempting to knock over a fifth rank by ramming her. What have you been learning in the academy all of these years?” the middle-aged man bellowed furiously. He turned his glare on Pei Mianman. “You too. Do you need to be so vicious towards your fellow schoolmate?”

Pei Mianman reined in her black flames. “All I did was stand here. What can I do if he so fervently wishes to court his own death by charging in like a madman?” With that, she turned her back on the widely-feared discipline master and walked away.

The crowd, who had just witnessed her strength, quickly opened up a path for her to pass through.

Just like them, Zu An was a little taken aback by Pei Mianman’s strength.

It’s fortunate that she hadn’t used her elemental powers yesterday. I would have ended up being vaporized like those swords! No matter how powerful the Heiress Ball of Delights is, there’s no way it can safeguard my life if I’ve already been burned into ashes.

The discipline master, Lu De, watched Pei Mianman depart in silence for a moment. When he turned to look at Ye Chenliang, his expression had changed completely. “Are you the one causing a fuss here?”

Ye Chenliang felt his soul trying to escape from his body. He pointed frantically at Zu An and exclaimed, “Teacher, it wasn’t me! He was the one causing trouble!”

Lu De turned to Zu An, his voice cold. “You were the one causing trouble here?”

Zu An shrugged nonchalantly. “I stood here without making a move from start to finish. They are the ones who insistently tried to provoke me one after another, wanting me to duel them. If you don’t believe me, you can ask all the other students here.”

The crowd quickly verified Zu An’s words. They might have looked down on Zu An for relying on women previously, but the clear demonstration of his unbelievable mooching skills had left them feeling only respect and admiration. Not only was he involved with four out of the Ten Great Beauties of the Sweetheart Ranking, these four even included the top two beauties, Chu Chuyan and Pei Mianman! If they could just learn a thing or two from this master, they would be set for life.

Zu An could have never imagined that for decades, the legend of the ‘Moochlord’ would continue to be passed down through each generation of students. There was even a group of people who revered him so greatly that they couldn’t bear to use his real name, addressing him as ‘The Man’ instead as a show of respect.

Seeing the students vouch for Zu An, Lu De’s face hardened into ice. He began to strike Ye Chenliang mercilessly with the ruler in his hand. “I’ve long heard that you have been forming factions in the academy to bully the weak! Very well, let me show you what it means to reform a person through virtue today!”

The ruler in the hands of the discipline master was far more formidable than Chu Huanzhao’s Wailing Whip. Ye Chenliang shrieked in agony under its blows, his heart filled with a sense of injustice. Yuan Wendong was the one who started the fight, so why are you only hitting me?

Despite his indignance, Ye Chenliang knew better than to voice those thoughts out loud. Yuan Wendong might look like a gentleman on the surface, but that was just a cover to conceal his viciousness. Now that he had reached the fifth rank, Ye Chenliang definitely couldn’t afford to offend him.

After dealing with Ye Chenliang, Lu De turned his gaze toward Hong Xingying, who was still curled up on the ground. “The same goes for you too. It’s only your first day at the academy, but you’ve already gotten yourself into trouble. Do you think that I dare not to teach you a lesson just because you’re from the Chu clan? I shall make sure to beat the academy rules into your bones today!”

Hong Xingying nearly burst into tears.

I was the one who suffered the most tragic plight earlier on, so why must I endure more suffering now? RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

It had only been a day since he arrived in the academy, so he wasn’t clear about the academy’s internal politics. He pointed his finger at Yuan Wendong and whined, “Teacher, why aren’t you punishing him then?”

A cold glint flashed across Yuan Wendong’s eyes.

Lu De scoffed in response. “He’s reached the fifth rank, but what about you? I can tell you frankly that the students who are able to reach the fifth rank are the brightest talents in our country, and they’ll be regarded as treasures no matter where they go. If any of you are able to reach the fifth rank in the future, the academy won’t concern itself with your misbehavior, as long as you don’t go too far.”

Zu An felt his heart skip a beat. Clearly, strength was important no matter which world one was in. The students that had gathered around didn’t appear surprised by Lu De’s declaration. They were well-versed in these ‘implicit rules’.

After Lu De was done saying his piece, he dragged the two wailing fellows away behind him, leaving the crowd praying for their safety.

Wei Suo, who was hugging Zu An’s thigh, gulped fearfully. “Boss, there was a moment there that I feared for your life when you talked back to him. Those who fall prey to Baldhead usually don’t fare too well.”

Zu An chuckled in response. “Since Lu De seeks to reform the students through virtue, it’s only right for him to listen to the voice of reason.”

“You’re probably the only one who dares to reason with him.” Xie Xiu laughed heartily as he walked over to Zu An. “I regarded myself as a man who has conquered many beautiful flowers, but it seems I’m still lacking compared to Brother Zu. To think that you would be able to win the hearts of four of the beauties in the Ten Great Beauties. I’m humbled by your accomplishments. I hope that we can sit down together to trade our insights in the future.”

“Brother Xie, you’re flattering me. Don’t you have one by your side too?” Zu An replied.

“By my side? Why am I not aware of it?” Xie Xiu was taken aback. While there was no lack of beautiful women by his side, he didn’t think that any of them had reached the level of the Ten Great Beauties.

“Isn’t your sister one of the Ten Great Beauties? Brother Xie, it would be great if you could introduce her to us.”

Xie Xiu nearly choked on his saliva. “T-that... I still have matters to attend to, so I’ll be taking my leave.” Completely ignoring Zu An’s attempts to make him stay, he stumbled away frantically without a backward glance.

Zu An was dumbfounded. “Why does it look as if he has seen a ghost?”

Unlike Xie Xiu, Wei Suo’s reverence for Zu An only deepened. “Boss, you have my highest respect. You aren’t content with having the four of them, and still want to conquer young master Xie’s older sister. Truly unthinkable. There are none in our generation who can hope to compare to you!”

“You sure have a smooth tongue. You would have surely thrived in the corporate world.” Zu An shoved Wei Suo aside, slightly disgusted by all his fawning. He turned his attention to Ji Xiaoxi and bowed slightly. “Miss Ji, you have my earnest gratitude for your assistance in the earlier matter.”

Chu Huanzhao butted in before Ji Xiaoxi could respond. “What do you mean by this? I was the one to help you first!”

Ji Xiaoxi’s cheeks colored slightly. “It’s nothing much, I was just doing what was right. I need to leave now.”

Clearly still uncomfortable with being the center of attention, she began to jog away. However, after barely taking a few steps, she turned back around. “I nearly forgot. Do drop by my home when you have some time on hand. My father would like to talk with you.”

“Oooh~”

The crowd stared at the two of them weirdly, which surprised Ji Xiaoxi. She belatedly realized the innuendo hidden within her words, but she had no idea how to begin clarifying the matter. In the end, she gave up and ran away, blushing furiously.

“What the hell was that? How dare she seduce you in my presence?!” Chu Huanzhao huffed angrily. The way her small chest puffed in and out looked incredibly adorable.

Zu An rolled her eyes at her. “It’s not as if you’re my wife, so why are you butting your nose into my business?”

The true meaning behind Ji Xiaoxi’s words was clear as day to him. Most likely, it was regarding the trauma he was suffering from. It looked like he would have to make haste in his quest to acquire some dudous. Perhaps, he might just be able to fool that old pervert Ji Dengtu.

“I... I’m just keeping an eye on you on my older sister’s behalf!” Chu Huanzhao’s cheeks puffed out indignantly. “It hasn’t been long since my older sister left, and you’re already messing around with other women!”

Zu An replied nonchalantly, “You can go ahead and ask your older sister if she needs you to keep an eye on me.”

That wife of mine looks at me the same way a person would look at a stranger on the street. No, I might even be less than a stranger to her. Why should I keep my chastity for her then... Pui pui pui, what the hell am I talking about?

“Hmph! Stop flirting around here.” Yuan Wendong walked over with a loathsome look on his face. “Zu An, I don’t believe that you can live your life hiding behind women. It won’t be long before the Clans Tournament. By then, let’s see if you can get a woman to substitute you on the ring!”

Zu An was confused. He turned to Chu Huanzhao and asked, “What Clans Tournament?”

Chu Huanzhao was pouting unhappily, but still answered his question. “Just like our Chu clan, the Yuan clan is involved in the arm trade too, so the competition between our two clans is fierce. In order to avoid escalating the conflict, the two clans have decided to hold a tournament once every three years. The juniors of both clans must participate, and the winner of the tournament will get to decide the market share that each clan gets for each sector for the next three years.”

“Do I need to participate as well?” Zu An asked.

Chu Huanzhao nodded in reply. “Everyone in the clan needs to participate. My older sister and cousins from the second branch and third branch were the representatives in the previous tournament. Since you’re the son-in-law of our Chu clan, it’s likely that you’ll have to step forward and represent us too.”

Zu An felt strangled by this abrupt news.

What the hell is this? I can’t even enjoy the privileges of being the son-in-law of a prestigious clan, but I still need to fulfill my responsibilities?

“Then... is the Yuan clan a ducal clan too?”

Chu Huanzhao shook her head. “No. Their clan has a noble lineage too, but they are without a fief. In terms of position, they are far beneath my father.”

“Isn’t it embarrassing for a ducal clan to have to compete with minor powers to decide the market share through a duel?”

Before Chu Huanzhao could answer him, Yuan Wendong interrupted her, still wearing the same ugly expression. “The Brightmoon Duke has a high standing, but our Zhou Dynasty is a place ruled by laws. Besides, the Chu clan isn’t the only clan with ducal lineage.”

Zu An nodded. “Ah, I get what you’re saying. In other words, you have someone else backing you. No wonder you’re barking so loudly. It turns out you already have a master!”

You have successfully trolled Yuan Wendong for 321 Rage points!

Noticing some academy staff not too far away, Yuan Wendong took a deep breath. “You have nothing but your sharp mouth, so I shan’t waste my time bickering with you. Just wait till the day of the tournament...”

Yuan Wendong leaned toward Zu An and whispered softly, “I’ll break your limbs and turn you into a cripple!”

Zu An sighed deeply. “I think you should first worry about how you are going to compensate these fine students for their swords.”

Lu De’s sudden appearance had broken up the fight, and most of the crowd had drifted off. However, a dozen or so students still lingered, casting hesitant glances at Yuan Wendong, shuffling their feet but not moving away.

Yuan Wendong had used their swords to attack Pei Mianman earlier, only to have her burn their swords to cinders with her black flame. While they felt that Yuan Wendong should take responsibility and compensate them, their fear of him had held them back so far.

However, as Zu An brought up the issue, they found their voices and began shouting over one another.

“Compensate us our swords!”

“I spent a lot of money to purchase that sword of mine!”

“My sword is the work of Master so and so, and was known to be able to slice through metal like mud...”
