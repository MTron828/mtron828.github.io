Chapter 1208: Help Our Disciples Control Their Man

Little White and Little Blue looked back at her with wide, innocent eyes.

Yun Jianyue was speechless. How could she have known that there were other people there? If not for the fact that she had faced all sorts of crazy situations, in this situation where she was completely caught off guard, she would already have cried out in alarm.

She turned around and shot Zu An a resentful look, then quickly closed the wardrobe door. Who knew what Zu An had been doing with these two little girls in his room just now! Otherwise, why would they have chosen to hide inside the wardrobe?

Right, that brat’s clothes weren’t on when I came in…

You little rascal!

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +555 +555 +555…

She didn’t know why she was so angry either. But she couldn't be bothered to get revenge and quickly looked for other hiding places. Apart from the wardrobe, there was only the screen divider left, so she quickly darted over.

“Aaaah!” This time, she finally couldn't hold it in. She cried out, but fortunately, she reacted quickly and covered her own mouth.

Yan Xuehen looked at her expressionlessly. The two women looked into each other’s eyes just like that. It really was awkward.

“Why are you here?”

“If you’re here, why can’t I be here?”

The two had fought each other for so many years that they didn’t even have to speak. They knew what the other was thinking just from a single look. Sparks seemed to flicker in the air when their eyes met.

That rascal Zu An!

Yun Jianyue’s expression became strange. Zu An hadn’t had any clothes on when she first came in, and it seemed as if someone else had been helping him apply medicine.

“Don’t tell me…”

“No, I didn’t! Don’t think of random things!”

Yan Xuehen’s face was red as she wordlessly denied her rival’s suspicions with her expression. The two women both tacitly reached the same verdict on who the main cause of all of this was.

“You damn brat. Now so many people have overheard our private conversations.”

“You little scoundrel, you’ve actually made me feel so embarrassed. That witch almost had something else to use against me.”

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +333 +333 +333…

Zu An’s scalp turned numb when he saw the Rage points pouring in. How was he going to deal with the aftermath of this situation?

Just then, Yu Yanluo suddenly pushed open the door and came in. She was dressed in a long, light beige dress. As the faint moonlight scattered across her body, a sparkling luster surrounded her figure. She looked just like a goddess of the moon.

Little White and Little Blue secretly peeped from the wardrobe, feeling ashamed of their inferiority. They were already quite the beauties in their clan, but compared to the clan leader, they were still a bit inferior. The main reason was that they were still too young, giving them a natural disadvantage compared to Yu Yanluo’s mature aura.

Forget about the two of them, even Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue stopped their private war and stared at Yu Yanluo through the gaps between the screen divider. They both felt conflicted. No wonder this woman’s beauty shocked the entire world, with so many men yearning for her day and night. She really is ridiculously beautiful.

Even though the two women didn’t feel that they were inferior in terms of appearance at all, they both knew they lacked the warmth and inviting charm Yu Yanluo had. Furthermore, every action she took was full of womanly grace, of the sort that was most effective at breaking down men’s wills.

“Hm? The door isn’t closed?” Yu Yanluo exclaimed in surprise. She vaguely registered some sounds of alarm, but when she saw that Zu An’s body was exposed, her attention was immediately diverted. Her face turned a bit red as she asked, “Shouldn’t you be sleeping? Why aren’t you wearing anything?”

Zu An was left in a bit of a daze. Just how many times had he had this conversation today? He replied almost instinctively, “Oh, I was applying medicine just now.”

“Didn’t I ask Maid Xing to stay here to serve you? Why are you applying medicine by yourself?” Yu Yanluo said with an air of pity.

Whether it was Little White or Little Blue in the wardrobe, or Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen behind the divider, all of their expressions turned strange. Don’t tell me…

Sure enough, Zu An said, “I was worried about your safety, so I sent her back to protect you. Since you’re here now, why don’t you help me apply medicine?”

And there it is!

The women all gritted their teeth. You freaking playboy, just how many times have you used this move already?

You have successfully trolled Yan Xuehen for +233 +233 +233…

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +233 +233 +233…

You have successfully trolled Little White for +233 +233 +233…

You have successfully trolled Little Blue for +233 +233 +233…

Zu An shuddered when he saw the Rage points coming in through the back end.

Fortunately, Yu Yanluo didn’t have any intention of refusing him. She naturally sat down by his side and picked up the ointment. She exclaimed, “Hm? This seems to be Elder Blue’s Myriad Flower Ointment.” She had naturally heard about the item, being the Snake race’s clan leader.

Little Blue panicked. Big brother Zu, you’d better not tell her! Otherwise, I’d be finished if the clan leader found out and thought I was secretly trying to steal her man…

To her surprise, however, Zu An directly said, “It was something Miss Little Blue brought. Miss Little White also brought me something, a Hundred Herb Pill. Both of them really are too kind.”

Little Blue and Little White clutched their foreheads. They continued to groan inwardly. We’re finished, we’re finished!Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Behind the screen, Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue exchanged a look. They both saw worry in each other’s eyes.

Zu An’s luck with the ladies was a bit too great, right? He has only met those two girls today, and yet they were already giving him their most precious gifts! Compared to these fiend race girls, their disciples were still a bit too bashful…

Our disciples aren’t here, so as their masters, we should properly keep their man in check.

Yu Yanluo chuckled when she heard that. She said, “These two medicines are the clan leaders’ treasures. I’ve almost never seen them used in all my time in Cloudcenter Commandery, yet they actually offered up these two medicines.”

Zu An chuckled and said, “Perhaps Elders White and Blue are trying to use this chance to reconcile with you.”

Yu Yanluo shook her head. “These are clearly those two girls’ feelings. You can’t let them down now.”

Little White and Little Blue’s faces began to well up with tears. The clan leader really is a good person; she’s actually speaking up for us! She really is too kind…

Hmph, grandfather and the others keep speaking poorly about the clan leader in private. They really shouldn’t do that.

“I do need to thank them,” Zu An said. A gentle smile appeared on his face when he thought of the two girls’ enthusiasm.

“Where are they? Elders White and Blue seemed to be looking for them all over just now.” Yu Yanluo asked curiously.

“Ahem, they returned after giving me the medicine,” Zu An said. No matter how thick his skin was normally, his face still heated up a bit. After all, there were so many spectators in the room.

Little White and Little Blue both sighed. Fortunately, their big brother Zu hadn’t exposed them. Otherwise, they didn’t know how they would face the clan leader afterward. As for their grandfathers, their treasures had been stolen, so how could they not be nervously looking for the two girls at that moment?

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue behind the screen both had contemptuous looks. This guy told lies without batting an eyelid; does he lie to us like this normally?

A complete playboy!

“Oh,” Yu Yanluo said while gently helping him apply the ointment. “Then have you seen Sect Masters Yan and Yun? I didn’t want to end up neglecting them in any way and went out to search for them in their rooms, but they weren’t there.”

Yan Xuehen and Yun Jianyue felt their hearts rise into their throats in panic. They had just been cursing Zu An for lying without batting an eyelid, but now, they were praying earnestly for him to not tell the truth. Otherwise, if this matter came to light, it would be complete social suicide!

“Uh, maybe they were just really enthusiastic toward the Fiend Races and they went out for a stroll,” Zu An said. He thought to himself, Well, they’re right here, so it would be strange if you found them in their rooms.

Yu Yanluo thought of the two’s statuses and said, “That makes sense. With their cultivation, they should be fine even if they’re injured.”

Suddenly, she voiced her surprise. “Why do many of your wounds already have medicine applied to them?”

Zu An almost choked on his own saliva. He said, “I did it myself.”

Yu Yanluo didn’t suspect him and replied, “The wounds on your body seem to be pretty much taken care of. Take off your pants then.”

All the other women in the room were dumbfounded.
