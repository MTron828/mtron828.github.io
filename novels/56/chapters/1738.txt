Chapter 1687: One Breath Three Essence

“What Brother Wang says is wise indeed; it is just that Brother Wang’s cultivation is too high, and this is also your Righteous Sun Sect’s territory. This humble Li had no choice but to use this kind of plan. I am overwhelmed with guilt inside too,” Li Changsheng said with a look of shame. He clearly didn’t like this plan all that much either.

Wang Wuxie snorted and said, “You speak so nobly, but you behave like a crook. Li Changsheng, what is the point in pursuing a so-called great dao anymore? You are destined to share no karma with immortality in this life.”

Li Changsheng’s expression remained calm as he replied, “Since ancient times, how many have even achieved immortality? It is nothing special if I cannot reach it in the end.”

When he saw that Li Changsheng seemingly wasn’t offended at all, Wang Wuxie felt as if he had punched a pillow. He asked, “Just how did you get Yan Xuehen’s handwriting? Furthermore, in such a way that I didn’t even see any flaws.” That was what he couldn't understand, as well as the reason why he had gotten caught in this trap so easily.

Li Changsheng asked in surprise, “You didn’t even suspect that junior sister Yan could be a part of this plan?”

Wang Wuxie said with a sneer, “Fairy Yan is such an outstanding person. Why would she wallow in a mire with you bastards?” He had never loved another woman so much in his life, and he had absolute confidence in his discernment.

Li Changsheng said with a sigh, “There have always been rumors that Wang Wuxie adored junior sister Yan, and that indeed seems to be the case today. Indeed, the letter was not written by junior sister Yan, but rather something I created by piecing together some ordinary letters of hers. Even though the message was not written by junior sister Yan, every single character was personally written, so that is why you did not notice anything was strange.”

Only someone like him, who was also from White Jade Sect, would have a chance of having access to so many of Yan Xuehen’s letters without drawing suspicion.

Xuan Bajing couldn't help but laugh. He said, “The letter actually isn’t perfect at all, as it was pieced together. At first, I was worried that you would be too sharp and wouldn’t fall for it, but I didn’t expect you to still take the bait. Now it seems that you, Wang Wuxie, aren’t as smart as the rumors say, huh?”

“Brother Wang is extremely smart in other ways, but when it comes to Fairy Yan, you become much dumber,” Guan Chouhai said with a smile. “Men really are stupid. When it involves the woman they adore, they’ll deceive themselves even if there are some oddities.”

Wang Wuxie couldn't take such humiliation and shot back “Guan Chouhai, even someone like you has the nerve to talk about me? I still remember how much of a bootlicker you were to Yan Xuehen. Meanwhile, I wouldn’t lower myself to do such things.”

Guan Chouhai furiously replied, “I can’t stand this smugness of yours. The courtship process still has an aspect of face to it, you know. After all, there’s a reason why good women don’t like those who are too passive. How much have you spoken with Yan Xuehen, and how much have she and I talked? It might just be that she’s more familiar with me than you.

“So, mister Wang, you really have no self-awareness. If Yan Xuehen really does end up feeling emotions for someone, it can only be me. Why would she ever make an appointment in the middle of the night with someone like you?”

“Stop trying to look like a good guy! You’re despicable!” Wang Wuxie snapped. He didn’t even want to waste any energy on being mad at Guan Chouhai. He understood Yan Xuehen’s nature best. Why would she ever like someone like Guan Chouhai?

Guan Chouhai could feel the contempt in Wang Wuxie’s eyes. He really couldn't take it anymore and began to scream about how he would fight him to the death.

Xuan Bajing couldn't continue to watch and said, “Brother Guan, we have more pressing matters to take care of. Don’t waste time getting jealous in this kind of place.”

Guan Chouhai looked embarrassed. However, he still changed his mind.

When he felt several energies target him, Wang Wuxie shivered. He wanted to stall for a bit more time and said, “There is one thing that I cannot understand. Even though I did not treat all of you particularly well, at the very least, I did not abuse my power to oppress anyone. Why did you join together to go against me today?”

He spoke while looking around out of the corners of his eyes. Someone had already secretly isolated their surroundings. Even if they fought, no one outside would detect the activity. It seemed that it wouldn’t be possible to alert the Righteous Sun Sect’s people, so he could only rely on himself to break out of the encirclement.

Li Changsheng sighed and said, “Brother Wang was flush with success the past few years, so of course you would not understand the struggles of others.”

Xuan Bajing harrumphed. “And to think that in the past, our Kunlun Void Sect was the brightest and best among the daoist sects, and yet we’ve been oppressed by the court until we reached our current state. Only a henchman like you who clung to the court was well-off. As for the other sects, which one of us hasn’t suffered bitterly?”

Wang Wuxie said in surprise, “It seems you all plan on a rebellion.”

He knew that the emperor was coming to Violet Mountain for the Fengshan Ceremony. If they were targeting him at this time, they were clearly going to go against the emperor.

“Brother Wang is intelligent, as expected.” Li Changsheng said, nodding in praise. “If Brother Wang is willing to cooperate with us, our nine sects can naturally work together in harmony and face Zhao Han together.”

“Even if I agreed now, would you really believe me?” Wang Wuxie replied. He naturally wouldn't let such random words sway him.

Li Changsheng said with a smile, “Of course, we would need Brother Wang to show us a bit of sincerity.”

Wang Wuxie didn’t ask what that so-called sincerity was, as it would probably be to let them seal his meridians and allow them to detain him. How could he ever agree to something like that?

“So was Emptiness Isle’s Peng Wuyan also seized by your side?” he asked bluntly. They had looked everywhere, and yet Peng Wuyan was nowhere in sight. He had no idea who had such magical abilities, to silently kidnap a rather strong disciple on Violet Mountain without causing the slightest disturbance.

Li Changsheng shook his head and said, “We do not know what is going on with that either. It seems there are other formidable individuals hidden on Violet Mountain.”

“Just how many sects are involved in this matter?” Wang Wuxie asked. He thought to himself that if all eight sects had joined, that could very well spell the end of his Righteous Sun Sect.

Li Changsheng stroked his beard and said with a smile, “Brother Wang will naturally know if you join us.”

Xuan Bajing felt a bit impatient and snapped, “What’s the point of wasting all this time with him? He’s clearly stalling for time.”

Guan Chouhai looked relaxed as he said, “If he wants to stall for time, then let him. Either way, he’s already been poisoned. The longer this goes on, the stronger the poison’s effects will become.”

Wang Wuxie had already begun to feel his vision blurring a bit. He recalled that white smoke he inhaled and asked with a frown, “What kind of poison did you use?” He knew that with his cultivation, normal poison had no chance of being effective.

“Brother Wang’s cultivation is too high, so we can only tell you after you’ve been fully subdued,” Guan Chouhai said with a smug expression. Seeing this greatest rival in love fall like this had clearly made him really happy. This guy normally always looks at me with contempt, but look at you now!

Suddenly, Wang Wuxie moved. He knew he would be in a worse situation the longer he waited.

The other three quickly made their moves too. Normally, with their status, there was no way they would work together to face a single opponent. However, Wang Wuxie was too strong, and their objective today was too important. If they failed, none of them would be able to handle the consequences.

The four of them quickly clashed together. Light flickered as they all brought out the most powerful techniques they knew. Energies clashed, destroying everything around them. Even a master rank cultivator could die from the blast waves if they were present. In just a few breaths of time, the four of them had already exchanged dozens of moves. Every moment was surrounded by peril. A single mishap could result in their deaths.

A while later, they separated again. Wang Wuxie was in the center, gasping for air. He already had many wounds on his body, and his hair was no longer styled as elegantly as usual. He had clearly suffered serious injuries. The other three’s clothes were damaged, indicating that they were also injured.

Li Changsheng sighed and said, “It has always been said that you were number one among the daoist sects, but we were never quite convinced. Now that I have experienced it myself, I accept it wholeheartedly.”

After all, they were all sect master-level individuals, people who had equal status to Wang Wuxie. They had even ambushed him, and yet they couldn't take him down immediately even after working together. Judging from that, it was clear just how strong Wang Wuxie was.

Wang Wuxie understood his current predicament well, though. The reason why he hadn’t lost yet against these three was because they hadn’t really worked together. Furthermore, they didn’t trust each other either. They had still held back some of their strength to guard against an ambush from each other. That was why he had been able to just barely hold on.

However, he knew that they could make countless mistakes, while he would be finished if he made even one. Furthermore, he could already feel the poison invading his meridians. His ki was already declining to the point where he couldn't endure it for much longer. If this continued, he would lose without a doubt.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He no longer tried to fight vainly. Suddenly, he let out a great roar, and his body split into three copies that ran in three different directions.

“One Breath Three Essence?” Li Changsheng and the others cried out in alarm. At that moment, they couldn't figure out which one was the real one.
