Chapter 674: Embarrassing Encounter

Translator: Pika

Zu An was fully enjoying these girls’ massage. Every single cell in his body was screaming with joy.

Sigh, the girls of this world are much better than the girls of my past world. They’re all so soft spoken and nice, and they’re even talented in many ways. Those girls from my past world are all ready to curse at any time and always starting sh*t.

While he was enjoying himself, he suddenly felt like there were less and less girls pampering him. The room seemed to have become a lot colder.

“Huh? Why did you guys stop massaging me?” Zu An couldn’t help but raise his head. He saw a stunning young lady standing by the entrance, her pink dress perfectly outlining her figure. Her chest filled up the front of her dress, her supple waist looked like it was asking to be held. Even more stunning were her long and straight legs that could vaguely be made out through the dress. It was as if there was a jade-like layer of light covering them, making her skin seem even more soft and fine.

Even though this wasn’t the first time he saw her, Zu An was still amazed. This age was far more open-minded than ancient china, but dressing like this was still considered daring. However, she didn’t give off any feelings of low-class, but rather made one feel like she had dressed herself well, as if this seductive appearance was made for her.

Zu An had a sincere smile on his face. “Honglei, you came.”

Qiu Honglei said with a smile, “If I didn’t, then I might’ve missed out on seeing young master Zu enjoying himself so much.”

Her voice was soft and lovely, but the Rage points that he continued to receive from the back end sold her out.

Zu An was speechless. Didn’t you used to live in Immortal Abode? You should know how pitiful these girls are! I’m helping them with their business here to make their lives a bit easier, so why are you getting upset?

Of course, he wasn’t stupid enough to blurt that out. Instead, he said, “It’s all a misunderstanding! I wanted to meet with you as soon as possible too!”

“You wanted to meet me, but then you ended up being surrounded by all these girls?” Qiu Honglei was still smiling, but her smile was dangerous.

Zu An said with a resolute expression, “You’re only judging me by what you see, you don’t know how much thought I put into this! I’ve already been in the government brothel for a while, but you still didn’t come out to meet me. I don’t have any other way of contacting you, so I could only make you jealous so you would come out sooner!”

“Hmph, who will get jealous over you…” Qiu Honglei harrumphed. Her face flushed red.

Zu An used this chance to reach out his arm and use the Heaven Devouring Sutra, pulling her right into his embrace. If those Shang Dynasty emperors knew that he used their most powerful art for this type of thing, they might get so angry that they’d jump right out of their coffins!

“What are you doing? Let go of me!” Qiu Honglei struggled subconsciously.

But how could Zu An let go now? He kissed her right on her soft red lips. “Mmm!…” Qiu Honglei’s entire body went rigid. Then, it gradually softened.

A while later, she suddenly noticed something and quickly pushed him away. “Just now… did you kiss those girls?”

“No way, I only told them to give me a massage.” Then, Zu An looked into her eyes and said with great affection, “You are the only one I will ever kiss in this type of place.”

“You only know how to say good things.” Qiu Honglei harrumphed in annoyance. However, the joy between her brows was clear. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Zu An sighed. This girl was clearly putting on the look of an enchantress, yet she’s this naive and pure.

That Jiao Sigun who picked that delicate and innocent looking green tea bitch was instead the one who seemed less naive in comparison.

He gently embraced this beauty in his arms. “Honglei, I’m really blessed to be able to meet with you again.”

Qiu Honglei was moved. She loved hearing these types of things. She pressed her face gently against his chest and said, “I am too.”

The two of them snuggled up against each other like this, enjoying this rare moment of peace.

Qiu Honglei’s face suddenly turned red a while later. Her lovely eyes were misty. “Bad guy…”

This type of charming look and seductive voice is going to do even a monk in, let alone me!

The pressure became greater and greater. Qiu Honglei’s face became more and more red.

Zu An’s throat went dry. He said with a sigh, “Anyone who hugs Honglei like this and remains unmoved can’t even be considered a real man.”

“Smooth talker…” Qiu Honglei was completely flustered. She subconsciously stood up. “You should call over those girls to help you out, I won’t get angry.”

She was about to leave after saying this, but Zu An pulled her back. “But all of them together can’t even add up to a fraction of you!”

Qiu Honglei was happy to hear that. This guy was always so great with words. However, she quickly reacted and said, “No way! You know that my cultivation method is special, so I can’t…”

Zu An cut her off before she even finished what she had to say. “No, you can.”

He guided her soft little hand down while talking.

Qiu Honglei immediately remembered when she helped him the last time she was at his house. Her ears burned up.

But she was also starting to get into it. The first reason was because of her natural curiosity, while the second was that she wanted to please her lover. That was why she bent down after a bit of resistance.

“It’s really amazing… How does it get so much bigger so quickly?”

“Will it hurt for you?”

“You won’t do it all over my face like last time, right?”

…

Qiu Honglei was full of questions. She exclaimed in admiration from time to time.

Zu An replied to her questions one after another and guided her through the process. But he had to admit that she had a talent for this. She was a bit underripe at first, but quickly became self-taught. Her delicate hands became more and more gentle, making him feel like he was experiencing a soft spring breeze, or a warm sun in winter.

A while later, Qiu Honglei finally couldn’t hold herself back anymore. “How much longer do you need me to do this for? My wrist is starting to get sore.”

She was already bent over with her head lowered to begin with. When she said this, her breath brushed over him like the fragrance of orchids. Zu An became more and more sensitive.

He suddenly thought of something and gently pressed his hand down on her head.

Qiu Honglei was a Devil Sect witch after all, and she spent some time in Immortal Abode. She immediately knew what he wanted to do.

She gave him a resentful look, but she didn’t refuse him in the end. She sorted out the messy strands of hair around her temples, and then her soft red lips pressed down.

Zu An inhaled sharply.

…

A while later, the door slammed open. A fierce voice sounded upon seeing this scene. “What are you two doing?!”

Qiu Honglei was like a startled rabbit. She jumped straight up and clutched her mouth while looking at the long haired beauty at the entrance. She said in embarrassment, “Mas… master.”

The one who came was obviously Yun Jianyue. When she heard that Zu An paid a visit, she rushed over excitedly. Yet when she opened the door, her excitement instantly vanished.

She was annoyed that her carefully raised disciple she passed everything to actually ended up being such a disappointment.

Also, this Zu An really was hateful! He actually defiled her disciple!

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +888 +888 +888…

“Do you really have the nerve to call me your master right now? I don’t have any disciples like you.” Yun Jianyue gave Qiu Honglei an impatient look.

Even though Qiu Honglei was the Devil Sect’s witch, she was still a virgin. Doing this type of thing, and then being seen made her so embarrassed she felt like she could die. She could no longer stay here after being criticized like this by her master. She clutched her red face and ran out.

Only Zu An and Yun Jianyue were left.

Zu An pulled up his pants in embarrassment. He blurted out, “Big sis sect master, couldn’t you have at least knocked first?”

Yun Jianyue’s expression was cold. “Am I supposed to just wait as you defile my disciple?”
