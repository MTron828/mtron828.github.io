Chapter 1633: Making the Whole World His Enemy

Yun Jianyue was furious when she heard that. What’s wrong with the Devil Sect? Did the Devil Sect eat your food or something?!

She was about to say something in protest when Qiu Honglei, who was familiar with her temper, quickly grabbed her and said, “Master, calm down, calm down!”

If they got involved now, wouldn’t they be attacked from all sides? After all, Golden Peak was full of daoist sect experts. The two of them, who were from the Devil Sect, would be torn apart.

Yun Jianyue finally calmed down, but she glared at the distant Guan Chouhai, clearly remembering this grudge.

Guan Chouhai was confused. What did I do to offend Emptiness Isle? However, he had more important things to worry about. He criticized Pei Mianman for using a dishonest weapon and not fighting in a proper way. In response, Elder Huo Ling naturally showered him with criticism.

However, the other sects all speculated wildly. They had never seen Fu Hao’s Owl either. They wanted to take the chance to use Guan Chouhai to get more information on it.

As for Yan Xuehen, she didn’t care too much about worldly affairs anyway, so she had no reason to speak up in such a situation.

Guan Chouhai said to Pei Mianman, “Lady Pei, bring out your bronze owl for everyone to examine. That way, we’ll know if it’s some kind of sinister object. This is for your sake too, or else you might be carrying something evil without even knowing it. If something bad happens, you might not be able to turn back.”

Pei Mianman tightly pursed her lips. She couldn't explain the origins of Fu Hao’s Owl Either, and who knew what they do with their examination? Would they just use the pretext of finding an evil object to confiscate it from her? Furthermore, it was a symbol of her having been married to Zu An for several decades in Yinxu. How could she let someone else mess with it?

When he saw her remain silent, Guan Chouhai’s smile grew colder and colder. He continued, “Are you not speaking because you’re lacking in confidence?”

The disciples all had strange expressions. The male disciples all thought, Anyone who looks like Lady Pei is definitely innocent! But they were scared of Guan Chouhai’s reputation, so none of them dared to say a thing.

The female disciples, on the other hand, had different thoughts. They felt that this woman was a vixen, that someone so big could never be honest. They felt a natural hostility toward her. Furthermore, some of them were fangirls of Zhi Yin. When they saw him in such a miserable state, they immediately directed their anger at her, so they immediately voiced their support.

Elder Huo Ling snapped furiously “That weapon is my disciple’s personal object; how can it be brought out for everyone to examine? I think Zhi Yin’s ball or whatever is more evil. Why don’t you have him hand over his weapon for us to examine?”

Guan Chouhai reached out his hand and summoned Zhi Yin’s Shadowless Ball as soon as he heard that, saying, “The ball is right here. This one has no objections to all of you examining it at all.”

Elder Huo Ling choked. She hadn’t expected her impulsive action to end up doing her in. However, as Guan Chouhai took the chance to walk onto the stage, she blocked his path and protested, “Either way, I will not allow you to bully my disciple!”

Guan Chouhai’s expression darkened as he replied, “Elder, please do not be confused. If that is an evil object, it will not only harm your Jadefall Palace, but also bring danger to all of the daoist sects.”

Elder Huo Ling said furiously, “Don’t give me that bullshit. Either way, I won’t let you touch Manman.”

Guan Chouhai said coldly, “Elder seems to be obstinately persisting on the wrong path. Then, don’t blame this one for offending you.”

The two were about to clash when Wan Tongtian also took a step forward and called out, “What, could it be that Brother Guan believes our Jadefall Palace doesn’t have anyone left in it?”

In that instant, Guan Chouhai was flanked from two sides. As long as he acted, a fierce battle would definitely follow.

Elder Huo Ling’s previously fierce expression became a bit gentler. This was the first time she found Wan Tongtian a bit pleasing to look at in decades. So senior brother still cares about me…

The White Jade Sect’s Elder Li chuckled and walked over, saying, “How about we have a discussion? Let’s not ruin the mood here.” Despite those words, he stood in between Guan Chouhai and Wan Tongtian; he was clearly trying to help Guan Chouhai.

His choice was unsurprising. Jadefall Palace’s Wan Guiyi was already a famous genius, while this Pei Mianman had suddenly come out of nowhere and defeated the famous representative disciple Zhi Yin. Jadefall Palace’s future prospects were limitless, which meant there was a danger of the other sects being forced to bow down to them in the future. No other sect was willing for such a situation to appear. They naturally wanted to take the chance to pressure Jadefall Palace.

Wan Tongtian naturally saw through his intention. He was shocked and angry, replying, “What is the meaning of this, Brother Li?”

Li Changsheng smiled, saying, “We’re all old acquaintances, so I didn’t want our relationship to sour. How about we all take a step back and have this valiant female disciple bring out that weapon for us to take a look? I promise that as long as it isn’t some evil object, I’ll definitely return it to its rightful owner.”

Wan Tongtin and Elder Huo Ling’s expressions were both ugly. The condition of ‘as long as it isn’t an evil object’ was very vague. Who knew what they’d say once they got their hands on it? However, it was two against two right now, so they didn’t have the advantage. They could only wait until the other sects voiced their opinions.

Kunlun Void Sect’s Elder Xuan Dou stroked his beard and said, “This old one believes that there is no harm in checking either. After all, the innocent are without guilt, so it can also appease people's curiosity.”

Kunlun Void, Jadefall Palace, and Heavenly Sorrow were the sects with the greatest histories, and had been the most powerful once upon a time. The longer their history was, the more entangled their grudges had become. They all hoped the others would have a bad time so that they could completely dominate their rivals. Even though the three sects had all fallen and were far from their past glory, that habit, which had been etched into their bones, was still there.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Mount Luofu’s Elder Xu, Purity Temple’s Vice Manor Lord He Yuan, and Supreme Mystery Cave’s second cavern master all voiced their agreement. They all naturally spoke some seemingly high-sounding words. However, they all had their own thoughts. They were all lower-ranked among the nine sects. Their strength had always been beneath that of Jadefall Palace, so they naturally hoped for their rival to be weakened, so as to be able to take their place.

When she saw that, Qiu Honglei couldn't help but say, “Master, I’ve discovered that these orthodox sect’s people are even more shameless than the Devil Sect. Our side is clearly bad, while these people have endless vicious schemes inside, and yet they always speak as if they’re righteous.”

Yun Jianyue sneered and replied, “You’ve only realized this now? Compared to our Devil Sect… Ahem, our Holy Sect, there’s no real difference inside. The only part we’re lacking is that we’re not as good at this superficial stuff, which is why we’re always cursed by others. On the contrary, they’ve completely fooled the dumb masses.”

Qiu Honglei muttered, “But from what I’ve seen, master is pretty proud of that. You’ve never made us change either.”

“Of course I’m proud of it! If we were also that fake, wouldn’t we be just as bad as them?” Yun Jianyue replied, as if that were only proper and to be expected.

Qiu Honglei was speechless. It seemed that the Holy Sect’s situation couldn't be changed for some time.

…

Wan Tongtian and Elder Huo Ling were both shocked and furious. Their sects’ strength alone naturally couldn't face the cooperation of all of the others.

As such, Wan Tongtian said to Wang Wuxie, “Brother Wang, you are the official host here. Are you not going to say something?”

Wang Wuxie didn’t actually care. Either way, the Righteous Sun Sect was the strongest. However, seeing as the majority supported an examination, he didn’t want to make them all upset. Furthermore, Li Changsheng was also in support of an examination. Li Changsheng was an elder of the White Jade Sect, and he was also Yan Xuehen’s senior. In Wang Wuxie’s mind, his will naturally represented Yan Xuehen’s will.

As such, he said with a smile, “Seeing as everyone feels like there should be an examination, I do not think there is any harm in it either. Sect Master Wan, Elder Huo Ling, there is no need for the two of you to be worried. We are all people with our own pride. We would not be so corrupt as to desire your treasures in front of so many disciples’ faces.”

Wan Tongtian’s expression darkened when he heard that. Sigh, as expected. As such, he secretly asked Elder Huo Ling, “Junior Sister, should we just let them examine it? Either way, we’re here; if they really want to pull something, it won’t be too late for us to fall out then.”

Elder Huo Ling looked extremely unhappy. Even though she was normally rather irritable in temper, she wasn’t the type to be completely devoid of logic. She knew that at the moment, because of the difference in strength, there would be no benefits for Jadefall Palace if things really turned sour.

Still, she felt that it would be really humiliating if she really let them examine that object. Her disciple had won against a representative disciple, and yet what she had obtained wasn’t glory; instead, she had only encountered doubts.

…

While they were stuck in a dilemma, a cold voice suddenly called out, “None of you seemed to have asked me for my opinion.”

The spectators followed the source of the sound and saw Zu An. At that moment, he seemed to be harboring some kind of hidden rage.

When she heard Zu An speak, the previously apprehensive Pei Mianman smiled sweetly. But she quickly began to worry again. After all, the ones here were all sect masters! Even though Ah Zu is strong, he’s still too young compared to them…

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “I was just about to say… That womanizer of yours definitely wouldn’t give up the chance to be a hero.”

Qiu Honglei was worried that her master would get upset, so she quickly said, “I only admire him more for that. Even if the world is against him, he’ll still protect his women.”

“Are you really not jealous at all?” Yun Jianyue asked, looking at her in shock.

“What do I have to be jealous about?” Qiu Honglei replied, her eyes sparkling. “In my eyes, if I were the one on the stage, he would definitely make the whole world his enemy for my sake.”

Yun Jianyue was stunned. She opened her mouth, but didn’t say anything.

Mount Luofu’s Elder Xu harrumphed. “This is our daoist sects’ internal affair. Why would we ask for your opinion?”
