Chapter 1829: Sisters

It was reasonable for Zu An to be shocked. After all, he had imagined all sorts of possibilities, but they were all living things. He had never expected her original body to be a talisman. Then wasn’t she an inanimate object?

Seemingly seeing through his confusion, Jing Teng sorted out her clothes while explaining, “I can’t remember how long this great tomb has existed, but in the past, this entire great tomb sealed all of the monsters here through this great formation. Meanwhile, this talisman is the core of the formation. It can be considered the eye of the formation.

“As something that subdued so many terrifying creatures, it was extremely mysterious in its own right. Just like that, after ages passed, it gradually developed sentience of its own. Then, I was born.”

Zu An suddenly realized what had happened. No wonder she understood this great tomb so well, and yet didn’t know who had built the great tomb or anything more ancient than that. He asked, “So that story about being enlightened from some tree vine was fake?”

Jing Teng was a bit apologetic as she said, “I wasn’t deliberately trying to fool you. At first, I really believed that I was just a vine that Immortal Ruler Baopu enlightened, but later, when I came to this great tomb, I gradually regained some memories.

“In the past, even though I developed sentience, I was still trapped in this great tomb. When that old man Immortal Ruler Baopu barged into the great tomb and accidentally entered the dangerous parts, though, I saved him, and we became friends despite our age difference.”

Zu An had a strange expression.

It’s hard to even say who's older between you and Immortal Ruler Baopu.

His girls really did have a wide age range. There were some who were young ladies in their teens, some women around twenty to thirty, and also…

Hm, I wonder how old big sisters Yun and Yan are.

He had thought that Mi Li was the oldest one, but now, it seemed Jing Teng could be up to par. People said that women are most beautiful at the age of eighteen, but did these madams ripen at eighty-eight thousand? Why did he not feel that eighty-eight thousand was that strange, and yet eighteen felt weirder?

Jing Teng continued, “I learned about a lot of things regarding the human world from Immortal Ruler Baopu, and I had a yearning for it too. So I sometimes snuck out to play. In order to avoid trouble, I just said that I was a vine that the immortal ruler enlightened. Everything was fine at first, until something happened…”

Just then, a sneer came from behind them. “I was wondering what you two were doing. So it turns out this adulterous couple was doing despicable things!”

Zu An was startled. He quickly moved Jing Teng behind him and watched the entrance nervously. Black mist slowly seeped through, with skulls vaguely visible within it. Who else could it be but the Ghost King?

Zu An’s expression was a bit unpleasant. The two of them had been so busy that they actually forgot this great enemy who had been chasing after them.

I will definitely protect Jing Teng!

“Huh?” he exclaimed as he suddenly thought of something.

Why was the Ghost King not affected by the great formation at all? Normally, the formation should have sealed all of the monsters in the great tomb, so the Ghost King should have been suppressed, right?

After all, when Zu An first entered, he had felt as if he were about to be crushed. Even though the Ghost King was stronger than him, it wasn’t to an absurd degree. The Ghost King also had a demonic attribute, which meant it should have been even less likely that they could resist that power. Why did they seem completely fine then?Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Where is the Baopu Sutra?” the Ghost King asked, staring at Jing Teng.

Jing Teng didn’t hide it and admitted frankly, “I gave it to big brother Zu.”

The Ghost King exclaimed furiously, “You actually gave something that precious to him?!”

You have successfully trolled the Ghost King for +444 +444 +444…

“He is my man, so who else would I give it to but him?” Jing Teng retorted, having already sorted out her clothes. She clung to Zu An’s arm and looked at the Ghost King with a taunting expression.

The black mist around the Ghost King’s body flared about chaotically. They had clearly been provoked. They said, “It’s fine. Since I now know where the Baopu Sutra is, then I just need to force it out of him.”

Suddenly, the entire place warped. Roars came from the distance, as if the monsters were about to escape and could arrive at any time. It really was frightening.

Even the Ghost King felt some restraining fear and quickly said, “You damn brat, hand it over and this king can let you off. I can even let the women upstairs go.”

Zu An sneered and retorted, “I’m not someone who’s used to placing my fate in the hands of another.”

“Hmph, your knowledge is limited, so this king won’t lower myself to your level,” the Ghost King sneered. “I believe you must have seen those terrifying beings on your way here. The seal on this great tomb is about to collapse, so if you stall for time and they break free, you two will undoubtedly die even if this king doesn’t do a thing to you.”

Zu An’s expression changed, because he knew that the Ghost King was telling the truth. If even a single one of these monsters got out, forget about them, even the Ghost King could die. However, there was no way he would just hand over the Baopu Sutra.

While he was feeling conflicted, Jing Teng suddenly sighed and looked at the Ghost King, asking, “Just why do you want the Baopu Sutra so badly in the first place?”

“The path of immortal ascension, of course. Only after you achieve immortality can you truly transcend,” the Ghost King said proudly. Then, they snapped impatiently, “Stop wasting time. I can let you keep a copy for yourself, but that’s as far as I’m willing to compromise.”

Roars came from the distance from time to time. All sorts of terrifying auras were starting to awaken. Zu An could sense all that too, and knew he couldn't waste any more time.

“Do you think you can transcend just from achieving immortality?” Jing Teng retorted, laughing in ridicule. “Do you know why I drew you all the way here?”

The black mist around the Ghost King trembled. They replied, “Are you trying to use this great demon-suppressing formation against me? Unfortunately, you’ll be disappointed. For some reason, this king doesn’t seem to need to fear this thing.”

Jing Teng looked at the Ghost King with a strange expression and replied, “Could it be that you haven’t realized why yet?”

“This king did lose some of my memories when I fled this great tomb. However, you can forget about trying to shake my will with something like that,” the Ghost King said with a sneer.

Jing Teng was a bit speechless. She pointed at the distant talisman and said. “Look over there.”

“You’re using such childish tactics…” the Ghost King began, but still couldn't help but glance in that direction. Their voice came to a screeching halt, and the figure in the black mist also began to tremble intensely.

When he saw that the Ghost King was preoccupied, Zu An saw a rare chance. He was about to attack when Jing Teng stopped him. He looked at her in confusion.

“No, no, how could this be…” the Ghost King murmured while trembling. Even though they didn’t have a body, the black mist seemed to have condensed into arms clutching their head.

“Don’t forget your mission,” Jing Teng said with a sigh. She pointed her finger toward the distant formation core talisman. The talisman shone with yellow radiance, as if it had come alive. A streak of light shone on the Ghost King, who immediately began to howl in pain.

Zu An was overjoyed. If this great formation could deal with the Ghost King, that would be the best result! He wouldn’t need to fight to the death anymore. However, Jing Teng’s reaction was a bit strange.

Under the radiance of that light, the Ghost King’s black mist rapidly shrank. The black skulls fragmented and disappeared. Eventually, the endless black mist grew smaller and smaller, thinner and thinner. Then, it ultimately became about the size of a person.

Zu An was startled. Was this the Ghost King’s original body? He wondered just what kind of monster they were.

The mist grew fainter, then all dispersed, turning into a set of black clothes. The Ghost King’s true appearance was revealed.

Zu An’s eyes practically popped out of their sockets. If the Ghost King had been one of those disgusting monsters he had seen on the floors above or something else, he wouldn't have found it strange at all. However, the Ghost King was actually a woman, and an extremely beautiful woman. No less!

That alone was still understandable, as there were many pretty women in the world. Zu An had seen his fair share himself. The real reason he was shocked was because she looked identical to Jing Teng!

No, upon closer inspection, there was still a difference. Jing Teng was dressed in white, while this one was dressed in black. Furthermore, their expressions were a bit different. Jing Teng was cool and elegant, while this black-clad woman was fierce and treacherous. Even if he didn’t know the two of them, he would still subconsciously feel closer to the white Jing Teng’s side.

“Just what is going on?” Zu An asked, full of questions.

Jing Teng sighed, then explained, “Didn’t I say that this talisman was quite mysterious? As a long time passed, it gradually developed a will of its own, which was me. When I was born, I was full of curiosity toward everything, so I often snuck out to play in the outside world. Of course, I knew the risks of that and left half of my power to continue the operation of this great formation, so nothing bad would happen to this great tomb.”

“However, what I didn’t expect was that once I left, some terrifying beings in the tomb obtained an opportunity. They tried to corrupt this talisman with their evil powers. Even though they failed, their sinister energy spurred the existence of another me, which is her, my little sister.”

Jing Teng looked directly at the Ghost King as she spoke.

“Who is your little sister?!” the Ghost King exclaimed, her expression unpleasant. Even though many of her memories had just returned, she still found it a bit hard to accept.

It wasn’t just her, even Zu An was being tossed and turned in this storm! The Ghost King was actually Jing Teng’s twin sister?!
