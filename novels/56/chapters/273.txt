Chapter 273: Aren’t We Buddies Already?

Translator: Pika

Chu Chuyan was left speechless.

Why did the words from this guy’s mouth always sound so strange?

But she couldn’t muster a proper retort, since she really did have to take off her clothes in order for her to be treated.

She turned around bitterly. Her clothes slowly slid down her silky skin, revealing a stunningly snow-white landscape that would make any man go crazy.

Zu An was mildly vexed. This won’t do. I gotta tell her I have to treat her from the front next time. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

He held back this time, not wanting to scare her away by being overly hasty.

He struggled fiercely to hold back a nosebleed as he completed the night’s treatment.

Chu Chuyan thanked him with a reddened face. Then, she firmly chased him out of her room.

“Who treats their benefactors like this?” Zu An snorted in displeasure as he left her residence.

At the same time, he glanced down at his unsatisfied little bro. This cannot continue! I’ll get sick at this rate!

What was that saying again? Unsatisfied and undeveloped?

He mumbled to himself in annoyance the whole way back to his own room. A sudden tremor rocked his mindscape. He leaped to the side to dodge the attack aimed at him from behind the door.

“Oh? Not bad. You’ve improved from yesterday.” Flirtatious laughter came from behind the door.

Zu An tracked the source of the sound and saw Pei Mianman leaning against the door, an ambiguous smile on her face.

Her laughter made great waves ripple across her magnificent chest.

Pei Mianman snorted. “Eyes up here,” she commanded, noticing his expression. With a flick of her wrist, her fine white hand stabbed towards him.

Zu An jumped back in fright. “Aren’t we buddies already? You don’t have to react like this just because I stared for a little too long, do you?”

The tender expression on Pei Mianman’s beautiful face immediately grew frosty, and her playful eyes glinted coldly with a hint of killing intent.

Alarm bells rang in Zu An’s mind. I don’t think she got my joke.

He didn’t dare let his guard down. His hand immediately moved towards his Tai’e Sword.

Before his sword had even left the scabbard, Pei Mianman was already upon him, shoving his sword back into the scabbard with one hand.

With her free hand, she seized the opportunity to attack him.

If this were any other time, Zu An would have definitely spent some time complimenting this exquisite hand, perhaps even stroking it a little.

But the crazy strength displayed by that hand horrified him. There was no trace of charm or gentleness at all!

He tried backpedaling to evade her, but she doggedly kept on him, not allowing him to put any distance between them.

Zu An had invested everything into his sword techniques, and his unarmed combat skills were lackluster. Without a sword, he could only fight on instinct.

Scant seconds had passed, but several blows from her fist had already peppered his body. If not for Zu An’s greatly increased cultivation and the Primordial Origin Sutra’s tempering of his body, he might have suffered serious injury, and blood would have been pouring out of his mouth. He would certainly have lost most of his fighting strength.

Even so, any sane person would get worked up after being attacked like this.

His opponent’s sudden and unreasonable attacks had already stoked his ire.

He immediately executed the modified Sunflower Phantasm, and his body suddenly split into two identical copies.

Pei Mianman was thrown off. She clearly hadn’t expected this.

Her hand accelerated, stiffened fingers landing a perfect strike on the acupoint on Zu An’s chest. However, she felt no joy at all. The empty sensation that fed back to her from her fingers told her that she missed.

Sure enough, the ‘Zu An’ she had struck scattered into countless fragments of light and shadow.

She was visibly shaken. She was just about to dodge to the side, when she suddenly felt something cold pressed against her neck. A sword was already resting on her shoulder.

“What’s wrong with you? Do you accept defeat?”

Zu An had noticed that even though her blows looked heavy, she wasn’t utilizing all of her strength. Since she was holding back, he wouldn’t go too far either.

“You’re no fun at all. Fine, I lose~”

As soon as she said the word ‘lose’, she suddenly twisted her body. Like a beautiful snake, she slipped away from him and sent a blow flying towards him.

Zu An’s eyes widened with alarm. He instinctively stepped backwards, but it was already too late.

He felt his wrist go numb, and he lost his hold on the Tai’e Sword.

As the Tai’e Sword clattered to the ground, Pei Mianman dodged around him, instantly grabbing Zu An’s arm and twisting it behind his back.

The tips of her toes struck him behind his knees. Unable to remain standing, Zu An found himself forced into a kneeling position.

Pei Mianman twisted his arm further, her knee pressing none too gently against his back. “So? Do you accept your defeat?” She whispered, her warm breath tickling his ear.

“I accept... my ass!” Zu An roared. He twisted his body forcefully. His shoulder dislocated with a loud crack, and he was free of her hold.

Pei Mianman hadn’t expected him to be so tenacious. Her face turned pale, her hands instinctively loosening their grip on him.

Zu An already prepared his follow-up moves. He pounced like a furious lion, instantly pushing her down.

Pei Mianman tried to dodge, but her legs were kicked out from under her, and she lost her balance. She fell unsteadily to the ground.

Zu An felt no hesitation this time. He pressed down on her with his weight, and employed the techniques of Brazilian jiu jitsu from his previous world to force her into a submission hold.

Pei Mianman struggled fiercely, but she was unable to exert most of her strength in her current position.

This again... Pei Mianman curled her lips in a snarl, and decided to give up on her struggle.

The two of them had yet to be acquainted with each other the last time they had fought. Back then, he had also managed to immobilize her with a similar move.

Zu An was gasping for breath. He’d expended a tremendous amount of strength in a sudden burst, and he felt more tired than if he had run three kilometers in his previous world.

“Woman, you admit defeat?”

“I admit defeat, I admit defeat.” Pei Mianman shot him a look of annoyance. “Big guy, you have to teach me this later.”

Zu An didn’t dare let his guard down after the painful lesson he just learned. He didn’t release her just yet. “What the heck were you trying to do? Why did you suddenly attack me?” he asked.

“It was mainly to train your reaction speed. Aren’t you being targeted by that Chen Xuan right now? As a friend, I feel compelled to help you out with your training,” replied Pei Mianman. Her peach-blossom eyes almost seemed to whisper to him, glittering with unspoken mirth. She seemed not to be taking any of this to heart.

“Is that really the only reason?” Zu An was a bit skeptical.

“You can’t blame me for having some selfish motives. I wanted to test you out for myself. I wanted to see just what sort of skills you had that gave you your usual confidence,” Pei Mianman said plainly.

Zu An turned her words over in his mind. He was actually already eighty percent convinced. Even though this lass had attacked him quite fiercely, she didn’t seem to really want him dead. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have subconsciously let go of him when he had painfully dislocated his own shoulder.

Pei Mianman’s annoyance bubbled over when she saw that he was making no move to release her. “Get off me already! Does it feel that good to rub against your wife’s close friend like this?”

It would have been better if she’d left her second sentence unsaid. Zu An was already in an irritable mood after leaving Chu Chuyan’s room.

These ambiguous words stoked something within him, and his entire body went rigid.

“What is that prodding at me?” Pei Mianman’s brow furrowed. “Who knew a brat like you would fiddle around with secret weapons! So, you really did have some more tricks up your sleeve.”

Zu An’s face turned red. What was he supposed to say? He remained quiet.

Pei Mianman turned around, and her charming face went bright red as well. How could she not figure out what had just happened?

“Damn brat, get off me right now or I’ll burn you down!” Pei Mianman said, biting down on her lip. A small black flame burst into life, flickering just above her finger.

Zu An had just been about to release her. However, her threatening tone caused his stubborn nature to flare up immediately.

“No way! If you have the skill, then go ahead and burn me up! Even before I die, I’ll drag you down with me. Dying together as lovebirds doesn’t seem so bad!” Worried that she might escape, Zu An tightened his hold on her.

“You... scoundrel!” Pei Mianman began to panic at the sudden increase in force.

She couldn’t just burn him down over some small matter like this, right? Honestly though, I’ll burn him to death if he keeps doing stuff like this, even if he’s Chuyan’s husband!

Pei Mianman continued to draw these lines in her mind.

Zu An grew extremely amused by the sight of this usually flirtatious and charming woman becoming so flustered.

He carefully examined the girl beneath him, noticing a faint blush spreading across her beautiful snow-white face. This sort of bashfulness really couldn’t be faked.

Something stirred within him. He lowered his head and gave her cheek a quick kiss.

“Ah!!!” Pei Mianman was startled. She clearly hadn’t expected him to do such a thing.

Her entire body trembled. The black flame on her fingertip flickered violently and went out.

Her breathing became slightly ragged, and her peach-blossom eyes began to tear up slightly.

Zu An was given a fright. Why was her body this sensitive?

A strange silence fell across the room, punctuated by the gentle panting of the two occupants.

It lasted a few moments before Pei Mianman finally calmed down. Messy hair was plastered on her face, hiding her current expression. “Get off!”

Zu An had begun to regret his impulsive action. Guilt-ridden, he released her and got up in a flustered manner.

“Just now, I...” Zu An was just about to apologize, but he was wailing in anguish inside. What was the use of an apology now?

Who would’ve expected Pei Mianman to cut him off immediately?

“I was merely testing you to see what level you are at. Your movement techniques and sword skills aren’t bad, but your hand to hand combat skills are poor. I’ll teach you the Entangling Feathersilk Art so that you still have a way to protect yourself against Chen Xuan in situations where you can’t use your sword.”

Zu An blinked. Are we just going to pretend nothing happened?

Pei Mianman grew annoyed at his blank and unresponsive stare. “Are you listening?!”

You have successfully trolled Pei Mianman for 111 Rage points!

Zu An gulped. “I heard you. But just now...”

“There are no buts. Nothing at all happened just now. The things I am teaching you today... you cannot reveal them to Chu Chuyan either, understand?” Pei Mianman stared at him, her eyes full of admonishment.

“Understood!” Zu An’s attitude changed straight away. Since she didn’t want to mention what had happened, then he wouldn’t continue to flog a dead horse. Either way... he wasn’t the one losing out.

“Watch carefully. I’m only going to show this to you once! If you don’t pay attention then that’s on you!” Pei Mianman blushed slightly. She was clearly trying to deceive herself with her earlier words.
