Chapter 1661: Moving Through the Night

The others were shocked. They all looked at Yun Jianyue with ill expressions. They had felt that Peng Wuyan’s style wasn’t quite like that of the daoist sects from the very start. Could it be…

Zu An also looked at Peng Wuyan in shock. No wonder he’d always had a familiar feeling! Could this really be the one he knew? He stared at the woman’s face, but he didn’t see anything strange.

Yun Jianyue was also surprised, but she remained calm. She said, “Twenty years ago, we discovered a group of Devil Sect disciples wandering around Emptiness Isle, so we eliminated them and found a blade. It was none other than this Moon Demon Blade.” Ding Tianle had gone missing over a century ago, and the blade had never made another appearance. Couldn't she make up whatever story she wanted?

Sure enough, the others clearly loosened up when they heard her reply. They all said in praise, “Elder Peng is a heroic woman, as expected. The Devil Sect’s villains ought to all be eliminated!”

Yun Jianyue narrowed her eyes. She engraved those words firmly in her heart. She planned to pay them back later.

Wang Wuxie frowned, but he couldn't find any proof either. He could only say, “Lady Peng is quite fierce and doesn’t seem to resemble a member of the righteous sects. It might be because of this demonic blade’s influence. As she is an inheritor of a daoist sect, using a weapon from the Devil Sect might draw scorn if news gets out.”

Zu An said with a chuckle, “I don’t share that sentiment. Whether or not a blade is demonic or not depends on the user. It has nothing to do with the weapon itself. Blades are used to kill, so what’s the difference between the daoist sects’ and the Devil Sect’s blades? The Devil Sect stole the daoist sects’ weapons to bring chaos to the innocent. Could it be that the same weapon would thus become evil? On the contrary, if the orthodox faction were to use a demonic blade in a righteous manner, helping the dying and healing the injured, that blade would no longer be a demonic blade.”

Yan Xuehen nodded to herself. This kid does have some knowledge. He isn’t someone who only knew how to womanize.

Yun Jianyue and Qiu Honglei had even bigger smiles on their faces. This little rascal really is a good match for us.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Wang Wuxie wasn’t pleased at all. He said seriously, “This blade is different from a normal blade; it was the Great Demon Ding Tianle’s blade. Who knows how much blood it has shed over the years? Together with it being a heaven-grade weapon, it already has a spirit soul of its own and can imperceptibly influence the user’s will. Martial niece Peng’s ruthlessness in her fights is likely a sign of that.”

The other sect masters nodded. That was indeed a possibility.

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “Our Emptiness Isle naturally has a way of dealing with this demonic nature. I do not need Brother Wang to worry about it.”

Wang Wuxie wanted to say something else, but Yun Jianyue couldn't help but say with a sneer, “What is it? Could it be that Brother Wang can’t take a loss either, and is coming up with some excuse to invalidate a match?”

Wang Wuxie’s expression changed. As the other party had brought that up, what else could he say? He was the State Teacher, the current number one person among the nine sects. Furthermore, Yan Xuehen was even still watching from the side. How could he do the same thing as the other sect leaders?

“I was merely worried that martial niece might head down the wrong path. As Emptiness Isle is aware of this matter already, I will not say anything else,” Wang Wuxie said calmly. Then, he congratulated Emptiness Isle for winning.

The other sect leaders all inwardly admired his temperament.

The general assembly quickly scattered. The sects’ disciples all passionately discussed the results of the battle. This was the first time they had witnessed Peng Wuyan’s real strength. She wasn’t inferior to Wu Xiaofan and Wan Guiyi! Her victory wasn’t a fluke the way many people had been thinking.

Yun Jianyue and QIu Honglei had been discussing whether to privately seek out Zu An. After all, there was only one final round left, so the effects of being exposed wouldn’t be as severe as before. However, the sects all came to curry favor with them, making it so that the two didn’t have any freedom to move around at all. They could only put on fake smiles and deal with them.

…

Zu An descended from Golden Peak, then found a chance to look for Yan Xuehen. However, as soon as he got closer, he saw the white-clad Yan Xuehen walk out.

“Shush! Chuyan is meditating inside. Don’t disturb her,” Yan Xuehen said. It was almost as if she had already been waiting inside for a long time and only came out when she sensed his arrival.

“Oh,” Zu An said. He couldn't help but become a bit curious. “Just when is her match with the Devil Sect’s Saintess?”

The battles here were wrapping up, but he hadn’t seen Qiu Honglei anywhere. Only Chu Chuyan was here, cultivating bitterly alone. He had heard them discuss that only if Chuyan won would she have the right to enter the secret dungeon. Now, the other thirteen spots had already been decided.

“A few days later. Normally, they would already be here, but I don’t know why I still haven’t seen any sign of them yet,” Yan Xuehen said. She was also a bit curious.

Zu An was surprised. He asked, “The fight will take place here? But there are daoist sect experts everywhere here! Won’t they be ripped apart by these people?”

Yan Xuehen rolled her eyes and retorted, “So you still have a brain in that head of yours after all, remembering that these are daoist sect members! Do you think we’d do things like the Devil Sect? Regardless, I still respect that witch a bit. She actually dared to propose holding the battle here. That level of courage is something few men from the righteous sects can compare with.”

Zu An was surprised. He asked, “It was big sis Yun who suggested doing the fight here?”

“Of course. Both sides discussed the location of the fight several times before, but neither side was satisfied. Eventually, that witch said we might as well just hold it in our own dao rite, so the matter was decided just like that,” Yan Xuehen said. “But don’t worry. We already sent people to investigate the area to make sure that there are no Devil Sect movements. I believe that she’s just doing this to raise her prestige in the Devil Sect. But as the righteous faction, how can we allow her to carry out her schemes as she wishes?”

Zu An frowned. He just felt that Yun Jianyue wouldn’t be that reckless. The Twin Dragon Mountain rebel army he encountered had received news to move in this direction, so there was definitely some kind of plan being carried out. However, he just didn’t have enough information to make any judgments. For now, he’d just wait until he could contact Yun Jianyue, and ask her directly then.

…

Violet Mountain was full of disciples. Even if the two of them tried to take more secluded paths, it would still be hard to not draw attention. As such, Yan Xuehen had Zu An take the lead while she followed far behind. That way, no one would see the two of them walk together and carry any suspicions.

Zu An thought, This woman really knows how to carry herself like a celebrity. Still, he was the one asking her for help, so he couldn't really say anything. Thus, he walked ahead by himself. He could hear the ‘Fairy Yan’ greetings in the distance and thought, Her reputation among the daoist sects really is high.

Eventually, they finally arrived at the back half of the mountain, where there were fewer people. Zu An found a secluded place and took out the Wind Fire Wheels. He gestured toward her and said, “We have to hurry. We won’t make it in time if we dilly-dally.”

Yan Xuehen’s face reddened as she replied, “I can fly myself.” She had needed him to carry her on his back when she was injured, and the two of them had flown on the Wind Fire Wheels just like that. She naturally couldn't go through that again.

Zu An retracted his hand with regret. He had just offered out of habit. To be honest, though, he really missed the feeling of her soft waist.

The two rushed into the sky and headed toward Yi City. Along the way, Zu An tried to start some idle conversation, but Yan Xuehen’s expression remained cold as she said, “I am just helping you with a business deal. There is nothing else I have to discuss with you.”

Zu An’s expression darkened. He replied, “We were clearly already friends on the Fiend races’ side, so why do I feel as if we’re getting further and further apart?”

Yan Xuehen said, “Our status dooms us to never be suitable as friends.”

Zu An opened his mouth, but he didn’t know what to say either. Just like that, the two of them entered an awkward silence.

…

By the time they arrived outside Yi Commandery, the sky was already starting to grow dark.

Zu An found a place to land and said, “Let’s change clothes here first.” He didn’t move away, and began to change right there and then.

Yan Xuehen’s heartbeat quickened. She turned to one side.

“Are you not going to change?” Zu An asked, not moving. “Aren’t you worried that King Yan Manor’s people will find out that the White Jade Sect’s Master Yan is here?”

Yan Xuehen was left in a difficult situation. She said, “I didn’t bring anything.” She did have some clothes in her storage pouch, but the style was too obvious. They would immediately know that it was her even if she changed.

Zu An now remembered that with her personality, there was usually no need for her to do anything secretive at all. He took out a set of black clothes and gave it to her, saying, “I have some. You should change into them on your own.”

Yan Xuehen received them. When she saw the black color, she felt an instinctive dislike. Then, she suddenly asked, “Why do you always have female clothing on you?”

Zu An replied, “I know what you’re like; it was obviously prepared for you.”

Yan Xuehen’s ice-cold lips couldn't help but curl into a grin when she heard that. She quickly took the clothes and hid in the trees, saying, “You're dead if you try to peep on me with your soul sense!”

Zu An replied helplessly, “You’re already a grandmaster, so you can clearly shield yourself with a soul barrier.”

Yan Xuehen was alarmed. Why did I suddenly overlook that? She quickly changed clothes and emerged.

Zu An’s eyes couldn't help but light up. A goddess was a goddess! Even in all-black stealth wear, it didn’t cover up her beauty at all. On the contrary, it further accentuated her figure in a way that her white clothes didn’t.

Yan Xuehen felt really uncomfortable. She was about to say something when she suddenly saw a beautiful figure next to Zu An. Her expression changed as she asked, “Tell me, how did you change her clothes?”
