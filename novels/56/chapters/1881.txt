Chapter 1830: Saving the World

Zu An couldn't help but ask in confusion, “Didn’t she pretend to be Zang Ao to approach you and try to start a relationship with you?”

And yet in the end, after all that, it was just your sister? What kind of weird fetish is this now?

Jing Teng replied, “In the past, when her will was born, she also grew more and more curious about the outside world. However, unlike the past me who only had curiosity and came back after playing around for a bit, she was corroded by the great tomb’s sinister energy and always wanted to be completely free from this great tomb.

“Eventually, she finally obtained the opportunity. When I left, she completely broke free from our original body and fled this great tomb, abandoning her responsibility as the seal of this place. As she completely severed her connection, she was seriously injured and she lost a portion of her memories. Even her body started to change in strange ways.

“When I found out about it, I tried to find her, and had no choice but to leave the tomb too. My memories were also severely damaged at the time. Even though I knew that I clearly had something I really had to do, it was only recently that I gradually recovered my memories.”

Zu An suddenly realized what was happening. No wonder she had instinctively gotten closer to Zang Ao. Apart from Immortal Ruler Baopu’s damned prophecy, it was likely due to the two of them being sisters too.

As for the Ghost King, even though she had lost her memories, she had also been unknowingly looking for Jing Teng the entire time, because she could sense that Jing Teng had something she needed.

All that could be said was that everything had actually been secretly arranged by fate.

The Ghost King said with a cold snort, “Please don’t act like such a noble and lofty person. What right do you have to claim that your leaving was just out of curiosity, while mine was evil?”

Jing Teng replied, “That’s because my trips were always very short, and I still firmly remembered my responsibility. Every time I came back, I continued to maintain the seal, but you wanted to fully break free from it all…”

“F*ck the responsibility!” the Ghost King interrupted her. “Just how many years have we guarded this damn tomb for already? It’s been so long that I can’t even remember anymore. Prisoners usually have a limited sentence, but what about us? We can only remain in the depths of this gloomy great tomb and spend time senselessly without any end in sight. I’ve had enough of this kind of life!” She paused for a moment, then said to Jing Teng with a sneer, “Don’t tell me you haven’t had enough of it yourself. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have secretly snuck out to play.”

Jing Teng became quiet. A while later, she said, “You’re right. I didn’t like that kind of life that much. Still, I’ve always remembered my responsibility. If this place is abandoned and the seal on these monsters breaks, and they flee, the people will suffer a terrible tragedy. This entire world might be destroyed.”

“What does that have to do with me? Either way, I don’t know any of those ant-like humans. As long as I can live a good life, who cares what happens to everything else?” the Ghost King said with a sneer, feeling that Jing Teng was being too pedantic.𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Zu An now more or less understood the situation. Even though these two had both developed sentience and emerged from the talisman, their worldviews were entirely different. Jing Teng was more upright and cared for the fate of mankind, while the Ghost King cared more about self-preservation.

Strictly speaking, it was hard to say who was right and who was wrong. It all depended on perspective. However, with Zu An’s upbringing and lifestyle growing up, he naturally leaned closer to Jing Teng’s side.

“Even so, you can’t be so selfish! If we leave, this talisman will quickly break down and the formation that’s suppressing these devils won’t be able to operate anymore. All of these terrifying beings in the great tomb will wake up soon!” Jing Teng exclaimed urgently. The great tomb’s seal was clearly at risk of breaking down at any moment.

“If I’m selfish, what do we call those guys who forced us to spend such a meaningless eternity here?” the Ghost King sneered. “Besides, they’re nowhere to be seen and don’t even care about us anymore. Why do we still have to bother with the formation? After hundreds of thousands of years, have we still not given up enough?”

Zu An was startled. He gave the delicate Jing Teng a look and thought to himself, So her age was already in the hundreds of thousands… Then, who are these other people the Ghost King is talking about?

“They must have their own worries, or maybe they encountered something they couldn’t solve,” Jing Teng said with a dejected expression.

“Enough! You’re always fixated on thinking about others. When have you ever thought about yourself?” the Ghost King retorted with a mocking expression. “You can be kind and all on your own, but don’t drag me into it. I don’t want any part in that.”

Jing Teng was dazed. Could it be that she really had been carried away by wishful thinking?

Just then, the Ghost King gave Zu An a look of disdain and remarked, “Did you sleep with that damn kid just now?”

You have successfully trolled the Ghost King for +666 +666 +666…

Jing Teng’s face became red again. She asked, “What does that have to do with you?”

“Not much, really. It’s just that the thought of you looking like me and touching him all over disgusts me,” the Ghost King replied, making a retching motion.

“What do you mean, looking like you?” Jing Teng retorted in embarrassment. “I don’t look like you! This is my body! What does it have to do with you?”

“It’s your fault for looking exactly the same as me. Who knows whether he was thinking about me when he was harassing you? Maybe he decided to get revenge that way because he can’t win against me… Ugh, it’s gross just thinking about it,” the Ghost King grumbled, holding her elbows with a look of disgust.

Zu An and Jing Teng were speechless.

Jing Teng couldn't help but give Zu An a glance. A trace of redness flashed across her face as she asked, “Big brother Zu, would you do something like that?”

Zu An was stunned. He gave the Ghost King an annoyed glare and snapped, “I had no idea that you two looked the same, so how could I have done something like that?”

The Ghost King sneered, retorting, “You might not have known before, but now you do. Who knows what might happen in the future?”

Zu An was speechless. He replied, “You’re overthinking things. A woman like you who's covered in skulls and hides in black mist, and even devours the bloody hearts of others, isn’t my type at all. How are you like Teng’er at all?”

The Ghost King exclaimed furiously, “What did you say?!”

You have successfully trolled the Ghost King for +444 +444 +444…

Her second-most hated thing in the world was being compared to her big sister, and the first was others saying she was worse.

Zu An gave her an annoyed look and remarked, “After living for so long and growing old, I guess your hearing isn’t so good now.”

The Ghost King roared in rage, “This king will kill you!”

You have successfully trolled the Ghost King for +601 +601 +601…

As soon as she spoke, a burst of visible sound waves appeared behind her as she rushed at Zu An. She already knew that Zu An had ways of dealing with soul attacks; this time, though, she wasn’t using the Demonic Voice of the Ghost King as an area of effect attack, but rather focusing on him alone. Its power thus became many times greater than before.

As for Jing Teng, she wasn’t all that worried. It was difficult for anyone to hurt her with the demon-subduing great formation in place.

When he sensed that terrifying demonic voice, Zu An’s expression changed. He was just about to summon Hundredwarble when he felt a warm feeling emanating from his chest. The Violet-Gold Alms from before flew above him and cast down a field of gentle golden light. Some buddha projections manifested around it, chanting profound sutras in a low voice. When that terrifying demonic voice reached him, it was instantly deflected by the buddha radiance.

The Ghost King choked. She cursed, “That damn monk fooled me! He even gave you his precious treasure!” She realized that the Demonic Voice of the Ghost King wouldn’t do anything anymore. Her figure flickered and she attacked Zu An directly.

However, Zu An had already prepared for her attack ahead of time. When he saw that, he drew the Tai’e Sword, and both sides exchanged more than ten blows in an instant.

Now that the Ghost King had taken human form, she was much easier to deal with. After all, that half-physical, half-intangible body really was hard to attack.

Just then, Jing Teng seized the chance to get in between the two of them, saying, “Little sister, let’s not fight anymore.”

“Don’t call me little sister. It sounds disgusting,” the Ghost King said, although she stopped. She thought, This Zu An brat really is slippery. It won’t be easy to take him down quickly.

“But you are my little sister,” JIng Teng said with an apologetic expression. “If not for the fact that I just wanted to have fun and gave those monsters an opportunity, you wouldn’t have been tainted by their evil energy.”

“What evil energy? With this demon-suppressing great formation here, what demon could possibly taint me?” the Ghost King replied proudly. “It’s just that their interests happened to align with mine.”

As if responding to what she said, the entire place trembled violently. Endless sinister laughter, furious roars, and low growls emerged from the distance.

Jing Teng’s expression changed. She looked at the divine talisman.

Zu An noticed that the constellations in the sky were beginning to fall, and those that remained above flickered, as if they could go out at any time.

Jing Teng quickly said to the Ghost King, “Little sister, let’s go back. Otherwise, without us, the demon-suppressing talisman won’t have enough power to maintain this seal anymore. If this place fully collapses, everything will be over!”

The Ghost King retorted with a sneer, “Just what made you feel as if I would agree to go back to that talisman with you? How great is my life right now, living carefree every day? Why would I go back and suffer?” Sensing that Jing Teng was about to keep trying to persuade her, she continued, “If you pity mankind so much, why don’t you sacrifice yourself to save them? Why do you want me to go with you? What else can this be but hypocrisy?”

Zu An’s expression changed. He grabbed Jing Teng’s arm and asked, “Will you die if you return to the talisman?”

Jing Teng didn’t answer; instead, she said gently, “I’ve already been away from the talisman for so many years after being born. That’s actually already a great blessing for me. Besides, I even met you. This lifetime was already incredible, so I have no regrets left.”

When he heard her say that, Zu An’s heart gradually sank.
