Chapter 1773: Order for Arrest

Phoenix Chick returned in high spirits. He had successfully baited Jing Teng over, and the two ghosts had already set up all sorts of traps. Everything was going as smoothly as they had planned.

They couldn't touch Jing Teng, but the other woman was also really pretty. There was no discrimination when it came to beauty, after all. When one was that beautiful, even ghosts would be tempted.

He had been feeling wonderful, but when he came back and saw the scene before him, he was completely stupefied. Shouldn’t it be Hidden Dragon interrogating the pretty boy while he weeps bitter tears? Why is it now the other way around?

However, his absent-mindedness only lasted for a second. He quickly let out a strange scream, and four bony claws emerged from his body as he rushed at his enemy. Strange wails and howls surrounded him. As one of the eight ghost generals, his strength was naturally not to be underestimated.

A phoenix vaguely manifested in the air. However, it didn’t have the slightest bit of flesh on its body, and was made up entirely of bone. It was surrounded by a wicked aura.

Zu An thought, This guy’s original form really was a phoenix? Then was Hidden Dragon originally a dragon? Why would legendary beasts like phoenixes and dragons become malicious spirits after their death?

He cultivated skills related to the phoenix himself, so he quickly sensed that something wasn’t right. This ghost didn’t have a pure phoenix bloodline, and was just a distant relative of the phoenix.

Jing Teng, Qiu Honglei, and Wei Suo had also arrived just then. When they found out what was going on, they had all been shocked, feeling that the entire situation was a bit unrealistic. After all, with how high Zu An’s cultivation was, why had he been captured?

They had only planned to come over and take a look at what was going on, but as soon as Phoenix Chick attacked, the surging ghost energy made it hard for them to even breathe. Such an ambush could really put Zu An in danger!

They instinctively moved to help him, but they quickly fell into the formations Phoenix Chick and Hidden Dragon had set up. Even though they could still easily protect themselves with their cultivation, they still couldn't break free immediately.

Phoenix Chick laughed nastily. Now that those people were trapped and couldn't help, he could deal with that pretty boy in the shortest amount of time first. Then, he would deal with them after.

Honestly though, what the hell is going on with that idiot Hidden Dragon? Don’t tell me there’s some unknown presence hiding in the shadows? Or maybe that slow idiot ended up being tricked by that human?

He still couldn't sense even the slightest bit of energy coming from Zu An’s body. That was why he was completely baffled. Still, he intended to just deal with them all first, then ask his companion about it after.

Suddenly, a resplendent streak of sword radiance appeared. It was clearly not dark yet, but Phoenix Chick saw what appeared to be a river of stars. In that instant, he finally understood why Hidden Dragon had ended up the way he did. This seemingly helpless pretty boy was actually a terrifying expert!Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Still, why wasn’t there the slightest ki fluctuation coming out from his body? How was that fair at all?! Additionally, the aura of that sword was absolutely fatal to all ghosts!

He was filled with regret, but it was already too late. When the sword radiance swept past, the world faded away to nothing.

When Zu An used his sword, however, his restriction on Hidden Dragon loosened slightly. Hidden Dragon was full of resentment, so when he got the chance, he roared and bit down toward Zu An with his fangs.

“Be careful!” Qiu Honglei and the others cried out. The attack’s power was definitely extraordinary, and Hidden Dragon was attacking from such a close distance. Even a grandmaster would find it difficult to deal with.

Hidden Dragon suddenly saw the resplendent sword light and was completely stunned. He had still been upset moments before, believing that Zu An had taken advantage of his carelessness. But now, he knew that this pretty boy was a tiger pretending to be a pig! He reflexively gave up on his attack and immediately ran. Unfortunately, the dazzling celestial stream seemed practically intelligent. It passed over all of his defensive formations and stabbed straight into his body.

He could feel his very being melting away. His final thoughts were filled with endless regret. Why had he been so obsessed with this damn mission? Both he and Phoenix Chick had extraordinary status. Even among the eight great ghost generals, they were powerful beings. They also had long lifespans and could have lived an incredibly comfortable life…

Zu An pulled back his Tai’e Sword. He was actually a bit regretful, thinking he should have left them alive to get more intelligence about the Ghost King. Unfortunately, everything had happened too suddenly. Phoenix Chick was quite strong, and Hidden Dragon had acted at the same time. That was why he had also instinctively attacked.

Hidden Dragon was skilled in all sorts of formations, and Phoenix Chick definitely had special skills too. If they were allowed to use them, the others could be put in danger.

Fortunately, the Kun Peng and Heavenly Devouring Sutra activated their effects. He could feel the two ghost generals’ bodies turning into a form of pure energy that flowed into his body. The experience bar that hadn’t moved at all for a long time finally made a breakthrough. It went straight to Level 71, and even moved a bit further.

Zu An had a strange impression when he saw his strength increase. These two ghost generals were quite strong. If not for the fact that his skills just happened to counter them, victory wouldn’t have been so easy.

After Hidden Dragon’s death, his formations also disappeared. Qiu Honglei and the others broke free and quickly rushed over. Qiu Honglei asked, “Ah Zu, are you okay?”

“I’m fine,” Zu An said, patting her hand.

“You actually killed both Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick, two ghost generals, with a single slash of your sword?” Jing Teng exclaimed, her expression strange.

She had seen him use his skills along the way, but it seemed he had still been holding back then. The great generals Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick were famous, and they were among the stronger of the eight generals. However, even those two powerful beings weren’t a match for even a single slash? Her heart had begun to beat faster when she saw that brilliant sword. He was indeed a bit handsome…

“It’s just that they were a bit too strong, so I had to treat them more seriously,” Zu An said, chuckling in embarrassment.

…

All across the Yin Yang world, the other ghost generals of the various regions all shivered. They were also ghost generals, so they had a special connection to each other. Just then, they had sensed the deaths of their companions.

“Who could have actually killed Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick?!”

The eight ghost generals didn’t particularly get along and actually carried grudges against each other. However, their companions had just been killed by an outsider, leaving them shocked and scared. After all, someone who could kill Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick could very well harm them too.

Roars resounded all over the Yin Yang Realm. All the ordinary ghosts shook all over and didn’t dare to even breathe heavily for fear of accidentally angering the great ones above them.

Suddenly, a black fog appeared above the ghost generals’ heads. The ghosts all bowed and said, “We greet the Ghost King!”

“I am already aware of what happened to Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick. The one who killed them was a human,” the Ghost King said. His real body didn’t come out of the black fog, and only his voice emerged.

“Which human could kill those two? Could it be that the sect master of the Divine Firmament Sect was revived? Or maybe the Adventurer’s Guild Master personally interfered?” a ferocious-looking ghost general roared.

“The one who killed them is this person,” the Ghost King said. The black fog changed and produced an image. It was none other than Zu An.

Ghost generals all had special seals placed on them, causing the moment before their death to be transmitted back to the bone tiles in the Ghost King Palace. That way, the Ghost King would be able to find out who killed them. It was just that that function was used rarely. After all, ghost generals were all powerful beings. Deaths among them were most often because of internal conflict. The fact that two of them had been killed by a human really was shocking.

“Who is this person? He doesn’t seem to be one of the famous experts of the human world.”

“That’s right! He doesn’t even look that special.”

“He’s so young, and he looks so weak!”

…

Several grotesquely-shaped ghost generals discussed among themselves.

“This person is none other than one of the targets from before. He is right by Jing Teng’s side,” the Ghost King said again.

The other ghost generals immediately erupted into a commotion. They all volunteered to take Zu An’s head and get revenge for Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick.

The Ghost King continued, “That person’s skills seem to be specialized for dealing with ghosts.”

When they heard that, the eager ghost generals immediately wilted. They had thought that Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick had been muddle-headed and gotten schemed against, but it was actually because that human’s techniques were special! If he could kill Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick, then he could naturally kill them too. Who wanted to throw their lives away for nothing?

“Then, perhaps your respected self should act personally? No matter how strong he is, he still isn’t your respected self’s match, right?” a ghost general proposed.

The other ghost generals all had the same thought. If the Ghost King were also defeated somehow, wouldn’t they have a chance of fighting over the position of Ghost King? They knew that the chances of that happening were far, far too low though.

The Ghost King said, “I still have more pressing matters that keep me from leaving. You will also follow me, as I am in need of helpers.”

As soon as he said that, the ghost generals mysteriously sensed a direction. The Ghost King was summoning them. They were shocked. They had never expected the powerful Ghost King to need help! They wondered just what sort of difficult situation they were dealing with.

“Are we really just going to let that human go after he killed Hidden Dragon and Phoenix Chick?” a ghost general asked in dissatisfaction. He was rather close to those two, and now that they had died, he felt quite awful.

“Do not worry. I have already issued a bounty request to the human world. With enough rewards, there will always be brave men,” the Ghost King said with a sneer. “Normal ghosts might fear his special skills, but humans will not!”
