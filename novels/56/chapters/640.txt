Chapter 625: Different Means, Same Result

Translator: Pika

Of course, she knew that he was deliberately teasing her. She said coldly, “Honglei isn’t my private property. I cannot use her in a transaction.”

“I’m not asking you to give her to me like that, I just don’t want you to stop us from getting together.” There were so many shows where annoying clan leaders would get in the way of male and female leads. He didn’t want to go through the same thing.

Yun Jianyue was now really shocked. “Your relationship has already reached that level?”

She was shocked. Looks like she didn’t pay enough attention to her disciple recently. She didn’t expect her to have already liked a man without her notice!

Zu An stuck out his chest. “A man like me who is suave, valiant, confident, distinguished, accomplished... a man among men, what’s so wrong about her liking someone like that?”

Yun Jianyue was speechless when she heard the string of adjectives.

She really wanted to pick up the pillow next to her and plug up his mouth. This guy is just too shameless!

You have successfully trolled Yun Jianyue for +555 +555 +555...

Yun Jianyue took a deep breath to calm herself down. “I won’t interfere with the two of you, but you must promise me that you won’t ruin Honglei’s purity.”

Zu An: “???”

“We’re harmonious lovers. What do you mean ruin her purity?”

Yun Jianyue sneered. “No matter how glib your tongue is, you still cannot change the fate that entangles her.”

Zu An: “......”

Yun Jianyue continued, “Honglei’s cultivation method is special. She cannot lose her virginity before she reaches a high level of cultivation, or else her dao will be ruined and she will even suffer a backlash. She will become a slave to her desires.”

Zu An immediately became upset. “What kind of stupid technique is that? How can this world have such a ridiculous method?”

Yun Jianyue gave him an indifferent look. “Why can’t there be? Isn’t this the technique I cultivate?”

Zu An gave her a stupefied look. So that’s the reason why you’re still unmarried...

Yun Jianye wasn’t all that embarrassed and began to explain, “The method we cultivate is called ‘Heavenly Devil’s Temptation’. You can probably tell from the name that this is a technique full of charm and allure. You’ve been around Honglei for a while already, so I believe you understand this.”

Zu An nodded. He was indeed stunned by Qiu Honglei when he met her. His first reaction was that he wanted to take her to bed. He wasn’t someone who didn’t have beauties around him after all and was good at retaining his composure. The other men in Immortal Abode were completely enchanted.

Yun Jianyue continued, “Once she reaches a higher level of cultivation, she will be destroyed by her own desires. If she can remain clear-headed throughout the entire process, then she can reach the highest level of Heavenly Devil’s Temptation. If she fails before then, not only will her cultivation regress significantly, she will suffer a severe rebound and go crazy whenever she sees another man. Since the two of you are already a couple, I do not believe you would wish to see that happen.”

Zu An remained silent for a moment. He didn’t wish to see Qiu Honglei become this way!

But he became more and more upset the more he thought about it. “What kind of dogshit technique is this? Aren’t you all the Devil Sect? It’s the freaking Devil Sect, yet you guys care so much about preserving chastity like those orthodox sects. Isn’t the flirtatious and seductive style more fitting?”

Yun Jianyue’s expression was cold. “We are the Holy Sect. Our sect's mission is to bring up everyone and make them equally strong. Devil Sect is a name the court deliberately gave us to slander us.

Zu An didn’t feel like arguing with her over this. “Fine, fine, fine, we’ll call it the Holy Sect if you want. Then couldn’t Honglei choose to not cultivate your stupid technique? I’ll give her something else as compensation.”

He had quite a few techniques on him. He was sure he could find something suitable for her.

Yun Jianyue’s eyes narrowed. “Are you perhaps saying you’ll give her the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra?”

The Devil Sect sent quite a few people to capture him along the way. All of that was for the sake of the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra.

Zu An was about to explain that the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra’s cultivation requirements weren’t suitable for her, but then again there was no need to explain anything. Either way, he had other methods. “So what?”

Yun Jianyue’s expression immediately became brilliant. After thinking for a while, she said, “You really go all out in chasing after girls, huh? No wonder even Honglei was moved by you.”

If she knew it was going to be like this, she wouldn’t have gone through all the trouble. She would’ve just sent Honglei.

When he heard her sigh, Zu An thought to himself, if I can get both of you in a package deal, then it’s not just the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra, I’ll be willing to give you even more! Of course, there was no way he would ever say that out loud.

Yun Jianyue then asked, “Can the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra really grant immortality?”

“Hold on, wait, wait, wait, you’ve already scammed quite a bit of information from me. Are you really going to keep going if I don’t stop you?” Zu An snorted, but he still replied, “The Phoenix Nirvana Sutra’ immortality is merely a fanciful ideal. It cannot be implemented in reality.”

Yun Jianyue’s brows were about to raise again, but she sighed when she heard what he said. “That’s good then, that’s good.”

As long as the emperor couldn’t obtain immortality, then everything else wasn’t an issue.

She didn’t suspect Zu An of deceiving her. She already deduced that there was no way the emperor would let Zu An go if the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra could really grant immortality.

She thus continued, “I will thank you in Honglei’s place ahead of time. Unfortunately, the Heavenly Devil’s Temptation is rather special. Once cultivated, it cannot be stopped unless one reaches my level.”

“Isn’t your technique a scam then?” Zu An stormed over angrily. He suddenly thought of something and asked, “How old are you?” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Yun Jianyue raised her brows. “Are you tired of living?”

Zu An’s mind jumped. Even though the other party was seriously injured, the pressure he felt still left him stunned. He now knew that since he showed her mercy by the rock garden, he would never have another chance to win against her again.

Thus, he quickly said, “It’s not that I want to know your age, I just want to know how many years it’ll take for Honglei to reach your level. I need to know that at least, right?”

Yun Jianyue harrumphed. “If you really love her, then who cares how long it will take? If you cannot wait that long, then that means you never loved her. This is a good thing for her as well.”

Zu An gave her a look full of pity. “You’ve never fallen in love before, right?”

Yun Jianyue erupted with fury at once. “Are you courting death?”

Zu An wrinkled his nose and said, “Only someone who never dated would use such childish tactics. Things like feelings... they often crumble before the face of testing.”

Yun Jianyue’s face heated up. She indeed didn’t have much experience in this field, but there was no way she would admit that. “Hmph! I’ve walked on more bridges than you’ve walked roads. Do you really think you understand anything better than me?”

Zu An knew that she was starting to feel embarrassed, so he didn’t tease her anymore. “Alright, remember your promise. I’ll find your medicine, and you’ll agree to our relationship.”

Yun Jianyue frowned. “Where are you going to look?”

Zu An said, “The imperial hospital of course. There are so many renowned physicians and expensive medicines. Who knows, your stuff might be there.”

Yun Jianyue’s eyes lit up. Even though this fella spoke a lot of nonsense, he really hit the nail on the head this time. This might really work.

“You should just stay here and not wander around. Wait for me to come back.” Zu An was worried and warned again.

“Okay.” Yun Jianyue subconsciously replied, but she frowned soon afterwards. Why did she feel like a young married woman waiting for her husband to return?

She shook her head and quickly tossed out this thought.

Zu An cursed the entire way to the hospital. I’m probably the only decent man out there. If any other dude encountered a stunning goddess who hit rock bottom, they would definitely use the chance to go crazy on her!

...

Meanwhile, the bearded left guard general had just left the Palace of Peace. The subordinate waiting outside said, “General, is there any new information?”

Cheng Xiong’s face was overcast. “It was too messy back then and the empress was quite frightened. She cannot remember the details too clearly. It looks like we have to go through other means.”

His subordinates were all horrified. The emperor flew into a terrible rage this time and put them in charge of looking into the empress’ assassination.

However, it was this place that experienced danger first. By the time the eastern palace was also in chaos, the assassins on this side already all ran away, while those who weren’t able to get away ended their own lives. They couldn’t find a single person to interrogate.

While he was at his wits end, Cheng Xiong suddenly said, “We’ll pay the imperial hospital a visit. If there are still assassins in the palace, then they will need medicine for treatment. They might target the hospital.”

The others were all overjoyed. “Our general is wise!”
