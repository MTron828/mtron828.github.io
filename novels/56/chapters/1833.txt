Chapter 1782: Fighting Side by Side

The scar-faced leader and the feminine vice-leader led their subordinates to surround Chu Chuyan again. They laughed sinisterly and said, “Little girl, that pretty boy is so scared for his life that he abandoned you. Your choice of men doesn’t seem to be all that brilliant.”

Chu Chuyan harrumphed. “Hmph, how could someone so cowardly be my man? If my man were here, why would he need to run?!” Her voice was full of regret. It would have been fine if she hadn’t been discovered. Perhaps she would have even found Ah Zu, too.

“This girl really knows how to shoot her mouth off! But I promise that our men here are more formidable. Why don’t you give us a try?” the scar-faced leader remarked, blowing a wolf whistle. The other mercenaries immediately roared with laughter.

After experiencing a bloody battle, it was now time for their harvest. This woman really was too beautiful. Even though she had killed quite a few of their brothers, they still found it hard to kill her.

When she saw the looks in their eyes, Chu Chuyan’s expression was completely cold. She knew there was no way to mediate the situation anymore. If she ended up in their hands, she would definitely come to a bitter end. A hint of resolve appeared on her face. She gripped her sword in both hands, and a blizzard began forming all around her.

The leader and vice leader's expressions changed. They cried, “Everyone, retreat!”

They were experienced in battle and could naturally sense the destructive power contained within. They naturally understood that such power couldn't appear out of thin air, and that it was definitely some kind of forbidden technique. The price of using such a skill was often one’s very life. This woman clearly intended to take all of them down with her.

They sighed when they looked at that beautiful face, thinking, What a pity!

Chu Chuyan’s gaze was completely cold. In the past, when her cultivation was lower, she had already been able to use a forbidden technique to destroy the giant Kun whale. Now that her cultivation had advanced leaps and bounds, the power she could wield was also far greater than before.

“Goodbye, Ah Zu…” she murmured. She felt a hint of reluctance, but at this point, she no longer had any other way out.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Right when she was about to activate the skill, however, an urgent cry filled her ear. “Don’t be rash!”

Chu Chuyan was alarmed. She recognized this voice. It was actually…!

Suddenly, a beautiful figure rushed toward them. Black flames covered everything in sight, causing many of the Gray Wolf Mercenaries to scream. The flame really was strange; those struck by it were completely unable to put it out. It was as if even their souls were about to be completely burned away.

The leader and the vice-leader's expressions darkened. They quickly killed some of their subordinates who were affected by the flames to end their suffering. Then, the mercenaries turned their attention to the perpetrator.

They could never have expected it to be another woman, and an extremely beautiful one, no less! She wore a red and black dress that was extremely stunning. Her captivating eyes seemed to contain an ambiguous smile that seemed to tug at one’s very soul. However, what drew even more attention was her chest. As she moved, it was as if ocean waves rippled in front of her.

The mercenaries’ eyes widened. Just what kind of blasted luck did they have today? They had actually met another exceptional beauty who was on the same level as the blue-clad woman? However, the leader and vice-leader couldn't bring themselves to feel happy at all. They had just fought a great battle, and after the black-clad woman’s ambush, they had lost close to half their men. The remaining people also carried several wounds.

Chu Chuyan was also a bit dumbstruck. Her gaze was filled with shock and happiness as she cried, “Manman!”

The one who had arrived was none other than Pei Mianman. Chu Chuyan had been looking for her the entire time, but had never expected to reunite in such a situation.

Pei Mianman saw that there was quite a bit of blood on Chuyan’s dress and could imagine just how bitter the earlier battle had been. She couldn't help but sigh, saying, “Silly girl, he would really be broken-hearted if something happened to you.”

Chu Chuyan looked back at her. She suddenly sighed and said, “Actually, you could have interfered a bit later. No one would have blamed you.” The two of them had known each other for a long time. She knew that Pei Mianman wasn’t as sweet and innocent as she looked.

Pei Mianman knew what she meant. She frowned and said, “If it were anyone else, I might really have done that. But you’re different.”

“How am I different?” Chu Chuyan asked, looking at her calmly.

Pei Mianman said with a conflicted expression, “I knew you long before I knew him. And before that, we were best friends, right?”

A smile suddenly appeared on Chu Chuyan’s face. Their personalities were clearly completely different. When they first met each other, they’d both had ulterior motives. But she had to admit that Pei Mianman had been one of her few friends in all these years, someone she could proudly call a best friend to others.

Until that person appeared…

“That’s right, best friends,” the two women said, exchanging a look. For some reason, everything that had happened just disappeared like smoke on the wind.

“Look at how lovely and close the two of you are acting. But neither one of you can even think of leaving today,” the scar-faced leader said angrily. Judging from their conversation, they seemed to actually know each other… and they were fighting over the same man?

Is there something wrong here? These two devastatingly beautiful women actually like the same man? And they’re even putting on this sisterly love drama? Just which man could be this fortunate?

He felt an uncontrollable fire burn within him when he thought about that man.

Why?!

The other mercenaries clearly had similar thoughts. They were still a bit worried about the strength they had lost earlier, but at this point, there was no redeeming the situation.

“These guys were bullying you, right? Let’s just kill them all together,” Pei Mianman said, looking at the people around them coldly. Her lovely gaze was now completely ice-cold.

“Uh… They’re quite strong,” Chu Chuyan replied, unsure what else to say.

She had seen Pei Mianman’s strength for herself on Violet Mountain. Her cultivation had advanced by leaps and bounds, but compared to those representative disciples, she hadn’t had a huge advantage. She had only been able to take the first place in the competition largely because of luck, as well as Zu An’s tricks. Even at her strongest, the two of them wouldn’t necessarily be a match for this mercenary group, let alone now when they were already worn out and tired.

Pei Mianman smiled and said, “Chuyan, I might not be better than you in one-on-one fights, but this kind of chaotic brawl is my strongest suit.”

Previously, in the secret dungeon, she had been the War Goddess Fu Hao! She had endless experience in battle and was used to such messy fights. As soon as she spoke, she activated Fu Hao’s Owl Statue. Everything within a mile was covered in absolute darkness.

“What’s going on?”

“Why did it suddenly become dark?”

“Someone light a fire, hurry!”

…

The Gray Wolf Mercenary Group had clearly begun panicking.

Soon after, someone lit a torch to light the surroundings, but strangely, the light seemed to be swallowed up by the darkness around it. It wasn’t able to illuminate the surroundings at all. Even things like divine sense were limited to a small range. They were practically blind.

Suddenly, those who had started fires screamed one after another. They were clearly attacked by a present in the darkness.

The feminine vice-leader screamed, “Everyone, remain calm! Don’t light a fire and turn yourself into targets!”

The others quickly put out the lights in their hands. They all gripped their weapons while vigilantly defending their surroundings. They were all experienced, after all. Since it was completely dark, the enemy definitely couldn't see either. As long as they didn’t make any sounds, the enemy couldn’t find them either. As long as they defended their area and attacked everything that approached them, they would be invincible.

Unfortunately, they could never have imagined that Pei Mianman was the absolute ruler of this space. She could see everything that was happening inside. She was like an owl, silently reaping the lives of the mercenaries one after another. Her cultivation was quite high to begin with. If one such person with sight fought against the blind, it could only be a one-sided massacre.

When he heard the screams filling the air, the scar-faced leader used all sorts of powerful skills to attack. Unfortunately, how could he possibly hit his enemy by swinging blindly? He was furious. The woman’s cultivation was clearly weaker than his own, and yet now, he was forced into a completely passive state. He felt extremely wronged.

Unfortunately, their group’s runemaster had already been killed by Chu Chuyan. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be so helpless.

One after another, those familiar voices disappeared. The leader’s heart sank. This really was an absolute disaster, and the Gray Wolf Mercenary Group could be completely wiped out. He roared, “Vice-leader, are you dead yet? If not, then come here and we’ll fight back to back!”

“Fine!” a feminine voice replied. The vice-leader knew they couldn’t afford internal strife in such a situation. Thus, he decisively put aside their differences and rushed over. They both brandished their weapons to block the side the other party couldn't defend.

This left Pei Mianman in a difficult position. These two had completely blocked off any holes in each other’s defenses. If she attacked one of them, she would suffer a brutal retaliation from the other. Additionally, their cultivation ranks were higher than her own. If such a situation happened, she could be seriously injured.

She moved to Chu Chuyan’s side and explained the situation. Chu Chuyan quickly replied, “They have two, but don’t we have two as well?”

Pei Mianman’s eyes immediately lit up. The two women held each other’s hands and leaped at their target. Pei Mianman attacked first, and black flames surged.

However, the vice-leader blocked her attack. The scar-faced leader laughed maliciously and said, “I’ve finally caught you!”

He took the precious chance to release a giant wolf, ordering it to bite down on the woman. He no longer entertained lustful thoughts and only wished to kill her as quickly as possible to break out of this situation.

But who could have thought that an extremely cold sword would silently appear, stabbing perfectly into his neck? His head flew into the air, eyes wide with confusion and fear. He had never expected that someone as powerful as himself would actually die so easily.
