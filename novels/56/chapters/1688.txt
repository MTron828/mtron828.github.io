Chapter 1637: Wishes Fulfilled

The Embroidered Envoy had specialized ways of exchanging messages. Lower-level information would be passed along through relay stations or flying pigeons. Meanwhile, Golden Token Envoys could transmit messages through their golden token, which was similar to a pager from Zu An’s previous world. However, there were limitations to that. The first was that the amount of information that could be sent was limited, and the second was that it took a lot of resources to send a message each time. Only extremely urgent reports would be sent through that method.

Zu An looked at the message he had received. Zhang Zitong had sent it to him through Yi Commandery’s Embroidered Envoy channel. Because of Golden Token Seven’s death, coupled with the fact that she had the highest status in Yi Commandery’s Embroidered Envoy system, she had the ability to use it. It was against the rules, but it wasn’t too difficult for her to do.

The message said that they had found out that Sir Huo would leave the manor today. She wanted to take the chance to arrest Sir Huo, then interrogate him about the death of Golden Token Seven. Because they couldn't find Zu An, they could only use such a method to contact him.

Zu An was speechless. He thought to himself, Where did this woman get the confidence to arrest Sir Huo? Didn’t she already suffer enough last time? Still, he realized that it was indeed a good opportunity. After all, Sir Huo had always remained in King Yan Manor without ever coming out. Now, he had finally left, so it was no wonder that Zhang Zitong couldn't hold herself back.

As such, he found Zhang Zijiang and Xie Daoyun to tell them a few things, then secretly left the mountain. After the first day of competition, it was already dark. He wasn’t too scared of people noticing him. As soon as he left Violet Mountain’s territory, he got onto the Wind Fire Wheels to rush toward Yi Commandery.

…

On Violet Mountain, Master Jian Huang opened his eyes. He looked toward a small fiery light departing over the horizon, remarking, “A shooting star approaches the earth, the sign of a big disaster. That day is quickly approaching after all.”

A little baldy stuck his head in from outside, replying, “Sign of big breasts? Master, are you talking about Jadefall Palace’s Lady Pei?”

Master Jian Huang picked up the wooden fish and struck his head, snapping, “Make another hundred copies of the heart sutra as punishment!”

“You were the one who said it…” the little monk Jie Se said, clutching his head and running away while defending himself. However, what he got in return was an even stronger beating.

…

Zu An continued flying. With the Wind Fire Wheels’ speed, he arrived at Yi Commandery soon after. He went directly to the Embroidered Envoy’s secret meeting place, and saw that they were preparing something inside and were about to head out.

However, Zhang Zitong was an exception. She wasn’t dressed in her usual Embroidered Envoy uniform or her all-black garb; instead, she was wearing an extremely revealing outfit. Her legs were in full view, and there was a veil covering her face. Her clothes were covered in sparkling decorations, which made her look like the Western dancers from China that Zu An had seen before. Meanwhile, Xiao Jianren and the other Embroidered Envoys’ eyes couldn't help but dart across Zhang Zitong’s body. Her appearance was clearly quite deadly against them.

Several people inside were startled when they saw Zu An arrive, calling out, “We greet Sir Eleven!”

Zhang Zitong thought to herself, He always comes like a ghost. She wondered just how high his cultivation was.

Zu An gave the entire place a look. He saw that Xiao Jianren and the others looked as if they were ready to go and frowned. Then, he asked Zhang Zitong, “Did you not learn your lesson when you almost lost your life in King Yan Manor?”

Zhang Zitong bit her lip, but her stubborn expression remained as she replied, “I was a bit too reckless last time, but it’s different this time. We can ambush him, seeing as he’s alone. If we miss this chance, who knows how long it will be before any more clues about Sir Seven appear? I was the one who asked them for help, so please don’t blame them, Sir Eleven.”

Zu An said with a snort, “I fought against that Sir Huo before. It doesn’t matter how many you have; you’d just be throwing your lives away.”

Zhang Zitong’s face turned pale. She opened her mouth to defend herself, but she also felt that she couldn't.

Zu An asked, “Where is that Sir Huo going after leaving the manor?”

Zhang Zitong’s expression turned a bit strange. Xiao Jianren helped her by replying, “He’s going to the city’s largest Wishes Fulfilled.”

“Why isn’t he going to the Hub of Freedom?” Zu An asked curiously. Just the name alone sounded like some place for prostitution. However, the best place for that in Yi Commandery was supposed to be none other than the Hub of Freedom. However, he quickly realized that King Yan and Hub of Freedom didn’t seem to really get along. As a follower of King Yan Manor, it made sense for Sir Huo to not go there.

“He hasn’t been doing anything for so long. Why would he suddenly go to Wishes Fulfilled? Is there something wrong here?” Zu An continued. They had spent a lot of effort investigating Sir Huo. If he was a fan of brothels, they would have found that out a long time ago rather than just now, right?

Xiao Jianren sounded a bit upset as he replied, “It’s because that old thing’s preferences are rather special. He likes them a bit y… younger. A batch he likes finally seems to have arrived.”

“Human filth!” Zhang Zitong couldn't help but curse.

Zu An shot Zhang Zitong an angry look and said, “The court clearly prohibits such things. Your Yi Commandery’s Embroidered Envoy dares to play around with these things?”

Zhang Zitong looked a bit ashamed too, replying, “In the past, when Sir Seven was here, there were strict investigations. After Sir Seven passed away, the Embroidered Envoy system slowed down. Furthermore, Wishes Fulfilled has its own backing too…”

Zu An took a deep breath and said, “After we catch that old bastard, this Wishes Fulfilled can just be shut down too.”

“Understood!” Zhang Zitong replied excitedly. With the support of a Golden Token Envoy, they naturally didn’t have to worry so much anymore. After a while, she suddenly realized what he had said and asked, “Is Sir Eleven going to get involved personally?”

Zu An replied impatiently, “If I didn’t, could it be that I’d let one of the court’s glorious Silver Token Envoys impersonate a Western dancer to seduce him?”

Zhang Zitong’s face turned completely red. That had indeed been her plan.

Xiao Jianren immediately sighed in relief, saying, “Things will definitely go smoothly with Sir Eleven here.”

“I don’t want to hear so much flattery. Hurry up and tell me the details.” Zu An harrumphed.

“Let me explain. I know more about Yi Commandery’s situation…” Zhang Zitong said, moving closer to him and opening a map. She explained things in detail. They were so close to each other that Zu An could feel how soft her skin was. The air nearby was filled with her body’s fragrance, too.

Zu An carefully listened to the entire plan, asking some questions about the details. When they were about to leave, he said to Zhang Zitong, “Go and change your clothes. Embroidered Envoys don’t need to sell their bodies to complete their missions.”

Zhang Zitong’s face was a bit red as she replied, “Understood!” She quickly hid inside the room and began to change her clothes. A few minutes later, she came out again, having recovered her usual valiant appearance.

Xiao Jianren and the others were full of admiration. As expected of Sir Eleven! He wasn’t shaken at all even by such temptation, unlike how useless we are.

Under the cover of darkness, the group quickly approached Wishes Fulfilled. The others all got into position, while Zu An silently watched everything from above. Xiao Jianren and Zhang Zitong couldn't sense where he was at all. They once again sighed in admiration at how profound and mysterious he was.

Roughly an hour later, Sir Huo appeared in their field of view. He had clearly deliberately changed his appearance, most likely because he didn’t want King Yan Manor’s people to find out either.

The Embroidered Envoys couldn’t carry out their plan on the main street. After all, a place such as Wishes Fulfilled had people coming and going all around it. It would be practically impossible not to alert them that way.

Just then, Sir Huo arrived at Wishes Fulfilled. Soon after, the brothel madam welcomed him in and invited him to a private room.

“Sir, please wait a bit. Your young lady will be here soon,” the madam said, picking up the silver ingot and leaving happily while shaking her plump bottom.

Sir Huo felt disgusted looking at that. He harrumphed and remarked, “How can a fat woman like that compare to a thin and delicate little girl?”

He couldn't help but lick his lips as he spoke. He took out a pink pill and tossed it into his mouth. Then, he picked up the teacup on his table and finished it in one go. Soon after, he felt a warm feeling spread through his stomach. A satisfied smile appeared on his face. He’d be able to show his manhood to that little girl soon.

However, his expression suddenly changed. He looked at the teacup and exclaimed, “Poison!”

He quickly got up. Suddenly, the window next to him opened and Several Embroidered Envoys rushed in. In an instant, Soul Reaping Chains wrapped around his arms and legs.

Normal Embroidered Envoys would have been useless against someone like Sir Huo. The ones who had come along were Zhang Zitong, Xiao Jianren, and the two other Silver Token Envoys from Yi Commandery. Their cooperation was tightly-knit, and they didn’t even give Sir Huo a moment to respond.

The Embroidered Envo’s Soul Reaping Chains were infamously formidable. If ordinary cultivators were restrained, they wouldn’t be able to use any of their ki. They could only await their fate. Sure enough, Sir Huo’s entire body trembled, and he seemed to grow weak.

Suddenly, however, the patterns on his forehead activated. They almost seemed to have become a living eye.

“Don’t look at his eye!” Zhang Zitong cried out.

However, it was still too late. The four Silver Token Envoys’ expressions immediately lost focus. Just like that, they stood in place rigidly, falling into an illusion.

Sir Huo sneered. He leisurely removed the Soul Reaping Chains around him, then shook his entire body. He opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of tea, forcing out the poison he had just swallowed.

“It’s just some trifling Silver Token Envoys, and yet you actually think you can catch this old one?” he remarked as he walked up to Zhang Zitong. He frowned when he looked at her from up close, saying, “You have some looks, but you’re a bit too old…”

The pink pill he had just taken began to activate. He suddenly licked his lips, saying, “I’ve never tried a Silver Token Envoy before. You have some long and pretty legs, so this old one will make a special exception for you to celebrate this great day.”

He was about to touch her when a mocking voice suddenly called out from behind him, “Do you know? Those who celebrate prematurely have never experienced good consequences.”
