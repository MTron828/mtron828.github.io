Chapter 1788: Reaper of Death

Suddenly, a massive figure appeared in their field of view. Zu An and the others finally saw just what the other people were hiding from.

It was a monster that was four or five stories tall, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws in a way that resembled a giant praying mantis. However, it wasn’t as slender as a praying mantis. Its body was large and sturdy, and its entire body flickered with a metallic glint. If not for its size, Zu An would have thought it resembled the supercars of his previous world. It had many legs, each one covered in sharp barbs. As it moved quickly, stepping on those who had been knocked down in the crowd, its legs passed straight through those people like sharp blades.

All those who could explore the great tomb, even the ones at the outskirts, were well-known figures in the world of warriors. Their bodies were all tough, and several even wore armor to protect themselves. Even so, before those thin legs, their defenses were like paper. Blood immediately splashed everywhere.

Just then, the sound of fluid being sucked up followed. Those with good eyes could see that the victims’ blood was being sucked toward the monster’s legs, then absorbed into its body. The corpses on the ground immediately shriveled up, leaving behind only a layer of skin. The monster was actually sucking away human blood essence! Once the survivors realized that and heard the slurping noises, their scalps turned numb with fear.

Even so, there was no lack of valiant individuals there. When they saw that their companions were being devoured, their eyes also turned red. Many people brandished their weapons at the monster. There were some with stronger cultivations who weren’t willing to run away just like that and give up their chance to explore the tomb, so they also followed and attacked.

Slash! Slash! Slash!

The monster’s feet were especially large, resembling sickle blades. Clouds of bloody mist appeared in their wake, as most of those who charged over were cleaved in half.

Zu An and the others were alarmed, exclaiming, “What fast blades!”

Even with their cultivation, they actually couldn't even see how the monster attacked. It was just too fast. By the time they saw it raise its limbs, it was too late.

Some cultivators who had attacked the monster from behind took the chance to move to its side. They all knew that if the monster turned around and waved those front limbs at all, they would likely be carved into mincemeat. At that point, it was better to take a chance!

They brandished their weapons at the monster’s body. Even if they couldn't survive, taking it down with them wouldn’t be so bad either. However, loud clangs rang out. Those people’s eyes widened, because even their most powerful attacks couldn't break through the monster’s defenses! Their weapons only left some white marks on its body.

They were horrified and wanted to run away. Unfortunately, two giant sickles suddenly appeared before them, and the world turned blood-red.

When they saw the carnage, the survivors’ fighting spirit completely collapsed. They no longer courageously retaliated; instead, they ran while howling for their lives.

Unfortunately, the monster’s limbs were just too long. With just a few steps, it caught up to many of them. What followed was a one-sided slaughter.

Wei Suo suggested, “Let’s use this chance to leave.”

Zu An shook his head and said, “Even though these aren’t really good people, just watching humans be slaughtered without doing a thing would leave me with a guilty conscience.”

Jing Teng looked at him with surprise. This guy was entirely different from the others in this world who only cared about themselves.

Qiu Honglei’s expression grew serious as she said, “But that monster is completely invincible. There’s nothing we can do either…”

This was just a monster from the outer areas of the tomb! Who knew how terrifying the other monsters Immortal Ruler Baopu had locked up were?

Jing Teng quickly said, “This monster’s name is Death Reaper. Its shell is impervious to all attacks beneath divine-grade. Its reaping sickles appear and disappear unpredictably and move as quickly as shooting stars. It isn’t something we can deal with.”

Zu An was a bit surprised, thinking, Doesn’t this woman know a bit too much about the great tomb? However, he said, “Its impervious armor can be dealt with, but its blades are too fast and are simply impossible to guard against.” 

When the group recalled those slashes, they knew that the attacks already exceeded their understanding. Even though Zu An’s body was tough, being instantly cleaved in half still wouldn’t be a good experience.

Qiu Honglei said, “I can use the Wall of Sighs to help you block one attack.”

That was the light element’s most powerful defensive skill, after all.

“Then there’s no problem,” Zu An said, his expression changing. He quickly discussed a plan with her.

The monster had already noticed their group. They had remained in place without scampering off like the other ants, so it was hard to miss them. As such, it brandished its eight long legs and quickly charged over to them. Zu An faced it head-on, using the Grandgale ability and instantly arriving at the monster’s head.

The Death Reaper’s compound eyes moved quickly as it noticed Zu An. Its two sickle blades immediately lashed out, so fast that they were impossible to react to.

Fortunately, Qiu Honglei had just finished her preparations, condensing a Wall of Sighs around Zu An’s body. The monster’s blades struck its surface at almost the same time. The Wall of Sighs, long reputed to be able to block all attacks, instantly shattered.

Still, for better or for worse, it did interrupt the two blades. Before those sickles could move again, Zu An made his move, slashing with the Tai’e Sword. A resplendent streak of sword ki emerged before people’s eyes.

No one present could describe the sword strike with words. There was no lack of experts present, but in that instant, they all felt a sense of powerlessness. It was as if as long as this sword strike appeared, there wouldn’t be even the slightest chance of winning.

The monster’s tough shell didn’t work this time. The endless sword ki directly crushed its head into pieces.

Zu An sighed in relief. The Tai’e Sword was a divine weapon, and together with his own sword ki that carried the conviction of the undefeated, there was no way that shell could block his attack.

Qiu Honglei also had an expression of surprise. She had already dreamed of fighting together with Zu An many times, but she’d never had the chance. Now, her wish was finally fulfilled.

Suddenly, Zu An sensed danger.

“Be careful!” Qiu Honglei cried out in alarm. The monster’s two front limbs had briefly stopped after its head was crushed, but then they suddenly rose again, hacking at Zu An. However, Honglei had already used the Wall of Sighs, so she couldn't use it again for a short time.

Zu An hadn’t expected the attack either, and felt a moment of regret. He had briefly forgotten that insects were different from most animals, and wouldn’t die immediately even without their heads. He didn’t have time to evade anymore and could only brandish the Tai’e Sword to face the attack. Since he couldn't see it, he could only use offense as defense. 

Let’s see which of us dies!

When he thought of its giant front limbs, he wondered if his body that had been tempered through the Primordial Origin Sutra could hold on or not.

Suddenly, a voice quickly chanted, “The valiant should join the ranks of war. The army is to the north; the black tortoise awaits summons!”

Zu An no longer hesitated, raining endless sword ki down onto the monster’s body. Its ruined body was melted by the sword ki, but its front limbs also struck him.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Zu An clenched his teeth and covered his entire body with ki to defend against the damage. To his surprise, however, there was no pain at all. When he looked down, he saw that a suit of tortoiseshell armor surrounded him, perfectly blocking the two blades.

As the monster died, its sickle-like limbs also lost their strength, and Zu An quickly grabbed them.

Death Scythe!

Some words appeared in the keyboard system, as if it recognized the items. Zu An thought to himself, These might be useful, and stored them away in the Brilliant Glass Bead.

Wei Suo couldn't help but exclaim in shock, “Huh? Boss, you actually had such a giant storage item on you?”

The two sickles were several meters long. They weren’t the sort of thing a normal storage pouch could hold.

Zu An chuckled and said, “I just happen to have one.” He looked toward Jing Teng and added, “Thank you for helping me, Miss Jing. Otherwise, I might already have been cleaved in half.”

Even Qiu Honglei gave Jing Teng a grateful look. She didn’t feel any jealousy. In that instant, her heart had almost popped out from fear. Fortunately, Jing Teng had been there to help.

Jing Teng said indifferently, “The young master’s body is as hard as metal. Even without my help, you would only have suffered some injuries. There wouldn’t have been any threat to your life.”

Wei Suo asked in confusion, “How do you know that his body is as hard as metal?”

Qiu Honglei looked at her curiously too. Could it be that Jing Teng knew that Ah Zu cultivated the Primordial Origin Sutra?

Jing Teng’s face turned red, but she reacted quickly too. She quickly explained, “I saw that his skin flowed with light and divinity, and concluded that he must have cultivated a secret technique.”

“So that was it,” Wei Suo and Qiu Honglei said, not suspecting much. Only Jing Teng’s face turned bright red.

The surrounding people all gathered around them as well, thanking Zu An for saving their lives while also asking where they were from. After all, there was no way people like these could be nameless.

Zu An didn’t really wish to get too close to them, so they parted ways after just a few words. The real reason he had saved them was because he wanted to fight. It didn’t have anything to do with them.

“Will we encounter even stronger monsters from here on out?” he then asked Jing Teng. She seemed to know a lot about this great tomb.

“That Death Reaper was already extremely strong. Its power even exceeded that of a grandmaster. I never expected it to be dealt with by you just like that,” Jing Teng said, looking at Zu An with a strange expression. Even though this man’s cultivation wasn’t high, his sword had definitely left her with a deep impression.
