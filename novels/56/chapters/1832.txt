Chapter 1781: Why Isn’t it Like How I Imagined?

The scar-faced leader's eye twitched. This person was the mercenary group’s vice leader. Whether in terms of cultivation or prestige, they weren’t beneath his own at all. It was only because the scar-faced leader had some reservations that he had made sure to transfer him away. Who would have thought that he would return just then?

“Thank goodness our vice leader returned! This slut killed so many of our brothers. We must capture her and f*ck the shit out of her today!” the mercenaries who were closer to the vice leader cried noisily.

Even though the scar-faced leader was a bit unhappy that the vice leader was hinting at his incompetence, now wasn’t the time to act up either. He could only say seriously, “Vice leader, you’ve come at a good time. This woman is full of deceit and has powerful cultivation. We need to work together and not give her any opportunities.”

“Fine. Let’s see which one of us can capture her first,” the feminine-looking man said as he observed Chu Chuyan while clicking his tongue. “What a lovely beauty. Even I’m a bit reluctant to fight against her.” Even though that was what he said, he didn’t hold back at all. His hand shot straight at her vitals.

The scar-faced leader harrumphed and charged as well, not wishing to be outdone. Just now, he had already been greatly humiliated, so of course he couldn't let the vice leader subdue her first.

Chu Chuyan quickly ended up in great danger. The two’s cultivation was even a bit higher than hers. Furthermore, the other mercenaries surrounded her without any trace of an honorable warrior’s pride and fired all sorts of attacks at her. She was quickly hit several times. If not for the fact that her Snowflake Sword was profound and she was able to adapt swiftly, she would likely have already become a corpse.

Even so, she coughed out blood several times. She was like a skiff in a raging sea, about to capsize at a moment’s notice. A hint of despair flashed through her eyes. She hadn’t expected to actually end up dying in this secret dungeon. She wouldn’t have a chance of meeting Ah Zu again.

Suddenly, someone roared furiously, “Absolute nonsense! How can all these grown men bully a single weak woman? Are you all that shameless?!”

A white-clad young master flew over from midair, a fan in hand. He had a confident appearance.

Chu Chuyan was stunned when she saw that, exclaiming, “Rising Sun Prince?”

“Hm? So it was Miss Chu! These people dare bully you? Absolutely preposterous!” the showy and pretentious white-clothed man replied. He was indeed the Rising Sun Prince.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

He had long been waiting for the opportunity he imagined. Previously, when he saw that Chu Chuyan had actually almost broken out of the encirclement through her own strength, he felt as if his heart had been shoved all the way up to his throat. Fortunately, the vice leader had arrived and stopped her.

Chu Chuyan was already at her wits’ end, but the Rising Sun Prince’s fantasy of her being struck flying, upon which he would just catch her, hadn’t happened. However, Protector Sun was getting more and more nervous, and Miss Chu could lose all of her fighting strength if the situation continued. If they didn’t interfere now, the situation would only get worse.

Helpless to do anything else, he could only show himself and save her. In order to make the rescue seem even more amazing and mystical, he pretended to not recognize Chu Chuyan at first and acted as if he just happened to have bumped into her. After Chu Chuyan recognized him, only then would he ‘snap out of it’ and recognize her.

The Gray Wolf Mercenary Group surrounded Chu Chuyan completely. In that instant, they stopped the fight and instead looked toward the uninvited guest.

“Where did this pretentious, white shirt white pants brat come from?”

“Judging from their tone, we should know them? And it’s some prince?”

“Tsk, it’s not as if we haven’t tied up princes before. We’ve even killed kings before.”

“That brat has some pretty nice clothes on him. They should be worth something.”

…

The Rising Sun Prince was about to erupt in anger as he listened to it all. He roared, “You bastards! Do you think you’re acting like real men by ganging up on a woman? If you have the ability, why don’t you send out two people to fight against me and Miss Chu one on one?!”

He suddenly felt really proud of his own intellect. In a situation of despair, they would fight together, shoulder to shoulder, back to back against a powerful foe. Their feelings for each other would definitely skyrocket!

But who would have thought that the mercenary group would roar with laughter?

“Has your brain been trampled into mush? In this world, winning is the most important. Why would we not fight with an advantage and play along with you one on one?”

The Rising Sun Prince’s face darkened when he heard the jeers all around him. He replied, “Whatever! I wanted to fight against you as if I were an ordinary person, but you’ve now forced my hand. Having more people makes you amazing, right?” He clapped his hands and said, “All of you, come out!”

As soon as he said that, people came from all directions. They seemed to have even surrounded the Gray Wolf Mercenary Group. When he saw their expressions change, he felt extremely satisfied, remarking, “Didn’t you all rely on your bigger numbers? It’s our turn this time.”

The vice leader sneered and replied, “Your numbers aren’t enough. And even if you had more, they’d be nothing more than a flock of sheep.”

As soon as he said that, his figure vanished like a ghost. He quickly moved through the surroundings. Just a few moments later, miserable screams continuously filled the air all around the Rising Sun Prince. More than ten people instantly collapsed into pools of blood in the blink of an eye. There was a huge hole in the center of every single one of their bodies. Their hearts had been plucked directly out.

The vice leader's hands were like claws, thin and sharp. They were full of bloody hearts. His mouth suddenly became massive, and he devoured all of the hearts in one gulp. The terrifying sounds of chewing and swallowing filled the air, and the vice leader revealed a look of satisfaction. He said, “Ah… Fresh hearts are truly a delicacy.”

The Rising Sun Prince’s side couldn't help but take a step back. They all thought, Is that person a monster? That’s too scary!

The Gray Wolf Mercenaries laughed nastily. They were all veterans of a hundred battles and didn’t need reminders at all. They tacitly grasped the moment when the opponent’s morale was low and charged forward. Soon after, their weapons moved one after another, reaping lives batch by batch.

The Rising Sun Prince’s expression changed greatly. He thought, How is this possible? Why did these people suddenly become so strong? Just now, Chu Chuyan was clearly messing with them all alone. My cultivation and hers should be about the same! Furthermore, there are a few experts in our group too, so why is it so one-sided?

The scar-faced leader crushed two guards’ skulls bare-handedly. As if seeing through his thoughts, he laughed cruelly and said, “So it really was a pampered prince. He thought that strength was the same as cultivation! They have the same cultivation, but this woman is countless times stronger than all of you guys.

“Furthermore, we were holding back a bit because she was just too beautiful. But for a group of ugly clowns like you? We don’t have any interest in men, so why would we hold ourselves back?”

He wasn’t giving that response entirely to show off, but rather because he wanted to seize every chance to beat down the enemy’s morale. After all, some of these people’s cultivations weren’t that bad. With the enemy’s numbers, the mercenaries would definitely suffer quite a few casualties if they fought it out.

Sure enough, the Rising Sun Prince’s side was already filled with terror. When they heard those words, their morale was completely crushed. Their strength was reduced by half, as they were consumed by thoughts of how to save their own hides and looking for opportunities to run.

Even though there were a few, such as Protector Sun, who were fighting with all their might, as well as Chu Chuyan providing assistance, it couldn't compensate for their side’s crushed morale. The battlefield soon became a one-sided slaughter. The Gray Wolf Mercenary Group’s cruel laughter filled the air, accompanied by screams of fear that came from the Rising Sun Prince’s side.

When he saw the scenes before him, the Rising Sun Prince was completely dumbstruck. Why was this different from what he had imagined? Shouldn’t these mercenaries have immediately felt fear and run when they saw that they were at a disadvantage? Then, shouldn’t they have fled in alarm, letting him save the beauty like a hero and carry her back in his arms?

He looked at the current battlefield. The only thing that he was thankful for was that Protector Sun was still incredibly valiant, already having killed several mercenaries.

Suddenly, however, a giant gray wolf shadow appeared behind Protector Sun. It opened its ferocious mouth. When it closed again, Protector Sun’s head was already gone. Protector Sun’s body instinctively brandished its weapon to kill the enemies around him, but without his head, he could only crash to the ground again after a few steps.

The gray wolf projection turned into the scar-faced leader. He looked at the headless corpse on the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood-mixed spit, saying, “Pah, this dog killed so many of our brothers. He was a professional. Thank goodness we dealt with him.”

The Rising Sun Prince was stunned.  He had never expected that his most powerful ally would die so casually! He was now a bit regretful. He felt that he should have fought by Protector Sun’s side, as he would have been able to cover his back then. Protector Sun wouldn’t have been ambushed so easily.

“Prince, be careful!” In that moment of absentmindedness, Little Sha cried out in alarm by the prince’s ear. He moved in front of the Rising Sun Prince.

Splurt!

Then, his body was cleaved in half. A large clump of brains and intestines spurted all over the Rising Sun Prince’s body. When that happened, he finally broke down. He screamed and immediately turned to run, crying out, “Miss Chu, hold on for a bit longer, I will find others to save you!”

As he had fled, his subordinates were completely defeated too. They couldn't be bothered with the consequences and ran for their lives. The one running at the forefront was none other than Little Zhu.

Chu Chuyan’s expression was completely cold. Actually, she had gained a chance to run away when they joined the fray. But since these people had come to save her, how could she abandon them?

But who would have thought that the Rising Sun Prince would be so useless? They clearly had a good chance, and yet his weakness had caused the situation to turn into a one-sided disaster. Now, she couldn't get away even if she wanted to.
