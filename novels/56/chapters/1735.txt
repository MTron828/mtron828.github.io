Chapter 1684: Did I Come at a Bad Time?

Zu An had already anticipated that he would be asked that question. He replied calmly, “It was thanks to the other Silver Token Envoys’ help that we were barely able to take him down. We lost Tao Qing and Yan Ke, two Silver Token Envoys, in the process. Forgive my boldness for asking this, but I hope your majesty will permit them to join the Hall of Honor and generously console their families.”

Zhao Han remained silent for a long time. He then said, “I will permit it!”

That was tantamount to accepting the explanation. After all, whether it was Zhang Jie or Zu An, they could be considered important in the eyes of ordinary people, but they were both just ants to Zhao Han. He didn’t really care about a battle between ants.

“Thank you, your majesty!” Zu An replied. It was the first time he had thanked the emperor sincerely.

“How is the investigation in Violet Mountain going?” Zhao Han asked.

“I’ve assigned the Armed Escort Division to renovate the mountain while secretly examining potential points of danger. For now, though, everything looks ordinary. The Great Daoist Sects Competition is also nearing its end…” Zu An gave a rough account of what had happened.

“Hmph. Emptiness Isle and Supreme Mystery Cave? Those declining sects were actually still able to produce disciples this excellent? It seems the court has indulged them too much these past few years,” Zhao Han muttered to himself.

Zu An observed a moment of silence for Emptiness Isle and Supreme Mystery Cave, especially Emptiness Isle. It really was a sudden and unexpected disaster! They clearly weren’t that powerful, and yet they had been screwed over by Yun Jianyue.

“What happened with the disappearance of Emptiness Isle’s disciple?” Zhao Han suddenly asked.

“We still don’t know right now. The daoists are currently investigating the situation,” Zu An said. There was naturally no way he would tell the truth.

“You do not have to worry about these things; just remember your mission. As for getting involved randomly in needless things and almost forcing King Yan Manor to rebel, this emperor still has yet to settle that debt with you.”

Zu An cursed inwardly. I was clearly investigating what happened to Golden Token Seven, so what do you mean ‘getting involved randomly’?

“This emperor is already en route to Violet Mountain. Your only job is to keep an eye on Violet Mountain. Don’t create any more side issues,” Zhao Han said coldly.

Even though he could have arrived from the capital to Violet Mountain in an instant using his earth immortal rank strength, this time, he was coming for the Fengshan Ceremony. He had to keep the proper etiquette that was required, so he had to bring most of the procession from the capital with him to Violet Mountain. Along the way, he also had to summon officials from the local regions, and from time to time, he even showed himself to the commoners.

“Understood!” Zu An replied, thinking to himself that he had to let big sis Yun know ahead of time. Otherwise, they would be in danger once Zhao Han came to Violet Mountain.

Before leaving, Zhao Han warned him, “Unless you notice some ridiculous, world-changing conspiracy, do not randomly summon me again! Otherwise, you will have to pay the price with your life!”

It was obvious that after being summoned again and again by Zu An, he was furious.

Zu An wanted to see what Zhao Han looked like when he was this angry. He was sure that it was the same as those old freaks from the Fiend races without much of their lifespan left. They had to spend most of their time in a meditative sleep. Each time he woke up the emperor was equivalent to eating away at his lifespan.

Sigh, I really want to mess with him again… Zu An thought, but he knew that doing so would only cause him to be ripped apart by a furious Zhao Han.

…

After saying his goodbyes to Zhao Han, Zu An entered the prison King Yan was being kept in. King Yan was taking his anger out on a jailer who was bringing his meal. As someone who normally enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, being locked up inside day after day really wasn’t pleasant.

“What seems to be the matter with this king today? Who made you upset?” Zu An asked, walking over with a big smile.

King Yan harrumphed impatiently when he saw Zu An. He snapped, “You are asking a question you already know the answer to!”

Zu An found a chair and sat down in front of King Yan’s bed, saying, “If the king doesn’t wish to cooperate, even if there’s an intent to right your wrongs, there’s nothing that can be done, you know?”

King Yan trembled. His expression immediately changed into a smile as he asked, “Does Sir Eleven have any advice for me?”

Zu An then said unhurriedly, “Over the past few days of investigations, I discovered that there were many suspicious elements to Golden Token Seven’s case, as if someone was deliberately pushing us in your direction. Please think about whether or not you’ve offended anyone. Who would be the most likely to do such a thing?”

“It’s definitely Zhang Jie, it’s definitely him!” King Yan yelled, slamming the table and standing up. “That bastard is full of evil schemes. He bears so much animosity against me and wishes to get rid of me more than anything else. There’s no one else who could do such a thing but him!”

Previously, he had been worried that pointing fingers at Zhang Jie would only have the opposite effect, so he could only hint at it. But when he heard what Sir Eleven said, he wasn’t stupid. He realized that there was something interesting going on and didn’t have such misgivings anymore.

“I indeed found some clues related to him,” Zu An said vaguely.

King Yan was delighted. He said, “If Sir Eleven can help me purge the injustice, King Yan Manor will definitely remember Sir Eleven’s favor.”

Zu An replied coldly, “Why would an official need any favors from you when judging our cases impartially?”RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

This time, he had come precisely to sway King Yan. Zhang Jie was already dead, so it would be a bit too much of a waste to not take advantage of the situation. If he could get King Yan to owe him a favor, they would share some good karma in the future instead. After all, this guy wasn’t all that loyal to the empire. Between that and his relationship with the Devil Sect, he could even be of some use in the future.

“Yes, of course, yes. Sir Zu is impartial and leaves this humble king in admiration,” King Yan said with an apologetic smile. He had felt that the other party was absolutely repulsive before, but now, he actually found Sir Eleven a bit cute.

“But let’s make this clear, this is this and that is that. Golden Token Seven’s death might be unrelated to you, but the things on that account book still need to be investigated to see if there are any issues,” Zu An said. He still had to scare the other party a bit and apply some pressure, after all. He couldn't let King Yan feel as if he had gotten away too easily.

Sure enough, King Yan’s expression changed, but he reacted quickly too and said, “Those things were definitely set up to frame me by that bastard Zhang Jie. I believe that Sir Eleven’s eyes are as bright as a torch and will definitely be able to uncover the truth.”

Zu An nodded in satisfaction. By letting him out this way, King Yan would really think that he was doing him a favor.

…

After arranging things in Yi City, Zu An planned to return to Violet Mountain. However, he wondered where Yun Jianyue had gone.

While he was sitting in his room in a daze, a sweet voice suddenly spoke by his ear. “Which girl is this handsome big brother thinking about now?”

When he heard the familiar yet unfamiliar voice, Zu An was happy and surprised. He looked in its direction and saw an exceptionally beautiful young lady by the windowsill. Her eyes were sparkling, and she was beaming widely. She had beautiful features and fair skin, and her lips were full and rosy. Even though she was just a beautiful young lady on the outside, she was full of a charm and allure that didn’t match her age at all.

“Honglei!” Zu An exclaimed, not having expected to reunite with her here. He had heard that she was sent out on a mission from Yun Jianyue. He rushed straight to the windowsill and immediately took her into his arms. The two of them had really spent more time apart than together.

Qiu Honglei was also really moved. She had been able to recognize Zu An at Violet Mountain, and yet he hadn’t been able to do the same. That had made her miss him more and more.

As the two of them tightly embraced each other and shared their pent-up emotions, they eventually kissed. After all, before this, apart from that last step, the two of them had already done pretty much everything. They were already extremely familiar with each other’s bodies.

While the two of them were kissing passionately, a light cough suddenly came from off to the side. A voice called out, “Did I come at a bad time?”
