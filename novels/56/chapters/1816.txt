Chapter 1765: Sect Master Records

Tens of thousands of miles away, Zu An’s group had stopped for some rest in a beaten-down tavern after tossing its boss and his workers into the firewood room. The group had stopped to stay the night, but upon seeing Qiu Honglei and Jing Teng’s beauty, the boss and his men had drugged their meals and attempted to steal their women and their wealth.

However, Zu An was immune to poison, and furthermore, as a member of the Devil Sect, Qiu Honglei was thoroughly experienced. They had immediately sensed that something was off. When they saw the scheme fail, the boss and his men had decided to just attack, but they hadn’t expected such dainty-looking women to be so strong and were all quickly slaughtered.

Zu An’s group was exhausted from their journey. Wei Suo, in particular, had been hanging by a thread after vomiting day after day. They had decided to just stay for a few days to rest and recuperate.

“Sigh, every single store seems to be a rotten one. We basically haven’t met a single good person on the way here. This world is just too terrifying,” Qiu Honglei said with a sigh, leaning against Zu An in her room.

“That’s how people are here. That’s why there are monsters roaming around this world,” Zu An said, thinking back to Jing Teng’s introduction of this world. At the time, he hadn’t really understood, but he really sympathized after what they had gone through day after day.

“Ah Zu, I’m worried about my master. I wonder how she’s doing right now,” Qiu Honglei said, her eyes filled with worry.

“What’s there to worry about? Your master’s cultivation is so powerful, and she has so much experience in the world of warriors. She’s definitely fine,” Zu An said. He gently sorted out her scattered hair, but he was also a bit worried inside.

Yun Jianyue and Yan Xuehen were both powerful even among grandmasters. Furthermore, they had always roamed the world and experienced life in the wilderness. They would definitely have no difficulty protecting themselves. Comparatively, Zu An was more worried about Xie Daoyun. Back then, when she was sucked into the black hole, he had seen her rush in to save them.

That little lady came from a large clan and had been raised as a precious daughter. Violet Mountain was her first excursion far away from home. She was as pure and innocent as a white sheet of paper. Even though her cultivation wasn’t that low, the people of this world were all treacherous. An attack out in the open was much easier to avoid than a hidden one, after all…

Unfortunately, there was no way for him to know where she was, so he couldn't help her even if he wanted to. He could only pray that just like him, she had either Yun Jianyue or Yan Xuehen with her.

The two chatted for a while longer. Qiu Honglei gradually fell asleep as Zu An comforted her, and he gently pulled the covers over her. Even while asleep, Qiu Honglei’s face was perfect without a single flaw. Her skin was fair and her lips were cherry red. Her brows were fine and her nose was pretty. It really made one wonder just how many blessings could be concentrated in a single person…

At any other time, perhaps Zu An would even feel something stir within him. However, this world was fraught with danger. Not only did they not know what they would face up ahead, he had to worry about the others too. He really couldn't bring himself to have any other thoughts.

After keeping her company for a while, he silently left. He closed the door and was about to go next door to his own room, when he suddenly noticed that Jing Teng was sitting on the other side of the roof. The moonlight that normally seemed to scatter impartially across the world almost seemed to be gathering around her, granting her a faint glow. Upon closer inspection, it seemed as if some sparkling motes of light were entering her body. Then, some dark things emerged from her.

Zu An was a bit surprised. It was rumored that some supernatural beings could absorb the natural essence of the sun and moon. Today, he had actually personally witnessed such a thing.

Jing Teng stared at Zu An with her large and beautiful eyes. She asked with a grin, “Why aren’t you sleeping together with your girlfriend? I’ve never seen a beauty as incredible as Miss Qiu. Her entire body seems to emanate a kind of charm at the highest level. To be honest, even a woman like me feels a bit tempted.”

Zu An said with a frown, “The two of us are in a pure relationship and respect each other’s boundaries. It’s nothing like the random thoughts you’re having.”Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Jing Teng exclaimed in shock, “Who would have thought that a pervert like you would actually have a gentlemanly side to you?”

Zu An’s forehead darkened. He replied, “Did I do something to you or something? How did I suddenly become a pervert?”

“I believe you know the truth,” Jing Teng said. She harrumphed and didn’t pay him any more attention. She leaped down from another room, then slammed her own door shut.

Zu An was left in a mental storm all alone. Wasn’t that just an illusion? Why is she still bothered by it?

…

Meanwhile, In Wang Port…

Xie Daoyun and Yun Jianyue left the master’s chambers. They bumped into the waiting Wang Neishi.

When he saw the two of them, Wang Neishi was clearly shocked. He asked, “You two succeeded in your transaction with my father?”

“That’s right. Thank you for introducing us, second young master,” Xie Daoyun said, showing him a gentle smile.

“Of course; that was only proper to do!” Wang Neishi replied, although he looked disappointed. He had thought that the time for him to be the ultimate savior was about to arrive, upon which they would naturally devote their entire lives to him…

After a while, he said, “Ladies, please rest in the manor for a few days. My father and I need to leave for a few days, and we can help you once we return.”

Yun Jianyue was a bit surprised. The talisman Wang Youjun had used clearly hadn’t made any sound, and yet every single person across all of Wang Port seemed to have been contacted. The rune talismans of this world were truly quite incredible.

Xie Daoyun replied, “There’s no need. We need to travel with your esteemed father.”

“You two are going too?” Wang Neishi asked, now truly shocked. He suddenly remembered that his father had been lacking a key figure for the mission and asked, “Could it be that you are that individual, someone proficient in formations?” 

When he saw her nod, Wang Neishi immediately had a conflicted look on his face.  If she has so much skill, father probably won’t let me randomly play around with her…

However, he quickly changed his mind. Only a woman with both talent and looks is worthy of me! Maybe I should just ask for her hand in marriage!

As for whether or not she would accept, he didn’t even think about it. There wasn’t a single woman in this world who could refuse the Wang clan, let alone someone as elegant and poised as himself.

…

Soon after, the group arrived next to the Wang clan’s dock. There was a large ship there. Whether in terms of the scale or the complexity of the runes around the ship, both far exceeded Wang Neishi’s boat from before.

Meanwhile, several dozen people had gathered next to the dock. Xie Daoyun was quite shocked, because they all had high cultivation ranks. Her own cultivation was only around the middle of the pack here. There were even a few whose cultivation ranks were close to big sister Yun’s! 

As expected of one of the most influential clans, the Wang clan!

Just what is Wang Youjun planning on doing? He actually felt that such a large group of experts still wasn’t enough, so he needs the two of us?

Wang Youjun swept his gaze over the area before saying, “Everyone is here. Depart!”

The large ship set sail. Several Wang clan experts took out their rune talismans, and the great ship steadily rose into the air. After ascending, it headed east.

Soon after, Xie Daoyun and Yun Jianyue noticed that the large ship had arrived above the ocean. They could see the worry in each other’s faces. If they remained on the continent, that wouldn’t be too bad. Across the sea, though, there was nowhere for them to stand on. If they had a falling-out with the Wang clan, even coming back would be difficult. Yun Jianyue couldn’t help but recall Zu An’s ability to control water. If he were at her side, then there wouldn’t be a need to worry about anything…

Shortly after, a massive fish suddenly leaped out of the water surface. It bared its vicious mouth and tried to bite the flying ship. As this world restricted flight, the ship could only fly at a low altitude. With a single leap, the fish could already reach the ship. Its menacing mouth was the size of the whole vessel. If it did bite down, the entire ship would plummet straight into the water.

Yun Jianyue was about to act when light erupted from the flying ship. It turned out the Wang clan experts had already prepared for such an event. They all attacked with their respective skills.

After being hit by so many skills, a burst of blood erupted from the monster. Then, its wounded body fell into the water. Then, the ocean’s surface stirred. It seemed as if other beasts had smelled the blood and rushed over. The giant fish tried to bite the creatures around it. However, how could it resist with its serious injuries?

Soon after, a giant skeleton appeared in the ocean. Xie Daoyun felt her entire body become a bit cold.  If I fell into the ocean, wouldn’t I die without even leaving a corpse behind?

Wang Neishi walked over with a smile and said, “There is no need for you to be scared, little sister Xie. Our Wang clan has so many experts. With our protection, nothing will happen.”

Xie Daoyun couldn't help but roll her eyes. This playboy really knew how to act close. Who’s your little sister?

…

Just like that, they encountered sea monsters several times along the way, but the Wang clan’s people were strong. They killed the monsters almost instantly upon meeting them.

Yun Jianyue was full of admiration when she saw that. The Wang clan is powerful, as expected! The power of this ship’s crew is comparable to our Holy Sect’s upper echelon.

Furthermore, the Wang clan’s people were scattered throughout the world. The ones who had remained in the Wang clan were just a small portion. Judging from that, it was easy to see just how tremendous the Wang clan’s power was.

Just like that, the flying ship flew for more than a day. Suddenly, a blast of mist appeared in front of them. Everything went pitch-black as they arrived at the edge of it.

Wang Youjun sought out Xie Daoyun and asked, “Miss Xie, where do you think we should go from here? We sent many ships to investigate this place before, but none of them returned.”

“This doesn’t seem like a naturally-formed mist, but rather a maze formation someone set up,” Xie Daoyun said. After observing things for a moment, she made some calculations with her fingers. Then, she pointed in a certain direction and continued, “The sky is a road to death. If we want to make it through the fog, we can only go along the ocean’s surface. That’s the path to life. Let’s take a look around after we enter from that side.”

Wang Youjun nodded. With a wave of his hand, the entire flying ship descended back down to the ocean surface. When he saw how Xie Daoyun acted, he felt much more confident, thinking, There might really be a chance of recovering Sun En’s three sect master records this time!
