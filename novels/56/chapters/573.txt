Chapter 562: The Embrace of Death

Translator: Pika

Mosquito Daoist’s entire body trembled, and disbelief was etched all across her face. “This is the legendary transcendent-aptitude blood! Hahaha! Absorbing this might be on par with absorbing the Twelve-Layered Golden Lotus! It seems the heavens have not forsaken me! Today, I am going to completely refine the Golden Lotus with your transcendent-aptitude blood. Once I cultivate the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra as well, no one in this world will be able to stop me!”

Pei Mianman wanted to dash forward to help him, but she was still recovering from Mosquito Daoist’s previous blow, and could not move at all.

Unexpectedly, Zu An’s hands slowly moved upwards, wrapping around the waist of the woman in front of him.

Mosquito Daoist was surprised, but she didn’t mind it much. After all, those whom she preyed on were always weakened and left completely powerless, with no ability to resist.

Mosquito Daoist’s lips spread out in a smile when she considered her prospects. “Hmm? Do you wish to hold me before you die? My body is rather fine, if I do say so myself. Since you’ve given me so much, I guess I can let you get away with this.”

Given her current cultivation, she didn’t even need to use her mouth to suck out his blood essence. Just resting her hand on his shoulder was enough to absorb his blood essence, so talking did not interfere with this process.

Zu An sighed. “It would have been great if you couldn’t speak while sucking my blood.”

Mosquito Daoist’s smile grew wider. “Are you trying to beg for mercy?” she said. “To be honest, you don’t look all that bad. If you’re willing to become my boy toy, I might keep you alive to play around with. Of course, you’ll have to hand over the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra first.”

As she spoke, she deliberately slowed down the rate at which she was absorbing his blood.

Even though she could read his memories by absorbing all of his blood essence and obtain the Phoenix Nirvana Sutra in that way, it wasn’t a hundred percent foolproof. It would be a tragedy if some unexpected mishap occurred and she failed to obtain the entire thing. The best thing for her would still be for Zu An to cooperate willingly.

Zu An sighed. “Even though you aren’t particularly beautiful, I guess your looks are still passable. I’m actually quite an open-minded person, and I don’t really mind if you are some monster girl. If you were some other type of female monster girl, I might just take you up on the offer, but you’re a mosquito monster, so that’s a bit… a bit hard to take in.”

Mosquito Daoist was infuriated by the disdain in his voice. “You’re courting death!”

You have successfully trolled Mosquito Daoist for 1024 Rage points!

Even though her cultivation was profound, she was still a woman. Mocking her in such a way drove her mad beyond belief. She lost all thoughts of trying to subdue his will. All she wanted to do was to suck him dry immediately.

However, she soon found herself rather confused. Why was he still so fleshy? His complexion even seemed to have improved.

She had already lost count of how many experts she had sucked dry. Among them, many had cultivations that were much higher than his. She could suck them dry in just a few heartbeats if she went all out—why did he still look perfectly fine even after she had sucked on him for so long?

She suddenly noticed a strange sensation around her waist. There seemed to be waves of heat spreading out from that area, accompanied by a feeling of numbness. She knew that Zu An’s hands were there, but the touch of a man shouldn’t have been enough to make her feel that way. Was he some aphrodisiac in human form?

She was at a loss as to what to make of it. However, as someone who had been at the top of the food chain for a long time, she was quick to notice that something else was wrong.

She finally realized that her own vitality was leeching out of her from her waist at an alarming rate. There seemed to be a powerful suction force within his palms.

Mosquito Daoist was shocked. “What kind of trick is this?”

Zu An said with a smile, “You’re sucking on me, and I’m sucking on you. We just happen to balance out.”

He had actually planned to do this from the get go. Mosquito Daoist’s cultivation was far stronger than both his and Pei Mianman’s, and they had already fought several intense battles against her before entering the dungeon. She knew the extent of most of his abilities. That was why there was no way for him to match her in a fair fight.

This meant that he had to use the Heaven-Devouring Sutra to see if he could win through cheesing her.

Even though the Heaven-Devouring Sutra could absorb another’s cultivation, it was hard for him to even touch her, given the difference in their cultivations. As such, he figured that he would use himself as bait. That was his only chance to close the distance.

Mosquito Daoist wanted to brush his hands away, yet she discovered that she was completely powerless. Things that were usually incredibly easy for her to do suddenly seemed impossible.

She looked at the man in front of her in horror and said hatefully, “Do you really think that this random absorption ability that you picked up is enough to deal with me? Let’s see who can absorb the other faster, then!”

She was a fiend race monster to begin with, and sucking out blood essence was her innate skill. She had cultivated it for so long that it was her specialty. She obviously wasn’t scared of facing someone when it came to this.

This fella clearly had not known this technique beforehand. She didn’t know where he picked it up, but there was no way he could win out in such a battle.

It didn’t take too long for her confidence to erode, though. It seemed that she just couldn’t get the upper hand.

Of course, it wasn’t that her skills at absorption were inferior to his at all. There was no way that her opponent could win out either.

The two of them were stuck in a stalemate, each one sucking away at the other’s cultivation. Neither side could find an edge.

Zu An grumbled inwardly. After all, this was the first time he was using this Heaven-Devouring Sutra, and he was not at all proficient at it. Just being able to match Mosquito Daoist’s rate of absorption was enough to prove the might of this Heaven Devouring Sutra. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Pei Mianman finally recovered and leaped forward, thrusting her sword at Mosquito Daoist’s back.

Sensing what she was trying to do, Mosquito Daoist did not panic. Instead, she sneered.

Zu An immediately shouted out a warning. “Manman, stop! We are in a strange state of equilibrium right now. Anything that approaches us might be devoured. If you approach, you’ll be instantly sucked dry by the both of us!”

Pei Mianman’s face paled, and she stopped at once. “Then what should I do?”

Zu An frowned. He couldn’t come up with any good ideas either.

Mosquito Daoist said, “Since neither of us can defeat the other, how about we agree to lay down arms?”

Zu An sneered, “Do you take me for a fool? If I stop now, you have a million other ways to kill us.”

He had only managed to fashion this situation by catching her off guard. How was he going to catch her with the Heaven-Devouring Sutra a second time?

Mosquito Daoist smiled. “That’s an easy task. I’ll swear a blood oath.”

Immediately, she intoned, “May the heavens serve as my witness. If I kill the two of you after we agree to lay down arms, I will let you suck me dry and kill me. Is that good enough?”

She sneered secretly as she said this. I’ll just suck you dry without killing you!

Furthermore, with the difference in their cultivations, there was no way she would give him a chance to use his absorption ability again. That way, there would be no way for him to fulfill the second part of the oath of sucking her dry and killing her.

Zu An nodded. “Fine.”

Pei Mianman began to panic. “Ah Zu, that woman is incredibly crafty! You can’t trust her that easily!”

“Oh come on!” Mosquito Daoist smacked her lips. “Do you really want your lover to die alongside me? Perhaps you already have another man in mind? I could tell that you are a fickle woman from the moment I saw your flirtatious eyes.”

Pei Mianman was so angry her entire body was shaking. “You…!”

Zu An interrupted them. “We’ll count to three. We’ll both let go of one hand first, and then let go of the other hand. What do you say?”

“That’s fine!” Mosquito Daoist seemed to have a sly look in her eyes.

“One… Two… Three!”

“Huh? Why didn’t you let go?”

“Hah, brat, you’re quite treacherous yourself. I don’t see you letting go either.”

“But you were the one who made the blood oath.”

“Fine, I will definitely let go this time.”

“One…”

After Zu An said ‘one’, he didn’t continue on any further. Instead he summoned the Tai’e Sword, and activated its unique domain of power!

The Tai’e Sword was a sword that walked the dao of power. He had rarely used this skill ever since he had come into possession of the sword, but always held onto it as one of his final trump cards.

He did not hesitate to bring it out now. The Tai’e Sword’s domain of power erupted at close range.

A draconic cry surged outwards from the sword, and an incomparable aura of domination swept outwards.

Even Pei Mianman was scared witless, and she felt a sudden urge to kneel down.

How could Mosquito Daoist possibly fend off this power under such close range?

Despite her cultivation, she felt a tremor run through her body, and she seemed to have been thrust back to her weakest moments. The moment when she was still a young larva, being chased by other, more terrifying larvae. The moment when she finally turned into a mosquito and took to the air, and instantly had to fend off the vicious dragonflies all around her, the malicious toad tongue, the spiderwebs between the leaves…

In an instant, all of the most terrifying things she encountered in her life filled her mind, and her entire body began to shake.

Zu An used this chance to summon the full might of the Heaven-Devouring Sutra.

His two palms turned into black holes, sucking in Mosquito Daoist’s ki essence.

In moments, Mosquito Daoist’s body began to shrivel up.

Mosquito Daoist let out a horrified cry. “Stop… don’t…”

Zu An sneered at her pleas. “You’ve sucked away the blood essence of countless people. Having your own blood essence sucked away today can be considered a form of retribution.”

“No…” Mosquito Daoist’s voice was incredibly weak, but she still cried out frantically, “We made a blood oath…”

“That was your own doing. I didn’t do anything,” said Zu An indifferently.

Mosquito Daoist grew livid.

“Damn you, you won’t have an easy death!”

You have successfully trolled Mosquito Daoist for 1024… 1024… 1024…

Mosquito Daoist was confident in her superior cultivation, and had only focused on crafting a loophole within her own oath. She didn’t even consider that she could be injured by the two of them.

Now, she finally understood that the other party had never planned to let her go. However, it was already too late.

Zu An took her firmly into his embrace as her body shriveled up more and more. Eventually, she became just like the dried-up corpses that she had turned all the others into.

Zu An squeezed, and Mosquito Daoist’s spine snapped with an audible crack.

He felt the woman in his arms turn into a pile of mush. He looked at the horrific state of her corpse, and felt his stomach churn. He immediately tossed her aside.

Just like that, this vicious fiend race monster who had terrorized many outstanding heroes for such a long time ceased to exist.
