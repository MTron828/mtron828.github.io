Chapter 471: Only One Good Thing about Me

Translator: Pika

“Are you from the dragon race?!” Ding Run fixed Zu An with an unwavering stare.

“Why would you think that?” Zu An asked curiously.

“Because you used Soulspeak.” Sang Hong said, gasping for air. He looked at Zu An in shock.

This wasn’t the first time he saw Zu An use this skill. In the Clans Tournament, Yuan Wendong’s cultivation was clearly superior, yet he’d lost his concentration at a critical moment, and ended up losing to Zu An.

At the time, no one had thought about this possibility. Only now, when Ding Run blurted this out, did he realize that it might be plausible.

After all, Ding Run was one of the world’s best hitmen, and Sang Hong could tell that he was a thoughtful and extremely strong-willed individual. There was no way he would be as easily distracted as Yuan Wendong. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zu An knew that they had misunderstood what was going on, but he didn’t bother to explain. This was perfectly acceptable to him, since it freed him of the burden of having to further explain the principles behind his ‘Whatcha lookin’ at’ skill.

“That’s right. Not only am I of the dragon race, I’m the reincarnation of an ancient ancestral dragon! Even the dragon god has to bow before me! By offending me, you’ve offended the entire dragon race! Are you scared yet?” Zu An was in his element when it came to spewing bullshit. If he really did scare his opponent, that would be great. If not, at least he got to feel awesome while doing so.

Sang Hong and Ding Run stared at him, unsure of how to respond.

Sang Qian was speechless as well, although something else caught his attention as well.

Wait... where the hell are you putting those hands of yours?

Sang Qien looked at him with great curiosity. This man truly held many secrets.

Zheng Dan was the only one who was smiling. This guy... really... Your lies are always so outrageous...

“I don’t give a shit if you’re of the dragon race or not. You’re going to die today!” Ding Run’s face was as dark as a storm cloud. He brandished his blade and slashed it towards Zu An.

Blade ki rushed ferociously at Zu An, ripping apart the ground as it travelled.

However, it was obvious that Ding Run’s injuries were severe. His sword ki had previously been invisible and practically impossible to defend against. Now, however, although it seemed to be as powerful as before, it was leaving noticeable tracks behind.

Zu An still held Zheng Dan in his arms. He was just about to evade when a figure stepped in front of him, and a surge of black flame deflected the incoming sword ki. Her figure wobbled slightly. Clearly, blocking this attack was not as easy as it looked.

“Big Manman!” Zu An instantly recognized who this was from her figure alone.

The eyes of Ding Run and the others in the area widened, not just because this girl had been able to block this blade despite her tender age—their eyes were clearly focused on her wobbling figure. As they looked on, they felt their hearts tremble as well.

Sang Qien couldn’t help looking down at herself, and her face immediately turned pink. What in the world does this woman eat all day? Why are the heavens so unfair?!

Pei Mianman turned to give Zu An a look. She took in the extent of his injuries, and noticed that his hands were tightly wrapped around Zheng Dan. “So you’re the sort that ends up throwing your life away while chasing girls,” she said with a snort.

Zu An chuckled. “I’d do the same for you if you were in danger.”

Pei Mianman scoffed. “Hmph, you sure are a slick talker. Could you perhaps offer some more optimistic words?”

Meanwhile, a distance away, it looked as though flames were about to shoot out of Sang Qian’s eyes. Zu An and his wife had been an item all this time! Not only did Zu An have the first miss of the Chu clan, he had all these other outstanding girls competing to save him as well! This thought only served to further fuel Sang Qian’s rage.

Even though Pei Mianman was masked, that impressive chest, the incredible curves of her body and those beautiful eyes all marked her as an exceptional beauty.

Jealousy and anger swirled within Sang Qian’s heart, threatening to explode.

You have successfully trolled Sang Qian for 999... 999... 999...

Sang Qien, meanwhile, had a thoughtful look on her face. This Zu An looks rather handsome, and he knows how to sweet talk a woman. Most importantly, he is willing to risk his own life to protect yours... How many girls could resist such charm?

“Are you all treating me like I’m not here?” Ding Run brandished his blade and charged.

His injuries were pretty significant, and the Song of the Struck Blade took too much out of him. Besides, the path of his blade ki could now be traced, which limited their effectiveness. That was why he made the decision to engage them in close quarters.

Pei Mianman’s expression grew serious. Ding Run’s cultivation was incredibly high, and she could afford no distractions. Black flames surged around her entire body as she flew forward to meet him.

The two of them exchanged several blows, and Pei Mianman suddenly cried out, clearly having suffered an injury.

If Ding Run hadn’t been carrying a serious injury of his own, the outcome would have been much worse for Pei Mianman.

Biting her lip in anguish, Zheng Dan dashed forward to lend Pei Mianman a hand. The combination of water and fire elements was strangely effective.

As they attacked, their water and fire elements overlapped, producing large amounts of steam. The air around Ding Run was constantly boiling hot, and his vision was affected as well.

When they were on the defensive, Zheng Dan condensed water shields around Pei Mianman from time to time, preventing their opponent from attacking freely.

“Let’s leave!” Sang Qian quickly picked up his father, who had been wounded by Ding Run’s sword ki earlier. He only had one thing on his mind, which was to get away from this dangerous place as quickly as possible.

The last thing he expected was for Sang Qien to say no.

“We fled earlier because there was no hope of victory even if we stayed. Now that Ding Run is seriously injured, and there are so many people on our side, we have a chance to win this. If we run now, he might successfully deal with Zu An’s group, and still have a chance to recover afterwards. If that happens, we’ll never be able to get away.”

Sang Hong nodded in agreement. “Qien’er has analyzed this correctly. Instead of facing a sure death a few days later, we might as well risk it all here.”

Sang Qien had already made her move. However, she didn’t charge straight into the battlefield. Instead, she went to Zu An first and undid his seal.

Zu An was so moved he was about to cry. “Someone finally remembered to undo this damned seal! You’re incredible, young miss Sang.”

He didn’t really blame Zheng Dan and the others. Since they were completely focused on dealing with Ding Run, they didn’t have the chance to undo his seal.

Sang Qien pushed him away, her face red. “I appreciate the gratitude, but why are you touching my hand?”

Zu An said, “In my hometown, shaking hands is a way to express gratitude... haha.”

Sang Qien rolled her eyes. Then, she drew her sword and joined the fray.

Pei Mianman and Zheng Dan were rather surprised to see her join the battle, but they couldn’t deny that the pressure on them decreased considerably.

Ding Run was appalled. He never expected that he would be put under such pressure by a few girls, moreover such young ladies. He’d become a huge laughingstock if news of this got out!

Unfortunately, there really wasn’t much he could do in his current condition. The black flames wielded by that masked woman were extremely unnatural, and he dared not let it touch him.

Zheng Dan was providing excellent support from behind, while Sang Qien was as cunning as a fox on the battlefield. She launched attacks from all manner of tricky angles, and assisted Zheng Dan from time to time as well. He was truly at his wit’s end.

He couldn’t let this drag on. Time was of the essence. He let out an ear-splitting roar, and the image of a massive purple tiger emerged. He charged straight at the three girls.

“Be careful!”

The three women were immediately put under the same pressure that Sang Hong had gone up against earlier. Ding Run’s speed and power increased drastically, and the ghostly purple tiger enhanced each of his attacks. His fighting strength had now gone up, almost equal to what it was when he was in prime condition. There was no way Pei Mianman and the other two girls could continue to keep up with him.

It didn’t take long for the three of them to fall to the ground in quick succession, injured and groaning.

Ding Run was just about to finish them off when a figure flashed across his field of vision at blinding speed, carrying the three of them away.

His expression grew cold, and he glanced at that figure. “How did you recover so quickly?”

Zu An had suffered multiple deep gashes, and had even taken the full-powered attack meant for Zheng Dan. Even if he hadn’t died, he should have been pretty close to it. However, he didn’t show any sign that he was about to expire.

Zu An chuckled and said, “What can I say? I might not be good in other areas, but my body is really hard.”

The Primordial Origin Sutra had not only made his body tougher, it also granted him amazing regenerative abilities. His condition was already considerably improved after this short period of natural recovery.

Zheng Dan’s face turned red. Her heart was pounding like a drum. This was something she understood best...

“Miss Sang, let me borrow your sword.” Zu An had carried Sang Qien back last. He used this chance to take her sword.

“Okay...” Sang Qien’s face was red. She was already so old, yet no man had ever carried her in such a manner before. She was at a loss as to how to react.
