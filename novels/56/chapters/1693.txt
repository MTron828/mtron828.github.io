Chapter 1642: Freeloader

When she heard Chu Chuyan’s voice, Pei Mianman’s entire body instantly tensed up. She couldn't help but tremble all over.

Zu An cried out inwardly. He hadn’t expected this kind of situation to happen all over again! Previously, he had been discovered by Yan Xuehen, and intended to learn from that lesson. But how could he have known that Big Manman would do… that?

The two of them embraced each other tightly, as if they wanted to fully merge with each other. It was the moment when they shared the most intimate feelings. If there had been no one else present, they would definitely have had endless sweet words to share with each other. However, there was someone outside, and it was quite the special person too.

“Manman?” Chuyan called out in confusion. She was curious about the lack of response, even after such a long time.

“Huh? Chuyan?” Pei Mianman replied, sounding a bit flustered. She pushed Zu An off her and to the side, and quickly put on her clothes.

“I only found out that you had also come to Violet Mountain from my master. You were injured during the competition, so I came with an Ice Heart Pill to help you recover sooner,” Chu Chuyan said, although she found it a bit strange. From how Pei Mianman sounded, could it be that she had been sleeping?

Zu An was shocked, remembering that Yan Xuehen had used the Ice Heart Pill before. It was White Jade Sect’s greatest medicine! It was even better than Ji Dengtu’s Soul Return Pill. It was extremely precious, and even Sect Master Yan Xuehen only had a few of them on her! Chu Chuyan had actually brought over such a pill for Pei Mianman?

Pei Mianman was also from the daoist sects now, so she had naturally heard of the Ice Heart Pill’s value. She was shocked and moved. She hadn’t expected Chuyan to give her something this precious. Meanwhile, behind Chuyan’s back, she had stolen…

She felt really vexed and blamed herself. She even found Zu An a bit less pleasing to look at.

“Please wait for a moment!” Pei Mianman called out, quickly putting on her clothes. However, when she stood up, she felt something was off. She gave Zu An an annoyed look. It’s all this guy’s fault!

Zu An felt helpless too, thinking, Why does this scene feel a bit familiar?

Suddenly, Pei Mianman pushed him toward the window and gestured for him to get lost, leaving him dejected. Why did he feel like the third wheel here?

Still, he didn’t have the courage to face Chu Chuyan’s eyes that were as pure as a frozen mountain. He could only leave with a guilty conscience.

…

Meanwhile, Pei Mianman quickly sorted out the messy bedding, then ran over to the door and said, “Chuyan, sorry about that. I’ve been really tired because of the treatment recently. I was asleep just now.”

Now, Chu Chuyan actually felt a bit embarrassed. She replied, “It’s all my fault for disturbing your rest.”

“Not at all! I finally get to meet my good friend again, so I’m extremely happy!” Pei Mianman said while inviting her in. After all, Chuyan had come with such a precious gift, so if she didn’t even let her in, it really would seem a bit inappropriate. It could even give Chuyan some doubts.

Chu Chuyan didn’t refuse her invitation. After all, back in Brightmoon City, because of her naturally cold personality and the need to maintain a dignified appearance for her clan’s business, she had basically never had friends. Pei Mianman had practically been the only one she could call a close friend.

“The reason I came here so late is that I don’t want others to know about our relationship. There have been a lot of rumors going around about me recently, so I was worried that I’d end up bringing you unnecessary attention,” Chu Chuyan explained when she saw Pei Mianman’s messy hair and sleepy appearance.

“What kinds of rumors?” Pei Mianman asked while pouring some tea for her. She was stunned to hear Chuyan’s explanation.

“You didn’t know about it?” Chu Chuyan asked; it was her turn to be surprised.

Pei Mianman explained in embarrassment, “My master locked me up in my room and has been watching over me for the sake of this tournament. I haven’t had much contact with the outside world at all.”

“So that was what happened,” Chu Chuyan said, her face turning a bit red. When the topic was related to Zu An, she couldn’t help but be a bit embarrassed. She continued, “It’s actually not that big of a deal.”

She handed over an embroidered case while saying, “This Ice Heart Pill is something the sect gave me to use for myself, but I won’t be using it anytime soon. Meanwhile, you’re injured, so I hope it can be of use.”

“How can I take something like this that could save your life? Hurry and store it away. I’m already pretty much all healed up from the sect’s care,” Pei Mianman hurriedly said, trying to refuse.

Jadefall Palace’s treatment alone had only allowed her to recover by sixty to seventy percent, but with Ah Zu’s help, she was already mostly healed. Of course, she couldn't tell Chuyan about that.

“Don’t worry. I can just ask my sect for another one,” Chu Chuyan said as she pushed the case over. “Don’t be like this. We’re good friends, aren’t we?”

When she heard Chuyan call her a good friend, Pei Mianman’s heart skipped a bit. A hint of guilt appeared on her face.

Afterward, Chu Chuyan talked to her about what had happened in the time since they had last seen each other. However, both of them tacitly chose to avoid anything related to Zu An. In that instant, it was almost as if they had returned to their carefree time back in Brightmoon City.

Suddenly, a strange sound came from Pei Mianman’s body. Chu Chuyan was stunned and looked at her in confusion.

“My stomach has been a bit uncomfortable recently…” Pei Mianman explained while cursing Zu An to death inwardly. He had actually left so much inside her!

Chu Chuyan’s expression turned strange. Back in Brightmoon City, she would really have believed it. Now that she had some experience, though, she found the sound a bit familiar. She sniffed the air and gave the messy bedding a look. When she thought about Pei Mianman’s strange reaction, she already started forming guesses.

“Then I won’t be disturbing your rest anymore,” she said, getting up to leave.

When she saw Chuyan’s expression change from gentle to completely cold, Pei Mianman felt her insides tremble. She couldn't help but call out, “Chuyan!”

Chu Chuyan stopped, but she didn’t turn back around. She asked in an icy cold tone, “What is it?”

Pei Mianman felt distraught. She said weakly, “Whether you believe it or not, I will always see you as my best friend.”

Chu Chuyan didn’t reply. She stood in silence for a long time before nodding slightly. Then, she left.

When she left, Pei Mianman looked at the Ice Heart Pill that had been left on the table. Her face heated up in embarrassment. She grabbed her hair and screamed, “Aaah! I was almost ruined by that idiot!”

…

Achoo!

Just as Zu An returned to his room, he couldn't help but sneeze.

The sound woke up Xie Daoyun, who had been lying down in the other room. She held her covers as she sat up, calling out, “Big brother Zu, you’re already back?”

Zu An gestured to indicate that she didn’t need to get up, replying, “Yeah. Go back to sleep and don’t worry about me.”

After he returned to his room and lay down, he was so embarrassed that he couldn't fall asleep. Previously, Yan Xuehen had found out that he was with Chuyan, but this time, Big Manman had been found out by Chuyan.

Just what kind of freaking bad luck is this? Should I find Chuyan and apologize?

But I ran away so fast, maybe she didn’t find out… If I go and apologize now, there’s no way Yan Xuehen won’t find out.

Just the thought of that hell made his entire body tremble.

Meanwhile, outside, Xie Daoyun found it hard to sleep as well. I wonder if big brother Zu saw my new sleepwear or not…

Zu An thought, Seeing as I can’t sleep, I might as well stay awake. He remembered that he hadn’t pulled the Keyboard System for a long time. He was usually busy and didn’t have time to do it, so tonight was the perfect time.

He counted up his points and saw that he had amassed a total of 718,836 Rage points. Most of those points had been gathered right here on Violet Mountain, thanks to his scandal with Chuyan drawing so much hatred.

In that instant, he even wondered whether to announce his relationship with Big Manman and Yan Xuehen. His Rage points would probably multiply, but he wouldn’t necessarily be able to leave Violet Mountain alive…

When he thought about the consequences that could ensue, he shuddered. Then, he began his pulls. After doing this for so long, he didn’t feel anything special anymore. Before, he would have burned some incense, taken a bath, prayed to Buddha, or whatever else. Now, he was extremely calm and just went straight to the pulls.

Thank you for playing!𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Thank you for playing!

…

When he saw the familiar words, Zu An wasn’t shaken at all. He even wanted to laugh.

Midway, however, the keyboard stopped on the number 9.

Congratulations on obtaining a Fortune Pill!

Zu An was stunned. This name is familiar! He had managed to get a Fortune Pill when he first arrived in this world. That was precisely what he had relied on to go crazy in the casinos. However, for his current self, it wasn’t that special. What, was he going to go to a casino and go through all that again? At this point, he could just rob them outright.

Hm? Maybe I should give it a try next time.

He continued the pulls, but began to frown as he watched the ‘Thank you for playing’ and Ki Fruits alternating. Why wasn’t there even a single Tiger Talisman from the pulls?

He only had the two goddesses Daji and Mo Xi right now, so he wanted to try for another one with the Tiger Talismans. Even though they weren’t all that useful in terms of combat, they could at least serve as extra hands to take care of some things.

Suddenly, the indicator stopped on the F key.

Congratulations on obtaining Freeloader!

Zu An was dumbfounded.
