Chapter 1678: Revived from the Dead

“From the first time we met,” Zu An slowly said.

Zhang Zitong couldn't understand. She asked, “Is it because that turtle spirit in Blackwater Pool said that it was a woman who threw Golden Token Seven’s corpse into the lake? Do you think that was me?”

Zu An shook his head and said, “No. I just had a feeling that something was off with you from the moment we met.”

“What kind of reason is that?!” Zhang Zitong exclaimed, feeling really wronged. After working in this field for a long time, she knew about the power of intuition too. Once one developed suspicions toward someone, even if all of the evidence suggested that they were innocent, one still wouldn’t be able to get rid of those doubts. In the end, one would find proof that they were guilty. She had never expected to end up losing to that so-called intuition.

Zu An gave her a look, then looked at her long legs and said, “You are quite attractive, and your figure is tall and slender. That’s completely different from the Embroidered Envoy’s style. Look at these people around you; they’re more like what you’d expect from an Embroidered Envoy.”

Xiao Jianren and the others wanted to cry. Is Sir Eleven praising us or cursing us?

Zhang Zitong’s face reddened. She had never expected to obtain such praise from him, but she couldn't bring herself to feel happy about it at all. She protested, “I was raised by Sir Seven ever since I was little. I already explained this to you before!”

“Any parents who could produce a daughter of your appearance and temperament couldn’t possibly be ordinary people. Golden Token Seven might have not realized he had fallen into this trap, or perhaps he didn’t want to think about it, but I’m different. I noticed that something was off immediately. You’re too outstanding and pretty,” Zu An slowly said. He paused before continuing, “Which means you definitely shouldn’t have been an Embroidered Envoy.”

Zhang Zitong gave him a long look and said, “Even though I’ve never seen Sir Eleven’s face, I can feel that you’re a handsome and outstanding individual. Why is it that you can be a Golden Token Envoy, but I’m being suspected?”

Zu An smiled and replied, “Just a single person like me is enough. Others are unable to share such a good fate.”

Zhang Zitong was speechless.

Even Xiao Jianren and the other Silver Token Envoys thought to themselves, Isn’t this Sir Eleven a bit too shameless?

“Alright, you’ve already asked what you wanted. It’s time for you to let him go, right?” Zu An continued as he walked toward Zhang Zitong.

“Don’t move!” Zhang Zitong cried as she put more pressure on the dagger, the blade already digging into Xiao Jianren’s skin. With just a bit more force, it would cut through his neck.

Zu An’s brows furrowed. He said, “I believe you understand how Xiao Jianren has treated you all this time. Are you really going to threaten us with his life?”

When he heard that, Xiao Jianren felt ashamed. His actions as of late really were too humiliating.

Zhang Zitong’s expression changed several times. In the end, she lowered the dagger in her hands and said apologetically to Xiao Jianren, “Sorry.” Afterward, she gently pushed him forward, then brought the blade up to her own neck.

Even so, Zu An was already prepared. With a flick of his finger, the dagger was knocked flying. The other Silver Token Envoys seized the chance to rush forward and restrain her with Soul Reaping Chains. Surprisingly, however, Zhang Zitong didn’t seem to have any intention of resisting.

Zhang Zitong looked up at Zu An. She said with a sad smile, “Sir Eleven, I know I’ll undoubtedly die, but I still want to say this. Being able to work together with you made this was the happiest period of my entire life.”

When Xiao Jianren and the others heard that, they weren’t that surprised. Judging from their interactions, they more or less knew that compared to Sir Eleven, they were no competition whatsoever.

Zu An’s expression changed. He walked up to Zhang Zitong and opened her mouth. He saw a strand of black blood. There was clearly poison hidden in her teeth. His finger quickly moved to seal her blood circulation and stop the poison from spreading.

Zhang Zitong smiled bleakly and said, “It’s useless. The poison is meant to end my life, and it’s extremely strong. There is no… antidote…” Her voice gradually became quieter and quieter. Her eyes also gradually lost color.

Xiao Jianren’s expression grew dark, but he knew that this was the best end for her. Otherwise, only endless torture would await her in the Embroidered Envoy’s prison. It would be better to just end her life here. Still, he thought, But why do I want to cry?

Zu An didn’t hesitate and took Zhang Zitong into the inner room, saying, “Wait outside. You’re not allowed in no matter what you hear.” Then, he slammed the door shut.

Xiao Jianren and the other Silver Token Envoys looked at each other in dismay. What was the meaning of Sir Eleven’s actions? Zhang Zitong had already activated the poison between her teeth. Did he really think he could still save her?

Zhang Zitong was also confused. Zu An had carried her into the room while she was on her deathbed, then placed her on the table. “What is he doing? Don’t tell me…” she muttered in alarm. Even though she was about to die, she still felt that all of this was… ridiculous.

Zu An moved his finger closer, then gave her body a push.

“Ah~”

When they heard that sound, Xiao Jianren and the others looked at each other in dismay. What was Sir Eleven doing? Could it be that he wanted to interrogate her all the way to her last breath?Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

After some time, muffled groans emerged from the room every so often. They were clearly being suppressed on purpose. They seemed to carry a hint of pain, but also a hint of… pleasure?

Xiao Jianren and the others were completely stunned. What the heck were the two really doing inside? Zhang Zitong had already taken poison and was about to die. How did she still have the energy to make those sounds?

Eventually, Zhang Zitong’s voice couldn't be suppressed anymore. Her screams filled the air unceasingly, sounding sweet and seductive. She couldn't hold them back at all.

The people outside were all experienced, so they immediately realized what kind of sound that was. Their expressions became incredibly strange as they thought, Sir Eleven really is someone who doesn’t like to waste resources… She’s already about to die…

Still, they felt that that kind of action was a bit… brutish. They patted Xiao Jianren’s shoulder, their eyes full of sympathy.

Xiao Jianren immediately panicked and cried, “You guys are definitely misunderstanding! It’s definitely not what you’re thinking!”

“You can fool your brothers, but don’t fool yourself. We know how you’re feeling right now,” the other Silver Token Envoys said, feeling even more sympathetic. Many of them even felt a bit sour inside, because who wouldn’t like a pretty coworker like Zhang Zitong?

Xiao Jianren scowled and retorted, “You don’t understand Sir Eleven. I believe that he’s definitely not that kind of person! Even if he were, he’s definitely saving Miss Zhang, or has some other intentions. It’s definitely not because of lust.”

The others chuckled and felt that arguing further was pointless. They didn’t try to console him anymore.

A loud cry emerged from inside, and silence fell.

The Envoys outside felt their hearts beating quickly and their throats becoming dry. They also felt that staying there wasn’t too good, so they all left to provide the two with some privacy.

After some hesitation, Xiao Jianren also left. However, he didn’t go too far and stood guard outside the courtyard to prevent anyone else from getting closer.

Zhang Zitong’s entire body dripped with sweat. Her hair stuck to her skin, and her face was completely red as she looked at the man at her side. Her expression was one of shock, but also full of embarrassment.

Zu An pulled back his finger and said, “Alright. Even though the poison hasn’t been completely eliminated, there should be no danger to your life. Cultivate properly for a while and you should be able to recover.”

“You… What kind of trick is this? Why are you even able to cure poison like this?” Zhang Zitong asked. More importantly, it just had to be through something so embarrassing…

Her voice was a bit hoarse, perhaps because of all of the noise she had made. As a woman, she had really shown this man an unbearably humiliating side of herself. If he had been her lover, that would be one thing, but strictly speaking, he was a stranger. She didn’t even know what he looked like.

Zu An was a bit embarrassed. The Primordial Origin Sutra’s third layer could help another eliminate poison to a certain degree, but the side effect was also clear. It easily made a woman’s body become several times more sensitive, as if they were…

He coughed lightly and said, “That’s not important. There’s something I’m quite curious about, though. Back then, Golden Token Seven saved you and raised you himself. He was someone who showed you tremendous favor. You also said that you treated him like your adoptive father. Why, then, did you betray him?”
