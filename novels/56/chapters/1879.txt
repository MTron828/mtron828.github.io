Chapter 1828: Jing Teng’s Original Body

“Don’t worry, that brat is even more clever and quick-witted than a ghost. He’ll be fine,” Yan Xuehen said. Despite that, she was also a bit nervous.

“But that Ghost King is just too strong! Besides, there seem to be many monsters hiding in this great tomb, making it incredibly dangerous…” Chu Chuyan said worriedly.

“Don’t worry. It’s not as if he hasn’t encountered even stronger beings before,” Yun Jianyue said. It wasn’t only to console Chu Chuyan, but also her own disciple.

Yan Xuehen couldn't help but sigh in relief when she heard Yun Jianyue speak up too, thinking, Looks like my judgment wasn’t wrong.

“Exactly, and with the help of Miss Jing who is so familiar with this great tomb, it should be okay,” Pei Mianman added.

The women all became quieter when Jing Teng was mentioned. Then, they flocked around Qiu Honglei again and asked her questions.

“Is that Miss Jing really a vine fiend?”

“Isn’t she just a bit too close to Immortal Ruler Baopu? It doesn’t seem as if she was enlightened in passing by him!”

“Also, doesn’t she know a bit too much about this tomb? She’s not like some random vine fiend at all.”

…

The more they discussed things with each other, the more they felt that there was something wrong, and yet they couldn't really come to a conclusion. In the end, they could only try to find out about how she and Zu An had met in the first place. They all stared at Qiu Honglei, because she was the one who had spent the most time with Jing Teng in this world.

When she saw all the other women look at her as if she were a little good-for-nothing, Qiu Honglei felt quite sullen too.

I don’t know either…

Jing Teng and Zu An clearly hadn’t exchanged many words along the way, and the two of them had behaved quite normally; even calling them friends would have been a stretch. Why had they suddenly become lovers?

“Either way, there’s nothing to do now but to wait, so tell us a bit about everything you’ve experienced along the way. Let’s join hands and try to see if there were any parts that you might have overlooked,” Pei Mianman said with a smile.

“How senseless,” Yan Xuehen said, stepping away to one side as if she didn’t want to join in such gossip.

The other women were full of admiration.

As expected of Sect Master Yan! She’s like a goddess of ice, standing aloof from the rest of the world.

But how could they know that Yan Xuehen’s ears were perked up and she was secretly listening to everything they did?

Meanwhile, Qiu Honglei was feeling helpless and irritated.

This big-boobed girl really is treating me as trash!

However, she was also curious about how those two had ended up together, so she could only recount everything they had gone through after she and Zu An arrived in this world.

…

The women were all perplexed after listening to her account. The two really had acted completely normally! Why had their relationship suddenly reached the level of sweethearts?

A weak voice asked just then, “Could it be that something happened in that ghost manor? Big sister Qiu and big brother Zu were together the entire time, so there’s no way he would do anything in front of you. That was the only period where the two of you were separated, and Miss Jing wasn’t near you at the time either.”

The other women’s eyes immediately brightened and they concurred, “That is the most likely case.” They all looked at Xie Daoyun and added, “We didn’t expect Miss Xie to be so bright. No wonder you were able to comprehend the most profound runes after joining the academy’s rear mountain.”

Xie Daoyun blushed and replied, “Big sisters are also really smart; it’s just that it’s harder to see these things while being caught up in the situation.”

The women’s moods finally improved a bit. Otherwise, they were all proud of their aptitudes and highly intelligent, so losing to a younger woman here would look a bit bad.

Wait, it’s one thing if we can’t see the situation since we’re all part of this mess, but what is going on with Sect Master Yun?

Yan Xuehen hadn’t joined in from the start, so no one had thought about her too much, but Yun Jianyue had been enthusiastically helping them discuss the situation.

When she saw their suspicious looks, Yun Jianyue was a bit alarmed. However, she had experienced all sorts of crazy situations and immediately asked, “Do you think that Jing Teng is seducing that brat Zu An?”

“I don’t think so,” Chu Chuyan said with a frown. Even though they hadn’t spent that much time together, that Miss Jing seemed quite icy and arrogant.

“Why not? That Jing woman’s body is full of strangeness, and that brat Zu An is so perverted. The two of them might just be doing something that’s letting all of you down,” Yun Jianyue said with a smile, as if she wished for the whole world to be cast into chaos.

…

Achoo!

Zu An, who was on the lowest floor, sneezed. Jing Teng was curled up in his arms like a rabbit, her entire body gentle and delicate. She asked, “Big brother Zu, is it cold for you?”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zu An gently caressed her skin that was heating up like a boiled egg, replying, “Your body is so warm; how could I be cold?”

“You’re so annoying. Big brother Zu is so bad…” Jing Teng protested playfully.

She normally sounded more like a strong and powerful older sister, but now, her voice was as sweet as a young maiden’s. For Zu An, it was as if he were a soldier on the battlefield roused once more by the sound of war drums. He immediately launched another assault.

“Mmm…” Jing Teng groaned with a frown. Her body shook intensely, and tears flickered at the corners of her eyes.

“I’ve caused you pain. I’m sorry…” Zu An quickly apologized. In that instant, he was caught off guard.

Jing Teng giggled when she saw his nervousness, replying, “It did hurt in the beginning, but later on…” She trailed off, her face a bit red. She wrapped her arms around his neck and gently said, “I never imagined that becoming a person would bring so much bliss.”

Zu An was startled. How could he possibly still hold himself back?

…

After an unknown amount of time had passed, the two of them were completely wrapped around each other. Zu An was startled to sense a trace of spiritual light coming out of Jing Teng’s body.

Just then, a notification sound from the Keyboard System played in Zu An’s mind.

Baopu Sutra detected. Would you like to integrate this skill?

A keyboard image appeared before Zu An’s eyes. The F6 key flickered, and the trace of light floated above it. He could see that it was in the shape of a book.

Zu An didn’t immediately integrate the skill; instead, he looked at Jing Teng and asked, “What just happened?”

“That’s the true Baopu Sutra, of course,” Jing Teng said, her face completely red. She was as meek as a kitten.

“Why was it with you, and why are you giving it to me?” Zu An asked. Even though he already knew what kind of thing it was, he was still incredibly shocked.

“I was really close to Immortal Ruler Baopu, and he couldn't find a successor in time and was about to leave. That was why he asked me to entrust this item to someone,” Jing Teng began. “As for why I gave it to you…” she continued with a sigh. Her eyes were full of emotions as she continued, “I’ve even given myself to you, so what can’t I give you?”

Zu An couldn't help but pull her close, asking, “Aren’t you worried that I might have approached you with ulterior motives?”

“I was really upset that Zang Ao tricked me in the past, but if I’ve been fooled by you…” Jing Teng began as she sat up, letting her black hair fall down. She looked calmly at him, then said with a sweet smile, “I would still accept it willingly.”

Zu An felt something stir powerfully within him. He hugged her and kissed her again.

Jing Teng cried out in alarm and hurriedly begged him, “Big brother Zu, I really can’t take any more…”

Zu An let her go with a smile, saying, “I’m not someone who doesn’t know what’s important.”

Jing Teng’s face was red from ear to ear. She thought, This guy looks like a refined and gentle scholar on the outside, but he’s actually like a freaking camel!

Zu An cried out in surprise, “I can’t sense the pressure anymore!”

He had felt as if he were about to be crushed, but now, even a long time after they kissed, he couldn't feel that terrifying pressure anymore.

“Silly big brother, didn’t I already tell you that as long as your aura harmonized with mine, you wouldn’t be in danger?” Jing Teng replied, her finger gently brushing past his cheek. Her expression was a mix of joy and unwillingness to part.

Zu An held her wonderful body close to him while helping her move her beautiful hair, which was damp with sweat, behind her ears. He asked, “Can you tell me what is going on now?”

Jing Teng sighed and replied, “Does big brother Zu still remember why you brought me here to the great tomb?”

“To search for your original body, right?” Zu An answered, looking around. He wanted to see what her original body was.

Either way, he’d already had experience with fiends, foxes, snakes, and all sorts of other creatures. As long as Jing Teng’s original body wasn’t too ridiculous, he wouldn’t be that frightened at all.

However, he suddenly recalled the monsters he had encountered along the way. They really were all ugly and disgusting things. His expression stiffened.

No, Jing Teng is so pretty. She’s definitely not a disgusting monster like that.

Jing Teng suddenly smiled and said, “Big brother Zu must be worried that my original body is an ugly and disgusting monster, right?”

Zu An’s face heated up. He lowered his head and kissed her, saying, “Don’t worry. Since we’re already together, I can accept it no matter what your original form is like.”

“Really? What if its entire body is covered in eyes like that floor, or there’s slime covering its entire body…” Jing Teng began, causing Zu An’s face to pale a bit as he listened to her. She watched his expression closely. When she saw that, her body rocked back and forth with laughter. She then said, “Alright, alright, I won’t mess with you anymore. That is my original body.”

Then, she pointed at a certain place. Zu An followed her finger and looked in that direction. He was stunned to see that apart from a sky full of stars, there was nothing else.

When she saw his confused look, Jing Teng moved closer into his embrace and said, “Over there. Follow that direction.”

Zu An finally saw what she was pointing at under her lead. There was a talisman at the very center of the constellations, and it had a deep crack in it. His expression changed as he asked, “That talisman is your original body?”
