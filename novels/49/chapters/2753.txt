Chapter 2754: Tian (3)

Finally, the giant god disappeared and Ye Qingtang returned to her original state. Given that she had just comprehended the Heavenly Dao divine power and couldn’t maintain it for long.

“Haha, that’s right… unfortunately, you won’t be able to maintain it for long. Even if you can maintain the Heavenly Dao Reincarnation state, you still won’t be able to kill me. How can you hope to defeat me now in your original state?” The God of Nature smiled at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang remained silent.

“Although your potential is great, the speed at which you absorb the Heavenly Dao energy is just too slow,” the God of Nature continued.

“Cut the crap. I can’t kill you but you can’t do anything to me either,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Is that so?” The God of Nature sneered. “The divine power of the Heavenly Dao is not unique to you.”

As he spoke, the world turned pitch-black, as if everything had entered an abyss.

“The Heavenly Dao… is fixed.” The God of Nature looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled. “During this period of time, everything in this world will be suspended except for me.”

“My body can’t move…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply.

“Of course, you have the same Heavenly Dao energy as me. Therefore, you can still think and move your mouth, but that’s all.” As he spoke, the God of Nature instantly appeared beside Ye Qingtang.

He placed his palm on Ye Qingtang’s head. “It’s over… I will become the new Tian. I will absorb your power!”

At that, the God of Nature activated his Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to suck the Heavenly Dao energy in Ye Qingtang’s body.

“Hahahaha, as expected… the density of your Heavenly Dao energy is exactly the same as my sister’s. No, even better than my sister’s!” The God of Nature sneered.

......

However, the God of Nature’s smile did not last long.

“Eh…” The God of Nature looked puzzled.” Strange, why is there so little Heavenly Dao energy in your body? ”

The God of Nature realized that the Heavenly Dao energy in Ye Qingtang’s body was nearly empty when he started to absorb it.

“You want to know why?”

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

As Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline nourished by the Heavenly Dao energy locked onto the God of Nature like a prehistoric magical beast.

“This!”

The God of Nature’s expression changed when he sensed Ye Qingtang’s Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. “You… also have the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline?!”

“It’s not just the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline…” Ye Qingtang stared at the God of Nature.” Didn’t you ask me where my Heavenly Dao energy went… I used it all to nourish the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. You should know what will happen if such a huge amount of Heavenly Dao energy is used to cultivate this bloodline…”

“Something that surpasses the god-level Heavenly Demon Devouring… Heavenly Dao Devouring Bloodline?!” At that moment, disbelief surfaced in the God of Nature’s eyes. “You’re crazy! In this case, your Heavenly dao power will disappear… It will only be used to cultivate the bloodline!”

“Ha, why would it disappear? It can just devour you, right?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“You have a death wish!”

The God of Nature roared in anger and tried to escape.

However, Ye Qingtang’s Heavenly Dao Devouring Bloodline seemed to have an endless suction force that made the God of Nature unable to move.

At that moment, the God of Nature could even sense the universe inside him.
