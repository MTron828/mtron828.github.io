Chapter 1225 Temple of Shadows 2

“…” Ye Qingtang did not know what to say. However, her gaze quickly shifted to the man with the goatee.

“The Nine Souls Ring is still on his person.”

The Undead immediately looked at the man with the goatee. Their empty eye sockets seemed to be filled with the intention to kill.

“Despicable human, how dare you make a fool of us!”

“Kill him! Flay him and we will certainly find the Nine Souls Ring!”

The man with the goatee suddenly had a bright idea. He hurriedly smiled at Ye Qingtang and said, “Great Holy Lord, I would never dare to make fools of the esteemed Undead Clan. I… am merely a great admirer of yours. I only wanted to look reverently upon the Nine Souls Rings that you wore. Since I have seen your esteemed self now, I am content. I will certainly return the Nine Souls Ring with all due respect.”

As he spoke, the man with the goatee unhurriedly took an exquisite bangle from his robes.

The bangle was exquisite, but she could not tell what material it was made of. It was snow-white and beautiful, but eerie carvings could faintly be seen on its surface.

An Undead took the Nine Souls Ring and offered it to Ye Qingtang with both hands.

Ye Qingtang took the Nine Souls Ring and realized that the Undead were staring at her, as if expecting her to put it on. Ye Qingtang did not wish to create more trouble, so she simply put the Nine Souls Ring on.

Strangely, the Nine Souls Ring vanished the moment she put it on. She involuntarily reached out to touch her wrist and felt the shape of the Nine Souls Ring. But when she looked at it, she could not see any trace of it.

Was this thing invisible?

Ye Qingtang was pleased. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Legend had it that the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows was incomparably powerful. She could even single-handedly take on a hundred powerful cultivators from the second domain.

Naturally, the Holy Lord’s Dharma treasure would be extraordinary. Had she not been forced to acquire a treasure by chance?

“Holy Lord, how should we deal with this person?” When the Undead looked at the Nine Souls Ring that had vanished on Ye Qingtang’s wrist, their tone became even more agitated.

Ye Qingtang did not understand why they had suddenly become so agitated. She swept a glance at the man with the goatee.

“Bring him back.” Was this fellow still planning to resist? How his fortunes had changed.

The man with the goatee looked despaired.

The Undead naturally followed Ye Qingtang’s orders.

“Holy Lord, since you have returned, why don’t you return to the Holy Temple with us? Everyone is waiting for you.”

“I still have some matters to deal with,” Ye Qingtang said blandly.

Return to the Temple of Shadows with them?

What a joke. Who knew whether her true status would be exposed there?

However…

When the Undead looked as though they had been struck by lightning when they heard Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Holy Lord, please come back with us!”

“The Temple of Shadows cannot do without you, Holy Lord!”

“If you don’t return with us, we will follow you. The Temple of Shadows cannot lose you again!” The Undead pleaded pitifully. They kneeled in front of Ye Qingtang and repeated kowtowed as they begged.

Ye Qingtang saw that if she did not return with them, they would insist on following her. They might even send word back to the Temple of Shadows. Then, who knew how many Undead would flock over and cause more trouble?

Ye Qingtang had intended to increase her personal abilities during this trip to Central Mainland so that she could regain little You Yun. She would also take the opportunity to search for news of her mother. If she became entangled with a group of Undead from the Temple of Shadows, she would not be able to go anywhere.
