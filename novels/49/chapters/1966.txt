Chapter 1967: Guests From All Places (2)

Ye Qingtang was familiar with some of those who came for their protection...

For example... Eternal Dynasty, the dynasty that was oppressed by the Central Dynasty, almost to the point of being wiped out.

When Ye Qingtang heard about the Eternal Dynasty, her brows furrowed.

Back when she communicated with Ling Yan via the voice transmission stone the other time, Ling Yan had broken off abruptly. Ye Qingtang didn’t know what had happened, but now that she thought about it... The Central Dynasty was probably behind it.

Ye Qingtang didn’t do anything more, she only headed for the hall.

...

In the hall.

The groups of leaders gathered, awaiting her arrival.

Adorning a gold mask, Ye Qingtang entered the hall. When the leaders saw her, they quickly knelt on the ground, showing profound respect.

Ye Qingtang sighed as she looked at them. In her past life, she hadn’t even been to the Central Mainland before, but now...

“Greetings, Holy Lord!” They gave her a full bow.

Ye Qingtang spotted a familiar figure among them.

Ye Qingtang hadn’t seen much of Ling Yan ever since the Eternal Dynasty. Now that she saw him, she realized that he hadn’t changed much at all. He still appeared gentle with a smile on his face.

Right when Ye Qingtang was about to look away, Ling Yan seemed to have noticed her. When he lifted his eyes, their eyes met and the smile on his face widened.

Ye Qingtang quickly averted her eyes to distract herself. But just as she did that, she noticed a few familiar figures.

Among the crowd, an elder knelt on the ground. The elder was dressed in a simple outfit, with a dignified countenance. Though he exuded an overbearing aura, he still appeared welcoming.

It was The President of the Sacred Martial Academy...

The moment she saw the President of the Sacred Martial Academy, everything from her past life flooded into her mind.

In her past life, news of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao being inside her body was leaked. Everyone only knew that it was the Heart of the Demon God. When she was still in the Sacred Martial Academy, though the cultivation was tough, she couldn’t deny that she felt warmth during her time there.

But she hadn’t expected that after the news of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was leaked, the President of the Sacred Martial Academy, whom she once respected, colluded with the Central Dynasty. They worked together and did everything they could to beat her down. The Northstar Demon Lord even died while trying to save her.

The President of the Sacred Martial Academy, the one she once held so much respect for... She used to trust her seniors so much...

Ye Qingtang got herself together, slightly narrowing her eyes.

She thought that the Central Dynasty was on the Ancient You Clan’s side and that naturally meant that the Sacred Martial Academy would also join their side. However, here they were today...

Lifting her gaze, Ye Qingtang scanned the hall. Other than Ling Yan and the President of the Sacred Martial Academy, she spotted a few other familiar figures.

Yin Yang Child?

It was that little rascal she met in the mystic realm previously, she didn’t expect him to be here too. But this time, Yin Yang Child had a sinister look on his face.

Ye Qingtang learned from Xue Fu that the enemy of Yin Yang Child’s father also joined the Ancient You Clan’s side and leveraging on the Ancient You Clan’s power, they killed Yin Yang Child’s father.

It was lucky enough that Yin Yang Child was able to avoid them, but he had nowhere else to go and could only come for the Temple of Shadows’ protection.

Ye Qingtang instantly understood everything.

After looking around, she whispered something in Xue Fu’s ear and turned around to leave without bothering with the rest.
