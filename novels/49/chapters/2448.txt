Chapter 2449: Are You Playing A Prank On Me? (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched as she looked at the big yellow dog wagging its tail beside her. Was this dog playing a prank on her? She was looking for her students. Her human students. When did she ask for it to bring her to an above-Emperor level monster? Did it look like she wanted to die?

The big yellow dog glanced at her and said, “I say… Is this your so-called student?”

“What do you think?” Ye Qingtang asked unhappily.

“What do you mean by that? How would I know? However, even if that monster is your student, it shouldn’t be strange… As the saying goes, there are all sorts of strange things in the world. When the forest is big, there are all kinds of birds, right?”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“Search again.” Ye Qingtang tried her best to calm herself down and said to the big yellow dog.

“Give me some beef to eat first. When I’m hungry I can’t move,” the big yellow dog said to Ye Qingtang.

Exasperated, Ye Qingtang took out some beef from her dwindling reserves and shared it with the yellow dog.

After entering the Wailing Well, she could not use her interspatial ring. Therefore, the rations that Ye Qingtang brought in from the outside were all that she carried with her. Everyone in the team had prepared a little, only enough for a person for a few days. The big yellow dog’s appetite was huge and at this rate, Ye Qingtang estimated that her rations would only be able to last another three to four days. After that, she would really have to eat the above-Emperor level monster roasted by the big yellow dog.

“Give me more.” After the big yellow dog finished eating, it wagged its tail at Ye Qingtang as if it wanted more.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “Good boy… I will give you more when we find my students.”

“Then why are you still standing there? Hurry up. You can move faster, so let me ride on you. I have to conserve energy. I’m too hungry,” the yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck.

What did this yellow dog just say?

Let it ride on her?

“How?” Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog in a daze.

“Up to you. You can carry me or put me on your shoulders.”

“I don’t think so.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“Never mind. You can also place me on your head.”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Forget it. She would just carry it.

With that, Ye Qingtang grabbed the big yellow dog and carried it.

“Lead the way,” Ye Qingtang said to the big yellow dog in her arms.

Very quickly, carrying the big yellow dog, Ye Qingtang turned into an afterimage, disappearing from where she was instantly and dashing into the distance.

“Are you a woman? Can you be gentler? I’m going to suffocate in your arms,” the big yellow dog said unhappily. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“If you spout more nonsense, you can travel on your own legs.” Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog impatiently.

Was this a dog? This big yellow dog was even fussier than a human.

“Wait a moment…”

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to scold the dog, it suddenly spoke.

Ye Qingtang stopped instantly and looked at it with a frown. “What’s wrong?”

“I want to poop,” the big yellow dog said to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Could someone come and save her?

…

A few hours later, Ye Qingtang brought the big yellow dog to a stretch of barren land.

“Is that… the moon?”

Ye Qingtang looked up into the sky with a strange expression.

“What moon? They’re all energy bodies formed from grievances,” said the yellow dog.

“How did you know?” Ye Qingtang was surprised..
