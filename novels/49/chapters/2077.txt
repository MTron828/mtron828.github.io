Chapter 2078: Powerful Enemies (3)

The only people left in the Temple of Shadows were the Undead Clan. Even the Jiang family had been sent back to their homes by Ye Qingtang. Likewise, the Northstar Demon Lord had left with the Demon Clan as well.

But a powerful enemy had suddenly appeared in front of them. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

After she had sent the eight tribe leaders and Ming Wang away, she walked over to Ling Yan’s room, kicked down his door, and dragged him out. She was clearly a head shorter than him but looked fierce as she dragged him away.

“Miss Ye.” He was amused as she dragged him away, and the azure dragon hurried after them.

‘Hm, did she already notice?’

‘Is Ling Yan going to die?’

The azure dragon thought meanly.

Ye Qingtang didn’t say a single word as she dragged Ling Yan into Ning Luo’s room.

Ning Luo was taking care of Little You Yun in the room and looked at her in puzzlement as she entered.

Seeing that everyone was there, she spoke up. “You must all leave the Temple of Shadows right away. The further you go, the better.”

“What?” Ning Luo asked in shock.

Wasting no time, Ye Qingtang helped Ning Luo pack the medications for Little You Yun as she said, “The Ancient You Clan has roped in powers from the Second Domain to fight us and they’re heading toward the Temple of Shadows right now. They’re here for the Spirit of Chaos. Ning Luo, I’m leaving Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue in your care. I trust that you won’t let them fall into anyone else’s hands.”

As she said this, she stuffed the space ring which was full of items into his hands.

Ning Luo looked at her strangely and said, “What do you mean? You’re... going to stay here?”

With a smile, she only said, “I’m the Holy Lord of Shadows. How could I leave?”

If she left, she wouldn’t even have to worry about the Heavenly Wolf Sect. The Crimson League would kill her first.

Furthermore...

The entire Temple of Shadows would be dragged into the mess.

Ning Luo’s eyes were complicated. But in the end, he decided to leave with Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue. Before he left, he said, “Ye Qingtang.”

She looked at him.

“You shouldn’t die here.”

With that, he turned and left quickly.

Seeing that Ning Luo had left with Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue, her lips curled up into a smile. Everyone in the First Mainland could be revived as long as Little You Yun was safe...

She had settled one problem.

With that, she turned to Ling Yan who was behind her and said, “You’ve heard everything that I’ve said. I don’t need to say anymore, do I?”

Ling Yan smiled slightly and said, “Miss Ye wants me to leave.”

“So why aren’t you leaving?” she said with a light laugh.

Ling Yan had helped her too many times. She couldn’t let him die here. As soon as the battle started, Ling Yan wouldn’t be able to protect himself with his capabilities.

“I guess I have no choice but to respectfully obey,” he said with a smile, immediately agreeing to her request without any hesitation.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

This d*mned rascal. Couldn’t he at least pretend a little?

“Go now, or you won’t be able to leave once the battle starts.” They were running out of time. The Heavenly Wolf Sect was about to reach them and she left as soon as she heard his answer.

Ling Yan smiled at her back and brought the azure dragon back to their room. After packing his possessions, he prepared to leave the Temple of Shadows.
