Illusory Void? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang’s heart skipped a beat. She had heard a thing or two about the Illusory Void in her previous life.

It was just that this name appeared in the Second Domain in her previous life.

Rumor had it that the Illusory Void was an extremely mysterious mystic realm. No one knew when it would open nor where its entrance was.

The opening time of the Illusory Void was completely uncontrollable, and it had been over thousands of years since the last opening. It was said that anyone who entered it would experience a surge in skills, but many also disappeared forever after entering it.

Ye Qingtang looked up at the huge arch before her, and uneasiness crept into her heart.

What Ming Wang said just now seemed to imply that the Illusory Void was right after this nebular arch.

Ming Gu, who followed over, did not sense Ye Qingtang’s uneasiness and instead appeared displeased as he pursed his lips at his older brother.

“Brother, Ah Yao just came back not long ago. What is the hurry in entering the Illusory Void? Who knows when she will return once she enters? Apart from Ah Yao, no one else can enter this Illusory Void. If she enters it today, I may not be able to see her for a long time.”

Ye Qingtang was slightly stunned by Ming Gu’s words.

The Illusory Void is really inside this door?

Could it be that the Holy Lord of Shadows stumbled across this illusion and sealed it in her own secret chambers?

The key point of what Ming Gu said caused Ye Qingtang to turn cold from shock.

Only the Holy Lord of Shadows could enter this Illusory Void?

Ignoring Ming Gu’s complaints, Ming Wang fixed his eyes on Ye Qingtang and bowed respectfully. “Holy Lord, you finally returned after such a long time. We are unable to open this Illusory Void, and we don’t know if it is still complete. Thus, I requested you here to inspect it.”

Ye Qingtang’s expression remained the same, but her heart dropped.

It was really over this time.

Never had she expected that the Holy Lord of Shadows actually hid such an illusory space. Since the Holy Lord of Shadows instilled the arch to enter the illusory space, it only recognized her, and others were unable to open it.

This was all Ming Wang’s test.

Yet, Ye Qingtang had no other choice right now.

Ming Wang’s actions were extremely logical—after all, only the Holy Lord of Shadows could enter this Illusory Void, and no one could be certain of the situation inside over the past thousands of years. Thus, the only solution was for the Holy Lord to inspect it herself.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang was in utter despair.

“Please inspect it, Holy Lord.” Ming Wang kept a respectful expression on his face, but his eyes scrutinized her sharply.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath secretly, though she kept a straight face. Taking a glance at Ming Wang, she headed straight to the unusual nebular arch without a word.

“F*ck. This Ming Wang is full of schemes.” The little white tiger seized the chance to mumble when Ye Qingtang reached the arch.

With things as such, Ye Qingtang could only muster her courage and stretch her hand out.

When her palm touched the arch, a cold blast of air rushed from the arch into her palm. The feeling was inexplicable—it seemed to be so chilly that it made one shudder, yet it also seemed to be so scorching that it made one tremble.

Since it was death regardless of whether Ye Qingtang opened it or not, she could only give it her all.
