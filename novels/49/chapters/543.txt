Chapter 544 Exposed Identity (2)

Wasn’t the girl on that arrest warrant Ye Qingtang, who was standing before them right now?!

At that moment, the Blood Moon Elder who had been staying in the blood-colored carriage was alarmed as he witnessed everything.

It’s over now! He thought to himself.

“You have a death wish!”

The Blood Moon Division Head was enraged immediately and slapped towards Ye Qingtang.

Nonetheless, Ye Qingtang was already prepared and retreated backward before he struck.

The Blood Moon Division Head was boiling with fury at that moment. If other divisions knew that they were fooled by a disciple of an ordinary sect, wouldn’t he become the biggest joke in Blood Moon Sect!

Although it was unknown why the Demonic Water was ineffective on her, it was without doubt that this girl was fake given that Xuanling Sect’s Grand Elder and other high-ranking executives already had a slip of the tongue earlier.

The more the Blood Moon Division Head thought about it, the more furious he was. How he wished he could crush Ye Qingtang who fooled him with a strike!

But before the Blood Moon Division Head could vent his anger on Ye Qingtang, several figures suddenly appeared in midair, and hundreds of people came in just a few seconds.

“Yuehua Sect… Lingyun Sect…”

Yunxiao Sect masses smiled as they saw the other sects coming. Similar to Yunxiao Sect, Yuehua Sect and Linyun Sect were super sects of Formidable Heavens Dynasty.

Among the forces that annihilated Blood Moon Sect back then, these two sects participated as well. Now that they suddenly came, it was probably because they heard of the Blood Moon Sect’s appearance.

“Humph! The remaining evil of Blood Moon Sect!”

An elderly swept his eyes across the Blood Moon Sect masses and shouted coldly.

Ye You took a glance and could not help but scoff in her heart when she saw that the Sect Masters of both sects arrived at the scene as well. She glimpsed at where Ye Qingtang was from the corner of her eyes and subsequently said to both Sect Masters, “Yuehua Sect Master, Lingyun Sect Master, the remaining evil of Blood Moon Sect has appeared. Let’s combine our forces and kill them all!”

Naturally, Ye You’s words would not be rejected as the Sect Masters of both super sects were originally here to deal with Blood Moon Sect.

They were aware of how powerful and influential Blood Moon Sect was back then. If Blood Moon Sect was allowed to resurrect completely, the hundreds of sects which participated in annihilating Blood Moon Sect back then would probably face a powerful enemy.

Ye Qingtang was not surprised by the appearance of the other two super sects. She had expected all of this.

Initially, Ye Qingtang’s plan was to use the shortest time to completely wipe out the Yunxiao Sect forces here and lead the Blood Moon Sect masses to flee from this place. According to her calculation, the other two super sects would not be able to reach in time.

It was, however, a pity that she was ultimately just one step short of success…

Ye Qingtang was extremely helpless. She was clearly just a step away.

Uncontrollably, Ye Qingtang darted a look to the Grand Elder not far away.

The plan was truly messed up by the Grand Elder.

However, Ye Qingtang would not place the blame on the Grand Elder. After all, if it were her, she would probably react that way as well since she had never told the Grand Elder before this…

Almost all of the high-ranking executives of Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect were present. It was completely different from Yunxiao Sect’s situation where they only had a few people left.

“Blood Moon Sect… you all didn’t hide properly and even dared to appear so brazenly! You truly have a death wish!” The Yuehua Sect Master roared sternly.

“Pull of bullshit.” The Blood Moon Division Head scofted coldly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“You’re still so reluctant to admit defeat even with death near at hand!” Lingyun Sect Master waved an arm. “Kill!”

As the command was given, the three sects attacked at the same time and charged towards the Blood Moon Sect members. “Kall!

The Blood Moon Division Head was not fearful at all as he welcomed the battle.

Boom!

A war erupted instantly with thunderous rumbles exploding in

the sky.
