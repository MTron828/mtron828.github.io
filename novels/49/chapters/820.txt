Chapter 821 Xuanyuan Yi (1)

Xuanyuan Lie’s entire body contorted in pain, and his face was full of agony. He never thought that Ye Qingtang’s punch would be so terrifying that he did not have any ability to resist.

“Xuanyuan Lie, you claim to be the number one genius of Falling Sky Valley but can’t even block a punch from me?” Ye Qingtang towered over Xuanyuan Lie and snickered.

“You…”

Veins were popping out of Xuanyuan Lie’s forehead, and he wished he could chop Ye Qingtang into pieces.

“Do you think that you’re unparalleled just because you entered Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three at this age?” Ye Qingtang gazed at Xuanyuan Lie emotionlessly. In the next second, strong winds were stirred up, and a frightening Yin Yang Perfected Lord aura completely enveloped Xuanyuan Lie in it.

“Half-step… Yin Yang Perfected Lord?!”

After he sensed Ye Qingtang’s daunting martial aura, disbelief filled Xuanyuan Lie’s eyes.

He originally thought that Ye Qingtang was at most in the mid-stage of Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three and never thought that she would actually be a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

“How… How can it be!” Xuanyuan Lie was unreconciled to it. As Falling Sky Valley’s number one talent, he was already admired by many of the younger generation disciples for being able to enter the late-stage of Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three at this age.

But Ye Qingtang was younger than him and was already a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord…

If Xuanyuan Lie did not offend her, Ye Qingtang would not bother with him either. However, Xuanyuan Lie blocked her way and launched a killing move just now. Thus, Ye Qingtang would not spare any mercy.

No matter who it was, anyone who wanted her life must be prepared to be killed.

Swoosh!

In a flash, a long black sword was unsheathed, and Ye Qingtang slashed down at Xuanyuan Lie without talking any nonsense.

A deathly air enshrouded Xuanyuan Lie instantly.

Xuanyuan Lie had never felt such a bitter cold before, and fear arose within him for the first time.

However, before Ye Qingtang’s sword could touch Xuanyuan Lie, a piercing sound rang in the air.

In the next second, an invisible screen isolated Xuanyuan Lie.

Boom! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Qingtang slashed down, but it landed on the screen. There was only a scratch on the screen, and Xuanyuan Lie was completely untouched.

Instinctively, Xuanyuan Lie looked up in the sky.

At this instant, a white-robed elderly was standing in the air, and his cold eyes which seemed to be filled with endless intimidation were locked on Ye Qingtang.

“Grand… Grandfather!”

Xuanyuan Lie was very glad to see the white-robed elderly.

Fortunately, that junior brother sent the message in time and requested his grandfather to come over. Otherwise, he would have been slaughtered by Ye Qingtang’s sword just now!

Xuanyuan Lie’s grandfather, Xuanyuan Yi, was the Peak Master of Full Moon Peak, and his cultivation had already entered the Third Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

“Xuanyuan Yi…”

Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly furrowed upon seeing the white-robed elderly.

Xuanyuan Yi’s martial skills were extremely powerful. He was a true Yin Yang Perfected Lord and had already reached the Third Heaven. Leaving her aside, even ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lords definitely could not be Xuanyuan Yi’s opponent.

Seeing that Xuanyuan Yi rushed over here, Ye Qingtang knew that she had no way of killing Xuanyuan Lie.

A trace of a smile emerged on Ye Qingtang’s face immediately, and she kept the black sword into its sheath.

“Ye Chen, how bold of you.” Xuanyuan Yi told Ye Qingtang coldly.
