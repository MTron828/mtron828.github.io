Chapter 2740: Ye Yue (1)

“How is it possible?”

The Great Immortal Temple disciple with the Destruction-level divine weapon was shocked.

This was the divine weapon that his master, Wan Rong, had left to him after she died. Its power far exceeded that of a Heaven-level divine weapon. How could it be blocked by a mere two fingers?!

The disciple was then stunned when he saw Ye Qingtang’s face.

“You… the statue… this…” The Great Immortal Temple disciple was shocked.

Ye Qingtang was confused.

Statue?

Ye Qingtang followed that person’s gaze and looked at a huge statue in front of her.

The statue was lifelike and about a hundred feet tall. Its long hair reached its waist and its expression was cold. There was an unsheathed divine weapon at its waist.

Looking carefully, it looked exactly like Ye Qingtang.

“Ye… Ye Yue… Saint Ye Yue?!” The Great Immortal Temple disciple said in disbelief.

Ye Qingtang smiled and charged into the sky.

In the air, Ye Qingtang’s eyes turned silver and a torrential divine aura engulfed the entire area.

Sensing this divine power that was like that of a True God, everyone present was shocked and looked up into the sky.

When they saw Ye Qingtang, Feng Jiuyou and Feng Wuyin were stunned.

Disbelief appeared in the eyes of the Nine Heavens Saint and the Absolute Heaven Saint.

“Ha, so she has finally reappeared.”

A cold chuckle echoed across the sky.

A man walked out from the darkness and stood beside Ye Qingtang.

“Han Cangming?!”

When they saw Han Cangming, the people from the Deity Realm and the Great Immortal Temple were incensed.

“Found you.” Han Cangming stared at Ye Qingtang and chuckled.

Ye Qingtang stared at Han Cangming thoughtfully.

“What do you want?” Ye Qingtang asked. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t want to do anything now. It’s just that your absence has troubled me. Why don’t you tell them who kidnapped you back then?” Han Cangming chuckled.

Ye Qingtang frowned as she looked at Han Cangming.

The current Han Cangming was completely different from that era. He even had a hint of Ling Yan’s aura. His eyes seemed to be filled with wisdom.

After Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan left that year, Han Cangming managed to undo the seal. However, he was pursued by the Great Immortal Temple.

With the passing of another thousand years, Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou had grown up and never stopped pursuing Han Cangming. His life had not been easy either.

“Ha, I’m really stupid. My future self plotted against me and snatched away the woman who should have been mine… Tell me, who should I blame for this?” Han Cangming stared at Ye Qingtang and smiled.

With the sudden appearance of Ye Qingtang and Han Cangming, the minds of the Great Immortal Temple members, Feng Jiuyou and the rest went blank for a moment. They were utterly confused.

“Do you want revenge?”

Ye Qingtang asked.

“Revenge?” Han Cangming shook his head and smiled. “This entire situation was planned by the future me. It has nothing to do with you. Meanwhile, it seems a little inappropriate for me to seek revenge on myself? But luckily, since you’re not dead, you can explain to everyone. From now on, we don’t owe each other anything.”

“Alright, I will explain everything to everyone,” Ye Qingtang agreed.

“Thank you…” With that, Han Cangming turned to leave. However, before he made it too far, Han Cangming’s voice rang out again. “Oh yes, tell that future me… He’s too ruthless. I don’t like him.”
