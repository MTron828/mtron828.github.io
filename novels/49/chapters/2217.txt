Chapter 2218: Spy Cloud (3)

Several people were taken aback.

“What?”

Ye Qingtang looked at the gradually approaching Night Soul Beast. “At this distance, the Night Soul Beast has already detected the scent of our souls. Once a Night Soul Beast locks onto you, it will keep following the scent of your soul until it finds you and swallows your soul.

“Your team was not familiar with the Evil Soul Forest. It is very foggy and it is inevitable that you will get separated when fleeing. Those who were separated from the main group would definitely die.” Ye Qingtang spoke impassively. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Night Soul Beast came this way as it had been pursuing after the Spy Cloud man. But now, they were all within its detection. They had to flee out of the Evil Soul Forest before the Night Soul Beast caught up with them.

But...

The Night Soul Beast’s speed was faster than any human. They were born from souls and there were souls everywhere in the Evil Soul Forest.

“Muying, swallow this elixir.” Ye Qing stuffed a pill into Muying’s mouth.

“Yun Chen, protect Muying. The rest of you, follow me.”

Everyone was stunned by Ye Qing’s orders.

Even the man was stunned.

“What... what are you guys doing? Are you all mad? You won’t be able to defeat it! There were over a hundred people in my team and they all died in the hands of that Night Soul Beast. Even a Divine Lord-level practitioner was no match for it. You are just hurrying to your death!

The man believed this bunch of people must have gone mad. The most powerful amongst them was just a Paragon Eighth Heaven level. Most of the others were just Sixth or Seventh Heaven level. How could this group of kids hope to fend against a Night Soul Beast?

Ye Qingtang ignored the man’s cries. She immediately arranged for what Lei Yan and the rest should do next.

Lei Yan had been somewhat afraid but after hearing Ye Qing say that he had already been locked on by the Night Soul Beast and it was either him or the beast, his mind immediately cleared up.

In just the blink of an eye, Yun Chen covered Mu Ziying protectively while she swallowed Ye Qing’s pill. A strange glint flashed across her eyes.

Meanwhile, the Night Soul Beast had already arrived before Ye Qingtang and the rest.

It was massive, but even more terrifying was that after it came near, Nangong Lie and the group realized this Night Soul Beast’s body was just a half-transparent mass of murky, viscous liquid. And through the translucent parts of its body, the twisted faces of people floated about...

They were the souls swallowed by the beast...

Ye Qingtang didn’t expect to meet a Night Soul Beast so soon after entering the Evil Soul Forest.

Even so, Ye Qingtang was not anxious at all. She quietly gestured for Nangong Lie, Lei Yan, Jing Ze and Qin Feng to hide in their own corners. Meanwhile, she charged to the front to attract the beast’s attention.

“So painful...”

“Save me...”

The souls swallowed by the Night Soul Beast emitted mournful cries. The hairs of Lei Yan and the rest all stood on end as they observed the souls swirling endlessly inside the Night Soul Beast’s body.

The Night Soul Beast’s attention was all focused on Ye Qingtang now. The black mass suddenly churned wildly.

In the next second, countless black hands shot out from the Night Soul Beast’s body, heading straight toward Ye Qingtang!

The hearts of Lei Yan and the rest surged up to their eyes at the sight of those countless hands.
