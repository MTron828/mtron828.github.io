Chapter 1287: The Eldest Prince (1)

The Eldest Prince paused and continued. “Before this, Ling Qiong and I planned to imprison him and thought that he would never see the light of day again. But… he unexpectedly escaped without a scratch.”

Ye Qingtang was speechless as she quietly listened to all this.

These two wanted to trap Ling Yan?

It was more likely that Ling Yan had willingly gone to prison; otherwise, they certainly could not have locked him into the dungeon.

However…

After hearing this, Ye Qingtang could not help but worry.

Based on the current situation, it looked like the Eldest Prince and Princess had already obtained the support of the Temple of Shadows while the Second Princess had the support of the Sacred Ground of Reflection.

Ling Yan on the other hand… was fighting alone.

Should she be applauding his ability or lamenting the fact that he had no allies?

Ye Qingtang also understood the Temple of Shadows’s plans. The Temple of Shadows was supporting the Eldest Prince, which meant they were opposing Ling Yan. It would be natural for Ling Yan to happily expose the false Holy Lord, who was on the opposing side.

“It’s late. Please go and rest. We will discuss other things when all of you are rested.” Although the Eldest Prince was anxious about the matter of the crown prince, he did not dare to delay Lady Ghost and the others.

Lady Ghost nodded, and the servants led them, along with the others from the Temple of Shadows, away to rest.

Ye Qingtang only relaxed after she returned to her room.

The little white tiger, who had been cuddled in her arms, now jumped onto the chair and shook out its fluffy fur.

“This Eldest Prince and Princess seem like a bad lot. They probably killed the Fourth Prince.” The little white tiger flicked its ears.

“It might not be them, it might be the Second Princess. However… that’s not important. Their motives are all the same. They will not allow anyone else to become the crown prince or get closer to the throne.” Ye Qingtang sat nearby and rested her chin on her hand.

In her previous life, she was exhausted from fleeing and had not come into much contact with the jostling and intrigues of the various major dynasties. However, the intensity of these did not pale in contrast to any battle.

“Do you trust Ling Yan that much? Why don’t you just say that he did it?” The little white tiger glanced at Ye Qingtang and asked naughtily.

Ye Qingtang rolled her eyes at it.

“Do you think he is so stupid? Since someone will definitely do it on his behalf, he doesn’t need to soil his hands.”

“You really understand him very well…” The little white tiger said meaningfully.

Ye Qingtang ignored him.

Little white tiger did not mind. It batted its eyes and suddenly jumped onto Ye Qingtang’s knee and stared at her.

“Get down.” Ye Qingtang frowned. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

This fellow was getting heavier, and her arms ached from carrying him.

“Do you think… you will have to oppose Ling Yan, since you are here in the capacity of the Holy Lord of Shadows?” The little white tiger sniggered.

Since the Temple of Shadows was supporting the Eldest Prince, then any member of the royal family apart from him was the enemy.

“…” Ye Qingtang remained silent. She picked the little white tiger by the scruff of his neck and flung him down.

Before the little white tiger could get up, Ye Qingtang’s door suddenly opened.

A furry little head peeped in through the crack.

“Ah Yao…” Ming Gu’s big black eyes shone as he gazed at Ye Qingtang.

She had just begun to unwind, but now, she could not relax anymore…
