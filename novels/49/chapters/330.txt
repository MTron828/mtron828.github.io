Chapter 331: Resentment

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It was a good day for Ye Qingtang as she obtained both first place in the assessment and the sword that she fancied. Since Qin Huan was treating, the group would obviously not stand on ceremony, and Ye Qingtang even called Lin Long as well as Yun Shu to join them as well. She had to move into the inner sect the next day and could make use of this opportunity to meet up with them.

Just as Ye Qingtang and the rest were headed for the celebration, two figures, quietly standing under a tree not far away, took in the sight.

Su Wan pursed her lips and had a complicated expression as she looked at Lu Xiuwen, who was holding onto a crutch and standing under the tree with difficulty.

After the Disciplinary Hall incident, Lu Xiuwen spent near half a month on the bed. The pain from fifty strokes of flogging caused him to be unable to participate in any cultivation for a period of time, but now…

With a body that had yet to fully recover, Lu Xiuwen walked to the outer sect, and he glared at Ye Qingtang, who was crowded by Yun Shu, Lu Xiuwen, and the rest.

“Senior Brother Lu… your injuries have not fully recovered, and you should not stand for a long time. Why don’t you head back to rest…” Su Wan said gently.

Lu Xiuwen did not reply to her, and his eyes never left Ye Qingtang’s back view.

Until Ye Qingtang completely disappeared from his line of sight, he finally said something.

“How can it be…” There was a strong restraint in his hoarse voice.

“What?” Su Wan was a little confused.

Suddenly, Lu Xiuwen clenched his fist and punched a tree branch near him heavily.

“How can Ye Qingtang possibly be first in the inner sect assessment! She is a red spirit root… How can she win against Ji Xianyuan!” Lu Xiuwen felt like he was going to have a mental breakdown.

When he was recuperating, he already heard that Ye Qingtang wanted to humiliate herself and took part in the inner sect assessment. To him, all of this was undoubtedly a big joke. He simply did not believe that Ye Qingtang had the ability to crawl into the inner sect.

However…

Never had he thought that things would actually develop to this stage!

Ye Qingtang entered the inner sect, and she really was able to get first in the assessment!

“Senior Brother Lu…” Su Wan looked at Lu Xiuwen’s ferocious expression, and fear filled her.

Senior Brother Lu, who usually appeared noble and arrogant, had a furious expression that was as frightening as a beast.

“Junior Sister Su, are you sure you didn’t hear wrong?” Lu Xiuwen asked, refusing to give up.

“Although… Although I didn’t go to the assessment site, Senior Sister Liu Yin went there personally and told me the news right after the assessment ended. When I was on the way to find you, I heard many disciples discussing it as well…” Su Wan said and pursed her lips.

Not just Lu Xiuwen, but even she completely did not expect that Ye Qingtang, the disciple with the most inferior natural endowment amongst the new disciples, would actually be the first in their batch to enter the inner sect!

Regardless of Su Wan or Lu Xiuwen, their spirit roots were way better than Ye Qingtang’s, and even their family backgrounds completely crushed the unknown Ye family of Lin Town.

However… Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yet, Ye Qingtang had become an inner sect disciple who they could only look up to in the future!

Lu Xiuwen took a deep breath and narrowed his eyes. “Junior Sister Su, help me back to my room.”

He definitely would not give up like that. Even Ye Qingtang with a red spirit root could enter the inner sect, a mighty green spirit root like him would naturally have a chance to as well!

The score between him and Ye Qingtang was not over!
