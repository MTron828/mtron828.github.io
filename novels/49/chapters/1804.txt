Ye Qingtang lifted her eyes to look at the corpse of the True God which was too big for her mind to even comprehend.

It was hard to imagine how fierce the battle between a God and a demon must have been.

Not understanding why Ye Qingtang was so stunned, the Little Heavenly Demon took this opportunity to tear off a piece of the True God’s long-rotted flesh and spat it in Ye Qingtang’s hand, as though it wanted her to roast it.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

The True God had already been dead for hundreds of thousands of years, so who knew whether its flesh could still be eaten? Furthermore, Ye Qingtang couldn’t stand the thought of consuming a True God’s flesh.

This mystic realm had already been cursed by the Cursed True God. If she ate another God’s flesh...

She would probably never get out of here. She would probably die a meaningless death as well.

“You can’t eat this. Just bear with it for a little while and I’ll get you something else to eat,” Ye Qingtang coaxed the Heavenly Demon. Ye Qingtang could only bring out huge amounts of the dried meat she had, roast them and feed them to the Heavenly Demon so that he wouldn’t grab more of the True God’s flesh.

Consuming the flesh of a god... the idea was too appalling.

Feigning a look of satisfaction as the Little Heavenly Demon shoved the dried meat in its mouth, Ye Qingtang quickly took a detour. She dared not stop for even a moment. But the sight that greeted her after she circled around the True God’s corpse stopped her in her tracks.

On the vast land behind the True God’s corpse were mounds and mounds of corpses all lying on the ground. They were all the corpses of True Gods, who had silently fallen upon this scorching land.

All this was like a nightmare.

Death surrounded her, enshrouding her in its embrace.

The war between the True Gods hundreds of thousands of years ago seemed to have decimated everything here, leaving behind a hellish and oppressive silence.

Ye Qingtang looked at the gigantic bodies in front of her. She could no longer make out what they used to look like, but was filled with awe by what was in front of her.

These were the True Gods, the creators of the humans... yet they had died in this mystic realm because of those same humans’ betrayal.

How much they must have hated the humans...

Ye Qingtang’s heart was in a turmoil. But just as Ye Qingtang was reflecting on this silently a gentle song rang out in the silent sky.

The song was like a shallow stream, singing about peace and calm.

Ye Qingtang subconsciously looked in the direction of the melody, only to be greeted by the slim figure she had seen beside the frozen river.

The figure walked slowly over the red earth, her skirt trailing behind her on the lava, unburnt. The way she walked was slow and elegant. Ye Qingtang felt a strange sense of calm wash over her as she looked at the figure.

“Who is she?” Ye Qingtang looked at the figure, her heart full of suspicion. But the song seemed to entrance her with some sort of magic, and it washed away all of Ye Qingtang’s wariness. She felt as though everything in her life was peaceful as long as she listened to the song.

A paradise without danger and death was being offered to her.

“That woman is strange. As strange as this mystic realm. I think... I think we should stay away from her,” Little White Tiger said cautiously.
