Chapter 65: The Birthday Banquet (2)

After Ye You joined the Cloud-breakers, Ye Xun could never hope to catch up to her. But in the case of Ye Qingtang, even if her strength currently exceeded hers, without a spirit root, it would be difficult for her to make further progress. Whilst Ye Xun still possessed one, that yielded the potential for limitless growth.

Thus, she did not fret about their current gap in strength, as that would certainly iron out itself in the days to come.

Ye Xun was clear on the fact that her spirit root being intact was more important to Duan Tianrao.

Regardless of Ye Qingtang’s beauty, she could be considered a handicapped person.

The Duan household would never allow a lady without a spirit root to become the wife of their heir to the household.

With that in mind, Ye Xun turned her gaze towards Duan Tianrao standing beside her. From his eyes, Ye Xun could discern that he held praise and affection for her.

“Xun-er, you’ve done well. Let’s train together and we can better improve ourselves in the future.” Duan Tianrao suggested with a smile.

Ye Xun nodded meekly.

And while they were still mingling around with the guests, one of the guardsmen rushed into the hall suddenly.

“My Lord and Elders, the Marquis of the City of Luoxing, his Lordship Mu Su, has arrived!”

In an instant, the entire hall erupted into a frenzy over the announcement.

The Marquis of the City of Luoxing!! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Mu Su was a renowned dignitary that almost everyone in this world would have heard of his name.

The City of Luoxing, though a city by the marches, was a powerhouse, that even compelled the Imperial Emperor to give his good graces when faced with Mu Su’s presence. Mu Su himself, was a man possessing unfathomable powers, pledging his service to the Temple of Ancient Splendor. The common people would never in their lives get to meet a dignitary as powerful as him, in the flesh.

And no one could have expected such a dignitary to show up personally at the Ye’s residence!

All eyes were on the Great Elder at this moment.

Today is the Great Elder’s birthday. Maybe Mu Su is here to give him his best wishes for his birthday?

No one in the City of Lin could have hoped to get acquainted with Mu Su, except for Ye You, who had just joined the Cloud-breakers, and would be deemed worthy and plausible of meeting his acquaintance.

“Grandpa, Sis must have been the one to invite his Lordship here, to celebrate your birthday on her behalf.” When the thought crossed her mind, Ye Xun spoke up with a smile in an instant.

The Great Elder was shocked by the announcement as well, but when he realized all eyes were on him, mostly green with envy, he came to his senses in a jiffy, “I’ve not heard of this from her though.”

“Then she must have arranged this as a surprise for you, because who else could have the means to invite his Lordship?” Ye Xun replied, all excited.

After pondering for a moment, the Great Elder determined that only his granddaughter could have indeed made such an arrangement, and a radiant smile blossomed on his face.

Mu Su’s arrival came as an unexpected surprise.

It even shocked Ye Ling and the Second Elder, who had been uninterested in the whole birthday event.

“Why did his Lordship visit us so suddenly?” Ye Ling was quite perturbed.

The Second Elder furrowed his brow and said: “Though we are one of the noble houses in this city, but surely we’re as insignificant as the common rabble before his Lordship. His purpose for this sudden visit is certainly a mystery.”

“You reckon he’s here at Ye You’s request?” Ye Ling raised a matter of concern.

“That could be the case.”

Ye Qingtang continued to indulge in her snacks while she watched their solemn expressions with a mischievous gleam in her eyes, saying: “Father, Uncle. You don’t have to get so worked up.”
