Ye Qingtang smiled. “Yun Chen is not my only student. If I go over to the medicine faculty, won’t I have to abandon the rest of my students?”

After all, Yun Chen alone was not enough for her to join the Inter-Academy Competition and obtain the Wind-Calming Pearl to leave this domain.

Ye Qingtang did not forget that she was a wanted person by the Temple of Paragon. Who knew if they were searching all over for her right now. Leaving this domain as soon as possible was more important to her now than anything.

The reincarnation of the Holy Lord? She had to distance herself from them as much as possible!

Ye Qingtang had her reasons but the eyes of the little brats filled with hot tears when they heard her words. Extremely touched, they stared at Ye Qing with watery eyes.

Ye Qingtang: “...”

She tried to ignore those emotional faces.

Teacher Luo frowned slightly. He didn’t expect Ye Qing to reject him because of this reason.

He wanted to continue persuading Ye Qing but the Vice-President spoke up. “Even if Ye Qing doesn’t join the medicine faculty, I am sure he won’t just stand by and do nothing if there are other people in the medicine faculty with the same problem as Yun Chen, right?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The Vice-President was looking at Ye Qing as he spoke.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

After getting this guarantee, Teacher Luo didn’t continue pursuing the matter.

Anyway, the main appeal of Ye Qing to the medicine faculty was her ability to help out with the bloodline issue. Since she was willing to help, it didn’t matter whether or not she joined the faculty.

After Teacher Luo left, the Vice-President gave a few instructions to Ye Qing before leaving with Teacher Luo Sheng.

Once they had left, Nangong Lie and the rest surrounded Ye Qing.

“The medicine faculty folks are just a bunch of fools! Our Boss’ elixir-refining abilities are so awesome, but they want him to be warden? Dream on!” Lei Yan snorted.

Nangong Lie grinned as he hustled over to stand in front of Ye Qing. “Boss, you can’t bear to leave this group of handsome, dashing, valiant teenagers, right?”

In response, Ye Qingtang replied with a smack across his face.

“Stop fooling around. I have instructions for you.” Ye Qing’s tone was serious.

Now that the medicine faculty had been settled, according to her estimations, Zhang Qiqiu should have already ingested the elixir and his bloodline would recover in a few days.

Ye Qingtang was not really too bothered by either of those two things. She had a more pressing issue to settle. And that was to increase the powers of this bunch of brats before the Inter-Academy Competition!

“I have a list here. Go back and prepare a set each. Remember to inform Qin Feng,” Ye Qingtang instructed as she handed copies of the list to the teenagers.

Lei Yan and the rest scanned the list and realized that the items on it were rather peculiar. They could not understand why these things were needed.

“Boss, why do you want us to prepare these items?” Nangong Lie realized that the list included a tent.

Did Boss want them to set up camp at the Vice-President’s?

“Go back and prepare. In a few days, I will bring you guys out for training,” Ye Qingtang replied.

She had already made careful calculations. If she wanted to improve their powers to a satisfactory level before the Inter-Academy Competition, it was impossible for them to remain on campus.

True powers were honed from real battles, not mere shadow-boxing in a practice arena.
