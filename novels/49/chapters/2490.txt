The Yongle Tribe General did not know why the soul that the Ancestor had him revive would punch him after waking up. If it was not a soul that belonged to the Ancestor, he would have crushed this skin bag before it could even touch him. However, this belonged to the Ancestor, so the Yongle Tribe General just stood where he was without any resistance.

Fortunately, the vessel was only as powerful as an ant. No matter what it did, it would not pose any threat to him.

The Blood Moon Elder seemed to be caught in the memory of the moments just before he died in the First Mainland. He did not comprehend his current situation at all. He only remembered that the Holy Lady had instructed him to block the path of those powerful figures from the Ancient You Clan no matter what and not let them pass.

He had been by Ye Qingtang’s side for so long and she had treated him well. It was no exaggeration to say that it had been the equivalent of granting him a whole new meaning to life. Moreover, he had long treated Ye Qingtang, the Holy Lady, as the most important kin in his life. This was even though he did not have any real family nor any children. He also did not really understand the bond of kinship.

But perhaps, he and Ye Qingtang had unknowingly become family without any blood relations.

This was the first time the Holy Lady had given him such a serious task. No matter what, even if he had to give up his life, he had to complete his mission!

“Take another punch from me!”

The Blood Moon Elder shouted angrily as he punched the Yongle Tribe General’s face. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The Yongle Tribe General continued to stand there and stare quietly at the middle-aged man.

“My… My hand…”

The Blood Moon Elder gritted his teeth. This handsome and evil-looking man actually had such great strength and a high cultivation level. Not only was he unharmed from his full force attack, his fist felt like it had nearly shattered…

Was this still a human? Could it be possessed by a demon?

How did the Ancient You Clan have such a terrifying powerful figure?!

“Excuse me, are you done punching?” The Yongle Tribe General looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

A cold glint appeared in the Blood Moon Elder’s eyes when he heard what the Yongle Tribe General said. “So, you mean to humiliate me?”

“You are still caught in the moment right before you died. Ancestor asked me to revive you.” The Yongle Tribe General explained to the Blood Moon Elder.

“Died… revive?” The Blood Moon Elder had a strange expression. He did not know what this unbelievably powerful man meant.

“Hong Heqing, stop,” Ye Qingtang shouted at the Blood Moon Elder from behind.

The Blood Moon Elder found this voice both very familiar and yet somewhat unfamiliar. It sounded as if it had just been ringing in his ears yesterday, but also as if he had not heard it for a long time. For a moment there, the Blood Moon Elder was dumbstruck.

Turning around stiffly, the Blood Moon Elder met Ye Qingtang’s gaze.

“Eh… you… are you the Holy Lady’s older or younger brother? You look so alike…”

The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang with a strange expression. Were they twins?

Ye Qingtang, “…” Didn’t the Blood Moon Elder see her in disguise as a man before? And he still could not recognize her?

“Ancestor, as I said before, he has been dead for too long and has just been resurrected. His memories will be slightly chaotic and mixed-up. This is quite normal,” the Yongle Tribe General explained to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded, indicating her understanding.
