Chapter 1973: Male Pet (2)

Ye Qingtang didn’t even spare a glance at him. She was too busy looking at the patrol of Undead Clan guards outside. Seeing that nothing seemed out of place, she retracted her gaze and closed the door.

“Holy Lord, I am beyond grateful to you for taking in the people of the Eternal Dynasty. If this is how the Holy Lord wants me to repay my debt, I will gladly do so.” Ling Yan’s voice floated into her ears.

What debt?

Ye Qingtang was utterly confused and turned to say a few words to him when she suddenly saw...

Ling Yan was lying on her bed, his neat clothes pulled open, revealing his white neck and collarbones.

She was speechless.

How had she thrown him onto the bed?

“What is the Holy Lord waiting for? I’m ready.” Ling Yan blinked at her suggestively and pulled at his clothes draped over his shoulder.

Ye Qingtang stared at him wordlessly.

Could he please be more decent!

“Stop that at once.” Seeing that he was about to strip completely, she quickly rushed over and pulled his clothes back together.

In the end...

“D*mnit! Are the two of you that deprived? Little White Tiger who had come out after hearing noises from the room looked at the two of them tangled on the bed in surprise.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was pressed on top of Ling Yan, pulling on his clothes with a fierce expression. The scene looked extremely suggestive.

“Well, I’ll make space for the two of you then.” Little White Tiger sighed and turned to leave.

It was time for that again.

“Wait-” Before Ye Qingtang could finish her sentence, Little White Tiger had slipped away silently.

She was speechless.

What the hell was this!

What had she done!

“Holy Lord?” Ling Yan smiled as he looked at the masked Ye Qingtang.

She quickly regained her wits, smacked Ling Yan on the head and stood to the side like he had some kind of disease.

“Godd*mnit, wear your clothes properly or I’ll throw you out.” Every time she looked at Ling Yan, it just made her head hurt. Was this idiot here to help her or annoy her?

“Hm? Does the Holy Lord no longer want me? What a pity.” Ling Yan sat up with a face of regret and adjusted his clothes.

“Call me Holy Lord another time and I will make sure you can’t get up again.” Ye Qingtang glared and shook her fists at him.

Ling Yan smiled and said, “I wouldn’t mind if you were so good I couldn’t get up after.”

Ye Qingtang let out a pained cry and covered her ears.

What was she hearing?

It was lucky that she still had her mask on, or her beet-red face would have been revealed... Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“What did you need me for? Spit it out if you have something to say,” she quickly said to shut his liberal mouth up.

Ling Yan chuckled. Ye Qingtang’s expression was enough for him to stop teasing her.

“I guess you’re worried about the situation with the Ancient You Clan?”

“Are you not? How could you not be when you’ve crammed all the people from the Eternal Dynasty into the Temple of Shadows?” Ye Qingtang said.

The smile on Ling Yan’s face vanished as she looked at her.

D*mn, that was too much.

“The Ancient You Clan is already so powerful that no one in the Central Mainland can go against them. Why not turn to the Second Domain?” Ling Yan asked.
