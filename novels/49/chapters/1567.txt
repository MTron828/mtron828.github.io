Chapter 1568 Oh My 1

Elder Qian and Elder Kun left the martial hall and headed straight to the public square to check if their disciples were working hard on their cultivation.Many Jiang Family youths in the public square were drenched with sweat as they cultivated diligently.The remaining elders were supervising their cultivation and nodded to greet Elder Qian and Elder Kun.

However, at this instant, a gust of wind rushed into the entrance of Taiyuan Valley. Everyone looked in that direction immediately and saw a lady in red whizzing in like a ball of fire.

The elders’ expressions darkened immediately.

That lady landed on the ground slowly. She was an extremely gorgeous lady whose face had a combination of wildness, allure, and arrogance. Her red clothes swayed in the wind like a blazing flame and hugged her graceful figure.

“How do I address you, miss? What are you here at the Taiyuan Valley for?” Elder Qian stood forward and asked the gorgeous lady.

The lady squinted her eyes slightly. Her slightly-lifted chin exuded a hint of arrogance while her furrowed brows seemed to be laced with impatience and anxiety. Her eyes scanned past everyone in the square before she subsequently asked.

“Does this place belong to the Domain Monarch Jiang Family?”

The lady’s voice was filled with impatience.

“Yes,” Elder Qin said.

“That’s right then.” The lady nodded and said with arched brows. “Where is the wife of your Domain Monarch Founder!”

Everyone was stunned by what she said as they did not know where this lady came from or what she wanted. However, Elder Qian’s face darkened after he heard her.

“Miss, our Domain Monarch Founder’s wife has already passed ten thousand years ago.”

What exactly is this lady here for?

The lady was not at all surprised by the reply and merely raised her brow slightly. “Did your Domain Monarch Founder remarry afterward then?”

The lady’s impolite tone caused the elders’ expression to blacken, and they began to speak in a dissatisfied tone as well.

“The Domain Monarch Founder loves his wife very deeply and did not remarry after she died.”

“That’s good then.” The lady seemed to be completely ignorant of the displeasure in the elders’ tone. She looked around her surroundings and said subsequently, “I heard that your Domain Monarch Founder has returned to the Jiang Family and has come to this Taiyuan Valley. Go and call him out for me.”

The elders were angered by the lady’s arrogant words.

The Jiang Family youths were still unaware of the Domain Monarch Founder’s return and were extremely shocked to hear the news. It must be known that to these Jiang Family youths, the Domain Monarch Founder was an extremely mighty presence and was a powerful figure in their hearts. He was someone who many people respected deeply.

Now that they knew that the Domain Monarch Founder had returned, they were extremely furious to see a lady who was so rude to him.

“Who is she? How dare she tell our Domain Monarch Founder to come out and meet her?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Where did this crazy woman come from? Just chase her away quickly.”

The elders’ expressions were nowhere better either. They only treated her courteously because they saw that she came here alone and that she was a lady. Yet, she turned out to be incredibly arrogant and irreverent!

“What exactly are you here for? The Domain Monarch Founder of the Jiang Family is not someone you can meet just because you want to! I advise you to leave immediately. Otherwise, I can only chase you out using force!” Elder Kun scoffed coldly.
