Yet another lead had come to a dead end.

Ye Qingtang gave an inward sigh. Just as she was about to order her men to look over the bodies again, one of the ancient clan elders suddenly spoke up.

“Holy Lord, this symbol looks very strange.”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

“Speak.”

The elder didn’t know how to explain it. Instead, he copied the symbol on a piece of paper, before adding a few strokes to the drawing. As the elder added more strokes, the faces of the crowd changed.

“This... isn’t this the family crest of the Ancient You Clan?!” One of the clan leaders widened his eyes in astonishment after the elder finished his drawing.

“That’s right. I initially found the symbol rather familiar, but couldn’t understand why. But then I suddenly realized that this symbol is quite similar to the family crest of the Ancient You Clan,” the elder explained.

“I heard before that the Ancient You Clan secretly groomed a batch of kamikaze soldiers. They were all exemplary youths selected from the various branches of the Ancient You Clan. The youths were brought to an unknown place for special training. Even their own parents don’t know where they were taken...” Another ancient clan leader frowned as he spoke.

It was common knowledge that the various ancient clans would secretly cultivate talented members of their own. Most of this training was done in secret, and they would be put into service for the family clan after their training was completed.

Most of the ancient clans would mark those youths with a special symbol during training, which also contained a curse. The youth would suffer a massive counterforce if he tried to betray the clan.

After all, the ancient clans spent massive amounts of time and effort in grooming those youths. It would be a great loss to them if the youth decided to betray them.

“Don’t tell me that those two youths were kamikaze soldiers groomed by the Ancient You Clan? The Ancient You Clan wanted to rob us of our Spirit of Chaos fragments?”

Everyone was stunned by this conjecture.

“How could that be? How could the Ancient You Clan have groomed such powerful practitioners?”

The powers of the various ancient clans were more or less equivalent to each other. It was incomprehensible to them that the Ancient You Clan was able to groom such devastatingly formidable practitioners.

Moreover, those youths were still very young, looking to be in their early teens. Even the most gifted child would not be able to attain such great powers within such a short period of time.

A furious discussion broke out amongst the crowd. Only Ye Qingtang remained quietly pensive.

Ancient You Clan...

Others might not believe that the Ancient You Clan could become so powerful in such a short period.

But Ye Qingtang knew very well that it was possible!

This was simply because of Little You Yun.

The Ancient You Clan had kidnapped Little You Yun in the First Mainland. And Little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode was exceedingly powerful.

Linking the strange things occurring in the Ancient You Clan in Central Mainland recently, plus the symbols on these two youths—Ye Qingtang could more or less confirm that the Ancient You Clan was behind it all!

“No need to guess anymore.” Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke out.

“Holy Lord?” The crowd stared at Ye Qingtang in confusion.

“The Ancient You Clan is behind all of this.”

“But...” Many of the ancient clan members were not convinced.

Ye Qingtang cut them off and continued. “Before you say anything, you should first think carefully about the recent actions of the Ancient You Clan.”
