“You dare to resist?”

‘The Feng Yun family fighter was taken aback.

To think that a woman from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain actually dared to attack a Feng Yun family fighter!

“Ljust wanted to teach you a lesson, but now, since you like the Divine Venerate Domain so much, you can stay here forever. Kill her,” the white-robed elder from the Feng Yun family ordered.

Apart from a portion of the Feng Yun fighters who were guarding the Feng Family, the rest of them instantly attacked Ye Qingtang.

“You think too highly of yourself.”

Ye Qingtang snorted at what was happening.

With that one snort, the faces of the dozen over cultivators from the Feng Yun Family turned pale as they spat out mouthfuls of blood.

“This...!”

Everyone, including the Feng family, was stunned. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

‘What kind of power was this? Just one snort was enough to make the Feng Yun Family fighters vomit blood and lose their combat strength!

Ye Qingtang ignored the Feng Yun Family fighters and instead looked at the elder in white. She said calmly, “You can come at me altogether.”

“It seems I have underestimated you.”

The white-robed elder’s eyes flickered coldly. Although this woman came from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, her martial skills were not weak. She was probably considered one of the strongest in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

“Little girl, this is the Divine Venerate Domain. Do you think the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain is comparable?” The elder in white roared. He raised his right arm and swung it towards Ye Qingtang.

An indescribably terrifying aura erupted from the white-robed elder’s body. The aura of an Eight Heaven level Divine Lord flared out as if he was an invincible war god. Just looking at him with the naked eye made everyone from the Feng family extremely frightened.

In the next second, a golden palm imprint over a hundred feet long appeared in the sky. It covered the entire Feng family and harbored an extremely powerful destructive force.

“This is bad!”

The Feng Family patriarch was shocked at the sight. This was the ultimate killing move of that white-robed elder. Its power was extremely strong and no ordinary people would be able to resist. They would be annihilated.

Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground with her hands behind her back. Her long black hair flowed in the wind. There was no emotion in her eyes.

Just as the golden palm was about to land, everyone saw Ye Qingtang raise her right arm. Before anyone knew what happened, the golden palm suddenly turned into golden bubbles and disappeared with the wind.

“What?!”

The white-robed elder found it unbelievable.

His Eighth Heaven Level Divine Lord ultimate move was so easily broken by that woman from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain?!

“Kill her!”

‘The elder in white roared and a divine weapon condensed from Divine Lord power appeared in his hand. He slashed at Ye Qingtang.

“Are you still not giving up?”

Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground and glanced at the elder in white indifferently.

‘When the white-robed elder was only a few inches away from Ye Qingtang, he brought down the divine weapon heavily on Ye Qingtang.

However, Ye Qingtang did not have any intention of dodging. With a wave of her arm, the divine weapon shattered into pieces.

Before the elder could react, Ye Qingtang pointed at his left abdomen.

With a loud “boom’, the elder spat out a large mouthful of blood and staggered back several steps. He flew back straight into the group of Feng Yun Family members, knocking several fighters, who had wanted to support the elder, to the ground..
