Ye Qingtang frowned and could not believe that the two influential people of the Nine Nights Dynasty would chop off their own heads instantly…

The two Falling Sky Valley disciples walked towards the temple at the same time.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered and pulled the two people back immediately.

She would not bother about the well-being of strangers, but the two people in front of her were the disciples of the Falling Sky Valley.

The Falling Sky Valley was significant to her. She did not want the Falling Sky Valley disciples to commit suicide by going to the temple. Those who were dead served as an example.

Both Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder were full of experience, and they could tell from the things that happened just now that there was something peculiar with the temple in front.

However, the moment she held the two Falling Sky Valley disciples back, she was shocked.

Their strength was immense, and her hands were deflected immediately.

“Move away!”

One of the Falling Sky Valley disciples turned over. His eyes were fierce and evil. He stared deadly at Ye Qingtang and shouted in anger.

“He did not lose his consciousness?”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with astonishment for a second as she could not understand the situation.

Ye Qingtang thought that those who committed suicide lost their consciousness due to some unknown evil spirits inside the temple. She believed that that was the reason why they did not know what they were doing.

However, Ye Qingtang noticed that the two Falling Sky Valley disciples did not seem to lose their consciousness…

The two Falling Sky Valley disciples arrived at the front of the temple in a split second.

The two of them kneed down and kowtowed.

Clank!

Clank!

Suddenly, the two Falling Sky Valley disciples pulled their swords out by their waists.

“Those who are sinned deserve to die! There is no amnesty!”

The things happened next shocked the Blood Moon Elder and Ye Qingtang again.

The two Falling Sky Valley disciples wielded their swords at the same time and chopped down towards each other’s head after they shouted.

It happened so fast that Ye Qingtang could not stop them in time.

Puff!

Puff!

At the next second, the intense odor of blood spread out. The two heads were chopped off and flew into the air. A large amount of blood spurted out from their neck and dropped onto the ground like raindrops.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she saw the two corpses that collapsed onto the ground instantly. Though she intended to save the two Falling Sky Valley disciples, she could not do anything to help as she did not expect their moves.

“Holy Lady, the temple is definitely odd.” The Blood Moon Elder’s expression was serious.

“Leave!”

The temple was odd. Those who approached died miserably even though they were Martial Qi Level Three cultivators.

Ye Qingtang did not hesitate and decided to leave immediately.

The Blood Moon Elder’s face was pale. He had been everywhere a thousand years ago, but he had never witnessed such horrifying things.

They ran for a few thousand meters before they stopped.

“Finally, we manage to escape…” The Blood Moon Elder sighed.

The Hell of Avicinaraka was full of risks and was too dangerous. It would be extremely difficult to survive for half a month inside.

“Holy…”

The Blood Moon Elder was about to say something to Ye Qingtang, but his face changed the moment he turned over.

There was a temple in front of them… and there were countless of headless corpses around…
