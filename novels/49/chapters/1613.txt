Chapter 1614: Monster (2)

Fortunately...

Fortunately...

Tang had not summoned this monster to deal with them. Or else...

When they thought of how they had jeered and sneered at Ye Qingtang earlier, Joseph and the others felt cold prickles down their spines. It was as if they had challenged a demon. They wished they could slap themselves.

Outside the fortress, the ten thousand demoralized soldiers who were prepared to die were also dumbfounded. They stared as the nearby enemy troops were swallowed by the black flames. They felt as though they were living in a dream. They could not stop rubbing their eyes in disbelief.

Previously, they felt that His Majesty the King was forcing them to their doom by sending this young girl who had never been on the battlefield.

But they had not thought that...

She was not a young girl.

She was a monster!

The five-hundred-thousand-strong army was not even able to fight and was simply engulfed by the black flames. Endless moans and screams filled their ears. It was spine-chilling.

As the black flames spread, the five-hundred-thousand-strong army, the Glorious Lions, and the black witches were all completely reduced to ashes...

As the last wail disappeared in the black flames, Ye Qingtang crooked her finger. The black flame phoenix in the horizon and the black flames that covered the ground were instantly drawn back into her fingertips by her power, vanishing without a trace.

All that was left on the battlefield was a mountain of ashes. Not even bone fragments remained.

The violent wind whooshed past, and the ashes were caught up in the wind, scattering across the spacious battlefield...

There were no bodies and no battle. There was no scent of blood. Only the stench of ashes was carried to their nostrils by the wind.

On the battlefield, only a single proud figure was left standing in the wind.

“The allied forces have been defeated. Have we won? We don’t need to die anymore?” Someone in the ten-thousand-strong troop suddenly grasped this crucial point. Amidst the shock, his despair gradually dissipated and was replaced by the wild joy of survival.

“We’ve won!”

“Knight Tang is awesome!”

“Knight Tang is awesome!!!”

The ten thousand soldiers who had managed to survive immediately cheered. They were not afraid to fight, but they did not want to be the sacrificial lambs in a doomed situation.

If they could survive to fight another day, who would be willing to die?

Waves of cheers filled the air.

The soldiers who had survived rushed towards Ye Qingtang. In their eyes, she was a hero, and they celebrated by tossing her in the air.

But after personally witnessing this young girl’s power, their hearts were filled with respect and gratitude.

When they recalled how they had reproached Ye Qingtang and mistrusted her, they were so ashamed that they wanted to dig a hole in the ground and burrow into it.

“I deserve to die. I actually doubted Knight Tang’s abilities.”

“We were really too ignorant. How could His Majesty the King send us to die so easily? His Majesty must have been fully prepared when he appointed Knight Tang to lead the troops.”

“His Majesty the King is wise! Knight Tang is awesome!”

What did they have to fear with a powerful Kingdom Knight like Ye Qingtang before them?

So what if the opposing side had fifty times more soldiers? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

One must consider that in this battle, Ye Qingtang had single-handedly demolished the five hundred thousand soldiers of the allied forces!

That was a difference of five hundred thousand times!

Joseph and the others who were on the city wall could not help but gulp when they saw the soldiers cheering for Ye Qingtang.
