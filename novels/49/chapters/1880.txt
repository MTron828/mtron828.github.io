Just as Long Yao was agonizing over this, the unconscious Long Xiao let out a low moan.

Spinning her head quickly, Long Yao turned to look at her brother. Even though he had regained consciousness, his complexion still looked terrible.

“Elder brother!” Long Yao’s face brightened as she saw her brother wake up.

“Yao’er...” Long Xiao’s sharp brows and handsome face looked weak from his deathly-pale complexion.

“Elder brother, you’re finally awake. You’ve scared me to death.”

It took Long Xiao great effort to open his mouth but his half-open eyes were still bright.

“Have the people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley caught up with us?” Long Xiao asked.

Long Yao shook her head. Just as she was about to tell him about the black mist, he smiled slightly and said, “What you want to say is, not yet, right?”

A short nod came from his sister.

Pulling himself up, Long Xiao ignored the painful injuries all over his body. His black hair hung by his side. Against his deathly pale face, it made his beautiful features look slightly demonic.

“I know how the Ten Thousand Poison Valley works, they won’t let us off so easily. With the numbers they had, killing us wasn’t impossible. They only let us go so that they could find Aunt Jiu.”

Long Xiao narrowed his eyes. Even though he was weak, the weakness did not show in his eyes, which were clear and bright.

“Yao’er, have you found the whereabouts of Aunt Jiu yet?” Long Xiao’s eyes changed as he looked at her with anticipation.

Long Yao shook her head. “I showed Fu Qiu the photo but it refused to say anything.”

“Fu Qiu’s guard is still up against us. The person who followed Aunt Jiu into the mystic realm left halfway and delivered her letter to us... otherwise, there was no way we would’ve known about what was inside this mystic realm. Fu Qiu isn’t saying anything as it fears that we will harm Aunt Jiu.” Long Xiao was intelligent and quickly realized the reason behind Fu Qiu’s silence.

“Bring me to him,” Long Xiao got off the bed painstakingly. His hurried actions pained Long Yao.

It wouldn’t be long before the Ten Thousand Poison Valley would find them. He needed to find Aunt Jiu as soon as possible.

Long Xiao went to find Fu Qiu with Long Yi supporting him.

Fu Qiu’s heart was a little moved when it saw Long Xiao and the rest but its expression remained unchanged.

Long Xiao didn’t beat about the bush. He took a beautifully intricate box out of his space ring and opened it in front of Fu Qiu.

Inside the box was a breathtaking jade pendant.

The jade pendant was the same as the one hanging on Ye Qingtang’s neck.

Fu Qiu froze as it saw the jade pendant. Its subtle change in expression didn’t escape the notice of Long Xiao.

“Our clan is the only one with this jade pendant,” Long Xiao said as he bit his nail hurriedly. A drop of blood dripped onto the jade pendant.

The jade pendant glowed as his blood touched it and a totem appeared above the pendant.

“Aunt Jiu entered this mystic realm many years ago with the pendant around her neck. I know you want to protect Aunt Jiu, and I’m grateful for that. She’s extremely important to us, and we’ve been looking for her all these years. We want to find and protect her too...” Long Xiao knew Fu Qiu’s concerns and wasn’t in a hurry to let it speak. He wanted to allay its suspicions first.
