Chapter 1100 I Will Certainly Protect You (2)

Though everyone in the Falling Sky Valley was very anxious, they knew clearly that their abilities were incomparable with the ancient clan figures’. They could not do anything and had to retreat and keep a safe distance away from them.

The entire square was empty instantly.

After settling the two children, Ye Qingtang was ready to walk forward.

However, before she could walk out, the boy suddenly hugged her leg.

Ye Qingtang paused and looked down at the little figure who was hugging her leg.

The boy’s eyes were filled with concern and anxiety. It seemed like he did not want Ye Qingtang to leave and hugged her leg even more tightly.

A smile filled Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she saw the anxiety on the little boy’s face.

She was never the target of concern in the past.

Before Ye Qingtang could ask the little boy to release his hand, the little girl, who was standing at the side, suddenly ran over and mimicked the boy’s movement to hug Ye Qingtang’s other leg.

Ye Qingtang suddenly did not know how to react as she stared at the two children who were hugging her legs and did not want her to leave.

Did the two little children really recognize her as their mother?

“Mo… mother… Scared…” The boy’s eyes sparkled as he mumbled.

“Protect her. I will be back soon, okay?” Ye Qingtang looked at the boy kindly and gently touched his head.

“Yes…”

Though the child was not very willing to let go, eventually he nodded. He released Ye Qingtang and stood beside the girl.

Ye Qingtang stood up as the softness in her eyes was replaced by a trace of malice.

Ye Qingtang turned into a shadow instantly and disappeared.

The moment when Ye Qingtang left, one of the ancient clan figures suddenly appeared from a corner and came to the boy and the girl.

“E-I…”

A black glint exploded from the boy’s eyes as he sensed the intention of the man. His body was filled with intense fiend aura.

The fiend aura was like a deep whirlpool that caused the ancient clan figure to retreat backward.

“Not bad…”

The ancient clan figure’s eyes sparkled as he sensed the power of the fiend aura. The power of Yang Lord suddenly arose, and the fiend aura was dispersed. He stretched his hand towards the boy.

However, at the same time, a sword shadow suddenly flashed across together with a terrifying sword aura.

“Puff!”Before the ancient clan figure could understand the situation, his right arm was chopped off by the sword breath.

“Ah…”

The ancient clan figure screamed and stepped back.

The Heaven-level divine weapon, Regicide Sky Blade, landed from the air and pierced into the ground, in front of the boy and the girl. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Divine King Luo Xue’s… Heaven level divine weapon, Regicide Sky Blade…” The ancient clan figure gritted his teeth as he stared at the sword. He tried to stop the bleeding of his arm and did not dare to get close.

Ye Qingtang did not leave the place as she planned to hide in the dark to see if anyone would sneak attack.

The result was as she had expected.

However… she did not expect that the Divine King Luo Xue’s Regicide Sky Blade would suddenly appear and protect the two children.
