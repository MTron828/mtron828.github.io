“Miss.”

Just as Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, the white-haired elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan interrupted her thoughts.

Ye Qingtang instinctively looked up at him.

She smiled at him. “Senior, what can I do for you?”

The white-haired elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan shook his head. He studied Ye Qingtang for a few seconds before saying, “May I know where you are from? Are you a native of the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain?”

Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment before shaking her head. “Senior, to be honest, I am not from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain but the Blue Sky Domain. I just came to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain not long ago.”

“Blue Sky Domain?”

The white-haired elder frowned slightly when he heard Ye Qingtang’s words. Surprise appeared in his eyes.

There were currently three domains in this world and they were also categorized into three major martial arts civilizations. These three domains were the First Domain’s Blue Sky Domain, the Second Domain’s Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and the Third Domain’s Divine Venerate Domain.

Among them, the Blue Sky Domain had the least number of continents and their martial arts culture was very backward. In fact, in the eyes of the various major factions in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, the people and things in the Blue Sky Domain were not even worth mentioning. The Blue Sky Domain had very few martial arts resources, so it was impossible for any true experts to appear.

The white-haired elder sized up Ye Qingtang and said, “The Blue Sky Domain is very far from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. There is also an extremely dangerous barrier in the middle. I wonder how Miss Ye came to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain from the Blue Sky Domain?”

Ye Qingtang smiled. “It was a coincidence. As for the natural barrier you mentioned, I only knew that it was extremely dangerous after passing over. I might have just been lucky and did not suffer any fatal injuries.”

“Oh…”

The white-haired elder had some suspicions about what Ye Qingtang was telling him.

Even if they disregarded the wide distance between the Blue Sky Domain and the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, the woman in front of him was at the Fifth Heaven Divine Lord level. She did not seem to be from the Blue Sky Domain.

“Miss, how old are you now?” The elder suddenly changed the topic.

However, before Ye Qingtang could say anything, the elder lifted her arm with a thoughtful expression.

Ye Qingtang knew this elder was determining her age. It was similar to the way the Temple of Paragon judged her age.

“I see. Miss Ye is not very old but is about the same age as the younger disciples of my Dragon Emperor Clan.” After a long time, the white-haired elder moved his hand away and sized up Ye Qingtang again.

“Are your parents still alive?” The white-haired elder continued.

Ye Qingtang stared at the white-haired elder and said softly, “To tell you the truth, I haven’t seen my parents since I was young. I only have an adoptive father. I was adopted and raised by him from a young age.”

The white-haired elder was deep in thought after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words. He did not speak further.

Seeing that the elder was silent, Ye Qingtang relaxed a little and gazed out of the window.

After about half a day later, the faint sound of thunder rang out from outside the carriage. Ye Qingtang looked out and saw that the flying demon had arrived at the foot of a huge black mountain.

The black mountain in front of them blotted out the sky and sun. One couldn’t even see its peak at all.. Black lightning flashed everywhere, which would occasionally erupt violently and unleash deafening sounds that would terrify a weaker being.
