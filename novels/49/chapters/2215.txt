Speechless, Ye Qing looked down at Lei Yan, whose leg was caught on a tree branch.

Lei Yan turned to look before awkwardly climbing down from Ye Qing’s body.

“You’re afraid of ghosts?” Ye Qing looked at Lei Yan incredulously.

The question made Lei Yan feel like burying his head in his chest.

Ye Qing: “...”

My goodness! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

There were all sorts of alien races in the Second Domain, their numbers on par with that of the human population. Apart from the Undead Clan and those other races associated with death, there was also one called the Ghost Clan.

The Netherworld Academy had people from the Ghost Clan. Although they were different from those ghosts that you heard of in stories, Lei Yan had been in the Netherworld Academy for so long that he must have encountered some folks from the Ghost Clan.

But he...

He was afraid of ghosts?

Ye Qingtang quietly shook her head as she looked at the tall, burly Lei Yan.

It turned out his burly stature was just for show.

...

Ye Qingtang and her group traveled in the Evil Soul Forest for a long time. They suddenly heard a faint, strange noise drifting over from somewhere nearby.

Lei Yan had been crouching the entire journey, feeling a desperate urge to just climb onto Nangong Lie’s back.

On the contrary, the youngest of them all, Mu Ziying showed no fear. Instead, she surveyed this spooky environment with wide, curious eyes.

“Can you please stop clinging onto me? Do you know how heavy you are?” Nangong Lie was feeling suffocated by Lei Yan.

Lei Yan’s face was green. No matter how much Nangong Lie scolded him, he refused to loosen his grip.

“You are a big man, what are you afraid of? This godforsaken place has been desolate for such a long time. Even if there were souls here, they would have already disappeared with the wind. Can you please calm down,” Nangong Lie said.

“Really?” Dazed with fear, Lei Yan looked at Nangong Lie with skeptical eyes.

“Really. Even more real than real gold...” Nangong Lie rolled his eyes.

He had also been quite scared initially. But on seeing Lei Yan’s foolish antics, he suddenly didn’t feel that afraid anymore.

Still skeptical, Lei Yan finally loosened his grip slightly. Before Lei Yan could calm down, a sudden shriek sounded out from nearby.

It was an ear-piercing shriek.

Thereafter, a strange bestial roar rang out.

No one could tell what kind of beast it was from that roar. It was full of power but also somewhat illusory.

“What... what was that noise?” Lei Yan was stupefied.

Ye Qingtang did not react to that shriek but her eyes glinted after that beastly roar.

Before those greenhorn teenagers could understand what was going on, the thick stench of blood permeated the air. A figure was sprinting toward them.

“Help... help! Save me!” Noticing Ye Qingtang and her group, the person, who had been dashing here and dare, immediately raced toward them like they were his final hope.

“What’s going on? There are humans here?” Nangong Lie didn’t expect to see humans in the Evil Soul Forest.

Wasn’t this place a forbidden area?

“He looks like someone from Spy Cloud.” Qin Feng narrowed his eyes.

Spy Cloud was a mysterious faction in the Second Domain. This faction had only one principle—Money above all.

They were a faction that was only concerned with profits.

Spy Cloud members were spread across all corners of the Second Domain.. As long as you could pay, Spy Cloud would do anything for you, and help you attain anything you wanted.
