Chapter 899 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (3)

“Let… let him go!” Feng Wudang was pinned to the ground and in such pain that he could not move. He tried his best to clamber off the ground and stop everything.

“Let him go?” Feng Wuya swept a glance at Feng Wudang and said smilingly. “No problem…”

The next second, Feng Wuya struck violently with the dagger in his hand. There was a sudden squelching noise as he chopped Junior Brother Luo’s head off in front of everyone from the Supreme Academy!

A large patch of fresh blood spurted like rain from the stump of his neck. Feng Wuya flung aside the head, throwing it at the feet of the people from the Supreme Academy! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Let him go.” Feng Wuya flicked his hands. The disciples from the Supreme Academy all smiled cruelly as they threw Junior Brother Luo’s body in front of Feng Wudang.

“What’s the matter? I always keep my word. Since I promised to let him go, I have let him go. Haha… shouldn’t you thank me for my benevolence?” Feng Wuya laughed wildly as he looked with mocking eyes at Feng Wudang, who had collapsed to the ground.

“Next, I will keep my word and cut off your ears. Look… how benevolent I am.” Feng Wuya walked towards Feng Wudang, his eyes filled with cruel amusement.

“Bastard!” Gu Tianhe looked at Junior Brother Luo’s head, which had rolled to his feet. He watched as Feng Wuya moved step by step closer to Feng Wudang. A violent rage swelled in his heart. With one move, he pushed aside Li Xiu who was blocking him, drew his sword, and charged at Feng Wuya.

“Junior Brother Gu!!” Li Xiu was shocked.

Although they abhorred Feng Wuya’s actions, no matter how much they detested him, it was still impossible for them to fight Feng Wuya!

“Another one seeking death.” Feng Wuya swept a cold look at the charging Gu Tianhe. “I don’t have time to deal with you right now. Men, capture this one. After I cut off this one’s ears, I will teach him a lesson.”

With that, everyone from the Divine Virtual Academy blocked Gu Tianhe’s path.

No matter how powerful Gu Tianhe was, he could not overcome so many by himself. He had no chance of even getting close to Feng Wuya.

In a moment, the disciples from the Divine Virtual Academy had severely injured Gu Tianhe. He was pressed to the ground, unable to move.

Feng Wuya walked in front of Feng Wudang and lifted him out of the pool of blood. He raised his bloodstained dagger and patted Feng Wudang’s ears.

“You should resign yourself to being a nobody. If you dare to offend me, even if you have ten lives, it will not be enough for me to toy with.” Feng Wuya laughed coldly. A cold gleam flashed across his eyes. The dagger in his hand suddenly pressed down, and it looked as if he was about to cut Feng Wudang’s ears off.However…

Just as Feng Wuya struck, a figure suddenly flashed across everyone’s eyes.

Before they could recover their wits, the figure was already next to Feng Wuya.

Before Feng Wuya could see the other person’s face clearly, an enormous force suddenly arose from his stomach!

Feng Wuya was instantly sent flying. The dagger in his hand clattered to the ground!

All this happened so suddenly, and it was beyond anyone’s expectations.

Feng Wudang had thought that he would not be able to escape this disaster. He did not imagine that someone would rescue him.
