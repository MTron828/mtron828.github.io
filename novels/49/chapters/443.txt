Chapter 444: Lying (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Fu Lingtian suddenly raised his right arm and slammed the beam of the roof!

In a moment, an extremely strong force of primordial qi crashed into the room like strong waves.

Then, Ye Qingtang landed on the ground from the roof like an agile butterfly and avoided Fu Lingtian’s attack.

“Fu Lingtian, how bold of you to intrude into Xuanling Sect’s area of residence. Are you not afraid of alarming the elders?” Ye Qingtang scoffed.

“Xuanling Sect?” Fu Lingtian’s lips curled up slightly into a cold sneer. “What is Xuanling Sect? How can it be compared to my Yunxiao Sect?”

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes when Fu Lingtian finished his sentence.

Fu Lingtian actually mentioned Yunxiao Sect in front of her forthrightly. It seemed that he no longer intended to conceal anymore…

“Ye Qingtang… you are a mere disciple of a small sect and only have the cultivation of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. However, you deliberately forced me to reveal my true state of cultivation on the ring today. I’m afraid you must know something.” A cold glint twinkled in Fu Lingtian’s eyes.

Previously, Ye You had warned that once he revealed his true skills in front of the three sects, he would definitely be heavily punished by the sect…

Fu Lingtian kept it in mind and was very cautious during the competition. Yet…

He was forced to reveal his true skills because of Ye Qingtang today, and the sect would definitely not forgive him!

Whichever route he had spelled death, and naturally, he would not let Ye Qingtang off. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Fu Lingtian, you barged into my room in the night. Could it be that it is to ask me if I know about anything?” Ye Qingtang was unconcerned.

“You reminded me…” Fu Lingtian walked towards Ye Qingtang slowly and said. “Everything is no longer important. Today… I will kill you first!”

Then, the imposing air of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two spread in the room, which shrouded and trapped Ye Qingtang.

“Aren’t you very nimble? Go on and flee.” There was a cruelly playful expression on Fu Lingtian’s face.

“Senior Brother Fu, I’m wrong. Please spare my life…” Looking at the murderous Fu Lingtian, a strange look flashed across her eyes, though “fear” was etched on her face.

“Haha… It’s a pity that’s a little too late!” Fu Lingtian scoffed and immediately slammed a hand towards Ye Qingtang.

Fu Lingtian’s slap possessed a large force of primordial qi, which contained the air of destruction. Even a person at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two would die without a doubt under this attack.

This girl brought so much trouble to him, and he already intended to kill her long ago. Thus, he no longer had any reservations using the skills of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two.

However…

Boom.

Ye Qingtang stretched a hand out and immediately stopped Fu Lingtian’s left palm.

In an instant, the “fear” on Ye Qingtang’s face faded, and her lips tugged up and formed into a devilish smile. “I was lying…”

“You!”

Fu Lingtian was astonished. There was the force of primordial qi around Ye Qingtang!

“Martial Qi Level Two… Second Heaven?!” Fu Lingtian was in utter disbelief.

Why was the attainment of this Ye Qingtang of Xuanling Sect the same as his in just a few hours?!

“You actually hid your skills as well!” Fu Lingtian clenched his teeth tightly. He naturally would not believe that Ye Qingtang just made a breakthrough, and he thought that she was also at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two but suppressed her skills as he did.

“Senior Brother Fu, how are you going to take my life now?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

Fu Lingtian was outraged, and the force of his primordial qi escalated to the maximum. He immediately broke free from Ye Qingtang’s restraint and turned around in an attempt to escape.
