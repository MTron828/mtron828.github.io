Chapter 122: Assessment Results (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Outside the main entrance of Xuanling Sect stood hundreds of candidates. At that instant, everyone could not help but become nervous.

The three segments of assessment for the Xuanling Sect revolved around the Array, Sword and Fist factions, respectively. The other Herbal Faction was not what candidates could participate in.

The results of the three segments decided whether they were able to step into Xuanling Sect’s main entrance today and become a sect disciple!

Once they entered the sect, they would no longer be the same as ordinary people. Regardless of the sect’s halo or the rare treasures in the sect, both were full of spirit energy, and this was a very appealing attraction for ambitious youth like them.

If they were able to enter the sect, not just them, but the entire family clan would be proud of the fact.

Time passed, and everyone seemed uneasy.

Only three people were calm.

Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu’s results were outstanding in all three segments, and their spirit roots were excellent; thus, they had nothing to be worried about.

The only remaining person was Ye Qingtang.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang stood aside with her eyes looked down. She was confused as to why she was not able to crush the Invasive Stone with her punch just now.

In other candidates’ eyes, her silence was a display of her despair.

Her spirit root was the most inferior, and that had already become her fatal point.

Although other candidates did not see Ye Qingtang’s results in the previous two segments of the assessment, it should be extremely terrible when estimating according to the duration of her assessment. Moreover, in the third segment, Ye Qingtang did not even leave a trace of damage on the Invasive Stone with her punch. Even if the results were not out, they were aware.

Ye Qingtang did not have the slightest chance of entering the sect.

There was no shortage of people gloating at her “misfortune.” Previously, when Ye Qingtang was the first to step on the Path to Heaven, they were already in a bad mood as they were outshone by someone with a red spirit root.

Looking at Ye Qingtang’s miserable state now, they were proud to be superior to her.

However, most of the candidates did not pay much attention to Ye Qingtang and were more preoccupied with their own results.

Yun Shu stood beside Ye Qingtang all along. There were a few times where he wanted to comfort Ye Qingtang yet felt that not saying anything and giving silence was the best choice.

“Brother Yun, what do you think will be the results of this assessment?” Lu Xiuwen walked up and stared at Yun Shu, who he believed was his only competitor, without looking at Ye Qingtang at all.

“The results are not out yet. It is simply the sect’s judgment,” Yun Shu said without emotion. Lu Xiuwen and he did not share the same values from the start, and, thus, he naturally did not want to speak much.

“The sect’s judgment is, of course, important, but brother Yun should be clear whether you and I will be able to enter the sect. Since you already have an idea, why do you still need to waste your time? From now on, some people will be completely different from you and me.” Lu Xiuwen did not mention anything about Ye Qingtang, but every word he said was directed against her.

Yun Shu frowned slightly.

Lu Xiuwen chuckled lightly and looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Ye Qingtang, I remember very clearly the words you made me remember a while ago. I said ‘if you could enter Xuanling Sect, won’t I be a useless piece of trash?’ Now, it is enough to prove that my words weren’t wrong, isn’t it?” Lu Xiuwen sneered.

Ye Qingtang swept her eyes across Lu Xiuwen, and a seeming smile played on her lips.

“Whether it is right or wrong, it is still too early to decide now.”
