Chapter 2021: Strong Backup (3)

Ye Qingtang figured out the Ancient You Clan’s use of the demon cubs now.

Incidentally, the Crimson League had already fallen out with the Ancient You Clan. No wonder the Ancient You Clan was desperate to find more demon cubs as soon as possible.

A plan began to form in Ye Qingtang’s mind. She approached the Northland Demon Tribe to inform the demon tribes that hadn’t been absorbed by the Ancient You Clan about the ordeal that the Northland Demon Tribe had experienced. She also released news about the Ancient You Clan capturing demon cubs for their own cultivation. If any demon tribe wanted to escape, they could try to seek help from the Temple of Shadows.

Of course, Ye Qingtang didn’t get the Northstar Demon Lord to directly go to the Temple of Shadows.

She merely released the rumors to hint at it. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As long as they cut off the supply of demon cubs, the Ancient You Clan wouldn’t be able to continue cultivating strong youths. Wasting no time, the Northstar Demon Lord immediately moved to action.

The next morning, Ye Qingtang received some news...

The Crimson League’s army had arrived in the Central Mainland and gathered at the Frost Abyss.

It was almost war!

“I’ve handed all the Ancient You Clan’s powers that I could find to Mi already. We shall see how Mi plans for the fight against the Ancient You Clan.”

Ye Qingtang came to look for Ling Yan once she learned of the news. The Crimson League would deal with those youths from the Ancient You Clan, anyone else that went would just be akin to committing suicide.

Ye Qingtang had already discussed with Mi how the Temple of Shadows was going to distribute its forces for clans that were seeking their protection, as well as forces to deal with the Ancient You Clan.

At that moment, she had something even more important to do.

Look for little You Yun!

“You might not need to come out at the start, but once we’re halfway through the war you have to come out. Are you planning to go look for that person during this time?” Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang as he asked. He seemed to already have an answer to that question.

“You’re right.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“I know of someone who can help you with that,” Ling Yan said.

“Who?” Ye Qingtang was slightly shocked.

Ling Yan didn’t say anything yet. He just took out a bell and started ringing it. The bell didn’t make any sound, but at that moment, someone knocked on the door. Getting up, Ling Yan moved to open the door. The guard that he had brought with him stood right outside.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan, feeling perplexed.

But Ling Yan only nodded at the guard. The guard removed his disguise and a familiar face appeared before Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“Ning Luo?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes widened in disbelief as the handsome youth appeared before her eyes.

Ning Luo...

A complicated expression crossed Ye Qingtang’s face when she looked at Ning Luo. Was she supposed to call him Ice Frost Divine Sword instead?

“We meet again.” Ning Luo looked at Ye Qingtang, and the corners of his mouth lifted.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

How was she supposed to feel? Without a doubt, Ye Qingtang felt complicated. It was all because Ning Luo opened up a portion of the Dimension Wall, that was why everything happened.

However... everything that Ning Luo did was to seek revenge for that extraordinary lady...

Everything felt like reincarnation. It was just that Ye Qingtang hadn’t expected to meet Ning Luo in the Central Mainland.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes riveted on Ling Yan. Everything seemed to be within Ling Yan’s control. He knew that she was looking for little You Yun and Ning Luo was the extraordinary lady’s sword...

Was it a coincidence, or did Ling Yan already arrange for everything when he was in the First Mainland?
