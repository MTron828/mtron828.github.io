Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang held her fist but did not say anything.

She still could not change the things that were about to happen… Things that happened in her previous life could not be prevented in this life… The Xuanling Sect would soon disappear from history… She was unwilling to accept the truth.

In her previous life, Elder Mo, Elder Qin, the Grand Elder, and most of the sect disciples were murdered within the sect…

Ye Qingtang held her fist tightly.

It was not enough…

Still not enough…

She was not powerful enough to change anything. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

If she was powerful enough, she could end the entire Yunxiao Sect instantly. Then, she would rewrite history.

Only the weak would follow destiny.

After a long while, Ye Qingtang’s eyes were getting firmer.

She would never bow in front of destiny and surrender to it.

Even if the sky were to be reversed and time flowed backward… she would fight against it!

Elder Huang of the outer sect suddenly announced. “Tonight, we are not separated by the inner and outer sect. We shall celebrate the gathering!”

Many disciples cheered after hearing that.

…

At midnight, the inner square was ablaze with lights. A few thousand disciples gathered in small groups.

Some were drinking delightfully.

Some were waving their swords.

Many disciples were exchanging their skills and experiences.

Some of the outer sect disciples gained the courage to ask for advice from inner sect disciples after a few rounds of drinks.

The inner sect disciples were also willing to share their experiences and pointed out the inadequacies they had.

Ye Qingtang recalled the days she spent at the Falling Sky Valley as she saw the harmony among the Xuanling Sect disciples…

Though there were conflicts, the bond between the disciples was always present.

“Things that are about to happen will happen eventually… This is the last moment before the storm comes.” Ye Qingtang closed her eyes and enjoyed the peace.

The next morning at the inner sect square…

The few inner sect elders including Elder Mo and the sect Master Li Yunfeng showed up.

Yesterday, all the disciples gathered at the inner sect. Many inner sect disciples suspected that there were ominous things that were about to happen.

“All disciples,” Sect Master Li Yunfeng said as he scanned through the crowd. “The sect has decided to disperse the inner and the outer sect.”

All disciples were shocked as they could not believe what they just heard.

Both the inner and outer sect disciples thought that they heard it wrong.

The Xuanling Sect was going to disperse the inner and the outer sect?

Loud discussions arose at the square.

“Sect Master, may I know why is it so?!”

“Why does the Xuanling Sect want to disperse the inner and outer sect?!”

Some of the senior inner sect disciples asked.

Li Yunfeng was silent for a while and then sighed. “There is an unavoidable calamity that is going to happen to the Xuanling Sect. It may mark the end of our sect. To prevent unnecessary sacrifices, we need to disperse you.”

“WHAT?!”

“Xuanling Sect’s calamity?!”

Many inner sect disciples were stunned.

The few inner sect elders also did not hold back and explained the truth.

Since they had decided to disperse the inner and outer sect disciples, they had to explain everything clearly.

The whole square was silent.

After a long time, one of the inner sect disciples shouted, “I joined the Xuanling Sect when I was twelve. It has been five years now. Xuanling Sect is my home, and all the disciples here are my family. Now that my home is in danger, how can I just run away for my own safety!”

“Senior Brother Tao Ran is right. We are the Xuanling Sect disciples, and Xuanling Sect is our home. We will never leave the sect behind when our sect is going to face attacks from the enemies. If we run away, we will never find a place to stand in this world!”

“I will either live or die with the sect. I will not step back no matter who our enemy is,” Ji Muyuan stepped forward and said.

“I will either live or die with the sect. I will not be afraid of any enemies ahead.” Zhu Changge stepped forward.

“I will either live or die with the sect. I will never run away for my own safety when the enemies come!” Feng Moli stepped forward.

“I am just an ordinary man, but I will never run away. I will fight till the last second for the sect!”

More disciples stepped forward and pledged their loyalty.

“We live as the Xuanling Sect disciples. We die as the Xuanling Sect ghosts!”

“As the Xuanling Sect disciples, we welcome our friends with sincerity, and we kill our enemies with our blood!”
