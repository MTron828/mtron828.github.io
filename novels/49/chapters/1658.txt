Chapter 1659: A Little Nervous (3)

Lin Weiyuan struck out with his sword and Jiang Yisheng and the others, who were outside the arena, shuddered.

It was over!

But just as everyone thought Ye Qingtang could not avoid Lin Weiyuan’s attack, Ye Qingtang turned slightly and avoided Lin Weiyuan’s sword with an unexpected dexterity. In the same move, she used her hand like a knife and chopped fiercely at the back of Lin Weiyuan’s neck!

“Crash!”

Lin Weiyuan, who had been furiously charging towards her just a moment ago, now collapsed to the ground. The force of her blow caused his eyes to roll back in his head. His ugly face twitched and looked even more sinister.

“...” Jiang Yisheng, who had been so anxious, was completely bewildered.

What was going on?

Beside him, Jiang Yiran was also perplexed. He was certain that Ye Qingtang would be defeated ignominiously, but who knew...

She had knocked Lin Weiyuan out with one blow?

Wasn’t that too incredible?

Elder Qian and the others seated on the dais were also stunned for a long moment. Then their anxiety turned into delight.

Ye Qingtang had won?

Had she really won?

The anxious expressions of Elder Qian and the others were now replaced by broad smiles. They seemed even happier than when Jiang Yanyun had won.

But Elder Qiu was expressionless. Lin Weiyuan of the Ancient Lin Lan Clan was one of the weakest of various ancient clans. Even within his Qiu Family, any one of them could easily defeat him.

However...

Elder Qiu could not help but frown when he saw how delighted Elder Qian and the others were.

Why were the Jiang family elders so happy when she beat one of the weakest members of the Ancient Lin Lan Clan?

Elder Qiu had already anticipated that Lin Weiyuan would lose this match. After all, the Ancient Lin Lan Clan was weaker than the other ancient clans, and he was one of the least powerful members of his clan. The match had no element of suspense.

Could it be that the Jiang family had really fallen so far? Was it simply that they were so overjoyed at beating someone like Lin Weiyuan?

Perhaps that was the case. Elder Qiu’s contempt towards the Jiang Family immediately grew a little.

That girl’s skills were merely average. But look how elated the Jiang family was. What a farce. Many of the other ancient clans had also glanced at the match. But the results were wholly expected and no one was surprised.

Only the Jiang family felt as if they had won a prize.

“I thought that Ye Qingtang was certain to lose. Who knew...” Elder Kun’s face had a trace of a smile, which was unusual for him.

“She has worked harder than anyone else for the past six months. It must be that after she returned to the Jiang family, the Domain Monarch Founder taught her a little before she left. But she certainly has not wasted our efforts.” Elder Qian was smiling. He was the only one who had insisted that Ye Qingtang try her skills at the Martial Arts Championship, so Ye Qingtang’s victory naturally made him look good.

To anyone outside, it was natural that Ye Qingtang, as a member of the Jiang family, had beaten Lin Weiyuan.

But only Elder Qian and the others knew that Ye Qingtang had returned to the Jiang Family only half a year ago. She had only become one of the Jiang family’s top twenty based on pure luck. It was a complete surprise when she defeated a disciple from another ancient clan.

On the dais, Lin Weiyuan was in a dead faint. Ye Qingtang had won this fight.

Jiang Yisheng cheered and rushed towards Ye Qingtang as she left the arena. “Qingtang, I knew it. You’re the best!”

When the youths from the other ancient clans heard his tones of sincere delight, they all thought Jiang Yisheng was a fool. How could she be considered one of the best after beating someone like Lin Weiyuan?

“Little girl, you’re not too bad, you knew how to catch him unawares. Did you purposely make him angry?” Jiang Yiran had not expected Ye Qingtang to win. When he recalled that Ye Qingtang had enraged Lin Weiyuan before the latter had struck, he thought that it was part of Ye Qingtang’s strategy.

She purposely infuriated her opponent, then seized the opportunity to strike.
