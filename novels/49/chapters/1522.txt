Chapter 1523 Ten Thousand Years 2

“Little girl, don’t lie to us. You’re merely at Arcane Supremacy Eighth Heaven. You dare to enter this place, so why wouldn’t other people?” Xiong Yan scoffed.

“If I wasn’t being hunted down by people and had no other choice but to escape into this place, I would never step in here,” Ye Qingtang said.

Everyone noticed that Ye Qingtang was covered in blood, and she did look like she was just in a fierce battle.

After thinking about how not a single soul appeared here throughout the past ten thousand years, the masses had their suspicions.

“We have been trapped here for a long time. If you can help us to break that boundary stone, we will definitely remember your favor,” Fu Xu said with a smile.

It should be known that all of them were once extremely influential rulers, and countless people wanted to enter their forces. How precious would it be if one could gain a favor from these powerful figures?

“Sorry, I am still being hunted down by people and have no relations with you all. I’ve no intention to interfere in such matters and will take my leave first.” Ye Qingtang acted as though she did not wish to be nosy and immediately turned around, wanting to leave.

Everyone immediately became anxious when they saw that the savior they had waited ten thousand years for was about to slip away.

Only this one person came after ten thousand years of waiting; furthermore, if this place really did turn into a forbidden area as this girl had explained, wouldn’t it be harder for people to come here?

They had already degenerated to this stage, and if they still could not find a way to get out, all of them would turn into nothing in ten years maximum.

The group of children who initially put on airs of powerful figures were really anxious now.

“Wait, you said that you were being hunted down. Perhaps I can help you to get out of your predicament,” Fu Xu said hurriedly.

Ye Qingtang turned around without concealing her sweeping glance at the group of “powerful figures” who were barely at her thigh. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

A tinge of redness tinted their cheeks when in contact with Ye Qingtang’s bare gaze.

“Uh... Although we are affected by the curse and have been turned into this state, we still have many Dharma treasures on us that can help you to get out of your predicament.” Fu Xu explained in more detail.

The Age Reversal Curse caused both their bodies and skills to degenerate greatly.

A smile emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she heard that.

She was waiting for this sentence.

However...

Although that was what Ye Qingtang was thinking, she kept a suspicious look on her face.

“I haven’t met you all before, and I don’t even know who you all are... If you all really had such impressive Dharma treasures, why would you all be trapped here for as long as ten thousand years? Don’t think of lying to me.”

The powerful figures were so maddened by Ye Qingtang’s words that they almost vomited blood.

Ten thousand years ago, any one of them was a supreme figure that was highly worshiped by millions of people. Yet now, not only did this little girl not recognize them, she even doubted their skills.

“No matter how many Dharma treasures we have, it is useless. We already explained very clearly just now that we are simply unable to open this boundary from the inside.”

Although all of them were proud and arrogant figures, the only one who could rescue them was this person before them. Hence, these powerful figures who were used to acting arrogantly could only speak politely in fear that their only savior would leave.

“How do I know if what you all said is real? I think you all merely want to cajole me into taking a risk. I’ll take my leave first...” Ye Qingtang appeared as though she did not trust them and was about to walk away.
