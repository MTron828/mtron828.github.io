Chapter 511 Blood Moon Sect Branch Master (2)

“Leave!”

The elite disciple’s expression changed, and he immediately commanded.

“Leave?” The Blood Moon elderly cackled sinisterly. “Since you’re here, just become a part in my body then… Conquer the world together with me and witness my glory.”

Then, the Blood Moon elderly turned into a blood tide once again, and a crimson light enveloped everyone in an instant. One of the disciples was blanketed by the blood tide immediately, and his body melted into blood water at a visible speed before being sucked in by the blood tide.

“Save… Senior Brother… Save… Save me…”

The inner sect disciple who was captured by the blood tide stretched his hand out towards the elite disciple as despair filled his face.

Swoosh!

The elite disciple drew out a long sword and slashed down at the blood tide without hesitation.

Boom!

With a strike, the inner sect disciple that was covered in the blood tide was crushed into pieces by the sword aura.

“Tsk tsk… Yunxiao Sect did not change much in these thousand years. They’re still so ruthless and won’t let even their own people off…” The blood tide had already withdrawn from the inner sect disciple when the elite disciple strike. Thus, the elite disciple only killed his inner sect junior brother and did not injure Blood Demon Branch Master at all.

Very quickly, the blood all over the ground was absorbed by the blood tide, and Blood Demon turned into a human form once again.

“Senior brother, could it be that this wilderness is… Blood Moon Sect’s headquarters?!”

A Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciple gasped. If it was really the case…

Whiz!

Before the elite disciple spoke, a giant figure like that of a mountain peak descended from the sky.

Boom!

A brawny man that was a few meters tall landed from the sky and instantly crushed the inner sect disciple who spoke.

“Not the headquarters. It’s a division.” The brawny man stood up. His huge frame seemed to cover the entire sky, and he was nothing less than a giant.

There was a necklace formed using human skulls hung on the brawny man’s neck, and every inch of his skin was like an iron casting that contained a horrifying explosive force.

“Now who are you!” An outer sect disciple was terrified.

The brawny man turned around and looked at that Yunxiao Sect outer sect disciple.

In the next second, the brawny man turned into a shadow ata speed that stirred up a gust of wild wind that blew the sand away.

“So fast…”

The inner sect disciples were appalled. Although this brawny man looked cumbersome, his speed was even faster than that of normal agile girls!

“Have… Have mercy!”

The heads of the outer sect disciples were clutched in that brawny man’s enormous hands.

Hearing them, the brawny man was emotionless as he tightened the clench of his giant fists.

In an instant, the sound of crushed skulls rang, and a combination of red and white liquid seeped out from between the brawny man’s fingers.

Subsequently, the brawny man tossed those headless bodies far away.

“Blood Moon Sect… One of the one hundred and eight Branch Masters, Soul Severing Troll!” A Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciple exclaimed as expressions of horror were etched on his face.

“A few living beings finally came here, but you want to compete with me.” Blood Demon looked at Soul Severing Troll and laughed sinisterly.

Soul Severing Troll did not bother with Blood Demon as he scanned the scene.

Whiz!

Without any nonsense, Soul Severing Troll threw a punch. Boom! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

A Yunxiao Sect disciple nearest to him was already dead from Soul Severing Troll’s punch before he could even react. “Run!”

The Yunxiao Sect elite disciple finally realized the seriousness of the matter.

Previously, they had already heard that there were traces of Blood Moon Sect members resurrecting, but never in a million years did it cross their minds that they would actually encounter a resurrected Blood Moon Branch Master!
