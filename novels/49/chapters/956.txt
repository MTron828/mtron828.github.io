Chapter 957 Ye Family (1)

Both Master Si and Si Ye were stunned when they heard Ye Qingtang’s words. They had never thought of… achieving this level in their lifetime.

By the time they both snapped out of their trance, they realized that Ye Qingtang had vanished and left the Si house.

After leaving the Si house, Ye Qingtang went straight to the Ye house.

She had not been back for more than a year. She wondered how her father and second uncle were.

As she walked along the familiar streets to the main gate of the Ye house, she saw two unfamiliar servants guarding the entrance.

Ye Qingtang walked directly towards the main gate of the Ye house. When the two guards saw that someone wanted to enter the Ye house, they immediately blocked her way.

“This is the Ye house. Miss, do you have any business here?” One man asked.

“I’m going home.” Ye Qingtang gaze brushed past these two guards, whom she had not seen before.

“Going home?” The two of them were stunned. One of them was a young man who stared at Ye Qingtang’s features for a while as if he had suddenly thought of something.

“You… You are the Eldest Young Lady, Ye Qingtang?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

The two of them immediately exchanged glances and snapped out of their trance.

The two of them had been in the Ye family for a year and had often heard Second Elder and the Master of the Ye family mention the Eldest Young Lady, Ye Qingtang. They heard that the Eldest Young Lady had gone to the Xuanling Sect. They had occasionally seen a picture of the Eldest Young Lady that hung in the Master’s room, but they had not seen her in person.

“We didn’t know that Eldest Young Lady was coming home and were remiss in our welcome.” The two of them bowed immediately.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and walked into the Ye house that she had left a year ago.

Everything in the Ye house was just as she had left it, but there were many unfamiliar faces in the house.

Ye Qingtang did not see her father, Ye Ling, or Second Elder in the living room, so she went to Ye Ling’s study. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ye Ling was sitting in the study, his brow deeply furrowed. Second Elder was sitting next to him with a grave expression. The two of them were sitting in silence when someone suddenly pushed open the door.

Ye Ling subconsciously looked up with a frown, but what he saw caused him to almost drop the file in his hand.

“Tang Tang?!” Ye Ling was surprised and overjoyed when his daughter suddenly appeared before his eyes.

“Father, Second Uncle.” Ye Qingtang looked at the two familiar faces before her, and a sincere smile involuntarily surfaced in her eyes.

“Tang Tang, why are you… back?” When Second Elder saw that Ye Qingtang had returned, his expression was one of surprise and joy.

They had not seen Ye Qingtang for almost two years after she left for the Xuanling Sect.

“I was homesick. Doesn’t Father and Second Uncle want to see me?” A trace of a smile appeared on Ye Qingtang’s face. It was as if she had momentarily forgotten all her fatigue and busyness in the outer world.

She could only truly relax in the Ye house, among her own kin.

“What are you saying? Your father has missed you desperately for the whole year. Can’t you see that your picture is hung in his study every day? If he doesn’t look at it at least a few times every day, he would be at a loss.” Second Elder’s grave expression had vanished slowly with Ye Qingtang’s return.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept across the interior of the study. Her picture really hung on one wall.

“Don’t listen to your Second Uncle’s nonsense. Sit down.” Ye Ling laughed and shook his head, but when he looked at Ye Qingtang, his eyes were filled with concern.

“Has everything been alright with you while you were with the Xuanling Sect?”

“Everything has been fine. Thank you, Father, for your concern.” Ye Qingtang laughed as she spoke. In order to avoid worrying her father, she did not say anymore.
