Chapter 2045: Spiritual Abode (2)

“That... that’s...” Elder Mo was acting strange and his eyes were darting around.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes narrowed and she gave Ming Di a look. He raised one claw and pierced it through Elder Mo’s shoulder.

Elder Mo screamed terribly as he turned pale and started trembling from the pain.

“The next thing I pierce through is going to be your heart if you don’t reply,” Ye Qingtang said.

Elder Mo panted and he didn’t dare keep anything from them. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That... that’s... the Spiritual... Spiritual Abode...”

Ye Qingtang frowned as she heard those two words.

“What do you mean?” she forced herself to stay calm as she asked him.

Terrified of being killed by Ming Di, Elder Mo spilled everything. “A while ago, we brought back a girl from the First Mainland. She had a Spiritual Abode and my Clan Master knew that that would help to raise our power, so he let her cultivate her Spiritual Abode for us to absorb...”

And it wasn’t just for the Spiritual Abode itself. They realized they could achieve even better effects if they cultivated themselves under the influence of the Spiritual Abode.

That girl was extremely important to the Ancient You Clan and they didn’t want anyone else to know her whereabouts, which was why they hid her in a secret location in the west region. No one other than the Clan Master and a few Elders knew her location.

The power from the Spiritual Abode that the little girl had cultivated was placed in a special Fire Tripod and sent to various groups of the Ancient You Clan for them to cultivate their strength.

“And what about the demon cubs?” she asked.

Elder Mo didn’t dare hide any information from them and said, “While the power of the Spiritual Abode is great and could help us strengthen ourselves, it brought great risks as well. The demon cubs are much stronger than us, so we use them as a vessel to transfer power. We get them to absorb the power first before we eat their flesh...”

The power of the Spiritual Abode became a lot gentler after being refined in the demon cubs’ bodies and the Ancient You Clan members didn’t have to worry about exploding.

Once they had come under the influence of the gentler Spiritual Abode power, they could then head to where the Spiritual Abode was to cultivate themselves for maximum efficacy.

Of course, the absorption of power was dependent on age and talent as well. The amount of power that Elder Mo and the other Elders, who were already rather old, was a lot less than the youths.

They had skinned the demon cubs so that they could absorb the Spiritual Abode better.

All this was just to strengthen the Ancient You Clan.

Everyone else were victims.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. What Elder Mo had said wasn’t far from what she had guessed but hearing it from his mouth still made her shudder.

“Where is that girl?” she finally asked after regaining her composure.

She just wanted to know where little You Yun was!

“At the edge of the west region... I...I’ve never been there. This is my first time here,” Elder Mo said carefully.

There were many Elders in the Ancient You Clan, and Elder Mo was not one of the more important ones. It was only because the other Elders were busy cultivating at the Spiritual Abode that he was left in charge of the main forces.
