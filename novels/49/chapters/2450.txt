Chapter 2451: Are You Playing A Prank On Me? (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The big yellow dog was taken aback by her words. It subconsciously looked in the direction Ye Qingtang was pointing at before gazing back at her.

“Are you playing a prank on me? Where’s the palace?”

Ye Qingtang asked, “You are the one who played a prank on me first. How can there be a palace here?”

The big yellow dog wagged its tail. “Isn’t this a palace?”

Ye Qingtang sneered and pointed forward with her right hand. “Isn’t that a palace too?”

“Can’t you see the palace here?” The big yellow dog sat on the ground and scratched its head with its hind paws.

“I don’t see it,” Ye Qingtang said without hesitation.

“Since you can’t see the palace, why did you push the door?” The yellow dog was confused.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “I was worried you had turned crazy and would bite me.”

The big yellow dog suddenly stood up and stared at Ye Qingtang. “I understand now. You’re too weak and can’t see the palaces here. These palaces are formed by special energy bodies.”

“Go on. I will bark like a dog if I ever believe you,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Hmph, don’t underestimate me. I have a way to let you see.” The big yellow dog stared at Ye Qingtang. “Use my tears to wipe the corners of your eyes and you will see.”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“Alright, tell me two sad stories first,” the big yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang said, “There was a dog who got mad dog disease and died.”

The big yellow dog said, “Why are you staring at me? Continue.”

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “The end.”

What sad story? Wasn’t her current situation tragic enough…

“Sigh, forget it. I didn’t expect you to be so weak. You don’t even know how to tell a story. You have no strength and no eloquence. You’re really a rare piece of trash.” The big yellow dog sighed. “In that case, grab a handful of sand and throw it at my face.”

“This I’m good at.”

As Ye Qingtang spoke, she grabbed a lot of yellow sand and threw it at the dog’s face.

“Too much… It’s all thrown into my eyes. Quick, blow at them.” The big yellow dog hurriedly tottered over to Ye Qingtang and rubbed its head against her calf.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. What the hell! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, here are the tears. Hurry up and dab the corners of your eyes with them,” said the yellow dog.

“If you dare to lie to me, I promise you won’t be able to eat beef for the rest of your life.” Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth. But she did want to see if there was really a palace in this place.

With that, Ye Qingtang followed the yellow dog’s instructions and dabbed its tears at the corners of her eyes.

…

A moment later, Ye Qingtang opened her eyes again and looked ahead.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Ye Qingtang swore that in her two lifetimes, she had never been tricked so thoroughly… Moreover, what Ye Qingtang could not accept the most was that the one who tricked her was actually a lousy dog!!

Where was this so-called palace? Her surroundings looked exactly the same as before. Looking around, there was only yellow sand.

“Where’s the palace?” Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog with a stern expression.

The big yellow dog wagged its tail when it heard that. “What a coincidence. The palace just entered a concealed state, but it’s fine. It’ll appear soon. A palace constructed from energy bodies is very unstable.”

“Do you think I can kick you to death if I use all my strength?” Ye Qingtang asked thoughtfully.

“I think you will just be wasting your energy. With your lousy strength, I think you will exert yourself to death, while I won’t even lose a strand of hair,” the yellow dog said matter-of-factly..
