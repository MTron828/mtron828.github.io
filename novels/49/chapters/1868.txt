Chapter 1869: Guest From the Second Domain (3)

“A thousand,” the man answered.

Ye Qingtang handed a thousand spirit stones over to the man at once. Even if he didn’t return the spirit stones, it was already an amazing deal to get two bottles of Miracle Pills for a thousand spirit stones.

The man secretly heaved a sigh of relief when he took the spirit stones from Ye Qingtang, while the girl’s face was thunderous. She glared at Ye Qingtang with lustrous eyes, looking like she wanted to strangle Ye Qingtang to death.

“Long Yi, how could you just give the Miracle Pills to her so easily like that?” The girl was extremely displeased.

“Young Miss, we have to compromise since we need help. We came here to look for Miss Jiu and we’ve even lost contact with Young Master. Your safety is our top priority now,” Long Yi said.

The girl was initially very displeased, but when she heard ‘Miss Jiu’, she calmed down in an instant.

“Is Aunt Jiu really here?” The girl sounded excited as she asked.

Long Yi couldn’t exactly confirm it yet, but that was already the closest news.

“Miss Jiu disappeared after entering the mystic realm. Even if she’s not here now, there must be some clues in this mystic realm.”

The girl pursed her lips, her arrogance disappearing, only to be replaced with a complicated mix of worry and hope. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Fu Qiu only let them in after receiving the full sum of spirit stones.

When the girl walked past Ye Qingtang and saw her ‘ugly’ appearance, she frowned. “Hmph, ugly freak. I won’t bother with you.”

She wouldn’t have had to put up with this if she hadn’t lost contact with her elder brother.

‘Ugly freak’ Ye Qingtang, “...”

She really had the urge to spank this lass!

Jiang Shaobai didn’t say a word throughout the entire time, he merely looked at her with narrowed eyes. After a while, he finally lifted his head. “Sister, listen.”

“Hm?” Ye Qingtang was puzzled.

“There’s a crow making sounds, it’s really noisy,” Jiang Shaobai said with an innocent expression.

The only person to talk was the girl and her face instantly darkened.

“You’re saying that I’m a crow?”

“Did I say that it was you? Or are you just having a guilty conscience?” Jiang Shaobai said with an innocent smile.

The girl almost fainted from anger hearing that.

“Long Yi!” The girl had never experienced such humiliation before. Right when she was about to flare up...

“Shut up. The sun is rising soon. If you don’t want to die, scram the hell underground now,” Fu Qiu ordered.

The girl wasn’t going to budge but Long Yi held her back. Ye Qingtang, Jiang Shaobai, and Little White Tiger went back to their respective rooms.

Even after Ye Qingtang and the others had left, the girl was still fuming in anger.

Long Yi could only advise, “Young Miss, we sought permission from Master to come and search for Miss Jiu this time. Please don’t be rash and just put up with it for now. Our first priority is finding Miss Jiu.”

With the mention of ‘Miss Jiu’, the girl’s anger instantly dissipated and she bit down on her lips.

“Bunch of old fools, how could Aunt Jiu possibly betray us? It’s been so many years and they never once looked for Aunt Jiu properly instead of arguing all the time. Aunt Jiu might have suffered a lot outside and yet they accused her like that. If I was Aunt Jiu, I also wouldn’t go back if I learned that those old fools are accusing me.”

At her words, Long Yi could only sigh helplessly with a complicated expression on his face.
