Chapter 1477 Elder Cabinet 1

“Aunt…” Jiang Lang was about to thank her.

But Jiang Xun waved her hand. “Just take good care of Mo Yi. Jiang Kai will still cause trouble for you all in the Jiang Residence. Mo Yi is unwell now. You need to restrain yourself… Look at you. You’re very similar to the previous Domain Monarch…”

“The previous Domain Monarch?”

Jiang Xun said, “The previous Domain Monarch is our ancestor and also the first Domain Monarch of the Jiang Family. He was extremely formidable and talented. That Domain Monarch was also a sentimental person who loved his wife deeply. However, his wife was frail, and she died in a battle against external enemies. Ever since then, the Domain Monarch Founder tried all the means to revive her, but there was no news in the end. I heard that he seemed to have left the First Domain in the end and headed to the Second Domain.”

The Domain Monarch Founder was a legend of the Jiang Family, and he pioneered the golden age of the Jiang Family.

“When I was young, I heard some rumors regarding the Domain Monarch Founder and knew that he was extremely talented, but I didn’t know he still had such a side,” Jiang Lang said.

“If he were still around, he would definitely like someone with a similar temperament like you,” Jiang Xun said with a smile.

“It’s a pity that there’s no fate to meet him.” Jiang Lang sighed. He had great respect for the Domain Monarch Founder.

Jiang Xun chatted with Jiang Lang and Mo Yi for a while and then instructed Ye Qingtang to make the preparations. Since they were going to head to the Land of Infinite Demons, it would be extremely dangerous, and there would still be many crises even with her protection.

Ye Qingtang did not dare to be negligent either. She still had many things undone and did not wish to die in there. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Those extraordinary talents from the Elder Cabinet will probably head to the Land of Infinite Demons as well. However, they’re usually haughty and probably will not interact with you much. You don’t need to worry about them too much,” Jiang Xun said suddenly.

Elder Cabinet?

A hint of confusion emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“Tang Tang just returned. I don’t think she knows about the Elder Cabinet,” Jiang Xun said with a smile.

“The Jiang Family has a steady position as the Domain Monarch not because of fools like Jiang Yiming. You just returned to the Jiang Family and have not seen many people. There’s actually a lot of people in the Jiang Family and many talented youths. However, those people were brought into the Elder Cabinet to be personally trained by a few cabinet elders after they were born…”

The Elder Cabinet was the backing of the Jiang Family’s power.

Elder Meng and Elder Xu who Ye Qingtang saw were only in charge of a few Jiang Family’s external matters, but the fundamentals of the Jiang Family were a few cabinet elders in the Elder Cabinet.

Those elders were obsessed with martial arts and had profound skills. Every time there was a newborn in the Jiang Family, the cabinet elders would test the newborns’ endowment with the Domain Monarch. If they had excellent endowments, they would be directly brought into the Elder Cabinet to be nurtured thoughtfully.

Those talented youths who were personally brought up by the cabinet elders rarely appeared in other places of the Jiang Family and were cultivating in the Elder Cabinet most of the time.

The Land of Infinite Demons was a good training ground, and the extraordinary talents in the Elder Cabinet would participate as well.

Evidently, it was truly a good chance to go to the Land of Infinite Demons. Ordinary disciples in the Jiang Family did not have any chance to enter the Land of Infinite Demons as it was extremely dangerous, and given their skills, they probably would not be able to return even if they entered.

Ye Qingtang finally understood it when she heard Jiang Xun’s explanation.

She had been wondering why she had not seen any brilliant youths in the dignified Domain Monarch’s clan.

So it was because they were all being nurtured in the Elder Cabinet.
