Chapter 2417: Death Wish (1)

The figures stood by the crater. They were taken aback when they saw the collapsed trees and dead Maple Night Academy people.

It was a team from the Flying Star Academy. One of them was a teenager who had an exceptionally acute detection ability. This was how they detected the presence of Ye Qing’s group and rushed over. But they couldn’t help being stunned by the disastrous sight.

“Teacher, they are people from the Netherworld Academy.” One of the Netherworld Academy students spotted Ye Qing and his team, who were just about to leave.

The Flying Star Academy teacher frowned as he surveyed the death scene before him.

“The Netherworld Academy is so merciless.”

“Teacher, what should we do now?”

“They must have just expended a lot of energy. It is the best time for us to make our move and stop them,” the teacher instructed.

“But… their numbers… It doesn’t look like they are just one team. If I am not wrong, it looks like two teams combined. We would be at a disadvantage if we attacked them, right?” The teenager hesitated.

The team competition was approaching the final stage. The teams had all stopped hunting demons and were targeting the other teams.

The teacher narrowed his eyes as he examined Ye Qingtang’s group.

“About half of their members are grievously injured and would not be able to fight. Amongst the rest, there are two from the medicine faculty. At the most, only nine of them would be able to participate in the battle. We still have the advantage of numbers. Moreover…” The teacher lowered his voice before commanding his students to attack.

Initially, Ye Qingtang hadn’t wanted to meddle with them but the Flying Star Academy folks charged forward and blocked their way.

If not for Lu Yuanxiang’s team, Ye Qingtang and her brats would have already disappeared without a trace. Unfortunately, Lu Yuanxiang’s team would be left in the lurch if they fled first.

A sense of foreboding arose in Lu Yuanxiang’s mind when he saw the people blocking their way. He turned to see the Flying Star Academy teacher standing behind them.

The Flying Star Academy teacher said provocatively, “Trying to escape after robbing them? I already heard rumors of the Netherworld Academy but never expected you guys to be so merciless. Killing so many Maple Night Academy people just for the sake of taking their demon crystals.”

Lu Yuanxiang instantly realized that there was a misunderstanding. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“My friend, you have misunderstood. We did not kill the Maple Night Academy people. We only just arrived.”

“Who else if not you guys? We are both competitors and there’s no need to try and hide the truth. But since you dared to rob others, you should be prepared to be robbed.” The Flying Star Academy teacher narrowed his eyes. The spirit energy of his students surged.

Lu Yuanxiang was also well aware that the true danger in this competition was not only the infighting between the various academies.

“The Wailing Well test is not as simple as we thought. There are monsters which are above Emperor level hidden in here and the Maple Night Academy folks were killed by such a monster. Even our teleportation talisman is defective. At a time like this, we cannot continue fighting amongst ourselves.”

Lu Yuanxiang was sincere in his persuasion but Ye Qingtang remained expressionless. She knew that Lu Yuanxiang was just too kind-hearted and naive.

But his urgings would be a futile attempt.

And Ye Qingtang’s predictions were true. The Flying Star Academy teacher remained unmoved after hearing Lu Yuanxiang’s persuasion. Instead, a smirk crossed his lips.
