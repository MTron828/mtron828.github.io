Chapter 875 Gains

“Quickly leave. If that woman from the Supreme Academy discovers us…”

One of the males’ forehead was beaded in cold sweat.

The Supreme Academy and Divine Virtual Academy were like ice and fire. Whenever the students from these two academies met, their eyes would be blazed with hatred, and they would beat each other to death.

Initially, they planned to hide in the dark and reap the spoils of the fight without lifting a finger, yet looking at it now, they should just forget about it.

The two people then retreated cautiously.

“How are your injuries?”

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang walked forward and looked at the three people.

Among them, Gu Tianhe’s injuries were the most serious.

“Still… alright,” Gu Tianhe said between large pants.

“Senior Sister Ye… you… you are too amazing…” Feng Wudang looked at Ye Qingtang with reverence. Earlier on, he originally thought that there was no hope left, but who knew that Ye Qingtang would kill Perfected Gu Yun with just a move?

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to explain anything either. She walked to Perfected Gu Yun’s side swiftly. She searched his body and found a few bottles of elixirs.

“Consume it.”

Ye Qingtang immediately took three sacred healing elixirs and tossed one to three of them each.

The three people consumed the elixirs immediately with gratitude.

This sacred healing elixir was carried by powerful figures of the Divine Arcane Supremacy realm. Thus, its effects definitely could not be compared to that of her own healing elixirs.

Subsequently, Ye Qingtang took Perfected Gu Yun’s space ring without a sound and kept it.

The space ring of a Divine Arcane Supremacy…

With just a casual thought, one would know that there was definitely shocking wealth in it. From just what Ye Qingtang knew, there was a Heaven Tremor Seal Dharma treasure, which was of a Divine Arcane Supremacy level!

“Senior Sister Ye… Perfected Gu Yun’s head…” Feng Wudang smiled at Ye Qingtang.

Currently, Perfected Gu Yun’s space ring disappeared, which meant that Ye Qingtang must have taken it. Perfected Gu Yun was singlehandedly killed by Ye Qingtang, and they naturally had no objections. However, Perfected Gu Yun’s head had some temptation to them.

A large reason as to why the three of them were willing to take a risk was also because they wanted to obtain Perfected Gu Yun’s head.

Immediately, Li Bingxue and Gu Tianhe looked at Ye Qingtang with desire as well.

Ye Qingtang pretended to be deep in thought and subsequently acted as though she was very reluctant. “Alright, Perfected Gu Yun’s head is all yours.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The three of them were extremely excited upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Haha, Thank you! Thank you so much, Senior Sister Ye!!” Feng Wudang hurriedly thanked with cupped fists.

“Senior Sister Ye is the best!” Li Bingxue had a delighted expression.

Swiftly, Gu Tianhe stepped forward and beheaded Perfected Gu Yun before storing it in his space ring

At this moment, the three people were gathered together as they discussed how to obtain the greatest benefit from this head after they left the Dragon Vein.

On the other hand, Ye Qingtang stood aside and took out Perfected Gu Yun’s space ring.

However, this space ring was sealed by a powerful mental seal of a Divine Arcane Supremacy. Given Ye Qingtang’s current abilities, it was not realistic and almost impossible to break the mental seal of a Divine Arcane Supremacy and open this space ring.

Yet, the more it was so, the more curious was Ye Qingtang. What kind of immense wealth was there in the space ring of a Divine Arcane Supremacy!

Just a Heaven Tremor Seal at the Divine Arcane Supremacy level was already priceless!
