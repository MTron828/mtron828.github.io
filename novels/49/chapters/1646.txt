Chapter 1647: Island of Immortal Footsteps (1)

“Elder Qian, you’re too kind. The extraordinary talents from all clans will be participating in the Martial Arts Championship this year. I’m looking forward to a spar between the younger generation of our Qiu clan and Jiang Yanyun, as well as that little extraordinary talent of your Jiang Family. However... I hope that they can last until they face the Qiu’s. It would be very regrettable if they lose from the start and have to withdraw from the competition,” Elder Qian said meaningfully.

Elder Qian’s expression immediately darkened.

The younger generation of the Jiang Family had not attained any good results in the Martial Arts Championship in recent years. In contrast, the Qiu clan produced quite a number of impressive talents who attained pretty good results.

The Qiu clan’s youths improved at a shocking rate and had embarrassed many of Jiang Family’s youths in the past few years of the Martial Arts Championship.

This led the Qiu Family elders to become increasingly arrogant.

“Elder Qiu, the Jiang Family is the Domain Monarch’s clan. There’s no need for you to worry about not having a chance to spar with them.” A voice suddenly rang as an elderly in green walked over, beaming, with a group of youths behind him. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Elder Baili.” Elder Qiu immediately laughed after seeing who it was.

The incomer was an elder of the Baili Clan.

“In the previous Martial Arts Championship, the Qiu Clan and Baili Clan had an exciting match. I wonder who will win the title this year. I’m really looking forward to the competition between our two clans,” Elder Qiu said with a smile.

“Ha... Of course.” the Baili Clan elder agreed with a smile.

As the two echoed after each other, the expression of Elder Qian and the rest grew ugly.

For both the Qiu Clan and Baili Clan, the youths that they sent to participate in the Martial Arts Championship were very outstanding. While the Jiang Family’s Domain Monarch title must not be challenged, the youths of both clans were evidently impressive and had caused the Jiang Family to suffer a few times.

Each top clan had its own edge in the Martial Arts Championship, but the Jiang Family did not perform too well in the past few years.

The Jiang Family regarded this year’s Martial Arts Championship very highly as well. If there were no sufficiently powerful youths to support the Jiang Family for a long time, it would be hard to secure the Domain Monarch position as well.

After all, each new generation replaced the previous one...

“That is... Baili Xi?” Jiang Yiran spotted a tall and slender figure in the group of youths of the Baili Clan.

He was a gorgeous male—his looks stood out from the crowd, and his calm expression complemented his tall figure, yet there was something distant about him.

“Who is Baili Xi?” A youth from the Jiang Family asked curiously.

Jiang Yiran said, “You don’t know him? He was the champion in the Martial Arts Championship last year! I didn’t expect him to come again this year... When he participated in the Martial Arts Championship last time, he was the youngest contestant, but even so, he defeated all the opponents and claimed the champion title. I thought he would not come this year...”

Jiang Yiran could not help but look toward Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai. These were the two most powerful youths in the Jiang Family, but should they meet Baili Xi, a rare and exceptional talent, what were their chances of winning?

“Qiu Chen came as well.” Jiang Yiran looked toward the Qiu Clan side and instinctively frowned once he spotted the arrogant and frivolous youth.

“Qiu Chen? The top talent of the Qiu Clan?” A Jiang Family youth was slightly taken aback.
