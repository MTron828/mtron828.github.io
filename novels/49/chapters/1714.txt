Chapter 1715: The Undead (1)

But before Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang could react, a huge roaring sound pierced their eardrums. Countless ice spikes suddenly emerged from the icy ground beneath their feet.

Powerful winds blew past them and dense snowflakes filled the sky. It was like the whole earth had suddenly been swallowed up.

Ye Qingtang could not see anything at all. She just felt an immense aura charging toward her.

A mere person was no match for the raging winds and Ye Qingtang lost all sense of direction as she was swept up by the fierce gusts. It was all she could do to steady herself and not plummet to the ground.

If anything, it was like a major apocalypse had happened. Snow was everywhere and Ye Qingtang felt like the savage winds were trying to tear her apart. With this kind of snowstorm, those who were not at least a Third Heaven-level and above would be torn to shreds.

Ye Qingtang didn’t know how long she had drifted within the snowstorm. As she was whipped and thrown around haphazardly, her clothes had completely frozen. If not for Little White Tiger continuously exuding warmth while in her arms, she would have already been frozen to death.

After a long time, Ye Qingtang was finally carried off out of the storm’s fierce embrace. The roaring wind died off and she turned to see a slate of pure white behind her. Frost and strong currents had taken over everything. The howling sound of the harsh, bitter wind sounded like a profound wailing from within.

“Damn, what kind of monster was that? Even I couldn’t recognize it.” Little White Tiger was still in Ye Qingtang’s arms. It shook off the snow that had accumulated on its fur.

“Its scales were like ice and could penetrate the outside world. It looked like an ice sculpture. Not only that, it is completely undetectable when it doesn’t move. Of course you can’t recognize it.” Ye Qingtang was panting as she tried to recompose herself. In these below-freezing temperatures, she was exerting a more-than-usual amount of energy.

Little White Tiger twitched its ears and surveyed their surroundings. Engulfed by the violent storm, they had just thought about escaping earlier and had no idea where they were heading. They were now surrounded by ice and snow across a landscape full of canyons and gorges. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I can hear something.” Ye Qingtang’s expression shifted. Were those footsteps? It sounded like footsteps treading across the snow and ice.

She instinctively crouched down like a cat and scurried over to hide behind a mound of snow.

“Clack clack clack...”

The weird noises came closer and closer and to Ye Qingtang, it sounded like bones being knocked against each other.

“Was that the roar of the Ice King?” a curious voice suddenly rang out.

“I am afraid another foolhardy person has entered the mystic realm. He’s so unlucky to have encountered the Ice King the moment he entered. I am afraid the Ice King is going to gain yet another notch on its belt,” another voice answered.

Ye Qingtang quietly peeked out from her hiding place as the voices approached. She saw...

Two skeletons trudging across the snowy grounds, tilting their heads as if trying to listen to something.

The Undead Clan?!

Ye Qingtang thought of the Undead Clan the moment she saw those skeletons. But on second thought, she detected something different.

The Undead Clan radiated a thick aura of death, which was lacking from these two skeletons. Instead, they exuded a vibe that only living humans possessed.

They were... human?

Before Ye Qingtang could ascertain if those two skeletons were part of the Undead Clan, the snowy mound in front of her started to move.
