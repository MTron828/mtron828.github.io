Chapter 2233: A Gathering (2)

Behind the massive beast was a dense army of soldiers in black armor. They were garbed in full black, revealing only pairs of cold eyes.

“Black Moon Palace?” Ye Qingtang couldn’t help being shocked by the sight of those black-armored soldiers.

The Black Moon Palace was a top faction in the Second Domain. Even the powerful Crimson League would have to quietly stand aside to them. And the Black Moon Palace was not part of this mainland, but to think that they had appeared here?

Eyes scanning the area, Ye Qingtang saw that the number of factions which had gathered here had already far surpassed her expectations.

Spy Cloud, Falling Water Pavilion, Void Door...

The number of factions which Ye Qingtang could recognize already numbered in the dozens. Not to mention those whom she had never heard of.

“Is the information released by the Temple of Paragon accurate? That the fiendcelestial’s tomb is really here?” An elder from the Falling Water Pavilion commented as he scanned the crowd.

“Since it was released by the Temple of Paragon, it must be correct.” Another Void Door member replied.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

The Temple of Paragon.

What did this have to do with the Temple of Paragon?

In her previous life, she had never heard of the Temple of Paragon having an interest in the Evil Soul Forest.

It was all very puzzling. This matter was developing in a very bizarre manner.

In her previous life, the various factions did not make such a major campaign against the Evil Soul Forest. But this time was different from her previous life.

“Since the Temple of Paragon pointed out the location of the fiendcelestial’s tomb, it must be accurate. The Temple of Paragon has already announced that anyone who can enter the fiendcelestial’s tomb and hand over the fiendcelestial’s eye to them, they would receive a reward from the temple.”

All those at present were top factions from the Second Domain. Every single one of them were dominant forces in the mainland. But now, they had all gathered here in hopes of getting a reward from the mighty Temple of Paragon.

They wanted something inside the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

“The fiendcelestial’s eye? How did the Temple of Paragon know that this thing exists here?”

“Although I don’t know how, since they know it, that knowledge must be accurate.”

“The legendary fiendcelestial’s eye can see through all disguises. It can see through skin and flesh, through one’s soul... what does the Temple of Paragon want with the fiendcelestial’s eye?”

Everyone was well aware of the high status of the Temple of Paragon in the Second Domain. They were already very interested in the fiendcelestial’s hidden treasure. Now, the Temple of Paragon had publicly released the location of the fiendcelestial’s tomb. It was a massive opportunity to anyone here who could obtain that fiendcelestial’s eye.

Whether it was the fiendcelestial’s hidden treasure or the fiendcelestial’s eye, it was very attractive to them. If they could obtain either one of those treasures, and make use of the fiendcelestial’s eye to establish good relations with the Temple of Paragon, it would be a very good thing.

Everyone at present had the same thoughts. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ye Qingtang heard the crowd’s discussions. She was shocked, especially after hearing the part about the fiendcelestial’s eye.

She had wondered why the various factions had suddenly invaded the Evil Soul Forest so many years in advance. So... it was because of the Temple of Paragon.

And that fiendcelestial’s eye.

Ye Qingtang was silent.

If she guessed correctly, the Temple of Paragon wanted the fiendcelestial’s eye to use it on her.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had not been captured by the Temple of Paragon. As a result, the temple had no use for the fiendcelestial’s eye.

But things were different in this life.
