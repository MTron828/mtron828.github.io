Chapter 1701: Top Ten (2)

In the elimination battles, Qiu Ci had displayed astonishing fighting skills. No one expected this timid young lady, who didn’t even dare to look anyone in the eye, was even more ferocious and terrifying than a demon when she fought.

Apart from the two Qiu Family fighters, the other two were a young man from the Wu Family and the Jiang family’s Jiang Shaobai.

With Ye Qingtang’s victory, the Jiang family now had two people inside the top ten. Elder Qian and the others were very satisfied with this result.

In this way, the top ten had been decided and the Jiang family had managed to regain some respect. It was hard for Elder Qian and the rest to contain the smiles of joy on their faces. They were also extremely happy with Ye Qingtang’s efforts.

The Jiang family were in a celebratory mood, but the Mu family and the Baili family were in turmoil.

Unexpectedly, the Baili family had lost a talented young fighter. Even more painful to them was the fact that Baili Xuanyun had died in the hands of Ye Qingtang.

Meanwhile, over at the Mu family side, Mu Ruxue was crying and wailing. Still refusing to back down, she sought out Mu Feiruo and demanded her to attack Ye Qingtang when they entered the mystic realm.

It was very common for fighters to suffer injury or death inside the mystic realm. But Mu Feiruo remained silent on Mu Ruxue’s request, causing the latter to grit her teeth in anger.

The Martial Arts Championship had propped the young talents of all the various clans onto history’s stage. Apart from those who were already famous, Ye Qingtang and Qiu Ci were the ones who had caught the attention of the crowd.

These two had been completely disregarded previously, but had let everyone see their hidden power today.

The top ten had emerged and the ones chosen to enter the mystic realm were also confirmed. After just a few days’ rest, they would step directly into the mystic realm.

Elder Qian and the rest specially requested Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai to see them so that they could discuss the mystic realm.

“The mystic realm in the Island of Immortal Footsteps possesses unknown depths. You must be very careful when you enter. We are not asking for the two of you to try and gain as much as possible while inside. The most important thing is to protect yourself.” Elder Qian was no longer smiling, but instead looked very stern.

“I wonder what the mystic realm is like?” Ye Qingtang mused.

Elder Qian shook his head.

“I don’t know.”

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback.

Although the Jiang family had lost in the previous few Martial Arts Championship, they did have some very powerful predecessors who had entered the mystic realm before. How could they not know?

Elder Qian seemed to have noticed Ye Qingtang’s doubts so he continued, “The mystic realm of the Island of Immortal Footsteps is very special. It is different every single time one enters it. The Jiang family members who had entered it previously, compared their experiences and found that nothing was the same. So each entry is like a fresh start, no matter how many times one has entered the mystic realm. Why else do you think those people from the previous competition fought for the chance to enter once again...” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The mystic realm in the Island of Immortal Footsteps was also called the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm. It was like it encompassed everything in the world. It was a different scenario everytime one entered the realm, nothing could be predicted.

Ye Qingtang was stunned by his words. She had struggled so hard to enter the top ten just so she could find clues about her own mother.

But now...

The mystic realm she was going to enter would be completely different from the one her mother entered?

How was she to find any clues then...?

Ye Qingtang suddenly felt that she was very tragic.
