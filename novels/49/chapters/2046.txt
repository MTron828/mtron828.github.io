Chapter 2047: Underground World (1)

The Ancient You Clan had kept their powers in the west region well-hidden. Ye Qingtang and You Qiong took a few days before they finally found the spot that was marked on the map.

When they finally reached the exact location, all they saw was a stretch of mountains. There wasn’t anyone from the Ancient You Clan at all.

“Is the map fake?” Ye Qingtang looked at the stretch of mountains and her brows furrowed.

“No.” Ning Luo suddenly spoke.

Ye Qingtang looked towards him and he just closed his eyes, seemingly feeling something.

“I can sense that... Master is here.”

Ning Luo opened his eyes. It has been a long since he last felt this way. The breath was weak, but he was certain that Little You Yun was somewhere around the area.

He couldn’t confirm where she was since the breath was too weak. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ning Luo’s words made Ye Qingtang’s heart flutter.

On the other hand, You Qiong’s gaze shifted around. A thought suddenly struck him.

“I think I know where the Ancient You Clan’s men are now.”

Ye Qingtang looked at You Qiong.

You Qiong’s facial injuries had started recovering since he started applying medicine to it. All that was left behind were gruesome-looking scars. At that moment, he had no time to explain anything to Ye Qingtang. He just leaped and flew onto the highest peak among the stretch of mountains.

Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo followed right after him.

As You Qiong stood on the peak, his eyes crinkled while looking in the direction of the sun.

“Back when I was still with the Ancient You Clan, they had a secret stronghold. It was only because of some accident that the Clan Master and elders decided to change the location. They considered various locations, and the west region was one of the options...”

Ten thousand years ago, You Qiong was still the Great Elder of the Ancient You Clan. At his position, he was naturally involved in such confidential matters of the Ancient You Clan.

“If I’m not wrong, the location of the stronghold is right beneath that mountain.” You Qiong lifted his hand, pointing at the location right beneath the sun.

The summit virtually had no presence as it hid among the other mountains. It wasn’t noticeable at all.

“Are you sure?” Ning Luo looked at You Qiong cautiously.

You Qiong nodded. “I talked to the Clan Master and the other elders about the change of location and I know that they considered the west region before.”

Hearing this, Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo’s eyes flashed with excitement. At that moment, Ning Luo wanted to fly towards that mountain but You Qiong stopped him.

“Hold on.”

“What’s the matter?” Ning Luo was perplexed.

You Qiong turned to look at Ye Qingtang, clasping his hands respectfully as he said, “Holy Lord, you should not use ordinary ways if you want to find the Ancient You Clan’s location.”

“The Ancient You Clan’s stronghold should be hidden somewhere underground and all entrances will be heavily guarded. If you’re planning to just barge inside, you will not be able to hide from them. You would expose yourself and not be able to find a thing.”

“Do you have any ideas?” Ye Qingtang looked at You Qiong.

“I... certainly have ideas. I was originally from the Ancient You Clan after all. If I enter the place, no one would suspect a thing. However, I would have to trouble the two of you to disguise yourselves before we head inside together.”
