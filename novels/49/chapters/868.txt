Chapter 869 Can You Run Away?

The three of them were silent after hearing what Ye Qingtang said.

As what Ye Qingtang said, Perfected Gu Yun was at the Divine Arcane Supremacy level, but they were just at the Virtual Arcane Supremacy level. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After a while, Gu Tianhe said, “It’s okay. We do not need to worry about that too much. No matter how strong he is, his ability will be limited at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord level on piece of mainland.”

“That’s right. There’s no chance of escaping if we meet Perfected Gu Yun outside… We will not even get the chance to fight back. However, everyone here is at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord level. We can try our best to fight and kill him. We will be rewarded when we get back to the academy!” Feng Wudang nodded and said.

Li Bingxue was also tempted upon hearing Feng Wudang and Gu Tianhe’s words.

“Senior Sister Ye, you cannot leave! We can combine our forces and kill Perfected Gu Yun. Then, we shall split the credits,” Feng Wudang said immediately.

If Ye Qingtang left, the three of them would not dare to challenge Perfected Gu Yun.

“Okay. Since you’re so determined, I shall thank you for your help.” Ye Qingtang folded her fists towards the three people and said.

“Haha, that’s what we should do. We should thank you for such a rare opportunity to kill Perfected Gu Yun!” Feng Wudang was slightly excited as he said.

Ye Qingtang discussed strategies with the three of them instantly.

Soon, the three of them left, and Ye Qingtang remained at somewhere far away.

Ye Qingtang crossed her legs and sat on the ground to consolidate her cultivation.

Ye Qingtang gently touched the Spirit Ring that Ling Yan mentioned. She hoped that the ring would be as powerful as Ling Yan described. Hopefully, the power it contained would be able to kill Perfected Gu Yun with one attack.

Though Ye Qingtang had no relationships with the three people, she found that the three of them were kind after spending a few days with them. In all honesty, it was not that they were going to fight against Perfected Gu Yun just because they wanted to help her. They were just manipulated by Ling Yan as he knew about their greed towards rewards. However, no matter what, Ye Qingtang did not want anything to happen to them. She might still use the ring at the critical moment.

The sky appeared to be golden in color at dawn.

Swoosh!

A piercing sound was heard.

An elder appeared in mid-air at the next second and looked downward at Ye Qingtang.

“Young lady.” A cold voice came from his mouth.

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes and looked towards the elder as she heard the voice. Her face was full of confusion, and she asked, “May I know who are you? What do you want?”

Perfected Gu Yun waved his sleeve and said, “Are you a student of the Supreme Academy?”.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“

“Do you know Ling Yan!” Perfected Gu Yun continued.

Ye Qingtang’s face changed immediately, and she said, “Ling Yan Highness… Of course, but he doesn’t know me.”

“Oh? Is that true? Then I’m curious about why he would ward off the sword for you.” Perfected Gu Yun scoffed.

“You… How did you know!” Ye Qingtang stood up instantly and stared at the elder.

“Humph, young lady, you will die here today!” The moment he finished his words, he dashed towards Ye Qingtang.

However, before Perfected Gu Yun could get close to Ye Qingtang, she used all her strength and ran towards the forest with her full speed.

“Humph, can you run away from me?” Perfected Gu Yun sneered and followed up.
