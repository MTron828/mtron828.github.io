The man’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang impassively. “I don’t know.”

“Don’t know?” Ye Qingtang was speechless. But that sounded about right. He did not even remember his own name. How could he know how long he had been here?

“Brother Tian, I’m new here. Are there any rules?” Ye Qingtang walked to the man’s side and asked humbly.

This man looked rather old and experienced. He was so old that he had even forgotten his own name. Anyway, since she was going to be imprisoned here forever, it was the right thing to ask more questions.

“Suffering,” the man said. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Qingtang was speechless. He really did not give her any hope at all.

“Alright.” In the end, Ye Qingtang could only nod and accept reality.

However, Ye Qingtang was still curious. Those fiendcelestials were suffering endlessly. How could this man chat with her so leisurely?

“Brother Tian, will I be like them after I die?” Ye Qingtang pointed at the distant fiendcelestials.

The man nodded. “Even worse.”

Ye Qingtang was once again struck dumb. Was this man here to torture her? She was about to die anyway and he could have just told her a white lie so that she wouldn’t die in despair.

“You have karma power in you. Are you a descendant of the karma bloodline?” The man asked after a long moment passed.

“Ah… ‘m not.” Ye Qingtang shook her head. She did not know why she had karma power.

“Whatever.” The man did not seem to care.

“Brother Tian, do you suffer here every day?” Ye Qingtang continued to ask.

“What is suffering?” the man asked her back.

Ye Qingtang felt that she was about to go crazy. Why was this man so crazy… Had he been here for too long such that his soul had already collapsed?

“This place is filled with wandering spirits who endure endless suffering,” the man said.

Ye Qingtang nodded. “I know.”

“lm hungry. Let’s eat something first.” Suddenly, the man stood up without warning. His gaze landed on a fiendcelestial in the distance. Immediately after, the man’s lips parted slightly.

In the next second, right before Ye Qingtang’s shocked eyes, the man swallowed that fiendcelestial!

Ye Qingtang was stunned. Was she dreaming?

‘What had just happened? How could something so surreal happen?

This man ate a fiendcelestial!

“Ican taste resentment, grievance… and despair.” The man seemed to have eaten his fill and sat cross-legged on the ground again.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. Would she be eaten by this man?

However, from a certain perspective, it shouldn’t be a bad thing for those trapped and suffering souls to be eaten by this man, right?

“Brother Tian, do you want to eat me too? After I die, why don’t you eat my soul too!” Ye Qingtang suggested. In this way, she might be able to reincarnate and be reborn. Being eaten was better than suffering here forever.

“This is the first time I’ve heard such a request.” The man stared at Ye Qingtang and shook his head. “You won’t die. There’s karma fire in your body. You can live in suffering.”

“Live in suffering?” Ye Qingtang was stunned. She might as well die!

“It’s better to live in suffering than to die,” the man said.

Ye Qingtang was struck dumb. Could she live without suffering?

“But since you can’t die, what are you doing here…” The man fell into deep thought..
