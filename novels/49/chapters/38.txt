Chapter 39: Turning the Sky Wheel (1)

While harboring such intentions, Ye Xun turned the Sky Wheel in the next instant.

Ye Xun might not be capable of exerting much strength, but with her good fortune, the Sky Wheel rotated nonetheless.

In the flash of an eye, the wheel completed a full rotation. When its tumultuous roar came to a halt, Ye Xun’s eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

After witnessing her result, Duan Tianrao was pleased as well.

“Didn’t expect Miss Ye Xun to improve this much. I remembered she only managed half a round last year… it’s a full round this time.”

“No wonder she has gotten so much love from Mr Duan Tianrao. With her talent and looks, if he becomes the head of the household in the future, she’ll be a worthy First Lady.”

The common folk were impressed by Ye Xun’s progress and began to stand in favor of Duan Tianrao’s marriage with her instead.

However, ….

“Wait a sec, if she’s representing the Duan household, what about the Ye household?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Many started raising doubts in their minds.

For the past years, it was either Ye You or Ye Xun whom represented the Ye household. But now, Ye You had left to join the Cloud-breakers’ clan and Ye Xun had already given her blessing as part of the Duan household. From the way things stand, Ye Qingtang was the only one remaining who could represent the Ye household.

If it was still in the past, Ye Qingtang going on stage as a representative would be a given, but…. her spirit root had just shattered. How could she turn the wheel in that condition?

Having realized that, the crowd started focusing their attention on where members of the Ye household were.

Ye Ling had a wretched look on his face as he stood before the crowd’s prying eyes. Although he knew Duan Tianrao would renounce the engagement, never in his wildest dreams would he expect Ye Xun to be in cahoots with him, having reached the stage where they had even declared their engagement.

At this moment, Ye Ling had no time to pay heed to what others were thinking. He turned his gaze hastily towards Ye Qingtang standing beside him, as all sorts of emotions deluged his train of thoughts.

He had intended to let Ye Xun be their representative, but never in a million years did he think a situation like this would occur.

“Tang Tang….” Ye Ling’s stricken face was contorted with worry. Only the younger generation from the three noble families could go on the altar’s stage. Even if he wanted to go up himself, it would be against the rules of their custom.

Now, she’s the only one….

Ye Qingtang had stood silently beside Ye Ling all this time. Even when Duan Tianrao openly replaced her with Ye Xun in his engagement, she remained indifferent.

But when she saw Ye Ling’s worry-stricken look, she could not help but to drop her gaze slightly.

Ye Ling heaved a deep breath before making his decision, “Tang Tang, you’ll have to go on stage to represent our family.”

Ye Ling would avoid having her go on stage at all costs, if he was not left without a choice.

Whether Ye Qingtang was able to turn the wheel did not matter to him. All he wished was for the event to end as soon as possible.

Ye Qingtang nodded meekly. Her slightly lowered eyes glimmered with an inkling of craftiness. As she raised her eyes and looked towards Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun standing together as a couple on stage, beneath her face veil, a faint smirk played across her lips.

In the next moment, she gradually approached the stage.

Her appearance attracted the attention of many common folk amongst the surrounding crowd.

Many harbored mixed emotions towards this young lady from the Ye household. Even from the time before her spirit root shattered, she had never went on stage, not to mention appearing in public.

Therefore, today could be considered her debut, under the watchful eyes of the entire city.
