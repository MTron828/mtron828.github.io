Jiang Yu’s ability was almost all gone now. His finger movement just now was a pure technique without any power.

However, Ye Qingtang could feel the pressure from the finger.

“How is it?” Jiang Yu looked at Ye Qingtang’s pale face and asked.

“Domain Monarch Founder, your finger technique is indeed strong.” Ye Qingtang replied sincerely.

She did not suspect at all that if his finger touched her glabella, her head would explode under the pressure.

“All the skills of the Jiang Family consist of three levels. After you get used to it, you can attain initial success and then phenomenal success; the last is perfected success. If you want to master more than one skill, you need a long time to train and practice.”

A skill that appeared to be mediocre was actually more difficult to master. If one could master such a skill, there would definitely be incredible effects.

Jiang Yu told Ye Qingtang the foundations of the finger technique one by one. Ye Qingtang listened carefully and remembered them all.

There were countless skills in the world, but they were all derived from palm, finger, or leg techniques. The four sets of techniques that Jiang Yu mentioned were extremely important.

“Now, I’ll teach you the movement technique.” Jiang Yu looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

After witnessing how powerful Jiang Yu’s finger technique was, Ye Qingtang paid 120-percent attention. Jiang Yu’s finger technique must already be in the realm of perfected success. Though he lost all his cultivation, the power of the skill was still strong.

Jiang Yu nodded as he saw the serious sight from Ye Qingtang.

Jiang Yu folded his hands by his back again. His tiny body remained stationary. Just as Ye Qingtang began wondering what was so special about Jiang Family’s movement technique, Jiang Yu suddenly took a step.

This step was very slow. He lifted up his foot slowly and put down at an even slower speed. The moment he lifted up his foot, he was surrounded by an intense and powerful aura.

And the moment his foot landed, a gust of wind spread out from his foot. A virtual golden dragon suddenly surrounded Jiang Yu!

Ye Qingtang could feel the breath of the dragon dashing towards her face. Her hair and sleeves were swinging in the wind.

“This is known as the Dragon Steps.” Jiang Yu only took one step and withdrew all the aura. The golden dragon dispersed, but the air in the surroundings was still filled with pressure.

Based on Jiang Yu’s Dragon Steps standards, the house might collapse if he took a few more steps.

Given that he did not use any spirit energy.

Ye Qingtang watched carefully and was shocked. The step looked normal, but it seemed that it could crush the world.

She could not even imagine the power of the Dragon Step if Jiang Yu used it at his prime.

Ye Qingtang watched and learned carefully. Jiang Yu was satisfied; no matter how talented she was, there was still hope to improve if she was willing to learn.

After that, Jiang Yu showcased the swordplay and palm techniques one by one and corrected Ye Qingtang patiently. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang remembered Jiang Yu’s every word and did not dare slack off.

The foundation skills looked easy, but it would take a long time to master. Any mistake along the way would ruin everything. There was no easy way out.

As Jiang Yu was teaching Ye Qingtang the four sets of skills, a special guest appeared at the Taiyuan Valley...
