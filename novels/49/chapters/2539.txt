Chapter 2540: Killing An Immortal Emperor (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No matter how foolish the owner of the relay station was, he knew that this group of people were not to be trifled with. With such a large group, something major must have happened. How would he dare to show any carelessness?

The owner of the relay station immediately walked into the crowd and carefully examined each and every one of them.

After a long time, the owner of the relay station finally withdrew from the crowd and walked to the side of the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince. With an ingratiating smile, he said, “My Lord, I have already looked at every one of them. The earliest guests checked in four days ago while the latest ones checked in today. There are a total of 63 people. There is absolutely no mistake.”

The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince looked thoughtful when he heard the relay station owner’s words. After a moment, his gaze landed on the relay station owner and he continued, “From yesterday until today, did anyone leave soon after checking in?”

The owner of the relay station hurriedly shook his head and said with certainty, “My Lord, definitely not. For the past two days, there have only been guests checking in. No one checked out, and I remember it very clearly.”

“Hmmm…” The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince waved his golden fan. There were a total of 63 people here. Which one of them looked like an Immortal Emperor practitioner?

Even if they failed to break through to the Immortal Emperor level, they would at the very least be at the Emperor level, right below the Immortal Emperor stage. They would be peak Emperor level practitioners.

However, where was this great peak Emperor level practitioner?

“First Prince, do you think… the Sky Vault Division’s Branch Master had his physical body destroyed and his soul fled. Those disciples who escaped said that it was done by a dog. Could that dog be somehow linked to that Immortal Emperor…? Or could it be that the Immortal Emperor is a dog?” An old man from the Sky Vault Sect walked over to the First Prince and whispered.

The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince was taken aback by this. When he returned to his senses, he could not help but find it laughable.

A dog was linked to an Immortal Emperor? What a great joke!

“So you think that the Immortal Emperor was the one who destroyed the body of our Sky Vault Sect Branch Master?” The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince glanced at the old man.

The old man pondered for a moment before saying softly, “It’s hard to say. Those disciples are unable to recognize the powers of an Immortal Emperor. They only said that the one who destroyed the Branch Master’s body was a yellow dog with unfathomable strength. Furthermore, the timing is such a coincidence. I can only say that it’s possible.”

“Got it. No need to tell anyone,” the First Prince replied. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

There were two reasons for not announcing this.

Firstly, this was news unique to their Sky Vault Sect. Perhaps it even had something to do with that Immortal Emperor. Secondly, even if it had nothing to do with this, the body of a Sky Vault Sect Branch Master had been destroyed by a dog. If this news got out, he would definitely become the laughingstock of all the major factions. Their Sky Vault Sect would be utterly disgraced.

The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince’s gaze swept across the crowd. His gaze landed on Ye Qingtang, who was carrying the big yellow dog.

Ye Qingtang frowned when she felt the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince’s stare. She had a bad feeling about this, but the First Prince soon retracted his gaze.

...

“My Lord, there are a total of 63 people. We have examined them all. The strongest person is only a Divine Lord. There is no one above the Divine Lord level.”

A middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan spoke to the white-haired elder.

The elder glanced at the 63 people and nodded slightly, indicating that he already knew.

This was also within his expectations. If that Immortal Emperor was really among this crowd, there was no way he would have let them drag him out in this manner.. A person who was capable of ascending the Immortal Emperor stage would be at the peak Emperor level at the very least.
