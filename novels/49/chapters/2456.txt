Of course, the big yellow dog was not so foolish as to expose Ye Qingtang.

“Have you all considered the risks? If anything bad happens, I don’t want to be held responsible,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Boss, I’ll come with you!” Qin Feng was the first to express his stand.

“Me too. As long as Boss is around, I’m not afraid of any dangers.” Mu Ziying nodded in agreement.

“Space Technique! A brand new and unknown world! Being able to experience it for myself won’t be a loss even if I die! If I can come out alive, this will definitely be enough for me to brag about for the rest of my life. I don’t care about anything else, I want to go!” Lei Yan said hurriedly.

In any case, staying in this palace was as good as just waiting for death. Only a fool would not agree to try. Needless to say, Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher and students all agreed without hesitation.

Even if their luck was extremely bad, going to a completely new and unfamiliar world was still better than waiting for death here. Moreover, they didn’t think their luck would be that bad. Perhaps they would be directly transported to the outside world…

One had to be optimistic. If you only thought about all the bad things that could happen, you might as well just drop dead now, no?

At that moment, Wen Qi and the other Vice-Presidents outside looked at the screen in confusion. They were all bewildered and did not know what Ye Qing and the rest were talking about.

Just as Wen Qi was about to speak, the screen instantly fell into darkness, and there was no longer any image left.

“What happened?!” Wen Qi asked in surprise.

The Flying Star Academy Vice-President encountered the same situation as Wen Qi. Their screen had also turned dark.

“Why did the video-recording ball malfunction?” One of the Vice-Presidents frowned deeply.

“Unless something in particular happened.”

“What thing in particular?!”

“Spatial fluctuation…”

…

When Ye Qingtang opened her eyes again, she was greeted by a lush green forest. The unbearable stench of blood and grievance in the air was no longer present. It was peaceful.

Actually, Ye Qingtang did not know if she could bring others into her Deity Ocean space. It had been a desperate, last resort kind of move. She did not expect it to really work.

“This is…” Nangong Lie hurriedly got up and looked around. He breathed in the fresh air greedily.” We’re out! “

Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher also hurriedly got up and looked around excitedly.

“Teacher Ye Qing… you’re really a god!” Lu Yuanxiang said to her.

He never thought that Ye Qing actually knew the legendary Space Technique… this was simply unbelievable!

“Teacher Ye Qing, you’re my savior!” The Flying Star Academy teacher seemed even more excited than Lu Yuanxiang. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Initially, he thought that he would be trapped in the palace until he died. Who would have thought that he would be breathing fresh air in the outside world again?

“Hahaha, looks like our luck isn’t that bad. On the contrary, it’s very good. Teacher Ye Qing used Space Technique to bring us back to the outside world!” The Flying Star Academy teacher suddenly gritted his teeth and continued. “Those bastards from Universe City must give us an explanation!”

Ye Qingtang held her forehead. These people still did not understand the situation…

A soft sigh left her lips.

Her Deity Ocean power had been at low levels in the first place. Now that she had brought so many people in, her Deity Ocean power had been completely exhausted. She would need a period of time to recover.

And during this period, she couldn’t continue to connect with the Deity Ocean and take them away.

So, why were they so excited?
