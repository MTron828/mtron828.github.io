Chapter 787 A Fierce Struggle (1)

“Stop!”

Just as Ye Qingtang grabbed Qin Chen, a furious holler rang.

The premier, Qin Long, was rushing over with a large troop.

Qin Chen immediately heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that his father had rushed over in time.

“Father, save me!”

“Young Sir Ye, I’ve heard my son talking about you, and my Qin family has the intention of befriending you. May I know why you’re suddenly attacking my son today?” Qin Long walked over with a grim expression as he narrowed his eyes at Ye Qingtang, who was a few steps away.

He brought men over after receiving the news earlier on, but he did not know… how things reached this stage even when he originally wanted Qin Chen to rope Ye Qingtang in.

With Qin Chen in Ye Qingtang’s hands currently, Qin Long did not dare to adopt too tough of a stance.

Ye Qingtang looked emotionlessly at Qin Long, the mastermind who brought disaster and chaos to the Nine Nights Dynasty.

“Father, he wants to stop the jail wagon and rescue Qu Xiangyang!” Qin Chen said.

Qin Long frowned slightly. His eyes swept across the haphazard scene before him, and a trace of confusion flashed across his eyes when he saw the unscathed Qu Xiangyang.

How was Qu Xiangyang related to this young man? Why did this young man want to rescue him?

“Young Sir Ye, Qu Xiangyang committed a serious offense and is a criminal of the Nine Nights Dynasty. A family has its rules, and a country has its laws. I’m afraid it’s against the law if you wish to rescue this person,” Qin Long said with a sincere expression.

“What offense did he commit?” Ye Qingtang asked coldly.

Qin Long smiled and nodded at a guard beside him subsequently. That guard stepped forward and handed a stack of files to Qin Long.

Qin Long publicly opened the file of which listed many offenses.

“As the City Lord of Fuling City, Qu Xiangyang concealed the true state of affairs from above and below oneself, behaved unscrupulously, and even persecuted the citizens of Fuling City, causing many to die. Why must you rescue such a criminal, Young Sir Ye?”

Fury boiled within Qu Xiangyang as he looked at the groundless crimes. “Qin Long, those people I killed are your supporters. They are then the ones who tyrannized Fuling City. Not only did they forcefully snatch female citizens, but they even slaughtered everyone from their family. What wrong do I have for killing them?!”

Qin Long responded with a calm expression. “A family has its rules, and a country has its laws. If they did something wrong, you just need to put them on trial. Why do you need to lynch them?”

“Put them on trial? Ha… In the entire Nine Nights Dynasty, who dares to try someone from the Qin family? Even if I put them on trial, those evildoers will still eventually go unpunished and be set free,” Qu Xiangyang said coldly.

Qin Long looked at Qu Xiangyang, who could no longer hold his fury. “The people are already dead. No matter what you say, isn’t it all because of you?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He directly looked at Ye Qingtang right after and said, “Young Sir Ye, you are a reasonable person. Since you are doubtful of Qu Xiangyang’s offense, why don’t you release my son first? After that, we can slowly discuss.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the sanctimonious Qin Long coldly. In her previous life, she stayed in the Nine Nights Dynasty for quite some time, and she was very clear of the Qin family’s way. In the Nine Nights Dynasty, there was nothing that the Qin family clan did not dare to do.

How many loyal officials fell to the Qin family’s evil schemes?

How many citizens were butchered by the Qin family?

If she believed in Qin Long’s words, she would truly be a fool.

“If I release your son, I’m afraid you will never let me leave the monarch city,” Ye Qingtang said indifferently.

A vicious look flashed across Qin Long’s eyes.

“Does this mean… you wish to acquiesce to something after having refused my first overture?”
