Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang kept the Demonic Blood Sword in its sheath once again and bent down to pick up the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

The moment her hands touched it, she was attacked by a coldness which caused her mind to be slightly dazed.

Ye Qingtang immediately used her primordial qi to isolate this coldness, and her complexion finally turned slightly better.

“You!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The black-robed person glared at Ye Qingtang furiously.

“It’s you who is too careless.” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly as she held the Ice Frost Divine Sword. “I’ve signed an equality contract with this Fiendcelestial Beast, and we can communicate within our hearts. But you saw that it was an infant and never paid any attention to it. If you could be more cautious, even if it was just to be on your guard against this seemingly-useless Fiendcelestial Beast, I would not have obtained this Ice Frost Divine Sword so easily.”

“Give it to me.” The black-robed person stretched a hand out to Ye Qingtang.

“Ha…” Ye Qingtang chuckled. “Come and take it yourself if you want it.”

Then, the black-robed person indeed walked towards Ye Qingtang in large strides.

However, Ye Qingtang waved the Ice Frost Divine Sword in her hand before he neared her. In an instant, an extremely terrifying force of the ice frost froze the entire hall. Had the black-robed person not dodged in time, he would have ended up like this palace.

“Ye Qingtang, do you think that the Ice Frost Divine Sword belongs to you now that you obtained it?” The black-robed person asked.

“No matter whether it belongs to me or not, it definitely does not belong to you at this moment.” Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly.

Before waiting for the black-robed person to say anything again, Ye Qingtang waved the Ice Frost Divine Sword and flew towards him.

Although the Ice Frost Divine Sword was not yet resurrected, it was an authentic Heaven-grade divine weapon as in the legends, and the force of one strike was extremely frightening!

Facing Ye Qingtang who wielded the Ice Frost Divine Sword, the black-robed person could only dodge and did not dare to fight head-on.

“Ye Qingtang, why must you protect the sinners of this mainland!” The black-robed person inquired in a cold tone.

“Ha. You’re a coward who bullies the weak and is afraid of the powerful.” Ye Qingtang scoffed as she chased after the black-robed person.

“What did you say?!” The black-robed person hollered in fury.

“If you were true enough to that lady, what you should do is head to the Central Mainland and annihilate that ancient clan which mutinied! You should not think of how to destroy this mainland. If the Dimension Wall is really broken, powerful figures from that ancient clan would be attracted here. They would destroy this mainland and obtain the lady’s Spiritual Abode… Is this really what you wish to see? Those people are the ones who killed her clan and family, caused her to be homeless, and forced her to leave the Central Mainland. Are you… loyal or disloyal!”

The black-robed person was dumbfounded.

Ye Qingtang’s words seemed to have poured cold water on him.

Previously, he only thought that it was the people on this mainland who killed the lady. Thus, he wanted to seek revenge by using blood and misery to cleanse this mainland.

However, if that ancient clan obtained the lady’s Spiritual Abode…

Swoosh!

At this moment of trance, Ye Qingtang had already neared the black-robed person.

Ye Qingtang clutched onto his black robe, exerted force in her palms, and threw the black robe off.

However, after seeing the face of the black-robed person, Ye Qingtang’s eyes suddenly dilated. She was in extreme disbelief.

This was a face that Ye Qingtang was extremely familiar with, yet it appeared especially foreign right now…

Never had she expected that the black-robed person would actually be him.

“How can it be… Why is it you?!” Ye Qingtang took several steps back, unwilling to believe this reality.
