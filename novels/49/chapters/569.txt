Chapter 570 Hell of Avicinaraka (1)

It was already night.

A blood-colored crescent hung on the sky. Its gleam shone through the clouds and completely enshrouded the entire city.

There was a slight smell of blood lingering around as though it had long been combined with the air.

Two extremely strange and ghastly buildings were situated at both sides of the city while an enormous central square laid right ahead.

Many sculptures stood in the square silently.

One of the sculptures was made with an unknown material, but its form and appearance were very solemn and righteous, resembling a Buddha that seemed to be able to suppress all evil in the world.

Reaching a height of about ten meters tall, that sculpture with a Buddha face was lifelike and raised a huge vajra in its hands.

However, the skull of an elderly was hung on that vajra, and the neck that was slit was filled with dried blood.

The elderly’s mouth was wide open, and horror filled his turbid eyes. It was as though he had witnessed the frightening birth of something that should not exist.

“That person… seems to be an Elder of Lingyun Sect…” The Blood Moon Elder frowned as he inspected for a long time before speaking to Ye Qingtang.

Previously, Ye Qingtang had already seen the appearance of Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect, and it was indeed an Elder of a super sect whose martial skills were at least above the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three.

“This person’s skills are not bad, but he actually died here… Other than his head, his body is nowhere to be found…” An inauspicious feeling arose in the Blood Moon Elder’s heart.

Every corner of this city felt strange, and it felt like one could see but not physically touch anything here.

“It’s actually…” Ye Qingtang’s body shuddered slightly, and surprise emerged in her eyes. “Hell of Avicinaraka realm!”

“Hell of Avicinaraka realm?!”

The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in puzzlement.

“It’s said that Xuanling Sect’s mystic realm was a miniature version of a battlefield in the ancient era in a Spiritual Abode. It was then brought back by the then Xuanling Patriarch, who suppressed it with a Paragon divine treasure… After thousands of years of suppression, the demonic air was released and developed into many huge mystic realms…” There was a hint of seriousness on Ye Qingtang’s face as she explained. “In the past, the mystic realms that Xuanling Sect started were ordinary mystic realms, and the danger levels to normal sect disciples was at most only level four if the maximum level was hundred. The ordinary mystic realms would not exceed danger level five…” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Seeming to hear the meaning between Ye Qingtang’s words, the Blood Moon Elder slowly said, “So this mystic realm is…”

“Hundred Level Peril… Hell of… Avicinaraka!”

In the dark night, a gust of eerie wind blew across, sending a chill down the spines of Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder at the same time.

If Ye Qingtang knew that the mystic realm without the suppression of the sect’s heritage would actually become a Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka, she would definitely not enter!

Even if it meant giving up the Black Heaven Water, Ye Qingtang would never take the risk to enter here.

The so-called Hundred Level Peril was the scariest and most dangerous place in a sect mystic realm. For a normal danger level five mystic realm, if ten Xuanling Sect disciples entered, at least three or four people would die in it.

It was already extremely difficult for two to three people to walk out alive from a mystic realm that surpassed danger level six.

If one was unlucky enough to enter a danger level ten mystic realm, he or she did not need to struggle and only needed to wait for death…

Yet currently, the Hell of Avicinaraka… belonged to a Hundred Level Peril mystic realm…

Even if you were a son of heaven, you would eventually turn into ashes and sink in here eternally.
