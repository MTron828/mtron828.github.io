Chapter 744: Causing Trouble (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A sneer emerged on Li Jingwen’s face when he saw the Admirable Sky Peak disciples unsheathe their swords. In the entire Admirable Sky Peak, only the top disciple, Gu Yihan, could defeat him.

Now that Perfected Xuanchen became the acting Valley Master and had the intention of training Gu Yihan to be the next Peak Master of Admirable Sky Peak, even if Gu Yihan was present today, given Gu Yihan’s identity, it was inconvenient for him to interfere in the “learning exchange” between disciples.

“Great. I’ll teach you all a good lesson today.” A cold glint flashed across Li Jingwen’s eyes, and he immediately drew his sword out before charging towards the Admirable Sky Peak disciples.

The other Blue Cloud Peak disciples had a proud look when they saw Li Jingwen striking.

Li Jingwen’s skills were amazing and were not what these ordinary Admirable Sky Peak disciples could contend against.

In just the blink of an eye, many disciples were beaten to the ground by Li Jingwen.

Yan Shu and Yin Qingluo were about to attack Li Jingwen when they saw the sight.

“Call Eldest Senior Brother over quickly.” Before Yin Qingluo attacked, she immediately grabbed an Admirable Sky Peak disciple and said.

Gu Yihan was not in the peak today, and Li Jingwen had already attacked. Only by calling Eldest Senior Brother back could they suppress Li Jingwen.

After hearing that, that disciple hurried off to search for Gu Yihan.

Yin Qingluo and Yan Shu joined hands and blocked Li Jingwen’s move directly, giving the other disciples who were injured by Li Jingwen the chance for a breather.

“Li Jingwen, are you here today just to stir up trouble?” Yin Qingluo berated.

Li Jingwen’s brows were cocked up slightly as he scoffed. “So what if I am? Since Ye Chen from your Admirable Sky Peak can injure my Blue Cloud Peak disciples, why can’t I beat you all up?”

As he spoke, Li Jingwen directly launched an attack at Yin Qingluo’s face.

“Careful, Junior Sister Yin!” Yan Shu pulled Yin Qingluo over and used his sword to block Li Jingwen’s attack. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, a loud clank erupted when they clashed, and a cut was slashed on Yan Shu’s fingers from the impact.

In just an instant, Yin Qingluo and Yan Shu were locked in combat with Li Jingwen.

The other Admirable Sky Peak disciples were extremely anxious as they watched. Given their skills, they were simply not Li Jingwen’s opponent, and over ten people were injured by Li Jingwen in a short while just now.

“Where’s Ye Chen? This matter is started by him, but he is nowhere to be found and implicated us to suffer for nothing!”

The Admirable Sky Peak disciples’ expressions were extremely ugly when they saw the sight.

If Ye Qingtang did not offend the Blue Cloud Peak people, why would they be implicated?

Sheng Qianyu was extremely anxious. He was the clearest about the cause of this incident and was even more anxious when he heard the others complaining about Ye Qingtang. However, no one would listen no matter how much he explained now.

When Sheng Qianyu saw that Yin Qingluo and Yan Shu could not defeat Li Jingwen, he gritted his teeth quietly and immediately charged forward.

It was already extremely strenuous for Yin Qingluo and Yan Shu to focus on receiving Li Jingwen’s moves, and there were many injuries on them by then. Before they could react in time, they suddenly saw Sheng Qianyu rushing in.

“Junior Brother Sheng!”

Yin Qingluo was alarmed.

Sheng Qianyu was already in front of Li Jingwen.

Li Jingwen did not even bat Sheng Qianyu an eye and slashed at Sheng Qianyu with a sword directly.

That attack struck Sheng Qianyu’s shoulder, and a cut that was half a meter deep extended from his shoulder to his body.
