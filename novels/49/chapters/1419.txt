1420 Who Exactly Are You 1

In just the blink of an eye, the Ancient You Clan people and Elder Xu were in a tussle. In contrast, Beidou Demon Lord and Ye Qingtang, who were almost slaughtered by Elder Xu, were forgotten by everyone. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Little sister, what’s going on?” Beidou Demon Lord was fueled with energy after preparing to fight with his life. But why were the Jiang Family and Ancient You Clan fighting out of the blue?

Although Beidou Demon Lord was part of the demon clan, he had heard of these two top forces before as well.

It was rumored that these two forces were not on friendly terms but coexisted peacefully.

Why…

Were they suddenly fighting?

“Maybe the Jiang Family just has many enemies.” A smile plastered on Ye Qingtang’s face gradually.

The Ancient You Clan’s arrival was really timely.

Back in the First Mainland, Ye Qingtang disguised herself as someone from the Jiang Family only on the spur of the moment. But looking at it now, the effect was pretty good.

She reckoned that the Ancient You Clan had vehement hatred toward the Jiang Family and would make sure justice was served.

While the Jiang Family…

Was completely hidden in the dark.

Go ahead and attack… It’s best if they attack them till they die.

“Then we…” Beidou Demon Lord was a little dumbfounded.

“What are you still standing there for? When can we leave if not now?” Ye Qingtang grabbed Beidou Demon Lord’s finger and fled swiftly.

Elder Xu’s skills were rather amazing. Although the Ancient You Clan side won in numbers, Elder Xu might have some Dharma treasures on him, and it may be effortless for him to withdraw himself from the battle to kill her and Beidou Demon Lord.

While Ye Qingtang wanted to see if Ye You and Ye Xun would be killed along by the Ancient You Clan, she did not join in the fun in order to save her life.

Ye Qingtang fled swiftly while carrying the little white tiger in one arm and pulling Beidou Demon Lord with the other hand.

Ye You and the rest, who were encircled by the Ancient You Clan, noticed that Ye Qingtang escaped, and their expressions darkened immediately.

“Sister You, Ye Qingtang escaped!” Ye Xun exclaimed.

But before she could finish speaking, a person from the Ancient You Clan struck them with a scarlet blast of wind from his palm.

With a slight frown, Ye You pulled Ye Xun back and attacked the person.

It was not the time to care about Ye Qingtang’s escape right now.

As long as Ye Qingtang was in the Central Mainland, using the Jiang Family’s powers, finding her was child’s play.

Although these people from the Ancient You Clan were pretty skilled, that Elder was recently nominated, and his skills were not yet as profound as Elder Xu’s.

Elder Xu had to care about Ye You’s safety and naturally did not dare to hassle with them. He immediately used a talisman, grabbed Ye You and Ye Xun, and disappeared right before the Ancient You Clan people’s eyes.

…

The three people reappeared in the wild miles away.

“Sorry to trouble you, Elder Xu,” Ye You said with cupped fists.

“It’s fine. I just don’t know why the Ancient You Clan went berserk to attack us.” Elder Xu just could not understand it as they did not get into any conflict with the Ancient You Clan when they were in the First Mainland.

“The Ancient You Clan is ambitious. They have obtained the Spiritual Abode, and I’m afraid that they have the intention of replacing the Jiang Family to be the next Domain Mo. If they really have that ambition, wouldn’t they use anything as an excuse?” Ye You said.

Elder Xu frowned slightly.

“That Ye Qingtang really got lucky. Had the Ancient You Clan not appeared suddenly, she would definitely die here. I just don’t know how this evil woman would harm Sister You again in the future,” Ye Xun said while looking at Ye You worryingly.
