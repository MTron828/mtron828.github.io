At this instant, Elder Lin really could not smile anymore.

The cut on Zhu Changge’s waist was not shallow as blood dripped all over the ground. In addition, Fu Lingtian violently thumped on Zhu Changge’s injury, which caused Zhu Changge to be extremely pale. Zhu Changge instinctively wanted to force himself up, but Elder Mo’s voice suddenly rang.

“That’s enough, Zhu Changge.”

Zhu Changge’s face was ash-white as he stood with difficulty. His body was stiff. Looking at Fu Lingtian who was a few steps away from him, his eyes were filled with discontent. He was clearly just so close…

“Elder Mo!” Elder Lin’s face froze after hearing Elder Mo.

Nonetheless, Elder Mo shook his head and said, “If Zhu Changge continues on, he would lose his life here.”

Elder Mo’s words were like a pail of cold water that showered on Elder Lin. Elder Lin turned to look at Zhu Changge who was covered in blood, and his face paled.

Zhu Changge’s injuries were serious. Fu Lingtian managed to find an opportunity even during Zhu Changge’s best condition. Even if he continued to battle on with these injuries, it was nothing but a slow death, and there was no possibility of turning the tables.

Elder Lin’s prior anticipation vanished into thin air then. Clenching his fists secretly, he took a deep breath and announced, “Zhu Changge, come down.”

Zhu Changge’s face paled, but he did not dare to defy the orders of two elders and could only cast his sword aside in resignation, which symbolized that he admitted defeat.

Zhu Changge was supported down the ring by a few disciples. His hands were pressed on the wound on his waist, where blood continuously seeped out through the gaps between his fingers. However, he had a upset and vexed expression as he blamed himself for not being more careful.

At that time, it was as though a giant rock collapsed on the hearts of everyone from Xuanling Sect, and the thin string of hope that just arose completely vanished along with Zhu Changge’s defeat.

“It’s over… Senior Brother Zhu lost. I’m afraid we are…” Despair was written on all the disciples’ faces.

Zhu Changge was the most skilled disciple out of everyone who came. Now that even he was defeated, there was no longer a possibility for Xuanling Sect to attain the first place.

It was not only that though. Although Feng Yiran from Wind Moon Sect was also defeated, his injuries were not severe, and he could participate in the competition for second place the next day. However, Zhu Changge…

Looking at the streaks of blood under Zhu Changge, everyone was extremely gloomy.

With Zhu Changge’s severe injuries, he would probably not have a chance to contend for the second place tomorrow.

The Qinglin Sect elders broke into an arrogant smile once again after witnessing the sight.

“Elder Mo, thank you for the good fight,” a Qinglin Sect elder said smilingly to the pale Elder Mo without concealing his conceit.

“Elder Qian, aren’t your Fu Lingtian’s attacks too harsh?” Elder Lin spoke ahead of Elder Mo with a dark expression.

He took a look at Zhu Changge’s injuries. If not for the fact that Zhu Changge’s body condition was tough enough, he would have almost lost his life under Fu Lingtian’s attacks.

The Three Sect Competition had always rules that had competitors refrain from overdoing, yet Fu Lingtian’s attacks were too cruel.

Qinglin Sect elder replied disapprovingly. “The ring is dangerous. Even if there are casualties, it is normal.”

Elder Lin’s face darkened. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Similarly, Elder Mo’s expression was not too good.

Zhu Changge was already their biggest chip in this competition. Now that he was tragically defeated, who else could go up?
