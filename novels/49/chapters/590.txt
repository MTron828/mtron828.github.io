Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After they heard their Young Miss, the expressions of the Ouyang clan men were even stranger.

Young Miss Ouyang Qian told them that she fancied that pretty boy’s Illusion Stone; however, that pretty boy did not know what was good for him.

“That’s strange. Young Miss clearly said that she would take that pretty boy’s life. Why is it that so suddenly… Could it be that Young Miss really fell for that pretty boy?”

The men from the Ouyang clan were in thought.

“Why are you all still in a daze!” “Ouyang Qian” shouted at them loudly.

One of them immediately cupped his fists at “Ouyang Qian” and replied. “Yes!”

Afterward, all of them immediately stopped Lin Cong.

The scene was a mess in the subsequent hour. Ultimately, Lin Cong was beaten up to a pulp by the combined forces of the Ouyang clan men and was flung out.

All of the Ouyang clan people were already at Martial Qi Level Three, and although Lin Cong was not weak, it was difficult to fight against four people by himself, and it was already pretty good that he did not die.

Although Feng Cong wanted to dissuade them, the Ouyang clan was too powerful, and it was inconvenient for him to cut in.

Lin Cong was heavily injured, and this small team could only abandon him. After making arrangements for a while, the team continued on their journey.

The pressing matter at the moment was to find a sect team. Otherwise, it would be hard to last until the end of the Hell of Avicinaraka just by themselves.

This departure lasted another two days.

Two days later, everyone arrived at a dessert.

“Look!” Feng Cong pointed forward with an astonished expression.

After hearing him, everyone looked in the direction that Feng Cong pointed at.

There was a majestic palace miles away which radiated a faint golden ray.

“That palace is…” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Everyone exchanged a look but could not form a conclusion.

“Let’s take a look,” the Blood Moon Elder said eventually.

A magnificent palace appeared in the desert. If it was not a place with a huge destiny, then it would be a land of death. There were as many destinies as dangers. Given the Blood Moon Elder’s personality, he would naturally want to find out what it was.

“Holy… Darling Ye, what do you think…” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang with a feigned “gentleness” and eyes full of gentle tenderness.

“Can… you not call me that…” When Ye Qingtang saw “Ouyang Qian”‘s gentle eyes, a chill ran down her spine, and disgust rose within her.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder: …

At that instant, the Blood Moon Elder broke down a little internally. It was clearly Holy Lady who warned him repeatedly that night to coordinate with her. He had already thrown his own face away, yet why did Holy Lady despise him now?

Was the gentleness that he mastered after a Herculean effort disregarded by his Holy Lady just like that?

“Darling Ye…” The Blood Moon Elder leaned against Ye Qingtang with a face full of smiles.

“If you… call me this again… I may… not be able to hold myself back from beating you to death.” Ye Qingtang glared at the “flirty” Blood Moon Elder with a serious expression.

Although Ouyang Qian’s external appearance was extremely beautiful, the spirit inside was an old man…

Ye Qingtang really could not bear an old man calling her Darling Ye so bashfully!

“What did you say?!” A certain Ouyang male stepped forward immediately and looked at Ye Qingtang. “You should be extremely honored that my Young Miss called you that!”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the male.

If this Ouyang male likes this honor, he can receive it then…

“What has this got to do with you! Get lost!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted coldly.
