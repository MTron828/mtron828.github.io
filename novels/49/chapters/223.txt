Chapter 222: Blood Plague (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang felt something suspicious as the blood plague did not occur in her previous life. She did not care about the rest, but Lin Long was also infected…

“Apothecary, do you have any ways to control the blood plague?” Zhou Xuan showed an unpleasant expression.

“The blood plague is not fatal yet. I don’t know the way to cure it completely, but I will provide some herbal soup to delay its spread in the body.” The Apothecary was not very confident.

It would not be so terrifying if a plague could be cured so easily.

“The blood plague spreads very fast. We should dispose of the corpses of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village as soon as possible to prevent others from getting infected.” The Apothecary suggested.

Zhou Xuan frowned slightly. He did not give an immediate reply. He scanned through the faces of the rest, but another thought emerged in his brain.

This mission was assigned by the sect. They would be punished if they could not accomplish it. Furthermore, they bribed the warden in order to assign Ye Qingtang to this task. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

If they did not accomplish the mission and got exposed for the bribe, Zhou Xuan would definitely be punished heavily as the leader.

Additionally… if they returned to the sect now, he would lose the chance to eliminate Ye Qingtang. It was easy to explain the situation to his brother, but for Ning Luo…

Zhou Xuan squinted his eyes and took a breath secretly.

“We have not found out the murderer of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village yet. If we dispose of the corpses now, we would lose a lot of clues. Since Spirit Condensation Mountain Village is under our sect, we will definitely continue the investigation. You only need to block the entire Mountain Village and spread the powder that can deter the plague at the borders. Warn the rest not to approach the area, and we will handle the rest.” Zhou Xuan looked at the Apothecary and ordered.

The Apothecary was stunned as he did not expect that Zhou Xuan was still not willing to dispose of the corpses. The blood plague might spread to innocent people anytime if they left the corpses there.

“Sir, do we need to inform the sect that the blood plague is spreading…”

Zhou Xuan waved his hand to reject his suggestion. “We are the sect disciples, and we are proud of our sect. Since Spirit Condensation Mountain Village is under us and three hundred people died in misery, we will not stop due to a little obstacle.”

Zhou Xuan was full of justice. Though the Apothecary was still worried, he did not try to convince him again.

“Sir, you are such a righteous disciple of the Xuanling Sect. I really admire you, and we will never forget your kindness.”

Ye Qingtang sneered as she observed how Zhou Xuan’s expressions changed.

When did Zhou Xuan’s temper change?

He decided to stay for investigation when he knew that he might get infected by the blood plague anytime?!

She did not recall that Zhou Xuan was such a righteous person.

Zhou Xuan turned his head when Ye Qingtang was staring at him.

“Junior Sister Ye, we need to control the spread of the blood plague in Junior Brother Liu and rest, but we need to accomplish the sect mission as well. Thus… you will be in charge of the investigation now. I will take care of the rest,” Zhou Xuan said and smiled.

He showed a sense of justice, but his words shocked Lin Long.

Zhou Xuan still asked Ye Qingtang to investigate when there was the blood plague in the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village?

What was he up to?
