Chapter 2207: Heaven Fire Elixir (3)

“Impossible. How did that Teacher Ye get his hands on a Heaven Fire Elixir.” Qin Xuan frowned suspiciously. But his eyes gleamed when he turned to see the elixir which Qin Feng had already poured onto his palm.

That pill was a transparent dark red on the outside with a pitch-black inner core.

Qin Xuan was completely stunned by that one look.

It was really the Heaven Fire Elixir!

What kind of joke was this!

Qin Xuan had personally seen a Heaven Fire Elixir. He knew how rare it was and only a Grand Master alchemist could refine this. And the recipe for this had already been lost.

He thought that the new Teacher Ye had just randomly coughed up some elixir for Qin Feng. He never dreamed that he would give Qin Feng the Heaven Fire Elixir, something which Qin Xuan himself had long desired!

A harsh glint flashed across Qin Xuan’s eyes. He reached out to snatch the Heaven Fire Elixir from Qin Feng.

Qin Feng was still in shock and didn’t realize that Qin Xuan had made a move. Lei Yan and the rest didn’t know what this elixir was but noticed Qin Xuan’s movement.

However, their powers were far inferior to Qin Xuan’s. They were unable to stop him.

Just as Qin Xuan was about to reach that Heaven Fire Elixir, a small figure scurried up Qin Feng’s hand!

By the time Qin Feng snapped out of his trance, he saw that his elixir had disappeared while Qin Xuan was already right in front of him. Beside him, Qin Xuan was stunned on seeing that someone else had snatched the Heaven Fire Elixir in front of his eyes.

He then noticed a lifelike puppet had appeared out of nowhere and was now standing on a tree branch. The puppet was holding that Heaven Fire Elixir.

Wasn’t that the same puppet which Mu Ziying was hugging just now? Did she manage to control that puppet to cut in front of him?

“Qin Xuan, what are you trying to do?” Nangong Lie reprimanded after regaining his composure. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Damn, he was openly trying to rob Qin Feng!

Luckily Little Senior Sister reacted fast enough!

Qin Xuan narrowed his eyes.

“Hand over the Heaven Fire Elixir.”

He did not care about anything else. But this Heaven Fire Elixir was very important to him.

Heaven Fire Elixir?

Qin Feng had only suspected it while the rest had no idea what that elixir was.

But everyone was dumbstruck after Qin Xuan spoke.

“Damn, that’s the Heaven Fire Elixir?!!” Lei Yan’s jaw nearly crashed to the floor.

That was a true-blue Grand Master-level elixir!

And not every Grand Master alchemist could refine it!

Boss was so awesome!

He could refine something so otherworldly?

The teenagers were all shocked, but they also realized just how dire the current situation was. Qin Xuan clearly wanted to snatch that elixir for himself.

“Qin Xuan, this elixir belongs to Qin Feng. What’s it got to do with you?” Nangong Lie sneered.

Qin Xuan narrowed his eyes before smiling. “Qin Feng is useless now. It is a waste for him to have the Heaven Fire Elixir. He is not worthy of such a precious elixir.”

“What a joke. Our Boss refined this pill, so he can give it to whoever he wants. This doesn’t belong to your Qin family. Who the hell do you think you are!” Lei Yan felt rather confident by the fact that they had more people on their side.

Qin Xuan’s face darkened.

Lei Yan was quietly startled.

Qin Xuan shot his two companions a look. In the very next moment, the three of them attacked in unison.

“So you’re really going to attack us for it!” Lei Yan wailed.
