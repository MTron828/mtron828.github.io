Chapter 1184: Attack (2)

“Miss Ye, do you have any problems?” Seeing that no one had any opinions, Gu Yu nodded in satisfaction and looked toward Ye Qingtang.

“No.” Ye Qingtang replied.

Gu Yu was slightly shocked to hear Ye Qingtang; he originally thought that Ye Qingtang would not be willing to head to Dragon Elephant City, and he would have to spend time to persuade her or even use his identity as the overall general in the end.

Nonetheless, what Gu Yu did not expect was that Ye Qingtang agreed so straightforwardly.

“Good. Miss Ye is indeed extraordinary. This mission is extremely tough. Miss Ye needs to disguise herself as a troop to attack Dragon Elephant City, and the Ancient You Clan masses encircling Heaven City will definitely return… By then, Miss Ye just needs to retreat, and the mission will be completed,” Gu Yu said with a smile.

Saying it was more than easy, but who could retreat safely when being surrounded by the Ancient You Clan powerful figures… Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“I will do my best,” Ye Qingtang looked at Gu Yu and said.

“Miss Ye can select any one hundred soldiers from Heaven City as long as they are not Yang Lords.” Gu Yu added on.

“There’s no need. I am fine alone.” Ye Qingtang refused.

Ye Qingtang’s refusal to bring anyone else aligned with Gu Yu’s intention. “Alright. You can make some preparations and set off tonight then.”

After the meeting ended, Ye Qingtang turned and left the hall.

Late at night, Ye Qingtang left Heaven City and turned into a bolt of light, darting towards Dragon Elephant City.

When she was five kilometers away from Dragon Elephant City, she stopped.

“Come out,” Ye Qingtang said softly.

In the next second, the masses who were supposed to be in Falling Sky Valley, however, walked out from the dark, with the Blood Moon Elder’s enormous body being the most eye-catching.

The root problem of Heaven City was the insufficient number of powerful figures. As such, Ye Qingtang had already notified the people in Falling Sky Valley to head to Heaven City to defend it.

However, Gu Yu made Ye Qingtang pretend to attack Dragon Elephant City today, and as such, she might as well lead the Falling Sky Valley army to completely conquer Dragon Elephant City.

“Mo… ther…”

Little Luo Xue ran out from the crowd and hugged Ye Qingtang’s calf immediately.

Ye Qingtang grinned and hugged Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun in her arms.

Falling Sky Valley was no longer safe. The Ancient You Clan wanted to obtain the full power of the Spiritual Abode and thus had to obtain Little You Yun first. Hence, Ye Qingtang would not let them remain in Falling Sky Valley, and staying by her side was the safest way.

“Eldest Young Lady, we received your letter today and did not head to Heaven City but waited here instead as per your orders.” Daoist Zijin walked forward and told Ye Qingtang.

“Good.” With a brief nod, Ye Qingtang said, “Let’s attack and capture Dragon Elephant City together!”

“Yes!”

Everyone nodded successively and shouted.

The group of powerful figures traveled in the air and flew towards Dragon Elephant City.

In no time, Ye Qingtang and the rest arrived in Dragon Elephant City.

Many powerful figures in Dragon Elephant City were sent to besiege Heaven City, and there were not many powerful figures in Dragon Elephant City currently. Thus, capturing the city did not require great effort for Ye Qingtang.

“Kill!”

At this instant, Elder Bai Kui shouted furiously and took the lead to charge into Dragon Elephant City.

Dozens of Yang Lords, including Blood Moon Elder’s combat abilities, made them an immensely powerful army!
