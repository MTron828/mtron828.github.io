Chapter 775 Giving You Face (1)

“This year is different from the previous years.” The Peerless School disciple smiled and lifted his chin. “Have you forgotten, Perfected Xuanchen? Your old Valley Master did not give us any tributes last year.”

“Since one year of tributes is missing, you all naturally have to make up for it this year,” the Peerless School disciple said and threw that list on a Falling Sky Valley elder’s face.

“Perfected Xuanchen, you’re still using this list to fool us. What a joke.”

Perfected Xuanchen’s expression darkened, and even the Peak Masters behind him never thought that the Peerless School would have such high demands.

The tributes that they squeezed out to offer to the Peerless School every year were already their limit. It was so that they even had to dock the welfare of their own valley’s disciples in order to fill the vacancy.

Yet, the Peerless School still wanted them to double the number of tributes now?!

“This… I’m afraid… there are some difficulties. We have always prepared according to the original rules,” an elder said hesitantly.

The Peerless School snickered coldly.

“The tributes that we set for Falling Sky Valley back then were already very little, but your old Valley Master did not know how to be grateful. Could it be that… you all don’t know what gratitude is?” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

There was a hint of a threat in the Peerless School disciple’s words.

The Falling Sky Valley elders and Peak Masters had ugly expressions. Perfected Xuanchen frowned slightly. After hesitating for a moment, he finally said, “It is our negligence. Please rest in the valley for a while, envoys. We will prepare them now.”

“Sure. We will just take a spin in the valley.” Then, the Peerless School disciple lifted his hand and pointed at Xuanyuan Lie. “Let him bring us around.”

Delight arose in Xuanyuan Lie upon being appointed by the Peerless School disciple.

Perfected Xuanchen, the elders, and the Peak Masters could only return to the hall to discuss how to gather the additional tributes.

The scene fell into the eyes of the Falling Sky Valley disciples, who felt sorrowful.

The Peerless School was so mighty that even their Valley Master and Peak Masters could only concede to them.

“This way please.” Xuanyuan Lie was all smiles, completely unlike his usual arrogance.

Ye Qingtang and Yin Qingluo were walking to Falling Sky Valley’s square and suddenly saw Xuanyuan Lie and two young men walking towards them. Furthermore, Xuanyuan Lie had a polite and solicitous expression on his face.

“Who are those two people?” Ye Qingtang said.

There were not many who could make the conceited Xuanyuan Lie be so polite.

Yin Qingluo looked over and was alarmed. She immediately spoke with a hushed voice. “Junior Brother Ye, those two are envoys from the Peerless School.”

However, the moment Yin Qingluo spoke, the emotionless Peerless School disciples beside Xuanyuan Lie suddenly looked at them.

Yin Qingluo spoke extremely softly to Ye Qingtang earlier on, but the skills of these two Peerless School disciples were pretty good, and that slight sound traveled into their ears word for word.

Their expressions darkened immediately.

Xuanyuan Lie sensed the gaze of the two people and immediately followed their gaze, which caused Xuanyuan Lie to snicker in his heart.

He had not taken time to find trouble for Ye Qingtang, but she sent herself knocking on the door instead today.

Then, Xuanyuan Lie immediately put on a straight face and reproached coldly. “How brazen! Who allowed you two to criticize the Peerless School?”
