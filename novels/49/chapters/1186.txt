Chapter 1187: Look At The Big Picture (2)

After a moment of silence, Ye Qingtang suddenly snickered from her host seat. “I’m afraid you have misunderstood some things.”

“Oh… misunderstood some things? What do you mean by that, Miss Ye?!” The young powerful figure asked with a frown.

“Firstly, the Ancient You Clan is this mainland’s enemy. Being able to conquer their main city is my capability and my freedom. Secondly, I don’t belong to any camp and only wish to protect the ordinary cultivators of this mainland. When I headed to Heaven City to provide support, I was there as an ally not as your subordinate,” replied Ye Qingtang.

“What did you say?!” The young powerful figure was instantly enraged. “Ye Qingtang, I don’t care what you plan to do. Return Dragon Elephant City to the Ancient You Clan immediately! Otherwise, can you bear the responsibility of Heaven City being conquered!”

Ye Qingtang shook her head as she sized up the young man before her. “People like you are really the product of this mainland’s dark era.”

“You…!”

The young powerful figure glared at her furiously, and his martial aura surged into the sky.

However, before he could take any action, Elder Bai Kui, Daoist Zijin, and the other Yang Lords entered the hall and eyed that young powerful figure coldly.

“This…”

The young powerful figure was startled and extremely shocked to see many Yang Lords in the hall suddenly. How was there still such a force in the South battlefield?!

Could it be that Ye Qingtang could conquer Dragon Elephant City because of this force…

“Young man, I will spare your life today on the account that you are also a citizen of this mainland.”

“Hahaha, Valley Master Xuanchen, if the Ancient You Clan is willing to recruit a lackey, this kind of person will definitely be the first to wag his tail at and surrender to them. Why not just kill him?”

“Forget it… The great war has already begun. Even if they die, it’s better to die on the battlefield,” Daoist Zijin said.

At this instant, the young powerful figure remained rooted to the ground rather stiffly and even did not dare to breathe loudly. There were many Yang Lords in the hall, and it would only take a second for them to take his life…

“Scram off to where you came from!” Ye Qingtang shouted sometime later with an icy gaze.

“Get lost!” Valley Master Xuanchen said with a frown when he saw that the young powerful figure did not move.

“Fare… Farewell…”

The young powerful figure gritted his teeth and left.

Once he was out of Dragon Elephant City, Elder Bai Kui looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “This kind of people truly deserve to die. We conquered the Ancient You Clan’s main city, but he still wanted us to return it to the Ancient You Clan. What does he view us as?!”

Since when was there a logic where one had to return the enemy’s home ground back to the enemy during a war?

Gu Yu and the rest merely wished to protect themselves and did not consider the situation of the entire war; they actually wanted Ye Qingtang to give up on the won victory in order to ensure their personal safety. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

How could such a selfish person become a general?!

“Humph! I really don’t know what to say!” Valley Master Xuanchen said coldly.

“We should have killed him just now. He is a scourge even if we spare him.” A Peak Master of Falling Sky Valley commented.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “What Elder Zijin said just now is right. Even if they die, they should die on the battlefield.”
