Chapter 2421: Who Said I Was A Good Person (2)

Even if he didn’t wish to believe it, the teleportation talisman had been crushed right before his eyes. Yet they were still inside the Wailing Well.

This proved everything.

“Teacher Ye, I think that we should let them go now?” Lu Yuanxiang questioned tentatively.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

The Wailing Well situation was extremely urgent and dangerous. This was not the time to fight with each other. And Ye Qingtang was not that petty.

Let alone the group was already so badly beaten up. They had been taught a good lesson.

The Flying Star Academy team was released but their faces remained ashen. The teenagers looked at their own teacher with a deep sense of unease.

Now that they didn’t have a teleportation talisman, how would they leave this dangerous place if there were really above-Emperor level monsters?

“I… I am sorry. I never imagined… that this could be true…” The Flying Star Academy teacher looked at Lu Yuanxiang and Ye Qingtang. They had kindly tried to inform him but all he could think about was snatching their demon crystals.

Lu Yuanxiang shook his head. With so many things weighing upon his mind now, he was in no mood to kick up a fuss with these people.

The Flying Star Academy teacher looked distressed. He wanted to say something else but suddenly noticed…

Ye Qing was pouring the demon crystals from his space ring into his own.

The Flying Star Academy teacher, “…”

Hold on!

What was going on?

“Teacher, didn’t you say that you guys didn’t…”

Ye Qingtang glanced at him. “I didn’t take the Maple Night Academy team’s crystals, but that doesn’t mean I won’t take yours.”

Since they had delivered themselves to her doorstep, there was nothing wrong in taking their crystals. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The Flying Star Academy teacher’s eyes widened. The humble gratitude in his eyes instantly morphed into more complicated feelings.

This…

What was wrong with this person!

Didn’t they say there were above-Emperor level monsters?

At a time like this, shouldn’t they be worrying about their own safety? But they were taking advantage of the situation!

Even so, the Flying Star Academy teacher didn’t know how to voice out his objections.

After all, they were indeed the ones who had attacked Ye Qing’s team intending to rob them of their demon crystals. Now that they were defeated, it was only logical for him to take their crystals.

But…

Why did it still feel so strange!

Likewise, Lu Yuanxiang also felt rather befuddled when he saw Ye Qing take their demon crystals. Hadn’t Ye Qing said he had no need for them when he volunteered their crystals earlier?

After collecting all the demon crystals, Ye Qingtang tossed the space ring back to the teacher. The Flying Star Academy teacher looked at his space ring which now only contained a tripod. He looked distressed and felt very conflicted.

“Let’s go,” Ye Qingtang said.

Lu Yuanxiang and the rest followed Ye Qingtang.

The Flying Star Academy teacher looked at Ye Qing’s departing profile. He opened his mouth several times but didn’t know what to say. To be honest, Ye Qing’s team was indeed stronger than them. And they had discovered the Wailing Well anomaly before them.

Also, they were able to survive even after knowing about the above-Emperor level monsters. Perhaps they had some special abilities?

“Teacher, what should we do?” The Flying Star Academy teacher student looked ill at ease.

Wouldn’t they all be dead meat if they really encountered an above-Emperor level monster?

“Let’s follow them.” The Flying Star Academy teacher gritted his teeth. The young teacher was clearly the leader of the Netherworld Academy group and he was more familiar with the Wailing Well situation. Now, it was the best choice for them to follow the Netherworld Academy.

At the very least, they would be a little safer.

“Are we not going to look for the other teams?” One of the teenagers asked.

The teacher shook his head.

“When have we met any other teams other than today? The Wailing Well is too large. I cannot risk your lives.”
