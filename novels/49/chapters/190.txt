“Senior Brother Ning also knows Ye Qingtang?” Zhou Qu’s eyes brightened when he heard the words “Senior Brother Ning.”

This Senior Brother Ning, Ning Luo, was a renowned disciple in the inner sect and doted on by the elder of the inner sect’s Sword Faction. Even in the entire Xuanling Sect, he was a person of rank.

He did not expect that Ye Qingtang even offended Ning Luo as well. Zhou Qu really wanted to laugh now.

“You don’t need to ask about other matters.” Zhou Xuan did not intend to tell Zhou Qu too many things.

Zhou Qu did not dare to ask further. While they were brothers, he was actually fearful of Zhou Xuan deep down.

Zhou Xuan left after understanding the situation and planned on how to fulfill Ning Luo’s orders and seek revenge for Zhou Qu.

He was an old disciple in Xuanling Sect already and was aware that stirring up troubles the way Zhou Qu had been doing was a foolish method. Even though Zhou Qu was beaten up by Ye Qingtang, the incident was started by him, and Ye Qingtang would not be punished.

The only way to deal with Ye Qingtang was to be outside the sect!

Zhou Xuan narrowed his eyes and immediately headed to find the outer sect warden.

On the other side, Ye Qingtang massaged the silver wolf from head to toe and left the room happily under the wolf’s stare after cheerfully preparing a large amount of food.

With few hundreds of Xuanming points on hand, she would be a fool if she did not use them.

The key was that Ye Qingtang knew how to make full use of the Xuanming points.

A few disciples in the same batch as Ye Qingtang were still familiarizing themselves with the outer sect. After half a month, they were all more or less familiar with things around here. Most of them had heard that Ye Qingtang was out on a mission and had mixed emotions upon seeing Ye Qingtang back in the sect again.

“Ye Qingtang is back already? Do you think she completed the mission?” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Who knows? But I heard that she rode on the coattails of a few outer sect senior brothers to participate in the mission. Even if it was completed, she was also a freeloader. What can she not do when she is born with a good-looking face? Does she still need to put in any effort herself? Wouldn’t things be settled if she just used her face to butter up to the senior brothers?”

“What’s the use of being pretty? Do you think they are fools? If she did not help out, who would give her Xuanming points?”

“That’s logical. However, wasn’t Ye Qingtang always like this? She kept cozying up to Yun Shu previously and seduced other outer sect senior brothers now. It’s disgusting to even look at it. Does she think she would succeed in the outer sect by relying on these relations?”

“Don’t care about her! Anyways, we have all been training hard in these few weeks. Even if she gets those random deals, she will have it good when she has to use her real skills. In another half a month’s time, we will have entered the sect for a month already and would need to accept the appointed missions by the sect. Let’s see what she is going to do then.”

A few new disciples were gathered to discuss some things. It was not that they had a deep enmity towards Ye Qingtang but rather because Ye Qingtang was the first to participate in a rewarded mission in their batch. Given her unique case, it was undoubted that it would attract gossips.

Some people were always like that. When others did something that they were unable to do, they would always be full of slander and never reflected on themselves.

Little did they know that the defamed Ye Qingtang from their mouths was headed towards the largest trading place, the Dragon Court.

The Dragon Court was an area drawn out by the outer sect and specially provided to outer sect disciples to make deals. Any disciple could sell valuable items here, and if there was anything that one needed, he or she would only need to exchange the item using the corresponding amount of Xuanming points.

Here, the most popular items were parts of demonic beasts that the disciples conveniently picked up when on missions. Other than that, there were also some elixirs made by the Herbal Faction’s disciples.
