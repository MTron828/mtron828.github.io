Chapter 2555: Dragon Emperor Clan (15)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

To put it bluntly, Ye Qingtang did not know why either. She could not possibly have been brought back to the Dragon Emperor Clan just because she looked similar to Di Jiuyuan. After all, there were many people with similar appearances in this world. Furthermore, didn’t the mountain guard say that Di Jiuyuan’s children had already returned to the Dragon Emperor Clan? It could not be that the elder treated her as one of her children, right?

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was silent, the Blood Moon Elder said, “Holy Lady… could I have really guessed correctly… if that’s the case, we will be very powerful!”

“You’re thinking too much.” Ye Qingtang frowned.

It was precisely because of this that Ye Qingtang had an ominous feeling about the true reason the elder brought her back to the Dragon Emperor Clan. That was why she did not want to stay in the Dragon Emperor Clan. If it were not for the current circumstances, she would really turn around and leave.

“Actually, I’m not too sure either,” Ye Qingtang said after a while.

The Blood Moon Elder put down his chopsticks and fell into deep thought with Ye Qingtang.

“Holy Lady, could it be that the Dragon Emperor Ancient Clan has taken a fancy to some treasures on you…” The Blood Moon Elder frowned deeply.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. The Dragon Emperor Clan was such a powerful clan. Why would they want any of her treasures? Besides, her treasures were all in her space ring. It was highly unlikely.

“Probably not. Even if they wanted something from us, they could just kill us and take our items. There’s no need to bring us back here. It’s unnecessary,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Dragon Emperor Clan was not a righteous clan. They would not go out of their way to carry out such superfluous actions. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“I got it!”

The Blood Moon Elder slapped the table and stood up suddenly. He stared at Ye Qingtang. “Holy Lady, didn’t the Sky Vault Sect want to bring you away earlier… I think that the Dragon Emperor Clan and the Sky Vault Sect are not on good terms. Therefore, they purposely went against the Sky Vault Sect by snatching you away from their hands. Holy Lady, do you think I’m right?”

Actually, Ye Qingtang had considered this before but quickly vetoed the idea.

If it was really because of the Sky Vault Sect, the Dragon Emperor Clan could have snatched her away and then released her. What reason would they have to bring her and the Blood Moon Elder back to the Dragon Emperor Clan?

“Tell me, don’t you humans get tired? Why are you thinking so much? They brought you back as guests… to entertain you with good food and drinks, as well as give you those ridiculous elixirs. Enjoy yourselves. It is way too easy for those people to kill you. They definitely don’t have such intentions, so your worries are groundless,” the big yellow dog finally piped up.

Ye Qingtang could not help smiling at that explanation. She had to admit that the big yellow dog’s words did make sense.

If the Dragon Emperor Clan really harbored evil intentions toward them, they would have already died 10,000 times over. There was no point in thinking too much. They might as well just wait for the Dragon Emperor Clan to give them an answer.

“Holy Lady, I think what Brother Canine said makes sense. We have good food and drinks now as well as elixirs. It’s no loss to us even if we continue to stay here. Most importantly, that Sky Vault Sect will no longer seek trouble with us.” The Blood Moon Elder nodded.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything and just quietly opened her space ring.
