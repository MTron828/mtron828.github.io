“You really are Master Ao’s disciple? How is Master Ao recently?” Master Du asked.

“Everything is good.” Ye Qingtang fooled Master Du, but her face was still calm.

Master Du and Ye Qingtang were chatting with each other, but Chu Yi, who wanted to look down at Ye Qingtang, was now pale.

He stared at the broken sword in his hand and listened to the conversations between Ye Qingtang and Master Du. He could feel cold sweat running down his back when he heard that Ye Qingtang was Ao Yuan’s disciple.

If Master Du was the finest blacksmith in the Nine Nights Dynasty, Ao Yuan would be the god of forging on this mainland.

Chu Yi could never imagine that the mediocre young man would be Ao Yuan’s disciple!

“May I know what brings you here today?” Master Du looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled.

“I want you to help me to forge a sword, Senior,” Ye Qingtang said directly.

“What kind of sword?” Master Du was curious. As Ao Yuan’s disciple, he should not need others to help in forging.

“A sword made of the Millennium Meteoric Iron,” Ye Qingtang said.

When Ye Qingtang said that, gasps rang in the entire forging workshop instantly!

“Millennium Meteoric Iron?!”

“Did I hear it wrong? Millennium Meteoric Iron? This guy… has Millennium Meteoric Iron?”

Everyone felt that it was insane. Ye Qingtang’s identity as the Ao Yuan’s disciple had already shocked them previously, and the words “Millennium Meteoric Iron” really caused them to be mad.

Only a countable few on this mainland could use the Millennium Meteoric Iron to forge weapons. Nothing was as rare as Millennium Meteoric Iron on this land.

Even Master Du was shocked by the mentioning of Millennium Meteoric Iron.

“You have Millennium Meteoric Iron?” Master Du stared at Ye Qingtang in surprise.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

Master Du then understood the reason why the young man wanted to look for him. The method of forging using Millennium Meteoric Iron was extremely rigorous and complicated. Though the young man was Ao Yuan’s disciple, based on his age, he had yet acquired the method of forging using Millennium Meteoric Iron.

“I know how to forge using the Millennium Meteoric Iron. However… why do I need to help you with that?” Master Du looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

“Master Du, I think he’s bluffing.” Chu Yi sneered before Ye Qingtang could say anything.

Master Du took a glimpse at Chu Yi.

“Master Du, Master Ao has disappeared for years. Many people have also pretended to be his disciples as well. Why do we need to believe that he is Master Ao’s disciple just based on his words? It seems like I can also say that I’m Master Ao’s disciple.” Chu Yi shook his head and said.

Master Du was in thought after hearing Chu Yi’s words.

“Do you have any proof when you say you’re Master Ao’s disciple?” Master Du stared at Ye Qingtang and asked. Though she knew something about the Black Heaven Forging Skill, that could not be the solid evidence.

“There is no proof,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Hehe, without any proof, you can say anything you want. Do you know the reputation of Master Ao? If you were really his disciple, why would you come and look for Master Du to forge weapons?” Chu Yi laughed coldly.
