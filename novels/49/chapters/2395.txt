Meanwhile in the big hall, Wen Qi and the others bore very strange expressions as they watched. The teams from the various academies had already advanced further into the Wailing Well and were engaged in intense battles.

But there was a single screen that stood out from the rest.

“Vice-President, what is Ye Qing’s team doing?” Luo Sheng looked at the screen showing Ye Qing and his team. What was shown made his face twitch.

The other teams had all started exploring the Wailing Well and some teams had already encountered demons and were hunting with ferocity. Some teams encountered other teams and ended up in a scuffle.

Meanwhile on Ye Qing’s side…

A bonfire was burning in that murky scene. One could see some vague shapes which look like chickens roasting above the fire.

Wen Qi was also befuddled. This was completely different from what he expected. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Earlier on, Wen Qi didn’t find it that astonishing that Ye Qing chose to refine elixirs first. He thought that the youth was just being prudent. But now…

They were eating?

Actually taking the time to sit and fill their bellies?

Teachers from the other academies also noticed this unique scene. Quite a number of people glanced over, their faces filled with ridicule.

The top Netherworld Academy students did not participate in the earlier martial arts competition and the other academies guessed that they might be hiding their true power to stake it all in the team competition.

But…

“Wen Qi, your students, they really… know how to enjoy themselves.” A teacher from another academy chuckled.

This competition would directly affect the reputation of the academy. And to think that the Netherworld Academy team was in the mood to have a barbecue?

What a complete farce.

Even then Wen Qi maintained his impassive expression. He believed that Ye Qing would not mess around. But…

For a moment there, even Wen Qi had no idea what he was planning. Compared to how the other teams had already encountered demons and were fighting them, Ye Qing’s team was… gathered around a bonfire eating roasted meat…

Wen Qi’s heart was constricted.

And he was not the only one. Song Yanhan was also speechless.

The next morning, Song Yanhan believed that Ye Qing would finally make a move. But the latter seemed to have no intention of hunting for demons. Instead, Ye Qing only led Lei Yan and the others to gather another round of herbs to refine elixirs. It was only after that they finally ventured deeper inside the Wailing Well.

“Boss, look,” Qin Feng called out in a low voice. He seemed to have discovered something.

The others followed his line of sight.

A massive cave was hidden in a nearby forest. Several lion-shaped demons were pacing near the outside of the cave.

These lion-shaped demons were huge. Even the smallest of them was at least three meters tall. This was the first time that Lei Yan and the others had met a demon after entering the Wailing Well.

They immediately went on high alert.

Narrowing her eyes at the lion-shaped demons, Ye Qingtang instructed in a low voice, “Little Ying-er, try and use your puppet.”

Moments later, Ye Qingtang retrieved a human-shaped puppet from her space ring and handed it to Mu Ziying.

The puppet was the size of an adult man. Placed in front of Mu Ziying, it made her look even smaller than usual.

Song Yanhan was startled by the sight of the puppet.

“Teacher Ye, I thought we are not allowed to bring special artifacts…”

Ye Qing replied, “This is Jing-er’s weapon.”

Song Yanhan was taken aback, only then did the thought of puppet masters appear in his mind.
