Chapter 941 Devouring Bloodline (4)

Ye Qingtang did not understand Ling Yan’s true intentions, but she instinctively chose to believe Ling Yan. She had a strange feeling that Ling Yan would never harm her.

Otherwise, although Ye Qingtang was no match for the girl in green, the girl in green could not prevent her from fleeing either.

The moment the original Divine Phoenix’s Bloodline was sucked out of her body, the Heavenly Demon Pearl that Ye Qingtang had swallowed exploded in an unimaginable burst of Heavenly Demon Aura.

A furious roar exploded within Ye Qingtang’s body. The power of the original Heavenly Demon gushed forth like a flood breaking its dam. It began to strip the power from the bloodline of the girl in green.

“Original Heavenly Demon Aura?!”

The girl in green’s pupils constricted, and her expression changed drastically.

Ye Qingtang had original Heavenly Demon Aura in her body?!

Furthermore, Ye Qingtang had not yet fully digested the original Heavenly Demon Aura. When she sensed the incursion by the Heavenly Demon Aura that had begun to devour her bloodline, the girl was enraged.

“You… who exactly are you… why do you have original Heavenly Demon Aura within you?!” The girl in green shouted coldly at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang had not moved at all. It was as if her body was beyond her control. Instead, it was being controlled by the power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl.

After a short while, the girl in green gritted her teeth and tried to move the hand that she had placed on Ye Qingtang’s shoulder.

However, the girl in green did not succeed. It was as if the hand that she had placed on Ye Qingtang’s shoulders had grown roots. It would not budge even an inch.

As the minutes and seconds ticked by, the girl in green’s face became ashen.

“You… you dare to devour my Devouring Bloodline!” The girl’s expression was cold and vicious. She could clearly sense Ye Qingtang devouring the Devouring Bloodline in her body bit by bit.

The reality was that Ye Qingtang did not want to devour the girl in green’s bloodline, but her body was being controlled by the power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl. All this was caused by the Heavenly Demon Pearl and was not Ye Qingtang’s intention.

Puff!

After fifteen minutes, the girl in green spat out fresh blood. She staggered as she stumbled backward.

“My Devouring Bloodline!”

The girl in green gritted her teeth as she glared at Ye Qingtang.

Her Devouring Bloodline had been seized by Ye Qingtang!

Although she usually devoured the bloodlines of others, the girl in green had not dreamt that today, her bloodline would be devoured instead!

The aura of the Heavenly Demon Pearl had dissipated. Ye Qingtang was now in control of her body again, and her expression was filled with shock.

Ye Qingtang clearly sensed that an extremely strong and potent bloodline had been added to her body. The power of this bloodline seemed to appear out of nowhere.

“It was the Heavenly Demon Pearl that devoured the girl in green’s Devouring Bloodline instead…” Ye Qingtang’s expression was rather strange.

The Heavenly Demon Pearl originated from the body of the original Heavenly Demon. It was the accumulation of a lifetime of essence of the original Heavenly Demon. The girl’s Devouring Bloodline was evolved from the Heavenly Demon’s Bloodline. Just now, when the girl in green used the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to devour the power of her bloodline, it had angered the Heavenly Demon Pearl… Instead, the Heavenly Demon Pearl had seized the Devouring Bloodline of the girl in green, and Ye Qingtang had reaped the benefits…

“That means… I now have the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline…” Ye Qingtang snapped out of her reverie after a long time. This bloodline could be said to be the most terrifying and powerful bloodline in the world. However, Ye Qingtang had now unaccountably seized the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline of the girl in green.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
