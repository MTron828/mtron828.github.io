Chapter 302: Demonic Blood Sword (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang still thought that the remaining five thousand Xuanming points was enough for her to splurge. Yet…

The price of a random sword she fancied was insanely high!

This Xuanming Pavilion was indeed not a place that normal disciples could afford to purchase things from!

Forty thousand Xuanming points was simply an unfathomable amount to outer sect disciples.

All the disciples were, similarly, astounded by this price.

Although the item was precious and could be considered to be of supreme-grade, this price was still…

“So expensive. How can outer sect disciples like us afford it? This is clearly prepared for inner sect disciples.” Some outer sect disciples could not help but lament sourly.

The cultivation conditions in the inner sect were originally better than the outer sect’s, and the inner sect disciples were more skilled and hence could take on rewarded missions that gave greater rewards. Although they knew that their abilities could not be compared to the inner sect disciples, they were bound to be bitter and envious when they saw good items which they had no chance of obtaining.

The warden glanced at the disciples and said without emotion, “It is not that there’s no chance at all. If you want to exchange some treasures in Xuanming Pavilion, using Xuanming points is not the only method.”

“What other methods are there?” The disciples were immediately on alert.

The warden smiled. “If you all can obtain first place in the inner sect assessment, you can choose any item priced below fifty thousand Xuanming points in the Xuanming Pavilion regardless of whether it is a weapon, spirit pet, or mystic technique scroll. As long as you have the abilities, there is a chance for you to obtain it directly.”

The warden’s words were like a pail of ice water that instantly extinguished the disciples’ newly-arose enthusiasm.

First in the inner sect entrance assessment?

Forget it!

They could not even enter the ranking charts, much less placing first in the inner sect assessment.

Just thinking of the skills of Ji Xianyuan who was currently ranked first in the ranking charts, everyone dropped the idea.

“Senior Brother Ji is at the peak of Connate Level 9 right now and is only a step away from the Martial Qi stage. There is almost no difference between him and the inner sect disciples. Who can defeat him?”

In everyone’s eyes, Ji Xianyuan was sure to place first in the inner sect entrance assessment, and there was no difference between having a chance to exchange for a good item in the Xuanming Pavilion or not.

As everyone sighed dejectedly, Ye Qingtang took these words to heart. Her eyes narrowed slightly and twinkled as she looked at the Demonic Blood Sword.

To enter the inner sect, she had to be the top three in the inner sect assessment, and if she wanted to obtain this Demonic Blood Sword without spending any Xuanming points, the only way was to place first.

The warden did not bother with those outer sect disciples at all and only promoted the Demonic Blood Sword to Ye Qingtang. Yet, he did not know that… Ye Qingtang only had five thousand Xuanming points currently.

“How is it? This Demonic Blood Sword is pretty good, isn’t it?” The warden laughed.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

Just as the warden thought Ye Qingtang would exchange for the Demonic Blood Sword, Ye Qingtang suddenly turned and left.

“…” The warden was a little dumbfounded.

What was going on?

She clearly liked it a lot, yet why did she leave just like that?

The warden was extremely confused, but Ye Qingtang’s decision to become stronger was increasingly resolute.

Regardless of entering the inner sect or obtaining that Demonic Blood Sword, Ye Qingtang was bent on achieving them. Rather than wasting time here, it was better to exchange for the usage rights of the Spirit Consonance River, as only that would truly increase her abilities.

“Peak of Connate Level 9…” Ye Qingtang frowned as she walked out of the Xuanming Pavilion. She was only at Connate Level 7 right now, and if she did not breakthrough to Connate Level 9 in the coming half a month, there would be simply no chance of winning!
