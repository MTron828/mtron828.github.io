Han Cangming?!

Ye Qingtang gazed upwards.

At this moment, two men were standing quietly in the sky. The one on the left had long silver-white hair and a red dot between his brows. There was no emotion in his eyes and he looked like an unparalleled demon god.

The person on the right had long, ink-black hair. The corners of his lips curled up slightly, and there was an indescribable smile on his face.

“The Heavenly Emperor...”

Ye Qingtang muttered as she looked at the silver-haired man.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang could not help recalling everything that happened in the First Mainland in the Blue Sky Domain. That was the first time she met the Blood Moon Holy Lord who descended from the void. It was from then on that the Blood Moon Holy Lord, who was a clone of the Heavenly Emperor, started following her...

Ye Qingtang never expected that she would meet the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s main body one day, and in this era. It was truly unbelievable. There were all sorts of strange things in the world.

As for the other person, he was no stranger to Ye Qingtang. The Demon God whom she once feared... Han Cangming.

Their faces had not changed at all. The Blood Moon Holy Lord... no, the Heavenly Emperor was still as cold as ever. It sent chills down one’s spine and one did not dare to look straight at him.

As for Demon God Han Cangming, Ye Qingtang was puzzled. Ye Qingtang felt that there was a huge difference in this Han Cangming. And the difference was not due to his figure or appearance...

In the past, every time she met the Demon God Han Cangming, he exuded an unapproachable aura. But now, this Han Cangming had a smile that Ye Qingtang found very familiar. She seemed to have seen this smile before... it did not feel unfamiliar at all but instead gave off a nostalgic and warm feeling.

Han Cangming’s smile should have looked out of place on his face. But seeing it now with her own eyes, Ye Qingtang found that she did not feel that way.

Staring at Han Cangming, Ling Yan’s voice and a smile appeared in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

“I must be going crazy...” Ye Qingtang frowned and muttered.

She actually overlapped the image of this Han Cangming, who had yet to become the Demon God, with Ling Yan. What else could she be but crazy?

“Sister Ye Yue... wow, look! The unrivaled Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming, who is about to become the Third Emperor!” The young Feng Jiuyou said to Ye Qingtang excitedly.

“I can see that.” Ye Qingtang, who was a little dazed, returned to her senses at that moment. She looked at the young Feng Jiuyou and smiled.

“Too awesome. I actually saw two supreme experts today... Sister Ye Yue, I must become as powerful as them and grow up to be a supreme expert too!” The young Feng Jiuyou was filled with excitement. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang smiled at the young Feng Jiuyou. “You will definitely become one. Perhaps one day in the future, you will be even stronger than them.”

“Eh?!” The young Feng Jiuyou was slightly taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words. He would be stronger than the unrivaled Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming?! How was that possible? Just to be on par with these two powerhouses... already seemed like an unrealistic dream.

It would be even more outrageous to hope to surpass the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming. The young Feng Jiuyou did not even dare to think about it..
