Chapter 2066: Complete Victory (1)

How could this be...

Ye Qingtang had already left. How could the sword even...

The Grand Elder spat blood and collapsed on the ground.

With that, the Ice Frost Divine Sword transformed, turning into Ning Luo’s human form and he snatched Little You Yun away. Wasting no time, he flew out of the place at the fastest speed possible.

The Grand Elder was powerful but he had already sustained some injuries and coupled with the sword’s attack, he couldn’t help but collapse on the ground. His eyes were filled with hatred.

The Holy Lord of Shadows... That was a good move.

He hadn’t expected the Holy Lord of Shadows to be this powerful. Even her sword had a consciousness of its own.

Nevertheless...

The Holy Lord of Shadows. The last one standing might now be you!

You would never be able to anticipate my last card!

Grand Elder, who had once been the one to control the entirety of the Central Mainland took his last breath before dying. His body was originally filled with powers from the Spiritual Abode. Within seconds, he lost the very last remnants of his energy and his corpse quickly turned into ash and vanished.

...

Ning Luo took Little You Yun with him and flew away to look for Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang realized that the Grand Elder didn’t lie. The Spirit of Chaos fragments were indeed hidden at the spot he named.

However, Ye Qingtang wasn’t in a rush to take them away.

She only relaxed when she saw Ning Luo bring Little You Yun back.

Ning Luo quietly observed Ye Qingtang. He already felt that this young lady was very different from others back in the First Mainland, but she had grown so much now. He wouldn’t have been capable of coming up with such an idea to save Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue.

Until...

Ye Qingtang left him behind at the altar and hinted for him to take action. It was only then that he realized she was a sly one. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ning Luo, leave this place with You Qiong and the children,” Ye Qingtang instructed.

“What about you, Holy Lord?” You Qiong asked worriedly.

“The Ancient You Clan and Crimson League are still fighting outside. How can I miss the fight?” Ye Qingtang smiled. Of course, she must join this battle.

Without uttering a word, You Qiong took Ning Luo and the unconscious children with him, leaving through the secret passage.

Ye Qingtang also flew out.

Outside the underground world, among the stretch of mountains. The Ancient You Clan, Crimson League and Temple of Shadows were engaged in a fierce battle. Corpses were laying everywhere.

The ground was almost completely red from the blood flowing everywhere.

Ye Qingtang could see Ming Di in a fierce battle from far away. His murderous self was completely unleashed.

The Ancient You Clan was no match for the Crimson League. They were at a disadvantage from the beginning.

One of the three elders had died in the battle. The entire Ancient You Clan was almost destroyed.

Ye Qingtang flew onto Ming Di’s back. Ming Di was about to breathe hot air at her, but when he turned around and saw that it was Ye Qingtang, he was stunned.

“Continue.” Ye Qingtang showed a gentle smile.

Ming Di regained his senses, charging towards the Ancient You Clan’s army.

The Ancient You Clan was already at a disadvantage and when they saw Ye Qingtang appear on Ming Di’s back, they were startled.

“Retreat! Don’t stay here! As long as we have the Spiritual Abode, we can always make a comeback!” an elder ordered once he noticed that things weren’t in their favor.

Elder Yuan was also prepared. He sent someone to the underground world to inform Little Luo Xue to look for the Grand Elder with Little You Yun.

They would not be defeated!
