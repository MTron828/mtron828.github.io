1555 Taiyuan Valley 2

Taiyuan Valley was very large, but only a few Jiang Family members lived there. Besides the Elders and the younger members of the Jiang Family, there was only a group of servants.

Ye Qingtang knew that if she wanted to enter the mystical abyss, she had to be one of the top ten in the Martial Arts Championship happening in half a year’s time. Therefore, she needed to achieve the highest level of cultivation within this half a year.

The Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had been in her body for a long time, but she was not able to completely control it. However, she could learn from the Jiang Family how to control the Heavenly Demon Bloodline. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang had been meditating and cultivating in her room for a while when Jiang Shaobai knocked on her room door. She said that she would bring Ye Qingtang around Taiyuan Valley and also get something to eat.

“Elder Sister Qing, your little white tiger looks very adorable. Is he your pet?” Jiang Shaobai asked curiously as she cocked her head on one side and looked at the little white tiger, who was in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

The little white tiger looked at her blandly. “...”

F*ck you. I’m a Fiendcelestial Beast. You’re the pet. Everyone in your entire family is a pet.

Just as the two of them walked into the main square of Taiyuan Valley, they noticed a group of youths wearing light blue shirts in the main square. Their clothes showed that they were members of the Jiang Family.

There seemed to be some sort of disturbance among them. Ye Qingtang did not intend to see what the matter was, but Jiang Shaobai forcibly towed her over.

Why was she weaker than a young girl?

Ye Qingtang was shocked by Jiang Shaobai’s strength.

“Where’s Jiang Lin?” A tall, coarse-looking youth among the group frowned and glanced around. He looked about eighteen or nineteen years old and was dressed completely in gray.

Behind him followed some others who wore similar clothes. They were clearly not from the Jiang Family and were arguing with the group of youths from the Jiang Family.

Before long, a handsome youth slowly emerged from the Jiang Family group. His features were clear-cut and handsome, and he moved with an elegant air. He wore a sword about his waist and was clearly the Jiang Lin that the large youth was looking for.

A look of surprise surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw Jiang Lin.

Ye Qingtang had seen Jiang Lin in her previous life. However, she saw him many years later, when she was being hunted by various forces. Jiang Lin had already left Taiyuan Valley then and was fully displaying his skills in Central Mainland.

If Jiang Qi was one of the geniuses of the Jiang Family’s younger generation, then Jiang Lin could only be described as demonically talented.

Jiang Lin was extremely powerful and had a zest for living. He was renowned for his Exorcism Swordplay, and many martial arts cultivators in Central Mainland acknowledged him to be one of the best swordsmen of his generation.

Ye Qingtang had not expected to meet the yet unknown Jiang Lin here.

“Cao Xu, are you looking for me?” Jiang Lin stood forth. His calm gaze passed over the large youth.

“So you have the guts to come forward. I can’t be bothered to bandy words with you. You injured our Cao Family’s disciples and mocked the Cao Family for having no talented members. Today, I have come to meet you and show you that my family is not lacking in talent.” Cao Xu clenched his fists so hard they cracked. His huge body showed no signs of the feebleness of youth.

He is from the Cao Family?

Ye Qingtang looked at Cao Xu.

The Cao Family was one of the most powerful families in Central Mainland. Many of the most powerful cultivators renowned throughout Central Mainland came from this family. When Ye Qingtang came to Central Mainland in her previous life, she heard there was discord between the Cao and Jiang Families, but she was not sure of the reasons behind it.

The Jiang Family had been renowned for ten thousand years as the Domain Monarch’s family. But as the supreme power in Central Mainland, it was frequently challenged by other powerful families.
