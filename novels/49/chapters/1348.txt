Chapter 1349 Constellations 3

“This is the world in the nine-star constellation?” Ye Qingtang raised her eyes and sized up the place.

However, the moment she finished her words, she could feel the intense and intoxicating spirit energy in her surroundings.

The spirit energy on the Central Mainland was more intense than the first domain. However, it was totally incomparable with the spirit energy here.

Ye Qingtang felt that she could absorb all the spirit energy into her body through simply breathing. After a few breaths, Ye Qingtang reached the First Heaven of the Arcane Supremacy!

Ye Qingtang was stuck at the tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord level for a very long time and did not find the right opportunity to level up.

However…

She entered the higher stage with just a few breaths?

Now, Ye Qingtang totally believed the radiant object’s words.

In such a place that was filled with intense spirit energy, it was not impossible to reach the Heavenly Venerate stage in four to five days.

Ye Qingtang was curious at the same time. If the spirit energy in the nine-star constellation was so intense, what kind of spirit energy was in the ten-star constellation?

Before Ye Qingtang could pull herself out of the joy and surprise, a long-tailed bird flapped its wings and flew across her from the forest.

It was supposed to be a very normal thing. However, as the bird flew past Ye Qingtang, she was thrown out by the wings!

An insurmountable force hit Ye Qingtang’s chest directly.

“Heavenly Venerate stage…” Ye Qingtang tried to stabilize herself as she stared unbelievably at the bird that flew past her.

She could sense it clearly just now that the aura from the bird’s wings was a Heavenly Venerate’s force!

Was this some kind of joke?!

Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded.

What kind of place was this? How was it possible that a normal bird possessed the power of a Heavenly Venerate?

Before Ye Qingtang could figure out what was going on, an ancient melody came from the sky. She looked upwards towards the origin of the sound but…

In midair, a few shadows could be seen vaguely among the dark clouds.

Though it was really far apart, Ye Qingtang could still sense the aura clearly…

The strength of the aura made Ye Qingtang’s brain buzz, and the ancient melody seemed to chop her heart and soul into pieces.

As the sound moved closer, noises arose from the forest.

A few wild animals rushed out of the woods suddenly. They seemed to be chased by the ancient melody and escaped in the opposite direction as they roared.

The direction they were trying to escape was exactly where Ye Qingtang was at.

Ye Qingtang tried to bear with the effect from the ancient melody. Her eyes were full of surprise from the animals running towards her.

All of them possessed the power of Heavenly Venerates! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“What the f*ck. What kind of place is this! How come all the normal animals are at the Heavenly Venerate stage?!!” The little white tiger was really shocked.

Ye Qingtang’s expression darkened immediately.

If she was knocked by any of the animals, she could be killed right away.

What kind of cultivation place was this! Any creature here could kill her instantly!
