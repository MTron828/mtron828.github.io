Chapter 825 Cross-Dress

“Ye Chen, I see you. If you don’t come out, don’t blame me for killing you.”

A while later, Xuanyuan Yi’s voice sounded above the river.

Ye Qingtang scoffed in the river. That Xuanyuan Yi really treated her as a three-year-old.

In the air, Xuanyuan Yi’s dagger-like eyes scanned across the surroundings.

Given Ye Qingtang’s speed, she must still be nearby and could not be too far away.

Moreover, only soil, mud, and water could screen one’s martial aura.

As such, Xuanyuan Yi could determine that Ye Qingtang must be hiding nearby.

It was, however, that there were numerous rivers and places with soil in the surrounding area. Without locking onto her aura, searching for Ye Qingtang was no different from looking for a needle in a haystack.

With a yell, Xuanyuan Yi swept the surroundings with his sword.

In a flash, the land nearby shattered, and rivers exploded with a frightening sound.

“Good. Ye Chen, since you’re not appearing, I want to see how long you can hide for.” Xuanyuan Yi’s lips tugged up slightly, and an icy smile appeared on his face.

Regardless of where Ye Qingtang was hiding in, she had to hold her breath, and even a Yin Yang Perfected Lord could not hold their breath for more than one day.

He was standing in the air right now, and as long as Ye Qingtang came out to breathe, she would definitely not escape his eyes.

Ye Qingtang naturally knew what Xuanyuan Yi was thinking of, but she was not in a hurry. Since Xuanyuan Yi wanted to play, she would just accompany him then.

Time passed extremely quickly. In the blink of an eye, numerous hours passed, and it was already deep into the night right now.

In the river, Ye Qingtang had already reached her limit and had to leave the river to breathe. Otherwise, the consequences would be disastrous.

Taking advantage of the dark, Ye Qingtang walked onto the shore quietly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

However, at this instant, a force swept across, and Ye Qingtang dodged away in time.

Boom!

The force caused the ground before Ye Qingtang to crack, and a wide deep pit appeared.

At the same time, Xuanyuan Yi snickered and descended from the sky immediately, and he grabbed Ye Qingtang’s left shoulder.

“Who’s there!”

Ye Qingtang shouted furiously and turned around.

After seeing Ye Qingtang’s appearance,

n Yi’s expression changed, and an odd look emerged on his face.

The person before him was actually a stunning girl who was wearing a white dress.

This was no man and clearly a lady.

“You…” Xuanyuan Yi frowned deeply. He originally thought that it was Ye Chen, but why was it suddenly a lady?!

The lady before him looked completely different from Ye Chen, and they were simply two different people.

Furthermore, with Xuanyuan Yi’s abilities, he could easily tell that it was not a disguise technique.

“Who are you? Why do you want to attack me?!” There was a trace of anger in Ye Qingtang’s bright eyes.

“Who are you and why are you here?” Xuanyuan Yi asked back.

“I am a family clan disciple. I head to this canyon to train and entered this river to wash my body as I was covered in days of dust. What is wrong with that? Instead, you’re pretty old already. Why are you here to peep?” Ye Qingtang said.

“Humph. Young one, don’t talk nonsense!” Xuanyuan Yi said coldly.

The moment he finished his sentence, he seemed to have thought of something and stared right at Ye Qingtang. “You said that you entered the river to wash your body, but why did you wash with clothes on?”

At this instant, Ye Qingtang’s clothes were still wet.
