Chapter 1234: Doubts (2)

However, Ming Wang remained expressionless as he looked at his younger brother’s agitated face.

“I know. Where is she?” Ming Wang said expressionlessly.

“Resting in her sleeping chambers. Elder Brother, I’m so happy that Ah Yao is really back, I…” Ming Gu was in a rush to share his joy with Ming Wang. But before he could finish speaking, Ming Wang swept a cold look at him. Ming Gu’s remaining words stuck in his throat.

“Ming Gu.” Ming Wang raised his head slightly and narrowed his black eyes, which swept across his younger brother’s face.

“You are too noisy.”

Ming Gu was stunned. When he saw the chill in Ming Wang’s eyes, he subconsciously shrank back.

The Undead had no twins.

But he and Ming Wang were a rare pair of twins and were also mutant Undead. They were born with immense abilities, but compared to Ming Wang, he was much weaker.

Ming Gu held a bone-deep reverence for his elder brother.

“How do you know that she is Ah Yao?” Ming Wang asked coldly.

Ming Gu was slightly taken aback. “Ah Yao is Ah Yao… of course I know…”

“Idiot.” Ming Wang grunted coldly.

“Since the Holy Lord is back, we should follow the rules of the Temple of Shadows.” Ming Wang did not look at his younger brother again. He turned to a slender girl with an enchanting face, who was standing next to him.

“Guardian of Ghosts, go and make your preparations and invite the Holy Lord to the Hall of Gloom.”

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang was still discussing the matter of the Nine Souls Rings with the little white tiger. Not long after, someone knocked on the room door.

Ye Qingtang had no choice but to put aside her bewilderment and open the door.

The door opened to reveal a scantily clad and enchanting-looking girl lounging against the door. When she suddenly saw Ye Qingtang at the doorway, a look of surprise flashed across her green eyes. But the surprise instantly vanished, and she smiled charmingly at Ye Qingtang and spoke.

“Your subordinate, Lady Ghost, greets the Holy Lord. The Holy Lord’s return is a joyful event. Please Holy Lord, come to the Hall of Gloom.”

Hall of Gloom?

Ye Qingtang looked at Lady Ghost standing before her. An ominous foreboding rose in her heart, but she maintained her composure and nodded slightly.

With the little white tiger in tow, Ye Qingtang walked with Lady Ghost to the Hall of Gloom. Along the way, she thought about what she was soon to encounter.

The Hall of Gloom was where ceremonies were carried out in the Temple of Shadows and was hundreds of meters underground.

After a long walk, Ye Qingtang finally came to a broad space.

It was a grand hall, so large that its end could not be seen at a glance. When she raised her head, she could not even see the hall ceiling.

At first glance, it looked like a public square bathed in darkness.

A huge picture of a skeleton was carved in the center of the Hall of Gloom. Around it were circular pictures in which black, glittering gems were embedded. Only a green flame lit the Hall of Gloom. It was both dim and oppressive. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ming Gu and the other tribe leaders who were already in the Hall of Gloom looked at Ye Qingtang as she walked over slowly.

Their first glance shocked them.

The girl in front of them looked exactly like their long lost Holy Lord.

“Is this girl really the Holy Lord?” The leader of the Demon Tribe looked at Ye Qingtang and lowered his voice to whisper to the leader of the Goblin Tribe, who was standing next to him.
