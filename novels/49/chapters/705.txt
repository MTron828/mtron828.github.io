Ye Qingtang took a glance at Chu Yi coldly.

Chu Yi was hard to fool with. Just as he said, she did not know Master Ao. It was just a lie that she said in order to be closer with Master Du.

“Master Ao’s disciple cannot ask Master Du to forge a weapon? Do you mean that even a disciple of Master Ao is more skillful than Master Du?” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled and sneered.

Master Du looked towards Chu Yi after Ye Qingtang finished her sentence.

“Don’t bullsh*t! I didn’t mean that. How dare you to pretend to be Master Ao’s disciple? You totally did not respect Master Du at all. Where are your manners?” Chu Yi scoffed coldly.

“Master Du, the price that I’ll offer will definitely not disappoint you as long as you are willing to forge a weapon.” Ye Qingtang turned to look at Master Du and smiled as she did not bother to talk to Chu Yi anymore.

“Price? What a joke! Based on Master Du’s reputation, what tempting price can you offer as a liar?” Chu Yi said.

“Since you can’t show any proof that you’re Ao Yuan’s disciple, find me when you’re able to do so.” Master Du was very impatient.

“Please leave now!” Master Du waved his hand.

It seemed that he was very unpleasant towards Ye Qingtang.

The crowd all started making fun of her when Master Du ordered her to leave.

“Such a joke! How dare he call himself Master Ao’s disciple? I have never heard that Master Ao had any disciple.”

“I think he’s just bluffing to gain more attention.”

The crowd started discussing among themselves.

“Please!” Du Sheng walked forward and said indifferently.

“Wait. Don’t you want to know what my price is, Master Du?” Ye Qingtang smiled. It seemed that she was not bothered by Master Du’s attitude at all.

However, Master Du did not say anything. He did not even bother to look at Ye Qingtang.

“Leave now. We’re not interested no matter what you’re offering,” Du Sheng said impatiently.

“Is it… How about Millennium Meteoric Iron?” Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up.

Du Sheng was stunned after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words. He looked towards Master Du instinctively.

The Millennium Meteoric Iron was a rare forging material. It was very limited on this mainland. Almost no one was willing to use it to forge a weapon or Dharma treasure.

If yellow-grade weapons could be mixed with a little amount of Millennium Meteoric Iron in forging, they could be top-grade yellow-grade weapons. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Thus, there were no words that could describe how rare the Millennium Meteoric Iron was.

Even the Bliss Forging Workshop did not own any Millennium Meteoric Iron.

Master Du took a glance at Ye Qingtang. He sneered and did not speak.

“Hahaha, that’s another lie. He lied that he was Master Ao’s disciple and that he owned the Millennium Meteoric Iron. Now that his lie was exposed, he still claims that he has the Millennium Meteoric Iron.”

“I don’t believe that he can really take out Millennium Meteoric Iron.”

“What a joke! Even the Bliss Forging Workshop does not have any Millennium Meteoric Iron. Millennium Meteoric Iron could make yellow-grade weapons into top-grade with just a few grams mixed.”
