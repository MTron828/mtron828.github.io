Chapter 1935: A Crushing Defeat (2)

The Holy Lord of Shadows had yet to make any moves. It would be a great loss of face to him if he had to rely on his senior brother when he was just battling her mere steed.

The effeminate-looking youth wanted to speak again but the grim-faced youth slapped him right across the face.

“Fool, are you still unable to see the vast disparity between your power and that of the demon dragon?”

The face of the effeminate-looking youth turned pale, but he didn’t dare to retort.

The grim-faced youth glanced past Ming Di to land on Ye Qingtang. He continued in a low voice. “Instead of wasting time, you should finish off this demon dragon with me. The Holy Lord of Shadows is our true target.”

Not daring to say another word, the effeminate-looking youth immediately nodded.

“Oh? Two of you at once? That’s even better.” The fire in Ming Di’s eyes burned even brighter at the sight of another opponent.

The leaders of the ancient clans couldn’t help feeling rather nervous at the thought of the other youth joining the battle.

“Holy Lord, is it really fine... to let Ming Di handle this battle alone?”

They had experienced the power of the effeminate-looking youth. And this second youth was clearly even stronger. Would Ming Di... be able to cope?

The corners of Ye Qingtang twitched imperceptibly as she gazed at the anxious ancient clan members.

That’s easy for you to say. Go ahead and help Ming Di if you can!

“Who are you doubting? That is Ming Di you are talking about.” The Demon Tribe Leader snorted coldly.

The ancient clan leaders instantly retreated. They did not dare to argue with the Demon Tribe Leader. In the end, they couldn’t even defeat that effeminate-looking youth, not to mention the other one.

Ming Di gazed at the two youths standing before him. He appeared to have no intention of making the first move.

The two youths exchanged a look and immediately went into full battle stances. In the blink of an eye, the aura of the effeminate-looking youth surged again. His eyes were filled with a cold, harsh light while the flames around his body morphed into a massive burning Buddha figure!

“What... what kind of skill is that?” The ancient clan leaders widened their eyes in disbelief at the sight of that flaming Buddha figure. They had never witnessed such a strange move.

The youth leaped into the air and merged into the flaming Buddha figure. A huge orange fire also appeared behind the grim-faced youth, which morphed into a gigantic flying dragon. His dragon was twice the size of Ming Di.

The raging flames soared high into the sky and the powerful aura was so oppressive that the ancient clan folks found it difficult to breathe.

What kind of powerful force was this?

The ancient clan members at present were all elite practitioners in the Central Mainland. But now, as mere observers on this battlefield, they were already having trouble breathing from the mighty aura radiated by those two youths.

Ye Qingtang also felt her chest grow heavy. Luckily she had recently risen to the Paragon level. If she was still at the Heavenly Venerate level, she would likely have exposed her true identity.

As such, Ye Qingtang and the eight tribe leaders were powerful enough to withstand the aura. But those soldiers of the Undead Clan were already collapsing from the powerful energy. One by one, they fell to the ground in spasms, their bones clattering non-stop.

The aura of those two youths was enough to shatter the bones of the undead!

“Mmm?” A sliver of impatience surfaced in Ming Di’s eyes as he gazed at the flaming Buddha figure and flying dragon. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“And I thought you guys were going to be interesting... boring.” Ming Di suddenly opened its jaws wide and gave an earth-shattering roar.
