Chapter 1681: One Wave After Another (1)

“Sister Ruxue, don’t worry. I will settle this debt for you. I will not let off those who have harmed you.” Baili Xuanyun expressed his loyalty.

“Brother Xuanyun, not only do I want her disfigured, I want her dead. She has utterly humiliated me today. I desperately wish to tear her into pieces!”

“Don’t worry. Count on me,” Baili Xuanyun reassured her.

Just then, the door was opened and the cool-looking Mu Feiruo entered. Her face remained impassive when she noticed Baili Xuanyun in the room.

“Feiruo.” Baili Xuanyun inclined his head.

Mu Ruxue glanced at the curtain. As if she could detect Mu Feiruo’s arrival, Mu Ruxue burst into aggrieved tears.

“Feiruo, that Ye Qingtang has gone too far today. I cannot let her off just like that. She has already passed through the final round and will challenge the top ten from now. This is a good opportunity to avenge Ruxue...” Baili Xuanyun immediately spoke up. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But Mu Feiruo just cast a sweeping glance at him and left before he even finished his sentence.

Baili Xuanyun was momentarily taken aback by Mu Feiruo’s indifferent attitude. Nevertheless, he didn’t care. He had to focus on how to avenge Mu Ruxue.

Soon enough, he came up with an idea.

...

That evening, Ye Qingtang and the rest of the group specially brought dinner over to Jiang Yiran’s room as he was injured. The group of them ate together. But before they finished eating, several Jiang family youths entered, their faces all battered and bruised. When they saw Ye Qingtang in the room, their expressions became grim.

“Wow, what happened to you guys? Are you really that nice? To join me in my injured state?” Jiang Yiran teased.

Those youths were not in a joking mood at all. Stone-faced, they said, “It’s that Ye Qingtang.”

“What?” Jiang Yiran was shocked.

The Jiang family youths narrated the entire story then and there.

On the way out for dinner, they met a bunch of people from the Baili Clan and the Mu Family. All should have been fine and well, but the youths from those two other families suddenly attacked them without any reason.

They were already a small group, and faced with youths from the two families combined, the Jiang family youngsters endured an utter thrashing.

After being beaten up, the two youths from the other families told them that they were attacked because of Ye Qingtang and Mu Ruxue.

As a result, they hurried over.

“Baili Xuanyun wanted them to tell us that for the next part of the competition, unless Ye Qingtang personally challenges him, he will send youths from the Baili Clan and Mu family over to make trouble every day.” As they said this, the Jiang family youths all glared angrily at Ye Qingtang.

They were not at all interested in the quarrel between Ye Qingtang and Mu Ruxue, and didn’t even know of it in the first place. But now that they had been beaten up for nothing, they couldn’t help being angry at the instigator.

They wouldn’t have had to suffer that beating if not for Ye Qingtang.

“What does that mean? What does Baili Xuanyun want to do?” Jiang Yisheng furrowed his brows tightly.

“Has he gone insane because of Mu Ruxue? Brother Yun has already agreed to challenge him. Why is he looking for trouble now?” Jiang Yiran was completely perplexed.

“How would we know?” The Jiang family youths snorted rudely.
