Chapter 246: You Have A Wolf Outside! (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Gu Yanqiu rubbed his temples and seemed troubled. Looking at Qin Huan who was standing before him after being beaten up to a pulp, his frown deepened.

“Junior Sister Ye, the situation is like this… When Qin Huan went to your room that day, the silver wolf had already disappeared.” To help Qin Huan clear his awful mess, Gu Yanqiu patiently explained the weird disappearance of the silver wolf right after Ye Qingtang departed for the mission.

That day, Qin Huan could not find the silver wolf and dragged Gu Yanqiu to search for it in the outer sect for days. He even almost searched under the blankets of the outer sect elders. However, the silver wolf was still nowhere to be found, and thus, in desperation, Qin Huan could only think of such a shockingly dumb idea.

Qin Huan nodded his head furiously.

“Yas… thas right… It ran away itshelf… Shenior Brother Gu and I shearched for a fery rong time…”

“Shut up.” Gu Yanqiu glared at Qin Huan who could not even speak properly.

Qin Huan pouted and kept quiet obediently.

Ye Qingtang had a complicated expression on her face as she stared at the gray wolf which was laying sideways on the floor, kicking the air continuously, with froth at its mouth after being pulled by the neck for a long distance. “So that’s why Senior Brother Qin found this gray wolf to compensate me?”

Qin Huan hurriedly nodded and was about to say something, but Ye Qingtang darted him a cold look. “Speak human language.”

Qin Huan ducked instinctively and tried his best to speak clearly. “This… this gray wolf is pretty good… I searched for a long time… That silver wolf of yours is too fat… This size of this one is definitely the standard. It’s even fierce and domineering…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the gray wolf whose eyes were rolled back and was still kicking the air. “…”

“…” Cold sweat trickled down Qin Huan’s face continuously. He hastily lifted the gray wolf’s head up and cleaned up the froth at its mouth, trying his best to make the gray wolf appear a little more mighty.

Ye Qingtang suddenly felt very pitiful for the gray wolf.

“We will continue to help you search for the silver wolf. How about you take this wolf back first?” Gu Yanqiu suggested.

Ye Qingtang was opposed to it internally, but seeing how the gray wolf was tortured to that state by Qin Huan, its days may be numbered in Qin Huan’s hands.

“You two will help me to search for the silver wolf?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Qin Huan nodded furiously.

Ye Qingtang hesitated for a while but finally nodded.

Immediately, Qin Huan handed the leash on the gray wolf into Ye Qingtang’s hands. Her lips twitched when she saw the leash used for dogs.

Qin Huan looked at her especially obediently.

“…” Ye Qingtang felt a little headache. She still needed to submit her mission and did not intend to continue wasting time with Qin Huan. Thus, she simply waited for the gray wolf to recover a little and walked it back to her dorm.

The gray wolf walked at a slow pace with Ye Qingtang. Perhaps it was because of the trauma from Qin Huan’s torture or that the image of Ye Qingtang chasing after Qin Huan’s life was too impactful, the gray wolf walked beside Ye Qingtang in extreme obedience then.

It must be said that although this gray wolf was found by Qin Huan to be a “counterfeit”… judging by its appearance, it was also considered to be a supreme-grade amongst the wolves. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang reached the door of her dorm. She glanced at the gray wolf and could not help but sigh as the image of the silver wolf could not be forgotten no matter how.

Why did it disappear so suddenly?

Ye Qingtang opened the door to her room gloomily with the gray wolf right beside her leg. As Ye Qingtang looked up, a silver figure suddenly appeared in her vision.

That domineering silver wolf was standing by Ye Qingtang’s bed silently just as it was when she left.
