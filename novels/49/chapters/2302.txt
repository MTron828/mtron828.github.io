Chapter 2303: Stepping Forward To Accept The Challenge (1)

Di Nuo was not the only one waiting for Ye Qing. Having heard the news, many students were also waiting for the infamous teacher.

They were extremely curious now after knowing the backstory. When would this audacious, arrogant teacher turn up and put on a good show for them?

“Don’t tell me that Ye Qing is too afraid to show up?”

“If it was you, would you dare? All six candidates selected for the Inter-Academy Competition. That’s a joke right? And if he loses, he would have to crawl out of the academy. If it was me, I would have fled long ago to save what little bit of face I have left. There’s no way I would offer myself up for such humiliation.”

“He can flee but what about Qin Feng and the rest? This bet also implicates those six students. If he doesn’t dare to show up, he would be forfeiting the bet. Qin Feng and the rest would be kicked out of the school…”

“Let them be kicked out then, it’s not like it hurts him at all. Do you think he would care about some students whom he has only known for a few months?”

“That’s right. Nothing could be more important than one’s own face…”

Just as everyone was discussing this, several figures suddenly appeared at the entrance of the arena.

The students at the outer edge were the first to notice them. They were stunned by what they saw.

It was Ye Qing and his students. Many students didn’t recognize most of them, but Qin Feng had been famous in the past and few would fail to recognize him.

When they saw Qin Feng standing among the group, they knew…

The show they had been waiting for was about to start.

“Qin Feng and the rest of them are here!”

Someone shouted out loudly and everyone instinctively turned toward the entrance.

Seven figures were standing at the entrance.

Those seven figures were of different heights and varying ages. But they all looked energetic and youthful, all dressed up in the Netherworld Academy’s autumn uniform…

And that was a snow-white robe with silver embroidery at the edges.

Those seven pristine white figures appeared in the crowd of students garbed in the normal black academy uniform, looking especially outstanding.

“Seriously? They dared to make an appearance?”

“They’re mad!”

The crowd grew even noisier as they watched those seven figures.

Ye Qing was at the front, leading the six students behind him while staring straight ahead the entire time.

The crowd instinctively parted to make way for them. But their comments never ceased. Everyone’s eyes were fixed upon the group, especially Ye Qing in the lead.

This was the first time that many students were laying eyes on the “legendary” audacious but useless teacher.

“All dressed in white, who does he think he is? This is what you call trying to put on a false front. I wonder if his clothes can remain so white when he has to crawl out of this place.”

The teenagers looked at Ye Qing’s youthful, mediocre face and skinny frame with mocking eyes, Some were laughing, some were scoffing, some were filled with curiosity.

Countless eyes landed on Ye Qing and those six teenagers. Despite the endless sharp, jeering stares, the seven of them remained oblivious, as if they were able to step above all the scorn and ridicule.

From the entrance, Ye Qingtang led her team to the front of the platform. Lifting her eyes, she met Di Nuo’s gaze on the high platform.

Di Nuo narrowed his eyes. Seeing Ye Qing was like seeing a lamb all ready for slaughter.

From his position close by, Luo Sheng’s brows furrowed slightly. At this moment, he didn’t know whether he should admire Ye Qing’s bravery or lament the youth’s impending humiliation.
