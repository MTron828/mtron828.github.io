Chapter 1891: Di Jiuyuan (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

For this poison, there were only those two units in the entire world. Apart from Liu Ruofeng, Di Jiuyuan was the only person who had one.

At the sight of that Absolute Ten Thousand Poison, the suspicion and doubt shrouding the minds of Liu Jiangran and her people instantly reduced by half. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Your master gave this to me years ago. On account of my past friendship with him, I don’t want to cause you all any harm. But if you still refuse to back off... Well, I am rather curious to see if this poison is as formidable as Liu Ruofeng claimed.”

With that, Ye Qingtang made as if she was going to activate that black globe.

“Senior, please don’t be angry!” Liu Jiangran was completely cowed and he shrunk back unconsciously.

The poison within would disperse from the moment the deadly black ball was activated. Once infected, even a Paragon-level practitioner would die a terrible death.

While they were still in the Ten Thousand Poison Valley, Liu Jiangran and his people had been warned over and over again not to come into contact with that poison. They knew just how powerful it was.

“Scram.” Ye Qingtang ordered, her expression cold and foreboding.

Having no other choice, Liu Jiangran and Liu Rusu could only retreat with their men. They were not a match for Di Jiuyuan. But at least they now knew that Di Jiuyuan was still inside the mystic realm.

With that in mind, they retreated and prepared to locate the exit out from the mystic realm. It was important that they returned to the Ten Thousand Poison Valley to report on Di Jiuyuan’s whereabouts.

Finally! Ye Qingtang heaved a secret sigh of relief as she watched the people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley depart.

Long Xiao and the rest also finally relaxed somewhat.

“Thank you Ms. Ye for helping us,” Long Xiao spoke up gratefully.

In all honesty, he had felt that Ye Qingtang’s powers were lacking, and never expected her to put up such a flawless and steady performance in front of Liu Rusu and her men.

Long Xiao had intended for Ye Qingtang to just stall for time until it was daylight when those monsters could deal with Liu Rusu and her people. He never expected Ye Qingtang to act so well that Liu Rusu and her men were scared off.

If not for the fact that he already knew she was a fake, Long Xiao himself would have believed that she was really Di Jiuyuan, given her authentic performance. Even Long Yao was now looking at Ye Qingtang with a conflicted expression.

“No need to thank me. I just hope that you won’t drag me into your affairs again. Here, let me return this to you.” Ye Qingtang tossed the Absolute Ten Thousand Poison over to Long Xiao.

She had initially found it rather puzzling—why was Long Xiao so confident that she could impersonate Di Jiuyuan?

So it was because they had the elixir and this poison.

Long Xiao was shocked by Ye Qingtang’s nonchalant handling of the Absolute Ten Thousand Poison. He hurriedly reached out to catch it.

“Ms. Ye, please don’t throw this thing around. We will all die here if you accidentally activate it.” Long Xiao also gave a bitter smile as he spoke. This Absolute Ten Thousand Poison was left behind by Aunt Jiu right before she departed. Long Xiao had kept it on him all this time, never expecting that he would have a use for it today.

Everyone finally heaved a great sigh of relief after settling those people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley. But they knew very well that this was just a temporary respite. Those people were just heading back to deliver news of Di Jiuyuan’s reappearance. There was no doubt that the main army of the Ten Thousand Poison Valley would be back.

“I say... Liu Ruofeng is so desperate to find your Aunt Jiu... is it for love or revenge?” Ye Qingtang asked with feigned ignorance.

Long Xiao was momentarily taken aback, but then he smiled again. “We are not sure exactly what happened in our elders’ generation, but Aunt Jiu’s rejection of Liu Ruofeng was indeed a major blow to him.”
