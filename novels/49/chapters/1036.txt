Chapter 1037 Sect Protector Divine Beast

The battle cries still seemed to echo in their ears.

Those long-gone faces and familiar bodies were imprinted in the minds of the masses eternally and would never be erased.

Sometime later, the Xuanling Sect Sect Master slowly kneeled beside the countless graves.

Noticing the situation, Elder Mo, Elder Qin, and the Xuanling Sect disciples fell on their knees successively and bowed to those heroes who protected the sect with their lives.

“Junior Brother Zhou!”

A shout erupted suddenly.

Everyone quickly turned around and looked behind.

A young man who was all stick and bones completely fainted when he bowed.

Noticing the situation, Elder Qin rushed forward hurriedly and held up that young man who was void of color. After inspecting for a moment, he sighed softly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This young Xuanling Sect disciple was yet another victim of the lack of food supplied. He had not consumed anything for too long, and his martial realm was insufficient from the start, which caused him to faint from hunger.

The current Xuanling Sect was already depleted of all supplies, and the river was all dried up. There no longer was any consumables in the sect.

A cultivator and ordinary human was different in that a cultivator’s need for food would gradually decrease as their martial realm improved. However, these sect disciples had not reached that stage yet. Moreover, the body would not be replenished if it did not consume anything for a long time, and this would also pose as a life danger over the long run.

“I remember… the sect still has a few spirit animals…” A long time later, Xuanling Sect Sect Master looked at Elder Qin and said.

Elder Qin and Elder Mo nodded instinctively.

There were indeed a few old spirit animals remaining in the sect. They had rendered their highest service in battles for the sect and were fed and taken care of for the rest of their lifetimes by the sect after they aged.

“Don’t worry, Sect Master. The spirit animals can barely absorb the spirit energy in the surroundings and don’t need to consume anything at the moment,” said Elder Mo as he thought the Sect Master was afraid that the spirit animals would die from hunger.

However, resolution filled the Sect Master’s eyes as he said, “Kill them.”

“What?!”

The two elders and everyone else at the scene were taken aback by what the Xuanling Sect Sect Master had said.

“Distribute the flesh and blood of the spirit animals to our sect disciples. As long as they can hold out an additional day.” Xuanling Sect Sect Master seemed to age by dozens of years in an instant.

“But… Sect Master, for the sect, those spirit animals once…” Elder Qin’s body trembled slightly. One of the spirit animals had been in Xuanling Sect for a longer time than he did and was even older than him.

“Elder Qin… I understand what you wish to say.” Xuanling Sect Sect Master nodded.

At this moment, the middle-aged man seemed like an elderly who was about to pass on, and his voice quivered.

“But… these kids… are all about to die from hunger… Is there any other solution?” Xuanling Sect Sect Master uttered.

Indeed, if there was still no food, how much longer could these sect disciples withhold? Was it one day or one month?

Even if he were to become a sinner of Xuanling Sect, the Xuanling Sect Sect Master could not bear for these disciples to end up dying from hunger or thirst.

As a cultivator, they could die from battles, but how could they… die from hunger!

At this moment, the disciples were dead silent as well. They did not know what to say, and even if they wanted to, they were almost out of energy.

However, before Xuanling Sect Sect Master could continue to say something, a terrifying roar sounded from outside the sect.

An enormous creature hovered above Xuanling Sect completely.

Above that enormous creatures were a number of Yunxiao Sect elders and senior executives.

“Yunxiao Sect… Sect protector divine beast!
