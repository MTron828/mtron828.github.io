1342 Ancient You Clan 2

“May I know which friend from the Temple of Shadows is in the Bone Carriage?” The Ancient You Clan Elder probed.

The Ancient You Clan and Temple of Shadows had always minded their own business and rarely had any associations. Although the Temple of Shadows was on a decline currently, their fundamental strength was still very strong. The Ancient You Clan was only here to punish Ling Yan, and they never thought that they would meet the Temple of Shadows.

Furthermore…

The Temple of Shadows suddenly intercepted and saved Ling Yan, much to the confusion of the Ancient You Clan Elder.

“Who do you think you are, smelly bug? How dare you address Ah Yao as your friend?” Ming Gu, who was beside the bone carriage, shouted and shot a cold eye at the Ancient You Clan Elder.

The Ancient You Clan Elder frowned slightly but looked at the childlike Ming Gu, who was standing beside another Undead who looked exactly the same as Ming Gu.

The Ancient You Clan Elder’s heart stood still for a moment.

Rumor had it that the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows was a mutant Undead that could not grow up and thus had the appearance of a child forever.

Moreover, the Ancient You Clan once gained some information on the Temple of Shadows that there was not one but two, a pair of twins, Holy Sons in the Temple of Shadows.

Now that he saw Ming Gu and Ming Wang, the Elder Elder immediately had an idea of their identity.

However…

Who could sit in the Black Bone Carriage if the two Holy Sons of the Temple of Shadows were outside the carriage?

A thought struck the Ancient You Clan Elder abruptly, and he probed. “Greetings, Holy Lord of Shadows.”

A soft snicker sounded from the black carriage immediately.

Yet, this snicker verified the Ancient You Clan Elder’s guess.

The person in the Black Bone Carriage was actually the Holy Lord of Shadows who had disappeared for a long time?!

The Ancient You Clan Elder was startled, as the Holy Lord of Shadows represented immense power.

Although the Ancient You Clan was not afraid of the Temple of Shadows, the Elder was still very flabbergasted by the sudden appearance of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

“I was unaware that the Holy Lord of Shadows was here and had been a little disrespectful. We came here today to kill Ling Yan, who offended the Ancient You Clan. Please accommodate us.” The Elder could not guess the meaning behind the Temple of Shadows’s action to rescue Ling Yan earlier on and could only speak with a probing tone.

“Have you all sought my approval to kill Ling Yan?”

The Ancient You Clan Elder was taken aback.

“What do you mean by that, Holy Lord of Shadows?”

There was no response in the Black Bone Carriage. On the other hand, Ling Yan bowed to the Black Bone Carriage with a smile and subsequently turned to look at the Ancient You Clan Elder. “I have already yielded to the Temple of Shadows. What do you think this means?”

Ling Yan actually yielded to the Temple of Shadows?

The Ancient You Clan Elder was astonished. No wonder Ling Yan was so fearless. He clung onto the Temple of Shadows!

Instantly, the Ancient You Clan Elder narrowed his eyes and said, “Holy Lord of Shadows, Ling Yan previously offended my Ancient You Clan and is someone that the Ancient You Clan must kill. Please accommodate us and hand this person to us.”

While the Ancient You Clan Elder was stunned by the relationship between Ling Yan and the Temple of Shadows, he did not pay much attention to it.

Given the Temple of Shadows’s position, even if Ling Yan surrendered to the Temple of Shadows, it would not go against Ancient You Clan over just one person.

However…

“What a joke.” An aloof voice rang from the Black Bone Carriage.

“On what basis should I hand someone from my Temple of Shadows to the Ancient You Clan?”
