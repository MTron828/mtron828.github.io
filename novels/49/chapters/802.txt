Chapter 803 Consequence of Your Own Sin (1)

“Grand Emperor, you’re useless now. My son is the Emperor of the Nine Nights Dynasty, and I’m the Emperor Dowager… the only Emperor Dowager.” The Emperor Dowager squinted her eyes as her disguise was exposed.

She did not only want the Grand Emperor’s love.

She wanted the supreme honor in the Nine Nights Dynasty.

“How dare you!!” Blood spurted out of the Grand Emperor’s mouth as he shouted and raged.

“Long Jiang, get her!”

Long Jiang immediately dashed towards the Emperor Dowager.

The Emperor Dowager’s eyes flickered. She raised her hand and threw the little Emperor in her arms towards Long Jiang.

Long Jiang immediately stepped back and held the little Emperor.

The little Emperor’s eyes were full of disbelief when he was thrown out by the Emperor Dowager to defend herself.

The Emperor Dowager took out a copper bell in the gap.

She shook the bell.

Long Jiang’s body shivered, and a pool of blood spurted out of his mouth in the next second.

“You poisoned me?!” Long Jiang staggered. A sharp pain came from his abdomen area. It was clear that there was a poisonous worm in his body.

The Emperor Dowager scoffed. “You are left here by that woman. How could I let go of

you?”

The Emperor Dowager had planned everything a few years ago. It took her great effort to poison the Grand Emperor and Long Jiang.

“Long Jiang, how would I not guard against you when you are the strongest person in the Nine Nights Dynasty? You are alive now only because you could suppress Qin Long.” The Emperor Dowager sneered. She raised her chin slightly and waved towards the guards behind her.

“Take down everyone here.”

“Mother?!” The little Emperor stared at her mother, who was always kind to him, unbelievably.

NO

The Emperor Dowager looked at the little Emperor and said, “Son, your father is dying soon. The Nine Nights Dynasty will be yours and mine in the future. The power we have here is unshakable if we are assisted by the Qin family. You are always my little daring. Come to me.”

The Emperor Dowager then stretched out her hands towards the little Emperor.

The little Emperor’s sight swept through the Grand Emperor and the Emperor Dowager as he struggled.

He kneeled down in front of the Emperor Dowager.

“Mother, please let go of father…”

A cold light appeared across the Emperor Dowager’s eyes.

“Mother, please. I… I’d rather not have the position as the Emperor. I only want both of you by my side. Please… don’t hurt father anymore…” As the little Emperor begged continuously, he knocked his head onto the ground.

His disobedience and mischief were just an act, an attempt of his to catch his father and mother’s attention.

He would feel delighted even if his father scolded him.

However…

His mother was always busy and did not care for him.

His father rested in bed all the time, and his mother did not allow him to visit all the time.

“Useless! How would I give birth to such a useless person!” The Emperor Dowager’s eyes were cold. She was still young, so she could still have another child even if she abandoned the little Emperor. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“If you can’t choose the right side, don’t blame me for being merciless.” The last warmth in the Emperor Dowager faded as well.

“Mother…” The little Emperor opened his eyes wide in disbelief.

“Come, take him down as well,” the Emperor Dowager said coldly. She would not need a disobedient child.

All the guards listened to the Emperor Dowager. They rushed forward once the Emperor Dowager commanded.

Qu Xiangyang’s eyes flickered and pulled out his sword immediately.

However, another figure was even faster than him!
