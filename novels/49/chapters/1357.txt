Chapter 1358 So Weak 3

An imprint of five fingers flamed on her cheeks, looking startlingly red. Her lips had cracked from the blow.

“You…” The General’s wife stared incredulously at Ye Qingtang, who had dared to hit her.

Dongfang Kai, who was nearby, saw that something was amiss. He ignored the pain from his injuries and hurriedly fled the General’s residence.

“How dare you hit me? Who do you think you are? I’m your mother!” The General’s wife had never been so offended, and her expression was extremely ugly.

“You? You’re not fit.” Ye Qingtang swept a cold glance at the General’s wife. She knew from Su Qiao’s memories that the General’s wife had never treated Su Qiao as her own daughter but continually abused her. Even the servants had better treatment.

Su Qiao’s abilities were mediocre, but not so poor that she could not learn a few punches and kicks by training with General Qiao. However, when Su Qiao was young, the General’s wife had seized the opportunity to spike her food with a slow-acting poison. Hence, Su Qiao’s body was not able to withstand any kind of martial arts training.

In the incident in which Su Mo’er had snatched Su Qiao’s fiance, it was also the General’s wife who had come between the original couple. Now, they had driven Su Qiao crazy, but the General’s wife still would not let her off. Instead, she wanted to send Su Qiao to another residence and kill her…

Ye Qingtang had no qualms about beating people like that.

Furthermore…

She had not used any force at all. She had just casually waved her hand. How was she to know that the General’s wife was so fragile she would be sent spinning?

“You! Master… look at this fine daughter of yours! She treats me like that!” The General’s wife held her face, looking aggrieved. But because of the slap, she did not dare to advance again, only complaining to General Qiao.

She was perplexed.

Hadn’t she destroyed Su Qiao’s body long ago?

How was it that the force of this slap had caused her skull to vibrate with pain?

General Qiao had not yet recovered his wits. His attention was fixed on Ye Qingtang’s kick.

Even General Qiao could not attain the force and speed of this kick.

When the General’s wife saw that the General was stunned, she was deeply unhappy. But before she could speak again, a dozen figures appeared at the doorway to the General’s residence. One of them was Dongfang Kai, who had sneaked away just now.

He was accompanied by many of the elites from the Dongfang Family.

Even the Master of the Dongfang Family, the brother of the General’s wife, Dongfang Qing, had hurried over.

The Dongfang house was not far from the General’s residence. Although Dongfang Kai was injured, he had managed to hurry back quickly.

The General’s wife had long wanted to get rid of Su Qiao, whom she viewed as a nuisance. Now that Su Qiao dared to hit someone, Dongfang Kai naturally would not pass up this chance. He had gone home to summon the others and was prepared to pressurize General Qiao into getting rid of his crazy daughter.

“Brother Dongfang.” General Qiao had not expected the Dongfang Family to arrive. But he was in no position to be bothered about anything else, so he spoke civilly.

Dongfang Qing nodded slightly. His rather sinister eyes swept over Ye Qingtang, who was standing in the middle of the main hall. Then, he looked at General Qiao and said, “General, or perhaps I should address you as brother-in-law? My younger sister has been married to you for many years and has treated everyone in your residence well. She has doted on your daughter, Su Qiao. Now, Su Qiao is not only crazy, but she has dared to hit her mother, who is her elder. You must give me an explanation today.”
