Chapter 939 Devouring Bloodline (2)

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, a voice suddenly rang out in her mind.

“Miss Ye, this girl has a mutated demonic bloodline, which has evolved into the Devouring Bloodline. She can devour the power of all the bloodlines in the world. She is looking for an opportunity to devour your bloodline. Remember.”

“Ling Yan…”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. It was indeed Ling Yan’s voice. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, it was a voice that Ling Yan had sealed a long time ago with the power of karma.

This meant that Ling Yan had known long ago that she would meet this girl in green and that this situation would develop…

Ling Yan’s schemes aside, Ye Qingtang was shocked by the girl in green’s Devouring Bloodline.

The Devouring Bloodline was also called the Taboo Bloodline. Since the time of the gods and sages, it was an invincible bloodline that had been cursed.

This was not to say that the Devouring Bloodline itself was particularly strong. However, the Devouring Bloodline could devour all the bloodlines in the world. Even a god’s bloodline could be easily devoured and converted for one’s own use.

Furthermore, it was already very difficult for most ordinary cultivators to possess the power of one bloodline. But the Devouring Bloodline was different. It could devour millions of bloodlines and integrate them into one body. Having the Devouring Bloodline was equivalent to possessing the power of all the bloodlines in the world.

It could be said that whoever possessed the Devouring Bloodline could devour any bloodline in the world.

There were many kinds of bloodlines in the world, each with a different effect. But all of them could give its possessor huge strength.

The Devouring Bloodline that could devour all bloodlines was so powerful and dangerous that it was terrifying.

However, the Devouring Bloodline was very rare. Even in primordial times, it had only appeared transiently.

“What’s the matter? Are you scared now?” The girl in green was looking at Ye Qingtang with a calm and icy expression. She continued to press towards Ye Qingtang at a moderate pace.

Ye Qingtang ignored the girl. She was still pondering the meaning of Ling Yan’s words.

The meaning of the voice that Ling Yan had sealed was amply clear: she should allow the girl in green to devour the power of her bloodline.

However, Ye Qingtang was unable to comprehend Ling Yan’s line of thought.

Why should the power of her bloodline be devoured by the girl in green?

“Could it be that the Immortal and Buddha Bloodline…”

Ye Qingtang suddenly frowned slightly, as if she had thought of something.

Besides the bloodline of the Divine Phoenix’s inheritance, an Immortal and Buddha Bloodline existed in her body. Based on what the Divine Phoenix had said, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao could be nurtured in her body because of the immense power of the Immortal and Buddha Bloodline…

However, the girl in green possessed the Devouring Bloodline and could devour all the bloodlines in the world. This meant that her Immortal and Buddha Bloodline would also be devoured by her.

In that case, after the Immortal and Buddha Bloodline in her body had been devoured, perhaps the Heart of the Heavenly Dao would also vanish… or perhaps, the girl who had devoured her Immortal and Buddha Bloodline would become the new vessel…

More and more clues and guesses continued to churn in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was unable to ascertain whether her guess was correct.

However, Ye Qingtang did not have time to think any further. The girl in green’s toes lightly pushed off from the ground, and she leaped over to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang immediately pushed her bewilderment aside and drew her Regicide Sky blade. With a flick of her wrist, her sword instantly swept downward towards the girl in green.

Swoosh!
