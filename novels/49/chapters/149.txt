Chapter 150: Mission Team (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang had been diligently training according to a routine every day to strengthen herself. Occasionally, she would exchange a few moves with Yun Shu, though they were mostly centered on the sect’s swordplay.

Two days passed like this, and Ye Qingtang heard some news regarding Zhou Qu.

After being beaten up to a pulp by Ye Qingtang that day, he was carried back to his room, and it was said that he was still dizzy and had not woken up.

Ye Qingtang was still wondering whether Zhou Qu would cause her trouble the very moment he woke up.

Yet, unexpectedly…

Others found her one step ahead of him instead. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang had just finished practicing her swordplay. When she exited the main entrance, she saw a carefree Qin Huan leaning against a tree and teasing a tiny-framed female disciple.

Qin Huan had a handsome face and peach blossom eyes. His smile was very attractive, causing the young lady to blush furiously and run away shyly while cupping her cheeks.

Before Qin Huan could regret over how the little junior sister he took a fancy on escaped, he saw Ye Qingtang standing a few steps away from him and glaring at him with a very subtle look.

Qin Huan’s face froze. Clearing his throat rather awkwardly, he went forward and greeted, “Junior Sister Ye.”

“Senior Brother Qin?” Ye Qingtang chuckled. She only met him once at the Rewards Pavilion the other day, and it was Gu Yanqiu who told her about the mission afterward as well. It seemed that Qin Huan came here today because Gu Yanqiu’s team was straightened out.

“Did Junior Sister Ye just finish practicing your swordplay? You’re really diligent,” Qin Huan said with a laugh with a senior brother tone.

However…

Ever since Ye Qingtang witnessed him flirting with two female disciples, Qin Huan’s image was completely shattered.

“Are you here to find me because of Senior Brother Gu’s mission?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Qin Huan nodded. “Junior Sister Ye is indeed smart. Senior Brother Gu has already decided on the people and decided to depart tomorrow. Thus, he wanted me to find you today to familiarize with each other in advance since we are going to be comrades in the hunt in the future.” Qin Huan smiled temptingly as his peach blossom eyes smiled beautifully.

“I’ll trouble Senior Brother Qin to lead the way then,” Ye Qingtang replied calmly without any change in expression.

“…”

Was he not smiling obviously enough? Or did his skill in picking up girls drop?

How was it that Junior Sister Ye did not have any reaction to such a “flowery” smile of his?

Qin Huan could not help but be a little suspicious of his manly charisma.

Honestly speaking, Ye Qingtang’s appearance stood out from the rest and was hardly comparable even in a place like Xuanling Sect. Qin Huan, who had smoothly picked up many girls, naturally wanted to flirt with Ye Qingtang as well. Yet, the outcome could not be any more miserable…

His male ego took a huge hit.

“What’s wrong, Senior Brother Qin?” Ye Qingtang looked at the defeated Qin Huan with an intentional puzzled look.

Qin Huan returned to his senses and quickly dusted off that sense of defeat. “Nothing. I’ll bring you there now.”

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up into a smile as she saw the sadness in Qin Huan’s eyes fade in an instant.

Although this senior brother did not have any principles, he was pretty cute.

Qin Huan still did not know that his dignified and majestic image as a senior brother long became “cute” in Ye Qingtang’s heart and brought her to the team’s gathering point.

Gu Yanqiu had already been standing there for a long time, and a few other outer sect disciples with powerful demeanors were standing beside him.

When Qin Huan brought Ye Qingtang over, those few disciples eyed Ye Qingtang up and down rudely without concealing.
