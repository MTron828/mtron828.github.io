Chapter 892 The Conspiracy

“I have to say that though you are arrogant, you’re really intelligent.” The little white tiger was shocked.

Everything that it knew was heard from the Elder, but the little azure dragon inferred everything on its own.

In this world, only people like Ling Yan could really tame an azure dragon.

“So, it’s real that Han Cangming is just a body?” The little white tiger looked at the little azure dragon meaningfully.

“I’m quite sure about that.” The little azure dragon nodded.

“Then maybe I can understand now.” The little white tiger’s face was very serious.

If the Han Cangming now was just a body, he would not possess any feelings.

However, Han Cangming treated Ye Qingtang nicely, so the only possibility was that the power of karma was left on Ye Qingtang’s body by Ling Yan. Han Cangming, as part of Ling Yan, was able to sense the power.

Since Han Cangming was part of Ling Yan, after sensing the power of karma, he would not do anything to harm her based on his instincts. It was the right thing for him to treat Ye Qingtang nicely.

“Ling Yan… Even such things are part of your plan?” The little white tiger looked over into the cave and murmured.

However, the little azure dragon was concerned about Ling Yan’s safety. The guide’s mission was to unite Ye Qingtang and the Han Cangming now.

However, from one perspective, Ling Yan’s plan was very successful. He tricked destiny, and even the guide could not recognize that Ling Yan was the real Demon God Han Cangming

The guide’s mission was to let Ye Qingtang and the Demon God go through the death calamity. However, Ling Yan was the real Demon God now. If Ye Qingtang and Han Cangming got married, Ye Qingtang would be the only one who would go through the death calamity. She would experience millions of strikes until death.

“Can you infer the cause of the calamity since you’re so smart?” The little white tiger looked at the azure dragon and asked.

The little azure dragon scoffed. “Of course… They inherited the calamity from the Heavenly Emperor.”

“Oh… Explain,” the little white tiger said.

“Actually, you should know that Ye Qingtang’s heart is not the Heart of the Demon God. Ling Yan pulled his soul and heart out from his body and was reborn… The heart is in Ling Yan’s body now…” The little azure dragon explained.

“Yes, I know about that. The heart in Ye Qingtang seems to be a death calamity that is related to the Heavenly Dao and destiny,” The little white tiger said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The little azure dragon nodded and said, “Actually it’s very simple. When Ling Yan was reborn with his soul and heart, the body was heartless. However, someone put a heart into the body, and it is thought that that was his own heart. For some unknown reason, the heart went into Ye Qingtang’s body, and the body thought that Ye Qingtang took away his heart. So, the heart is the biggest conspiracy and the death calamity!”

“That’s right. Even Ye Qingtang thinks that her heart is the Heart of the Demon God. However, she doesn’t know that the heart has nothing to do with the Demon God. Everything is just part of a huge conspiracy. The person behind all of this may be the culprit who destroyed the Fourth Domain…” the little white tiger said seriously.
