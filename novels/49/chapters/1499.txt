Chapter 1500 Big Demon 6

The alliances that were formed because of the big demon divided after its death.

They now became opponents instead of allies.

A few Demon Kings rolled their eyes and were about to fight for the big demon’s body as they were the closest to it.

The faces of humans and members of the alien races darkened when they saw the demon kings’ movement. They immediately dashed forward.

However, the moment everyone moved, an intense and horrifying demonic aura suddenly spread out in the surroundings.

The demon kings trembled as they sensed the intense and fierce demonic air.

This demonic aura was similar to the dead big demon’s.

There was no more greed in the demon kings’ eyes. They changed their direction and immediately ran away.

“What’s that?” The rest were not as sensitive to the demonic air as the demon kings. When they sensed something strange, the demon kings had already disappeared.

Suddenly, the sun was covered by a huge mass.

Everyone lifted up their heads to see a creature approaching in the air.

With the creature hovering above them, no one could see any part of the sky.

“That’s... another big demon?” Ye Qingtang felt her head explode when she saw the scale of the creature vaguely among the clouds.

Barely managing to survive from the last demon, everyone again felt despair when they noticed the big demon hiding in the clouds. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The last one was just dead, and now there was another one?

They had no clue where this big demon came from.

That was the reason why those demon kings disappeared almost instantly...

No one dared to escape now, and they all froze at where they were.

The shadow stopped right above the dead big demon. Everyone stared at the shadow nervously. A huge head suddenly appeared from the clouds, and before everyone could see its head clearly, it opened its giant mouth and bit onto the back of the dead big demon.

Its sharp teeth bit through the hard skin and flash; the moment it took the bite, a huge amount of blood spurted out from the wound.

The blood flowed down like a waterfall and formed a river of blood under everyone’s feet...

“Hmmm...” The big demon made a deep roar. It lifted the body of the dead big demon and flew into the sky. The giant body was dragged up into the clouds.

Blood poured down like rain instantly and landed on everyone’s body.

The big demon did not seem to be bothered by the rest of them here. It bit the body and flew away.

Everyone was soaked in cold sweat as they stared at the disappearing shadow. It seemed that they had just escaped from hell again.

The Land of Infinite Demons was extremely dangerous. No one knew how many big demons hid here...

It would be a gamble of death or survival if they encountered one.

This time, they were lucky that the second big demon was only interested in the body of its own clan member. Otherwise, everyone here combined might not even be enough to fill its mouth.

The big demon’s ability would level up if they consumed members of their own clan. Everyone here was incomparable with that body, and the big demon might not even notice their presence.
