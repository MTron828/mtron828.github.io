Chapter 2018: The Powerful Bullying the Weak (3)

“Northstar Demon Lord?” The heavily-injured tiger demon looked at the figure which had dropped from the sky as hope lit up his eyes.

The giant figure was the most powerful demon in the Northland Demon Tribe.

It was the giant ape that had just been given the title of the Northstar Demon Lord!

Looking at the mess around him and his fallen comrades by his side, he roared as his eyes turned red and he glared at the despicable invaders.

“Another one seeking his death,” the general said nonchalantly, his eyes cold.

No matter who he was, how could he possibly go up against their huge army?

“Kill him,” the general ordered, and the huge army rushed towards the Northstar Demon Lord. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The tiger demon looked at them in shock and struggled to stand up.

“Northstar Demon Lord, leave with the children right now. I will hold them off!”

The Northstar Demon Lord sighed and stopped the tiger demon who wanted to fight to the death for him.

“There’s no need for that. They are the ones who are supposed to die.”

The tiger demon looked shocked. He was familiar with the Northstar Demon Lord and knew that he was a simple and arrogant demon but...

the situation before them was not one they could easily change.

Was the Northstar Demon Lord mad?

But just as the tiger demon was wondering whether the Northstar Demon Lord was biting off more than he could chew, several bolts of lightning suddenly fell from the sky and split the road the Eternal Dynasty Army was marching through.

Hundreds of soldiers were instantly vaporized and turned into black ashes.

Before they could even understand what was happening, many figures had appeared along with the lightning.

The figures appeared like ghosts and were so swift that in the blink of an eye, a whole group of the Eternal Dynasty soldiers were dead on the ground.

The ground beneath their feet was instantly dyed in red.

“What’s happening?” The arrogant general was shocked by the sudden death of his soldiers and looked forward, only to see eight figures stepping on the countless corpses of his soldiers.

“How dare these mere humans brag in front of our king? They don’t deserve to live.” The Demon Tribe smiled grotesquely as he raised his bloodstained axe.

“When the cat’s away, the mice will play. Do you Ancient You Clan’s dogs actually think that you would be able to do as you wished in the Central Mainland?” The Goblin Tribe Leader smiled darkly as he held a head he had just ripped off.

“You need to understand that you are just dogs if you’re going to act as someone’s dog.” The Goblin Tribe Leader’s bone cracked as he moved his neck.

The Eternal Dynasty General’s eyes widened as he looked at the eight tribe leaders in front of him.

“Who are you? How dare you ruin my plans!”

The edges of the Goblin Tribe Leader’s mouth curled upwards as he disappeared in a wisp of smoke.

In the next second, he had appeared behind the General and had wrapped his sharp claws gently around his neck.

“I am one of the eight tribe leaders in the Temple of Shadows, the Goblin Tribe Leader...”

As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he slit the General’s throat and ended his life.

Blood spurted out from the general’s wound all over him but his smile remained grotesque.
