Chapter 484: The Paragon Skill (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Currently, there was a layer of golden flames covering Ye Qingtang’s body and was filled with a destructive force.

The golden flames were extremely strange. They clung onto Ye Qingtang’s body yet did not harm her. Even her hair and clothes were not damaged at all…

“That is…”

The Xuanling Sect disciples exchanged a look, and shock filled their eyes.

“The Paragon Skill?!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Not far away, Ning Luo was flabbergasted as he stared in disbelief at Ye Qingtang, who seemed to be walking out from a world of burning flames.

“Paragon Skill… is that very powerful?” A devilish smile was seen on Ye Qingtang’s face.

“Impossible!” Ning Luo’s eyes dilated suddenly. “Paragon Skill… There is a slim chance for only yellow spirit roots to understand it, and it’s extremely rare for green spirit roots to understand it as well. You are only a red spirit root, Ye Qingtang. There’s no way you can understand the Paragon Skill!”

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang sneered. “Since that’s the case, then what do you think this is?”

Ning Luo himself understood the Paragon Skill as well and thus was extremely sensitive to the aura of the Paragon Skill.

At that instant, the golden flames that enshrouded Ye Qingtang clearly had the aura of the Paragon Skill. Although there were some differences, Ning Luo could confirm that there was nothing wrong!

“No… That’s impossible!” Ning Luo shook his head. Ye Qingtang’s performance had completely exceeded his level of comprehension.

Humans had always been fearful of the unknown.

Coldness filled Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Ning Luo was extremely powerful, and if not for her Ultimate Origin Skill, perhaps she would really have been killed by him just now…

Despite so, the primordial qi remaining in her body was extremely little and not enough to sustain her Ultimate Origin Skill for too long.

Ye Qingtang was clear that she had to go all out with her fire abilities at this instant and take Ning Luo down with one move. Otherwise, the consequences would be dire if her primordial qi was exhausted.

“Die!” Ye Qingtang hooted. The golden flames transformed into billows of blazing flames, and a golden Divine Phoenix about a hundred meters tall was formed in the sky.

The Divine Phoenix’s eyes were fireballs which were extremely overbearing and arrogant.

Then, the Divine Phoenix groaned, seemingly causing one’s soul to leave their body. It was as though the vault of the heaven trembled as well and had to make way for it.

Swoosh!

The Divine Phoenix flapped its wings, and golden flames flooded out, turning everything into nothing. With a crushing force, it wanted to turn anyone who dared to offend it into nothing but dust…

“What… what is this!”

Feeling the imposing force of the Divine Phoenix, Ning Luo retreated a few steps instinctively.

However, the ice where the Divine Phoenix passed by melted and turned into flowing water, which then was evaporated in an instant and turned into vapor.

“Ice God!”

Seeing that the Divine Phoenix was impossible to stop, Ning Luo bit his tongue, and blood dripped on the ice before him.

Boom!

A loud rumble of thunder reverberated in the surroundings.

Under everyone’s watchful eyes, an ice giant appeared quickly and took on Ning Luo’s appearance. It held an ice spike in his hand and was donned in an ice armor like that of a God of War made from ice.

Boom!

The Ice God of War stepped on the ground and walked towards the Divine Phoenix slowly, causing the entire land to tremor.

“Roar!”

The Ice God of War growled frighteningly as the ice spike in his hand pierced towards the Divine Phoenix at the speed of lightning.
