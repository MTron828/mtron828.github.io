Chapter 2146: You Can’t Leave (2)

“I don’t have the cane with me so I’ll use a whip instead.” Ye Qingtang said with a nonchalant tone. It sounded strangely creepy to Meng Yao and the others.

Before Meng Yao could even say anything, Ye Qingtang lifted her arm and hit Meng Yao’s arm with the whip.

Whoosh! Meng Yao’s sleeve instantly split open and a bloody wound appeared on her fair skin. Blood stained her clothes and it hurt so much that Meng Yao broke out into cold sweat.

“Arh!”

“First stroke.” Ye Qingtang looked at Meng Yao casually, lifting her arm to prepare for the second stroke.

Meng Yao had never gone through hardship and she subconsciously dodged when Ye Qingtang’s suddenly spoke.

“Those who dodge will receive double the punishment.”

Those words were enough to make Meng Yao halt her actions.

Those rules existed...

Meng Yao didn’t dare dodge anymore.

The consequences were dire for going against the rules of the Netherworld Academy. For serious cases, students would be expelled from the academy.

Meng Yao was hit by the whip repeatedly and it left bloody wounds on her body. The sounds of the whip hitting her flesh wouldn’t stop and it made the other girls terrified. They were afraid that the whip would just land on their tender skin.

After fifteen strokes of the whip, Meng Yao collapsed onto the ground in a pathetic state.

“You may leave now.” Ye Qingtang retracted the whip.

Ye Qingtang didn’t hold herself back at all. If Meng Yao wasn’t already powerful enough, she would have almost died with those fifteen strokes. The other girls quickly helped Meng Yao up and escaped at the speed of light.

Only Ye Qingtang and Mu Ziying were left behind.

Ye Qingtang picked up the ragged doll from the ground. Ye Qingtang only realized that the doll wasn’t made with fabric, but rather, carved with wood. The doll wore some clothes so it looked like it was made with fabric.

The doll was made with great workmanship. The arms were adjustable and even the hand could move. It looked quite realistic. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang handed the doll to Mu Ziying.

Finally lifting her head, Mu Ziying looked at Ye Qingtang who stood in front of her. Ye Qingtang wasn’t tall as compared to males, she was even considered petite. However, when it comes to the young Mu Ziying, she was tall in comparison.

As Ye Qingtang stood back facing the light, it was as if she were protecting the pathetic Mu Ziying with her shadow.

Mu Ziying looked at the doll before she looked at Ye Qingtang, suddenly lowering her head. “Teacher Ye, this had nothing to do with you. You shouldn’t be nosy.”

“...” Ye Qingtang.

What the hell.

“Teacher Ye, you’re not powerful enough to become a teacher at the Netherworld Academy. Even though you made it in, you’re still new here. You’re going to invite a lot of trouble for yourself if you continue being nosy...” Mu Ziying said with knitted brows.

Ye Qingtang was initially exasperated that this little girl wasn’t appreciative of her good intentions, but once she heard those words, she couldn’t help but smile.

“You didn’t say anything earlier because you were afraid that the matter would blow up and I would be forced to leave the Netherworld Academy?”

Mu Ziying remained quiet for quite some time before she finally nodded.
