Chapter 2119: Chess Game (1)

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What the hell!

She knew that nothing good was going to come out of this day.

Not only had the Sea King come to test her identity, but he had also come with his grudge from losing to the Paragon Holy Lord all those years ago. He wanted to take advantage of the fact that so many powers were here to redeem himself!

Ye Qingtang was struck speechless for a moment. Her gaze brushed past the Fox Demon and his solemn expression made her feel even worse. It seemed like even the Temple of Paragon had not anticipated that the Sea King would find a second set of Sea Soul Chess.

“You seem very excited. What do you want to bet this time?” she said calmly.

“We’ll use the Sea Clan’s divine item as a wager again. If you win, it can remain in the Temple of Paragon. If I win, you’ll return it to me.”

It was then that she finally understood that he still couldn’t forget his divine item. He said that he was here to celebrate her birthday but he wasn’t going to just give her a present so easily.

Should she take up the bet?

If it was up to her, she was extremely unwilling, since she didn’t even know what Sea Soul Chess was.

However...

She was thrown into a difficult position right now. The real Paragon would not have refused.

That meant she would be exposed if she didn’t agree. But... there would be no chance of her winning if she did.

At this moment, she wasn’t the only one feeling conflicted. The Fox Demon and the others were worried as well.

They had never expected the Sea King to do something like that. Sea Soul Chess was extremely complicated and required a lot of strength. It wasn’t something for ordinary people.

Even though the Fox Demon thought that Ye Qingtang was the reincarnation of the Holy Lord, she had lost all her memories, so how could she even understand the Sea Soul Chess?

The anticipation for a battle spread across the room as the powers realized what was going on.

No wonder the Sea King had brought so many people today. He had already planned for this.

Ye Qingtang guessed that there was no way she was going to get out of this today. The Sea King was unafraid of the Temple of Paragon’s power. With the huge number of Sea Clan members outside, if she refused him today, this celebration was going to become a battle...

“Since you’re so excited, I will play one game with you,” she said slowly.

The people from the Temple of Paragon were all stunned to hear this. Elder Bai’s face sank as well.

“What is she doing? She doesn’t even know how to play Sea Soul Chess. This is preposterous!” Elder Bai’s face was dark. If she lost, the divine item was going to be taken away by the Sea King.

Elder Hua Hua said, “What else was she supposed to do? Look at the numbers of the Sea Clan are outside now. With the Sea King’s arrogant personality, he’s going to declare war on us if she refuses.”

Even though she was surprised at her accepting the match, Elder Hua couldn’t help but feel emotional. The Holy Lord was still the Holy Lord, after all, not fearing any challenge. She was the same even after losing her memories. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Little did they know that...

Ye Qingtang had only agreed because she was not the Holy Lord and the divine item wasn’t hers. The Temple of Paragon had said that they would take responsibility for anything that happened after all.

So there was nothing she really had to fear.

At most, she would only lose to the Sea King.
