Chapter 1754: Encampment (1)

Purple blood splattered all over Ye Qingtang, dyeing her clothes a dark purple. Right before the blood covered her, she saw a long, slender figure...

It was an eerily handsome man. He watched coldly and impassively as the fiendish demon’s blood splashed all over.

How could there be humans here?

Ye Qingtang was astounded.

But before Ye Qingtang could understand how this man managed to appear in front of her, she saw him bite into one of the dead fiendish demon’s arms. Between those handsome lips were teeth as sharp as a demon’s.

The fiendish demon’s arm was chewed into mush before the man swallowed it.

He was a fiendish demon!

Staring at the “man” who was still chewing on the fiendish demon’s arm, Ye Qingtang suddenly came to a realization. This man standing before her was no human. He was just a fiendish demon wearing a human’s skin...

Following the fiendish demon’s death, the oppressive aura that Ye Qingtang had felt also faded. She was finally able to stand up but her heart was pounding hard.

The fiendish demon she had faced earlier was very powerful, and this newcomer was even more so. He continued to chew on the dead demon’s flesh, all the while keeping an impassive expression.

Ye Qingtang had just jumped from a boiling pot right into the fire. She did not feel relieved at all.

The fiendish demon in human skin detected Ye Qingtang’s gaze. He frowned slightly and cast a disdainful glance in her direction. Although that glance was full of scorn and disdain, it didn’t possess any intention to kill.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help feeling very puzzled. But she didn’t dare to make any false moves.

That fiendish demon noticed that Ye Qingtang kept staring at him and increased the intensity and speed of his chewing.

“Useless trash,” That fiendish demon insulted coldly. His voice was dripping with disdain, but without any enmity.

Ye Qingtang was increasingly confused.

Could it be...

This fiendish demon believed she was so weak that he wasn’t worried about her escaping?

“You can watch all you want. I will not give you even the tiniest bit.” The fiendish demon spoke up again after swallowing a mouthful of flesh.

Give what? Ye Qingtang was puzzled.

“Since you are so weak, you should have just remained in the eastern cave. Why have you come to the western territory? Do you have a deathwish? How did our side come to have such a weakling like you?” The fiendish demon was full of scorn. After swallowing the last bit of demon flesh, he stood up and wiped the traces of blood off his lips. A contemptuous frown was on his face as he studied Ye Qingtang.

Eastern territory?

Western territory? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

What did he mean?

Ye Qingtang was full of questions but she could feel that this fiendish demon had no intention of attacking her. Moreover... from his tone, it sounded like she was somehow linked to him?

Recalling what the first fiendish demon said earlier, Ye Qingtang was now aware that it attacked her not because it recognized her as a human...

Thinking about the numerous battles she had witnessed as she journeyed through the mountain valley, Ye Qingtang gradually came to a realization.
