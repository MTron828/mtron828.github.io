Chapter 937 The Heart of the Heavenly Dao 4

“Misfortune may be a blessing in disguise. Qingtang, you don’t need to be too worried. No one is able to determine whether it is a blessing or a disguise. Although this heart may bring you endless calamities, if you make use of it appropriately, perhaps you can reprieve from death. You must remember never to believe the Heart of the Heavenly Dao of yours. Otherwise, you will definitely be struck with a death calamity and cease to exist.” The Divine Phoenix advised earnestly in a grave tone.

“Thank you for the advice, Lord Divine Phoenix. I will engrave this in my heart.” Ye Qingtang thanked the Divine Phoenix.

Currently, Ye Qingtang only wished to know what exactly was it with this so-called Heart of the Heavenly Dao in her body. How did it enter her body? Who did it belong to? Why did she become a vessel for it? What kind of presence was the mastermind who used her to nurture this heart?

“Qingtang, my last remaining power is already fully depleted… I hope that you can remember that you are the successor of the Divine Phoenix. When you meet any difficulties, don’t retreat and brave it head-on.” The Divine Phoenix’s voice suddenly weakened at that instant.

The Divine Phoenix had already died millions of years ago, and this last trace of spirit was just to search for the only successor.

Now, the Divine Phoenix had already fulfilled its wishes, and there was no regret to be spoken of.

“Lord Divine Phoenix…”

For some reason, dejection arose within Ye Qingtang as she looked at the Divine Phoenix which was about to vanish.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang knelt on the ground and kowtowed to the Divine Phoenix. “Thank you, Lord Divine Phoenix… I will never forget that I am the successor of the Divine Phoenix.”

“Good…” The Divine Phoenix was gratified. “In my last moment, let me give you a final present.”

As it spoke, a scarlet glow suddenly surged out and penetrated into Ye Qingtang’s body.

This scarlet glow instantly wrapped Ye Qingtang’s Heart of the Heavenly Dao and an extremely powerful force sealed the Heart of the Heavenly Dao utterly.

“Lord Divine Phoenix…”

Ye Qingtang gazed at the Divine Phoenix. Even at its very last moment, its last trace of spirit was still thinking about her.

“Ah… What a pity… My powers have long been depleted over the years. Otherwise, I may be able to help you with the Heart of the Heavenly Dao… Qingtang, remember: this heart is temporarily sealed by me, but it will not persist for long. During this period of time, it will be unable to continue devouring your cultivation, and you can strengthen yourself to become even more formidable.”

As the Divine Phoenix finished its sentence, the scarlet figure in the air dimmed increasingly and eventually turned into invisible energy that lingered within the palace.

“Lord Divine Phoenix…”

Seeing that the Divine Phoenix had disappeared completely, Ye Qingtang had a complicated expression.

However, Ye Qingtang realized that although the Divine Phoenix’s last trace of spirit had vanished, its energy was shackled in this palace.

“If… I could obtain the Spirit Condensation Pearl…”

Ye Qingtang mumbled in thought.

Before Ye Qingtang could think deeply about the idea, it was as though Heaven and Earth reversed.

It seemed like the blink of an eye yet also as long as an entire century.

When Ye Qingtang opened her eyes once again, she was already outside the palace and that palace was nowhere to be found as if it was hidden by an enormous power.

Ye Qingtang, who obtained the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, was finally sent out.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
