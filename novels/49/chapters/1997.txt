Chapter 1998: Sowing Discord (2)

A cold scoff left Bai Zhi’s lips as she sneered at them.

“This is a mistake that involves the Temple of Shadows as well. Contact the Ancient You Clan and ask them to return the Netherworld Ring immediately.”

Bai Zhi felt that the Ancient You Clan would never have dared to touch it if they had known that it belonged to the Crimson League.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

“I’ll give you three days. After three days, I’ll go with you to the Ancient You Clan to get the Netherworld Ring.”

Unable to obtain the Netherworld Ring and unable to vent her anger anywhere, Bai Zhi scoffed coldly and flew off. Outside the Temple of Shadows, the eight tribe leaders were all looking gloomy. They had never expected to run into trouble delivering the Netherworld Ring. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xue Fu was still kneeling on the ground, guilt gnawing at his insides to the point he felt as though it was almost swallowing him whole.

“This is all my fault. I never expected the Ancient You Clan to act, or I would have asked Ming Di to go.” Ye Qingtang sighed.

Good job on stealing it!

“It’s my fault for being too weak. I wasn’t able to protect the Netherworld Ring and caused the Holy Lord such trouble. Let me personally head over to the Ancient You Clan to demand it back,” Xue Fu said.

“I’ll leave this to you then,” said Ye Qingtang.

“Yes!”

Having found a way to make amends for his failure, Xue Fu immediately retreated. Without even stopping for a break, he quickly headed to the Ancient You Clan to inform them that the Netherworld Ring belonged to the Crimson League to force them to hand it over.

Ye Qingtang returned to her room.

On her bed was Ling Yan, who seemed to be tired from waiting for news. She was greeted with the sight of a ‘sleeping beauty’ as she entered her room.

Elated and not wanting to think too much, she walked forward and patted him awake.

“It’s done!”

Ling Yan got up sleepily and looked at the smiling Ye Qingtang.

“Congratulations.” His voice was husky and thick with sleep and made her heart itch.

“Your idea was still the best. Everything fell into place beautifully without much effort with the Drawing Spirit Stone,” she said.

“This is just the beginning. With the Ancient You Clan’s current power, they probably won’t provoke the Crimson League. It’s likely that they will return the Netherworld ring, and when they do, the Crimson League will realise that the ring is fake...” Ling Yan said with a huge smile.

“You’re sure that the Crimson League can tell that the ring is fake?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“There are probably people in the Ancient You Clan who will be able to tell that the Netherworld Ring is a fake, but with the rush and the other real Dharma treasures that Lady Ye placed in there, they probably won’t look too closely. They won’t be able to tell that the Netherworld Ring I made is fake without using it.”

Ling Yan paused for a while before he continued,

“As for using it, only people with a certain power and with demon blood in their veins can use it. There are very few of such people in the Ancient You Clan and they must have been rushing to hand it over to their Clan Leader. It will be too late once he has found someone to use it.

“At that time, the Crimson League would have found their way to them and they would have no choice but to hand it over. The Crimson League will realise soon after they get the ring, and the Ancient You Clan won’t be able to explain themselves afterwards,” Ling Yan said happily.

They could always say that they had taken the Crimson League’s item by accident. But they would get into trouble after trying to use a fake ring to trick the Crimson League.
