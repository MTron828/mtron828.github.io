Chapter 1665: Careless Words Cause Trouble (3)

It was soon Jiang Yiran’s turn to enter the arena.

Mu Ruxue was dressed in a long, pink dress and looked exquisite. As Jiang Yiran took in her slender figure, he was completely on high alert, his entire focus on his opponent.

Mu Ruxue soon made her move. As she raised her sword, the light glittered off it, forming a magnificent display. She looked as if she was poised to dance.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yiran was fighting hard. Mu Ruxue’s moves looked casual, but every one of them was lethal. After exchanging a few blows, Jiang Yiran was hard-pressed into a disadvantageous position.

“Isn’t that fellow, Jiang Yiran, usually very arrogant? How come he’s losing so fast now that he’s fighting Mu Ruxue?” Jiang Yisheng was somewhat surprised as he watched the match.

In Taiyuan Valley, Jiang Yiran’s abilities were top-notch. In the entire Taiyuan Valley, there were few who could beat him. They had not expected him to be forced into a tight corner so soon when fighting Mu Ruxue.

Ye Qingtang inwardly exclaimed as she watched Mu Ruxue fight. Mu Ruxue’s abilities were truly exceptional. No wonder she was the second most powerful figure in the Mu family.

Jiang Yiran was probably no match for her.

In the arena, Jiang Yiran also realized the disparity between himself and Mu Ruxue. He suddenly realized that Mu Ruxue’s blows were coming hard and fast, aggressively raining down on him one after another. It even looked as if she wanted to kill him.

How had he offended Mu Ruxue?

Why was she fighting so viciously?

Jiang Yiran was puzzled, but Mu Ruxue did not give him any chances. After many moves, Jiang Yiran sustained multiple injuries.

Just as Jiang Yiran was about to admit defeat, Mu Ruxue’s sword suddenly sliced at Jiang Yiran’s eyes and he broke out in cold sweat. Instinctively, he raised his hand to block the sword and received a bone-deep gash across his arm.

“How have I offended you, that you want to blind me?” Jiang Yiran was enraged as he glared furiously at Mu Ruxue.

Mu Ruxue laughed coldly and looked at Jiang Yiran mockingly.

“You’re already blind. You can’t even distinguish the ugly from the beautiful. I might as well destroy your eyes.”

What did that mean?

Jiang Yiran was puzzled. He suddenly remembered how he had teased Ye Qingtang yesterday, and how he had said that Mu Ruxue and Mu Feiruo were not as beautiful as Ye Qingtang. So that was why Mu Ruxue was trying to kill him.

It was just a few joking words, but she remembered them and hated him for it.

Mu Ruxue did not give Jiang Yiran any time to breathe. She raised her sword and advanced once again. Jiang Yiran was already injured, and after a few more moves, Mu Ruxue forced him out of the arena.

Just as Jiang Yiran fell out of the arena, Mu Ruxue’s sword breath suddenly flew towards his eyes. She was clearly determined to blind Jiang Yiran!

At that instant, Jiang Yanyun’s figure appeared in front of Jiang Yiran. He raised his sword and dispersed Mu Ruxue’s sword breath, but even so the force of it caused his chest to go numb.

Mu Ruxue stood proudly in the arena. She snorted softly, then turned to leave.

“Thank you, Elder Brother Yun.” Jiang Yiran stood up painfully. If Jiang Yanyun had not acted, that vicious woman would have definitely blinded him.

“Jiang Yiran, what happened to you...” Jiang Yisheng meant to seize the opportunity to insult Jiang Yiran, but when he saw Jiang Yiran’s sorry state, the words stuck in his throat.

Jiang Yiran laughed bitterly. His gaze fell on Ye Qingtang, who was next to Jiang Yisheng.

“Well, I was teasing you the other day and that lunatic now bears a grudge against me. Little girl, you had better watch out.” Jiang Yiran had not expected his careless words to almost get him killed.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback, then recalled Jiang Yiran’s teasing words from before. Jiang Yiran had spoken thoughtlessly, and no one had paid much attention to it.

Had Mu Ruxue acted so viciously just because of that?

“What do you mean? What does Mu Ruxue trying to kill you have to do with Qingtang?” Jiang Yisheng was confused.

Jiang Yiran glared at Jiang Yisheng. “Why won’t you believe me when I say you’re stupid? Sss...” Jiang Yiran suddenly cried out in pain. “Ugh, I can’t be bothered to explain it to you. I was too careless with my words, and somehow offended that lunatic.”
