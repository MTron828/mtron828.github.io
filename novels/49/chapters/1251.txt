Chapter 1252: Misspoken Words (2)

Luo Qufeng smiled and was about to speak, but a rather cynical voice suddenly rang.

“It is indeed surprising that the Luo Family can invite the Holy Lord of Shadows. However, the Temple of Shadows and the Luo Residence are not far away from each other, and the Luo Family has always been extremely respectful towards the Temple of Shadows. It seems that the Luo Family probably yielded and pledged allegiance to the Temple of Shadows. Otherwise, why would the Holy Lord of Shadows grace us with her presence?” A middle-aged man chuckled and cast a look at Luo Qufeng.

There was no change in Luo Qufeng’s expression while Luo Feng frowned slightly.

That person who spoke was the Manor Chief of Dong Yue Manor.

Dong Yue Manor initially had good relations with the Luo Family, but they completely fell out due to certain matters a thousand years ago, and there have been many disputes between them whether it be in public or in secret.

It was already shocking that people from the Dong Yue Manor came today. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

As expected, the Dong Yue Manor Chief had a scornful tone.

“Dong Yue Manor Chief, food can be eaten without regard, but that’s not so for words. When has the Luo Family yielded to the Temple of Shadows?” The evidently-irascible Luo Qi asked unhappily.

“So be it if you all yielded. This is your Luo Family’s matter. What is there to not admit? What is the Holy Lord of Shadows’s identity? How can anyone else be able to invite her? If your Luo Family did not yield to the Temple of Shadows, why would the Holy Lord personally attend this event?” Dong Yue Manor Chief asked with a smile.

Everyone was extremely surprised that the Holy Lord of Shadows came today and was filled with curiosity.

“Dong Yue Manor Chief, you must speak with evidence,” Luo Qi said coldly

Dong Yue Manor Chief looked at Ye Qingtang and cupped his fists. “Evidence? The Holy Lord of Shadows is right here. Is this still not considered evidence?”

Luo Qi had a grim expression and almost started a fight with Dong Yue Manor Chief. Fortunately, Luo Feng held him back and secretly shook his head while giving him a look to calm down.

Ye Qingtang did not utter a single word throughout. Looking at the chaotic scene before her, she sighed in her heart.

No ordinary person could be the Holy Lord of Shadows.

“The Holy Lord of Shadows is very reputable, and there would be many benefits if the Luo Family yielded to the Temple of Shadows. Isn’t there a saying that one will benefit by following closely behind heavy-laden wagons?” Dong Yue Manor Chief chuckled.

Luo Qi glared at Dong Yue Manor Chief, but before he said anything, Luo Qufeng, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke.

“Dong Yue Manor Chief, today is my birthday celebration. Your provocation is a little too overboard.”

Dong Yue Manor Chief scoffed. Just as he was about to speak, Luo Qufeng abruptly raised his hand, and a scarlet gleam shot out from his palm and into Dong Yue Manor Chief’s glabella.

Luo Qufeng’s attack caught everyone off guard.

People knew that Dong Yue Manor and the Luo Family were not on good terms, but no one thought that Luo Qufeng would suddenly attack someone on his own birthday banquet.

Everyone did not know how to react for a moment.

That red gleam pierced Dong Yue Manor Chief’s glabella at once.

In just a moment, the scarlet point on Dong Yue Manor Chief’s glabella spread throughout his entire brain rapidly, and numerous red blood vessels covered his entire body.

The entire process happened so quickly that no one could react in time. Countless red gleams shot out of Dong Yue Manor Chief’s body without warning and flew right into Luo Qufeng’s palm.

The red gleam disappeared a moment later.

Dong Yue Manor Chief’s complexion became extremely pale in just a moment, and he fell to the floor carelessly while breaking out in a cold sweat profusely.
