Chapter 1496 Big Demon 2

Roar!!

Reverberating through the clouds, the roar was so loud that it could be heard for hundreds of miles around.

The moment the big demon roared in rage, everyone who was flying through the void fell from the sky as if a boulder had struck their chests.

No matter whether they were powerful cultivators or Holy Venerates, to the big demon, they were as insignificant as insects.

Ye Qingtang inwardly berated them all as she fled with Jiang Xun in tow.

They knew that the big demon was extraordinarily powerful, yet they did not even check if the big demon was dead before swarming over.

Weren’t they seeking their own deaths?

One must know that any big demon had the power to destroy any mainland in the First Domain. No other creature could compare to the might it demonstrated when it gulped down a hundred thousand people in one mouthful.

Legends had it that big demons were servants of the Godfiend. They submitted to the Godfiend and were the most similar to the Godfiend.

Because of their eccentric natures, most of the big demons in the mainland kept each other in check, and the majority of them lived in seclusion. Otherwise, the mainland would have been utterly destroyed long ago.

Everyone lusted over the treasure that the big demons possessed, but were frightened of their power. Thus, they only dared to steal the big demons’ grave goods after they died.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was soaked in cold sweat. If this big demon was truly enraged, none of them here would survive!

By then, Jiang Xun had recovered his wits. He turned to see the destruction behind him, but what he saw caused his hair to stand on end.

The big demon, who stood over the clouds completely, covered the sky, and darkness fell over everyone. The mountain range had already been flattened by the big demon’s gigantic claws with countless bodies laying among the debris.

Demons, humans, aliens…

To the big demon, all living things were despicable thieves. These living things who tried to steal its treasure were about to die under its claws.

“AHHH!”

Tragic screams, accompanied by ear-splitting explosions, reverberated through the air.

Ye Qingtang watched as the Seven Saints of the Snow Zone fell from the void at the big demon’s roar. Before they could get up, they were mangled by the giant claws.

The big demon’s scarlet eyes looked down on the thieves from the clouds. The two blood-red eyes were like two red moons, glaring at all these creatures.

Beams of light shone from among the humans.

Surrounded by death, everyone now brought out their Dharma treasures to try to flee as far as possible.

But before they could use their Dharma treasures, a dark fog suddenly spread out from the big demon.

The fog moved with the speed of lightning and spread a hundred miles around. The instant it covered the area, it formed a huge barrier against the external world, enclosing the entire area within itself.

The powerful cultivators and demon kings who were trying to flee suddenly realized that the Dharma treasures in their hands seemed to lose their spirit energy. No matter how they tried, the Dharma treasures seemed to have lost their effectiveness and could not be activated.

“Dharma Blocking Barrier…” Ye Qingtang frowned as she looked at the area enclosed by the black fog.

The Dharma Blocking Barrier was one of the Dharma spells that the big demons specialized in. Any Dharma treasure within the Dharma Blocking Barrier would instantly lose its effectiveness, unless it was a true Divine Arcane Supreme Dharma treasure. Otherwise, it was as useless as a pile of scrap metal when it was within the Dharma Blocking Barrier.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
