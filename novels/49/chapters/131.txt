Ye Qingtang scoffed in her heart.

This Zhou Qu was an “acquaintance” of hers in her previous life.

Zhou Qu’s ability was slightly above average in the outer sect and was not considered outstanding, but the arena he set up was a nightmare for plenty of new disciples.

Zhou Qu’s arena appeared to be targeted against all the disciples ranked below him and seemed easy since one would win only by receiving three moves from him. But only those who went up the arena would know how fierce these three moves were.

Zhou Qu specialized in fist techniques, and the force from his one punch was enough to crumble a boulder. Unless one was made from steel, which disciple would dare to take his three moves?

The old outer sect disciples already knew Zhou Qu’s trap from long ago and would naturally not be fooled.

This arena by Zhou Qu was used to cajole new disciples.

The new disciples had just obtained the Xi Spirit Pills, and with Zhou Qu opening an arena here thereafter, wasn’t he simply waiting for them to suffer from their own actions?

In Ye Qingtang’s previous life, she saw many newly-entered disciples being beaten up by Zhou Qu until they spat blood because of their greed.

On the other hand, Zhou Qu used this to obtain a fair amount of Xi Spirit Pills from the new disciples. If not for the support of those Xi Spirit Pills, how was he able to climb up to the first thousand ranks?

Ye Qingtang looked at the same trick that Zhou Qu had used in both her previous and current life and fell into a trance. She was also duped in her previous life and ended up spitting blood from being beaten by Zhou Qu while the Xi Spirit Pills that were just handed to her were also snatched away by Zhou Qu.

“Senior Brother Yun wants to give it a try?” Ye Qingtang returned to her senses and turned to ask Yun Shu.

Yun Shu was slightly taken aback and chuckled, “I’m a little interested, but I’ll take a look for the time being.”

Just as Yun Shu was hesitating, a person went up the arena a step ahead of him.

Looking up, Ye Qingtang sneered in her heart.

The first person who went up the arena was not anyone else but Lu Xiuwen.

“I just need to receive three moves from you, and I can obtain a bottle of Xi Spirit Pill?” Lu Xiuwen stood on the arena arrogantly.

After looking at Lu Xiuwen, Zhou Qu flashed a friendly smile. “That’s right. I wonder what’s this junior brother’s name?”

Lu Xiuwen replied, “Lu Xiuwen.”

Zhou Qu’s face froze slightly. The purpose of setting up this arena was to trick those new disciples who did not know what was going on into losing the Xi Spirit Pills to him. However, he was not foolish as well; he had already asked around when the new disciples entered the sect. In this batch, there were two people with green spirit roots who were relatively skilled and born in renowned families. He did not expect that the first to go up the stage was actually Lu Xiuwen.

“So it’s Junior Brother Lu. I’ve long heard that you have amazing natural endowments, and now that I see you, it’s indeed so. There’s no need to continue this competition,” Zhou Qu said smoothly and immediately handed a bottle of Xi Spirit Pill into Lu Xiuwen’s hands

“Treat this bottle of Xi Spirit Pill as a first meeting gift from me to Lu Junior Brother. In the future, we will be martial brothers from the same sect.”

Zhou Qu was smart: Lu Xiuwen was pretty skilled and also a Formidable Heavens Royals. Establishing good relations with such a person was obviously the best choice.

Seeing the Xi Spirit Pill being handed to him, Lu Xiuwen did not say anything much and left the arena straight away.

This sight made the other new disciples even more excited.

“I’ll do it!” A new disciple hurriedly went up the arena as though he was deeply afraid that Zhou Qu would lose all the Xi Spirit Pills to others who went before him and not have any left to give him.

Zhou Qu asked the other party’s background as usual, but this time, he was not as amiable as he was to Lu Xiuwen previously and directly started a match.
