Chapter 1728: Being Watched (2)

Sprinting into action, Ye Qingtang went on high alert. She tossed aside her half-eaten food and tried her best to merge into the shadows.

That noise was definitely not Little White Tiger...

What on earth was it?RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At this point, Ye Qingtang had yet to fully recover and Little White Tiger was not by her side. She would be dead-meat if she encountered some monster from this mystical realm.

Time passed slowly. Ye Qingtang was extremely vigilant, hiding within the shadows. She fixed her eyes upon the entrance of the cave, her hand already firmly grasping her sword.

A black figure suddenly flashed past the entrance of the cave!

Before Ye Qingtang could ready herself, that black figure retreated from the entrance...

That thing flashed past again but didn’t attack the hidden Ye Qingtang. Even so, Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to let down her guard. She was drenched in cold sweat from anxiety.

They had already been too careless before.

Little White Tiger’s earlier suspicion was probably accurate. There really was something outside the cave watching them.

However...

What was it?

Why had it not attacked them yet?

Ye Qingtang was full of doubt, but also slightly relieved.

It was certainly no normal being if it could evade Little White Tiger’s detection. Although Ye Qingtang didn’t know why it had yet to attack them, she did not dare to continue staying in this cave.

No matter what, they had to leave immediately after Little White Tiger returned.

As she waited, Ye Qingtang continued hiding in the shadows. She did not move a single step nor were there any more strange noises from the outside. The black figure didn’t appear again.

But somehow, Ye Qingtang had a feeling that the thing was still there. It could be hiding right outside the cave as it had over the past few days, crouching in the darkness and watching their every move.

The thought sent a chill down her spine.

A long time passed and Ye Qingtang’s hands had already gone white from the cold. A familiar voice finally echoed through the cave.

“Don’t worry, I had a look outside and there are no monsters around. Don’t you think that’s strange?” Little White Tiger shook off the snow accumulated on its body.

Having been pursued by several monsters for some time, Little White Tiger couldn’t help but find it rather strange that there were no monsters at all when it scouted the area.

“The monsters here are not that easily detected, moreover, you are not human. Those monsters might not take the initiative to attack you.” Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to let her guard down even though Little White Tiger had returned safely.

This mystic realm was created by the True Gods to punish humans. All the curses were targeted at humans. As Little White Tiger was not human, those monsters might not proactively attack it.

However, this was merely conjecture on Ye Qingtang’s part.

“Well... shall we wait here a couple more days then? Wait until you are better...?” Little White Tiger questioned.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “Let’s leave now.”

“...” Little White Tiger looked perplexed. Did she feel that it was not safe outside? Why then...

Little White Tiger was about to ask but saw Ye Qingtang glancing at the cave entrance before shooting Little White Tiger a meaningful look.

The beast’s heart gave a slight jolt.

“My intuition was correct?”
