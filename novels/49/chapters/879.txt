Chapter 880 The Azure Dragon (2)

“No!” After knowing Ye Qingtang’s plan, the little white tiger shook its head continuously.

“The azure dragon’s intelligence is the top among the Fiendcelestial Beasts and the best in millions of demonic beasts… I don’t think it’s a good idea to catch it. It’ll be a waste of time, and we may be killed by it… Though it’s at its infant stage, we’re not sure whether we can beat it. Furthermore, my clan has always been on good terms with azure dragons. You asked me to help you to catch it… What if it’s leaked out… How am I supposed to live in this world? All demonic beasts will look down on me, and all Fiendcelestial Beast will treat me as a shame!” the little white tiger said seriously.

If it really did something like that, not only would its clan of Fiendcelestial Beast blame it, but their relationship with the azure dragon clan would also deteriorate.

The little white tiger was not stupid. It would never do something like that.

The little white tiger was so unwilling to help and complained constantly. Ye Qingtang sighed and said, “Why do I need you then?”

“Hahaha, Brother Ye Chen, we happen to meet again!”

Before the little white tiger could say anything, Master Du suddenly appeared.

“Master Du!”

Ye Qingtang was delighted when she saw Master Du’s appearance.

“The azure dragon is here now. You can catch it by yourself. I will not be part of this.” The little white tiger smiled.

A trace of confusion appeared in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Master Du stared at the little white tiger fiercely.

“What do you mean?” Ye Qingtang frowned and asked the little white tiger.

“Literal meaning. You want the azure dragon? He’s here.” The little white tiger raised its front paw and pointed towards Master Du.

“Bastard! If my clan did not help you when you were in need in the past, your clan would be erased from the four Fiendcelestial Beasts. How dare you to blow my disguise! You shall wait for the consequences!” Master Du pointed at the little white tiger and cursed.

“Who blew your disguise… I was just speaking randomly. You just admitted it yourself. This is none of my business.” The little white tiger was slightly intimidated.

“Master Du…” Ye Qingtang stared at Master Du, and surprise appeared in her eyes.

However, the moment when Ye Qingtang said her words, Master Du shed off the human skin in front of her and revealed the azure dragon’s true appearance.

“What… Master Du, you…”

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes wide. Master Du was transformed by the azure dragon?!

A tiny azure dragon appeared in front of Ye Qingtang. It was at most an arm’s length.

The little azure dragon was slightly bigger than than the lightning dragon. It stood straight on the ground with its back claws, but its size… was really… tiny…

Ye Qingtang’s eyes sparkled when she saw the little azure dragon.

“So cute.”

Ye Qingtang hugged the little azure dragon in the next second. She touched and rubbed it with her hands constantly. This was the first time she saw an azure dragon in her two lives.

She thought that the azure dragon would be a huge and majestic dragon that flew in between the clouds. How could an infant azure dragon be so adorable!

Due to the extreme intelligence that the azure dragon possessed, its eyes appeared to be brighter than the lightning dragon’s ones.

“Be more serious please.” The little azure dragon felt speechless after being rubbed and touched by Ye Qingtang for a while.

Now, it felt that Ling Yan was much better. At least he would not rub and touch him all the time.

“Master Du… Based on our relationship, how about… let’s sign a contract?” Ye Qingtang looked at the little azure dragon and said immediately.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
