“The Holy Lord is right. I am incompetent. However, when the Holy Lord taught me the Nether Sea and Flaming Sky move, there were many areas that I did not understand. I hope the Holy Lord can give me a few pointers.” The guard was very subservient, but he had shifted the conversational topic such that it was difficult to turn him down.

“Do you think I’m very free?” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly. She looked up and glanced at the Nether Fire Tribe Leader with a look of displeasure. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Nether Fire Tribe Leader immediately scowled and reprimanded the guard. “Don’t be rude to the Holy Lord.”

“Tribe Leader…” The guard wanted to say something, but the Tribe Leader waved his huge hand. “Get lost. Don’t embarrass us in front of the Holy Lord!”

The guard gritted his teeth and rose silently. But the moment he got up, a bright light suddenly exploded from his eyes.

The same moment he rose, the black fire that surrounded him suddenly grew tenfold. His entire body was instantly transformed into a huge fireball that sprang towards Ye Qingtang, who was sitting on the Black Bone Throne.

What the hell is this move?

Ye Qingtang was shocked when she saw the approaching ball of black flames.

She thought that the guard was at most at the early stage of the Heavenly Venerate realm. However, the instant he transformed into black flames, the aura around that fireball suddenly grew several times!

It surged to around the Eighth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm!

“Holy Lord, I have put a lot of effort into my cultivation for several thousand years. Why do you refuse to see my Nether Sea and Flaming Sky move…” A rather discontented voice emerged from the fireball.

Ye Qingtang was so shocked that her scalp crawled. She had been wondering what kind of move the Nether Sea and Flaming Sky was but had not expected it to be a major killing move that would allow the power of an Undead to grow by three-fold!

At that moment, Ming Wang, Ming Gu, Xue Fu, and Lady Ghost were all absent. Besides the eight tribe leaders, only a few elders of the Skeleton Tribe were in the hall, and their powers were around the Eighth or Ninth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm. They were momentarily stunned when they suddenly saw such a serious killing move.

After all, no one had expected the guard of the Nether Fire Tribe to suddenly attack the Holy Lord of Shadows.

Amidst the chaos, the eight tribe leaders watched everything coldly.

Ye Qingtang could not even vomit blood.

It had not been easy for her to spend five days in the Illusory Void, and her powers had grown swiftly to reach Arcane Supremacy Eighth Heaven. But now… the moment she was out, she encountered a Heavenly Venerate Eighth Heaven killing move?

This killing move straddled an entire realm!

It looked as though the black fireball was about to engulf the entire hall as it whooshed towards Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang’s back was soaked with cold sweat.

From the corner of her eye, she caught a glimpse of the eight tribe leaders, who were standing there motionlessly. She understood.

This was their way of testing her…

Fight!

Ye Qingtang’s brain moved at top speed. She suddenly recalled something. The instant before the black fireball rushed into her face, a faint golden halo suddenly floated around her body. Ye Qingtang sat motionlessly on her Black Bone Throne, but the golden halo around her seemed to instantly transform into a golden dragon that rushed towards the black fireball!

A dragon’s roar instantly filled the entire hall.

The next moment, the black fireball collided with the golden dragon. When the two forces collided, the dragon’s form suddenly disappeared and sank into the black flames.
