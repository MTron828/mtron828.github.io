Chapter 745: Causing Trouble (5)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In an instant, there was blood spurting out!

Scarlet blood scattered down as if it was raining.

Shock was etched all over Sheng Qianyu’s fair and clear face. The excruciating pain on his shoulder pierced through his nerves. He looked at Li Jingwen wide-eyed as his body crashed on the ground.

Li Jingwen looked at Sheng Qianyu coldly without a slight trace of pity in his eyes.

He was just a mere ordinary disciple in a peak, yet he still dared to come forward. If this was not courting death, what was?

Yin Qingluo and Yan Shu were appalled when they saw Sheng Qianyu on the ground.

“You Admirable Sky Peak disciples really don’t have any manners. An ordinary disciple also wished to come up and court death…” Li Jingwen let out a chuckle, contempt evident in his tone. He flicked the remaining blood on his blade away and pointed his sword at Yin Qingluo and Yan Shu.

“Which of you wants to be next?”

“You!” Yin Qingluo’s expression was extremely ugly as she gritted her teeth, wanting to behead the wildly-arrogant Li Jingwen.

However…

“Junior Sister Yin, back down.” A deep voice suddenly rang.

Yin Qingluo and the rest turned around to see that… Gu Yihan was already behind them from some time ago.

“Eldest Senior Brother…” Aggrieve and refusal filled Yin Qingluo eyes as she looked at Gu Yihan who appeared suddenly.

Gu Yihan walked to Li Jingwen’s front. When he saw Sheng Qianyu, who collapsed on the ground and was bleeding profusely, his brows furrowed.

“Bring him to receive treatment.”

The other Admirable Sky Peak disciples hurriedly came forward upon hearing that, wanting to bring Sheng Qianyu away from the scene.

Sheng Qianyu was already fuzzy by then as he vaguely saw Gu Yihan’s figure. When he was carried past Gu Yihan, he suddenly reached for Gu Yihan’s sleeves with his blood-filled hands.

“Eldest… Eldest Senior Brother… This matter… has… nothing to do… with Senior… Brother Ye… He… He did it… for me…”

Sheng Qianyu’s hands trembled as he looked at Gu Yihan with a strain.

There was a look of seriousness in Gu Yihan’s eyes. He slowly pulled Sheng Qianyu’s hand away and nodded at the disciples supporting Sheng Qianyu.

Then, Sheng Qianyu, who was losing consciousness, was brought away.

There was not a slight trace of fear on Li Jingwen’s face as he looked at Gu Yihan, who suddenly appeared, and his lips curled up instead. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Gu Yihan looked at Li Jingwen coldly with narrowed eyes.

At this instant, the Admirable Sky Peak disciples were extremely expectant as they looked at Gu Yihan’s back view. It was as though they had a pillar at this very moment, and they dearly hoped that their Eldest Senior Brother could return them justice.

However…

Gu Yihan took a deep breath, forcefully suppressing the anger in him, and looked at Li Jingwen. “Junior Brother Li, are you done causing trouble?”

Li Jingwen shrugged and said, “Senior Brother Gu, what you said does not make sense. How is it that I caused trouble today? If Ye Chen from your Admirable Sky Peak did not attack first that day, why would I come to Admirable Sky Peak to seek justice for my junior brothers?”

When Li Jingwen said that, the Blue Cloud Peak disciples who came with him immediately put on a weak front.

When the Admirable Sky Peak disciples saw those Blue Cloud Peak disciples feigning frailness, they almost could not stop themselves from running forward and skinning them alive.
