Chapter 1936: A Crushing Defeat (3)

“Roar!”

The flaming Buddha and flying dragon figures were instantly extinguished by Ming Di’s powerful roar.

At the same time, the two youths, who had merged into their flaming figures, plummeted straight down into the ground.

Blood spurted out of their mouths at the moment of impact. Before they could even try to struggle to get up, a massive black shadow suddenly appeared before them.

“AHHH!”

Terrible shrieks resonated across the otherwise silent battlefield.

Ming Di had driven two sharp claws into their abdomens and pinned them to the ground. Fresh blood poured out of their wounds and dyed the earth beneath them a deep red.

“Punks, you two have provoked the wrong people.” Ming Di gazed down imperiously at the two youths. It was as though he was looking down at two tiny ants.

The effeminate-looking youth continued to vomit blood and his face turned increasingly pale as he stared at Ming Di in disbelief. It was impossible. He couldn’t believe the fact that he hadn’t been able to withstand even a single blow from Ming Di.

How many ancient clan people had perished in his hands? Countless powerful practitioners had died in the face of his mighty power.

But now...

The effeminate-looking youth finally understood the taste of fear. This demon dragon was not something they could even dream of defending against!

All his aura vanished without a trace at this moment.

The ancient clan members, who had been gasping from the overwhelming aura, were now staring dumbfounded at Ming Di. They had been so fearful of those two youths, but the demon dragon was now stepping on them like they were insignificant little ants.

If they hadn’t witnessed it with their own eyes, they would never have believed the wide disparity in power. As they turned instinctively toward Ye Qingtang, their eyes were full of awe and respect.

The Holy Lord of Shadows had disappeared for 10,000 years. Those of them in Central Mainland had nearly forgotten the fear that the Holy Lord used to inspire.

“The Holy Lord is truly great. Those youths were indeed no match for the Holy Lord.” One of the ancient clan leaders discreetly wiped off his cold sweat as he addressed Ye Qingtang with utmost respect. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang, “...”

Was this demon dragon that powerful?!!

“No wonder the Holy Lord was unwilling to step in. They were unworthy.” Finally snapping out of their daze, the other ancient clan folks also started to laud Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang cast a mild look in their direction but otherwise remained silent.

Inwardly, she felt that she had gained yet another layer of understanding of just how formidable Ming Di and the Holy Lord of Shadows were.

No wonder the Holy Lord of Shadows had been touted as the most powerful being in Central Mainland. Just Ming Di alone was enough to destroy a good number of the elite practitioners in Central Mainland.

Now that Ming Di had overcome those two youths, Ye Qingtang wanted to get more information from them.

She had a feeling that there was a greater power behind these two youths. Otherwise, given their young age, how could these two youngsters possibly know so much?

Just as Ming Di was prepared to swallow them both, Ye Qingtang spoke up. “I want them alive.”

Ming Di looked very unhappy, but he still shut his jaws.

The grim-faced youth saw that they were no match for Ming Di. He started gathering his energy again and just as everyone thought he was going to make a last-ditch attempt to fight back, he suddenly turned and directed his attack on the dying, effeminate-looking youth.

The effeminate-looking youth never imagined that he would die at the hands of his own people. He died with his eyes wide open as he choked on his final breath.
