Chapter 923 Faced With Beauty (4)

Then, he approached slowly and gently grasped Ye Qingtang’s small hand. Without waiting for Ye Qingtang to respond, Ling Yan tugged at Ye Qingtang and pulled her into his embrace.

“You are the biggest wedding present.”

“…” Ye Qingtang was shocked.

What was going on?

Was Ling Yan manipulating her?!

“Miss Ye, could you have forgotten?” Ling Yan said as he gently held Ye Qingtang in his embrace.

“I’ve said it before. Since you have nothing to repay me with, you should marry me.” Ling Yan laughed softly, not giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak.

Of course, Ye Qingtang understood what those words meant. It was just that Ye Qingtang had thought that Ling Yan was manipulating her, so she had acted dumb and did not give Ling Yan a chance to manipulate

her.

Right now, Ye Qingtang could not recall why and when Ling Yan had first said these words.

“That’s enough….”

Ye Qingtang pushed Ling Yan aside almost instinctively.

What was that Ling Yan plotting now?

However, Ye Qingtang’s push sent Ling Yan flying.

Ling Yan knocked against something and fell to the ground, fainting.

IIIL

Ye Qingtang wiped her forehead. She had pushed him instinctively, forgetting that Ling Yan’s martial cultivation was… truly… F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

With her current ability, how could he withstand that kind of damage from her?

“Ling Yan… are you alright?”

Ye Qingtang could not help but feel somewhat worried when she saw the unresponsive Ling Yan lying on the ground.

If she had really hurt this fellow, then she was really…

Ling Yan was the one who had brought about her rebirth. Ling Yan had also helped her many times in the past.

Ye Qingtang asked herself whether she was someone who repaid good for evil. She immediately hurried forward and helped Ling Yan up.

Just as Ye Qingtang helped Ling Yan up.

Ling Yan’s closed eyes suddenly opened!

It was as if his narrow eyes were filled with stars. He gazed unblinkingly at Ye Qingtang, who was just inches away.

Ye Qingtang could not help but be taken aback by this pair of eyes that stared at her unwaveringly.

But before Ye Qingtang could return to her senses, Ling Yan suddenly raised his head and pressed against Ye Qingtang.

Ling Yan’s speed was shocking. Ye Qingtang was completely unable to react.

Under Ye Qingtang’s surprised gaze, Ling Yan smiling lips peremptorily kissed Ye Qingtang.

He gained the initiative and pulled Ye Qingtang into his embrace with one arm. This outrageous invasion was akin to a king occupying a territory.

When she felt the warmth of his lips, Ye Qingtang suddenly came to her senses and pushed Ling Yan aside.

“You dare manipulate me!” Ye Qingtang glared at Ling Yan angrily.

Ling Yan only looked at Ye Qingtang with a half-smile.

It was as if some warmth lingered at the corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips. As she looked at the half-smiling Ling Yan, Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and said, “If I don’t kill you today, my name is not Ye Qingtang!”

Ye Qingtang immediately drew her Regicide Sky Blade and slashed at Ling Yan.

When he saw Ye Qingtang coming at him with her knife, Ling Yan only shook his head. “Do you want to murder your dear husband on your wedding night?”

“Dear your head!” Ye Qingtang glared at Ling Yan.

Damn his wedding night!

To hell with murdering her dear husband!

“If my wife wishes to kiss my head, then as a husband, I have no choice but to obey.” Ling Yan laughed softly, and his eyes filled with a doting expression.
