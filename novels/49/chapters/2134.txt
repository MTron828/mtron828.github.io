At this point, everyone’s attention was focused on Nangong Lie and Lei Yan. No one noticed the sudden appearance of an additional person.

“Stop it, both of you. I heard that a new teacher is coming to teach us today. He will be here any moment now.” A pale, handsome teenager spoke, the hint of a smile at the corners of his lips. But that pallid complexion looked rather worrying.

“Another dumb teacher. Who cares? I’m not afraid of him.” Lei Yan sneered, putting on a bullying stance. In response, the handsome teenager smiled but kept silent.

Eyes scanning the room, he saw a petite girl sitting in the corner. She appeared to be only about 12 to 13 years old and was sitting there quietly, a tattered-looking patchwork cloth doll in her arms. Apart from her, there was another figure sleeping on the table in the back row of the classroom.

After analyzing the group, she realized that there was no one normal in here. But as he looked toward the front, he realized that a refined-looking, slender youth had suddenly appeared and was sitting on a chair near the door.

“Lei Yan, stop talking to this fool. Let’s finish our fight.” Nangong Lie continued to challenge him.

There was no way Lei Yan would tolerate such provocation. He flung his sleeves and charged forward to fight him.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang sat there with her chin propped up on one hand, watching these two impulsive teenagers about to engage in a fight. She then glanced down at the booklet in her other hand, ignoring the ruckus.

Nangong Lie and Lei Yan started fighting, the classroom filled with their boisterous movements.

But before long, Lei Yan was pressed onto the floor by Nangong Lie. He was already seeing stars from the vicious beating, but he refused to beg for mercy. Instead, he cursed Nangong Lie and all his ancestors.

“Lei Yan, I would shut up if I were you. This mouth of yours is so useless, all it has done is to gain you a few more punches.” Nangong Lie chortled as he sat on Lei Yan’s belly. Everytime Lei Yan cursed at him, he would give him a punch in return. He showed him no mercy at all.

“Nangong Lie, just you wait and see. I will gather some men to kill you!”

“Ooh, I’m so scared...” Nangong Lie laughed out loud before giving him another vicious punch.

Seeing that the fight had gone on long enough, Ye Qingtang finally stood up and walked to the front of the classroom.

“Are you done fighting?”

The others in the classroom snapped out of their trance at the sudden new voice. Apart from the teenager who had noticed Ye Qingtang earlier, this was the first time that the rest of them had noticed the arrival of this nondescript youth.

When did this guy arrive?

“Let me introduce myself. I am Ye Qing, your teacher from now on.” Ye Qingtang grinned, acting as if the unruly scene before her was completely normal.

“Ye Qing? I’ve never heard of you before... when did the Netherworld Academy hire a new teacher?” Nangong Lie looked very suspicious.

Taking advantage of this situation, Lei Yan scrambled to his feet. He was behaving himself now and didn’t continue his fight with Nangong Lie.

“Greetings Teacher Ye Qing. I am Yun Chen.” The pale handsome teenager spoke up first. He bowed politely toward Ye Qingtang, looking very respectful.

“I... I am Jing Ze...” The timid teenager also spoke up in a trembling voice.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
