Chapter 789 A Fierce Struggle (3)

The Blood Moon Elder rolled up his sleeves immediately, preparing to join the fight.

However, a few guards whom Qin Long brought over suddenly arrived to the Blood Moon Elder’s side and said, “Miss Ouyang, this person is dangerous. Please leave quickly.”

Leave quickly?

With a glare, the Blood Moon Elder crushed the two guards’ head by ramming them together. He then leapt and dashed into the battlefield, and he stood on Ye Qingtang’s side.

In a towering rage, Qin Long was surprised to see “Ouyang Qian” suddenly joining the battlefield.

“Ouyang Qian, what are you doing?”

“I am Ouyang family clan’s Young Miss. Do I still need to explain to you what I’m doing?” The Blood Moon Elder scoffed coldly.

Hatred was written in Qin Long’s narrowed eyes.

“Ouyang Qian, my son treated you well, and the two of you were deeply in love. Yet, you’re actually protecting my son’s murderer now!”

“Pfft! Who is deeply in love with your son? How is it possible for me to take a fancy on that dog?” The Blood Moon Elder replied.

Qin Long was so infuriated that he felt a pang in his chest.

“Holy Lady, I’m here to assist you.” The Blood Moon Elder whispered to Ye Qingtang.

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

The citizens were stupefied.

Who exactly was this beautiful young man?

Not only did he kill Qin Chen in public, even Ouyang family clan’s Young Miss did not hesitate to step forward for him now!

“Holy Lady, this wolf of yours is pretty good.” The Blood Moon Elder glanced at the silver wolf aside. He had seen this silver wolf from afar for a few times, and today was the first time he saw it up close.

“…” The silver wolf stared blankly at him. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Attack! Just don’t injure Ouyang Qian.” Qin Long ordered coldly. He did not know what bewitching potion this “Ouyang Qian” ate such that she actually would help this Ye fellow. However, if he really killed Ouyang Qian, the Ouyang family clan would completely fall out with him.

Thousands of guards swarmed up, and more city guards rushed over upon receiving orders. An exceptionally fierce battle ensued on the streets of the monarch city.

In just a few breaths, the streets near the battlefield were rounded by the city guards.

The little white tiger looked at the endless guards before him as its saliva for spitting fire almost dried up.

A sharp, murderous expression flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes all of a sudden. With a leap, the Demonic Blood Sword in her hands was suddenly covered in a layer of golden fire, and she slashed her sword down.

In a split second, the sword aura mixed with golden flames swept dozens of meters across!

With a loud boom, everyone within the radius of the sword aura was swept away.

Near a thousand people fell to the ground!

The monarch city citizens who hid in the corner were astonished as they watched the fierce battle before their eyes.

The Qin family clan was very arrogant and cruel in the Nine Nights Dynasty, and the citizens had lived in repression for many years. Now that they saw the only young man who dared to challenge the Qin family clan’s position striking, everyone’s anger was vented.

More and more city garrisons rushed over, but no matter their numbers, they were easily settled by Ye Qingtang.

In just the blink of an eye, dead bodies laid everywhere, and an intense smell of blood diffused in the air.

As Qin Long watched the powerful figures and garrison that he brought over collapse to Ye Qingtang’s blows, shock gradually filled his eyes. He did not believe this half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord’s inner qi would not be exhausted from battling the tens of thousands of garrison troops in the monarch city!
