Chapter 1256: Ambush (3)

Luo Qufeng’s eyes sharpened. He raised his hand immediately, and a beam of red light emerged from his palm; his posture was exactly the same as when he absorbed the powers of Manor Chief Dong Yue.

Seeing that Suo Mu was about to fall for the attack, Luo Qufeng suddenly spotted a special figure in the scuffle from the corner of his eyes.

He suddenly raised his hand and narrowed his eyes as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who was seated calmly in the middle of the brawl.

In such a great fight, Ye Qingtang actually did not move an inch, and it even seemed as though the smile on her face never disappeared.

The Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows was extremely renowned in the Central Mainland, and her skills demanded even more respect.

A thought struck Luo Qufeng.

If he could absorb the powers of the Holy Lord of Shadows and use it for himself…

His powers would definitely increase by leaps and bounds!

Luo Qufeng slapped Suo Mu’s face immediately.

“Brother Suo, don’t worry. I will absorb your powers later.” Then, Luo Qufeng leaped straight towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang, who was initially sitting at a side, observed the situation. The moment she saw Suo Mu and Hong Zhong’s defeat, her heart reached rock bottom.

Amongst everyone present today, it could be said that Suo Mu and Hong Zhong were the two most powerful people.

Yet, these two people were still not Luo Qufeng’s opponent even after joining forces.

As she had thought, Luo Qufeng had indeed concealed his abilities.

Just as Ye Qingtang mulled over this, she suddenly noticed that Luo Qufeng, who was about to attack Suo Mu, took a look at her. In the next second, he threw Suo Mu aside and came straight for her!

Ye Qingtang’s heart turned cold.

Why can’t you find someone else!

Why are you coming for me!!!

All Ye Qingtang wanted to do now was to flee. She could not even defeat Cloud Eagle Sect’s Grand Elder earlier on, much less Luo Qufeng, who fought against two of the twelve Saints by himself.

However, the Undead Clan behind her did not move. If she ran, the Undead Clan would see through her identity within two steps and kill her instantly.

Ye Qingtang was about to cry as she looked at Luo Qufeng, who was already right before her eyes.

What sin did she commit!

Whether she fled or not, the outcome was still death!

“Holy Lord is indeed the Holy Lord. You are still so composed even in the face of such a situation. You have my admiration,” Luo Qufeng looked at Ye Qingtang and said with a smile.

Did she dare to move?

She could not defeat him nor escape!

Ye Qingtang was extremely indignant deep down, but she still maintained the dignity and composure of a Holy Lord as she smiled at the ill-intentioned Luo Qufeng

At this instant, everyone sensed Luo Qufeng’s movement and, in the midst of the fight, their eyes silently focused on Ye Qingtang. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Seeing that two of the twelve Saints were defeated, everyone was already aware that Luo Qufeng’s skills were exceedingly high and not what they could go against. Furthermore, Luo Qufeng continuously absorbed the powers of the people present, which meant that his skills would only become more and more powerful and that they would undoubtedly be defeated.

In despair, all hope was on Ye Qingtang who had not made a move yet.

“I’ve long heard about the prowess of the Holy Lord of Shadows. Although I fought alongside you against the powerful figures of the Second Domain, I did not have the opportunity to witness your skills. Can you do me the honor to exchange a few moves with me today?” Luo Qufeng’s words were polite, but his ambitious eyes revealed his desire for the Holy Lord of Shadows’ powers.

Ye Qingtang’s heart raced furiously, but she did not dare to show any abnormality on her face and could only smile without saying anything.

No!

Even if she died, she would not show any unusual behavior!

If she did, she would be dead…
