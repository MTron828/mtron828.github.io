Chapter 2296: A Gamble (3)

Even the arrogant Di Nuo did not have such confidence.

To think that Ye Qing dared to make such a claim!

And in front of Wen Qi.

“Ye Qing, are you just trying to delay…” Di Nuo did not believe that Ye Qing was really trying to make this bet. He was just trying to delay the inevitable by a few days.

“What? Teacher Di Nuo does not dare to take on this bet with me?” Ye Qing glanced at him from the corner of her eye.

Di Nuo’s face darkened.

“How do you want this bet to go?”

“If any one of them fails to qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition, I will immediately leave the Netherworld Academy, never to step foot inside here ever again.”

Di Nuo laughed.

“Ye Qing, your bet is meaningless. You already have to leave if Lei Yan and the rest show no improvement.”

Ye Qing continued, “On top of that, I will kick Qin Feng and the rest out of the Netherworld Academy before I leave.”

Everyone was bewildered by Ye Qing’s words.

The academy had already planned to kick Qin Feng and the others out of the academy. But they had just postponed the act. One reason was because of Ye Qing’s arrival, and the other was because of the family backgrounds of some of them.

Jing Ze was a commoner and the Qin family was already in decline. But the Leiting family would probably kick up a big fuss…

This was one of the reasons why the academy kept on pushing back the act of kicking them out.

But if Ye Qing carried out this dirty deed for them, the family clans would direct their anger toward him alone. And soon after, Ye Qing would be kicked out of the Netherworld Academy.

There was no way the family clans could hold the Netherworld Academy responsible.

The Netherworld Academy was not afraid of those family clans. It was just that they did not want to stir up unnecessary trouble.

“Not enough… still not enough…” Di Nuo narrowed his eyes as a venomous light flashed across his eyes.

“Then what does Teacher Di Nuo propose?” Ye Qing asked.

Di Nuo said, “If you lose, you need to fulfill the first two things you mentioned. Apart from that, I want you to crawl out of the Netherworld Academy in front of everyone. This is to show the world that not just anyone can enter our academy.”

Wen Qi and Luo Sheng both frowned at Di Nuo’s suggestion.

But Ye Qing immediately agreed.

Di Nuo looked at Ye Qingtang with a smug expression. He turned to Wen Qi. “Vice-President, please bear witness. In case someone decides to go back on his word after losing. Can I also borrow a pen and a piece of paper, please?”

Wen Qi shot Ye Qing a conflicted look before nodding.

Almost immediately, Di Nuo wrote out two copies of the betting terms. He waited for Ye Qing to add his thumbprint.

“Hold on.” Ye Qingtang looked at Di Nuo, who was just desperate to drag her down into the mud.

“What? Ye Qing, are you regretting things now?” Di Nuo asked.

Ye Qing shook his head. “Of course not. But we have yet to conclude all the terms of the bet between you and me.”

Di Nuo frowned slightly.

Earlier, Ye Qing had just talked about what would happen if he lost. He had not mentioned what would happen if he won, and Di Nuo had already eagerly agreed.

In his opinion, there was no way Ye Qing would win.

“Go on, what would happen if you win?” Di Nuo asked impatiently.

“I don’t have any special request. If I win, I will just do unto Teacher Di Nuo what you want from me. You will crawl out of the Netherworld Academy in front of everyone.”

Di Nuo’s face instantly darkened. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ye Qing! How dare you want to try and degrade me like this!”

Ye Qing looked calmly at Di Nuo.

“Degrade? But Teacher Di Nuo, you are the one who made this suggestion. Why? I have the guts to undertake this risk, but Teacher Di Nuo… Are you afraid?”
