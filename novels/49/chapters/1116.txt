Chapter 1117 Wrath (1)

The Blood Moon Elder inspected the place for a moment and mumbled. “This sect should be Shenchao Sect… It is one of the super sects in the north…”

Currently, more than half of the Shen Chao Sect disciples were killed, and the majority of the senior executives died in the battle. The Sect Master and Grand Elder were still fighting with their lives.

Numerous black-robed middle-aged people with a “You” stitched on their sleeves seemed to be killing the Shenchao Sect people in an overpowering manner. “Submit to You Ancient Clan and you’ll live. Resist You Ancient Clan and you’ll die.”

One of the black-robed men said in a low voice as he scanned the surroundings with eyes devoid of emotion.

“Grand Elder… Sect Master… save me…” “Help… No…” Some You Ancient Clan disciples used violent means to rip the clothes of the Shenchao Sect female disciples and smiled lustfully.

“Are you all… still human? How dare you all permit those young ones to do such atrocious things!” An elderly from Shenchao Sect yelled furiously upon seeing the scene, and a vein popped up on his forehead. “Oh?”

One of the black-robed men said with an indifferent expression, “Kindness is for humans. Lowly ants of this mainland like you all are not considered humans to us. It is a blessing of your female disciples to be able to relieve the stress of my You Ancient Clan disciples.”

“Father… save me… save me!”

One of the Shenchao Sect female disciples’ clothes were torn apart, and her fair skin was exposed. She shivered in the face of the brute gaze of the You Ancient Clan disciple before her as she desperately shouted to one of the sect elders in despair.

“Bastards, let go of my daughter!”

That Shenchao Sect elder hollered furiously and unsheathed his sword before slashing down at the You Ancient Clan disciples swiftly.

“Old thing, you’re courting death!”

Noticing the situation, the You Ancient Clan disciple scoffed and stuck a palm out as he spoke.

Puff!

The air pressure from that strike instantly beheaded that Shenchao Sect elder.

“Father!!”

The female disciple whose clothes were ripped apart was dumbstruck, and she screamed in grief.

“These bastards… Even if I die, I will not let you all have your way!!” The female disciple’s face was as white as a sheet, and she bit her tongue instantly.

Then, her complexion turned ghastly white, and blood seeped out from the corner of her lips. She collapsed on the ground instantly.

That You Ancient Clan disciple scoffed at the situation. “What a damn spoil of fun!”

Afterward, he stuck his leg out and kicked that Shenchao Sect female disciple’s body dozens of meters away, forming an arc in the air before crashing into a pillar within the sect, which shattered into pieces. Looking at the female disciple’s body again, it was already dismembered to pieces.

“Ah…”

The Shenchao Sect disciples were in great despair after witnessing the sight. The skills of these people were too scary. While Shenchao Sect was a super sect, they almost had no ability to retaliate in the face of these You Ancient Clan figures.

“You bastards…”

Shenchao Sect Master clenched his fists tightly and gritted his teeth but was extremely powerless.

“You don’t know how to appreciate favors,” one of the You Ancient Clan black-robed elderlies said coldly. “Kill all the men in this sect and bring the females away.” The black-robed elderly ordered immediately. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The You Ancient Clan disciples at the scene howled excitedly upon hearing that.

“No… Please…”

“Don’t touch me… Don’t touch me!!”
