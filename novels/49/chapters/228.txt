Wu Zheng looked down and spoke a while later. “She went to look at the situation in the mountain village and went to the back of the mountain afterward.”

“Back of the mountain?” The Apothecary stopped whatever he was doing and turned around immediately. His eyes, which seemed to have been through the vicissitudes of life, sharpened. “The night is misty, and the back of the mountain is all steep slopes and cliffs. Lord Ye is young and should be more careful. You must pay attention and not let her be injured.”

Wu Zheng narrowed her eyes and did not reply.

The Apothecary wiped clean his hands and looked at Wu Zheng’s side profile. The expression in the Apothecary’s eyes changed for a moment as he casually sat down at a side and took a sip of tea.

“Perhaps, I was overly worried. Lord Ye is a sect disciple and is obviously different from us. With her skills, she would not be injured. Why would a noble sect disciple need us, ordinary people, to worry for them? Rather, it is us who would become their burdens in times of danger…”

A rather husky voice with unclear meanings traveled into Wu Zheng’s ears.

The moment Wu Zheng heard the word “burdens,” his fists on the table were suddenly clenched, and he lowered his head even further.

“Lord Ye saw the inscription on the tablet at the cliff…”

The Apothecary’s eyes changed and turned hazy for a moment.

“Oh? Did she say anything?”

Wu Zheng replied. “That tablet had already been so broken, and the sky is dark. How can she see anything?”

The Apothecary leaned back in his chair and narrowed his eyes. After a sigh, he said bafflingly, “Yeah, it is already dark. Even if something happens… no one would know.”

Wu Zheng’s shoulder stiffened while the Apothecary stood up and walked out straight.

…

In the pavilion, Ye Qingtang knocked on Lin Long’s door after washing up a little.

Lin Long was a little surprised to see Ye Qingtang but let her in without saying anything.

“How do you feel, Senior Sister Lin?” Ye Qingtang asked after entering the room.

Lin Long looked at the glaring blood spots on her arm and said calmly, “Nothing unusual.”

Ye Qingtang slowly sighed in relief. She did not know much about this Blood Plague. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Senior Sister Lin, why were you appointed here with Zhou Xuan?” Ye Qingtang asked with a faked casual tone. She already had a guess in her heart, but there was a fatal loophole.

Lin Long did not know why Ye Qingtang suddenly asked of this but replied regardless. “This mission was instigated by Zhou Xuan. Zhou Xuan and I did our mission at the same time previously, and according to the calculation, there will only be new sect missions appointed at least half a month later. However, Zhou Xuan suddenly requested to accept a sect mission in advance. Thus, this Spirit Condensation Mountain Village mission was appointed to us.”

Sect missions were appointed at regular time intervals. Zhou Xuan accepted a new mission half a month in advance, and subsequently, Lin Long, who completed the previous mission the same time as him, was dragged into this new mission as well.

The moment Lin Long finished her sentence, Ye Qingtang suddenly stood up, and a cold light flashed across her eyes.

She finally found the reason for the loophole in her guess!

If it was really what she guessed, all the Xuanling Sect disciples in this mission would definitely die without a doubt.

But in her previous life…

It was already years after the current year when she entered the sect. And at that time, regardless of Zhou Xuan or Lin Long, both were still well and alive in the sect.

Ye Qingtang could not understand that but now…

Everything flowed!
