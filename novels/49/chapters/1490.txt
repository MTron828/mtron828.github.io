Chapter 1491 Worsening Matters 3

Everyone’s goal was the same this time. Everyone—regardless of whether they were a part of the demon kings, alien races including the Temple of Shadows, the Ancient You Clan, or the Jiang Family—was here to seize the Great Demon.

And at this instant, everyone present seemed to have a certain tacit understanding; there was no intention to attack others, and everyone was merely on their guard against each other.

Bai Lixi scoffed but did not take further action. It was clear that while he was young, he knew that it was not the right time to settle scores with the Ancient You Clan. His eyes swept across the surroundings, and he snickered. “Since we have the same goal, isn’t it time for the friends hidden in the dark to appear?”

Everyone was dumbfounded by what Bai Lixi said. Nonetheless, the Jiang Family and Ancient You Clan had a calm composure.

Moments later, several figures suddenly darted across the sky and appeared before everyone.

From a corner, Ye Qingtang looked up at those figures in the sky and was taken aback.

She actually spotted a familiar figure among those people.

There was a pretty lady who had a hint of impatience on her pale complexion. She stood behind an elderly with a frown, though she disregarded everyone at the scene with plain arrogance.

“It’s her...” Ye Qingtang was surprised to see that lady in green.

Wasn’t that lady none other than the lady in green whose Mutated Heavenly Demon Bloodline was counter-absorbed by Ye Qingtang at the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix back then?

She’d actually appear here?

Ye Qingtang’s eyes twitched uncontrollably, and her head began aching.

First, the Temple of Shadows. Now, even this lady in green appeared. What kind of play is this?

However, Ye Qingtang very quickly realized that something was off about the situation.

Ling Yan told her that the lady in green went to the Second Domain when young, yet that lady appeared with a group of people here...

Ye Qingtang instinctively looked towards the people beside the lady in green. After a glance, she shockingly discovered that those people were all above the Holy Venerate realm... Moreover, their faces were very foreign to Ye Qingtang. If they were powerful figures from the Central Mainland, there would definitely be one or two familiar faces, but all of them were more than foreign.

Could they be... from the Second Domain?

“So it’s people from the Second Domain” Bai Lixi’s lips curled into a snicker when he saw the lady in green.

The Great Demon even attracted people from the Second Domain. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The powerful figures from the Second Domain smiled briefly without uttering a word as they stood in the air, merely casting an arrogant glance that spelled belittlement.

The corpse of the Frosty Snow Mountains’ Great Demon was already found, but with so many forces gathered here, the ownership of the Great Demon would definitely be a problem.

At this instant, the ten demon kings gathered together and their size was already a shuddering sight. Standing between the masses and the Great Demon, their huge bodies formed a tall wall as an extremely obscure demon language filled the air.

Moments later, the Cyclops Demon King suddenly stood forward, and its fierce eye glanced across the masses before it spoke slowly in the rather unfamiliar human language,

“This Great Demon is of our race, and its death has nothing to do with you all. Please leave immediately.”
