Chapter 2274: Black Snake (1)

The enraged black snake, which had been toying around with those intruders before killing them, had now lost all patience. The moment its massive body emerged, all living beings inside the treasure trove were immediately crushed into meat pulp.

No one even had the chance to struggle. There was no hope for survival at all. The moment they stepped into the treasure trove and took a treasure, they had been condemned to death.

After all, they were already standing on the body of that monster.

As the black snake pulverized everyone, its blood-red eyes were fixated upon Ye Qingtang at the demon tree.

Sh*t.

This was bad!

Ye Qingtang’s heart leaped. It was too late to let go now. Stuffing the Evil Fruit into her space ring, she pelted towards the tunnel at the back.

“Roar!”

The black snake erupted like a wild beast.

Cold sweat drenched Ye Qingtang’s back.

She had initially found it very strange. Those fleeing men could split up in different directions so that at least some would have the chance to escape while the black shadow was busy with the others.

But now after witnessing the body of that black snake, Ye Qingtang finally understood the reason.

Everyone had underestimated the size of that black snake…

It was everywhere.

Ye Qingtang felt like throwing up blood. If she had known that snake was so big, she wouldn’t have taken such a huge risk.

The various factions had touched the treasures in this treasure trove, which triggered the murderous pursuit by that black snake. But the black snake had revealed its entire body only after Ye Qingtang picked that Evil Fruit…

It was clear that the treasures growing on that demon tree were far more valuable than any of the other things in that treasure trove.

Ye Qingtang was already fleeing as fast as she could. But that black snake moved at an astounding speed. In the blink of an eye, it was already right behind Ye Qingtang.

Heart leaping out of her throat, Ye Qingtang instinctively thought of using the Night Soul Beast to block.

But the Night Soul Beast by her side also looked extremely terrified. As if it was also very frightened of that black snake.

What was going on?

Weren’t the Night Soul Beast and that black snake both guardians of the fiendcelestial’s tomb?

Why…

Would the Night Soul Beast also be attacked by the black snake?

Ye Qingtang could not confirm but had no time to dally. Gritting her teeth, she dashed with all her might toward the tunnel.

There was no time to bother about anything else.

She could only try her best to flee.

Going by her memory, Ye Qingtang charged straight into the hibernation area of the Night Soul Beasts.

Previously, those Night Soul Beasts had been in hibernation, but perhaps they were now awake and hanging around the cave.

Dashing into the cave, Ye Qingtang saw the densely-packed crowd of Night Soul Beasts. They looked like they were still sleeping, sprawled together in one tightly-packed herd.

Whether she would live or die, it would be determined by this gamble! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang could already feel the breath of the black snake on her back. Slamming her eyes shut, she pounced toward the herd of slumbering Night Soul Beasts.

The Night Soul Beast with Ye Qingtang had wanted to make use of the black snake to get rid of this human. But its face completely fell when it saw Ye Qingtang luring that snake into the Night Soul Beasts’ lair.

What was this human trying to do!!!

The Night Soul Beast was about to go insane!

Although the Night Soul Beasts and black snake were both guardians of the tomb, they were from entirely different races and stood guard over different areas.
