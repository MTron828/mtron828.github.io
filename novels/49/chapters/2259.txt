Chapter 2260: Treasure Trove (1)

There was a massive tunnel where the glowing light seemed to emanate from. Ye Qingtang could see it now.

Sparking precious jewels were embedded on the two sides of the tunnel. The river water appeared to be sealed off from the tunnel, unable to seep in at all.

On and on Ye Qingtang surged forward as she led Lei Yan and the others straight into the tunnel. Drenched from swimming in the river, all the water dripping off their bodies immediately evaporated once they entered the tunnel.

It was only then that Ye Qingtang woke them up. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The teenagers realized that they had somehow arrived at a tunnel. Turning around, they saw countless undead mermaids swimming in the water behind them.

“Boss, you really managed to bring us all here!” Nangong Lie stared at Ye Qing in amazement.

“Let’s take a look at Ziying first,” Ye Qing said.

Yun Chen put down the unconscious Mu Ziying. Although she was covered in bruises, none of them appeared to be critical. However, her face was rather pale.

Ye Qingtang fed her an elixir and in the blink of an eye, Mu Ziying woke up.

Right before she opened her eyes, her brows wrinkled instinctively. But after lifting her lids and seeing those familiar faces before her, Mu Ziying was completely dumbstruck.

“Bos… Boss?”

Hadn’t she been captured by those Rising Dragon Island men?

What had happened…

“Surprised? Haha… Little Senior Sister, you didn’t expect this right? We all came to save you.” Lei Yan grinned.

Still in a daze, Mu Ziying noticed Ye Qing and averted her gaze slightly.

Lei Yan and Nangong Lie told her all about how they merged into the crowd, how Ye Qing deceived all the major factions, and so they had managed to save her.

Hearing all that with a trembling heart, Mu Ziying desperately wished to bury her head in her chest.

“I have been a burden to everyone…”

As young as Mu Ziying was, even she knew that it would not be that easy to leave this fiendcelestial’s tomb. Ye Qing and the others had taken the risk to come into this dangerous place, all because of her.

A warm hand suddenly landed on top of Mu Ziying’s head. As Mu Ziying lifted her head, she looked into Ye Qing’s smiling eyes.

“Can you walk?” Ye Qing asked.

Mu Ziying was taken aback. She nodded in bewilderment.

“We cannot linger here. If you are tired, have them carry you.” Ye Qing spoke in a mild voice.

The Rising Dragon Island matter was an accident. She would not blame anyone for this kind of accident.

Mu Ziying nodded silently, before following Ye Qingtang.

“Boss, this tunnel looks much brighter than the other areas of the tomb. Does this mean we can leave soon?” Lei Yan asked eagerly.

He really didn’t wish to stay here a second longer. Who knew how many more terrifying things existed here.

Ye Qingtang didn’t reply. In her previous life, there was a lot of information about the fiendcelestial’s tomb, but also a lot of different versions. Someone once said that there was more than one tunnel in the depths of the boundless river. Even Ye Qingtang could not be sure where they were now.

Seeing that Ye Qing had remained silent, the others also obediently kept quiet. They remembered clearly what happened at the Matrix Path earlier. Who knew what would happen in this tomb?

The glowing tunnel seemed to have no end. Having gotten to this point, Ye Qingtang had no choice but to continue leading the group forward.
