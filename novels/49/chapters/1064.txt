Chapter 1065 Mirror of Illusions (1)

A blood-colored light suddenly gushed out of the scarlet ancient mirror in the Beiming Manor elderly’s hand as though it was an everlasting aurora. Without giving Ye Qingtang any time to react, it instantly enshrouded Ye Qingtang in it.

Sensing the aura of this blood-colored light, Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

This scarlet ancient mirror was a Dharma treasure exclusive to Yang Lords. Its level was extremely high, and only Yang Lords and those above the Yang Lord realm could control and use it.

“Hahaha, little girl, this mirror is the Captive Sky Mirror. Even a Yang Lord will lose control of their body movement once they are caught in this mirror…” The Beiming Manor elderly who held the ancient mirror snickered as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who was sealed within the ancient mirror.

No matter how powerful a Yang Lord was, if they were unable to move and faced two other Yang Lords who were set out to kill, the only outcome was death.

Ye Qingtang immediately activated the powers of the Heavenly Demon bloodline and executed the Heavenly Demon devouring bloodline in the fastest time possible.

The devouring bloodline could devour everything in this world, including mental energy and physical energy!

No matter what energy this Dharma treasure made use of, it was unable to withstand the strength of the Heavenly Demon devouring bloodline.

As the devouring powers were executed, the blood-colored light from the ancient mirror was completely swallowed by Ye Qingtang’s Heavenly Demon devouring bloodline in no time.

Moreover, Ye Qingtang could clearly feel that the power in her body seemed to have increased a little, probably from devouring the ancient mirror energy earlier on. Although it was not obvious, she could still feel it.

“This is?!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Noticing the situation, the two Beiming Manor elderlies were dumbstruck and could not comprehend the situation.

“This little girl must have a similar Dharma treasure to counter it…” The elderly with the scarlet ancient mirror mumbled with a frown.

Both Beiming Manor elderlies did not have much knowledge about the Heavenly Demon bloodline and thus were oblivious that Ye Qingtang used the Heavenly Demon devouring bloodline earlier on.

A battle among Yang Lords was not simple and took up a lot of time. As such, both Yang Lords originally wanted to use the Dharma treasure to end the battle quickly, but they never thought that the Captive Sky Mirror would have no effect on Ye Qingtang.

“Humph. Since that’s the case, we will join forces… and use the Secret Sound Sky Spirit Technique to kill this girl!” The Beiming Manor elderly said.

“That’s the only way.” The other elderly nodded and immediately stored his scarlet ancient mirror.Then, both of them used their palms to form a print, and a massive primordial qi and mental energy instantly erupted.

The Secret Sound Sky Spirit Technique was one of the divine techniques of Beiming Manor. However, the conditions for executing this technique were extremely harsh and required Yang Lords of at least Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven to join forces in order for the technique to have an invincible might.

It was difficult for even Ye Qingtang to defend against such a divine technique. The Secret Sound Sky Spirit Technique mainly attacked one’s mental state and was not considered a physical attack; thus, there was no way to defend against it. This was also the frightening aspect of the technique.

In an instant, an unusual sound that resembled a howl from hell rang around Ye Qingtang and caused goosebumps.

“It is not only your Beiming Manor that has Dharma treasures.”

Without hesitation, Ye Qingtang immediately retrieved an even plainer ancient mirror from her space ring

This ancient mirror was the Mirror of Illusions. It could only be used by the Phoenix Bloodline and would materialize all attacking forces.

Ye Qingtang obtained this Mirror of Illusions in the Dragon Vein as a gift from the Divine Phoenix after obtaining the Divine Phoenix inheritance.
