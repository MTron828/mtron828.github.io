Chapter 1294: Engagement (2)

“Elder Brother Yan, I have already completed my studies and will remain in the capital for now. In the future, we can see each other every day.” Mo Yunxian only had eyes for Ling Yan.

Ling Yan did not say anything. He only smiled.

Why are you smiling? Do you think you look good when you smile?

Stupid fox.

Ye Qingtang muttered to herself.

The Eternal Emperor was all smiles when he saw the “intimacy” between Mo Yunxian and Ling Yan.

“Yan’er, you and Yunxian have known each other for a long time and have been engaged for many years. You are no longer young and should be considering your marriage,” the Eternal Emperor said with a smile.

Mo Yunxian’s eyes were filled with anticipation.

Ling Yan smiled and said, “There must be order in the family. My older royal brothers and sisters have not yet married, so I am not in a hurry either.”

The Eternal Emperor only smiled and shook his head.

“There is no need for such considerations. You are younger, but if you became the Crown Prince, there your birth order would not matter.”

Everyone’s expression changed at the Eternal Emperor’s casual words. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“What’s going on… What does our Royal Father mean?” The Eldest Princess was startled and involuntarily whispered to the Eldest Prince.

The Eldest Prince also looked shocked, but he quickly steadied himself.

“Perhaps it is only a joke. Let’s see what our Royal Father says next.”

The Eldest Princess frowned slightly but also calmed down.

The Second Princess’s composure showed signs of cracking. Her gaze swept over Ling Yan, and her eyes grew sharp.

But the Eternal Emperor seemed to be completely unconscious of the undercurrents. He said, “It is best to have two joyous occasions together. Yan’er, you are the most intelligent of my children, and I have great expectations of you. So I have decided that from tomorrow onward, you will be the Crown Prince of the Eternal Dynasty.”

The Eternal Emperor’s words shocked everyone.

No one would have thought that… the Eternal Emperor would make Ling Yan the Crown Prince at today’s banquet!

“Royal Father, thank you for your favor. I will certainly not disappoint you. I will do my utmost to shoulder my duties as a Crown Prince.” Ling Yan smiled and seemed completely unsurprised by this outcome. It was as if he had anticipated everything. He slowly rose and went forward to make his obeisance to the Eternal Emperor.

At that moment, the Eldest Prince could no longer maintain his mild expression. He glared at Ling Yan with a vicious look in his eyes.

The Second Princess grew even chillier as if her gaze was frozen.

The entire atmosphere in the main hall grew strange.

However, many senior ministers nodded. They also favored the Third Prince, Ling Yan. After all, there was almost no one who could compare to Ling Yan in terms of intelligence.

With such capability and intelligence, he was the best choice for heir.

“How could it be him!” The Elder Princess twisted the corner of her robe until it almost tore. She ground her teeth as she glared at Ling Yan. She regretted not killing Ling Yan when he was in the dungeon.

This development was completely unexpected.

Today, both the Eldest Prince and the Second Princess felt that they were the likeliest ones to seize the throne.

Who knew…

Ling Yan had gotten ahead of them.

“This is the golden seal of the Crown Prince. Keep it carefully. Your Fourth Royal Brother departed recently, and I have no wish to involve too many people. You only need to know that from the moment you receive this golden seal, you are the heir of the Eternal Dynasty.” The Eternal Emperor personally handed the golden seal to Ling Yan. He beamed as he looked at this incredibly brilliant son.
