Chapter 1195: Occupied (3)

“General, it is we… who should thank you!” Daoist Zijin looked at Ye Qingtang with a complicated expression. “General, with your powers, you could easily leave this mainland… but you have chosen to remain… with us…”

This mainland had raised them. No one was willing to leave. They were all willing to live or die together with this mainland that had raised them.

But Ye Qingtang was still so young. She could leave this mainland and wait for her powers to exceed that of the Ancient You Clan before taking revenge on them.

But, Ye Qingtang had also chosen to stay and to live and die with them…

How noble of her…

“Reporting! The main force of the Ancient You Clan is less than twenty miles away!” Another scout swiftly reported.

Ye Qingtang remained silent for a moment. Then, with her eyes glittering with cold light, she said, “Meet them in battle!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Everyone shouted in unison.

The first battle to determine the survival of this mainland was about to commence.

This battle was later recorded in history books. Thousands of years later, whenever people discussed it, they would be filled with the deepest respect for these heroes who were not afraid to die in battle, for the immortal souls, and for this solemn and stirring moment that moved them to both song and tears…

…

At that moment, everyone had arrived at the top of the wall. Thousands of powerful cultivators had gathered from all over the south to hold the last line of defense. They raised their longbows, drew their arrows, and aimed beyond the city.

Boom…

Boom…

Boom!

The entire earth quickly started to shake as if a natural disaster was imminent. Dust floated in the void, sketching the outline of the battlefield. The air was filled with the distinctive scent of blood.

No one knew what to expect.

Death did not seem frightening at this point.

A moment later, the main force of the You Clan in the south descended on the lone city.

A green-robed man stood on top of a huge demonic beast. He swept a glance at the crowd on the city walls of Heaven City.

Behind him stood thousands of powerful cultivators from the Ancient You Clan and a few of the super sect forces which had surrendered earlier on the southern battlefield.

“The southern headquarters has been breached. Your general is dead. If you surrender, your lives will be spared,” After a moment, the green-robed man, You Tong said slowly.

“Kill! Kill! Kill!” However, a roar of defiance arose in response to General You Tong.

In Heaven City, battle flags flew, and battle drums rang out.

“Release!”

Elder Bai Kui waved his right arm and shouted sharply.

At Elder Bai Kui’s command, countless arrows flew with incredible speed. They were so numerous that they fell like rain on the main force of the Ancient You Clan below them.

These bows and arrows were specially constructed, and most of them were almost black-grade quality. The arrows were coated with either the destructive power of elemental fire or the power of frost. They were terrifying.

Boom!

The moment the arrows fell, towering flames shot skywards and exploded in the void.

Many of the powerful cultivators from the ancient clan were caught off-guard and retreated with injuries. Many of the super sect powers in the south, who had yielded to the Ancient You Clan, were immediately killed by the explosion or were pierced through.

Ye Qingtang had prepared for this battle for a long time. These bows and arrows were mostly constructed of ancient meteoric iron, and some of them even surpassed the power of ordinary black-grade divine weapons!

Although the Ancient You Clan was powerful, this mainland greatly restricted their powers. It was impossible for them to avoid being injured by the arrows. Even those southern super sect powers who had surrendered to the Ancient You Clan were hard-pressed to withstand them.

“Release!”
