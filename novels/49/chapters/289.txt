When Lu Xiuwen saw the Blood Moon Sect Elder who became Zhou Qu, a hint of laughter emerged in his eyes.

This Ye Qingtang was really an idiot. Everyone knew about the enmity between Zhou Qu and Ye Qingtang. Plus, Zhou Qu obviously had an intention of cozying up to him on the arena previously. Calling Zhou Qu up right now would probably just be more of a hindrance than help.

Then, Lu Xiuwen secretly sighed and said to the Blood Moon Sect Elder, “It would be even better if Senior Brother Zhou was present. Please clear my name, Senior Brother Zhou.”

Under Ye Qingtang’s threatening eyes, the Blood Moon Sect Elder nodded with a smile and said with an expression which read ‘absolutely,’ “No problem. Don’t worry, Junior Brother Lu. I will definitely say the truth in all honesty.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lu Xiuwen nodded in satisfaction and glanced at Ye Qingtang with a cold laugh in his eyes.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder walked up to the warden and said, “Warden, I have something to report.”

“Say.” The Warden uttered.

After taking a look at the sword, the Blood Moon Sect Elder turned to look at Lu Xiuwen, who secretly gave him a nod. “I indeed witnessed Junior Sister Ye picking this sword up in the area near Beiyue Mountains.”

Lu Xiuwen’s expression immediately fell after hearing what the Blood Moon Sect Elder said.

Then, the Blood Moon Sect Elder continued. “I also saw Junior Brother Lu using this sword before.”

Lu Xiuwen’s expression darkened instantly, and he frowned. “Senior Brother Zhou, don’t speak carelessly.” Then, he cast a threatening look to the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was simply unaffected. “I am not speaking carelessly. I did see you holding this sword before.”

Lu Xiuwen’s expression turned ugly.

On the other hand, Ye Qingtang deliberately looked at Lu Xiuwen in surprise. “This sword really belongs to Senior Brother Lu? But… the blood stain on this sword…”

The warden’s expression changed, and he immediately summoned someone to compare the blood stain on that sword and Yun Shu’s blood. The results shocked everyone: the two blood samples were completely the same, and evidently, the blood on the sword belonged to Yun Shu!

When the results were revealed, Lu Xiuwen’s expression became extremely ugly. He did attack Yun Shu, but he did not use that sword at all. He clearly placed that sword in his room all this while and had never used it, but why was it that it was in Ye Qingtang’s hands now?

Lu Xiuwen really fell into a dire situation as his own sword was stained with Yun Shu’s blood. Then, he said, “This sword is indeed mine. However, I already lost it one month ago, so I am really unaware of this matter.”

“Unaware?” Ye Qingtang suddenly laughed. She narrowed her eyes at Lu Xiuwen, who was trying hard to wash his hands off everything. “That is really unusual then. Senior Brother Lu, your sword is stained with Senior Brother Yun’s blood, and Senior Brother Yun said that he was injured by you… I’m afraid there’s something hidden in this matter.”

Lu Xiuwen glimpsed at Ye Qingtang and could not help but curse internally, though he did not show any expression on his face.

“All the disciples who went on the mission can testify for me that I did not bring this sword when I went out on the mission.”

The Warden then interrogated other disciples, and the outcome was the same as what Lu Xiuwen said.

Even Yun Shu could not help but frown as well. He was injured by Lu Xiuwen’s sword, but it was completely not the one that Ye Qingtang handed to the Warden. However, at that moment, Yun Shu was not foolish enough to speak up for Lu Xiuwen.
