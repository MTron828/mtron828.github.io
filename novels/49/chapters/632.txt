Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I’m not blind.” Ye Qingtang shot a look at the Blood Moon Elder. The smell of blood at the place was so intense, and there were evil spirits everyone. Anyone would have felt that there was something odd about this place.

Currently, Ye Qingtang had already returned to her female appearance. Her identity was already revealed by the black-robed person, and there was no point to continue disguising herself.

Before long, there were sounds of battle from ahead.

The Blood Moon Elder and Ye Qingtang walked forward in large strides, wanting to know what happened.

However, after walking a few steps, a shadow crashed on the Blood Moon Elder instantly.

“It’s you?!” The Blood Moon Elder was a little shocked to see the pale young man in front of him.

This young boy was the person whose body he wanted to possess back then. However, he was ultimately saved by Ye Qingtang, and the Blood Moon Elder did not get his way…

Looking at the body of this young boy and then at his current body… the Blood Moon Elder realized that he still wished to be a child… 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Shen Qingyu?” Ye Qingtang was shocked when she saw the young boy.

“You are…” When Shen Qingyu looked at Ye Qingtang, his pale face was suddenly agitated. “You are… sister Qingtang!”

It had been long since she saw Shen Qingyu, and he had grown taller.

“What happened?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Sister Qingtang… I followed my sect to this mystic realm. Everyone was dispersed, so some senior brothers and sisters and I are looking around for the sect’s elders… However, we entered here by accident… More than half of… my senior brothers and sisters have died…” Shen Qingyu’s eyes were slightly foggy.

Although Shen Qingyu was not old, as a super genius of Wind Moon Sect who had been specially trained by the sect, he had entered many mystic realms before. However, it was the first time he entered a Hundred Level Peril mystic realm. He never knew that a mystic realm could be this scary!

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything again, when they stepped on the ground, a few decomposed hands that were leaking with blood suddenly stretched out from the ground.

“Arh!”

Shen Qingyu screamed in shock as both his legs were grabbed.

A massive force pulled Shen Qingyu downwards.

“Sister Qingtang… Save me…”

Horror and anxiety filled Shen Qingyu’s face. Many of his senior brothers and sisters were pulled into the ground by these ghost hands!

Clank!

With a crisp sound, the Demonic Blood Sword appeared in Ye Qingtang’s hand, and a blood-colored sword glint appeared with a wave.

Swoosh!

The ghost hand that grabbed Shen Qingyu was chopped by the sword glint.

As though it felt pain, the pair of decomposed hands released its grip slightly, and Ye Qingtang took this opportunity to pull the panic-stricken young boy over.

“Holy Lady, let it come at me!” Suddenly, the Blood Moon Elder’s eyes flickered, and a black fog emerged at his glabella.

In the next second, those ghost hands turned into blood water rapidly and were rapidly absorbed by the black mist at the Blood Moon Elder’s glabella.

“Hahaha. The demonic techniques that this lady cultivated are pretty good…” The Blood Moon Elder was glowing with health and was extremely satisfied.

Ouyang Qian’s demonic techniques could absorb the spirits of the dead to increase her skills, which currently benefited the Blood Moon Elder.

After absorbing all the spirits of the dead, the Blood Moon Elder’s skills increased further and faintly had a trace of breaking through to Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two.

“However, I can feel that there is an even stronger presence here. The deeper we go, the more dangerous it is…” The Blood Moon Elder had a serious expression.

Ye Qingtang could not help but be in deep thought.

“F*ck… Scared me to death!” The little white tiger crawled into Ye Qingtang’s arms.
