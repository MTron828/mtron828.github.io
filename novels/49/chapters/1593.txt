Chapter 1594 Brutal Little Fellow 1

“Who... is that?” General Mark widened his eyes in shock. That girl isn’t wielding any weapon, yet she can slaughter strong soldiers so easily? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Her simple and light movements made it seem as effortless as plucking a flower.

“Let’s not care who she is first. Brothers, let’s kill! Let’s kill this group of bastards when they’re in chaos!” As though he was inspired by the girl’s aggressive murderous intent, General Mark shouted loudly and led his remaining guards to counter-attack fiercely.

The allied forces, which originally held an absolute advantage, seemed to be in hell right now. They launched the first wave of attack with five times the amount of soldiers and originally thought they could easily eliminate the guards in this city. Yet, just as they were going to drive the guards to death, a devil-like girl suddenly appeared on their battlefield, and her fair hand was like the scythe of the god of death, reaping all their souls...

There was a huge outburst of chaos among the allied forces as their troops were forced to retreat by that girl. However, when they finally pulled some distance away from the guards,

That was the true arrival of a nightmare...

Mark was about to continue pursuing them, but he suddenly saw the girl leaping up and floating in the air with a huge black flame blazing behind her. In the next second, her slim fingers gently pointed at the allied forces, and endless black flames instantly turned into a massive dragon and lunged forward!

With a deafening roar, thousands of allied forces soldiers were engulfed by the black flame!

The two forces had finally separated; otherwise, she did not dare to use any powers.

Ye Qingtang sighed softly.

General Mark and the rest who witnessed this scene were completely dumbfounded as they watched the girl in the sky with their jaws hanging wide open.

“Go. Hurry, bring someone to check this lady’s identity!” There was a bright fire in General Mark’s eyes. That girl seemed to be only attacking the allied forces, and if she was part of the Supreme League Kingdom, they probably would be able to survive this war!

The allied forces had no choice but to retreat due to the black flame, and the guards cheered loudly at the sight.

General Mark immediately brought his injured soldiers to seek medical treatment while a group of guards were sent to contact the mysterious and formidable girl.

When Ye Qingtang came to the town, she only appeared near the bar, and only those hundred people there had seen her. These guards thus naturally did not recognize her.

“Friend, our general wishes to meet you,” a guard said.

Ye Qingtang nodded lightly and immediately followed the group of guards to General Mark’s base camp.

In the headquarters, General Mark had already taken off his armor and was being bandaged for his wounds. Upon receiving the soldiers’ report of Ye Qingtang’s arrival, Mark immediately told the medic to leave and stood up as a petite girl walked into his sight.

Previously, General Mark did not see the girl’s looks clearly, but seeing her now, he realized that she was even smaller than expected and seemed to be about the height of a fourteen-year-old child.

The more this was the case, the more surprised General Mike was over Ye Qingtang’s ferocity on the battlefield.
