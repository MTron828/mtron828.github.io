Chapter 2124: Even A Broken Clock Is Right Twice A Day (3)

The Fox Demon gave a start.

The Sea King’s words had revealed an important piece of information. If the Sea Clan’s divine item still belonged to the Temple of Paragon. Did this mean that...

Ye Qingtang had won?

The Fox Demon was shocked by this realization. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Did she even know what Sea Soul Chess was?

To think that she had won nonetheless?

“Oh yes, tell your Holy Lord that this Sea Soul Chess set is the last in the two domains. Today, I lost to her by one move and it will remain with her. But she must treat it well. I will challenge her again in the future.”

The eyes of the Fox Demon nearly popped out in astonishment.

Ye Qingtang defeated the Sea King?!

How in the world was that possible?!

“Yes, I will inform the Holy Lord of your message.” The Fox Demon maintained a calm and polite outward demeanor even as its heart was trembling from shock.

Meanwhile, the Temple of Paragon Elders was filled with all sorts of emotions.

The other leaders felt that it was just par for course whether the Sea King and the Holy Lord won the chess match. Only the Temple of Paragon Elders knew that the person inside the Sky Temple now was not the Holy Lord from that time...

This was probably the first time she had laid eyes on the Sea Soul Chess!

Having mentally prepared themselves for the loss of the Sea Clan’s divine item, the Elders felt very conflicted.

Shocked, yet delighted.

The Fox Demon had a servant hand the Sea Clan’s divine item to the Sea King, before going over to join the rest standing at the side, keeping watch over the tightly-closed temple door.

They wanted to enter the Sky Temple now and ask Ye Qingtang what the hell had happened. How did she manage to win? But with so many other people at present, they had no choice but to remain calm.

The Sea Clan’s divine item had to be reactivated in seawater. As a result, the Sea King brought the divine item into the waves and used his own power to cultivate over it.

Meanwhile, the rest of the crowd was in no hurry. Seeing that the doors remained shut, they started to take in the surrounding scenery.

In contrast, Elder Hua kept glancing at the temple door.

Could it be that Ye Qingtang had no idea how to open the temple door?

Or... had she been scared to death?

Or perhaps...

She had recovered some of her past life’s memories?

The more Elder Hua thought about it, the more excited she became, and couldn’t wait to dash into the temple.

After a long time, the Sea Clan’s divine item was successfully reactivated and returned to the Fox Demon. The Sea Clan then left with his people.

The Fox Demon ordered the servants to secure the divine item properly, before leading the rest to the temple doors, all prepared to open it and ask Ye Qingtang what happened.

Still, the other spectators had yet to leave. They were waiting to offer their well-wishes to the Holy Lord.

But when the Fox Demon and gang opened the temple doors, there was no one inside the large temple. There was just that Sea Soul Chess set left right in the middle of the temple.

As for Ye Qingtang...

She had already disappeared without a trace.

The Fox Demon’s face changed.

Where did she go?

The Fox Demon felt that something was not quite right. But as the other leaders were still present, it could not say anything. Instead, the Fox Demon had Elder Hua and the rest manage the affairs inside the temple, while he found an excuse to venture deeper into the temple to look for Ye Qingtang.

However...

Even though the Fox Demon searched the entire Sky Temple, it didn’t find any traces of Ye Qingtang. All it found was the wide-open back door of the temple, as well as a pile of the Holy Lord’s luxurious clothing. Clothes that Ye Qingtang should have been wearing.

“Where is she?” Elder Hua hurried over and saw the same sight.

“Gone.” The Fox Demon took a deep breath.

Elder Hua, “...”

When did she leave?!
