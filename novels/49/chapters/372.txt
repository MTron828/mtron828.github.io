Chapter 373: Life And Death Ring (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

A new disciple who just entered the sect for month challenged four people to fight on the Life and Death Ring. Was she trying to commit suicide?

Song Junqiu sneered. He realized that she was trying to take revenge for Ni Shang.

However…

Did she not know her own abilities?

How did she dare to be so arrogant?

She was going to commit suicide.

Fei Ying was stunned as well. He heard of the Life and Death Ring as he spent quite a long time in the inner sect. He hated these four people, but he did not expect Ye Qingtang to want to fight against them on the Life and Death Ring for Ni Shang.

Fei Ying was a little bewildered. He held Ye Qingtang’s sleeves, and he was very nervous.

“Miss…”

The Martial Qi Level One had four Heavens. Every Heaven consisted of three stages. They had been in the inner sect for a few years. The three disciples were at the second stage of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One, and Song Junqiu was at the third stage.

Ye Qingtang had only entered the inner sect for a month, and she just reached the First Heaven of the Martial Qi level One. She was at the first stage of the First Heaven. There was a great difference in ability between her and the three disciples and a greater difference with Song Junqiu.

With every stage difference of the Marital Qi, the difference of the ability was immense. It was suicide for Ye Qingtang to challenge the four people on the Life and Death Ring alone.

“I’m not joking. Do you dare to accept my challenge?” Ye Qingtang looked at the four people seriously.

They suddenly laughed.

“Of course we accept. Why not? Since you are so brave, we have to accept your challenge.” Song Junqiu smiled.

“Invite the warden over now. Since Junior Sister Ye has met the requirements, we must accept as her Senior Brothers,” Song Junqiu said to one of the disciples.

The disciple immediately invited the warden over.

The warden was surprised as he heard that Ye Qingtang wanted to challenge the four people at the same time on the Life and Death Ring.

“The five of you, are you sure about it?” The warden asked cautiously. He revealed a complex look as he turned towards Ye Qingtang.

The Life and Death Ring was a dangerous ring in the inner sect. There were some disciples who challenged others on the ring. But Ye Qingtang, as a new disciple, wanted to challenge four people at the same time?! What nonsense!

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied firmly.

“Then the five of you have to sign the Life and Death Agreement. Whether you live or die on the ring will depend on your destiny,” the warden said after seeing that his persuasion was not working.

The five of them did not object and signed the agreement in front of the warden.

Song Junqiu was the last to sign. He sneered as he saw Ye Qingtang’s name on the agreement.

He wanted to teach Ye Qingtang a lesson, but she was rushing to commit suicide. Even if they were to beat her to death on the ring, no one would say anything about them.

“The challenge will be ten days later. You shall go to the Life and Death Ring.” The warden kept away the agreement and left a reminder.

Song Junqiu stared at Ye Qingtang in an evil way after the warden left.

“Junior Sister Ye, I shall wait for you at the Life and Death Ring ten days later.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang narrow her eyes.

“Wait,” she suddenly said as Song Junqiu and the rest were about to leave.
