Chapter 1536 Clinging On 1

Of course, Ye Qingtang knew what Emperor Yan was thinking, but she feigned ignorance. After all, he was a revered and powerful man. Now, he was reduced to a child being carried by a junior; of course it would scar him.

After several trips, Ye Qingtang had carried most of the powerful figures out.

After leaving the forbidden land, the numerous Dharma treasures returned to normal. When the powerful figures saw this, they did not wish to stay in this hellish place a moment longer. They took out their Dharma treasures that enabled them to fly, and flew off into the void without a backward glance.

They might be a group of small children, but they had as many Dharma treasures as there were stars in the sky.

They did not wish too many people to see them in this state, so they hurriedly flew away from this hellish place. Their first priority was to find a place to cultivate.

Ye Qingtang watched the group of powerful figures leave before returning to the forbidden place.

Only Jiang Yu and You Qiong were left in the forbidden place.

Ye Qingtang reached out and picked them up while the little white tiger crouched on her shoulder. At the final moment, Ye Qingtang glanced at the three charmingly naive Demonic Bears. Amusement flashed across her eyes as she nodded to them in farewell.

The three Demonic Bear were oblivious but would not leave the forbidden place. When they saw Ye Qingtang leave, they shook their heads and went their own way.

Ye Qingtang took one last look at the forbidden place, and then brought You Qiong and Jiang Yu out.

Jiang Yu and You Qiong were filled with emotion when they returned to their past world. Jiang Yu could clearly sense his previous powers slowly recovering.

Although the speed of recovery was very slow, it filled him with joy.

It was good that he could recover his powers. It would be no easy task to re-cultivate ten thousand years’ worth of abilities.

Jiang Yu knew that he could not remain in the Land of Infinite Demons for much longer in his current state. Therefore, he asked Ye Qingtang to bring him away from this place and back to the Jiang Family as soon as possible.

So Ye Qingtang carried her “Domain Monarch Ancestor”, who stood only knee-high, and prepared to fly into the void...

But You Qiong, who had yet to move, pounced on Ye Qingtang and latched onto her leg.

“...” Ye Qingtang looked at the person who had been the Ancient You Clan’s most powerful elder ten thousand years ago.

“Let go.” Jiang Yu frowned slightly. He disliked the crafty You Qiong.

“No!” You Qiong’s little face looked stubborn. “Old Jiang, I cannot bear to leave you on account of our many years of friendship. Why don’t I follow you to the Jiang Family and stay there for a while?”

“Get lost!” Jiang Yu, who was in Ye Qingtang’s arms, impatiently stamped his small foot on You Qiong’s little face.

But You Qiong did not budge. He simply clung on even more tightly.

“Go back to your Ancient You Clan!” Jiang Yu said as he stamped on You Qiong’s face.

Stop being so shameless! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The elder of the Ancient You Clan actually wanted to follow me back to the Jiang Family?

“No... I really cannot bear to leave you!”

“If you don’t get lost, I’ll punch you!”

“I’m going back with you even if you punch me to death.”

As the previous Great Elder of the Ancient You Clan, no one understood better than You Qiong how the Ancient You Clan venerated powerful figures. When You Qiong was at the height of his power within the clan, even the family clan had to defer to him. The other elders were even more intimidated by him.

Everyone had been intimidated by You Qiong’s powers and so had treated him with great deference.

But now, You Qiong was just a two-or three-year-old child. He had yet to recover his powers. If he went back to the Ancient You Clan at this point, his old enemies would seize the opportunity to kill him.

Thus, You Qiong definitely did not dare to return to the Ancient You Clan at this point in time. He was worthless to the Ancient You Clan. If he returned, they would simply get rid of him.
