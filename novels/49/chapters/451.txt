“No… I will not lie to you!” Ye Qingtang shook her head extremely earnestly.

“Go!”

Yi Tianchou had Ye Qingtang walk at the front to lead the way.

He was not afraid that the girl before him would play any tricks. Given his Martial Qi Level Three realm, he would not be afraid at all even if Xuanling Sect elders were here. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ye Qingtang walked in front while “limping in pain,” and her movement was not fast.

About an hour later, Ye Qingtang brought Yi Tianchou to a spot in the mountain valley.

“The Spirit Life Flower is right there.” Ye Qingtang raised her hand and pointed ahead of them.

Yi Tianchou looked in the direction that Ye Qingtang pointed at. There was a huge rock hundreds of meters away, and there was indeed a Spirit Life Flower growing on the top of the huge rock!

“It really is the Spirit Life Flower!” Yi Tianchou was surprised.

Very quickly, his surprised expression turned into that of burning desire. If he could obtain the Spirit Life Flower, perhaps he could break through the bottleneck of his realm…

At that point, Yi Tianchou finally believed that this beauty never lied to him.

“Since you know there’s a Spirit Life Flower here, why don’t you get it yourself?” Yi Tianchou asked carefully. Although he desired the preciousness of the Spirit Life Flower, he was not a fool who advanced rashly.

If it were an ordinary sect disciple, he or she would definitely snatch it away the moment he or she saw this treasure. How would they leave the baby there without doing anything?

“Someone is guarding it, and he is very skilled.” Ye Qingtang sensed Yi Tianchou’s caution and immediately explained honestly.

Then, Yi Tianchou’s brows were furrowed slightly as he scanned the area in front of them once again.

Expectedly, a male around his thirties was guarding near the huge rock.

“It is merely a brat.” Yi Tianchou scoffed coldly and looked at Ye Qingtang. “You will follow behind me. Once I obtain the Spirit Life Flower, I’ll let you go. However, if you dare to play any tricks, I will let you be in utter misery…”

“Okay…” Ye Qingtang nodded repeatedly.

Looking at the beauty’s innocent appearance, Yi Tianchou snickered in his heart.

Regardless of whether he could obtain the Spirit Life Flower today, this beauty would never be able to escape from his hands!

At that moment, the Yunxiao Sect disciple who was guarding near the rock frowned and looked ahead.

He saw a man and a girl walking towards him together.

“Get lost!”

That Yunxiao Sect disciple shouted coldly as he displayed his imposing air instantly.

He was ordered by Senior Sister Ye You to guard the Spirit Life Flower here and not allow any living thing to come near it!

“Tsk tsk… Little chap, you’re asking me to get lost?!” Yi Tianchou looked at the Yunxiao Sect disciple and sneered.

“Yi Tianchou?” The Yunxiao Sect disciple was rather stunned after taking a clear look at the man’s face.

Yi Tianchou was ranked nine on the Assassination Roll, and he naturally saw a portrait of Yi Tianchou as a Yunxiao Sect disciple.

It was said that Yi Tianchou’s cultivation level was already at the perfected First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three and was only a half-step away from entering the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three.

However, in these five years, Yi Tianchou’s skills never advanced, and he had not made a breakthrough for a long time.

Despite so, the Yunxiao Sect disciple did not dare to let down his guard.

“Yi Tianchou, do you know that I’m a Yunxiao Sect disciple? If you know what’s the best for you, get lost from here quickly,” the Yunxiao Sect disciple commanded coldly.

“Yunxiao Sect disciple…” Yi Tianchou suddenly let out a loud laugh. “There are numerous female Yunxiao Sect disciples who were humiliated to death by me. It is said that when there are too many debts, one stops worrying about them. Could it be that you don’t understand this logic?”

“Yunxiao Sect disciple, hand this Spirit Life Flower to me and I’ll let you live. How about that?” Without waiting for the Yunxiao Sect disciple to say anything, Yi Tianchou spoke again.
