Chapter 736: Who Still Refuses To Accept This? (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In just a moment, the surrounding disciples were dumbfounded.

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples stood up, stumbling, and glared at Ye Qingtang with clenched teeth. “Ye Chen, just you wait!”

“I welcome you anytime.” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly.

Those Blue Cloud Peak disciple then left in a flurry.

They were merely ordinary disciples of the lowest-level in Blue Cloud Peak, and their skills were really nothing much. At most, they could only bully disciples like Sheng Qianyu who just entered the valley.

They were relying on the fact that Admirable Sky Peak disciples did not dare to brashly step forward to help free the victim from the predicament.

Unexpectedly, they met a tough cookie like Ye Qingtang today.

When they saw the Blue Cloud Peak disciples leaving, the onlooking disciples finally dispersed gradually, with an additional memory of Ye Qingtang, who just got in through the back door.

Sheng Qianyu looked at Ye Qingtang extremely gratefully. “Thank you, Senior Brother Ye. Thank you, Senior Brother Ye.” The White Sage which he lost and obtained once again was really important to him.

“We are all disciples of the same Master. There’s no need for thanks.” Ye Qingtang smiled and waved her hands.

Yin Qingluo looked at Ye Qingtang with a slight frown and a complicated gaze. This fellow who got in through the back door was not too unlikeable but…

This incident might not be over so easily.

After watching for a long time, Yan Shu eventually took a step forward and called for Ye Qingtang. “Junior Brother Ye.”

“Senior Brother Yan?” Ye Qingtang looked at Yan Shu. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You must be careful in the future. Since you are a disciple of our Master, you should take note of what you say and how you act from now on. Disciples from our peak must not stir trouble in the valley. Do you understand?” Yan Shu did not have much of an expression on his face. What Ye Qingtang did today was indeed satisfying, but it defied Perfected Xuanchen’s orders.

After those Blue Cloud Peak returned, they might still make some noise about it.

If not for the sake of the larger interest, either he or Yin Qingluo could easily finish those few people with middling skills.

Furthermore…

Ye Chen did enter through the back door, and this news would be circulated in various Falling Sky Valley’s peaks very quickly. His actions today would probably spark criticisms again.

If this implicated Master, it would be bad.

Although Yan Shu felt that Ye Qingtang’s actions were still alright, he also thought that he was too public about it. Such a person who became a disciple under the cautious Perfected Xuanchen with that method would really stir up quite some trouble.

Ye Qingtang naturally understood what Yan Shu meant.

Yan Shu had always obeyed Perfected Xuanchen’s orders. In Ye Qingtang’s previous life, when proposed to maintain the harmony among the peaks, Yan Shu executed it fully and only thought of protecting it in spite of suffering injustice.

Loyal as he was, he was too obstinate.

“I understand. I’ll take notice in the future.” Ye Qingtang nodded faintly. Anyway, even if she reasoned with Yan Shu over what was right, Yan Shu’s mind was probably too stubborn to agree with her, so she might as well save the saliva.

She had already reached Falling Sky Valley now, and whatever she wanted to do was up to her.

After seeing Ye Qingtang’s reflective attitude, Yan Shu did not say anything else and told Yin Qingluo beside him. “Junior Sister Yin, bring Junior Brother Sheng to check his injuries first.”

Those Blue Cloud Peak disciples did not spare any mercy in kicking Sheng Qianyu.
