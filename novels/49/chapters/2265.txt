Chapter 2266: Leaving (3)

Having witnessed the horror of the Night Soul Beast, how could they endure the sight of so many of them all crowded in one place?

To think they had accidentally stumbled into the sleeping chambers of the Night Soul Beasts…

Even Qin Feng, who was the bravest amongst them, couldn’t help breaking out in cold sweat. If they accidentally woke up these Night Soul Beasts, there was no way they would ever leave this place.

Ye Qingtang looked grim. Even she did not dare to wake these Night Soul Beasts. She knew the secret to handle a Night Soul Beast, but against so many… even she was not confident in doing so…

At this moment, Ye Qingtang thought of how those factions believed that the period of hibernation was the safest time to explore the tomb. She felt like laughing now.

Safe?

It was probably the opposite, right?

It was true that the Evil Soul Forest was comparatively safe during the period of hibernation. But who could have expected that those Night Soul Beasts would be hibernating inside the fiendcelestial’s tomb?

If those factions managed to survive and reach this cave, wouldn’t they die from fright at the sight of these Night Soul Beasts?

Safe…

To those exploring the fiendcelestial’s tomb, this was infinitely more dangerous.

Ye Qingtang shot Lei Yan and the others a look. The teenagers immediately steadied their hearts. The Night Soul Beast standing beside Ye Qing suddenly took on a strange expression.

But before it could make any movement, Ye Qing suddenly lifted it into his arms.

The Night Soul Beast: “…”

Ye Qing smiled at it. The smile was radiant and it made all the hairs on the Night Soul Beast stand on end. Helplessly, its body shrunk to the size of a cat.

Lei Yan and the rest noticed the entire incident, and their eyes nearly popped out in shock.

What the hell!

Was their Boss really able to handle a Night Soul Beast in this manner?

The Night Soul Beast in Ye Qing’s arms was as small as a cat. Seeing that, the teenagers calmed down. It looked like their Boss really knew how to deal with Night Soul Beasts.

So…

They didn’t have much to worry about then.

Ye Qing’s actions greatly reduced the fear in their hearts against Night Soul Beasts. They believed that their Boss could manage all those beasts.

What they didn’t know was that Ye Qing could only handle one.

If all the Night Soul Beasts in this cave woke up, they might as well all just lay down and wait for death.

Regardless, this misunderstanding managed to calm their hearts down.

Ye Qingtang didn’t have time to explain but just had them follow close behind her, making their way through the gaps between those Night Soul Beasts. The group carefully followed behind Ye Qing, trying to make their footsteps as light as possible.

“Growl…” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Just as Mu Ziying passed by a sleeping Night Soul Beast, that beast suddenly gave a low growl and shifted its body.

Mu Ziying’s face turned pale.

Luckily Jing Ze was fast and managed to draw Mu Ziying into his arms just before the Night Soul Beast made contact with her.

Ye Qingtang heaved a hidden sigh of relief, but she suddenly spotted something out of the corner of her eye.

There seemed to be a special pattern drawing on the original spot where the Night Soul Beast was sleeping.

Ye Qingtang seemed to have seen that pattern drawing some place before. But at that moment, she couldn’t really recall it completely.

Having been forced to walk past over a hundred slumbering Night Soil Beasts, the teenagers were all extremely anxious. Even though they had the wrong idea that Ye Qing could handle all those beasts, just the sight of the numbers was terrifying enough.
