Chapter 1851: Bet (3)

Baili Xi and the others felt bad when Ye Qingtang made the decision. On the other hand, the fat catfish was delighted.

“Okay, hurry up then.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The fat catfish stuck its big and long tongue out right away and it touched the ground. Taking one dice cup up with its tongue, it shook it around with apparent ease.

“Let’s see who has the bigger number. I’m warning you ahead, don’t even think of trying to use your powers to cheat. My senses are far more sensitive than any of you here.”

The fat catfish’s words made Baili Xi and the others’ hearts sink.

Though they didn’t know how to gamble, their hearing was extraordinary and they could hear the numbers of the dice. They had originally planned to change the numbers with their powers after Ye Qingtang was done shaking the dice cup, but now...

The fat catfish was indeed experienced.

Soon, the fat catfish’s flexible tongue was done shaking and he slammed the dice cup on the ground.

Baili Xi and the others’ faces instantly darkened.

They could hear that... there were two fives and one six in the dice cup...

“It’s your turn.” The fat catfish placed the dice cup on the ground and signaled to Ye Qingtang.

When Ye Qingtang saw the dice cup that was covered in the fat catfish’s saliva, she hesitated before finally taking it. Moving quickly, she shook the cup vigorously, to the point that noone could see clearly.

Everyone was surprised when they saw Ye Qingtang’s moves.

“Miss Ye knows how to gamble?”

When the fat catfish saw her moves, its whiskers unconsciously quivered.

“She’s an amateur. No matter how fanciful her moves are, what matters if the number in the dice cup. What’s the point in all these useless moves?”

The fat catfish’s words made them pause. They just realized that the way Ye Qingtang shook the dice cup was identical to the fat catfish. She seemed to be imitating the fat catfish.

However...

She wouldn’t be able to replicate the fat catfish’s score. The tiny sliver of hope they just had instantly vanished.

Bang! Ye Qingtang slammed the dice cup on the ground.

Baili Xi and the others’ hearts sank once they heard it.

It was two twos and one three...

It was true... What was the point?

The outcome was obvious. Even the fat catfish could hear it. The corners of its mouth quirked up into a smile as it opened the cup.

It was two fives and one six inside.

Mu Feiruo took a deep breath, looking at Ye Qingtang in concern.

“Two fives and one six... You’re formidable.” Ye Qingtang counted and opened her mouth in shock.

“Ha, it’s your turn. You have to admit to your loss. If not, I have my ways of dealing with you,” the fat catfish threatened.

“I said that I’ll try... I didn’t say that this round is counted.” Ye Qingtang sounded guilty as she spoke.

The fat catfish was even more pleased when he noticed her guilty tone. “Who said that you can try? This is it, open it up now.”

“But...” Ye Qingtang was hesitant.

The fat catfish started getting impatient. “Open it up now, if you win, I’ll tell you the rules immediately.”

Ye Qingtang didn’t appear confident at all. She looked at the fat catfish, before looking at the others and finally uncovering the dice.

The fat catfish couldn’t hide its grin. It couldn’t wait for the bangle to become its possession!
