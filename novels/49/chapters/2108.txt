Chapter 2109: Sea Clan (3)

The Fox Demon nodded.

That wasn’t good news for the Temple of Paragon.

With their powers, they could sustain the Temple of Paragon’s status even without the Holy Lord. However... if everyone else were to learn about the Holy Lord’s death, they would probably have a lot of trouble coming in their way.

Putting everything aside, the Sea Clan’s divine item would be taken away by the Sea King.

“The Sea King lost the Sea Clan’s divine item to our Holy Lord back then. If he learns of the Holy Lord’s death, he would come and snatch the divine item away,” the Fox Demon said.

The Temple of Paragon had no fear of others, but the Sea Clan... He controlled the oceans of both domains. No one from any domain would dare to go against the Sea Clan.

It would be disastrous.

The Sea King need not do anything else. He could just use his ability to control the oceans and drown the entire mainland. Moreover, countless sea clans in the ocean would heed the Sea King’s orders.

“Are we... really going to return the Sea Clan’s divine item to the Sea King?” Elder Bai asked.

“Of course not!” Elder Hua objected right away.

“How can we let someone else take away our Holy Lord’s belongings? If we really allow that to happen, it would mean that we’re incapable! How are we going to answer to her?”

The elders started discussing it heatedly. The Sea King’s sudden appearance indeed disrupted their plans.

“The Sea King is guessing that our Holy Lord is not doing well. If we just let him know that his assumptions are wrong, everything would be fine,” the Fox Demon suddenly said.

“Easier said than done. How are we going to let him know? Our Holy Lord has clearly...”

Before the Elder could finish his words, the Fox Demon lifted his arm and the crystal ball appeared.

It was an image of Ye Qingtang.

The corners of the Fox Demon’s lips kicked up into a cunning smile.

“Isn’t our Holy Lord here?”

Everyone was taken aback. They looked at Ye Qingtang through the crystal ball. Her appearance and figure, wasn’t that the Holy Lord herself?

“But... we can’t confirm this young lady’s identity yet.” An Elder was still concerned.

“Is it that important? I believe that she’s a reincarnated Holy Lord while you have second thoughts. It doesn’t matter now. As long as she appears before the Sea King, our problems will be resolved.” The Fox Demon laughed.

“Fox Demon Guardian, do you really intend to let her see the Sea King? Even if she’s a reincarnated Holy Lord, with her current powers...” An Elder was hesitant.

They were just planning to start grooming Ye Qingtang when the Sea King incident happened. There was no way they could proceed.

After all, she was merely at the Paragon level. Wouldn’t she be exposed in a matter of minutes in front of the Sea King?

“I have my ways. Putting that aside, we only have seven days before our Holy Lord’s birthday. How can we just not do anything about it?” The Fox Demon’s gaze traveled all over.

Everyone instantly understood him.

“Do we have to inform the other five Guardians?” Elder Bai asked.

“We can inform them about it but I’m not sure if they will make it back in time.”

“Alright, I’ll go and arrange it. As for the young lady...”

“Hand her over to Elder Hua,” the Fox Demon said.

“Sure,” Elder Hua agreed instantly.
