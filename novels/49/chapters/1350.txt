Chapter 1351 Traps 2

She was too naive as she did not expect such traps from the God of the Nature. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Since you’re not very comfortable with that, I suggest you can enter the eight-star constellation for cultivation. It is easier than the nine-star one.” The radiant object offered a ‘nice’ suggestion.

Ye Qingtang did not buy it anymore. She ignored the central constellations and looked towards the one-star constellation at the end.

She could level up exponentially inside high star-level worlds, but they were of high danger. She might get herself killed just due to her greed. She should just follow the order and cultivate step-by-step.

“I want to go to the one star constellation,” Ye Qingtang said.

She should be humbler before she understood everything here.

She did not want to die here before she could even level up.

The radiant object did not seem to be pleased by Ye Qingtang’s choice. It remained silent for a long while before it sighed.

“It is really a waste for you to enter the one-star constellation based on your potential. How about…”

“I want to enter the one-star constellation.” Ye Qingtang now understood the God of Nature’s way of thinking.

She would choose the one that it was not happy about.

“…” The radiant object did not seem to meet anyone so stubborn before.

“Alright, I will not say anything since it’s your own choice. But let me tell you something, the world inside the one star constellation is not that great,” it said after a long silence.

It was still trying to influence Ye Qingtang’s choice.

Ye Qingtang did not bother to reply. She carried the little white tiger and walked into the one-star constellation that floated in front of her.

Her view was covered by glints again. Ye Qingtang felt a sense of peace after the world spun in front of her.

She opened her eyes, but she was stunned by her surroundings.

She was in a poor little room. There was only a bed and a lame wooden table. The floor was filled with dirt. She raised her eyes and noticed that the door was locked. It seemed that there were a few young men chattering outside softly.

“This is… the world of the one-star constellation?” Ye Qingtang had a strange feeling. But she realized that the spirit energy here was more intense than the Central Mainland. It was incomparable with the one inside the nine-star constellation, but it was still, very intense.

“What kind of place is this? It’s covered by a rotten smell.” The little white tiger lied on Ye Qingtang’s arm and stared at the mess on the floor. There was a lot of food left on the floor, and all of it was rotten and gave out a pungent smell.

Ye Qingtang looked around for the exit of the constellation. The exit was at the corner of the room and dispersing slowly. She should have some time left before it totally disappeared.

As Ye Qingtang checked her surroundings, she could hear the discussion from the young men outside.

“If the Eldest Young Lady still doesn’t behave herself, I think Master is tired of her. I heard that the Master has ordered someone to clean the outer house. He will ask the Eldest Young Lady to move in soon.”

“It’s good for her to move over. She’s crazy every day, and we still have to send her food here. The room stinks. I don’t want to be near here at all.”
