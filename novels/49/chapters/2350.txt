Chapter 2351: Intoxicated (2)

Ran Mo had been very anxious. He was worried about Ye Qing and had hurried over to find Wu Fengling as a reinforcement. But when he returned, the bloodbath he had been expecting had not occurred. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

What they saw was Ye Qing standing on the platform refining an elixir. Meanwhile, Zhu Ning and the other medicine faculty teachers were watching him with intoxicated expressions.

Ran Mo, “…”

Wasn’t there supposed to be a challenge going on?

Could he have been hallucinating?

“Is this what you mean by life-threatening?” Wu Fengling raised an eyebrow at his disciple.

Ran Mo, “…”

He was worried Wu Fengling wouldn’t come with him so he claimed that Ye Qing’s life would be in danger if he didn’t come.

But now…

Who could tell him what was happening?

Wu Fengling glanced at the despondent expression of his disciple before walking over to the platform. The students respectfully gave way when they saw Wu Fengling approaching.

Meanwhile, the teachers on the platform appeared oblivious to Wu Fengling’s arrival. Their eyes never left Ye Qing.

“Elder Zhu, you guys are…” Wu Fengling tried to ask what was happening.

But before he could complete his sentence, Zhu Ning shot him a cold, angry look.

Wu Fengling, “…”

Alright, he would have to ask later.

Wu Fengling had come to prevent some major catastrophe, but he ended up watching Ye Qing refine elixirs together with a bunch of teachers.

He was amused but also rather mystified.

It seemed that Ye Qing also knew how to refine elixirs?

Furthermore…

Wu Fengling was rather amazed at the sight of Zhu Ning’s focused expression. Zhu Ning had told him before that apart from his Grand Master disciple, he could not bear to watch anyone else refine elixirs.

But now…

Zhu Ning was watching very intently. When Wu Fengling tried to speak, it was like he had committed a heinous crime.

If anything, Wu Fengling felt that the situation was rather incredulous.

Time passed by the second that stretched into lengthy minutes.

By the time Ye Qingtang finally extinguished the flame in her palm, a pale green elixir was left behind in her hand. At the same time, countless sighs could be heard.

Ye Qingtang instinctively turned to see…

Zhu Ning and the rest of the medicine faculty teachers had somehow come over to her side. Those folks looked as if they were hankering for more. Ye Qingtang was stunned.

“Teacher Zhu?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Weren’t they… competing?

Why did her opponent suddenly come over to her side?

Zhu Ning shook his head with a sigh. He closed his eyes, as if re-immersing himself in what he just witnessed.

That lingering feeling. It was not enough.

How many years had it been since? He was finally experiencing that feeling again. It was like when he just started learning alchemy and was watching famous alchemists refining elixirs.

“I have lost.” Zhu Ning opened his eyes, but there were no signs of anger. He looked at Ye Qing with a humbled expression. In front of everyone, he suddenly gave Ye Qing a deep bow.

“I have been obsessed with alchemy for many years, so much so that I appeared to have lost the stability of my mind. I seemed to have forgotten that there would always be someone better in this world.”

Everyone was dumbstruck by Zhu Ning’s bow.

The medicine faculty students were in a complete daze.

Zhu Ning lost?

Lost without even putting up a fight?

Impossible!

Ye Qingtang saw that Zhu Ning had already extinguished the fire in his tripod. “Teacher Zhu, you didn’t finish refining your elixir?”

Zhu Ning replied in an embarrassed tone, “That’s right. When I saw the way you refined, I knew that I had already lost. There’s no point in me continuing the process.”
