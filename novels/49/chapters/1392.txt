1393 Mission Completed 1

The God of Nature saw Ye Qingtang’s face of disbelief and scoffed. “I said that the one-star constellation is too weak. The missions here do not have any difficulty. However, since you completed all the missions, I will naturally take care of you since you are the first explorer who entered this Illusory Void in the past thousands of years.”

The God of Nature spoke very nobly, but Ye Qingtang simply did not believe him.

“You’re afraid that I will not come in the future, right?” Ye Qingtang exposed the God of Nature’s intentions immediately.

The God of Nature’s face froze, and he frowned. “What a joke. What is there for me to be afraid of?”

Ye Qingtang tugged her lips. Although the God of Nature stayed by her side occasionally in this period of time, she noticed that he was not around most of the time.

The strength of the constellation would affect the explorer but had no effect on the God of Nature. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Yet he despised it in all possible ways.

Most likely…

Only after the explorer entered the world of the constellation would the God of Nature’s consciousness enter as well. Moreover, this dazzling world was much more interesting than the empty Illusory Void.

In the thousands of years that the Holy Lord of Shadows sealed the Illusory Void, she was probably the first who entered this place. The God of Nature’s consciousness that had been bored for a few thousand years wanted her to enter a few more worlds of constellations so that he could wander around other beautiful mortal worlds.

“Alright. Since you completed the missions, you can choose to leave this place.” The God of Nature opened the door to exit almost too eagerly.

Ye Qingtang looked at the door before her and shifted her gaze outside the window.

The view outside the window was like a painting, and there was a huge statue in construction.

That was a statue of Ye Qingtang that the believers built on Floating Island for worship purposes. There were plenty of such statues all over the entire mainland.

Ye Qingtang took another look at the place where she spent months in and subsequently stepped into the door.

The world around her spun, and Ye Qingtang returned to the Illusory Void. Millions of stars before her shone brightly as though the months of memories she had were just a dream.

“Your illusory void is quite realistic.” Ye Qingtang looked at the God of Nature, who had turned into a radiant ball.

The radiant ball moved around slightly.

“How do you know if that mainland is real or an illusion?”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback by what the radiant ball said.

She knew that Spiritual Abodes could form mystic realms that were similar worlds to what the person had seen in their lives. Thus, she thought that that mainland was formed based on the radiant ball’s past memories.

However…

Ye Qingtang was in deep thought after hearing what the radiant ball said.

“The God of Nature is neither real nor fake. Perhaps you will know whether that mainland is an illusion or if it truly exists.” The radiant ball kept quiet after leaving her with that strange sentence.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

Was it possible…

That the mainland really existed in this world?

Everything she did previously was not just…

The radiant ball’s words had a deeper meaning, and Ye Qingtang could not make a judgment at that moment.

However…

Ye Qingtang never expected that perhaps on a certain day in the future, she would actually re-enter that mainland that was obsessed with immortal cultivation. She all the more would not have expected that… the immortal cultivation technique she taught at the spur of a moment would actually transform the entire mainland completely.

Perhaps the journey to cultivating into an immortal was about to begin.

This was a story to be told later on.
