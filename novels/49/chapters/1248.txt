Chapter 1249: Every Debt Has Its Debtor (2)

But at that moment, Ye Qingtang remained motionless. She maintained her composure as she sat on her chair. She even slowly picked up her wine cup, as if completely unaware that death was imminent.

However, the second before the crimson dragon touched Ye Qingtang, the Temple of Shadows’ Branch Master, who had been biding his time, suddenly struck. A black whirlwind swept out of his wide sleeve and instantly transformed into a huge black dragon that headed straight for the crimson dragon of the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect.

The instant the two dragons collided, the aftershock smashed the surrounding utensils into smithereens.

“How dare you! Who is this lowly human who dares to offend the Holy Lord?” the Temple of Shadows’ Branch Master said coldly, but he was inwardly murmuring to himself. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Before they left for the Luo House, the Holy Son, Ming Wang, had ordered them to secretly observe the Holy Lord’s behavior to ensure that she was not an impostor.

Along the way, the Branch Master had not seen anything unusual about the Holy Lord’s behavior.

When the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect had offended her just now, the Branch Master was secretly observing Ye Qingtang’s reaction.

But she acted exactly like the Holy Lord had in the past.

The Holy Lord had maintained her composure and talked and laughed sweetly without deigning to pay any attention to the Grand Elder.

Ye Qingtang did not react when she saw that the Branch Master had acted, but she inwardly heaved a huge sigh of relief.

Every day that passed was traumatic.

Considering the gulf between her powers and those of the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect, she would be unable to avoid that blow even if she wanted to. Even if she had the ability to avoid it, just the act of dodging would arouse the deepest suspicions in the Undead.

After all…

The Holy Lord of Shadows, who used to be the most powerful cultivator, would certainly not act like that…

In that situation, Ye Qingtang would have died whether she moved or not. She might as well maintain her pose as Holy Lord.

As expected, the Undead of the Temple of Shadows could not possibly tolerate anyone offending their Holy Lord.

Hadn’t they acted?

Although she had passed the test, Ye Qingtang broke out in a cold sweat.

The enemies that this Holy Lord of Shadows had made were probably each more formidable and tougher than the next.

Every day was like treading on thin ice. When would it end?

However…

Although she inwardly felt helpless, Ye Qingtang continued to maintain an attitude of supreme aloofness. She glanced at the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect from the corner of her eye.

“I will not repeat myself. Since today is Luo Qufeng’s birthday banquet, I will let the matter go. But if you don’t appreciate my offer, then don’t blame me for not giving you a chance.”

Grand Elder, pack up your remarkable abilities and go!

“Rubbish. If I don’t kill you today, I will let my entire Yun Clan down. Come on and be killed!” The Grand Elder failed to notice Ye Qingtang’s inner cry. He only felt that the Holy Lord of Shadows was completely detestable, and he could not wait to tear her to shreds.

Why won’t he listen?

Ye Qingtang sighed inwardly but continued to smile calmly. She raised her hand and emptied her cup. She spoke casually.

“If you want me to fight, you will have to prove to be worthy of it.”

Ye Qingtang spoke without looking at anyone else, but her words were instructions to the Undead from the Temple of Shadows.

The dozens of Undead from the Temple of Shadows suddenly rose, and a strong demonic aura flowed forth.

The Yunying Sect naturally would not give up. The Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect gave a low shout and aimed the first blow at Ye Qingtang.
