1331 You Are On Your Own 3

Ye Qingtang secretly rolled her eyes.

“Why don’t you think of some way to deal with it rather than quibble with me?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Ling Yan said with a laugh, “Miss Ye, thanks for your concern.”

Ye Qingtang was about to say something when Ling Yan suddenly said, “Miss Ye has a guest. I won’t disturb you any longer.”

With that, Ling Yan broke off their connection.

A moment after Ling Yan broke off the connection, a knock sounded on Ye Qingtang’s door.

Ye Qingtang was startled and immediately got up to open the door.

Ming Gu was standing obediently at the doorway, smiling at Ye Qingtang.

“Ah Yao…”

“You little fellow, are you here to disturb me again?” Ye Qingtang’s lips suddenly curved in amusement, and she reached out to pinch Ming Gu’s little nose.

Ming Gu looked shy and lowered his eyes to hide the stiffness in his expression.

“Come on in,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile. She turned first but secretly drew a deep breath.

What the hell!

Ming Wang posed as Ming Gu to look for me?

Ye Qingtang was very wary of the devious Ming Wang. Although she knew that Ming Wang was here, he had yet to reveal himself. But now…

Ming Wang had taken on Ming Gu’s adorable and innocent look to appear in front of her.

Ye Qingtang wanted to die.

She had actually pinched that killer’s, Ming Wang’s, nose?!

Haha…

“Ming Gu” quietly stood outside the door for a moment before he entered on his little legs. He maintained his coy appearance.

Ye Qingtang tried her best to maintain her composure and did not dare to let her expression change. She sat down on a chair and gestured to “Ming Gu”, who was standing by her side.

“Ming Gu” slowly walked over to Ye Qingtang, raised his little face, and threw himself onto Ye Qingtang’s knee.

“Ah Yao, when can we go back to the Temple of Shadows?”

Ye Qingtang looked at the “Ming Gu” before her, and her heart constricted. But she smiled and reached out to pinch “Ming Gu” little cheek.

“We can go back when matters here are settled.”

“Ah Yao, why don’t I find some Black Flame Worms for you when we get back?” “Ming Gu” said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang’s gut started to roil. As she looked at “Ming Gu”, an evil idea arose in Ye Qingtang’s heart. She scooped “Ming Gu” up and cuddled him on her knee.

A stiff look flashed across “Ming Gu” eyes, but he quickly restrained himself.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and smiled. Then, she used both hands to pinch “Ming Gu” little face. She said with a laugh, “Ming Wang, do you want to eat Black Flame Worms so badly? What’s the matter? Are you still thinking about the time Ming Gu didn’t give you the Black Flame Worm?”

Ye Qingtang’s words startled “Ming Gu”.

You keep on testing me. Today, I will pinch you in return.

Ye Qingtang took the opportunity to pinch his soft face a few more times.

In a flash, Ming Wang jumped down from Ye Qingtang’s lap. His smiling and innocent appearance had vanished to be replaced by his aloof and vicious expression.

“What’s the matter? Are you so scared of me?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ming Wang smilingly, but her heart was in her mouth.

The real Holy Lord of Shadows would certainly be able to tell Ming Gu and Ming Wang apart. No matter how similar they looked, there was no mistaking them.

Furthermore…

The Holy Lord of Shadows certainly would not be afraid of Ming Wang.
