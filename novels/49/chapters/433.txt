Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The moment Fu Lingtian finished his words, he raised his fist towards the sky. His breath and energy reached their peaks at that instant.

The power of the fist was so strong that the whole ring was shaking. It seemed to be the end of the world.

The entire audience kept quiet under the ring. The drama would end soon.

No matter how strong Ye Qingtang was, she would not be able to avoid a full-force attack.

Elder Qin was concerned. Ye Qingtang might not be able to remain safe and sound under Fu Lingtian’s fist.

However, Ye Qingtang suddenly moved.

She did not back off this time. Instead, she raised her arm towards the incoming attack.

“Boom!”

The sound exploded, and the invisible air waves spread out from them.

“This… This is impossible!”

Fu Lingtian was totally shocked as he saw Ye Qingtang, who was standing close to him

Silence.

It was deadly silent.

Everyone froze at the moment.

A streak of light sparkled through Elder Mo’s eyes. He stood up from his seat and stared at his in-name disciple on the ring.

Under everyone’s gaze, Ye Qingtang casually blocked the attack with her palm. She held Fu Lingtian’s full force attack easily.

Fu Lingtian’s fist was held by Ye Qingtang.

Just now, Fu Lingtian asked her to take her move.

And now, Ye Qingtang did what he asked. She did not dodge.

“Twenty.” Ye Qingtang remained still, but her voice was cold.

The whole place was quiet as everyone was stunned as they stared at Ye Qingtang.

The Qinglin Sect Elders were shocked, and they could not believe what they just saw.

Before the twentieth move, everyone thought that Ye Qingtang studied movement techniques to avoid direct contact with Fu Lingtian.

However, she took the twentieth move with her palm and blocked Fu Lingtian!

Astonished, Elder Qin was dazed for a moment. Next to him, excitement could be seen in Elder Mo’s eyes, and he instantly stood up.

“The young lady from the Xuanling Sect…”

The Wind Moon Sect Elders frowned heavily.

Ye Qingtang stood straight on the ring. She placed one of her hands at the back and the other holding Fu Lingtian’s fist.

“This is the twentieth move,” Ye Qingtang said expressionlessly.

“This is not possible.” Cold sweat appeared on Fu Lingtian’s forehead.

His right fist was held tightly by Ye Qingtang. Her hand was like a mountain from the Ninth Heaven. No matter how she struggled, he could not withdraw his hand.

“Fu Lingtian, I did what I promised just now. I did not fight back and granted you twenty moves… However, you did not grab the chances. The twenty moves are so weak. Such a disappointment.” Ye Qingtang sighed softly.

The audiences broke into discussions upon hearing her words.

Ye Qingtang mocked Fu Lingtian by saying he was too weak for her!!

“What… What did you say?” Fu Lingtian’s face clouded.

The young lady in front of him was just at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. How dare she to talk to him like that!

Ye Qingtang kept her smile away. Her eyes were cold. “Now, it’s my turn.”

The hand that was holding Fu Lingtian’s fist suddenly tightened as she finished her words.

She directed her inner qi within her body instantly. The force rushed out of her body like a beast out of control.

“Arh!!!” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

A screech and the broken sound of bones were heard at the same time.

At that moment, everyone who was present was stunned.
