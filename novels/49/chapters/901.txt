Chapter 902 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (4)

It was already a grave sin to hit Feng Wuya in public!

Li Xiu immediately looked at Ye Qingtang and shouted with a frown.

“You, come over!”

After hearing that, Ye Qingtang looked at Li Xiu without any emotions.

“Don’t you know that he is from the Feng ancient clan of the Central Mainland? How dare you touch him?!” Li Xiu was infuriated, and his brows were tightly furrowed

Although Feng Wuya was extremely despicable and Li Xiu, himself, also wanted to slaughter him to release his hatred, who would bear the consequences?!

Once anything happened to Feng Wuya, it was without a doubt that the attacker would die. Not just so, even he and all the junior brothers and sisters present would have to face this frightening outcome, and the Supreme Academy might even be embroiled in it as well.

What could they do by then?!

Could they let millions of people be buried together with one Feng Wuya?!

“Hurry up and apologize to Brother Feng!” Li Xiu frowned at Ye Qingtang and shouted.

Upon hearing Li Xiu, Feng Wuya, who was waiting for Ye Qingtang’s reply, snickered coldly immediately. “Li Xiu, what are you? Apologize… Can just an apology solve the problem? You’re so ridiculously naive.”

Uneasy, Li Xiu could only pile smiles on his face. “Brother Feng, you are the bigger person… You possess the bloodline of the Feng clan. There’s no need for you to lower your identity and fuss with these juniors…”

“Humph!” Feng Wuya swept Li Xiu a disdainful look and scoffed.

“Li Xiu, I’m telling you this: if she doesn’t agree, not just her but everyone present here will die an extremely tragic death! I want to chop off all your heads, bring them back to the Central Mainland, and hang them at the door of the Divine Virtual Academy. I’ll let everyone know the outcome of offending my Feng ancient clan.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Once Feng Wuya said that, everyone from the Supreme Academy was shaken, and Li Xiu’s face turned pale instantly.

However, at this very moment, in the group of Divine Virtual Academy disciples, two young disciples’ eyes drifted to Ye Qingtang.

The expressions of those two people were a little strange. Once they saw Ye Qingtang’s face clearly, their eyes widened immediately and were filled with fear while their bodies trembled.

Almost at the same time, the two young disciples exchanged a look and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.

This lady was the insanely-talented disciple from Supreme Academy a few batches ago, and her martial skills were unfathomable!

Previously, the two of them found Gu Tianhe, Feng Wudang, and the rest and wanted to attack them initially, but Perfected Gu Yun came into the picture subsequently.

Yet ultimately, they personally witnessed this lady before them slaughter Perfected Gu Yun right there and then with only one strike!

That Perfected Gu Yun was a Divine Arcane Supremacy, and furthermore, his backing was the well-known Ling Yan!

This lady even dared to kill Ling Yan’s person. What else did she not dare to do?

However, at this instant, Ye Qingtang was mentally devising a plot to bring Feng Wudang and Gu Tianhe away from this place.

Every student of the Divine Virtual Academy was extremely powerful. It was said that this mainland had a strong suppression on the martial realm of outsiders, and perhaps Ye Qingtang still had means to deal with one or two people. But with so many of them joining forces…

“Haha… Looking at you, it seems that you’re unwilling.” Feng Wuya stared at Ye Qingtang, who still had not given a reply.
