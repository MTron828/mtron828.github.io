Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although she was very curious about the big yellow dog, Ye Qingtang really did not want to continue talking to it. She and the big yellow dog seemed to be on completely different wavelengths and it was very difficult to communicate with it.

“Brother Canine, you don’t even know about the four domains of the world?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at the big yellow dog in surprise.

“Should I know about them?” The yellow dog glanced at Blood Moon Elder.

The Blood Moon Elder was speechless.

Shouldn’t it know?

Just as the Blood Moon Elder was about to say something, Ye Qingtang frowned and looked into the distance. The auras of several extremely terrifying powers were radiating from the depths of the void. And they were getting closer and closer.

Even the Blood Moon Elder who was standing at the side sensed those auras. His face paled.

“Holy Lady, have they come for us?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in surprise. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Ye Qingtang’s expression was grave. From the looks of it, they were indeed coming for her.

“Go now!”

Ye Qingtang did not stay any longer and immediately fled into the distance with the yellow dog and the Blood Moon Elder.

Although Ye Qingtang’s speed was fast, she had to slow down because of the Blood Moon Elder. On top of that, their pursuers were extremely powerful and caught up with Ye Qingtang and the rest in less than half an hour.

Ye Qingtang was not unfamiliar with the person in the lead. She had only met him once in the Wailing Well. He was the elder with the golden book.

“Come with us.”

The elder looked down imperiously at Ye Qingtang, his voice cold.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly when she heard that. She looked at the golden book elder in the sky and asked, “Who exactly are you? Why are you chasing us?”

The elder sneered. “You’re not worthy enough to know. I can only advise you to be obedient. There is no point in resisting.”

“Ha, what big words.”

Ye Qingtang was not afraid. She did not expect these people to find her so quickly. They must come from powerful backgrounds.

“Holy Lady, leave first. I’ll stop them!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. He probably couldn’t stop even a single one of them.

“I am afraid you guys can’t stop me if I insist on leaving.” Ye Qingtang scoffed.

“Oh?” The elder’s interest was piqued. “I would like to see how you can escape then.”

“Holy Lady, I don’t think we can defeat them,” the Blood Moon Elder said softly.

Right now, he was the equivalent of a cripple. Although the Holy Lady was powerful, it was impossible for her to defeat those elders. Especially that elder man with the golden book, his strength was unfathomable.

“Don’t you think I know that?” Ye Qingtang said softly.

Even though they weren’t strong enough, what else could they do? Should they really do as commanded and obediently stand on the spot without resisting? To allow themselves to be captured?

Although the golden book elder’s powers were unfathomable, Ye Qingtang did not have to be afraid of him.

“Holy Lady, we can’t defeat them. If we run, we probably can’t outrun them either… what should we do then?” The Blood Moon Elder had a bitter expression. Life was really too difficult.

Ye Qingtang smiled.

As long as it was not the resurrected man himself, she was not afraid of these people.

With her abilities, only a fool would fight head-on. Not everything had to be solved with force. For example, she could try using her wits.. Of course, that was something that the Blood Moon Elder was lacking.
