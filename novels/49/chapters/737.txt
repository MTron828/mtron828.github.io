This man was Gu Yihan, Perfected Xuanchen’s eldest disciple, and he possessed outstanding endowments and a steady nature. He also had prestige among the Admirable Sky Peak disciples.

“You’re always talking about these. If you’re so free, why don’t you cultivate more?” Gu Yihan swept a cold glance at Ye Ningxi and Qian Ze.

Qian Ze shrugged. “I’m just speaking casually. Why did you take it seriously, Eldest Senior Brother? That new fellow seems strange though. I reckon he spent quite a sum for Master to accept him as a disciple…”

“I heard that the Ye Chen fellow is very handsome. Little Qingqing, have you seen him?” Ye Ningxi looked at Yin Qingluo with a grin.

Yin Qingluo’s headache worsened.

“Cultivation is dependent on oneself. Even if one was apprenticed, it is meaningless if he does not cultivate diligently,” Gu Yihan said.

Ye Ningxi and Qian Ze exchanged a look

Ever since Perfected Xuanchen took on the position of the acting Valley Master, there were more and more things he had to manage. Gu Yihan had been by Perfected Xuanchen’s side since young and was the most mature. In addition, he was rather gifted; thus, he would watch his junior brothers and sisters cultivate when Perfected Xuanchen was busy.

Both Ye Ningxi and Qian Ze were not short of Gu Yihan’s nagging.

“Alright. I still have something on. I’ll take my leave first.” Qian Ze yawned and waved. Similarly, Ye Ningxi took the opportunity and found an excuse to escape.

Gu Yihan did not stay on any longer and left after taking the things that he needed.

After following Yan Shu around the entire Falling Sky Valley, Ye Qingtang finally returned to her own room.

The current Falling Sky Valley was the same as in her memory, just that it was only a few years earlier.

Ye Qingtang had stepped into Falling Sky Valley, but she was unaware that there was a storm in the monarch city because of the black market incident.

Covered in dirt, the Dragon-Tiger General recounted his encounters with a sullen expression in the premier’s residence.

The Nine Nights Dynasty Premier, Qin Long, listened to the Dragon-Tiger General’s complaints without any emotion.

“The black market has its rules. Your son did act rashly this time. I know about this already. You can return first.” Qin Long waved a hand. The Dragon-Tiger General wanted to say something more but did not dare to offend the Premier. He could only wipe his tears as he departed from the Premier’s residence.

Once the Dragon-Tiger General left, Qin Chen, who had been standing aside, silently told his father. “If what the Dragon-Tiger General said is true, that young man must have a pretty impressive background.”

When the Dragon-Tiger General mentioned the incident in the black market, Qin Chen heard every word of it.

The person had the skills of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and was very young as described by the Dragon-Tiger General. His future was beyond measure, and becoming a true Yin Yang Perfected Lord in the future was not an issue.

“Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord…” Qin Long narrowed his eyes slightly. “Such a powerful figure is indeed rare. Since he came to the monarch city, we must pay attention to him.”

“It would be best if we can make use of this person. If not… judging from his actions, I’m afraid he will be trouble,” Qin Chen said.

Qin Long nodded. “The Dragon-Tiger General has already sent someone to draw that person’s portrait. Have him send it over sometime soon and take a look at the person’s appearance. If possible, employ someone to find out about that person’s background, though you must not be exposed. Interact with him if there’s a chance. It would be best if he is willing to work for us.”Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
