Chapter 1939: The Mastermind Behind It All (3)

Ye Qingtang’s words sent them all into silence.

It was true that the Ancient You Clan had been acting differently lately. They hadn’t attended the previous Martial Arts Championship, even though the Ancient You Clan were always trying their best to come on top.

They had been too indifferent this time.

Furthermore, they had been taking rather big actions lately, acting arrogantly on the Central Mainland, which rubbed some of the other Ancient Clans the wrong way.

But then they realized that the power of the Ancient You Clan had gotten stronger than before.

These had all happened gradually over time which was why none of them had noticed the connection between the events.

As for the current massacres of the Ancient Clans that were occurring, there had been no news from the Ancient You Clan at all. Some of the Ancient Clans closer to them had wanted to warn them but had received no reply at all.

In fact, they had not received any news about the Ancient You Clan being attacked either.

Combined with the fact that the power of the Ancient You Clan had greatly increased previously, they couldn’t help but suspect whether the mastermind of all this... was the Ancient You Clan.

“Could it really be the Ancient You Clan?”

“D*mn it, I knew that those old scoundrels were up to no good. I treated them as mad men when they were acting so arrogantly on the Central Mainland.”

With Ye Qingtang’s words, they finally strung together the hints that they had missed out previously.

But this only made them panic even more.

Even in the past, the Ancient You Clan’s audacious ambition had never been lacking. If they were to talk about ambition, few people on the Central Mainland could beat the Ancient You Clan.

“No wonder... no wonder Domain Monarch Jiang was the first to go. The Ancient You Clan had already been eying the title of Domain Monarch for the longest time. They had challenged them multiple times previously already, so if they were to make a move, the first they would attack would definitely be the one most at odds with them.”

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank as she heard this.

The Ancient Clan people all started chattering among themselves, all of them wanting nothing more than to deal with the Ancient You Clan immediately. But they all knew that they were no match for them at all.

After all, they had sent out two youths who had wiped out many of the Ancient Clans with barely any effort. Who knew how strong the Ancient You Clan was now?

Ye Qingtang had her own thoughts and didn’t want to spend any more time guessing with them here, so she sent them back to rest first.

The Ancient Clan people now followed Ye Qingtang’s every word obediently and didn’t dare waste any time ushering Ye Qingtang back into the Temple of Shadows.

Likewise, they also didn’t dare take one step out of the Temple of Shadows.

Now that they knew who their opponent was, how would they dare leave this haven?

The Ancient Clans who had disagreements with the Ancient You Clan were all fearful now. They quickly sent messages back to their clan to arrange for their transfer. Then they hid in the Temple of Shadows with the elite members of their clan and did not dare to step out at all.

All their hope was now placed on the Temple of Shadows. They were all clear on the fact that apart from the Holy Lord of Shadows, none of them was a match for the Ancient You Clan.

As the news spread, more and more Ancient Clan came to the Temple of Shadows to seek protection.

Soon enough, the Temple of Shadows transformed into a center of refuge.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com
