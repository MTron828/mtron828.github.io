Chapter 1268: Walking on Thin Ice (3)

Ye Qingtang collapsed on the soft bed in her living quarters. The little white tiger took a peek at Ye Qingtang and knew that the birthday banquet tonight was not simple.

“This is still the beginning. If you don’t leave the Temple of Shadows, you will suffer more in the future. Today’s birthday banquet is most likely to test you, and there will be many more such incidents in the future. With these skills of yours, you might very well be exposed one day,” said the little white tiger. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Do you think I don’t wish to go? I can’t even go…” Ye Qingtang’s headache intensified.

Other people were envious of the Holy Lord of Shadows’ reputation and position, but anyone apart from the true owner of the position would go berserk if they were at the position.

Not mentioning how many enemies the Holy Lord of Shadows had outside, the suspicions that the internal members of the Temple of Shadows had over her identity were already extremely life-threatening.

Just as the little white tiger and Ye Qingtang were talking, the door to her room was suddenly opened.

Startled, Ye Qingtang hurriedly sat up and suddenly saw…

A tiny figure was hiding behind the door quietly, and he poked half his head out to look at her cautiously.

“Ming Gu?” Ye Qingtang’s heart reached her throat when she saw the little fellow hiding behind the door.

She did not know whether Ming Gu heard her conversation with the little white tiger.

“Ah Yao… Can… I come in?” Seeing that he was “discovered”, Ming Gu immediately moved his tiny legs and kept his hands behind him while looking at Ye Qingtang pitifully.

Looking at Ming Gu’s reaction, Ye Qingtang reckoned that he did not hear the conversation and was slightly relieved. She then put on a doting expression and smiled.

“Why? You have not seen me for half a day, but you miss me so much already?”

There was a slight hint of shyness on Ming Gu’s ash face. He lowered his head rather awkwardly, and he swayed his body. “Of course I miss you, but… I know that you hate those so-called banquets and that you have never liked human food. I thought that you must not have eaten much today so… I specially brought something for you…”

Just looking at Ming Gu’s shy behavior and leaving aside his identity as the Temple of Shadows Holy Son and the current situation, Ye Qingtang’s heart was about to melt.

Ming Gu always reminded her of Little You Yun whom the Ancient You Clan stole away; Little You Yun was also very shy and adorable like this then.

Without control, Ye Qingtang’s smile became more natural, and her voice had a sincere teasing tone. “What delicacy did you bring? Let me see.”

Ming Gu’s eyes brightened slightly, and he broke out into a bright smile. He immediately stretched out his tiny hands that he kept behind him…

In his tiny hands was a black worm that was a whole ring bigger than his hands. Its round body wriggled around and gave off a rotten, decomposed smell.

With just a look, Ye Qingtang almost vomited.

“Ah Yao, this is a Black Flame Worm that I just caught today. I know that you like to eat this the most. Quickly eat it while it’s hot. It is still well and alive now… Ming Wang wanted to eat it, but I could not even bear to give it to him.” Ming Gu did not even realize that Ye Qingtang’s lips were twisted, and he blinked his wide eyes as though he was offering a treasure.

The Undead Clan would not age nor die, and eating was not to sustain their life but to fulfill the stomach’s desires.

Moreover, they had an extremely unique taste for food and usually consumed special species of dead creatures.

The Black Flame Worm was one of the best delicacies in the eyes of the Undead Clan…
