Chapter 377: Ice and Fire (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang was only at the first stage of the First Heaven in the Martial Qi Level One realm while Song Junqiu was already at the third stage of the First Heaven and was only a step away from entering the Second Heaven.

To win against Song Junqiu and the rest on the Life and Death Ring, the only option for her was to break through to the Second Heaven state in these ten days!

However, to advance an entire realm in such a short span of time was easier said than done.

Ye Qingtang was able to achieve remarkable improvements on the eve of the inner sect assessment back then by relying on the effects that the upgrade of her spirit root brought.

Ye Qingtang realized that every time her spirit root was improved, her abilities would increase by leaps and bounds. Currently, she was already an orange spirit root, and while the inner sect was rich in spirit energy, she could clearly feel that the advancement of her spirit root was gradually slowing.

The higher the spirit root was, the harder it was to nourish it. The reason she came to Xuanling Sect was for the Black Heaven Water in Xuanling Sect’s mystic realm, which the Palace Lord of the Antiquity Palace talked about the other day. Only the Black Heaven Water could allow her spirit root to improve at a faster speed.

It was just that there were still months to the start of the mystic realm, and only highly-ranked disciples in the inner sect have the qualifications to enter. Given Ye Qingtang’s current position in the inner sect, she would probably not have the qualification to enter even if the mystic realm opened.

She only had ten days worth of time then.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes as she pondered over the methods which could increase her skills rapidly. Her eyes swept across the room but realized a familiar figure was missing.

“Xiao Guai?”

Astonished, Ye Qingtang stood up and searched around her courtyard to no avail, with only the little lightning dragon laying on the bed dejectedly.

She only found out from Fei Ying that the silver wolf disappeared unknowingly after she left, and they could not find it despite days of searching.

“What is going on exactly?” Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed tightly. When she was in the outer sect, she had entrusted the silver wolf under Qin Huan’s care as well when she went out on a mission, but when she returned, Qin Huan said the silver wolf disappeared.

It was just that Ye Qingtang thought Qin Huan was blabbering nonsense when she saw the silver wolf.

Yet, unexpectedly…

The silver wolf actually disappeared again?

Ye Qingtang found it strange but could not see any traces of the silver wolf. The Life and Death Ring was going to happen ten days later, and she could not be distracted to search for it right now. Furthermore, Fei Ying had to take care of Ni Shang. Thus, she could only suppress the matter for the moment.

She did not know whether it was an illusion or not, but she was not the slightest anxious although she knew the silver wolf was nowhere to be found, as though she had a premonition somehow.

The disappearance of the silver wolf was not because of any external factors but its own decision.

Leaving the disappearance case aside, Ye Qingtang focused on the matter at hand.

With her usual cultivation, breaking through from stage one of the First Heaven to the Second Heaven in ten days was almost impossible. Time was limited, and Ye Qingtang could only take another route.

The next morning, Ye Qingtang dragged the drowsy Blood Moon Sect Elder up.

“How many Xuanming points do you still have?” Ye Qingtang suddenly asked.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was still half-asleep as he looked at the number on his bracelet.

“About two thousand.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A large portion of the Xuanming points was left by Zhou Qu. Since the Blood Moon Sect Elder did not find a use for anything, he had never touched it at all and even earned quite an amount from the mission with Ye Qingtang before.

“Give it to me,” Ye Qingtang said straightforwardly.

“What?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder was slightly stunned.

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to explain anything and took out a bottle of the Summoning Soul Pills. “Exchange or not?”
