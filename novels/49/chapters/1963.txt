Chapter 1964: So Filthy (3)

Ye You. The rest of your days here will be long. You can stay here in this prison to enjoy Lady Ghost’s hospitality.

One shouldn’t be fooled by Lady Ghost’s coquettish look. She was the top interrogator and torturer in the Temple of Shadows. No one had ever been able to keep any secrets the moment they ended up in Lady Ghost’s hands.

Before half an hour had passed, Lady Ghost already drew out everything that Ye You knew.

Ye You was indeed more familiar with the Ancient You Clan than Jiang Qin. As much as she hated her, Ye Qingtang had to admire Ye You’s capabilities. No matter where Ye You ended up, she had the ability to adapt and rise with the times.

Whether it was in the Ye family, the sect, or the Jiang family—it was all the same. Even inside the Ancient You Clan, she had been able to gain a steady foothold.

Ye Qingtang had no idea how she managed to do it. She hadn’t immediately killed Ye You as she wanted to get information from her.

Now...

She had gotten all that she wanted.

The Ancient You Clan had groomed a lot of youths, and each was more terrifying than the last. The younger they were, the more formidable they would be. As far as Ye You knew, the most powerful monster that the Ancient You Clan had was Little Luo Xue. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Apart from the ancient clans who had been eradicated, quite a number of other powers had secretly promised their allegiance to the Ancient You Clan. One of those powers was the Sacred Ground of Reflection and the Central Dynasty. In addition, Ye Qingtang also saw a familiar name amongst the list of powers who had gone over to the Ancient You Clan’s side.

The Luo Family...

Ye Qingtang recognized this Luo Family as it was the riskiest test Ming Wang had given her.

However...

Ye Qingtang thought that after the banquet that night, the Luo family had already disappeared from the mainland. She never imagined that the family was still around and that they had pledged allegiance to the Ancient You Clan...

It must be said that Ye You did know a lot of things.

After looking over everything, Ye Qingtang went to the prison again. By that time, Lady Ghost and the rest of the Undead Clan had already left.

But the thick scent of blood lingering behind revealed the horrifying things that had happened earlier.

Ye Qingtang walked slowly into the cell. Jiang Qin and Ye You had already been let down from their hooks.

Jiang Qin looked as if she had a layer of skin scraped off. She was just a pile of blood and flesh huddling in a corner of the cell. Her breath was extremely weak.

As for Ye You...

Ye Qingtang looked at Ye You, who was curled up in a corner and bleeding all over. She glanced at the perfect piece of human skin crumpled up beside Ye You.

Lady Ghost had carved off Ye You’s skin in one continuous piece.

Ye You was now like a maggot picked up from a pool of blood, squirming and twitching.

Hearing footsteps, Ye You lifted her head. That bloodied mess of a face looked exceptionally malevolent. Those bloodshot eyes stared straight at Ye Qingtang.

Intense hatred filled her heart. Paying no heed to the terrible pain, Ye You pounced toward the side of the cage. She gripped the metal bars with her bloodied hands as she glared at the Holy Lord of Shadows who had betrayed her.

“Do you hate me?” Ye Qingtang stared down imperiously at Ye You.

“Ah!!” Ye You shrieked in rage. She opened her jaws wide, revealing her tongue, which had been cut in half.

After gathering all the necessary information, Lady Ghost had cruelly cut off Ye You’s tongue.

“Very good.” Ye Qingtang gazed at the hate-filled Ye You. “I am very pleased with your level of hatred. Only a high enough level of pain would be enough to make you hate me so much.”
