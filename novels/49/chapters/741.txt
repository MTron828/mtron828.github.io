Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Yan Shu noticed those Blue Cloud Peak disciples as well. Those people failed to steal Sheng Qianyu’s things and even ended being beaten up by Ye Qingtang that day. Then, Yan Shu already felt that this matter would not end just like that.

Now…

“We’ll wait and see,” Yan Shu said cautiously and walked towards Li Jingwen with Yin Qingluo.

In Admirable Sky Peak, those disciples who were still cultivating could not help but stop whatever they were doing when they saw Li Jingwen and a group of Blue Cloud Peak disciples. Confusion and puzzlement filled their eyes as they looked at those Blue Cloud Peak disciples.

“Why are the Blue Cloud Peak people here at our Admirable Sky Peak today?”

“Who knows…”

“Isn’t that Blue Cloud Peak’s top disciple, Li Jingwen? Why is he here too?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Admirable Sky Peak disciples long knew about the unfriendly relations between the two peaks, and both peaks’ disciples were irked with each other when they met in the valley.

Furthermore, after their Peak Master, Perfected Xuanchen, became the acting Valley Master, the relations between the two peaks worsened. However, they were warned by Perfected Xuanchen to not enter a strife with Blue Cloud Peak, and they could only endure it silently even if they suffered unjustly.

Yet, unexpectedly…

Blue Cloud Peak’s top disciple actually brought people to their Admirable Sky Peak today.

In the crowd, Sheng Qianyu’s heart trembled when he saw Li Jingwen and those familiar figures.

On the other side, Yan Shu and Yin Qingluo had already walked to Li Jingwen. Li Jingwen was Blue Cloud Peak’s top disciple, and he entered the valley earlier than Yan Shu and Yin Qingluo, Thus, both of them had to address him as “senior brother”.

“Senior Brother Li.” Yan Shu greeted politely.

Li Jingwen stood firmly with no intention of bothering with Yan Shu and said coldly, “Where is your Admirable Sky Peak’s Ye Chen? Call him out.”

Yan Shu was slightly taken aback. Ye Chen had only entered the valley for a few days and should not have come into contact with Li Jingwen. Why was Li Jingwen looking for him suddenly?

When Yan Shu saw those Blue Cloud Peak disciples behind Li Jingwen, he more or less knew what was going on.

“Junior Brother Ye is not in the valley today. He left the valley this morning. May I know what you’re finding him for, Senior Brother Li?” Yan Shu asked while maintaining his composure.

“Not here? Is he really not here or does he not dare to come out?” Li Jingwen laughed coldly.

“Junior Brother Ye left the valley earlier today. If Senior Brother Li has something for him, why don’t you let us know first? We will help you to relay the message,” Yin Qingluo said immediately.

“I indeed have something to look for him for.” Li Jingwen looked at Yin Qingluo, and his lips curled into a sneer. “A few days ago, he injured the Blue Cloud Peak disciples for no reason. He must give me an explanation for this.”

As expected!

Yan Shu and Yin Qingluo understood what Li Jingwen was here for immediately.

Upon hearing Li Jingwen’s words, the other Admirable Sky Peak disciples whispered to one another.

“How long has Ye Chen been in Falling Sky Valley? Why did he beat up the Blue Cloud Peak disciples?”

“Valley Master warned us repeatedly not to dispute with other peaks’ disciples, but he already stirred up these troubles when he just entered the valley.”

The Admirable Sky Peak disciples were dissatisfied. Although Ye Qingtang entered the valley for days, she rarely appeared before them. Thus, although they had seen her face, they did not have any contact with her.
