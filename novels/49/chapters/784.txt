Chapter 785 Uninterested (2)

It was rare for Qin Chen to show favor to someone in the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Upon seeing Qin Chen’s behavior, the citizens in the surrounding were increasingly curious of Ye Qingtang’s identity.

What exactly was this pretty young man’s skills for the premier’s son to be so courteous to?

Qu Xiangyang laughed coldly as he watched the scene before him.

“Birds of a feather.”

Qu Xiangyang shot a look at Qu Xiangyang and said coldly, “You’re a criminal and don’t have a right to speak. Do I need to pluck out your tongue first for you to shut up?”

Qu Xiangyang narrowed his eyes. “You all fooled the new Emperor and brought disaster to the state’s affairs. Why can’t I say! If my lord were still here, she would never allow you treacherous officials to rebel!”

“Ha! Your lord? That woman you’re talking about is already dead somewhere. It is simply ridiculous for a pregnant lady to parade about ostentatiously and interfere with the state affairs. Only useless trash like you would still be thinking of that missing woman.” Qin Chen snickered.

“I’ll order someone to cut your tongue right now. I want to see whether your shameless lord will come and rescue you.” He continued.

Afterward, Qin Chen looked at a guard beside him.

Those guards immediately unsheathed their swords, walked straight to the jail wagon, and raised their hands, wanting to cut Qu Xiangyang’s tongue.

“Heaven has eyes. It will definitely not let Nine Nights Dynasty become a toy in the hands of someone like you all. Even if I die, I still want to see your Qin family’s downfall from the underworld!” Qu Xiangyang bore the hopeless situation as he looked up at the sky with a straight face.

Qin Chen ordered coldly. “Cut his tongue immediately.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

A few guards opened Qu Xiangyang’s mouth and pulled his tongue out while another guard waved a sword down!

But right before the sword landed, a figure suddenly flashed by Qin Chen.

It rushed to the jail wagon as fast as a bolt of lightning

In just an instant, an extremely overbearing aura exploded from the jail wagon, and the guards beside it were hurled away!

In the next second, Ye Qingtang stood on the jail wagon steadily.

“Young Sir Ye? What are you doing?!” Qin Chen looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief. His eyes were flooded with shock.

Ye Qingtang looked at Qin Chen coldly.

“Qin Chen, I’ll give you my reply right now. Making friends with your Qin family? I’m uninterested.”

The moment Ye Qingtang finished speaking, she stamped on the top of the jail wagon abruptly with a foot, and the indestructible jail wagon was broken into pieces the moment her foot landed!

Qu Xiangyang’s face was filled with surprise as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who suddenly rescued him.

Ye Qingtang lifted a hand and broke the thick metal chains around Qu Xiangyang.

“Young Sir, you are…” Qu Xiangyang found it hard to believe that he actually regained freedom.

Ye Qingtang replied. “Since you’ve followed your lord, don’t throw her face. It is too filthy to die in the hands of this kind of person.”

Ye Qingtang originally did not intend to be nosy, but Qu Xiangyang once served her mother.

Qin Chen was dumbfounded and did not know how he offended Ye Qingtang.

Only the Blood Moon Elder from aside was well aware. Looking at the appalled Qin Chen, the Blood Moon Elder had already viewed him as a dead person.

He had seen people who did not want their lives anymore, but not one who was so hurried to court death.

He called Holy Lady’s mother a shameless woman?

And even wanted to kill her mother’s subordinate?
