Chapter 1922: Unleash The Demon Dragon (1)

Ming Di was clearly pleased by Ye Qingtang’s change of heart.

Back when Ming Di had fought alongside the Holy Lord of Shadows, Ming Wang and Ming Gu had not even been born. Ming Di was the one who had spent the longest time with the Holy Lord and their relationship was the deepest.

If they had not clashed over the way to handle the Central Mainland, their relationship would have developed even further.

Ye Qingtang heaved a secret sigh of relief when she saw that Ming Di was appeased.

It looked like her method was right.

Seeing the change in Ming Di’s mood, Ye Qingtang took the opportunity to continue.

“Ming Di, I want to change my ways. I used to place restraints on your actions, but now, I want to allow you free reign in the unification of the entire Central Mainland.”

A piercing stare was directed towards Ye Qingtang.

“Mo Yao, you have changed after so many years.”

Ye Qingtang was startled. Could Ming Di have discovered her true identity?

Before Ye Qingtang could react, Ming Di raised his head.

“You have finally become smarter.”

Ye Qingtang, “...”

Damn, this demon dragon was really arrogant. To think she had been so worried that her identity had been exposed...

“We wouldn’t have fallen out if you had been this smart in the past. Do you know what a terrible time I’ve had in this abyss prison over the past ten thousand years?” Ming Di asked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

It definitely bore a grudge.

Ye Qingtang knew what Ming Di was thinking and she put on an apologetic expression.

“You must have suffered a lot all these years.”

“Humph, glad that you know.” Ming Di snorted. “Are you sure you understand?”

“Of course.”

“So you won’t object again if I kill off all the people in Central Mainland?” Ming Di narrowed his eyes.

“I already told you that your method is the correct one,” Ye Qingtang replied simply.

Ming Di looked very pleased. It roared in approval and the abyss prison vibrated with its booming howl.

“Very good, Mo Yao. You will soon realize what a great decision you have made in letting me leave this abyss prison. You and me both, we will conquer the entire Central Mainland. From now on, the Undead Clan will be the only living creatures in this mainland.” Ming Di’s voice was full of viciousness.

Although it had already suppressed its energy, Ye Qingtang’s heart still felt chilled by its aura. She tried to compose herself before speaking.

“That is good. But now, we have an enemy whom we have to get rid of first.”

“Enemy?” Ming Di asked.

“Ming Di, you have been inside for too long and don’t know of the changes in Central Mainland. Not long ago, a mysterious youth in Central Mainland came to challenge the Temple of Shadows...” Ye Qingtang told Ming Di of the whole incident, making sure to exaggerate certain details.

She glossed over her reason for not destroying the youth then and there, before quickly emphasizing how the enemy had completely disregarded the Temple of Shadows.

From what Ming Gu had said before, Ming Di was violent and bad-tempered, but he was the one who had built the Temple of Shadows together with the Holy Lord. Based on that alone, Ye Qingtang believed that Ming Di would never allow anyone to belittle the Temple of Shadows.

As expected, Ming Di flew into a great rage after listening to Ye Qingtang’s narration.

“How dare he! How dare a mere human disparage the temple! Mo Yao, you were too soft-hearted. That stinking bug should have been immediately torn to pieces and squashed to death!”
