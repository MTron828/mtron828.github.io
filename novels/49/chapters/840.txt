Chapter 841 You Are Reborn

“Play a game…”

Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed slightly after she heard Ling Yan. “Young Sir Ling Yan, your martial skills are only at Martial Qi Level Three while I am already a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. It is extremely easy if I want to kill you. Are you really not afraid that I would kill you if you talk to me with this attitude?”

However, Ling Yan shook his head immediately. “You don’t dare to.”

“I don’t dare to?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered, and a murderous glint emerged.

“There’s no need to test me.” Ling Yan patted Ye Qingtang’s left shoulder and said. “Since you’re from this mainland, family clan, sect, and everything you care about is here. If you kill me, everything you care about will be destroyed and turned into dust. Who would take such a huge risk because of a stranger that he has never met before?”

Ye Qingtang sighed, and her grip on the sword handle loosened immediately.

Noticing it, Ling Yan laughed and said, “So our game should have begun already.”

“Young Sir Ling Yan, what do you mean by playing a game?” Ye Qingtang questioned.

“First, let me confirm… your identity.” Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Identity?” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

It was the first time Ling Yan came to this mainland and also the first time he met her. No matter how smart Ling Yan was, he would definitely be unable to see through her identity.

“Are you…” Ling Yan scanned Ye Qingtang for a long time before continuing. “reborn?”

“WHAT?!”

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang unsheathed her sword immediately and stared at Ling Yan in shock.

“Oh… this action… It seems that I guessed correctly?” Ling Yan smiled.

Ye Qingtang kept her sword and reorganized her emotions. “What are you talking about, Young Sir Ling Yan? I don’t understand what reborn is. Please resolve my confusion, Young Sir Ling Yan.”

“Nothing much. I was just making a joke casually. You don’t need to take it seriously, Miss.” Ling Yan smiled.

The current Ye Qingtang had already resumed her female appearance.

“I believe you will confess your identity to me on your own later on.” Ling Yan added.

Not waiting for Ye Qingtang to speak, Ling Yan asked, “Aren’t you curious how I know that you are reborn?”

Surprise emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

This Ling Yan had long seen through one’s mind… RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“You don’t need to worry that this will leak out. I’ve closed the five senses of the elderly beside you, and your two spirit pets have already fallen asleep,” Ling Yan said.

Ye Qingtang looked at Master Du almost instinctively.

Indeed, Master Du stood rooted to the ground with a blank expression, as though he knew nothing about everything before him.

The little white tiger and little lightning dragon were already snoring.

“You must be thinking about how I know all of this and what motives I have exactly.” Ling Yan walked to a rock and sat on it casually.

“I really don’t know what you’re talking about.” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“Miss, looking from karma, you are fated to meet me,” Ling Yan said.

“Karma…” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

It was rumored that Ling Yan possessed the karma bloodline and could predict the causality of everything.

“Everyone said that life is predestined by the heavens. However, destiny is merely reaping the effect of whatever cause one sowed.” Ling Yan waved his right arm as he spoke.

In the next second, an illusory natal chart appeared before Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“Look. This is my karmic natal chart.” Ling Yan pointed at the illusory natal chart.
