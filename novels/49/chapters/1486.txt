Chapter 1487 Gathered From All Directions 2

Jiang Shangyu frowned and pondered, but waves of suffocating demonic air suddenly invaded the surroundings.Huge black shadows slowly roamed deeper into the Land of Infinite Demons through the thick fog as though there was something in there that was attracting them toward it.

“So many demonic creatures...” Jiang Shangyu frowned slightly. Although he could not see the faces of those hundred-meter tall black shadows, he could tell that there were many demon kings present from the powerful demonic air.

Swoosh!

A piercing sound sliced the repressive atmosphere. Numerous shadows suddenly flew past in the air above the Land of Infinite Demons and were actually headed in the same direction as those demon kings.

“Fifth great-uncle, is there something deep in the Land of Infinite Demons?” Jiang Shun was tempted.

Jiang Shangyu replied. “Let’s go and take a look.”

Jiang Shun and the others had a hesitant look. Several demon kings near them already headed there, and it was definitely an extremely terrifying force with so many demon kings gathered together.

“Nothing ventured, nothing gained. These demon kings were headed in the same direction, which means that there’s definitely something attracting them. The demon kings can sense great demons way better than us. Perhaps they have already found out where that great demon died,” Jiang Shangyu said in a deep voice.

Those demon kings would rush over as well when the great demon died, and once a scramble for the treasures began, it would be a bloody war across various clans.

“Everyone has to listen to my command. If anyone does not listen to my command when we enter deeper into the Land of Infinite Demons, no one will save you even if you die.” Jiang Shangyu instructed coldly.

“Understood.” All the Jiang Family members viewed Jiang Shangyu as their only leader.

Immediately, under Jiang Shangyu’s lead, everyone chased in the direction where the demon kings headed to.

“Tang Tang, you must be extremely careful. Follow me closely.” Jiang Xun warned Ye Qingtang seriously. Many demon kings had already appeared now, and this scramble would definitely be a violent one. In that situation, even she might not be able to protect herself.

Ye Qingtang nodded and remained beside Jiang Xun obediently.

Jiang Shangyu and the group followed right after the demon kings, but the closer they got to the depths of the Land of Infinite Demons, the more intense the demonic air in the surroundings.

The trees in the surroundings seemed to be nourished by this demonic air and were immensely tall.

Shaded by the tall mountains and trees, the thick fog was swept into the strong currents of the river. Black figures shuffled their way through at the foot of the high cliffs.

After following for half a day, Ye Qingtang and the rest finally saw a ray of light at a far corner of a dim and dense forest.

At the bottom of a waterfall among the successive mountains, an enormous frame was sprawled in between the cliffs of two tall mountains.

It was such a gigantic frame that seemed to reach the clouds, and its head and tail were out of sight. One could only see a small part of its body.

“That is... the great demon of the Frosty Snow Mountains?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes widened uncontrollably as she looked at the enormous creature afar.

The ‘great demon’ title induced fear.

Ye Qingtang only heard that the great demon of the Frosty Snow Mountains once swallowed millions of people. Now that she only saw the tip of the iceberg, it was already unimaginably enormous...

This great demon could swallow millions of living beings. Just its frame was already unbelievable, and the surrounding tall cliffs were actually no taller than that great demon lying down.
