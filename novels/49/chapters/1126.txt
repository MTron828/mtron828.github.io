Chapter 1127: A Fight Between Formidable Opponents (2)

The little azure dragon aside looked at Ling Yan and asked, “Did that person appear?”

“More or less.” Ling Yan replied with a laugh.

“Mhm… That’s bad…” The little azure dragon said, “Do you have any means to deal with him?”

“I’ll let my shell meet him. How about that?” Ling Yan looked at the little azure dragon and asked with a seeming smile.

“This… is fine, but… the shell does not have any thinking ability nor consciousness and only acts based on its instincts. How can you move it?” The little azure dragon was rather perplexed.

“You’re right… However, whose instincts does it have?” Ling Yan’s lips tugged up.

“Of course it’s the instincts that you left behind…” The little azure dragon replied.

“Since it is based on my instincts, the power of Karma will do the job.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Afterward, the Karmic Natal Chart appeared, and the intense power of karma surged into the sky instantly.

“Tsk tsk… Ling Yan, you’re actually doing so much for a girl… Could it be that you’re really attracted to her…” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan and could not refrain from teasing him.

Before Ling Yan could say anything, the little azure dragon continued speaking. “However, I must remind you that that person has appeared, and what he is about to do is not wrong actually. It’s fine for you to stop him, but there’s a pretext… And this pretext is that you must have absolute confidence to deal with the matters that Ye Qingtang will have to face after she survives.”

“If Miss Ye dies, it’s just another cycle… It’s ultimately unavoidable. Compared to avoidance, I much prefer going against the heavens,” said Ling Yan.

“I feel that… if Ye Qingtang dies…”

Nevertheless, before the little azure dragon could finish speaking, Ling Yan’s gaze turned icy, and the little azure dragon could not help but shudder.

“I don’t wish for you to say such things ever again. Do… you understand?” Ling Yan stared at the little azure dragon. Although there was a seeming smile on his face, his words seemed to be able to freeze everything in the world.

“Sigh… Man proposes, god disposes. Ling Yan, you’ve still fallen ultimately… So what even if you changed a shell… She and you are destined to have a doomed fate… It’s a curse.” The little azure dragon sighed.

Ling Yan chuckled out of a sudden and said, “I’ve always liked toying with and controlling fate… Have fate or Heavenly Dao ever had the right to control me?!”

“Forget it. I believe in your intelligence more. I just hope that you can truly go against the heavens and change your fate…” The little azure dragon said.

…

The northern region of the mainland, outside Wind Cloud City.

The Blood Moon Elder descended from the sky while panting and hurriedly looked at Ye Qingtang. “Holy Lady, I’ve checked. That demonic creature should be the guard of this Wind Cloud City. The most powerful person in this city now is only about Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven or so. We can massacre the city!

“Good.”

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang nodded and charged into Wind Clout City with the Blood Moon Elder and little white tiger.

The situation of Wind Cloud City was worse than that of Sky Stars City. Millions of lives were already devoured by that demonic creature, with only You Ancient Clan people remaining.

Time was limited. Without holding back, Ye Qingtang activated her Phoenix Bloodline and Ultimate Origin Skill to the maximum. Her body turned into a blazing flame, and all You Ancient Clan people in sight were slaughtered.

In just an hour, the hundreds of You Ancient Clan powerful figures and disciples were all slain by Ye Qingtang.
