Chapter 1912: Enemy Attack (3)

“What?”

Ye Qingtang’s heart pounded so loudly she could hear the thrum reverberating against her chest. She never expected to come face to face with the murderer of the Jiang family at this juncture!

And this person was powerful beyond belief!

The Undead Clan of the Temple of Shadows bristled with malevolence as they witnessed the scene. Even so, they knew very well that they were no match for this youth.

Within seconds, all the undead turned their eyes toward Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

She was also feeling very lost...

Even Ming Wang was no match for him. How the hell was she supposed to defeat him?

But Ye Qingtang had no idea what this person was looking for. He didn’t make himself clear.

Or perhaps, the real Holy Lord of Shadows would know what this person was hinting at. But... Ye Qingtang didn’t know.

“Holy Lord, just hand over the item. Unless... you want me to destroy your entire temple before you are forced to do so?” The effeminate-looking youth had already reached the end of his patience.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ming Wang, who was still trapped by the icicles. She felt very anxious but had to pretend to appear calm and confident.

“You want it?” Ye Qingtang spoke in a mild manner.

“That’s right,” said the youth.

“Sure. If you can knock me over with one blow, I will hand over the item to you,” Ye Qingtang stated.

The effeminate-looking youth was momentarily taken aback. He never expected Ye Qingtang to make such a proposition.

“What are you trying to do?” The youth looked bewildered.

A smile crossed her face. “I am not trying to do anything. I just want to see if you are a worthy opponent for me. I will let you make the first move. If you manage to injure me with that one move, I will concede defeat. But if you can’t...”

Ye Qingtang’s words were unexpected. The effeminate-looking had no idea what her underlying intentions were.

Nevertheless...

“No problem. But... let’s make one thing clear. You’d better not turn out like the clan chief of the Nanlin Clan—dying on me after just one move. I don’t want to waste my time finding the item.” The youth was very confident in his abilities.

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank.

This youth was indeed the murderer behind the recent massacre of the ancient clans.

“Are you mad? You are no match for him at all!” Little White Tiger growled. It was as jumpy as an ant on a hot stove when it heard Ye Qingtang’s suicidal preposition.

Ye Qingtang shot Little White Tiger a look that clearly meant for it to calm down, before stepping forward.

Trapped by the icicles pierced through his body, Ming Wang was in agony. He wanted to speak when he saw Ye Qingtang step forward but was unable to move a muscle.

“Holy Lord, this young punk has very strange abilities,” Lady Ghost whispered.

Ye Qingtang gave a slight nod. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

She stood before the youth with a mild smile, looking both gracious and benevolent.

“Please make your move.”

As the effeminate-looking youth gazed at the Holy Lord of Shadows, the one touted as the most powerful being in the entire mainland, the silver glint in his eyes spread out and overtook his pupils, turning his eyes a stunning shade of silver. His aura increased by several times, becoming even more powerful and oppressive than before.

In the next second, the youth suddenly burst out in lavender flames as he struck out at Ye Qingtang!

A tremendous, earth-shattering power surged outward and barreled straight towards her.
