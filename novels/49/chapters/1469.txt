1470 The Familial Tradition of Protection 3

The Domain Monarch looked at the group of people expressionlessly and said, “How ridiculous.”

Everyone was alarmed.

“Regardless of what happened before, both of them are back in the Jiang Family now and share the bloodline of the same clan. Stop making a scene.”

“Father...” Jiang Lang heard the Domain Monarch’s meaning and wanted to say something.

Domain Monarch cast him a look. “Do you not understand what I said?”

Jiang Lang clenched his fists secretly and gritted his teeth.

Ye You heaved a huge sigh of relief, and delight filled her.

“Second brother, father has already spoken. Are you still going to cause trouble without reason? This has nothing to do with You from the start, but you all even injured Yiming, and all his cultivation base is gone.” Jiang Qin immediately spoke about Jiang Yiming in hopes that the Domain Monarch would be infuriated.

“I will look for people to treat Yiming’s injuries. There’s no need to mention this incident anymore,” said the Domain Monarch in a deep voice.

Although the Domain Monarch said he would look for people to treat the injuries, the Domain Monarch did not say anything about punishing Mo Yi, the culprit.

Jiang Qin was dumbstruck. Even Jiang Shun did not expect such an outcome.

Was Mo Yi’s crime passed over just like that?

“But...” Jiang Qin still wanted to say something, but with a look from the Domain Monarch, the remaining words were stuck in her throat, and she did not dare to utter another word.

“You,” the Domain Monarch said suddenly.

Ye You looked up obediently.

The Domain Monarch said, “Apologize to her.” The Domain Monarch raised his finger and pointed at Ye Qingtang.

The spirit root was in Ye You’s body now, and the Domain Monarch neither wanted to dig Ye You’s spirit root out to return to Ye Qingtang nor hoped to see his children continue fighting over this matter.

Ye You was dumbfounded.

Ye Qingtang was relieved when she heard the Domain Monarch.

This Domain Monarch handled the situation impartially and was not biased to any party. This was the best outcome.

Ye Qingtang did not think that the Domain Monarch would really agree with Jiang Lang’s idea of digging out Ye You’s spirit root. After all, to the Domain Monarch, they were all his bloodline, and killing each other was strictly forbidden.

However, Ye Qingtang wanted to laugh as Ye You was made to apologize in public.

She would personally dig out Ye You’s spirit root sooner or later, and there was no hurry to do it now. Furthermore, she did not wish to implicate Jiang Lang and his wife because of this matter.

Ye You, who originally thought she could extricate herself from this incident, turned pale. She looked at Jiang Qin instinctively, who did not dare to speak much although she was dissatisfied.

The Domain Monarch has already spoken. Who could go against him?

Yield to Ye Qingtang in public?

And even apologize to her?

Just the thought of it made Ye You’s blood boil. Since young, she did not have any respect for Ye Qingtang and even looked down on her.

But now...

Ye You clenched her fists secretly. In the Domain Monarch’s presence, no matter how unwilling she was, she had no choice but to apologize.

Then, Ye You took a deep breath and wore an obedient expression.

“Yes, I’ll do as you say.”

Subsequently, Ye You turned around and walked toward Ye Qingtang as her head throbbed painfully at the sight of Ye Qingtang’s face. She took a few steps forward, but the words of apology seemed to be stuck in her throat and inflamed her throat.

Ye You’s acting ability was amazing; otherwise, she would not have been able to coax Jiang Qin to treat herself as her own daughter. However, the only person in this world who made her unable to keep up with the pretense was Ye Qingtang.

On what basis...

Must she apologize to Ye Qingtang?

While that was how she felt on the inside, she was under the watch of everyone. She looked down and tried her best to not look at Ye Qingtang’s face as her lips parted with struggle...
