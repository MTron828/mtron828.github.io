1485 The Mantis Stalks the Cicada, Unaware of the Oriole Behind 3

Although the Cloud Valley Clan had been greatly weakened, it could still fight. With the Jiang Family and the Southern Peak Clan holding each other in check, their chances of winning just increased a little.

In a one-on-one fight, they could tell who would win.

But in a three-way fight, no one was willing to strike the first blow. The family that stayed out of it while the other two fought would gain the advantage.

The three clan leaders present all understood this.

Right now, the Southern Peak Clan was the angriest. They had almost gotten the big demon but had not expected the Jiang Family to suddenly emerge and disrupt their plans.

At that moment, Jiang Shangyu was not in a good mood. He could have obtained the big demon with minimal effort, but now that Ye You had been discovered, their plan had to be brought forward.

“Since everyone’s goal is the same, why don’t we sit down and have a good talk?” Elder Yun from the Cloud Valley Clan said suddenly.

Talk your head!

The men from the Southern Peak Clan just wanted to strangle the Cloud Valley Clan. However, if they and the Cloud Valley Clan fought to the bitter end, the Jiang Family would win effortlessly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“What do you want to talk about?” Although the Southern Peak Clan was inwardly castigating the cunning Elder Yun, they had no choice but to compromise.

Even an idiot could tell that they had the edge over the Cloud Valley Clan. If they insisted on taking the body alone, they would certainly have to fight the Jiang Family.

The Jiang Family was currently at peak condition. The moment they started to fight, the Southern Peak Clan would probably lose.

Also, the Jiang Family had been hiding, which clearly revealed their intentions. Now, the Southern Peak Family had no choice but to stop the Cloud Valley Clan from leaving to maintain the balance of the situation.

Otherwise...

The moment the Cloud Valley Clan left, they would have to fight the Jiang Family to the end.

Right now, the Southern Peak Clan could still fight, but they had just been through an intense battle and would certainly be at a disadvantage in another fight.

After weighing up the situation, the two ancient clans that had been fighting bitterly now came to a consensus.

Elder Yun saw that Jiang Shangyu still did not speak and thought that he had silently agreed to the plan. So he said, “Our three families are all here for the big demon. Everyone should have a share. Why don’t we divide the big demon’s body and the grave goods into three equal shares, and everyone will take one share?”

“We want the entire big demon,” Jiang Shangyu said with a cold laugh.

The two ancient clans looked grim when they heard Jiang Shangyu’s words. At almost the same instant Jiang Shangyu finished speaking, the Jiang Family charged.

Within a moment, the three sides were embroiled in a fight.

Jiang Shangyu ordered Jiang Shun to bring some men to the big demon’s body while he led the rest to hamper the two clans.

The two clans had already sustained heavy losses. Now as they encountered the Jiang Family, they rapidly began to lose ground.

Jiang Shun and the others threaded through layers of mist and rushed towards the black figure. But when they reached the side of the black figure, they were stunned.

Lying before them was a demonic animal, dozens of meters in width. Although it was huge, it was not the legendary big demon.

Just as Jiang Shun and the others realized that this was not their goal, the earth beneath their feet suddenly started to shake.

A dull cry rang out like thunder, reaching everyone’s ears. The three sides that were fighting immediately stopped. They sensed an immense gush of demonic aura coming from somewhere nearby.

With that, everyone came to a consensus and stopped fighting.

The next second, a huge being that was nearby slowly started walking towards them.

This huge being was a hundred meters tall. They could not clearly see its features through the mist, but the entire ground shook with every step that it took.
