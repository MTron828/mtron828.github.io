Chapter 2731: The Second Tian (2)

“Very well. Since you both claim to be Di Jiuyuan’s children, I will give you two a chance.”

After saying that, Ye Qingtang raised her right arm and grabbed the man and woman.

Startled, the people of the Dragon Emperor Clan moved forward.

However, Ye Qingtang waved her left hand and an invisible wall of air kept everyone at bay.

Placing her palms on top of their heads, Ye wasted no time in reading their memories. In their memories, those two people were indeed Di Jiuyuan’s children.

“Memory modification?”

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly. No wonder the Dragon Emperor Clan was fooled. These two had cultivated some strange techniques that could modify their own memories. They themselves believed that they were Di Jiuyuan’s children. Even if others wanted to pry into their memories, they would not find any flaws.

Ye Qingtang shattered their divine powers and revealed their true forms.

“You’re from the Sky Vault Sect,” Ye Qingtang said calmly.

“How… how did you know!”

The young man stared at Ye Qingtang in shock.

Now that Ye Qingtang read their memories, they would not be able to hide anything from her.

Around them, the people of the Dragon Emperor Clan looked at each other in disbelief.

“Miss, why are you exposing them?”

One of the elders stared at Ye Qingtang expressionlessly. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Evil Deity Patriarch, you already knew?” One of the Dragon Emperor Clan members looked at the elder.

The elder nodded. “I just wanted to see what tricks the Sky Vault Sect had up their sleeves. What a pity.”

With that, the Evil Deity’s gaze landed on the imposters. In the next second, the two of them were engulfed by a black light.

“Did you just say that you are Di Jiuyuan’s daughter?” Evil Deity’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything and only took out a jade pendant.

The Evil Deity was surprised to see the jade pendant.

This jade pendant… was something that Di Jiuyuan always carried with her… he had personally given it to her when she came of age…

“This… can you let me take a closer look?” Evil Deity asked in surprise.

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang handed the jade pendant to Evil Deity.

“This is real. It really is Jiuyuan’s jade pendant!” Evil Deity looked at Ye Qingtang but quickly calmed himself.

“Evil Deity, this might be a trick by the Sky Vault Sect to gain your trust… We can’t trust her so easily!”

“Alright, I’ll prove it to you.”

As she spoke, Ye Qingtang’s body floated in the air. In the next second, Ye Qingtang’s eyes turned snow-white.

Swoosh!

She unsheathed her Destruction-level divine weapon and slashed at the air. It was as if doomsday had arrived, and the world was falling apart.

The sword beam slashed into the distance and disappeared without a trace.

A moment later, an earth-shattering sound rang out in the distance.

Far away, at the headquarters of the Sky Vault Sect, an apocalyptic sword beam suddenly shot over. In the blink of an eye, the Sky Vault Sect turned into nothing.

“What did you do?!”

Elder Long was shocked.

“I destroyed the Sky Vault Sect,” Ye Qingtang said.

“This…”

The people of the Dragon Emperor Clan were in disbelief.

The power of that attack just now… It was terrifying. If that attack landed on the Dragon Emperor Clan, they would probably… disappear forever.

“I’ll go and take a look.”

Elder Long said softly to Evil Deity before disappearing.

About an hour later, Elder Long returned.

“How is it?” The Evil God asked.

“The Sky Vault Gate has been utterly destroyed…” Elder Long said in shock.

“You… were you the one who ascended to the Immortal Emperor level earlier?!”
