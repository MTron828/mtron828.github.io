Chapter 1522 Ten Thousand Years 1

“I’m afraid I’m unable to break open the boundary the gods laid,” Ye Qingtang said.

So many of them were supreme powerful figures and could not do a thing about this boundary. What could she, someone at the Arcane Supremacy Eighth Heaven, do?

“That’s not true. This boundary cannot be opened from the inside but is easily opened from the outside. You can look at the waterfall behind you. In the depths of the water under the waterfall, there is a boundary stone left behind by the gods. As long as you destroy it, this boundary will disappear,” Fu Xu said.

The powerful figures wanted to puke blood at just the thought of the way to close this boundary.

Even a middle-aged man with no martial background could easily destroy that boundary stone, but helplessly, all of them were trapped within the boundary and simply could not get out.

Over these ten thousand years, they were always waiting for someone to enter this place to break the boundary stone and return them their freedom.

But after ten thousand years of waiting...

Ye Qingtang was the only human they saw.

“You all are locked here by the gods,” Ye Qingtang said suddenly.

“Yes.” The people did not really understand her.

“The gods locked you all here as a punishment. If I let you all out, won’t the gods lock me in together as well?” Ye Qingtang spoke slowly while looking at them.

She did not expect to meet this group of people here, and the reason why she did not leave immediately was because first, she was curious; second, the Jiang Family’s Domain Monarch Founder, Jiang Yu, was among this group of people.

Ye Qingtang’s current situation in the Jiang Family was far from optimistic. Although the current Domain Monarch was impartial, there were many nasty characters in the Jiang Family, and Jiang Lang and Mo Yi probably would not have an easy life.

In contrast, Jiang Yu was the most revered senior of the Jiang Family. If she could rescue him out...

Who are Jiang Qin and Jiang Shangyu compared to the founder? Won’t they still need to yield obediently?

Although Ye Qingtang did wish to rescue Jiang Yu, she did not show it right now. Anyway, her clothes were tainted red from the Great Demon’s blood, and the Jiang Family’s totem could not be seen.

“Don’t worry. The gods left after locking us here. Otherwise, we would not have been able to live until now.” Everyone explained immediately in fear that Ye Qingtang would really abandon them.

“Are you all speaking the truth?” Ye Qingtang put on a suspicious front.

“Absolutely.” The group nodded.

“But even if the gods left, this place is also filled with danger everywhere...” Ye Qingtang spoke slowly.

Before Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, Emperor Yan frowned and said, “So long-winded. Forget it if you don’t dare. You just need to tell my subordinates that I am here, and they will naturally come.”

Emperor Yan had a look of impatience.

Yet, Ye Qingtang poured cold water on Emperor Yan. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Even if I told them, I reckon they won’t dare to enter.”

“What do you mean?” Emperor Yan furrowed his brows.

“How long have you all been here?” Ye Qingtang asked him back instead of answering.

Emperor Yan evidently lost all his patience and did not reply to Ye Qingtang after taking a glance at her. Rather, it was Jiang Yu who replied slowly. “It has already been ten thousand years.”

Ye Qingtang replied. “Ten thousand years... Do you all know what this place is right now?”

“Obviously the sacred land in the Land of Infinite Demons.”

Ye Qingtang was silent.

“Ten thousand years ago, this place may be the sacred land in the Land of Infinite Demons where many powerful figures fought. But now, this place has become the forbidden area in the Land of Infinite Demons, and almost no one dares to lay foot in it. I guess this place has turned into a cursed area because of the gods’ curse, and anyone who entered basically died without exception. Even if I let out the news that you all are here, I’m afraid no one will dare to enter.” Ye Qingtang explained earnestly.
