Chapter 1569 Oh My 2

The lady’s eyes were filled with contempt as she scanned the people in the square in a disdainful manner. “I’m not interested in wasting time with you all. You better call Jiang Yu out obediently.”

All the elders’ and disciples’ faces darkened.

“Insolent. If you don’t know what’s good for you, don’t blame me for being impolite.” Thinking that she was just a crazy woman, Elder Kun completely lost his patience. He immediately bolted toward her and aimed a blow at that lady in the red.

The lady in red did not have any change in expression. Looking at Elder Kun who lunged toward her, she simply lifted her hand slowly and pointed a finger straight at Elder Kun.

Elder Kun seemed to be stopped by a powerful force and was immediately frozen in midair!

“What!” Elder Kun’s expression changed slightly.

The lady waved her finger impatiently...

Boom!

With a loud crash, Elder Kun was flung in the direction of the lady’s finger movement.

Everyone in the square was dumbfounded.

Elder Kun is pretty skilled, yet he’s so vulnerable when facing this lady?

That lady sent Elder Kun flying with just one finger?

“I have no time to waste with you all. Call Jiang Yu out or I will wreck Taiyuan Valley today!” The lady in red narrowed her eyes slightly and swung her sleeves. An overbearing sensation of pressure suddenly loomed over everyone’s head.

Even the elders were breaking out in cold sweat under this powerful pressure.

How does she have such terrifying power?

The lady’s slight revelation of her power already terrified everyone.

Everyone’s heart sank. This lady and the Domain Monarch Founder seemed to be acquainted for a long time, and at the thought that the Domain Monarch Founder’s acquaintances must all be top powerful figures, the elders immediately exchanged a look.

“We have offended you, senior. However, even if you want us to look for our Domain Monarch Founder, you need to tell us your name. Otherwise... how can we notify the Domain Monarch Founder?”

Realizing that the lady’s skills were way beyond all of them, the elders softened their tone at once.

The lady in red waved a hand and withdrew the pressure on everyone before responding. “Tell Jiang Yu that I, Xie Wushang, want to meet him.”

Elder Qian immediately went to notify Jiang Yu after hearing her name.

Currently, Jiang Yu had just passed down swordplay techniques to Ye Qingtang. He had intended to let Ye Qingtang try the four sets of techniques for him to see, but he noticed Elder Qian coming in hurriedly.

“Mhm? What is it?” Jiang Yu asked in a low voice.

Elder Qian immediately said, “Reporting Domain Monarch Founder, a lady wishes to meet you.”

“A lady wishes to meet me?” Jiang Yu furrowed his brows slightly and said coldly. “What lady is this! How demanding of her. Does she think she can meet me just because she wants to?”

Elder Qian replied. “She said... her name is Xie Wushang.”

Jiang Yu’s expression changed the moment Elder Qian spoke. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What did you say her name was?” Jiang Yu looked at Elder Qian strangely.

“Xie Wushang.”

Jiang Yu took a deep breath secretly and responded immediately. “I got it. Tell her that I will come in a while.”

Elder Qian did not suspect anything and immediately returned as he thought to himself, This Xie Wushang is indeed the Domain Monarch Founder’s old acquaintance.

Once Elder Qian left, Jiang Yu’s expression turned ugly immediately.

You Qiong noticed Jiang Yu’s expression and could not help but laugh. “This Xie Wushang is truly infatuated with you. She has already chased you for over ten thousand years and is even able to find this place now!”
