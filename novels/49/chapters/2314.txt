Chapter 2315: Masochist (4)

A shadow approached Qin Xuan who instinctively looked up. When he did, he saw Qin Feng standing over him.

Qin Feng had his back to the sun and his cold features were encased in shadows, masking his expression. He looked like he was surrounded by a golden halo, and was exuding an aura which made Qin Xuan’s scalp turn numb.

This was…

Divine Lord stage?

How was that possible!!

How did Qin Feng reach the Divine Lord stage?!

A deadly silence descended across the entire arena. Everyone’s eyes were focused on Qin Feng’s tall, strapping figure. In one section of the audience, surprise surfaced on Gu Wei’s face. He took a step forward as his gaze remained fixed upon Qin Feng.

That aura.

It could only be the Divine Lord stage.

No one expected this teenager, who had fallen from his high pedestal over the past several years, to climb back up to the peak again, right in front of everyone!

“Are you… kidding me… Qin Feng is at the Divine Lord level?”

“Divine Lord level? That’s not all. Did you see how Qin Xuan could not even sit up after that kick? Qin Xuan is also a Divine Lord level, but he was unable to defend himself at all against Qin Feng. This means that… Qin Feng is at least at the Divine Lord First Heaven peak stage?”

Everyone gasped at this surmisation.

Both were at the Divine Lord First Heaven stage, but the disparity between the early and the peak levels was extremely wide.

It could be said that to a Divine Lord First Heaven peak level practitioner, those at the early stage were nothing to him.

Lei Yan and the others gave a knowing smile at the scene.

Meanwhile, Hang Wenwei and Gong Jinyun subconsciously swallowed hard when they saw Qin Feng’s true powers.

Thank the heavens that Qin Feng wasn’t their opponent. Otherwise, wouldn’t they be paralyzed by that one kick?

Earlier, they had felt so ashamed at being defeated by Lei Yan and the others. But now, they were filled with relief. They could still walk off the platform on their own after being beaten by a First Heaven early-stage practitioner. If it had been a peak stage…

Haha…

They would have to be carried off!

At this moment, Hang Wenwei and the others were gazing at Qin Xuan with sympathetic eyes.

It was alright for them. After all, they had been challenged and had not volunteered to fight. It was not that humiliating to have lost.

But for Qin Xuan…

He had offered himself up for the thrashing. Qin Feng had no intention of challenging him but Qin Xuan had bustled up himself and even insulted Qin Feng’s beloved Boss.

They had seen people with a death wish before, but none as foolhardy as this teenager…

Qin Xuan remained kneeling on the platform. He wanted to stand up but was immobilized from the excruciating pain.

He lifted his head and looked at Qin Feng, who was standing before him. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, it was like they had returned to years ago, when he could only gaze up at Qin Feng’s tall, proud figure with admiration and jealousy.

“I-Impossible. How could I… I have lost to you…” Qin Xuan gritted his teeth.

In his current state, he didn’t even have the strength to stand up.

It was clear who won and who had lost.

“You have lost.” Qin Feng spoke coldly as he peered down imperiously at the pathetic-looking Qin Xuan.

Qin Xuan was like a possessed man.

“I will not lose, I…”

Before Qin Xuan could complete his sentence, Qin Feng reached out and grabbed him by the head.

Qin Xuan was stunned.

In the next second, Qin Feng lifted Qin Xuan’s whole body off the ground. In front of everyone, he carried Qin Xuan by the head over to the side of the platform where Ye Qing was standing below.
