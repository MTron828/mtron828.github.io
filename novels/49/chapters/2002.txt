Chapter 2003: Good Show (4)

“Cut the crap. Hand over the Netherworld Ring,” Bai Zhi said.

Elder Mo could only sigh. “This entire situation is a misunderstanding. We didn’t know that the Netherworld Ring belonged to the Crimson League. Since it’s a misunderstanding, we certainly have to return the Netherworld Ring to its owner.”

With that, Elder Mo took out the Netherworld Ring and handed it to Bai Zhi.

They would suffer grave losses if they were to provoke the Crimson League just because of the Netherworld Ring.

Bai Zhi revealed a look of satisfaction when the ring was handed over to her.

“You are very sensible.”

Bai Zhi didn’t bother wasting any more time with Elder Mo once she got the ring from him. She turned around to leave the place.

After all, she only wanted the Netherworld Ring.

Xue Fu also left, leaving the dumbfounded Ye Qingtang behind. Ye Qingtang was waiting to watch a good show but nothing actually happened.

“Bai Zhi left without even checking it?” Ye Qingtang looked in Bai Zhi’s direction. She had already flown far away.

Wasn’t she supposed to check it and get into a fight with them? She had already mentally prepared herself for that.

When Ling Yan saw the lifeless expression on Ye Qingtang’s face, he couldn’t help but let out a chuckle.

“Miss Ye.”

“What’s the matter?”

“Only the person in the black robes can authenticate the Netherworld Ring,” Ling Yan reminded.

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“The person in the black robes has a strong death aura, I presume he is of demon blood. Miss Ye, don’t worry. I’m sure the Crimson League is capable of authenticating it.” Ling Yan tried to comfort Ye Qingtang when he noticed her disappointment.

Ye Qingtang didn’t move.

“I’ll be waiting.”

“...” Ling Yan couldn’t help but laugh.

...

Bai Zhi flew back to the Frost Abyss in the shortest time possible.

Inside the Fox Demon’s cave. The person in black robes and the porcelain man were discussing something with the Fox Demon. When they noticed Bai Zhi’s arrival, they stopped talking about it.

“How was it?” the person in black robes asked.

“How could it possibly go wrong? The Ancient You Clan didn’t dare hesitate at all. They returned the Netherworld Ring just like that.” Bai Zhi put the box containing the Netherworld Ring down on the table and casually sat down.

“How dare Mo Yao say that the Ancient You Clan is eying the Crimson League? That’s a complete joke. You would have seen how intimidated the Ancient You Clan was if you were there. When they heard of the Crimson League, they probably wet their pants. How dare these cowards even try to compete with the Crimson League?” Bai Zhi scoffed.

“The Ancient You Clan was fearful?” The porcelain man’s face didn’t move even a bit when he asked.

“Of course.”

“It seems like Mo Yao might not have spoken the truth. Thankfully, we have the Netherworld Ring in our hands now. What about the Temple of Shadows?” The porcelain man asked the person in black robes.

The person in black robes didn’t answer. He opened the box containing the Netherworld Ring and took the ring out, placing it around his finger.

When the person in black robes stretched his hand out, his hand didn’t look like a hand at all. It was just a ball of black smoke, forming the shape of a hand. There was no skin, no bones.

When the person in black robes put the ring on his finger, huge gusts of black smoke rushed out from his black robe. The smoke rushed towards the Netherworld Ring.

Right when the black smoke rushed towards the Netherworld Ring, the Netherworld Ring made a crisp sound.

The ring shattered in the next moment!
