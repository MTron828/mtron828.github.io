Chapter 914 Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix (2)

A hundred meters away from the spring laid a route that everyone had to pass through. It was covered by a pale red screen. To contest for the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, one must first obtain the recognition from the Divine Phoenix. Otherwise, one would not even have the qualifications to contest for the inheritance, much less obtain it.

A moment later, Ye Qingtang calmly walked towards the pale red screen with great strides.

In just an instant, Ye Qingtang passed through the screen.

Many were surprised by what they saw. This lady… actually obtained the Divine Phoenix’s recognition so easily?!

Amongst them, there were people who even tried over ten times before barely passing through the screen…

“It’s you?!”

After Ye Qingtang entered the screen, Yin Yang Child recognized her at first sight.

Yin Yang Child immediately stood up and glared at Ye Qingtang furiously.

Although Yin Yang Child’s skills were powerful, he was rather young-only about thirteen or fourteen-and thus he was half of Ye Qingtang’s height when he stood before Ye Qingtang.

“What happened, little fellow?” Ye Qingtang looked at Yin Yang Child and chuckled with smiles in her eyes.

“What… did you say… Little fellow? Who are you calling little fellow!!”

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s address, Yin Yang Child was instantly taken aback. A long while later, his eyes twinkled with threat, and an intent to kill Ye Qingtang arose.

“Where exactly is my father’s Nine Sons Seized Souls book?! How dare you all trick me… and lead me to where Black and White Holy Son was!” Yin Yang Child shouted sternly as he glared at Ye Qingtang.

Just because of what Ling Yan said, he actually crossed paths with Black and White Holy Son when he was heading to find the Nine Sons Seized Souls book. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Yin Yang Child and Black and White Holy Son were foes, and both of them could be said to be like fire and water. Every time they met, they would be caught up in a long and intense fight.

Yet, Yin Yang Child’s skills were worse than Black and White Holy Son’s.

When both of them met a while ago, Yin Yang Child was almost killed by Black and White Holy Son…

Seeing Ye Qingtang right now, Yin Yang Child was obviously searing with fury!

Ye Qingtang indiscreetly glanced across the people in the screen, where she happened to see another figure.

That person was none other than Yin Yang Child’s enemy, Black and White Holy Son.

The two who were originally fire and water, however, remained within this screen safely.

Even after seeing how exasperated Yin Yang Child was, Black and White Holy Son remained at his spot far away, as though he did not have any intention to fight with Yin Yang Child at all.

A thought suddenly emerged in Ye Qingtang’s mind. Her eyes swept across the other people within the screen, and she understood the situation.

Subsequently, Ye Qingtang spoke plainly.

“I am not your father. You should ask your father if you want the Nine Sons Seized Souls book.” It was as though she was utterly ignorant of the murderous intent in Yin Yang Child’s eyes.

“It seems you have a death wish!”

Yin Yang Child was infuriated immediately. He condensed all his strength in his left palm and aimed towards Ye Qingtang’s glabella.

The power of this hit was extremely frightening, and even the sturdiest metals would be crushed into pieces by Yin Yang Child’s attack.

However, Ye Qingtang did not dodge or avoid Yin Yang Child’s attack, and an unknowing scoff played on her lips.

In a flash, Yin Yang Child’s palm landed violently, and a piercing sound lingered in the air.

However…

Just as Yin Yang Child’s palm was less than three inches away from Ye Qingtang, a scarlet gleam suddenly appeared from midair and pushed Yin Yang Child to the ground!
