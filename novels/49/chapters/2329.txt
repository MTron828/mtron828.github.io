Chapter 2330: Trust (2)

“Master?” Song Yanhan was startled by the arrival of the elder.

This elder was called Zhu Ning and was the most experienced teacher in the medicine faculty. He was also the most highly skilled alchemist in the entire faculty. Given his reputation in the medicine faculty, even the medicine faculty head or the Netherworld Academy President Wu Fengling had to give him some leeway. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

With Zhu Ning’s abilities, there was no need for him to remain in the academy. But he had a unique character and made a bet with Wu Fengling many years ago. After losing, he agreed to stay on in the Netherworld Academy as a teacher.

Zhu Ning’s criteria for selecting disciples were even more stringent than Wu Fengling’s. To date, he had only personally mentored two disciples.

One was Song Yanhan. The other was the legendary Grand Master alchemist.

Zhu Ning came to Song Yanhan’s side. His brows were furrowed and he appeared very impatient.

As Zhu Ning only taught Song Yanhan about elixir refinement, he seldom bothered himself about other matters. All he knew was that Song Yanhan was preparing to partner with a martial arts practitioner, but did not ask him whom he had chosen.

The arrogant Song Yanhan immediately put on a humble manner the moment he saw Zhu Ning.

“Master, the matter of partnership… there has been a hiccup.”

“What happened?” Zhu Ning asked.

Song Yanhan replied, “I was willing to partner with Qin Feng, but… Qin Feng’s teacher isn’t agreeable.”

With that, Song Yanhan looked at Ye Qing.

Zhu Ning’s face darkened before his eyes followed Song Yanhan’s line of sight. When he saw Ye Qing, his face did not betray any emotion.

“Why?” Zhu Ning asked.

Based on what Zhu Ning understood, no one in the entire academy was good enough to be Song Yanhan’s partner. Yet, this teacher was refusing to let his own students partner with Song Yanhan.

Ye Qingtang replied, “Qin Feng already has an alchemist partner.”

“Who?” Zhu Ning asked.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on Yun Chen.

“Yun Chen.”

Zhu Ning frowned when he heard that before he instinctively turned to look at Yun Chen.

“You are part of the medicine faculty?” Zhu Ning felt that Yun Chen looked very unfamiliar. He did not recall having such a student in the faculty.

“Master, Yun Chen does belong to our faculty, but… Master has probably never met him before as his elixir-refinement skills are too low. He has failed nearly every single one of the monthly tests.” Song Yanhan immediately spoke up.

Now and then, Zhu Ning would give pointers to students who showed talent. With Yun Chen’s skills, he had not been worthy to even stand before Zhu Ning.

It was no wonder Zhu Ning had no impression of him.

At that, Zhu Ning’s face darkened.

“Why is a student of such low quality still in the in medicine faculty? Who is his teacher? Why haven’t we kicked him out?”

An alchemist who couldn’t refine elixirs? What a joke!

Song Yanhan gave a secret smile.

“I am Yun Chen’s teacher.”

Zhu Ning looked at Ye Qing with his brows slightly furrowed.

“You are not a teacher from the medicine faculty.”

“That’s right. I am Ye Qing and just joined the academy recently,” Ye Qingtang replied.

Zhu Ning’s face darkened even further.

An alchemy student who could not refine any elixirs and a teacher who was not from the medicine faculty. What kind of combination was that?

It was a complete farce.

“You are his teacher? You are from another faculty, what can you teach him? This is ridiculous!” Zhu Ning had been obsessed with alchemy all his life. He could not tolerate people who treated alchemy as just a frivolous hobby!
