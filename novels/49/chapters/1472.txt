Chapter 1473 Land of Infinite Demons 2

There were many demons in the world, but those that could be called great demons were above ten thousand years old. Those great demons were extremely formidable, and the majority of the dharma treasures that once circulated in the world were stolen by the great demons and brought into the Land of Infinite Demons.

When they were alive, they reigned dominance and launched massacres. After they died, they possessed a myriad of treasures and buried them underground.

The people in the Central Mainland knew that treasures were buried underground with numerous great demons in the Land of Infinite Demons. If these treasures could be retrieved, they would be unfathomable. Regardless of which clan they were obtained by, it would allow the entire clan to hit the peak instantly.

However…

Despite the great temptation, the Land of Infinite Demons was exceptionally terrifying. Everlasting demonic air and numerous demonic creatures occupied the Land of Infinite Demons, and anyone who entered it would barely make it out alive.

Only the top ancient forces with strong foundations could enter the Land of Infinite Demons. Perhaps one could only enter with the leadership of extremely formidable seniors; otherwise, entering it would simply mean death.

The Land of Infinite Demons was not where numerous skeletons of great demons and funerary objects were buried, but it also took the lives of endless adventurers.

Millions of years had passed, and to date, no one knew where the boundary of the Land of Infinite Demons was. It was all the more unknown how many treasures were hidden and how many demonic creatures were gathered in this forbidden area.

One of the few forces in the Central Mainland that had the ability to enter the Land of Infinite Demons was the Jiang Family.

The Jiang Family could elect a powerful clan senior during a specified time to lead some clan members into the Land of Infinite Demons. This was to search for the treasures that were buried with the great demons as well as to toughen up the younger generation.

Both Jiang Xun and Jiang Lang had been through the Land of Infinite Demons training. Although many years had passed, even Jiang Lang could not refrain from frowning when the Land of Infinite Demons was mentioned.

“Aunt, are you leading the group this year?” Jiang Lang looked at Jiang Xun and asked curiously

Jiang Xun shook her head. “It’s your fifth great-uncle.”

“Fifth great-uncle?” Jiang Lang was slightly taken aback.

Jiang Lang’s fifth great-uncle was the Domain Monarch’s fifth uncle and was one generation older than Jiang Xun.

There were few seniors of Domain Monarch remaining as many of them lost their lives in the war with the Second Domain powerful figures back then. This fifth great-uncle was one of the elderlies who survived that war and was a clan senior in the Jiang Family now. Even the Domain Monarch had to treat him respectfully.

“My skills are sufficient to enter the Land of Infinite Demons alone. But if I have to lead a group of youngsters inside, how could I be able to hold up?” Jiang Xun was very clear about the danger of the Land of Infinite Demons.

To lead the clan members into the Land of Infinite Demons, the person’s skills must be top-notch. The Domain Monarch personally led the team a few years ago, but the Ancient You Clan was restless now, and he had to preside over the Jiang Family. Thus, the role of the leader naturally landed on the fifth great-uncle.

“Don’t worry about these already. Your fifth great-uncle has never paid any attention to you. You won’t have a share in the Land of Infinite Demons this year.” Jiang Xun scoffed, but she seemed to be comforting Jiang Lang from her tone. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Mo Yi is injured. You all can stay in the house to recuperate for these few days. Your father also said it already just now. Stay for some time first.” Jiang Xun added.

“However, after the conflict today, Jiang Qin and Jiang Shun should be thoroughly offended, and you all won’t have an easy time living in the Jiang Residence.” Jiang Xun frowned slightly, and she could not help but worry.

The pair of siblings did not dare to confront Jiang Lang’s family head-to-head before the Domain Monarch, but causing trouble secretly could irritate them.
