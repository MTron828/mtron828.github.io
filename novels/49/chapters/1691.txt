Chapter 1692: Breakthrough (3)

“Even Jiang Yanyun has failed. What can that Ye Qingtang do even if she turns up? She will just end up embarrassing the Jiang family once again.”

In the eyes of the other clans, Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai were the only two candidates from the Jiang family with potential. Now that Jiang Yanyun had already been defeated by Baili Xuanyun, who was ranked last in the previous competition, Ye Qingtang would just be another failure, even if she showed up.

A waste of time.

By now, the crowd had already disregarded Ye Qingtang. They were now entirely focused on the final results of the elimination battles.

“Is the Jiang family’s Ye Qingtang still competing? If she still doesn’t turn up, we will take it that she has forfeited her place.” The organizer of the competition frowned slightly. All the challengers have already completed their battles and they were just waiting for the results of the elimination rounds. There was no point in Ye Qingtang turning up anymore if she failed to show up now.

“Brother Yun, shall I go take a look?” Jiang Yiran couldn’t help feeling worried when he heard that Ye Qingtang was going to be disqualified.

Jiang Yanyun shook his head with a frown. He said rather weakly, “It’s best that she doesn’t come. You witnessed Baili Xuanyun’s powers just now. If Ye Qingtang really comes, she has no choice but to challenge one of the incumbent top ten. If even Baili Xuanyun has progressed to such a high level, the others would naturally...”

Jiang Yanyun didn’t finish his sentence but Jiang Yiran already knew what he meant.

If even Jiang Yanyun couldn’t defeat Baili Xuanyun, it would be a one-way road to hell for Ye Qingtang if she turned up now.

The Jiang family elders all looked very grim. They didn’t think that Ye Qingtang was good enough to enter the top ten, but her disqualification would make the Jiang family look bad.

Just as the organizer was about to speak up impatiently again, Elder Qian and Elder Kun hurried over in a flustered state. A slender figure appeared behind them.

“That little girl... she really came?” Jiang Yiran looked up and saw Ye Qingtang behind the two elders. The shock on his face was apparent.

Jiang Yanyun’s brows furrowed deeper.

Baili Xuanyun also noticed Ye Qingtang’s arrival and he instinctively glanced toward Mu Ruxue. As expected, Mu Ruxue immediately stood up when she saw Ye Qingtang. Her eyes were dead fixed upon Ye Qingtang.

“The Jiang family’s Ye Qingtang has arrived.” Elder Qian spoke up. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Elder Qian, you guys have finally returned.” The other elders of the Jiang family immediately went forward when they saw the two elders.

“What happened to Ye Qingtang? She knows today is the day of the challenge. Why did she arrive so late?” One of the Jiang family elders asked rather unhappily.

Elder Qian didn’t answer him. He just looked at Ye Qingtang. “Go on.”

Ye Qingtang nodded and leaped over to the side of the arena.

“Elder Qian, you are...” The other elders wanted to say something. But Elder Qian shook his head, discouraging them from asking any questions.

Displeasure flashed across the organizer’s eyes as he gazed at the tardy Ye Qingtang and he said stoically, “You are late. The elimination battles have already started. You have no choice but to challenge one of the six incumbents.”

Ye Qingtang nodded. As she cast a sweeping glance across the six fighters in the top ten seats, she also noticed Jiang Yanyun, who was receiving medical treatment at the side. Looking at Jiang Yanyun’s wretched state and observing Baili Xuanyun’s smug demeanor, she could already guess the outcome of their earlier fight.

Then she raised her head.

“I want to challenge Baili Xuanyun.”
