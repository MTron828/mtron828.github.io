Chapter 1026 Undermining The Foundation (1)

At that moment, Elder Yin and Elder Gu were completely stunned.

They looked with disbelief at the youth standing before them.

With just a wave of his hand, this youth had actually completely dispersed their half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord’s force.

“How… is that possible!”

Elder Yin was especially shocked. He was previously so confident, but now… his half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord’s force had been dispersed by an ordinary Ye Family disciple with a wave of his hand.

Just what level of cultivation had this youth achieved that he could instantly dissipate the force of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?!

“Oi… young man, what is your name?” Elder Gu of the Yunxiao Sect steadied himself and asked the youth with the cold expression.

“Are the two of your worthy of knowing my name?” The youth shouted coldly as he swept a glance at Elder Gu and Elder Yin.

When they heard the youth’s words, the two Yunxiao Sect elders were immediately enraged.

They were Yunxiao Sect elders of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. No matter where they went, everyone treated them with respect and spoke to them cautiously.

But this young fellow dared to speak to them so rudely!

“You’re merely a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord despite your old age, yet you dare to come to our Ye House with this kind of attitude. Yunxiao Sect elders are rubbish. I think you two old fellows are too ignorant and arrogant.” A clear female voice suddenly reached the ears of Elder Yin and Elder Gu.

The two Yunxiao Sect elders saw a beautiful young girl among the Ye Family members looking at them mockingly.

It was not just the girl, even the other Ye Family members were looking at the two world-famous super sect elders. Their eyes showed only disdain, with no trace of respect.

Elder Yin and Elder Gu had never been treated like that before. Their expressions darkened.

They thought of their lofty status in the YunXiao Sect where numerous disciples cudgeled their brains to think of a way to enter their sect, but now…

These Ye Family disciples dared to look at them so rudely!

Elder Yin and Elder Gu looked coldly at the numerous Ye Family disciples and immediately thought of making trouble for them.

However… the youth who spoke previously swiftly sensed the change in their expressions and did not give the two Yunxiao Sect elders any opportunity to make trouble. He directly aimed a heavy blow at them!

As the youth struck a blow, a blast of half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord force instantly shot up and spread in all directions. The spreading force immediately enclosed the two YunXiao Sect elders.

When they felt the impact of the force, both Elder Yin and Elder Gu were shocked.

They were both half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords but had not imagined that this youth’s martial strength would be on par with them, having attained the realm of half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

Even the top disciples of the Yunxiao Sect could not compare with him in terms of ability.

Only a few arrogant supernaturally talented youths in the Yunxiao Sect might be able to compare with him…

In addition, this youth was probably a little younger than those supernaturally talented youths in the Yunxiao Sect!

Elder Yin and Elder Gu immediately backed away from the force of the youth’s blow. They retreated to avoid his blow.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com
