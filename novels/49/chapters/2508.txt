Chapter 2509: Divine Concealment Reappears (5)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang would not be able to deal with any of the elders, let alone the Demon God with fiery eyes.

At that moment, the Demon God’s eyes turned towards Ye Qingtang and her group.

The Blood Moon Elder shuddered. “Holy Lady, that monster can’t see us, right… Aren’t we invisible now?”

“It may or may not have seen us.” The big yellow dog hid in Ye Qingtang’s arms and wagged its tail. “That fellow’s skills are not bad. In addition, this little girl is not that proficient in the Divine Concealment Spell. It is very normal for an expert to be able to see through us.”

“What should we do then!” The Blood Moon Elder panicked when he heard what the big yellow dog said. He did not want to have a face-to-face conversation with that monster.

“Leave it up to fate. I think someone like him would not stoop to slaughtering a dog.” The yellow dog seemed to be lost in thought.

“Brother Canine, you can’t think of it that way. Look at that monster. One look and you can tell he’s no angel. He’s definitely bloodthirsty. He definitely won’t let anybody off. Brother Canine, we are in dire straits. Please reveal yourself and converse with him, expert-to-expert,” the Blood Moon Elder looked at the big yellow dog anxiously.

In the Blood Moon Elder’s opinion, this was a dog that had killed an above-Emperor level monster in one strike. It was definitely someone worthy enough to engage that monster as an equal.

“I’m not going.” The big yellow dog instinctively shrank back.

“What’s the hurry?” Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. Weren’t they still alive?

Furthermore, they were still in their divine concealment state and had not been completely exposed. So what if that Demon God knew of their existence? If he could not see them, he would not be able to do anything. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Qingtang did not believe that the Demon God, as powerful as he was, could actually destroy them through space?

“Holy Lady, can I ask you something?” The Blood Moon Elder asked.

“Speak.” Ye Qingtang said.

“Do you have some sort of grudge with that monster?”

Ye Qingtang felt her head ache. What grudge? She did not even know him and had never even met him.

“No. This is also my first time seeing him,” Ye Qingtang replied honestly.

After hearing what Ye Qingtang said, the Blood Moon Elder nodded and smiled. “Holy Lady, look, here’s what I think. We have no grudge against that monster. We don’t know him and have never offended him. There might be some misunderstanding. How about this? Let us ask Brother Canine to talk to him and clear things up.”

The big yellow dog in Ye Qingtang’s arms immediately glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. “Can you still call yourself a man?”

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. To a certain extent, what the Blood Moon Elder said made sense.

They did not know each other. The Demon God had already been resurrected and no longer needed nourishment. Let alone, there was no deep grudge between them, so there was no need for him to capture them

“Why are you looking at me? Let me tell you. Even if you stare until your eyes pop out, I will not talk to that damn thing. I say, have you guys not figured out the situation? I’m just a dog.. Is it really appropriate for you two humans to push the burden to a dog?” The big yellow dog said hastily when it saw Ye Qingtang staring at it.
