1436 Slander 2

When a spirit root left its original owner, a resonance could still be detected using a special method if they met.

The reason why Ye You wanted to kill Ye Qingtang by all possible means was to completely erase this black history of hers.

As long as Ye Qingtang died, no one would know what she once did.

Although the spirit root was not as important in the Central Mainland, it was ultimately one of the foundations for cultivation. If Ye Qingtang was not part of the Jiang Family, the Jiang Family would not have any opinions even if Ye You dug her spirit root away and may instead feel that she deserved to do it.

However, things were different if Ye Qingtang was a member of the Jiang Family.

Hearing the certainty in Ye Qingtang’s words, Jiang Qin could not help but frown slightly and look at Ye You.

Frantic arose within Ye You. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

No one other than she herself was clearer of what would happen.

It would all be revealed once they tested it.

Ever since Ye You came to the Jiang Family, she had been putting on a gentle and obedient front, but the current matter…

Ye You went through all her options and knew that the outcome was the same no matter whether they tested it or not. Her eyes suddenly welled up with tears as she looked at Ye Qingtang with an aggrieved expression. “Tang Tang, I know you have never forgotten about the spirit root incident. I am very guilty as well.”

Ye You’s statement verified Ye Qingtang’s earlier accusation.

Jiang Liu and Elder Xu were astonished.

Previously, they thought that Ye Qingtang and Ye You were this way because of some conflicts and did not expect that their grudge actually began from snatching a spirit root.

What was even more unexpected was that…

The seemingly gentle and weak Ye You really snatched Ye Qingtang’s spirit root.

Ye You said subsequently, “Back then when grandfather dug your spirit root away and gave it to me, I did not even know that the spirit root was yours. If I knew it was yours, I definitely will not want it…”

Ye You knew that she was unable to hide from this matter and thus pushed all the blame to the Ye Family’s Great Elder.

Elder Xu and the rest were less agitated when they heard Ye You saying that it was the actions of the Ye Family’s Great Elder.

“Tang Tang, if you hate me because of this matter, I will return this spirit root to you in hopes that we can get along well in the future.” Ye You seemed to have made a firm decision as she suddenly unsheathed a dagger and stabbed at her abdomen, wanting to dig out the spirit root to return to Ye Qingtang.

Alarmed by Ye You’s actions, Jiang Qin hurriedly locked her wrist and took the dagger away.

“What are you doing, You? It’s just a spirit root. What’s the big deal? So be it if it’s stolen. Why must you harm your body over this incident again?” Jiang Qin was hurt to see Ye You like this, and she subsequently looked at Ye Qingtang with hatred.

“Ye Qingtang, you kept going against You just because of a spirit root? It’s just a spirit root. What’s the big deal? Don’t use You’s guilt towards you to act brashly.”

Ye Qingtang was tickled by Jiang Qin’s bandit logic.

When Ye You stole her spirit root, was opening her abdomen not considered harm?

Ye You had not even harmed herself now, but Jiang Qin was already this indignant.

Having someone’s backing was indeed different…

Ye Qingtang looked at Jiang Qin and said, “I’m afraid you’re wrong. She is the one who always targeted me and not the other way round. I was not the one who looked for her today, but Ye You led you to trouble me, right? Who exactly is the one who can’t let go of this matter?”
