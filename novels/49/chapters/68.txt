Chapter 69: The Birthday Banquet (6)

A candidate would usually be allowed to take the entry examinations, if he or she was referred by a powerful personage, such as Mu Su. But if said personage was to refer someone without a spirit root, that would definitely turn into the greatest joke of all time!

Even Mu Su faltered for a moment.

Ye Qingtang had no spirit root?

Ye Qingtang stood firmly at a side, whilst she faced the detestable Great Elder, who seemed intent on ruining her life once again, with a sneer in her mind.

The Great Elder admonished her in the next instant: “Qingtang, you’re too much! You can’t just take advantage of his Lordship’s generosity for your own selfish desires! You know full well it’ll be impossible for you to pass the entry examinations given your condition. You’re just going to get his Lordship into a lot of trouble!”

Mu Su had a complicated look on his face as he peered at Ye Qingtang and asked: “Is your spirit root really shattered? Are you still able to Reveal Thy Root?”

Reveal Thy Root is a method to project one’s inner spirit root via creating its replica on the palm of a hand, usually used for the root’s quality inspection. If Ye Qingtang had no spirit root, then she would not be able to perform this.

Ye Qingtang cast a sideways glance at the Great Elder before focusing on Mu Su and replied: “It shattered previously, but…. I can give it a try.”

Ye Qingtang stepped forward in the next moment, with her right palm exposed in the open.

A faint glow started accumulating in the palm of her hand.

“It’s working!” Everyone gasped in surprise.

Sure enough, once the glow flared into a dazzling light, it began to take the shape of a sapling, before it finally sprung into a full-fledged spirit root.

Once its shape stabilized, the replica started changing colors.

The quality of a spirit root could be determined by its respective color band in a visible spectrum.

And that encompassed the seven colors of a rainbow.

Going by red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet, the quality increases further down the order.

And what used to be Ye Qingtang’s spirit root, but robbed by Ye You, was recognized as blue.

Though there were still better ones like indigo or violet, but those two were considered rare findings that might only occur once in a millennium.

That said, a blue one was thus considered a good find in this current age, else the Cloud-breaker’s sovereign would never had recruited Ye You as a disciple. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

At this moment, everyone had their sights fixated on the replica in Ye Qingtang’s hand, and they were stunned.

The replica of a spirit root that emitted a reddish glow, hovered on the palm of her hand. Its form was perfect, without any sign of defects.

The Great Elder got the shock of his life when he saw that on her hand.

How is this possible?!

Ye Qingtang’s spirit root was certainly gouged out by Ye You right in front of his eyes!

How can she still possess one?!

“Didn’t you claim that her spirit root shattered?” The Second Elder had a perplexed look on his face as he directed his question at Ye Ling. When Ye Qingtang shattered her spirit root, the Second Elder was still in the midst of his sequestered training, thus he was unaware of the details.

Ye Ling gave him a blank look, “Her spirit root was indeed shattered, and her original was a blue one, but now, that’s a red one…. ”

A shattered spirit root was equivalent to losing all hopes of cultivating one’s prowess, and time had never told of growing one again after shattering it.

Mu Su observed the replica on Ye Qingtang’s hand and asked, “Was your spirit root really shattered?”

Ye Qingtang nodded explicitly.

This matter had surely piqued Mu Su’s curiosity. If Ye Qingtang had truly shattered her spirit root before, it would be impossible for her to possess the current one that showed no abnormality. With this in mind, Mu Su was promptly reminded of his true purpose for the trip, he contemplated on the matter before he spoke in an enigmatic manner: “Your case is truly a wonder, Miss Ye. If you have the time, may I invite you to come with me. Though I’m unable to unravel the mystery behind it, someone else might be able to. And in regards to granting you my referral, I’m more than happy to oblige.”
