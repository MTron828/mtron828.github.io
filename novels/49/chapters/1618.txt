Chapter 1619: Kingdom Protector (4)

The Supreme League King was emotionless as he watched the magnificently-dressed Monza King walk in.

On the other hand, the Monza King was full of smiles.

“Old friend, I heard that the Supreme League Kingdom’s protector appeared?” The Monza King spoke to the point after exchanging a few polite remarks.

Upon hearing that, the Supreme League King frowned discreetly, and his eyes swept past Ye Qingtang.

The Monza King sharply sensed the Supreme League King’s line of sight and immediately looked at the petite girl in the main hall.

“This is the Supreme League Kingdom’s protector, right? She’s actually so young. But it’s truly impressive that she could completely wipe out 500,000 soldiers from the allied forces at such an age.” The Monza King did not conceal his praises for Ye Qingtang and seemed to be very optimistic about her.

The Supreme League King’s expression was not too pleasant.

“What are you here for today?”

The Monza Kingdom had massive military strength, and even the past Supreme League King did not dare to offend him easily.

“Old friend, you’ve been fighting the allied forces for so long, and you should be short in military strength by now. I am here to gift you troops today.” the Monza King smiled while speaking.

“What do you mean?”

The Monza King smiled as he blatantly glanced at Ye Qingtang.

“Old friend, it is a cause for celebration that you found the protector. However, it is against the mainland’s convention for a Kingdom Protector to participate in the kingdom’s warfare. Truthfully speaking, all the kingdoms are already aware that you sent a protector into the war. Those who were originally in a neutral position are very dissatisfied with you over it and are prepared to join the allied forces to punish you.”

The Monza King paused for a moment before continuing. “I’m here today to make a deal with you. As long as you hand your Kingdom Protector to the Monza Kingdom, I will give you troops with thousands of soldiers. It should be sufficient for you to deal with the subsequent battles.

“Kingdom Protectors are forbidden from participating in warfares from the start. Even if you keep her, there is not much use for your coming battles. Why don’t you hand her over to the Monza Kingdom instead? We’re just helping each other to get what we want. You get the troops, and I get the Kingdom Protector. Then, your Supreme League Kingdom no longer has a Kingdom Protector, and other kingdoms do not have proof to reprimand you for violating the convention. Isn’t this a win-win?” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The Monza Kingdom had massive military strength, but like the past Supreme League Kingdom, there was a problem that plagued all kings...

They did not have a Kingdom Protector.

This was a sore point for the Monza King. Thus, he hurriedly rushed over after knowing that a Kingdom Protector appeared in the Supreme League Kingdom and even went into the battlefield.

A sinister look flashed across the Supreme League King’s eyes.

“You want to have our Kingdom Protector?”

“That’s right. If you feel that 1,000,000 soldiers are not enough, I can give you 2,000,000.” The Monza King simply dropped a shocking number.

“2,000,000? You’re really generous.” The Supreme League Kingdom laughed.

The Monza King’s eyes glistened. “Since you think that it’s appropriate, it’ll be fixed then!”

“From now on, you are the Monza Kingdom’s protector!”

“You’re wrong,” said the Supreme League King before lifting his chin slightly and sneering. “Tang will always be the Supreme League Kingdom’s protector. I am not interested in your troop of 2,000,000 soldiers. You can leave.”
