In an instant, Zhou Qu collapsed. His face turned extremely pale, and the expression he used to look at Ye Qingtang turned into boundless fear.

“Junior Sister… No! Lord Ye! I am wrong. I failed to recognize your formidability and spouted nonsense. Just treat me as a fart. I beg you to let me off, please. I will definitely work as a slave for you. I will do anything you ask of me!” Zhou Qu was utterly shocked.

At this instant, Zhou Qu finally realized how foolish he had been.

How scary was Ye Qingtang’s identity for her to be able to be the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s master?

Could it be that she was even the Blood Moon Sect’s Holy Lady!

At that thought, Zhou Qu was already frightened out of his wits. If he knew this before, he would definitely not dare to offend Ye Qingtang no matter what!

Zhou Qu begged in tears. If not for the fact that he was held by the two zombies, he would probably have kowtowed to Ye Qingtang and begged for mercy.

Ye Qingtang looked coldly at Zhou Qu, who was covered in tears and mucus. There was not a trace of pity in her eyes.

“Do anything I ask of you? Why? Are you not going to seek revenge for your older brother Zhou Xuan?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow.

Zhou Qu immediately shook his head like a rattle drum and frantically said, “My brother brought it to himself. Spare my life, Lord Ye! I really did not oppose you on purpose. It’s… It’s all the inner sect Ning Luo’s idea. He was the one who made me and my brother find a chance to get rid of you. It really has nothing to do with me! I am wrong!”

Zhou Qu wailed and directly pushed all the blame to Ning Luo, not daring to say that he had personal motives for opposing Ye Qingtang initially.

“Ning Luo…” Ye Qingtang frowned. She had heard of Ning Luo’s name in her previous life. He was the top genius in the inner sect of Xuanling Sect and was also the favorite disciple of the inner sect Sword Faction’s Elder. He was extremely talented.

However, Ye Qingtang did not cross paths with him in both her previous and current lifetimes. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Now, she had only entered Xuanling Sect for a few months. Why was it that… Ning Luo suddenly targeted her?

Ye Qingtang could not find an answer no matter how she thought.

Zhou Qu saw Ye Qingtang’s reaction and said hurriedly as though he clutched the last straw which could save his life, “It’s all Ning Luo. Right after you passed the sect assessment, Ning Luo sent someone to my brother and told him to kill you somehow. My brother and I are only outer sect disciples, but Ning Luo was an inner sect elite. Obviously, we didn’t dare to disobey his orders. Thus… Thus, we offended you… Please spare my life…”

Ye Qingtang looked down. After thinking over and over, she still did not know when she bred enmity with Ning Luo.

However…

Ye Qingtang looked up and fixed her eyes on Zhou Qu again. Her lips suddenly curled into a smile. “So I accused you?”

Zhou Qu swallowed his saliva, and his heart palpitated violently.

Ye Qingtang said, “Since it is so, I’ll give you a chance.”

Zhou Qu widened his eyes, and hope filled his eyes.

Then, Ye Qingtang looked away and continued. “I’ll give you a chance… to become a Blood Moon Sect Elder.”

Once Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, Zhou Qu gasped, and an ominous feeling rose within him.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang darted a look at the Blood Moon Sect Elder who had been waiting for a long time.

“Now, his body is yours.”

“No!!” Zhou Qu screamed in horror as the Blood Moon Sect Elder took a step forward and appeared before Zhou Qu.
