Chapter 2748: The Owner Of The Heart Of The Heavenly Dao (3)

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang arrived at the Black Tower from the Great Immortal Temple.

Ye Qingtang had never been able to enter this Black Tower. The repulsive force was too strong. However, Ye Qingtang sensed that the repulsive force of this Black Tower was growing weaker. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

She waited for a few days near the Black Tower until all the repulsive force disappeared before entering it.

“The Black Tower is a sham?”

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised. With a wave of her hand, the Black Tower instantly turned into nothingness and was replaced with a huge energy field!

And in the center of the energy field sat a woman. She looked as if she was absorbing the spirit energy of heaven and earth.

Ye Qingtang’s pupils constricted and disbelief surfaced in her eyes. “Sister Ah Yao?!”

The woman sitting in the center of the energy field was none other than the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon, Ah Yao. Who else could it be? Her aura was even identical to Ah Yao’s.

Ah Yao slowly opened her eyes.

However, Ye Qingtang was jolted when their eyes met.

Having long surpassed the level of the best in the lower realm. It had been a long time since Ye Qingtang felt a jolt just by meeting someone’s eyes.

It was as if she was not facing a mortal, but rather… the supreme Tian!

“You’re here.”

......

Ah Yao looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled.

“Sister Ah Yao… what is going on?”

Ye Qingtang stared at Ah Yao in disbelief.

Wasn’t Ah Yao already dead? If she wasn’t dead, how could she have been born?

“Ah Yao?” The woman seemed to be lost in thought, and then she shook her head. “I am not Ah Yao. No… to be precise, Ah Yao is you, and you are also Ah Yao, and both of you are me.”

“What do you mean?!”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply.

“Be it Ah Yao, you or me, we are… the same person,” Ah Yao said gently.

“We are the same person?” Ye Qingtang was increasingly puzzled.

“Yes.” Ah Yao nodded slightly.

“You will know after I explain.” Ah Yao’s gaze was profound. “Back then, my brother and I… were the candidates to become the next Tian. It was just that… we did not have enough Heavenly Dao energy. Therefore, my brother and I came to the lower realm and destroyed the Fourth Domain, stealing the Heavenly Dao energy… we had agreed to split it evenly. As for who would become the next Tian in the end, that would depend on luck… unfortunately, my brother ended up killing me. After I died, I injured my brother with the power of my supreme divine soul. I also snatched away most of the Heavenly Dao energy and hid it in my heart.”

Ye Qingtang was shocked. She… was one of the black shadows who destroyed the Fourth Domain back then. She single-handedly killed the Silver Star Holy Lord and the others…

Ah Yao continued, “Later, I extracted a small portion of my soul and let her reincarnate as a human. As for me, I hid here to continue strengthening my soul and keep it intact… later on, I discovered that the power in my heart needs to be cultivated before it can become stronger. Therefore, I placed my heart with the strongest person in the world then. There is a guide in my heart and I let the guide direct that person to meet up with my reincarnation. After that, my heart will return to my reincarnation, who will be a vessel to continue absorbing energy, making my heart stronger.”

“What are you saying…”

Ye Qingtang was shocked.
