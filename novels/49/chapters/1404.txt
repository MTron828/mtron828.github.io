1405 Leaving 1

“Since when has it been up to you to dictate my actions?” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes, and a layer of frostiness surfaced on her face.

The Goblin Tribe Leader was startled and said hurriedly, “I would not dare to be so presumptuous.”

Ye Qingtang grunted coldly and said, “I have my own plans.”

“Of course…” A film of cold sweat had surfaced on the Goblin Tribe Leader’s forehead.

The Crimson League was so large that no force in Central Mainland could compare to it. It was a league that belonged to the Second Domain.

The Crimson League was so selective that in the entire Temple of Shadows, only the Holy Lord of Shadows was worthy of its notice. So after the Holy Lord of Shadows vanished, the Crimson League simply kicked the Temple of Shadows out of the League.

The eight tribe leaders wanted to return to the league, but they knew they did not have the ability to move the League if Ye Qingtang did not act.

Ye Qingtang could guess what the eight tribe leaders were thinking.

Of course, it would be good if the Temple of Shadows could return to the Crimson League. But…

The Crimson League was filled with powerful figures from the Second Domain. Ye Qingtang might have been able to deceive these people from the Temple of Shadows, but she did not have the nerve to interact directly with the Crimson League.

She would not dare to risk this until her powers reached a certain level.

Although there was always an element of risk, the potential returns were huge.

Ye Qingtang remained in the Temple of Shadows, intending to use it as a tool to oppose the Ancient You Clan. If the Temple of Shadows could return to the Crimson League, then the chances of beating the Ancient You Clan and rescuing Little You Yun were much greater.

Ye Qingtang intended to do so, but not now.

The eight tribe leaders had been shocked by Ye Qingtang’s move. Although they appeared to be convinced, Ye Qingtang knew perfectly well that these tribe leaders harbored evil schemes that could not be dealt with so easily. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang sent them away while they were still in shock.

She was forcing herself to maintain a strong front, but she would be exposed before long.

The eight tribe leaders did not dare to go against Ye Qingtang’s wishes, so they left.

Ye Qingtang returned to her room and collapsed on the bed. Her robes were soaked in sweat.

“I can’t remain in the Temple of Shadows. I have to find a way to get out.” Ye Qingtang suddenly sat up. The suspicions of the eight tribe leaders had made Ye Qingtang even more aware of how dangerous her circumstances were.

She had been lucky this time. But she did not know if she would be as lucky next time.

Although she could cultivate in the Temple of Shadows, she could only do so secretly. She was doomed if the Undead Clan discovered her true abilities.

Also, she realized that although she could still use the immortal method of cultivation after returning, it seemed there was too much death aura in the Temple of Shadows, and she was unable to obtain sufficient natural spirit energy, so her speed of cultivation had slowed down greatly.

Enter the Illusory Void again?

Ye Qingtang felt that she needed to proceed slowly. Although the Illusory Void was a sacred ground of cultivation, that cheating God of Nature might still harm her at any time.

Ye Qingtang wanted to stabilize her cultivation base and raise her level of immortal cultivation before she entered the Illusory Void again.

She needed to quickly improve, but more haste meant less speed. If any accident happened to her, there would be no hope for the first mainland.

Ye Qingtang’s mind quickly thought over this. Early the next morning, she put on a new set of robes and walked out of the Temple of Shadows.

“Ah Yao… where are you going?” Ming Gu was anxious when he saw that Ye Qingtang was suddenly prepared to leave.
