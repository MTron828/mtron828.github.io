Chapter 243: Marry (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Uh… I am overwhelmed by your kind favor,” Ye Qingtang summoned her courage and said hurriedly, afraid that Han Cangming would kill her like how he killed the evil spirit just now if he was unhappy.

Overwhelmed by his kind favor? Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Han Cangming raised a brow as he looked at Ye Qingtang who clearly only had “overwhelmed” written on her face. He narrowed his eyes as a light darted across them.

Should he dive straight in?

Or advance gradually in proper sequence?

After remaining silent for a while, Han Cangming suddenly took a step back and saw Ye Qingtang secretly heaving a sigh of relief. But before she could even let out that sigh, Han Cangming suddenly stretched out a hand and held onto Ye Qingtang’s right hand.

Goosebumps stood all over, and her body stiffened without daring to even look up.

Did he discover it?!

However…

Han Cangming removed a ring on his finger and put it onto Ye Qingtang’s fair finger without hesitation. The moment the slightly large ring was worn on Ye Qingtang’s finger, it suddenly shrank in size, fitting on her finger tightly.

“You can consider it.” Afterward, Han Cangming released Ye Qingtang’s hand.

Ye Qingtang was utterly stunned as though a bolt of lightning struck her, and her eyes stared right at the ring that was forcefully put on her finger.

She did not know what material was that ring made of either. It was a silvery white ring with tiny, obscure ancient patterns carved on it

Han Cangming did not say anything further and left.

They would meet very quickly. He was not in a hurry.

Just as when he came, the tall figure turned into a beam of light and instantly vanished before her eyes, leaving a trembling Ye Qingtang alone at the sight of that ring.

Upon the dragon seeing that its Would-be Father leave just like this, it was as though a cold bucket of water was poured over the little dragon man’s excited face, replacing it with an expression full of despair.

Would-be Father, why did you leave already!!

Even if you leave, you should bring mother away with you!!

“Junior… Junior Sister Ye?” After Han Cangming left, Lin Long finally dared to walk to Ye Qingtang’s side. Lin Long looked at the ring on Ye Qingtang’s finger and was stunned.

“Is this a love token that His Highness Han Cangming gave you?”

“…” Ye Qingtang looked up and stared at Lin Long with a frightened expression. After taking a deep breath, she immediately lifted a hand to take the ring out.

“What love token… how can it be…”

To no avail, Ye Qingtang used all her strength, but it was as if that ring was grown on her finger and did not move at all!

“…” Was this forcing her to chop off her hand?

Ye Qingtang wanted to cry.

What was Han Cangming cursed with!

Lin Long could not help but laugh when she saw Ye Qingtang’s helpless expression.

“In this whole world, probably only you will avoid Han Cangming’s favor like a plague…”

Favor?

What the hell!

Ye Qingtang’s expression darkened further.

If she were an ordinary girl, she would definitely be on cloud nine to meet such a powerful person like Han Cangming and even be able to ride on his coattails. But… she had the Heart of the Demon God in her body!

No matter what, Ye Qingtang would not forget how many assassinations she faced in her previous life from the people on the “orthodox” because of that Heart of the Demon God.

Now that she crossed paths with the leader of the orthodox, she only felt that her time was up!

“Senior sister, stop making fun of me already.” Ye Qingtang suppressed her inner turmoil and looked around the messy surroundings.

The evil spirit was already shot dead by Han Cangming, but those zombies were not completely exterminated. Without the evil spirit’s orders, they were like headless flies that remained at the spot blankly.
