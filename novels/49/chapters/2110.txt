Chapter 2111: Congratulations (2)

Ye Qingtang remained silent.

As if she could even reject Elder Hua.

“Yes.”

Elder Hua smiled and left the Temple of Paragon together with Ye Qingtang.

They flew past the clouds.

Ye Qingtang saw a huge gold palace in the sky.

From afar, with the sunlight hitting the palace, it looked like it was adorned with gold.

The Six-Winged Fire Phoenix floated around the surroundings of the palace. There were other flying creatures beside the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix and they all surrounded the gold palace and the environment was just like paradise.

“This is the Sky Temple,” Elder Hua said.

Elder Hua then stopped outside the Sky Temple, walking in with Ye Qingtang. The entire palace had a gold interior but it wasn’t tacky at all. Lustrous lights shone in the palace, making it seem like a surreal place.

Ye Qingtang saw a few people from the Temple of Paragon busy with something. They lowered their heads and concentrated on their work, with their backs facing Ye Qingtang and Elder Hua. They seemed to not have noticed their arrival.

However, Ye Qingtang noticed that they seemed to be avoiding her. Whenever they felt her gaze, they would turn around.

They didn’t dare look at her at all. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Elder Hua took Ye Qingtang to the back of the palace.

A huge crystal floated in the sky. It was glistening and an image appeared. It was the sky that led to the Sky Temple, and Ye Qingtang could see some figures flying up.

Stunned, Ye Qingtang could sense that something was wrong.

It was obvious that they weren’t from the Temple of Paragon. The different flags represented different groups of people. There were many groups that Ye Qingtang had only heard of but hadn’t met before.

Most of them were the best in the Second Domain, even the worst of the bunch were strong powers. Just pick any one of them and they would be able to easily crush the Crimson League.

What was the Temple of Paragon planning to do?

“What’s going on?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Have you ever heard of our Sky Temple?” Elder Hua answered.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

Elder Hua chuckled. “The Sky Temple is an independent palace that was built by our Holy Lord using the power of space. This palace will only appear in the sky during a special period of time, once a year. After today, the Sky Temple will disappear and no one would be able to find it...”

“...” Ye Qingtang.

“Do you want to guess what the special occasion is?” Elder Hua slowly guided Ye Qingtang towards the news.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

Apologies, but she wasn’t the reincarnated Holy Lord. There was no way she could recall anything.

“It’s our Holy Lord’s birthday today.” Elder Hua’s eyes crinkled into a smile.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

You’re holding a birthday celebration so many years after your Holy Lord’s death?

Shouldn’t you be celebrating her death anniversary instead?

“Elites from both domains would come to celebrate our Holy Lord’s birthday every year. It was only after our Holy Lord’s death that the Sky Temple became empty and we no longer had any celebrations...” Elder Hua’s voice was tinged with disappointment.

Ye Qingtang could sense that Elder Hua was insinuating something else.
