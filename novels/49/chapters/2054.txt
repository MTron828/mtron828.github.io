Chapter 2055: Frightening Might (3)

Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo looked at each other and pointed towards the pagoda that little Luo Xue had entered yesterday.

“Is that the pagoda you’re talking about?”

You Qiong nodded.

Ye Qingtang instantly understood everything. It seemed that Ning Luo and her deduction was correct.

However...

How was she going to enter to find Little You Yun?

And how was she going to make her come to her senses after finding her?

No wait. She suddenly thought of something.

There would be an opportunity soon when the Crimson League attacked the Ancient You Clan. But there would only be one chance. They might move Little You Yun elsewhere after the battle started.

There were only a few more days at most before the Crimson League came to attack. She could gather more information in the meantime.

Since they had almost been discovered before, she decided not to enter another pagoda with Ning Luo. It was much easier for her to move around in the underground world since she was using Elder Mo’s identity.

After observing the place for two days, she realized that Elder Yuan would send a group of youths into the pagodas every night and that everyone would return to their own abodes after night fell.

The red light appeared every single night onwards as well and Ye Qingtang was slowly getting used to it. And with that, her power grew in leaps and bounds.

In just a few days, her power had transcended to the Heavenly Venerate Forth Heaven...

The power of Little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode was mind-blowing. She now understood why they had put so much importance on her Spiritual Abode and why they hadn’t given up on it after so many years.

It was no wonder the Ancient You Clan had been able to rise so fast and their youths had become so immensely powerful in such a short time. In fact, killing off the Second Domain would be easy for them if they gave the Ancient You Clan enough time.

On one of the days, the Ancient You Clan inner sect leaders gathered to discuss matters. Elder Mo wasn’t part of the inner sect and wasn’t invited, but it seemed like they were discussing something important.

Ye Qingtang contacted Ling Yan with the voice transmission stone.

“Ling Yan, how’s the situation with Mi over there?”

“We’ll be there in at most half a day so Miss Ye, you will have to calculate your time wisely.” Ling Yan’s smiling voice came through the voice transmission stone.

This one sentence made her heart jump.

So quickly?

No wonder there was a sudden movement in the Ancient You Clan. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Alright, I understand. I will let you know if there are any updates.” Ye Qingtang cut their communication off and went to find Ning Luo.

“The Crimson League will be here soon. The Ancient You Clan must have found out and are preparing for a battle now. We will infiltrate the pagoda the moment they start fighting,” she said.

Ning Luo agreed.

Her worries were quickly assuaged.

Since the Ancient You Clan was preparing for a battle with the Crimson League, Little Luo Xue was quickly brought out from the pagoda since he was their main power.

As Little Luo Xue left the pagoda, the other youths were sent out as well. The entire army was quickly assembled and their numbers exceeded her expectations.

So the Crimson League had arrived!

The battle had begun.
