Chapter 2586: Rapid Progress (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In this era, especially in the Divine Venerate Domain, the spirit energy was much richer than in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. However, no matter how rich the spirit energy was, it should not have such an abnormal rate of growth.

Within the Divine Lord stage, the progress between each Heaven level was extremely slow. How could one’s martial strength soar from the Fifth Heaven level to the Seventh in just two days?

“Seventh Heaven level Divine Lord?!”

Before Ye Qingtang could examine herself, the red light between her brows flashed again.

“What’s going on?”

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes quickly, filled with shock.

She had just broken through to the Seventh Heaven level Divine Lord. She had not done anything at all, but now, she had progressed to the Eighth

If this continued, wouldn’t she become an Emperor-level expert practitioner soon?!

“Divine Lord... early Ninth Heaven level...”

It had happened in just a few breaths’ time. Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck. Her cultivation level had once again advanced and somehow she was now at the Ninth Heaven level.

It was common knowledge that there were only Nine Heaven levels in the Divine Lord stage. If she continued to break through, she would become a sub-Emperor, and then an Emperor level.

“Can I continue to break through...”

At that moment, for some reason, Ye Qingtang was secretly looking forward to it. It would be best if she directly broke through to the Emperor level. Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to ask why this was happening. Anyway, with these breakthroughs, her strength would be increased by more than a

hundred times. This was a good thing for Ye Qingtang.

However, Ye Qingtang’s expectations fell through in the end. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After her cultivation level reached the mid-stage Ninth Heaven level Divine Lord, and she was just about to become a sub-Emperor, there was suddenly no more movement. It was as if everything that had happened before was just an illusion.

If not for her full strength and aura as a Ninth Heaven level Divine Lord, Ye Qingtang might have thought that she had just been hallucinating.

“The power of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline...”

After about 15 minutes, Ye Qingtang returned to her senses. Her bloodline was actually devouring her Divine Phoenix Bloodline!

All along, Ye Qingtang had two bloodline powers in her body.

The first bloodline was a variant Heavenly Demon Bloodline that could devour all things. The other bloodline was the Divine Phoenix bloodline she had obtained from the Divine Phoenix’s legacy.

However, for a long time, both bloodlines had co-existed harmoniously inside her. They minded their own business and there was never any sign of bloodline rejection.

But now, for some reason, the Heavenly Demon Bloodline was crazily attacking the Divine Phoenix Bloodline in her body.

This was not a good thing for Ye Qingtang.

Although the devouring power made her Heavenly Demon Bloodline stronger, her Divine Phoenix Bloodline would completely disappear if this continued.

Ye Qingtang was very grateful to the Divine Phoenix. Not only did she inherit the Divine Phoenix’s legacy, but it was also the Divine Phoenix who helped her seal the Heart of Heavenly Dao back then.

How could Ye Qingtang watch as the Divine Phoenix Bloodline was completely absorbed by the Heavenly Demon Bloodline?

However, Ye Qingtang was powerless to stop it.

Not only that, Ye Qingtang was shocked to discover that the power of the Divine Phoenix in her body did not resist at all. In the blink of an eye, it was completely devoured by the mutated Heavenly Demon Bloodline.
