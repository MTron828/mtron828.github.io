When Xiong Feng exited the hall, he saw Ye Qingtang leaving with the little white tiger and silver wolf, and he chased after them hurriedly.

“Ye Chen, I already told you that Perfected Xuanchen is no longer accepting any disciples. You also saw that I put in good words for you just now. It’s a pity…” Xiong Feng put on a regretful look.

Of course, Ye Qingtang knew what his motive was, and she smiled. “Thank you for your help today, Warden Xiong.”

“Nah. It’s a pity though. I saw that you were very sincere and wanted to help you,” Xiong Feng said with a laugh.

Ye Qingtang understood his intentions and replied. “Thank you. I have a bottle of Qi Recovery Elixir, and I’ll give it to you. When I bring Master Du over, I’ll still need to trouble you.”

The moment Xiong Feng saw the Qi Recovery Elixir, his face bloomed, and he received it with a grin, though he did not think that Ye Qingtang’s words were very probable.

This fellow had many good items, but these would not be enough to request for Master Du’s service successfully.

However, Xiong Feng was not so foolish to say these out loud and instead wore a trustful appearance.

He had obtained the items already anyway, and whatever troubles this fellow did had nothing to do with him anymore.

Xiong Feng immediately led Ye Qingtang out of Falling Sky Valley and subsequently strutted back into the valley with his arms filled with a pile of treasures.

Half a day passed in the blink of an eye. Xiong Feng was in his room busy admiring the Scorching Sun Gloves and Golden Moon Armor that he just obtained, and he thought that his days would be much more comfortable if a few more fat sheep like Ye Qingtang came. The more he looked at them, the more beautiful they were.

Just as Xiong Feng was filled with bliss, a Falling Sky Valley disciple knocked on Warden Xiong’s door. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What is it?” Xiong Feng asked without looking up.

“Warden Xiong, a young man outside the valley said he wants to meet you.”

“Who is it? Tell him that I’m not free.” Xiong Feng replied impatiently.

“That young man said he is Ye Chen and that he talked to you about this before.”

“Ye Chen?” Xiong Feng was dumbfounded to hear that. He hurriedly put away his things, left his room, and asked that disciple, “You said that person is called Ye Chen?”

“Yes.”

Xiong Feng was instantly stupefied.

What is going on?

That fellow was just gone for half a day. Why did he come back suddenly?

Could it be that he was still unwilling to give up?

Confusion filled Xiong Feng, but at the thought that the person was generous with his gifts, he did not find it troublesome at all. Perhaps that fellow came round and wanted to change an Elder to be apprenticed to.

When he thought that he could fish some treasures out again, Xiong Feng was instantaneously energized and dashed to Falling Sky Valley’s entrance.

Ye Qingtang stood outside Falling Sky Valley with the silver wolf and the little white tiger. Beside her, an elderly with white beard swept a fleeting glance across the imposing-looking Falling Sky Valley.

“I didn’t think that you actually wanted to enter Falling Sky Valley. You tormented my old body to make a trip here with you.” The elderly scoffed. While he spoke that way, there was no trace of impatience on his face.

“Thank you for your trouble, Master Du.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

Wasn’t the person standing beside her none other than Master Du of Bliss Forging Workshop!

“Forget it. I’ve already agreed to come here, and there’s nothing much to say. As for the collaboration that I mentioned previously, how are you considering it?” Master Du changed the topic and asked with a grin.

Ye Qingtang was about to reply but saw that Xiong Feng had already reached the valley’s entrance, so she kept silent immediately.
