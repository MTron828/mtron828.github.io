Chapter 233: Fierce Battle (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhou Xuan and Lin Long’s skills were good and were also above average in the outer sect. However, they did not dare to be careless at that moment.

Countering a siege of over three hundred people with only three people was not a joke.

Even they were already breaking out in a cold sweat.

Moreover, there seemed to be some frightening evil spirit hidden in the second level. If the evil spirit joined the battle, they would definitely not be able to escape!

Lin Long pushed the enemies back while trying to search for an exit at the same time. But what surprised her was…

Ye Qingtang’s skills were actually not below hers at all!

Ye Qingtang’s attack was sharp, and although her force was not as fierce as that of Lin Long and Zhou Xuan, her moves were fatal. Every attack was accurately aimed and pierced at the enemy’s vital points. Her attacks definitely killed the enemy in just one move without leaving them any room for struggle.

Based on Ye Qingtang’s attack, she completely did not seem like a disciple who just entered the sect. Her sharp moves were as though they were refined from countless battles and were frighteningly murderous!

Even Lin Long was shocked by Ye Qingtang’s violence at that instant.

She never knew that there would be someone whose every move was so fatal and who did not even have the slightest hesitation when killing the enemy.

Ye Qingtang did not notice that her moves shocked Lin Long as she merely looked at the onslaught of enemy coldly without any warmth in her eyes. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Too slow, really too slow…

These people from Spirit Condensation Mountain Village are simply a bunch of useless people.

Ye Qingtang cast a cold glance at the few people who sprung on her and suddenly gave a flying kick. The same time when all of them was sent flying away, she lifted her hand and released three arrows from her hidden blade which shot right at the throats of the three people such that they immediately died when they fell onto the ground!

With over three hundred people besieging them, Ye Qingtang and the rest actually had not fallen to a disadvantage yet. Witnessing such a scene, Wu Chengze, who was brimming with confidence, felt his expression darken.

“What is that Ye Qingtang’s background? She is clearly the youngest, but why are her attacks so ruthless!” Wu Chengze’s gaze fell on Ye Qingtang. While Lin Long and Zhou Xuan’s moves were stable, they simply could not be compared to Ye Qingtang in terms of brutality.

Ye Qingtang, who was involved in a fierce battle, was not like a human at all. She was more like a devil out to claim lives. There was no hesitation when she killed, and every move she made was lethal!

Wu Chengze narrowed his eyes. From what he saw, the number of people who died in Ye Qingtang’s hands was actually way more than the number of people killed by Lin Long and Zhou Xuan combined!!

Just as Wu Chengze was absorbed in his thoughts, another shrill cry was suddenly heard from the second floor.

An enormous black shadow slowly appeared on the stairs, and an intense rotting smell filled the entire pavilion thereafter.

That was a monster that could not be called human with rotted flesh stuck all over its body. As it walked down the stairs, the rotted flesh fell beside his feet one by one. In the hands of the monster was a Xuanling Sect disciple, whose face was a pale white and chest had a hole. The monster was holding on to a beating heart in its hands and fresh, warm blood was dripping down from its fingers to the stairs…

The moment Wu Chengze saw that monster, an almost infatuated admiration filled his eyes. He religiously knelt on the floor in the middle of the battlefield and said loudly,

“Welcome, Master!”
