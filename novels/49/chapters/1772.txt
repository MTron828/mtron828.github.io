Chapter 1773: Great General (2)

Ye Qingtang was momentarily taken aback before quickly following the example of the other fiendish demons and getting down to her knees. She couldn’t help sneaking looks at that black figure hovering in mid-air.

At this point, Ye Qingtang finally saw what that black figure actually looked like.

It was a tall, strapping fiendish demon. Unlike the other demons, his skin was a boiling lava-red with faint glowing veins all over.

So powerful...

That demon was clearly quite a distance away from Ye Qingtang but he possessed such an intense aura that she could feel it engulfing her entire body. And the demon was already purposely suppressing his own aura...

Ye Qingtang knew very well that if the fiendish demon didn’t hold back his aura, she would already be torn apart.

The powerful fiendish demon gradually landed in the camp. Hu and the rest of the demons gazed at him with awe and respect.

“Welcome back, Great General.”

The Great General surveyed the crowd of demons, and those dusky eyes shone with a sharp, harsh light. “A Soul-Devouring Beast would not appear here without any reason. Go and investigate the cause.”

His voice was low and he had only spoken a simple sentence. But the effect was enough to make one cower and tremble and fear.

This was the Great General and the most powerful fiendish demon in this camp.

Ye Qingtang was completely awestruck. If she was right, the Great General had simply swallowed that Soul-Devouring Beast...

That massive Soul-Devouring Beast...

The thought made Ye Qingtang break out in cold sweat. She discreetly shuffled behind a group of demons to hide. It was hard to ascertain whether the Great General would be fooled by her disguise.

He was too powerful. More powerful than any other demon that Ye Qingtang had met.

Even the Ice King which Ye Qingtang had encountered when she first entered the mystic realm was not as powerful as this fiendish demon.

But the Great General’s attention was entirely focused on the sudden appearance of that Soul-Devouring Beast.

The active territory of the Soul-Devouring Beasts was very far away from their camp. No Soul-Devouring Beast had ever ventured over to their camp before. The appearance of this Soul-Devouring Beast was no coincidence.

The various fiendish demon factions enslaved quite a number of monsters. As the battles intensified among the different camps, this Soul-Devouring Beast might have been a war beast enslaved by one of the other enemy factions and unleashed upon them.

Demons from an opposing faction had been able to sneak into their territory—anything was possible.

The fiendish demons immediately acted on his command. The Great General didn’t say another word. He just flew into the pitch-black cave.

After he left, the heavy aura covering the entire camp finally faded away after he left.

Some of the little fiendish demons looked very pallid. For them, the Great General’s aura was unbearable. The kind of overwhelming and instinctive fear one felt toward a powerful being was a torture to them. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Great General... is so powerful...” One of the little fiendish demons stood up, still trembling. It had nearly fainted from the Great General’s oppressive aura.

Ye Qingtang secretly heaved a sigh of relief. She had lived for 300 years in her previous life and knew how to lessen the impact of a powerful aura. Otherwise, she would have suffered even more than these little fiendish demons.
