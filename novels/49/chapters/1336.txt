Chapter 1337 Checkmate 3

Very quickly, the Advisor slowly walked out from the dark with a face full of smiles.

“Sacred Ground of Reflection?” Ling Yan looked at the Advisor. “The Sacred Ground of Reflection should wish to support Second Sister, shouldn’t it?”

“That may not be so.” The Advisor shook his head. “Previously, the Sacred Ground of Reflection indeed supported the Second Princess. Unfortunately, the Eternal Emperor promised to yield to the Sacred Ground of Reflection. Thus, the Sacred Ground of Reflection does not need to waste any time.”

“So that’s the case.” Ling Yan smiled and nodded. “The Sacred Ground of Reflection is indeed powerful, but it is not that easy to deal with me. You yielded to the Sacred Ground of Reflection, but I also yielded to the Temple of Shadows.”

As Ling Yan said that, Lady Ghost and the rest who just rushed over were stunned.

Ming Wang looked at Ling Yan indifferently. They learned that Ling Yan really revolted and rushed over immediately. Yet, unexpectedly, the useless Eldest Prince still died…

Yet, at this moment, Ling Yan said he yielded to the Temple of Shadows.

Suddenly, Ling Yan looked up at a certain corner. “What do you say, Holy Lord?”

Hiding in midair, Ye Qingtang was completely dumbfounded. When did this Ling Yan… yield to her…

Nonetheless, Ye Qingtang went along as well and immediately descended from the midair into the Imperial City.

“Holy Lord?!”

Upon hearing what Ling Yan said, the smiles on both the Eternal Emperor and even the Sacred Ground of Reflection Advisor’s faces froze. That lady… was Temple of Shadows’s… Holy Lord!!

“Ah… Interesting. It’s been almost ten thousand years since I watched a show where the father harms his children and the child fights the father.” Ye Qingtang wore a harmless smile, but her eyes sparkled with extreme danger ceaselessly.

“Holy Lord, what’s going on?”

Lady Ghost looked at Ye Qingtang with a slight frown.

“Why?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes landed on Lady Ghost. “Do I still need to explain what I do to you?”

Upon hearing that, Lady Ghost glanced at Ming Wang, who shook his head.

A while later, Lady Ghost hurriedly lowered her head and cupped her fists. “I don’t dare to…”

“Ah Yao…” Ming Gu walked to Ye Qingtang, and his pair of black orbs stared at her in confusion.

“I admire Ling Yan greatly… Haha! He resembles the young me.”

Lady Ghost, Ming Wang, and the rest could not fathom Ye Qingtang’s thoughts and did not dare to object for the time being.

“It is my honor… to yield to and serve you for life, Holy Lord.” Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang with a smile meaningfully.

Ming Wang glanced at Ling Yan and then at Ye Qingtang. He did not believe that Ye Qingtang was the true Holy Lord, but… if she was fake, how would Ling Yan yield to her…

Things were increasingly strange…

“Holy Lord senior, how about giving face to the Sacred Ground of Reflection today…” The Advisor looked at Ye Qingtang while emphasizing the Sacred Ground of Reflection.

“Get lost.” Ye Qingtang spoke plainly.

“What did you say?!” The Advisor’s eyes sharpened after hearing that.

“Ming Gu.” Ye Qingtang looked at Ming Gu suddenly.

“I’m here, Ah Yao!” Ming Gu immediately moved to her.

“Don’t you find him… very irritating?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Mhm!” Ming Gu agreed, and he darted to the Advisor like a bolt of lightning.

Swoosh!

With the swing of a palm, the Advisor retreated dozens of steps and spat mouthfuls of blood halfway.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
