1401 The Eight Tribe Leaders 3

The Nether Fire Tribe had the strongest support in the Undead Clan, and the Nether Fire Tribe Leader was the most formidable out of all the eight tribe leaders. During the Temple of Shadows’s peak, the Nether Fire Tribe once brought endless fear to this mainland as well.

The flames of the Fire Tribe could burn plants.

But the flames of the Nether Fire Tribe could burn souls.

“Greetings, Holy Lord.” The eight tribe leaders bowed respectfully.

Ye Qingtang nodded lightly. Looking at the eight tribe leaders who could casually kill her with a finger, she could only put on a haughty and indifferent expression despite the despair on the inside.

Ming Wang believed her, but… these eight tribe leaders would not believe her so easily.

After all, the person who they willingly submitted to was the Holy Lord of Shadows that possessed supreme power.

The Undead Clan only submitted to powerful figures.

“Please pardon us for our late visit since your return, Holy Lord,” the Nether Fire Tribe Leader said respectfully with no visible hints of superficiality.

Yet, Ye Qingtang all the more did not dare to put her guard down.

“It’s fine.” She spoke indifferently in an aloof manner.

“It has been several thousand years since you left, but you are still as elegant as before, Holy Lord,” said the Nether Fire Tribe Leader with a smile. As his lips tugged up, the black flames on his face, which were accompanied by a strong aura of death, swayed wildly as well.

How freaking scary…

Ye Qingtang maintained a relaxed smile on her face as she looked at that nether fire that could burn all souls.

“Holy Lord.” A guard behind the Nether Fire Tribe Leader suddenly stepped forward and kneeled before Ye Qingtang.

That guard also belonged to the Nether Fire Tribe. The black flames around his body formed a human-shaped blaze, and no flesh was visible.

Ye Qingtang was immediately on the alert when the Nether Fire Tribe guard suddenly came forward.

“Do you still remember me, Holy Lord?” The guard looked up, and his reverence was faintly visible beneath the flames.

Hell knows who you are.

Nervousness filled Ye Qingtang, but she could only put on an indifferent expression.

“You once taught me before you left back then. Over these few years, I did not dare to slack off and have always kept your guidance in mind. I was excited to learn of your return; thus, I requested my tribe leader to bring me along to show you my improvement,” the Nether Fire Tribe guard said respectfully.

An unnoticeable smile flashed across the Nether Fire Tribe Leader’s eyes.

Ye Qingtang knew that there was trouble.

“Holy Lord, please give me a chance to assess if I had been cultivating as you said,” that guard said in a subservient tone and directly kowtowed to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang wanted to weep now.

She knew that the eight tribe leaders definitely would not believe her identity so easily.

This guard was probably arranged by that Nether Fire Tribe Leader to test her.

How would she know how the Holy Lord of Shadows guided this guard?

“If you really kept my words in mind, why would you only be at this cultivation base now?” Ye Qingtang chuckled lightly and looked up with a tinge of annoyance. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Ye Qingtang did not know what his original martial realm was, but his current skills were probably at the early-stage of a Heavenly Venerate.

Although his skills were much higher than Ye Qingtang’s, there was no difference to the Holy Lord of Shadows.

How could the supreme Holy Lord tell the minuscule difference between the upper and lower stages of a Heavenly Venerate?
