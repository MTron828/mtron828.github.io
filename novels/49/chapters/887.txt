Chapter 888 A Cat’s Paw For Others

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to talk any more nonsense with Ling Yan, but she was curious about what exactly happened between Ling Yan and Ye You. Why would that Ye You was schemed against by Ling Yan out of nowhere?

Earlier on, Ye Qingtang clearly heard that it was Ye You who came to snatch his treasure.

“You and Ye You…” Curiosity filled Ye Qingtang’s face.

“Do you wish to know, Miss Ye?” With a smile, Ling Yan sat on the ground cross-legged and glanced at the empty space in front of him.

Then, Ye Qingtang walked to Ling Yan’s side and sat on the ground as well.

“You should know that there are three great inheritances in this Dragon Vein. Apart from the inheritances of the True Dragon and Divine Phoenix, there’s also the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon.” Ling Yan explained slowly.

“I am already aware of this,” Ye Qingtang said.

Ling Yan nodded. “The inheritances of the True Dragon and Divine Phoenix require the Bone of the True Dragon and the Feather of the Divine Phoenix while the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon can only be sensed by a bloodline of the Jiang clan.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“You are saying that…” Ye Qingtang seemed to be in thought.

“The Jiang clan is the descendant of the Heavenly Demon, and they possess the Heavenly Demon bloodline. As such, they can sense the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon.” Ling Yan continued.

After hearing Ling Yan, Ye Qingtang suddenly recalled that Ye You indeed possessed the Heavenly Demon bloodline back then. Otherwise, how else could she climb up to the position of a Paragon Great Empress so easily?

“Since the Jiang family possessed the Heavenly Demon bloodline, someone will definitely head here to search for the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon. If I wish to obtain the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon, I would require a member from the Jiang clan,” Ling Yan said.

Ye Qingtang was a little confused. “How do you know that the person coming to snatch your Dragon Bone and Phoenix Feather will definitely be from the Jiang family… This kind of treasure should be wanted by everyone.”

Ling Yan chuckled lightly. “Because I have the Dragon Bone. The True Dragon and Divine Phoenix warred against the Heavenly Demon and bore a deep grudge. If any of its descendants are in the vicinity, the Dragon Bone would react… Of course, if the incomer is not a descendant of the Heavenly Demon, I have a way of dealing with it.”

“But it was Ye You, so you did not need to use that method,” Ye Qingtang said.

“That’s right.” Ling Yan smiled. “However, that Ye You wanted to have all three inheritances for herself. I gave her the Dragon Bone, but she was not content and had to hide in the dark and follow me to find the Phoenix Feather.”

“How do you know that Ye You had already retrieved the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon then?” Ye Qingtang questioned again.

Ling Yan gently shook the blue stone in his hand. “This Dragon Bone can sense it as well.”

“So that’s why…” Ye Qingtang mumbled to herself.

“The Dragon Bone and the Phoenix Feather were gathered, and the possessor also obtained the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon… As such, the grudge of the two divine items was aroused… You only needed to guide Ye You to spit out the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon from aside… Ling Yan, that’s really a good scheme… However, if Ye You was not so greedy and suspicious and left to search for the inheritance of the True Dragon after obtaining your Dragon Bone…” Ye Qingtang voiced her confusion.

However, Ling Yan smiled faintly upon hearing Ye Qingtang. “If that’s the case, it wouldn’t be bad either. Ye You possesses the inheritance and bloodline of the Heavenly Demon. With the Dragon Bone, it would be much simpler for her to obtain the inheritance of the True Dragon than we can. We can then let her clear all the threats in the inheritance of the True Dragon… and be a cat’s paw for us again. Isn’t that very good?”

A moment later, Ye Qingtang could not help but study Ling Yan.

This man was really…

Everything went according to his calculations. Ever since Ye You appeared and had the greed of snatching the Dragon Bone, she had already fallen into Ling Yan’s trap.

No matter whether Ye You took the Dragon Bone and left in search of the inheritance of the Dragon Bone or secretly tailed Ling Yan to obtain the Phoenix Feather, her outcome was already determined: regardless of what Ye You did, she was a cat’s paw for Ling Yan…

No matter what this man did, it was all done with full preparations and numerous schemes…

However, Ye Qingtang never thought that Ling Yan would tell herself about all of his plans.
