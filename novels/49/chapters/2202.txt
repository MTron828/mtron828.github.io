Chapter 2203: Tattle (3)

Even though the elixir that Yun Chen had brought the day before wasn’t perfect, it had already far exceeded his standards and was on par with that of a skilled alchemist. But he could barely refine mid-tier elixirs just a while ago.

It was impossible for someone to improve so much in half a year, let alone half a month.

“Even though he wasn’t good at refining elixirs previously, there was no way he would’ve done something so shameless. How would he have dared to do something so bold if not under someone else’s guidance?” Teacher Luo was certain that Ye Qing was the one messing around behind him.

With his personality, there was no way that Yun Chen would be so bold.

Everything had started when Ye Qing came into the Netherworld Academy.

The Vice-President felt a headache coming on as he listened to the accusations about Ye Qing.

He had let her into the Netherworld Academy because he appreciated the youth’s understanding of martial arts but had never expected so many things to happen in just half a month after he had arrived.

“Ye Qing, how are you going to explain this?”

The Vice-President’s expression was complicated. He knew that the lad wasn’t a bad person but there was no way all of this was a coincidence. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As Ye Qingtang looked at the determined Teacher Luo, she only said, “Teacher Luo, are you certain that the elixir wasn’t from Yun Chen?”

“Of course,” he said.

Ye Qingtang turned to look at the Vice-President.

“That’s easy to resolve. We have differing opinions since the medicine faculty doesn’t believe that it was made by Yun Chen while I saw him refine it with my own two eyes. We can just let him refine another one in front of a few teachers from the medicine faculty. The truth will come to light then.”

“Hmph, that may sound easy, but Yun Chen’s skill level is really low. What if he keeps dragging for time and saying that he can’t succeed?” Teacher Luo said.

“I guarantee that he won’t fail again.”

Her words surprised Teacher Luo.

The Vice-President frowned slightly and said, “We’ll leave this matter to the medicine faculty to settle then. They will make a judgment after Yun Chen refines the elixir. If someone really made him pass off something fake as his own, I will make sure to punish him severely.”

Now that the Vice-President had spoken, Teacher Luo couldn’t say anything else. He just thought that Ye Qing was crazy to suggest such a method of test.

They all knew Yun Chen’s standards, this so-called teacher was just asking to be humiliated.

“I will begin preparations immediately. ” Teacher Luo shook out his sleeves and after gazing at Ye Qing, walked off. He was going to make sure the impudent youth was left with nothing to say.

After Teacher Luo left, all that was left was to handle Teacher Di Nuo.

“Teacher Ye, how are you going to settle the matter of Zhang Qiqiu?” He said with a cold laugh as he crossed his hands over his chest.

Without saying anything more, Ye Qing took out an elixir.

“Teacher Di Nuo, this elixir can heal the bloodline. Give it to Zhang Qiqiu and treat it as Jing Ze’s repayment.”

With that, she stuffed the elixir into Di Nuo’s hands.

Di Nuo was stunned.

“Heal the bloodline? Teacher Ye, what joke is this? What elixir can heal the bloodline?”

The Vice-President and Teacher Luo never would have imagined that he would use an elixir to solve this issue...

This... had to be a joke!
