Chapter 2402: All in One Shot (3)

“What… What’s happening?” One of the teachers rubbed his eyes in disbelief, not knowing what he was witnessing was real.

What had the team from the Netherworld Academy done?

How could they bring down so many demons at once?

After making those snide remarks to Wen Qi, they had returned to observe the progress of their own teams. They had never expected Ye Qing to put the essence of the Sleeping Flower into the lake and in the blink of an eye…

His team had already brought down tens of demons.

How terrifying their power was!

What a frightening number!

Within moments, they had surpassed the other teams with barely any effort.

The demons in the Wailing Well were at least of the Divine Lord First Heaven level. They were extremely strong and rarely traveled alone. The other teams all had trouble finding one alone to attack and usually had to deal with a few attacking them at once. Even the students from the Heaven Dome Academy and Sky Martial Academy had suffered many injuries already.

Which meant that they needed time to recuperate and could not fight temporarily.

Before this, the team led by Jin Qianyang had been in the lead, having killed over 20 demons.

But this Ye Qing’s team had now killed 50 to 60 demons in one shot…

“Wen Qi! How dare your teacher break the rules!” One of the other teachers quickly regained his senses as his face darkened.

“How dare you insult them? Which rule have they broken?” Wen Qi calmed the shock he was feeling and remained stone-faced.

“How did you manage to bring down so many demons if you didn’t break the rules? There must be someone of the Emperor level in your team!”

Would so many demons of the Divine Lord level fall so easily?

They wouldn’t believe it unless some powerful and forbidden Dharma artifact had been used.

Wen Qi said coldly, “Everybody was checked before they entered the Wailing Well. Just because you can’t do it doesn’t mean that no one else can.”

He looked cold on the surface and was internally gleeful. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

My dear Ye Qing…

He had never expected the lad to give him such a surprise. If this continued, there was no way the other teams could catch up to the number of demons they had killed.

They finally had some hope.

“I would like to ask, how did your team do it then?”

“They used the Sleeping Flower,” an elderly voice said.

Everyone turned towards the voice. It came from an elder from the Heaven Dome Academy.

It was Qiu Ke, an alchemy master as famous as Zhu Ning and was extremely reputable in the Second Domain.

“Elder Qiu, the Sleeping Flower? What is that?”

Qiu Ke narrowed his eyes and his eyes swept over the humble pink flowers in front of Ye Qing on the screen.

“Sleeping Flowers are extremely rare and have a great anesthetic effect. If I’m not wrong, the team from the Netherworld Academy must have used them to bring down the demons.”

“Sleeping Flowers? Are they that powerful that they can bring down so many demons?”

Furrowing his brows slightly, Qiu Ke only said, “They can even bring down someone from the Emperor level.”

Good lord.

Everyone froze at these words.
