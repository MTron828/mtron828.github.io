Chapter 905 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (7) F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ye Qingtang looked at Feng Wuya and shouted coldly. “You’re so young, yet you dare to be so impudent to me, a Heavenly Venerate! Let’s not talk about you. Even the high-level powerful figures in your Feng clan do not dare to be so impudent when they see me!”

Ye Qingtang’s words completely stunned everyone from the Divine Virtual Academy.

She self-claimed to be a Heavenly Venerate…

In the Central Mainland, even a powerful figure at the peak of the Divine Arcane Supremacy did not dare to call himself a Heavenly Venerate as such a title was only reserved for those in the Heavenly Venerate realm!

Then, Feng Wuya looked at Perfected Gu Yun’s head and looked at Ye Qingtang. For some reason, fear arose within him as well.

But under everyone’s watch, that slight fear was subsequently suppressed as he kept a cold expression. “So what if you’re a Venerate? My Feng ancient clan has several Heavenly Venerates too!”

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang snickered. “Do you have any Heavenly Venerates by your side to protect you right now then?”

Seeing that a murderous intent arose in Ye Qingtang’s eyes, Feng Wuya was shaken and immediately ordered the Divine Virtual Academy disciples. “Quick! Kill her! Even if she’s a Heavenly Venerate, there’s nothing to be afraid of. There isn’t enough spirit energy here, and her skills are severely repressed!”

While that was the case, no one from the Divine Virtual Academy dared to move.

The intimidation effect of the Heavenly Venerate title was already sufficient.

“Let’s not talk… Let’s not talk about how her skills are repressed… Even if she remains at the same spot, do not retaliate and let us attack as we wish… I don’t dare to either…” A Divine Virtual Academy disciple mumbled.

“That’s right. A Heavenly Venerate has powerful connections. If we kill a Heavenly Venerate here, once we return to the Central Mainland, many Heavenly Venerates will definitely be after our lives… A Heavenly Venerate’s friends should all be Heavenly Venerates… Look at how beautiful she is. If there are… Holy Venerates courting her or backing her…”

“Holy Venerate…”

At the mention of the Holy Venerate, everyone’s faces paled. Before a Holy Venerate, even Heavenly Venerates were no different from ants…

“Hurry, move it!” Feng Wuya hollered furiously.

However, no one listened to Feng Wuya this time.

They could do anything that Feng Wuya ordered them to but to kill a Heavenly Venerate?!

What joke was this!

No matter how courageous they were, they did not dare to!

“Junior, whoever dares to act rashly will have their souls banished to the underworld!” Ye Qingtang swept a look across the Divine Virtual Academy students.

Whoever whom Ye Qingtang looked at immediately lowered their heads, not daring to make eye contact with her.

“Heavenly… Heavenly Venerate…”

Not just Feng Wudang and Gu Tianhe, but everyone from the Supreme Academy including Li Xiu was completely stunned.

It was also to say that this Senior Sister Ye once cultivated in the Supreme Academy six hundred years ago…

They actually met an insanely talented level Senior Sister from six hundred years ago in the Dragon Vein!

At the thought of that, Li Xiu felt goosebumps. How could he have shouted at this Senior Sister Ye just now!

“Senior Sister Ye!”

Li Xiu immediately knelt on a knee and said hurriedly, “Senior Sister Ye, I did not know of your identity just now. Please pardon me!”

Ye Qingtang waved a hand. “I will not fuss over such matters with you juniors. No matter what, you all are my junior brothers and sisters.”

“Thank you, Senior Sister Ye!” Li Xiu rose slowly, and his racing heart finally settled down a little.

“You are Li Xiu,” Ye Qingtang said while looking at Li Xiu.
