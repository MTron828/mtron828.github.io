Chapter 26: Bent Grass (2)

The manager smiled gratefully at Duan Tianrui for his patience.

“Young master, is Miss Ye telling the truth? There really are Bent grasses in the Withered Woods?” The attendant from the Si household asked Si Bai once the commotion came to a standstill.

Si Bai leaned against a counter in a corner, polishing a piece of white jade with the hem of his shirt while his eyes remained focused on Ye Qingtang. A smile played on his lips as he replied nonchalantly: “Who knows?”

The attendant was baffled, “But if there aren’t any, Miss Ye will become a laughing stock! Young master, are you really intent on just watching her… Ouch!”

The attendant grimaced after Si Bai knocked him on the head.

Si Bai grinned and stated: “She doesn’t need us to worry about her. Just relax and see how this plays out.”

The attendant rubbed his temples, totally confused by what he had experienced.

The manager had gotten his assistants to prepare refreshments for Ye Qingtang and Duan Tianrui while waiting for time to pass.

The attendants from the Duan household, who accompanied Duan Tianrui on this occasion, stood around him, throwing occasional glances at Ye Qingtang’s composed demeanor before murmuring:

“Young Master, I’m afraid Miss Ye had gone crazy, are you really intent on playing along?!”

Duan Tianrui raised his eyes and looked at Ye Qingtang for a moment before a subtle smirk played across his lips.

“If she’s intent on playing the clown, why not?”

With that said, his sight turned towards the entrance of the boutique and chanced upon the assistant, who was dispatched with the map, returning while covered in dirt. Duan Tianrui’s eyes gleamed with amusement in an instant as he put down his cup of tea. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Let the show begin….”

There were a lot of onlookers within the boutique, who would not want to miss this extravaganza, featuring the Ye and Duan household, two of the top aristocrats in the City of Lin.

The dispatched assistant, though covered in dirt, seemed to be carrying something precious in his bosom as he was seen clinging to his arms with the utmost care.

“How is it?” The manager asked the moment he saw that assistant returned.

The dispatched assistant was still gasping for air, but his eyes could not hide his excitement. He nodded his head profusely at the manager while exclaiming: “Yes! I found it! But it was well hidden within a cave! It’s all thanks to Miss Ye’s map, or else finding it would be impossible!”

Once that statement was made, aside from the assistant and Ye Qingtang, all mouths went agape within the boutique.

The Bent grass was really found!

How is this possible?

Everyone else was dumbfounded.

The assistant took out a brocade box, still covered with some dirt, initially enfolded in his arms and handed over it carefully to the manager. The manager opened the box hastily and within it, laid the Bent grass, azure green in color, still glistening with the fresh morning dew.

In the next instant….

The manager heaved a heavy sigh of relief.

“Miss Ye, thank you… thank you so much.” The manager kept the box of Bent grass carefully before turning towards Ye Qingtang and expressing his gratitude with the most genuine smile on his face.

Heavens knew how long the owner had searched for this herb!

If it was not for Ye Qingtang’s insight, who knew this precious herb would be growing in a cave!

Ye Qingtang put on a gentle smile before saying, “No problem.”

The Bent grass was indeed a rare herb currently but that was mainly due to the misconception of its natural habitat. In a few decades, the Bent grass would no longer be considered rare. In her past, Ye Qingtang once hid in the Withered Woods to escape the Great Elder’s clutches and discovered it by accident. Therefore, she could remember its location clearly.

All these were not known to anyone else.

With the Bent grass found, Duan Tianrui’s face clouded over in an instant. He had looked forward to Ye Qingtang making a fool out of herself, but now, his expectations were dashed.

In a short period of time, the manager ordered his assistants to prepare the promised reward of a hundred thousand gold for the herb’s acquisition.
