Chapter 1168: A Collective Battle (1)

The Blood Moon Elder was aware of the importance of this matter, and the fact that Ye Qingtang did not hide anything from him clearly showed her trust in him.

He would definitely not disappoint her.

“Holy Lady, it’s dark already. Where do you think is suitable for me to stay?” The Blood Moon Elder took a deep breath and asked Ye Qingtang.

“Where to stay in…”

Ye Qingtang sized up Blood Moon Elder’s huge body and was speechless for the moment. “How about… you find a random mountain valley or something…”

The Blood Moon Elder’s new body was too huge, and there was no room in Falling Sky Valley where he could stay in.

“Uh… Alright…” Blood Moon Elder was slightly dumbfounded, and he left helplessly.

While this new body was powerful, it was rather troublesome in his day-to-day activities…

After the Blood Moon Elder left, Ye Qingtang headed to the small pavilion alone.

Little You Yun was already fast asleep on Ye Qingtang’s bed.

Knowing that Little You Yun worked hard today, Ye Qingtang did not wake her up for her to have a good rest.

Over the two days, there was a limit to the time in which Little You Yun controlled the spirit energy, and the process of creating powerful figures slowed down.

In this period of time, from the South battlefield, there had been continuous news of the ancient clan’s defeat. In less than half a month, the Formidable Heavens Dynasty and the surrounding land had been completely dominated by You Ancient Clan, and it was said that more than ten Yang Lords from the ancient clan were killed…

The North and East battlefield were guarded by Ultimate Elder and Pagoda Sword Master respectively, and the situation was considered to be in control at the moment, unlike the South battlefield, which was close to a complete defeat.

In reality, it was not that the mainland’s obscure ancient clan was weak. It was just that the You Ancient Clan greatly valued Little You Yun, who was in Falling Sky Valley of the Nine Nights Dynasty. Thus, they increased the deployment and offense capabilities in the South battlefield.

The next morning.

Peerless School’s Sect Master paid a visit to Falling Sky Valley personally.

“The ancient clan wishes to invite Miss Ye to join the South battlefield. The current situation in the South battlefield is not optimistic…” The Peerless School Sect Master was donned in a green robe and was about sixty years old. Standing at the lower end of the main hall, he looked at Ye Qingtang not faraway and sighed softly.

A Peerless School warden who headed to Falling Sky Valley was killed and then revived by Divine King Luo Xue previously, and the Peerless School Sect Master learned of Falling Sky Valley’s situation from that warden. What he was more surprised about was that one of Perfected Xuanchen’s little disciple was already a Yang Lord at such a young age.

Now that he met her today, she was indeed impressive.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Peerless School Sect Master for a second. After remaining silent for a while, she finally spoke. “My Master Perfected Xuanchen’s daughter died in the hands of your Peerless School disciples.”

The Peerless School Sect Master’s expression changed when he heard that. From afar, an icy glint and sadness appeared in Perfected Xuanchen’s eyes.

Back then, Perfected Xuanchen’s daughter had a stunning appearance and was known as Nine Nights Dynasty’s top beauty. When the Peerless School disciples failed at courting her, she was cruelly humiliated and then killed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Perfected Xuanchen had never forgotten and could not forget about this incident.

If not for the fact that the current mainland was invaded by outsiders, Perfected Xuanchen, who had become a Yang Lord, would definitely not leave the matter at that and would definitely fight it out with Peerless School.

However, given the current situation, Peerless School also belonged to one of the main combat forces in the South battlefield, and the death of any one Yang Lord was a heavy loss to this mainland.

“I did hear… about this matter.” The Peerless School Sect Master nodded hesitantly after a long while and said.
