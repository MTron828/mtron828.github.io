Chapter 2215: Training (3)

“Scared?” Ye Qing asked them with raised eyebrows.

For the sake of their lives, Lei Yan and Nangong Lie set aside their dignity and immediately nodded.

They would do anything. Anything. Just don’t make them enter the Evil Soul Forest.

Ye Qingtang smiled. In her previous life, she had never set foot in this domain. But the reputation of the Evil Soul Forest had spread to other domains.

All of the descriptions were exceptionally terrifying.

Ye Qingtang had been very respectful and fearful of this place. But after she happened upon a certain adventurer in her previous life, she finally discovered the truth behind this Evil Soul Forest.

“I forgot to tell you that the fiendcelestial’s curse is not limited to the inside of the forest, but includes a one-mile radius surrounding it,” Ye Qingtang said with a serious face.

The moment she said those words, Lei Yan and Nangong Lie were thunderstruck. Even Qin Feng and Yun Chen’s faces underwent a major shift.

One mile?

They were less than 100 meters away from the Evil Soul Forest. Didn’t this mean... FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

They were already cursed by this place?!

“Once you are cursed, you won’t be able to evade it even after fleeing far from the Evil Soul Forest. You guys have already been marked by that fiendcelestial. No matter how far you run, those souls will find you and kill you.”

Lei Yan’s face turned pale and his legs trembled nonstop. The others reacted just as badly as him.

“Boss... what hatred... what grievance...” Lei Yan felt like crying.

Looking at Lei Yan’s face, Ye Qingtang suppressed her mirth. “Actually there’s a solution. As long as you guys can survive 100 days inside the Evil Soul Forest, the curse will naturally dispel on its own.”

“100 days.”

Those teenagers really felt like dying. But Yun Chen’s expression eased up a little. He looked at Ye Qing with a sudden incredulity.

The Evil Soul Forest had a fearsome reputation. No one would dare to risk their own lives.

The fiendcelestial’s curse...

It was really lethal.

“Alright, since we have arrived here safely, let us work hard together and survive in this place for a hundred days.” A bright grin was on Ye Qing’s face. It was like she did not see the mournful faces of those teenagers.

They had been wrong.

Utterly wrong.

They had been blinded and thought that their Boss was warm and tender.

But he was a demon!

It was too late to try and run now. They could only acknowledge their fate.

Under Ye Qing’s lead, the teenagers stepped into the foggy, grey forest with determined hearts.

The expansive ground of the Evil Soul Forest was covered with thick layers of withered leaves. Goodness knew how many layers of dead leaves were there. The layers felt exceptionally soft beneath their feet, and some parts were also damp.

Before long, Lei Yan felt dampness in both his feet. His shoes were already soaked with an unknown liquid. That chill crept from the bottom of his soles right up to his spine.

Lei Yan was not that bold. He could swagger around the academy only because he was part of the Leiting family. Now, in this godforsaken place, all the hairs on his body were standing on end.

He had no idea what he had just stepped on. Lei Yan suddenly felt like something was grabbing his leg. With a wail, he leaped into the air and clung onto Ye Qing like a sloth.

Ye Qing was nearly crushed by this burly teenager.

“What... what’s that? It’s a ghost! A ghost!” Lei Yan wailed.
