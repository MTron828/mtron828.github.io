Chapter 2164: Failing To Recognize A Formidable Person (2)

This guy could really flip the truth from black to white with words alone. Somehow, he even managed to throw in a whole slew of flattery.

Lei Yan gaped at Nangong Lie, who appeared completely unabashed. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Formidable!

Why did he never notice just how thick Nangong Lie’s skin was?

No wonder he couldn’t beat Nangong Lie. With skin that thick, his own hand might break from hitting it.

Hadn’t Nangong Lie been the first person to leave? Now he was putting up such a major pretense!

“Oh? Is that so.” Of course Ye Qingtang knew what Nangong Lie was trying to do. But she was not the kind of person to bear a grudge against a brat like him. She just found it all very amusing.

“Yes, I wonder if Teacher Ye will allow me to come back?” Nangong Lie put on an especially sincere and fervent expression.

Lei Yan gasped. He was truly amazed by Nangong Lie’s wonderful acting skills.

He had been wrong. If he knew this chump was so disgusting, he would never have fought with him.

It was too revolting.

How ridiculous could one get!

Did he really think Teacher Ye was a fool?

After dismissing Teacher Ye earlier, there was no way he would be accepted back!

“Since you are so sincere, you can come back anytime.” Ye Qingtang’s words were like a splash of cold water on Lei Yan’s face.

Lei Yan: “...”

Nangong Lie smiled. “Teacher Ye is so magnanimous. May you live a long life.”

What the hell!

Lei Yan never expected Nangong Lie’s boot-licking to be so effective.

Seeing that Nangong Lie had managed to weasel his way back into Ye Qingtang’s side, Lei Yan decided to set his pride aside. “Teacher Ye, I...”

Damn, he really couldn’t force those words out!

“Do you wish to come back too?” Ye Qingtang asked lazily.

Lei Yan’s eyes brightened and he nodded furiously.

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang also nodded.

Her bet with Di Nuo complemented her original reason for entering the Netherworld Academy. However, she was unfamiliar with the Netherworld Academy’s selection criteria for the Inter-Academy Competition. She could not go wrong by casting a wider net.

Inside, Lei Yan was nearly crying with joy.

Their teacher was really benevolent.

“Teacher Ye, don’t worry, from today onwards, you are our boss. I will listen to whatever you say. I will cultivate obediently and will not spoil your name.” Lei Yan thumped his chest as he swore.

Ye Qingtang: “...”

Boss?

“No problem. Boss, what should we start with today?” Nangong Lie grinned.

Nangong Lie and Lei Yan did not have good impressions of teachers in general. They were delinquents and teachers typically treated them with derision. As a result, these two naturally ended up with a bad impression of all teachers. Anyway, this Teacher Ye did not look that much older than them. Calling him Boss also felt more friendly and familiar.

“Boss, are you really betting with Di Nuo?” Nangong Lie quietly asked.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Nangong Lie kept silent for a moment. “Boss is awesome. With your abilities, it won’t be a problem for all of us to enter the Inter-Academy Competition. A pity that Qin Feng and Yun Chen didn’t come back. Otherwise, the six of us would be just the right number. If all of us get in, you’ll be able to go to the Inter-Academy Competition too.”

Nangong Lie continued to butter her up, even if he didn’t really believe his own words.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

“There are also conditions for teachers to go to the Inter-Academy Competition?”

Nangong Lie nodded. “Teachers need at least five of their students to be selected.”

Ye Qingtang scanned the classroom.

Including the still-unconscious Jing Ze, there were only four students.

Ye Qingtang: “...”
