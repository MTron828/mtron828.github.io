Chapter 202: Using Official Regulations As Pretext To Seek Revenge (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As the disciples were being called up one by one, the teammates behind Yun Shu and the others were gradually fixed.

At last, only Ye Qingtang was left.

Yun Shu also specifically left a spot where he planned to invite Ye Qingtang to join at the end.

However, just when Yun Shu was about to open his mouth, the warden suddenly looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “Ye Qingtang, there are other arrangements for your sect mission.”

The warden’s words instantly caused a commotion.

Yun Shu, who was about to say something, was stunned as well while Su Wan could not help but break out into an arrogant smile.

She could see that Yun Shu wanted to invite Ye Qingtang, but… the warden did not even plan to place Ye Qingtang in this mission.

Thinking about it, it was true as well. With such an inferior spirit root, which team would she not be a burden in?

Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly. She did not expect that there would be such a thing. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just as everyone was curious as to what other arrangements Ye Qingtang had, the warden waved a hand at an area not far away. Then, a tall and good-looking young disciple slowly walked out and appeared in front of everyone.

Once everyone saw that disciple’s face, they were all astonished.

His face actually looked a little similar to Zhou Qu, the person who set up an arena to cheat them!

“Ye Qingtang, you will do your sect mission with Zhou Xuan over here. Zhou Xuan will personally tell you about the mission contents later,” the warden said without expression.

Zhou Xuan walked forward, and his lips formed into a smile as he looked at the beautiful girl before him.

“Junior Sister Ye, it’s our first meeting. Please take care of me.”

Zhou Xuan’s appearance left many new disciples dumbfounded.

What is going on?

Ye Qingtang’s first sect mission is actually with an old disciple?

It should be known that the first sect mission was relatively easier, but missions that Zhou Xuan, an old disciple, took on had many hidden dangers.

Surprise flashed across Su Wan’s eyes as well, but once she saw Zhou Xuan’s face, an evil thought appeared in her mind.

Zhou Xuan… Zhou Qu…

These two people’s faces were so similar, could it be that…

The surprise in her eyes instantly turned into a gloat.

Everyone still remembered how Ye Qingtang beat Zhou Qu up on the arena the other time.

Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly as she looked at Zhou Xuan before her. She sneered in her heart.

Isn’t this Zhou Xuan the older brother of Zhou Qu?

She was initially curious as to why her mission was suddenly changed but did not think that… someone was actually behind all of this.

Looking at the devious-looking Zhou Xuan, Ye Qingtang already guessed that Zhou Xuan most likely bribed the warden in secret, which caused things to become the way they were right now.

“Senior Brother Zhou, that’s too polite of you,” Ye Qingtang said calmly with a faint smile.

Zhou Xuan sized up Ye Qingtang with a scoff in his heart. Exactly like what Ye Qingtang guessed, he already knew long ago that the new disciples would take on sect missions after entering the sect for a month. Ye Qingtang’s teaching warden once taught Zhou Xuan as well, and, thus, Zhou Xuan used this opportunity to change Ye Qingtang’s mission.

Disciples were forbidden from fighting amongst themselves in the sect.

But if they left the sect…

Things would be different…

If there were some injuries sustained in the mission, would they not be considered “natural”?
