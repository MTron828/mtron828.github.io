1338 Flood 1

“Temple of Shadows… Holy Son Ming Gu…” The Advisor paled and gritted his teeth.

“Great, great, great…” The Advisor continued. “As expected… of the Holy Lord of Shadows… It is a small world… The Sacred Ground of Reflection will remember this!”

Leaving that sentence, the Advisor crushed a talisman in his hand and vanished instantly.

The Eternal Emperor had an ugly expression when he saw that the Advisor disappeared.

The Advisor had already left, and Ling Yan yielded to the Temple of Shadows. The outcome was fixed.

Ling Yan had won this round completely.

“You have had enough fun today, father.” Ling Yan looked at the Eternal Emperor with a smile.

The Eternal Emperor resembled a defeated chicken in a cockfight. “Ling Yan, you’re indeed smart. I belittled you.”

Ling Yan chuckled. “The Eldest Prince, Second Princess, and others plotted a revolt and sealed the city. Father was killed in the chaos. I led the troops here, but it was already too late. Although I killed the rebels, I failed to save you.”

The Eternal Emperor’s expression darkened. The events had reached this point, and he could not do anything.

Ling Yan immediately ordered the Eternal Emperor to be imprisoned secretly, and future decisions would be made only after Ling Yan settled down as the next Emperor.

“Thank you, Holy Lord. Eternal Dynasty is safe today all thanks to your great efforts.” Ling Yan turned to Ye Qingtang and bowed.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan with perplexed feelings.

For some reason, she felt like she was schemed by this fellow.

Without showing any expression on her face, she glanced at Ling Yan indifferently and took her leave.

Lady Ghost and the rest followed.

In just a day, Ling Yan released the news that the Eldest Prince and the rest revolted and that the Emperor was already dead. The entire nation mourned. Meanwhile, Ling Yan, who was already the Crown Prince, contributed in capturing the rebels and had a positive reputation due to the Eldest Prince’s display of weakness, thus naturally ascending to the throne.

On Ling Yan’s ascension, an extremely rare flood happened in the Eternal Dynasty.

Tumultuous waves rolled in from the opposite shore and into the Eternal Dynasty in half a day, and the entire Imperial City of the Eternal Dynasty was engulfed before their naked eyes.

So be it if it was an ordinary flood. However, for some reason, that flood was extremely corrosive that even metals melted in it.

The once glorious Imperial City was now completely engulfed in the endless flood.

In the rolls of waves, only a pile of debris remained. Even the tall and sturdy buildings gradually collapsed and corroded in the corrosive flood.

Everything was ruined in seconds.

Wu Hu stood in the air and watched the flood beneath him with a heavy expression. He looked up at Ling Yan, who was floating in the air ahead of him.

The new Emperor had just ascended the throne, but such an anomaly happened in the Eternal Dynasty.

In just a day, more than half of the Eternal Dynasty was destroyed, and even the Imperial City failed to escape this disaster.

“Your Majesty, there has never been such a natural disaster in the Eternal Dynasty. What exactly…” Wu Hu frowned slightly.

Watching the flood beneath him, Ling Yan’s lips curled into a snicker.

“Natural disaster? It’s man-made.”

“What?” Wu Hu was stunned.

But the moment Ling Yan finished speaking, a faint golden light appeared in the sky ahead of them.

The evening glow and the golden light seemed to merge as one as thunderous drumming sounds pierced the air.
