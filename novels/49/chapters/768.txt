Chapter 769 Shameless, Too Shameless (4)

Yin Qingluo and Ye Ningxi were stupefied. Both of them were the only few out of all the disciples present who could barely see Liu Mo’s attack.

However…

They saw Liu Mo attacking Ye Qingtang, but whatever that happened later on…

The two of them did not even see anything.

Li Jingwen was utterly dumbfounded.

The smile that he had a while ago was, however, completely frozen on his face at this moment. Disbelief filled his eyes as he looked at Liu Mo, who collapsed on the ground not far away.

“Senior… Senior Brother Liu?” Li Jingwen spoke hesitantly as he looked at Liu Mo.

However, Liu Mo’s face was filled with pain. It was as though his body suffered an extremely huge blow and all his bones were forcibly crushed by someone.

Not mentioning standing up, he did not even have the energy to speak.

Stunned, everyone’s eyes returned back to Ye Qingtang.

It was then that everyone realized Ye Qingtang had been standing at the same spot with her hands behind, and even her left foot did not move at all.

Only her right foot had moved a few inches from before.

“Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother Liu,” Ye Qingtang said flatly with cupped fists. However, the entire Admirable Sky Peak was dead silent.

Liu Mo was defeated?

He was actually defeated in Ye Chen’s hands?

What was more unbelievable was that Ye Qingtang really did not use any weapons or her hands as she said before. Even more so… she did not even use her left leg.

It was just the lifting of a leg at that moment, but it caused Liu Mo to look half alive?

Li Jingwen’s face stiffened. He looked at Liu Mo, who was on the ground, and then at Ye Qingtang, who was standing there perfectly fine. Coldness spread from the sole of his feet.

What kind of monster was Ye Chen!

He was at most fifteen or sixteen years old. How could he possess the skills to defeat Liu Mo?

Li Jingwen thought that he could definitely pay back the humiliation that Ye Qingtang made him suffer a few days ago and did not think that… the outcome would be like that.

Liu Mo was already defeated, and Li Jingwen was unwilling to remain in Admirable Sky Peak any longer. He immediately supported the pale Liu Mo up and left Admirable Sky Peak in a flurry.

When the two of them left, the Admirable Sky Peak disciples still wore shocked expressions as they stared at the good-looking youth unbelievably.

First, Li Jingwen. Next, Liu Mo. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

How deep were Ye Qingtang’s skills?

Everyone just realized how ridiculous their conjecture of Ye Qingtang was.

How did Ye Qingtang say that because she was afraid of losing too badly?

She had that confidence because she clearly overpowered Liu Mo.

In just a moment, the shock and blank expressions that the disciples were looking at Ye Qingtang with gradually turned into ones of admiration.

Even if their Eldest Senior Brother, Gu Yihan, attacked today, he probably would not be able to defeat Liu Mo so easily under these conditions.

“Didn’t they say that… Junior Brother Ye’s spirit root is only a yellow spirit root? Are these skills what a yellow spirit root can cultivate?” Yin Qingluo was curious.

The grade of a spirit root was not absolute in one’s cultivation advancement.

However…

It couldn’t be so exaggerated, could it?

Ye Ningxi was astonished as well. “Which ancient family clan nurtured Junior Brother Ye? He is only this young, but he is already so invincible?”
