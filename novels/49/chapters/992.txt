Chapter 993 The Long Family (5)

If Ye Qingtang could give so many divine weapons and rare elixirs to the Ye Family upon her return, then she was certainly carrying an even more valuable divine weapon or treasure on her person!

Considering Ye Qingtang’s martial arts ability and level of cultivation as an outer sect disciple, it did not make sense that she could defeat the Duan Family. In addition, the power she had displayed with the two maidservants was akin to that of an inner sect disciple. However, Ye Qingtang had killed them with some kind of sinister technique. In that case, it was entirely plausible that Ye Qingtang had a priceless treasure on her…

The Long Family definitely wanted the Ye Family’s treasures. They also wanted all the treasures on Ye Qingtang’s person.

“Miss Long Rui, don’t you think that since all this… is a misunderstanding, why don’t…” The Third Elder looked at the expressionless Long Rui and spoke smilingly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Since you are fairly sensible, there is room for negotiation,” said Long Rui blandly and shot a look at Ye Qingtang.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was still standing motionless at her original spot.

Since she knew that the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord from the Long Family was about to arrive, Ye Qingtang saved herself a trip to the Long Family and simply waited there for the arrival of the Long Family’s half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

At that moment, the Ye Family’s disciples and senior members had relaxed a little once they heard Long Rui say that there was room for negotiation. The Dharma treasures that Ye Qingtang had brought were not important. As long as the Long Family did not hold the Ye Family responsible, they were happy to discuss the matter.

An extremely powerful force enclosed the Ye House. The senior members and disciples of the Ye Family were shocked by the force.

At the same time, a luxuriously dressed middle-aged man and a few old men stepped through the main gate of the Ye House and into the courtyard.

The frightening force was being emitted by the middle-aged man in the lead and was truly terrifying

“Long… Long Family’s Master…”

Everyone present was shocked when they saw the middle-aged man.

“Greetings, Lord.”

Duan Tianrao walked over to the middle-aged man and bowed and greeted him with great respect.

“Hmm.” The middle-aged man glanced at Duan Tianrao and replied softly.

The middle-aged man did not really like Duan Tianrao of the Duan Family and did not think him worthy of his daughter, Long Rui. However, Long Rui had set her heart on Duan Tianrao, and he had no choice. It was also because of Long Rui that the Duan Family had experienced such smooth sailing for the past two years.

“Father.”

Long Rui stepped forward and advanced to the side of the Long Family’s Master and recounted the past events to him.

The Long Family’s Master was shocked when he heard Long Rui’s words. He looked around him, and just as Long Rui said, there were many premium yellow-grade divine weapons in the Ye House…

As Master of the Long Family and a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, even the sword he carried was no more than a superior yellow-grade weapon…

However, besides the premium yellow-grade weapons, there were also many rare and precious elixirs.

All of them were rare and priceless. Under normal circumstances, it was extremely difficult to obtain even one item.

“So the Ye Family has such treasures…”

The Master of the Long Family’s eyes burned like coals as he muttered to himself.

“Lord, that Ye Qingtang is the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family and an outer sect disciple. She has been extremely open-handed since her return to Lin Town and the Ye Family. All the premium yellow-grade divine weapons and the rare elixirs were given to the Ye Family by her. Further, Ye Qingtang probably has an even more powerful Dharma treasure on her person,” said Duan Tianrao.
