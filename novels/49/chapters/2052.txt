The red light seared into their eyes, making it difficult for them to see. A wave of dizziness hit Ye Qingtang. Fortunately, Ning Luo was doing much better and he dragged the pale her into the shade.

Ye Qingtang grabbed her swollen head in pain. It felt as though something was sapping away all of her strength.

Through the haze of her mind, she saw the doors of the huge pagodas all burst open suddenly as the youths who had entered before this all started walking out. Their numbers were far beyond what Ye Qingtang had seen previously.

Hundreds to thousands of youths walked out of each pagoda.

Bathed in the red light, the youths lifted their heads as their silver eyes fixated on the top of the pagodas. She didn’t see the rest as the strong feeling of dizziness sent her into a stupor as darkness claimed her.

...

When she woke up the next day, the feeling of nausea had not completely dissipated. She sat up suddenly, not knowing when she had returned to her room.

“You’re awake.” Ning Luo was sitting on a chair by her side as he looked at her calmly. You Qiong, who was at her side as well, looked at her worriedly.

“What happened last night? How did you...” You Qiong frowned as he couldn’t stop worrying about Ye Qingtang who was still looking pale.

He had felt the aura of the underground world turn strange not long after Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo had left last night. Then not long after, Ning Luo had returned carrying an unconscious Ye Qingtang.

Her face had been as pale as a sheet then and she had been soaked in sweat. You Qiong had called her a few times but she did not wake up.

“I’m not sure,” she said as she rubbed her aching temple. The last thing she remembered was the youths exiting the pagodas.

What had happened after that?

“It was the Spiritual Abode,” Ning Luo said softly.

“What do you mean?” she asked.

Gaze turning towards the window, he looked at the pagodas not far from them with a strange expression.

“She was releasing her Spiritual Abode. I’m familiar with the feeling but that was the first time you were experiencing it, so your body couldn’t cope. But...”

“You can check to see if there are any changes to your body,” he said as he looked at her.

What did he mean by that? She checked herself again.

She was stunned by what she found.

Her spirit realm level had risen!

In just one night, her spirit realm level had risen by a whole heaven level. This shocked her to the core.

But she couldn’t express this in front of You Qiong. After all, to him, she was the powerful Holy Lord of Shadows...

“You Qiong, go find out more about the pagodas. I have something to discuss with Ning Luo,” she said.

He quickly left without any suspicion toward them.

She waited till he left before speaking to Ning Luo. “You’re saying that the red light yesterday is from Little You Yun releasing her Spiritual Abode?”

Ning Luo nodded.

“You should consider yourself lucky that you were strong enough yesterday, or you would have exploded under the influence of the Spiritual Abode.”
