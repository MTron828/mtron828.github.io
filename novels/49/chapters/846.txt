Chapter 847 Opening of The Dragon Vein

Since the little white tiger said that, it proved that the Diamond Boulder from earlier on was not simple.

“That stone did not provoke you. Why do you want to snatch the flower on its head?” The little white tiger asked.

Ye Qingtang looked puzzled after hearing the little white tiger. “How can it be called snatching? Everything in this Dragon Vein is formed by spirit energy and does not have an owner. They’re only waiting for fated people to retrieve them. Moreover, the Everlasting Flower is merely a useless decoration for that stone, but it’s very meaningful to me.”

The little white tiger nodded immediately. “Fuck. You’re right. I forgot that everything in the Dragon Vein is transformed by the spirit energy on this mainland, including that rotten

stone.”

Currently, Ye Qingtang did not continue to think of the Everlasting Flower and was instead worried about the safety of Master Du and the silver wolf.

There were too many strange creatures in this Dragon Vein, and even Yin Yang Perfected Lord monsters existed. If Master Du and Xiao Guai encountered those monsters, it would be difficult for them to escape.

Seeming to tell what Ye Qingtang was thinking of, the little white tiger said, “Don’t worry too much. That damn wolf’s speed is so fast and is as timid as a hare. If it is met with danger, no one would run faster than it, and there will definitely be no problem. As for that old man, he is not that simple either.”

Regardless, Ye Qingtang could not return now either. There were at least hundreds of entrances and exits, and returning to find them was no different from finding a needle in a haystack. There was no way of finding them.

Xiao Guai and Master Du knew that the objective of this trip was the Dragon Vein and should be heading there as fast as possible too. Perhaps, they had already entered the Dragon Vein right now. Thus, she could search for them in there first. If all else failed, she would return again to search for them.

Eventually, under the little white tiger’s urges, Ye Qingtang took a leap and landed in the mountain valley.

In the pitch-dark tunnel.

A handsome man with an outstanding quality walked ahead slowly with his hands behind him.

“Roar!”

Then, a furious roar sounded.

An extremely huge demonic beast ahead blocked the man’s way.

Ling Yan was in thought as he looked at that demonic beast.

“Come out.”

Then, a few scarecrows which possessed the combat power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven were released from a black

gourd.

Previously, Ling Yan used the black gourd to suck all of the scarecrows’ murderous aura away, and presently, the murderous aura in the black gourd condensed again to form Ling Yan’s creatures.

Very quickly, that demonic beast was surrounded by the scarecrows while Ling Yan walked towards the ray of light ahead rapidly without looking back.

“Interesting…”

As Ling Yan looked at the mountain valley behind the ray of light, his lips tugged up slightly, and he leaped down with a face full of smiles.

At the same time, numerous figures appeared in the periphery of the mountain valley.

“Yin Yang Child?”

After seeing the indifferent youth in the periphery of the mountain valley, the eyes an elderly clutching onto a gold scepter gleamed.

Swoosh!

An endless commanding power erupted from the gold scepter. In just a flash, that indifferent youth’s head flew to the sky.

Upon hearing the sound of a battle, Ye Qingtang rapidly went closer and hid in a dark spot. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“That is Yin Yang Child?”

Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed slightly.

These people were all from one of the eight dynasties of Central Mainland-talents on the Honor Roll List of Eternal Dynasty or itinerant cultivators with extremely powerful skills.

If that black-robed elderly holding onto the gold scepter was an itinerant cultivator, he seemed to have a complicated history with Yin Yang Child.
