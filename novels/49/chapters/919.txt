Chapter 920 Faced With Beauty (1)

“I will withdraw as well… Only one person can live. It’s almost a definite death for us.”

In just a short while, eight cultivators withdrew from the trial.

They did not have full confidence to obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.

If they failed, the only option they had was death.

Risking their lives for a destiny was too horrifying

No one had the courage to face such a gamble with only a slight chance of survival.

“You all don’t even have such little amount of courage. How can you all have the qualifications to obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix?” The scarlet figure looked in disappointment at the eight people who withdrew.

“Courage? Is courage more important than our lives?” One of the people who withdrew answered with a frown.

However, the moment that person finished speaking, the scene before everyone’s eyes shattered once again.

Everyone was awakened. The cultivators who were previously crushed by the Divine Phoenix were standing at their original location, well and alive.

It was as though the gruesome scene from before never appeared. Even the smell of blood that lingered in the air had disappeared without a trace in an instant.

“It’s an illusion again…”

Ye Qingtang mumbled to herself…

Everything that happened just now was probably another trial by Divine Phoenix.

The Divine Phoenix intentionally let everyone watch the scene of the cultivators being crushed as a test of their courage and determination…

The trials that the Divine Phoenix set were closely linked, and the illusions were extremely realistic. Even an illusion master was probably unable to distinguish illusion from reality. No one would suspect anything when encountering such a high-level illusion.

Even Ye Qingtang thought that those cultivators were killed by the Divine Phoenix. Never had she thought that this was actually still an illusion cast by the Divine Phoenix!

“This is all thanks to Ling Yan…”

Ye Qingtang mumbled.

If Ling Yan did not clearly tell her that she would definitely be able to obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, she probably would have thought of withdrawing as well.

This was not because Ye Qingtang was not courageous or determined enough.

In this rebirth, she still had many unfinished things. If she died at this moment, what difference was there from her previous life?

Having to meet death just because of the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, Ye Qingtang naturally had to weigh her options carefully.

Moreover, the Dimension Wall of this mainland had already shattered. In no time, that mysterious ancient clan would arrive to collect that extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode and destroy this entire mainland. The reason she required the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix and for coming to the Dragon Vein was all to become more powerful and eventually fight against those outsiders. Before that, she must not gamble with her life!

Once she lost the gamble, not only would she die, but everyone in Xuanling Sect, Ye family, her father, and friends would all die as well. She could not take this gamble.

This time, her life did not belong to herself.

If she died, she would not be able to save many others.

“You all lack awareness, courage, and determination. The inheritance of the Divine Phoenix must not be given to you all.”

The Divine Phoenix looked disappointedly at the eight cultivators who initiated to withdraw and those who were not cautious and shook its head.

As the Divine Phoenix finished speaking, ten plus people were sent out of the land of inheritance and disappeared.

“The assessment will continue.” The Divine Phoenix spoke. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“May I ask, what assessment it is?” Yin Yang Child asked curiously.

Upon hearing that, the young man in black armor convulsed with laughter. “Are you a fool? If the Divine Phoenix really told you, wouldn’t you be prepared for it? Are you foolish or did you treat Lord Divine Phoenix as a fool?”
