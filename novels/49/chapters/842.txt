Chapter 843 Complete Control

Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang meaningfully and said, “Since you hid here and waited for a long time, it proves that you have a way of destroying the Diamond Boulder and entering the Dragon Vein. Am I correct?”

“It’s impossible for me to bring you into the Dragon Vein,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

“No. You will definitely bring me along.” Ling Yan chuckled.

“Sure. Let’s try then.” A glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She did not believe that Ling Yan could force her to bring him along.

“I have a teacher… who is also at the Arcane Supremacy realm. However, he had already relied on the Crown Prince and is following by my side only to pry for information or to find a chance to kill me… If I did not guess wrongly, his Divine Sense has already noticed that you and I have been talking for a long time. If I am not by your side, don’t you think that my teacher would believe that we are related and catch you for interrogation?” Ling Yan said softly.

“You!”

Ye Qingtang was immediately infuriated after hearing Ling Yan’s words. This Ling Yan had already planned everything the moment he appeared!

Apart from herself, Soul Eater Daoist and even his teacher were all under his complete control.

“Are you really not afraid that I’d kill you!”

Ye Qingtang drew out her sword sharply and pointed it at Ling Yan.

Ling Yan’s martial skills were only at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, and it was very easy if she really wanted to kill him!

“Haha.” Ling Yan shook his head and laughed. “You don’t wish to kill me. You wish to make this stance for my teacher to see, and you believe that as long as you draw the line with me, my teacher would not find you.”

Ye Qingtang felt that she was about to go crazy after listening to Ling Yan’s words. Why could Ling Yan see through what she was thinking about? Was he a monster?!

“Yes, that’s my intention. So what?” Ye Qingtang said coldly

“By doing this, my teacher would only think that we are very close and that I taught you everything. It will produce the opposite of the desired result instead,” Ling Yan said. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

At this instant, Ye Qingtang finally experienced for herself what that Soul Eater Daoist felt earlier on.

“Ling Yan, you already schemed against me from when you appeared,” Ye Qingtang said.

The corners of Ling Yan’s lips tugged up into a devilish smile.

Ye Qingtang did not know why she would have any relation with Ling Yan. How truly unlucky she was!

“Do you agree to bring me to the Dragon Vein already?” Ling Yan asked curiously.

“No!” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

“Oh… Actually, you only feel that you have no face anymore. However, you’re only a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Back then, a Heavenly Venerate also lost face before me and even almost lost his life. Thus, as a lady, you really don’t need to care too much about your face.” Ling Yan chuckled.

Ultimately, Ye Qingtang sighed and said, “You are amazing. I will bring you to the Dragon Vein, but you better not hinder me.”

“That is a given. My skills are worse than yours. If I really harbor evil designs towards you, you can kill me easily.” Ling Yan responded.

“Cut the crap. Release your spell and let them regain consciousness,” Ye Qingtang said.

The next second, Master Du shivered slightly, and he scanned the surroundings in surprise.

“Fuck. I actually fell asleep… I must be too tired these few days… How pitiful am I… Ah…” The little white tiger yawned and muttered.

“Master Du, let’s go,” Ye Qingtang said.

Master Du was stunned to hear that. “You mean… bringing him along?”
