Chapter 1800: Right And Wrong (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Little Heavenly Demon was still slumbering, its tiny body instinctively snuggling toward the warm body of Little White Tiger, who finally couldn’t stand it any longer and shoved it away.

But before long, Little Heavenly Demon started to roll toward Little White Tiger again...

When Ye Qingtang returned, she saw Little White Tiger trying its best to shove Little Heavenly Demon away, while Little Heavenly Demon kept rolling back towards it.

“You are back.” Little White Tiger immediately stood up when it saw Ye Qingtang. It hurried over and sniffed about her body, its sensitive sense of smell instantly discovering a strange scent on her.

The smell was quite wondrous.

“What has entered your body?” Little White Tiger asked.

Ye Qingtang quickly picked up Little White Tiger, her eyes darting around furtively. After making sure there were no other demons nearby, she told Little White Tiger everything that had happened in that sealed space.

Little White Tiger’s eyes widened at her story.

“You are saying... the Deity Ocean has merged with you?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

It hesitated before continuing. “Do you feel anything? Did your powers increase... uh... but it doesn’t feel like your powers improved at all...”

Ye Qingtang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, She had heard about how powerful the Deity Ocean was and also knew that one’s powers would greatly increase after obtaining a high-level Spiritual Abode. But somehow, nothing about her had changed. It was all very puzzling.

Lord of everything? She still couldn’t defeat even a single fiendish demon!

The only thing this Deity Ocean could do for now was to make her invisible and help her pass through dimensions. Ye Qingtang had yet to discover any other changes.

“This Spiritual Abode is somewhat strange, but now is not the time to probe into this. We will slowly analyze this item after leaving this god-forsaken place,” Little White Tiger said.

Ye Qingtang agreed.

Having been so tense for so long, Ye Qingtang finally let herself relax a little. She sat down cross-legged and tried to see if cultivating would feel the same with the Deity Ocean merged inside her.

It had been some time since Ye Qingtang crossed over to the Fourth Heaven level. After entering this realm, she had not wasted a single opportunity to cultivate and all her cultivations had felt as per normal. But with the Deity Ocean inside her now, she could clearly feel that the speed of her cultivation had greatly increased. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The store of power which she had spent a long time cultivating was being catalyzed by the Deity Ocean and gradually moving her toward the mid-stage of the Fourth Heaven level. Ye Qingtang breathed a secret sigh of relief at that.

Just as Ye Qingtang had settled down, Ba suddenly barged in.

Ye Qingtang was startled. Before she could think of an explanation for her human-like posture, she noticed that Ba was looking very jittery and was completely oblivious to what she had been doing.

“Qing, bad news. The Great General wants you to head over right now.”

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback. She could already guess what might have happened.

Unfortunately, now was not the time to relax.

Getting to her feet, Ye Qingtang quickly followed Ba to see the eastern Great General. All the high-ranking fiendish demons in the eastern camp were already gathered there, and their expressions were extremely grave.

The atmosphere was tense and bizarre to the extremes.
