Chapter 2669 I Don’t Like It (2)

Ye Qingtang’s heart skipped a beat after hearing Ling Yan’s detailed explanation.

What… What kind of nefarious scheme was this!

This sinister scheme sent a chill down Ye Qingtang’s spine.

From a certain perspective, Ling Yan was plotting against her… Even though it was against another her… Against the Ye Qingtang of this past era. How terrifying!

Ling Yan smiled at Ye Qingtang’s strange expression. “Miss Ye, do you understand what I’m saying?”

“I understand…” Ye Qingtang nodded after a pause.

Ling Yan’s scheme was too terrifying.

His goal was to transfer her tribulation onto Ah Yao. After she died, it would be transferred to the next Ye Qingtang, who would be born 10,000 years in advance.

“If Sister Ah Yao dies and I am reincarnated in advance, then what is my purpose… Will I still exist?” Ye Qingtang muttered.

Ling Yan smiled. “I know what you are worried about. There is no conflict. Regardless of whether Miss Ye is reincarnated earlier in this era, it does not affect who you are. This is because, from a certain perspective, Miss Ye is an independent individual and cannot be destroyed just like that.”

Ye Qingtang still did not fully understand Ling Yan. “If I was born in this era, who would my mother and father be… without the Ye family, everything would be different. Would the new me still be called Ye Qingtang?”

“Probably not.” Ling Yan shook his head. “In a sense, the new Miss Ye is an independent being and will live a different life from you. She is her own person while Miss Ye is her own person too.”

After a while, Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and looked at Ling Yan. She shook her head and said, “I… don’t like it…”

“You don’t like it?”

Ling Yan was clearly surprised.

“Yes… Ling Yan, I don’t like you doing this.” Ye Qingtang’s voice was now more determined.

“Why?” Ling Yan asked.

“Sister Ah Yao… What crime did she commit?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan.

“Sister Ah Yao treats me like her own sister. Even though she is already an Immortal Emperor, she still wanted to protect me to the very last moment. She committed no crime… why does she have to die 10,000 years earlier just because of me? What right do I have to do this?!” Ye Qingtang asked Ling Yan.

Without giving Ling Yan a chance to speak, Ye Qingtang continued, “Also… after Sister Ah Yao dies, I will be born in this era in advance. And what crime did this new Ye Qingtang commit? You already decided her fate and eventual ending even before she was born…”

Ye Qingtang knew how wretched it could be. In her previous life, she was hunted down for an entire lifetime because of the Heart of the Demon God. Every day, she would open her eyes and have to flee in all directions. She was very careful and advanced step by step… no one could understand the despair in this. She had already experienced it.

And this other self?

Her fate had already been sealed by Ling Yan before she was even born. Her loved ones, her friends… her parents… would suffer greatly because of her.

Why? Why?!

If she agreed with Ling Yan, would she still be human?!

That endless pain and turmoil which she had suffered herself, to force another self to experience it again?! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

How would she be able to live with herself?
