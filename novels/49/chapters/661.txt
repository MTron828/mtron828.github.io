Chapter 662: Who Are You (4)

The little white tiger was in a daze for a few seconds. After returning to its senses, it had a shaken expression.

“Right. This isn’t the third level. It cannot suppress my demonic aura anymore!” The little white tiger was delighted and looked at Ning Luo. “Fellow, you’re very arrogant and conceited. How dare you speak to me like that just now? Do you know that I am very angry now? The consequences of making me angry are very serious. Your outcome will be extremely tragic.”

The familiar arrogant expression emerged on the little white tiger’s face again.

Roar!!

The demonized Buddha statue beneath Ning Luo roared angrily. It lifted its feet and wanted to step on the little white tiger.

In the next second, the little white tiger jumped out from Ye Qingtang’s arms. When it landed on the ground, its body had already grown to a size of over ten meters. It had a commanding expression as though he was the king of this world.

Roar!

With an angry roar, the white tiger launched its huge body at the demonized Buddha statue instantly.

As the two enormous creatures clashed, an earth-shattering sound erupted, draining one of all color.

At that instant, more and more cultivators rushed over, wanting to know what happened at this ice field.

Before long, numerous powerful figures from super sects arrived at the first moment.

“That is… Ning Luo?” One of the Yunxiao Sect wardens was shocked when he saw the man on the Buddha statue.

Why was their Yunxiao Sect disciple, Ning Luo, standing on this dangerous creature in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm?

“Fiendcelestial Beast!!” Other super sects’ figures took notice of the white tiger quickly and were astonished.

“And that Xuanling Sect disciple, Ye Qingtang? Could it be that what the black-robed person said is true? Ye Qingtang from a mere small sect really subdued the white tiger in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm?!”

The forces from the Formidable Heavens Dynasty and Nine Nights Dynasty started buzzing immediately.

“Ning Luo, kill Ye Qingtang and snatch that Fiendcelestial Beast over. If you can do it, that is making a huge contribution to the sect!!”

Although the Yunxiao Sect warden was unclear how Ning Luo could control the demonized Buddha statue, evidently, he did not think too much about it.

After hearing that, Ning Luo, who was on the demonized Buddha statue, flashed a faint devilish smile.

Thud!

After the demonized Buddha statue forced the white tiger to retreat after a punch, it dashed to the Yunxiao Sect warden’s side at the fastest speed.

“Ning Luo… what… what are you doing!”

Seeing that Ning Luo controlled the demonized Buddha statue to be hostile, the Yunxiao Sect warden was shocked.

It had already been some time since they entered this Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, and naturally, they had witnessed the demonized Buddha statue’s horrifying powers.

The youngest internal sect elder of their Yunxiao Sect was killed by the demonized Buddha statue in the blood-colored city some time ago.

Ning Luo had an aloof expression as he looked at the Yunxiao Sect warden as if he was looking at an ant.

Before waiting for the Yunxiao Sect warden to say anything, the demonized Buddha statue roared furiously and hammered the vajra down instantly.

Boom, boom!!

All everyone saw was that the Yunxiao Sect warden was hammered by the vajra. Afterward, his entire body turned into a bloody fog and was absorbed by the Ice Frost Divine Sword in Ning Luo’s hand.

“Senior Brother Ning… what are you doing!”

“Ning Luo, how dare you kill a sect warden?!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ning Luo, could it be that you wish to rebel?!”

The Yunxiao Sect disciples shouted sternly when they saw the warden being killed.

However, as these Yunxiao Sect disciples finished speaking, they were each smashed by the demonic Buddha statue with a punch.
