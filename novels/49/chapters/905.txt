Chapter 906 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (7)

“Yes!” Li Xiu nodded repeatedly.

“Good. Watch those Divine Virtual Academy disciples properly. Whoever dares to move, you can just beat them to death,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Rest assured, Senior Sister Ye!” Li Xiu agreed hastily without daring to have any objections.

“Repeat what I said again,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Whoever from the Divine Virtual Academy dares to move, we will beat them to death!” Li Xiu nimbly repeated.

The Divine Virtual Academy students were taken aback.

There was no need to repeat right… They did not intend to move either…

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang used the powers of the Heavenly Demon Pearl and disappeared from the ground in a flash.

The divine powers of the Heavenly Demon Pearl surged into the sky. The sudden eruption allowed Ye Qingtang’s speed to increase by multiple folds.

Even the Divine Virtual Academy and Supreme Academy disciples could not see Ye Qingtang’s shadow with their naked eyes.

“She truly is a Heavenly Venerate… Even if her martial realm is majorly restricted on this mainland, her speed… is truly frightening… Is she still human…” The leader of the Divine Virtual Academy disciples was devoid of color.

Fortunately, he did not attack that Heavenly Venerate at once just now. Otherwise, he would have died a wronged death!

In the next second, Ye Qingtang appeared again but beside Feng Wuya this time.

“You… You dare to touch me?! Even if you are a Heavenly Venerate, my Feng ancient clan is not what you can offend!” Feng Wuya looked at Ye Qingtang, who was just a short distance away from himself. Fear ultimately appeared on his face.

Ever since he was born, no one ever had the thought to kill him.

Currently, the Divine Virtual Academy disciples did not dare to attack Ye Qingtang at all, and he no longer acted in an imposing manner as before.

“Little kid, how dare you be so disrespectful to me! You are already a dead person!” A cold glint shone in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Lending the divine power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl, she condensed an extremely horrifying might in her hand and struck Feng Wuya instantly.

Just the air pressure from the palm attack was as sharp as daggers. Feng Wuya instinctively blocked the attack with his hands, but his entire left arm was shredded into pieces by the wind.

“AHHH!”

A shrill cry escaped from Feng Wuya’s mouth. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Immediately, Feng Wuya withstood the excruciating pain and fled ahead.

“Where do you think you’re escaping to?!” Ye Qingtang shouted coldly.

“You have a death wish!”

Feng Wuya hollered in anger and took out a pure golden-colored talisman.

After taking out that talisman, there was a shocking change in Feng Wuya’s manner instantly.

The virtual image of a white-haired elderly actually appeared behind Feng Wuya.

“The Grand Elder of the Feng clan!”

Everyone from Divine Virtual Academy and Supreme Academy was left agape when they saw the virtual image.

The face of the virtual image was none other than the Grand Elder of the Feng clan, a powerful Heavenly Venerate!

“Grandfather, save me!”

Feng Wuya saw the figure of that white-haired elderly and wailed hurriedly.

“Humph!”

The virtual image let out a heavy scoff. With just this one sound, everyone at the scene was dizzy. Dozens of disciples paled and spat out blood. Apart from Ye Qingtang, no one was spared!

Even Ye Qingtang’s mind was a little adrift as well.

This was merely the virtual image of a Heavenly Venerate, and his scoff possessed such might. If the Grand Elder of the Feng clan was present, everyone present would probably die instantly…!

Although the might of that scoff was unparalleled, Ye Qingtang possessed the Heavenly Demon Pearl and did not have anything to fear.

A streak of Heavenly Demon aura surged out from Ye Qingtang’s body and dispersed the might of that scoff instantly.
