Chapter 2209: Invitation (2)

Just as the two were hesitating over whether to let Ye Qing continue at the Netherworld Academy, Teacher Luo from the medicine faculty hurried over.

“Vice-President.”

“Speak.”

“Yesterday, I had Yun Chen refine a new batch of cypress elixirs in front of me. This is the result.” Teacher Luo was very agitated and had already placed the bottle of elixirs in front of the Vice-President.

The Vice-President and Teacher Luo Sheng had no idea why Teacher Luo from the medicine faculty was so agitated. They opened the bottle and looked inside.

The two of them were stunned.

“Yun Chen refined these?” Teacher Luo Sheng looked at Teacher Luo incredulously.

Teacher Luo nodded.

“That’s right. Several other teachers from the medicine faculty and I personally watched him refine this. We witnessed the entire process clearly. In fact, we were worried that it was just a fluke and even made him refine a few more again.”

With that, Teacher Luo took out the rest of the elixirs.

The quality of all those elixirs was the same. They were also the same as the initial ones which Yun Chen had given the medicine faculty.

He was a teenager who only had a 10% success rate in refining elixirs. But he managed to improve his rate to 100% in just a short two weeks! And the effectiveness of these pills had already far surpassed that of the quality required by the medicine faculty by leaps and bounds.

The Vice-President and Teacher Luo Sheng exchanged looks.

Teacher Luo was unable to conceal his excitement. “Vice-President, I want to see Teacher Ye again.”

...

Ye Qingtang was just preparing to ask Lei Yan and his gang what the hell had they been up to yesterday. But before she could say anything, the Vice-President had come over with Teacher Luo Sheng and Teacher Luo.

“Ye Qing, Teacher Luo has something to say to you.”

Lei Yan and the rest looked at Teacher Luo guardedly. When Yun Chen came back this morning, he already told them why he had been called away yesterday.

The medicine faculty suspected that Ye Qing was helping him cheat and wanted him to undergo the test again.

The teenagers were well aware that the medicine faculty was full of prejudice against their Boss. It must be because of those folks from the medicine faculty that Boss was being kept at the Vice-President’s.

And now, they were coming to stir more trouble for their Boss!

Ye Qingtang noticed the angry expressions of those brats and felt rather exasperated. Stepping forward, she looked at Teacher Luo.

“I will tear off his beard if this goon from the medicine faculty dares to make things difficult for Boss,” Lei Yan growled in a low voice. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“With the Vice-President around, the medicine faculty teacher probably wouldn’t dare to do anything rash,” Nangong Lie said.

Mu Ziying’s eyes were fixed upon Ye Qing’s back. The eyes of her puppet seem to glint.

Likewise, Teacher Luo stepped forward and looked at Ye Qing impassively.

Teacher Luo suddenly reached out.

Here it comes!

This medicine faculty goon wanted to attack Boss!

Fight him to the death!

Just as Lei Yan and the rest were prepared to sacrifice themselves to protect Boss, Teacher Luo suddenly grabbed Ye Qing’s hand!

“Teacher Ye, are you interested in joining our medicine faculty?!”

Ye Qingtang: “...”

Nangong Lie and the rest were dumbstruck.

What was happening?!

Where was the prejudice?

Where was the troublemaking?

Teacher Luo, why aren’t you acting according to the script?

By the side, the Vice-President and Teacher Luo Sheng were not that shocked.

Yun Chen’s situation at the medicine faculty had been a very tricky issue. But after being under Ye Qing for just a short while...

Not only had his problem been resolved, but his elixir-refining skills had also improved tremendously!
