Chapter 292: Tear One’s Skin and Flesh (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Lu Xiuwen had to receive his punishment right there and then.

Two disciples walked into the hall, each holding a Rod of Discipline that was two meters long and ten fingers wide. Lu Xiuwen was pressed down on the floor, and the two rods hit his bottom unsparingly!

Suddenly, a loud clack was heard!

The Disciplinary Hall was dead silent. Everyone widened their eyes and stared as the Rod of Discipline landed. Lu Xiuwen’s good-looking face paled from the pain, and cold sweat ran down his face.

Su Wan, who was standing aside, was so shocked by the sound of flesh being torn that she turned pale. She tugged onto the ends of her clothes nervously.

Even the strongest and toughest Fist Faction disciple would not be able to get out of bed for two to three months after being flogged fifty strokes. While Lu Xiuwen’s natural endowments were pretty good, the time he spent on cultivation was still short. After just twenty strokes, the skin and flesh on his bottom were already torn, and the area was dripping with blood. Every time the blood-stained rod landed, blood spattered everywhere and dripped onto the floor. It was a horrifying sight.

Ye Qingtang looked on coldly. There was no emotion in her eyes as she watched Lu Xiuwen’s face turning purple from being beaten. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

That excruciating pain caused Lu Xiuwen’s mind to buzz. As the prince of the Formidable Heavens Royals, he had never suffered such a violent beating. His veins popped out as cold sweat trickled down continuously. His pale lips were bleeding from his bite.

Looking up furiously, he glared at Ye Qingtang, who was faintly smiling with hatred.

If Ye Qingtang had not suddenly appeared, he would not need to suffer such humiliation in public!

Fifty strokes were finished, and Lu Xiuwen’s bottom was already terribly battered. Blood covered the floor, and his legs that were soaked with blood could not stop trembling.

“Senior Brother Lu, this is also a lesson learned. In the future, you must definitely keep a close eye on your belongings and not let anyone have an opportunity to exploit your inadequacy to their advantage.” Ye Qingtang looked at the pale Lu Xiuwen with a seeming smile.

Lu Xiuwen’s teeth chattered due to the pain. Scowling at Ye Qingtang, he said in a raspy voice, “I will definitely remember this lesson for life!”

The toughest time had already passed. He would definitely not let Ye Qingtang off easily. The days were still long, and he would definitely have a chance to torture her!

He would not suffer this fifty strokes of flogging for nothing. There was already a conclusion to the incident today, and the Shangyue Fire Tripod was already in his hands. Once he recovered, he would use that Shangyue Fire Tripod to cultivate for a period of time and would definitely become the best in Xuanling Sect’s outer sect!

Although he suffered, it was worth it!

Ye Qingtang straightened herself and suddenly turned to the Warden, who was seated in the center of the hall. “Warden, Senior Brother Lu is ultimately not the murderer, and now that Senior Brother Lu has already received his punishment, it should be enough. However, the real villain is the murder who injured Senior Brother Yun.”

Once Ye Qingtang said that, Lu Xiuwen, who was paralyzed on the floor, was shocked. He faintly sensed that Ye Qingtang definitely had another move at the back.

“Indeed. Such a scourge must not be connived in the outer sect.” The Warden nodded.

A hint of laughter passed Ye Qingtang’s eyes. “Since this person could steal Senior Brother Lu’s sword and attack Senior Brother Yun during the mission, it must be a new disciple who participated in that mission. The Shangyue Fire Tripod that was stolen away must be hidden by that person. Please order people to search the rooms and space rings of all the disciples who took part in this mission. I believe the location of where the item is hidden in will be found very quickly. Once found, the identity of the murderer would naturally be revealed.”
