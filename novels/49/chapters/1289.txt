Chapter 1290: The Eternal Royal Family (1)

Ling Yan smiled but did not reply.

Ling Yue continued. “Eldest Royal Brother has always been on good terms with the Temple of Shadows. I’m afraid Eldest Royal Brother is the one in the best mood today.”

Ling Yue knew about the cooperation between the Eldest Prince and the Temple of Shadows and also that the Eldest Prince had designs on the throne. He was also allied with the Eldest Princess and was a truly formidable opponent.

“The Third Prince spent some time in prison. Did you get used to it?” Ling Yue sneered.

“It was alright,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

Ling Yue’s expression grew chillier. She was just about to say something else when she suddenly heard someone report that the Eldest Prince had arrived with ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Everyone in the main hall, including the Eternal Emperor, immediately turned sober.

Everyone’s gaze turned towards the entrance of the main hall. Only Ling Yan continued to smile faintly as he held his cup. The amusement showed even in his eyes.

A moment later, the Eldest Prince, Lady Ghost, and the others entered the main hall.

“Royal Father, your son greets you.” The Eldest Prince bowed to the Eternal Emperor.

“Arise.” The Eternal Emperor laughed softly, and his gaze turned to Lady Ghost and the other two standing next to the Eldest Prince.

“We are honored today by a visit by our guests from the Temple of Shadows. You must be tired from your journey. Please take a seat.” The Eternal Emperor spoke with a smile.

In the main hall, everyone’s gaze converged on Ye Qingtang, Lady Ghost, and Ming Gu.

Ye Qingtang looked at ease. She smiled as she sat down with Ming Gu.

At the moment, her status was not that of the Holy Lord of Shadows but an elder from the Temple of Shadows. Therefore, there was no need for her to speak.

The moment she sat down, Ye Qingtang suddenly realized that she was sitting opposite Ling Yan!

Ever since she last bade farewell to Ling Yan, she had not seen him for a long time. Today, Ling Yan was dressed simply, but it could not conceal his air of elegance.

Just as Ye Qingtang was secretly studying Ling Yan, Ling Yan lifted his head and smiled politely at Ye Qingtang. Then, he glanced away, as if he did not recognize her.

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“The Temple of Shadows is some distance from the Eternal Dynasty. It is a rare opportunity for you to visit us. We are truly honored to have you as our guests, and we wish to welcome you today.” The Eternal Emperor smiled and raised his cup.

Everyone also raised their cups and drained them.

This scene caused a smile to appear in the eyes of the Eldest Prince and Princess.

Ye Qingtang coolly sat in her seat, but her eyes discreetly swept across everyone present.

She had not had much contact with the royal family of the Eternal Dynasty in her previous life, so she had not met most of them.

But based on what she understood, the frosty-looking girl sitting next to Ling Yan must be the Second Princess of the Eternal Dynasty, Ling Yue.

Before she reached the palace, Ye Qingtang already vaguely understood that there were three centers of power among the royal family of the Eternal Dynasty.

The Eldest Prince and Princess were allied in trying to seize the throne, and they were backed by the power of the Temple of Shadows.

The Second Princess, Ling Yue, was working together with the Advisor from the Sacred Ground of Reflection.

Only Ling Yan was fighting alone.

The three centers of power opposed each other.

“Why isn’t the Advisor here yet?” The Eternal Emperor asked as his gaze swept across the main hall.

The Second Princess, Ling Yue, immediately stood and said, “Royal Father, the Advisor had some matters to attend to and will come later.”

The Eternal Emperor nodded slightly and did not say anything.

The Second Princess sat down but looked straight at the Eldest Prince with a challenging expression.

Although the Eldest Prince had the support of the Temple of Shadows, she had the support of the Sacred Ground of Reflection.
