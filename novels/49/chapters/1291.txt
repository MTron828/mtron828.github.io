Chapter 1292: The Eternal Royal Family (3)

The old man smiled and strode into the main hall. He glanced discreetly at Ye Qingtang and the other ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows who were seated. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

A moment later, he bowed shallowly to the Eternal Emperor and said, “I had some matters to attend to and was delayed.”

“No matter. Advisor, please take your place.” The Eternal Emperor smiled.

The Advisor nodded and sat somewhere near the Second Princess.

The moment the Second Princess saw the Advisor, she seemed to regain her inner strength. The trace of unease in her eyes vanished.

Instead, the delight in the Eldest Prince’s and Princess’s eyes faded.

The Eternal Emperor had just hinted that he would make the Eldest Prince the Crown Prince. They had thought that they could seize the opportunity to become the Crown Prince, but the Advisor had suddenly arrived and interrupted the Eternal Emperor.

The Advisor was from the Sacred Ground of Reflection, which was extremely prestigious. Within the Eternal Dynasty, no one dared to be rude to him.

It was as if he had almost managed to taste a delectable piece of meat, but something had intervened. The Eldest Prince was now in a foul mood.

“Your Majesty, the Fourth Prince has recently passed away. Your Majesty’s health has improved. There is no hurry to settle the matter of succession.” The Advisor looked at the Emperor as he spoke with an otherworldly air.

The Eternal Emperor sighed softly and said, “That may be so, but I have already made up my mind regarding the succession. Today, the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows and the Advisor are all here, and we might as well consider the matter together with me.”

The Eternal Emperor’s words caused the hearts of all the princes and princesses present to flutter.

They had thought that today’s banquet was to entertain the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows. But now it seemed that the Eternal Emperor was going to decide the next Crown Prince at the banquet?

The situation in the main hall immediately turned delicate.

Ye Qingtang secretly observed the reactions of everyone in the hall. The Second Princess and the Eldest Prince were the most intent on seizing the throne. Even though they deliberately suppressed their feelings, they were unable to completely conceal them.

Ling Yan on the other hand…

Had yet to speak. He continued to smile faintly as if the matter at hand had nothing to do with him.

Ye Qingtang inwardly applauded Ling Yan’s good mood.

Even to an outsider like her, it was apparent that none of his siblings were easy to deal with.

No matter who became the next Emperor of the Eternal Dynasty, the first person on their hit list would be Ling Yan, with his almost demonic intelligence.

After all, such a brilliant brother near the throne would cause them unease.

As if he sensed Ye Qingtang’s gaze, Ling Yan raised his eyes and met Ye Qingtang’s eyes when no one was looking. He smiled, showing a teasing look in his eyes.

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

She should not worry about this fellow.

The Eternal Emperor laughed softly and did not mention the matter of succession again. He only raised his cup and toasted Lady Ghost, Ye Qingtang, and the other ambassadors.

Amidst the music and dancing, the Eternal Emperor smiled and said, “Yan’er, I happen to have good news for you.”

The Eternal Emperor’s words immediately gave the Eldest Prince and Second Princess a jolt. They involuntarily glanced at Ling Yan.

Ling Yan said, “Royal Father, what might that good news be?”

The Eternal Emperor said with a smile, “The girl from the Mo Family has recently returned. I have summoned her here today. You have been engaged since young, but she was always cultivating with her Master elsewhere. Both of you have had few opportunities to meet. Today’s banquet is a good opportunity for you to reunite.”
