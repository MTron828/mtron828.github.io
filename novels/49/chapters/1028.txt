Chapter 1029 So What If It’s Yunxiao Sect (1)

When they heard that, the expressions of the Great Elder, Second Elder, Third Elder, and even the Master, Ye Ling, all changed.

As a super sect, the intimidating reputation of the Yunxiao Sect was deeply rooted in the elders and Ye Ling. When they heard that two Yunxiao Sect elders had come to the Ye House, they were stunned, and that was why their expressions changed.

“YunXiao Sect… why… why have they come to the Ye House…” Third Elder was slightly pale, and cold sweat seeped from his brow.

The Great Elder frowned slightly and thought for a moment before he looked at the Third Elder and said, “Third Elder… What do you think of the Yunxiao Sect…”

The Third Elder was taken aback by these words. “Great Elder, the Yunxiao Sect is a super sect… and super sects…” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Third Elder had not yet completed his sentence when he suddenly snapped out of his trance. The fear on his face slowly faded, and he also frowned. “That’s right. So what if it’s the YunXiao Sect?”

“Master, what do you think of the Yunxiao Sect?” The Third Elder stared at Ye Ling.

“What about… the Yunxiao Sect?” Ye Ling was lost.

“Master, Elders, the Yunxiao Sect is nothing!” The Third Elder’s expression changed, and he regained his composure.

Their Ye Family currently held high status. If even the weakest of their talented young disciples went forward, they would compare favorably with the top supernaturally talented disciples in the YunXiao Sect. Besides this mainland’s Peerless School, Beiming Manor, and Phantom Valley, which were supremely powerful, no other super sect’s power could compare with that of the Ye Family, be it in the Nine Nights Dynasty or the Formidable Heavens Dynasty!

“That’s right, the Yunxiao Sect is nothing!” Second Elder nodded rapidly.

When he heard that the Yunxiao Sect elders had arrived, the Second Elder had reverted to his old ways of thinking that the Yunxiao Sect was a huge entity. If the Yunxiao Sect wanted to, they could exterminate a small family clan like theirs on a whim.

However, the Second Elder and the others had forgotten that the Ye Family of the present could not be compared to the Ye Family of the past.

In the past, if the Yunxiao Sect elders had made a personal appearance, everyone from the Ye Family would naturally show profound respect and humility. However, that was the past, not the present.

The present Ye Family was not the Ye Family of the past.

“Yunxiao Sect?” The Great Elder frowned slightly. “What about the Yunxiao Sect? Is our Ye House a place where anyone can just go in and out casually? If they wish to enter our Ye House, even the Sect Master must announce his intentions in advance and wait for our approval, much less the elders!”

“Great Elder, you may not be aware that these two Yunxiao Sect elders are not here to visit the Ye House.” One of the Ye Family disciples, Ye Leng, suddenly spoke up.

When they heard that, the Great Elder, the Third Elder, and the others were slightly taken aback. If they were not here on a visit, then why were they here?

“Great Elder, these two Yunxiao Sect elders are unbearably arrogant. They have come to the Ye House to capture Eldest Young Lady. They have also been talking wildly about exterminating our Ye Family!” Ye Leng looked at Ye Ling and the elders and added fuel to the fire.

“What did you say!” The Second Elder was immediately enraged.

“Every word that I have said is true… isn’t that right…” Ye Leng immediately looked at Ye Yifan, who had changed his surname to Ye.

“That’s right… Elder Brother Ye Leng is speaking the truth.” Ye Yifan nodded repeatedly and corroborated Ye Leng’s words.

“Yifan, is what you are saying true?!” The Great Elder looked at Ye Yifan.

“Grandfather, it is all true. The hundred-plus brothers and sisters present also heard them clearly. Every word is true.” Ye Yifan’s face was filled with certainty.
