Chapter 845 Everlasting Flower

At this very moment, Ye Qingtang’s speed had already reached the maximum, and she turned into a bolt of light.

While the scarecrows’ skills were frightening, they were not fast and were already shaken off by Ye Qingtang in no time.

However, it was only when she looked back did she realize that she was the only one there. It was unknown whether Ling Yan was still alive or not while Master Du had separated from her.

“F*ck. I was scared to death!”

The little white tiger leaped into Ye Qingtang’s arms immediately.

“You are a Fiendcelestial Beast…” Ye Qingtang stared at the little white tiger speechlessly.

“So what if I’m a Fiendcelestial Beast… Those scarecrows are monsters… They must have appeared to eat me!” the little white tiger said seriously.

Ye Qingtang darted a look at the little white tiger. Those scarecrows did not even look at it in the eye, alright?!

“It has nothing to do with you.” Ye Qingtang could not help but say.

However, the little white tiger rolled its eyes Ye Qingtang after hearing it. “You’re too narcissistic. Each of those scarecrows has the combat power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven. If they’re not here to find me, are they here to find you?”

For a moment, Ye Qingtang actually did not have anything to counter back.

Then, Ye Qingtang’s eyes landed on a boulder not far away. For some reason, she felt that there was something strange about it.

“What are you looking at!”

The boulder actually made a noise out of a sudden.

“F*ck!” Almost instantly, the little white tiger jumped up in fear and hid in Ye Qingtang’s embrace. “Monster!”

Ye Qingtang frowned and walked towards the boulder. Looking at it carefully, it was also Diamond Boulder.

A talking stone…

“What are you?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

“It’s more like what are you!” The Diamond Boulder shouted at Ye Qingtang furiously.

Ye Qingtang inspected it attentively. It was indeed a boulder…

Moreover, there was an extremely pretty flower at the top of the boulder.

“Everlasting Flower?!”

Upon seeing it, Ye Qingtang’s heart raced, and her body trembled slightly.

It was said that the Everlasting Flower was sacred, and anyone who consumed it had a chance of obtaining the powers of immortality. It was an item that could make it very likely for an Arcane Supremacy to advance to the Heavenly Venerate successfully!

It was a sacred item that was sufficient for all the powerful figures in the First Domain to go crazy over!

“Looking at your thievish eyes, it must be that you want to snatch my treasure!” The Diamond Boulder moved backward as it spoke.

Then, Ye Qingtang immediately rushed forward and stretched a hand out to pluck the Everlasting Flower.

However, the Diamond Boulder was extremely quick and disappeared in the blink of an eye.

“Quickly help me to catch it!” Ye Qingtang told the little white tiger in her arms immediately. That Diamond Boulder was too fast, and there was no way for Ye Qingtang to chase after it given her current skills.

“I’m scared. I’m not going!” The little white tiger shook its head repeatedly. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

As it spoke, the Diamond Boulder had already vanished without a trace and could not be found anywhere.

“Everlasting Flower!”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were burning. If she obtained the Everlasting Flower…

Yet, it was a pity that she missed the one chance just like this.

Ye Qingtang no longer bothered with the little white tiger and searched for Master Du in the surroundings. Nonetheless, after searching for several hours, he was nowhere to be found. On the other hand, Ye Qingtang also met many strange monsters. Thus, she could only retreat and walk towards the real Dragon Vein.

Half a day later, a ray of light shone ahead.

With the little white tiger in her arms, Ye Qingtang walked ahead cautiously.
