Chapter 851 A Little Less Trouble

Yin Yang Child was not afraid of anything in the world except his father, yet he was threatened using his father by Ling Yan right now, who used his father against him.

“I’m afraid my father is not as compassionate as you make it. So what if I kill a lady?” Yin Yang Child said coldly.

“Ha… This is interesting.” Then, Ling Yan took out a black jade from his arms and played with it.

In the next second, however, Yin Yang Child’s voice sounded from the jade. “I’m afraid my father is not as compassionate as you make it. So what if I kill a lady?”

“This jade can record a person’s voice and repeat it countless times… Yin Yang Child, I remember that your father is currently preparing to contend for the Alliance Chief position. If I hand this stone when your father is contesting for the position and the sects hear it, do you think that your father… can still attain the position?” Ling Yan laughed chuckled.

“You… Ling Yan, how dare you scheme against me!” Yin Yang Child was completely infuriated by Ling Yan at that instant. “I’ll kill you!”

“You don’t want the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book anymore?” Ling Yan asked.

Both Ye Qingtang and Yin Yang Child were speechless.

“Give me the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book, and I’ll spare your lives!” Yin Yang Child could not hold back his anger.

Ling Yan revealed the location of the book immediately.

“Ling Yan, you told me the location so easily… Are you not afraid that I’ll go back on my words and kill you two?” There was doubt in Yin Yang Child’s eyes.

“Aren’t you afraid that I told you a fake location then?” Ling Yan smiled.

“You will look for it with me. If the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book is really found, I’ll let you off,” Yin Yang Child said.

However, Ling Yan shook his head. “Given my martial cultivation, the Dragon Vein is too dangerous for me. The Nine Sons Seized Souls Book is hidden in a deep corner by me using a flying spirit animal. If I head there with you, I’ll lose my life anytime, and if that location is fake, there will no longer be the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book in this world after I die.”

“Ling Yan, is that location real or fake!” Yin Yang Child clenched his fists tightly.

“Won’t you know it when you go take a look yourself?” Ling Yan replied.

“Don’t you dare play any tricks!” Yin Yang Child waved his hand immediately and inserted an aura on Ling Yan’s body.

With this aura, Yin Yang Child could find Ling Yan no matter where he was.

Subsequently, Yin Yang Child disappeared and swiftly headed to the direction which Ling Yan pointed.

Yin Yang Child’s interest in the Glazed Cup was long gone. He was extremely anxious and only wished to find the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book in the fastest speed possible.

Once Yin Yang Child was completely gone, Ye Qingtang looked at the nonchalant Ling Yan and walked towards him. “Thank you.”

“You’re welcome,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

“Did you really steal the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book from Yin Yang Child’s father?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

Ling Yan shook his head upon hearing that. “What would I steal his father’s Nine Sons Seized Souls Book for? I can’t predict what’s going to happen.”

“So you were lying to him?” Ye Qingtang was astonished.

“Of course I was,” Ling Yan said as a matter of fact. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“So the location that you gave him…” Ye Qingtang suddenly felt a little sorry for Yin Yang Child…

“Oh, I found the location of one of his enemies by coincidence earlier on. That enemy of Yin Yang Child has some enmity with me as well. This way, those two people would probably battle until the end of time, and we will have a little less trouble.” Ling Yan explained with a smile.
