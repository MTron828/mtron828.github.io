Feng Wuyin nodded. “Alright.”

Although the minds of Feng Jiuyou and Feng Wuyin were naive, their attacks were not light when they practiced their martial arts. Every single one of their moves contained the extremely powerful might of a Divine Lord.

Ye Qingtang could not help but click her tongue. If she had such abilities when she was their age, wouldn’t she be invincible now?

It had to be said that the Divine Venerate Domain’s level of martial arts culture was indeed much higher than that of the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

Of course, this was only based on quantity, not quality.

For example, there were Immortal Emperors in both the Divine Venerate Domain and the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. The only difference was that the number of Immortal Emperors in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain could not be compared to the Divine Venerate Domain.

The Divine Venerate Domain also had many more Divine Lord level practitioners than the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, but that did not mean that the Divine Lords of the latter were weaker. The martial art levels were the same. The only difference might be in the kind of skills one specialized in.

“Brother Jiuyou, your sword technique is much more powerful than before.” Feng Wuyin praised.

“Sigh, it’s just so-so. I still can’t do whatever I want.” Feng Jiuyou seemed to be deep in thought. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly when she heard Feng Jiuyou and Feng Wuyin’s conversation. These two little fellows were rather interesting.

For some reason, Ye Qingtang felt that Feng Wuyin’s name was a little familiar as if she had heard it somewhere before. However, she could not recall where. It seemed to have been recorded in history.

Ye Qingtang sat at the side and watched as Feng Jiuyou and the rest focused on their cultivation. Meanwhile, she was deep in thought.

She recalled the historical records she had read back then. In the historical records, there was a lot of information about Feng Jiuyou, but very few records about the Feng family.

“Feng Wuyin...” Ye Qingtang muttered softly.

Before long, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed slightly.

If Ye Qingtang did not remember wrongly, the historical records stated that Feng Jiuyou had a very good playmate who was skilled in the Nine Heavens Raging Aura. However, he was taken away by the Heavenly Demon Tribe when he was very young and used as a blood sacrifice by them.

However, Ye Qingtang did not know if that playmate of Feng Jiuyou was Feng Wuyin.

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang looked at Feng Wuyin. “Wuyin, do you know the Nine Heavens Raging Aura?”

Feng Jiuyou and Feng Wuyin stopped in their tracks.

Before Feng Wuyin could say anything, Feng Jiuyou interrupted, “Sister Ye Yue, how did you know... Feng Wuyin didn’t use the Nine Heavens Raging Aura just now... In our entire Feng family, only Feng Wuyin knows this technique. This is Wuyin’s supreme martial arts ability!”

“Oh.”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Feng Wuyin was the only person in the Feng family who knew the Nine Heavens Raging Aura?

If that was the case, Feng Wuyin should be that playmate of Feng Jiuyou, who was captured and sacrificed by the Heavenly Demon Tribe, right?

Looking at Feng Wuyin, Ye Qingtang felt rather conflicted.

This innocent and pure youth’s tragic fate had long been destined by history. No one could change it, and no one dared to change it.

‘When Ye Qingtang returned to her senses, she saw that Feng Wuyin was standing beside her and staring at her with his big, watery eyes.

“Sister Ye Yue, are you homesick?” Feng Wuyin asked..
