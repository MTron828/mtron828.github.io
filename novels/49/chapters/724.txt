“I’ve already said it clearly that I cannot accept you. There’s no need for you to say anything further. Please return.” Perfected Xuanchen shook his head, evidently unwilling to speak to Ye Qingtang anymore.

“Ye Chen, my master has made his stand clear, and you should not insist anymore. If you’re unwilling to leave, I can only ‘invite’ you out.” Yan Shu warned immediately after understanding his Master’s intention.

Completely ignoring Yan Shu’s warning, Ye Qingtang looked at Perfected Xuanchen and said, “Don’t you wish to know what my second apprenticeship gift is?”

Perfected Xuanchen remained silent, making clear his intention for Ye Qingtang to leave.

Yan Shu’s brows were slightly furrowed as he took a few steps forward, preparing to personally shoo this ignorant young man away.

However…

“My second apprenticeship gift is to invite a blacksmith master, Master Du, to tailor a sword using the Millennium Meteoric Iron just for you,” Ye Qingtang said immediately.

Both Perfected Xuanchen and Yan Shu were stunned by Ye Qingtang’s words.

“You said Master Du?’ Perfected Xuanchen asked.

“Yes. Master Du from the Bliss Forging Workshop.” Ye Qingtang nodded

“Don’t kid around!” Yan Shu’s face darkened immediately. “It’s not a lie that you have the Millennium Meteoric Iron, but if you said that you can request Master Du successfully, it is impossible.”

Yan Shu naturally knew of Master Du.

Perfected Xuanchen wished to forge a Millennium Meteoric Iron sword and had to first find a blacksmith master who could forge the Millennium Meteoric Iron. In the Nine Nights Dynasty, there was only one person who possessed such a craft, which was Bliss Forging Workshop’s Master Du.

To request his help, Perfected Xuanchen had sent his disciples to Master Du countless times and even personally looked for him just to seek his promise in forging a sword for him. Yet despite so, Master Du still refused to meet Perfected Xuanchen, much less agree to make a sword.

Everyone knew that Master Du was aloof and had a weird personality. There were numerous people who requested for his service, but the number of people who succeeded could be counted with one’s fingers. In recent years, Master Du had never agreed to forge a sword for a single person. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Perfected Xuanchen was not the only one who was given a cold shoulder; even the Nine Nights Dynasty’s premier, Ouyang Family Clan Master, and Tiangang Sect’s Sect Master were also rejected plenty of times.

This man was so young. How could he possibly request for Master Du’s service successfully?

Not mentioning Yan Shu’s disbelief, even Perfected Xuanchen thought that Ye Qingtang spoke recklessly out of anxiety.

“I’m not kidding around,” Ye Qingtang said calmly.

Perfected Xuanchen said in a low voice, “If you really can ask Master Du to forge a sword for me, I’ll accept you. If not, don’t stay here any longer.” While Millennium Meteoric Iron was precious, it was nothing but a useless metal if no one could forge it.

If Ye Qingtang could really ask Master Du successfully, one would really be astonished.

However, Perfected Xuanchen did not believe it and merely wanted the stubborn young man to leave as soon as possible.

A trace of a smile emerged within Ye Qingtang when she heard, and she confirmed with him calmly. “Is what you said valid? If I can request for Master Du’s service successfully, will you really make an exception and accept me as your disciple?”

“My words are naturally valid.” Perfected Xuanchen nodded.

Ye Qingtang beamed and immediately bowed. “Please wait for a while then. I’ll invite Master Du over.” Then, Ye Qingtang walked out of the hall herself without waiting for Yan Shu to chase her out.
