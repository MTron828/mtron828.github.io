Chapter 2647 Temple Holy Lord (4)

Perhaps she could understand the meaning behind the yellow dog’s words now.

She would eventually kill herself.

Could it be that in her previous life, the Temple of Paragon’s Holy Lord had killed her in this past era?!

If she could understand it this way, everything would make sense.

However, Ye Qingtang did not expect the Temple of Paragon’s Holy Lord to have any reason to kill her. She couldn’t possibly anger the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon so much just because she looked like her.

was so

If the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon was so petty, Ye Qingtang believed that it was impossible for her to become an Immortal Emperor.

Regardless, that possibility still existed.

Ye Qingtang made up her mind that no matter what, she must try her best to distance herself from that Temple of Paragon’s Holy Lord.

She could not afford to offend her at all.

In this era, the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon had not died yet. It was even possible that she was at her peak. If she had really died in her hands in her previous life… this manner of death… was a little too underserved.

Ye Qingtang remained outside and was in no hurry to enter the depths. She would enter after the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon had walked further away, so that they would not bump into each other.

The other powerful figures now looked at Ye Qingtang in a drastically different light.

There was no longer the earlier indifference and disdain. Instead, there was fear and unease.

The reason was very simple. Ye Qingtang’s appearance was exactly the same as that Immortal Emperor, who had killed so many people earlier!

“This… this woman… could she be a clone… of that Immortal Emperor?!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

One of the Emperor-level cultivators looked at Ye Qingtang nervously.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Was she destined to always be a clone?

In her own era, she was treated as a clone. Now that she had come to this past era, she was still being treated as a clone… did she have the word “clone” written all over her face??

“No… this aura doesn’t feel like a clone… could she be her twin sister?!”

“Twin sisters… yes, that’s very possible!”

“Twin sisters… that’s not important. She can’t be an Immortal Emperor too, right…”

Ye Qingtang was not interested in the crowd’s discussion. She just waited quietly at the side.

It was not until late at night that Ye Qingtang finally took action. As everyone watched, she strode into the depths.

And this time, no one dared to stop Ye Qingtang. That powerful Immortal Emperor from earlier today was a lesson learned. After all, these two people looked exactly the same.

No one dared to stop them.

Late at night, the depths of the Fourth Domain legacy were bone-chillingly cold. An oppressive aura enveloped everything, and the air was filled with the faint smell of blood.

Ye Qingtang was not surprised by this.

Countless major and minor factions had entered the depths, including the top factions from the Divine Venerate Domain. The first-rate factions would not hesitate to slaughter those weaker factions and independent cultivators who managed to sneak in.
