Chapter 1348 Constellations 2

The radiant object shook slightly, and the largest constellation made of ten-stars was surrounded by extremely bright radiance.

“This is the ten-star constellation and the best place for cultivation. There was one person who entered for three days and reached the Holy Venerate stage.”

Three days to reach the Holy Venerate stage?

Ye Qingtang was shocked as she stared at the ten-star nebula.

It took her three hundred years in her previous life to reach that stage.

As long as she entered the ten-star nebula, it would only take her three days to reach the stage that she took three hundred years in her previous life…

Ye Qingtang felt excited.

“This is the nine-star constellation.” The radiant object spoke again, and the other constellation was surrounded with radiance.

“There was also another person who entered and reached the Heavenly Venerate stage in four to five days.”

Ye Qingtang was totally shocked as she stared at the nine-star constellation.

Just the cultivation speed in the nine-star constellation was astonishing enough, not to mention the ten-star constellation.

Ye Qingtang lacked cultivation. Her strength stopped improving after she reached the Central Mainland. She was about to face the Ancient You Clan. If she did not cultivate, how could she get little You Yun back?

“No wonder… The Holy Lord of Shadows sealed the illusion in his secret room. The speed of cultivation is unbelievable.” Ye Qingtang was filled with excitement as she stared at the constellations. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The reason why the Holy Lord of Shadows could rule the entire Central Mainland was due to the help from the illusory space.

And Ye Qingtang also entered the space now.

“If you want to level up, these two constellations are the most suitable ones for you. They should help with your cultivation,” the radiant object said.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and said, “If I chose one of the constellations, can I leave anytime I want?”

“Of course. This is a reward for you, and no one will force you to do anything.” The radiant object’s voice was filled with a trace of a smile.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes sparkled. She was really lucky!

If the Ming Wang did not have the intention to test her, how could she know about the existence of the illusory space?

“I want to enter the nine-star constellation.” Ye Qingtang made her choice.

Though the effects of the ten-star constellation were more tempting, Ye Qingtang did not want to be too greedy.

“That’s a good choice.” It seemed like the radiant object was laughing.

As Ye Qingtang made her choice, the rest of the constellations disappeared in the darkness, and only the nine-star constellation was left.

“Walk into the constellation, and you’ll enter that world,” the radiant object said.

Ye Qingtang did not know what world the radiant object was referring to. However, it would definitely be extraordinary as it could help her increase her strength exponentially.

Ye Qingtang carried the little white tiger and jumped towards the illusory nine-star constellation.

Her figure soon disappeared from the constellations as if she had never existed.

Ye Qingtang sensed a peculiar feeling. It seemed like she was soaked in cold spring water. She felt that she started to lose her consciousness slowly.

Bolts of light flashed across her eyes swiftly, and she could not capture any information.

But soon, the image in front of Ye Qingtang changed.

The shadows dispersed, and mountains and rivers suddenly appeared. She was awakened by the sound of bird tweets.
