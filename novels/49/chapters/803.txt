Chapter 804 Consequence of Your Own Sin (2)

Ye Qingtang’s figure was like a ghost that swept across the guards.

The guards all collapsed onto the ground instantly.

The Emperor Dowager was stunned. She looked toward Ye Qingtang as all the ten elite guards she brought were lying on the ground now.

Ye Qingtang immediately took a leap and landed behind the Emperor Dowager. The Demonic Blood Sword in her hand was placed on the Emperor Dowager’s neck.

The arrogance in the Emperor Dowager was immediately replaced by astonishment.

“If you kill me here, none of you can leave here alive!” The Emperor Dowager pretended to be calm and said.

“Why is that so?” Ye Qingtang asked slowly.

The Emperor Dowager sneered. “I am cooperating with the Qin family. If there is no information from me that is sent to the Qin family, they will lead an army of a hundred thousand people here and enclose the palace. You will never be able to leave this place alive.”

The Emperor Dowager had planned long ago for this day to arrive. She had the perfect backup plan for herself.

“Qin Long? I forgot to tell you something.” Ye Qingtang stared at the Emperor Dowager without any trace of panic.

“What?” the Emperor Dowager said.

“Qin Long was dead just now,” Ye Qingtang said calmly.

“What?! Qin Long is dead? How is that possible!” The Emperor Dowager was shocked.

Qu Xiangyang said, “Qin Long was killed by our Young Lord. Emperor Dowager… even if you die here today, no one will rebel.”

The Emperor Dowager was stunned and then noticed the presence of Qu Xiangyang.

She remembered those who were left here by the woman clearly. She ordered Qin Long to murder those who blocked her way.

Today, it should have been the day Qu Xiangyang died.

However…

He was still alive and standing in front of her?

“You chose the wrong person on your last move,” Ye Qingtang said slowly.

The Emperor Dowager’s face was filled with surprise, and she fell to the ground. The gracefulness on her face disappeared.

“How… how is it possible? How did Qin Long die?” She could not believe it. Her plans were totally destroyed?

The Emperor Dowager raised her eyes and looked at Ye Qingtang, who was holding the Demonic Blood Sword.

It was clear who the murderer of Qin Long was when Qu Xiangyang called her as the Young Lord.

“You! It’s you! Both you and your mother are b*tches! You… you ruined me! I will never let you go even if I become a ghost!”

The Emperor Dowager’s eyes were filled with craziness. She threw herself towards Ye Qingtang insanely.

Ye Qingtang kicked her towards the ground. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Mother…” The little emperor immediately leaned himself beside the Emperor Dowager.

Though she wanted to kill him just now, she was still his mother.

“I lost… I totally lost…” The Emperor Dowager could feel the pain from her entire body as a result of the kick. A trace of malice appeared in her eyes as the little Emperor was trying to get her up nervously.

She suddenly stretched out her hands seized his neck.

“I will not give up so easily! The rotting bone powder has no cure. You are meant to die! He’s your only son. If he dies, there will be chaos in the Nine Nights Dynasty. Hahaha… I will not lose! I need the entire Nine Nights Dynasty to die along with me!”

The little Emperor’s face turned purple, and he stared at his ferocious mother. He could never imagine that his own mother would want to kill him.
