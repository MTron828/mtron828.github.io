Chapter 2011: Relentless (3)

The eight tribe leaders and Ming Wang all looked confused as the three ambassadors left the main hall.

“This... isn’t the Ancient You Clan acting too arrogantly? How do they dare challenge the Crimson League so directly?” The Demon Tribe Leader was shocked.

How ridiculous was this?

“They’re just looking for their own destruction,” the Goblin Tribe Leader sneered with a cold laugh.

“This is great. We were still worrying about how to deal with the Ancient You Clan, but now that they have angered the Crimson League themselves, it’s going to save us a lot of trouble.”

The eight tribe leaders were taken aback by the Ancient You Clan’s arrogance but nevertheless glad at the Crimson League’s declaration of war against them.

“Holy Lord, what will be our next move?”

“I want you to gather all information on the Ancient You Clan at once,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Yes,” they acknowledged her order and retreated.

Xue Fu ordered the blood in the main hall to be cleared up. As they were all distracted, Ye Qingtang dragged the ‘dead’ You Qiong from the pool of blood.

You Qiong who was supposed to already be dead suddenly came to life as Ye Qingtang brought him to a place where no one was looking. He took huge gulps of air, as though he had really been killed off previously.

“You did well just now. You know what you need to do after returning to the Ancient You Clan?” Ye Qingtang asked him slowly.

He had already contacted Ye Qingtang before arriving and the reason she had pretended to kill him was so that Bai Zhi wouldn’t harm him in her anger.

“I will make sure to carry out what the Holy Lord has tasked me with. It’s just that...” You Qiong looked at her in apprehension.

“I’ve already gathered some information on the girl that the Holy Lord asked me to investigate.”

She had asked him to investigate a girl previously, someone that the Ancient You Clan had brought over from the Central Mainland. You Qiong knew that the girl was the reason how the Ancient You Clan had become so powerful so quickly, but...

He hadn’t heard much about her after returning to the Ancient You Clan.

Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed slightly and she sighed softly.

Where had the Ancient You Clan hidden little You Yun?

Once the Crimson League and the Ancient You Clan went into war, they wouldn’t stop until one of them was destroyed. She would take that opportunity to look for little You Yun and rescue little Luo Xue at the same time.

But now... L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“There’s something else.” Ye Qingtang paused and asked You Qiong to lean in. An expression of shock crossed his face as she whispered a few words in his ear.

“You can return now if you understand. I will inform you if there is any further news,” she said.

“Alright.” You Qiong wiped the blood from himself and left via the secret passage in the Temple of Shadows.

This was sufficient. She had stoked the flames enough.

Covered in blood, You Qiong headed back to the Ancient You Clan in a pathetic state. Elder Mo, who had been awaiting good news, froze when he saw You Qiong returning covered in blood.

“What happened?” he asked.

You Qiong’s face was pathetic as he knelt to the ground with a thud.

“I deserve to die. I did as you asked and went to the Crimson League to seek mercy, only for them to retaliate and try to kill us off. I only escaped by feigning death so that I could report to you.”

He said this all with great sincerity, tears streaming down his face.

Elder Mo’s face got even darker.

“The Crimson League isn’t willing to make peace?”

You Qiong nodded and said, “The Crimson League said that the Temple of Shadows belonged to them in the first place and they wanted to help it become the strongest force in the Central Mainland. The only reason they sent people over was because the Ancient You Clan has been increasing its scope of influence...”
