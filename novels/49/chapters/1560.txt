Chapter 1561 Thousand Treasures Pavilion 2

What the current Ye Qingtang needed the most was to raise her skills, so items that could refine one’s constitution and increase one’s cultivation speed was what she required.Not only did the Jiang Family have master-grade elixirs, but even grand master-grade elixirs were available. However, the number of honor points required was overwhelming.

The two youths finished exchanging their items and made their leave. However, on their way out, they were slightly surprised to notice Jiang Shaobai and immediately walked over.

“Shaobai, are you also here because you heard that the Thousand Treasures Pavilion just stocked some Grand Divine Pills?” There was a strange hint of fear in their voices when they spoke.

Jiang Shaobai grinned as she hooked her arms onto Ye Qingtang’s arm and said, “I’m here to bring Sister Qing around and have a look.”

It was only after Jiang Shaobai spoke that those two youths noticed the stunning lady standing beside her. Furthermore, a look of surprise passed their eyes after hearing Jiang Shaobai saying ‘Sister Qing’.

Ye Qingtang did not notice the unusual looks in their eyes as all her attention was fixed on the three words, Grand Divine Pill.

The Grand Divine Pill was truly, as its name suggested, a grandmaster-grade pill. It was extremely scarce even among the major family clans, and Ye Qingtang did not think that this Thousand Treasure Pavilion would actually have such an impressive pill.

If the Qi Yuan Pill was said to slowly nourish and improve one’s constitution, the Grand Divine Pill could completely renew one’s constitution.

This was exactly what Ye Qingtang needed!

Cultivation was one matter, but if she could change her constitution, her cultivation speed would naturally increase multiple folds.

Those two youths did not say much and merely looked at Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai oddly before leaving.

Although Ye Qingtang wished to look at more treasures in the Thousand Treasure Pavilion, she did not have a single honor point and could not exchange for any items even if she looked.

Jiang Shaobai endlessly introduced many things regarding Taiyuan Valley to Ye Qingtang. Compared to the quiet Jiang Qi, Jiang Shaobai’s introduction was much more detailed.

The Jiang Family’s honor points were not only used to exchange for treasures in the Thousand Treasure Pavilion.

It could also be used in the sacred ground.

The Jiang Family’s sacred ground was where spirit energy was the richest. It was said that cultivating in it for a day was equivalent to cultivating outside for thirty days. Many Jiang Family disciples yearned to enter the sacred ground, but unfortunately, the honor points required was too high, and they simply could not afford it.

After Jiang Shaobai’s introduction, Ye Qingtang increasingly understood the value of honor points in Taiyuan Valley.

To increase her skills as quickly as possible, she had to start from gaining honor points.

And honor points were obtained through contributions to the Jiang Family.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes brightened when she heard that. After bidding goodbye to Jiang Shaobai, she went to the elders’ residence and looked for the Domain Monarch Founder Jiang Yu directly... Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Are you getting used to the valley?” Jiang Yu was seated in a chair right now. His tiny frame was seated behind a table, revealing only a small head, which, however, had a mature-looking face.

Only the cabinet elders were aware of his return to the Taiyuan Valley, and no one else knew that he had already returned.

After all, Jiang Yu truly did not want too many people to see his current “tiny” state.

“Thank you for your concern. All is well.” Ye Qingtang replied respectfully.
