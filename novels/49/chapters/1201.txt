1202 Blood Battle 4

The Blood Moon Elder was breaking out in a cold sweat profusely, but the excruciating pain kept him more clear-headed.

“No matter what… I will not let you go there. Kill that thought of yours!” The Blood Moon Elder grunted loudly.

Nonetheless, the middle-aged man did not speak, and he slashed with his saber.

The Blood Moon Elder’s enormous body did not retreat, and he advanced instead, welcoming all the aura from the saber straight on.

In the next second, the Blood Moon Elder’s chest area was crushed by the saber aura, and fresh blood stained his body red.

“Haha… Hahahaha!!” The Blood Moon Elder looked at his severely-wounded body and laughed wildly. “Satisfying… satisfying!!”

“Are you crazy?” The middle-aged man looked at the Blood Moon Elder without emotion.

“Hahaha, how can one not act a little wild in their lifetime?!” Then, the Blood Moon Elder continued to close in on the middle-aged man with an insane expression.

“You have a death wish.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The middle-aged man snickered coldly, and the long saber condensed a frightening destructive force.

Subsequently, the saber moved in an arc and advanced irresistibly.

The Blood Moon Elder’s perfect defense was utterly weak before the middle-aged man and his long saber.

Thud!

The saber chopped off Blood Moon Elder’s entire right leg. Without the support of a leg, the enormous body lost balance and fell to the ground immediately.

“You bit off more than you can chew.” The middle-aged man snickered coldly upon seeing the sight.

Then, the middle-aged man did not spare the Blood Moon Elder another look, walked past him directly, and chased in the direction of Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue.

However, at this instant, the Blood Moon Elder raised his perfect left arm and slammed the ground heavily.

Boom…

Boom! Boom!

Under this huge force, the ground ahead shattered completely and formed a huge chasm that could not be leaped over.

“Don’t you think of leaving!” Blood Moon Elder laughed.

“Is that it?” The middle-aged man’s lips tugged up slightly, and he wanted to fly in the air instead. If he was unable to walk on the ground, traveling by air was the same too.

Yet, at this moment, the middle-aged man’s expression changed. He was actually unable to fly… Was a mystic technique laid in the sky here?!

“Hahahaha, I have set a mystic technique here long ago. You cannot fly nor walk forward…” The Blood Moon Elder chortled.

“You’re courting death!!” Realizing that he could not continue to pursue his target, the middle-aged man was utterly enraged, and his long saber slashed at Blood Moon Elder’s neck heavily.

Puff!

A streak of blood splashed by along with the slit at his throat.

In a few breaths, large gushes of blood spewed out from Blood Moon Elder’s neck and painted the ground bright red instantly.

Seeing that the Blood Moon Elder was completely breathless, the middle-aged man clenched his teeth. “You all… will not be able to escape…”

Afterward, the middle-aged man turned around and left.

Nonetheless, the Blood Moon Elder’s tightly-shut eyes opened suddenly, and he raised his left arm at top speed.

“What?!”

The middle-aged man was stunned. Never had he thought that the Blood Moon Elder, who was slit at the neck, had not died!

“Got… got… you… Ha… Ha… Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!” Blood Moon Elder gripped on the middle-aged man tightly with his left palm as he laughed wildly. It was just that his neck was slit, and every word he spoke accelerated the blood loss at his neck.
