Ye Qingtang finally sighed.

Before Ye Qingtang could sigh fully, the elderly suddenly spoke. “We can add Spirit Crystal powder into the Qingxuan Steel as well, right?”

“…” Then, Ye Qingtang understood why the old imp was so insistent on the black gold meteorite iron.

It must be that he saw the process of her forging the dagger and remembered her Spirit Crystals!

“Yes…” Ye Qingtang replied helplessly.

“Qingxuan Steel it is then!” The elderly ordered heartily.

Ye Qingtang face palmed quietly. Was it still too late for her to back out now?

The truth had proved that it was too late for Ye Qingtang to back out even if she wanted to.

For the entire afternoon, she was dragged around the Sword Spirit Workshop by the elderly and did not do anything else other than forging the Daybreak Crossbow with him.

Only after night fell could Ye Qingtang then desperately reject the elderly’s request to continue forging, and she flew out the Sword Spirit Workshop.

The elderly could not help but sigh as he watched Ye Qingtang running away.

The incharge found the elderly’s behavior funny yet did not dare to reveal it.

Although Elder Mo accepted Ye Qingtang as his disciple, since she was an in-name disciple and not considered an official disciple, she did not need to offer incense and serve tea. This matter had not circulated in the inner sect.

Ye Qingtang did not place this matter to heart. On usual days, she cultivated and did her missions as needed. She spent the Xuanming points on the Spirit Consonance River and occasionally used the Quenching Flame Pill and Ice Skin Powder to speed up her cultivation. Gradually, her skills improved.

However, while the cultivation method using Quenching Flame Pill and Ice Skin powder was good, it could not be used for a long period of time. This method would be the most efficient only on the first time, and the effects would naturally decrease once the skills increased. Although the improvement would not be as shocking as before, the speed of cultivation was still faster than normal.

However, the more one’s skills improved, the more Ye Qingtang found the speed of cultivation to slow down.

From the first stage of the Second Heaven to the second stage, Ye Qingtang spent one entire month to advance. Although this speed was a few times faster than normal disciples, it was still very slow to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang noticed that if her spirit root did not continue to upgrade, her cultivation speed would probably become even slower.

However, no matter what method she used in the few months, there was no trace of her spirit root upgrading.

“I must obtain the Black Heaven Water.” After meditation, Ye Qingtang calmed her heart, and the need for the Black Heaven Water was increasingly clear.

There were still three months to the start of the inner sect mystic realm. Although Ye Qingtang did have some fame in the inner sect after the Life and Death Ring, there was still a distance away from being an elite disciple.

To increase her position in the inner sect in three months, she had to find a suitable method. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At that thought, Ye Qingtang recalled something immediately.

In another half a month, it would be time for the Three Sect Competition.

This competition was among Xuanling Sect and two other sects, which had been going on for many years. During the competition, the sects would send their own inner sect disciples, and elite disciples would not battle according to the rules.

To Ye Qingtang, perhaps this was an opportunity.

Xuanling Sect had been suppressed for many years in the Three Sect Competition. If she could participate in the Three Sect Competition and achieve pretty good results, maybe she had a chance of becoming an elite disciple and thus obtain the chance to enter the mystic realm!
