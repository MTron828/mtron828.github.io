Chapter 2705: Destruction (4)

“Actually, we should be glad that this place is just a memory. If it is real, we would be the first batch to die.” Zhang Chi chuckled as he surveyed the shocked group.

Lan Shan glanced at Zhang Chi. “Junior Brother Zhang Chi, are you still human? How can you still smile now?”

Zhang Chi shook his head and said, “What we saw was something that happened in the past. No matter what, it cannot be reversed. Moreover, we are one step closer to the truth of the Fourth Domain’s destruction. Why shouldn’t I smile?”

Before Lan Shan could say anything, a cold glint appeared in the eyes of the High Monk. He looked at the black shadow in the sky. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“You released a Heaven-Devouring Beast without even uttering a single word and swallowed hundreds of thousands of lives. Your sins are grave. Please stop.” The High Monk’s voice was cold.

The black shadow that had been silent the entire time suddenly let out a bone-chilling smile. His gaze swept across everyone present like an eternal beam before a chuckle came out of his lips. “The Fourth Domain has the power of absolute dominance… and the power of the Heavenly Dao is rich here. Can you lend it to me?”

“Heavenly Dao?!”

As the black shadow’s ethereal voice faded, the expressions of the monks and Daoists all changed in unison.

The Fourth Domain contained the terrifying power of the Heavenly Dao. But they never expected that the black shadow’s goal was actually the power of the Heavenly Dao!

“You want to borrow the power of the Heavenly Dao? Have you asked Tian?” The Silver Star Holy Lord asked the black shadow.

“Tian?”

The black shadow’s smile grew wider.

“Do I need to ask Tian if I want the power of the Heavenly Dao?” The black shadow smiled.

“You have violated the rules. Please stop now, do not fall into the abyss,” the High Monk said softly.

However, the black shadow did not continue speaking. One of its eyes turned into a black crescent moon that absorbed the power of the Heavenly Dao contained in the Fourth Domain.

“Stubborn fool.”

The High Monk snorted coldly as a golden glint surfaced in his eyes.

“Heavenly Dao Reincarnation!”

The High Monk shouted angrily.

The world seemed to change in an instant. All the luster disappeared as if they had entered eternal darkness without a single trace of light.

At that moment, even Ye Qingtang and the rest could not see any light. It was as if everything was still and time could not continue to flow.

An unknown period of time passed. It felt like a blink of an eye, but also as if several reincarnation cycles had happened.

When the world started revolving again and finally regained some light, Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised.

The capital, which had been completely destroyed by the Heaven-Devouring Beast just now, had actually returned to its original state. The hundreds of thousands of lives devoured by the Heaven-Devouring Beast had been resurrected.

It was as if time had reversed and everything had returned to normal.

“Reincarnation Divine Art…”

The black shadow could sense that the large amount of Heavenly Energy he had absorbed earlier had disappeared from his body again. Everything had been absorbed by the cycle of reincarnation.

“You came alone to challenge my Fourth Domain. Are you too arrogant or did you underestimate the Fourth Domain?” the High Monk said coldly.

“Heh, you are indeed merciful… you’re willing to spend so much effort just to save those people who deserve to die.”

Once again, the black shadow’s laughter rang out.
