Chapter 2175: 10 Days (2)

Lei Yan was dumbstruck. He never imagined that Qin Feng would launch such a major move right from the start.

Brother, why so much hate! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

We can always talk things through!

Seeing the holy light about to make contact with him, Lei Yan recalled Ye Qing’s earlier instructions. Taking a deep breath, his body swelled up like a ball.

“What is this technique of Lei Yan’s?” The crowd was taken aback by Lei Yan’s sudden inflation. Even more shocking was that the moment Lei Yan’s body ballooned up to the maximum, the breath he had been holding was suddenly unleashed.

A hurricane-like cold wind radiated from the bottom of his feet as Lei Yan exhaled. The cold air immediately enveloped Lei Yan.

“Boom!”

A loud boom and dust flew everywhere. Qin Feng’s attack created a mass of smoke and fog, such that no one could see Lei Yan at all.

Qin Feng remained expressionless.

The fight was over.

Just as Qin Feng was preparing to turn and leave, a gasp rippled across the crowd of spectators.

Somewhat dubious, Qin Feng instinctively turned.

And was dumbstruck by what he saw...

Lei Yan was covered in a thick layer of ice. The ice completely enveloped Lei Yan, as if he was encased inside a huge block of ice.

And Qin Feng’s earlier attack had landed on that ice. Multiple shards of ice were scattered on the ground, but Lei Yan was completely unharmed.

Qin Feng: “...”

The spectators were all dumbfounded.

“Damn, what technique is that? What did Lei Yan do?”

“Shameless, too shameless. I thought Lei Yan had become so bold as to challenge Qin Feng. I didn’t expect...”

“Utterly shameless. I’ve really got to give it to him.”

The spectators snapped out of their daze.

The rule of this fight was that Lei Yan would win if he could endure 10 moves from Qin Feng. Now, Lei Yan was hiding inside a big block of ice. How would Qin Feng be able to hit him?!

They have met shameless people before but have never met a person that shameless!

Come out and fight if you have got the guts!

At this moment, Lei Yan was just hiding inside the ice. He could see what was happening outside, but couldn’t hear the words of the spectators.

Qin Feng’s face darkened. He never imagined that Lei Yan had such a move.

The crowd’s discussion became increasingly heated. Even Qin Xuan, who had come to watch the fight, was also stunned. But he smiled on seeing Qin Feng’s grim face.

“Brother Feng, it’s just a block of ice. Just shatter it. It shouldn’t be that difficult for you, right?” Qin Xuan’s casual voice drifted into Qin Feng’s ears.

Qin Feng took a deep breath. This farce seemed to have brought all his long-suppressed feelings to the fore. He was like a clown. Everything he did was a joke to others.

His gaze subconsciously drifted over to Ye Qing. He couldn’t understand what this Teacher Ye was trying to do. He just wanted this to end as soon as possible.

Qin Feng took another deep breath and his aura surged. He suddenly unleashed all the power in his body toward Lei Yan.

Cracking sounds filled the air as Qin Feng executed a number of consecutive attacks at the ice. Layers of shattered ice flew in all directions.

At the sight of the endless stream of shattered ice, Nangong Lie scurried over to Ye Qingtang’s side.

“Boss, can Lei Yan really withstand ten moves from Qin Feng?”
