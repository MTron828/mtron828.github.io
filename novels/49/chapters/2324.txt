Chapter 2325: New Students Report (3)

The atmosphere had turned very awkward. Ten pairs of eyes were now all fixed upon Ye Qingtang.

“Boss…”

“Teacher Ye…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the anticipatory gazes of those two groups of brats and she quietly sat down on a chair. Just as everyone felt that Ye Qing had made his decision, he suddenly lifted a pair of chopsticks. “Have you guys eaten? If not, sit down and eat with us.”

Everyone, “…”

Hang Wenwei and the others were filled with hope at his words. They immediately bustled over and sat as close to Ye Qing as possible. In fact, the four of them took up the four closest seats to Ye Qing, completely surrounding him.

Lei Yan, Nangong Lie and the rest fumed at the sight.

What a bunch of vixens. Boss had yet to officially become their teacher but they were already angling to be his favored pets?!

The burning desire to drive out those little vixens raged in the hearts of those teenagers. Without another word, they pulled Mu Ziying off her seat. Mu Ziying had been sitting at the table with her chopsticks raised, ready to continue eating.

Mu Ziying, “…”

She was hungry! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lei Yan and the others didn’t care. They forced Mu Ziying into Ye Qing’s arms, before shooting Hang Wenwei and his gang smug looks.

Vying to be the teacher’s pet?

Their Little Senior Sister had never lost!

Meanwhile, Mu Ziying herself was bewildered. She sat on Ye Qing’s lap with a dazed look.

Hang Wenwei and the others remained silent.

Damn, they had no females in their group. They couldn’t use this trick.

Ye Qingtang was getting a headache from the antics of those brats. Looking at the dazed Mu Ziying, who was still pitifully clutching her own chopsticks, Ye Qingtang decided to ignore the rest. So she picked up some food to feed Mu Ziying.

The bickering continued throughout the entire dinner. If not for Ye Qingtang keeping the peace, the table might have already been smashed into two by those hot-blooded males.

Whenever Ye Qingtang finished eating, her bowl would be snatched away and piled high with food again.

The entire time, Ye Qingtang didn’t mention her decision whether to keep them but this meal sparked off hope in the hearts of Hang Wenwei and the rest. They all took it as a sign that they could stay.

Although Ye Qingtang did plan to teach them, she had no intention of becoming their official teacher.

After all, she would not be staying for long in the Netherworld Academy. She would leave after the Inter-Academy Competition. Hang Wenwei and his group were different from Lei Yan and the others, they each had their own teachers. After she left, they would have to return to their own teachers.

She had agreed to Wu Fengling’s request because she respected him and because she wanted to secure a future for Lei Yan and the others.

In the future after she left, she believed that Wu Fengling would remember her favor for him, and choose good teachers for her students.

Then she would be able to leave in peace. Of course, Lei Yan and the others had no idea of all that.

Amongst Ye Qingtang’s students, only Yun Chen had yet to undergo the selection trials. The next morning would be the selection for the medicine faculty.

The medicine faculty’s selection trial was different from the other faculties. They did not compete using weapons nor did they have to battle on the platform. They competed using their elixir-refining skills.

The next morning, Ye Qingtang led Yun Chen and the rest to the site of the medicine faculty trials. Lei Yan and the others had completed their own trials but all of them still showed up today to cheer for Yun Chen.

Even Hang Wenwei and his group followed close behind, completely ignoring the derisive looks of Lei Yan and the rest.

As this big group swaggered over, they attracted quite a bit of attention from the medicine faculty students.
