Chapter 2756: Tian (5)

Due to the fact that the God of Nature had destroyed the entire upper realm and snatched away the Heavenly Dao energy from thousands of Perfected Immortals in there, turning the upper realm into a land of death, Ye Qingtang had to rebuild the place.

“Ling Yan… I’ll talk to Shi Tian…” Ye Qingtang stared at Ling Yan and said softly.

“Oh?” Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly. “What did you call me? You didn’t call me that last night…”

Before Ling Yan could finish his sentence, Ye Qingtang’s ears turned red and she covered his mouth.

It was only when Ye Qingtang regained her composure that she released Ling Yan, who was smiling.

“Go on, I’ll wait for you,” Ling Yan said.

“Okay.”

Ye Qingtang nodded and disappeared.

...

Cursed Hell.

Ye Qingtang strolled in.

Looking at this land of despair, she recalled the time when she first entered it.

“Shi Tian, come out,” Ye Qingtang said softly as she sat cross-legged on the ground.

......

By the time Ye Qingtang completed her sentence, Shi Tian had already arrived beside her.

“You’re here again.” The man stared at Ye Qingtang.

“Yes, I’m here to talk to you.” Ye Qingtang smiled. “Do you want to go out and help me rebuild the upper realm?”

“No need. This place is quite good.” Shi Tian shook his head and stared at Ye Qingtang. “You are the first person who has the ability of Tian before truly becoming Tian.”

“Is that so?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Not only that, but you can also retain your emotions. It’s rare. The price for becoming Tian is to lose all emotions. Why didn’t you?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“It’s because of the Heavenly Dao Devouring Bloodline.” Ye Qingtang smiled. “After becoming Tian, the Heavenly Dao mark will be placed in your body. Those who become Tian will act according to the Heavenly Dao mark… unfortunately, my Heavenly Dao mark has been devoured by the Heavenly Dao Devouring Bloodline, so…”

“I see. Heavenly Dao Devouring Bloodline? This is the first time I have heard of it,” Shi Tian said.

Without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak, Shi Tian continued, “Never mind. You will replace me and become the new Tian. I hope that everything will become better under your rule.”

...

After leaving the cursed hell, Ye Qingtang returned to the upper realm.

“Greetings, Tian!”

The guards immediately knelt down.

Ye Qingtang, “…” She was really not used to being kowtowed to every day.

“Let’s go.”

Ye Qingtang dragged Lin Yan to the lower realm.

...

The Blue Sky Domain, Falling Sky Valley.

Ye Qingtang appeared out of nowhere.

“Today, in my capacity as Tian, I bestow upon you all the bodies of Perfected Immortals. You are to go to the upper realm and help reconstruct it.”

“Qingtang?!”

Ye Ling and the rest were shocked to see Ye Qingtang.

In the next second, everyone from the Falling Sky Valley flickered with golden light. Before anyone knew what was happening, they had disappeared from the Falling Sky Valley and arrived in the upper realm.

...

The Temple of Shadows.

Ming Wang, Ming Gu and the rest of the Temple of Shadows looked at Ye Qingtang standing in the air.

“Today, in my capacity as Tian, I will bestow upon you all the bodies of Perfected Immortals. You are to go to the upper realm and help reconstruct it.”

“Ah Yao?” Ming Gu looked puzzled.

“Ah Yao, what are you talking about?” The demon dragon looked puzzled.

However, just as it finished speaking, everyone from the Temple of Shadows disappeared and arrived at the upper realm.

Subsequently, Ye Qingtang personally went to the Jiang family and bestowed the Jiang family with the bodies of Perfected Immortals.

...

Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

Ye Qingtang also bestowed the people of the Dragon Emperor Clan and the Temple of Paragon Perfected Immortal bodies and brought them to the upper realm.

The Devil Cloud Sect was her last stop in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

Back then, Ye Qingtang had witnessed the revival of the Devil Cloud Sect Paragon in the Wailing Well. She still could not forget how powerful he was.

“You are… Tian…?”
