Chapter 1748: Fiendish Demon (1)

Qiu Chen had not detected Ye Qingtang’s presence yet. He just crouched by the waterfall, quietly washing himself. The moment he stood up, a petite figure walked out from a small forest by the side.

Ye Qingtang turned to look and was stunned.

The person who had just emerged from those trees was Qiu Ci!

Qiu Ci’s face was pale. She was dragging a large sack behind her, which was completely drenched in blood. One would wonder what was stored inside.

Even though she was looking at two familiar faces now, Ye Qingtang did not let down her guard at all. Having journeyed through the mountain valley, she was well aware of how terrible this demon-filled area was.

But both Qiu Chen and Qiu Ci were completely unharmed. Apart from their pale countenance, nothing seemed amiss.

“Brother Qiu Chen...” Qiu Ci raised her head timidly to look at Qiu Chen.

Qiu Chen shot her an impatient look. He suddenly reached out and smacked Qiu Ci to the ground.

“You fool. Go ahead and die here if you want to. But don’t drag me down with you.”

Sprawled down on the ground, Qiu Ci looked very pathetic as she stayed where she was.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help frowning at this familiar scene. She really didn’t understand why Qiu Chen always treated Qiu Ci in this cruel manner. Weren’t they family members? DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

But this scene alleviated some of Ye Qingtang’s wariness. She was still considering whether to ally herself with them, when Qiu Ci suddenly gave a wide grin as she chuckled.

“Hahaha...”

That laughter was very eerie. There were no signs of a young girl’s shyness and spirit, but was instead filled with a creepy malevolence.

Qiu Chen climbed to her feet and reached out to grab Qiu Chen’s arm. She tilted her head and smiled even wider. Her lips had split all the way up to her ears. It was like someone had slashed her face in half along her lips.

“Qiu Chen... brother... don’t... leave me behind...” Instead of a tidy row of human teeth between those lips, it was filled with the sharp, jagged fangs of a beast.

A blood-red tongue drooped down from Qiu Ci’s mouth, much longer than any normal human being’s!

Qiu Chen’s originally impatient expression also faded away to give rise to a malicious smile. The corners of his lips split open the same way as Qiu Ci’s, revealing a same set of razor-sharp teeth and long, blood-red tongue. That long tongue reached out and licked the still-wet blood off Qiu Ci’s face.

Ye Qingtang watched this entire scene in shock. She had been about to step out to reveal herself. But now, there was no way she was moving a single inch.

Almost immediately, Ye Qingtang’s eyes landed on the large, blood-soaked sack on the ground. The sack wriggled as if it contained something alive. Piteous whimpering could be heard from it.

“Qiu Chen” appeared to be angered by that whimpering. He suddenly raised one hand and sharp claws grew out of his long, slender fingers. Then he stabbed the sack with those claws.

A blood curdling cry rang out.

“Qiu Chen” grinned happily, before he twisted his claws and fresh blood pooled out of that sack. Those piteous whimpers were replaced by wretched wails.
