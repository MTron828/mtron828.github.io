Chapter 1509 Hunt Down 3

“What’s the matter? You couldn’t beat the Celestial Fairy to obtain the two Dharma treasures, so now you’re taking it out on me?” Ye Qingtang put on a mocking look while secretly looking for an escape route.

The old man’s expression stiffened.

“Little brat, you can spout whatever nonsense you want. We’ll see what else you can say later when I rip out your tongue,” the old man said with a cold smile. Then, he suddenly rushed downwards.

Ye Qingtang looked at the approaching old man, and her eyes narrowed. She clutched the little white tiger tightly, then jumped down a nearby slope.

The slope was not steep. When Ye Qingtang jumped, a lot of rubble came loose and rolled down. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Below the slope was a wide, low-lying valley, shrouded by layers of clouds.

Ye Qingtang clutched the little white tiger tightly in her arms. As they fell swiftly, many stones hit its furry head. Although it was not that painful, the little white tiger was unable to open its eyes under the bombardment.

“F*ck, are you jumping to your death here?” The little white tiger’s acute senses had already perceived that the valley beneath the clouds was filled with thick aura...

“If we don’t jump, we really will die.” Ye Qingtang was unusually calm. The old man was at least in the realm of a Holy Venerate. With her present powers, there was no way she could withstand him.

“...” The little white tiger immediately understood what Ye Qingtang meant, but...

What was below was even more difficult to deal with!

A billowing demonic aura mixed with the strong scent of blood obscured all other auras in the valley. At that moment, the old man’s only desire was to twist Ye Qingtang’s head off, so he flew over in pursuit.

Ye Qingtang, who continued to fall, did not know how far she had fallen, but the next second, she crashed into something warm and soft.

This feeling was extremely odd. Ye Qingtang felt something sticky under her hand, and there was something soft under her feet that prevented her from standing steadily.

A strong scent of blood choked her nostrils, as if forcing all the air out of her lungs.

The old man also flew downward. When he landed, his nostrils were similarly filled by the strong scent of blood. There seemed to be something strange amidst the clouds. He frowned slightly. Then, he caught sight of where Ye Qingtang had landed. Suspended in midair, he gathered a powerful beam of light in his hand and released it towards the spot Ye Qingtang had landed!

Boom!

A resounding crash immediately filtered down from the clouds.

The old man secretly smirked coldly. The surrounding scent of blood became a little stronger.

The girl was certainly dead.

The old man was certain that he had dealt Ye Qingtang a fatal blow. However, before he could fly away from this strange valley, a huge fin from within the valley suddenly broke through the clouds and flew towards the old man, who was about to leave.

The fin was so large that it spanned a hundred square meters!

The old man was suddenly smashed into the mountainside by the huge fish. If not for his great powers, all the bones in his body would have been crushed by the blow.

Even so, the force of the blow forced him to sink into the mountainside.

Puff...

A dreamy, ethereal voice suddenly rang out from within the valley.

Amidst the scent of blood, the huge, translucent fin had sliced through the clouds. An extremely thick demonic aura suddenly engulfed the entire valley!

As the strange voice rang out, the originally quiet valley was suddenly thrown into turmoil.
