Chapter 2308: Divine Lord Stage (3)

The people from the Leiting family nearly went crazy. They felt a desperate urge to rush up and drag that insane Lei Yan off the platform!

Did their young master know his place at all?

Could he please come down now and not cause such an embarrassment to the Leiting family?

As Hang Wenwei was not present, the teachers sent someone to get him. He was confused as he thought that no one would ever challenge someone from the top 10. But in the end, there was really someone who was that audacious.

Hang Wenwei was curious to see who was so gutsy. When he ascended the platform, he saw…

“Lei Yan?” Hang Wenwei was bewildered.

Unbelievable. That useless Lei Yan wanted to challenge him?

“Don’t waste time talking. Make your move!” Lei Yan had a gut full of rage suppressed inside him. He wanted to use his powers to prove to everyone that their Boss was better than any one of the other teachers!

And he was the best example!

Before Hang Wenwei could figure out what was happening, Lei Yan unleashed his aura and that Divine Lord level energy engulfed the entire arena.

The crowd, “…”

What the hell!

Unbelievable!

Lei Yan was at the Divine Lord stage?!!

The Leiting family teenagers were completely dumbstruck. Seeing Lei Yan covered in his Divine Lord level aura was like seeing a strange monster.

Was this the Lei Yan whom they knew?

Could someone else be impersonating him?

Hang Wenwei, “…”

Who could tell him if this person before was for real or a fake?

Was the Leiting family going to such extremes to protect Lei Yan that they sent someone to impersonate him?

Lei Yan wanted to show everyone the results of Ye Qing’s teaching and he immediately struck out at Hang Wenwei.

Ranked number 10, Hang Wenwei had just managed to brush against the Divine Lord level. He was not officially at that stage yet.

Faced with an aggressive guy like Lei Yan, who was also a proper Divine Lord stage practitioner, Hang Wenwei was utterly defeated within three moves…

“I concede!” Hang Wenwei was staring at Lei Yan with red-rimmed eyes. How was this a competition? It was a death match! Those who were not in the know might have thought there was some deep-seated grudge between them!

Hang Wenwei’s surrender meant that Lei Yan had won.

Lei Yan stood on the battle platform, glaring fiercely at the crowd.

“Boss Ye Qing personally groomed me to where I am now. Any one of you who feels indignant about that, please come up here. I will beat you until you no longer feel any indignance!”

The crowd, “…” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

How terrifying…

When did he become a Divine Lord level?!

Even if he had consumed some miracle elixir, he could not have possibly progressed so fast!

First there was Mu Ziying, and now Lei Yan as well.

They were both Divine Lord stage practitioners. Just what was going on?

Everyone immediately turned to look at Ye Qing who was standing beneath the platform. At this moment, they were looking at him with completely flabbergasted expressions.

What was this teacher’s background?

To be able to produce two Divine Lord stage practitioners in just a few months?

And with students who had notoriously terrible foundations…

Was this teacher some kind of god?

On the high stage, Di Nuo’s face was grim to the extreme. He never dreamed that Mu Ziying and Lei Yan had ascended to the Divine Lord stage. This was one big joke.

One teacher who was able to produce two Divine Lord level students?

This was simply not what ordinary people dared to even dream of!

Even the arrogant Di Nuo had only managed to produce one Divine Lord level student so far.

And that student was naturally gifted. He was already at a very high cultivation level when he first entered the school. It was completely unlike Mu Ziying and Lei Yan, who had been nearly kicked out of the academy for being too lousy.
