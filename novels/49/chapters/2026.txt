Chapter 2027: Battle (1)

At the Ancient You Clan.

“What did you say?” an Elder exclaimed as he looked darkly at his underling.

“Elder, the Temple of Shadows Army has already started attacking from the East,” the soldier reported.

It seemed that the demon dragon from the Temple of Shadows had started encircling the Ancient You Clan’s territory not long ago. Behind him marched a huge troop of soldiers who swept past the border.

“Are they mad?” The Elder in charge of the Ancient You Clan’s forces raised his eyebrows.

Even though there had always been friction between the two of them, neither of them had ever had the intention of making a move. So why was the Temple of Shadows suddenly attacking them?

“Elder, what should we do?”

“What should we do?” The Elder laughed coldly and continued, “Since the Temple of Shadows has come seeking its death, there is no need for us to show any mercy. Bring my orders to the youths who are out right now. I’ll make sure the Temple of Shadows meets its doom here today!”

“But Elder, about the Crimson League...” Some people were still hesitant.

Elder Mo’s underlings had stolen something belonging to the Crimson League a while back and now the Temple of Shadows was attacking them.

“Elder Mo hasn’t given us any news about his situation, so there shouldn’t be a problem there. The Crimson League is from the Second Domain anyway and it’s a separate matter if we have some misunderstanding with them. We should deal with the Temple of Shadows first,” the Elder said dismissively.

The Elder quickly ordered for his troops to prepare for a battle with the Temple of Shadows.

Within the Ancient You Clan’s territory, Ye Qingtang was seated on Ming Di with her troops following behind her. She quickly spotted a white-haired Elder leading a huge group of people as they walked out from the Ancient You Clan’s abode. Within the group were many fresh-faced youths.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, how have you been?” the Elder raised his eyes to look at Ye Qingtang above him and asked with a cold smile.

His eyes then swept across the army behind them.

“Oh? The Baili family? The Mu family....ha... I’ve known them for a long time now... What? Did the Holy Lord come forward today with all these lost dogs to submit to us?”

The faces of the Ancient Clans sank as they heard his insult.

“You Cong! Nothing good ever comes out of that cursed mouth of yours. The Ancient You Clan has harmed many of our Ancient Clan people and we’re here to return the favor today!”

“Return the favor?” Elder Cong sneered as he heard the words. “You think you’ll be able to do that? Now that you’re here, don’t even think of leaving this place alive.” A dark look flashed past his face. After all, they had sought refuge in the Temple of Shadows along with the Spirit of Chaos fragments they had.

He could easily wipe them out today and gather all the remaining fragments. Once it was done, he would be killing two birds with one stone!

“What big words,” Ye Qingtang said lightly as she flew in the air. “I want to see whether the Ancient You Clan has the ability to wipe us out.”

Elder Cong laughed coldly and said, “Ability?”

He suddenly raised his hands and the ten youths who had been cultivated by the Spiritual Abode suddenly rushed forward. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

In an instant, waves of their forces began their attack.

“Just these youths alone are enough to wipe you out.”
