Chapter 2290: Consecutive Breakthroughs (3)

It was the middle of the night and people in the city should have been sleeping. But when Ye Qingtang flew back to the city, she realized that quite a number of people were gathered at the city gates.

Luckily it was dark enough and Ye Qingtang was high up in the air. As a result, no one noticed her.

Ye Qingtang returned to her room, all prepared to have a good rest and acclimatize to her new cultivation stage.

But at this moment, there was a knock on her door.

“Boss! Boss!”

Lei Yan’s voice rang out.

Ye Qingtang opened her door and saw Lei Yan and the rest standing in a row outside her room.

“Boss, you saw it too, right?! Right?!” Lei Yan stared at Ye Qingtang excitedly.

Ye Qingtang was puzzled.

“Saw what?”

Lei Yan and the rest were stunned. “Some powerful practitioner underwent a breakthrough! Boss, you didn’t see it? You must have been sleeping too soundly. Someone underwent a breakthrough somewhere outside the city just now. And that fellow is a complete freak! We already felt that we had risen very fast when we cultivated in the secret room earlier. But this fellow is even more formidable. Guess how many times he broke through?”

Ye Qingtang: “…”

“Five times! Five whole times! And at the Divine Lord stage!” Lei Yan spoke excitedly.

Ye Qingtang looked placidly at Lei Yan.

Five times?

No, it was nine times…

However, those breakthroughs before the Divine Lord stage were quieter and did not wake up anyone.

“It’s just a breakthrough. Go back and sleep.” Ye Qingtang spoke impassively. As those brats looked on in bewilderment, she closed her bedroom door.

Shut outside, Lei Yan and the rest were dumbfounded.

Their boss’ reaction was just like that?!

But how else could Ye Qingtang react?

She had been worried about creating a scene after unleashing her stored energy and improving her cultivation stage. It was nothing shocking to have a breakthrough, but consecutive breakthroughs within a short period of time was mind-blowing!

The cultivation method of suppressing one’s cultivation level had not yet been invented.

Ye Qingtang did not wish to be seen as a freak by others.

But… 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She had not expected to transcend so many levels at one go either.

As much as she had wanted to maintain a low profile, now… She had astonished an entire city of practitioners.

Ye Qingtang’s only piece of luck was that no one knew she was the one who had undergone all those breakthroughs.

…

The next morning, Ye Qingtang emerged from her room and saw Lei Yan and the rest already downstairs and gathered with a group of other diners.

It was still early morning but the dining hall was already filled with people. And all of them were energetic martial art practitioners.

At this moment, they were all gathered in what looked like a passionate discussion.

“Did you all see what happened last night?”

“Of course we did, who didn’t?”

“Calm down. Do you think it was really just one person who made so many breakthroughs yesterday? Could it be a bunch of practitioners gathered together and who just happened to break through at the same time?”

“How in the world can there be so many coincidences? Not only were the timings so close to each other, but each breakthrough was also higher than the previous one. How can there be so many coincidences in life?”

“I think someone must have gotten some secret artifact. Otherwise, how can a normal person have so many breakthroughs over such a short period of time?”

“Did you guys hear the news?”

“What news?”

“I heard that not long ago, the Temple of Paragon issued a notice that they wanted to get the fiendcelestial’s eye from the tomb. The various factions have been surging into the fiendcelestial’s tomb over this period. Do you think the person from last night got some precious artifact from the tomb, and so managed to attain such miraculous breakthroughs?”
