Chapter 2159: My Student (3)

Nangong Lie and Lei Yan stood among the crowd and witnessed it all. They couldn’t help but frown.

If Ye Qing were to just stay out of it, Di Nuo would definitely punish Jing Ze heavily. This incident would probably give Di Nuo reason to expel Jing Ze from the Netherworld Academy.

Right when everyone thought that Ye Qing was going to stay out of it, she suddenly spoke.

“However, Jing Ze is my student. Naturally, I must be involved.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang’s words surprised everyone.

She was going to go against Di Nuo?!

Jing Ze’s eyes widened, surprise written all over his face. Ye Qing stood in front of him and though he had a slender figure, it was akin to a tall wall that protected him.

“Ye Qing, don’t push your luck,” Di Nuo berated.

Ye Qingtang didn’t want to waste time talking to him and she instantly turned around, preparing to take Jing Ze and Mu Ziying with her.

Di Nuo instantly charged over when he saw her leave. Right when he was about to strike, Jing Ze felt something warm coming out from his chest.

The red light that in his fist started spreading all over his body. In an instant, he collapsed on the ground and started convulsing.

Ye Qingtang was shocked. She froze for a moment before she quickly helped Jing Ze up. But Jing Ze had already lost consciousness and did not respond to her at all.

“Leave Jing Ze behind,” Di Nuo ordered.

Ye Qingtang only ignored his words. “The academy handed them to me and I am their teacher. It is my responsibility to take care of them. If you’re not happy with it, you can report me to the Vice President.”

After making herself clear, she took Jing Ze and Mu Ziying with her and prepared to leave.

Di Nuo didn’t expect Ye Qing to pull the Vice President into the picture. After all, the Vice President was the one who handed these students to Ye Qing and they were personally chosen by Di Nuo.

When Meng Yao saw that Ye Qing prepared to leave and Di Nuo’s dark expression, she instantly realized that they were on bad terms. She suddenly said, “Teacher Ye, hold on. Didn’t you mention that it’s only practicing? Why are you leaving now? We only had one round earlier and Zhang Qiqiu lost. I haven’t had the chance to challenge Mu Ziying yet.”

Though Mu Ziying couldn’t figure out why Zhang Qiqiu lost to Jing Ze, with Di Nuo present, she naturally wouldn’t let go of the chance to cause trouble for Mu Ziying.

Also, she would be embarrassing Ye Qing if she defeated Mu Ziying in Ye Qing’s presence. That way she would be killing two birds with one stone, how could she ever let go of such a good opportunity?

Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks. On the other hand, Mu Ziying appeared emotionless while standing beside Ye Qingtang. She just looked at the overbearing Meng Yao coldly.

Before Ye Qingtang could even say anything, Di Nuo spoke. “Meng Yao, stop your nonsense.”

“Teacher Di...” Meng Yao was stunned.

“How is she even fit to challenge you?” Di Nuo said coldly.

Meng Yao froze for a moment before she smiled.

This lousy Ye Qing had pulled the Vice President into the picture and Di Nuo couldn’t possibly keep Jing Ze with him. There was no way he was going to let it slide.

“A useless person like Mu Ziying will eventually have to leave the Netherworld Academy. You have to train harder and if you achieve higher levels in the future, then you can get a recommendation from me to join the Inter-Academy Competition.”

The overbearing tone Di Nuo spoke in only highlighted the superiority he felt with regards to the matter.
