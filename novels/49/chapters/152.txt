“No problem. I am already very happy that Senior Brother Gu is willing to believe in me,” Ye Qingtang said generously.

Rather than debating about how skilled she was with others, why not prove to them with her skills in the mission?

Gu Yanqiu was a tactful and rather fair person, and this was good.

Only Qin Huan’s reaction previously surprised Ye Qingtang slightly and made her like the frivolous senior brother even more.

After confirming the members, Gu Yanqiu shared the information he researched on with his teammates.

The Giant Lizard was a level 6 demonic beast with thick, rough skin and had an extremely strong defense. Poison was present in its saliva and hidden between its scales, and one would have to be exceptionally cautious if they wanted to kill it

“I recommend everyone to prepare some antidotes individually in case you need it when the time arises,” Gu Yanqiu reminded.

Everyone was experienced and naturally knew about these.

Qin Huan took a look at Ye Qingtang from aside and whispered softly, “Junior Sister Ye, I’ll prepare your share of antidotes for you.” Then, he still gave her a surreptitious wink which enhanced his already handsome appearance.

Ye Qingtang did not know whether to laugh or cry, but she still remembered Qin Huan’s kindness.

In the sect, elixirs could only be exchanged with Xuanming points. Although antidotes required very few Xuanming points, Ye Qingtang did not have a single point since she was a new disciple, and it was good that Qin Huan noticed this.

After a while more, everyone dispersed.

During the meeting, Meng Sheng did not say anything further, but he looked at Ye Qingtang disapprovingly before leaving.

“Junior Sister Ye, Meng Sheng is just like that. Don’t take it to heart,” Qin Huan comforted.

Ye Qingtang chuckled, “It’s fine.”

Upon seeing that Ye Qingtang did not have any special reaction, Qin Huan finally put his heart at ease and bade Ye Qingtang goodbye along with Gu Yanqiu to start his own preparations.

Ye Qingtang returned to her room alone and analyzed the information on the Giant Lizard. Afterward, she took out the scales of the fire beast that she previously brought from the Treasure Pavilion from her space ring.

She had always stored this item in her space ring and only took out to use some of it on Second Young Master Si when he was poisoned. She still had a large portion of it on her hands, and she had not found a suitable time to use it until now where there was finally a use for it.

The nature of the Giant Lizard’s poison was fire, and the scales of the Fire Beast had an extremely high resistance against poison with a fire nature. Even if it was the flame toxin, the Fire Beast’s scale had a way better resistance against it than any other things.

After pondering for a moment, she started working on it.

There was some tannic acid in her space ring. This was a corrosive substance that was usually used to soak rusty ironware to wash the rust away.

Ye Qingtang got a large wooden bucket and smeared a layer of waterproof white glue in the bucket. Once the white glue dried, she poured the tannic acid into the bucket and soaked the scales of the Fire Beast in it. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The scales of the Fire Beast were extremely hard, making it very difficult to be destroyed and forged. However, this was merely due to the lack of knowledge in the current era.

In the future, some intellects discovered that the scales could be softened using tannic acid, allowing it to be forged easily. In the present, no one apart from her knew how to process the scales of the Fire Beast; thus, Ye Qingtang bought many of it at the Treasure Pavilion.

Watching the scales of the Fire Beast soak in tannic acid, Ye Qingtang thought of something, and she immediately started preparing after estimating the materials she had on hand.
