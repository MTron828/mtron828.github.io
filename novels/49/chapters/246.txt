Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang brought Lin Long back to Xuanling Sect hurriedly. Luckily, Ye Qingtang had many elixirs on hand, which helped Lin Long pull through all the way until they reached the sect. Only after Ye Qingtang brought Lin Long to receive treatment did Ye Qingtang finally sigh in relief.

She was about to report this mission to the outer sect warden but suddenly saw someone standing under a tree not far away suspiciously and peeping at her. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang raised a brow. Looking at the familiar figure, Ye Qingtang folded her arms and said,

“Senior Brother Qin.”

A chill ran down Qin Huan’s spine as he shifted out from the spot while holding onto a string that was pulling onto something behind the tree.

“Junior… Junior Sister Ye, you’re back so early?” Qin Huan laughed stiffly.

He just received news that Ye Qingtang returned to the sect and thus came over cautiously. Yet… before he was able to mentally prepare himself, Ye Qingtang saw him.

Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows and narrowed her eyes at Qin Huan’s extremely unnatural expression which gave her a bad feeling.

“Senior Brother Qin, where’s my wolf?” Ye Qingtang asked.

In just a moment, Qin Huan’s hair stood on end, and he forcefully squeezed out a smile that was uglier than a cry on his attractive face.

“Oh that silver wolf… it’s still here. I fed it very well… Don’t worry…” Qin Huan said guiltily.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything, but her eyes sharpened.

Under Ye Qingtang’s stare, Qin Huan swallowed a mouthful of saliva and tugged on the string in his hand in extreme reluctance, pulling the certain creature that was hidden behind the tree out.

That was a big and muscular wolf…

However, Ye Qingtang had a face of shock when she saw that wolf.

The wolf that Qin Huan was leading was an adult wolf without doubt, but the wolf’s fur was ash-white and not silver.

“Where’s my wolf!” Ye Qingtang glared at Qin Huan furiously.

Qin Huan was really on the verge of crying but could only muster his courage and reply. “Your wolf? Isn’t this your wolf?”

“My wolf is silver colored,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

The corner of Qin Huan’s lips twitched as he feigned a firm front. “Yeah, it’s silver colored”

“Do you think I’m blind?” Ye Qingtang pointed to the fierce gray wolf that Qin Huan was pulling.

Qin Huan hurriedly waved his hands. “No no no… Listen to me, this is indeed your wolf. I just thought that its fur was not pretty previously and too loud so I gave it a dye. Look, isn’t this color way more lowkey?”

“…” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and drew out her sword in a swift motion.

The sword glimmered, and Qin Huan immediately ducked.

“Junior Sister Ye… Listen to me… It really is your wolf. Touch it if you don’t believe me…” Then, Qin Huan even pulled the gray wolf to stand in front of Ye Qingtang.

The gray wolf flashed its teeth at Ye Qingtang.

“…” Qin Huan could only look at Ye Qingtang.

Qin Huan held back his tears and claimed. “This… this may be because you left for too long, and it doesn’t remember you anymore. It will remember you if you continue to raise it for a few more days…”

Before Qin Huan finished his sentence, Ye Qingtang already charged towards him with a sword in her hands.

A chill went down his spine. Hurriedly pulling the gray wolf, he ran away madly.

“Junior Sister Ye! Calm down! Calm down a little! Ah ah ah! Don’t slash my face!”

In the outer sect of Xuanling Sect, Qin Huan was sprinting like a madman while dragging along a gray wolf that was almost dying from the tight string and behind him was an armed Ye Qingtang who was chasing right after…
