Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Old bastard! What did you say?!” Senior Sister Yue’s eyes suddenly became fierce and malicious.

“Nothing. Do me a favor, okay? Don’t find troubles for Xuanling Sect disciples. Just leave.” The elder waved his hand.

“A favor? Look at how old you are now. Besides an old body, what else do you have?” Senior Brother Zhuo laughed.

“Don’t bother talking to him anymore. Kill him together!”

Senior Sister Yue flew over, and her Martial Qi Level Three aura was getting more intense.

Ye Qingtang immediately got up and stood in front of Venerable Wu to protect him.

The Martial breath on Venerable Wu was very weak. He was just one of the members at the Sword Spirit Workshop. How could he defend the attack from a Yunxiao Sect disciple?

“Young people, how dare you to bully an old man! I’m already half-step into the grave now.” Venerable Wu made a detour to cross Ye Qingtang and walked towards Senior Sister Yue.

“Old bastard, this will be your death!” Senior Sister Yue shouted angrily. Her palm slapped downwards and a huge cyan palm shadow came from the void, smashing downwards.

The huge cyan palm contained unimaginable power, and it seemed that it could suppress the earth. The ground under the Venerable Wu’s feet was crushed into pieces by the power.

However…

The Venerable Wu stood calmly and lifted his right arm slightly. The pressing Martial breath seemed to evolve into an ancient demonic beast.

Boom!

After a loud explosion. The huge cyan palm was crushed and disappeared. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“WHAT?!”

Senior Sister Yue looked at the Venerable Wu in shock.

“Young people, you are too impulsive. Do you not know how to respect old people? Such a disappointment.” The Venerable Wu shook his head. He lifted his arm again, and a strong attractive force pulled Senior Sister Yue forward.

The Venerable Wu clutched her neck and sighed. “Such a pretty face… Why are you willing to be a thief?”

“Old bastard, how dare you humiliate my Junior Sister?!” Senior Brother Zhuo shouted and took out a yellow-grade sword, piercing towards the Venerable Wu.

The force was immense. It was like a wild beast that could destroy everything.

“Two young people bullying an old man together… Do you not know what humiliation is?” The Venerable Wu extended his fingers.

Clank!

The yellow-grade sword was held by Venerable Wu’s two fingers.

“How is this possible!” Senior Brother was totally shocked. No matter how much strength he used, he could not withdraw his weapon.

The Venerable Wu did not leave any reaction time for Senior Brother Zhuo. His finger pointed at his chest area.

Boom!

Senior Brother Zhuo’s body was like a piece of paper in the gust of wind, flying outward.

“You…” Senior Brother Zhuo felt his inner breath, and blood was flowing everywhere inside his body. His face was red, and blood ran over from his mouth.

“Enchantment eyes!”

Senior Sister Yue murmured softly, and her eyes suddenly turned into cyan in color. It seemed that one’s soul could be enchanted by the eyes, and his mind could be controlled.

“Enchantment skill?” The Venerable Wu sneered. “Young girl, I’m old enough to be your grandfather. How dare you use the enchantment skill on me?”

The Venerable Wu then threw Senior Sister Yue outward.

“Senior Brother Zhuo, the old bastard’s mind power was too strong. My enchantment skill… could not work on him,” Senior Sister Yue said and looked at Senior Brother Zhuo.

“Senior Sister Yue, Senior Brother Zhuo, the old man is not an ordinary person. We should escape from this place first. If the Xuanling Sect elders reached the place, it will be harder for us to leave.” Ning Luo tried to persuade the two of them.

Senior Brother Zhuo contemplated for a while and eventually nodded. “Ning Luo is right. We should leave now.”
