Chapter 1228 Holy Son 2

Ye Qingtang looked in astonishment at the blood-stained child.

She suddenly recalled a rumor about the Temple of Shadows that she had heard in her previous life.

Legend had it that at the peak of its power, the Temple of Shadows was not only held by the Holy Lord, but she also had at her command a mutant Undead. His power was only slightly inferior to that of the Holy Lord. He was the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows.

If she guessed correctly, this blood-stained child was the legendary mutant Undead, the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows.

“Ah Yao? How could you be so cruel to abandon me and vanish for so many years?” The child saw that Ye Qingtang still did not reply. His exquisite face was aggrieved as if he was about to burst into tears at any moment.

When Ye Qingtang saw the child before her, she truly felt like weeping but had no tears.

Legend had it that the Holy Son was capricious and was extremely bloodthirsty. Because he was a mutant, he never grew up and remained like a child. However, his reputation for cruelty and viciousness far exceeded that of any Undead.

Ye Qingtang did not dare to allow this bloodthirsty little fellow to discover that she was an impostor. She had no choice but to pretend to be troubled and keep her mouth shut.

When the child saw that Ye Qingtang was not going to respond, his childish face suddenly changed. A warped murderous intent suddenly spread across his face. He suddenly turned, looked at the numerous Undead in the hall, and spoke.

“Ah Yao must be displeased because of the despicable worm who besmirched her Nine Souls Ring. Where is the human?”

The numerous Undead trembled under the child’s cold look. They hurriedly dragged the man with the goatee, whom they had captured earlier, into the main hall.

When he saw that the criminal had been caught, the child turned to look at Ye Qingtang. But the moment he turned, the chilling murderous intent on his face instantly turned into an expression of grievance and unease.

“Ah Yao, don’t be angry. It’s all my fault for not guarding your things carefully. Don’t worry, I’ll kill this worm who besmirched your Nine Souls Ring.”

Before Ye Qingtang could open her mouth, the child suddenly transformed into a black demonic wind that pounced on the man with the goatee.

The man with the goatee turned dead-white when he saw the child bare his sharp teeth. He said in fright, “Holy Son, have mercy. I have never thought of besmirching the Holy Lord’s Dharma treasure. I just admired the Holy Lord too much…”

“Is a lowly worm such as you fit to admire Ah Yao?” The child suddenly reached out with his bloodstained little hand. The hand instantly transformed into a bare bone and gripped the skull of the man.

“You have besmirched Ah Yao’s things. I won’t let you die so easily. I will carve your name on the Stone of Nightmares so that you can never be reincarnated.”

A red light suddenly flickered in the child’s eyes as he looked straight at the man with the goatee.

For a moment, it was as if the man with the goatee was transfixed. He sat motionlessly on the ground, his eyes distant and fearless.

“Tell me your name.” The child ordered coldly.

“Mu… Mu Shi…” The man with the goatee said dully.

However, the moment the man with the goatee spoke, a strange look flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

He is Mu Shi? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

During her time in Central Mainland in her previous life, Ye Qingtang had heard of Mu Shi. Mu Shi was from the Eternal Dynasty and was one of the teachers in the Eternal Academy. He was unaccomplished, and no one noticed him, but…
