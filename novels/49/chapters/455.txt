Ye Qingtang stared at Yi Tianchou, whose head was separated from the body. Her eyes did not show any trace of pity as countless women would suffer with this kind of person living in the world.

Soon, Ye Qingtang walked forward and raided everything on Yi Tianchou. She was not interested to take his head as she was not heading back to the sect. It was not very convenient to carry a human head with her.

Yi Tianchou had an old Kung Fu technique book and a bag of spirit stones with him. There was also a gold token.

“This… this is the token of the Assassination Alliance?” Ye Qingtang was in deep thought as she stared at the token.

The Assassination Alliance consisted of the most vicious people whose names were on the Assassination Roll. The dark gold token showed the identity and the position of the person in the Assassination Alliance.

Ye Qingtang did not think much and kept the token away.

She then threw the book at the side.

Ye Qingtang had stepped into the Paragon realm in her previous life, and the martial skills that she cultivated were the Paragon skills. How would she be interested in the skills that a person with Martial Qi Level Three possessed?

Ye Qingtang was most interested in the bag of spirit stones.

“Medium-grade spirit stones…”

Ye Qingtang opened the bag, and there were twelve spirit stones inside.

The spirit stones were classified into superior, medium, and lower grades.

Lower-grade spirit stones were sold in normal auctions and the Treasure Pavilion. They were very ordinary, and Ye Qingtang always fed them as snacks to her lightning dragon.

The medium-grade spirit stones were different.

A medium-grade spirit stone was worth more than a thousand of lower-grade ones. It contained sufficient spirit energy for cultivators to absorb and upgrade their ability, and it could also be used as a currency.

On the road of Martial art cultivation, the stronger and more powerful you were, the more useless the gold and silver currency were.

Gold and silver were completely useless if one reached the Yin Yang True Lord level.

The items in the top Treasure Pavilions and auctions were mostly divine weapons and paragon treasures, and gold and silver could never be used to purchase them. The currency in exchange would be medium-grade spirit stones.

Gold and silver were the currency for the weak. The medium-grade and superior-grade spirit stones were the currency for the strong.

The land that was more advanced did not even have gold or silver. The currency used was all superior-grade spirit stones or even stones with higher quality.

The medium-grade spirit stones could be the main currency for the strong as they contained a large amount of spirit energy and could improve one’s cultivation. Gold and silver were useless for strong cultivators.

Yi Tianchou was at the Martial Qi Level Three. It was not strange for him to have the medium-grade spirit stones. At this level, gold and silver slowly faded out of the currency and were replaced by medium-grade spirit stones.

The spirit energy that a medium-grade spirit stone contained could be compared to a thousand of lower-grade spirit stones. Twelve of them were equal to twelve thousand lower-grade spirit stones!

Ye Qingtang was slightly delighted.

Twelve medium-grade spirit stones was not a small number as the Elder of the Xuanling Sect only received a few medium-grade spirit stones every month.

“Twelve medium-grade spirit stones… If the spirit energy can be absorbed by the Heart of the Demon God, maybe I can break through to the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two…” Ye Qingtang murmured to herself.

For normal people, they might need at least a few hundred medium-grade spirit stones. However, Ye Qingtang was different as she possessed the Heart of the Demon God. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Qingtang reaching the Paragon level after three hundred years since she left the sect in her previous life was all due to the Heart of the Demon God.
