Chapter 1192: Battle (3)

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was standing on the top of the city wall, looking over the hell-like battlefield. At that moment, her feelings were mixed, and she did not feel any pleasure or joy at having conquered a formidable enemy.

The blood on the long sword that she held in her hand had congealed into beads and slowly dripped down.

The little white tiger squatted near Ye Qingtang. Its body of snow-white fur was stained red.

“Ah…”

After a long time, the little white tiger sighed softly. “I’ve seen all kinds of species at war… Only the wars between humans… involve many innocent people.”

“On a battlefield, no one is innocent.” Ye Qingtang paused for a moment before speaking softly. Then, she turned and left. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

That night, they conquered Heaven City and completely destroyed the troop from the Ancient You Clan, without leaving a single soul. In this battle, both sides had given no quarter. In the end, the overall commander and his general had ended it by killing themselves.

Blood stained the entire Heaven City red. There was no terror or eeriness, just a slight sense of dreariness.

This battle was later recorded in the annals of this mainland.

…

After conquering Heaven City, the headquarters of the southern battlefield finally fulfilled its wishes when the supply teams banded together and brought rations into the city.

For a few days, besides cleaning up the battlefield, Ye Qingtang’s also swiftly gained greater insight into the martial realms. By the end of the third day, she had progressed from the mid-stage of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eight Heaven to its peak.

But no matter how hard Ye Qingtang tried, she was still unable to reach the threshold of Yang Lord Ninth Heaven.

Ye Qingtang had no idea where to find the doorway in her Dantian that led to Yang Lord Ninth Heaven.

After half a month, bad news came from the headquarters of the southern battlefield. The Ancient You Clan’s army had breached the two major cities of Peerless School and Phantom Valley. The Peerless School Sect Master and the Phantom Valley Master had both died in battle.

Further, the remaining Yang Lords and superior troops in Peerless School and Phantom Valley had hurried to Heaven City at the first opportunity and joined in the major defense line in Heaven City.

After the two major cities held by the Peerless School and Phantom Valley were breached, the enormous disadvantage that the southern battlefield was in became apparent. Within half a month, the tribes garrisoned by the ancient clan and the major defensive cities were all conquered by the Ancient You Clan’s main troops stationed in the southern battlefield. The entire Nine Nights Dynasty was completely occupied by the Ancient You Clan.

Ye Qingtang felt that the situation was becoming increasingly perilous. She had planned to join all their military strength with that of the Master of the ancient clan. However, she received bad news at the last minute.

The southern headquarters had been breached by the You troops, and the headquarters had been shattered. Almost all the powerful cultivators from the ancient clan were killed in battle. The Master of the Ancient Clan had also been killed after he had severely injured another top general named You Tong. Only one powerful cultivator from the ancient clan had escaped. He had arrived in Heaven City with severe injuries. He was at death’s door by the time the patrols on the city wall discovered him.

Valley Master Xuanchen immediately ordered the city doors to be opened, and the powerful cultivator from the ancient clan brought into the main hall.

At that moment, in the main hall of Heaven City, Ye Qingtang was looking at Daoist Zijin with a frown. “How are his injuries?” she asked.

Daoist Zijin was silent for a long time. He finally shook his head and said, “He can’t be saved.”

Daoist Zijin was a skilled healer, and his prognosis was accurate.

After approximately an hour, the dying powerful cultivator from the ancient clan lived for a short time. His pale lips moved slightly. “Who… who is… General… Ye…”

With that, Ye Qingtang advanced and carefully supported the powerful cultivator from the ancient clan. “I am Ye Qingtang…”
