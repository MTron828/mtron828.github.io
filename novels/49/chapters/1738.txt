Chapter 1739: Looking For Food (1)

The troll was dead but that evil stench still permeated the air. In fact, the stench became even more intense after the troll was burned by the black fire.

Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to linger around. Although she had killed the troll, there were still many other monsters in this mystic realm. That jade-like creature they saw earlier was several times stronger than this troll.

Now that little Heavenly Demon’s bewitching melody was losing its effectiveness, they would be in danger again if they encountered other monsters.

Bringing along this little Heavenly Demon was like having a protection amulet.

However, this little fellow was way too greedy. Perhaps it had expended a lot of energy when using the bewitching melody, but the little Heavenly Demon’s desire for food was even more intense now.

Even though Ye Qingtang had stored a lot of food in her space ring, her supply would soon run out given the little Heavenly Demon’s endless gobbling.

But Ye Qingtang couldn’t bear it whenever she saw little Heavenly Demon’s piteous face. She would rather go hungry and feed the young fellow instead.

It was lucky that Little White Tiger did not need to eat. But it felt rather exasperated at little Heavenly Demon’s greediness.

How in the world did the Heavenly Demons produce such a glutton?

As her food supply started to run out, Ye Qingtang stopped eating for several days. She would eat some snow whenever she felt hungry, while the rest of the food was all given to little Heavenly Demon.

“I say... do you really need to give everything to it? You haven’t fully recovered yet.” Little White Tiger shook out its fur and grumbled as it watched little Heavenly Demon swallow Ye Qingtang’s last pack of field rations. Thereafter, little Heavenly Demon continued to look unsatisfied and hustled over to Ye Qingtang, wagging its tail.

Ye Qingtang chuckled in exasperation. She had no choice. Her heart melted everytime she looked at little Heavenly Demon’s pitiful, begging face. She couldn’t resist leaving all the food for it.

But to be honest, Ye Qingtang was truly starving. Her body was still recovering but she had only consumed snow the past few days.

Given her abilities, she could have gone a month without eating for drinking outside this realm. But the amount of energy she had to expend in the mystic realm was tremendous. She would suffer from hunger pangs after just two to three days without food.

Luckily they had little Heavenly Demon for protection during this journey, it meant that they encountered much fewer monsters. Otherwise, they would have had a much harder time surviving.

Little Heavenly Demon continued to gaze at Ye Qingtang with sparkling, teary eyes. That last pack of field rations was just a small snack for it. It was still extremely hungry.

“I really have no more food.” Ye Qingtang sighed softly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Little Heavenly Demon tilted its head in confusion. Having waited for a long while without getting any food, it hugged its own tail in a forlorn manner and gazed pathetically at Ye Qingtang. The word “hunger” was written all over its tiny face.

“...” Ye Qingtang’s head started to ache.

This little fellow’s appetite was just too big. The food inside her space ring could have lasted her at least a year. But it had now been completely devoured by little Heavenly Demon in just a few days. What should she do?

Without food, little Heavenly Demon was instantly despondent and listless. It sprawled lethargically in Ye Qingtang’s arms all day, its wide eyes quietly surveying the surroundings. The moment it spied some icicles on those ice trees, it gave an involuntary gulp before dashing over to chew on it, causing its little milk teeth to ache from the cold.

“Ah... ohhh...” Holding its frozen cheeks, little Heavenly Demon gazed miserably at Ye Qingtang.
