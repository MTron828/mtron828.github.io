Chapter 1719: The Cursed Mystic Realm (2)

“Little girl, you must be new to this place?” the skull suddenly asked.

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

This skull was still “alive”?!

“Just as well, carry me out, I want to enjoy some sunlight,” the skull commanded.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. There was no sun outside...

But thinking of Qin Zhuo’s earlier words, she went forward and put Little White Tiger down before picking up the skull. Then she walked out of the cave.

The atmosphere outside became somewhat strange when the other skeletons saw Ye Qingtang carrying that skull outside. On the other hand, the skull was very satisfied having been brought out of the cave.

“Little girl, have you come to ask me how to leave this mystic realm?” the skull asked.

“Yes.”

The skull chuckled. “It must be that rascal Qin Zhuo who told you to come. Never mind. Since you were nice enough to bring me out here, I will tell you. But... I must warn you that all those who tried to leave this place came to a miserable end. To this day, no one has been able to leave. It might be better if you just give in and settle down heーargh...!”

The skull suddenly cried out in pain.

The others didn’t seem surprised at his cry.

“What’s the matter?” Ye Qingtang saw that the skull seemed to be quivering in pain.

The skull trembled for some time before finally taking a deep breath.

“Nothing serious. It’s just that my limbs are being eaten by some monster.”

Ye Qingtang, “...”

What the hell?!

“I say, little girl. Stop thinking about leaving this place. Just look at him. It’s because he kept trying to leave that the bones of the rest of his body were dismembered by monsters. All he has left is that skull. Although the rest of his body is separated from him, he can still feel the pain of being bitten, chewed on, trampled upon and torn apart... there are so many monsters in this mystic realm that his body has already been split into several hundred pieces. Several hundred kinds of pain merged together and tormenting you every single second of eternity... can you endure that?” The giant skeleton snorted as he looked at Ye Qingtang with a questioning tilt of its head.

Ye Qingtang’s face instantly turned grim.

“He’s right. This is the kind of risk you must bear if you wish to leave this place. Now, all I have left is this skull. Are you willing to take on such a risk?” the skull asked with a smile.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath.

“Can you please tell me how to leave this place?”

The skull laughed out loud. “Young people are truly fearless. Since you wish to know, I will tell you...”

“This mystic realm has three parts. The first is the Frozen Ice Fields where we are at now. The other is the Scorched Hot Lands. The final one is the Cemetery of the True Gods. You have to pass through the Frozen Ice Fields and the Scorched Hot Lands before you will find the Cemetery of the True Gods. You must destroy the skeleton of the Cursed True God. Only then will you be able to undo the curse and leave this place.”

“Have you gone to the Cemetery of the True Gods before?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Of course. How else did I end up like this? But even though I have gone before, I can’t bring you there.” The skull seemed to have read Ye Qingtang’s mind, then he continued.

“I am already completely dismembered. Even if I manage to leave, I won’t be truly human again and I don’t know what will become of me. Anyway... I never wish to step foot again inside the Cemetery of the True Gods.”
