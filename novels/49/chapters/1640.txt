Chapter 1641: Insane Luck (3)

Jiang Yisheng was also surprised by Ye Qingtang’s luck. However, he knew that the elders would not be biased toward anyone when it came to the selection of candidates for the Martial Arts Championship. He shook his head.

Ye Qingtang’s opponent for the sixth round was quite powerful, but he used up all his energy in the previous round. When he went on the stage, he was breathing heavily. His face was pale and full of sweat; it seemed like he could not even stand straight.

Ye Qingtang’s five opponents were those who were the worst in the valley. She did not require much effort to beat them, so she was still in her best state.

With such a huge difference in the physical condition, the man still insisted to fight against Ye Qingtang. However, he ran out of energy after a short while and fell onto the ground.

Ye Qingtang won again without surprise.

“What joke is this? How is it possible?”

“What kind of insane luck she has?”

“She entered the top twenty? I can be in the top twenty as well in that case.”

After six rounds, many people were eliminated, but all of them stayed to watch the battles. However, they all complained when they saw Ye Qingtang entered the top twenty just by luck.

Jiang Yisheng and Jiang Yiran also entered the top twenty. Next, it would be the ranking battle between the top twenty candidates.

Jiang Yiran glanced at Ye Qingtang. He lost to her last time, and he still remembered that. He rubbed his hands and swore that he would make her pay back if he could encounter Ye Qingtang later.

Jiang Yiran’s wish came true. When both of them drew the same lot, his smile was savage. He jumped onto the stage and stared at Ye Qingtang aggressively.

“Little girl, here we meet again.”

Ye Qingtang walked onto the stage. She could tell how much he wanted to beat her from his aggressiveness. She rolled her eyes slightly and looked towards Jiang Yisheng, who was standing below the stage. “All candidates in the top twenty can go to the Martial Arts Championship, right?”

Jiang Yisheng did not understand the intention of the question and nodded.

“Yes, all the top twenty candidates can go.”

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang withdrew her sight. She ignored Jiang Yiran, who was standing in front of her, rubbing his hands. Her sight landed on Elder Qian and the rest.

“I give up.”

“...” Jiang Yiran’s smile froze.

The whole parade square was silent. Everyone was stunned as they stared at Ye Qingtang, who gave up before the battle even started. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“What... what’s going on? She gave up before it even started? What’s wrong with her?”

“Her ability is not comparable with Jiang Yiran. Didn’t you notice the abilities of her opponents in the previous rounds? She would have been defeated if she didn’t have such luck.”

“What the hell? She doesn’t feel embarrassed? She entered the top twenty just by luck and gave up when she encountered a more powerful opponent? Is this a joke?”

All the young men were not happy earlier with Ye Qingtang entering the top twenty just by luck. And now, they all raged. All of them felt that they were more powerful than Ye Qingtang. They were just unlucky and met much more powerful opponents and lost.

But such a useless person could enter the top twenty by luck?

On what basis?!

Although the audience cursed and scolded her, Ye Qingtang walked off the stage.

Her goal was to get a chance to attend the Martial Arts Championship. She would only use her full strength there. She would not waste her energy here trying to get a better rank.

Her initial target was to enter the top twenty.

Jiang Yiran was stunned as he was prepared to beat Ye Qingtang up. He opened his eyes widely as he stared at Ye Qingtang walking away.

“Ye Qingtang, are you scared? You’re not going to fight me?” Jiang Yiran shouted in anger. He really hoped that he could at least punch her once.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang looked back and answered casually.

“...” Jiang Yiran stared blankly.

What the hell!
