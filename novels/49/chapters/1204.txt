1205 Blood Battle 7

“So there is no way to break the illusion created by the Heavenly Venerate…” An ominous feeling arose in Ye Qingtang’s heart.

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang’s face was pale, and blood seeped out of her mouth.

The illusion was connected with the real world. If her body was injured in the outside world, she would suffer from the injury in the illusion as well…

The outside world…

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were closed as she stood motionlessly in her original spot. Her left shoulder was pierced by You Tong’s sword.

The remaining figures of the Ancient You Clan all started laughing.

Even the most powerful people of the inferior mainland would not possess the same level of power as a powerful person from a superior land. There was no hope of survival once she entered You Tong’s illusion. She could only be manipulated by him…

“Hehe… You exceeded my expectation on the duration you endured in my illusion… However, you’ll still die here.” You Tong sneered.

“Eldest Young Lady?”

Some disciples of the Ye Family looked over and gritted their teeth. However, they lost all their fighting capabilities and could not even stand up straight due to their severe injuries.

“Hahaha, General… I think this lady’s appearance… is special… It’ll be a waste if she just died… How about… giving her to us…” One of the middle-aged men looked towards You Tong and showed a cunning smile.

You Tong’s eyes suddenly darkened.

Swoosh!

You Tong sliced his sword down without making any sound. The middle-aged man’s body was cut into half. Blood spurted out immediately, leaving a horrible scene.

“This…”

Everyone looked around and mumbled as their General suddenly killed a Yang Lord.

“I don’t care what you do in your daily life. However, you need to obey my rules when you’re following me. This is the battlefield. I hope that all of you give respect to our enemies. We can kill women… but…” You Tong paused and scanned through everyone coldly.

Some of the powerful figures who followed You Tong for a long period of time scoffed. You Tong would never bully or humiliate women. He resented such behaviors. The Yang Lord just now was seeking his own death.

However, some of the powerful figures who were dispatched to the Southern War scorned. The people of the inferior land could not even be addressed as human. Why couldn’t they enjoy themselves after a long fight?!

“Hehe… This is a battlefield. Everyone fought hard to be able to stand here. Even those who died in your hands deserve your respect.” You Tong sneered.

Everyone nodded their heads, and no one dared to say anything else.

You Tong was satisfied with everyone’s reaction. He turned back slowly and moved the sword in his hand slowly.

Suddenly, before he could slash his sword down, a black giant eye appeared beside him.

“Commander…”

You Tong’s pupil constricted as he saw the black eye. It was a Dharma artifact that was used to communicate with the Commander. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Three princesses and two noble heirs from the Central Mainland were kidnapped. They ordered us to give up on conquering this land.” An illusory voice came out of the black eye.

“What…”

You Tong and the rest of the Ancient You Clan figures were all shocked.

“Commander, who dares to kidnap the three princesses and the two noble heirs?!” You Tong frowned and asked.

The five of them were all children of the higher-ups of You Clan’s headquarter. The Clan Master’s beloved princess was also one of them…

“I’m not very sure, but I assume it’s the third prince of the Eternal Dynasty.” The illusory voice was heard again.
