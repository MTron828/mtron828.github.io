Chapter 2242: Fiendcelestial’s Will (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Demon child, in your opinion, how powerful is this Night Soul Beast?” An elder from the Falling Water Pavilion asked.

The demon child narrowed his eyes.

“Above me.”

Everyone froze at these words.

This Night Soul Beast was even more powerful than the demon child?

“But since this Night Soul Beast did not go into hibernation, its power would be greatly reduced. If we attack in unison, it should not be too difficult to defeat it. But...” The demon child’s eyes hardened as they landed on Ye Qingtang.

“The person standing on top of that Night Soul Beast is the key.”

.

One Night Soul Beast. Together they had the advantage of numbers and could defeat it. But the demon child was worried about this black-robed person who could command a Night Soul Beast.

A person who could control a Night Soul Beast was definitely no random ordinary passer-by. Her appearance was no accident.

“Don’t tell me she is the protector of this Evil Soul Forest?” An elder from the Falling Water Pavilion asked.

The fiendcelestial had died but the remnants of his divine consciousness remained. Those followers of the fiendcelestial might be still alive but hidden inside the Evil Soul Forest. It was just that no one had ever gone near the fiendcelestial’s tomb, and so those protectors never appeared...

“I don’t know.” The demon child shook his head.

“Are you able to sense her level?”

The demon child shook his head again. For a moment, the various factions had no idea what to do.

“May I know who you are?” The elder from Falling Water Pavilion stepped forward and asked Ye Qingtang.

“My name has already been long forgotten by mortals. Of what use is there in telling you.” Ye Qingtang affected a profound manner.

“You all wish to enter the fiendcelestial’s tomb. It’s not impossible. I have waited here for tens of thousands of years, waiting for someone who can inherit the will of the fiendcelestial.”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“What?”

Everyone was dumbstruck by Ye Qingtang’s words.

Inherit the will of the fiendcelestial?

What did she mean by that?

Ye Qingtang quietly took a deep breath as she observed their faces.

Luckily during this period in her previous life, people in the Second Domain did not know much about the Evil Soul Forest. If the Temple of Paragon hadn’t told them about the location of the fiendcelestial’s tomb, it would take another two to three hundred years before they would uncover the truth behind the Evil Soul Forest.

And this ignorance was perfect for Ye Qingtang’s duplicity.

“You came here but you did not know?” Ye Qingtang pretended to be dubious.

The crowd became even more confused by Ye Qingtang’s question.

“Mighty one, please enlighten us.” The crowd was very respectful toward this black-robed figure. They could not tell this person’s power level but knew that she was not your usual practitioner if she was able to control a Night Soul Beast.

Before they could find out more about Ye Qingtang, it was better to be respectful.

Who knew where this person came from? Since she was able to control the Night Soul Beast, she might even be able to summon those who were still in hibernation. By then, they would all die in this Evil Soul Forest.

“Never mind. It is still fate that you have all come here.” Ye Qingtang sighed before continuing in a grave voice. “The fiendcelestial may have perished, but its divine consciousness has remained in this tomb. By order of the fiendcelestial, I have waited all this time for a person who is fated to find the fiendcelestial’s tomb. All that is needed is for him to enter the fiendcelestial’s tomb and pass the fiendcelestial’s test. Once that is achieved, he can then obtain the treasures that were left behind, as well as the will of the fiendcelestial.”

All sorts of expressions crossed the faces of the crowd. Some were shocked, some were puzzled, some were full of suspicion.

Inherit the fiendcelestial’s will? No one had ever heard of such a thing.
