Chapter 490: Elder Lin (5)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Self-destructed?” Another Xuanling Sect disciple’s complexion was nowhere better than Qin Huan’s.

“Grandfather!” Aghast filled Lin Feng, and he wanted to rush to Elder Lin.

“I’ll kill you!” Qin Huan heavily punched Lin Feng on the face.

Before this, Qin Huan obtained something good when he was out on a mission in a mountain, and, thus, his skills escalated, and he was promoted as an inner sect disciple as an exception. The current Lin Feng was no longer Qin Huan’s opponent and had no power to retaliate.

Once again, Lin Feng collapsed on the ground from Qin Huan’s punch and was unable to stand up. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Looking at Elder Lin’s miserable appearance, Ning Luo had an undetectable scoff in his eyes.

At that instant, Elder Lin was like someone who was about to die. He spat out large mouthfuls of blood and was heavily injured and extremely frail.

With the Demonic Blood Sword in hand, Ye Qingtang walked towards Elder Lin slowly, and her lips curled. “Elder Lin, I wonder if you still want to use my life in exchange for the safety of Lin Feng and yourself.”

Color drained from Elder Lin’s face as he saw the murderous intent in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

He was severely injured by the Revolving Soul Orb and no longer had any combat power left. Even if Ye Qingtang did not have sufficient primordial qi, it was extremely easy to kill him…

“Ye Qingtang… I am a Xuanling Sect elder… You…” Elder Lin dragged his damaged body and stumbled backward.

“Haha…” Ye Qingtang sneered. “But I remember that you have already betrayed Xuanling Sect. I’m afraid it is inappropriate to call yourself a sect elder now.”

In reality, Ye Qingtang already had the resolve to kill him regardless of whether he betrayed the sect.

In her previous life, after the secret of her Heart of the Demon God was revealed, Elder Lin tried to assassinate her once. Had Yun Shu not rushed there in time and used his life to protect her, she would have died in his hands.

Unable to succeed, Elder Lin subsequently spread the secret of Ye Qingtang’s Heart of the Demon God and caused her to be chased after for her life for over three hundred years by numerous forces who wished to obtain the Heart of the Demon God!

How could Ye Qingtang forget this blood feud?

Ye Qingtang was also a reasonable person. Since it was a debt her the previous life, she would seek revenge in this one…

“Ye… Ye Qingtang… What… What do you… want… to do!” Fear ultimately appeared on Elder Lin’s face as he saw the intensification of the murderous expression in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Swoosh!

Like a fiendish demon from the abyss, Ye Qingtang slashed her Demonic Blood Sword across, which was her most direct response.

Puff!

The Demonic Blood Sword pierced through Elder Lin’s chest instantly.

Elder Lin turned pale and let out a miserable scream.

“Does it hurt?” There was a sinister smile on Ye Qingtang’s face as she twisted the Demonic Blood Sword gently.

“Ah….!” Elder Lin screamed like that of a slaughtered pig.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang withdrew the Demonic Blood Sword and chopped off Elder Lin’s head.

Not far away, Zhu Changge turned around, unwilling and unable to bear the tragic sight.

After all, Elder Lin was once his Master.

“Grandfather!”

Lin Feng shouted from the top of his lungs as he glared at Ye Qingtang, wanting to tear her into pieces.

“What are you looking at!” Qin Huan’s fist rammed on Lin Feng’s face like raindrops. With a few punches and kicks, Lin Feng passed out.

After killing Elder Lin, Ye Qingtang walked towards Ning Luo with great strides.

No matter what, Ning Luo must not be allowed to leave this place alive today!

At that moment, Ning Luo looked at Ye Qingtang and chuckled. “Junior Sister Ye, you’re indeed amazing. Even Elder Lin died in your hands.”
