Chapter 796 Grand Imperial Sire (1)

Ye Qingtang turned around and strolled back.

The little Emperor was in the Blood Moon Elder’s hands, and he bit the Blood Moon Elder the moment he returned to his senses.

The Blood Moon Elder’s reaction was very fast, and he lifted the little Emperor up immediately. Imitating Ye Qingtang’s stance, he raised his hand and slapped the little Emperor’s bottom.

“Damn! How dare you think of biting me?”

The little white tiger watched the little Emperor from aside and suddenly felt that this scene was seemingly familiar.

“How will you release His Majesty?” Long Jiang took a deep breath and asked.

Ye Qingtang did not hurry to reply Long Jiang and spoke to Qu Xiangyang instead. “I have something to ask you. Come over first.”

Qu Xiangyang took a step forward.

“Please speak, benefactor.”

Ye Qingtang asked softly, “Is Her Lordship whom you mentioned the lady who assisted the former Emperor?”

Qu Xiangyang was rather taken aback.

“Yes.”

“Do you know where she went?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Qu Xiangyang shook his head.

“Her Lordship left hurriedly back then and did not say anything to us. Moreover, she was with the Grand Imperial Sire on the last day and disappeared afterward.”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she did not expect the outcome to be like this.

From what Qu Xiangyang had said, the last person who interacted with that lady was Nine Nights Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire?

Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment and looked at Long Jiang. “I want to meet the Grand Imperial Sire.”

“What?” Long Jiang was a little stunned.

“As long as the Grand Imperial Sire gives me a reply to a question, I’ll release your Emperor,” Ye Qingtang said.

Although she was rather confident that the lady was her mother, she needed to confirm it once again. Furthermore… she needed to know where that lady went.

Long Jiang’s expression darkened.

The Grand Imperial Sire was extremely ill and had been bedridden for years. His body was very frail, and if this person was allowed to meet the Grand Imperial Sire…

Long Jiang was caught in a dilemma.

The Great Emperor’s only child was the little Emperor, and Long Jiang himself was not the young man’s opponent. If the other party really killed the little Emperor, Nine Nights Dynasty would no longer have any ruler.

“I… I agree, but you must promise to release His Majesty after you meet the Great Emperor.” Long Jiang compromised as he had no alternative.

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Helpless, Long Jiang could only lead Ye Qingtang and the rest back to the palace.

The deaths of the father and son of the Qin family were gratifying to the people.

Moreover, Qin Long’s action of self-protection at the last moment stirred the dissatisfaction of the masses.

When the crowd was gone, the corpses of the father and son of the Qin family were abandoned on the corners of the street without a single person to collect their dead bodies.

Passing through the glamorous corridors of the royal palace, Long Jiang stopped outside the living quarters.

“The Grand Imperial Sire is inside. I’ll go in first to report to him.”

Ye Qingtang nodded in agreement. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The little Emperor had a twisted expression as he watched Long Jiang enter the… He secretly took a peek at Ye Qingtang but frantically looked away in fear when Ye Qingtang’s eyeballs moved.

In no time, the main entrance to the living quarters was opened.

“The Grand Imperial Sire told you all to enter,” Long Jiang said.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder entered the living quarters.

Although it was daytime outside, the living quarters were dim without a ray of light shining in. The thick curtains blocked the sunlight that entered through the window, and the massive living quarters were only a little lit up by candles.

The moment Ye Qingtang entered, she smelled the faint smell of herbs.

“Grand Imperial Sire, I’ve brought them in.” Long Jiang walked to the bedside and slowly lifted the bed curtains.
