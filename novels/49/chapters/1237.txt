Chapter 1238: Pagoda Of The Dead (3)

“Don’t talk nonsense, she is Ah Yao…” Ming Gu panicked when he saw that everyone was beginning to doubt Ye Qingtang’s identity. “Only senior members of Clan of the Undead know the incantation of blessing. If she is an impostor, how would she know it?”

“There were a few elders in the Clan of the Undead who have left the Temple of Shadows. It is possible that they leaked it,” said the leader of the Goblin Tribe.

“I don’t think so. The Holy Lord has been gone for so long. Without the Pagoda of the Dead, she naturally had no need to sing the incantation of blessing. It is natural that the recitation was a little choppy. Also, no one knows what the Holy Lord has experienced during this long interval. It is normal for habits to change.” Xue Fu agreed.

“Change? Aren’t these changes too big? Since when has the Holy Lord been so affable?” The leader of the Demon Tribe grunted coldly.

“I already said that she might have had some encounter that caused her personality to change. Why won’t you listen?” The panic on Ming Gu’s face instantly turned murderous. “Ah Yao has already put on the Nine Souls Rings, how can she be a fake? In this world, who but Ah Yao herself can wear her Dharma artifacts?!”

The tribe leaders were all stunned by Ming Gu’s words.

They immediately looked at Ming Wang. “Ming Wang, what do you think?”

Ming Wang had remained silent up to that point. At that moment, he raised his head slightly. His black eyes were narrowed slightly and had an icy look.

“We have ample time. We will eventually find out if she is authentic or not.”

Ming Gu was shocked when he saw Ming Wang’s icy expression.

“Elder Brother…”

Ming Wang swept a cold look at him.

“Shut up, you idiot… If she is really Ah Yao, I certainly will not hurt her. If she isn’t, I will make sure she begs for death…”

Ming Gu bit his lips. He looked at his elder brother who was filled with murderous intent and forced his fear down. He argued. “But the Nine Souls Ring…”

“How can you prove that the Nine Souls Ring is real?” Ming Wang looked at Ming Gu coldly.

“That’s right. The Nine Souls Ring was stolen, and we only encountered the Holy Lord while in pursuit of the ring. In that interval, the Nine Souls Ring was with that human. If someone is pretending to the Holy Lord, then she must be in cahoots with that human to secretly swap the ring and confuse us,” Lady Ghost said.

Ming Gu glared at Lady Ghost furiously.

“All this is just our conjecture. We cannot be certain of anything. If she is an impostor, then it won’t matter. But if she is really the Holy Lord and we offend her, we will be guilty of a terrible crime.” Xue Fu spoke carefully when he saw that Ming Wang and the tribe leaders did not believe in Ye Qingtang’s identity.

With that, silence fell in the Hall of Gloom.

It was just this worry that prevented them from acting hastily. It was no joking matter to offend the Holy Lord. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“I will investigate this matter,” Ming Wang said calmly.

“With Ming Wang on the job, we don’t need to worry.” The tribe leaders nodded and left successively.

However, they all had some suspicions of this Holy Lady who had suddenly returned. Only Ming Gu was unwavering in his faith.

…

Meanwhile, Ling Yan was rubbing the voice transmission stone in his hand. A faint smile lurked in the corners of his mouth.

When the little azure dragon saw Ling Yan’s expression, it secretly sneered.

“Honestly, was it your plan for Ye Qingtang to go to the Temple of Shadows? It was already part of your plan, wasn’t it?” said the little azure dragon.
