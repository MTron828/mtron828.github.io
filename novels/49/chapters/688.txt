“Is there anything you need?” Ye Qingtang glanced at Shangguan Rui indifferently.

“Haha…” Shangguan Rui laughed coldly as he sized up Ye Qingtang with an evil intention. “We have gone through the black market’s rules. Shouldn’t we talk about my rules next?”

“Your rules?” Ye Qingtang arched a brow slightly. “Tell me about it.”

A trace of insanity flashed across Shangguan Rui’s eyes, and he turned to look at his guard. “Where’s the knife?”

The guard walked up quickly and, once again, handed Shangguan Rui the dagger which was used to chop the young man’s head.

“My rules… Do you wish to know…” Shangguan Rui received the dagger and narrowed his eyes at Ye Qingtang. His scarlet and foul tongue licked his dry lips.

In the next second, a ferocious expression appeared on his face as he stabbed towards Ye Qingtang’s stomach with the dagger!

In everyone’s eyes, this sight was, however, extremely normal.

Everyone had already expected this outcome. An outsider who offended Shangguan Rui was destined to have such an outcome!

Pow!

A clear sound suddenly rang.

That beautiful young man who held a folding fan actually held Shangguan Rui’s left hand that held the dagger was in, with the sharp tip of the dagger stopping just half a finger away from the beautiful young man’s stomach.

The onlookers in the surrounding gasped at Ye Qingtang’s actions.

“This fellow actually dared to retaliate?!”

“An outsider actually countered Young Sir Shangguan. Is he not afraid that his entire family would have to suffer the wrath of Young Sir Shangguan?”

“Hmph. What an ignorant fool. He would have been the only one who would die, but now that he countered, he has brought death to his entire clan!”

The young man from earlier was much more powerful than Shangguan Rui, but he still did not dare to fight back until death, in fear that he would implicate his family.

Shangguan Rui’s father was the Dragon-Tiger General and the premier Qin Long’s trusted subordinate. Anyone who offended Shangguan Rui would face a terrifying outcome, and this was something that everyone in the monarch city knew.

Many years ago, someone could not see eye to eye with Shangguan Rui’s brutality and fought back, but in the end… not only was that person put to death by dismembering the body, but his entire clan was also annihilated because of this.

Shangguan Rui did not think that Ye Qingtang would dare to retaliate as well and was taken aback. When he returned to his senses, he looked up slowly and stared right at the emotionless Ye Qingtang. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Shangguan Rui’s lips curled up slightly, and a berserk smile suddenly appeared on his hideous face. “Good. Really good… This is so interesting. Hahahaha. I want your clan to be completely annihilated! Completely annihilated!”

That savage laugh reverberated throughout the black market, and many onlookers shook their heads secretly. This beautiful young man might have implicated his entire clan already.

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang looked at the enraged Shangguan Rui indifferently without panicking. Without waiting for Shangguan Rui to speak, she suddenly raised her right palm…

In the next second, Ye Qingtang’s right palm waved and flashed by before everyone’s eyes like a bolt of lightning.

Pow!

A clear sound echoed in the scene.

Silence…

A deadly silence…

Everyone was completely dumbstruck, and their jaws hung wide open after this clear sound rang.

Ye Qingtang’s right hand had actually slapped Shangguan Rui’s ugly face!!
