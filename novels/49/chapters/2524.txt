Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Blood Moon Elder knew that the Temple of Paragon was one of the top powers in the Second Domain. They were even linked to the Heavenly Emperor of the Third Domain…

As for the Heavenly Emperor, that was the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s main body!

His own main body was the Heavenly Emperor’s follower.

How could his Holy Lady not know about the background of the Temple of Paragon? Moreover, did the Temple of Paragon allow people to enter so easily?

“I think it’s best if you don’t think too much about where you’re going for now. They’re already catching up,” the big yellow dog quickly reminded them.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. The big yellow dog was right. Dozens of extremely powerful auras were approaching at an incredibly fast speed.

Before Ye Qingtang could consider further, the figures arrived.

Ye Qingtang sized them up. They were not the golden book elder’s group but the lady in green from the Sky Vault Sect and the middle-aged man in gold robes.

“So fast…”

Ye Qingtang was surprised and could not understand. Wasn’t the Sky Vault Sect locked in a fierce battle with the golden book elder and his men? How did they catch up so quickly?

There was no way Ye Qingtang believed that the golden book elder would lose. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Little b*tch, let’s see where you can run to.” The lady in green glared at Ye Qingtang with a cold glint in her eyes.

Without waiting for Ye Qingtang to say anything, the golden-robed man smiled and said, “Little girl, you can run quite fast. To be safe, I should break your legs and your hands first so that you can’t move. What do you think?”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She would not be able to deal with any one of them in her current state, not to mention this golden-robed middle-aged man, the Sky Vault Sect’s Branch Master.

“I say, you guys, enough is enough. Why are you bullying others? She’s still a young girl. If this gets out, won’t it be embarrassing for you?” The big yellow dog, who had been nestled in Ye Qingtang’s arms the entire time, suddenly spoke up.

A strange look flashed across the golden-robed man’s eyes. He sized up the big yellow dog carefully. It was indeed just an ordinary yellow dog. Why was it able to speak the human language? And from that, its intelligence was definitely above that of an elite demon beast. It was rather strange.

“A lowly beast dares to spout nonsense?” The lady in green shouted coldly.

But the golden-robed man waved his hand. Before Ye Qingtang knew what happened, the big yellow dog in her arms disappeared instantly and was taken away by the golden-robed middle-aged man.

The golden-robed man carried the big yellow dog in one hand and carefully inspected it.

“How strange. I am being reprimanded by a beast that can speak human language.” The golden-robed man smiled faintly.

“I am a dog. Don’t call me a beast. You can call me Big Yellow or Brother Canine,” said the big yellow dog.

The golden-robed man’s expression instantly changed. He lifted the big yellow dog into the air and flung it onto the ground.

With a loud boom, the ground beneath the golden-robed man’s feet shattered.

“You are just a beast. Your life is cheap, but you insist on being so mouthy.” The golden-robed man chuckled as he gazed at the “dead” big yellow dog.

“Damn you… That hurts!”

In the next second, as everyone watched on, the big yellow dog slowly stood up and shook its fur.

Upon seeing this, the golden-robed man frowned slightly and raised his leg. The sound of thunder rang out.. Gathering a mass of energy, he stepped heavily on the big yellow dog’s body.
