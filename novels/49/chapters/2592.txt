Ye Qingtang could tell that there was something on Feng Jiuyou’s mind. But since he was unwilling to say anything, she didn’t want to probe.

Soon after, Ye Qingtang followed Feng Jiuyou to the Feng family’s training ground.

‘The Feng family’s training arena was quite spacious, but there were not many people. At a glance, apart from the few youths that Feng Jiuyou had introduced two days ago, there were also a few older martial artists.

“Sister Ye Yue, why are you here?”

‘The young man who had praised Ye Qingtang for her good looks walked to Ye Qingtang’s side and smiled. From Feng Jiuyou’s introduction, Ye Qingtang knew that this young man’s name was Feng Wuyin. He was only 10 years old and was considered the youngest junior in the Feng family.

Seeing Feng Wuyin step forward, Ye Qingtang nodded and said to Feng Wuyin, “I came to train with you guys.”

Ye Qingtang had a very good impression of these young men from the Feng family. These children from the Feng family were the most naive martial arts practitioners Ye Qingtang had ever seen, and did not have the maturity and shrewdness that came with age. At this stage, they were still considered

innocent and pure. It was very relaxing for Ye Qingtang to be with these young men.

“Sister Ye Yue, really… then, Sister Ye Yue, can you teach me and Brother Jiuyou? We’ve already reached a bottleneck. Whether it be martial art skills or cultivation level, we can’t improve further.” Feng Wuyin reached out to tug at Ye Qingtang’s sleeve and stared at her with big watery eyes.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, a young man looked over and walked over to Feng Jiuyou and Feng Wuyin with an impassive expression.

“Feng Jiuyou, Feng Wuyin, who is she?”

‘The man asked as his gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

“Brother Feng Cang… this is Sister Ye Yue, a guest of our Feng family. She saved me when I was at Mt. Zhong and will be staying with our Feng family for a few days,” Feng Jiuyou hurriedly explained to the young man.

Feng Cang frowned as he said coldly, “Feng Jiuyou, who asked you to bring a stranger into our Feng family as a guest? Why is she staying here for a few days? Do you know her background?”

Feng Jiuyou immediately nodded and said, “Brother Feng Cang, I do know. Sister Ye Yue is a visitor from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain to the Divine Venerate Domain!”

The other young men looked at each other in dismay. They then looked disdainfully at Ye Qingtang.

‘The Mixed Heavens Holy Domain was just a second-class domain with a backward martial arts culture. The condescension of a higher domain for a lower domain was the same ever since ancient times.

The martial arts practitioners of the First Domain’s Blue Sky Domain looked down on the Mainland. Meanwhile, the Second Domain’s Mixed Heavens Holy Domain had never taken the Blue Sky Domain seriously. The Divine Venerate Domain naturally did not take the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain seriously

either. If the Fourth Domain had not been destroyed, the Fourth Domain probably would have looked down upon the Third Domain too.

This sense of superiority—some were born with it, while others were nurtured. Such situations more or less existed in every domain. It was not rare.

However, Ye Qingtang could not help shaking her head as she looked at Feng Cang and the rest.

It was true that the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain could not be compared to the Divine Venerate Domain. However, it was one thing for the top-notch experts of the Divine Venerate Domain to look down on the martial arts culture of the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, but these people were only at the most Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

ordinary Divine Lord stage. Where did this sense of superiority come from?
