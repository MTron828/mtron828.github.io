Dai Changming’s face was extremely unpleasant. He wanted to find a way to escape, but the fear he held towards the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect was above everything else. He scanned through everyone’s faces in the cage.

Everyone here was pale.

However…

Dai Changming’s sight fixed.

“Where’s Ye Qingtang?”

Everyone was here except Ye Qingtang.

Qin Huan also realized that.

Zhou Qu was scared to death. He felt jealous when he realized that Ye Qingtang was not there.

“She ran away! She left us and ran away! What a coward she is! We should not have brought her along!” He shouted.

Though he was cursing, he wished that the one who escaped was him.

Everyone was silent after Zhou Qu’s curse.

They all understood the hopeless situation they were in right now.

They were like ants in front of the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect. It would be their greatest luck if they could escape from here. No one even imagined standing up and fighting him. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Even though Ye Qingtang’s action went against the sect’s rules, they would not say anything now.

Zhou Qu squatted down in fear. He was almost driven to insanity by the desperate feeling. He gave Qin Huan a ferocious stare and said, “Qin Huan, this is your dear Junior Sister? You bring her along for everything. What did she do in return? She left you and escaped when there was danger. I really pity you.”

Qin Huan frowned but did not argue with Zhou Qu.

What could Ye Qingtang do if she did not escape?

She was just a new disciple of the sect. Even the inner sect disciples also did not have any ways to fight off the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect, what could she do?

During the arguments, the Elders had killed many people. This time, his target was fixed on the two disciples of the Wind Moon Sect. When his sight landed on the innocent youth, a streak of red light sparkled through his eyes.

He raised his hand and pointed to the youth who hid behind his Senior Brother.

“Bring him out.”

The dried-up body could not be used anymore. Even if he absorbed enough essence spirit, he could not change the appearance of the body. The youth gave him a special feeling as he had a rare physique.

That was the perfect body for him to use!

The zombies walked towards the cage where the two disciples of the Wind Moon Sect were at.

The youth seldom came out, and he had never experienced such situations before. His face turned pale when he heard that the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect wanted to take him out. His hands held the sleeves of his Senior Brother tightly, and his eyes were full of fear.

“Senior Brother… please… please help me…” The soft voice came from his mouth. He almost cried out.

His Senior Brother’s face was very unpleasant. He struggled to hold his breath under the Elder’s enchanting voice and stood in front of the youth. When the two zombies opened the gate to pull the youth out, the Senior Brother suppressed his fear and pushed away the two zombies.

“Don’t touch my Junior Brother!” The pale young man’s face was full of cold sweat. He stood straight, protecting the youth behind him.
