Chapter 1560 Thousand Treasures Pavilion 1

The consecutive fights made Ye Qingtang realize the skills of these so-called extraordinary talents in the Jiang Family.All the supreme family clans would send their best juniors to the Martial Arts Championship. If Ye Qingtang wished to gain this chance, it was impossible with her current skills.

After Ye Qingtang left the Temple of Shadows, she had been consolidating her new power constantly, and she was in complete control of it currently. Moreover, there were traces of a breakthrough from the cultivation in this period of time.

However, this was far from enough.

Jiang Shaobai led Ye Qingtang around the Taiyuan Valley, and one spot caught Ye Qingtang’s attention.

“This is the Thousand Treasure Pavilion. The Taiyuan Valley juniors like us can come here to exchange for some treasures if we gain honor points,” Jiang Shaobai said with a grin as she glanced at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang had been to a place like Thousand Treasures Pavilion in Xuanling Sect and exchanged for many good items. However, Xuanling Sect in the first mainland was incomparable to the Domain Monarch’s Jiang Family.

Noticing that Ye Qingtang seemed to be interested in this place, Jiang Shaobai entered the place with Ye Qingtang.

The Thousand Treasures Pavilion had a total of seven floors. The higher the floor, the higher the grade of the treasures. Apart from weapons and elixirs, there were even battle pets. As long as one had sufficient honor points, any item could be exchanged in return.

When Ye Qingtang walked into the Thousand Treasures Pavilion, two youths happened to be exchanging for an item.

“Is that the Condensing Ice Glove?” Ye Qingtang spotted a pair of ice blue gloves in one of the youth’s hands in an instant.

The glove had an extremely striking appearance and gave off a dazzling brilliance in the candlelight. Overall, it was presented in a translucent state as though it was made from glaciers.

The Condensing Ice Glove was an extremely precious weapon. When worn, a single punch could freeze rivers and oceans in an instant. Such an item could not even be seen in the first mainland and was rare even in the Central Mainland.

“Mhm.” Jiang Shaobai seemed to not be interested in the Condensing Ice Glove.

“Give me a bottle of Qi Yuan Pills.” Another youth told the person in charge with a smile.

A look of surprise flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes the moment she heard that term.

The Qi Yuan Pill was a supreme-grade pill that could assist one’s cultivation. Not only could it increase cultivation speed, but it could also change one’s body composition. Anyone with a poor constitution could refine it through consuming this pill.

However, this Qi Yuan Pill was truly precious, and only a handful of master-grade alchemists could refine this item.

When Ye Qingtang was in the first mainland, she obtained plenty of master-grade and even grandmaster-grade elixirs. However, the alchemy grade in the first mainland was acutely miserable when compared to the Central Mainland. Even a grandmaster-grade alchemist from the First Mainland could only be considered as a middle-grade alchemist at most in the Central Mainland. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The youth obtained a bottle of Qi Yuan Pills, which sounded a lot, but there was only one pill in the bottle.

The Qi Yuan Pill was extremely hard to source, and many family clans offered extravagant amounts of money just for one pill. Nonetheless, the pills refined by a master-grade alchemist were already scrambled for by the major forces, and anyone apart from the top forces simply could not obtain such a pill.

The Temple of Shadows had plenty of elixirs and pills as well. However, those could only be used by the Undead Clan, and Ye Qingtang could only look at them.
