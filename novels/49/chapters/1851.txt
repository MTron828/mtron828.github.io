Chapter 1852: One More Round (1)

When Ye Qingtang opened the dice cup, the fat catfish was dumbfounded. Its mouth fell open in shock and its whiskers quivered.

There were two sixes and one five in her dice cup...

It was one point bigger than the fat catfish’s number...

The fat catfish’s face turned charcoal black. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Oh? Seems like I have a bigger number. I was really worried for a moment.” Ye Qingtang looked at the dice cup and patted her chest in relief.

Everyone was shocked.

What was going on?

They heard Ye Qingtang’s dice cup just now, it was small numbers. How could it... become like this?

The fat catfish’s whiskers curled up in anger. It glared at Ye Qingtang furiously. It didn’t anticipate Ye Qingtang’s number to be bigger than its number... Also, it observed Ye Qingtang carefully just now, it hadn’t noticed Ye Qingtang use any powers.

How could the number change?

Baili Xi and the others were also confused. But no matter what, Ye Qingtang had won.

They heaved a sigh of relief.

“Can you tell us the rules now?” Ye Qingtang smiled as she asked.

Though the fat catfish was still confused, it kept its promise and told them the rules.

This mystic realm is just like a huge casino. The fat catfishes here did not go by clans. They merely live in this mystic realm and gambled all day. In fact, there was nothing gambling couldn’t solve in this mystic realm.

If there was, then they could always gamble as well.

The fat catfishes didn’t need to pay for meals and water, they only needed to gamble for it.

“What do you bet?” Mu Feiruo asked out of curiosity.

The fat catfish scanned them, spitting out a diamond-shaped gemstone. The gemstone was entirely orange and it glistened as the light hit it, even more eye-catching than any diamond.

“We use these spirit stones as stakes. Since you’re human and don’t have spirit stones, you can use your Dharma artifacts instead.” The fat catfish was still indignant about losing.

The fat catfishes here loved gambling, they had to gamble no matter what, and that was the only thing they did every day. Hence, they were used to admitting their losses.

If anyone dared to back out, no one would gamble with them anymore.

To the fat catfish, it would die from not being able to gambling.

“What...” The Little White Tiger’s head hurt as it listened. This was its first time meeting such a strange being.

Ye Qingtang was observant and found out that the spirit stone that the fat catfish just spat out had strong spirit energy. It felt just like the spirit energy was compressed inside the spirit stone.

Could the spirit energy inside the spirit stones be used for their cultivation?

They spent some time understanding the rules and prepared to walk towards where the fat catfishes were gathered.

From the description of this fat catfish, they already found out that none of them were interested in attacking outsiders. As long as no one provoked the fat catfish, they wouldn’t be bothered and are extremely welcoming of outsiders to join them in gambling.

When the fat catfish noticed that they wanted to leave, it still felt indignant about losing and said, “Hold on.”

“You want to back out?” Jiang Shaobai looked at the fat catfish.

The fat catfish cleared its throat. “I want to have another round with you.” Its words were meant for Ye Qingtang.
