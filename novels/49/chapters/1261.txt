Chapter 1262: What Was Going On? (3)

“Not enough… This is far from enough. I still need… more… more power…”

Luo Qufeng inched closer towards Ye Qingtang, and the thirst in his eyes was increasingly insatiable.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, you’re indeed the most powerful… Give me your powers. I can become even more powerful…” Red speckles of light flickered in his eyes as he lunged at Ye Qingtang violently.

Has he had enough!

Ye Qingtang wailed in her heart as she watched Luo Qufeng lunging towards him once again.

She did not even know how she severely wounded Luo Qufeng earlier on. Now that his skills multiplied once again, how was she going to contend against him?

She could not pray for a miracle to happen again, could she?

Ye Qingtang finally realized that the ‘Holy Lord of Shadows’ title was simply the source of a huge disaster if one did not possess the skills to suppress millions like the original Holy Lord did!

Now that Luo Qufeng’s skills soared, his speed was even more shocking. Given Ye Qingtang’s skills, she could not even see Luo Qufeng’s figure clearly and could only feel a killing intent approaching her continuously.

With Luo Qufeng’s current enhanced skills, anyone behind Ye Qingtang would simply be banished to death once they were caught by Luo Qufeng, much less herself, an impersonator of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

At this instant, even if Ye Qingtang wished to escape, she was firmly blocked by the powerful figures behind her, and she could not move anywhere.

All she felt was a surging killing intent rushing towards her.

Luo Qufeng’s figure appeared beside Ye Qingtang all of a sudden.

He was smart this time. He did not confront Ye Qingtang with force and instead directly executed the technique to absorb others’ cultivation base by slamming his palm on Ye Qingtang’s shoulder and injecting endless red gleam from his palm into Ye Qingtang’s body.

Perhaps he was unable to defeat her by brute force, but as long as he used this cultivation technique, he could completely suck Ye Qingtang dry of her cultivation base in an instant!

By then, he would possess absolute power that surpassed everyone else!

Without even seeing clearly how Luo Qufeng approached her, Ye Qingtang felt Luo Qufeng’s hand on her shoulder, and she knew she was in trouble.

Luo Qufeng’s technique was activated immediately, and an endless red gleam rushed out as though it wanted to completely infiltrate into her body and absorb all her cultivation base.

Ye Qingtang’s heart was completely cold.

She was really dead this time. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However…

Just as she was overwhelmed with despair, a force in her body was suddenly stimulated.

The Mutated Heavenly Demon Bloodline that was buried deep in her body felt an external force attempting to suck her cultivation base and flared up abruptly!

The Mutated Heavenly Demon Bloodline was stimulated instantly, and the power of the Devouring Bloodline directly counter-attacked through the force that Luo Qufeng injected into Ye Qingtang’s body!

Luo Qufeng, who initially wished to absorb all of Ye Qingtang’s cultivation base, felt that his technique to absorb cultivation bases was executed successfully, but before he could absorb a tiny bit of cultivation base, he suddenly felt an overwhelming force reflecting back at him through his own technique!

In just a moment, an insurmountable force directly invaded Luo Qufeng’s body.

The greed on Luo Qufeng’s face turned into astonishment immediately!

What was going on?!

Not only did he fail to absorb Ye Qingtang’s cultivation base, but his own cultivation base was beginning to be absorbed away by a force instead!!
