Chapter 2224: Nothing Much (3)

Peng Ji knew of Spy Cloud’s mission. After thinking it through carefully, he replied, “I didn’t notice anything suspicious. When I first met them with the Night Soul Beast in pursuit, they were also scared witless. The only person who appeared nonchalant was the one who spoke to you just now.

“I heard those teenagers call him Boss. Perhaps he’s their leader. He is not powerful but he still put on a brave front for those teenagers, claiming that he wanted to fight the Night Soul Beast.” Peng Ji smirked.

“Sacrificing one’s life to save face. How foolish,” Shi Shangfei commented.

Peng Ji said, “He is really an ignorant fool. If they hadn’t met Division Head Shi and your team, they would probably die horrible deaths. But Division Head Shi, if you think it’s necessary, we can just...”

Their mission in the Evil Soul Forest was extremely important. they heard that the other factions had already made their move. They wouldn’t be able to bear the consequences if someone else got to it first.

“Did you say that they had already come face-to-face with the Night Soul Beast?” Shi Shangfei asked.

Peng Ji nodded.

“Then we won’t need to bother about them. The Night Soul Beast will settle them for us,” Shi Shangfei replied.

A ragtag bunch of Paragon level teenagers. How could they hope to escape the pursuit of a Night Soul Beast?

Likewise, Peng Ji couldn’t help shuddering at the mention of the Night Soul Beast. He had also been marked by the Night Soul Beast...

“Don’t worry, just heal up. We will protect you.” Shi Shangfei could see Peng Ji’s fear.

Peng Ji heaved a sigh of relief. “With Division Head Shi here, I think the Night Soul Beast wouldn’t dare to show its face.”

Shi Shangfei nodded before leading his team forward.

...

On the other side, Lei Yan heaved a sigh of relief after Shi Shangfei and his men left.

“We were lucky to have met those Spy Cloud men. Otherwise we would have died in the hands of that Night Soul Beast.”

Lei Yan felt a lingering fear when he recalled the image of that Night Soul Beast. It was only natural that he believed the Night Soul Beast left because it sensed Shi Shangfei and his team approaching.

“Do you really think the Night Soul Beast fled because of them?” Qin Feng raised one eyebrow at the still-anxious Lei Yan.

Lei Yan nodded.

“Fool.” Qin Feng shot Lei Yan a look.

Lei Yan was taken aback by the unexpected insult.

“Qin Feng, you...”

Qin Feng explained. “Although there were a few Divine Lord level people in that team, don’t you remember that Peng Ji said his team also had a Divine Lord level practitioner?”

“If a few Divine Lord level practitioners are enough to make a Night Soul Beast retreat, then the Evil Soul Forest would have long been trampled over by groups of powerful practitioners.”

A Divine Lord level was powerful in the eyes of humans, but its nothing to a Night Soul Beast.

Amongst them, Qin Feng was the one closest to the Divine Lord level. He had once been just one step away from ascending to that level. How could he not know the disparity between the power of the Night Soul Beast and a Divine Lord-level practitioner?

Just a dozen Divine Lord-level practitioners?

Even if Shi Shangfei and his team were all at the Divine Lord level, they would still not be a match for the Night Soul Beast.

Ye Qingtang looked pleased as she observed Qin Feng. He was indeed a descendant of the Qin family Sword Deity. He had pretty good brains.

Lei Yan didn’t know how to rebut and didn’t dare to insist. So he just kept quiet but his face was full of indignance. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Boss, there’s danger everywhere here, and we don’t know when the Night Soul Beast will appear again. It doesn’t matter why it left. We won’t be safe if we remain here,” Yun Chen pointed out as he stepped forward.
