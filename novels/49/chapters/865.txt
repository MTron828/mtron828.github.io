Chapter 866 The Bloodline of the Jiang Family Clan

The midget frowned slightly and looked towards Ling Yan. He hesitated for a while and said, “My highness… Will Miss Ye be alright? Perfected Gu Yun is strong. I can protect Miss Ye secretly. However… if we let her face him herself…”

Ling Yan said slowly, “So you’re saying that my decision is inappropriate?”

“I don’t dare to judge your decision!”

The midget kneeled on the ground with one leg immediately.

“Based on her karmic natal chart, her future will not be peaceful… If she remains as a flower in the greenhouse without going through any hardship, even I cannot change her destiny when she loses her own strength… Do you know how most of the powerful people’s offspring die?” Ling Yan said.

“Yes… whenever they face some problems, those powerful people will appear and solve them… This results in the children being mediocre and arrogant. The day when the powerful people leave is the day the children will die.”

The midget sighed. He had witnessed so many such cases, just like his older brother’s child.

“Miss Ye is definitely not this type of person… Furthermore, she is strong and powerful, more powerful than both of us could imagine… It’s possible that our survival and death will be held in her hands. Your concern is not necessary.” Ling Yan waved his sleeve and walked forward.

Ye Qingtang was walking into the deeper part of the forest with Feng Wudang, Li Bingxue, and Gu Tianhe.

A figure appeared in the mid-air and then disappeared.

“That’s… Ye You?”

Ye Qingtang recognized Ye You with just one glance.

“I did not expect Ye You to be here as well…” Li Bingxue stared above her and said coldly.

“You know Ye You?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Ye You seemed to vaporize from the world ever since she saw her at the Hell of Avicinaraka last time. She reappeared at the region of the Dragon Vein this time.

However, Ye Qingtang was curious about why Li Bingxue and the rest would know about Ye You…

“Who’s Ye You? How come I don’t know as well, Junior Sister Li?”

Gu Tianhe looked at Li Bingxue in confusion, and so did Feng Wudang. Both of them had never heard the name Ye You before.

“Jiang Duantian’s granddaughter…” Li Bingxue said mysteriously.

Feng Wudang and Gu Tianhe were both shocked when they heard the name of Jiang Duantian.

Jiang Duantian was the Domain Master of the First Domain. His martial ability was above everyone else, and he was the renowned supreme chief. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Wait, how can he have a granddaughter when he doesn’t even have a daughter?” Gu Tianhe frowned and asked.

“I’m not clear about that, but I heard about it during a conversation between the President and an elder,” Li Bingxue said.

“

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought.

Ye Qingtang surely knew about Ye You’s identity since she had lived two lives.

The Jiang family clan was the first family with a surname in the Central Mainland. Jiang Duantian had a daughter who was obsessed with the cultivation of space array formations.

Some mistakes happened when Jiang Duantian’s daughter was setting up a space array formation, and it went across the Dimension Wall of the mainland and came to this place. She then met one of the Great Elders of Ye family, Ye You’s father, Ye Yun.

The two of them gave birth to Ye You.

Ye You contained the bloodline of the Jiang family clan, which could be sensed by the Jiang family. However, the Dimension Wall blocked off the sensor of bloodline.

After the Dimension Wall was destroyed, the Jiang family sensed Ye You’s bloodline instantly and brought her back to the Central Dynasty.
