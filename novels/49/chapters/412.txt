“Lingtian should become an elite disciple at the end of this year. This is the last time that he will be participating in the Three Sect Competition. I initially wanted to watch him and Shen Qingyu spar, but I guess there’s no chance to this year,” the Qinglin Sect elder said with a smile. Although he was exchanging polite words with the Wind Moon Sect elder, there was smugness in his tone.

His disciple, Fu Lingtian, topped the Three Sect Competition for three consecutive years, and his skills were not to be belittled on.

The Wind Moon Sect elder smiled as he chided the Qinglin Sect elder for being shameless in his heart. Fu Lingtian clearly had the qualification to become an elite disciple in Qinglin Sect since a long time ago, but the Qinglin Sect elder delayed it by a year in order to let him participate in the Three Sect Competition for another year.

The Qinglin Sect elder still wished for Fu Lingtian and Shen Qingyu to spar. While Shen Qingyu was very gifted, he was still young and was merely twelve years old this year. How could he spar with Fu Lingtian, who placed first for three consecutive years?

As the two sect elders tested each other through their conversation, the people from Xuanling Sect walked over.

“Elder Du, Elder Qian,” greeted Elder Mo, the leader of the Xuanling Sect elders.

“Elder Mo.” Elder Du nodded slightly.

Elder Qian swept a glance across the Xuanling Sect team and said, “Elder Mo, the people participating in the Three Sect Competition this year from Xuanling Sect seem to be the same.

Elder Mo did not say anything, and the elders behind him had a rather ugly expression.

“The Three Sect Competition will officially begin tomorrow. I still need to instruct the disciples and will not accompany you all anymore. I’ll take a leave first.” Elder Qian lifted a hand to signal and left.

Elder Du left soon after as well.

As the elders from the two sects who were initially chatting happily left, the faces of Elder Mo and the rest who were still standing there turned dull.

Ye Qingtang followed the other disciples into the court, and her brows were furrowed slightly when she saw the Qinglin Sect and Wind Moon Sect elders leaving after greeting the Xuanling Sect elders perfunctorily.

Witnessing the sight, the other Xuanling Sect disciples similarly did not feel good.

In the recent hundred years, Xuanling Sect barely had any achievements in the Three Sect Competition, where the top disciple was mostly from the Wind Moon Sect and the Qinglin Sect. Currently, Qinglin Sect’s fame gradually increased due to Yunxiao Sect’s support, and with Wind Moon Sect, it was a fight between two tigers. Rather, it was Xuanling Sect which seemed to be absent from the battle.

“Why do I find the person that the two sect elders mentioned a little familiar?” a Xuanling Sect disciple asked curiously.

“Why wouldn’t it be? That Fu Lingtian topped the Three Sect Competition for three years consecutively. It is said that he is extremely talented, and his comprehension abilities are very strong. I didn’t know that he would still be here this year…”

“I heard of that Shen Qingyu before. It is said that he is a blue spirit root. Although he is only about twelve or thirteen, he is extremely tough, and Elder Du from the Wind Moon Sect babied him a lot. He is still young now though. I reckon that in at most three to four years, we should be able to see him on the ring of the Three Sect Competition.”

“Blue spirit root?! Are you for real? In this day and age, a blue spirit root is extremely rare. I’ve never heard of many people who have it. In our sect, the highest-grade spirit root seems to only be a green spirit root.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Obviously. Do you think that blue spirit roots are carrots and vegetables that can be found all over the ground? Let me tell you, at the beginning of this year, the Sect Master of the Yunxiao Sect personally accepted a person with a blue spirit root as his official disciple.”

The disciples gasped upon hearing the information. The person had a blue spirit root and was even favored by the Sect Master of a super sect. Even if one used their bum to think, it was obvious that the disciple accepted by Yunxiao Sect’s Sect Master would become extremely powerful in no time.
