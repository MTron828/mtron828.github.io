Chapter 1955: Old Acquaintance (5)

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the murderous intent in her heart.

Ancient You Clan!

Up in the air, Ming Di wore a grave expression. To those bystanders, it was just a short fight. But during that short period of time, Ming Di and Little Luo Xue had exchanged over a hundred moves.

During that exchange, Ming Di could clearly feel the unbelievable power of that kid. It was way above that of those previous youths.

“Kid, you are indeed something. What’s your name?” Ming Di asked in a cold voice.

Meanwhile, Little Luo Xue was completely unresponsive. He continued to stare at Ming Di with empty eyes as if he was looking at his prey.

When Ye Qingtang observed Ming Di’s actions, her heart sank.

Ming Di would never deign to speak to those he deemed weaker than himself. This was the first time Ming Di was trying to converse with his opponent. That meant Ming Di could not afford to underestimate Little Luo Xue’s powers.

Ye Qingtang gazed over at the Ancient You Clan. She had no idea how many more monsters the Ancient You Clan had cultivated inside that deep canyon.

“Ming Di.”

Ming Di’s eyes wavered the moment Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke. No one else noticed that a hint of wonder also flashed past Little Luo Xue’s eyes. But before that glimmer could turn into anything else, it was sucked into that emotionless dark pit.

“Let’s go.” Ye Qingtang suddenly gave the command to retreat.

Ming Di was taken aback. The ancient clan folks were likewise dumbstruck.

What was going on? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Holy Lord of Shadows wanted to retreat?

Before the rest of the people could start to comprehend Ye Qingtang’s order, Ming Di flew down and swept Ye Qingtang onto his back. Without any hesitation, he flew up into the sky.

“Trying to escape?!” The Ancient You Clan warden uttered coldly when he saw Ye Qingtang leaving.

Ming Di suddenly opened his jaws and spewed out a torrent of black flames across everything.

“This is not the end.” Ye Qingtang was standing upon Ming Di’s back and staring at the unmoving Little Luo Xue. Pain flashed across her eyes.

At Ye Qingtang’s command, Ming Di flew away into the distance. At that, the ancient clan folks also hurried away while the eight tribe leaders brought the Jiang family members along with them in accordance with Ye Qingtang’s orders.

The warden was full of frustration as he stared after the departing crowd. He wanted to order Little Luo Xue to pursue them.

But Little Luo Xue ignored his command. Instead, he hovered there, unmoving in the sky.

“Enough.” An old, frail voice suddenly rang out from behind. The warden immediately turned and saw the elder walking over. A large group of youths were tagging along behind the elder.

“Elder, it seems such a waste to let them leave now. Shouldn’t we take this opportunity to kill them all?” The warden asked.

A smirk appeared on the elders face. “It’s not the right time.”

He lifted his eyes and looked at Little Luo Xue.

“Luo Xue’s condition is still unstable. With his current powers, he would be on par with Ming Di at best. And the true power behind the Temple of Shadows is the Holy Lord. We cannot be certain of victory if we engage them now.”

While Little Luo Xue might be able to hold off Ming Di, they would need a lot more than that to handle the Holy Lord of Shadows.

They would bide their time.
