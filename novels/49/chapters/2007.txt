Chapter 2008: Working Together (3)

“The Frost Abyss is where those of alien races reside. If I was able to find out that the ambassadors from the Crimson League were there, with their power and influence, the Ancient You Clan would definitely know about it too,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Even though we didn’t see eye to eye in the past, they rarely attacked us and the theft of the Netherworld Ring was the first time they made a move against us...” She pretended to be deep in thought.

From those words alone, she was implying that the Ancient You Clan’s target was not the Temple of Shadows and that they had been targeting the Crimson League in the first place.

Swayed by the fact that the Netherworld Ring was fake as well, the three ambassadors from the Crimson League all felt that her story was indeed believable.

Their hatred for the Ancient You Clan inexplicably increased.

“No wonder they brought out a fake Netherworld Ring to fool with me. They were against us from the start,” Bai Zhi said with a cold scoff.

“The Netherworld Ring was a fake?” Ye Qingtang pretended to be astonished by this news. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“That’s right,” Bai Zhi said, “I thought they would understand the situation they were in but who knew that they would try to trick me again and again. I will not stand for this.”

Ye Qingtang was bubbling with joy underneath but her face remained calm.

“I never imagined that the Ancient You Clan would be so arrogant.”

“I have already reported this to the League Chief. The Crimson League will be sending troops over in a few days, and at that time the Ancient You Clan will have no choice but to hand the Netherworld Ring over,” Bai Zhi said through gritted teeth, she had never been made such a fool before.

While Ye Qingtang was glad to hear this, she felt that even though the Crimson League wanted to punish the Ancient You Clan, it wasn’t to the point of desperation yet.

She had to fan the flames even more.

After all, the Crimson League was the key to dealing with the Ancient You Clan.

“This shouldn’t be hard since the League Chief is overseeing it. Why don’t the three of you stay in the Temple of Shadows for now? I’ll inform you immediately if there is any movement on the Ancient You Clan’s side,” she suggested with false sincerity.

The man in black robes nodded without saying anything. Bai Zhi was unhappy with this arrangement but could only nod silently.

As for the last person...

He hadn’t said anything from start to finish, such that people had begun to forget that he was even there. He was just like a porcelain statue.

As soon as she instructed Xue Fu to get the three ambassadors settled, she quickly went to find Ling Yan to come up with ideas to provoke the Crimson League.

He whispered a few things in her ear. She understood immediately and started working behind the scenes.

...

Meanwhile, on the side of the Ancient You Clan, things were a mess.

Apart from the Ancient Clans that had gone to seek shelter in the Temple of Shadows, the Ancient You Clan had wiped out all the other clans and collected their Spirit of Chaos fragments. All that was left now was to attack the Temple of Shadows and obtain their fragments.

But...

They had not expected the Crimson League to intervene just as their plan was about to succeed.

Several of the Ancient You Clan’s strongholds had been destroyed by the three alien race ambassadors in a matter of days.

This was causing a massive headache to the Ancient You Clan.

“What’s happening? Didn’t we already returned the Netherworld Ring to them?” The faces of many Elders in the main hall were tense as they looked at Elder Mo, who was in charge of all this.

His expression was extremely dark as well.

He had personally handed the Netherworld Ring over, yet the Crimson League had told him that it was fake...

The last thing they wanted right was a fight with the Crimson League, especially at this point.
