Chapter 2455: Bringing You To The New World (1)

Wen Qi fell silent as he watched Ye Qing suddenly disappear from the screen. In fact, he did not even consider the Space Technique. He wondered if Ye Qing had really found another way to leave the palace.

After all, they were in the outside world and could only understand the situation inside the Wailing Well through the screen. They could not hear anything and could only rely on their own guesses.

…

Inside the palace in the Wailing Well.

Nangong Lie, Mu Ziying, and the rest were stunned. Their Boss had actually disappeared without a trace in front of them.

“Where’s Boss?”

Lei Yan looked around. However, there was no sign of their Boss in the palace. It was as if Ye Qing had never appeared.

Jing Ze and Yun Chen looked at each other with strange expressions. Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher were also confused.

Ye Qing had been standing right before them but disappeared in the blink of an eye. It was difficult to understand.

“Could it be that Teacher Ye Qing has found a way to leave this palace?” The Flying Star Academy teacher’s expression shifted.

Lu Yuanxiang and the others were stunned by his words. If Ye Qing really knew the way to leave the palace, they would be saved.

By the side, the big yellow dog shook its tail and gazed at the people in the palace, shaking its head.

It realized that it was wrong. Previously, it thought that Ye Qingtang was the weakest human it had ever seen. But now, it seemed that these people were even weaker than her. They were ridiculously weak.

They couldn’t even detect the mysterious Deity Ocean in Ye Qingtang’s body.

At that moment, the big yellow dog tilted its head in thought. With her current skill level, there was no way she could control the Deity Ocean in her body. Now that it had given her a boost and helped her enter the Deity Ocean, would she encounter any danger…

If she accidentally died in the Deity Ocean, it would probably be trapped in this damned low-class palace for eternity.

However, before the dog could think further, there was a flash and Ye Qingtang reappeared.

Ye Qingtang was confused. Others could not understand what had happened, much less her. Just now, she had tried to reconnect with her Deity Ocean, but it was like a closed door that could not be pushed at all. However, the big yellow dog wagged its tail at her and she actually entered…

What shocked Ye Qingtang even more was that when she entered the Deity Ocean space this time, the Eastern demons were being chased by the Heavenly Demon Tribe. Falling from the sky, Ye Qingtang had crashed into one of the demons from the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

Ye Qingtang’s crash completely infuriated the Heavenly Demon Tribe. Casting all other concerns aside, they attacked Ye Qingtang with all their might. She had never seen such a huge battle array before and immediately turned tail and ran.

After being chased by the Heavenly Demon Tribe over a lengthy period, she finally reconnected with the Deity Ocean and escaped. Otherwise, she would have lost her life.

Ye Qingtang was exasperated. She had only accidentally knocked into one of their demons. It wasn’t even harmed, but they treated her like she was their mortal enemy. Weren’t they overreacting? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Boss…”

Mu Ziying, Qin Feng, and the rest looked at each other in dismay when they noticed Ye Qing’s strange expression. For a moment there, the atmosphere was a little tense.

Outside, when Wen Qi and the other Vice-Presidents saw that Ye Qing had returned to the palace, they were even more certain that Ye Qing’s disappearance earlier definitely had nothing to do with the so-called Space Technique. Instead, it was very likely that Ye Qing had found another way to leave the palace..
