Spirit Consonance River?

Ye Qingtang did hear of this name in her previous lifetime. That was basically a land of spirit energy that only inner sect disciples could afford to use. The effects of cultivating in there were completely incomparable to cultivating in normal places: even if one were to spend half a month cultivating in other ordinary places, it was impossible for the effect to be better than two hours of cultivation in the Spirit Consonance River.

It was indeed a good spot to upgrade herself rapidly.

Elder Qin saw that Ye Qingtang was tempted and added on immediately. “However, the Spirit Consonance River is reserved for Xuanling Sect’s inner sect disciples to use. If outer sect disciples wish to use the Spirit Consonance River, they must pay five thousand Xuanming points for every two hours of usage. You must think carefully.”

Five thousand Xuanming points?

Ye Qingtang was slightly shocked. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It should be known that inner sect disciples only needed to pay one thousand Xuanming points for every two hours of usage while outer sect disciples had to pay five times the amount!

It could be said that the best conditions for cultivation were concentrated in the inner sect and were simply treasures that outer sect disciples could not think of.

Ye Qingtang was still at Connate Level 7 and was two levels away from the peak in the outer sect, Connate Level 9. Her spirit root was about to improve, and if she could use the Spirit Consonance River to upgrade herself in this period of time, perhaps there was hope to successfully advance to Connate Level 9.

To enter Xuanling Sect’s inner sect, one had to be the top three disciples in the outer sect, and those three people were definitely at Connate Level 9.

Ye Qingtang could only go all out if she wanted to enter Xuanling Sect’s inner sect in the shortest time possible.

“I will head to the Spirit Consonance River to exchange for six hours of usage later,” Ye Qingtang said.

Elder Qin nodded slightly.

Right after fifty thousand Xuanming points were gained, more than half of it was already spent. Subtracting the fifteen thousand Xuanming points for the Spirit Consonance River, Ye Qingtang only had five thousand Xuanming points left.

And once she entered the inner sect, her spending would become even bigger. However… Ye Qingtang would definitely not be thrifty on these matters.

Earning Xuanming points was to make oneself more powerful, and, obviously, spending it would be useful.

Thousands of Xuanming points were drawn away immediately. Elder Qin’s heart was complicated when he looked at Ye Qingtang. He always felt that Ye Qingtang was not like ordinary new disciples and had always been very steady. Yet, unexpectedly, she was actually very bold this time.

“The Xuanming points have been drawn away. Half a month later, you can head for the inner sect assessment directly,” Elder QIn said.

Ye Qingtang nodded. After thanking Elder QIn, she left the Elders’ Hall.

The moment Ye Qingtang left, the elder from the outer sect’s Array Faction walked into the Elders’ Hall. He had heard everything Ye Qingtang said from a dark corner and was, similarly, shocked by Ye Qingtang’s wild act.

“Elder Qin, wasn’t Ye Qingtang a little too insane? Why didn’t you persuade her?” The outer sect elder frowned.

Elder Qin shook his head helplessly. “I did persuade her, but you saw the results as well. Ye Qingtang is not like ordinary disciples. She has her own plans. Although this is insane, one cannot help but be expectant.”

Elder Qin watched Ye Qingtang’s fading back with an anticipating look.

“If Ye Qingtang really passes the inner sect assessment this year, many jaws would drop,” commented the outer sect elder.

Elder Qin nodded. “If she really has such an ability, I really have to pay attention to her.”

The two elders smiled at each other, but both thought that such a possibility was almost zero.
