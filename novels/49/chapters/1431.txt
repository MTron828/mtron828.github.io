“Aunt Qin, I’m alright. Since she is a child of the Jiang Family, I can bear anything for the Jiang Family.” Ye You behaved as though she made a compromise for the general interest.

It hurt Jiang Qin to see that Ye You looking like that.

“What Ye Qingtang! So what if she is a child of the Jiang Family? I want to see who dares to let you suffer injustice with me around.” Jiang Qin’s expression was extremely dark.

Her sister only left behind a child, and that was Ye You. How could she let Ye You suffer even the tiniest bit?

“You, rest well. I am here,” Jiang Qin said while patting Ye You’s hand.

Ye You frowned slightly. “Aunt Qin, I don’t wish to give you more trouble because of my personal matters. My mother died early, and I did not receive much motherly love. However, I am already very content with your care.”

Jiang Qin felt even more miserable at the mention of Ye You’s mother.

“Don’t worry about these anymore. Rest well.”

Ye You nodded obediently as she looked down to hide the snicker in her eyes.

Ye Qingtang, even if you enter the Jiang Family, you are still unable to defeat me.

Sooner or later, I will make you disappear from this world completely!

The Jiang Residence was extremely spacious and was even larger than the royal palace.

Jiang Liu was rather attentive to Ye Qingtang, the lost talent, and the room he prepared for her was so large that the huge Beidou Demon Lord could roll around and jump about.

However, Ye Qingtang did not care much about that.

The Heavenly Demon Bloodline had been in her body for a long time, but she could not master it completely.

Meanwhile, the Jiang Family was the most familiar with the Heavenly Demon Bloodline, and Ye Qingtang could obtain more cultivation techniques suited for the Heavenly Demon Bloodline.

There was truly a heap load of benefits.

Ye Qingtang just reached her room, and Elder Xu and Jiang Liu ordered people to deliver generous amounts of elixirs and money.

“Tang Tang, you can rest here first. Once the Domain Monarch is out of seclusion, he will personally take a look at the condition of your bloodline and then decide on the suitable cultivation techniques,” Elder Xu said with a smile.

He thought that Ye Qingtang, who had been wandering outside, must not have learned the orthodox Heavenly Demon cultivation techniques. If she merely possessed an ordinary Heavenly Demon Bloodline, he could bring her to the Martial Pavilion to select some foundational cultivation techniques to practice like Ye You back then.

However, Ye Qingtang had the rare Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, and they could not make a decision for the moment.

“Thank you, Elder Xu.”

Elder Xu smiled. “Just familiarize yourself with the Jiang Family slowly. We will carefully investigate to find out your biological parents. If they are still alive, perhaps we can let your family unite.”

The First Mainland was sealed away back then, and they could not enter. Only a few special people entered there by coincidence.

It should not be a tough investigation.

Ye Qingtang nodded, reckoning that the parents whom Elder Xu find out eventually would probably the parents of that lady in green.

However, that lady in green escaped after her bloodline was stolen, and it was unknown if she was devoured by Little You Yun along with other living beings in the First Mainland.

Once Elder Xu left, Ye Qingtang sat down to regulate her breathing. Everything that happened today was beyond her expectations. She took out the voice transmission stone instinctively, hesitated for a moment, and did not turn it on.

Ling Yan most likely plotted all of this when he told her to head to Burnt City.

So that she could enter the Jiang Family using the Heavenly Demon Bloodline.

“I really… owe you another one.”
