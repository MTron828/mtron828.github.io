Chapter 2037: Return (1)

Ye Qingtang knew perfectly well that the Ancient You Clan wouldn’t have let a single one of them off regardless of whether their fragments were real or not.

A thought hit her suddenly.

“The Holy Lord of Shadows had a fragment of the Spirit of Chaos which she brought with her when she left. I’ve searched the entire temple but have yet to find it. Do you think it was real or fake...” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ling Yan laughed and said, “The Ancient Clan that the Holy Lord of Shadows took the fragment from had already fallen a long time ago. What do you think?”

She stayed silent.

Since the Ancient Clan used to exchange the fragments for favors, an Ancient Clan that was on the decline would already have given it up a long time ago...

Even though the Spirit of Chaos was extremely powerful, there was no use holding on to just its fragments. To some of the Ancient Clans, the prosperity of their clan was more important than the useless fragments...

“So that means that the Crimson League has a good chance of recasting the Spirit of Chaos?” Ye Qingtang’s was feeling extremely conflicted right now...

She had agreed so readily to help the Crimson League obtain all the fragments in the first place as she had thought that the Holy Lord of Shadows had taken a piece with her. If that was so, there was no way to recast the Spirit of Chaos.

But now...

That might not be the case.

“Miss Ye, you don’t have to worry about this. Aren’t you completely uninterested in the Spirit of Chaos?” Ling Yan said reassuringly.

After another thought, Ye Qingtang agreed that she harbored no interest in the Spirit of Chaos at all. Her only goal was to rescue little You Yun and free the lives of everyone in the First Mainland.

A wave of relief washed over her as she thought of this. She flew down with Ling Yan and placed the lamp back where it was.

But she had to admit that the way the Holy Lord of Shadows had hidden the vessel within the altar was ingenious. No one would know it was there if they didn’t know where to look.

However...

How did Ling Yan know about it?

She looked at him with a strange expression.

He sensed her gaze and his smile widened.

“Holy Lord.”

She was extremely confused. Why was he suddenly calling her the Holy Lord?

“The day has turned to night... Holy Lord, if you have needs, we can return to your room...”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What was he saying?

Could he speak properly for once!

She was still in a state of confusion when out of the corner of her eye, she spotted Lady Ghost with a group of patrolling Undead Clan soldiers.

They were looking ambiguously at both of them.

She suddenly realized that they were in a corner, with Ling Yan standing on the inside. From Lady Ghost’s point of view, it looked like Ye Qingtang had forced Ling Yan into the corner...

Along with what he had just said...

Her reputation was completely tarnished!

“That’s enough!” she said harshly as their whispers reached her years. Not allowing him to speak any further, she quickly dragged him away.

Who knew what words might come out of his mouth if they continued staying there!

Lady Ghost watched as Ye Qingtang brought her ‘male pet’ back into her room, with an ambiguous smile on her face. Feeling Lady Ghost’s knowing gaze on her, Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but quicken her pace.

Would someone deal with this rascal for her!
