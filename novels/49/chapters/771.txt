Chapter 772 Peerless School (1)

After the incidents with Li Jingwen and Liu Mo, Ye Qingtang’s reputation soared among the Admirable Sky Peak disciples.

Everyone called “Senior Brother Ye” resoundingly.

Because of Ye Qingtang’s actions, many Admirable Sky Peak disciples were heavily influenced. Although they closely obeyed Perfected Xuanchen’s orders to not stir up troubles, they no longer swallowed their anger in silence like before.

They struck when they had to.

The change in the Admirable Sky Peak disciples fell into Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

A few days ago, she just received news from Master Du.

When she went to the Bliss Forging Workshop the other time, she had already left a message for Master Du that she was willing to collaborate with him on the Dragon Vein. Currently, Master Du had already made all the preparations and asked to meet Ye Qingtang tomorrow morning. Then, they would head to the Dragon Vein.

Ye Qingtang made some preparations. However, when she walked around Falling Sky Valley in the afternoon, she faintly sensed that there was something wrong with the atmosphere in Falling Sky Valley.

“Junior Brother Ye.” Yin Qingluo saw Ye Qingtang from afar and walked over immediately.

“Senior Sister Yin, did anything happen in the valley?” Ye Qingtang questioned.

Yin Qingluo took a look at Ye Qingtang and sighed subsequently. “The Peerless School people are here.”

“Peerless School.” Ye Qingtang’s eyes darkened.

The Peerless School was a top force in Nine Nights Dynasty, and even super forces like Tiangang Sect and Falling Sky Valley were beneath the Peerless School.

The Peerless School possessed the most powerful figures in Nine Nights Dynasty, and their might was not what Falling Sky Valley could compare to.

“Junior Brother Ye, you just entered they valley and may not be clear about the Peerless School. The Peerless School is in charge of various forces in Nine Nights Dynasty, and even our Falling Sky Valley has to offer tributes to them regularly.” There was helplessness in Yin Qingluo’s tone.

The power and influence of the Peerless School were not what ordinary people could match up with.

The tributes they wanted was an enormous sum, and it was extremely difficult for even a force like Falling Sky Valley to pool sufficient tributes.

The old Valley Master of Falling Sky Valley refused to offer tributes to the Peerless School because the tributes they wanted were too enormous.

However, after that, the old Valley Master was severely injured in an accident.

Although this seemed to be unrelated to the Peerless School, anyone with discerning eyes was clearly aware that the Peerless School people were the only ones in Nine Nights Dynasty who could injure the old Valley Master.

“The Peerless School asked for something big this time. I’m afraid Master will be troubled again.” Yin Qingluo sighed.

Just as they were talking, a row of people suddenly entered Falling Sky Valley’s square with a crowd surrounding them.

There were two young men in long gowns who looked at most over twenty yet wore haughty expressions.

Many Falling Sky Valley’s wardens and disciples followed beside those two people.

“We were unaware that the Peerless School’s envoys would be here today. Please pardon us for not receiving you all earlier,” Xiong Feng said politely as he followed the two Peerless School disciples. As a Falling Sky Valley warden, his face was, however, piled with smiles of flattery.

“Do we still have to let your Falling Sky Valley know when we’re coming?” A Peerless School disciple swept a glance at Xiong Feng coldly.

A layer of cold sweat covered Xiong Feng’s forehead immediately.

The other wardens hurriedly spoke up. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

There were many Falling Sky Valley disciples near the square. Once they saw the two young men from the Peerless School, respect filled their eyes as they kept a distance away quietly.
