Chapter 70: The Birthday Banquet (7)

Mu Su made a generous offer because he was well aware that even without a spirit root, Xuan Ling’s Clan would still be forced to accept ye Qingtang, given His Highness’ personality.

Once Mu Su suggested that, the people were baffled again.

What happened to His Lordship?

Why is he so gracious towards Ye Qingtang?

Not only did he come all the way here to meet her, he had even acceded to her request that bordered on absurdity. Now, he even offered to escort her personally just to have her spirit root examined! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Everyone knew of Mu Su’s distinguished status and many of his acquaintances were certainly not the average person.

At this moment, many green-eyed gazes landed on Ye Qingtang, especially from those younger personages amongst the guests who would kill to fill her shoes.

Just being able to get Mu Su’s referral would have been a Godsend.

The Great Elder’s face clouded over. He had never expected Ye Qingtang to turn her life around.

And Ye Xun, who was already shocked by the sight of Ye Qingtang’s new spirit root, became totally flabbergasted when Mu Su agreed to her request for the referral as well. Now, a feeling of unease stirred in her gut as she instinctively turned to face Duan Tianrao standing beside her.

What she saw was his knitted brow and blazing eyes, transfixed on Ye Qingtang amongst the crowd.

“Duan-lang….”

While in a daze, Duan Tianrao turned his gaze towards the nervous Ye Xun, and he asked with a frown: “Xun-er, didn’t you claim that Ye Qingtang’s spirit root was shattered?”

Ye Xun shrugged stiffly, “It’s true…. But I’ve no idea how she managed to grow one again….”

Duan Tianrao’s brows remained knitted even after hearing Ye Xun’s explanation and his eyes no longer displayed the affection he once held towards her.

Duan Tianrao initially insisted on calling off his engagement with Ye Qingtang because of the rumors of her hideous appearance and the loss of her spirit root that would impede any future progress in her cultivation.

However….

All those rumors turned out to be falsehoods right before his eyes.

Ye Qingtang was not hideous at all. Instead, she was a beauty queen and she had somehow gained a new spirit root in place of her shattered one.

It was at this moment that Duan Tianrao began resenting Ye Xun, for she was the one who seemed to have tricked him into believing those rumors.

“Duan-lang….” Ye Xun could only utter his name nervously again when his displeasure became apparent.

But Duan Tanrao turned his back on her and left her side without another word. Though he remained in the hall, it was obvious he did not wish to associate with her again.

Ye Xun became alarmed.

At the other side, Ye Qingtang pondered over Mu Su’s offer. Since the re-emergence of a spirit root was a mystery that she had never come across, she would welcome any advice from anyone who might be knowledgeable in this field.

However….

A subtle gleam could be seen from her eyes. She had yet to get the show on the road, staying behind would be inevitable.

“Many thanks for your kind support and consideration, my Lord. But as the young lady of the house, it is my duty to attend to the rest of our guests for the night. So, may I suggest leaving at a later time? That is of course, if you do not mind?” Ye Qingtang asked politely.

Mu Su would never make things difficult for her. Just gaining her acceptance would be enough to fulfill his objective.
