Lin Long’s sudden speech shocked Zhou Xuan, who was waiting for the drama to ensue. He stood up and spoke in a tone different from the arrogant one he was using when talking to Ye Qingtang. “Junior Sister Lin is right. It is time for us to set off now as well. The other teams have already left. If we continue being like this here, we would really waste time.”

Zhou Xuan spoke so righteously, but little did anyone know that everything that happened before was all part of his plan.

The only thing that surprised him was that Lin Long, who had always been cold and aloof, suddenly spoke up for Ye Qingtang.

Lin Long looked at Zhou Xuan coldly and then turned around to walk down the Path to Heaven.

With Lin Long’s warning, the other disciples did not dare to waste any more time then and walked down the Path to Heaven after giving Ye Qingtang an annoyed look.

Zhou Xuan walked slightly slower. After the three of them were a distance away, he walked past Ye Qingtang and said in a volume that only the two of them could hear,

“Ye Qingtang, I remember your ‘kindness’ for treating my younger brother, Zhou Qu, that way previously.”

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes, and her lips tugged up into a seeming smile. “So… that good-for-nothing Zhou Qu is actually Senior Brother Zhou’s younger brother…”

Once he heard the words “good-for-nothing,” Zhou Xuan’s face darkened immediately. He glared at Ye Qingtang with fury in his eyes.

“Good-for-nothing? You are a red spirit root trash. What right do you have to call others ‘good-for-nothing?’”

Ye Qingtang’s smile deepened. She tilted her head as she casually glanced down at the sword hung on Zhou Xuan’s waist. “What a pity… your younger brother can’t even crawl up after being beaten by me, a red spirit root.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“You!” Zhou Xuan’s expression changed.

Ye Qingtang suddenly looked up, and her clear eyes directly met with Zhou Xuan’s. “He is clearly a disciple who cultivated for many years in the Fist Faction but had to lay in bed for days after being beaten by me, a new disciple who just entered the sect for a few days. Senior Brother Zhou, in your opinion… how would I dare to snatch the title of being a ‘good-for-nothing’ from your younger brother?”

Zhou Xuan’s face turned blue. He originally thought that Ye Qingtang would not dare to be too insolent after he established an imposing air for himself. Yet… it was as though this woman’s mouth was full of poison, and every sentence she said hit him right in the heart!

“Ye Qingtang, the days ahead are long. Don’t say that I didn’t remind you. There are many dangers in sect missions. You better take good care of yourself.” Zhou Xuan left her a sentence coldly and walked down the Path to Heaven, unwilling to waste time talking to Ye Qingtang who had the gift of gab.

Ye Qingtang looked at Zhou Xuan’s back view with a seeming smile and looked down to hide the murderous expression which emerged in her eyes for a second.

Take good care of yourself?

Only that… the one who needed to take good care themselves was not her but Zhou Xuan…

A murderous smile hung on her lips as she walked down the Path to Heaven casually.

How could a devil from hell be offended by an ordinary person as he pleased?

…

At the same time, after Ye Qingtang just left, Qin Huan remembered what Ye Qingtang entrusted him with and prepared a plate full of beef as an “offering” to the wolf which Ye Qingtang babied.

However…

Once Qin Huan walked into Ye Qingtang’s room, he was immediately dumbfounded to see an empty room. There was not a trace of the wolf.

“Where… where is the wolf?!!”

In a moment, Qin Huan felt as though the sky was going to fall.

Ye Qingtang just left, but the silver wolf disappeared already?!

If Ye Qingtang returned after finishing her mission, wouldn’t he…
