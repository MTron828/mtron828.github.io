Chapter 348: A Starving Camel Is Still Bigger Than A Horse (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No matter how badly the Blood Moon Sect Elder wished to not see Ye Qingtang again, he had already entered the inner sect then, and there was nowhere he could hide even if he wanted to.

Since he just entered the inner sect, his allocated area of residence was coincidentally right next to Ye Qingtang’s, and the distance between the two yards was at most a few steps only.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder stood outside his own courtyard and looked at Ye Qingtang, who was standing a few steps away from him, with an utterly dark expression as though he had just swallowed a fly.

Forget about sneaking off to absorb an inner sect disciple’s essence, even where he went on usual days was going to be tightly watched by Ye Qingtang…

Before the Blood Moon Sect Elder was done grumbling, Ye Qingtang invited herself into the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s yard.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was allocated a sword boy and an attendant girl. Those two kids were not old and appeared to be about the same age as Fei Ying and Ni Shang. Those two children still had a rather muddleheaded look in their eyes. Noticing that Ye Qingtang entered, they naturally identified her as an inner sect disciple as well and served her carefully.

With a dark expression, the Blood Moon Sect Elder sat at a table and threw a dissatisfied look at Ye Qingtang.

“I’ve already entered the inner sect according to your request. Are you satisfied now?”

Ye Qingtang chuckled. Looking at the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s ugly expression, she was unhurried and calm, though she glanced at the two kids that were occupied with work outside the house.

“The sword boys and attendant girls in the inner sect have good natural endowments, but you better behave and not think of anything. If you ever do anything, the sect will not just drop the matter, and I will not let you off easily,” Ye Qingtang said straightforwardly. The outer sect disciples could already pique the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s interest, and if it was in the inner sect where there was plenty of elites, the Blood Moon Sect Elder would probably be dizzy just by looking at them.

Guilt crept into the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s heart. He did eye the two kids here previously, but never did he expect that this thought was crushed by Ye Qingtang the moment he conceived it.

“Obviously, I know that without you telling me.” Even though he was seen through, he still denied in a serious manner.

Ye Qingtang glimpsed at the Blood Moon Sect Elder, and her lips curled into a smile. She slowly took out a bottle of elixir from her space ring and placed it before the Blood Moon Sect Elder. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Take this.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder took a look at the bottle, and a disdainful smile broke out on his face.

Throwing him a bone?

Was Ye Qingtang not treating him too much of a joke?

Even though his skills were not as powerful as before, these elixirs in sects were nothing to him.

Ye Qingtang saw the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s contemptuous expression and chuckled. “This is the Source of the Marrow Pill.”

When the Blood Moon Sect Elder heard the words ‘Source of the Marrow Pill,’ astonishment flashed across his eyes, and the look of belittlement on his face vanished into thin air.

His reaction fell into Ye Qingtang’s eyes, and her eyes smiled even deeper.

The Source of the Marrow Pill was different from ordinary elixirs used to nourish the spirit root. It mainly nourished one’s state of mind and recovered the lost vitality.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang did not have a spirit root, and her focus was naturally shifted to elixirs which recuperated other forces.

Spirit root was no longer of any use to the Blood Moon Sect Elder after resurrecting. What he needed was something which could nourish his vitality.

“Why do you have the Source of the Marrow Pill?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder secretly concealed his surprise and asked in a feigned casual tone.
