Chapter 1147: You Are Thinking Too Much (2)

If the Blood Moon Elder’s new body was also in the Heavenly Venerate realm, then perhaps he could really do as he said. If his body possessed the same power as a Heavenly Venerate, he could just use the brute strength of his powerful body and bludgeon the golden-robed man to death. Unfortunately, Ye Qingtang had yet to detect a Heavenly Venerate’s power in the Blood Moon Elder’s body. They could only depend on this body’s brute strength to crush the golden-robed man to death if they captured him. But Blood Moon Elder had already missed the opportunity to capture the golden-robed man. As long as the golden-robed man was not an idiot, he would certainly not give Blood Moon Elder another chance.

Thud!

The mountain peak ahead suddenly exploded, and an after-image of golden light flashed across the void.

The golden-robed old man was floating in mid-air, looking at Blood Moon Elder sinisterly.

“Elder Yin Fo… you… have indeed betrayed the You Clan… do you know what happens to those who betray the You Clan.” The golden-robed man glared at Blood Moon Elder and said coldly.

“Hahaha!”

When he heard the golden-robed old man’s words, Blood Moon Elder laughed coldly. He said arrogantly, “Since when have I betrayed the You Clan… It’s just that I can’t stand the sight of you. I feel that I am much more powerful than you… You should give your position as General of the Ancient You Clan to me instead… How about this, I’ll kill you today and take your place as General of the Ancient You Clan. What do you think?”

When he heard Blood Moon Elder’s words, the golden-robed man’s expression became rather puzzled.

At first, the golden-robed man had felt that it did not make sense for Elder Yin Fo to suddenly betray him.

Logically, it was improbable that Elder Yin Fo would betray the Ancient You Clan, and he had no reason to become a traitor.

But… the golden-robed man felt it was more likely that Elder Yin Fo was merely ambitious and wanted to become the general because he disliked him.

“So you are competing with me for the generalship.” The golden-robed man laughed coldly.

“Why, am I not powerful enough to take your place as general? I think there should be no problem. Are your fists as big as mine?” Blood Moon Elder waved his right arm, and an iron-hard fist, as big as a small mountain, waved in front of the golden-robed man.

Swoosh!

Without any warning, the Blood Moon Elder suddenly grabbed at the golden-robed man.

However, the golden-robed man was prepared. His body flickered, and he immediately dodged. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The golden-robed man was aware of the terrifying strength that Elder Yin Fo’s body possessed. Even he would suffer disastrous consequences if Elder Yin Fo caught him in his hands.

“Elder Yin Fo, you have a death wish.”

The golden-robed man dodged Blood Moon Elder’s blow and stood proudly in the void.

“Hahahaha, little one, we are in different realms. Also, my body is much more powerful than yours. On what basis do you oppose me?!” The Blood Moon Elder laughed loudly and uncontrollably.

When he heard the Blood Moon Elder’s words, the golden-robed man said blandly, “In this mainland, all realms are the same… however, the ultimate source of strength in one’s body can be of different qualities.”

As the golden-robed man finished speaking, a wild wind started to blow within the void. Ripples started to appear, accompanied by the suffocating power of a Heavenly Venerate.

When he felt the force of a Heavenly Venerate, the Blood Moon Elder’s expression immediately changed. It was as if his body was being crushed by the Heavenly Mountain that had fallen from the Ninth Heaven.

Boom!

The earth under Blood Moon Elder’s feet instantly shattered, and his upright body was forced to bend under the oppressive power of a Heavenly Venerate.
