Chapter 2294: A Gamble (1)

Wen Qi frowned slightly. In the eyes of the Netherworld Academy, Ye Qing’s actions were indeed not appropriate. But… Wen Qi thought about the youth’s deep understanding of martial arts and found it a right pity.

“Ye Qing, do you understand where you have gone wrong?” Wen Qi sighed.

“No.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Di Nuo’s face completely darkened at Ye Qing’s unrepentant words.

“No? Then let me tell you. A piece of trash like you has no right to lead students. The Vice-President was just too kind to have placed you inside our academy. You became so arrogant that you took such a major risk with the lives of your students…”

Before Di Nuo could finish his words, Ye Qing shot him a cold look.

His face was devoid of expression but somehow, Di Nuo was completely stunned by that look.

“No right?” Ye Qing stared coldly at Di Nuo before turning toward Wen Qi.

“Vice-President, let me ask you first. What is the reason for the Netherworld Academy to bring students out for training?”

Wen Qi replied, “To let students gain experience of the outside world, to polish their skills and advance their powers.”

Ye Qing nodded.

“So if one can achieve the same results, what should it matter what kind of teacher brings them out?”

Wen Qi was slightly taken aback.

A bark of laughter ripped out of Di Nuo’s lips and his next words were full of mockery.

“Ye Qing, you still have no idea where you went wrong? So what if you managed to bring them back safely? Going out for training is not like going on a sightseeing tour. You brought them out for over two months. Students enroll in the academy to become stronger and not to mess around like you. You brought them out for a jaunt for over two months, do you know how much this will delay their progress?”

Without giving Ye Qing a chance to respond, Di Nuo turned to Wen Qi. “Vice-President, Lei Yan, and the others are safe but we cannot just let Ye Qing off because of that. Using training as an excuse, he lured those students out to fool around. This is a blemish on the reputation of the Netherworld Academy.”

Di Nuo knew that Lei Yan and the others were safe. The moment news of Ye Qing’s return reached his ears, he already knew Mu Ziying and her group had also returned in one piece with Ye Qing.

But so what?

Every single student brought out for external training by the academy had always returned with improved skills.

“Ye Qing, you said that all is fine as long as the results are the same. You are over-simplifying things. Vice-President also said that external training is to increase the power of the students. And did you manage to achieve that?” Di Nuo smirked.

He did not believe that a piece of trash like Ye Qing was able to take his students to a place good enough to train, let alone guide and protect them.

It was probably just a slightly dangerous place. A person like Ye Qing would not dare to enter otherwise. He probably just found a place with peaceful mountains and clear rivers and messed around there for two months.

It was clear Di Nuo had no intention of letting Ye Qing off. Accusation upon accusation was forced on his head.

Meanwhile, Ye Qing stared coldly at the blustering Di Nuo. Without emotion, he spoke up calmly.

“So according to what Teacher Di Nuo just said, if Lei Yan and the rest improved over these two months, then the matter of me bringing them out for training will be considered settled?”

Di Nuo smirked. “If you have that capability, then things will naturally be settled.”

Ye Qing was just a Paragon Sixth Heaven level. How much could Lei Yan and the rest improve in just two mere two months?

Di Nuo completely disregarded the fool’s words.
