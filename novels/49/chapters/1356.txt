Chapter 1357 So Weak 2

General Qiao did not know what was going on. A huge force had suddenly sent him flying. The impact of the force was greater than anything he had encountered before.

Su Liner and the General’s wife immediately turned their attention to General Qiao and did not notice anything strange about Ye Qingtang.

“What’s going on?” A handsome man suddenly entered from another room. When he saw the chaos in the main hall, he could not help but show his curiosity. Then, his gaze fell on Ye Qingtang, who was standing nearby, and he immediately looked disdainful.

When the General’s wife saw the youth, she immediately said, “Kai’er, you’re here just in time. Su Qiao has gone crazy again.”

The youth’s name was Dongfang Kai, and he was the nephew of the General’s wife. Because the Dongfang Family lived near the General’s residence, they often dropped by.

Dong Fangkai frowned slightly, and his expression grew more contemptuous as he looked at Ye Qingtang. Ever since the General’s wife had married and moved to the General’s residence, the relationship between the Dongfang Family and General Qiao had grown even more intimate.

General Qiao was a military officer. Although his surname was Su, he was conferred the title of General Qiao, so his eldest daughter was named Su Qiao to thank His Majesty for his kindness.

The Dongfang Family, on the other hand, specialized in magic. They often refined health-giving elixirs for the Emperor, and the Emperor thought highly of them.

Dongfang Kai disliked this cousin, who was not a blood relative. Now, when he heard what the General’s wife said, he did not waste words but walked over to Ye Qingtang. He wanted to reach out and grab this helpless and crazy cousin to drag her away.

But the moment Dongfang Kai reached out his hand, Ye Qingtang raised her foot and kicked him such that he fell to the ground.

Dongfang Kai was fairly skilled. When the General’s wife had married and moved into the General’s residence, he had also trained with General Qiao from a young age and was skilled in martial arts. Among his peers, his skills were considered exceptional.

However, Su Qiao was a good-for-nothing who could not even practice martial arts. Naturally, Dongfang Kai was not on his guard.

This kick broke several of Dongfang Kai’s ribs. He fell heavily to the ground with a grunt, blood seeping from his mouth.

Ye Qingtang was speechless when she saw Dongfang Kai lying on the ground, vomiting blood.

She had not even used much force, but he was vomiting blood?

Surely it was obvious that he was asking for it?

“Kai’er?” The General’s wife was startled. She not had expected Ye Qingtang to fight back.

Even General Qiao was shocked by the events unfolding before his eyes, not to mention his wife.

How has Qiao’er suddenly learned to fight so viciously?

General Qiao had been obsessed with martial arts all his life and had some experience. Ye Qingtang’s casual kick had shocked General Qiao. Such force and speed could not be achieved without thirty to fifty years of cultivation.

But the General’s wife, who did not know much about martial arts, was not aware of this. Her face grew grim when she saw that this crazy Ye Qingtang had hit her nephew.

“Su Qiao, how dare you hit someone!” The General’s wife had also been disdainful of Su Qiao. Now, she walked over to Ye Qingtang furiously and raised her hand to slap Ye Qingtang in the face.

But…

Before the General’s wife could slap Ye Qingtang, the latter had given her a resounding smack instead.

The General’s wife instantly spun like a top. The force of the blow caused her to spin several rounds before she stumbled and fell onto the ground.
