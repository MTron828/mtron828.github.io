Chapter 1271: Unable to Enjoy (3)

Although Ye Qingtang did not care for looks, her face could be considered to be the standard of great beauty among humans.

Why did it become hideous when Ming Gu spoke about it?

“Ah Yao, will you change back? You’re clearly so beautiful.” With a sincere look, Ming Gu specially took out a scroll and opened it before Ye Qingtang.

The scroll revealed a drawing of a gray skeleton frame. While it was donned in an elegant dress and had a golden crown on its head, it was remarkably similar to a skeleton.

“Ah Yao, look how beautiful you were last time? You were the top beauty of our Skeleton Tribe back then. But look at you now… Why must you do this to yourself…” An expression of despair was etched all over Ming Gu’s face as though Ye Qingtang’s look on the Holy Lord of Shadows was the biggest humiliation.

“…” Ye Qingtang was silent.

The Undead Clan’s taste was mostly similar to any other species.

In the eyes of the Skeleton Tribe, the skeleton form was naturally the most beautiful.

In their eyes, the slender skeleton frame and pitch-black eye sockets were deemed as beautiful.

In contrast, a whole body of skin that covered the skeleton frame was nothing but hideous.

Thus…

Had she always been too hideous to look to the Undead Clan?

Ye Qingtang felt that she was about to turn numb from the verbal attack.

“Ah Yao, we are in the temple now anyways. Will you return to your original look?” Ming Gu tried his best to persuade Ye Qingtang to return to being the “most beautiful woman of the Skeleton Tribe”.

Ye Qingtang smiled lovingly but did not reply.

She could not do it…

She finally saw that while Ming Gu was fully convinced of her identity, this posed a huge problem as well.

It was exactly because he trusted her so much that he treated her with the rules of the Undead Clan, causing Ye Qingtang, a human, to have an “eye-opener”.

Ming Gu still planned to persuade Ye Qingtang to be herself, but Xue Fu suddenly came over and said that Ming Wang was looking for him.

Upon hearing that, Ming Gu could only look at Ye Qingtang reluctantly and leave very unwillingly.

After leaving the sleeping chamber, Ming Gu spoke to Xue Fu. “Xue Fu, bring those flower pots of mine to Ah Yao later. Ah Yao loves them the most.”

A gasp of laughter escaped Xue Fu’s lips as he looked at Ming Gu, who prioritized Ye Qingtang for everything.

“You raised those flowers for thousands of years. You must have been waiting for this moment, right?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ming Gu nodded his head and said, “Before Ah Yao left back then, I accidentally broke a few flower pots, and I thought of growing better ones to compensate her. This wait turned out to be thousands of years.”

Xue Fu shook his head in laughter and subsequently sent those few flower pots that Ming Gu mentioned to Ye Qingtang’s sleeping chambers.

Ye Qingtang immediately plunged into deep thought as she looked at the few pots of “flowers” that Xue Fu sent in.

In those flower pots, the “flower” stalks bent their alluring bodies of which bloody skulls were hanging from.

Skull Flower.

Using a fresh human skull as the foundation, the newly-sprouted blood vine was then to be buried into the skull. Once the blood vine grew, it would be nourished with the flesh and grow gradually.

“Ming Gu knows that you love the Skull Flower the most and has raised these few pots of flowers for thousands of years. He hopes that you like it,” Xue Fu said with a smile.

Like it…

I really love it to “death”!!

Whoever it be, hurry up and get me out of this Temple of Shadows!

Who the hell wants to have bloody skulls that wobble nonstop staring at themselves when they are sleeping?!

How exquisite are the tastes of the Holy Lord of Shadows exactly!!
