Chapter 1467 Wild 3

Elder Meng stepped forward and said, “That’s right. It’s Mo Yi who violated the rules first today, so we came to reason with her. Who knew that she did not repent and was even more insolent and started attacking us? We never thought of hurting the two of them and were only acting according to the family rules.”

The Jiang Family’s hall of discipline was initially managed by Jiang Kai, and the management rights were handed to Elder Meng only after Jiang Kai left the headquarters.

Elder Meng understood Jiang Kai very well and knew that he hated people who violated the family rules the most; thus, he made use of that point.

Furthermore, the departure of Jiang Lang and his wife from the house had already caused Jiang Kai’s dissatisfaction. If not for the Domain Monarch choosing not to pursue this matter, Jiang Kai would already have caught the two of them back to the Jiang Family to punish them according to the family rules.

As expected, Jiang Kai’s expression darkened increasingly.

“People,” Jiang Kai said suddenly.

“Send the three of them to jail. Jiang Lang, it’s time for someone to teach you about the rules. I will not probe about your actions outside, but in the Jiang Family…” Jiang Kai squinted.

Then, the group of guards that came with Jiang Kai moved forward. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Jiang Lang immediately led his men and stood in front of Ye Qingtang and Mo Yi.

“Jiang Lang, what are you doing?” Jiang Kai had a displeased expression.

“Don’t think of touching my wife and daughter.” Jiang Lang scoffed.

“Bastard!” Jiang Kai was infuriated.

“If you don’t abide by the rules, do you believe that I will break your leg?”

Jiang Lang chuckled but did not move an inch.

Jiang Qin and the rest snickered secretly when they saw the situation before them.

The only fault was that Jiang Lang and the rest acted too arrogantly, and they landed in Jiang Kai’s hands now. Jiang Kai disliked this couple from the start and all the more would not let them off so easily today.

“What’s going on? Such anger…” A lazy voice was suddenly heard.

A lady with grey hair and a youthful complexion walked into the courtyard slowly with a wine gourd hanging on her waist. Although her hair was white, she was dressed in an alluring manner, and her gorgeous features made her look at most around thirty years old.

However, this lady was about the same age as Jiang Kai. She was the younger sister of the Domain Monarch and Jiang Kai, Jiang Xun.

Jiang Xun frowned uncontrollably at the sight of Jiang Xun.

Jiang Qin and the others initially had a pleased expression but were also in a daze when they saw Jiang Xun.

“Aunt…” Jiang Lang, who was exuding a murderous air, called Jiang Xun at this instant, however.

“Brat, you finally know to come back already? I doted on you for so many years for nothing. You really should be beaten for leaving just like that.” Jiang Xun shot Jiang Lang a look. She seemed to be dissatisfied from her tone, but there was no reproach in her words.

Jiang Lang opened his mouth but did not say anything.

Jiang Xun scanned the surroundings and subsequently spoke to those guards. “You all are becoming bolder. How dare you touch your master? Are you all tired of living?”

A cold glint flashed across Jiang Xun’s eyes when she spoke.

Those guards felt a cold shudder when contacted by Jiang Xun’s cold gaze and retreated instinctively.

Jiang Kai frowned slightly. “Why are you all retreating? Catch the three of them.”

The guards looked at Jiang Xun hesitantly.

Yet, Jiang Xun chuckled. “Let me see who dares to move.”

The guards broke down internally.

There were two senior members here, and one said to catch while the other said to not. What should they do?

“Third sister, enough. You spoiled Jiang Lang all these years, and look at what he has become! If he dares to attack his siblings now, won’t he cause huge chaos in the future!” Jiang Kai looked at Jiang Xun with a disgruntled expression.
