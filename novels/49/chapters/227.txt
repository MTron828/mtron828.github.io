The night breeze which had a faint grass smell blew into the cliff.

Wu Zheng stood behind Ye Qingtang silently. His narrowed eyes reflected the image of the tiny girl under the moonlight.

She was so thin and tiny. Standing at a dangerous spot, she seemed as if she would fall into the deep abyss with just a light push.

Wu Zheng raised his hand slowly and quietly stretched out towards Ye Qingtang’s back. Right when his fingers touched Ye Qingtang’s clothes, he suddenly closed his fingers and violently pulled Ye Qingtang by her clothes backward!

“Lord Ye, the wind is strong at night. This place is too dangerous,” said Wu Zheng after pulling Ye Qingtang a few steps back.

Ye Qingtang looked at the good-looking young man before her, and a strange expression appeared in her eyes for a moment. But very quickly, she returned to her normal state and smiled. “Thank you. I saw a cracked stone tablet at the bottom of the cliff. Is there someone buried there?”

Wu Zheng’s eyes dilated a little, but when he looked up, his eyes returned to their original calmness.

“Foster father had once said that Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was called Juling because this place is rich in spirit energy and full of vitality. It is rumored that thousands of years ago, a demon wreaked havoc and was eliminated by a few mighty figures. Its corpse was then buried in this mountain so it would never be able to escape, as the spirits would suppress its soul. That stone tablet was left behind by the mighty figures who slayed the demon thousands of years ago, though there are many cracks on it now, and the words on it cannot be seen clearly.”

“A demon wreaked havoc…” Ye Qingtang looked down and glanced at the broken tablet.

Although most of the inscriptions had faded due to the harsh weather, the image of a beast could still be faintly seen on the broken part. However, the cracks were severe, and one could not tell what beast that was exactly.

“It is already dark. Lord Ye, you should return…” Wu Zheng suddenly said.

Ye Qingtang smiled and nodded without saying anything and then followed Wu Zheng out of the cliff.

After Ye Qingtang and Wu Zheng left, a pair of ghastly eyes suddenly opened in a hidden cave near the cliff…

Wu Zheng left after walking Ye Qingtang back to the pavilion. When Ye Qingtang climbed to the second floor, she happened to meet the Apothecary, who was going down.

Upon seeing Ye Qingtang, the Apothecary immediately lowered his head respectfully.

“Lord Ye.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang looked at the basin of water in his hands and smiled. “I’ll have to trouble you to take care of my senior brothers and senior sister. Thank you.”

“Don’t mention it. They were infected with the Blood Plague because of Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, and it is only right of me to take care of them. How can this be called troubling me? Lord Ye, you are too polite,” the Apothecary said humbly.

Ye Qingtang smiled and took a glance at the Apothecary’s hands from the corner of her eyes. A smile suddenly appeared in her eyes, and she turned around and walked up without saying anything further.

The Apothecary carried the basin of water down the stairs. After pouring the water outside the door, he turned around to look at the empty pavilion. Then, the hunchbacked man slowly walked along the roads and entered a small, plain-looking house.

In the house, Wu Zheng was sitting at a table without any emotions. His head was hung low, seeming to be in deep thought. When he heard the door opened, he looked up slightly and then looked down again after seeing that it was the Apothecary.

The Apothecary wiped his hands with his back facing Wu Zheng. For a moment, the room was unusually silent.

However, after a moment of silence, the Apothecary suddenly asked, “What has Lord Ye been busy with at night?”
