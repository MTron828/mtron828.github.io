Chapter 1190: Battle (1)

The powerful cultivators of the Ancient You Clan were caught off guard and were pulverized by the Blood Moon Elder’s mountain-like fists.

“Mercy for those who surrender. Death to those who resist!”

The twelve Peak Masters of Falling Sky Valley, hundreds of Ye Family disciples, everyone from the Si Family, and the branch masters of the Ye Family all suddenly appeared on the Blood Moon Elder and immediately leaped onto the wall.

An intense battle between the two sides swiftly commenced without warning.

At that moment, White Tiger also appeared on Blood Moon Elder’s shoulder. Leading Ye Qingtang, it leaped onto Heaven City’s city walls in a single motion.

Lightning curses and the gleam of swords instantly filled the entire area.

Half of the dozens of powerful cultivators from the Ancient You Clan who were patrolling the walls of Heaven City were killed before they even knew what hit them. Some of them recovered their wits but were smashed by the Blood Moon Elder’s fists before they could fight back.

However, after a moment, increasing numbers of Ancient You Clan cultivators became alarmed. They immediately hurried to the city walls.

At that moment, the old man, who was the overall commander of this troop from the Ancient You Clan, was enraged when he saw that Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Elder, and the others had sprung a surprise attack on Heaven City. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

They had already sustained heavy losses from forcibly occupying Heaven City. Now they had to face a formidable enemy, and they were momentarily caught off guard.

Actually, Heaven City’s terrain was hazardous. It was easy to defend but difficult to attack. It should have been extremely difficult for anyone to try to invade the city after they had occupied it!

However, the old man had overlooked Elder Yin Fo, who had betrayed the Ancient You Clan and gone over to this mainland!

Elder Yin Fo’s body was so huge that the advantages of Heaven City’s precipitous terrain, including the fact that no one could fly over it, were all lost. So what if no one could fly over Heaven City or that the terrain was hazardous? All Elder Yin Fo had to do was straighten up, and he was taller than Heaven City!

“Kill! Kill all these ants from this mainland!!”

The old man looked extremely grim as he issued death orders to the powerful cultivators of the Ancient You Clan, who hurried over in an unending stream.

“Humph!”

At that moment, an old man struck one of the Falling Sky Valley’s twelve peak masters in the abdomen.

The Master of Horizon Peak, who was dressed in a white cotton robe, spat out blood. Then, he swiftly struck with his knife.

The old man was caught off-guard. He was injured by the knife aura and backed away.

At that moment, more and more powerful cultivators arrived. The Master of Horizon Peak was isolated and helpless, caught in a death trap.

“Roar!”

At that moment, a bellow of rage rang through the entire area.

White Tiger leaped down from the wall. Its sharp teeth instantly pierced the old man’s neck.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang moved her arms slightly and caught the injured Master of Horizon Peak.

“General…”

When the Master of Horizon Peak saw Ye Qingtang, he gritted his teeth. He was momentarily lost for words.

“Promise me you won’t die.” Ye Qingtang glanced at the Master of Horizon Peak and said softly.

“All of us must survive.” Without giving the Master of Horizon Peak an opportunity to reply, Ye Qingtang threw him into the camp in Falling Sky Valley. Together with little white tiger, she charged towards the Ancient You Clan.

“Kill! Don’t leave a single one alive!!”

The Master of Horizon Peak clenched his fists as he looked at Ye Qingtang’s disappearing figure and roared with rage.

For four weeks, the clash of blades rang continually and the sound of agonized moans could be heard everywhere. It was as if Heaven City was transformed into hell.
