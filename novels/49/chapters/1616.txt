Chapter 1617: Kingdom Protector (2)

The commander of the reinforcements spoke very softly so that only he and the King could hear.

The King’s expression changed.

But before the King could take his next move, there was an uproar within the fortress.

A group of prisoners of war from the allied forces suddenly escaped from the fortress prison and were in a battle with the Supreme League Kingdom soldiers in the fortress.

The King’s expression darkened immediately, and he ordered people to suppress them.

There were only about a hundred prisoners of war, and they were subdued very quickly and were brought to the King.

Under intense interrogation, the prisoners of war who escaped finally revealed the truth.

The allied forces planted spies in the kingdom’s fortress and prepared to release all of them from the fortress prison when the 500,000 soldiers attacked, so as to coordinate a pincer attack and annihilate the entire Supreme League Kingdom.

These prisoners of war kneeling before the King were the first group of people who were released.

“Spies.” The King’s expression darkened to the extreme. Without any warning, he unsheathed the sword hung on the waist of the commander of reinforcements and chopped off the head of a prisoner.

“Send my orders down. Kill all the prisoners of war in the fortress.” There was no emotion in the King’s voice, but what he said sent chills down everyone’s spine.

After such a long war, there were thousands of prisoners of war from the allied forces, and they were all locked in the kingdom’s fortress.

It was a rule of this mainland to not kill any prisoners of war during a war.

“Your Majesty, less than one percent of those prisoners of war know about this information. Many of them are innocent...” A high-ranking military officer said as he could not bear to see such a sight. However, before he could finish his sentence, the sword in the King’s hand slashed the officer’s neck.

Blood spouted everywhere like a fountain, and the military officers who still wanted to persuade the King immediately kept their mouths shut.

Their King was never a compassionate ruler.

He was a true cold-blooded Emperor who resorted to any means in order to achieve his goal, and all lives were insignificant to him.

Just like his ambition to annex the entire mainland.

No one dared to question the King’s orders anymore. Large groups of soldiers surged into the prison, and in no time, piercing shrieks echoed in the air.

The smell of blood emanated from the prison, and it was so strong that it was nauseating.

The cries of thousands of prisoners of war did not result in any sympathy nor remorse on the King’s face. He simply tossed the sword to the commander of the reinforcements and turned to look at Ye Qingtang. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Tang, follow me to the hall.”

Ye Qingtang was emotionless as she looked at the King who killed thousands of people with just an order. Then, she moved her legs and headed to the main hall with the commander of the reinforcements.

As the King looked at Ye Qingtang in the hall, a smile suddenly appeared on his gloomy face.

“Kingdom Protector, I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”

The King did not care about the deaths of thousands of people and was more concerned about the Kingdom Protector!

Among the various kingdoms, a powerful protector would always appear at a certain timing. It was said that those protectors were guided by the gods to protect the balance among the kingdoms. They possessed extraordinary abilities and were collectively called the Kingdom Protector.
