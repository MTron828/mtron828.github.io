Chapter 1040 It’s You (3)

There were not many Xuanling Sect disciples remaining currently. Although the water and food Ye Qingtang brought from the Ye Family was not considered a lot, it was still sufficient to solve the crisis.

Long before she headed to Xuanling Sect, she had already realized this issue; thus, she prepared some supplies in a separate space ring.

After all, the past Ye Qingtang was also a Xuanling Sect disciple, and she had some understanding of Xuanling Sect. It had been almost half a year since Xuanling Sect was trapped by Yunxiao Sect, and the stored supplies in the sect were probably already depleted.

Elder Mo had complicated feelings as he looked at Ye Qingtang. He would never have thought that his disciple actually became a supreme Yang Lord of this mainland in less than six months…

Even if he told others this, probably no one would believe that he was the Master of a Yang Lord…

Xuanling Sect Sect Master was extremely startled to see Ye Qingtang. Even a strong force like Yunxiao Sect was as weak as an ant before a Yang Lord.

Ye Qingtang sighed softly as she looked at the current dilapidated Xuanling Sect. Apart from food and water, she also took out numerous elixirs from her space ring to distribute out to everyone.

These elixirs could temper the body and be extremely beneficial even to an ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lord. If cultivators at the Martial Qi stage consumed it, the effects would be multiplied.

After consuming the supplies that Ye Qingtang brought, their complexion was way better than before, and after consuming her elixirs, they were full of vigor in at most an hour.

“It’s truly a magic pill… My body did not have any energy before, but now, even if a fierce tiger came… I feel that I can kill it with one punch…” Qin Huan commented excitedly.

“Master, Sect Master, let the disciples recuperate first; then, rebuild Xuanling Sect later on,” Ye Qingtang said after a long time.

Xuanling Sect Master nodded. This was what he hoped for the most. Even in his dreams, he wished to rebuild Xuanling Sect.

“Qingtang… can you… prevent Yunxiao Sect from attacking Xuanling Sect during Xuanling Sect’s reconstruction?” Xuanling Sect Master looked at Ye Qingtang and asked in an almost pleading tone.

Ye Qingtang was currently a Yang Lord, and as long as she was willing, Xuanling Sect could be rebuilt easily, and only Ye Qingtang was able to stop Yunxiao Sect.

“What are you saying, Sect Master? A Xuanling Sect disciple for a day is a Xuanling Sect disciple for life,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Xuanling Sect Master was a little agitated after hearing Ye Qingtang. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ye Qingtang immediately took out some items which she obtained from the mystic realm and handed them all to the Sect Master.

Apart from the numerous weapons and elixirs, there were also talismans that could help with the reconstruction of Xuanling Sect.

“Master, Sect Master, don’t worry about YunXiao Sect. Now that I’m back, I will definitely destroy and obliterate all traces of Yunxiao Sect.” Ye Qingtang looked at Elder Mo and Xuanling Sect Master and said.

“Alright…”

Elder Mo nodded. His disciple was now a Yang Lord, and annihilating YunXiao Sect could be easily done.

“Qingtang, Xuanling Sect is fortunate to have you.” Xuanling Sect Master looked at Ye Qingtang and said.
