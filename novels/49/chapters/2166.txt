Chapter 2167: Ten Moves (2)

“Teacher Ye, do you really think that you can teach me?” Qin Feng spoke with a monotonous voice that served to remind Ye Qingtang of the difference between them.

Ye Qingtang was far from him in terms of capabilities, how could she become his teacher?

“Qin Feng, you’re too much,” Nangong Lie commented appeasingly.

But Qin Feng wasn’t affected at all.

After all, as the genius of the Qin family, the Netherworld Academy previously had high hopes for him. He received guidance from elite teachers and even the President of the martial arts faculty personally guided him along for an extended period of time,

Qin Feng was already ahead of all teachers of other faculties in terms of martial arts.

“A teacher’s main responsibility is to guide the student along,” Ye Qingtang said.

Qin Feng didn’t bother with her.

“Teacher Ye, I don’t intend to listen to your preaching. You don’t need to waste any time on me. You just need to focus on teaching them.” Qin Feng was already somewhat annoyed, judging from his expression.

This brat is pretty stubborn.

Ye Qingtang looked at Qin Feng and she wasn’t angry at all. Qin Feng could definitely afford to be haughty, but now, he’s at his wits’ end.

“If you don’t want to stay, sure–” Ye Qingtang said before Qin Feng was about to leave.

“If you can defeat Lei Yan using only ten moves, you don’t need to come anymore.”

Everyone was dumbstruck by Ye Qingtang’s words.

Qin Feng was baffled as he looked at Ye Qingtang before his gaze riveted on the one who lost to him, Lei Yan.

Lei Yan: “...”

Boss, why must you do this to me?!

Ten moves!

What a joke.

He was at Paragon Sixth Heaven level while Qin Feng was two levels higher than him. Don’t even

mention ten moves.

Qin Feng could use just one move to win.

“Boss...” Lei Yan was about to burst into tears. When did he offend Boss, why did he do this to him?

“Okay.” Qin Feng agreed and walked towards Lei Yan.

Clearly frightened, Lei Yan immediately took two steps back, looking at Qin Feng with a horrified look on his face.

Don’t come over!

“It’s not time yet,” Ye Qingtang suddenly said.

Qin Feng paused, furrowing his brows. He had no more patience for this teacher anymore. Did it look like he had ample time to waste?

“You’ll challenge Lei Yan in ten days. You’ll win if you can subdue him within ten moves,” Ye Qingtang said.

Qin Feng’s brows knitted. He glanced at Ye Qingtang and without saying a word, he turned around to leave.

Lei Yan heaved a sigh of relief.

That was a close shave!

Yun Chen witnessed the entire scene and he glanced at Ye Qingtang with a complicated look. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

This was a fight that was impossible to win.

After all, the disparity between Lei Yan and Qin Feng’s power was huge. One move was all it takes to determine who would win.

“Brother, I have high hopes for you. You have to get past ten moves.” Nangong Lie gloated happily while patting Lei Yan’s shoulder.

Pushing away Nangong Lie’s hand irritably, Lei Yan and around to look at Ye Qingtang aggrievedly.

“Boss, I-I can’t hold in anymore...”

Though it was embarrassing, he had to admit that he was no match for Qin Feng.

Ye Qingtang looked at Lei Yan’s aggrieved face and smiled. “I’ll give you a boot camp from today onwards.”

If in ten days Lei Yan still couldn’t take ten moves from Qin Feng, there would be no way she could stay in the Netherworld Academy.
