Chapter 515 Doubts (1)

She discovered that on the ancient walls, there was a male with an unclear appearance standing in the sky with millions of Blood Moon Sect members bowing below him.

That person… should be the Blood Moon Sect Holy Lord… It’s a pity I can’t see his face clearly, Ye Qingtang thought in her heart.

She had heard about legends regarding the Blood Moon Holy Lord. Yet, after all, they were not from the same generation, and she never had the fate to see his true appearance.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord had a mysterious background. No one knew where he came from, and nor was anyone clear of how long he had lived for.

It was said that when the martial culture just burgeoned on this mainland, it was ruled by a brutal dynasty.

Afterward, the Blood Moon Holy Lord came to this land and founded the Blood Moon Sect himself, wiping out that dynasty with a destructive force.

Afterward, the martial culture on this mainland welcomed a peak while the Blood Moon Sect was all the more supported by everyone.

Yet, something happened afterward, and the Blood Moon Sect became the first evil sect and was eventually annihilated by the combined forces of the powerful sects on the entire mainland. Presently, the times of the Blood Moon Sect’s rule had passed, and the dynasties and generation had changed. Hundreds of sects contended for power, welcoming the era of the sects that persisted to this day. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

As Ye Qingtang was in deep thought, the heavy-sounding steps outside the hall pulled Ye Qingtang back into reality. Very quickly, an elderly whose hair and mustache were white walked into the main hall. Apart from Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll, there were a few other creatures with an imposing martial aura following behind the elderly.

One of them was completely wrapped in the blood-colored long robe. Not an inch of his skin was exposed, and only a pair of frighteningly-ghastly eyes could be seen.

There was another girl who seemed to be rather young. Her entire body was crystal clear and exuded an inexplicable demonic air.

The others appeared to be middle-aged and either had swords or knives in their hands.

The martial aura of these people was as deep and immeasurable as oceans, and it resembled that of Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll.

Ye Qingtang thought that these people were probably the Branch Masters of this division.

The Branch Masters stood on two sides and did not say anything.

A long while later, the elderly in the lead spoke to Ye Qingtang with cupped fists. “I heard from two Branch Masters that the Guardian has arrived…”

The Blood Moon Elder could not help but worry as he saw that the Division Head did not believe fully.

“Haha… If it truly is the arrival of a Guardian, it is the honor of my division… However…” The elderly laughed coldly as he stared at the blood-colored crescent on Ye Qingtang’s glabella. “Oh? You’re doubting me.” A glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“I don’t dare to. I’m not doubting you. I just wish to ascertain your identity… After all, the lesson from a thousand years ago is still vividly in our minds. Guardian does not wish for us to believe others easily.” The elderly smiled.

“Alright,” Ye Qingtang said and nodded. “How do you intend to prove my identity?”

“Guardian, your blood-colored crescent and Blood Moon Aura are indeed solely possessed by Guardians… However, some sects once used a special method to forge the Blood Moon Aura a thousand years ago… And because of this method, they infiltrated and hid in our Blood Moon Sect.” The elderly sneered.

An inauspicious feeling arose within Ye Qingtang, though she continued listening to the elderly without saying anything. “Afterward, the Sect Master obtained the Demonic Water and placed it in every division. As long as non-Blood Moon Sect members came into contact with the Demonic Water, the forged Blood Moon Aura on their bodies would disappear immediately…” The elderly scanned Ye Qingtang quietly.
