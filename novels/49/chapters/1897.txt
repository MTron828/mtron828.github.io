Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai immediately headed to the Jiang family residence. They wanted to report on everything they had seen at Taiyuan Valley.

But...

When Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai arrived, they were completely thunderstruck by the scene that greeted them.

The formerly grand and magnificent Jiang family residence was now a wreck. Bodies of several Jiang family guards were strewn outside the main gates of the residence.

A deep sense of foreboding rose in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

Could it be...

Even the Jiang family?

A buzzing sound hounded Ye Qingtang’s ears as images of Mo Yi and Jiang Lang surfaced in her mind’s eye. Before Jiang Shaobai could say a word, Ye Qingtang dashed into the Jiang family residence.

It was a bloodbath within the compound. Blood was splattered everywhere as corpses covered nearly every inch of the ground. Ye Qingtang quickly scanned through all the bodies, terrified that she might recognize a familiar face.

Jiang Shaobai followed her in. His face turned completely pallid at the sight. The pair decided to split up to see what they could find in the compound.

As Ye Qingtang hurried over to Jiang Lang and Mo Yi’s lodgings, the eerie quietness seemed to pervade all her senses.

Ye Qingtang subconsciously slowed down her steps. She swallowed the unease rising in her throat.

Jiang Lang and Mo Yi were not her biological parents but their care and protection made Ye Qingtang feel like they were her real family.

They were like Ye Ling, who had raised her in Lin Town.

Jiang Lang and Mo Yi’s courtyard was empty. Just as Ye Qingtang was about to enter the rooms she heard a blood-curdling scream.

“Shaobai!” Ye Qingtang’s heart leaped at that familiar voice. She was about to run toward the source of the scream when a bloodied figure suddenly leaped across the walls.

In the next second, the person fell heavily right in front of Ye Qingtang. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The person was bleeding profusely.

Jiang Shaobai, who had been perfectly fine just minutes ago, was now in dire straits. There was a deep wound on his head from which bright red blood kept pouring out. The rest of his body was covered with burn marks, such that not a clear inch of his originally-smooth skin could be seen.

“Run...” Jiang Shaobai glanced up at Ye Qingtang before he drew up the last of his strength to gasp out his final word. He then collapsed onto the ground, eyes closing for the last time.

“Sh*t, someone’s after him. I can feel that person’s aura... it’s powerful beyond belief.” Little White Tiger could instinctively feel that danger was approaching fast.

Within seconds, Little White Tiger morphed into its larger form.

“We have to go.”

Little White Tiger’s instincts told it that they would perish here if they lingered on and were caught up by their pursuer.

Ye Qingtang didn’t hesitate. Scooping up Jiang Shaobai from the floor, she jumped onto the white tiger’s back.

Little White Tiger White leaped out of the courtyard and fled as fast as it could.

Just as they left, a figure landed on the spot formerly occupied by the pair. The ground of the courtyard cracked open the moment the figure touched the floor.

“Oh? The rats have scurried away?” A low voice with a hint of amusement echoed through the deadly silence of the courtyard.
