Chapter 2262: Treasure Trove (3)

A faint light flashed across the eyes of the Night Soul Beast when it noticed their reactions. It quietly went past an artifact slightly protruding out, and secretly pulled at it.

Clack, clack, clack…

A pile of gold pieces scattered to the ground, revealing the handle of a sharp sword.

That sword handle suddenly gleamed, and Ye Qingtang’s attention was immediately drawn to it.

“Is that the… Netherworld Sword?” Qin Feng was also focused on the sword now. His usually-steady gaze was filled with an intense shock.

The Netherworld Sword was a genuine divine-level weapon. The Qin family was very proficient with swords. At that time, Qin Zhuo had led the Qin family to their peak with a sword in hand. So Qin Feng was exceptionally knowledgeable about swords.

For a divine-level weapon like the Netherworld Sword, he had only seen it in some ancient records. He never imagined that he would get the chance to see it in person.

It should be pointed out that even the most useless practitioner would be able to ascend to elite levels with a divine weapon in hand.

No one in this world would say no to a divine-level weapon…

Qin Feng was mesmerized by the sight of it.

The Night Soul Beast glanced at Qin Feng, as if not at all surprised by his reaction. However, it was more concerned about Ye Qingtang’s reaction.

The Night Soul Beast looked at Ye Qingtang, only to see her still standing in her original spot. She just glanced at the Netherworld Sword before looking away, not tempted at all.

The Night Soul Beast: “…”

It took two more steps and casually picked up another divine-level artifact, revealing it to Ye Qingtang.

Yun Chen and the others gasped. Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang just gave it a mild glance, not exhibiting any particular reaction.

By now, the Night Soul Beast looked rather confused. It wanted to try again but saw that Ye Qingtang was now staring at it as it tried to pull out another divine weapon…

The Night Soul Beast: “…”

Ye Qingtang gave a faint smile.

The Night Soul Beast shuddered all over.

“No one is allowed to touch anything here.”

Mu Ziying and the others were all shocked by Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Boss?” Lei Yan was befuddled.

There were so many formidable treasures here. But they couldn’t even touch a single one?

Where was the logic in that?

“Don’t touch anything if you don’t wish to die.” Ye Qing stated in a cold voice.

The teenagers were all startled by the sudden chilliness in his tone. Faced with such a massive temptation, it was undeniably a major challenge to human nature.

Schoolmates who just got to know each other, or even biological brothers might end up killing each other over such tempting treasures.

But now…

Lei Yan and the others did not understand. But they obediently went over to Ye Qing’s side, still casting longing glances at the treasures.

Ye Qing’s words reminded them of what kind of place this truly was.

This was the fiendcelestial’s tomb. Without Ye Qing, they would never make it out of here alive. Ye Qing understood this tomb better than any of them, so they instinctively trusted every single one of his decisions.

The Night Soul Beast was astounded. Previously, it saw that those teenagers were already all prepared to make their move. Why did they suddenly stop?

Did they really not want these treasures?

Impossible.

The Night Soul Beast felt very dismal, and Ye Qingtang clearly noticed its reaction.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com
