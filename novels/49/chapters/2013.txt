Chapter 2014: The Demon Clan Disaster (2)

“I will consider it. Please do not be too worried and inform me if there are any new changes.” There was no way Ye Qingtang wouldn’t care about her brother but she felt that something was strange with the way the Ancient You Clan was suddenly invading.

The Crimson League had already turned against the Ancient You Clan. How could they possibly have the spare time and effort to destroy the demon tribes right now?

The Northstar Demon Lord nodded and retreated.

Ye Qingtang felt that something was terribly off with this situation and contacted You Qiong in secret, asking him about the situation.

“I’ve heard of this as well but I’m not sure why the Ancient You Clan has decided to do this. But I can confirm that the demons were all instructed directly by the Ancient You Clan to do this...” he said.

Ye Qingtang frowned.

So it really was on the Ancient You Clan’s orders?

You Qiong seemed to suddenly remember something and said, “Holy Lord, I have some information regarding the demon tribes. Do you need this information?”

“Speak.”

“When I had just returned to the Ancient You Clan, I was in the valley a lot and it was where they trained the youths at the start. Apart from them, I also saw many demon cubs locked up as well as... a few skins.”

“Skins? What skins were they?” she asked.

“They were the skins of several demon cubs. The flesh within it had been hollowed out, leaving behind only the skin. I thought it was strange and tried to keep a look out but didn’t see them doing anything to the demon cubs. However, after two days, the demon cubs were suddenly greatly reduced. I’m not sure what happened but realized that... many of them vanished after being brought to the Ancient You Clan and many skins would be thrown out the next day...” You Qiong quickly spilled all that he had secretly observed.

Cubs and skins... as well as this sudden invasion?

She could feel in her heart that there was some ploy behind this sudden invasion. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

She immediately asked Lady Ghost to investigate the invasion of the demon tribes after the rise of the Ancient You Clan.

Lady Ghost investigated swiftly and quickly handed the information over to Ye Qingtang.

The information shocked her.

Half a year before the rise of the Ancient You Clan, many cubs were vanishing mysteriously from the various demon habitats. Demon cubs caught and being sold on the black market also started to become in short supply.

As soon as a demon cub appeared on the black market, it would quickly be bought by a mysterious figure...

More demon cubs had been vanishing with the rise of the Ancient You Clan, but with the chaos that had been going on in the Central Mainland, everyone’s attention had been focused on the Ancient Clans instead.

No one had noticed what was happening on the side of the demons.

Ye Qingtang felt that she had grasped something important.

The things that the Ancient You Clan were so desperately chasing...

Were all items that could make them stronger. She suddenly thought of the youths that they had trained.
