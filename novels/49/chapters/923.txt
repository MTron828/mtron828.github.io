Chapter 924 Faced With Beauty (5)

“You’re toying with me… If I don’t mince you up today, my name is not Ye Qingtang!” Ye Qingtang’s slashed out with her sword, but Ling Yan’s figure floated backward. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Of course your name is not Ye Qingtang. After you marry me, you will take my surname… of course, I can also take your surname.” Ling Yan laughed.

Ye Qingtang was rendered speechless. Before she could make her next move, the void exploded.

Large amounts of dense fog rolled in, obscuring Ye Qingtang’s vision. With that, Ling Yan’s figure also vanished slowly.

When Ye Qingtang came back to her senses, she was standing next to a stream in a valley.

“This…”

Ye Qingtang’s expression was one of shock. The stream in front of her was so familiar.

What had just happened?

Ye Qingtang vaguely felt that she had just experienced something, but she drew a blank after careful thought.

All she could remember was the Divine Phoenix telling them that the next stage was lust…

Her memory was frozen at the moment when the Divine Phoenix had last spoken.

Ye Qingtang had no memory of what had happened after that.

Ye Qingtang immediately studied her surroundings. All the powerful people present were in a daze. They stood motionless at their original spots as if they had been asleep.

Only Yin Yang Child was frowning and looking around him, and he seemed to be more normal.

“You are the second trialist to have resisted temptation,” a scarlet image in the void said to Ye Qingtang.

“Resisted temptation?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She had no recount of what had just happened.

With that, Ye Qingtang thought of something. “Second? Then the first is…”

Ye Qingtang instinctively looked at Yin Yang Child.

“Do you need to ask? Of course, it’s me.” Yin Yang Child laughed coldly.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little. Yin Yang Child was at most thirteen or fourteen… what use was the so-called temptation by beauty to him?

Ye Qingtang could not understand what Yin Yang Child had to be proud of.

If he was not the first to emerge, that would be truly preposterous.

However, Ye Qingtang sank into deep thought.

She was the second person to resist temptation. This meant the so-called temptation by beauty was either by gorgeous women or handsome men.

Ye Qingtang did not know what degree of temptation the Divine Phoenix had used at this stage. She did not have any memories.

To Ye Qingtang, being faced with beauty was no great difficulty.

With her many experiences in her past life, she had already learned to look beyond beauty that was skin-deep.

She had never been worried about this test.

“Your luck is pretty good.”

While Ye Qingtang was thinking, the Divine Phoenix spoke suddenly.

“My luck is pretty good?” Ye Qingtang was taken back. “What does Lord Divine Phoenix

mean?”

“You almost succumbed,” the Divine Phoenix said.

“…” Ye Qingtang widened her eyes in disbelief.

She had almost succumbed?!

Impossible!

What kind of handsome man could cause her to almost succumb?!

Ye Qingtang had been pretty confident of her self-control, but the Divine Phoenix’s words caused doubt to arise in her heart.

Was there someone on earth who could use his good looks to sway her?

“In that case, Lord Divine Phoenix, who was it who almost caused me to succumb?” Ye Qingtang’s expression was one of curiosity. She really wanted to know what kind of handsome man had caused her heart to waver.

“How would I know who he is?” the Divine Phoenix said blandly.
