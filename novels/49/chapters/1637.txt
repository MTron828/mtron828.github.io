Chapter 1638: Exposed

Luck could also be considered as a part of skill, but Ye Qingtang’s abilities were really negligible. She helped them today, and they decided to pay her back by teaching her some cultivation techniques. Based on their abilities, a few tips would be more than enough for her.

Ye Qingtang smiled as the rest offered to teach her some cultivation skills.

She excused herself by saying that she had something on and left the place.

There were only four months to the Martial Arts Championship. The Taiyuan Valley would select the best twenty descendants half a month before and send them to the Martial Arts Championship.

Everyone in the Taiyuan Valley would try their best to cultivate and improve for the next four months in order to get selected.

After she fought against Jiang Yiran the other day, the boys including Jiang Yisheng were better to her, just that they always wanted to drag her to the Martial Art Hall to guide her. Ye Qingtang felt hopeless, but she could not refuse their offers.

Though Ye Qingtang’s cultivation level increased, she was not very familiar with the different techniques. Their invitation helped her familiarize herself with the techniques of the Jiang Family.

After several months, Ye Qingtang finally met Jiang Shaobai again.

Jiang Shaobai had been training with Elders outside for a period of time, but no one knew how the cultivation was like.

Jiang Yisheng and the rest were terrified when they heard the news that Jiang Shaobai was coming back.

“Errr... Qingtang, we still have something on. We shall leave first...” Jiang Yisheng’s face was pale when he heard that Jiang Shaobai was coming back. He immediately found an excuse and left.

If Jiang Shaobai knew about how he secretly tried to provoke Jiang Yanyun and lost...

Jiang Yisheng could imagine the pain... RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The other boys also felt awkward. They found different excuses and escaped. The items that were supposed to be given to Jiang Shaobai were passed to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang felt speechless as she stared at them running away from her. She then headed towards Jiang Shaobai’s room.

When she arrived outside Jiang Shaobai’s room, her room was not shut. She gently pushed open the door.

When she entered the room, she could see a shadow behind the screen. Ye Qingtang walked over as she assumed that it was Jiang Shaobai.

However, Ye Qingtang stoned when she saw Jiang Shaobai.

Jiang Shaobai was much skinnier after several months of cultivation. Her tiny face appeared even smaller now. She was drying her hair with a towel. Her body was pale and slim, and water droplets could still be seen on her body.

However...

Ye Qingtang was stunned when she saw Jiang Shaobai only wearing a pair of pants.

Though Jiang Shaobai was young, her breasts... were really flat...

“Sister Qing.” Jiang Shaobai smiled the moment she saw Ye Qingtang, but her voice felt more like a young man.

“...”

Wait.

Ye Qingtang felt that something was wrong.

Though... flat breasts were not abnormal, based on Jiang Shaobai’s age... she should not be that...

“Sister Qing, I’m totally exposed...” Jiang Shaobai suddenly blushed and immediately put on a shirt. She then covered her breast and said, “Don’t laugh at me, Sister Qing. I just grow slower than others.”
