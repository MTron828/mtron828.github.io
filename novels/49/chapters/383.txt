Chapter 384: Come Up Together (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Qingtang… you really dared to come.” When Song Junqiu caught sight of Ye Qingtang, his lips tugged into a sneer, and a cold glint flashed across his eyes.

Since she was courting death, naturally, he was not going to be polite.

Ye Qingtang’s arrival instantly attracted everyone’s attention.

“Ye Qingtang really dared to come for the challenge? Does she not want her life anymore?”

“This junior sister is really bold…”

Under everyone’s eyes, Ye Qingtang walked to stand in front of the four people with Ni Shang and Fei Ying following behind her. When Ni Shang’s eyes landed on the four of them, a suppressed hatred emerged in her eyes.

“Junior Sister Ye, you made us wait for quite some time,” said Song Junqiu with a smile, though his raised brows and laughing eyes were proof of the smugness and sarcasm he felt at that very moment.

“Sorry for making you all wait for a long time.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“It is about time. Do you still want to enter the Life and Death Ring, Junior Sister Ye?” Song Junqiu narrowed his eyes and spoke in a louder voice.

“Of course.” Ye Qingtang smiled faintly. Ni Shang tugged the hem of Ye Qingtang’s clothes worriedly, and Ye Qingtang slowly turned around. Pinching Ni Shang’s soft cheeks, she said softly, “Take a good look later.”

Ni Shang nodded nervously and finally released her grip.

After pacifying Ni Shang, Ye Qingtang took a leap and was the first to enter the Life and Death Ring!

“Which of us do you wish to challenge first?” Song Junqiu asked.

Her cold eyes glimpsed across the four people. Suddenly, her lips curled up, and she pointed in the direction of the four of them.

“There’s no need for sequence. You all can come up together.”

Everyone present was taken aback immediately.

What was Ye Qingtang saying?

She actually wanted to go against four people by herself at once?!

Was she insane!!

Ye Qingtang’s words stunned everyone.

They had seen people who did not want their lives anymore but not one who was so hurried to court death.

All four of them were at a higher level than she was, and she was probably not their opponent even in a one-to-one match, much less one-to-four.

She must really be tired of living!

Song Junqiu, similarly, had a surprised expression, but he returned to normal very quickly. “You wish to challenge the four of us at the same time?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied without hesitation.

Looking at Ye Qingtang’s behavior, a sarcastic look flashed across Song Junqiu’s eyes. He exchanged a look with the other three people and announced. “Since it is Junior Sister Ye’s request, we can only fulfill it.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Then, the four of them entered the ring.

Watching the five people on the Life and Death Ring, the onlooking disciples were instantly excited.

They originally thought that it was a match of which Ye Qingtang overestimated her abilities, but they did not expect it to actually develop to such a crazy state.

Not mentioning anything else, just Ye Qingtang’s request to challenge four people by herself at once caused many to gasp.

“Do you want to bet? How long can Ye Qingtang last on the ring?” Some disciples joked around.

“At most one-fifth the time that an incense stick takes to burn.”

“One-fifth? You really think highly of her. If it was one-to-one, perhaps she would be able to last that long, but now, she is dealing with all four of them!

Let’s not talk about the other three for now, but Song Junqiu himself is famous for his underhand attacks. Previously, I’ve already heard that Song Junqiu once caused trouble for Ye Qingtang, but she landed him into trouble instead, and he was almost boxed by Feng Moli. With this chance, do you think Song Junqiu would let Ye Qingtang off so easily?”
