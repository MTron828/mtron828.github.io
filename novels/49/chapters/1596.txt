Chapter 1597 Brutal Little Fellow 4

The guards were in a state of panic. It was at this moment that they realized that the first wave earlier on was just an appetizer from the allied forces and that this was the true battle.

General Mark’s expression turned uglier by the minute, and he immediately commanded the archers. “Continue to shoot! Aim straight at the five black witches!”

The archers pulled their bows with trembling fingers. All the arrows that were released were destroyed by the black magic of the black witches.

The ray of hope diminished bit by bit.

Laughter rang among the allied forces, and traveling through the air into General Mark’s ears, their laughter was laced with sarcasm and ridicule.

General Mark clenched his sword tightly as he looked at the soldiers who lost all morale. Suddenly, he flipped up onto his horse and was prepared to lead by example and charge toward the allied forces’ camp.

They could be defeated but could not be afraid!

Just as General Mark’s horse galloped for a few meters, a slender figure slowly passed by above him like a feather, and the galloping horse seemed to be placated by a certain force as it suddenly came to a stop.

“General Mark, do you want those five black witches?” Ye Qingtang gradually landed before General Mark as she gazed at the five black witches concealed among the Glorious Lion Knights troops from afar.

She vividly remembered that in the evening, she was still mistaken to be a black witch by the people here, so she thought that a black witch was a very powerful figure.

However...

Looking at that black screen, Ye Qingtang felt speechless for some reason.

“Tang? Hurry, step back. The black witch’s magic is very terrifying. You’re still young.” General Mark was a little regretful now. Had he known that there was such a frightening number of allied forces and that there were also the Glorious Lion Knights and black witches, he definitely would not pull this innocent girl into this battle.

While this girl was powerful, she was only one person. She was not the opponent of thousands of soldiers.

Ye Qingtang ignored General Mark’s shouts and slowly walked toward the allied forces’ camp. The howling gale lifted the edges of her robe, making her look extremely surreal.

“General Mark, please remain here.” Ye Qingtang’s voice traveled into General Mark’s ears along with the wind, and he was slightly taken aback.

“Tang! What are you doing? Come back quickly!” General Mark roared loudly. Those fearful guards could not help but widen their eyes in disbelief as they watched the petite girl walking toward the battlefield by herself fearlessly.

What were they fearful of?

Even such a young girl stood up so bravely, yet they were hiding behind like losers.

They could not be like this!

Fear gushed out of the guards almost instinctively. They did not wish to see a girl being forced to fight the war alone because of their cowardice!

Ye Qingtang was originally quite happy that both sides were a large distance apart; thus, she did not worry about accidentally hurting them. However, she realized that the guards began to charge over, and she had no choice but to move faster.

Isn’t it good to just stay there?!

Ye Qingtang was truly afraid that they would be locked in a battle, which would make it difficult for her to attack. Thus, she simply decided to increase her pace and eliminate the allied forces before her at once...

However, the moment Ye Qingtang was about to attack, the allied forces that initially encircled the guards from not far away actually retreated on a large scale for some reason.

The sudden retreat was truly unexpected.

What is going on?

Ye Qingtang halted slightly and observed the allied forces’ movement.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
