Chapter 1109 Two Little Monsters (2)

Ye Qingtang finally understood this time around.

This little fellow wanted to learn martial cultivation from her to protect her and Little You Yun.

As she saw the tiny Little Luo Xue’s “fearless” and “aspirational” manner, Ye Qingtang’s heart was about to melt.

“Alright. Let mother look at your natural gift.” Ye Qingtang grabbed Little Luo Xue’s hand, and a shocking force immediately enveloped Little Luo Xue in it.

“Spirit root…”

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed. Little Luo Xue was just born, but his body already possessed a spirit root at such a young age! After inspecting it closely, Ye Qingtang was even more stunned. This Little Luo Xue’s spirit root… was actually a purple spirit root…

It must be known that on this mainland, even a blue spirit root was as rare as a unicorn, much less a purple spirit root.

Ye Qingtang immediately inspected Little You

Yun.

As expected, Little You Yun also possessed a spirit root, and her spirit root was even more strange. It was actually pure white like a crystal clear bone; even Ye Qingtang could not tell its origin. However, Little You Yun’s spirit root clearly had an antique and ancient aura. After inspecting it for a while, Ye Qingtang’s body shivered uncontrollably.

Ye Qingtang was utterly speechless for a moment.

Out of the two little kids who were born less than one week ago, one had a superior purple spirit root while the other was even outrageous and possessed a pure white spirit root that Ye Qingtang had never seen before.

Perhaps, “monstrous talent” was insufficient to describe Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue.

Ye Qingtang immediately reorganized her thoughts and chuckled at Little Luo Xue. “Let… Mother teach you cultivation techniques then… However, it’s a little difficult and you must learn patiently.” As he heard Ye Qingtang, excitement etched all over Little Luo Xue’s face, and he nodded energetically.

Little You Yun also hurried over and had a diligent, studious look.

Ye Qingtang handed a set of cultivation techniques to Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue.

Initially, Ye Qingtang thought that Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue had never come into contact with cultivation techniques before and would require at least half a month to slightly comprehend the techniques.

Nonetheless, after a short hour, Ye Qingtang was completely astounded.“Martial Qi Level One, First Heaven…”

“Martial Qi Level Two, Third Heaven”

“Martial Qi Level Three, First Heaven!”

In just this short one hour, Little Luo Xue’s martial realm actually advanced from zero to Martial Qi Level Three…”

Under the pretext of an absence of any contact with martial cultivation, he used only one hour to comprehend cultivation techniques and even advanced from Connate to the Martial Qi Level Three realm. If Ye Qingtang did not witness this personally, she would never believe it… Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

At the same time, a frightening martial aura exploded around Little You Yun. Ye Qingtang looked over, and she was even more stunned.

Little Luo Xue merely advanced to Martial Qi Level Three realm while Little You Yun was even more straightforward and advanced all the way to half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm…

For an ordinary little kid, it would require at least one year and more to be familiar with cultivation techniques, much less advancing in martial realm. Ye Qingtang previously thought that Little You Yun was the energy source of the extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode while Little Luo Xue was the reincarnation of Divine King Luo Xue. Perhaps because they were the reincarnation of talents, she thought that they would already be amazing, monstrous talents if they could understand the techniques in half a month’s time.
