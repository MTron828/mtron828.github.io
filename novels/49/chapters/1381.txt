1382 A Qualified Quack 3

If Ye Qingtang was a fake Immortal, she would not be able to leave the Floating Island alive when she was exposed.

Everyone stared at Ye Qingtang and waited to see the consequence of offending the prestige of Immortals.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up into a smile when she saw the situation.

She had yet exposed these liars, yet the quack inside the jade door was trying to provoke her.

After all…

Ye Qingtang knew that the so-called Immortal in the Dragon Court Sect was just a quack.

They must value their positions since they were quacks. They would tolerate anyone who mimicked them to buy believers. Thus… they would try all possible ways to expose others who pretended to be Immortals.

Firstly, they could strengthen the dignity of the Dragon Court Sect.

Secondly…

They needed to prevent those copycats from exposing the deceptive ploys. The Dragon Court Sect might be challenged as a result.

Ye Qingtang was the next target of the Dragon Court Sect.

The invitation to the pilgrimage day was just a trap.

“Immortal Su, what do you think…” The Emperor of the Ye Qingtang did not dare to say anything in front of the Dragon Court Sect’s Immortal, but he also wished that Ye Qingtang could prove herself.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom and scoffed.

“Not interested.”

The Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom was stunned.

It was not a matter of interest now!

Ye Qingtang’s rejection was expected.

How could a fake immortal be able to showcase herself?

The Immortal inside the jade door also smiled.

“Emperor Yuan, what else do you need to say? The Immortal has given his order, but the quack beside you still dare to reject his order. He must be fake. How dare you to mess with the Immortal!” Emperor Qi shouted.

If the lady was a real Immortal, why would she need to refuse?

Other believers were on the same line as Emperor Qi.

The Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom was panicking. He was sure that Ye Qingtang was an immortal. However, she did not care about the situation at all. Some real trouble would occur if the situation worsened!

His concern soon came to reality.

“Emperor Yuan and the lady have pretended to be immortal and have offended the prestige of the Immortals. Come, take him down!” The Immortal in the jade door said coldly.

A group of the Dragon Court Sect’s envoys rushed in from the side. They were holding weapons and surrounded the Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom and Ye Qingtang.

The Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom was pale.

No matter what Emperor he was, nothing was comparable to the Dragon Court Sect.

Based on the Dragon Court Sect’s position, it would not even be a problem for them to kill an Emperor.

“Immortal Su… What are you waiting for? Do something. We’re in real trouble now,” the Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom said in fear, and he hid behind Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang looked up at the envoys who were about to surround them. Her eyes did not show any trace of emotion.

“You must face the consequences since you dare to pretend to be an immortal,” the Immortal behind the jade door said indifferently. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After he finished his words, the group of envoys rushed towards Ye Qingtang and the rest.

Though Long Qi and some other powerful figures came with the Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom, they did not dare to fight against the envoys of the Dragon Court Sect.
