Chapter 1690: Breakthrough (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“The top fighter of the Jiang family and that’s all you’ve got? What a joke...” Baili Xuanyun snorted as he gradually landed back on the ground.

Jiang Yiran and the rest hurried over to check on Jiang Yanyun’s injuries, only to discover that his chest was a bloody mess from the lightning strike.

When he saw the state of Jiang Yanyun’s injuries, Jiang Yiran’s eyes turned mottled red from fury. He spun around furiously, ready to fight Baili Xuanyun to the death.

But before Jiang Yiran could step forward, Jiang Yanyun held him back with much effort.

“You are not his match...”

Jiang Yiran froze.

Baili Xuanyun chuckled. “That’s right. Even Jiang Yanyun has failed. Who else from your Jiang family is able to step up?”

Elder Qian and the rest shut their eyes at the scene. They could feel an immense pressure on their chests.

Jiang Yanyun had failed. Not only that, he was gravely injured and would probably take months to recover. He would not be able to continue with the rest of the competition... it could be said that the Jiang family’s hopes of having two members enter the top ten were utterly destroyed now.

“Jiang Yanyun is a bit weaker. Baili improved tremendously over the past few years and it looks like he is primed to reach the Fifth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm.” Zhan Rao shook his head in resignation when he saw the results.

Jiang Yanyun’s powers were also that of an advanced Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm. But he was just below that of Baili Xuanyun’s.

The closer one was to the Fifth Heaven, the more powerful one was.

At this moment, another thunderous boom suddenly sounded out.

“What’s that?”

The crowd turned and saw a streak of golden light shooting down from the sky toward somewhere on the Island of Immortal Footsteps.

“What? Someone actually had a breakthrough at this moment?!”

Everyone was stunned by the appearance of that golden light. It was the sign of someone breaking through to the next level.

Who was it?

Who suddenly had a breakthrough at such a time?

Elder Qian was so worried about Jiang Yanyun’s defeat that he didn’t think too much about someone breaking through at this moment.

But Jiang Yisheng hurried over then. “Elder, Qingtang... Qingtang... she suddenly...”

“What?” Elder Qian was startled as his heart gave a violent thud.

Everyone was already gathered at the arena now. Ye Qingtang was the only person who had yet to appear. Could Ye Qingtang be the one... who had achieved the breakthrough?

Ye Qingtang was already at the Third Heaven level, if she had a breakthrough, it would mean... 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

She had attained the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm?

Elder Qian and Elder Kun exchanged looks. Simultaneously, they stood up and rushed toward the location of the golden light, leaving the rest of the elders to supervise the competition.

“Quickly! Ye Qingtang has suddenly broken through. We must protect her and not let anything go wrong with her breakthrough!” Elder Qian was speeding over, his heart full of anxiety.

Although Ye Qingtang had just broken through to the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm, she was still not good enough to fight for a spot on the top ten. But it was nonetheless a good thing for the Jiang family.

The elders had never expected that Ye Qingtang would suddenly have a breakthrough at such an important time. No wonder... they had not seen her all this while.

The two elders hurried over. Jiang Yisheng was still panting when he glanced at them, before quickly following behind.

No one else in the crowd knew who had achieved the breakthrough. Nevertheless, they could be bothered about it too much either. So no one noticed those two elders hurrying off towards the golden streak of light.
