Chapter 1984: Double-edged Sword (3)

A huge, dragon-like beast was circling in the sky. Three cicada wings sprouted from its back and its head was different from a dragon’s. It was more like a three-headed snake.

The beast hovered above the Temple of Shadows like an ominous raincloud, casting a huge shadow over the temple.

“What... is that?” asked a young man from the Ancient Clan. He had never seen such a creature before but chills ran down his spine as he looked at it.

“Is that... a Wind Snake?” an Ancient Clan Leader said as he frowned. But before he could continue, he was hit with a sense of foreboding.

“A Wind Snake shouldn’t be this big, and they only have a pair of wings...”

“That’s a mutant Wind Snake,” a loud voice suddenly rang out.

Everyone turned to look at the source of the voice. It came from Northstar Demon Lord who had walked out with the Jiang family. They were all looking at the huge creature in the sky.

“Mutant Wind Snake?” The Ancient Clan people were all confused. They had no idea that a Wind Snake could be a mutant.

Northstar Demon Lord continued, “I’ve only heard about it in legends as well. My mother mentioned it before, that the Wind Snake is already a rare creature within the Demon race, and only one out of a hundred thousand is mutant.”

Everyone froze when they heard this.

One out of a hundred thousand?

What kind of joke was this? There were only about a thousand Wind Snakes in the Central Mainland...

“It shouldn’t exist in the First Domain.” Northstar Demon Lord’s expression was dark. As a demon, he knew better than everyone else how terrifying Wind Snake was, let alone a mutant one...

“Do you think it’s from the Ancient You Clan...” The people panicked as they thought about that.

They all subconsciously wanted to seek shelter from the Undead Clan but all realized that Lady Ghost and the rest of them had a complicated expression on their faces as they looked at the mutant Wind Snake.

“The Crimson League?” Xue Fu asked Lady Ghost as he looked at the mutant Wind Snake in the sky.

Lady Ghost looked at the mutant Wind Snake and nodded. Their voices weren’t particularly loud but it was enough for the Ancient Clan people beside them to hear.

They all froze in surprise as they heard the words ‘Crimson League’.

Crimson League!...

What kind of joke was this!

What was the strongest alliance from the Second Domain doing in the Central Mainland?

They were reminded of how the powerful people of the Second Domain had invaded them long ago. Even though they were nothing special in the Second Domain, they had almost destroyed the entire Central Mainland.

This beast from the Crimson League was enough to crush all the powerful people sent from the Second Domain.

The same Crimson League that had unimaginable power in the Central Mainland.

Just as the people were discussing the Crimson League in surprise, the huge beast descended from the sky.

The three wings were only flapping gently yet stones flew in all directions on the ground. Huge stones were blown into the air and reduced to smithereens by the mutant Wind Snake’s powerful wings.

The powerful people of the Ancient Clan had to use their spirit energy to stabilize themselves so as not to be blown into the air.

As the mutant Wind Snake descended, three figures on its back came into view. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was three strange-looking people from an alien clan.

Their leader was in a black coat, his face not visible despite the bright sun. The only thing they could make out was a stream of black smoke emanating from his sleeves.
