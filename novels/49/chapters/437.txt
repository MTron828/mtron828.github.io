Chapter 438: Compensation (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

On the ring, Fu Lingtian’s brows were tightly furrowed. In a moment of desperation just now, he could only reveal his true abilities.

If Wind Moon Sect mediated the situation as they did originally, nothing much would happen, but that damn woman foiled it!

“Qingtang, how’s your condition?” Elder Mo looked at his in-name disciple.

“Master stepped in in time, and Fu Lingtian did not manage to harm me.” Ye Qingtang smiled. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

After hearing that, Elder Mo’s doting eyes were filled with relief. He indeed misjudged Ye Qingtang in Xuanling Sect, merely treating her as a disciple who had a gift in forging, yet unexpectedly… his in-name disciple was actually also a genius!

“Alright. I will definitely seek justice for you today,” Elder Mo said with a nod.

At that instant, the Wind Moon Sect elders were infuriated and demanded Qinglin Sect to give them additional compensation on top of repaying the wagers for the previous Three Sect Competitions.

Apart from Wind Moon Sect, Elder Mo and Elder Qin from Xuanling Sect similarly requested for compensation.

“Other than the wagers that my sect has lost in the previous years and compensation, you, Qinglin Sect, must give additional compensation to my disciple, Ye Qingtang,” Elder Mo said.

Qinglin Sect could only suffer in silence.

They were indeed unaware that Fu Lingtian was at Martial Qi Level Two, and they wanted the answer as to what happened more so than Xuanling Sect or Wind Moon Sect.

......

The Qinglin Sect elders had ugly expressions and did not know how to reply to the strong voices of Xuanling Sect and Wind Moon Sect.

Fu Lingtian’s martial skills had always been at the second stage of the Third Heaven in Martial Qi Level One, and they were utterly clueless as to why it would suddenly become the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two. Nonetheless, it was impossible for them to interrogate Fu Lingtian for details right then.

“Qinglin Sect, I think you all should give us an explanation today.” Elder Qin scoffed.

“Please calm down. We are discussing right now.” The Qinglin Sect elder frowned.

“Okay, we will wait for you to discuss!” a Wind Moon Sect elder said.

Then, the Xuanling Sect disciples split their sides from laughing.

“I remember that those Qinglin Sect disciples seemed to say that our sect only knows escaping techniques a while back?”

“That’s right. However, how can our sect’s escaping techniques compare to Qinglin Sect’s cheating techniques?”

“Hahaha! Using Fu Lingtian who is at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two to pretend to be at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One, yet he ended up having his hand broken by Junior Sister Ye. I’m afraid that Qinglin Sect will not be able to learn the escaping techniques of our sect’s Junior Sister Ye even if they wanted to.”

The Xuanling Sect disciples were extremely disgruntled towards Qinglin Sect’s ridicule previously but were freely mocking them now.

On the other hand, the Qinglin Sect disciples lowered their heads, ashamed, not knowing what to say.

Their arrogance and disdain were long gone by now, and all they felt was a burn on their faces.

Not only did Fu Lingtian lose to Xuanling Sect’s Ye Qingtang, but Fu Lingtian was also revealed to be a powerful figure at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One.

The Wind Moon Sect disciples looked at Ye Qingtang in reverence.

Not long later, the Qinglin Sect elders spoke after discussing. “The sect in the first place this year… is indeed Xuanling Sect. Apart from losing this year’s wagers to Xuanling Sect, all the wagers we won last year will be returned to Xuanling Sect and Wind Moon Sect in full amount. What do the two sects think?”

“Haha. You all calculated really well. Without counting this year, Fu Lingtian has already been the champion for three years. If you all want to repay, it should at least be the wagers of the past three years and add another year’s wager as our compensations!” Elder Qin said mightily.
