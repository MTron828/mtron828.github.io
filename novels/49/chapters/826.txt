Chapter 827 Disturbed Sleep

Seeing that Du Sheng closed the door immediately, Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded.

Then, she suddenly recalled that she had already changed her appearance and resumed her female identity. Du Sheng did not recognize the current her.

With no other options, Ye Qingtang could only knock on Bliss Forging Workshop’s door once again.

“What? Do you not understand what I said just now?” Du Sheng opened the door and frowned at Ye Qingtang. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang originally wanted to explain the situation, but before Ye Qingtang could say anything, the little white tiger’s voice suddenly sounded from the Bliss Forging Workshop. “F*ck. Which blind person keeps disturbing my good sleep!”

As an arrogant voice sounded, the little white tiger stretched his back and trotted out of the door.

However, the little white tiger was stupefied when he looked outside the door.

Was Ye Qingtang addicted to cross-dressing? One moment a male and the other a female…

“Why? Disturbed your good sleep?” Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger with a seeming smile.

“Du Sheng!” The little white tiger immediately looked at the young man beside it. “F*ck. Du Sheng, I was wondering who it was. So it is you. Why are you making so much noise in the morning and disturbing my sleep…”

If the little white tiger was the second-best in the world at changing its stance. There would definitely not be anyone who dared to be the first.

“Me?”

After hearing the little white tiger, Du Sheng pointed at himself in bewilderment. Wasn’t the person who disturbed its sleep the lady outside the door?

“Ah. Forget it, forget it. I forgive you.” The little white tiger had an arrogant expression.

“Oh… Alright…” Du Sheng nodded instinctively.

“Make way.” The little white tiger walked forward and pushed Du Sheng aside with its butt before looking at Ye Qingtang. “Come, come, come. Come in quickly.”

Before waiting for the little white tiger to finish speaking, Ye Qingtang had already walked into the Bliss Forging Workshop.

In the main hall, the silver wolf was still sleeping, and the wolf nest beside it was clearly seized by the little white tiger.

“Du Sheng, call Master Du over.” After entering Bliss Forging Workshop, Ye Qingtang looked at Du Sheng and said with a smile.

“You are…” Du Sheng was a little surprised. What was the relationship between Ye Chen’s spirit animal and this lady?

“I told you to call that old man out, and you just need to do it. Why do you have so many questions when you’re so young? All you know is to ask this and that. No wonder you never managed to learn a few skills from the old man,” the little white tiger said while staring at Du Sheng

“…” Du Sheng stared blankly at the little white tiger.

“Ah. Alright then.” Du Sheng scratched his head and walked into the inner hall.

After Du Sheng left, the little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang and asked, “Why did you change back again?”

“Why do you have so many questions when you’re so young? No wonder you don’t have an awe-inspiring presence like your father.” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

After hearing Ye Qingtang, the little white tiger was immediately stupefied and subsequently rolled its eyes at Ye Qingtang a few times.

Before long, Master Du walked out of the inner hall and was rather confused when he saw Ye Qingtang. He did not seem to know this stunning lady.

Not waiting for Master Du to speak, Ye Qingtang said, “Sorry, Master Du. I was delayed by something yesterday. When do we set off to the Dragon Vein?”

Master Du was taken aback to hear what Ye Qingtang said, and he looked at her in surprise. “How… How do you know about the Dragon Vein… Could it be that you’re Ye Chen…”

Ye Qingtang smiled. She was about to admit the identity but was a little dumbstruck by Master Du’s next sentence.

“Brother Ye Chen’s wife? Younger sister? Older sister? Friend?” Master Du asked with a frown.
