“What did you say?” The Eldest Princess thought she misheard him.

What did Ling Yan say just now? Seal the Imperial City?!

However, the moment Ling Yan spoke, millions of Black Armor troops proceeded to seal the entire Imperial City immediately.

At this instant, General Wu Hu led the Black Armor troops through the city gate without any emotions and walked to Ling Yan’s side. He kneeled and greeted him. “Emperor, the men are deployed. No one is allowed to leave this Imperial City today.”

“Very good.” Ling Yan replied with a smile.

“You… You all…”

The Eldest Princess was completely dumbfounded as she looked in disbelief. This General Wu Hu… actually addressed Ling Yan as the Emperor…

“Ling Yan… How dare you revolt?!”

The Eldest Prince hollered furiously.

The Eldest Prince never thought that Ling Yan really dared to revolt. Moreover, looking at the current situation, it was obvious that Ling Yan already had a detailed deployment before, which thus allowed him to hide millions of Black Armor troops around the Imperial City…

“Impossible…” The Second Princess shook her head in disbelief.

No matter how intelligent Ling Yan was, it was definitely impossible to hide millions of Black Armor troops in the Imperial City. Did father not sense anything at all? How could it be!

“The Eldest Prince… Eldest Princess, and Second Princess started an armed revolt to murder the Emperor and usurp the throne. I executed them on the spot… but unfortunately, father failed to be rescued and was already killed by the three rebels…” Ling Yan looked at the three royal siblings with a seeming smile and said.

“Ling Yan, what are you saying?!” The Eldest Prince trembled slightly in disbelief.

“Eldest Royal Brother, you colluded with Eldest Royal Sister and Second Royal Sister in the revolt, sealed the Imperial City… and killed Father. I brought General Wu Hu to rescue Father, but it’s too late, unfortunately… Right?” Ling Yan looked at the Eldest Prince with a slight smile.

“Nonsense! Ling Yan, how audacious of you!” The Eldest Prince shouted.

“Ha… Is that so?” A devilish smile emerged on Ling Yan’s face. “You three are merely chess pieces.”

Afterward, without giving them a chance to speak, Ling Yan told General Wu Hu. “How can the game go on if these three people aren’t killed? I’m afraid father will be disappointed as well, won’t he?”

“Kill!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

General Wu Hu nodded and ordered the numerous Black Armor troops.

“How dare you all? I am supported by the Temple of Shadows. Who dares to kill me!” The Eldest Prince shouted coldly.

“I am supported by the Sacred Ground of Reflection. Who dares to kill me?!” The Second Princess shouted as well.

Swoosh!

Yet, the moment they finished their sentences, the Eldest Prince, Eldest Princess, and Second Princess were beheaded in a flash.

Ling Yan watched in smiles without a hint of sympathy as the three headless bodies collapsed to the ground.

“Our game can only go on this way. Isn’t that right?” Ling Yan chuckled.

After the trio was killed by Ling Yan, war drums suddenly echoed in the Imperial City.

Subsequently, the Eternal Emperor appeared before everyone along with the rumbling drums.

His eyes were cold, but a hint of mockery emerged when he glanced at the corpses of the Eldest Prince, Eldest Princess, and Second Princess.

“Crown Prince Ling Yan committed a serious crime by plotting to usurp the throne and killing the Eldest Prince, Eldest Princess, and Second Princess!” The Eternal Emperor shouted furiously in a voice like that of rolling thunder.

“Father, the game is now more interesting with your appearance.” Ling Yan smiled briefly at the Eternal Emperor.

Ye Qingtang rushed over after hearing that the Eldest Prince gathered troops to counter Ling Yan. Currently, she hid in a secret corner with the little white tiger in her arms and observed the exciting show.
