Chapter 1180: Defend (1)

“Lost…?”

The Ancient You Clan elderly was astonished that You Tianhe actually lost to a lady…

After a temporary silence, the people in Heaven City cheered excitedly. This was the second time Heaven City defeated Ancient You Clan since it was surrounded.

“Miss Ye is indeed amazing!”

“Look. I said that the headquarters would not abandon Heaven City, but some of you still belittled Miss Ye just now…”

“Hahaha. Nice. Look at the Ancient You Clan people’s expression… They must have never thought that You Tianhe would be defeated.”

Ye Qingtang subsequently looked up at Ancient You Clan elderly and said, “You all said that as long as someone from Heaven City can win, you will automatically retreat. I wonder if the Ancient You Clan will go back on their words for the second time.”

A cold glint flashed across the Ancient You Clan elderly’s eyes after he heard what Ye Qingtang said, and he sized up Ye Qingtang a few more times. Ultimately, he scoffed and led the Ancient You Clan masses away.

A flurry of cheers erupted in Heaven City.

After the Ancient You Clan masses left completely, the gates of Heaven City opened, and Ye Qingtang entered the city.

“Miss Ye is indeed extraordinary. It seems that my decision this time is right.” Gu Yu looked at Ye Qingtang and forced a laugh.

Ye Qingtang sized up Gu Yu several times without saying anything.

“Miss Ye is tired from the long journey and even fought the Ancient You Clan. She worked hard and attained great merits. I will host a banquet for Miss Ye tonight,” said Gu Yu.

“There’s no need for a banquet. Heaven City is short of rations right now. Save whatever we can,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Haha. It really isn’t easy for Miss Ye to be able to consider these at such a young age… Alright, since that’s the case, Miss Ye may rest first. I have already arranged a resting place for Miss Ye,” Gu Yu said. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang did not refuse and followed them to a small pavilion at a rather secluded corner.

“Miss Ye.”

At this instant, Ling Yan’s voice traveled into Ye Qingtang’s ears.

Ye Qingtang immediately took out her voice transmission stone. “I thought you died.”

Ling Yan chuckled lightly. “How will I dare to die when I haven’t managed to see Miss Ye again?”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

Can’t Ling Yan… talk properly…

Ye Qingtang could vaguely hear that Ling Yan’s side was a little noisy.

Ye Qingtang asked instinctively, “Where are you?”

“In a prison,” replied Ling Yan.

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

“Prison?”

After they parted the other time, Ling Yan returned to Central Mainland safely. Why was…

Why was he in prison now?!

“Yes.” There was a hint of laughter in Ling Yan’s voice, and he completely did not seem like he was imprisoned.

“I am the Eternal Dynasty’s Third Prince. My father has aged, and there is a fight for the throne now. I believe Miss Ye knows some things about this too.”

Ye Qingtang was shocked after hearing what Ling Yan said. “You… lost the fight?”

“That’s not the case,” Ling Yan said. “I’ve never had any interest in being the Emperor of a dynasty. However, one of my brothers and sister viewed me as a threat. Thus, they joined forces and sent me to prison. I wish to get some silence, and it’s also perfect for me now that I can chat with you.”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the voice transmission stone.

In this world, perhaps only Ling Yan would “stay” in a prison to find peace…

It was amazing how he could still be this calm at this moment.
