However, Yue Tiancheng had too many cards in his hand and was able to achieve victory just by using two talismans that the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master gave.

While the Demon Subduing Pagoda was powerful, it was relative. It could subdue and slaughter any evil spirits in an instant, but when dealing with humans, its abilities were greatly reduced and naturally would not be as good as the array formation in a talisman that the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master gave to Yue Tiancheng.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. Although she wanted to save this senior brother that she never met in her previous life, Yue Tiancheng’s skills were too powerful, and she would definitely not be able to defeat him even if she played all her cards.

Moreover, even if she could defeat him, she did not dare to make a move rashly.

No one knew how many cards Yue Tiancheng still had on him, and if he took out another array formation in a talisman…

Just as Ye Qingtang felt helpless with the situation, her eyes flickered. She opened her space ring, and her lips curled into a smile as she looked at the Yunxiao token inside the space ring. Then, she took out an ordinary blouse from the space ring and changed out from the dirty Xuanling Sect uniform.

Since this top was tighter than the Xuanling Sect uniform, Ye Qingtang had the little lightning dragon shrink a little to hide it in her wide sleeves.

After changing, Ye Qingtang immediately stood up and walked ahead in great strides.

About a hundred meter outside, Yue Tiancheng suddenly looked over.

“Whoever that is, do not come any farther!” Yue Tiancheng ordered coldly.

“Is that Senior Brother Yue Tiancheng ahead?” Ye Qingtang stopped walking and asked.

“Who are you?” Yue Tiancheng sized up Ye Qingtang and thought she was rather foreign.

“It indeed is Senior Brother Yue!” Ye Qingtang had an agitated expression. “Senior Brother Yue, I am a Yunxiao Sect disciple!”

Yue Tiancheng was startled to hear that. This random girl who appeared from nowhere actually claimed to be a Yunxiao Sect disciple?

“You are a Yunxiao Sect disciple? Why have I not seen you before?” Ji Yixuan asked.

“Ah…” Ye Qingtang sighed. “Senior Brother Yue, you are an inner sect disciple of Yunxiao Sect while I’m only an outer sect disciple. Isn’t it normal that you have not seen me before?”

As Ye Qingtang said, Yunxiao Sect had many outer sect disciples, and it was impossible for him to meet all of them before.

“Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two” Yue Tiancheng pondered as he scanned Ye Qingtang.

Yunxiao Sect outer sect disciples were at least at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two while this girl was at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two. There should not be any errors.

“Why and what are you doing here?” Yue Tiancheng questioned.

From Yue Tiancheng’s behavior, Ye Qingtang knew that he was an extremely cautious person, and, thus, she was on full alert as well. She chuckled. “Senior Brother Yue, I’ve been hiding in Wind Moon Sect, and I just engulfed the spirit roots of a few genius disciples a few days ago which allowed my spirit root to upgrade. I intended to return to the sect today and did not expect to meet you here.”

Yue Tiancheng’s suspicions were slightly reduced upon hearing that.

The sect sent quite a number of outer sect disciples to hide in the three sects to snatch the spirit roots of those genius disciples in order to strengthen themselves.

While this was not a shocking secret in Yunxiao Sect, it was not allowed to be divulged out, and there was no way others would know of it.

However, half of Yue Tiancheng’s suspicions were gone, but another half remained.

“Your spirit root just upgraded? Since that is the case, let me take a look then.” As he spoke, Yue Tiancheng leaped to Ye Qingtang’s side while looking at her sharply.
