In the next second, an illusory face appeared in the void.

The figure said, “Send someone to the Blue Sky Domain to investigate her identity. Also, follow her and see if she has anything to do with the Temple of Paragon. If she does, you can bring her back to the Dragon Emperor Clan by force.”

“Yes!” With that, the middle-aged man turned into a blur and instantly disappeared. No one knew where he went.

...

The Dragon Emperor Clan had always wanted to rule the entire Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. They launched their plan many years ago, but it had been foiled by the combined efforts of the other factions.

Among them, the Temple of Paragon was a major threat.

If Ye Qingtang was linked to the Temple of Paragon, the Dragon Emperor Clan would never let go of this opportunity.

...

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder had already left the area of the Dragon Emperor Clan. They passed by a deep forest and headed towards a secluded area.

“Holy Lady, where are we going now?”

The Blood Moon Elder hoisted his bags over his shoulders. He wanted to toss them into Ye Qingtang’s space ring but had been rejected by his Holy Lady. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“The Ancient God Karma Tunnel,” the big yellow dog said.

“What?!” The Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed immediately.

Before Ye Qingtang could respond, the Blood Moon Elder blocked her and said hurriedly, “Holy Lady… have you gone mad? You must not go to that place!”

“Oh… you know about the Ancient God Karma Tunnel?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder with a strange expression. How did he know about this?

“I don’t know, but my main body heard from the Heavenly Emperor that in a distant era, this Ancient God Karma Tunnel appeared once. In the end… a monster escaped from that tunnel. That monster even gobbled up the sun!”

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. What the hell… It ate the sun?

What was in the sky now then? A fireball?

“Holy Lady, there are definitely monsters that can eat the sun in there. You must not go and court death!” The Blood Moon Elder was rather anxious.

“Bullsh*t.” The big yellow dog glared at the Blood Moon Elder. “I wanted to eat it back then, but I didn’t eat it.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder looked at the yellow dog at the same time.

“…So the monster he was talking about was you?”

The big yellow dog said, “Monster? What monster? Where did this monster come from? It was a divine canine descending onto the mortal world.”

Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought.

It was only now that she was starting to understand how this big yellow dog came to the lower realm from the upper realm, and why it had such a deep hatred for the Karma Bloodline Clan from the upper realm…

“I finally understand.” Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog and snorted.

“What do you understand?” The yellow dog was puzzled.

“You previously said that the Ancient God Karma Tunnel can only be opened by a pure Karma Bloodline descendant… you must have angered the Karma Bloodline Clan by forcing them to open the tunnel at their own peril to send you away…” Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog.

“Little girl, not bad. You are pretty smart to be able to guess correctly. Most humans are not that intelligent.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang was a little speechless. Was there even a need to guess? It was so obvious.

No wonder the yellow dog was so familiar with the Ancient God Karma Tunnel.. It even knew about the karma energy surrounding it.
