Chapter 472: Worshiper of the Blood Moon Sect (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Yue Tiancheng’s black sword ranked among superior Yellow-grade weapons.

Though the quality of the black sword was not bad, Ye Qingtang did not plan to use it or sell it at an auction.

As a Yunxiao Sect disciple, many people might recognize Yue Tiancheng’s sword.

If she was seen using the sword, there would be adverse consequences.

It took great effort for her to kill the enemy of her previous life, but she did not expect that the only thing she gained was a yellow-grade sword that she could not use in public.

Soon, Ye Qingtang started looking through the random stuff inside the space ring.

“Talisman?!’

Ye Qingtang was delighted.

There were a few of the Yunxiao Sect Master’s talismans in the random stuff!

Ye Qingtang immediately took out the talismans.

Each talisman contained a terrifying aura.

“These are the things that I need the most now…” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled, and she placed the sword and the talismans into her space ring.

Boom!

Just when Ye Qingtang was satisfied with her gains, A shadow flashed at a few hundred meters away suddenly. The shadow then fell to the ground, and there was a huge impact that seemed like it could shake the core of the earth.

A cloud of dust was spinning in the wind, and the entire view was covered by the dust.

Ye Qingtang was stunned and looked up at the void instinctively.

What is that? It seems that it dropped from the… the sky?

The impact of the force created a huge hole on the ground that was about ten feet deep and ten feet wide.

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

If her horse’s speed was slightly faster just now, the thing that dropped from the sky might have her directly…

If she were hit, the force would definitely kill her directly without any doubt. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

So… today she was almost killed by the unexpected misfortune?

Ye Qingtang came down from the horse, and she slowly walked towards the hole curiously.

Ye Qingtang was totally shocked.

There was a handsome young man lying in the hole.

The red robe that the man wore was broken into pieces, and his silver hair scattered around his waist. There was a blood moon at his glabella that appeared to be heretic.

Blood moon?

Ye Qingtang was stunned as she remembered the same symbol that she saw on the Blood Moon Sect Elder. However, the one on Blood Moon Sect Elder was dark red. The blood moon on this man was redder.

Only people at the position of Master and above in the Blood Moon Sect would have the blood moon symbol. The man in front of her was very young, and there was no heretic aura like the one on the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

If he took over someone’s body… However, the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s blood moon disappeared after taking over another’s body.

Or was this person a worshiper of the Blood Moon Sect?

Ye Qingtang could not figure out the identity of the person. Even though the fall of the Blood Moon Sect happened long ago, the rumors were still spreading around. There were rumors saying that some were obsessed with the Blood Moon Sect and that they imitated them.

Ye Qingtang guessed that this man might be one of the imitators…

“Did this guy fall off… from the sky??” Ye Qingtang raised her head and looked into the sky again.
