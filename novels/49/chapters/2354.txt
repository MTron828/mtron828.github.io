Chapter 2355: Stealing Their Teacher (2)

The thought made Lei Yan and others feel extremely aggrieved. More than ever, they pined for the days when Ye Qing was a nobody.

At least then, their Boss would only belong to them. Unlike now… Now there were “love rivals” popping up everything, trying to steal their Boss!

Ye Qingtang didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry at Zhu Ning’s offer. Although she rejected him, he was resolute. It was clear that this person’s aspirations in elixir-refinement was indomitable.

Exasperated, Ye Qingtang had no choice but to agree and spend half a day with Zhu Ning first. She could deal with the rest later.

Before Ye Qingtang left, she had Jing Ze and the others take charge of Hang Wenwei and his group for the time being, to instruct them on the foundational methods she had taught them in the past. They could start training using those methods first.

Hang Wenwei, Qiu Nan and Gong Jinyun, “…”

Lei Yan and the others were shaking with mirth.

Only Ran Mo alone was full of spirit. After Ye Qing left, he scurried over to Qin Feng’s side.

“Qin Feng, teach me a couple of moves?” Ran Mo smiled, revealing his eye teeth.

Qin Feng, “…”

No, he didn’t want to.

Like that, Ye Qing had been “kidnapped” by Zhu Ning to the medicine faculty to research on some elixirs. It had been agreed that it would take just half a day but when it came to elixirs, Zhu Ning was like an obsessed maniac.

By mid-afternoon, he still refused to let Ye Qing leave. Song Yanhan looked on as his own Master humbly discussed elixir-refinement with Ye Qing. The expression on his face was amusing.

Noticing the approach of Yun Chen and the others, Song Yanhan’s face darkened even further.

What else could he do? His own Master was not as good as their teacher. In the end, he could only slink away in embarrassment.

When night fell, Yun Chen and the others finally managed to snatch Ye Qing back from Zhu Ning’s clutches after putting up a major fuss.

Ye Qing took this opportunity to analyze the situation of Hang Wenwei and his team. They all had very solid foundations and pretty good innate talents. It was no coincidence at all that they managed to reach their current cultivation stage.

According to their individual situations, Ye Qing adjusted the techniques and offered them a set of tailor-made methods, to have them practice over this period of time. Hang Wenwei and the others practiced diligently as if they had just received a precious gift.

But Zhu Ning would come over every two or three days to try and steal their teacher again. It was a real headache.

Due to Zhu Ning’s actions, Hang Wenwei, Lei Yan, and the whole group bonded together for the first time.

Unite together to defend against Zhu Ning!

But no matter how hard they tried, they failed to stop Zhu Ning’s attempts.

Exasperated, they sought out Ran Mo.

“Little Mo Mo, go and find your Master. Tell him that if this goes on, Teacher Ye will not have time to teach us.” Hang Wenwei was feeling very aggrieved. He never expected that he would one day end up fighting over a teacher with a medicine faculty teacher.

Ran Mo said, “My Master has always respected Teacher Zhu and this…”

Lei Yan patted Ran Mo on the shoulder. “Let me teach you. Go and see your Master and throw yourself at his feet. Sob as hard as you can, until tears and snot cover your face. If he refuses to help, just cry yourself to death by his feet.”

Ran Mo stared at Lei Yan with his dark, round eyes, as if he had just seen a ghost.

“Don’t worry, this method is very effective. I use it very often.” Lei Yan patted his chest with gusto.

Everyone immediately turned to stare at Lei Yan. The looks on their faces…

Incredulous.

“What are you looking at? I do this every time my father tries to force me to train.” Lei Yan remained nonchalant.

The corners of the lips of Nangong Lie and the rest twitched.

No wonder this kid’s earlier cultivation level was so lousy!

Could he be any more shameless!
