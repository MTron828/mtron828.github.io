Chapter 1778: First Move (1)

The demon’s face was very ugly and had a pair of horns growing out of his forehead. He looked exactly like your typical evil demon and was slightly smaller in size than Ye Qingtang. Hands clasped behind his back, he stood on top of a Sky-Razing Giant Python, which was completely docile beneath his feet.

“That’s... the Great General of the Earth Demon Tribe...” Ba shivered controllably when he noticed that ugly horned demon.

The demons of the Earth Demon Tribe all had horns growing out of their foreheads. It was a symbol of their strength.

Countless fiendish demons patroled around the Sky-Razing Giant Python. All of them indeed possessed long sharp horns on their foreheads.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were full of wonder as she looked at them. This was the first time in her life she had seen demons with horns on their heads.

“The Great General of the Earth Demon Tribe is indeed powerful. He can make an adult Sky-Razing Giant Python his steed...” Ba swallowed hard. As arrogant as Ba was, he couldn’t suppress the fear and awe he felt at the sight of that Great General.

“Sky-Razing Giant Python? Look at the steed of the Heavenly Demon Tribe’s Great General.” Hu lifted his chin with arms still crossed.

Ba glanced over and gasped.

A massive Flaming Ape was standing amongst the demons. That huge ape was very muscular with skin as tough as rock. Swirls of burning lava flowed upon its skin, circling its entire body. Meanwhile, the Flaming Ape was holding a tall, slender demon with greyish-white skin in the palm of its hand. That fiendish demon didn’t look that different from the other demons, but his malevolent face somehow exuded a serene vibe.

Aside from the Heavenly Demon Tribe’s Flaming Ape and the Earth Demon Tribe’s Sky-Razing Giant Python, the steed of the Emperor Demon Tribe’s Great General was also very exceptional. It was a three-headed Wind Snake that could hover in mid-air. Ice-blue in color, it looked different from the other Wind Snakes as it was probably a mutated version.

The tremendous power of the three major demon tribes were on full display. Just the sight of those three steeds was enough to make the other demon camps tremble in fear.

All of those steeds were notorious beasts feared by all fiendish demons. Any one of them could easily destroy thousands of demons. But at this point, those massive beasts were subservient to the three Great Generals. The disparity in strength was astounding.

Ye Qingtang looked at the three Great Generals. Even though she was some distance away, she could already feel their powerful aura. She subconsciously turned toward the eastern Great General.

That mighty fiendish demon, which previously had Ye Qingtang quivering in fear, looked uncharacteristically wary after seeing the three major tribes.

Ye Qingtang noticed that the eastern Great General wasn’t the only one. The other Great Generals had also gathered here but none of them dared to step into the territory of the big three. They all maintained a respectful distance.

By now, all the fiendish demons had now gathered. But the Great Generals of the elite tribes seemed to be oblivious to the fact that their horn signals had summoned all the demons from the other camps. They only observed the presence of their other two major counterparts, as if the demons from the rest of the camps were not even worth a sideways glance.

“Don’t tell me... the Deity Ocean is really going to appear now?” Ba asked quietly. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The gathering of the three top tribes, added to the fact that they had summoned all the demons under them—such a grand gesture meant that something significant was about to happen.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help frowning.

She had learned about the existence of the Deity Ocean from other fiendish demons. She also knew the huge attraction it had to all fiendish demons.
