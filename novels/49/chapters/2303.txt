Chapter 2304: Stepping Forward To Accept The Challenge (2)

“Ye Qing, so you are finally here.” Di Nuo stepped forward and peered down imperiously at him.

Ye Qingtang stood calmly in her spot, meeting Di Nuo’s gaze without any fear.

“The selection trials have started. I wonder which student will you be sending on stage first?” Di Nuo lifted his chin arrogantly.

Ye Qingtang looked at Lei Yan and the rest. On their energetic faces, she saw the glimmer of confidence in their eyes.

“Which of you will challenge first?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The teenagers exchanged looks. It was not fear and unease which had surfaced on their faces, but rather an excited urge to step up.

“Why don’t you go first?” Nangong Lie looked at Lei Yan.

Lei Yan laughed. “No, no. Why don’t you go first? Or Jing Ze is also a good choice. It would be good to have him go and set the pace.”

The teenagers kept trying to give way to each other. In reality, they were all itching to go first. But with Ye Qing present, they had to be courteous and gracious to each other.

But seeing their display, the spectators were thinking otherwise.

“See, Lei Yan and his friends have no confidence to go up there. They are trying to make each other go up first.”

“I wouldn’t be willing either if it was me. With those lousy abilities of theirs, which of them is capable of challenging the top 50? Going up there would just be public humiliation.”

The crowd shook their heads silently. They already knew the result of this farce.

Di Nuo grew impatient as Lei Yan and his friends continued to insist on persuading each other and he snapped in a cold voice, “Ye Qing, don’t try to waste any more time. If your students don’t dare to step up, it would be considered a forfeit. And according to the terms of our bet, you will need to kick them out of the Netherworld Academy before crawling out of the main doors yourself. From then on, you will not be allowed to step inside the academy ever again.”

Di Nuo’s voice echoed throughout the entire arena, reaching every single corner.

Lei Yan and the others were stunned.

“What bet? Boss, what’s going on?” Jing Ze was the first to recover his senses. He quickly asked Ye Qingtang. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang didn’t expect Di Nuo to publicly announce their bet. She had wanted to keep this from those brats.

“It’s nothing. Just a minor bet.” Ye Qingtang tried to gloss over it.

But many nosy spectators were surrounding them. One of those bystanders called out.

“Jing Ze, don’t you guys know? Your teacher made a bet with Teacher Di Nuo in front of the Vice-President a few days ago. If any one of you six fails to get selected for the Inter-Academy Competition, he would personally kick you out of the Netherworld Academy before crawling out himself!”

The person placed special emphasis on the word “crawl”.

The faces of Qin Feng and the rest immediately grew solemn. It was like a layer of frost was covering their faces. They stared at Ye Qing.

Ye Qingtang felt a headache coming on.

Damn, looks like she couldn’t hide things anymore.

The crowd couldn’t resist smirking at the expressions of Qin Feng and his group.

It was clear that Ye Qing didn’t discuss this bet with them. Qin Feng and those fools would be hopping mad now that they knew their own teacher had betrayed them! There was no way they would be willing to step onto the arena now!
