Chapter 813 Shameless (2)

“Mother-“

Just as Ye Qingtang was frowning, a soft voice suddenly came from the bedroom. The little black ball which shuttled back into the bedroom earlier on directly seized the little lightning dragon’s body. Rubbing its sleepy eyes, it ran to Ye Qingtang’s side with tiny steps.

“Mother…” The little dragon man clutched onto the edge of Ye Qingtang’s clothes and glanced at the haphazard place. It frowned immediately and swept a look at the white tiger before looking at Ye Qingtang. “Mother, that is not a good thing. Look, it made this place into a mess.”

The white tiger looked at the little dragon man who had no sense of shame. “You are a good thing.”

Ye Qingtang rubbed its temples vexedly.

“Why are you making a din at night?”

Could it be that it was provoked when it ran out of the house?

“What the f*ck. What has it got to do with me? It’s clearly this fellow who fought with me.” The white tiger complained with dissatisfaction and shot a glare at the little dragon man who hid beside Ye Qingtang.

“It fought with you?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly and turned around to look at the pitiful little dragon man.

“Mother, it maligned me… I clearly just woke up.” The little dragon man blinked its eyes innocently.

“What the f*ck. You still have the face to say that?” The white tiger blew its beard in anger and swept a look at the silver wolf which hid in the corner. It raised its front paw and pointed at the silver wolf. “Come here. Did it hit me just now?”

Don’t think that you don’t need to own up to your own fault after changing a shell!

Aggrieved, the silver wolf looked at the fierce white tiger and then at the little dragon man, who pretended to be pitiful though its eyes were filled with threat in reality.

What sin did he commit!

Then, the silver wolf lower its head and buried it between its two front paws. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

It was an “I’m a wolf, I don’t understand what you all are talking about” manner.

The white tiger narrowed its eyes and was about to drag the silver wolf over to testify for him.

Before it could take a step.

Ye Qingtang tugged its fur directly.

“Are you done? You made a din here at night already. Can you stop for a while?”

“What the f*ck. You don’t believe me?!” The white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang’s speechless expression and was so close to slapping the little dragon man to death.

“Believe you? Believe that you snatched Xiao Guai’s nest?” Ye Qingtang glimpsed downwards.

The white tiger then realized that one of its back paws was still stepping on the wolf nest that it snatched from the silver wolf.

“What… What the f*ck… This is its present as a form of respect to me.” The white tiger spoke uprightly.

The silver wolf which hid in the corner looked up wrongfully.

Ye Qingtang felt helpless when she saw the silver wolf’s aggrieved behavior.

For some reason, Xiao Guai had been a little strange these few days. It was never bullied by the little white tiger on usual days, but why was it now…

“Alright. It’s late. Go to sleep.” Ye Qingtang did not intend to argue with the white tiger anymore and carried the little dragon man back into the bedroom.

She still had to find an excuse to explain to Master Du about… the entire mess in this room

tomorrow.

The white tiger glared at the little dragon man in Ye Qingtang’s arms. Watching the little dragon man make a face at it, the white tiger ripped the wolf nest apart in fury.

“What the f*ck! How dare you

The little dragon man raised its eyebrows proudly and laid on Ye Qingtang’s shoulder comfortably with a provocative expression.

The white tiger clenched its teeth and snorted!

“I’m so pissed!”
