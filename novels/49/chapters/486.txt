Chapter 487: Elder Lin (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Was Elder Lin joking? Even Ning Luo who was at Martial Qi Level Three was not Ye Qingtang’s opponent, yet Elder Lin told them to capture Ye Qingtang. Did he not understand the situation?!

Not mentioning the fact that they were not Ye Qingtang’s opponent, they would not listen to Elder Lin and attack Ye Qingtang even if they could defeat Ye Qingtang.

They knew what was right and wrong. Ning Luo was clearly a Xuanling Sect spy, and if Ye Qingtang had not appeared, they would have been met with a disaster. How could they fight Ye Qingtang now just because of Elder Lin’s orders? VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Elder Lin, I’m afraid we cannot obey your orders!” a Xuanling Sect disciple said grimly.

“Master… I cannot obey your orders as well…” Zhu Changge said.

Elder Lin had a look of surprise when he saw that these Xuanling Sect disciples actually refused his orders.

“Elder Lin, Ning Luo is clearly the spy and even attacked us just now. As the sect elder, not only did you not do anything, you even wanted us to attack Junior Sister Ye. Could you be a sect spy as well?” Qin Huan stared at Elder Lin and questioned.

“Junior Brother Qin Huan, do not talk nonsense!” Zhu Changge said with a frown.

Elder Lin had a changed expression after hearing Qin Huan. “As a sect disciple, you have no respect for your elders. You should be punished!”

Then, Elder Lin waved his right arm, and a powerful breath pierced the air and charged towards Qin Huan.

Qin Huan’s expression changed drastically after feeling this frightening energy. Never had he expected that Elder Lin would actually attack him!

Whiz!

A shadow flashed and blocked in front of Qin Huan.

Ye Qingtang readily dissipated that energy.

“Elder Lin, could it be that you’re afraid of being exposed and want to silence him?” Ye Qingtang asked smilingly.

“Haha… Little girl. I really underestimated you back then.” Elder Lin sneered. “Indeed, I want to protect Ning Luo today. However, I am not the sect spy.”

Afterward, Elder Lin looked at Ning Luo beside him and said, “Ning Luo, I know that you’re a Yunxiao Sect disciple, but you and I have a strong relationship. No matter what, I will ensure your safety today. Xuanling Sect does not have any room for you, so I will leave together with you. What do you think?”

“It would naturally be the best if Master is so principled.” Ning Luo smiled and continued on. “Master should be aware that Xuanling Sect now knows of something they should not and would definitely meet with a calamity. No one will be spared. You just said that we have a strong relationship… I will find a way to protect your life since you helped me today.”

“Ning Luo… it is not just my life. Your Junior Brother Lin Feng’s life…” Elder Lin looked at his grandson, Lin Feng.

“Ha…” Ning Luo’s eyes were cold, though he had an indescribable smile on his face. “Rest assured, Master. Junior Brother Lin Feng and I are very close as well. I am a kind person, and I will naturally protect his life as well.”

“Good, Ning Luo. The years I spent grooming you are not in vain.” Elder Lin finally heaved a sigh of relief after obtaining Ning Luo’s promise.

After Fu Lingtian admitted that he was a Yunxiao Sect disciple and revealed Yunxiao Sect’s secret, Elder Lin felt that things were far from good. Given Yunxiao Sect’s way of handling matters, it would definitely annihilate Xuanling Sect.

Even if Ning Luo died here today, Yunxiao Sect would receive the news not long later. Ever since Fu Lingtian said the truth that day, Xuanling Sect was destined to be exterminated.

Elder Lin was originally at his wit’s end until Ning Luo sneaked into the Hall of Justice to kill Fu Lingtian and Xuanling Sect. Learning about that, a tiny hope arose within him.
