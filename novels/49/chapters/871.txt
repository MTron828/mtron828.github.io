Chapter 872 Great Enemy

The Dharma treasure was matched with different cultivation levels, such as the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Dharma treasure, Arcane Supremacy Dharma treasure, and Heavenly Venerate Dharma treasure.

Every Dharma treasure was extremely precious, and the Arcane Supremacy Dharma treasures were very rare. Li Bingxue and Gu Tianhe had never heard of the Heavenly Venerate Dharma treasure at all. There might be a few in the entire Central Mainland.

The square seal that Perfected Gu Yun was holding was called the Heaven Tremor Seal. According to the rumors, one of the powerful inhumans was killed and taken back by humans when the inhuman race attacked the first domain in the past. The seal was equivalent to the second stage of the Arcane Supremacy Dharma treasure. It was extremely powerful!

Though the spirit energy was limited on this mainland, which restrained cultivators’ abilities, that only applied to cultivators. The Dharma treasure still worked, and their power was not influenced at all!

The three of them were all stunned when Perfected Gu Yun took out the Divine Supreme Dharma treasure. An ominous feeling arose in their hearts.

“Break!”

Perfected Gu Yun shouted coldly.

The Heaven Tremor Seal rose at the next second and radiated dazzling lusters. It hit the Sealed Sky Formation at the next instant.

Crack! Crack!

Broken sounds arose in the mid-air, and golden rays of light fell from the sky like golden rain.

“SH*T!” Gu Tianhe was shocked. The Heaven Tremor Seal’s one hit was able to break the Sealed Sky Formation…

“Don’t panic! The Heaven Tremor Seal is a Divine Supreme Dharma treasure. His ability is suppressed at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord level on this mainland. Based on his current ability, his power will be drawn from his body every time he uses the Dharma treasure. He will not be able to use that many times!” Feng Wudang frowned and said.

Li Bingxue and Gu Tianhe’s expressions were slightly better after they heard Feng Wudang’s words.

As Feng Wudang had said, the Divine Arcane Supreme Dharma treasure was equivalent to one at the Divine Arcane Supremacy. One could only use the Heaven Tremor Seal perfectly with the Divine Arcane Supremacy’s ability.

Perfected Gu Yun was an Arcane Supremacy, but his martial ability was suppressed heavily on this mainland. His fighting ability was only at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord level!

As a Yin Yang Perfected Lord, how many times could he use the Divine Supreme Dharma treasure?!

“Young people, I want you dead!”

Perfected Gu Yun finally escaped from the Sealed Sky Formation. His sinister eyes swept across the three people.

The students of the Supreme Academy had just entered the Arcane Supremacy level not long ago. They were just normal Virtual Arcane Supremacies. They were like ants in his eyes.

However, the ants pushed him to such an extent that he had to exhaust almost half of his energy to use the Heaven Tremor Seal!

“Perfected Gu Yun, based on your current ability, you can use the Heaven Tremor Seal at most three times! You used it one time just now, and you are left with two more times. If you use it by force again, your energy will be totally depleted, and you will be dead by then!” Feng Wudang shouted harshly.

“Perfected Gu Yun, we have four people here, but you are only left with two times to use the Heaven Tremor Seal. We will use two of our lives in exchange for your life!” Gu Tianhe said.

Swoosh!

Perfected Gu Yun did not reply. Instead, he reached in front of Feng Wudang instantly. Before the rest knew what happened, Perfected Gu Yun punched towards Feng Wudang.
