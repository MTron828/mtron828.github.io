“To cause a delay, we just need to remain in this Crystal Palace,” Mu Feiruo suggested.

To be honest, he didn’t want Ye Qingtang to take such a huge risk. They were already being burdened by Long Xiao and the rest. There was no need for Ye Qingtang to be a scapegoat.

Long Xiao didn’t speak but just looked toward Fu Qiu.

Fu Qiu was looking somewhat grim.

The biggest benefit to Fu Qiu’s Crystal Palace was its ability to negate the effect daylight had on it. Besides, it also prevented other fat catfish from noticing and attacking it.

Although it did have its uses, this type of special crystal did not offer complete defence against all types of invaders.

There had been countless attempts by people out in the Ten Thousand Poison Valley to destroy this Crystal Palace. A large portion of the palace had already been damaged. It would not be long before this Crystal Palace would be utterly destroyed.

Likewise, Mu Feiruo and the others did not wish to get mixed up in this matter. They were already at a disadvantage in terms of numbers and strength.

“Even if we agreed to work with you, you are unable to guarantee Elder Sister Qing’s safety.” Jiang Shaobai narrowed his eyes. It was clear that Ye Qingtang’s safety was of utmost importance to him.

“Yes, it’s true that I can’t guarantee that.” Long Xiao gave a bitter smile.

If given a choice, he wouldn’t want to implicate innocent parties into this matter either. But he had no other option.

Ye Qingtang looked at the crowd standing before her. If her mother was truly one of the Dragon Emperor Clan, she was naturally happy to help Long Xiao and the rest. Also, she might be able to glean more details about her mother from Long Xiao.

However...

“I will leave immediately if things look bad,” said Ye Qingtang.

The eyes of Jiang Shaobai and the others widened at Ye Qingtang’s words.

In return, Long Xiao responded, “I promise that I will do my best to ensure your safety. You can leave anytime if things become too dangerous. We will try to buy time for you.”

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

“Tell me about your aunt, just in case.”

Long Xiao glanced around and indicated for the rest of the crowd to leave. Only Fu Qiu, Long Yao, Long Yi and Jiang Shaobai stayed behind with Ye Qingtang.

“Elder Sister Qing, we don’t need to take this risk,” Jiang Shaobai whispered.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “Mu Feiruo and the others have yet to find the mystic realm’s exit point. If this Crystal Palace is damaged, we’ll have to remain in this mystic realm, and in the end, we will be exposed to the dangers here.”

A slight frown appeared on Jiang Shaobai’s face. He looked as if he wanted to say something, but remained silent in the end.

“May I know how to address you?” Long Xiao asked Ye Qingtang.

“My surname is Ye,” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Ms. Ye, I have a drawing of my Aunt Jiu here. As we are pressed for time, could Ms. Ye please change her appearance first before we continue?” Long Xiao handed a portrait over to Ye Qingtang.

Conflicting emotions rose in Ye Qingtang’s heart as she gazed at the woman in the drawing.

She had come to seek her mother but had never expected to have to pass herself off as her own mother.

Without another word, Ye Qingtang turned and went back to her room.

Long Yao was not at all happy with Long Xiao’s plan. She didn’t think that the plain-looking Ye Qingtang could adequately pass herself off as their Aunt Jiu.

“Elder Brother, you are taking too big of a risk this time.” Furrowing her brows, Long Yao did not hide her displeasure.
