Chapter 1534 Who Says I“m Not A Baby 3

The moment they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, everyone immediately focused on her.

Their previous unhappiness over being fleeced was now replaced with a trace of hope.

Ye Qingtang secretly smirked when she saw this.

Although she did not know why these black strings did not attack her, they were sufficient to block the powerful figures and force them to rely on her help. The extortion, which had previously cast a shadow in their hearts, was now replaced by a feeling of good fortune.

“Old Jiang, since your descendant can safely walk through the area covered with black strings, why not... ask her to bring us out?” The moment You Qiong heard this, he immediately went over to Jiang Yu and started to toady up to him.

“Of course I can bring all of you out. All of you have been the companions of my ancestor, the Domain Monarch, for many years. I certainly will not abandon you, but... these black strings cover the entire ground. If you follow behind me, I’m afraid you will also be attacked. The only way is for me... to bring you out without your feet touching the ground.” Now, Ye Qingtang assumed the attitude of a sensible junior. The cunning look she had worn while extorting them had disappeared.

Although Jiang Yu was not willing to be involved with these people, he felt happy to hear Ye Qingtang’s respectful words.

He swept a smug look at the others.

Do you see that? All of you are benefiting from my good fortune! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

No one was in any mood to quibble with Jiang Yu. When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, one said, “Without our feet touching the ground? But I don’t think we can fly here. How are we to...”

The person did not finish his sentence. He suddenly looked down at his child’s body, then at the little white tiger Ye Qingtang was carrying her arms. His eyes brightened.

“Why don’t you carry us out!”

“This...” Ye Qingtang pretended to look dismayed. “All of you are my elders. Wouldn’t that be rather inappropriate?”

Extortion was extortion. Before leaving, she must soothe everyone.

“It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter.” This crowd of previously arrogant powerful figures now dismissed her protests without any reservation.

The most important thing was to survive! If they had to be carried out by a junior, then so be it!

Anyway, there was no one else here besides them. It did not matter as long as no one else saw them.

Ye Qingtang still looked dismayed, which caused everyone to panic. They all raised their little heads and tried to persuade her. They even asked Jiang Yu to speak for them.

“Bah, you bunch of shameless old men! Our Tang Tang is still a young girl. Do you smelly, shameless men really want her to carry you out? If others get to hear of it, her reputation will be ruined.” Jiang Yu had observed the subtle shift in Ye Qingtang’s attitude and vaguely guessed at her inhibitions. So now, he put on a stern face and pretended to be angry.

“What shameless old men! I am now just a three-or four-year-old child! How could that ruin her reputation!” Emperor Yan, who had always considered himself to be the best, now shamelessly puffed out his small chest to show he was just a child!

“That’s right, that’s right. I’m even younger. I’m only two. I can’t even walk properly. It doesn’t matter if you carry me.” Another powerful figure tried his best to widen his large, glistening eyes to show how innocent and adorable he was.

In such a fatal situation, one must be able to humble oneself.

Their lives were certainly more important than their principles!

In order to preserve their lives, they were now a bunch of babies!

“...” Ye Qingtang looked wordlessly at this bunch of spry and elderly powerful figures. Each was shamelessly pretending to be babyish. Her gut almost burst with suppressed laughter, but she continued to pretend to look embarrassed. She looked at Jiang Yu, as if waiting for him to speak.
