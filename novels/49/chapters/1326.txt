1327 Force Him to Revolt 2

“I mean, force him… to revolt.” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes with a tinge of impatience in her expression.

The Eldest Prince and Second Princess looked at each other in confusion as they were unable to understand the key in Ye Qingtang’s words.

Ye Qingtang was overwhelmed with helplessness at the group of incompetent teammates.

“General Mo is already dead, and General Wu Hu took over his military leadership. A long time ago, when General Wu Hu was having a difficult time, it was Ling Yan who helped him.” Ye Qingtang did not slack off in the past few days; since she wanted to slowly eliminate the Temple of Shadows’s suspicions of her, she had to put in effort in this matter.

“Ling Yan rescued General Wu Hu before? Why do we not know of this?” The Eldest Prince had a blank expression. He had investigated Ling Yan for a long time but did not notice this at all.

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered with the Eldest Prince and replied.

“Ling Yan’s accusation of General Mo won the Emperor’s trust, but if he did it only for his trusted aide to replace General Mo, the meaning is completely different.”

Pausing for a while, she continued on. “One will inevitably fall from the pinnacle of power. What you all need to do now is to continuously show weakness to Ling Yan and secretly support his trusted aide to ascend the position. Afterward, you all can act in secret and slowly spread rumors that Ling Yan has intentions to usurp the throne.”

This time, Ye Qingtang truly became serious. Otherwise, with just the Eldest Prince and the rest, they would not have the ability to defeat Ling Yan even if the Eternal Emperor died.

Everyone was stunned by Ye Qingtang’s words, and they exchanged a look.

“What Elder Ye meant is… for us to assist Ling Yan to consolidate his power? But by then… if we cannot defeat…” The Eldest Prince was slightly hesitant.

“Why do you all need to counter him?” Ye Qingtang looked down slightly and said without emotion. “As long as you all are able to raise the Emperor’s suspicions of Ling Yan, the Emperor will naturally make a move out of fear of his power. Then, Ling Yan will either await his doom and be stripped of his Crown Prince title or revolt with his army. It’s no longer important whether he really intends to usurp the throne or not as the circumstances will force him to take action.”

“Uh…” The Eldest Prince and the rest were still uncertain.

“I am merely telling you all to show weakness on the surface, but you all can still retain your forces in secret. Once Ling Yan revolts, you all can take credit for capturing him and restoring peace.” Ye Qingtang added on.

The Eldest Prince and Second Princess sighed in relief upon hearing that.

“Elder Ye’s wisdom is above all. Once Ling Yan loses father’s trust, he is not far from death.” The Second Prince truly believed that this method was vicious and forceful.

Born to a royal family, they were naturally aware of how heartless an Emperor would be to any child with the intention of usurping the throne.

“Elder Ye, may I ask how you plan to raise father’s suspicions?” The Eldest Prince questioned further.

“I will deal with this matter. You all don’t need to worry about it.” Anyways, Ye Qingtang did not hope that the Eldest Prince and the rest were smart as she still needed to settle everything.

The Eldest Prince and the rest still had some questions, but since Ye Qingtang was so certain, they believed her.

Moreover, since the Temple of Shadows wanted to assist the Eldest Prince to ascend to the Crown Prince position, the Eldest Prince did not worry that Ye Qingtang would harm him.

“Thank you for your advice.” The Second Princess rose and bowed. Although she felt that Ye Qingtang’s plan was pretty good, she was not in a hurry to settle on it as she still needed to discuss it with the Advisor.
