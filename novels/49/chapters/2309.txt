Chapter 2310: Come Up For A Beating (2)

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, Nangong Lie leaped up onto the platform.

“Student Nangong Lie. I have come to challenge Gong Jinyun.”

Everyone at present gasped again.

Things were escalating!

Really escalating!

Lei Yan had just challenged the number 10 student. And Nangong Lie was now challenging the one ranked number nine?

Lei Yan cursed under his breath after hearing Nangong Lie’s challenge.

“Damn, that fellow is so despicable!”

Because of the bet and because he was still getting used to his new cultivation level, Lei Yan didn’t dare to challenge someone too highly ranked. But after sparring with Hang Wenwei, Lei Yan realized just how much more powerful he was.

Nangong Lie naturally also noticed this. This was why he purposely chose someone just one rank higher. Lei Yan was hopping mad at Nangong Lie’s move.

Just like Hang Wenwei, Gong Jinyun was not at the arena either. After being summoned, he was just as confused as Hang Wenwei had been. But as he passed by Hang Wenwei, he saw that Hang Wenwei’s eyes were full of conflict. Gong Jinyun was even more mystified at this.

“Good luck.” Hang Wenwei patted Gong Jinyun on the shoulder in a meaningful manner.

Gong Jinyun, “…”

What the hell?

Good luck?

When Gong Jinyun stood facing Nangong Lie, he didn’t show much of a reaction.

After all…

At least Lei Yan was the young master of a major family clan. The frivolous Nangong Lie was a complete nobody.

“Please go ahead.” Gong Jinyun was perplexed but he compliantly accepted the challenge.

Nangong Lie was all smiles as he cupped his fist politely.

Just as Gong Jinyun was musing over why this teenager, whom he had never met before, would dare to challenge him, Nangong Lie charged forward and unleashed his aura. The Divine Lord stage aura enveloped the entire arena.

Gong Jinyun, “…”

What the hell?! Where did this fellow come from?

The appearance of a third Divine Lord level practitioner sent the already-shocked crowd straight into a stupefied daze.

Gong Jinyun never expected Nangong Lie to be a Divine Lord stage practitioner. Before he could react, he was struck off the platform by Nangong Lie in just three moves.

The entire process was so fast that Gong Jinyun failed to react and was as dumb and stiff as a wooden chicken.

“Brother, I understand how you feel. It’s fate…” Hang Wenwei, who had just experienced a similar outcome, patted Gong Jinyun on the shoulder.

Thankfully he was not the only one who lost face today.

Nangong Lie turned and raised a provocative brow at Di Nuo. He then leaped off the platform and used his Divine Lord energy to amplify his voice.

“Everyone listen up and listen well. All those who insulted my Boss previously, I will remember you.” Nangong Lie surveyed the crowd, the threat in his eyes was clear.

Having been warned by three consecutive Divine Lord level practitioners, those busybody student spectators shivered in fear.

At this point, they felt an angry urge to beat up Meng Yao for spreading such baseless rumors.

Didn’t she say they were a bunch of useless fools?

How were they useless?! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They were a bunch of killing machines!

The crowd had yet to recover from Nangong Lie’s threat when a figure dashed up onto the platform.

“Student Jing Ze, I have come to challenge…”

Jing Ze chose the student ranked number eight.

By now, the crowd was already numb from the repeated shock.

Haha…

Well, well. Three Divine Lord level practitioners?

Even if this Jing Ze was also at the Divine Lord stage, they would no longer be surprised.

It’s just the Divine Lord stage…

A bunch of lunatics!!!
