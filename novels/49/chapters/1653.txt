The top twenty participants of the other families had fought their way to the top. But to Jiang Yisheng and the others, Ye Qingtang had entered purely based on luck. No matter who she faced from the other ancient clans, it would be a foregone conclusion.

“Qingtang, look up there.” Jiang Yisheng clutched her tightly. Even if Ye Qingtang was only here for a while, she should also gain some experience. He kindly pointed to the seats above the arena.

Several youths and girls were seated in those elevated positions.

The first was Baili Xi, whom they had encountered earlier.

“Do you see those ten places? They belong to the ten who won the last championship. They have privileges and will automatically be one of the top ten finalists in this Martial Arts Championship. To be frank, our matches are only qualifying rounds. The hundreds of us need to compete to identify the top ten, who will then be qualified to challenge those ten people. We have to beat them in order to be one of the top ten in this Martial Arts Championship, and enter the mystic realm...” Jiang Yisheng patiently explained the Martial Arts Championship rules to Ye Qingtang.

The time for each Martial Arts Championship was not fixed. Sometimes, the interval between championships was a few years, sometimes it spanned a dozen years. It was said that the longest interval between two championships was a few decades.

It was not just the various ancient clans who decided when a Martial Arts Championship would take place. It also depended on the Island of Immortal Footsteps, and when the mystic realm would open.

The Martial Arts Championship would only begin when the mystic realm was about to open.

And only the younger generation of the various clans could participate in the Martial Arts Championship. Once they were over twenty-five years of age, they were no longer allowed to participate. This was simply because the mystic realm only permitted youths below the age of twenty-five to enter. Once they passed that age, the mystic realm would expel them without care.

No one could explain this strange phenomenon.

The last Martial Arts Championship had been held five years ago. Many of the top ten contestants from the last championship had not yet reached the age of twenty-five. Hence, they continued to attend this championship and enjoyed certain privileges.

Of the top ten participants from the last championship, only two had exceeded the age of twenty-five and were unable to compete again. Another two from the Ancient You Clan were absent. Even so, that left six people.

These six people were the top talents from the last championship.

“The first is Baili Xi, while the second has passed the age limit and is absent this year. The third is that girl. Can you see her? Her name is Mu Feiruo. To me, she is like a goddess...” Jiang Yisheng gazed tenderly at a frosty-looking girl sitting in the third place.

“Wipe your drool. You’re disgusting.” Jiang Yiran, who was passing by, heard Jiang Yisheng infatuated comments and could not help but feel nauseated.

Jiang Yiran subconsciously raised his hand to wipe his mouth, only to find it clean. He glared at Jiang Yiran.

“Are you worthy to think of Mu Feiruo? With your lousy skills, Mu Feirou only needs three moves to ensure you can’t even walk off the dais. I think you should stop wasting your time.” Jiang Yiran shrugged nonchalantly. His gaze passed over the powerful figures from the last championship, and he pointed to the youth sitting at the last place.

“If you want to have “intimate contact” with Mu Feiruo, you must first beat Baili Xuanyun. He’s the second most powerful figure in the Baili family. Want me to help you ask him whether you can have a private match first?”
