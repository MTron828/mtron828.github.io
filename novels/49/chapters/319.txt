“Senior Brother Ji, I’m honored to learn from you.” Ye Qingtang finally smiled as she saw Ji Xianyuan walking onto the arena.

Ji Xianyuan just nodded slightly. His face was expressionless.

After Lin Feng challenged the top position of Ji Xianyuan, all disciples knew the true ability of Ji Xianyuan.

His ability was comparable with inner sect disciples. Who else in the outer sect dared to challenge him?

Yet, unexpectedly…

Ye Qingtang was so bold.

Elder Qin, who was standing at the side of the arena, frowned upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s choice. Elder Lin’s showed a peculiar sight as he witnessed the concern Elder Qin showed.

The warden who was in charge of the arena announced the beginning of the competition after confirming with Ye Qingtang.

This competition was different from the rest today. The whole square was silent after the announcement was made.

This was completely a one-sided challenge. No one even had any expectations for Ye Qingtang.

When everyone was out of interest, Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes. However, she did not begin her attack. Instead, she was staring at Ji Xianyuan cautiously.

Ji Xianyuan took a quick glance at Ye Qingtang and attacked instantly!

His body appeared like a streak of light on the arena. He did not even pull out his sword as he dashed towards Ye Qingtang like the wind.

His fist smashed towards Ye Qingtang’s temple as he landed on the ground.

However, the instant when Ji Xianyuan raised his fist, Ye Qingtang’s heel turned, and her tiny body moved sideways. The sharp wind created by the fist flew through her hair on the temple.

Boom!

The wind created by the fist smashed the stone pillar behind Ye Qingtang. The crushed stones flew away and dropped to the ground. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As the dust spread, all disciples who were not interested previously were stunned.

“How is Ye Qingtang so lucky?” One disciple stared at the crushed stone pillar and was shocked when he noticed Ye Qingtang was not hurt at all.

If the fist landed on the human body, even if this person did not die instantly, they would be disabled!

No one expected Ye Qingtang to be able to dodge the first attack away by luck.

“Did Senior Brother Ji not use his full strength?” Lin Feng raised his brows. He did not believe that Ji Xianyuan’s attack would be dodged away by a new disciple.

Ji Xianyuan frowned as his first attack missed. He stared at Ye Qingtang, whose face still remained calm. His eyes sparkled.

At the next second, Ji Xianyuan stepped on the ground and opened his fist. Strong air currents were concentrated in his palm.

The Gale Palm!

Elder Huang, who was at the side of the arena, was stunned when he saw Ji Xianyuan’s palm. The Gale Palm was the most powerful palm skill in the outer sect. Its power was unimaginable, and even the wind created was extremely sharp!

Within a second, Ji Xianyuan smashed his palm towards Ye Qingtang’s head. Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes as the strong wind blew her hair up. Suddenly, a trace of cold light appeared in her eyes. The moment Ji Xianyuan smashed down his palm, her body leaned backward, and she raised her left arm. The white hand swiped across Ji Xianyuan palm, but she did not manage to hold the palm.

However, Ye Qingtang’s hand suddenly turned and grabbed Ji Xianyuan’s wrist. Her feet pushed off the ground and jumped backward. She pushed down Ji Xianyuan’s wrist and smashed towards the Eight Trigrams Stage using the downward force.
