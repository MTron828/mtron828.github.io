Chapter 87: Life Experience (2)

“Was that baby Ye Xun?” Ye Qingtang asked concernedly.

Ye Ling shook his head, “Ye Xun was picked up at our doorstep after I succeeded the household. The baby I was referring to, was you….”

Ye Qingtang was stunned in an instant.

Ye Ling gave a grim smile as he looked at Ye Qingtang and said: “Tang Tang, I intended to tell you all these after you had married. But after all that has happened, I reckon it’ll be best to let you know now.”

“That day when we lost our child, it was ever so heartrending. But after we found you, that emotion we felt then, it’s difficult for me to put into words. Like a Godsend, we took you home and raised you like our own daughter. We’ve never brought this up to anyone else since, only your mother and I knew.”

With that said, Ye Ling picked up the pendant from the box.

“This pendant was found on you when we picked you up as a baby. It’s most likely a keepsake from your birth parents. I’ve approached several channels to investigate its origin, but there weren’t many leads. The only piece of info we found was, it might be related to the royal family from the dynasty of the Nine Nights. Ever since you revealed a blue spirit root, I reckoned your birth parents might be people of an incredible caliber.”

A blue spirit root was akin a precious treasure. Considering the Ye’s family history, cases of offspring possessing a blue spirit root were certainly rare.

The Nine Nights Dynasty…

Ye Qingtang was slightly astounded when she heard its name.

The City of Lin was a territory under the Imperial Dynasty of Tianqi, comprised of several countries, each governed by its respective monarchy. All these monarchies were collectively referred as the Tianqi royal family, and they regarded the Dynasty of the Nine Nights as an adversary.

“I’m glad to see you’ve matured considerably and felt it’s time to hand this over to you. After you’ve joined Xuan Ling’s clan in the future, as a member of the Exalted, I reckon you’ll have better chances of finding out who your birth parents are.” Ye Ling placed the pendant in Ye Qingtang’s hand, he was proud and grateful for having Ye Qingtang as a daughter.

Ye Qingtang observed the pendant in her hand. The feelings she had now were pretty complicated. In her past, Ye Ling passed away before he could reveal this secret to anyone, thus she could never imagine there was such a story behind her birth.

But now…. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

To think she would only discover this secret, after all this time.

Ye Qingtang grasped the pendant as she raised her eyes filled with determination, and looked at Ye Ling.

“You’ll always be my father.”

Ye Ling gave a gentle smile, that assurance alone was the most gratifying reward in his life.

“It’s getting late, you should go rest up. There’re still preparations to be done for your journey to Xuan Ling’s clan.”

“Yes, father.” Ye Qingtang nodded before she got up from her seat.

“Right, there’s one more thing.” Ye Ling spoke up abruptly.

Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks.

“After dealing with the Great Elder, your uncle and I’ve also gotten rid of his conspirators within the household. We wanted to deal with Ye Xun as well but couldn’t find her. After investigation, it seems the Great Elder has sent her away discreetly in the midst of the celebration and we’ve no idea where she went.” Ye Ling knitted his brows as he spoke.

He had fostered two daughters, but in the case of Ye Xun, there were many witnesses around when she was picked up. Thus, unlike Ye Qingtang, she could only be known as an adopted child, but Ye Ling had never played favorites and treated both of them equally as his own children.

But who could have expected their characters would turn out to be polar opposites even when they were raised under the same roof.

And unfortunately, Ye Xun turned out to be a snake in the grass.

“Duly noted, father. I’ll be sure to watch out.” Ye Qingtang gave a slight nod. With the Great Elder’s death, there was no way to ascertain where Ye Xun was sent, but regardless, she would keep up her vigilance.

“That’s good. Go get some rest then.” Ye Ling nodded and ended their conversation for the night.
