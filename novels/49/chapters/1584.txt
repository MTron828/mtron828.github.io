1585 Black Witch 3

When the crowd saw the holy chalice in the Bishop of York’s hand, they seemed to see a ray of hope. Pious smiles appeared on their faces.

In these years when war was widespread, the Vatican was their greatest source of spiritual comfort. Living on the edge between life and death, only God’s guidance, as relayed by the Vatican, could relieve their fears and unease. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

One might say that in the hearts of the citizens, the Vatican was equivalent to imperial authority.

At the Bishop of York’s notice, everyone in the bar frantically scrambled to leave. They could not wait to distance themselves from the black witch.

In a moment, the entire bar was completely empty; only Ye Qingtang was left.

Large numbers of Vatican knights surrounded the bar. They held long spears and stood at the ready.

“The light of God covers the earth, dispelling all darkness. The servants of evil will eventually meet their destruction. While God is present, he will not permit evil souls like you to tread this earth!” The Bishop of York held the silver holy chalice in one hand and a silver hexagram in the other. He raised his arms slightly as he intoned solemnly.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she watched this middle-aged man who looked like a quack.

The next second, the Bishop of York gestured widely and slowly poured the “holy water” at the entrance of the bar.

“I have sealed the servant of the devil within. Souls that have been corrupted by the devil have to be utterly destroyed with fire,” the Bishop of York said solemnly.

The knights from the Vatican instantly understood what the Bishop meant. They poured barrels of strong alcohol on the bar and then threw their flaming torches into it.

In a moment, the entire bar was engulfed by roaring flames!

Cheers continually rang from the crowd. They seemed to be celebrating the burning and destruction of the devil’s servant.

“Bishop of York, why did a black witch appear here?” A devout believer asked in terror.

The Bishop of York said, “For the past half a year, our Supreme League Kingdom has been attacked from all sides. Our enemy countries must have secretly made a deal with the devil to devastate our country with plagues and disasters, and they want to destroy His Majesty’s ambition of uniting this mainland.”

From the Supreme League Kingdom’s initial sweeping victories to today’s impasse, they had experienced innumerable invasions. The stalemate was gradually turning into defeat. This made all the people in this kingdom jittery.

To outsiders, the Vatican appeared to be impartial and independent. However, the Bishop of York and the others resided in the Supreme League Kingdom and had naturally benefited from the Kingdom. If the Supreme League Kingdom were to be destroyed, they would not be treated well.

In order to calm the people, for the past few years, they had blamed the devil for all the disasters and accidents that occurred in the kingdom.

This was the enemy countries persecuting them, not God punishing the kingdom.

The Vatican had always been the people’s greatest source of spiritual support, so since the Bishop of York said so, they believed him without question.

“Abominable devil, abominable black witch, burn her! We must burn her to death!” As tension in the group rose, the crowd’s shouting grew more intense.

“Who in this group has interacted with the black witch? The black witch is extremely malicious. Just casual contact is sufficient for her to corrupt you.” The Bishop of York spoke coldly as his gaze swept through the crowd.

Everyone quickly looked away. Even the burly man whom Ye Qingtang had thrown to the ground did not dare to speak, for fear of being implicated.
