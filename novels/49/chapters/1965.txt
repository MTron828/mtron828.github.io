Chapter 1966: Guests From All Places (1)

Ye You fell on the ground dejectedly, she seemed like she had lost all hope. Scraping at some blood with her fingertips, she started writing on the ground.

“You hate me and everything you did was to seek revenge from me!”

When Ye Qingtang saw those words, she smiled.

“You’re wrong, Ye You. I don’t hate you. You don’t deserve my hatred. I want you to die because you betrayed the Jiang family,” Ye Qingtang said.

She wasn’t lying.

She might have hated Ye You when she was in the First Mainland back then. However, after going through the catastrophic experiences in the First Mainland, her hatred towards Ye You had diminished.

Ye You was like a tiny stone that had been cast aside by her. Even if she was reminded of Ye You sometimes, she would no longer be triggered.

Ye Qingtang’s words left Ye You completely flabbergasted. In Ye You’s mind, she thought Ye Qingtang hated her to the point that she would do anything just to kill her, even posing as the Holy Lord of Shadows.

But it turned out...

She had such a small existence in Ye Qingtang’s life.

So small...

She wasn’t worth a mention.

Ye You shivered as she looked at Ye Qingtang. They belonged to different worlds. Ye You felt like a joke in front of Ye Qingtang.

They were of different levels long ago.

It felt even more awful for Ye You, even worse than if Ye Qingtang really did scheme against her and try to kill her.

Ye You had never bothered with Ye Qingtang. She didn’t even think of Ye Qingtang as a worthy opponent.

But now...

She realized that she had become the worthless one.

Ye Qingtang looked at the stunned Ye You. She wasn’t interested to know what Ye You was thinking. After putting on her mask, she stretched her arm out to grab Ye You’s head.

“I didn’t want to do this personally, since this is too filthy. But you must return whatever you owe to the Jiang family.” Ye Qingtang was cold and unfeeling as she looked at Ye You.

Ye You’s eyes widened, seemingly begging her younger sister, whom she had never cared about, to let her off.

But before Ye You could make any sound, Ye Qingtang crushed Ye You’s head. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Blood and brain matter splattered everywhere.

The seconds passed before Ye Qingtang slowly let go, watching Ye You slowly collapse to the ground. She didn’t feel a thing, no sadness, no happiness.

Then she lifted her eyes to look at Jiang Qin, who was barely breathing. A black flame lit up, burning Ye You and Jiang Qin into ashes.

Ye You would no longer exist in this world.

Two piles of ashes were the only remains left on the ground. Ye Qingtang glanced at them briefly before she walked out without any expression on her face.

Just as Ye Qingtang stepped out of the prison, she received news that a few groups of men had come to the Temple of Shadows to seek protection.

The Ancient You Clan had been expanding their influence recently. Quite a number of groups had joined their side and in return, the Ancient You Clan provided them with support. But that support provided had completely disrupted the dynamics of the Central Mainland.

Those who received support from the Ancient You Clan started beating their competitors down. The Central Dynasty also started going overboard, attempting to consolidate power and take over other dynasties.

But that was not all.

Those who came to seek protection from the Temple of Shadows were forced to escape because of these groups of people who stood on the Ancient You Clan’s side. They simply had nowhere else to go and when they heard that the Temple of Shadows was taking in clans, they quickly rushed over.
