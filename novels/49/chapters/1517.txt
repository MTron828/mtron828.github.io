Chapter 1518 Absolute Death 3

Ye Qingtang walked forward with caution. She saw a broken ridge under a giant waterfall.

Water flowed across the broken ridge. The area had been weathered by wind and snow over the years, revealing now only a tattered image of its former glory. Ye Qingtang walked over slightly and saw some strange characters on a tablet.

She had never seen those characters before.

While Ye Qingtang wanted to spend some time to figure out the words, she suddenly heard some noises.

“F*ck off. We wouldn’t be stuck here if not because of you.”

A roar suddenly rang. The tone was really fierce, but the voice sounded so pure and innocent that it totally changed the intention of the sentence.

There are other people here?

Ye Qingtang’s heart rate increased. She immediately led the little white tiger and the three Demonic Bears towards where the voice came from.

It seemed that the voice came behind the waterfall. Ye Qingtang climbed across the mess and dashed into the waterfall. She was really curious about the origin of the voice.

She was still being cautious and entered from the side. She then hid in the dark.

Ye Qingtang stood in the dark and looked towards the huge cave behind the waterfall with the light reflected from the water.

She was shocked by what she saw. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

In the dim cave, there was a group of children, who all looked very young. The oldest might only be five or six years old; the rest looked like two years old toddlers who just learned how to walk. There was even a baby who looked like he was just born. He lied on some broken clothes and waved his chubby limbs.

“...”

What is this situation?

Ye Qingtang was astonished by the group of children here.

How can there be so many children in the forbidden land of the Land of Infinite Demons? They can barely walk!

“The shrine was just there. Why did you have to destroy it? You’re the reason why we are all trapped here!” The pure but fierce voice came out again.

Ye Qingtang looked over and saw a three-or four-year-old child staring at another child in rage.

The angry child had pure red hair. He had a murderous look in his eyes, and he appeared to be ferocious and frowned.

However...

The expression on such a cute child really looked amusing.

The child who was scolded took a glimpse at the red-haired child. He had long and black hair that reached his shoulder. He folded his chubby hands in front of his chest and used his big eyes to look at the red-haired child with contempt. He spoke in a mature tone with his innocent voice.

“Did I ask you to come in?”

“YOU!” The red-haired child was so angry that his face was swollen. He raised his fist and swung at the black-hair child.

The rest of the children stared at the fight calmly. Their expressions looked way beyond their age.
