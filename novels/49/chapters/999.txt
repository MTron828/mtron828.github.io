Chapter 1000 Three Steps (3)

Realization dawned on the masses after hearing what the elders of the Long Family said.

Ye Qingtang even possessed a black-grade weapon. She must have a matching Dharma treasure on her!

If they possessed such a Dharma treasure, it was not impossible to injure a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord…

“Rui… Quickly notify your Grand Master…” Clan Master Long looked at his daughter, Long Rui, and said.

“Grand Master?” Long Rui’s eyes glistened upon hearing Clan Master Long.

Her Grand Master, also her father’s Master, was Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder. His martial skills had already entered the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm. If the Grand Master came, he would definitely be able to kill a Yin Yang Perfected Lord easily and, afterward, be able to get the Yin Yang Perfected Lord’s black-grade weapon and Dharma treasure…

Long Rui used her mind power immediately.

A moment later, Long Rui opened her eyes and exclaimed in delight. “Grand Master is in the vicinity!”

Her Grand Master was the previous Grand Elder of Qinglin Sect and was the most powerful figure in Qinglin Sect. He has been traveling around in recent times, and it was not strange for him to be nearby Lin Town.

“The previous Grand Elder of Qinglin Sect…” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It was only at this moment when everyone first realized that Clan Master Long actually had a Master at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm. That previous Grand Elder of Qinglin Sect had extraordinary skills and was a true Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

A moment later, space seemed to be twisted, and time seemed to have stopped.

A white-haired elderly suddenly appeared in the sky above Lin Town. As he walked in the air, it was as though an immortal had arrived.

The martial aura emitted by the elderly was extremely oppressive, causing everyone to lose their minds and instinctively wish to escape from this place.

“Grand Master!”

Long Rui raised her head and looked into the sky. Noticing the elderly, she broke out in elation.

Her Grand Master was Qinglin Sect’s previous Grand Elder and a true mighty Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

“Master!”

Seeing that the elderly had arrived, Clan Master Long immediately gave the elderly a full bow.

When Clan Master Long was young, he cultivated in Qinglin Sect and became a personal disciple of this elderly.

Upon seeing a true Yin Yang Perfected Lord, the members of the Ye and Duan Family were extremely silent and even slowed down their breathing, afraid that they would alarm this extraordinary presence.

“Grand Master…”

Long Rui looked at the elderly in the air and was about to say something but was interrupted by the elderly. “I already know about it. There’s no need to repeat.”

Subsequently, the elderly’s eyes landed on Ye Qingtang. After inspecting her for a while, his eyes shone. “You are Xuanling Sect’s disciple, Ye Qingtang.”

He was aware that Ye Qingtang obtained the Fiendcelestial Beast in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm and had seen Ye Qingtang’s wanted portraits before; thus, he could recognize her immediately.

Ye Qingtang did not refute him.

“I already know of your actions in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm… Young one, the Long Family shares a deep relation with me. What you did today is already a huge offense. However, if you hand the Fiendcelestial Beast over, I can pardon your sins. How about that?” The previous Grand Elder of Qinglin Sect looked at Ye Qingtang and said slowly.

“Fiendcelestial Beast…”.

Everyone was taken aback by what the elderly said. They had never heard of a Fiendcelestial Beast and did not know what kind of presence a Fiendcelestial Beast was.
