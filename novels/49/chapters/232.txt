“However, the essence and blood that ordinary people could provide were very limited. If that evil spirit wanted to resurrect quickly, absorbing the essence and blood from cultivators would be the best.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Apothecary smilingly as she raised her right hand and pointed at her own chest.

Her smile was so charming, but it never reached her eyes.

“Spirit Condensation Mountain Village had attached itself to the Xuanling Sect for years. If there was a tragic massacre in the mountain village, Xuanling Sect would definitely send disciples out here to personally investigate. The essence and blood of cultivators like us would be more nourishing than those three hundred dead souls… Isn’t that right, Village Master Wu?”

The Apothecary narrowed his eyes and did not respond.

Zhou Xuan faintly sensed a strange atmosphere, and uneasiness crept into him, though he faked a calm front. “Junior Sister Ye, the Blood Moon Sect has been exterminated for years. Your guess is not enough…”

However, before Zhou Xuan could finish his sentence, the Apothecary, who had remained silent all the while, suddenly let out a laugh.

“I am really surprised there’s such an intelligent outer sect disciple in Xuanling Sect.” His laughter was strong and powerful and completely not that of a washed-up old man. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Apothecary’s hunched back slowly straightened right before Zhou Xuan’s shocked eyes!

“I thought you were different since before. It seems, now, that you’re indeed different. You were not shocked by the Blood Plague and even headed to Spirit Condensation Mountain Village to investigate alone. Ye Qingtang, you’re really courageous.” The Apothecary did not intend to hide any further at that point as he suddenly raised a hand and tore away the human skin mask on his face.

Under the disguise, it was really the face of Spirit Condensation Mountain Village’s Village Master, Wu Chengze!

With just a look, Zhou Xuan’s mind buzzed constantly as though it exploded.

Never would he have expected that whatever crazy things that Ye Qingtang said would actually be true!

Wu Chengze was not dead, and the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village people were not dead as well. They only killed the citizens residing nearby Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, moved their corpses into Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, and pretended to be them. Then, they used the excuse of the extermination of a family to attract Xuanling Sect disciples here!

The truth pounded on Zhou Xuan’s mind like huge rocks.

He simply could not imagine how twisted and insane everything was, and even more so, he could not believe that Ye Qingtang saw through everything in just one day!

“You shouldn’t praise me. Your scheme is very shrewd. The extremely bloody scene in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village really had a terrifying effect. At least… my senior brothers were shocked by the tragedy you constructed and did not even intend to investigate in detail.” Ye Qingtang shrugged slightly.

The unusually tragic scene in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village had already attracted her attention for a long time.

According to her previous reasoning, over three hundred people all died in the hands of a familiar person. If it was done by someone they knew, the person would definitely be extremely cautious. Why would the person set the crime scene to be so bloody?

All of that was just a deceptive ploy. First, it could cover up the traces of blood when moving the corpses and second. It was to affect the judgment of others.

In such a bloody hell-looking place, how many would be able to check each corpse in detail with a calm heart?

“Furthermore, with the appearance of the Blood Plague, you all would have burnt the corpses away if not for Senior Brother Zhou’s evil designs. When all the corpses were burnt, the truth would never be uncovered.” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes slightly and fixed them on Wu Chengze after looking past the guilty Zhou Xuan.
