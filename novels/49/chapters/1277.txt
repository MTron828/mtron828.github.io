Chapter 1278: Shock (1)

No one saw what happened, they only sensed an aura of death encircling them.

The foremen who had been brandishing their metal whips and beating the Undead only saw a black blur. They collapsed to the ground before they knew what was happening. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The bodies on the ground were all sucked dry of their blood. Their bones were wrapped in dried and cracked skin while their eyes bulged out in death.

“The blood from these smelly grubs is really nauseating.” Ming Gu’s figure suddenly appeared before the Undead. The sharp nails on his small white hands were covered with fresh blood that dripped around his feet.

“You despicable grubs, how dare you be discourteous to Ah Yao… you really deserved to die.” Ming Gu’s usually innocent and smiling visage had completely disappeared and was replaced with the bone-chilling murderous air similar to that of Ming Wang.

Everyone from the Long Family was stunned when the small Undead suddenly struck.

They stared in shock at the dozens of bloodless corpses that littered the ground.

Dozens of men had been killed by this small Undead in the blink of an eye…

A trace of shock involuntarily surfaced on Long Yang’s face, but he quickly recovered.

“I’ve changed my mind. Little Undead, you’re rather special. Don’t worry, I won’t leave you in the mines. I’ll bring you to the arenas instead. You will certainly make a lot of money for me…” Long Yang narrowed his eyes that were filled with greed.

Long Yang ordered the guards behind him to charge forward and capture Ming Gu.

Ming Gu watched coldly as they rushed towards him. His eyes were filled with contempt.

He did not move, but a towering aura of death rushed out from him. The aura of death seemed to cover the entire mountain.

The charging Long Family guards were shrouded by the aura. It was as if they were suddenly gripped by some force. Their faces rapidly turned pale, and they fell, writhing, to the ground. It was as if someone was slowly draining the blood from their bodies, which flowed in front of Ming Gu and transformed into a crimson ball of blood.

Ye Qingtang felt very conflicted by the scene playing out before her eyes.

Ye Qingtang was hard-pressed to reconcile this murderous little fellow with the small, adorable creature who followed her everywhere, calling her “Ah Yao”.

She could only say…

The Long Family was truly unlucky.

They actually wanted to capture Ming Gu and bring him to some arena?

Wasn’t that a death wish?

Ye Qingtang inwardly mourned for the Long Family, but she continued to smile faintly.

Long Yang had not expected this tiny Undead to be so powerful. His subordinates could not even touch the corner of his robe!

The Undead were also shocked. They widened their eyes and looked at the powerful Ming Gu. A faint ray of hope appeared in their desperate eyes.

In the blink of an eye, all the guards were dead. Like the foremen, they had been transformed into bloodless corpses.

At that moment, Long Yang was rather pale. He had assumed that he could easily capture these three Undead, but he had not expected…

Things to reach this state.

“You… who are you?!” Long Yang looked at Ming Gu, who had sucked all the guards dry. He felt a chill permeate his body.
