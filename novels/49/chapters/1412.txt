1413 Confrontation 3

Beidou Demon Lord’s heart sank when he heard that number.

He had saved up that forty million spirit coins over the past few years, and a large portion of it was what his father left behind… This was already his limit.

However, the Bone of the Dragon Breath was too important to him. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Only by increasing his skills as fast as possible could he rescue his trapped father.

Although the Beidou Demon Lord felt that it was rather brusque, he could only muster his courage and look at Ye Xun who raised the bid. “This Bone of the Dragon Breath is very important to me. If you’re willing to offer it to me, I will remember your kindness forever, and my life will be yours in the future.”

Ye Xun cast a look at Beidou Demon Lord and snickered. “What a joke. Why would we need your damn life? This is an auction. If you want the item, use your money to auction for it. If you don’t have money, then stop harassing others. The highest bidder wins the item. Don’t you know the rules of an auction?”

Ye Xun only met the alien clans after coming to the Central Mainland, but she was extremely repelled by them out of instinct. Coupled with the Jiang Family’s status and Ye You’s influence on her, she had never paid any regard to these alien clans.

Beidou Demon Lord turned pale from Ye Xun’s rebuke, and he hung his head low as the surrounding mockery entered his ears.

However, Beidou Demon Lord could not be bothered with his reputation right now. The only thing he cared about was to obtain the Bone of the Dragon Breath so that he could become more powerful quickly …

He did not have much time left, and he had to rescue his father out as soon as possible…

“Ridiculous. Why are you at an auction when you have no money? Isn’t that right, Sister You?” Ye Xun looked at Ye You and asked.

Ye You tugged her lips indifferently as her eyes swept past Beidou Demon Lord with arrogance and belittlement.

The current Beidou Demon Lord was not yet famous, and he was merely a young ape. Who would take him seriously?

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes. Anger brewed within her silently as she looked at Beidou Demon Lord’s lonely and miserable expression.

How could her sworn brother tolerate such insults from outsiders?

“Is there still anyone who wants to bid? If not, this Bone of the Dragon Breath will belong to our Jiang Family.” Ye Xun announced while assuming the Jiang Family’s authority as her own. As she spoke, she mockingly cast Beidou Demon Lord a provocative glance.

No one else in the auction house dared to compete with the Jiang Family; thus, no bids were shouted. Yet, just as Ye You believed that she won the bid, a voice suddenly rang.

“Sixty thousand spirit coins.”

Everyone was dumbstruck. They looked in the direction of the voice but could only faintly see a tiny figure beside the huge Beidou Demon Lord raising her hand. However, Beidou Demon Lord’s frame was too large, and that girl’s face was completely covered in his shadow. Thus, no one could see her clearly.

Ye You frowned slightly as she did not expect anyone to dare to contest for the item with her. She immediately shot Ye Xun a look, who then understood what Ye You meant immediately and raised her hand.

“Seventy thousand.”

“Eighty thousand.” The girl in the shadows raised the bid immediately after Ye Xun.

“Damn it. Is this person bent on going against us? I did not see her bidding just now.” Ye Xun gritted her teeth.

Ye You’s brows remained furrowed. She took a look in that direction but could only see Beidou Demon Lord’s figure.

Why did she find this voice familiar?
