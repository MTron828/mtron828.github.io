Chapter 1022 To the Doorstep

The moment the two Yunxiao Sect elders entered Lin Town, their expressions changed slightly, and they were rather surprised.

For some reason, the Long Family, which had been a tyrant in Lin Town over the past two years, disappeared without a trace as though it simply evaporated into thin air.

Nonetheless, whatever that happened to the Long Family naturally had nothing to do with the two YunXiao Sect elders, and they merely found it strange.

“Elder Yin, look at that person!”

One of the elderlies frowned slightly as he pointed at the lady who was walking toward the Si Residence.

Immediately, the elderly who was called Elder Yin turned around and sized up that lady.

“Elder Gu, take out the portrait of Ye Qingtang,” Elder Yin said hurriedly.

Elder Gu took out the portrait. After unrolling the portrait, the person on it was none other than Ye Qingtang.

Once the two Yunxiao Sect elders confirmed that it was Ye Qingtang, they scoffed automatically.

They had been waiting in Lin Town for such a long time, and their target Ye Qingtang finally appeared.

“Sect Master is truly wise. He knew that Ye Qingtang would definitely return to Lin Town and ordered us to hide here and wait. Now, we have finally found her.” Elder Gu mumbled as he kept the portrait.

The two Yunxiao Sect elders did not see wrong; that lady was indeed Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang had just left the Ye Family when the two Yunxiao Sect elders, who were just returning to Lin Town, discovered her. Currently, Ye Qingtang was walking toward the Si Residence.

“Elder Gu, do you think we should strike now or wait a while?” Elder Yin asked when he saw that Ye Qingtang entered the Si Residence.

Elder Gu pondered for a moment and eventually answered. “Let’s wait first. The Fiendcelestial Beast is not following beside Ye Qingtang… If we act rashly and alert her now, our plan may backfire.”

The two people decided to wait for Ye Qingtang to leave the Si Residence and then strike at the Ye Residence. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Other than fearing that it would alert Ye Qingtang, capturing and forcing an answer out of her in the Si Residence might cause rumors to spread around. As such, they might as well attack her in the Ye Residence.

Just like that, the two YunXiao Sect elders waited outside the door of the Si Residence for at least four hours. Only at noon did Ye Qingtang step out of the residence slowly.

“It’s really strange…”

Elder Gu’s brows furrowed slightly. “According to logic, if such a nobody obtained a Fiendcelestial Beast, she would definitely keep it by her side all the time… But there is no sight of the Fiendcelestial Beast around her…”

Elder Yin responded. “Perhaps that lady left the Fiendcelestial Beast in the Ye Residence. There’s no hurry. We can take action once this lady returns to the Ye Residence. Are you afraid that we can’t find that Fiendcelestial Beast?”

Just a few steps after leaving the Si Residence, Ye Qingtang took a look behind discreetly.

While those two Yunxiao Sect elders concealed themselves very well, they were unable to escape Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“Yunxiao Sect…”

Ye Qingtang mumbled in thought.

Unexpectedly, Yunxiao Sect still remembered her even after such a long time.

After returning to Formidable Heavens Dynasty, Ye Qingtang had not even found the time to settle scores with Yunxiao Sect, but they came to her doorstep instead. How really considerate…

Ye Qingtang remained placid and simply did not care about those two Yunxiao Sect elders. She continued to head back to the Ye Residence.

In the dark, the two Yunxiao Sect elders saw that Ye Qingtang was returning to the Ye Residence and thus immediately headed in its direction.
