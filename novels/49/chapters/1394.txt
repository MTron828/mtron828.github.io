Ye Qingtang smiled on the inside.

Entering this Illusory Void was really quite worth it. Not only did her skills improve greatly, but it even eliminated Ming Wang’s suspicions toward her.

Ye Qingtang did not say much and directly went to rest. When she came out just now, she realized that those utilities and ancient texts that she brought back from that mainland were still in her space ring. She was just unaware if those cultivation techniques could still be used once she returned to the Central Mainland.

As Ming Gu watched Ye Qingtang leave, he blinked and stretched his hand out eagerly, wanting to follow her.

In the end, before he could take more than two steps, he was pulled back by Ming Wang.

Although they had the same height, Ming Gu instinctively curled his legs when he was held in the air by Ming Wang and looked at his older brother nervously.

“Ah Yao just came out from the Illusory Void. Do not disturb her or else…” Ming Wang narrowed his eyes slightly.

At this instant, Ming Wang’s way of addressing the Holy Lord of Shadows was changing silently.

From the Holy Lord to Ah Yao…

“I understand.” After being reminded by Ming Wang, Ming Gu realized that Ah Yao was always exhausted after returning from the Illusory Void and required rest extremely. In that critical period, they would not go to disturb her.

However, the Holy Lord of Shadows disappeared for many years, and Ming Gu forgot about these details.

Yet Ming Wang remembered them clearly.

…

After Ye Qingtang returned, she tried out the immortal cultivation techniques and realized that it was still usable. Although she had an additional method of cultivation, the energy she required for cultivation increased multiple folds as well.

Since she wanted to become more powerful to seize the First Mainland back, Ye Qingtang could not care about so much.

In the next few days, Ye Qingtang clearly sensed that some Elders and Guardians in the Temple of Shadows had a subtle change of attitude.

Those who strongly doubted her identity like Ming Wang before no longer doubted her anymore ever since she returned from the Illusory Void.

After all, only the Holy Lord of Shadows could activate that Illusory Void. In the thousands of years that she disappeared, Ming Wang and the eight tribe leaders attempted to activate it but to no avail. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Actually…

Ye Qingtang was also confused as to why she could activate the Illusory Void. Similarly, it was strange that she could wear the Nine Souls Ring previously.

“F*ck. You can’t be that Holy Lord of Shadows, can you?” The little white tiger glanced at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang stared at the little white tiger blankly. “…”

“The Holy Lord of Shadows is in the Skeleton Tribe that is part of the Undead Clan while I am a true human,” Ye Qingtang said helplessly.

“Oh…” The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang but did not say anything further.

It was in these few days where Ye Qingtang learned that Ming Gu and Ming Wang waited outside the door for five whole days without moving an inch ever since she entered the Illusory Void.

Ye Qingtang finally lived in greater ease as she was relieved that Ming Wang no longer suspected her. However…

Ming Wang was not the only one in the Temple of Shadows who suspected her. Although those Undead Clan tribe leaders whom she met before previously appeared respectful, Ye Qingtang could clearly sense their suspicious attitudes.

Fortunately, the eight tribe leaders did not visit the Temple of Shadows over this period of time.

Ye Qingtang just managed to have a few days of rest, but a group of uninvited guests suddenly knocked on the door of the Temple of Shadows.
