Chapter 665: The Broken Dimension Wall

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

To an extremely powerful person, this item was also something that they may meet by chance and was not something they could just ask for.

How blessed was that extraordinary lady exactly? As a cultivator of the First Mainland, it was already a miracle that she could obtain a Heaven-grade divine weapon. Afterward, she even allowed the Heaven-grade divine weapon to activate its spiritual wisdom and become a sword spirit…!

Since she knew that Ning Luo was a sword spirit, Ye Qingtang would naturally not dispute with him over anything, much less reason with him.

All sword spirits were bigoted.

Nothing but mad obsession! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

To a sword spirit, reasons were simply a joke. They only did what they liked, and no one could stop them. Especially for Ning Luo who personally witnessed the extraordinary lady’s tragic death, it was not an exaggeration to say that he had gone mad.

However, no matter what, she had to stop Ning Luo even if she had to risk her life for it.

Her foster father, everyone in the Ye family clan, and her martial siblings from Xuanling Sect and Falling Sky Valley were all innocent…

They must not be buried with the Ning Luo’s anger, much less bear the consequences of the sins committed by their predecessors.

Seeming to have seen through Ye Qingtang’s thoughts, Ning Luo said without emotions, “Ye Qingtang, there is a familiar bloodline aura on you… It’s also from the Fourth Domain. I don’t wish to hurt you, and you shall not think of stopping me.”

“So you want to break the Dimension wall and let that ancient clan from the Central Mainland come here and obtain that extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode? Everything was caused by them. What has it got to do with the ordinary beings living on this mainland?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Those ancient clan people… They will also pay a price that is a hundred times more miserable… When I’ve truly grown and become more powerful.” A flicker flashed across Ning Luo’s eyes.

From Ning Luo’s expression, Ye Qingtang could ascertain that he, a Heaven-grade divine weapon that had activated its spiritual wisdom and turned into a sword spirit, would definitely not let off anyone who once harmed that extraordinary lady.

He planned to use those people from the ancient clan to wipe out this mainland. Afterward, when he was fully grown, he would personally annihilate that ancient clan!

“Ye Qingtang, I said that we would still meet again in the future… This sentence is still effective.” Ning Luo’s lips curled up. “However, before this, I can give you a chance. You said that this mainland is innocent. Since that’s the case, do something then… Show me how long that faith you talked about can last for.”

“What do you mean?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ning Luo with a slight frown.

“Currently, I have enough strength to completely destroy the Dimension Wall protecting this mainland…” As he spoke, he turned into a shadow and combined into one with the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

Swoosh!

The Ice Frost Divine Sword immediately surged into the air. An almost invisible sword light passed through the limit of the mystic realm and slashed towards the sky in the outside world.

At the same time, the mainland, regardless of inside or outside the mystic realm, seemed to quake wildly.

Apart from Ye Qingtang, no one else would know what exactly happened.

The Dimension Wall… was destroyed by Ning Luo…

In at most a few breaths’ time, the Ice Frost Divine Sword returned to the ground again. “Ye Qingtang, given my current powers, I only destroyed two-thirds of this Dimension Wall. That ancient clan in the Central Mainland will not be able to find this place in a short period of time. So… you still have some time. Let me see how exactly your Fourth Domain bloodline will truly awaken… Let me see how you can stop those powerful figures from the ancient clan of the Central Mainland.”
