A few days later, Ni Shang’s injuries slowly healed, and Fei Ying finally heaved a sigh of relief.

However, Ye Qingtang remained in her room in these few days and never stepped out. Apart from asking Fei Ying to leave a few buckets of hot water at her door every two days, she did not have any orders and even settled her meals in the room by herself.

During this period of time, Ji Xianyuan heard that Ye Qingtang was about to enter the Life and Death Ring and came a few times but was blocked by Fei Ying, who said that Ye Qingtang was not receiving any guests.

Days passed, and the Life and Death Ring matter circulated around the entire inner sect.

The Life and Death Ring was not the same as normal rings since they were really battling with their lives.

Although there was such a rule in the inner sect, only a few dared to enter the Life and Death Ring. In the past three years, Ye Qingtang was the only disciple who initiated a Life and Death Ring challenge, and her opponents were as many as four people.

As everyone was absorbed in discussions, it was as though Ye Qingtang disappeared from everyone’s sight, and almost no one saw her in any Martial Arts Hall.

“Could Ye Qingtang be scared already?”

“If it were you, wouldn’t you be scared? Do you dare to go through such suffering? I think it’s still not too late for her to regret now.”

“I heard that Song Junqiu and the rest did not have any special reaction these few days.”

“What reaction should they have? All four of them are more skilled than Ye Qingtang, and any one of them could play Ye Qingtang to death. Do they still need to train hard? Don’t joke anymore.”

Seeing that there was only a day left to the Life and Death Ring, everyone could not help but be curious about whether Ye Qingtang really dared to take on the challenge the next day.

In the courtyard, moonlight scattered over the ground in the dark night. Ni Shang, whose face was still bruised, walked to Ye Qingtang’s room with a tray of dishes in her hands and saw Fei Ying guarding outside the door.

Fei Ying shook his head.

Ni Shang could not help but be worried.

“Miss has already cultivated in seclusion for ten days and never left her room. What should we do? I am all to blame… If not because of me, Miss would not need to enter whatever Life and Death Ring with those four bastards.” Guilt was written all over Ni Shang’s face. In the eyes of inner sect disciples, attendant girls like them were no different from servants, and it was already lucky to not be mistreated or lambasted. No one had thought that the inner sect disciple they followed would stand up for them.

After regaining consciousness, she heard from Fei Ying that Ye Qingtang was to enter the Life and Death Ring.

One could imagine how shocking Ye Qingtang’s decision was to Ni Shang.

“I’m so useless. I can’t do anything for Miss and can only worry.” Ni Shang bit her lips. A thought suddenly struck her, and she turned to face Fei Ying. “Fei Ying, if Miss doesn’t enter the Life and Death Ring tomorrow, do you think she would be safe?”

Fei Ying was slightly stunned. “The Life and Death Agreement is already signed. If Miss doesn’t enter, she would probably be the ridiculed by everyone in the future. Given Miss’s character, she will not be able to bear it.”

Ni Shang pursed her lips, and a resolute expression flashed across her eyes. She suddenly handed the tray of dishes into Fei Ying’s hands.

“Take care of Miss.” With that, she prepared to leave.

“Ni Shang, what do you want to do?” An ominous thought emerged in Fei Ying’s heart, and he quickly pulled Ni Shang’s wrist.

Ni Shang took a deep breath and explained. “I cannot let Miss be involved in this. This matter was started because of me. How could I stand around and not do anything? I will look for them. I know what they want. As long as I beg them, perhaps they will let Miss off…”
