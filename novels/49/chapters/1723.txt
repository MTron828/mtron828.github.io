Chapter 1724: Frozen Ice Fields (4)

Even after the heavy impact, Little White Tiger managed to drag itself up and gazed at the unconscious Ye Qingtang.

It was all cold around Ye Qingtang. Her wound had turned purplish from the start of gangrene. She had expended all her energy and was unable to maintain her body warmth.

In the Frozen Ice Fields, a person’s energy expenditure would be over 10 times higher than normal. This kind of temperature would be fatal to anyone.

Little White Tiger blew a stream of warm air and quickly pulled Ye Qingtang into its soft furry belly. It used its own body warmth to raise Ye Qingtang’s temperature.

Ye Qingtang slowly came to and felt waves of intense pain radiating from her shoulder. But a series of moist warmth helped to lessen the pain.

When she opened her eyes, she saw her enlarged Little White Tiger carefully licking her wound, trying to prevent the flesh around the wound from turning gangrenous from the extreme cold.

“...”

Seeing her awaken, Little White Tiger breathed a sigh of relief.Ye Qingtang’s heart warmed when she saw how carefully and gently the little white tiger was using the tip of its tongue to lick her wound, so that the sharp barbs on its tongue wouldn’t hurt her.

“I am fine now.” Ye Qingtang lifted her arm with effort to stroke Little White Tiger’s fur.

Everything in this mystic realm seemed to be vying for her life the moment she stepped into it. It had just been a short time since she entered the realm but she felt like she had endured a long bloody battle.

Retrieving an elixir from her space ring, Ye Qingtang was thankful that it was of some use. Although Dharma treasures were useless here, elixirs were still effective.

Snow and silence engulfed her surroundings. Apart from herself and Little White Tiger, Ye Qingtang could not see any forms of life.

“The Frozen Ice Fields, the Scorched Hot Lands... Cemetery of the True Gods...” Ye Qingtang murmured to herself. She had yet to even step out of the Frozen Ice Fields. She didn’t dare to imagine the horrors that awaited her in the Scorched Hot Lands and the Cemetery of the True Gods.

First was Sang Feiyu, then Qin Mo. In addition, there was Wu Xiao who was swallowed by the Ice King. The top ten from the Martial Arts Championship had now been pared down to only three persons.

Ye Qingtang didn’t know whether the rest were still alive, or... have they already “died” in these Frozen Ice Fields.

“Shaobai... you’d better be okay.” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Her greatest worry was Jiang Shaobai’s safety.

As Little White Tiger was very big now, it was too conspicuous in such a dangerous place. Ye Qingtang dressed her wound with a simple bandage and swallowed her elixir. She then made Little White Tiger small again and carried it as she flew up into the sky.

If she was lucky, she might be able to spot Jiang Shaobai’s figure on the way. She had no time or energy to bother about the rest. Her heart constricted whenever she thought of how that cheerful, goofy kid might die here.

Harsh winds howled as white snow continued to fall. Ye Qingtang forged ahead as she tried to locate Jiang Shaobai. But she saw nothing. Frozen mountain ranges meandered all around and silence permeated the air. This place was like a dead zone, there were no signs of life at all.

Halfway along, Ye Qingtang saw a long sword stuck into a block of ice. The sword was dripping with fresh blood and a severed hand was still grasping tightly onto the handle. That patch of red blood was exceptionally garish and eye-catching against the snowy backdrop.

With just one glance, Ye Qingtang recognized that the sword belonged to Zhan Rao. But there was no sign of him anywhere except that severed hand and that lone, long sword.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
