Chapter 1670: In Trouble (2)

Ye Qingtang shook her head. Although Jiang Yiran’s ability to make enemies had rendered her speechless, she had not taken it to heart. Ye Qingtang had also been shocked when Jiang Yiran prepared to kneel publicly in order to settle the matter, which was why she had immediately moved to stop him.

Regardless of the conflict within the Jiang family, they must remain unified against outsiders. How could she allow a Jiang family youth to kneel to someone else?!

Jiang Yanyun did not say anything else, but just left the restaurant.

“Tut tut, Jiang Yiran has certainly gotten into huge trouble this time. He even needs Jiang Yanyun to help him out of this mess,” Jiang Yisheng said with feeling.

“Jiang Yanyun was already going to be one of the top ten. Challenging Baili Xuanyun is a given,” Jiang Shaobai remarked lazily. Even without this incident, Jiang Yanyun’s target would still be the same.

“Ai, now that you’ve said it, that makes sense.”

Jiang Shaobai glanced at the other in disdain and did not say anything else.

But Ye Qingtang felt that matters were not so simple. Of course Baili Xuanyun knew Jiang Yanyun’s intentions. But Baili Xuanyun’s attitude had been extremely arrogant. Either he was unaware of Jiang Yanyun’s abilities, or he had a trump card that assured him of victory. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Because of Jiang Yiran’s affair, news of Jiang Yanyun and Baili Xuanyun’s match reached the upper echelons of the Jiang and Baili families. If Jiang Yanyun lost, the Jiang family would never be able to hold its head up in the presence of the Baili family again.

“Younger Sister Ruxue, why do you still look so unhappy?” Meanwhile, Baili Xuanyun was speaking to the unhappy looking Mu Ruxue.

Mu Ruxue said, “Elder Brother Xuanyun, why did you let that Ye Qingtang off like that? Who cares if Jiang Yanyun wins or loses. I just can’t stand Ye Qingtang’s face.”

Mu Ruxue was clearly displeased with how Baili Xuanyun had handled the matter.

In response, Baili Xuanyun laughed and coaxed her, “Younger Sister Ruxue, that’s not true. I’ve already said that I will only let Ye Qingtang off if Jiang Yanyun beats me. If he loses, Ye Qingtang will have to abide by the agreement and disfigure herself.”

Mu Ruxue’s eyes brightened at Baili Xuanyun’s words.

“Elder Brother Xuanyun, are you certain you will win?”

Baili Xuanyun laughed and said, “Of course. Younger Sister Ruxue, don’t worry. I will certainly win in three days time. Then I will make Ye Qingtang publicly disfigure herself. Won’t that satisfy your hatred? Not only will we reduce the Jiang family’s reputation to shreds, we will destroy the face that you dislike, killing two birds with one stone. Won’t that be wonderful?”

When she heard that, Mu Ruxue looked much happier.

“Elder Brother Xuanyun, you must keep your word.”

“Of course.” Baili Xuanyun smiled. “Jiang Yanyun is the most powerful member of his generation in the Jiang Yanyun. The Jiang family has no one else to send into the arena, so naturally they will certainly lose in this round.”

“Elder Brother Xuanyun, you’re very wise,” Mu Ruxue said with a smile.

Baili Xuanyun was inwardly feeling smug. He had seized the opportunity to sweet-talk Mu Ruxue.

“Younger Sister Ruxue, don’t worry. I will tell everyone else in the Baili family to vote for you in this year’s Martial Arts Championship’s beauty rankings.”

The smile continued to blossom on Mu Ruxue’s face. This was what she deserved, after all. The Baili and Mu families would certainly vote for her, not to mention the others. Her looks were outstanding, why worry that she would lose? It was just that she didn’t like the things those trash were saying.

To please Mu Ruxue, Baili Xuanyun made sure to check the beauty rankings after the youths of both families had voted.
