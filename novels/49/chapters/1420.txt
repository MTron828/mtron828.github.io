1421 Who Exactly Are You 2

“Ye You is a lady of the Jiang Family. Who dares to harm her?” Elder Xu said coldly.

“You are right, Elder Xu.” Ye Xun nodded with extreme obedience.

Elder Xu handed two talismans to Ye You and Ye Xun.

“Ancient You Clan probably will not be able to reach us. Use this talisman to return to the Jiang Family first. As for that Ye Qingtang… I will get rid of her. I will meet with you back at the Jiang Family.”

Delight flashed across the eyes of Ye You and Ye Xun after hearing what Elder Xu said.

“Elder Xu, there’s no need to exhaust yourself. I will ignore her at most.” Ye You brushed away the delight on her face silently and acted as though she put the interests of the whole before everything else.

“She’s just a little brat. Killing her won’t take much effort. Ye You, you must remember that you are the Domain Monarch’s granddaughter now. No one can let you suffer from injustice.” Elder Xu looked at Ye You affectionately.

The Domain Monarch was of old age now. He had great accomplishments in his early years and was now at the age to dote on his children and grandchildren. As such, he specially sent people to the First Mainland to bring back his lost granddaughter.

Although Ye You was born in the First Mainland, she was very obedient and sensible. Moreover, she was rather gifted and received a lot of affection from the Domain Monarch.

“I’ll have to trouble you then, Elder Xu.” Ye You bowed gracefully.

After a slight nod, Elder Xu flew out immediately.

As Ye You watched Elder Xu leave, the warmth in her eyes dissipated instantly, and it was replaced with iciness. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Rest assured, Sister You. With Elder Xu around, Ye Qingtang will not be able to fly even if she has wings,” Ye Xun said.

…

On the other side, Ye Qingtang sprinted furiously with the little white tiger and Beidou Demon Lord. If not for her fear that she would be too large of a target if she flew in the sky, she would have escaped by flight.

But even so, they were still caught up.

“Where do you all wish to escape to?”

Elder Xu’s figure suddenly appeared in their way.

He caught up so quickly?

When Ye Qingtang saw Elder Xu, she could not help but despise the weak support of those people from the Ancient You Clan for only stalling so little time.

“Do you all still wish to live after offending the Jiang Family? Hand the Bone of the Dragon Breath over obediently, and I will give you two fast deaths.” Impatience filled Elder Xu’s face. There was something extremely strange about the Ancient You Clan incident, and he needed to report to the Jiang Family quickly. He had no time to waste with these two people.

“We can’t escape anymore. Little sister, you…” Beidou Demon Lord wanted Ye Qingtang to leave first, but Ye Qingtang cut him and said, “Since we can’t escape anymore, let’s fight it out with him!”

Without waiting for Beidou Demon Lord to decline, Ye Qingtang leaped up and dashed forward with her sword.

Whether she fled or not, the outcome was still death!

She might as well give it her all. Perhaps, she might be able to make it out alive.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang had already made an attack, Beidou Demon Lord pounded the ground furiously. With a roar, his huge frame jumped up and lunged at Elder Xu.

“You all are overconfident.” Elder Xu had a cold expression. His eyes swept across Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord, and a scarlet glow diffused around him gradually. Without moving his body, that red light suddenly spread explosively and sent the incoming Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord flying away.

The skills of a Heavenly Venerate were not restricted in this Central Mainland.

Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord landed on the ground and spat a mouthful of blood.

“Let’s begin with you first.” Elder Xu’s cold gaze landed on Beidou Demon Lord. It was a look of despise from the Domain Monarch’s clan toward the Alien clan.
