Chapter 2629 That Unparalleled Strike (6)

An indescribable pressure instantly enveloped the Heavenly Emperor. At that moment, the crowd present had baffled expressions. 10th Heavenly Tribulation had dissipated. Why did the Heavenly Emperor seem to have suffered some kind of heavy blow?

Apart from the Heavenly Emperor, there was no one else in the sky. They did not see anyone attack the Heavenly Emperor.

“What happened? That muffled sound just now…”

“Am I seeing things? Was the Heavenly Emperor just defending himself? Could it be that the 10th Heavenly Tribulation hasn’t dissipated?”

Others might not have seen it, but Ye Qingtang saw it clearly. The shadow behind the thundercloud had suddenly attacked the Heavenly Emperor. If the Heavenly Emperor had not reacted in time, the consequences would have been dire.

The Heavenly Emperor’s actions proved that he did not detect the blood-red eyes of that shadow behind the thundercloud.

Even an Immortal Emperor level practitioner like the Heavenly Emperor could not see it…

Ye Qingtang pondered in her heart and grew increasingly astounded. Where did that shadow come from and what was the meaning of its existence? Just one strike from it was already a huge threat to the Heavenly Emperor.

However, before Ye Qingtang could think further, a blood-colored light appeared around the shadow. In the next second, it waved its huge fist and punched the Heavenly Emperor again.

“Boom!”

The loud boom echoed in all directions. This time, even Ye Qingtang did not have the time to shout out a warning.

The shadow’s speed was really too fast. It was so fast that it exceeded the limits of Ye Qingtang’s understanding. Even though Ye Qingtang had a pair of Heavenly Dao Eyes, it was difficult to capture the shadow’s movements.

The Heavenly Emperor’s body plummeted. In midair, he spat out a large mouthful of blood. “Swoosh!”

The Heavenly Emperor, who was falling, used the blood on his body to condense a blood pearl. His eyes flickered with a terrifying cold light as that blood pearl struck the space between the eyebrows of the shadow.

“What’s going on? Who is the Heavenly Emperor fighting?!” “Did the Heavenly Emperor lose…?”

At that moment, the crowd below was in disbelief. Other than the Heavenly Emperor, they could not see anything else. Apart from Ye Qingtang, no one knew what was happening to the Heavenly Emperor.

In the next second, the blood pearl condensed by the Heavenly Emperor exploded between the brows of the shadow. A monstrous flame burned and created steam in the surrounding

air.

“Did the Heavenly Emperor discover that shadow?”

Ye Qingtang frowned and pondered.

After a while, Ye Qingtang shook her head quietly. The Heavenly Emperor did not seem to have discovered the shadow. He had just instinctively attacked in the direction of the shadow.

The shadow wriggled its body frantically as if the Heavenly Emperor’s strike had injured it. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Soon, the shadow disappeared into the void. Meanwhile, the Heavenly Emperor fell into the deep forest in the distance.

Seeing that, Ye Qingtang instantly flew into the sky and towards the direction where the Heavenly Emperor had fallen.

Ye Qingtang was not the only one. Several other powerful auras also rushed from afar towards the Heavenly Emperor.

There were many Emperor level experts in the vicinity. Many of them had been hiding in the dark and watching. They had been waiting for the Heavenly Emperor to fail the 10th Heavenly Tribulation.
