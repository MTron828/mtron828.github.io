Chapter 2107: Sea Clan (1)

Elder Hua and the others were watching Ye Qingtang’s every move.

Ye Qingtang knew that she would never be the match of the people at the Temple of Paragon and there was no way she could escape. She decided to just stay at the Floating Island and watch the children cultivate.

With Ye Qingtang’s guidance, the children quickly figured out the solutions to the problems they were facing. Ye Qingtang would never believe that these little children were this talented if she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

It was astounding. She only needed to go through it once and they could instantly comprehend her words. It took no time at all for them to acquire the skills. Putting aside their physical figures, the children surpassed everyone else by leaps and bounds.

No wonder...

It was no wonder that they were chosen by the Temple of Paragon. With their talent, they would be impressive once they’re all grown up.

However...

This wasn’t enough to enter the Temple of Paragon.

She looked at the standards of the Temple of Paragon before recalling the others... Ye Qingtang suddenly realized that it wasn’t surprising that the Heavenly Wolf Sect was easily destroyed.

If they were to send just any one of the children on the Floating Island to the Crimson League or the Heavenly Wolf Sect, they would put in all their resources to nurture the child.

However, looking at how the Temple of Paragon handled them...

Ye Qingtang looked at the little children that were just left on their own on the Floating Island, and she couldn’t help but to admire the Temple of Paragon’s powers.

The Temple of Paragon probably owned many other places that functioned like the Floating Island.

There were probably countless versions of them.

People from the Second Domain would die to form a connection with the Temple of Paragon. If only they hadn’t thought that she was a reincarnated Holy Lord, Ye Qingtang would have been glad to foster a relationship with such great powers.

Ye Qingtang was pondering over it.

Meanwhile, the elders in the Temple of Paragon gathered in the main hall. Out of the elders that hid in the portraits, there was someone familiar.

The Fox Demon, who was the Guardian wearing a fox mask, sat down on one of the chairs.

“This was sent over by the bat spirit.” The Fox Demon opened its hand, showing a water ripple token in his palm.

When Elder Hua and the others saw the water ripple token, their expressions changed.

“The Sea King Token? This was sent by the King of the Sea Clan?” Elder Bai’s brows knitted.

The Fox Demon nodded.

“The Sea King oversees the oceans of both domains. However... the Sea King doesn’t seem to be interested in fostering a good relationship with the Temple of Paragon. All these years, not a single person from the Sea Clan came. Why did the Sea King suddenly send the Sea King Token?” Elder Hua gave a suspicious look.

The Sea King Token represented the Sea King’s wishes. It must have been the Sea King’s intention.

As the King of the oceans for both domains who wi wielded a great amount of power, why would he suddenly send the Sea King Token to the Temple of Paragon?

“The Sea Clan doesn’t have anything to do with the Temple of Paragon. Have all of you forgotten about the deal between our Holy Lord and the Sea King?”

Once the Fox Demon said that, everyone recalled the incident from tens of thousands of years ago...

The Sea Clan lived in the ocean and they rarely interacted with the powers living on the land. However, how could anyone disregard the powerful Sea King who lived in the ocean?
