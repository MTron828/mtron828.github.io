Chapter 2208: Invitation (1)

Qin Feng shot forward first, directly confronting Qin Xuan.

Lei Yan, Nangong Lie and Jing Ze also charged forward.

The bunch of teenagers got into a messy brawl.

“Little Senior Sister, leave first!”

Qin Xuan was the most powerful while Qin Feng was one level below him. It was very difficult for Qin Feng to engage him and he was soon on the losing end after just a few moves.

The other two youths were also quite powerful. Even though they were outnumbered by the trio of Nangong Lie and his gang, it was an even match.

But it would no longer be an even match the moment Qin Xuan intervened.

The group soon realized things were not looking good for them.

Qin Feng was sent flying off with a single smack by Qin Xuan.

Just as Qin Xuan wanted to turn around to pursue Mu Ziying, he realized that she had already disappeared with that puppet of hers.

“Qin Xuan, you got guts. You dare to attack us on campus. Aren’t you afraid that the teachers will hear of this and send you to the discipline hall!” Nangong Lie glared at Qin Xuan viciously as he reprimanded.

Qin Xuan’s face stiffened on hearing the words “discipline hall”.

He immediately had a change of heart and smirked. “Qin Feng, just you wait and see.”

He then left with his companions.

Lei Yan and the others were relieved. Their powers were considered the weakest in the Netherworld Academy. Meanwhile, Qin Xuan’s two companions were quite powerful. Even in a three-against-two scenario, they were not at a disadvantage at all.

“Damn, those scoundrels were really vicious. I must settle this score with them one day!” Lei Yan held his bruised eye, gritting his teeth in pain.

One of Nangong Lie’s cheeks had swelled up and he looked very pathetic. Jing Ze fared the best but he also had a gash at the corner of his eye.

Qin Feng looked at those teenagers. “You guys didn’t need to...”

“Brother, what kind of nonsense are you spouting? We are all students under Boss. We are a family.” Nangong Lie grinned.

Qin Feng kept silent but his eyes gleamed pleasantly.

Sometimes, the friendship between youths could be very miraculous. They were at that age where one was full of life and vigor, without much inclination toward lies and deception.

“You guys better think about what you are going to say to Boss tomorrow...” Jing Ze muttered in a low voice.

The teenagers exchanged looks, their faces all bruised up...

...

For the moment, Ye Qingtang was at the Vice-President’s but he did not try to make things difficult for the youth.

The next morning, Lei Yan and the rest went to find Ye Qing. The Vice-President had wanted to see how Ye Qingtang’s teaching progressed.

In the end...

Those teenagers were standing there in a row, their faces all bruised.

The Vice-President was stunned. Apart from Mu Ziying and Yun Chen, Lei Yan and the rest were all roughed up.

Ye Qingtang: “...”

They must be doing this on purpose!

“Boss, let me explain. We wanted to have a friendly sparring session yesterday but forgot to hold back...” Nangong Lie had already thought up an excuse.

Ye Qingtang surveyed them with an incredulous look.

The Vice-President cleared his throat.

“Boss?” He glanced at Ye Qing.

Why did this form of address sound so kick-ass?

Ye Qingtang felt like killing herself. Did these brats come especially to dig her an early grave?

The Vice-President gave a slight shake of his head as he looked at Ye Qing. After instructing the students to continue their cultivation, the Vice-President went to sit inside his study.

Teacher Luo Sheng was standing at the side, watching the Vice-President’s somewhat disappointed expression. “Vice-President...”

The Vice-President raised his hand. “Perhaps I was wrong in my estimation.”

Teacher Luo Sheng sighed softly. The wretched appearance of those brats today was truly dumbfounding.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com
