Chapter 1069 Falling Sky Valley (2)

“It must be my Peerless School’s Yang Lord,” the Peerless School warden said with affirmation, though he was very confused as well. Why did their Peerless School’s Yang Lord suddenly come to Falling Sky Valley?

“Go. Let’s welcome the Yang Lord together,” said the Peerless School warden.

Then, everyone rose and walked out of Falling Sky Valley.

Outside Falling Sky Valley, Ye Qingtang stood far away. Several Falling Sky Valley senior executives and disciples were already beside her, and their attitudes were extremely respectful.

A Yang Lord was an unparalleled powerful figure of this mainland, and a Yang Lord’s visit was a great honor to Falling Sky Valley.

However, the Falling Sky Valley senior executives were extremely curious as to why a dignified Yang Lord would be at Falling Sky Valley.

A while later, Peerless School’s warden and disciples, Perfected Xuanchen, Full Moon Peak Master, and the rest walked over briskly.

Everyone was surprised when they saw Ye Qingtang. No one had expected that not only was this Yang Lord a lady, she was also so young. Looking from her appearance, she seemed to be in her teens only. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Of course, regardless of her age, no one dared to belittle a Yang Lord.

“This…”

The Peerless School warden sized up Ye Qingtang in surprise. This lady was not from their Peerless School but was indeed an authentic Yang Lord…

There was only a handful of Yang Lords on this mainland, but why did a Yang Lord suddenly appear out of nowhere…

“Greetings, Yang Lord!”

Perfected Xuanchen, Full Moon Peak Master, and the rest immediately bowed to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Dare I ask for your name and origin?” The Peerless School warden asked.

“Who are you?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Peerless School warden and said coldly.

“I am a warden of the Peerless School!” The Peerless School warden said with a haughty expression.

“Get lost.” Ye Qingtang shot him a cold look and said rather impatiently with a frown.

“You…”

The Peerless School warden was instantly enraged after hearing Ye Qingtang. He was a warden of Peerless School and represented the entire Peerless School when outside, yet this lady dared to tell him to get lost?!

So what if she was a Yang Lord? Their Peerless School had four Yang Lords!“Yang Lord, this is a Peerless School envoy. I believe you aren’t foreign with the Peerless School… There are four Yang Lords in the Peerless School…” Full Moon Peak Master, Xuanyuan Yi, looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

“What are you?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes landed on Xuanyuan Yi.

Ye Qingtang clearly remembered that before she left Falling Sky Valley, Xuanyuan Yi was after her life. Now that she was back, she had to settle this score with Xuanyuan Yi as well.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang behaved this way, Full Moon Peak Master did not dare to utter another word. Given his cultivation realm, the Yang Lord before him could easily take his life with just a thought if she wanted to. As such, Xuanyuan Yi did not dare to continue speaking

Xuanyuan Yi looked at Ye Qingtang discreetly. and his brows were deeply furrowed. For some reason, he felt that this unrivaled Yang Lord before him was a little familiar-looking, as though he had seen her somewhere before, but he could not recall where.

“Yang Lord, may I know if you have any instructions for gracing Falling Sky Valley with your presence?”

Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

“I passed by coincidentally and wanted to take a look at Falling Sky Valley,” Ye Qingtang said.
