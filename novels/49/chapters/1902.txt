Chapter 1903: Temple of Shadows (3)

“Ah Yao...” Ming Gu stared at Ye Qingtang with stunned eyes.

“Elder sister...” Jiang Shaobai shuddered as he crouched by Ye Qingtang’s side.

Ye Qingtang felt like...

...she was coming down with a headache.

“Ming Gu, I was the one who brought him here.” Ye Qingtang took a deep breath to compose herself.

“What...” Ming Gu looked like he had suffered a grievous blow.

“This person is very important. You cannot hurt him.” Ye Qingtang was very worried that Ming Gu might end up killing Jiang Shaobai with just one careless smack. After all, Jiang Shaobai’s mental age was that of a toddler now.

“Very important...” Ming Gu staggered backward in shock, staring at Ye Qingtang with eyes full of grievances. He clutched at his chest as if a thousand arrows were piercing his heart. He looked exactly like a wife who just found out that her husband had a mistress by the side.

You are having an affair!

Ye Qingtang, “...”

“It’s a long story. This person has information that I need. But he got injured and became mentally impaired. I need to cure him before I can retrieve the information.” Ye Qingtang quickly recited the explanation she had already prepared.

Ming Gu remained teary-eyed as he stared at the “unfaithful and heartless” Ye Qingtang.

On the other hand, Ming Wang remained as impassive as always. Observing everything with a cold expression, he studied Jiang Shaobai’s childish manner with narrowed eyes.

Ming Gu was about to speak again when Ming Wang cut in coldly. “Stop your nonsense.”

Ming Gu glared at his elder brother.

“The Holy Lord has her reasons for doing what she does. I will have to lock you up again if you continue behaving so unreasonably.”

The stern words left Ming Gu completely cowed.

Staring at Jiang Shaobai, who was still clinging onto Ye Qingtang, there was no way Ming Gu was willing to be locked up at a time like this.

Ye Qingtang heaved a secret sigh of relief in the face of Ming Wang’s calm.

“His injuries are very serious. Ming Wang, get someone to tend to him. See if he can be fully cured.” Ye Qingtang told Ming Wang.

“Got it.” Ming Wang nodded.

Ye Qingtang wanted to hand Jiang Shaobai over to Xue Fu for treatment, but Jiang Shaobai was so unsettled by everything that he refused to leave Ye Qingtang’s side. He would cry like a toddler the moment anyone tried to pry him away.

Ye Qingtang’s heart constricted at the sight.

She would rather have the sharp-tongued and lazy Jiang Shaobai of the past, instead of this simple-minded fool.

“Never mind. Send someone to my room later to treat him.” Ye Qingtang couldn’t bear to see Jiang Shaobai in this manner. Besides, Ming Wang and the rest didn’t know of Jiang Shaobai’s background. All she had told them was that he was someone with important information.

Ming Gu’s eyes lit up with rage at Ye Qingtang’s words.

“No! No! No! He cannot stay with Ah Yao!” Ming Gu objected vehemently.

Ming Wang shot his brother a cold look and Ming Gu immediately shrank back.

What was this situation? Ye Qingtang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. She passed on some instructions before leading Jiang Shaobai back to her room to rest.

With tear-filled eyes, Ming Gu tagged along behind them. At the sight of Jiang Shaobai entering Ye Qingtang’s room, he gnashed his sharp little teeth together.

Jiang Shaobai was gravely injured and hadn’t made a full recovery yet. On top of that, he had suffered a big fright from Ming Gu’s intimidating behavior. As a result, he fell asleep soon after collapsing on the bed.

Ye Qingtang summoned Ming Wang.

“Ming Wang, help me investigate something,” Ye Qingtang said.

“As you wish, Holy Lord,” Ming Wang replied. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Go find out if there has been anything strange going on in the various Central Mainland clans during this recent period. Inform me immediately if you find anything.” Ye Qingtang hadn’t specified the situation with the Jiang family as she did not want to reveal too much.
