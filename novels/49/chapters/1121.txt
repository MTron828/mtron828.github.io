Chapter 1122 Kill 3

Without waiting for Ye Qingtang to speak, a black-robed elderly heard Ling Yan’s voice, and his expression changed instantly. “Eternal Dynasty’s… Ling Yan?!”

Ling Yan’s devilish laughter sounded. “You Ancient Clan, nice to meet you all.”

“You… Wait, on our way here… I saw a battleship from Eternal Dynasty…” The black-robed elderly frowned deeply. “Could it be that… you were the one who sent people… to destroy our water supply?!”

“That seems to be the case. If I’ve caused any troubles to you all, I’m extremely sorry,” Ling Yan said with a soft chuckle.

The You Ancient Clan senior executives were infuriated. They had no feud with Eternal Dynasty, yet this Ling Yan secretly sent people to guard the route that they would definitely pass by and destroy their battleships that carried their water supply. Had their battleships not be destroyed, how would their skills return so slowly!!

“Could it be that…” A You Ancient Clan senior executive’s expression changed greatly. “Are all the water sources nearby poisoned by you?!”

“Yes.” Ling Yan laughed. “Your water supplies were destroyed, and you all will have to search for new water sources. I laced poison in all 123 water sources in the surroundings… Unless all of you powerful figures don’t need to consume water, it is definite that you all will be poisoned. There’s no other way out.”

“Ling Yan… you are so evil. What feud does our You Ancient Clan have with you?!” A black-robed elderly shouted furiously.

“Feud? There’s none,” replied Ling Yan.

“Since there’s no feud at all, why do you want to lay a trap and harm us?” The black-robed elderly had a dark expression.

“Why…” Ling Yan laughed coldly. “Of course it’s because… you all caused Miss Ye to feel troubled.”

Ye Qingtang was stunned by what Ling Yan said.

“Ling Yan… what does your Eternal Dynasty count as… Eternal Dynasty will definitely be annihilated after offending You Ancient Clan! You will regret this!” The black-robed elderly was enraged.

However, Ling Yan laughed and said, “I’ll thank you all in advance then… I am being excluded by the imperial power in Eternal Dynasty. If You Ancient Clan is willing to clean up and even annihilate the Eternal Dynasty for me, that would be the best.”

“You…”

The You Ancient Clan senior executives were flushed. They were actually fooled by a prince of the Eternal Dynasty!

“Miss Ye, if you’re not going to attack now, then when will you?” Ling Yan said suddenly.“Aren’t you chatting happily with them? I didn’t wish to disturb.” Ye Qingtang shot a look at the voice transmission stone.

“No matter how much I talk to others, it cannot be compared to half a sentence with you.” Ling Yan chuckled.

“…” Shen Qianshu stared blankly at the voice transmission stone. Why can this Ling Yan continue on with any topic… Did he mean that…

Without uttering another word, Ye Qingtang activated the black-grade weapon in her hand and slashed the remaining black-robed elderlies.

Ye Qingtang joined forces with the little white tiger, and in no time, everyone from the You Ancient Clan in Sky Stars City was killed.

The You Ancient Clan definitely never expected that in such a short span of time, one out of their ten teams was already completely wiped out. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“F*ck. We’re rich… Let’s take all of their space rings away… We will split them half-half!” The little white tiger said hurriedly.

It had just grown and needed to replenish a large amount of energy. The space rings of those You Ancient Clan powerful figures would definitely have plenty of rare treasures…
