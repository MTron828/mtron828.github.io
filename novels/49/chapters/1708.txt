Chapter 1709: The Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm (1)

On the second morning, Ye Qingtang and the others from the top ten arrived at the entrance of the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm.

Jiang Shaobai stood naturally beside Ye Qingtang. The incessant yawns coming out from his mouth made no secret of his half-awake state as he stood there with his eyelids heavy.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept around. Other than Jiang Shaobai and her, there were eight other people.

Five of them were from the top ten of last year’s championship while the other three were new.

“Please wait a little, the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm will open soon,” said the old man in charge of sending them into the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm.

“Brother Qiu Chen... I’m scared of this mystic realm....” said Qiu Ci, who was especially petite. Her face filled with fear and unhappiness as she looked at the entrance of the mystic realm, which was about to open. She subconsciously hid behind Brother Qiu Chen who was from the same clan as her. She felt a great sense of unease towards the unknown dangers facing her and the eight other people from the other clans.

Meanwhile, Qiu Chen looked at the nearing Qiu Ci and frowned unabashedly. He pried away her fingers clutching at his shirt and scolded her impatiently, “Go back to the Qiu family if you’re so scared. Don’t embarrass our clan.”

Qiu Ci’s eyes filled with tears as she got scolded. She was just trying to get closer to Qiu Chen, only to be hurt deeply by his cold gaze. She could only stand uneasily at one side, looking at the ground as she hunched her shoulders up.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept over Qiu Ci. She had paid attention to Qingtang’s final battle, and would never have believed it if she hadn’t seen it for herself. This girl, who couldn’t even raise her voice in front of people, had fought so viciously that even Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

Barely anyone who had battled Qiu Ci could get off the arena by themselves. If they were lucky, they would escape with heavy injuries, and if they weren’t so lucky, would have died in the arena.

“Elder Sister Qingtang, I’m so scared...” Jiang Shaobai suddenly mimicked Qiu Ci.

Ye Qingtang was getting a headache from all his antics, but merely stroked his head to reassure him.

Qiu Chen scoffed as he saw such a different response to his similar situation, but the shunned Qiu Ci raised her head in fear as she looked at Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai with a hint of envy in her eyes.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I wonder what we’re going to see in the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm,” Wu Xiao from the Wu family muttered, his eyes full of curiosity.

“What’s there to be worried about? The Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm is different every time. So what if you knew what it looked like in the past? It’s going to be different when we enter today. Rather than worrying about this, shouldn’t you just be prepared? Whether it’s easy or hard depends on your capability.” Zhan Rao crossed his hands behind his head as he surveyed the five new people.

“Elder Brother Zhan, you’ve been inside before and understand the mystic realm more than us. Is there anything you can tell us?” Wu Xiao asked modestly.

But Zhan Rao had no patience to give them any pointers. “There’s nothing much to say. The strong will have great luck inside while those who aren’t good enough will just be facing their death if they enter. Actually, don’t even talk about luck. Just leaving with your life is good enough.”
