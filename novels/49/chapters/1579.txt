Chapter 1580 Two Star Constellation 2

After her experience in the one-star constellation, Ye Qingtang was familiar with entering the world of the constellations. After experiencing heaven and earth spinning around her once again, Ye Qingtang smelled the strong scent of fish.The smell mingled with other odors to form a nauseating stench.

Ye Qingtang slowly opened her eyes. Before her was a gloomy and narrow alley. It was getting dark, and the scene before her was shrouded in gray.

Ye Qingtang subconsciously waited for a message from this world to surface in her mind.

But she waited for a long time without any message appearing.

“Erm? Why are you waiting here?” The God of Nature, who had transformed into a child, floated out from behind Ye Qingtang. “This time, you did not enter anyone’s body. You can enter this world in your own body.”

The God of Nature seemed to guess why Ye Qingtang was waiting and slowly explained it to her.

Only then did Ye Qingtang study her clothing and discover she was wearing her original clothes. The space ring on her finger was also familiar.

“You need not have any particular identity to enter the world of constellations. You may enter in the body of someone from that world and take over their identity, or you may enter as yourself.” The God of Nature slowly explained.

If she entered the world in someone’s body, she would directly gain the original owner’s knowledge of the world. If she came as herself, she would have no understanding of the world and would have to slowly explore it.

Ye Qingtang did not feel that there was much difference between the two situations. In fact, she thought it was more convenient to enter as herself.

Just as Ye Qingtang was preparing to question the God of Nature about her current mission, she suddenly heard the clatter of a carriage.

Lights flickered in the entrance of the dim alley. Although night was falling, there were still many people milling around.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the people passing through the alley, and a look of surprise surfaced in her eyes.

“Go take a look at this world first.” The God of Nature was in no hurry to issue Ye Qingtang with her mission. Right now, Ye Qingtang needed to familiarize herself with the world she was in.

Ye Qingtang slowly walked out of the dark alley. What she saw caused her to widen her eyes.

The pedestrians hurrying along the street were all tall with deep-set features. They looked completely different from the people that Ye Qingtang had met previously. Most of them had golden hair and blue eyes or brown hair and green eyes. They had prominent noses and high cheekbones, and all of them were very tall.

“An alien race?” Ye Qingtang could not help but feel curious when she saw this group of people with strange hair and eye colors. But when she examined them closely, she noticed that they did not have the aura of an alien race. The aura that surrounded them was exactly the same as that of the human race.

Human race?

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. A troop of heavily armored knights was riding their tall horses across the street. Their armor looked peculiar as if they were made entirely out of metal and protected their body completely. Their helmets also completely veiled their features so that nothing was exposed.

A carriage was being escorted by the heavily armored knights. As they crossed the street, a carriage suddenly appeared. On it hung a drawing of a heavily armored man with a pair of wings.

He looked somewhat like the Winged People, but the structure of his wings was different.
