Chapter 2063: Possession (1)

The Grand Elder’s skin started plumping up rapidly as his eyes glowed red. He looked extremely unusual. Then in the blink of an eye, his body had returned to its normal, terrifying self.

And with that...

His gaze turned to Little Luo Xue who was lying on the altar.

Ye Qingtang rushed as quickly as she could over to them, only to see the Grand Elder opening his mouth wide as a dark aura flowed from his mouth continuously into Little Luo Xue’s forehead.

“He wants to possess him.” You Qiong was shocked to see this.

If the Grand Elder managed to possess him successfully, Little Luo Xue’s power would belong to him, and there would be nothing else they could do.

As he worried, Ye Qingtang flew up into the air. A cold light illuminated her ice sword as she swung it directly towards the Grand Elder.

The Grand Elder, who was busy trying to possess Little Luo Xue, hadn’t expected them to defeat the stone Buddhas so quickly.

The cold light completely severed the connection between the Grand Elder and Little Luo Xue.

The possession was stopped by force and the Grand Elder seemed to have taken a huge blow. He took a few steps back as fresh blood spurted from his mouth.

“Scoundrel!” The pathetic-looking Grand Elder’s eye glowed red. He had almost taken the little boy’s body as his!

The Buddha statues had been made with little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode and were extremely powerful in the Central Mainland. How were they destroyed this quickly...

He never would’ve thought that Ye Qingtang had used the sword that the extraordinary lady had given her to destroy the buddhas.

The Ice Frost Divine Sword had followed the extraordinary lady her whole life and was imbued with the strong Spiritual Abode. It was the only weapon in the Central Mainland that could destroy the Buddha statues!

“Who are you? Why are you fighting against the Ancient You Clan!” The Grand Elder gritted his teeth and glared at Ye Qingtang as he held his throbbing chest.

She didn’t speak. Seeing that the Grand Elder was injured, she raised her hand to follow up with another blow.

A red light suddenly appeared in the Grand Elder’s hand, and her disguise broke under the red light.

Ye Qingtang’s beautiful face was revealed to the Grand Elder.

With just a glance...

The Grand Elder stood rooted to the ground.

“Holy Lord of Shadows? It’s you?! The Grand Elder’s eyes widened in surprise. He had never imagined that the person impersonating Elder Mo would be the Holy Lord of Shadows herself!

Seeing that her disguise had been broken and the Grand Elder staring terrified at her, she composed herself and took advantage of the situation.

“It’s been a long time since we’ve last met,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Grand Elder’s face was extremely dark. “No wonder... No wonder you could defeat the statues...”

Ye Qingtang’s face was completely devoid of emotion but she knew the truth about the situation. The only reason they had defeated the statues was because of Ning Luo’s swordplay.

She could feel that the Grand Elder’s will had weakened, probably because the person standing in front of him was the ‘Holy Lord of Shadows’.

He knew that there was no way he could win in this situation.

After all, the Holy Lord of Shadows was the most powerful person in the Central Mainland. The only reason the Grand Elder wanted to possess Little Luo Xue’s body was so that he could become even stronger.

He had also previously received reports that Little Luo Xue and Ming Di had been fighting as equals.
