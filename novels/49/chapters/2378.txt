Chapter 2379: To Compete Or Not To Compete (1)

A slight nod showed that Jin Qianyang was very satisfied with his disciple’s answer.

Lei Yan looked at Jin Qianyang and Yin Kongluo, who had no intention of supporting Xing Rong. Jin Qianyang had even beat up Xing Rong. He immediately had a good impression of this master-disciple pair.

“I was still worried that Jin Qianyang would help Xing Rong. I didn’t expect that he would be so fair. He’s not a bad chap after all.” Lei Yan looked at the rest, expecting them to concur. But he realized that the eyes of his companions had turned sharper and harsher.

What was going on?

“It must be blissful to be so naive…” Nangong Lie couldn’t help sighing at Lei Yan’s foolishness.

“What do you mean by that? Aren’t I right? He’s conceding that Xing Rong lost, right?” Lei Yan was confused.

“When did you hear them admit to losing?” Nangong Lie gave a cold laugh.

Lei Yan frowned slightly.

While Yin Kongluo’s words were quite polite, unless you were a fool, no one could fail to hear the true meaning behind his words. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Yin Kongluo said that he didn’t care for one piece of spirit jade. He was confident of winning more at the Inter-Academy Competition. On the other hand, spirit jade was extremely precious to the Netherworld Academy, and they desperately needed every single one they could get.

Was this conceding defeat?

This was the scornful condescension displayed by a powerful practitioner to a weaker party. He was hinting that the Netherworld Academy could only get spirit jades from under-the-table methods like chess gambling.

The Netherworld Academy would never be able to get a single spirit jade in the Inter-Academy Competition.

Qin Feng and the rest heard the ridicule in those words. Lei Yan was the only one foolish enough not to detect it.

He even thought they were good guys.

Qin Feng and his group were fuming but couldn’t say anything. As Ye Qing was present, they had to leave it up to him to settle.

Right from the start, Jin Qianyang had not even spared a single glance at the Netherworld Academy folks. It was like they were completely invisible.

Although Ye Qingtang knew what Qin Feng and the others were thinking, she would not do it. Without another word, Ye Qingtang led Lei Yan and the others away.

Qin Feng and his group were taken aback by her actions. They felt that this was not at all like Ye Qing.

But still, they followed him.

After Ye Qing and his team left, Jin Qianyang also led Yin Kongluo away. Before Yin Kongluo left, he instructed several Heaven Dome Academy students to carry the unconscious Xing Rong back. He then caught up with Jin Qianyang.

“Xing Rong’s chess skills are pretty good, his defeat today was just an accident. Master, please don’t be too harsh. There’s no harm done to let someone else win just this once.” Yin Kongluo smiled.

Jin Qianyang glanced at Yin Kongluo.

“Chess gambling is not the right way to go about things. Practitioners should fight it out with their real skills, and not make use of these side channels.”

Yin Kongluo said respectfully, “Master is right. The Netherworld Academy has already fallen and even their teacher has to personally participate in chess matches to win spirit jades. I am afraid they themselves are aware that it would be difficult for them to get any in the Inter-Academy Competition. I can still afford to give them that one spirit jade.”

Jin Qianyang was very pleased with Yin Kongluo’s confidence.

As Jin Qianyang said, chess gambling was a shady practice and was not something true powerful practitioners should take part in. To think that the Netherworld Academy had now fallen so far that they had to rely on such nefarious methods to get spirit jades. They were worlds apart from the Heaven Dome Academy.

“There are significant changes to the team competition this year. I am very confident in your martial arts abilities, but you must put much effort into this team competition. Since we are going to win, we must make it a spectacular win.”

“Yes!”
