Chapter 457: Great Harvest (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Apparently, the medium-grade spirit stones only worked for cultivators at Martial Qi Level Two. If one stepped into Martial Qi Level Three, the amount of energy that the medium-grade spirit stones could provide would be very limited. Even Ye Qingtang required at least a thousand of medium-grade spirit stones to advance her cultivation level.

Ye Qingtang walked forward and stopped beside the corpse of the Yunxiao Sect disciple.

She found another five medium-grade spirit stones from the Yunxiao Sect disciple and a silver color token.

“Yunxiao token…” Ye Qingtang sized up the token and muttered.

The Yunxiao token belonged to Yunxiao Sect disciples only, and it represented their identity.

Ye Qingtang was slightly attracted to the token.

The token might be useful in the future.

Ye Qingtang then kept the token into her space ring.

The harvest she had this time was way beyond her imagination.

Previously, the best result she thought was to acquire the Spirit Life Flower.

However, besides the Spirit Life Flower, she collected seventeen medium-grade spirit stones from Yi Tianchou and the Yunxiao Sect disciple. They were equal to seventeen thousand lower-grade spirit stones!

She did not spend much energy, so the things were like given to her for free.

After packing up everything, Ye Qingtang did not move far. She chose a remote cave nearby and sat down.

She then took out all the medium-grade spirit stones.

Seventeen spirit stones were covered by the primordial qi and floating in the air.

Large amounts of spirit energy suddenly diffused out of the medium-grade spirit stones and lighted up the entire cave.

Ye Qingtang spent one whole night to absorb the spirit energy from the spirit stones.

Next day morning when the sun just arose, the darkness in the cave was replaced by light.

Rays of lights shone into the cave, and Ye Qingtang opened her eyes slowly.

The seventeen medium-grade spirit stones that were floating in the air previously had lost their initial luster. The scraps were useless now as all the spirit energy was absorbed by Ye Qingtang.

“Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two…” Ye Qingtang could feel her primordial qi flowing through her body. Joy filled her eyes.

The effects of the medium-grade spirit stones were better than she expected. They strengthened her martial ability at mid-stage of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two. She was very close to the late-stage.

“If I had more medium-grade spirit stones, I may be able to reach the Third Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Three soon…” Ye Qingtang murmured to herself.

However… Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The medium-grade spirit stones were too precious. Seventeen of them could be considered as a large number as they were equal to half a year’s pay for the Xuanling Sect elders.

More spirit energy would be needed to break through when she reached the Third Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Two, and a dozen of medium-grade spirit stones were far from enough.

Ye Qingtang did not bother about the spirit stones anymore. She decided to leave the scraps at the side but…

When she just gathered the scraps together, the lightning dragon that was sleeping in her arms suddenly poked its head out. It shook its head and seemed to be looking for something.

The lightning dragon had been exhausted since the incidence at the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. Ye Qingtang found some inferior-grade spirit stones to supplement it with energy, but the results were not great. Thus, it always slept in her arms. How come today it was so active?

Ye Qingtang was curious. The lightning dragon had found the breath that excited it. It gazed at the scraps of spirit stones and slipped out of Ye Qingtang’s arms. It swung its body and walked towards the scraps. When it reached the pile of scraps, it suddenly opened its mouth and swallowed all seventeen of the leftover medium-grade spirit stones.
