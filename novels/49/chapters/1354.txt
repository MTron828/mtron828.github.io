Chapter 1355 Su Qiao 3

The lady was the General’s wife and Su Qiao’s stepmother. She was trying to convince General Qiao to send Su Qiao away.

General Qiao frowned, and his expression darkened.

The general’s wife observed the concern that General Qiao had and took a glance at the girl standing behind her. The girl was called Su Lin’er. She was born by the general’s wife and was the third young lady in the General’s residence.

“Father, I think mother is right. My elder sister is getting crazier, and it has become a topic for discussion in the city. The young lady from the Hou family asked about that when I was out yesterday.” Su Lin’er was on the same line as her mother and wanted to chase Su Qiao out of the General’s residence.

“Su Qiao is my daughter. Though she is crazy now, if I chase her to another residence, others may bad-mouth behind my back. It’s not appropriate…” General Qiao shook his head. He did not care about Su Qiao’s life at all. He only bothered whether others would say something about him if he chased his daughter out as it might affect his future.

“We are just sending Su Qiao to another place for her to recover, not chasing her out. It’s suitable for her there as it’s quiet. I know you care for Su Qiao but think about Lin’er and Mo’er. Mo’er just entered the prime minister’s residence, and Lin’er is at the age for marriage soon. Su Qiao’s craziness might affect Mo’er and Lin’er’s future if we continue to keep her here. They are your daughters as well. You need to consider their reputation.” The General’s wife expressed her concerns.

She was not guilty at all as if she did not know what resulted in Su Qiao’s craziness. Her daughter Su Mo’er took away Su Qiao’s fiance and humiliated Su Qiao in front of everyone.

“This…” General Qiao frowned. He raised his head and saw Su Lin’er’s wronged expression and made his mind.

“Tomorrow, ask someone to take Su Qiao to the other residence then.”

Both the General’s wife and Su Lin’er were delighted. Su Qiao was crazy now. If she were sent to the remote residence, no one would know anything even if she died there.

“I shall prepare for that,” the General’s wife said slowly.

General Qiao nodded.

The moment the General’s wife stood up, a few servants looked flustered and rushed in.

“Master… Lady, the Eldest Young Lady is crazy again! You should go and take a look!”

“She’s crazy again?” General Qiao’s expression darkened. He felt slightly guilty deciding to send Su Qiao away, but now, it could no longer be avoided.

His reputation would be ruined if she continued to be crazy.

“Master, Su Qiao cannot be here anymore. I think she should be sent away as soon as possible. How about today?” The General’s wife said.

“Prepare the carriage to send our Eldest Young Lady to the other residence now.” General Qiao did not bother to say anything else.

However, a figure walked in slowly from the entrance of the front hall.

General Qiao and the rest looked towards the figure and realized that she was the crazy “Su Qiao”, and she walked into the front hall.

“Who allowed you to come here? If others see you, my reputation will be ruined. Get back right now!” General Qiao frowned and commended. He did not want anyone to see his crazy daughter.

“Someone restrain Su Qiao right now. She may hurt others when she gets crazy!” The General’s wife gave orders to the servants as she looked at Ye Qingtang in disgust.

A few strong servants immediately walked out and wanted to restrain Ye Qingtang with rope.

However, before they could get near her, an invisible wave of air came out from Ye Qingtang’s feet. Everyone was thrown out by the wave of air and landed heavily on the ground.
