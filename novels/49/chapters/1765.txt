Chapter 1766: This Taste Is To Die For (1)

“What are you doing here? Who asked you to bring these little demons here?” the demon was unhappy about the trouble the little fiendish demons had caused.

The camps in the valley were all fighting non-stop right now, with the adult fiendish demon’ lives all at stake. What were these little demons causing trouble for?

“It... it was a Great Sage who asked us to patrol...” a scared little fiendish demon said.

The fiendish demon frowned slightly as it’s eyes swept over Ye Qingtang in the ‘human skin’. It seemed as though she was the leader. However, his gaze turned disdainful as he looked at her slender body.

By now, Ye Qingtang was already used to the disdainful gazed from the adult fiendish demons. But this demon turned around suddenly, grabbed a heart from one of the defeated enemy demons and threw it at Ye Qingtang’s feet.

“Come over here and eat with us.”

How could they possibly have such a weak adult fiendish demon in the eastern camp? If not for the human skin, he would’ve thought that she was a little fiendish demon.

Ye Qingtang looked at the bloody heart beside her leg as her eye twitched. The demon’s heart looked like a piece of meat that had been rotting a long time. It was so disgusting that she felt like throwing up just looking at it.

But the little fiendish demons beside her drooled as they looked at the heart.

To them, flesh from the same species was the best. It tasted good and made them stronger, and was the food they looked forward to the most. But even though the little fiendish demon wanted to eat the heart, they knew that they were not qualified to do so.

Only the adult fiendish demons could eat the flesh of demons.

Ye Qingtang’s heart felt even heavier under the gaze of the envious little fiendish demons.

Could she not eat it?

This heart was going to be harder to swallow than the worm Ming Gu had given her.

As Ye Qingtang looked at the fiendish demons devouring flesh from their own kind, her stomach churned. But she was afraid that she would draw suspicion to herself if she didn’t eat the heart.

Should she eat it?

Ye Qingtang felt that she had no choice. She could only suppress her disgust, pick the bloody demon heart up from the ground and bring it to the edge of her mouth...

Damn, the smell was revolting!

Ye Qingtang had no idea how the demons could look so satisfied while eating this disgusting thing. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

But she had to eat it no matter how much she didn’t want to. She could only close her eyes, steel her heart and bite down.

As the rotten taste of the meat burst in Ye Qingtang’s mouth, it took all she could to suppress her cry.

God knows how she was going to find the courage to swallow this...

Ye Qingtang summoned all the will she had in her body to keep it down. She gritted her teeth and swallowed it, feeling as though she was going to pass out.

However...

“What’re you still standing there for? Get over here and eat now. How are you going to be of use in the battle after tomorrow if you don’t eat?” A huge demon said to Ye Qingtang who was standing rooted to the ground and staring palely. He scooped up a piece of the demon’s brain and handed it over to Ye Qingtang.

He was only trying to help but Ye Qingtang felt like she couldn’t take it anymore. But under the gaze of all these demons, she had no choice if she didn’t want to blow her cover, She walked over as the little fiendish demons looked on enviously, took the gray mess of brain and swallowed it, bite by bite.
