The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince looked at the middle-aged man and the white-haired elder. His eyes emitted a cold glint, but he remained calm on the surface, his face full of smiles.

Someone from the Dragon Emperor Clan had destroyed the body of his subordinate right in front of him and even destroyed his divine soul. This was equivalent to giving him a slap across the face.

While the old man’s death was not worth mentioning, as the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince, he represented the reputation of the entire Sky Vault Sect.

But of course, the First Prince of the Sky Vault Sect would not say anything either. After all, the Dragon Emperor Clan was an extremely ancient clan in the entire Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and possessed abundant resources. The current Sky Vault Sect could not compare to them. There was no need for them to become enemies with the Dragon Emperor Clan over a woman and a dog.

To be able to become the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince, strength was one thing, but intelligence was another. Especially in such a situation, the only thing the First Prince could do now was to endure it and tell their Paragon what had happened. As for what the next step would be, it was something that their Paragon needed to consider and decide. It was not up to him.

“Dragon Emperor Clan, it’s getting late. I haven’t completed the task assigned to me by our Paragon yet. I have to return to the Sky Vault Sect to report to him, so I’ll take my leave first.” The First Prince smiled at the white-haired elder and cupped his fists respectfully before turning to leave with his men.

All the while the white-haired elder remained silent as his gaze landed on Ye Qingtang. After sizing her up for a long time, he said to the middle-aged man beside him, “Aren’t you going to send off the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince?”

The middle-aged man smiled and gestured respectfully at the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince. “Your Highness, let me escort you on your way out.”

“Thank you.” The First Prince nodded calmly.

After seeing off the Sky Vault Sect, the middle-aged man returned to the white-haired elder’s side. The middle-aged man looked at the white-haired elder and asked softly, “The Temple of Paragon and the Devil Cloud Sect have not returned yet. Do we need to…”

The white-haired elder was expressionless when he heard that. He said indifferently, “That’s a matter between the Temple of Paragon and the Devil Cloud Sect. It has nothing to do with the Dragon Emperor Clan. Who cares what they do?”

Ye Qingtang overheard the conversation between the middle-aged man and the white-haired elder.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised. From their conversation, those from the Temple of Paragon people also came…

However, what kind of force was the Devil Cloud Sect? It seemed to have some conflict with the Temple of Paragon.

“Miss Ye, I wonder if you have time to come with us.” The white-haired elder’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

“This…” Ye Qingtang was hesitant. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

To put it bluntly, Ye Qingtang did not want to go to the Dragon Emperor Clan at this point.

Ye Qingtang still did not know how her mother Di Jiuyuan had disappeared and what the situation was like in the Dragon Emperor Clan. It was not good for her to rashly head over to the Dragon Emperor Clan before everything was investigated.

Seeing Ye Qingtang’s hesitation, the white-haired elder said softly, “You don’t have to worry, Miss Ye. I’m just inviting you to be a guest at the Dragon Emperor Clan. You just have to take a look. I guarantee that your pet and friend will definitely not be in any danger.”

“Pet…”

The big yellow dog in Ye Qingtang’s arms appeared annoyed.
