Chapter 2703: Destruction (2)

Indeed, for an individual to completely wipe out the Fourth Domain alone, it was hard to believe. Even Ye Qingtang found it difficult to comprehend what kind of existence could completely wipe out the Fourth Domain.

At that moment, the black figure in the sky scanned the area below, ignoring what the High Monk said.

In the next second, an unbelievable scene happened. A fiery light shot out of the black shadow’s eyes. Immediately, a huge python appeared from the light.

“What kind of demon beast is that?!”

Lan Shan was shocked and filled with disbelief.

The huge python was more than a hundred thousand feet long. Its body was so huge that it was indescribable. If an ordinary person were to walk along this python, it would probably take more than ten days from head to tail.

Just the python’s head alone was about the size of Ye Qingtang’s hometown.

“Heaven-Devouring Beast?!”

Zhou Yun’s expression changed as he exclaimed.

Zhang Chi said thoughtfully, “I was once the Imperial Advisor of the Supreme Heavenly Kingdom and have done some research on ancient demons. It is just as Senior Brother Zhou Yun said. According to the records, this beast is indeed like one of those Heaven-Devouring Beasts. In the early stages, it will be about 30,000-meters long. It will grow 30,000 meters every 1,000 years. 10,000-year-old Heaven-Devouring Beasts can reach up to hundreds of thousands of feet, then after that, their growth will slow down… the longest it can grow is millions of feet. Its body is boundless and can devour the world with one bite.”

“It really is a Heaven-Devouring Beast…”

“This is the first time I’ve seen a Heaven-Devouring Beast.”

Zhang Chi stared at the indescribably large python in the sky. “It’s really strange. Heaven-Devouring Beasts only exist in records, no one has ever seen them before. Back then, we always believed that Heaven-Devouring Beasts were just a fairy tale and not real… Could it be that there really are Heaven-Devouring Beasts in this world…?”

In fact, there were many records of ancient demon beasts that had never been verified. Apart from the Heaven-Devouring Beast, there were many invincible and powerful demon beasts, such as the Bizarro Demon and the Swirling Demon Beast.

According to legends, the first ancestors of these monstrous beasts did not have a physical body but could transform into any beast or even human form. Moreover, they would possess the strength of the creature they transformed into. They might be even stronger, but those had always been mere legends.

Meanwhile, for Fiendcelestial Beasts, their existence had been confirmed. For example, Ye Qingtang’s little white tiger and Ling Yan’s little azure dragon.

“What kind of existence is that black shadow? It can even seal a Heaven-Devouring Beast in its eye…” Lan Shan asked.

“Not to mention that black shadow, even this Holy Lord and that High Monk have far exceeded our comprehension,” Ye Qingtang said softly.

In this world, the body of an Immortal Emperor was supreme. However, even the strongest Immortal Emperor was not comparable to these people. No one could determine the level of the black shadow. It was an existence that could seal a Heaven-Devouring Beast with a single eye.

“This trip was really not wasted. Even if we didn’t get anything, at least our worldview has been expanded…” Wan Rong said. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

At that moment, the crowd realized what it meant by there will always be someone better than you out there.

Before Lan Shan could say anything, the Heaven-Devouring Beast suddenly let out a deafening roar.
