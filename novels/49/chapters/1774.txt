Chapter 1775: The Battle Between The Top Three (1)

The battle between the fiendish demons was not something that Ye Qingtang could participate in. Even if she was brought to the battlegrounds, she and a few other weaker demons were positioned at the back to prevent the enemy from sneaking an attack from the behind.

The demon wars continued endlessly across the wide valley. The grudge between the eastern and western demons had been brewing for a long time and it felt like they were going to settle it once and for all now.

“Those western scumbags brought over eight war beasts. Damn them! We will fight them to the death!” Ba wiped off the fresh blood from his face and roared at the battlefield before charging straight into it.

Ye Qingtang cast a sweeping glance across the bloody battlefield. Countless demon corpses were strewn across the valley and the thick, evil stench permeated the entire area. It was like a scene from hell.

The fighting was so intense that the fiendish demons didn’t even have time to devour their enemies’ corpses. Countless roars echoed through the valley.

Ye Qingtang could see those 18 gigantic war beasts from afar. They charged about the battlefield in a frenzy.

“They think they can turn the tables with just a few war beasts?” A cold voice suddenly piped up from amongst the fiendish demons. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The eastern camp’s Great General raised his hand and sent out several blasts of demon aura, instantly blowing up those war beasts into pieces.

The fiendish demons in the eastern camp roared in jubilation as the blood of the war beasts rained down upon them.

“The Great General has made his attack! Look at those western fools. Let’s see if they can continue acting so smug!” The eastern fiendish demons were all pumped up with adrenaline at the sight of their Great General.

For this particular battle, not only was Ye Qingtang brought over, even the little fiendish demons had also tagged along. The fighting between the two factions had risen to a feverish pitch.

It seemed that the appearance of the eastern Great General triggered a rush of excitement and activity. But a powerful aura suddenly appeared above the battleground. The eastern Great General raised his head and saw a black figure charging straight at him.

In the next second, an intense rush of black aura was emitted from the eastern Great General’s body to meet the incoming figure.

With an immense boom, powerful shock waves radiated out in all directions!

Two figures could be seen standing head to head in mid-air.

On one side was the eastern Great General. On the other side was a burly fiendish demon.

“That is... the Great General of the western camp.” One of the little fiendish demons beside Ye Qingtang spoke up in shock at the sight of that other figure.

It was the clash between the eastern and western Great Generals. It was inevitable that it would be a battle to the bitter end.

The atmosphere of the entire battleground instantly became very tense the moment those two Great Generals appeared.

It was the first time Ye Qingtang was witnessing a battle between two elite fiendish demons. Just the shockwaves resulting from the clashes between those two was enough to send the other demons on the battlefield flying.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang was secretly rejoicing at the fact that she didn’t bring Little White Tiger and Little Heavenly Demon along with her. The amount of power exchanged as the two Great Generals fought was far beyond what Ye Qingtang could ever imagine.

But just as both sides were engaged in an intensely fierce battle, the bright clear sounds of a blowing horn echoed through the valley.

The tone was low but the ears of every single demon in the valley instantly pricked up.

Like death’s knell, the roar of thunder was so tremendous that their chests felt like it had been blown apart.
