The youth trembled in fear, and his eyes were full of tears.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect squinted his eyes. He smiled as he looked at the young man. He walked slowly to the cage and stared at him in a superior way.

When the young man’s sight met with the Elder’s one, he could feel the fear spreading through his body. His face was paler, and the hands that were shielding the youth shivered.

Suddenly, the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect smashed his hand at the young man’s chest. The five fingers pierced through his chest.

A screech exploded from the young man’s mouth.

A beating heart was dug out by the Elder’s hand the next second.

The young man’s body collapsed, and blood flowed out from the wound on his chest.

The youth behind stared at the familiar figure in shock. He cried desperately as his Senior Brother lost all his breath.

However…

This was not the end yet.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect chewed the heart in front of the youth’s empty gaze. The mouth that was filled with blood was tilted to an angle.

“Don’t be overconfident of your ability.” The Elder threw out a few disdainful words. He did not even look at the dead young man on the ground. Instead, he looked straight at the youth who fell down in horror.

Ye Qingtang, who was hiding in the dark, witnessed the bloody scene. When she saw the Elder dig out the young man’s heart, she could not help but take a cold breath.

However, the cold breath exposed herself.

The Elder, who was about to target the youth, suddenly sensed the breath. He turned his head, and his sight was fixed at the direction where Ye Qingtang was at.

The gloomy smile appeared on his face again.

“Found you.”

He gave up on attacking the youth as he spoke and immediately dashed towards Ye Qingtang’s direction.

Ye Qingtang was shocked. She turned and escaped as the Elder was approaching her swiftly.

Damn it!

Qin Huan and the rest, who were in the cage, stared at the two figures in surprise. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“It’s Junior Sister Ye!” Qin Huan held the bar of the cage worriedly and witnessed the two figures disappearing from his sight.

“Why did she come over?” Dai Changming frowned and felt worried as well. It was lucky that she could hide herself previously. She should have gone somewhere safe.

“Hahaha… She can’t escape now! No one can escape! The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect has found her. She will definitely die!” Zhou Qu laughed viciously. If he could not survive, Ye Qingtang must die as well!

Everyone stared at him in rage when they heard his malicious curse.

Qin Huan held him up in fury and punched his face.

“Junior Sister Ye belongs to the same sect as us! Zhou Qu! What are you up to!”

Zhou Qu did not feel irritated even though he was punched. He just covered his face and cursed again. “How could she run away? Don’t daydream anymore. The moment when we stepped into Deer City, no one could make it out alive! However… Ye Qingtang will die in front of us now…”
