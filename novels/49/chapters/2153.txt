Chapter 2154: He Must Have Taken Drugs (1)

After Mu Ziying pulled off her coat, some of the more nasty onlookers made some catcalls. Closing her eyes tightly, Mu Ziying tried to stop her shoulders from trembling.

Meng Yao’s eyes were full of venom. She was waiting to trample Mu Ziying’s dignity bit by bit.

But just as Mu Ziying was prepared to take off her inner garments, a shadow suddenly appeared over her head.

A large, thick outer coat was suddenly wrapped around her as a warm palm settled down on her head.

“It’s chilly out here. Don’t catch a cold.”

Mu Ziying’s eyes turned red at that familiar voice.

Teacher Ye!

Ye Qingtang wrapped her coat tightly around Mu Ziying and she scanned the crowd with frosty eyes.

This kid had just left her side not long ago, and there were already people bullying her student?

“Who is he?” The crowd was full of queries at the sudden appearance of this unknown youth.

“No idea, never seen him before.”

When Meng Yao saw Ye Qing’s face, her expression instantly turned even more venomous. Her freshly-healed lash marks started to tingle.

“Teacher Ye!” The restrained Jing Ze looked at Ye Qingtang as if he had seen a lifebuoy.

“Teacher?” The crowd was stunned.

Even Zhang Qiqiu was shocked. This youth was a teacher?

But...

He didn’t appear that powerful.

“I heard that our academy hired a new teacher and assigned Jing Ze and a few others to him.” One of the teenagers whispered.

Zhang Qiqiu looked somewhat grim, but upon recalling that the practice arena was the only place in the Netherworld Academy where students could spar, he didn’t feel that worried. He indicated for his gang to let go of Jing Ze and walked over to stand beside Meng Yao.

Having regained his freedom, Jing Ze stumbled over to Ye Qing’s side. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Teacher Ye...” Jing Ze lowered his head in shame. It was all his fault for being so useless.

Ye Qingtang glanced at Jing Ze before she reached over to wipe off a trace of blood from the corner of his mouth.

“Teacher Ye, students are allowed to spar freely in the practice arena. We were just sparring with Jing Ze and Mu Ziying just now. That shouldn’t be a problem, right?” Zhang Qiqiu smiled. He had already heard about Ye Qing from Meng Yao.

Ye Qing looked very calm. “Sparring?”

Zhang Qiqiu nodded. “That’s right. Sparring. But these two are too lousy and couldn’t defend themselves against us. Surely we can’t be blamed for that, right?”

Ye Qing remained silent, merely glancing at Zhang Qiqiu and Meng Yao.

“In that case, please continue.” Ye Qing suddenly spoke up.

Everyone was stunned by her words.

Continue?

What was going on? Was this new teacher a fool?

Couldn’t she see the wretched state that Jing Ze and Mu Ziying were in now? And she wanted them to continue?

Did this person come here to help them or step on them?

Even Zhang Qiqiu and Meng Yao were stunned. They could not decipher Ye Qing’s intentions.

Lei Yan had secretly heaved a sigh of relief when Ye Qing appeared. He thought that Jing Ze and Mu Ziying would be saved, but who would have expected...

Was this Teacher Ye crazy?

Continue to spar?

These two would probably die if they continued.
