Distorting The Truth 3

“Father, Ye Qingtang’s ignorance and arrogance are due to the poor discipline of Jiang Lang and his wife. Now that she implicated others in the clan and caused the death of Jiang Family members, Jiang Lang and Mo Yi cannot escape the blame!” Jiang Qin immediately accused Jiang Lang and Mo Yi when she noticed them.

Jiang Xun hurried forward and stopped the rash Jiang Lang.

“Lang, don’t cause trouble in front of your father.”

They did not have any evidence right now, and they would only be in the wrong if Jiang Lang really used force.

“Jiang Lang, you’re really getting more insolent. How dare you use force in front of the Domain Monarch?” Jiang Shun shouted coldly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I will not tolerate you all slandering my daughter like this!” Jiang Lang reproached.

“Slander? You should be glad that Ye Qingtang died in the Land of Infinite Demons. Otherwise, given her personality, god knows how much trouble she can cause to the Jiang Family. It’d be such a disaster if such a troublesome person continues staying in the Jiang Family.” Jiang Qin snickered.

The Domain Monarch frowned slightly and was about to scold Jiang Qin for speaking irresponsibly.

But a voice rang.

“I’m afraid you’ll be disappointed then. Since time immemorial, it’s known that a bad person never dies, and this is not said without a reason.”

Everyone in the hall was stunned the moment that voice was heard.

Ye You, who had been snickering secretly, was alarmed when she heard the familiar voice. She instinctively looked in the direction of the voice along with the rest.

All she saw was...

A blood-stained figure walking toward the courtyard slowly.

Ye Qingtang’s clothes were tainted red by blood. As she walked in slowly, her dark hair danced in the cool breeze as a seeming smile played on her lips.

“Tang Tang...” Mo Yi widened her eyes in delight when she saw her returning daughter. As Mo Yi sprinted towards Ye Qingtang, her eyes glistened with tears while she looked at her daughter she just regained.

Everyone in the hall was evidently astonished.

After hearing what Jiang Qin and the rest said earlier on, Ye Qingtang entered the forbidden area of the Land of Infinite Demons; thus, they concluded that Ye Qingtang definitely died. However, never had they thought that Ye Qingtang, who entered the forbidden area, could actually make it back alive!

At this very moment, the expressions on Jiang Qin’s and Ye You’s faces were the most interesting of the bunch. With slightly widened eyes, they looked at Ye Qingtang as though they were looking at a ghost.

“How can it be...” Jiang Qin’s eyes were filled with surprise. She clearly saw Ye Qingtang entering the forbidden area from afar...

How did she make it back alive?

Jiang Lang heaved a great sigh of relief when he saw Ye Qingtang’s safe return. Even Jiang Xun sighed lightly as a weight on her heart disappeared.

“Tang Tang, you’re alright? Didn’t you... enter the forbidden area?” Mo Yi looked at Ye Qingtang in surprise and happiness.

Ye Qingtang smiled and nodded. “Mother, I did enter the forbidden area, but aren’t I safely back now? Don’t worry.” Although she did not share any blood ties with Mo Yi, the warmth of being missed by someone sent a warm feeling to Ye Qingtang’s heart.

Mo Yi wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes and held onto Ye Qingtang’s wrists tightly.

Jiang Qin was astonished to see Ye Qingtang. Exchanging a surprised look with Jiang Shun, Jiang Qin snickered and asked, “Ye Qingtang, where’s Jiang Qiu and the others?”

Jiang Qiu and the others were the Jiang Family disciples who chased Ye Qingtang into the forbidden area.

Ye Qingtang looked up and said, “Dead.”

Jiang Qin smirked and shouted coldly. “Ye Qingtang, you’re so cruel. How dare you kill fellow disciples of the same clan!”
