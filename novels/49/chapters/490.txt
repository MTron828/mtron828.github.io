“There’s no hurry. You’re next,” Ye Qingtang said.

Ning Luo shook his head. “Junior Sister Ye, don’t speak too confidently. You want to kill me but have missed the best opportunity to do so.”

As Ning Luo finished his sentence, two figures descended from the sky.

The incomers were a male and female who were both donned in long white robes with embroidery of two unusual clouds on the chest area.

“Yunxiao Sect disciples?!”

Zhu Changge was astonished.

The pair of people before him were both Yunxiao Sect’s inner sect disciples, who possessed unfathomable martial skills!

“Humph! You’re really useless, Ning Luo. As Yunxiao Sect’s inner sect disciple, you’re cornered to such a situation by Xuanling Sect disciples!” the male in the lead said coldly and cast Ning Luo a look from the corner of his eye.

“Haha. Senior Brother Zhuo is right. I am all to blame for being useless and having to trouble you and Senior Sister Yue to help me.” Ning Luo chuckled.

The girl who was addressed as Senior Sister Yue looked at Ning Luo indifferently without saying anything.

“Whatever. Since we are here, let’s kill all these Xuanling Sect disciples, and we will bring you back to the sect afterward.” Senior Brother Zhuo looked across Ye Qingtang and the rest.

Then, the change of events had already exceeded Ye Qingtang’s predictions. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The primordial qi in her body was already insufficient, and it was almost completely depleted after the battle with Elder Lin earlier on.

Elder Lin just died, yet then came two Yunxiao Sect’s inner sect disciples…

“Leave first.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Zhu Changge, Qin Huan, and the rest.

“No!” Qin Huan refused at once.

“Junior Sister Ye, how can we abandon you and leave?!” Zhu Changge echoed.

“You all leave first. I have ways to deal with this. If you all are here, it is a burden to me instead,” Ye Qingtang said seriously.

“This…”

After hearing Ye Qingtang, the Xuanling Sect disciples were at a loss instantly.

They initially wanted to stick together through life and death with Ye Qingtang, but she said that they would be a burden to her…

“Forget it. Since Junior Sister Ye said this, she must have a way of getting out of this predicament. We will leave first and search for reinforcements!” Zhu Changge said.

“Junior Sister Ye, you must be careful!” Qin Huan reminded.

Under Ye Qingtang’s protection, the few people evacuated swiftly.

“Want to leave right before our eyes?” Senior Sister Yue sneered. She was about to chase after them but was deliberately held back by Ning Luo

“Ning Luo, what are you doing?!” Senior Sister Yue shouted furiously.

“Senior Sister, they’re merely little clowns only. We do not need to waste any time here. The more pressing matter at hand is to return as soon as possible and notify the sect of this.” Ning Luo explained.

After pondering for a while, Senior Sister Yue finally nodded and said, “Alright. Since that’s the case, I’ll kill this dog that’s standing in our way first.”

The ‘dog standing in our way’ which Senior Sister Yue said naturally referred to Ye Qingtang.

“Senior Sister Yue, the primordial qi in her body is already depleted. There’s no need to bother about this disabled person. The better option is to leave now,” Ning Luo said with a smile.

After hearing Ning Luo, Senior Sister Yue’s cold eyes landed on Ning Luo as she said coldly, “Ning Luo, what are you planning exactly? You clearly know that this is the person whom Senior Sister Yue wants dead, but from what you said, you seem to wish to let her off?”

“Haha. Junior Brother Ning Luo… Actually, you already knew from the start that Yue and I were here. Could it be that the battle with Ye Qingtang was intentionally put up as a show for us?” Senior Brother Zhuo asked meaningfully.

“That’s why I found it strange. Your Paragon Skill of the Frost is already at the second level, but I saw that you did not use all your force… Ning Luo, what are you planning exactly?” Senior Sister Yue stared at Ning Luo.
