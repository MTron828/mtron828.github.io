Chapter 1959: Ye You (1)

“Thank you, Holy Lord.” The Domain Monarch stood up weakly and stretched his hand out to thank Ye Qingtang.

“The Jiang family was caught up in the destruction instigated by the Ancient You Clan. Do you have any idea what happened?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Domain Monarch who had aged rapidly, a bitter taste in her throat.

Even though she hadn’t been particularly close to the Domain Monarch, she knew that he was a just person and respected him for it.

The Domain Monarch shook his head.

“Everything happened so suddenly. I had no chance to prepare myself.”

Ye Qingtang had saved the Domain Monarch’s life and he had no intention to keep anything from her. He quickly told her about the massacre that had occurred in the Jiang family.

“I did feel it was strange how the person managed to kill so many people without touching our family’s array. It turns out that there were a few traitors,” Jiang Lang said with a cold laugh.

The Domain Monarch frowned slightly, his expression bitter. He had lived for so long yet never expected to be betrayed by his own daughter and granddaughter.

To think that it was his own flesh and blood who had caused such destruction of his family clan.

“I always knew that there was something not quite right with the little brat Ye You. If we had known earlier, we wouldn’t have brought her back.” Jiang Xun had never had a good impression of Ye You. She wanted nothing more than to rip her apart alive now that she knew what she had done to the Domain Monarch.

Had the Jiang family ever treated her badly?

Why had she been so vicious?

“I’m not sure if there is anyone else alive in the Jiang family. If there is, I will send people over to bring them here,” Ye Qingtang said. She was wondering if Mo Yi... was still alive.

“There are, thanks to Tang Tang’s elder brother. If he hadn’t taken us in, there was no way we could’ve escaped from the Ancient You Clan’s pursuit,” Jiang Lang said.

Ye Qingtang froze.

Her brother?

Northstar Demon Lord?

When the Jiang family had been attacked, the Domain Monarch had slaughtered many with Jiang Lang but had suffered heavy wounds. He had no choice but to hide.

It was mere coincidence that they had met Ye Qingtang’s elder brother.

The Northstar Demon Lord had known that they were Ye Qingtang’s family which was why he had offered a helping hand. He had hidden them in his sphere of influence.

It was because of this that they hadn’t returned to the other secret areas of the Jiang family residence, therefore escaping the massacre brought on by Jiang Qin’s betrayal.

Jiang Lang quickly told Ye Qingtang where the other people were hiding and thanked her profusely again.

Just as she prepared to leave, Jiang Lang suddenly spoke up. “Holy Lord.”

Ye Qingtang froze.

“I have a... presumptuous request...” Jiang Lang looked a little embarrassed.

“Please speak,” Ye Qingtang told him.

“After the Jiang family met with this massacre, I was unable to leave and my daughter was in the Taiyuan Valley. I have no idea if she is safe, so if the Holy Lord has any information, please let me know,” Jiang Lang was worried about his daughter, and spoke up even though he knew his request might have come off as rude.

Ye Qingtang was stunned for a moment before she lowered her eyes slowly.

“There was no one left alive... on Taiyuan Valley,” she said slowly.

Jiang Lang froze.

“Someone has already been there. Everyone is dead.” Ye Qingtang couldn’t bear to look at Jiang Lang’s eyes.

She could no longer be their daughter again. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

She could only give up on the warmth and affection she once had.

Rather than let Jiang Lang and Mo Yi keep hoping, she would tell them that she was dead.

The words made Jiang Lang reel back in shock, as if he had been punched in the gut. Some moments later, he steadied himself and said softly, “Thank you Holy Lord.”
