Though Ye Qingtang was fast, the king-level demonic beast was not slow at all. The distance between them was only approximately a hundred meters.

“Holy Lady, the fighting sounds previously came from the front!” the Blood Moon Elder said and looked at Ye Qingtang. The sounds they heard were not far from them. The direction they were escaping to matched with the origin of the sounds.

Ye Qingtang nodded and ran towards the front. The king-level demonic beast was still chasing closely behind.

After a while, Ye Qingtang finally reached the place in front. There was a huge river in front of them.

There were ten figures beside the river!

Ye Qingtang looked closely and noticed that the ten people were from different sects. Furthermore, there was a giant tiger-shaped demonic beast on the river!

The tiger-shaped demonic beast was pure white. An evil aura filled his eyes, and it looked like a huge heretic demon.

“How dare clowns like you to enter the Hell of Avicinaraka and find trouble with me?”

The white tiger sneered, but surprisingly, it spoke human language.

“A Fiendcelestial Beast?”

The Blood Moon Elder was slightly shocked after seeing the white tiger.

Even Ye Qingtang also felt surprised.

The Fiendcelestial Beast could speak human language according to the legends. The aura around the white tiger was totally different from that of normal demonic beasts as well!

The giant white tiger that could speak human language should be the rumored Fiendcelestial Beast hiding in the Hell of Avicinaraka.

The black-robed man said that though the Hell of Avicinaraka was a conspiracy, the information on the Fiendcelestial Beast was real.

There was indeed a Fiendcelestial Beast in the Hell of Avicinaraka. Most likely, the white tiger was that Fiendcelestial Beast.

The powerful people from the super sects surrounded the white tiger. There were a few corpses lying around.

“How dare you not bow in respect to me when you see me? How dare you dream to domesticate me?!”

The white tiger twitched its mouth like a human as it was under attack. Its whiskers shivered along with its movement. It raised its giant white paw and smashed down towards the crowd.

Boom!

A loud sound exploded, and the ten people flew outwards under the force of the white tiger’s paw. They had no way to defend themselves at all. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The people all felt bitter towards the white tiger’s reproach.

Since when did they want to domesticate it?

It was the Fiendcelestial Beast that chased and wanted to kill them. However, everything was inverted in its mouth…

“I was chased by humans outside, and it took me so much effort to enter the mystic realm here. Before I could enjoy my peaceful time here, you came for me again… How dare you look down on me!” The white tiger roared in rage again. This roar was able to shake the entire world.

“Let us leave now, and we will not disturb you anymore,” one of the super sect people said and panted. His face was unpleasant as he looked at the giant white tiger.

When they entered the Hell of Avicinaraka, they met the Fiendcelestial Beast by chance. They had some thoughts towards it previously. However, before they took any move, the Fiendcelestial Beast attacked them first and had chased them for days…

Only god knew how confounded they were under the Fiendcelestial Beast’s attack!

“What a joke! Since you are here, don’t think you can escape alive.” The white tiger mocked as he sized up the crowd. Obviously, it did not want this group of people to leave alive in front of its eyes.

Everyone was shocked. However, before the white tiger could say anything else, they heard the roar of a beast approaching from behind.
