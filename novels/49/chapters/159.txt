Everyone nodded.

Qin Huan found it a little strange though. When Gu Yanqiu was giving instructions, Qin Huan’s gaze uncontrollably fell on Ye Qingtang, who patted her chest with a hand.

Under his outerwear, Qin Huan was wearing the fire-resistant soft armor that Ye Qingtang gave him before.

This vest was light, and one could not tell what material was it made of. Previously, Qin Huan kept it instead of wearing it, and it was Ye Qingtang who ordered him to change into it when they were taking a rest before they headed to the Giant Rock Canyon.

Qin Huan did not think too much about it initially, but he felt that something was a little off now.

He took a look at Gu Yanqiu and the rest whose faces were tinted red from the heat as they neared the Giant Rock Canyon. In contrast, he did not feel hot at all, and his body felt cozy as though the heat was isolated away by this thin vest. Only his four limbs could feel a little heat, but his vital organs were well-protected by the soft armor. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

What exactly was this soft armor that little junior sister gave him?

Qin Huan could not understand at the moment, but he remembered her favor.

“Most of the Giant Lizards stay in groups. Our target this time is the biggest level 6 Giant Lizard. If we encounter other Giant Lizards, we just need to direct them away.” Then, Gu Yanqiu looked towards Qin Huan and said, “Qin Huan, you are quick enough. If we encounter a group of them, you will bring two other people to direct other Giant Lizards away. Meng Sheng and I will think of a way to attract the target to an open space.”

“Huh? Oh… okay, I got it,” Qin Huan replied hurriedly as he returned to his senses.

“Junior Sister Ye, you’ll follow me tightly at that time,” Gu Yanqiu turned to Ye Qingtang and said. Although he had seen Ye Qingtang’s capabilities before, he did not dare to just allow Ye Qingtang to act on her own.

“Senior Brother Gu, I’m afraid this is not suitable,” Meng Sheng suddenly said after remaining silent throughout.

“Why?” Gu Yanqiu asked.

Meng Sheng replied, “We are dealing with a level 6 Giant Lizard. Putting everything else aside, even you and I need to be very cautious. Moreover, this Giant Lizard’s poison is extremely deadly. Out of the ten of us, only you, Qin Huan, and I have the appropriate skills. Qin Huan has already gone to attract the attention of other Giant Lizards. It is inappropriate if you split your focus on taking care of others.”

Then, Meng Sheng’s gaze fell on Ye Qingtang.

“Since we came on a mission together, where would there be any protection or not? Everyone must work together and put in their utmost best to hunt the demonic beast. If Junior Sister Ye stills needs someone to protect her, why is she needed on this mission? She will just be a burden instead.”

While Meng Sheng’s words were ugly, it reflected the thoughts of other disciples present.

It was already the limit for ten people to deal with a level 6 demonic beast. If there was one less person’s effort and another top-skilled teammate had to split his attention to protect the person, the hunt might not be a success.

Gu Yanqiu returned to his senses and was aware of this problem as well. When he was about to say something, Ye Qingtang suddenly said, “Senior Brother Gu, why not let Senior Brother Qin go with you all. Leave the mission of attracting the other Giant Lizards to me.”

With that said, Gu Yanqiu was stunned.

Giant Lizards lived in groups, and no one knew how many other Giant Lizards would be around their target. Gu Yanqiu made Qin Huan in charge of the job because Qin Huan was pretty skilled. If it were anyone else, it would be unsuitable as they would be attacked by the Giant Lizard’s venom as long as they were a little careless.

“Junior Sister Ye…” Gu Yanqiu felt that it was unsuitable, but Meng Sheng spoke one step ahead of him. “Since Junior Sister Ye wants to try, let her try then. It is also a chance to verify whether she has the qualifications to participate in this mission, isn’t it?”
