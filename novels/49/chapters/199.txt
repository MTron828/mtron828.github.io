Chapter 200: Sect Mission (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I did ask around about it previously…” Yun Shu obviously paid attention to the sect mission matters previously.

A month after the new disciples entered the sect, they would have to take on their first sect mission. These kind of missions for the new disciple were relatively easy and were basically completed in groups.

Just as Yun Shu and Ye Qingtang were talking, Su Wan, who was standing a few steps away from Yun Shu, had a dark expression. She glared right at the both of them, and a deathly cold air seemed to be hidden in her seemingly gentle eyes.

Su Wan originally wanted to use the opportunity to become closer to Yun Shu, but she did not expect that before she walked to Yun Shu’s side, Ye Qingtang would already be talking to Yun Shu. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Looking at their intimate behavior, Su Wan’s heart was as though it was chopped into pieces by a knife. Senior Brother Yun’s eyes were glued on Ye Qingtang. Su Wan was clearly standing behind Senior Brother Yun, but he did not even realize she was here.

On what basis!

Su Wan quietly clenched her fist tightly and looked at Ye Qingtang’s exquisite side profile, wishing that she could slash Ye Qingtang’s face with a knife.

She clearly tried all sorts of means for Yun Shu and Ye Qingtang to not interact with each other in this period of time. She clearly told Yun Shu many bad things about Ye Qingtang, and she never even mentioned to Ye Qingtang that Yun Shu wanted her to find him. But why was Yun Shu acting as if nothing happened…

Hatred and resentment filled Su Wan’s eyes.

And it was at this instant when the teaching warden assigned the missions to the disciples.

“This is your first time accepting a sect mission. To ensure that you all can complete it successfully, I will appoint the more skilled people as the mission’s team leader.” Then, the warden looked at the files in his hands and called out a few names.

Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen were the most skilled amongst the new disciples and were obviously in the list of names called out. Apart from the two of them, the warden called out another four people and handed down the missions that they had to take on. After looking at the mission, these disciples could freely choose the other members to embark on the mission with.

These six people were the most skilled amongst their batch of new disciples, and the difference between the disciples’ skills could be seen from here.

The six people who were called out took a step forward and stood within everyone’s line of sight.

“Junior Sister Su, Senior Brother Yun is also a leader for a mission. I think he will definitely choose you.” Liu Yue, who was standing beside Su Wan, looked at the glorious Yun Shu as she beamed at Su Wan, who wore a gloomy expression.

Su Wan returned to her senses and quickly hid away the resentment in her eyes as she smiled gently. “Who knows who Senior Brother Yun will choose? Just now… Junior Sister Ye was talking to Senior Brother Yun, and perhaps, she had already told him about this.”

After hearing, Liu Yue looked at Ye Qingtang with a face of disdain. “What a vixen! I heard that after she returned from the rewarded mission the other time, she did not interact much with Senior Brother Yun. Yet now, she is acting chummy with him. Isn’t it all because she knows that she must take on a sect mission already and wants to cozy up to Senior Brother Yun! Junior Sister Su, you have been on such good terms with Senior Brother Yun recently, and Ye Qingtang cannot compete against this. There are so many rumors in the outer sect about you and Senior Brother Yun now. I can see that Senior Brother Yun treats you pretty well, and he will definitely not be bewitched by that vixen Ye Qingtang.”

Su Wan could not help but smile shyly when she heard that.

Indeed, many disciples were talking about the relationship between her and Yun Shu in this half a month.
