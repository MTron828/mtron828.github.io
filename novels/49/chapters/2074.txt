Chapter 2075: The Disintegrating Seal (2)

When Ye Qingtang finally came out of her stupor, three days had already passed. She felt a huge weight on her chest when she woke up and forced herself to look up.

A fluffy, white thing was lying squarely on her chest. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

The little white tiger was in deep slumber when a force pushed it to the ground.

“D*mn it, who did that!” the little white tiger said fiercely rolled on the ground.

It lifted its eyes and saw an expressionless Ye Qingtang staring at it.

The little white tiger jumped onto the bed and exclaimed, “You’re finally awake!”

She nodded.

“I was afraid I was going to die in my sleep if I didn’t wake up.”

The little white tiger froze asking, “What happened? Why would you die?”

“I thought I was going to be crushed to death.” Ye Qingtang twisted her lips and looked at the little white tiger’s round body. “Did you... gain weight recently?”

A fierce glare was directed towards her.

“What are you saying! Who did you say gained weight! Don’t spout rubbish!”

The little white tiger sucked in its stomach as it spoke, but its soft tummy still bulged out.

No, that wasn’t it. It hadn’t gained weight, it had just grown up.

The little white tiger was extremely dejected. It came from the race of white tigers and was the benchmark for all other Fiend Celestial beasts. He was supposed to have balanced bones and honed muscles.

However...

Ye Qingtang rarely brought it out in the Temple of Shadows and since it was the Holy Lord of Shadows’s precious pet, everything it asked for was given to it.

The bored little white tiger could only eat its loneliness away. It had also been moving around less, so gradually...

Could it be blamed that flab had started collecting around its stomach?

Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger and stuck out her hand to poke its soft tummy.

“Stop it! You beast!” The little white tiger shouted as it clutched its stomach. “You d*mned woman, how dare you touch my stomach!”

“What else would I do?” She looked at how round the little white tiger had gotten and confirmed that it had indeed gained weight.

“Fiend Celestial Beasts don’t get fat!” the little white tiger argued as it turned pale.

Ye Qingtang felt that it was just deceiving itself.

“How long have I been out for?” she asked as she got out of bed.

“Three days. You really know how to sleep,” the little white tiger replied.

“Three days... what happened to me?” She frowned. Many things had happened extremely quickly that day and her memories were a mess.

“Who knows...” the little white tiger said as it moved its gaze away. He kept silent about all that had happened when she was asleep and didn’t mention Ling Yan and the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

Ye Qingtang could sense that there was something more it wasn’t saying. Even though the pain had been unbearable and it had already been three days, she still remembered what happened that day.

She touched her chest subconsciously as a strange feeling came from it.

She had felt this before.

But in her previous life...

She had suffered pain so terrible that it almost killed her when the Heart of the Heavenly Dao had broken out of her.

A frown crossed her face.

She had almost forgotten that the Heart of the Heavenly Dao didn’t belong to her after the Divine Phoenix had sealed it.

But now...

The Heart of the Heavenly Dao was showing signs of leaking.

This was not a good sign for her.
