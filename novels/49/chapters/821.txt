Chapter 822 Xuanyuan Yi (2)

Ye Qingtang smiled after hearing that and said, “Full Moon Peak Master, what do you mean by

that?”

“You left Falling Sky Valley without permission and wanted to kill a genius disciple in the valley. Do you admit to your crimes?” Xuanyuan Yi said.

“I don’t understand what you’re saying, Full Moon Peak Master.” Ye Qingtang shook her head and said. “Let’s not talk about the fact that I am the Valley Master’s disciple. Even if I’m an ordinary disciple in Falling Sky Valley, don’t I have the freedom to leave the valley to train? Furthermore, it’s Xuanyuan Lie who stopped me and wanted to exchange moves with me. I am very helpless as well.”

“Oh?” Xuanyuan Yi looked at Ye Qingtang without emotions. “They said that you’re good at quibbling, and it is indeed true from what I see now. Return to Falling Sky Valley with me right now and wait for Peerless School to get to the bottom of your parentage.”

Before waiting for Ye Qingtang to say anything, Xuanyuan Lie said hurriedly, “Grandfather, this little bastard is definitely not from the sea of clouds at Mount Qin. Otherwise, why would he come to our Falling Sky Valley to cultivate? After offending the Peerless School, he knew that he caused big trouble and wants to flee now!”

However, Xuanyuan Yi merely cast a look at Xuanyuan Lie indifferently. This grandson of his was still too young.

Even if Ye Qingtang was not from the sea of clouds at Mount Qin, killing her would, firstly, completely break off relations with Perfected Xuanchen as Ye Qingtang was his disciple no matter what.

Secondly, if Peerless School found out that Ye Qingtang was not from the sea of clouds at Mount Qin and asked them for her, it would be offending the Peerless School for the second time if Ye Qingtang could not be handed over.

Lastly, Ye Qingtang was so young but could attain the state of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Even if she was not from the sea of clouds at Mount Qin, there must be a powerful force behind her. Otherwise, at her age, it was impossible to possess this cultivation base without the powerful force’s emphasized grooming and millions of elixirs to raise her.

No matter what, Ye Qingtang must not be killed now. Even if she was to be killed, it must be because the other peaks pressured Perfected Xuanchen to clear her himself. This way, if there was anything wrong, it would all be Perfected Xuanchen’s fault and would have nothing to do with them.

“Grandfather, kill that little bastard!” Xuanyuan Lie yelled at Xuanyuan Yi.

“Shut up.” Xuanyuan Yi shouted coldly.

“Grandfather…” Xuanyuan Lie was stupefied and did not know why his grandfather reprimanded him.

“In these past few years, I have only been grooming your martial skills. It seems that you must cultivate your temperament in the future. If you’re like this, you will definitely be at a disadvantage in the future,” Xuanyuan Yi said coldly.

“Noted…”

Although Xuanyuan Lie did not know what he did that upset his grandfather, he could only keep his mouth shut and not speak again.

“Ye Chen, I’ll not ask about the incident between you and Xuanyuan Lie today. However, you must return to Falling Sky Valley with me,” Xuanyuan Yi said.

“I’m afraid I cannot do it.” Ye Qingtang shook her head and said. “My clan summoned me. I must return to the sea of clouds at Mount Qin.”

Ye Qingtang had already agreed with Master Du to head to the Dragon Vein today.

If she was captured back to Falling Sky Valley by Xuanyuan Lie, she would not be able to leave the valley, and the consequences would be dire if the Peerless School found out that she was not from the hidden clan. No matter what, she must not return to Falling Sky Valley. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“In at most two days, Peerless School will finish investigating your identity. If you’re really from the sea of clouds at Mount Qin, I’ll naturally apologize to you, and the Peerless School will hold all responsibility,” Xuanyuan Yi said.
