1415 Competing Your Wealth With Me? 2

Nevertheless, the girl spoke once again. “The auction has not ended. If you all really want it, go ahead and bid.”

Ye Xun’s face darkened completely. If they had the money, why would they be talking all that bullsh*t with her?

Two hundred thousand spirit coins was already an astronomical amount, but who would have thought that there was an even wealthier person in this auction?

The Jiang Family was powerful.

But to whom was it being compared to was the key.

Ye Qingtang just left the Temple of Shadows as the Holy Lord of Shadows.

The Temple of Shadows was once a supreme force in the Central Mainland. Although it waned subsequently, the wealth that it stored at its peak would make many people shudder. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Furthermore, the Undead Clan did not like eating or drinking and did not have any illnesses. The Holy Lord of Shadows obtained most of the Dharma treasures and elixirs from the Second Domain through the Crimson League, and there was nothing to spend their money on.

If they were only comparing wealth, even the Ancient You Clan and Sacred Ground of Reflection added together might not defeat the Temple of Shadows, much less a Jiang Family.

If they were to compete on wealth, the Temple of Shadows had never been afraid of anyone!

When Ye Qingtang left the Temple of Shadows, she brought along the Holy Lord of Shadows’s spirit card that stored a magnificent amount of spirit coins

Affluent people store massive amounts of spirit coins in a spirit card.

Even if there was another zero behind the three hundred thousand, Ye Qingtang reckoned that the Holy Lord of Shadows’s spirit card could still supply the amount.

The wealthiest person in the Central Mainland was none other than the Holy Lord of Shadows.

Ye You was completely silent this time.

There was a flurry of discussions in the auction as everyone guessed which force that rich girl belonged to for her to be able to offer a price that was even scarier than what was possible for the people from the Jiang Family.

Moreover, she did not even give them any face.

Beidou Demon Lord shuddered as well. Earlier on, he thought that his forty thousand spirit coins was already an exorbitant amount, but compared to this little girl beside him…

It was simply another thing.

How wretched!

“Little girl, you are actually… so rich.” Beidou Demon Lord swallowed his saliva as he looked at the tiny Ye Qingtang, who was not even the size of his palm.

“Still alright.” Ye Qingtang smiled humbly.

Beidou Demon Lord’s lips twitched a little. Although he failed to get the Bone of the Dragon Breath in the end, he was comforted that it was won by the little girl beside her instead of those two aggressive girls.

Ultimately, the Bone of the Dragon Breath landed in Ye Qingtang’s space ring safely.

Even though she was blocked by Beidou Demon Lord, Ye Qingtang could already sense the sharp gazes that Ye You and Ye Xun shot at her.

After storing the Bone of the Dragon Breath, Ye Qingtang tugged Beidou Demon Lord’s long fur immediately.

“Let’s go.”

Beidou Demon Lord was in a daze. “You’re not auctioning anymore?”

“Mhm. I don’t have money already.” Ye Qingtang found a random excuse.

Thinking that the item he wanted was already auctioned away and that there was no reason to stay, Beidou Demon Lord left the auction house with Ye Qingtang. Throughout the whole process, Ye Qingtang was completely blocked by Beidou Demon Lord, and no one could see her.

“Sister You, they have left.” Ye Xun was rather anxious as she watched Beidou Demon Lord and Ye Qingtang leave.

The Bone of the Dragon Breath was very important to Ye You.

Ye You narrowed her eyes and rose immediately.

“Look for Elder Xu.”

After leaving the auction house, Ye Qingtang did not pause in her tracks and directly dragged Beidou Demon Lord out of Burnt City.

Beidou Demon Lord did not think much as he was led out of Burnt City by Ye Qingtang.
