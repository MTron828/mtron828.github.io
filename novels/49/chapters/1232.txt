Chapter 1233: Doubts (1)

Just as Ye Qingtang and the little white tiger were puzzling over the matter, in the Temple of Shadows, Holy Son Ming Gu was looking extremely pleased. He returned to his room and tidied up his things. He looked at some small bones that had been painted gold and reached out his small hand to pick them up.

“Ming Gu, what are you doing?” The guardian, Xue Fu, was leaning on the door with his hands crossed over his chest, watching Ming Gu as he bustled around.

Ming Gu did not even raise his head but continued to focus on picking the small, golden bones.

He said, “I want to string a necklace for Ah Yao.”

“…” Xue Fu wiped his forehead and shook his head laughingly. “String your necklace later. Holy Son Ming Wang has returned to the Temple.”

The moment Xue Fu spoke, Ming Gu immediately raised his head and looked at Xue Fu with his dark eyes.

“Elder Brother has returned very quickly. I only just sent the news to him, and he’s back already.”

With that, Ming Gu put away his things and ran to the main hall.

The main hall currently felt rather constrained.

A petite, exquisite-looking child wearing black and gold armor was standing in the center of the main hall. His exquisite little face was identical to Ming Gu’s face. However, this child was surrounded by an evil aura.

Several peculiar-looking figures quietly stood next to the child.

The Temple of Shadows was the glory of the Clan of the Undead, and the Holy Lord was a powerful figure from the Skeleton Tribe within the Clan of the Undead. When the Holy Lord previously led everyone from the Second Domain to the Central Mainland, the Skeleton Tribe was not the only tribe in the Clan of the Undead to come along.

The Clan of the Undead was divided into many different tribes. The Holy Lord and the powerful figures of the other tribes had led their tribes here together.

Now, these powerful figures from the different tribes were tribe leaders in the Central Mainland.

At the moment, the Undead standing next to the child were some of these tribe leaders.

“Ming Wang, is your news accurate? Has the Holy Lord really returned?” spoke a burly man who looked as vicious as a devil and stood more than three meters tall. Within the Undead Clan, he was the leader of the Demon Tribe.

He turned his huge head to look at Ming Wang, who was only the size of his palm.

“Ming Gu sent the news.” Ming Wang spoke calmly. His eyes were completely cold.

The various tribe leaders exchanged a look but did not say anything else.

The Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows was a powerful figure of the Skeleton Tribe. Although the members of the main tribes of the Clan of the Undead gathered in the Temple of Shadows, in the past, the power of the Holy Lord had elevated the entire Skeleton Tribe’s status in the Temple of Shadows.

But…

The Holy Lord had vanished a long time ago.

Outsiders only knew that within the Temple of Shadows, the Holy Son was renowned for his cruelty. But they did not know that the Temple of Shadows had two Holy Sons.

One was Ming Gu; the other was Ming Wang.

If one said that Ming Gu was only cruel sometimes and childish at other times, then Ming Wang was only cruel.

Ming Wang had been discussing some matters with these tribe leaders when he received news from his younger brother, Ming Gu, that the Holy Lord had returned to the Temple.

When the tribe leaders with Ming Wang heard the news, some of them were curious and had tagged along.

After a moment, Ming Gu rushed in. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Elder Brother, you’re back. Ah Yao… Ah Yao has really returned,” Ming Gu said excitedly when he saw Ming Wang.
