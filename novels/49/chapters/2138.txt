Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Qin Feng was strolling past with an expressionless face. Even with Lei Yan’s character, he became more subdued on seeing Qin Feng. He only recovered his usual bluster after Qin Feng left.

“I find it very strange. Why was Qin Feng also pushed over to that Ye Qing?” Lei Yan was truly surprised to see Qin Feng. After all, Qin Feng was not mediocre like the rest of this group.

Qin Feng was a famous prodigy...

“I really don’t know what this academy is thinking.” Lei Yan muttered to himself. Seeing that no one was paying him any heed, he turned to leave.

Over the next few days, Jing Ze alone stayed by Ye Qingtang’s side day after day, obediently listening to her teachings.

It was Ye Qingtang’s first time teaching someone martial arts. She found it rather refreshing and faced with an obedient student like Jing Ze, she did not hold back on any information. As a result, for the first time since she was reborn, Ye Qingtang finally experienced the disparity in the standard of martial arts now compared to 300 years into the future.

On top of learning from Ye Qingtang every day, Jing Ze also had to go to the other faculties for classes. When Jing Ze was not around, Ye Qingtang would try out the martial art techniques she recalled from her past life, and make adjustments to her own cultivation methods.

Because of Little You Yun, a substantial amount of Spiritual Abode energy was infused into Ye Qingtang’s body. But she had never fully refined it for use. Now was a good opportunity to gradually refine and absorb that unused energy into her body.

“Teacher Ye, shall I go and ask them to return?” After a few consecutive days of being together, Jing Ze finally dared to speak more freely in front of Ye Qingtang.

Initially, even Jing Ze felt somewhat disheartened after knowing Ye Qingtang’s cultivation level. He believed that the academy had given up all hope on him, and so assigned such a lousy teacher on him just to humor him.

But Jing Ze’s opinion changed after their first discussion. And after the past few days of continuous guidance from Ye Qingtang, Jing Ze could clearly feel a sliver of movement in his formerly stagnant power level.

Jing Ze was so excited about this that he couldn’t fall asleep for a few nights in a row.

Teacher Ye’s cultivation level was not high but she was definitely the best teacher he had ever met in his life. Not only that, her understanding of martial arts was an eye-opener.

Ye Qingtang lifted her head at Jing Ze’s words.

Over the past few days, apart from Jing Ze, the other students completely ignored her.

As if sensing Ye Qingtang’s doubts, Jing Ze lowered his head bashfully. “Teacher Ye, you are better than any teacher I have ever met. Lei Yan and the rest... they misunderstood you. Their talents are higher than mine and if they return and receive your guidance, they will definitely gain even more significant improvements...”

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help smiling sadly.

She had seen plenty of foolish people but she had never met someone as foolish as him.

It was not enough that he was benefiting. He wanted to help the others around him too.

He was truly naive.

Jing Ze didn’t know what Ye Qingtang was thinking and he continued. “Teacher Ye, actually... I already know that I will be kicked out of the academy soon. In reality... Lei Yan and the rest will suffer the same fate.”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

What was he saying?
