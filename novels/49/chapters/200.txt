Chapter 201: Sect Mission (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Both Su Wan and Ye Qingtang were close to Yun Shu, but there was a huge difference between them.

While Su Wan was also a new disciple, she was far above Ye Qingtang, regardless of her family background or the grade of her spirit root. Although Ye Qingtang was superior in terms of appearance, the feeling that they gave people were completely different.

In the eyes of others, there was nothing good about Ye Qingtang other than her face, and they felt that her relationship with Yun Shu was all Ye Qintang’s one-sided wishful thinking.

Rather, they felt that Su Wan was more compatible with Yun Shu.

Liu Yue uttered words of support for Su Wan as she made a plan for herself as well. Yun Shu’s skills were good, and if she could work on a mission together with Yun Shu using Su Wan’s relationship with him, Liu Yue believed that her score in the mission would be higher.

“Senior Sister Liu, these are merely our guesses. It is still up to Senior Brother Yun to choose,” Su Wan said gently.

According to the rules, Yun Shu and the others were to pick their team members in order of the rank of their spirit roots.

“Brother Yun, which candidate do you have in mind this time?” Lu Xiuwen asked Yun Shu while raising a brow.

Yun Shu gave a faint smile. “It is all our first time participating in a sect mission. I am not very certain as well.”

Lu Xiuwen laughed. “Brother Yun, you’re too humble. Didn’t you take extra care of Junior Sister Ye previously? Though I rarely see you and Junior Sister Ye interacting after entering the sect.”

Not many people knew that Ye Qingtang took on a rewarded mission. Among the new disciples, only Su Wan and Yun Shu knew, but they did not tell anyone else about it. Furthermore, the new disciples were too busy familiarizing themselves with matters in the outer sect over the past half a month and never noticed Ye Qingtang’s disappearance.

The only thing that everyone knew was that Yun Shu did not really interact with Ye Qingtang in this month and that the person who was always by his side was Su Wan instead.

Thus, many snickered that Ye Qingtang did not manage to cozy up to Yun Shu.

Yun Shu obviously understood the meaning behind Lu Xiuwen’s words and frowned slightly.

“You can start selecting your team members already,” the warden said.

Yun Shu looked away and towards the new disciples.

If there were no accidents, senior and junior brothers with yellow spirit roots would be the first to be selected. Yun Shu was still thinking of who to pick but saw Su Wan looking at him expectantly. As he thought of how Su Wan cared for him in these few days, Yun Shu who had a kind heart could not bear to reject her.

“Junior Sister Su.” Yun Shu slowly announced the name of his first teammate.

As Yun Shu spoke, Su Wan could not help but smile. Under everyone’s gaze, she slowly walked up while looking at Ye Qingtang from the corner of her eye with a sarcastic expression.

Ye Qingtang, no matter how good you are, the inferiority of your spirit root will not be changed.

Su Wan went forward and stood behind Yun Shu, and this started discussions among many people.

Everyone knew that Yun Shu only had many interactions with Ye Qingtang and Su Wan in the outer sect. Moreover, many noticed Su Wan’s affection for Yun Shu.

Now that Yun Shu chose Su Wan as his team member, wouldn’t Ye Qingtang… be abandoned then? Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

In a moment, everyone looked at the leisurely Ye Qingtang with a nosy expression.

If a useless red spirit root did not have Yun Shu’s protection, which group would want her?

Ye Qingtang stood calmly and did not take any of those bad-meaning gazes around her to heart. This type of mission for new disciples was of no difficulty to her regardless of which group she joined and, thus, she saw no point in worrying.
