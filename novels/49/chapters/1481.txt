Chapter 1482 All-Pervading Demonic Air 2

Even in all these years, numerous powerful figures entered the Land of Infinite Demons, but no one dared to enter the Forbidden Demon Area easily. It was rumored that a powerful figure in the Holy Venerate realm entered the Forbidden Demon Area forcefully to explore the place, but there was no more news of them afterward.

When powerful figures from the Second Domain invaded back then, many highly-skilled experts were sent to enter it too, but eventually… no one made it out alive.

That place was the true forbidden area, and before entering the Land of Infinite Demons, various ancient clans would specially warn the clan members to not go near there.

“Probably not. But we still need to go in and take a look. The news of that great demon came a month ago, and it should already be dead now. That great demon’s flesh and bones are rare treasures. It’s best if we can obtain it before it decomposes,” Jiang Shangyu said in a deep voice.

Everyone was on full alert when they heard him.

Even if the great demon had already decomposed, the funerary objects buried with him were also massive treasures.

“You all must be cautious after entering the Land of Infinite Demons. The plants inside are very poisonous. Don’t blame anyone else if you die inside if you ignore my commands and act on your own,” Jiang Shangyu said coldly.

After entering the Land of Infinite Demons, even he would not be able to ensure the safety of others if anyone messed about.

Everyone nodded successively.

Jiang Qin’s gaze passed Ye Qingtang, and she scoffed in her heart.

The key was to find that great demon’s corpse as quickly as possible. Anyway, Ye Qingtang would definitely die as long as she entered the Land of Infinite Demons, and there was no hurry to get rid of her at this instant.

Under Jiang Shangyu’s lead, everyone entered the Land of Infinite Demons.

As they walked into the thin fog, the visibility was greatly reduced to less than a few meters. Thankfully, the visibility could only be increased by focusing their spirit energy to their eyes. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Apart from the dangerous creatures in the Land of Infinite Demons, even the demonic air in the air carried strong poison. If one’s skills were not sufficient, one’s internal organs would be destroyed by the poison just by taking a sniff of it.

Ye Qingtang was only at the Arcane Supremacy Eighth Heaven realm, which was basically the lowest in the Jiang Family troops. Jiang Xun feared that Ye Qingtang would not be able to withstand this poison and specially told her to consume a poison-avoidance pill before they entered.

Despite so, when that air entered her lungs, Ye Qingtang still felt that her throat seemed to be burned by something and had a sharp pain.

“Tang Tang, you must follow me closely,” Jiang Xun said softly.

Ye Qingtang nodded, and the little white tiger rested on her arm obediently this time as well.

“F*ck. There really is a lot of good stuff inside.” The little white tiger used its nose. Its sense of smell was way better than humans, and it already smelled a strong odor the moment they entered the outer boundary of the Land of Infinite Demons.

In this dense, foggy forest, no one knew how many frightening things were lurking around in the dark.

Everyone moved carefully, but the withered grass beneath their feet seemed to be covered in a soft and sticky substance that seeped out through the gaps of the grass when a slight force was applied.

Ye Qingtang looked down and realized that the substance that seeped out was a maroon liquid with a strong smell of blood.

That was the liquid produced after a corpse decomposed…
