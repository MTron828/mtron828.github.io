Chapter 2697: Cursed Points (1)

The Great Immortal Temple disciples were all stunned by the ethereal voice. Even Ye Qingtang did not expect a cultivator to be killed if he did not replenish negative cursed points by the next day.

Ye Qingtang had never experienced such a strange and indescribable thing in her life. Cursed points in exchange for divine weapons? Negative cursed points? Killed just because one had negative cursed points?

Although there was no evidence and it was just a verbal warning, Ye Qingtang somehow felt that the ethereal voice was not joking.

In fact, Ye Qingtang had a strange feeling that if Senior Brother Lan Shan did not take this seriously and did not make up for the cursed points he owed by the next day, it was very likely that he would really be killed…

However, Ye Qingtang did not know how Lan Shan would be killed.

“Senior Brother Lan Shan… This…”

One of the girls looked at the bewildered Lan Shan in surprise.

Lan Shan cleared his throat and said seriously, “What are you afraid of? They are just bluffing… kill me? Let whoever wants to kill me come.”

“That’s right. I don’t believe they can kill a Heaven Emperor level practitioner just like that!” Zhou Yun sneered.

“Cultivators, you will be rewarded with cursed points for killing any living creature, other than the shopkeepers of the ancient city. 50 cursed points will be deducted from you for killing a shopkeeper. If you do not make up the points by early morning the next day, you will be killed.” The revived skeleton spoke.

“Haha, shopkeeper, I’m really sorry… it was just an accident. It was just a misunderstanding… didn’t you say that there is a method to give us cursed points? We need it!” Lan Shan said hurriedly.

“You are the first batch of cultivators to discover this low-tier ancient city and can be rewarded with cursed points. If you agree, please enter my shop.” The skeleton invited the group inside.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, what do you think?” Wan Rong looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang remained silent.

Ever since they entered the void rift and came here, everything felt so strange. Everything they saw was completely unheard of. Regardless, the current situation was not optimistic.

Lan Shan had crushed the shopkeeper with a single slap of his hand and had 50 points deducted. According to the ethereal voice, if Lan Shan could not make up the points by the next day, he would be killed.

Although this sounded like some fantasy story, it was better to believe it than not to believe it. What if it was true and he did not obtain enough cursed points? What should they do then?

If it was true, Senior Brother Lan Shan would be killed immediately. Even if it was only a 1% chance, they could not take this risk.

After a long time, Ye Qingtang stated her decision to Wan Rong and the other disciples.

“We accept.” Zhou Yun looked at the skeleton.

With that, Ye Qingtang and the disciples walked into the shop.

“Begin.”

The scene in front of Ye Qingtang changed instantly.

It was no longer a shop or any part of the ancient city in front of them. The day had turned into night, and waves of cheers and laughter rang out.
