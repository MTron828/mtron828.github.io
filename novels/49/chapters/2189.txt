Chapter 2190: Stop Joking (2)

Also...

He would never believe that Ye Qing could really refine elixirs.

“Maybe Teacher Ye placed an already-completed elixir in the tripod.” Yun Chen muttered to himself. This surmisation might be far-fetched but it was still far more believable than the fact that Ye Qing could refine elixirs.

“Yun Chen, what are you standing there for?” Ye Qingtang walked in. She had just gone to fetch some water and returned to see Yun Chen standing at the door in a daze.

Yun Chen jumped at the sound of Ye Qing’s voice.

“Teacher Ye.”

Ye Qingtang said, “Did you bring back all the medicinal herbs I require?”

Yun Chen composed himself and replied, “I have brought back most of them. But I am missing a few and would need a few days before...” Yun Chen took out the newly-filled space ring and gave it to Ye Qing.

Ye Qingtang scanned the items inside the ring.

Although there were a few of the rarer ingredients missing, it didn’t matter. She wouldn’t need those ingredients for the time being. They were just there as a backup.

Taking out a few herbs from the space ring, Ye Qingtang instructed Yun Chen, “The cypress elixir is about done. Go and take it out.

Taken aback, Yun Chen suddenly remembered about the cypress elixir. He opened his mouth to say something but didn’t know how to ask the question. In the end, he just went to take out the cypress elixir.

After retrieving the cypress elixir, Yun Chen realized that the quality of this elixir was even better than he first imagined.

Warmth and fragrance swirled around the small pill. The scent was exceptionally refreshing.

The cypress elixir might just be a mid-grade elixir but only alchemists themselves knew just how much the quality of such an elixir could differ.

While it was the same type of elixir, but the difference in quality from one pill to the next could be as wide as heaven and earth.

A top-grade pill was worth more than a hundred normal-grade pills!

Yun Chen carefully placed the cypress elixir into an exquisite bottle. If Yun Chen had doubted whether Ye Qing had refined this elixir, he no longer had any doubts now. He couldn’t have possibly produced this.

Even the medicine faculty head might not be able to refine a cypress elixir of this level. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It should be pointed out that the medicine faculty head was a Master-level alchemist...

But at the very most, he could only refine mid-grade elixirs to a quality level of 90 percent. It was nearly impossible to achieve the peak 100 percent stage.

When refining elixirs—the slightest variant to the intensity of the fire, the number of ingredients used as well as the duration of the cultivation—could result in major differences. To achieve the peak 100 percent perfect quality, apart from that Grand Master alchemist, no one else would be able to perform such a feat.

“Teacher Ye, where did you get this cypress elixir? I wonder which Grand Master alchemist cultivated this?” At this moment, Yun Chen was already convinced that Ye Qing had definitely not produced this cypress elixir. He believed that Ye Qing had just placed this already completed pill in the tripod out of curiosity.

Placing a completed elixir into a tripod for a short period of time would not produce any sort of changes.

As an alchemist himself, Yun Chen desperately wished to know which Grand Master alchemist cultivated this cypress elixir. He wondered if Teacher Ye was acquainted with that person.

Ye Qingtang lifted her head and stared at Yun Chen with a puzzled look in her eyes.
