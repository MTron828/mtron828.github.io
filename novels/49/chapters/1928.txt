Chapter 1929: The Return (2)

“Senior Brother, the ancient clans from the Central Mainland have all hidden in the Temple of Shadows. The effeminate-looking youth looked at the cold, handsome young man beside him. Compared to the previous time, he looked a lot less arrogant now.

The cold and handsome young man scanned the Temple of Shadows and threw the effeminate-looking youth a scathing glance. He understood the look immediately and flew up to attack the Undead Clan.

The clan elders were all gathered in the grand hall of the Temple of Shadows, looking at Ye Qingtang who was sitting above them and Ming Di which had shrunk itself and was standing beside her.

“Holy Lord, we do not wish to bother you but that boy is a huge thug and has already wiped out many ancient clans during this period. If this continues, who knows how much destruction he will cause in the Central Mainland,” an Ancient Clan Leader told Ye Qingtang bitterly.

They didn’t want to hide here in the Temple of Shadows but each day the youth wasn’t defeated was a day they couldn’t feel at ease.

As Ye Qingtang rested her chin on her hand, her eyes looked at the bitterness on the ancient clan people’s faces. The eight tribe leaders looked extremely displeased at the ancient clans who had come for their support as well.

Now they all wanted to rely on the Temple of Shadows?

After the disappearance of the Holy Lord of Shadows, these ancient clans had all abandoned the Temple of Shadows.

Yet they were all relying on the temple now.

Wasn’t this too shameless of them?

As the eight tribe leaders opened their mouths to speak, a huge roar came from outside the Temple of Shadows. A guard from the Undead Clan ran in hurriedly to report.

“Holy Lord, the boy is back!”

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

He was back? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

What was going on?

The faces of the ancient clan people all lit up. They had still been agonizing over how they could get the Holy Lord of Shadows to get rid of that youth as soon as possible. And now he had walked right up to their doorstep.

“Holy Lord, this youth is too arrogant. Please seek justice for us.”

“How dare he come here again. Holy Lord, he’s blatantly disrespecting you.”

The ancient clan people were fanning the flames as much as they could.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed subtly. The youth shouldn’t have been back so quickly after being scared away. So why was he here today?

An ominous feeling arose in her heart as it started pounding. But before she could speak, Ming Di shook its wings and a fire was lit in its red eyes.

“Just in time.” Ming Di laughed and flew out of the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Could it just calm down a little?

Although she knew Ming Di was strong, the youth’s power was terrifying as well. Who knew whether Ming Di was a match for him at all? And now he had just rushed in for the kill before she had said anything!

She had no words but the ancient clan people’s eyes all brightened when they saw Ming Di rush out.

“That’s amazing, Holy Lord. I want to see how Ming Di is going to reduce that arrogant boy to ashes.”

Ye Qingtang didn’t know how to respond.

It was fine, as long as they were happy.

Even if Ye Qingtang was feeling extremely uneasy, she couldn’t give any more excuses now that Ming Di had made its move.

After all...

Ming Di had already gathered all its murderous intent these past few days. Ye Qingtang doubted that she could hold it back, even if she wanted to.
