Chapter 1836: Black Armor (2)

“But even if it’s just a set of armor, it must have been sealed with the Heavenly Demon’s powers. If not, you wouldn’t have mistaken it for the Heavenly Demon at the start.”

Ye Qingtang was certain about it.

With the armor having the Heavenly Demon’s powers, they wouldn’t be able to fight against it.

But the thing Ye Qingtang was most curious about was why the armor was even stationed here. Until she knew more, she didn’t dare act abruptly and could only take Little White Tiger with her and retreat to a safe place.

The entire area struck by the armor had become a scene of charred devastation. For the moment, Ye Qingtang decided to rest for a moment since she did not need to worry as much about the disturbance from the live grave of the undead.

Somehow, it seemed that the black suit of armor could sense that Ye Qingtang hadn’t left the vicinity. It stood right in front of the Cursed True God, holding the sword tightly with both hands but it didn’t seem to have any intention of attacking.

Over the next few days, Ye Qingtang continued to observe it.

If she wasn’t wrong, the dark armor was protecting the Cursed True God’s remains and would attack anyone who came close to the Cursed True God. That meant that as long as they didn’t go too close to the Cursed True God, the armor wouldn’t attack them.

Knowing this, Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

But this gave rise to another problem for Ye Qingtang.

If they couldn’t get close to the Cursed True God, they won’t be able to destroy the remains and this would continue as a vicious cycle. The armor would stand nothing to lose.

But it wasn’t the same case for her...

“I have an idea.” Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke up after carefully thinking about it for some time.

Little White Tiger could sense something different in Ye Qingtang’s eyes and that expression on her face sent cold chills down its spine.

“I don’t agree!”

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“I haven’t even said what it is yet, how can you just disagree already?”

Little White Tiger looked at her warily. “I don’t need you to explain yourself, I can already see that sly look on your face. I’m never going to agree no matter what you say. Just give up now!”

“Don’t be like that... Do you really want to stay in this hellish place forever?”

“As if I haven’t experienced it before...” Little White Tiger muttered. Actually, it had stayed in the mystic realm for quite some time previously.

“You’re really against it?” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

Uh oh... An ominous feeling made its hair stand on end as it continued to eye Ye Qingtang.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang’s eyes crinkled into a smile as she pinched Little Heavenly Demon’s cheeks cheekily. “Are you hungry? Shall I help you roast a tiger?”

Once Little Heavenly Demon heard Ye Qingtang’s words, a line of drool appeared at the corner of its mouth. Eager eyes darted immediately to Little White Tiger in hopeful expectation.

What?! How could she... Little White Tiger was instantly furious!

“You’re too much!”

“Don’t worry so much, I’m just discussing it with you. I can see that the armor is not that intelligent. It only acts according to its instincts. You can just find a time to direct it away and I can work on destroying the Cursed True God’s remains,” Ye Qingtang explained.

“No no no! There’s absolutely no way I’m doing this.” Little White Tiger threw a glance at the terrifying black armor and shook its head, with no intention of stopping at all. No meant no!

Even if the armor did not have consciousness nor a physical body, its powers should be around that of the Heavenly Demon. Even 10 Little White Tigers wouldn’t be enough to win.

“I’m not asking you to fight with him, you’re only in charge of distracting him,” Ye Qingtang continued to coax.

Unless the black armor was directed away, they would never be able to get close to the Cursed True God’s remains.
