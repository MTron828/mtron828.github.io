Chapter 1131: Kill Her (3) Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Even if I can defeat Holy Lady… I will not do it!!” Blood Moon Elder gritted his teeth and clenched his fists.

Swoosh!

As the Blood Moon Elder finished his sentence, the Blood Moon Holy Lord raised his right arm slightly, and a red gleam penetrated Blood Moon Elder’s glabella instantly.

Just as Blood Moon Holy Lord was about to attack, Han Cangming took a step forward and dispelled that red gleam with the wave of a hand.

“Han Cangming, why do you want to be in my way?” Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at Han Cangming coldly.

A hint of confusion could be seen on Han Cangming’s face. He did not know why either, but it was as though all of this was a given and that was what he should do.

“I did not look for you, and you came to offer yourself instead. This is good too though.” As Blood Moon Holy Lord spoke, he turned into a blood-colored shadow and flew towards Han Cangming.

In just a moment, Han Cangming and Blood Moon Holy Lord were locked in a battle dozens of miles away.

Blood Moon Elder still had not recovered from the shock at this moment and looked at Ye Qingtang. “Holy Lady… did you… you… betray Holy Lord?”

“Betray?”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. When had she ever betrayed Blood Moon Holy Lord?

Ever since the war at Xuanling Sect, she had never seen Blood Moon Holy Lord at all. What betrayal could there be?

Furthermore, she did not do anything over this period of time…

Ye Qingtang could not understand what outrageous thing she did for her cheapskate brother to want to suddenly kill her.

The Blood Moon Elder understood when he saw Ye Qingtang’s confused expression.

He more or less knew what Ye Qingtang had done over this period of time, and she indeed did not do anything that betrayed the Blood Moon Holy Lord and the Blood Moon Sect.

Furthermore…

Although Ye Qingtang was Blood Moon Sect’s Holy Lady, she had not much connection with Blood Moon Sect in reality, and there was no such chance to betray it even if she wanted to.

But why did Holy Lord…

The more Blood Moon Elder thought about it, the more confused he was.

A thought suddenly struck Ye Qingtang. She looked at the severely injured demonic creature on the ground.

When this demonic creature chased after them earlier on, it said that someone wanted her life, and Ye Qingtang thought that the demonic creature was perhaps referring to someone from the You Ancient Clan.

But thinking about it now, it did not make much sense as that demonic creature was a member of the You Ancient Clan after all…

Could it be that the person that the demonic creature said was the Blood Moon Holy Lord?!

It was the Blood Moon Holy Lord who helped it to break Ling Yan’s Realistic Illusion… as he wanted to kill her with the demonic creature…

Thinking of it now, perhaps only the Blood Moon Holy Lord could easily break the Realistic Illusion with his skills.

However, Ye Qingtang could not understand why the Blood Moon Holy Lord suddenly wanted to take her life.

If the Blood Moon Holy Lord wished to kill her, he could have easily done so when they first met a long time ago. Why did he have to wait until this day?

Moreover, Ye Qingtang faintly sensed that although Blood Moon Holy Lord wanted to kill her, he seemed to be unwilling to do it himself. Regardless of giving the demonic creature a chance to kill her or ordering Blood Moon Elder to do so, it seemed that he wanted to kill her through others…

Given his skills, it was clearly simpler for him to kill her himself…

Ye Qingtang found the situation increasingly strange. Furthermore, judging from the reactions of Blood Moon Holy Lord and Han Cangming, it seemed that they knew each other as well. What exactly was going on?

More and more questions flooded Ye Qingtang’s mind, and it was probable that she would not be able to understand the current situation in a short time.
