Chapter 1371 Quack 1

when there were many people, the citizens who came to worship her filled the streets near the manor, and the densely-populated streets formed a magnificent scene.

ye qingtang, who was focused on cultivation, was completely unaware of it.

in contrast, after learning about the situation, the emperor ordered people to spread the news that an immortal reincarnated in the yuan kingdom and notified the citizens that they were building an immortal pavilion, where the immortal would personally preach to the yuan citizens in no time.

once the information was released, the citizens in the imperial city were extremely delighted. in no time, apart from the imperial city, the news spread to the entire yuan kingdom, and there was an influx of “pilgrims” in the imperial city.

after the emperor swallowed the “immortality pill” that ye qingtang gave him, his gray sideburns lessened greatly, which strengthened the emperor’s desire to keep the immortal in the yuan kingdom.

he spent a large amount of money to build an immortal pavilion for ye qingtang and even told the whole yuan kingdom to be respectful to the immortal, or else any offenders would be killed along with their entire family.

the emperor moved quickly perhaps to ask for more immortality pills after serving her well. in half a month, the construction of the immortal pavilion was completed.

the immortal pavilion was about a hundred meters tall, which seemed to reach the clouds. moreover, its interior was exquisitely designed.

on the day that he invited ye qingtang to enter the immortal pavilion, the emperor even attracted many citizens over to worship according to the norms of an emperor’s ascension.

standing on the immortal pavilion, ye qingtang looked down at all the citizens who kneeled on the ground and had a complicated feeling…

but at this instant, the god of nature who floated behind her said leisurely, “congratulations, the second mission is completed.”

although he was congratulating her, there was no happiness in his tone at all.

ye qingtang looked at the two nebula points that she just received, and her lips twitched.

two missions, three nebula points…

the points required to exchange for items in the star pavilion easily reached thousands, and ye qingtang wished she could kick the god of nature down from the immortal pavilion. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

she had seen a shameless person before but not such a shameless one.

she no longer counted on the nebula points. fortunately, the spirit energy in this world comforted her injured soul.

“immortal, the citizens are extremely thankful for your kindness and wish to know if you are willing to show your face,” the emperor said in between pants after climbing up the pavilion where he saw ye qingtang standing upright.

previously, when ye qingtang entered the immortal pavilion, the emperor was afraid that the immortal disliked mortals looking at her and thus specially ordered the citizens to kneel down and lower their heads.

thinking that she had to stay in this world for a period of time anyways, ye qingtang did not say anything. then, she raised her foot lightly, flew straight out of the immortal pavilion, and floated in the air above everyone.

everyone in the city trembled in awe at the sight, causing a deafening stir.

“ahhh! immortal!”

“greetings, immortal!”

the citizens were extremely excited.

ye qingtang raised a hand and retrieved a bottle of water from her space ring. with the flick of a finger, raindrops scattered down.

the citizens were completely aroused as they looked up to cautiously welcome the rain dew that the immortal bestowed. after drinking it, their expressions were that of extreme satisfaction as though they were in paradise.

ye qingtang stared blankly. “…”

that water was used to quench her thirst on normal days and was retrieved from some random spring in the wild. however, she always had it with her when cultivating, so it contained a little spirit energy in it.
