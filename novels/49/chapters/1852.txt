Chapter 1853: One More Round (2)

“Er... I don’t think so. I already know what I needed to know.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

The fat catfish wasn’t willing to just give up like that. “I only told you about the rules just now. Don’t you want to know about the dangers?”

It was clear that the fat catfish was taking advantage of the fact that they were new and were completely clueless about the place.

“Damn it, why didn’t you say it just now? You hid it from us on purpose!” Jiang Shaobai rolled his sleeves up, preparing to punch the fat catfish.

The fat catfish replied, “You only mentioned the rules and I told you all of that. The dangers aren’t part of the stakes. If we just have one more round, I’ll tell you everything.”

Ye Qingtang hesitated. “It’s fine, we’ll be extra careful. It was pure luck just now... This bangle is very important to me.” Ye Qingtang even pretended to touch her wrist carefully.

The fat catfish also knew that Ye Qingtang won because of luck just now. But it was exactly for this reason it felt even more indignant.

Moreover... it really wanted Ye Qingtang’s bangle.

The fat catfish took out the spirit stone it spat out just now.

“How about this, we’ll have another round. If you win, I’ll not only tell you the dangers of this place, I’ll also give you this spirit stone. You’re new here and definitely haven’t seen this. I’ve met some humans before, this spirit stone will be extremely useful for cultivation. It’s precious and rare for us too.”

Once Ye Qingtang heard that the spirit stones could help in cultivation, her eyes lit up.

She had already suspected that the spirit energy inside the spirit stones could be absorbed. Now the fat catfish just confirmed her suspicions.

But even so, Ye Qingtang still frowned. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“We have four people here, how can one spirit stone be enough?”

The corners of the fat catfish’s mouth twitched. This lass really thought that she would be able to win because of pure luck again?

The fat catfish wasn’t convinced that Ye Qingtang had such good luck, with its gambling skills, it wouldn’t be a problem winning. “Okay, I’ll give you four...”

“Five.” Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke, pointing at the little white tiger. “Include it too.”

The fat catfish’s face turned dark, but it quickly got a grip over itself.

Since she was this greedy, the fat catfish was determined to make her lose it all.

“Miss Ye, please don’t be rash. We’ve already learned the important stuff, there’s no need for you to gamble with it again,” Mu Feiruo advised.

He could tell that this fat catfish was pretty skillful. Ye Qingtang had won just now, but she wouldn’t be that lucky this time.

“There’s only one chance left. I’m asking for another round only because I haven’t had enough yet. I’ll be frank with you, it’s impossible for you to get the spirit stones unless you make a bet with other catfishes. However, they may not necessarily be interested in your stakes. Without the spirit stones, there’s no way you can avoid danger.”

The fat catfish pretended to be offering them serious advice.

“Stop trying to scare us into it.” Baili Xi frowned.

“Why would I?”

Ye Qingtang appeared hesitant, but she finally spoke up. “Let’s have... one more round.”
