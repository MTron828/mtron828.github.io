Chapter 686: Yuan Returning Stone (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In just a moment, the young man’s head was entirely chopped off by Shangguan Rui.

“How ugly.” Shangguan Rui lifted the young man’s head in the air and inspected it clearly as though he was admiring a piece of art.

However, Shangguan Rui did not seem to be very satisfied with this artwork and tossed it on the ground disinterestedly. Then, he lifted his right leg and stepped on the young man’s head.

The young man’s head was crushed by Shangguan Rui, and red and white liquid spattered everywhere.

The onlookers exchanged a few looks when they saw it. Shangguan Rui was really ruthless…

“Arh!”

After witnessing Shangguan Rui’s brutality, the girls in the cage shrieked.

“Clean it.” After cleaning the dirt off his shoes, Shangguan Rui looked at the slave master.

“Yes, yes, yes. I’ll clean it immediately.” The slave master nodded repeatedly and ordered someone to clear the unbearable sight that was the young man’s corpse.

For outsiders like them, provoking the other party without knowing their identity was mostly courting death.

…

Before long, the young man’s corpse was cleared, and the remains on the ground were cleaned.

Ye Qingtang had already walked to the wooden stage with the little white tiger. Her eyes darkened slightly as she watched the bloody scene.

At that instant, the girls in the cages were filled with despair and trembled in fear.

“This one is not bad. I want it.” Shangguan Rui regained interest and grinned at a girl with long, blue hair.

“Heh heh. Young Sir Shangguan, you really have a good eye. This girl is a supreme-grade slave. We caught her at the external frontiers of the sea outside Nine Nights Dynasty…”

Very quickly, the blue-haired girl was brought out from the cage by the slave master.

“Someone… Someone save me…” Expressions of despair filled the blue-haired girl’s face as she looked at the crowd helplessly.

However, the place was silent, and people only looked at each other indifferently.

No one would offend people like Shangguan Rui over a slave, and the young man from before was a lesson learned. There were many beauties in the world, and there was no need to risk their lives to fight for one.

“I… I have a Yuan Returning Stone. Whoever can save me… I will gift him the Yuan Returning Stone… I’m begging you all! Please!”

The girl knelt on the ground with tears streaming down her face.

“Yuan Returning Stone?”

The onlookers looked at each other.

The Yuan Returning Stone was a rare stone that could refine weapons, but it was not a main material and could not increase a cultivator’s skills. It was a type of energy stone that did not have many uses to a cultivator despite being extremely rare.

“F*ck. Yuan Returning Stone?!”

The little white tiger suddenly peeked its head out of Ye Qingtang’s arms and scanned the surroundings. “Soul Returning Stone. Where’s it? Where’s it?!” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Many people near Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger immediately.

An orange-colored tiger cub appeared before everyone’s eyes.

Ye Qingtang shot a look at the little white tiger. She clearly told it not to come out for nothing.

“Spirit animal?”

Several cultivators were amazed as they looked at the little orange tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arm.

The supposed spirit animal was completely different from a demonic beast: Demonic beasts kill by nature and had a murderous air while spirit animals were humane, and some could even speak the human language, though such cases were extremely rare.

However, while spirit animals were rare, it was not to the extent that its appearance could shock one.
