“Nothing much, and yet, you dared to make my Xuanling Sect disciple kneel to you? How bold of you.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Qingtang’s voice deepened as she spoke. The coldness in her voice caused the Wind Sword Sect disciples to break out in cold sweat in fear.

“It’s… It’s not it. It’s your Xuanling Sect disciples who started arguing with us first. Thus, we had a conflict,” a Wind Sword Sect disciple mustered his courage and said. This was also the truth in reality.

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang glanced at a few Xuanling Sect disciples. “What happened exactly?”

Qiao Mo and the rest obviously did not dare to conceal anything and recounted the incident fully without leaving out any details.

After hearing the account, Ye Qingtang swept a look across the Wind Sword Sect disciples’ faces. It was a brief glance, but the look in her eyes caused goosebumps to rise on all the Wind Sword Sect disciples.

“So… you want my junior brother to crawl between your legs and then kowtow to you in apology?” Ye Qingtang said coldly, but when she finished her sentence, her eyes suddenly sharpened.

She drew out her Demonic Blood Sword angrily.

The Demonic Blood Sword which was just strengthened was dangerously imposing. The moment it left its scabbard, a cold air spread in the air.

The Wind Sword Sect disciples’ legs wobbled in fear at the sight.

This was the skill of an inner sect disciple. Before making a strike, they were already exuding such a terrifying and overbearing force. The Wind Sword Sect disciples’ faces paled instantly, and they did not even dare to let out a fart.

Looking at Ye Qingtang, warmth spread in the hearts of Qiao Mo and the rest.

Thinking about how they were tightly chased by the Wind Sword Sect disciples for these few days, did they still dare to act so arrogantly to them with Senior Sister Ye here right now?!

Ye Qingtang’s back view was originally tiny, but at that instant, it seemed extremely tall and large.

“Why? Are you bullying us because you think our Xuanling Sect is lacking?” Ye Qingtang scoffed.

The Wind Sword Sect disciples were about to vomit in fear from Ye Qingtang’s aura but did not dare to retort and only shook their heads violently.

“It was just a casual talk, yet how dare you corner my junior brothers and not let them go for days? How should I settle this score?” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

The Wind Sword Sect disciples were so close to weeping.

A casual talk?

How was it a casual talk?!!

It was clearly Qiao Mo who started the fight. Why did it seem like they intentionally stirred up trouble when Ye Qingtang said it?

But they did not dare to argue at that instant.

The other party was an inner sect disciple and was on a completely different level from them.

When they saw inner sect disciples on usual days, all of them were extremely respectful and cautious.

“This senior sister over here… You can… settle it however you want…” The Wind Sword Sect disciples were really frightened then.

Ye Qingtang was not anxious to reply and instead turned around to look at Qiao Mo and the rest. “How are your injuries?”

Their injuries were not severe and were mostly external injuries. It was just that they seemed rather miserable after being chased. They were about to speak, but Ye Qingtang turned around by herself and spoke to the Wind Sword Sect disciples.

“You all caused my junior brothers to be so heavily injured and delayed their return to the sect to submit their mission. Of course, you all must compensate for their loss.”

“…” The Wind Sword Sect disciples’ eyes were about to pop out.

Heavily injured?

How were they heavily injured?!

Qiao Mo and the rest were dumbfounded.

Where did Senior Sister Ye see that they were heavily injured?!
