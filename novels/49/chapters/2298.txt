Chapter 2299: Selection Trials (2)

“Heaven knows where he has been recently. I don’t think I’ve seen him in three months. Since he had that new teacher, he’s been absent for entire days. Did you know that when I went to find him a few months ago, he told me not to disturb his cultivation… I nearly died laughing.” One of the Leiting family youths grinned.

“I think this is a good thing. Now that he’s absorbed in his own world, he seldom stirs trouble in the academy. Otherwise, we would have to keep cleaning up his mess.”

“You’re right. If not for the Clan Master’s instructions, with his lousy skills and antagonistic character, he would have been beaten to death already.”

The Leiting family youths couldn’t help smirking as they talked about Lei Yan.

Although they came from the same clan, they looked down on Lei Yan’s mediocre talents and bullying manner. The only reason they protected him was because they were instructed to do so by the Clan Master and because of Lei Yan’s status as the clan’s young master.

“I heard that the elders are questioning the Clan Master’s favoritism toward Lei Yan. If Lei Yan is kicked out of the Netherworld Academy, the Clan Master will no longer have any excuses…”

“That’s right. It’s fine that the Clan Master favors Lei Yan and invests so much of the family resources to groom that useless boy… It’s fine if Lei Yan tries his best and shows some results, but we all know what kind of guy he is. If the Leiting family lands in his hands, we will only be following in the footsteps of the Qin family…”

“Oh yes, didn’t we hear that the academy was supposed to kick him out? Why hasn’t there been any news since?”

“Who knows? Perhaps the Inter-Academy Competition selection trials are taking precedence and this matter has been pushed to the side for the time being.”

“I think the academy might be having second thoughts about kicking him out.”

The youths chatted when a voice suddenly rang out beside them. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Having second thoughts about kicking him out? Is he fit to be in the Netherworld Academy? Lei Yan would only be able to stay on in the academy until after the selection trials. Thereafter, he will definitely be kicked out.”

The Leiting family youths immediately turned toward the voice.

Meng Yao was walking past with a few other teenagers in her tow.

The Leiting family youths were all startled by the sight of Meng Yao.

Previously, Meng Yao’s cultivation level was not that outstanding in the Netherworld Academy, she could only be considered as a mid-level talent. But over the past few months, her powers had somehow shot up and she was currently at the Paragon Ninth Heaven level mid-stage. She was just one step away from the Divine Lord level.

Now, Meng Yao had been recommended by Teacher Di Nuo as a candidate for the selection trials.

The Leiting family youths did not like Lei Yan but no matter how messy one’s domestic affairs were, one still had to protect the name of the family in front of outsiders. However, the youths hesitated after seeing Meng Yao.

“Never mind, no need to clash with Meng Yao just because of Lei Yan. This girl’s power has risen tremendously so it’s best not to provoke her.” Those youths were no match for Meng Yao if they got into a fight.

The Leiting family youths kept silent.

Meng Yao chuckled. Her newly-enhanced powers magnified her naturally-arrogant character. Although she didn’t have any beef with Lei Yan before, unfortunately, Lei Yan was now a student of Ye Qing.

Ye Qing had previously humiliated Meng Yao because of Mu Ziying, and Meng Yao remembered that incident very clearly.

An unofficial, inferior trash of a teacher. There was no way she would let go of this grudge.
