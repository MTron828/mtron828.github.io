Chapter 2205: Heaven Fire Elixir (1)

In the bamboo grove outside the classroom, Qin Feng was kneeling in front of the flower gardens with no expression. Ye Qing had asked him to plant a few seeds previously and some of them had already sprouted. The little shoots looked extremely green against the soil.

While he didn’t know the reason, he had felt uncomfortable when Ye Qing had asked him to plant the flowers. But as they slowly grew and the little shoots started breaking through the soil, his tumultuous feelings vanished slowly as well. He began to take care of them meticulously every day and wanted to see what beautiful flowers the seeds he had planted would grow into.

“I didn’t believe them when they told me but it seems like you’ve really been planting flowers, Qin Feng.” A familiar voice floated from behind him.

Qin Feng raised his brows slightly. He turned and saw Qin Xuan with another two boys standing behind him. Turning back quickly, he patted the soil off his hands and got ready to leave.

“Brother Qin Feng, don’t hurry off.” Qin Xuan stepped forwards and blocked his path.

“Let go,” Qin Feng said coldly.

Qin Xuan smiled.

“Why? Is Brother Qin Feng embarrassed? You should be. The Qin family’s unique talent is hated by all the teachers and even the new teacher is asking you to just plant flowers... but that’s right, even if the new teacher gives you some advice, it’s useless. No matter how hard you try, your power will only regress. You should be doing tasks that suit you,” Qin Xuan said as he looked at the shoots that had just sprouted.

Although Qin Xuan’s tone was modest, every word cut like a knife into Qin Feng’s heart.

Qin Xuan looked at Qin Feng, wanting to see his angry expression. He used to gaze up at the talented Qin Feng and now that he was under his feet, it felt great.

He wanted to see Qin Feng fall into the soil and never get up again.

Qin Xuan wanted to be the only talent in the Qin family.

But Qin Xuan sensed something strange this time. Even though there was annoyance in Qin Feng’s eyes, it wasn’t the repressed anger from the other day.

“Hey, what are you doing!” Just as Qin Xuan was starting to get confused, Lei Yan and the others who had come to deliver the pills saw them blocking Qin Feng and rushed up quickly to his side.

In the blink of an eye, Lei Yan, Nangong Lie and the rest were standing in front of Qin Feng, distancing him from Qin Xuan.

Qin Xuan was surprised by the sudden appearance of Nangong Lie. Seeing them rush up to protect him, Qin Feng was also a little stunned.

D*mn! Qin Xuan! Lei Yan looked carefully and realized that the person standing in front of him was Qin Xuan. He felt slightly bad.

Qin Xuan was in the Holy Venerate Ninth Heaven and was one step away from the Divine Lord realm. He had a bad feeling about this. Lei Yan was usually loud but toned down when he saw elite students like Qin Xuan.

“Qin Feng, these are your friends?” Qin Xuan’s eyes swept across them and his lips curled into a sarcastic smile.

“Birds of a feather really... flock together.”

Qin Feng’s expression was dark.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
