Du Sheng was slightly stunned, and he flashed an apologetic smile at Ye Qingtang rather awkwardly.

Very quickly, Du Sheng walked to Chu Yi and the rest and said, “Please.”

Since Master Du had already given the orders to chase the visitors away, everyone did not dare to stay any longer and could only leave.

“Alright. Sorry to bother you, Master Du. When it’s convenient for you, I’ll come and pay respects again.” Chu Yi cupped his fists and subsequently left the Bliss Forging Workshop.

After leaving the Bliss Forging Workshop, Chu Yi glanced at the workshop coldly, and an icy smile hung on his lips.

Today, Chu Yi was not depressed over Master Du’s rejection but unknowingly excited instead.

That fellow could take out 500 grams of Millennium Meteoric Iron from his space ring so casually. It seemed that there was even more Millennium Meteoric Iron in his space ring!

…

In the Bliss Forging Workshop, Master Du led Ye Qingtang into the back of the hall while the blue-haired girl was told to remain in the front of the hall.

“You said that the payment is 500 grams of Millennium Meteoric Iron earlier on. Is that still valid?” Master Du asked Ye Qingtang.

“Of course.” Ye Qingtang nodded with a smile.

“Junior, although the Millennium Meteoric Iron is a treasure… an Extraordinary Flame is required to forge the Millennium Meteoric Iron. It is difficult for ordinary flames to refine it…” Master Du hinted at another meaning.

Since this person could take out the Millennium Meteoric Iron, he must have some Extraordinary Flame ingredients with him as well.

The Millennium Meteoric Iron would only have its worth when an Extraordinary Flame could be started. Otherwise, it was ultimately a useless metal.

“Junior, not to hide from you, I have no use for these Millennium Meteoric Iron of yours… I don’t have the fire source of an Extraordinary Flame. Even if I obtain this Millennium Meteoric Iron, it is still impossible to refine it.” Master Du shook his head.

“So your meaning is?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“If you can find some fire sources for an Extraordinary Flame, you don’t need to give me 500 grams of Millennium Meteoric Iron as payment. Just three taels are enough.” Master Du answered.

No matter how good a meteoric iron was, there was no use if there was no way of refining it.

“Are you talking about this?” As Ye Qingtang spoke, she flicked her wrist, and a golden flame emerged in her palms and swayed energetically.

“This is…?!” Master Du stared at the golden flame in Ye Qingtang’s hand, and astonishment filled his eyes.

Although Ye Qingtang did not possess an Extraordinary Flame, the might of the flame from her Ultimate Origin Skill was not any weaker than an Extraordinary Flame.

In the next second, an inexplicable excitement emerged in Master Du’s eyes.

“My flame compares favorably with an Extraordinary Flame and can refine the Millennium Meteoric Iron,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“Not bad…” At that instant, there was a change in the way that Master Du looked at Ye Qingtang. It was as though he was inspecting a certain treasure.

“Master, so about building a weapon…” Ye Qingtang felt a little unnatural with Master Du’s gaze. It was as though she became a piece of superior-quality meat.

“That’s a small matter. What is your name, little brother?” Master Du asked with a smile.

“Ye Chen.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Alright. Brother Ye Chen… forging a weapon is a small matter… Brother Ye Chen, I wish to collaborate with you…” Master Du’s eyes twinkled.

“Collaborate?” Ye Qingtang was confused.

“That’s right!” Master Du nodded with a mysterious expression on his face. “There’s a Dragon Vein… That place has a gathering of the richest spirit energy of this mainland… There are countless treasures in the Dragon Vein… However, that Dragon Vein is cornered by the Peerless School, Beiming Manor, and even the Phantom Valley forces…”
