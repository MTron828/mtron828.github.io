The Blood Moon Sect Elder was shocked.

What was going on? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Why was she so fierce?!

Was she going to eat someone alive?!

The Blood Moon Sect Elder then followed them to figure out what was going on.

Outside the Practice Hall, Song Junqiu was with the three disciples. Their faces were very pleasant.

“That girl’s growth is not bad at her age.”

“She will be nicer after a few years.”

“After a few years? I think her innocence now is just right. It is so satisfying to watch her begging me.” The three disciples laughed, and their faces were full of contentment.

Song Junqiu sneered as he saw how filthy the people were. He did not care about the girl at all. He was involved just because Ni Shang was Ye Qingtang’s servant.

Song Junqiu resented her so much every time he recalled how Ye Qingtang framed him and how he lost so many bottles of Song Junqiu to Feng Moli. Now Ye Qingtang was not in the sect, there was no issue for inner sect disciples to punish her attendant girl.

When the three people were discussing, Song Junqiu noticed a person approaching. He narrowed his eyes and exchanged glances with the three people. The three of them stopped their discussion and looked towards the person.

All three of them laughed.

“Isn’t this our Junior Sister Ye? What happened to your sword boy? How come he is injured? It’s a bit too harsh for you to treat your servant like this…” One of the disciples smiled and said. His arrogant face appeared so disgusting.

Fei Ying, who followed Ye Qingtang, wanted to go forward when he saw Song Junqiu and the three people, but he was stopped by Ye Qingtang.

“Junior Sister Ye, what are you so angry for?” Song Junqiu smiled, but his scornful sight glanced at Ye Qingtang.

“Where is Ni Shang?” Fei Ying stared at them and asked.

Song Junqiu took a glance at Fei Ying and sneered. His eyes were full of disdain. He looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “Junior Sister Ye, where are your servant’s manners? A mere sword boy dares to challenger inner sect disciples?”

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes and pulled Fei Ying back. She scanned through their faces, and… she suddenly smiled.

“I had entered the inner sect for a month now. I heard that inner sect disciples could compete among ourselves. Senior Brothers, are you willing to compete against me in the Life and Death Ring?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Life and Death Ring?” Song Junqiu and the rest were stunned.

The sect did not allow private fighting among the disciples, but there were always conflicts between disciples. To ban private fighting, there was a Life and Death Ring in the inner sect.

On the Life and Death Ring, death was determined by destiny. Even if one were to die on the Ring, no one would receive any punishment.

However, fighting on the Life and Death Ring needed to be approved by the inner sect wardens. Both parties had to sign the Life and Death agreement.

Ye Qingtang just entered the sect for a month, and she dared to challenge them?!

Song Junqiu and the rest laughed when they realized what she was talking about.

“Junior Sister Ye, you want to go onto the Life and Death Ring against four of us? Are you joking?”
