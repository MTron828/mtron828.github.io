Chapter 2634 Han Cangming’s Ambush (5)

“Heh, up to you. It is not important to me… Earlier on, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was already stirring. It wanted to devour the Immortal Emperor’s essence.” Han Cangming continued.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly when she heard Han Cangming. Could it be that Han Cangming had already sensed it from the beginning…

But what did he want? Why did he keep mentioning her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Woman, I’ll give you two choices,” Han Cangming smiled.

“Just two?” Ye Qingtang stared at Han Cangming and an ominous premonition arose in her heart.

Han Cangming ignored Ye Qingtang and continued, “The first option is for me to kill you and take out your Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. The second option is for me to kill you but preserve your soul. If you have the ability, you can think of a way to possess someone and be reborn. Of course, I don’t care whether you possess a human, demon, or beast. How about it?”

“You… wish to take my Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline…” Ye Qingtang stared at Han Cangming with a cold glint in her eyes.

“Not wish to take.” Han Cangming immediately shook his head and smiled. “Will take.”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was silent, Han Cangming continued, “Alright, I’ll give you three counts to decide.”

“Three.”

“Two.”

“One.”

Han Cangming counted down. Seeing that Ye Qingtang had not said anything, Han Cangming smiled and said, “Fine. Since you don’t want to choose, I will choose for you.”

As he spoke, Han Cangming moved his hand and Ye Qingtang’s body was suddenly gripped tightly by an invisible force. She could not move at all.

Ye Qingtang could not resist this supreme power at all.

She realized that even the Deity Ocean in her body was restrained by this invisible force and could not be activated.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed slightly. Could it be that after she came to this era… the final outcome would be her death at Han Cangming’s hands?!

In the past, Ye Qingtang had thought of the countless ways she might die. She even thought that she might be killed by the Heavenly Emperor. However, she never expected to be killed by Han Cangming.

This was truly a boundless world… full of wonders.

In the next second, without giving Ye Qingtang any chance to think further, Han Cangming took a step forward and appeared beside Ye Qingtang

“Woman, death is the price for possessing a forbidden bloodline. You don’t have the ability to protect it. That is why you must die.” As he spoke, Han Cangming smiled and pointed at the area between Ye Qingtang’s brows.

Sensing the extremely overwhelming force of an Immortal Emperor, Ye Qingtang was powerless to resist. Even though she was much stronger than before, she was still as insignificant as an ant before an Immortal Emperor.

“Don’t be afraid…”

Just as Ye Qingtang was feeling a little hopeless, an ethereal voice entered her ears and reached the depths of her heart.

At the final moment before death, Ye Qingtang was surprised. Did she hear wrongly… Wasn’t it Ling Yan’s voice?

“Swoosh!”

A terrifying red light suddenly shot out of Ye Qingtang’s body. The red light was too fast and attacked Han Cangming.

“Heh, you can still use divine powers after being restricted by me… not bad indeed.” Han Cangming gave a faint smile at the red light charging towards him.

Han Cangming waved his hand at the red light, wanting to disperse it.
