Chapter 1260: What Was Going On? (1)

This had already exceeded the limit that she could bear!

Death seemed to be befalling in the next second.

Yet, just as Ye Qingtang was completely disheartened, the enormous force injected into her palm seemed to be devoured by some energy.

In the next second, a black air of death shot out of Ye Qingtang’s wrist and into Luo Qufeng’s palm directly.

Boom!

Luo Qufeng was hurled out suddenly. Black streaks of an air of death interlaced with his red gleam. Luo Qufeng fell on the ground suddenly and spat a mouthful of blood!

“…” Ye Qingtang was completely unaware of what happened.

She initially thought that she would die without a doubt.

Unexpectedly…

The person who flung out was actually Luo Qufeng?!

What was going on?!

Luo Qufeng was ghastly pale as he collapsed on the ground. Streaks of black blood rapidly crept around him.

When he and Ye Qingtang exchanged blows just now, he felt a rush of an air of death surging into his body suddenly, and he was hurled away in an instant. At this moment, his body temperature was dropping continuously, and a piercing cold was being injected into his whole body.

“Luo Qufeng also has this day!”

“The Holy Lord of Shadows’ skills are so frightening, yet Luo Qufeng dared to offend her. How ridiculous.”

“I’m afraid he really is dead this time!”

Everyone grew excited after seeing Luo Qufeng being severely injured by Ye Qingtang’s blow.

Ye Qingtang waved a hand to resolve the enormous force and dealt a serious injury to Luo Qufeng with a blow—all of this made everyone worship her skills greatly.

However, Ye Qingtang did not understand what was going on herself and felt that it was a little unreal as she watched Luo Qufeng crawl up from the ground.

How did she hurl Luo Qufeng away with one move?

Blood seeped out of Luo Qufeng’s mouth continuously. His eyes were filled with malice, and the coldness around his body brought him much pain.

“Holy Lord of Shadows… is indeed formidable…” Luo Qufeng puked a mouthful of blood.

Although Ye Qingtang did not know what was happening, the outcome was positive. She had an indifferent expression, and no one could tell her emotions. She had a manner like that of a supreme powerful figure, and no one dared to offend her at all.

However, this was only a delusion…

Ye Qingtang mumbled in her heart secretly.

He is seriously injured already. Hurry up and stop!!!!

Why was he still staring at her and not letting her go!

It had been two moves already. Were they not enough!

Everyone wanted Ye Qingtang to kill Luo Qufeng but…

At this instant, Ye Qingtang only hoped that Luo Qufeng would back down a little and hurry and let her off.

Luo Feng and the other Luo Family members were shocked to see that Luo Qufeng was heavily injured.

Luo Qufeng’s skills were extremely powerful to them, and they were very confident of his skills; thus, they were never worried even when they saw the Holy Lord of Shadows. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But now…

“Brother! Great Grandfather…” Luo Qi had an uneasy look.

Yet, Luo Feng frowned slightly and said coldly, “Don’t panic. Great Grandfather has not displayed his skills completely. Don’t forget what cultivation technique Great Grandfather cultivates. There are so many powerful figures here, and Great Grandfather’s powers will only continue to increase.”

Just as Luo Feng spoke, Luo Qufeng’s eyes turned cold suddenly.

Out of a sudden, he took a step forward and leaped up. He spread his arms out like an eagle would spread its wings as he flew right into the crowd and grabbed two powerful figures who were fighting with the Luo Family members.
