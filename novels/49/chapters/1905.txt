Chapter 1906: The Holy Lord’s Dharma Artifact (3)

Strangers in strange places. Countless scenes flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes, all completely unfamiliar to her but somehow, she felt like she had lived through them.

A brilliant light shone down on her and Ye Qingtang suddenly opened her eyes with a loud gasp.

Darkness. Dazzling lights. Flashing images. All those faded away from Ye Qingtang’s eyes. All that was left in her line of sight was Little White Tiger’s worried expression.

“What happened to you? Why did you suddenly faint?” Little White Tiger gazed nervously at Ye Qingtang.

Fear continued to swirl in Ye Qingtang’s heart as she gasped out breaths of air. She glanced down at herself, feeling as if she was still enveloped in a shroud of cold air. Her skin had even turned somewhat white from the chill.

“I...” Ye Qingtang wanted to explain but didn’t know what to say. She had seen many memories, all of which didn’t belong to her.

Ye Qingtang had been reincarnated before but she was very sure that those memories were not from her previous life.

The people in those memories were all strangers to her.

But...

Why had she seen all those memories then?

And wasn’t she the person at the center of those memories?

Nothing made sense to her, and Ye Qingtang was left feeling increasingly puzzled. She was completely bewildered by the sudden appearance of those flashing images.

She glanced down at her hand instinctively.

The finger bone had disappeared.

“Where’s the finger bone?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Wasn’t it in your hand all along?” Little White Tiger asked.

Ye Qingtang showed Little White Tiger her empty palm. It was likewise baffled.

What was going on?

How did the finger bone disappear?

“I think... I might know who the finger bone belonged to.” Ye Qingtang massaged her aching temples.

The Temple of Shadows had portraits of the Holy Lord of Shadows and the Holy Lord looked exactly like Ye Qingtang. The identical-looking person she had seen in those memories must be the Holy Lord.

“What do you mean?” Little White Tiger was confused.

“It means that the finger bone must belong to the Holy Lord of Shadows. When I took out that bone, I must have activated the power she had stored inside that bone. I saw many memory fragments belonging to the Holy Lord.” Ye Qingtang continued to rub her temples.

Those memory fragments were very chaotic and they flashed by too quickly. There was no discernible link between them and she had no idea what had happened.

“How... how did you activate the finger bone of the Holy Lord of Shadows?” Little White Tiger shot Ye Qingtang a strange look.

Ye Qingtang pursed her lips in a wry smile.

“I would like to know that too.”

First was the wearing of the Nine Souls Ring and then the opening of the gold-gilded black box. And now, she had somehow activated the finger bone belonging to the Holy Lord of Shadows, which had consequently disappeared. Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded by this weird string of events.

Little White Tiger couldn’t think of any plausible explanation either.

Just as Ye Qingtang wanted to get up, she was overcome by a wave of dizziness. The shroud of chilly air suddenly surged into her chest.

That chilly air brought with it a powerful burst of energy. It engulfed Ye Qingtang’s entire body.

“This... what’s happening?!” Ye Qingtang was stunned. The strange energy kept surging into her body, making her feel as if she was about to explode. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It felt like the energy was desperately trying to merge into Ye Qingtang’s body.
