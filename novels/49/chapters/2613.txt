Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

The Feng family patriarch, Father Feng, Mother Feng and the rest stood rooted to the ground. Their eyes were fixed on Ye Qingtang and for a moment, they did not know

what to say.

Meanwhile, the other Feng Yun family members were as silent as cicadas in the winter. They did not even dare to breathe loudly for fear that Ye Qingtang would kill them

all.

After a while, Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the Feng Yun family members. With a sneer, she said indifferently, “Get lost before I change my mind.”

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the Feng Yun family members heaved a sigh of relief as if they had just survived a great calamity. They thanked Ye Qingtang profusely

and fled from this place, afraid that she would change her mind.

“Not bad…”

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought as she sensed the energy absorbed from the Feng Yun family patriarch.

tt was a pity that she could not convert this energy immediately into her own power. Instead, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline’s autonomy had increased.

aturally, this was already a rare feat for Ye Qingtang. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Sister Ye Yue, you’re too awesome!”

Feng Jiuyou ran to Ye Qingtang excitedly.

Ye Qingtang smiled and said to the young Feng Jiuyou, “Believe me. In the future, you will be so powerful that the world will be shocked. You are destined to become a

powerful figure whom everyone will worship.”

Feng Jiuyou was surprised by Ye Qingtang’s words and his face turned red. “Sister Ye Yue, you… are exaggerating, but I will definitely become a powerful figure…”

o matter how thick-skinned Feng Jiuyou was, he could not accept Ye Qingtang’s claim that he would become a powerful figure whom everyone would worship.

“However, Sister Ye Yue, if what you said is true… did you discover some power that has not been developed in my body? Or an extremely powerful and rare super

bloodline?!” Feng Jiuyou asked excitedly after thinking for a moment.

Currently, Ye Qingtang’s status in Feng Jiuyou’s heart had already shot to its peak. Ye Qingtang could easily kill an Emperor-level figure. In that case, whatever Ye Qingtang

said must be true!

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck. She did not know what extraordinary bloodline and power Feng Jiuyou had. Whatever she knew, she only knew it because she had come from

the future.

Of course, Ye Qingtang would not reveal that. But she didn’t want to dampen Feng Jiuyou’s enthusiasm. So she only smiled and said, “Jiuyou, your belief is your sharpest

weapon. One day, you will reach the peak.”

“Yes, yes, yes!!” Feng Jiuyou nodded repeatedly and said, “Sister Ye Yue, I won’t disappoint you. I will definitely reach the top. I will become a super big shot!”

“Don’t worry, you can do it.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Sister Ye Yue, what about me!” Feng Wuyin suddenly ran up and tugged at the corner of Ye Qingtang’s clothes.

Ye Qingtang tilted her head and looked at Feng Wuyin. She really did not know…

“Don’t worry, Wuyin. You’re already stronger than me now, so you’ll definitely be even stronger in the future. In the future, we’ll all become famous experts!” Feng Jiuyou

smiled.

“Is that so, Sister Ye Yue?” Feng Wuyin seemed to want to hear Ye Qingtang’s confirmation.

“Yes, definitely.” Ye Qingtang nodded. It should be…

Although Ye Qingtang had read the historical records, Feng Wuyin had been a blood sacrifice when he was young. He had no future.

Even though Ye Qingtang had changed history, she could not predict what would happen to Feng Wuyin in the future..
