1220 Never Give Up 3

“But you… how did you come back to life?” The little white tiger quickly asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was unsure of how to answer this question. She herself was not sure how she had returned to life, so she was naturally unable to answer the little white tiger.

She thought that she was left only with despair. However, the little white tiger’s words had given Ye Qingtang a glimmer of hope.

If she could just find little You Yun, she could release all the living things in this mainland.

And then…

Everyone would return.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang suddenly raised her hand and wiped away her tears. She raised the little white tiger and kissed its head.

“You… woman, what are you doing!” The little white tiger was so shocked by this sudden kiss that its fur stood on end. But it glimpsed Ye Qingtang’s slight smile from the corner of its eye and slowly stopped worrying.

This damn woman looks so pretty.

Weeping and wailing do not suit her in the least.

“Thank you.” Ye Qingtang looked smilingly at the little white tiger.

“Don’t thank me. You’ll have to depend on your own ability to find little You Yun. You’ve seen the white-robed old man’s power. It won’t be easy to snatch little You Yun from the hands of the Ancient You Clan.” The little white tiger grunted as it lifted its front claw and kneaded the part of its head that Ye Qingtang had kissed.

“Even if it’s a chance in a million, I will not give up.” Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and looked at the blue horizon.

“Let’s go to Central Mainland…”

Ye Qingtang and the little white tiger swiftly plunged into the clouds and vanished. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Everyone… must be sure to wait for her.

…

In Central Mainland, on the peak of a tall mountain.

Ling Yan was standing at the edge of a cliff with his hands clasped behind his back. He looked at the layers of clouds and Ye Qingtang’s karmic natal chart. As he watched the karmic natal chart transform and take on a new pattern, his lips curved in a slight smile.

The little azure dragon was standing next to Ling Yan. It showed no joy as it looked at the smile on Ling Yan’s lips.

“Is it really worth it?”

Ling Yan smiled and removed the karmic natal chart with a wave of his hand.

“Yes.”

The little azure dragon sighed. Now that matters had reached this stage, whatever it said was futile.

Ye Qingtang’s death tribulation had disappeared, but it had been shifted to Ling Yan.

Before the little azure dragon could speak, Ling Yan turned and walked down the mountain.

“Where are you going?” asked the little azure dragon.

Ling Yan’s footsteps paused. He spoke laughingly without turning his head.

“Miss Ye will be arriving in Central Mainland soon.”

“…” The little azure dragon was silent.

It felt that Ling Yan’s actions were always unexpected when they had anything to do with Ye Qingtang.

“So what?” The little azure dragon could not help but mutter.

“Nothing much… I’m just looking forward to it.” Ling Yan spoke laughingly. As he finished speaking, he raised his eyes slightly towards the endless horizon.

Perhaps they would meet again very soon.

Was that not so?

…

The days passed.

In prosperous Central Mainland, the grass grew luxuriantly, and birds and beasts gathered in the thick forests.

One large and one small figure quietly appeared at the entrance of a gorge.

“F*ck, the spirit energy in this second largest mainland is really abundant…” The little white tiger was following Ye Qingtang. An excited glow flickered in its eyes as it stepped on the springy grass.

Ye Qingtang had brought it to Central Mainland two days ago. The little white tiger had never been to this mainland before. Now that it was here for the first time, it was truly excited by the air that was saturated with abundant spirit energy.
