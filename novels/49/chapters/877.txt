Chapter 878 Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix

“Shed off your human skin,” Ling Yan said after a while. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

As Ling Yan finished his words, a strange smile appeared on Master Du’s face. His entire body transformed into a layer of skin, and an azure little dragon walked out of the skin slowly.

“You told me that there was a place with Dragon Vein that belonged to my clan on this piece of mainland back then. You asked me to hide here and it has been so many years.” The little azure dragon stared at Ling Yan in discontentment.

“You belong to the dragon clan, one of the four Fiendcelestial Beasts, and only you can sense the presence of the Dragon Vein. You can also ignore the existence of the Dimension Wall.” Ling Yan smiled and said.

“Humph! I’m the great Fiendcelestial Beast with supreme intelligence. I was schemed by you previously… If not, how could I sign a contract with a useless person like you.” The little azure dragon scoffed coldly.

Ling Yan asked the little azure dragon to enter the mainland secretly back then. The little azure dragon then disguised as the refining master and searched for the Dragon Vein.

“However… If you’re the real Demon God, I will feel more balanced with the contract signed. Can’t you admit it to me?” The little azure dragon begged.

Ling Yan smiled and shook his head.

“Ling Yan, I don’t believe that my assumptions are wrong!” The little azure dragon refused to accept that it was wrong.

It suspected Ling Yan’s identity long ago. However, by coincidence, the Demon God, Han Cangming, transformed into a silver wolf and followed Ye Qingtang.

Based on the little azure dragon’s observation, Han Cangming had incredible martial ability and now functioned with little thoughts. He was still an empty body that contained energy. He could not even be called as a complete human!

“So, based on what you have said, the Demon God, Han Cangming, is the same person as me?” Ling Yan said.

“Wrong! Han Cangming was your name. Even the Demon God now was your body! You can trick everyone besides me. I belong to the azure dragon clan. We’re the most intelligent ones among all the demonic beasts… Of course, we’re slightly less intelligent than you. Slightly!” The little azure dragon shook its head and said.

“Nonsense. Don’t think about these things anymore. I’m Ling Yan, not the Demon God,” Ling Yan said.

“It’s okay if you don’t want to admit it. They were just my assumptions,” the little azure dragon said.

“Then I think it’s better for you to not presume things in the future.” Ling Yan stared at the little azure dragon meaningfully.

“Talk about the Dragon Vein,” Ling Yan said seriously after a short while.

“The Dragon Vein here is totally different from the one described in the rumors. One of the strong azure dragons in my clan fell in love with the Divine Phoenix. However, they encountered the Heavenly Demon, and that resulted in an epic war. The True Dragon and the Divine Phoenix fought together against the Heavenly Demon. Eventually, all three of them were dead and fell here.” The little azure dragon contemplated for a while and said.

“Furthermore, the white tiger beside Ye Qingtang knew about my true identity long ago. It just did not expose me. Why do you want me to lead Ye Qingtang to the Dragon Vein?” The little azure dragon was confused.

“Miss Ye is my best friend… I think the inheritance of Divine Phoenix in the Dragon Vein is suitable for her,” Ling Yan said.

“What?! Do you know how rare and precious the inheritance of Divine Phoenix is? Now you want to give it to her?! Giving it to me will be better than giving it to her! Are you humane? I treated you wholeheartedly all the time!” The little azure dragon’s face was filled with astonishment.

Ling Yan was not angry after hearing its words. He just smiled and said, “We’ll share the inheritance of the True Dragon. I don’t think that you’re suitable for the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.”
