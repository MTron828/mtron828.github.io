Forget it.?The Blood Moon Elder turned around and returned to the tent.

After being chided by someone he adored, the Yuehua Sect disciple paled instantly. All his previous anger was gone as he left dejectedly without knowing exactly what happened.

As Ye Qingtang watched the Yuehua Sect disciple leave, she subsequently turned around and looked at the Blood Moon Elder with a smile. “The feeling of being doted on by a man should be pretty good, isn’t it?”

“…” Helplessness filled the Blood Moon Elder.

Ye Qingtang walked towards the Blood Moon Elder. She did not joke around anymore and instead informed the Blood Moon Elder everything about Ouyang Qian.

The Ouyang family clan of Nine Nights Dynasty was the number one family clan in Nine Nights Dynasty, and it was not weaker than the super sects.

The Ouyang clan had very strong powers and heritage, and it could even compete with the Falling Sky Valley of the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Currently, the Blood Moon Elder had possessed Ouyang Qian’s body, and this was equivalent to replacing Ouyang Qian. Eventually, he had to return to the Ouyang Qian in the future. Thus, he had to know everything about the Ouyang clan; otherwise, there was a high possibility that he would be exposed.

As for Ouyang Qian’s background, Ye Qingtang already knew everything clearly from when she interacted with her in her previous life.

Ouyang Qian was the daughter that Family Master Ouyang doted on and spoiled the most. Now that the Blood Moon Elder replaced Ouyang Qian, it would be of great help to Ye Qingtang in the future!

After ensuring that the Blood Moon Elder completely remembered everything she said, she finally let him leave.

Before he left, Ye Qingtang specially reminded the Blood Moon Elder to return to Ouyang Qian’s residence to prevent further suspicion.

“I hope that we can leave the Hell of Avicinaraka alive…”

After the Blood Moon Elder left, Ye Qingtang sighed softly.

The Hell of Avicinaraka was too dangerous, and one could die in it if just a tad careless. If that was really the case, whatever she did would all be pointless.

Ye Qingtang did not sleep a wink that night. Sitting cross-legged on the ground, she entered a state of meditation and consolidated her cultivation skills.

Currently, Ye Qingtang’s martial cultivation level had already reached the peak of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two and was only a half-step away from entering Martial Qi Level Three.

Although the Hell of Avicinaraka was extremely dangerous, it was very beneficial to raising the skills of cultivators. From ancient times to now, the more dangerous a place was, the better it was at stimulating the potential of cultivators. Naturally, the speed of cultivation here could not be compared to that in the external world.

Moreover, danger coexisted with crises. The more dangerous a place was, the more destinies there would be.

There were definitely many destinies in the Hell of Avicinaraka. However, it was unknown who could gain it or even leave this place alive after gaining it.

The night was silent.

At twilight, the first faint streaks of dawn appeared in the sky. As day broke, a burst of scoldings could be heard outside the tents.

Ye Qingtang slowly opened her eyes, rose, and walked out in great strides. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Feng Cong and the rest were already there.

After seeing Ye Qingtang, that Yuehua Sect disciple shouted furiously and immediately drew out a Yellow-Grade weapon from his waist.

“Lin Cong, why are you doing this?” Feng Cong asked with a frown when he saw the Yuehua Sect disciple’s actions.

“This bastard actually snatched my women. I must kill him today!” the Yuehua Sect disciple, Lin Cong, said coldly as he glared at Ye Qingtang furiously.

He thought about it for a long time last night and completely could not accept Ouyang Qian’s abrupt change which happened after Ye Qingtang’s appearance. As such, he pushed all of the blame onto Ye Qingtang.
