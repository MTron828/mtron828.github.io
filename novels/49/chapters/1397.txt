1398 Sacred Ground of Reflection 3

Ming Wang felt that it was disrespectful for the Sacred Ground of Reflection to send these small fries and immediately agreed to Ye Qingtang’s orders. He lifted an ambassador up from the ground and threw him out.

That ambassador was merely at the Arcane Supremacy realm and was not Ming Wang’s opponent. After being thrown out, he fell flat on the stone stairs outside the palace and lost consciousness.

The Sacred Ground of Reflection people did not think that Ye Qingtang would really order someone to strike at them.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, what do you mean by this?” The ambassador who was initially tactful could not hold his smiles anymore.

“Get lost yourself or get thrown out by people?” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

The expressions of the ambassadors from the Sacred Ground of Reflection expression turned extremely ugly. The Sacred Ground of Reflection was also a top force in the Central Mainland, and even the Emperors and powerful figures feared it.

However, the Holy Lord of Shadows never showed them a good attitude and even wanted them to get lost right now.

The Sacred Ground of Reflection ambassadors who had always carried themselves in a superior manner were boiling with anger. Nonetheless, they were not foolish. They were currently in the Temple of Shadows’s territory, and they would be at a disadvantage if they really fell out with Ye Qingtang.

Moreover, their skills were not very high, and the Sacred Ground of Reflection sent them with the intention to test the Temple of Shadows. If they really fought, none of them would be able to leave the Temple of Shadows alive.

Then, those ambassadors immediately left with a gloomy face without waiting for Ming Wang to do the deed.

However, they would bear this grudge.

“The Sacred Ground of Reflection is behaving more and more inappropriately. They actually sent these pieces of trash to the Temple of Shadows.” Lady Ghost commented coldly as she watched the Sacred Ground of Reflection people leave.

The Temple of Shadows was indeed on the decline in the past thousands of years. However, their Holy Lord had returned, and returning to their peak was not an issue!

“The Sacred Ground of Reflection was disrespectful first. However, I’m afraid that today’s incident will not be over so easily. The Sacred Ground of Reflection will not let this matter go,” Xue Fu rubbed his chin and said.

Ye Qingtang humiliated the Sacred Ground of Reflection, and given the Sacred Ground of Reflection’s personality, how could it endure this embarrassment?

However, if they discussed with the Sacred Ground of Reflection ambassadors courteously today, the Temple of Shadows would probably be embarrassed instead.

Did those small fries have the qualifications to question their Holy Lord?!

“They can come if they dare.” Ye Qingtang scoffed as though she never regarded the Sacred Ground of Reflection with importance.

If they really came, she would flee…

Furthermore…

The Sacred Ground of Reflection might not be able to defeat the Temple of Shadows as the eight tribe leaders were still keeping watch after all.

Ye Qingtang was not too favorable of the Sacred Ground of Reflection. Moreover, the matter that the Sacred Ground of Reflection mentioned concerned Ling Yan, and no one knew what would happen if they continued haggling about that matter.

But given the Holy Lord of Shadows’s personality, she would chase them away immediately.

Ming Wang and the rest did not know what Ye Qingtang was thinking of, but her tone was extremely forceful and stern like the Holy Lord of Shadows in her peak back then.

That’s right! How would the Holy Lord of Shadows, who was once at the pinnacle of power, fear any forces?

Fight if you want to!

Ming Wang’s eyes flickered, and an indiscreet smile emerged in his eyes. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The Sacred Ground of Reflection and Temple of Shadows were completely unrelated. Even when the Holy Lord of Shadows was present, they did not have any connections, and there had never been any conflicts. After all, no one dared to offend the Holy Lord of Shadows back then.

Yet, this first time happened when Ye Qingtang was pretending to be the Holy Lord of Shadows.
