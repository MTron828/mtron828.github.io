Chapter 1036 Pray

The few of them were extremely worried about Ye Qingtang as well.

The war between Xuanling Sect and Yunxiao Sect was extremely horrific. Although the Blood Moon Sect appeared afterward, the Ultimate Elder suddenly showed up too, thus causing Xuanling Sect to be in this state.

However, if Ye Qingtang did not appear as the Blood Moon Holy Lady, Xuanling Sect would probably have been annihilated by Yunxiao Sect already.

“Don’t worry. Junior Sister Ye is a dignified Blood Moon Holy Lady. Blood Moon Sect is such a strong force. How can anything happen to Junior Sister Ye?” Yun Shu said.

“Although the Blood Moon Sect is powerful, it is the enemy of this entire mainland. It is an evil cult!” Qin Huan said hurriedly.

Upon hearing that, some miserable-looking Xuanling Sect disciples fixed their eyes on Qin Huan successively.

If there was no Ye Qingtang or evil cult as mentioned by Qin Huan, they would have already become corpses a long time ago and not talking as they were right now.

“Without the Blood Moon Sect, we would have been dead already,” Lin Long said.

Qin Huan nodded without retort. His eyes landed on a tomb forest not far away as an inexplicable sorrow emerged on his face.

In this half year, the disciples who once fought for Xuanling Sect sustained heavy injuries and were unable to be treated by the outside world, eventually passing on. In the past, these brothers and sisters were not afraid of strong enemies, but in the end, they were unable to persist and could no longer see the rays of hope.

Other than the Xuanling Sect disciples, there were several wardens and senior executives who were severely injured as well. In addition to this was the poor environment conditions which resulted in damage to their martial foundation, causing their martial skills to dip extensively. Unable to resolve this mental distress, they eventually fell into depression and died.

At this instant, Elder Mo and Elder Qin arrived in the vicinity of the Martial Arts Hall. Looking at the Xuanling Sect disciples who were lying on the ground and seated everywhere, they could not help but sigh.

The sight of this dilapidated Xuanling Sect led them to recall the prosperity of the past.

“Greetings Sect Master… and two Elders.”

Seeing that the Sect Master and the elders arrived at the Martial Arts Hall, the Xuanling Sect disciples hurriedly stood up and bowed at them.

Noticing the situation, the Xuanling Sect Sect Master hurriedly waved his hands. “There’s no need to bow. Quickly rest. Don’t waste your energy.”

Looking at the scrawny and listless Xuanling Sect disciples and then recalling memories of them in the past, the Sect Master was in anguish. It was as though there were billions of needles poking at his heart.

A long while later, Elder Qin and Elder Mo followed the Xuanling Sect Sect Master to a tomb forest ahead.

There were hundreds of tombs in the forest.

The bodies of a portion of them no longer existed since the war; thus, the sect could only build a tomb containing the personal effects of the deceased to mourn those valiant Xuanling Sect disciples who died in the battle.

At the same time, Qin Huan, Yun Shu, and many other disciples followed the Sect Master to the tomb forest.

“Brothers, we are here to visit you…”

Many Xuanling Sect disciples immediately kneeled and bowed before the tombs.

Looking at these nameless tombs, it was as though they returned to the night before the great war.

Everyone drank and chatted together and learned from each other before the bonfire; it was as if those voices and faces never left.

The battle cry seemed to ring in their ears again at this very moment.

We use our blood to soak Xuanling’s flag!

We use our hearts to light Xuanling’s anger!

We use our hands to hit Xuanling’s drums!F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com
