Chapter 2562: Identical (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Countless prodigies in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain tried their best to enter the Dragon Emperor Clan and become their disciple. But very few were able to succeed.

With Ye Qingtang’s martial arts talent and skills, it was impossible for her to enter the ancient Dragon Emperor Clan through official means.

Long Yun believed that if Ye Qingtang had the chance, she would be willing to stay in the Dragon Emperor Clan no matter what.

“Yes, that’s possible. Let her stay on as a disciple of the clan. Perhaps she will be of use in the future.” The black-robed elder nodded slightly.

The status of a Dragon Emperor Clan disciple was only below that of a direct bloodline descendant. Generally speaking, it was rare to have someone enter the clan and be given the title of a disciple.

...

In the guest room area, Long Yun knocked on the door and entered while Ye Qingtang was cultivating.

“Senior.”

Ye Qingtang smiled when she saw Long Yun.

“Miss Ye, I’m here today to discuss something with you,” Long Yun looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded and smiled. “Senior, please let me know if you have any instructions for me.”

“It’s like this. Miss Ye, are you willing to join the Dragon Emperor Clan?” Long Yun went straight to the point.

“Join the Dragon Emperor Clan?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback. Why would they suddenly let her join the Dragon Emperor Clan…

“Miss Ye grew up in the Blue Sky Domain. With the scarce martial arts culture and resources of that domain, it is rare for Miss Ye to be able to cultivate to the Fifth Heaven level Divine Lord. Therefore, I have already spoken with the higher-ups of our clan. We hope that Miss Ye can join our Dragon Emperor Clan,” Long Yun said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought. With the status of a disciple of the Dragon Emperor Clan, she should be able to obtain the information that she needed.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang remained silent, Long Yun continued softly, “This is your first time in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and you might be a little unfamiliar with the Dragon Emperor Clan. If you are willing, I can allow you to join us as a disciple of the clan. Under normal circumstances, young prodigies in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain must be at least at the sub-Emperor level or have a special bloodline to join. In addition, they cannot be beyond the age of 30. They must also pass the various strict tests of the Dragon Emperor Clan before they get the chance to join as a disciple.”

Ye Qingtang was rather tempted by Long Yun’s words.

“Under the Dragon Emperor Clan’s hierarchical system, disciples are only below that of the direct bloodline descendants and would have access to endless resources. What do you think, Miss Ye? If you’re unwilling, the Dragon Emperor Clan will not force you,” Long Yun said.

Ye Qingtang was naturally not fooled by Long Yun’s words. What kind of place was this? She was only at the Fifth Heaven level Divine Lord. As an ancient evil faction in the Second Domain, how could the Dragon Emperor Clan take a liking to her?

There was something else that Ye Qingtang believed. A youth who wanted to enter the Dragon Emperor Clan as a disciple must at least be at the sub-Emperor level or possess an extremely rare bloodline.

Ye Qingtang was well aware that the Dragon Emperor Clan wanted her to join for reasons that had absolutely nothing to do with her martial arts talents. Even if she joined the Dragon Emperor Clan as a disciple, those senior disciples were all terrifying and formidable beings.. Ye Qingtang was not confident of surviving among those people.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
