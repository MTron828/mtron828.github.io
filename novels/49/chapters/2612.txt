Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ever since the Feng Yun family patriarch became an Emperor level practitioner, everything had been smooth-sailing for him. He had gone into seclusion all year round in

order to shake off his earthly shackles and make further breakthroughs. In this world, he represented absolute invincibility. No one had ever dared to challenge the

authority of the Feng Yun family. Those who had dared in the past had already been killed by him!

However, today, the Feng Yun family patriarch felt a rare sense of pressure when facing this woman.

After a few breaths, Ye Qingtang grabbed the neck of the Feng Yun family patriarch and lifted him like a newborn chick.

All the while she stared at him with no expression on her face. A cold glint surfaced in her eyes.

“Who... are you!” The Feng Yun family patriarch stared at Ye Qingtang with a frown.

This woman before him was definitely not a nobody.

“You are already about to die. Why are you still asking so many questions?” Ye Qingtang asked calmly.

The Feng Yun family patriarch sneered and said to Ye Qingtang, “Little girl, do you know what kind of power is behind our Feng Yun family? What do you dare to do?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Branch of the Heavenly Demon Tribe... so what?” Ye Qingtang replied without hesitation.

Since she had already offended them, Ye Qingtang was not afraid. Even if she let the Feng Yun family patriarch off now, the Heavenly Demon Tribe Branch would never let

Feng Wuyin off. It was unrealistic to expect them to let her off as well.

All that was left was for her to deal with whatever came her way. Ye Qingtang had nothing to fear now.

“Before that, I’ll let you in on a small secret...” Ye Qingtang stared at the Feng Yun family patriarch. Her lips curled up slightly. An inexplicable expression appeared in her

eyes.

In the next second, under the Feng Yun family patriarch’s incredulous gaze, Ye Qingtang’s body was engulfed by pitch-black flames. An astonishing force instantly

enveloped him.

The Feng Yun family patriarch felt the great power in his body flowing away at a crazy rate. It was as if he had been sucked into a huge and greedy black hole and could not

break free.

“This...!”

Sensing the strange power emanating from Ye Qingtang’s body, the Feng Yun family patriarch was shocked. “Heaven... pure power of the Heavenly Demon... how is it

possible... you are from the Heavenly Demon Tribe?! Wait... this... could it be the Heavenly Demon Devouring Blood...”

However, before the Feng Yun family patriarch could finish his sentence, he had already turned into dust. With a gentle breeze, he dissipated into the wind.

There was no struggle or resistance. It happened within a period that was so short it was unfathomable. Everyone at present was dumbstruck and in disbelief.

The Emperor-level powerhouse from the Feng Yun family was reduced to nothingness in Ye Qingtang’s hands!

“Sister Ye Yue is amazing...”

Feng Wuyin widened his glittery eyes, which were filled with admiration.

“So powerful. Even an Emperor level practitioner was defeated by Sister Ye Yue... How is it that she could be so powerful? Didn’t they say that... the martial arts

practitioner from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain are inferior to us?” Feng Jiuyou was dumbfounded.

Feng Cang and the other Feng family youths looked at each other in dismay. Especially Feng Cang, whose body trembled slightly and his face turned pale.

An existence that could instantly kill an Emperor-level expert...

Would his earlier actions have angered this terrifying woman...

At the thought of this, fear surged from the depths of his heart. Ye Qingtang could kill him with a single thought..
