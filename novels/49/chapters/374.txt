But when Ye Qingtang saw Ni Shang’s current appearance, it was as though a huge rock was pressed on her chest, causing her to be so stifled that breathing was difficult.

The usually petite and pretty girl was laying on bed breathlessly. Her tiny body was covered with bruises, and her clothes were already badly torn. Her fair face was discolored from the bruises, and there was a huge cut on her forehead of which blood flowed along her temples and stained the pillow under her head completely red.

“Ni Shang!” Fei Ying saw Ni Shang’s tragic appearance and broke down on the floor immediately.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes at Ni Shang’s situation, and her breathing deepened.

“Get out.” Ye Qingtang ordered coldly.

Ni Shang sustained too many injuries, and if not treated immediately, she would be completely crippled even if she kept her life.

Looking at Ye Qingtang’s cold side profile, Fei Ying did not dare to hesitate and immediately left the room. He shut the door tight and collapsed against it. He clasped his hands tightly and placed it against his forehead as he prayed repeatedly.

He was too useless and thus caused Ni Shang to suffer such torture.

He must become stronger!

No matter what price he had to pay, he must obtain more power and never ever allow… the people around him to suffer again. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

In the room, Ye Qingtang took out many elixirs from her space ring and swiftly checked Ni Shang’s injuries.

Ni Shang had countless internal and external injuries. Just looking at those hideous wounds, she did not dare to imagine what kind of torture and humiliation she suffered in these three days.

Looking at Ni Shang’s current appearance, Ye Qingtang could not help but recall the young girl’s shy smile when she nervously called her “Miss” on the first day they met.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and forcefully suppressed the murderous intent in her heart.

Song Junqiu, just you wait!

I will definitely return this a hundredfold!!

Ye Qingtang forced herself to calm down and used the spirit energy in her body to heal her injuries. She poured large amounts of elixirs into Ni Shang’s mouth without finding it a shame, all to ensure that Ni Shang kept on to her last breath.

After encountering this incident right after she returned, she was fully occupied from day to late night.

Ni Shang’s condition finally stabilized a little. As her breathing gradually stabilized, her tightly shut eyes opened with difficulty.

When her clear eyes were opened, terror and despair were written in her eyes as she let out a shrill cry.

“Don’t… Don’t touch me!!” Ni Shang crawled up in fear. Trembling, she clutched on the blanket tightly and curled up in the corner of the bed.

Her struggle caused the wound that had yet to heal to rip open once again, and gushes of blood stained the pure white bandage.

“Ni Shang, it’s me. Don’t be afraid.” Upon seeing Ni Shang’s terrified behavior, Ye Qingtang did her best to gently comfort Ni Shang.

Ni Shang could not stop trembling in fear. After seeing that the person before her was Ye Qingtang, it was as though her body broke down entirely as her purpled lips quivered and parted slightly.

“Mi… Miss…” Large teardrops slid out from her eyes silently. Looking at Ye Qingtang who was like the last straw to clutch at, she fell into Ye Qingtang’s arms in despair.

“Miss… You’re back… You’re finally back…” A heart-wrenching voice escaped Ni Shang’s mouth.
