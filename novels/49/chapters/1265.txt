Chapter 1266: Walking on Thin Ice (1)

“Thank you for stopping the Luo Family’s devious scheme today, Holy Lord.” Everyone thanked Ye Qingtang repeatedly.

Ye Qingtang put on a calm and composed front and wore a faint smile; her attitude was like that of a superior person.

“It’s just a small matter.”

A matter where she almost lost her life…

Everyone was overwhelmed with emotion at Ye Qingtang’s composure and only left after thanking her repeatedly.

Ye Qingtang smiled sweetly as she watched the powerful figures leave. She was really about to be drained from exhaustion.

It was truly a frightful night.

If possible, Ye Qingtang would have taken this opportunity to slip off.

However…

The Temple of Shadows Hall Master and others were still standing behind her.

“Holy Lord, do we return to the Temple?” The Hall Master asked.

No!

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang held the tears in her eyes and forced out a happy smile.

Then, Ye Qingtang and the rest returned to the Temple of Shadows immediately.

Soon after they left, many Luo Family members appeared at the peak of a mountain behind the Luo Residence, and their moods were extremely low as they watched the blazing fire not far away.

A tall figure suddenly appeared in the sky and landed before them.

“What happened?” A low shout suddenly escaped from that person’s mouth.

The Luo Family members looked up immediately and saw a handsome middle-aged man standing before them with a frown. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Luo Feng and Luo Qi’s eyes brightened with just one look.

“Third brother?!”

The man who suddenly appeared in the sky was none other than Luo Feng and Luo Qi’s younger brother, the third hand of the Luo Family, Luo Yuan!

“Third brother, you’re finally back… It would have been great… if you came back earlier… today…” Luo Qi’s repressed emotions erupted immediately once he saw Luo Qi.

“What happened exactly? Haven’t you all already made all the preparations for Great Grandfather’s birthday banquet today?” Luo Yuan had an ugly expression and frowned as he looked at the Luo Residence that had been engulfed in flames.

Luo Qi immediately recounted the whole incident to Luo Yuan.

After he listened for a while, a powerful aura rushed into the sky, and the mountain behind him was flattened to a field immediately in just a moment.

Even the ground that the Luo Family members were stepping on began to tremble.

Luo Qi and Luo Feng were slightly startled as they watched the enraged Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan seemed to be even more powerful than before, and his aura was even stronger than Luo Qufeng’s!

Everyone in the Luo Family only knew that the Grand Elder, Luo Qufeng, was very skilled, but people did not know that…

The true talent of the Luo Family was Luo Yuan.

Luo Yuan was extremely gifted since young, and even Luo Qufeng’s endowment was inferior to Luo Yuan’s. Luo Qufeng has always had high expectations for Luo Yuan and trained him attentively. Under Luo Qufeng’s arrangements, Luo Yuan left the Luo Family a long time ago to cultivate, and his skills soared tremendously—not to the disappointment of the Luo Family and Luo Qufeng.

“Holy Lord of Shadows.” Luo Yuan calmed his anger, but his eyes were extremely cold as he watched the blaze before him.

“Big Brother, Second Brother, don’t worry. I, Luo Yuan, will definitely avenge the Luo Family!”

Luo Yuan’s voice was sonorous and forceful. Right when he finished his sentence, he unsheathed his sword abruptly and swept across at the air, causing an enormous wave-like gush of air to extinguish the endless fire that engulfed the already burnt Luo Residence…
