Chapter 2709: Battle For The Heavenly Dao (4)

“Tian?”

The black shadow was surprised to see the man.

“You want to be my successor,” the man called Tian said.

“Heh, Tian, your time is up. I will be your successor. How about that?” The black shadow smiled.

Tian looked at the black shadow. “The three domains of the lower realm are cages. No living being is allowed to step into the upper realm no matter what their cultivation level is. I created the Fourth Domain as the Divine Domain of the lower realm. When warriors from the other three domains manage to reach divinity, they are still unable to ascend to the upper realm, but they can still enter the Fourth Domain. You destroyed my Fourth Domain. In the future, when warriors from the lower three domains reach divinity, where can they go?”

“Haha, I told you that there is no mercy in this world. There is only order in our hearts. I came to the lower realm not because the Fourth Domain was destroyed, but because I am angry… In the future when I become the new Tian, I will create another domain,” said the black shadow.

As the shadow spoke, a red light shot out at an extreme speed and pierced through the center of the shadow’s eyebrows.

The black shadow looked surprised. A large amount of Heavenly Dao quickly dissipated from between his brows.

“Heh… So you want to become the next Tian, there’s no rush… wait for me to return. During this period of time, you can enjoy struggling at death’s door.” A cold laugh rang out in the air again.

No one expected the black shadow, who had been killed just now, to be so terrifying with just the power of his spirit.

“To become the next Tian, one must surpass all things. With your current situation, I’m afraid that won’t do. Coincidentally, my lifespan is coming to an end, so I’ll go to the cursed hell to wait for you both. Let’s see which of you is more suitable for the position of Tian.” Seeing that the black shadow was heavily injured, Tian stated in a cold voice before vanishing.

...

“The Heart of the Heavenly Dao in my body…”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply and looked at the red light that returned.

Could it be that the black shadow who had killed the Silver Star Holy Lord and the High Monk was the true owner of this Heart of the Heavenly Dao?

All along, Ye Qingtang had wanted to know who the owner of this heart was. The truth seemed to be right in front of her now.

That black shadow whose face was a blur… might be the owner of this heart, while she was just its vessel.

What Ye Qingtang could not imagine was that the owner of the heart was already so powerful that he was a candidate to become the next Tian…

However, this candidate was too vicious. If such a person became the next Tian…

After a while, Ye Qingtang touched her glabella.

No wonder she would become the Son of Destiny. That black shadow was equivalent to half a Heavenly Dao. His heart was being nurtured in her body. If she became the Son of Destiny, she would succeed in everything she did. It would also be very beneficial to the nurturing of that heart.

Before Ye Qingtang could ponder any further, everything turned to dust. When Ye Qingtang opened her eyes again, they had already returned to the ancient city.

“Cultivators, welcome back.” The shopkeeper looked at Ye Qingtang and the others. “The number of cursed points gained by each individual will be different according to their performance. Please take a look at it yourselves. The method to check the curse points is very simple. You just need to focus inward.”

With that, Ye Qingtang and the others checked according to the shopkeeper’s instructions.

“Not bad…80 cursed points.” Lan Shan heaved a sigh of relief. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Earlier on, Lan Shan had lost 50 cursed points from killing the shopkeeper. Now, he had 30.

Ye Qingtang held her breath and focused. Her points…

“This…”

Ye Qingtang was surprised. 300,000!
