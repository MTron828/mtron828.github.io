Chapter 10: Transformation (3)

The Second Elder was the most powerful person in the Ye family. The Great Elder would not dare to kill Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang in his presence.

In Ye Qintang’s previous life, the Great Elder killed Ye Ling secretly and framed the Second Elder, effectively eliminating the Second Elder as well. Ye Qingtang then lost two of her greatest supporters in the Ye family. If she had not run away quickly enough, she would have been killed by the Great Elder in Lin Town as well.

All her suffering in her previous life happened after the Great Elder returned. This time, Ye Qingtang would not allow the same thing to happen again.

Whether it was her father or her second uncle, she would protect both of them!

She would return the enmity of her previous life a hundredfold back to the Great Elder.

Ye Qingtang’s heart was heavy up to this point.

“Father, can you ask someone to help me buy some herbs?” Ye Qingtang asked suddenly.

“Of course. What do you need? Just write them down, and I’ll ask someone to go and get them for you.” Hoping that she would not be too depressed from what happened with Duan Tianraok Ye Ling tried to satisfy every need of Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded and then wrote a long list of herbs to Ye Ling.

The first thing Ye Qingtang needed to do was to figure out the identity of the chronic poison in Ye Ling’s body.

Ye Ling’s true strength was equal to, or maybe even greater than, that of the Great Elder. It was the poison that the Great Elder had placed every day that caused Ye Ling’s health to deteriorate and his strength to decrease.

The Great Elder would not have been able to assassinate Ye Ling successfully in the previous life if not because of that.

Her father would regain his original strength only if the remaining poison was cured. If her father’s strength returned, even if the Great Elder wanted to do something, he would not be able to fight her father.

In her previous life, even though Ye Qingtang lost her spirit root, she was not depressed all along. She studied and practiced manufacturing, array formation, elixirs, and everything that could help her become more powerful. She memorized the ancient medicine recipes, and she could make any Spirit Pill if she wanted.

She only needed ten days at most to clear the poison in her father.

Ye Ling asked a servant to buy the herbs and bring them back to the Ye family as soon as possible. Once Ye Qingtang made sure that all herbs were bought, she returned to her room to prepare the antidote immediately.

Ye Ling was worried at first whether Ye Qingtang could recover from the emotional setback that Duan Tianrao had caused. However, Ye Ling felt a bit confused after seeing his daughter lock herself up with the herbs.

Since when was the little girl interested in herbs?

How come he did not realize that?

Ye Ling was very perplexed.

Ye Qingtang, however, had already started with the preparations.

Ye Qingtang was very familiar with herbs, and she was extremely skilled in classifying them accordingly. People who did not know of her talent might have thought that a master physician disguised herself as Ye Qingtang.

When she was almost done, she wiped away the beads of sweat on her forehead. When she raised her eyes, she saw her delicate but flawed reflection in the bronze mirror beside her.

She lifted her hand subconsciously and touched the large red birthmark on her face. A smile appeared on her mouth. She took a few herbs from the stack, mixed them together, and made a bowl of black herbal soup. She frowned after noticing the pungent odor coming from the soup.

Her birthmark had been on her face for very long. In her previous life, she initially thought she was born with the birthmark, but she found out much later that it was caused by a special poison.
