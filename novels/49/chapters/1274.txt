Chapter 1275: Slaves (1)

“Despicable worm, how dare you be rude to us Undead!” The moment Ming Gu saw this scene, a murderous look surfaced on his face.

Lady Ghost, who was standing nearby, maintained her composure, but she glanced at Ye Qingtang from the corner of her eye and spoke.

“Holy Son Ming Gu has not left the Temple of Shadows for thousands of years. It is natural that he doesn’t understand the current situation in Central Mainland. Things like that have long become common in Central Mainland.”

Ming Gu frowned slightly.

Lady Ghost continued. “Ever since the Holy Lord went missing thousands of years ago, the power of our Temple of Shadows has waned. The circumstances of the various Undead Clans in Central Mainland have also changed completely…”

The Undead Clan was not native to Central Mainland. It was only when the Holy Lord of Shadows and the tribe leaders of the Undead Clans had come to Central Mainland that many Undead moved here from the Second Domain and settled down.

When the Temple of Shadows was at the height of its powers, the Undead had smoothly settled into life in this mainland. The natives did not dare to offend the Undead because of the power of the Temple of Shadows. However, when the Holy Lord of Shadows went missing and the Temple of Shadows declined… the situation changed.

Shortly after the Holy Lord of Shadows disappeared, the mainland still had some scruples. But as time went by and a thousand years passed, everyone’s fear of the Holy Lord of Shadows and the Temple of Shadows slowly dissipated.

With that, the Undead Clan’s position became increasingly precarious.

The special characteristics of their race were that they did not need to eat, drink, or sleep. Many thought of them as the cheapest form of labor.

A thousand years ago, people in Central Mainland began to capture the Undead that had settled there. They enslaved the Undead because of their special characteristics, and the latter became the lowest form of labor.

As slaves, the status of the Undead was lower than that of anyone else.

They did not age or die. Unless they met with some accident or with extenuating circumstances, they could be endlessly oppressed.

The mountain that Ye Qingtang and the others were on was a mine. There were innumerable mine shafts, each filled with Undead who worked day and night.

But they… did not receive any remuneration.

They did not even receive the cheapest food and housing that the human slaves did.

They were, at most, allowed to rest for a few minutes when they were utterly exhausted. Otherwise… they worked day and night.

“How dare a smelly worm like you act so audaciously!” Ming Gu’s face grew stern. Ever since the Holy Lord of Shadows had vanished, he had not left the Temple of Shadows at all. Naturally, he remained ignorant of the changes in this mainland that had taken place over the past thousands of years.

In his eyes, humans were weak and ugly like smelly grubs. He would never have imagined that today’s circumstances were possible. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Holy Son Ming Gu, don’t be angry. The situation you see today is common in Central Mainland.” Lady Ghost pacified Ming Gu, but from the corner of her eye, she continued to pay close attention to Ye Qingtang’s every move.

Ye Qingtang’s emotions were in turmoil as she looked at these abused Undead, but she did not show it.

When she had come to Central Mainland in her previous life, she had learned a little of the terrible circumstances of the Undead here.

The Undead neither aged nor died. They did not eat or drink. To many, they were the perfect slaves. A thousand years ago, humans had begun to capture them in large numbers and forced them to work for humans.
