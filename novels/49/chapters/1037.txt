Chapter 1038 It’s You (1)

Everyone was startled and even in disbelief when they saw the giant creature outside Xuanling Sect.

After the Yunxiao Sect Protector Divine Beast was injured by the Blood Moon Holy Lord, it was sent back to Yunxiao Sect to recuperate. Unexpectedly, it was actually this powerful now.

The past YunXiao Sect Protector Divine Beast and the current one were simply worlds apart.

Once spirit animals like these advanced in level, their skills would increase massively.

“The YunXiao Sect Protector Divine Beast… actually advanced in level…” Surprise etched across Elder Mo’s face as he looked at the giant creature shrouding over the entire sect.

Back then, the YunXiao Sect Protector Divine Beast was only an equivalent of a human half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, but after the advancement, its combat power paralleled that of a human Yin Yang Perfected Lord Second Heaven.

Boom!

Deafening rumbles followed with every movement the Sect Protector Divine Beast took.

The already dim red screen above Xuanling Sect became even fainter and was completely broken after a few hits.

The energy of that defense barrier was already mostly exhausted from the start. Now that the advanced Yunxiao Sect Protector Beast arrived and attacked the defense barrier with the combat power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord, it was reasonable that the barrier broke.

Previously, after Yunxiao Sect learned that Ye Qingtang appeared nearby Xuanling Sect, the sect elders immediately rushed over with the Sect Protector Divine Beast, which just advanced not long ago.

However, after arriving at Xuanling Sect, they realized that the Yunxiao Sect disciples guarding in the area were all dead, and Ye Qingtang was nowhere to be found.

Enraged, the Yunxiao Sect elders decided to destroy Xuanling Sect completely first and believed that Ye Qingtang would not be able to continue hiding.

However, just as the defense barrier was broken, a shadow suddenly appeared in the sky at lightning speed. In just a few breaths’ time, it had already reached the YunXiao Sect Protector Divine Beast and blocked it.

The Xuanling Sect members were surprised, especially Elder Mo, who thought that the figure was very familiar after close inspection.

“That is… Junior Sister Ye?!”

Yun Shu looked at the lady in the air who blocked the Yunxiao Sect Protector Beast, and his expression changed immediately.

Hearing Yun Shu, everyone took a closer look at the lady and was startled.

It was indeed as Yun Shu had said. Who else could that lady be if it was not Ye Qingtang?!

“Qingtang…”

Very quickly, Elder Mo stared at the lady in the sky and uttered in surprise. Wasn’t that lady his disciple, Ye Qingtang…

The Xuanling Sect members were all dumbfounded for a moment. Why did Ye Qingtang suddenly appear here…

“Roar!”

The Yunxiao Sect Protector Divine Beast glared at the miniature ant-like human who stood in its way and roared in fury.

“Ye Qingtang!!”

The Yunxiao Sect elders on the back of the Sect Protector Divine Beast stared at Ye Qingtang, and a trace of elation emerged in their eyes. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It seems that the information was true. Ye Qingtang had indeed returned to Xuanling Sect.

Everyone was already aware that Ye Qingtang obtained a Fiendcelestial Beast in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, and her appearance meant that the infant Fiendcelestial Beast was also in the vicinity…

If their Yunxiao Sect could obtain that Fiendcelestial Beast and offer it to the Beiming Manor…

Wouldn’t their Yunxiao Sect…
