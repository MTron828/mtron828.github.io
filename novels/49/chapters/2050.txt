Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo decided to head to the nearest pillar to take a look before proceeding.

As they approached the pillar, they realized... that it was not a pillar at all. It was a huge pagoda.

The pagoda looked extremely strange. It looked like a stone pillar from afar but on closer look, it had a door at the bottom and windows in between the lines etched on it. But the windows were all tightly shut and they couldn’t see into them at all.

There were many guards outside the pillars.

Rather than approach them head-on, she decided to hide in a corner.

“How is it?” she asked Ning Luo.

“I can feel her aura getting stronger as we near the pagodas.”

Was Little You Yun in these pagodas?

There was no way for Ye Qingtang to check but Ning Luo had said that all the pagodas were giving off strong auras. So she brought him to a few other pagodas to check.

Just as expected, Ning Luo sensed the same aura when he approached the pagodas.

This...

She was speechless.

Every pagoda contained Little You Yun’s aura.

How was it possible for her to be spread over so many pagodas?

Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo were both extremely puzzled.

She still had no idea what the pagodas were for, so she headed back to ask You Qiong about it.

But he had no clue either.

He had already left the Ancient You Clan when the underground world was being constructed so he also did not know what the pagodas were for.

But Ning Luo still had a trick up his sleeve. He asked the soldiers around about the pagodas and soon returned with new information.

“They didn’t tell me much about the pagodas but told me not to get too close or the Clan Elders would punish me,” Ning Luo said.

The more Ye Qingtang heard about the pagodas, the more she felt that there was something weird about them. Under the dark cover of night, she snuck out to one of the pillars.

After waiting a long while, she suddenly saw... Elder Yuan bringing a group of youths towards one of the pillars. She was even more stunned as she spotted a petite figure behind him.

“Little Luo Xue...”

The boy’s face was blank and his eyes completely devoid of emotion as he stood behind Elder Yuan.

Elder Yuan opened one of the pagoda entrances and ushered the youths in before closing the door.

After that, he brought another group of them to a different pagoda and guided them in as well. She had no idea what he was doing but little Luo Xue remained at his side the whole time.

He turned to face Little Luo Xue after everyone else was gone.

At that moment, another Ancient You Clan Elder walked over to Elder Yuan and whispered something in Elder Yuan’s ear.

Elder Yuan’s expression turned strange as Little Luo Xue and he said something to him.
