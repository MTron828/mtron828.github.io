Meanwhile, with the permission of Ye Qing, Lei Yan and the rest had already scurried over to the streets of Universe City. Apart from Mu Ziying, who was staying in another dormitory, the entire gang was there, even Jing Ze and Qin Feng had been dragged along.

The bunch of brats lolled around Universe City for the entire morning. Lei Yan bought so many things that his space ring was nearly bursting.

At this moment, Nangong Lie and the others finally realized just how rich Young Master Lei Yan was.

“I didn’t expect the Leiting family to be so rich…” Nangong Lie spoke ruefully as he watched Lei Yan’s spendthrift ways with longing. They were both disciples from major family clans but he had to be so much thriftier.

“What do you know? My father is very generous towards me as compensation. Previously, the elders in my family clan would only scoff at my weak foundation and never allowed me to put even a single foot out the door, unless it was for training. And at the academy, there was no place to spend money. This is all part of my own savings.” Lei Yan was feeling very satisfied with his shopping spree. He had held onto so much money for so long. It was so frustrating to have all that money and nowhere to spend it.

Lei Yan paused. Perhaps he finally noticed the incredulous looks on the faces of his friends. He cleared his throat. “Don’t misunderstand, these items are not just playthings. We are going for that team competition, right? I am just preparing for that. We might have use for these items then.”

Everyone was surprised by Lei Yan’s words.

“Brother, I didn’t know you were so forward-looking!” Hang Wenwei patted Lei Yan on the shoulder.

“Of course, our Boss is leading the team after all. I cannot screw up.” Lei Yan looked very smug.

Nangong Lie threw an arm around his shoulder.

“I say, Brother, we are friends who have been through thick and thin together. Don’t forget to share your goodies with me!”

“Get lost. You don’t want to buy these yourself and am trying to leverage off me? Dream on.” Lei Yan shrugged off his arm in disdain.

“Don’t be like that. I’m broke!”

“None of my business! Get lost!”

The teenagers continued messing around as they returned to the North Hall. Nangong Lie was still trying his best to weasel something out of Lei Yan, but soon enough, a group of people inside the compound attracted their attention.

“What are they doing?” Ran Mo looked at the small crowd of teenagers.

Those teenagers were wearing different uniforms from the various academies but they had all gathered together. A low murmuring could be heard.

It looked rather interesting.

“Let’s go and take a look!” Lei Yan immediately piped up.

They were all energetic youths and at the age where they were filled with curiosity. The teenagers squeezed their way in.

In the middle of the crowd was a massive stone table. A chess board was placed on top of it. Two teenagers from two different academies were playing against each other.

The pieces on the board looked different from the usual chess pieces and were in the shape of various beasts.

“Illusion Beast Chess?” Lei Yan’s eyes lit up.

Illusion Beast Chess was the favorite chess game of the Second Domain. It was rumored that it was derived from Sea Soul Chess. Few people had seen the real Sea Soul Chess but this didn’t stop people from spreading this rumor.

But actually, Illusion Beast Chess and Sea Soul Chess were completely different. There were all sorts of strange strategies and each player had a Beast King. The player who managed to take the other’s Beast King would be the victor.
