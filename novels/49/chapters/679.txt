Chapter 680: Black Market (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“That nagging woman is gone. My eardrums can finally have its peace and quietness.” As the little white tiger watched Ye Qingtang leaving the Ouyang family clan, it was very satisfied with the Blood Moon Elder’s departure.

“…” Ye Qingtang was speechless as she looked at the little white tiger, which was similarly talkative.

After settling the Blood Moon Elder down, Ye Qingtang was not in a hurry to head to Falling Sky Valley. While her original Demonic Blood Sword was pretty good, it was insufficient when compared to her current skills. There was still quite an amount of Millennium Meteoric Iron in her space ring. If she could use these to forge a new sword, she would become even more powerful.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang headed to the underground black market in the monarch city based on what she remembered from her previous life.

That was a land of darkness concealed beneath the glamorous monarch city. In the underground black market, there was nothing that could not be sold. Anyone familiar with the monarch city knew that they had to head to the underground black market if they wished to obtain a truly good thing.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang went to the underground black market with the Eldest Senior Brother of Falling Sky Valley. It was the first time she saw the various transactions hidden in the dark.

However, Ye Qingtang’s real objective of going to the underground black market was not to buy anything.

She wanted to find a person.

A blacksmith who lived in seclusion in the underground black market.

The forging process for the Millennium Meteoric Iron was extremely complicated, and normal forging workshops did not have the conditions to forge it. No matter how skilled Ye Qingtang’s forgery was, if she did not have the tools, she could only look at it. Moreover… the Millennium Meteoric Iron was extremely precious, and Ye Qingtang was unable to find it even in her previous life. Thus, she did not know how to use the Millennium Meteoric Iron.

In her previous life, her Master, Perfected Xuanchen, had always wanted to forge a weapon with the Millennium Meteoric Iron. Thus, he even specially found a blacksmith who had been living in seclusion for a long time. That blacksmith was one of the few blacksmiths in the entire mainland that could forge a sword using Millennium Meteoric Iron.

Ye Qingtang was going to the underground black market to find that blacksmith and ask for his help to forge a new weapon.

The entrance to the underground black market was extremely covert. If not an insider, it was impossible for anyone to find it. Moreover, anyone who entered the underground black market was required to pay the entrance fee regardless of whether they were buying anything inside. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After paying the fee, Ye Qingtang brought the little white tiger into the underground black market.

The sun was ablaze in the monarch city, but in the underground black market, it was rather dim and dusky, with only the flickering flames from the towering torches lighting this land of darkness hidden under the ground.

“This place is so smelly.” The little white tiger wrinkled its nose the moment it entered the underground black market.

Ye Qingtang glimpsed at the little white tiger. In reality, there was no foul smell in this underground black market. Instead, due to the spices sold in the market, there was quite an interesting smell.

“Eh, I don’t wish to stay here for long. It’s too stinky. Hurry up and do what you want to do.” The little white tiger was a little impatient. The smell of those spices did not have any use, and the little white tiger could still smell the stench of decomposed matter concealed beneath the aroma.

“Your nose is really sharper than a dog’s.” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

“Of course. How can a dog’s nose be compared to mine?” The little white tiger lifted its chin.

“…” Did it really think she was complimenting him?

Ye Qingtang did not intend to waste any time and walked towards the place that her Master in her previous life mentioned.

There were messy stalls everywhere in the black market where all sorts of rare treasures were sold.
