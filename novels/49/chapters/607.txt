There was still hope to survive if they gave it a try. If they did not dare to gamble, death would be the only way out.

The Blood Moon Elder stared at Ye Qingtang and said, “Holy Lady, you should go… The talisman should be able to send you out of the Hell of Avicinaraka. Take care…”

Ye Qingtang was silent.

The Blood Moon Elder took a glimpse at Ye Qingtang and immediately withdrew his sight. Disappointment filled his eyes.

At this point in time, he had hoped that the Holy Lady would ask him to leave together.

However, if he put himself in her shoe, he would leave alone as well… The space energy in the Space-transfer talisman was only enough to help one person escape the mystic realm.

The Blood Moon Elder did not have any fantasies towards Ye Qingtang. He turned and joined the rest to attack the door of the palace.

No one wanted to wait for death to come, especially the Blood Moon Elder. If he died again, he did not know how long it would take for him to revive. He did not want to die…

Though the chances of breaking the door were vague, he still needed to try.

However, the Blood Moon Elder felt that his left shoulder was held tightly by a warm hand while he was attacking the door.

The Blood Moon Elder turned instinctively and saw a familiar face.

“Holy Lady?” The Blood Moon Elder was stunned and could not believe who he saw. Ye Qingtang wanted to… leave with him?

“Go.” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

Though the space energy turbulence in the talisman was only enough to send one person out of the Hell of Avicinaraka, Ye Qingtang would not leave the Blood Moon Elder here. She needed to give it a try no matter what.

Ye Qingtang held the weak lady “Ouyang Qian” in front of her, and then the black talisman was ignited.

Swoosh!

As the black talisman was burnt, a strange ripple surrounded Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Like a magic trick, the two of them disappeared from the hall at the next second.

However, the moment before they disappeared, Ye Qingtang noticed that the Yuehua Sect Master who regained his consciousness escaped the palace the moment the Extermination Of Life Formation was turned on. The rest all became a pool of blood in the Extermination Of Life Formation and were absorbed by the ground.

After a long while, Ye Qingtang heard birds tweeting beside her eyes.

She opened her eyes slowly and noticed that she was in a valley together with the Blood Moon Elder.

There were rivers and a stretch of mountains in front of them. It seemed that they were in a heaven-like place.

Many birds were resting on the trees in front of them, and that was where the tweeting came from.

“We’re out…”

Astonishment flashed through Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

The black-robed man did not lie to her. The talisman she obtained from the blood-colored city was indeed a Space-transfer Talisman.

“Who is the black-robed man…” Ye Qingtang frowned and contemplated.

Ye Qingtang had the feeling that she knew the black-robed man. He seemed to be an elder from his voice.

“That’s strange. Holy Lady, why would the black-robed man tell you the information about the Space-transfer talisman? If he did not say that, we would have died in the palace.

Ye Qingtang was confused about the Blood Moon Elder’s question as well.

However, it was very fortunate that they could escape. There was no point in thinking about that anymore.
