“Oh, that’s right. Why are you so weak? I’ll be honest with you. I’ve never seen anyone as weak as you.” The big yellow dog stared at her.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. She was considered weak?

“Even a newborn baby wouldn’t be afraid of monsters formed from grievances, right?” The yellow dog continued.

Ye Qingtang didn’t know how to respond. Was this dog crazy?

A newborn baby wasn’t afraid of above-Emperor level monsters? Was it still in some kind of dreamland?

“Sigh, let’s drop that topic. Let me ask you, how should we get out of this place?” The big yellow dog seemed a little bored when it saw that Ye Qingtang remained silent.

“I know how to get out.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Really?” The big yellow dog wagged its tail. “Bring me out then.”

“It’s not a problem for me to bring you out. However, you have to promise me one thing,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Alright, as long as you can bring me out, I will even learn to bark like a dog.”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. It had already barked when it was facing that above-Emperor level monster earlier on.

“I was separated from my students. Accompany me to find my students first before we leave together. How about that?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Students?” The big yellow dog seemed to be in thought. “Which immortal abode are you teaching at?”

Immortal abode?

What on earth was this dog talking about…

“Forget it. Let’s find your students first,” the big yellow dog said.

“Don’t be so anxious. The Wailing Well is too big, so we have to search carefully,” Ye Qingtang explained. “I don’t know where they are right now.”

The dog said nonchalantly, “It’s no big deal, that’s a piece of cake. I’ll help you find them.”

As it spoke, the big yellow dog walked to Ye Qingtang and more or less rubbed its nose against her. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“What are you doing?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“You were with your students previously, so you definitely have their scent on you. I can make use of the scent to find them,” the big yellow dog explained.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. Although she had lived two lives, this was the first time she knew of such a thing.

“Alright, done,” the big yellow dog said after sniffing Ye Qingtang. “You seem to have interacted with many people previously. Most of them are gathered in one place, but the auras of a few of them have already dissipated,” the yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang’s heart tightened.

“Let’s go. I’ll take you there.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail and walked forward slowly.

“How far away are they?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Not far. Just a few hundred kilometers,” the big yellow dog said.

It was indeed not that far.

However, the Wailing Well was filled with danger and Ye Qingtang and the yellow dog did not travel too hastily. Although Ye Qingtang was much more assured with this big yellow dog, she felt that it was not that trustworthy and could not be relied on entirely.

“Give me something to eat. I’m hungry.” The big yellow dog smiled at Ye Qingtang in the latter half of the day.

“Didn’t you already eat earlier on?”

Despite saying that, Ye Qingtang took out some beef and handed it to the dog.

After the big yellow dog had its fill, it continued on the journey in satisfaction.

…

After an unknown period of time.

“We’re here,” the big yellow dog finally said.

In front of them were several streams. From what they could see, an above-Emperor level monster was wandering around as well.

Ye Qingtang looked at the dog in confusion. “Where are they?”

“How would I know? You also have this beast’s scent on you…” The big yellow dog was a little embarrassed.

Ye Qingtang stared at it.. Wasn’t this the same above-Emperor level monster they had encountered previously?
