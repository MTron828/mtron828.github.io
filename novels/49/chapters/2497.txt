Chapter 2498: Underground Demon God (8)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The next morning.

The demons inside the Deity Ocean space were all shocked. In this space where the Yongle Tribe had almost no presence at all, their legendary Yongle Demon Emperor had appeared once again.

Just the previous day, the Xihai Tribe had started a battle with the Yongle Tribe General. The Xihai Tribe General had surrounded the Yongle Tribe General tribe with his people.

But something unexpected had happened. According to one of their scouts, a single person from the Yongle Tribe had defeated the Xihai Tribe General in one move, making him kneel and beg for mercy.

...

At this moment, above the mountains that the Yongle Tribe occupied, many Great Generals were flying on their demon birds to take a look.

Even though many demons had passed by, they found that the information brought back by their scouts was surprisingly consistent, which was that the Xihai Tribe had indeed been defeated in one move…

According to the scouts, the Xihai Tribe General had even begged the Demon Emperor for mercy.

But without seeing it for themselves, they still had their doubts.

“The Sky Phoenix Tribe General would like to meet the Yongle Tribe Demon Emperor.”

One of the Great Generals spoke up.

After a long while, a demon walked out from the Yongle Tribe and shouted into the sky, “The Demon Emperor has left this space with the other ancestors and we do not know when he will be back. Please return.”

With that, the demon passing on the message glanced briefly at the Great General in the sky and walked back into their abode.

Seeing this, the Great Generals exchanged glances in surprise.

The Yongle Tribe they were seeing now was vastly different from how they were like in the past. All these Great Generals had come to this place but not only had they not seen the Demon Emperor, they had not caught a glance of the Yongle Tribe General as well. Even the small demons were looking down on them…

“From what my scout said, the Yongle Demon Emperor didn’t even make an appearance. Everything was handled by the other ancestors. The Xihai Tribe General was almost killed by one of them.”

“Look at the Yongle Tribe’s attitude towards us now… I don’t think it’s false. My scout would never lie as well.”

...

At this moment, Ye Qingtang had already brought the rest of them back.

“We’re finally back!”

Lei Yan said with a laugh as he looked at the entrance of the Wailing Well.

“What are you this happy about?” Mu Ziying looked at him. They had just escaped a dire situation only to be faced with more danger.

At least they were safe temporarily in the demon’s space, but now that they were back at the Wailing Well, that may not be the case.

“I’d rather be back…”

The Flying Star Academy teacher said with a sigh.

In the demon’s space, he had to pretend to be the Demon Emperor every day. Just one mistake would cause them to be discovered and the demons would flay them alive.

“We were pretty lucky.”

At this moment, Ye Qingtang looked at the Ice Ocean as her lips curled into a smile.

This was the Land of Magic and the exit was below the Ice Ocean.

She quickly spoke up. “This is the exit for the Wailing Well.”

“Huh?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lu Yuanxiang looked at the Ice Ocean a distance away. This was the exit?

“All of you go down first,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Teacher Ye, you’re not joking?” the Flying Star Academy teacher said with a frown.

They could feel the might of the ice from where they were.. They weren’t going to freeze to death after going down but would suffer heavy injuries.
