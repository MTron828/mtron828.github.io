Chapter 781 Birth Mystery (1)

“Young Miss, Clan Master specially sought these spirit pills for you. Please consume it on time.” The housekeeper placed a heap of bottles of elixirs and spirit pills before the Blood Moon Elder.

“I got it.” The Blood Moon Elder leaned against his chair and waved his hand perfunctorily.

“There’s one more thing.”

“Speak,” the Blood Moon Elder said impatiently.

“That Young Sir Ye is looking for you. He is waiting in the hall right now,” the housekeeper said.

The Blood Moon Elder frowned slightly. “What Young Sir Ye? Tell him to go back to wherever he came from. I have no time to meet him.”

The Ouyang family clan was good in all aspects, except for the fact that there was quite a number of Ouyang Qian’s admirers who came to court her favor. Just looking at the faces of those who boasted to be distinguished and talented, the Blood Moon Elder was close to vomiting.

The housekeeper immediately received the orders and was about to leave.

However…

A streak of light shot through his head, and he stood up from the chair at lightning speed.

“Which Young Sir did you say just now?”

“Young Sir Ye. The Young Sir Ye who sent you back,” the housekeeper said innocently. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Blood Moon Elder finally took the situation in and ordered hurriedly, “Go. Quickly invite him here.”

If Holy Lady knew that he almost ordered people to chase her away, wouldn’t he be screwed?

The housekeeper was already accustomed to his Young Miss’s temperament and invited Ye Qingtang in without thinking much about it.

Once the housekeeper left, the Blood Moon Elder hurriedly bowed to Ye Qingtang. “I was unaware of Holy Lady’s arrival. Please pardon me for not receiving you earlier.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the slightly plump Blood Moon Elder and waved a hand. “Alright. I’m here to ask you something. Don’t bother with these.”

Before she headed to the Bliss Forging Workshop, she decided to ask the Blood Moon Elder about the situation over here.

“Noted. Why are you looking for me today, Holy Lady?” The Blood Moon Elder asked with a grin.

“I wanted you to help me find out about the jade pendant the other time. How’s your investigation?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Upon mentioning the jade pendant, the Blood Moon Elder’s expression turned serious.

“Regarding the jade pendant, I’ve already found out some information about it.”

“Tell me about it,” Ye Qingtang said.

“That jade pendant is indeed related to the royal family of the Nine Nights Dynasty. It’s said that over ten years ago, a lady suddenly appeared beside the former Emperor of Nine Nights Dynasty. That lady possessed remarkable abilities and assisted the former Emperor to secure his position as the Emperor in just a few months. That lady wore this jade pendant back then. However, after the former Emperor’s position was stabilized, that lady disappeared suddenly, and there’s no more news of her from then on. Rumors have it that the lady was already pregnant when she appeared.” The Blood Moon Elder explained in full detail.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

“More than ten years ago…”

Calculating the time, the time when that lady was pregnant coincided with the time of her birth.

That jade pendant was subsequently found on her and brought back together with her foster father.

Could that lady be her mother?

Ye Qingtang’s thoughts were complicated.

“Have you found out that lady’s identity? Where is she now?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The Blood Moon Elder replied. “The number of the royal family’s secrets that the Ouyang family clan can access is already considered many, but it details very little about that lady. I only know that the lady was extremely skilled and was at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state. The martial skills that she knew were very odd and completely unlike what ordinary people knew…”
