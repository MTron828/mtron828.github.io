Then, Xiong Feng looked at Ye Qingtang with a bright smile.

Ye Qingtang obviously knew what Xiong Feng was thinking.

Perfected Xuanchen was hesitant as he looked at the bright-eyed youth who had a trace of persistence in his eyes.

“You really wish to be apprenticed to me?” Perfected Xuanchen finally spoke.

Ye Qingtang nodded immediately.

“Yes!”

“Your apprenticeship gift is not small and is indeed what I need. However… even if I’m willing to give you a chance to become my disciple, I’ll still need to see your endowments.” Perfected Xuanchen finally relented, although he did not rashly agree to accept Ye Qingtang.

“Show me your spirit root,” Perfected Xuanchen said.

Although Xiong Feng was materialistic, there was something he said that Perfected Xuanchen thought made sense.

The Millennium Meteoric Iron was extremely rare, and many knew that he was searching for it. Since this young man came prepared, it seemed that he was indeed thoughtful.

To obtain the Millennium Meteoric Iron, he must have made painstaking efforts.

After hearing Perfected Xuanchen’s words, Ye Qingtang immediately opened her hands, where a yellow light bloomed in her palm, and a yellow spirit root appeared silently.

When the yellow spirit root was revealed, Perfected Xuanchen’s brows furrowed slightly, and even Xiong Feng, who had been helping to speak for her, had a stiffened expression.

Yellow spirit root?

Xiong Feng looked at Ye Qingtang in surprise.

He originally thought that Ye Qingtang was from a rather powerful background to directly ask to be apprenticed to Perfected Xuanchen, which suggested to him that his endowments should be relatively good; otherwise, he would not be so bold.

Yet, unexpectedly…

She was actually only a yellow spirit root?!

If it was in ordinary sects, a yellow spirit root was considered pretty good, but in Falling Sky Valley, a force comparable to super sects, it seemed rather shabby.

In Falling Sky Valley, yellow spirit root was the lowest-grade spirit root of ordinary disciples in all the peaks, and one had to possess at least a green spirit root to be apprenticed to a Peak Master.

All the disciples under Perfected Xuanchen had green spirit roots and above.

Xiong Feng’s lips twitched for a moment. He never thought that this ostentatious young man would actually have such mediocre endowments.

Perfected Xuanchen frowned slightly while Yan Shu’s expression turned strange.

He originally thought that this young man’s endowments would be pretty good since he was so stubborn and insistent, but in the end…

Perfected Xuanchen took a deep breath and looked up at Ye Qingtang.

“You can return. I cannot accept you.”

While Millennium Meteoric Iron was hard to obtain, Ye Qingtang’s endowments were insufficient to be apprenticed to him. If he was accepted as an exception, there would be many criticisms. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang kept her spirit root while looking at Perfected Xuanchen. He had just taken on the position as the Valley Master not long ago, and the valley’s internal affairs were rather messy. However, in her past life, Ye Qingtang had met Perfected Xuanchen many years later when he was calm and indifferent and had way fewer areas of consideration.

If Ye Qingtang came to be apprenticed to Perfected Xuanchen a few years later like in her previous life, he probably would not refuse given his future personality.

However…

She did not wish to wait for such a long time.

After hearing Perfected Xuanchen’s rejection, Ye Qingtang was not anxious at all, and a glint flashed across her eyes instead. She looked up and said, “There’s no hurry. I know that my spirit root isn’t good, but my heart is sincere. This Millennium Meteoric Iron is the first apprenticeship gift I prepared. If you accept me, I naturally have a second apprenticeship gift.”
