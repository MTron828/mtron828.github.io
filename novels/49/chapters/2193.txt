Chapter 2194: Incredible (3)

But having personally experienced this, Yun Chen knew very well the effects of this elixir.

“Teacher Ye... You...”

“How about it? Take another pill and then go and try to refine an elixir?” Ye Qing looked at Yun Chen.

In the drop of a hat, Yun Chen’s expression turned from rage to shock. Previously, Yun Chen would never have believed that Ye Qing knew how to cultivate elixirs.

But now...

The effects of this pill... had shattered Yun Chen’s world view on elixirs.

“Teacher Ye... do you... really know how to refine elixirs?” Yun Chen asked.

“If I didn’t, how could I have produced this?” Ye Qingtang was amused.

Yun Chen quietly swallowed. He found all that had happened very hard to digest.

“So... you really refined that cypress elixir?”

Ye Qingtang felt like laughing at Yun Chen’s query.

She didn’t reply immediately but just went to the table and swiftly selected the ingredients for the cypress elixir. She placed them in the tripod and with one hand, ignited a black flame and infused it into the tripod. The cultivation of the herbs progressed rapidly...

All this happened right in front of Yun Chen’s eyes.

Every single one of Ye Qing’s movements was imprinted in his mind. He had repeated this process umpteenth times over the month, but when Ye Qing performed it, everything suddenly appeared exceptionally simple.

After a short period of time, the fragrance of the cypress elixir emanated from the tripod.

Ye Qing took out the cypress elixir and placed it directly in Yun Chen’s hands. Not wanting to waste time, she had made use of her black flame to speed up the refinement of this elixir. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

To have the confidence to do that, Ye Qing must have a certain level of mastery over the refinement of elixirs.

As Yun Chen looked at the cypress elixir in his hands, he saw that it was identical to the one before!

A gasp burst from his lips.

He could hardly believe what he just witnessed.

“Teacher... Teacher Ye... you... you...”

Teacher Ye knew how to cultivate medicine?

Furthermore...

The quality of this elixir was extraordinary!

“Convinced now?” Ye Qing smiled.

Yun Chen nodded in a daze. He was feeling rather surreal. At this moment, Yun Chen remembered all his doubts about Ye Qing, and he felt like slapping himself to death.

He had personally experienced the feeling of failing to recognize a formidable person!

“Teacher Ye, I...”

“Stop standing there in a daze. These suppression elixirs are for you. It’s late now and I am going back to rest. If you still have the energy, practice on your own.” Ye Qingtang stretched her limbs. Today’s suppression elixirs were just a warm-up for her. There were a whole bunch of elixirs she would need to refine tomorrow...

Actually...

No wonder Yun Chen didn’t believe her. Ye Qingtang herself wouldn’t believe in something like a suppression elixir if she hadn’t seen it 300 years into the future.

In addition...

A teacher like her was truly not that convincing.

After Ye Qingtang finished giving her instructions, she turned and left.

Yun Chen stared after Ye Qing’s departing profile in a daze. The elixirs in his hand were still warm and he finally snapped out of his trance. He instinctively clenched his fists, as if he was clutching onto his final piece of hope.

He was wrong about Teacher Ye.

Teacher Ye came to cultivate elixirs purely to resolve his dilemma. To help him find a way to continue refining medicine.

But he...

Yun Chen felt very distressed.

But he also knew that he couldn’t waste Ye Qing’s efforts.

The fire of determination lit up in Yun Chen’s eyes. Without further hesitation, he swallowed one suppression elixir and felt his bloodline subdued. Thereafter, he threw himself into the process of cultivating medicines with a fervor that had been lost for as long as he could remember.
