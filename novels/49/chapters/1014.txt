Chapter 1015 Prosperity (5)

“With us and Eldest Young Lady, we do not have to worry about talented disciples. It will not be that easy even if those talented disciples of super sects wanted to join the Ye Family… However, I think that we should set a family clan assessment. Compared to a super sect’s assessment, the difficulty level should be three to five times greater. This way, the disciples we pick would then be the elite talents,” suggested Daoist Zijin.

After hearing that, the Ye Family elders looked at each other. They had never seen an ordinary sect’s assessment before, much less a super sect’s assessment, and were all the more unable to comprehend the concept of an assessment that was three to five times more difficult than that of a super sect.

“Elder Bai, Elder Zijin, we don’t really understand… such matters… Neither do we really understand what a sect assessment really is. Can we trouble you two to help us with this?” Ye Ling asked with a smile.

Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin nodded. It would naturally be the best if this matter could be handed to them to settle. Otherwise, given the personality and exposure of the rest, the recruited Ye Family disciples would probably not hit the target. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

This was not to say that Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin looked down on Ye Ling and the rest, but such was the fact. The difference between one’s skills determined how much of the world a cultivator had seen. The wider the gap, the greater the difference in exposure. If not for Ye Qingtang, the two Yin Yang Perfected Lords would never have any relations with the Ye Family.

Ye Ling and the other elders were clearly aware of this point as well. To keep up with the footsteps of these two distinguished elders and even Ye Qingtang, the only choice was to become more powerful or interact with powerful figures. As time passed, there would be a substantial change.

“Alright, Clan Master, let Elder Bai Kui and I settle this matter then.” Daoist Zijin nodded in reply.

“Elder Bai, Elder Zijin, before anything, I must make it clear that for the disciples that Ye Family recruits, we can relax on their martial cultivation realm and martial talent, but there must not be any issue with their character,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Rest assured, Eldest Young Lady. We are aware of this.” Bai Kui replied with a smile.

In recruiting disciples, a sect’s greatest priority was the martial talent and skills of the disciples. However, for family clans, one’s moral character was the most important premise.

“Alright. If the two of you need anything, feel free to inform me.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Eldest Young Lady, there is no request for now. If we have any, we will definitely notify you straight.” Daoist Zijin responded with a nod.

In the next few days, apart from setting the assessment venue and conditions, Daoist Zijin and Bai Kui even modestly sought advice from Ye Qingtang. Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin had been stuck in their cultivation realm for over ten years. In this realm, apart from one’s own martial talent, their perception was even more important in order to advance further.

Since Ye Qingtang was a dignified Yang Lord, she must have extremely important experiences to share with them.

Ye Qingtang was not stingy and shared everything she knew, allowing Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin to benefit greatly and be brimming with joy.

Originally, the two of them thought that while Ye Qingtang was a Yang Lord, she probably did not have sufficient experience as she was too young. However, they eventually discovered that Ye Qingtang had an immense wealth of knowledge, and everything she knew amazed them. They did not really understand what she told them initially, but after figuring it out carefully, they gained much understanding.
