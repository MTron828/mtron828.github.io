Chapter 1143: Giving One’s All In Acting (2)

“Can you do it?” Ye Qingtang noticed Blood Moon Elder’s discreet action but did not give anything away from her expression.

“You have a death wish!” Then, the Blood Moon Elder threw a punch towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed slightly after sensing the might from Blood Moon Elder’s fist.

This Blood Moon Elder… was actually for real?!

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang naturally did not dare to fight head-on and leaped away instantly, avoiding Blood Moon Elder’s powerful punch that was sufficient to cause an earthquake.

“B*tch… do you only know how to escape?!”

The Blood Moon Elder shouted coldly when he failed to get her with the first strike.

Ye Qingtang unsheathed her sword and immediately slashed down at the Blood Moon Elder.

Nevertheless, the scarlet sword gleam only left a tiny scratch on the Blood Moon Elder’s body.

“Am I actually so powerful… Too powerful… My unparalleled defense…” The Blood Moon Elder was shocked to see the tiny scratch on his body.

However, this was not the time for him to marvel at his might. He looked at Ye Qingtang and feigned viciousness.

“Lowly ant from this low-level mainland. You’ve angered me!”

Then, the Blood Moon Elder stamped a foot down at Ye Qingtang.

Noticing the situation, Ye Qingtang dashed ahead swiftly.

The Blood Moon Elder immediately chased after her.

At this instant, Blood Moon Elder’s colossal frame rampaged through Wind Cloud City, and many buildings in the city collapsed from the collision as though it was a natural disaster. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Without turning back, Ye Qingtang had fled out of Wind Cloud City in no time.

“Do you only know how to run…”

The Blood Moon Elder pursued her with all his might and shouted thunderously.

Just like that, the two people gradually got far away from the city.

Until sometime later, near a spring at a mountain valley, the Blood Moon Elder shouted. “Holy Lady, stop running…”

Hearing that, Ye Qingtang turned around to see that the Blood Moon Elder was standing beside a spring and had stopped the chase.

“It seems that the You Ancient Clan’s General did not chase over…” The Blood Moon Elder looked behind, and there was no sight of the golden-robed man.

With the two people singing the same tune and with one running and one chasing, they managed to bluff the golden-robed man.

Ye Qingtang also sighed in relief at the situation.

The You Ancient Clan General’s martial skills were too domineering, and given Ye Qingtang’s combat powers at the moment, she was not his opponent at all.

“What to do…”

Worry was etched across Blood Moon Elder’s face. “The You Ancient Clan is too powerful in general. It is simply impossible to stop them with just a few of us…”

To oppose the You Ancient Clan’s main force, this mainland required powerful figures who were around at least Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven and even the Yang Lord realm. Even a Yang Lord did not have much chance at winning against a general of the You Ancient Clan, and this was ignoring the fact that there was still another mysterious commander above the generals.

Ye Qingtang was the only Yang Lord in Falling Sky Valley. If those Yang Lords from Peerless School, Phantom Valley, and Beiming Manor joined forces, there was a possibility that they could contend against the You Ancient Clan’s main force. But despite so, they could only fight against the main force, and there was still no way to deal with the three generals and commander.

“Return to Falling Sky Valley first.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Blood Moon Elder and said.

Blood Moon Elder nodded. They could only return to Falling Sky Valley for now. It was already considered impressive for them to be able to take down two cities by chance on this trip.

However, before they could take any action, Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed abruptly, and he glared at Ye Qingtang furiously. “This ant from a low-level mainland… Let me see where else can you flee to!”
