Chapter 1110 Two Little Monsters (3)

Yet, Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue gave Ye Qingtang a mind-blowing surprise.

Back then, after Ye Qingtang became a Holy Venerate, she had seen plenty of monstrous talents that were extremely gifted. However, compared to these two children before her… they were… “Mo… Mother… Too easy… Want… Want… even more powerful…”

Little Luo Xue walked to Ye Qingtang’s side and hugged her calf while staring at Ye Qingtang eagerly with bright eyes.

Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the young boy. IL11

The corner of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little… This child… was not in the least bit… cute!

Standing aside, Little You Yun looked at Ye Qingtang and Little Luo Xue and smiled dreamily.

This scene was extremely heartwarming. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Mo… Mother… Fa… Father?” Little Luo Xue looked at Ye Qingtang and asked with a baby voice.

None!

“Little Luo Xue, be good. Let’s continue cultivating.” Ye Qingtang saw that Little Luo Xue was becoming increasingly curious and immediately diverted his attention.

After hearing that, Little Luo Xue seemed to move away from the topic of his father and nodded at Ye Qingtang repeatedly.

Ye Qingtang attached high importance to Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun’s martial talent. These two kids had overly scary potential, and according to their potential… if these two kids could grow up healthily… they would become a true… God!

Deeply afraid that something would go wrong, Ye Qingtang even looked for Perfected Xuanchen.

Although Ye Qingtang was a Holy Venerate back then and had a few disciples, she was not well-versed with imparting martial skills and was way lousier compared to Perfected Xuanchen.

“Master, how is Xuanling Sect?”

After calling Perfected Xuanchen to the study room, she first asked this. Perfected Xuanchen replied. “Falling Sky Valley’s disciple, Mo Changkong, is the son of Xuanling Sect’s Elder Mo. As per your intention, Mo Changkong has already brought the Xuanling Sect masses into the valley, and there’s no issue with it.”

Ye Qingtang’s heart was finally at ease upon hearing that “Did you call me here for this?” Perfected Xuanchen asked curiously.

Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang did not explain and merely brought Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue to Perfected Xuanchen’s side for them to display their auras.

At this instant, the two kids were floating in the air and seemed to really enjoy this feeling.“This…”

Perfected Xuanchen was extremely shocked and dumbfounded.

Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue were only born not long ago but had already reached this martial realm?!

Afterward, Perfected Xuanchen learned from Ye Qingtang that these two little kids only used one hour to be skillful at cultivation techniques, and one had advanced to Martial Qi Level Three while the other advanced to half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord…

“Unbelievable… Truly unbelievable!” Perfected Xuanchen was extremely agitated as elation filled his eyes.

Had he not witnessed it for himself, he would not believe it! “Master, although I am a Yang Lord, I am nothing compared to you in regard to imparting knowledge. I hope that you can guide them by their side.” Ye Qingtang looked at Perfected Xuanchen and said.

Perfected Xuanchen flashed a smile and said, “Qingtang, don’t worry. I will definitely do my best.”

With Perfected Xuanchen’s guidance on imparting skills, the two little kids improved at a rapid speed. In just two days, Little You Yun’s martial cultivation had already entered Yin Yang Perfected Lord Fourth Heaven while Little Luo Xue’s martial cultivation had entered the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Second Heaven. It was a miracle.
