Chapter 1141: Shell (3)

In a flash, Han Cangming’s body was penetrated by the blood-colored light beams.

“Han Cangming, don’t let me find your original self… Or else… you’ll be killed,” Blood Moon Holy Lord said.

“You don’t know how to appreciate favors.”

Han Cangming broke free from the metal chains and fought the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

The deafening battle caused the ground to shake and mountains to collapse.

Thud!

Boom!

As a blood-colored shadow collided into a white body, a powerful wind was raked up in the sky.

In the next second, both Blood Moon Holy Lord and Han Cangming crashed down and made an extremely deep dent on the ground.

“Cough…”

Blood Moon Holy Lord had blood on the side of his lips as he slowly stood up from the dent.

Han Cangming was also severely injured.

Their skills could not be used to the best on this mainland and were highly restricted.

“Has the power of karma… also reached its maximum…” Han Cangming mumbled.

A while later, Ling Yan’s soul disappeared from this body.

Han Cangming resumed his past aloofness. Seeing that he was heavily injured, he frowned and immediately bolted away in the horizon without a trace.

Ling Yan slowly opened his cold eyes.

“That’s too risky, Ling Yan.” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan and said.

“It’s fine,” Ling Yan said.

“It’s fine?!” The little azure dragon scoffed coldly. “You use the power of karma to enter your body. Heavenly Emperor must have sensed it now… Alright, of course you aren’t afraid of Heavenly Emperor, but what about the Heavenly Dao? Are you not afraid that the Heavenly Dao will sense it?”

“Heavenly Dao…” Ling Yan looked up at the sky, and his lips curled into an icy smile. “I’m afraid the Heavenly Dao has already become a Demon Dao now. Whether I’m afraid or not, it is something I’ll have to face eventually.”

“Ah…” The little azure dragon sighed. “I hope that the Heavenly Dao does not sense it. Otherwise, all your efforts will be wasted.”

“Oh right, what happened to Heavenly Emperor? Have you defeated him?” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan and asked.

Ling Yan chuckled. “My body is wounded, but he is nowhere better either. He probably will not attack Miss Ye for the time being.”

“What about… your body?” The little azure dragon asked curiously.

“It probably ran away,” Ling Yan said and laughed.

“Ran away?” The little azure dragon was surprised.

“If it’s me, I would instinctively escape first and find a place to recuperate if I see that I am injured. His instincts are mine too; thus, it should have fled.” Ling Yan explained.

In Wind Cloud City.

As Ye Qingtang looked the Blood Moon Elder’s huge, hideous, and horrifying body, she wanted to stay away from him for some reason.

“Holy Lady… can you give me some respect?” Blood Moon Elder put on a long face. “I know that I am a little ugly right now… but you can act a little at the very least…”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared at him blankly.

Was this “a little” ugly? This was simply too hideous to see…

“Is it really that scary?” Blood Moon Elder piled smiles on his face and looked at Ye Qingtang.

“It’s better for you to not smile.” Ye Qingtang shifted her gaze away instinctively as her eyes hurt.

She really wanted to take a mirror and let the Blood Moon Elder see how “unbearable” of a sight his smiling face was.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder stared at her. “…”
