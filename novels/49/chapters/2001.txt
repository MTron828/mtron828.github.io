Chapter 2002: Good Show (3)

Ye Qingtang gave Xue Fu a silent thumbs up from where she was hidden.

Well done!

The more Bai Zhi thought that the Temple of Shadows had nothing to do with this, the more sinister the Ancient You Clan would seem.

The two wardens from the Ancient You Clan looked extremely serious as they looked at Xue Fu and Bai Zhi.

“You say that she’s from the Crimson League, but what proof do you have?” one of the wardens snapped.

The Temple of Shadows was made up of the forces of the Undead Clan after all. Who knew how many alien races there were after all. Did they simply bring one of them here to pass off as a member of a Crimson League, thinking that they would be tricked so easily?

Xue Fu frowned and was about to speak when Bai Zhi finally lost her patience.

Without waiting for the warden to say anything else, she touched the ground lightly with her feet. In an instant, a vine burst forth from beneath her feet and spread out from her like snakes.

The two wardens were covered in vines before they could react. The vines quickly swallowed the guards beside them as well. You Qiong was pulled into the vines as well, which had small thorns on them and quickly pierced the skin of the people within them. But what surprised him even more that the thorns were slowly sucking on their blood.

Within mere moments, the vines turned red after drawing their blood.

The wardens quickly turned white.

How terrifying was her power?

Just a light touch of her foot was enough to cover the earth with so many vines!

“I don’t have the time to speak with you insects. Hand the Netherworld Ring over,” Bai Zhi said with a frown.

The wardens were already screeching in agony as the thorns pierced them, draining them of their life by the second. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Stop.”

A wizened old voice spoke out. Elder Mo suddenly appeared outside the valley with a few young men who suddenly charged at Bai Zhi as they saw the Ancient You Clan people under attack.

“You’re in the way,” Bai Zhi said without moving an inch from where she was. The vines under her feet seemed to come to live and grabbed the people flying to the ground.

In an instant, Elder Mo’s face darkened. These young men had all been reformed by the Spiritual Abode and any one of them could destroy one clan by themselves. Yet all their might today wouldn’t even let them get within 10 meters of this alien race girl.

This was not the kind of power that anyone in the Central Mainland could possess!

“Everyone, stop!” Elder Mo quickly understood the situation. He quickly stopped his attack and called the youths back.

“May I know which sect you are from?” Elder Mo asked Bai Zhi.

“The Ancient You Clan has taken something that belongs to the Crimson League. You are asking me who I am?” Bai Zhi said coldly.

Elder Mo’s heart was beating hard against his chest. He had been doubting the Temple of Shadows’s claims about the Crimson League. But now that he had personally witnessed the might of Bai Zhi, he could confirm this was true.

And the thought made his head want to explode.

How could the Ancient You Clan afford to get on the Crimson League’s bad side? Especially at this time.

Elder Mo quickly said with a smile, “I can see that you are from the Crimson League. Please forgive us for our previous disrespect.”
