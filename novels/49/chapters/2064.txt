Chapter 2065: Possession (3)

The Ancient You Clan was most concerned about Little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode.

So long as the Spiritual Abode remained, the Ancient You Clan could continue strengthening their powers. As for the Spirit of Chaos, they could do without it for now.

A faint smile appeared on Ye Qingtang’s lips.

“Alright. As long as you hand over the remaining Spirit of Chaos fragments to me, I’ll let you off. When I finish rebuilding the Spirit of Chaos, we can exchange the powers for cultivation.”

Grand Elder’s eyes crinkled into a smile. The suggestion she made was satisfactory.

Even if the Temple of Shadows had their hands on the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos, the Crimson League would never sit back and allow that to happen. Grand Elder was merely redirecting trouble to the Temple of Shadows.

The Crimson League’s target would then shift from the Ancient You Clan to the Temple of Shadows.

Grand Elder thought that his plan was secret and foolproof. Unbeknown to him, Ning Luo, who was in a sword form, was watching him negotiate with Ye Qingtang and was simply at a loss for words.

What kind of trauma did the Holy Lord of Shadows cause for him?

Why was he this afraid?

Even if the Grand Elder was badly injured, Ye Qingtang wouldn’t be able to beat him.

However... To think he was fooled by Ye Qingtang.

“I’ll let you know of the whereabouts of the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos as a form of sincerity,” Grand Elder said smilingly.

Ye Qingtang raised her brows while listening to the hiding spot of the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos, but she didn’t make a move.

“I’m the only one who knows about the location. Not a single person from the Ancient You Clan knows about the spot. Holy Lord, you are now the second person to know,” the Grand Elder said.

“I’m supposed to believe you when you just randomly told me this mysterious location? What if you just escape like that?” Ye Qingtang continued.

“What do you mean?”

“I want the boy behind you.” Ye Qingtang raised her hand, pointing at Little Luo Xue, who was on the altar.

“You seem invested in his body. I have no interest in him. I will need to make sure the fragments are at the location, then I’ll let him go.”

Grand Elder’s eyes narrowed and after some thinking, he nodded. He took Little You Yun to a side and Ye Qingtang put down the Ice Frost Divine Sword before lifting Little Luo Xue up.

Given that the Holy Lord of Shadows was powerful enough and had no use of Little Luo Xue’s body so Grand Elder wasn’t worried.

As Ye Qingtang looked at Little Luo Xue, who had a blank expression while in her arms, she secretly heaved a sigh of relief.

Fortunately, she managed to save one of the two.

As for Little You Yun...

Ye Qingtang looked at Grand Elder.

He should be prepared for his death.

Ye Qingtang wasted no time and took You Qiong with her to the location that Grand Elder had told them about.

Grand Elder’s revealed a grim expression only after Ye Qingtang left.

There wasn’t any problem with the location he had named. However, he wasn’t that foolish to just wait for her without doing anything.

Even without Little Luo Xue, as long as he had the Spiritual Abode, he could continue cultivating more outstanding vessels.

Grand Elder prepared to take Little You Yun with him to leave via the secret passage. But he had completely neglected the Ice Frost Divine Sword that had been left behind by Ye Qingtang.

When Grand Elder took Little You Yun with him and prepared to leave, the Ice Frost Divine Sword suddenly had an outburst of light.

The Grand Elder had sustained injuries and since the Ice Frost Divine Sword had a similar breath as Little You Yun, he didn’t notice a thing.

Only for an instant!

The Ice Frost Divine Sword went through the Grand Elder’s chest from his back. The Grand Elder’s eyes widened as he looked at the sword that was peeking out of his chest. Shock finally registered across his features.

How had he fallen so easily into this trap?
