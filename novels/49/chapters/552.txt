Chapter 553 Replenish for Prosperity (2)

“However, the token will not be able to prove your identity as the Holy Lady after the power is used. Only our division will know… If you want to command the other division with this token, they may not trust you.” The elder explained his RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

concern.

Her identity as the Blood Moon Holy Lady was only known by this division. Other divisions were not clear about that.

“That doesn’t matter. Without the identity as the Holy Lady, I can disguise as the guardian or the elder as well…” Ye Qingtang waved her hand.

The lips of the Blood Moon Division Head Jiang Chen and the Blood Demon shivered slightly as they heard what Ye Qingtang said.

She was the superior Holy Lady of the Blood Moon Sect, and she had to lower herself to disguise as the guardian and the elder…

“Since the Holy Lady approves, I shall obey your command.”

The elder lowered his head and created some kind of markings with his palms to force out the Holy Lord’s divine power in the token.

Swoosh!

A ray of blood red luster came out of the token and surrounded the entire Xuanling Sect instantly.

“People of Xuanling Sect, this barrier can only be broken by the Ultimate Elder and the Blood Moon Holy Lord. However, the divine power inside can only last for half a year. You should never leave the barrier. Once any of you leaves, it’s impossible to return,” the elder said.

“Thank you so much.” Elder Mo greeted with cupped fists.

“Xuanling Sect will never forget the favor from the Blood Moon Sect!” Elder Qin also said.

“Thank you for giving us half a year to replenish!” The Xuanling Sect Master’s eyes were filled with joy. The resources in the sect were enough for all the disciples for half a year.

Those injured disciples had hope now…

“I shall leave with Junior Brother Mo then,” Ji Yixuan said towards the Grand Elder.

“Okay.” The Grand Elder nodded.

Ji Yixuan and Mo Changkong were disciples of the Falling Sky Valley in the Nine Nights Dynasty. Apparently, they could not stay in the Xuanling Sect. Furthermore, the Falling Sky Valley was not in good terms with the super sects of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. It would be too late for them to leave once the super sects arrived.

“Holy Lady…”

“Holy Lady, I owe you two favors now, and I will never forget them. If there is anything I can help with in future, please ask. I will do anything for you.” Ji Yixuan flew towards Ye Qingtang and said with cupped fists.

“It’s alright…” Ye Qingtang said.

She heard more than once from Master in her previous life that Ji Yixuan was boring but honest and frank. He would never forget any favor—nor any grudges.

“Junior Sister Holy Lady…” Mo Changkong looked at Ye Qingtang with a complex expression.

From the letters between him and his father Elder Mo, he knew about Ye Qingtang long ago. Elder Mo’s letter was full of pride and fondness towards Ye Qingtang.

However, he did not expect that… Ye Qingtang would be the Holy Lady of the Blood Moon Sect.

He did not know whether Ye Qingtang, as the Blood Moon Holy Lady, would admit him as her Senior Brother as they had never met before.

“Senior Brother Mo, we’ll see each other again.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

The complex expression on Mo Changkong’s face was replaced with joy upon hearing Ye Qingtang addressing him as Senior Brother.

“Hahaha, alright. I have never imagined that I would be the Senior Brother of the Blood Moon Holy Lady. It seems like I will have some connections with the Blood Moon Sect as well in the future.”
