“How dare you to play with our destiny!” Some super sect figures shouted in rage towards the sky.

However, there was no reply from the black-robed man.

Ye Qingtang pondered at the top of the cliff.

The black-robed man’s intentions were very clear. He wanted everyone to enter the land of inheritance and kill each other.

However, whether there was the blood incantation array formation that the black-robed man mentioned was still unknown. Maybe it was just to scare people.

“Holy Lady… I can sense that… there is really the blood incantation array formation under the ground!”

“Human’s blood incantation array formation… It can only be refined by an array master. It is full of hatred energy from the blood incantation. Once it is turned on, everyone in the land of inheritance will die.” It was rare that the white tiger analyzed the situation seriously.

“F*ck… Blood incantation array formation?! No no no, I’m still young. I don’t want to die!” At the end of its analysis, its face suddenly changed.

Ye Qingtang looked upwards and pondered.

“The black-robed man should be on the third level,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Holy Lady, how do you know that?” The Blood Moon Elder was confused.

“It’s easy. The land of inheritance here is separated from the outside world and forms its own world. Voices from outside cannot travel here. Thus, the black-robed man must be inside the land of inheritance. The first level has been occupied by the unknown ferocious creatures now, and the third level has weird energy turbulence… If I were the black-robed man, as an audience, I will definitely watch the show from the third level and wait for the blood of the cultivators to nurture the thing in the third level.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the Blood Moon Elder held his fists together and said, “That’s brilliant, Holy Lady. Actually… that’s what I thought as well.”

Ye Qingtang looked towards the bottom of the cliff. Many people from the super sects did not seem to treat the black-robed man’s words seriously. It seemed that they did not believe that there would be the blood incantation array formation under the land of inheritance.

Five days. We do not have much time left. I need to find a way to enter the third level.?Ye Qingtang considered internally.

Ye Qingtang was not sure of the black-robed man’s ability, but she had some predictions.

If the black-robed man was strong enough, why would he plan such a conspiracy? He could just kill everyone here to save the hassle.

Before they entered the mysterious palace, the aura that the black-robed man showed should be at the early-stage of Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Based on her Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three cultivation, it would be nearly impossible to win. Even if she used all her strength, she could not defeat a person at the early-stage of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

However, if she could suppress the black-robed man, all the dangers would disappear.

Ye Qingtang was not in a hurry even though there were only five days left. Her intention of entering the land of inheritance was to acquire the inheritance of Martial Qi to increase her abilities. If she could encounter some destinies, she would be able to break through the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three within a short period of time. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Roar!

A horrifying roar suddenly came from a nearby place.

There were seven to eight young people fleeing towards the cliff in shock.

From their clothes, the young people were not from the Formidable Heavens Dynasty but the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Ye Qingtang scanned through her surroundings. The cliff was surrounded by those flying giant ants, and there were ten more giant mice running towards her direction.
