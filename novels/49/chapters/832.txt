Chapter 833 Guarded By Disciples

While it was so, Ye Qingtang still had her worries. From what she saw, the people who broke through the Dimension Wall were all extremely powerful figures of the Central Mainland.

Some superhuman talents had already reached the Arcane Supremacy realm and owned the body of a Supremacy of whose skills were overly terrifying. In the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm, regardless of whether one was a Yin Lord or Yang Lord, it was no different from an ant in the eyes of an Arcane Supremacy.

Once they found the Dragon Vein, it would be extremely difficult for her to contend for anything.

A long while later, Ye Qingtang’s tightly-frowned brows finally relaxed a little as she looked into the sky.

The good thing was that the amount of spirit energy on this mainland could not be compared to that of the surrounding mainlands. Even if an Arcane Supremacy entered this mainland, his martial skills would be forcefully suppressed to at most a Yin Yang Perfected Lord. The shorter the duration they entered this mainland, the greater the drop in their martial cultivation realm unless they had a special elixir which could increase their realm once again.

“Yin Yang Boy is already here. I’m afraid Black and White Holy Son would also come to this mainland to search for the Dragon Vein.” Ye Qingtang muttered.

“Brother Ye Chen, let’s head to the Dragon Vein quickly. There is not much time given to us.” Master Du told Ye Qingtang a while later.

Ye Qingtang nodded and sat on the silver wolf’s back.

In the blink of an eye, Master Du and Ye Qingtang vanished from that valley without a trace.

According to Master Du, there were several entrances to the Dragon Vein. The main route was monopolized by the three great forces, and the two of them were naturally unable to use the main route.

Dozens of years ago, Master Du once found another passageway which led into the Dragon Vein. However, that passageway was blocked by a Diamond Boulder which, in order to enter the Dragon Vein, had to be destroyed using the power of the Extraordinary Flame.

Two days later, Ye Qingtang and Master Du finally arrived at a desert.

In the middle of the desert, Master Du told Ye Qingtang to stop.

“There is an underground lair 1000 meters ahead of here. That is the entrance of the Dragon Vein.” Master Du told Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded after listening to Master Du’s words, and both of them headed forward.

After walking only a few hundreds of meters, Master Du was surprised to see that there were a few young men guarding above the underground lair.

“Peerless School?” Ye Qingtang said softly after scanning those young men.

“Brother Ye Chen, I’m afraid the three forces have found this entrance to the Dragon Vein as well.” Master Du sighed.

From what Ye Qingtang saw, those people were all wearing the Peerless School’s outer sect disciples uniform, and there was not one from the Beiming Manor and Phantom Valley.

“Master Du, there are only Peerless School disciples here. It should be that only the Peerless School have found it,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Even if it’s the Peerless School, it’s inconvenient for us to continue going further. I’m afraid that the treasures inside are already all taken away by them.” Master Du lamented.

However, Ye Qingtang shook her head upon hearing that. “It shouldn’t be.”

“Brother Ye Chen, why do you think so?” Master Du wore a perplexed expression.

“This route to the Dragon Vein is guarded by only three Peerless School outer sect disciples, which is simply illogical. If they really destroyed the Diamond Boulder, there should be at least warden-level figure from the Peerless School guarding this place. How can it be three ordinary outer sect disciples?” Ye Qingtang explained.
