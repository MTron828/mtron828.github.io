Chapter 943 We Meet Again (1)

“In that case… want to let me try devouring you?” Ye Qingtang looked at little white tiger meaningfully.

“It’s just like you to bully me… we’re allies, why would you devour me…” The little white tiger repeatedly shook its head.

The little white tiger immediately leaped from Ye Qingtang’s arms to the ground. It picked up a stone in its mouth and threw it at Ye Qingtang’s feet. “Go on, try to devour it!”

“You want me to… devour a stone?” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched.

“That’s right. Try it.” The little white tiger nodded.

Ye Qingtang had no choice but to use her Devouring power. A black glow shrouded the stone.

The next instant, there was a cracking noise, and the stone exploded into fine powder, then transforming into nothing.

However, Ye Qingtang was surprised to discover that the stone actually contained a trace of spirit energy, which she digested.

“What the f*ck! It’s so twisted!” The little white tiger was rendered speechless. “Not only can he Devouring Bloodline devour bloodlines, but it can also devour all the energy in this world. Even spirit roots… can be easily devoured. However, with your present ability and cultivation level, you’ve done well to devour a stone. If you want to devour the power of a human’s bloodline and cultivation, you will need to cultivate for a few more years…” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Of course, Ye Qingtang understood what the little white tiger was saying. It was not true that just anyone who obtained a powerful bloodline could immediately use it perfectly.

Like the girl in green, with her inscrutable martial talent and cultivation. Even if the true god was reborn, she could at most devour the power of a bloodline but would be unable to devour the power of cultivation.

Furthermore, Ye Qingtang was currently only a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven. She was doing pretty well to be able to devour some plants, but she was unable to devour the power of another person’s bloodline.

Of course, Ye Qingtang was not interested in devouring other people’s bloodlines. Ye Qingtang would never actively seize someone else’s bloodline or cultivation, as it was contrary to her principles. But if anyone tried to kill her, Ye Qingtang would naturally not be bothered with morals or principles.

In summary, if others did not threaten her, Ye Qingtang would not actively seize other people’s bloodline or cultivation. But if someone insisted on opposing her or tried to kill her, then Ye Qingtang’s Devouring Bloodline would teach him a lesson.

Before Ye Qingtang had time to think further, a slender figure slowly approached.

“Miss Ye, do you like my present?” A laughing voice rang out.

When she heard the voice, Ye Qingtang turned around and saw…

A handsome, smiling man. His hair waved in the wind. He looked radiant and extraordinarily elegant.

“Ling Yan…”

Ye Qingtang frowned. Wasn’t that Ling Yan?

“Why do you enjoy involving me in your schemes?”

Ling Yan laughed softly when he heard Ye Qingtang’s words. “What does Miss Ye mean? I have never done anything to Miss Ye’s disadvantage.”

“Of course I know that…” Ye Qingtang said. “I meant that you should discuss your schemes with me beforehand. I am always the last to know about them.”

Ye Qingtang was already considered intelligent, but she found it difficult to cross swords with Ling Yan, who had near demonic intelligence.

Heaven knows how this fellow had gotten a brain like that.

It was as if he held heaven and earth in the palm of his hand.

“Miss Ye, if I told you earlier, I’m afraid it would cause some changes… but of course, if Miss Ye doesn’t like it, I will discuss them with you next time.” Ling Yan smiled good-naturedly.
