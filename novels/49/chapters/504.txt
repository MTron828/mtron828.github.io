Chapter 505 On Oneself (2)

As a Yunxiao Sect Elder, he was extremely respected.

In this mountain today, a Xuanling Sect disciple actually slaughtered his disciple right before him. More than that, she spoke harshly about how she would annihilate Yunxiao Sect in the future and even used Yunxiao Sect Sect Master’s Array Formation to repress him!

It had been tens of years since the Yunxiao Sect Elder experienced such humiliation!

At that moment, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Sect Elder had already fled from the area near the mountain.

“Ye Qingtang, I was thinking about why you were so bold. So you already had preparations from the start!” The Blood Moon Sect Elder looked at Ye Qingtang with fear still lingering in his heart.

If Ye Qingtang did not have the Array Formations in talismans, both of them would have died without a doubt!

“If 1 didn’t have this life-saving item, how would I dare to provoke the Yunxiao Sect Elder like that?” Ye Qingtang shot the Blood Moon Elder a look. He had been following beside her for so long, yet why was he still so stupid? How exactly did he become a Blood Moon Elder a thousand years ago?

“Haha. Ye Qingtang, I finally realized that you have a deep hatred towards Xuanling Sect.” The Blood Moon Elder smiled as he looked at Ye Qingtang. “You killed the disciples of Yunxiao Sect’s Sect Master and Elder, used the Array Formations to repress the Yunxiao Sect Elder, and even reported your background. This way, Xuanling Sect will definitely have to bear with Yunxiao Sect’s rage.”

Ye Qingtang snickered coldly. “Even if I don’t do this, do you think that Yunxiao Sect would not annihilate Xuanling Sect?” The Blood Moon Elder shook his head. “What you said makes sense as well. Yunxiao Sect knows that Xuanling Sect discovered their secret and definitely would not let anyone live… I’m only curious as to why you would take such a risk to provoke Yunxiao Sect and even reveal the secret that you killed the Sect Master’s disciple without hesitation.”

What was more outrageous was that Ye Qingtang even used the Concealed Breath Spell to kill Li Jiwu in front of the Yunxiao Sect Elder…

Then, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered. “If you are a senior executive in Yunxiao Sect and hate me to the bone yet can’t find me in Xuanling Sect, what would you do?”

“Me?” The Blood Moon Elder thought for a while and replied slowly. “If I hate you to the bone, I would want to kill you immediately and would not be in a rush to wipe out Xuanling Sect. | would keep them in captive first to force you to show up. With the lives of everyone in Xuanling Sect in my hands, would J still be afraid that you won’t come to rescue them?” “You’re finally smart this time.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

The Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed as he looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

She was only fifteen or sixteen… How was she this shrewd and able to devise such a scheme?!

Thinking about it carefully, Ye Qingtang did not want to accelerate the annihilation of Xuanling Sect. Doing this… was to save Xuanling Sect!

“Ye Qingtang, didn’t you plan to pretend as a Blood Moon Guardian and use the Blood Moon Sect’s powers to fight off Yunxiao Sect? If that is the case, why do you still need to take a risk to provoke Yunxiao Sect?” the Blood Moon Elder asked. “To be fully prepared.” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were cold as she continued. “If I didn’t do this, Xuanling Sect would definitely be annihilated once this plan fails. However, if I acted as I did today, even if the plan fails, at least Xuanling Sect still has a way out, and there’s hope for survival.” Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It was imperative for Yunxiao Sect to annihilate Xuanling Sect. As long as she was able to fight for a chance of survival for Xuanling Sect, she would even attract all of Yunxiao Sect’s resentment on herself.

The Blood Moon Elder faced Ye Qingtang squarely for the first time.

In order to protect Xuanling Sect, Ye Qingtang actually wanted to carry all of Yunxiao Sect’s hatred by herself…

Since the first time he met this girl before him, he already knew that she was not simple. Yet, he had never expected that she could go to this extent, which was truly unimaginable.
