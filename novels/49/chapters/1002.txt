Chapter 1003 The Arrival of A Powerful Figure (3)

The senior members of the Ye family also could not bear with her attitude anymore and started to blame her in anger.

Even the disciples of the Ye family also began to curse her.

“Young lady, you’re way too arrogant. It seems like your parents did not teach you about manners.” The previous Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder shouted coldly in mid-air.

Ye Qingtang sneered after hearing the Grand Elder’s words.

“You’re disrespecting me by talking to me in mid-air. Get down right now!”

“What did you say?! Ye Qingtang, how dare you to speak to my Grand Master like that?!” Long Rui’s eyes darkened immediately like a pool of water.

However, Ye Qingtang did not seem to hear Long Rui’s words at all and did not give any response.

“Then I shall help you to get down.”

Ye Qingtang sneered coldly as the previous Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder had no reaction. She raised her right arm under everyone’s gaze, and the Grand Elder was dragged down by a mysterious force!

The scene was like a dream to everyone who was present as it was so unreal.

“This…”

The Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder was shocked as he landed. His body was out of his control just now and was dragged down by a force that could not be described…

“Was it… the Fiendcelestial Beast…”

The previous Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder stared at Ye Qingtang and contemplated.

A warm luster appeared in the Elder’s eyes soon. It was shocking that a young Fiendcelestial Beast could possess such terrifying power. If he could get the Fiendcelestial Beast…

The Elder was more determined to get the Fiendcelestial Beast.

“Young lady, I’ll give you one last chance to hand over the Fiendcelestial Beast and the black-grade weapon now… If not, you will not even be able to die in peace!”

Ye Qingtang was expressionless after hearing the Elder’s words.

“Young lady, it seems like… you really don’t value your own life.” The previous Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and sneered.

“I won’t kill you before I get the Fiendcelestial Beast… However, I shall kill everyone in the Ye family.” The Grand Elder then exchanged a glance with Long Rui and the Long Family Master.

The Long Family Master immediately understood the command from the Grand Elder and looked towards the Ye Ling and the rest

“You’re really a group of clowns.” Ye Qingtang sighed softly.

Ye Qingtang did not have the intention to fight against these people previously. However, she understood that no matter what she said, everyone would think that she was using the Fiendcelestial Beast’s power to threaten them.

Ye Qingtang would not mind to let everyone feel the power of a Yang Lord.

As Ye Qingtang finished her words, the immense power of a Seventh Heaven of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord exploded out from her body. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Wing howled, and invisible waves of air spread out in all directions like the waves from the center of the sea.

As the aura of the Ying Yang Seventh Heaven spread out, the immense power rushed into the sky, and the sky seemed to be trembling under the influence.

Invisible waves of air surrounded Ye Qingtang and spread out in all directions.

Everyone stepped backward under the force of the aura before they could comprehend the situation. They were terrified by the scene and trembled in fear.
