Chapter 1175: Heaven City (3)

There was a crowd at the foot of the city walls. Many You Ancient Clan war flags waved in a clamorous fashion.

Gu Yu and the other powerful figures in Heaven City frowned at the sight.

The incomers were the You Ancient Clan forces, and there was a continuous influx of powerful figures from the camp afar.

With a command from Gu Yu, thousands of archers rushed to all sides of the city walls and aimed their arrows at the You Ancient Clan masses beneath.

Although Heaven City lost several times and sustained heavy injuries, it enjoyed a natural advantage: the ancient array formation in the ground prevented others from flying, and the city walls were reinforced through a unique technique, which made the city impregnable. Even though there were many powerful figures from the You Ancient Clan, they had to pay a price if they wished to forcefully invade the city. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As such, the You Ancient Clan did not choose that option and instead surrounded Heaven City. Even if Heaven City did not accept the war, it was still a slow death.

“The You Ancient Clan is going too far…”

Some Heaven City figures shouted furiously.

“Don’t act rashly,” Gu Yu looked at them and said.

“But it is not a solution to go on like this. By then, Heaven City will also be defeated…” A heavily-injured elderly sighed.

“If the headquarters could send more powerful figures over, we would not be so passive. The headquarters should know about Heaven City’s situation. Do they not care about our lives?!”

“Ah…”

“We are not abandoned, are we…”

Many powerful figures in Heaven City commented successively.

“Where is the main city this troop is based on?” Ye Qingtang asked out of a sudden.

“It’s the Dragon Elephant City three hundred miles away.” Gu Yu replied.

Ye Qingtang nodded lightly.

To completely resolve Heaven City’s crisis, the only way was to do something in Dragon Elephant City.

“Heaven City people, are you all still not going to accept the battle today?”

At this instant, an elderly slowly walked out of a gold carriage among the You Ancient Clan masses. His cold gaze landed on the top of the city walls as he asked.

Nonetheless, there was no reply.

“Miss Ye, you just reached Heaven City and are probably not familiar with this You Ancient Clan troop. That elderly who walked down from the gold carriage is Dragon Elephant City’s commander,” Gu Yu looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

Ye Qingtang nodded. The elderly’s skills were exceptional, and he should be a senior executive of the You Ancient Clan.

“What is the purpose of guarding Heaven City? When the resources are depleted and we invade the city, you all will just be meat on a chopping board for us to butcher.” The You Ancient Clan elderly chuckled.

Everyone in Heaven City knew this logic without his reminder, but if they left the city to fight…

“If we fight, we will die. If we don’t fight, we will also die. Why not just fight it out with them!”

A wounded Yang Lord elderly shouted coldly as his eyes glistened.

“Out of the ten insane talents of the You Ancient Clan, three of them are here. Even Mo Feng was killed by them… Once we leave the city to accept the battle, the consequences will be unbearable,” Gu Yu said with a frown.

“Commander, you’re in charge of Heaven City. What do you think we should do?” One of the powerful figures looked at Gu Yu and asked.

“The geography of this place is to our advantage. There’s no need to risk our lives to fight it out with the You Ancient Clan. Let’s wait awhile more. The headquarters will definitely deploy powerful figures here…” Gu Yu said.

“How long more must we wait… There are millions of people in Heaven City and millions of mouths to feed. The stored rations are simply insufficient to last them a few days… With the You Ancient Clan guarding this place, the rations team cannot enter. Even if there are powerful figures who can avoid the You Ancient Clan’s spies, how many supplies can they bring with just a space ring? How would it be enough for millions of people?”
