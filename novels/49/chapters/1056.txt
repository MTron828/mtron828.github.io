Chapter 1057 Three Orders To Kill (3)

If the previous Grand Elder and Master of the Yunxiao Sect had remained in the sect and resisted to the end, with their rich legacy, even Ye Qingtang would take some time to completely eradicate the Yunxiao Sect. She certainly would not have been able to uproot it so easily.

“Eldest Young Lady, I must say that the Yunxiao Sect legacy is pretty good. Hahaha… they’ve put so much effort into managing it for hundreds of years, only for it to fall to our Ye Family!” Elder Bai Kui laughed loudly.

Ye Qingtang did not have much to say about that. A fight between two major forces was always like that. Once a battle began, the loser would always become fodder for the victor.

Ye Qingtang quickly followed the Ye Family Branch Masters and arrived in the area where the Yunxiao Sect reared its spirit animals.

Dozens of spirit animals were separately reared in their individual areas. Their environment was almost like a paradise, extremely beautiful. Besides the rarer flying spirit animals, there were also fighting spirit animals and mounts. The Yunxiao Sect even reared many young demonic beasts.

A super sect almost always gained its status from the efforts of its forebears. The rich legacy the sect had built up for hundreds of years was hard to imagine. Today, an ordinary sect would be hard-pressed to even provide fodder for these spirit animals and demonic beasts. However, to a super sect, it was nothing out of the ordinary and was not a burden.

Ye Qingtang and the others very quickly came to the Martial Skills Area. The Yunxiao Sect’s Martial Skills Area was not bad, but it was inferior to the one that Ye Qingtang had previously established in the Ye House.

Not long after, Elder Bai Kui, Daoist Zijin, Ye Qingtang, and the others came upon the Treasure Pavilion.

“Greetings, Yang Lord!”

A white-haired old man looked at Ye Qingtang, his face filled with respect. He kneeled and greeted them.

This man was the guardian of the Yunxiao Sect’s Treasure Pavilion and was very familiar with the treasures there. He sincerely begged Elder Bai Kui and the others to allow him to remain, and he expressed his hope of serving the Ye Family.

Elder Bai Kui allowed the old man to remain after receiving Ye Qingtang’s approval.

The old man was not part of the Yunxiao Sect’s fighting force. His martial skills were ordinary, and he was only a part of the support personnel. The Ye Family had retained many support personnel like him instead of expelling them from the sect.

“No need to be so formal,” said Ye Qingtang to the old man.

The old man quickly stood up, looked at Ye Qingtang, and smiled. “Yang Lord, please come this way.”

Ye Qingtang followed the old man into the Treasure Pavilion. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The Treasure Pavilion in the Yunxiao Sect was divided into several large areas: the Spirit Weapons Area, the Dharma Treasures Area, the Talisman Area, the Traps Area, the Elixirs Area, and so on.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang and the others entered the Spirit Weapons Area. In the center of it were rows of spirit weapons, and every one of them was of fairly high level.

“Yang Lord, this Cold Earth Sword is a medial black-grade spirit weapon. It belonged to the ancient Zhou Kingdom’s third emperor three hundred years ago.”

The old man explained to Ye Qingtang and the others.

Ye Qingtang nodded when she heard that.

The old man knew every Dharma treasure like the back of his hand.

They learned from the old man that the Yunxiao Sect’s Treasure Pavilion was not open to ordinary disciples of the sect but only to those of warden level or above, who had made a major contribution to the sect.

“In the future, the Treasure Pavilion will be open to everyone in the Ye Family,” Ye Qingtang said to Elder Bai Kui and the others.

When they heard that, Bai Kui and the Daoist Zijin nodded repeatedly.
