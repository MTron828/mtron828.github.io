Chapter 2097: The Disintegrating Seal (1)

“It’s no trouble at all. We just don’t want any harm to come to you,” Elder Hua said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang looked at her suspiciously.

Seeing that she was listening, Elder Hua continued, “Since you’re from the First Domain, you’re probably unfamiliar with the Second Domain. The mainland that the Temple of Paragon is on is surrounded by an ocean of waste. There are many void storms in the ocean, and you have to pass through all of these before you can leave.”

“Is that true?” She looked at Elder Hua, not fully trusting her ‘words of caution’.

Elder Hua could feel Ye Qingtang’s distrust towards her, but she wasn’t worried. “You were brought here by the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix.”

This simple sentence was enough to prove her point. After all, the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix was extremely strong, so it could easily withstand the void storms but Ye Qingtang...

Once again she was left feeling the vast difference in their powers. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

But she suddenly thought of something as well.

In her previous life when she had come to the Second Domain, she had indeed heard that there were strong forces between the mainlands.

“If you don’t trust me, I can have someone to take you to the edge of the mainland so you can have a look,” Elder Hua said.

With that, Elder Hua lifted her chin at the winged man.

The winged man got the message at once but he was extremely curious as to what Ye Qingtang’s identity was.

Why did Elder Hua care so much about someone from the First Domain?

Who was this human?

“There’s no need to, I believe you.” Ye Qingtang went through all the information she had of the Second Domain in her mind. In her previous life, she had heard of both the Temple of Paragon as well as the void storms before.

It was true that she didn’t have the power to withstand it.

She wasn’t an idiot and could hear that Elder Hua wanted her to stay. After all, there was no way that every single person in the Temple of Paragon was so busy they couldn’t make time to send her back.

“Since that’s the case, I guess I’ll stay for a few days.” She decided to stay at the Temple of Paragon for now as she thought of ways to sneak away.

Elder Hua smiled gently, satisfied with Ye Qingtang’s reply. She brought her back into the main hall.

The winged man looked as Ye Qingtang and Elder Hua returned to the main hall. He was surprised again when he saw her once again walk into the temple alone.

That human... how could she move so freely in and out of the temple?

The winged man wanted to try entering it himself but gave up in fear when he saw the illusionary space.

“Could the elders... have given the ring to her?” the winged man murmured, before dismissing the thought immediately. It was absurd to even think such a thing.

...

Like that, Ye Qingtang was brought back into the temple by Elder Hua. When they entered, Elder Bai and the others in the main hall were already gone. Elder Hua materialized a colorful butterfly in her hand.

“It will take you to your room.”

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and followed the butterfly out of the main hall. Elder Hua’s smile vanished from her face as Ye Qingtang left.

“Guardian, are you certain she’s the reincarnation of the Holy Lord?” Elder Bai’s voice rang out in the main hall but he was nowhere to be seen.

“I’m not a hundred percent certain, but the possibility is high,” the fox-faced man replied.
