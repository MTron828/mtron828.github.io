Yun Shu, who was chatting with his family clan people, turned around as well. When Yun Shu looked at the calm and breathtaking girl standing alone in front of Lu Xiuwen and his people, curiosity filled his eyes.

“That lady is young and impetuous. She may be on the losing end,” sighed someone from the Liu Yun family clan upon witnessing the sight.

“Why?” asked Yun Shu.

“It is still unknown who will be able to enter the sect amongst all the people here today. It is still alright if that young girl enters, as the Formidable Heavens Royals will not dare to do anything to sect disciples. However, if she doesn’t pass the assessment and isn’t from a renowned family clan, how will she be able to fight the royal family?” The person continued. “The Formidable Heavens Royals are not magnanimous people. What that fifth prince, Lu Xiuwen, said just now was merely to scare others since he has a powerful identity.”

The people from Liu Yun family clan disliked the royal family’s arrogance.

Yun Shu frowned slightly.

On the other side, Lu Xiuwen’s face darkened, and a cold sneer formed on his lips as he eyed Ye Qingtang.

“How do I address you?”

With that said, every onlooker knew that Lu Xiuwen was going to record Ye Qingtang’s name down.

Ye Qingtang took a look at Lu Xiuwen unhurriedly and said, “Lin Town, Ye Qingtang.”

Without any hesitation, Ye Qingtang directly reported her name and place of origin.

Lu Xiuwen scoffed, “Ye Qingtang, is it? I’ll remember it.”

Ye Qingtang laughed. “You better remember it clearly.”

She would let this name become Lu Xiuwen’s nightmare ultimately.

Lu Xiuwen narrowed his eyes slightly. “You better pray that you can pass this assessment, otherwise…” Lu Xiuwen did not finish his sentence, but everyone knew what was it going to be.

Quite a number of people secretly sighed for Ye Qingtang. The sect assessment was not easy, and innumerable people were rejected by sects every year.

Now that Lu Xiuwen had asked Ye Qingtang for her name, he would probably not let her off easily in the future.

Taking another look at Ye Qingtang, Lu Xiuwen turned around and led his group of lackeys away without forgetting to tell someone beside him, “Tell royal brother to investigate this Ye Qingtang.”

“Yes.”

“Ye Qingtang is still too young.” After looking on the scene, people from the Liu Yun family clan even more so felt that Ye Qingtang should not have revealed her identity.

However, Yun Shu laughed. “Maybe it’s because she is confident that she’ll pass the assessment?”

“Is a sect assessment that easy though? There’s no certainty to pass even if it’s you, much less that girl.”

Yun Shu laughed without saying anything more, though he paid slight attention to Qingtang instinctively. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Time passed with every minute and second. At the summit, a bright light from within the cloud layers suddenly shone down. The gold light gathered to form an imaginary path which connected the summit to the clouds.

“The Path to Heaven!”

Everyone seemed to stop breathing the moment they saw the gold light.

To enter the sect, they needed to step on the Path to Heaven!

Almost at the same time, all the highly-skilled candidates fixed their eyes on the light before them in silent concentration.

“Go ahead.” The Liu Yun family clan people patted Yun Shu’s shoulders.

Giving a nod, Yun Shu immediately headed towards the Path to Heaven.

The candidates standing at the summit went forward as well. What laid before their eyes was merely a holy beam of light and not a single step. Everyone was confused how exactly to stably walk on the legendary Path to Heaven.

Walk on the Path to Heaven and enter a sect—this was a sentence everyone knew. However, with the Path to Heaven right before their eyes, little did they know what to do.
