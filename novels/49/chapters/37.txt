Chapter 38: Rite of the Sabbath (3)

While standing amongst the crowd beneath the stage, Ye Ling’s face clouded over. Instinctively, he turned a worry-stricken look towards Ye Qingtang, who stood quietly beside him.

Duan Tianrao swept his gaze over the anticipating crowd and without further ado, he announced directly:

“Today, I ask everyone present to stand witness to the renunciation of the engagement between I, Duan Tianrao and Miss Ye Qingtang.”

There were gasps of astonishment throughout the plaza once those words were spoken.

“He’s calling off the engagement now? Why?”

“What he did sure makes the Ye household look bad.”

The common folk was obviously shocked by his announcement. The engagement between the Duan and Ye household, being noble families of equal standing, was a given celebration since long ago. It was hard to imagine their engagement would be renounced today, after all this time.

A shadow crossed Ye Ling’s face instantly, but he knew even if he was to make a fuss now, the person to shoulder all the burden in the end would still be Ye Qingtang. All he could do now was rein himself in.

Duan Tianrao watched the crowd’s reactions and continued his speech unperturbed: “That’s one, and the second piece of news I’ll like to share is that Miss Ye Xun, from the Ye household and I have professed our undying love for one another and we have gotten engaged.”

With that said, Duan Tianrao turned his gaze which directed the crowd’s attention towards Ye Xun, standing next to Duan Tianrui beneath the stage.

Ye Xun, while donned in a white gown highlighting her daintiness, revealed a captivating and bashful smile on her gentle and refined face.

“Xun-er, come on stage.” Duan Tianrao, upon feasting his eyes on her embellishing makeover, wore a bright smile as he reached out to her.

Ye Xun retained a bashful smile as she walked onto the stage under the inquisitive eyes of the crowd. Her fair and delicate hand was held closely by Duan Tianrao once she approached his side.

“Xun-er, you are my fiancée and technically a proud member of our household as well. Why not take this opportunity to give your blessing to the people as one of us too?” Duan Tianrao looked upon her with pampering affection and tenderness. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ye Xun nodded meekly. Her dainty demeanor definitely caught the eyes of several people among the crowd.

Ye Xun, being the prettiest girl in the City of Lin, was a widely accepted opinion among the common folk of the city. Seeing her in the flesh reinforced that opinion. As she stood quietly next to the dashing Duan Tianrao, everyone thought that they were a match made in heaven.

“I must say, Miss Ye Xun’s indeed a perfect match for Mr Duan Tianrao.”

The crowd was also shocked by the second piece of news Duan Tianrao had announced. Calling off the engagement with Ye Qingtang in the first instant, but getting engaged with Ye Xun, who was also from the Ye household next, was certainly out of their expectations.

But….

Though they might have found it sudden, after getting a closer look at the couple on stage, they began to acknowledge they were a better match.

Although Ye Xun was adopted by the Ye household, she was a natural beauty, whose cordial nature had earned the praises of many. An embodiment of the perfect wife in the hearts of many men.

“Since its your recommendation, I’ll give it a try.” Ye Xun replied modestly, with a gentle smile that had certainly mesmerized her surrounding men.

Duan Tianrao stepped back as he gave a nod.

With a piercing glance, Ye Xun summoned her strength discreetly as she focused her attention on the wheel. The her today was no longer just an adopted lady from the Ye household. She was Duan Tianrao’s fiancée, and also the First Lady of the Duan household in the near future.
