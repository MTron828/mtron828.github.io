Chapter 20: Conceive a Child (1)

Old Master Si bore a strange countenance.

Ye Qingtang certainly knew about the relationship between Mu Su and the Si household. In her past, after the Si household was eradicated by Ye You, Mu Su actually took revenge for them. If Ye You’s mentor had not intervened in the nick of time, she would most likely have been killed by Mu Su.

Mu Su was a dignitary who held a special status. He was the real goal behind Ye Qingtang’s goodwill to the Si household. Only a person as powerful and influential as him could advocate for her referral to an Exalted clan!

Only by becoming an Exalted disciple, would she gain enough assets for her showdown with Ye You!

“This…. might require further consideration. As the decision is not mine, his lordship, Mu Su must be consulted beforehand.” Old Master Si faltered, as he could not call the shots on this matter.

Ye Qingtang smiled and said: “I’m willing to wait.” She strongly believed that for the sake of Si Bai, Old Master Si would give his all to persuade Mu Su in granting her a meeting.

Old Master Si nodded briefly, “I’ll convey your request to his lordship, but be reminded, his lordship holds the final say.” Though having said that, Old Master Si did not forget to sum up his promise by including the statement: “I’ll try my best.”

“Ye Qingtang hereby thanks Master Si in advance.” Ye Qingtang expressed her gratitude.

“It’s the least I can do. You’ve saved San-er and we, the Si household, have never owed anyone favors. Exchanging favors in return is to be expected.” Old Master Si concluded.

Ye Qingtang laughed, she obviously knew the Si household’s commandments, otherwise she would not be so determined to approach them.

Although they were unable to recompense for her method of restoring Si Bai’s longevity at the moment, the two lists of prescriptions which she offered was enough to earn the Si household’s appreciation.

Dr Xu took the opportunity to discuss the prescriptions with Ye Qingtang. An experienced and renowned physician consulting a young girl, holding her in high regards over her medical expertise, was quite a sight to behold indeed.

Ye Qingtang had accomplished her objective, hence she stood up from her seat and bid her valediction: “Its late, I think it’s time I made my exit.”

Old Master Si nodded briefly and specifically instructed the household’s steward to escort her out.

As he watched Ye Qingtang leave the hall, Old Master Si put on his thinking cap.

This young lady from the Ye household, why was she totally different from the rumors? Her gallant perspective and composure were hard to find even among his peers. Once he turned his gaze, he saw his own grandson seated with a hand on his chin, looking at him with a mischievous grin.

“I remembered grandpa always wanted a granddaughter?”

The current Si household were blessed with three little scamps, but alas, they were all male.

Old Master Si frowned and rebuked:” Stop your nonsense!”

Si Bai chuckled and as he lowered his head to act remorseful, he recalled Ye Qingtang’s unwavering demeanor.

Ye Qingtang is …. quite interesting.

Ye Qingtang went straight home after leaving the Si household. Ye Ling was totally perplexed when he saw his daughter returned empty-handed, but he decided not to ask. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Upon returning to her room, Ye Qingtang began her training right away. The reemergence of her spirit root was a miracle, but without proper cultivation, not much could be achieved from it. She could not just bide her time if she wanted to make the most out of this.

When darkness descended, Ye Qingtang ended her training. She donned her nightgown and went to bed. While she slept like a log, she was completely oblivious to the dark miasma that surged from the demon emperor’s heart, pulsating beneath her chest. This miasma which aided in the resurgence of her spirit root began spilling from her body.

The exuded miasma accumulated at one point before forming into a little black orb which shuffled over to her chest before snuggling down on it.

Amidst the darkness of the night, two stalwart figures appeared at the gates of the Ye household.

Mu Su looked over at the Ye residence. After hesitating for a moment, he turned his sight towards the man who stood in front of him, that expressionless enigma whose allure was out of this world.
