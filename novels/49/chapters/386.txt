Shock filled their faces.

Earlier on, they did not even manage to see how Ye Qingtang struck, and although they heard from Song Junqiu that Ye Qingtang knew the profound skill of the motion of drawing a sword, they were not too bothered with it.

After all, their skills overpowered Ye Qingtang’s, and even if she used that move, it would definitely not be able to block one move from them.

But the three people were a little dumbfounded by everything that happened.

Four people attacked, and three swords were broken. Only Song Junqiu’s Glacial Frost Sword did not have any traces of breaking.

However, Song Junqiu’s expression was frighteningly dark at that moment. The blood that flowed out of his purlicue gradually stained the sword handle red, and there was actually a one-finger-wide dent on the blade of the Glacial Frost Sword that he took pride in!

“The Glacial Frost Sword is damaged? How is this possible?”

The surrounding disciples below the ring took in the scene with their mouths hung ajar.

Ye Qingtang actually used one move to break three weapons and damaged the Glacial Frost Sword. How bizarre was that? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Everyone’s eyes landed on the unattractive sword in Ye Qingtang’s hands. At that moment, the disciples realized that the ordinary-looking blade seemed to hold many stars which twinkled brightly under the scorching sun.

“What is the sword in Ye Qingtang’s hand? How could it actually damage the Glacial Frost Sword?”

“I’ve never seen it before…”

Song Junqiu narrowed his eyes. He initially thought that Ye Qingtang would die from this combined attack of four people, yet unexpectedly, he embarrassed himself instead. Clutching onto the handle of the Glacial Frost Sword, he looked at Ye Qingtang’s sword and spoke coldly. “Junior Sister Ye’s sword seems to have some background. I wonder what sword it is?”

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled into a seeming smile. “Demonic Blood Sword.”

“Demonic Blood Sword?” Song Junqiu frowned slightly.

He had heard of the Demonic Blood Sword before. It was a pretty good sword that was extremely sharp, and it emitted a demonic air. However, in terms of strength, it was completely incomparable to the Glacial Frost Sword. If the two swords clashed head-on, the broken sword would definitely be the Demonic Blood Sword.

However…

Currently, his Glacial Frost Sword was the one that was chipped off!

Song Junqiu felt that there was something odd about Ye Qingtang’s Demonic Blood Sword. They underestimated her previously and did not expect Ye Qingtang to have such a good sword. However…

They would not give Ye Qingtang a chance again.

“Your sword is pretty good, but… to win the ring, you can’t rely solely on a good sword,” Song Junqiu said coldly. He exchanged a look with the other three people and immediately charged towards Ye Qingtang with a sword.

This time, only Song Junqiu attacked while the other three stood aside without moving.

A scoff flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes, and her sneer deepened as Song Junqiu came nearer.

In just a moment, Song Junqiu and Ye Qingtang were in a tussle, and their combined breaths were like a whirlwind that caused turbulence the surrounding air.

Song Junqiu was currently stage three of the First Heaven. His attacks were violent, and he had frightening strength. He knew that there was something strange about Ye Qingtang’s Demonic Blood Sword and thus simply did not intend to fight with her using swords. Directly closing their distance without giving Ye Qingtang a chance to escape, he directed energy into his palm and crashed his palm towards her forehead.

Ye Qingtang dodged swiftly and avoided Song Junqiu’s slap.
