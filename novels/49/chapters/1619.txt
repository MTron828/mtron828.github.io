Chapter 1620: Mission Countdown (1)

“Wh... What?” The Monza King did not expect his attractive conditions to be rejected.

“You don’t agree? Are you aware that you will really violate the mainland convention if you continue keeping her here? I’m doing this for the good of both our kingdoms.”

“Please leave immediately.” The Supreme League King ordered him to leave.

The Monza King’s face darkened completely. He shot the Supreme League King a furious look and scoffed before leaving the hall with his men.

Once the Monza King left, the Supreme League King’s expression turned for the better, and he looked toward Ye Qingtang.

“The mainland convention is always a cover for those cowards. How ridiculous is it to have a powerful protector and not send him or her to war because of a vague convention?”

Ye Qingtang smiled gently.

Over the past few days, the King frequently summoned her to discuss the situation of the current war, and Ye Qingtang was very clear about the King’s ambition of dominating the entire mainland.

Restricting the Supreme League King with a mainland convention?

What a joke.

Would a person who dares to become enemies with the entire mainland be scared of such a lame thing?

The King looked toward the sky outside the hall and placed his hands behind his back. “Since a long time ago, I have already thought that I definitely would not care about the mainland convention if I have a Kingdom Protector. It’s their idiocy and cowardice to not dare to let their Kingdom Protector participate in warfare. I... will never be as incapable as them.”

Afterward, the King’s eyes focused back on Ye Qingtang.

“Tang, are you willing to forget about the mainland convention and make the Supreme League Kingdom the hegemon of this mainland with me?”

The King seemed to be inquiring, yet also testing, Ye Qingtang.

“I am willing to serve you, Your Majesty.” Ye Qingtang bowed slowly.

The Supreme League King was not a hero, but he was a formidable character in troubled times.

And her mission was to assist this formidable character to become the ruler of this mainland.

The King laughed. He was extremely satisfied with Ye Qingtang’s reply, and his trust in her increased a lot.

“Tang, are you confident you can deal with other protectors?”

Once Ye Qingtang participated in a war, the mainland convention on the protector restriction would be violated. The Supreme League King was sure that other kingdoms would definitely not sit and wait for death; other Kingdom Protectors would participate in the upcoming battles.

Ye Qingtang said, “I will definitely present Your Majesty with the ruler position.”

The King was in a slight daze and subsequently laughed out.

He felt assured after hearing Ye Qingtang’s declaration.

The Supreme League King’s prediction was not unfounded.

The kingdoms were not foolish—the Supreme League Kingdom violated the mainland convention by sending a Kingdom Protector to participate in warfare. This was a clear challenge to the entire mainland!

The Monza Kingdom, which was previously embarrassed by the Supreme League Kingdom, joined the allied forces’ camp with its massive military force. The remaining few neutral kingdoms also joined in to punish the Supreme League Kingdom. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Since the Supreme League Kingdom was the first to go against the mainland convention, the other kingdoms in the allied forces did not hold back anymore and successively deployed their Kingdom Protectors to the front lines.

They wanted to see how a Kingdom Protector of the Supreme League Kingdom could fight against so many Kingdom Protectors of theirs!

The moment the Kingdom Protectors participated in the war, this conflict that spanned across the entire mainland had already developed in an uncontrollable direction.
