Chapter 1474 Land of Infinite Demons 3

After all, Jiang Qin and Jiang Shun had always stayed in the Jiang Family while Jiang Lang and his wife resided elsewhere permanently.

“If they wish to die, I am happy to help.” Jiang Lang scoffed coldly.

A laugh escaped Jiang Xun’s mouth as she shook her head. Her gaze suddenly landed on Ye Qingtang and said, “Brat, you are not as steady as your daughter. Little one, come here. Let great-aunt take a close look at you.”

Ye Qingtang was silent.

Great-aunt, with that vision of yours, you will probably still find my face extremely blurry even if I stick my face on your eyes…

But Ye Qingtang still went over obediently.

Jiang Xun stretched her hand out to touch Ye Qingtang’s physique, and a smile appeared on her face.

“Not bad, you have good potential. It’s just a spirit root. There are plenty of people who cultivate into a supreme figure without a spirit root.”

Ye Qingtang rubbed her nose secretly. Jiang Xun probably heard about the grudge between her and Ye You; thus, she assumed that she did not have a spirit root.

In reality…

Ye Qingtang had a spirit root. Moreover, after leaving the one-star constellation, Ye Qingtang’s spirit root advanced to the green spirit root and was only one step away from her original blue spirit root.

There was laughter but also tears.

Although the Domain Monarch’s decision was impartial, Ye You began to sob when she returned to the room, and her pale face ached Jiang Qin.

“You, you have suffered today. Don’t cry anymore. Rest assured, as long as that little b*tch, Ye Qingtang, is in the Jiang Family, I definitely will not let her have an easy time.”

Ye You wiped her tears and looked at Jiang Qin sorrowfully.

“Aunt Qin, does grandfather not like me… I don’t feel that I suffered. I’m just afraid that… grandfather is dissatisfied with me… I just returned to the Jiang Family, but my parents are not around anymore. My only relatives left are you all now. I’m very scared… that grandfather is dissatisfied with me over this matter…”

Jiang Qin comforted her immediately. “Why would your grandfather not like you? You are so obedient and sensible. Today’s incident happened all because of that Ye Qingtang. Who does she think she is?”

Then, Jiang Qin looked at the sullen Jiang Shun, who was also extremely moody.

“Eldest brother, is Yiming’s incident really over just like that? He is your only son.”

Jiang Shun’s expression darkened. “Of course not. It’s time to head to the Land of Infinite Demons a few days later. I will give them back double the misery then.”

Jiang Qin’s eyes lit up.

“Eldest brother, you mean…”

Jiang Shun said, “The leader of the group into the Land of Infinite Demons this time is fifth great-uncle.”

A trace of delight emerged on Jiang Qin’s face when she heard Jiang Shun. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Jiang Shun’s eldest uncle, Jiang Kai, grew up beside his fifth great-uncle and was also regarded highly by him. Jiang Shun was jointly greatly adored by their fifth great-uncle.

Although Jiang Lang was very talented back then, he behaved outrageously. The Domain Monarch still thought highly of him, and ultimately, it was their fifth great-uncle who came forward to reprimand Jiang Lang’s misbehavior. Furthermore, he invested a lot of effort to train Jiang Shun. Thus, Jiang Shun possessed the authority to manage the family’s affairs on behalf of the Domain Monarch.

“This is great. If fifth great-uncle is the leader this time, by then…” A thought struck Jiang Qin suddenly.

Jiang Shun scoffed. “Mo Yi injured my son, and I will want her daughter to pay with her life.”

“This incident was caused by Ye Qingtang from the start, and she ought to pay with her life.” Jiang Qin chuckled.

She wanted to see if Ye Qingtang could still make it out alive after entering the Land of Infinite Demons.
