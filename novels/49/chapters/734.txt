“He is Ye Chen? That fellow who got in through the back door?” Discussions erupted in the crowd, and it was clear that the news from Xiong Feng had already circulated in Falling Sky Valley. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Some Admirable Sky Peak disciples were dumbfounded.

Just a while ago, they heard from somewhere that a person was accepted as Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple as an exception after presenting gifts to their master.

When they heard this, they were still grumbling about it in their hearts.

Perfected Xuanchen had never accepted a disciple as an exception, yet he suddenly made such a choice today. This caused many to feel rather unbalanced and look down on that foreign-looking new disciple.

It seemed to them that the new disciple who got in through the back door must be a hedonistic son of wealthy parents.

Yet, unexpectedly…

They actually met him now.

However, this meeting faded their contempt for him.

After Perfected Xuanchen became the Valley Master, Admirable Sky Peak’s disciples had been suffering in silence. Even if they were taken advantage of in other peaks, they could only hold back their anger for the sake of taking the big picture into consideration.

This new fellow, however, beat those Blue Cloud Peak’s scumbags into pulp, which sparked a jolly feeling in the other Admirable Sky Peak disciples.

“Ye Chen, is it? You have the guts. You rely on the fact that your Master is the Valley…” Those Blue Cloud Peak disciples were about to ramble on.

Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly. “Do you all know how to talk about other things? So what if my Master is the Valley Master? Should all of us Admirable Sky Peak disciples behave by tucking our tail between our legs just because of that? What has today’s incident got to do with my Master? If you all refuse to accept this, just come at me all together. I’ll beat you all up until you all are willing to concede defeat.”

Ye Qingtang simply could not be bothered to speak to these Blue Cloud Peak disciples.

In her previous life, Perfected Xuanchen also made his disciples exercise forbearance in consideration of the big picture, but in the end, it only emboldened the various Peak Masters and disciples, and Falling Sky Valley was even more chaotic. As a result, when Falling Sky Valley met with a calamity, each peak defended themselves instead of coming together as one and were attacked one by one.

Falling Sky Valley was mighty, but because everyone harbored different intentions, it was all but a disunited valley.

Some people were like that: if you let them have his way and tolerated their antics, they would become even more savage and not know how to exercise restraint. Only when they were beaten up would they realize that they had to listen to whoever with a harder fist.

Ye Qingtang had always believed in Perfected Xuanchen’s direction in maintaining the harmony in Falling Sky Valley, but facts had proven that even if her Master accommodated others, it was merely asking for trouble by indulging the enemy. In the past, he had inflated other Peak Masters’ ambitions and fattened the guts of various peaks’ disciples.

In this life, she would not let them have their way again.

“What a big talker!” The Blue Cloud Peak disciples’ expression darkened. They unsheathed their swords and immediately charged towards Ye Qingtang.

Yan Shu and Yin Qingluo were shocked and wanted to step in.

However…

A trace of coldness flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes, and she drew out the Demonic Blood Sword. As she waved her hand, a sword aura suddenly rushed out from her blade.

Clank clank clank!!

Numerous clear sounds rang.

Wherever the cold glint slashed across, several broken sword tips fell on the ground!

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples’ swords were broken by Ye Qingtang’s sword aura.

The remaining sword aura pounded on the chest of those Blue Cloud Peak disciples and sent them flying away immediately.

“Who still refuses to accept this? Just come on up.” Ye Qingtang swept a cold glance across the crowd.
