Chapter 812 Shameless (1)

Late in the night, the little white tiger snored and was in deep sleep.

At the same time, black mist emerged out of Ye Qingtang’s chest and subsequently formed into the shape of a ball.

With a swoosh, the little black ball vanished from the room and was already outside the hall when it appeared once again.

“Arh-wooo!”

Suddenly, the silver wolf noticed the little ball of black mist which was floating in the air and bared its fangs immediately. It scowled at the little black ball evilly with a fierce expression.

“What are you looking at? I’ll dig your eyeballs out if you look at me again.” The little black ball threatened with a baby voice.

“ARH-W000000!”

Upon hearing that, the silver wolf was enraged instantly. It had been threatened twice with the same thing.

In a flash, the silver wolf lunged towards the little black ball in the air.

“Get lost!” The little black ball shouted and was not seen to do anything, but the silver wolf was hurled away.

The silver wolf wailed and laid outside the door with its tail tucked.

The silver wolf finally gained consciousness after much difficulty, but it felt that its life was full of grievances…

A while later, the little black ball floated to the little white tiger’s front and stared at it for a long time.

Before long, a cold glint shone in the little black ball’s eyes, and it pounced on the little white tiger immediately.

“Roar!”

At the same time, the little white tiger roared thunderously. Its body enlarged rapidly, and it swung its paw at the little black ball.

Boom!

An explosive sound rang. After exchanging a blow, the white tiger and little black both retreated at the same time.

“Don’t provoke me.” The handsome and huge tiger roared coldly as its icy gaze landed on the little black ball in the air.

A look of surprise emerged in the little black ball’s bright eyes, and it sized up the white tiger. “You’re all to blame for making my would-be father leave in a fit of pique!”

“Would-be father. Who is your would-be father?” the white tiger said coldly.

“Demon God!” The little black ball replied angrily.

“Oh? It’s the Demon God, Han Cangming?” The white tiger sneered upon hearing that. “What has his departure got to do with me?”

“Hmph. Don’t be in the way and interfere with my would-be father and my mother!” The little black ball scorned.

“In the way…” The white tiger nodded and continued. “I really am in your way… I will keep being in the way for this matter. What can you do about me?”

“I’m so mad!” The little black ball glared at the white tiger fiercely. A frightening aura exploded out of it, and it charged towards the white tiger immediately.

“Get lost!”

The white tiger’s eyes flickered. Its furious holler was like thunder as it slapped its paw down at the little black ball.

Boom Boom!!

Explosive sounds rang continuously, and the entire Bliss Forging Workshop was torn apart by the fight between the white tiger and the little black ball.

“Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking of.” The little black ball glared at the white tiger with a raging fury. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I’ll return this sentence back to you, word for word… Don’t think that I don’t know what you’re thinking of too.” The white tiger snickered.

Before waiting for the little black ball to say anything, Ye Qingtang suddenly appeared at the scene. The little black ball masked itself in the darkness almost instantly and dashed into the inner hall.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply at the sight of the crumbling outer hall. She looked at the enlarged white tiger and then at the silver wolf which was curled up in a corner.

Looking at the scene, it was evident that the white tiger went berserk all of a sudden.
