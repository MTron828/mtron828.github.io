Chapter 1145: Giving One’s All In Acting (4)

Regardless of martial realm or the source of energy in the body, Ye Qingtang was inferior to this golden-robed man.

If they fought, the chance of her winning would be less than twenty percent even if she used all her cards…

If they did what Ling Yan said and left Wind Cloud City earlier from the start, she and Blood Moon Holy Lord would not meet this golden-robed man. However, the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s appearance completely disrupted Ye Qingtang’s momentum, and she could not retreat early as per Ling Yan’s plan…

“If I join forces with Blood Moon Elder, the chance of winning is only about thirty percent…” Ye Qingtang estimated in her heart. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A thirty percent chance of winning was still too dangerous, and even if she could really win, injuries were unavoidable. However, Ye Qingtang was at least forty percent confident that she could escape. Since Blood Moon Elder wanted to enter the Ancient You Clan’s headquarters, there was no need to bother with him, and the success rate of fleeing alone would be much higher.

“It seems that you ants from this low-level mainland have a backbone… However, the price of having a backbone is to pay it with your life!”

As the golden-robed man spoke, he swung a palm out.

The power of a Heavenly Venerate rampaged through the place and slashed toward Ye Qingtang forcefully.

However, at this instant, the Blood Moon Elder who was standing behind the golden-robed man acted, and his eyes twinkled dangerously.

“Swoosh!”

The moment when the gold-robed man launched his attack, the Blood Moon Elder suddenly smashed his fist at him.

Sensing the frightening force that was coming in his way, the golden-robed man was slightly startled, and he looked behind instinctively.

However, what entered his eyes was a metal fist that was comparable to a small mountain peak.

The golden-robed man did not have any defense against the Blood Moon Elder. Caught off-guard, he got hit by the Blood Moon Elder’s punch that was thrown with all his might.

A deafening sound erupted, and the golden-robed man was subsequently buried under the Blood Moon Elder’s fist.

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!!

As Blood Moon Elder’s punch landed, the ground shattered, and the numerous cracks on the ground extended out like little snakes.

“Hahaha, idiots of Ancient You Clan. This person is a general with such a brain. Looks like I can be the Clan Master of your Ancient You Clan!”

The Blood Moon Elder guffawed when he succeeded with one strike.

This new body was truly beyond Blood Moon Elder’s imagination. Apart from perfect defense, it also had an exceptional perfect strength.

Ye Qingtang was surprised by Blood Moon Elder’s sudden “rebellion”.

Although she knew that the Blood Moon Elder would definitely wait for an opportunity to attack, his timing was rather unexpected.

What Ye Qingtang was more surprised was that this golden-robed man was completely unsuspecting of “Elder Yin Fo”. Otherwise, if he had any guard up against Blood Moon Elder, given his skills, Blood Moon Elder would definitely not be able to succeed with one strike.

However, it was almost too unrealistic to kill that golden-robed man with just one punch from Blood Moon Elder.

“Elder… Yin Fo!”

Suddenly, a bone-curdling cold voice that had a trace of anger sounded from the ground.

Boom!

Before their naked eyes, the ground exploded, and the golden-robed man emerged from underground. His golden Chinese robe was stained with dust, and there was a glaring trace of blood on the corner of his lips, making him appear rather miserable.
