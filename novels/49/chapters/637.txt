“Haha, Holy Lady, I did not fall asleep. I was just resting with my eyes closed…” the Blood Moon Elder said and smiled.

Ye Qingtang did not bother to reply to him. She frowned and pointed towards the bottom of the cliff.

The Blood Moon Elder looked towards the direction she pointed at, and surprise emerged in his eyes.

There were many fierce beasts appearing on the first level.

There were blood-red giant mice that were a few meters tall and giant flying ants that seemed to be made from iron.

A few special plants that grew in the ice also seemed to begin their attacks.

There was a team of ten super sect disciples who were defending themselves under the cliff. However, they were bitten to death by the giant mice after a short while.

“What’s going on…” The Blood Moon Elder was shocked. Everything in the land of inheritance changed over the night, and so many unknown creatures appeared.

“It seems like my predictions are correct.” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply and murmured.

Ye Qingtang felt that it was peculiar when the mysterious black-robed man revealed her location earlier.

He purposely mentioned that she was heading towards the land of inheritance.

Ye Qingtang suspected earlier that not only did the black-robed man target her, but he was also targeting everyone here. It seemed that he intended to attract everyone into the land of inheritance here.

Ye Qingtang was more sure that there was something on the third level that required cultivators’ blood to nurture as the blood of the cultivators flew up and disappeared constantly.

“Is it possible that the black-robed man wants to use our blood to nurture something on the third level? That’s why he started the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka and attracted everyone here?” Ye Qingtang looked towards upwards.

“F*ck, these creatures must be able to sense my presence as the Fiendcelestial Beast. That’s why they appeared… They want to eat my meat and drink my blood!” The white tiger sized up the unknown creatures that clustered at the bottom. Its eyes were full of nervousness.

“Can you stop being so narcissistic? Their appearance is to kill the cultivators who entered this place. How are they linked to you?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at the white tiger and mocked.

Before the white tiger could say anything, the image of the black-robed man appeared in mid-air again.

“Guys… there are only a few days left till the closure of the Hell of Avicinaraka… Thus, I want to play a game with you.”

The black-robed man’s voice diffused through everywhere and traveled into everyone’s ears.

The few thousand people who were scattered around all looked up instinctively as they heard the black-robed man’s voice. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“The land of inheritance here is just a place of death… It’s easy to enter but not so easy to leave… Then, I’ll set a rule for this game… There’s only one of you here who can walk out of the land of inheritance and the Hell of Avicinaraka alive… If no one meets my requirement within five days, I will turn on the Blood Incantation array formation and kill everyone here. You will decide your own fate now.”

The black-robed man’s image disappeared slowly as he finished his words.

“Who are you?!”

“Only one person can leave alive… You want us to kill each other?!”

“What a vicious bastard! Do you dare to reveal your true identity!”
