1441 Enemies Meet Again 1

“Don’t let her escape! Kill her!” Jiang Yiming was pallid and sweating. He bared his teeth and bellowed with rage as he looked at the fleeing Ye Qingtang.

The group immediately chased after Ye Qingtang and the Beidou Demon Lord while Ye Xun supported Jiang Yiming, who was in such pain that he could not straighten up.

Ye Qingtang and the Beidou Demon Lord fled at top speed, but Jiang Yiming’s men were extremely able and managed to dog them closely. Coupled with the fact that they were more familiar with the Jiang House, the distance between them and Ye Qingtang gradually narrowed.

Ye Qingtang swiftly glanced about, looking for an escape route.

Just as Ye Qingtang and the Beidou Demon Lord were looking for an escape route, Jiang Liu, who had been speaking to an elder in the front yard, noticed that something was amiss with Ye Qingtang.

“Tang Tang, what’s going on?” Jiang Liu blocked Ye Qingtang’s way. The elder standing next to Jiang Liu looked at Ye Qingtang sternly.

“She’s Ye Qingtang?” The old man asked grimly.

“Yes, Elder Meng, she is Ye Qingtang.” Jiang Liu replied.

Elder Meng sized Ye Qingtang up with sharp eyes.

Ye Qingtang wanted to continue fleeing, but Jiang Liu blocked her way. However, Ye Qingtang calmed down when she saw Jiang Liu.

No matter how arrogant that brat Jiang Yiming was, he could not possibly do anything to her in front of Jiang Liu, right?

Jiang Yiming and the others, who were following closely behind, flew towards them when they saw that Ye Qingtang had stopped.

“You despicable person, do you think you can escape?”

Jiang Liu was surprised to suddenly see a group of youths from the Jiang Family chasing Ye Qingtang.

“How dare you. What are you doing?” Jiang Liu looked displeased when he spoke.

When the group of youths saw Jiang Liu and Elder Meng, they immediately quietened down.

“Third Uncle, don’t let that despicable person escape!” Jiang Yimeng hobbled over, supported by Ye Xun. His handsome face was ashen, and large drops of sweat clung to his cheeks.

Jiang Liu wanted to reprimand Jiang Yiming for spouting nonsense but was taken aback by his haggard appearance.

“Yiming, what… happened to you?”

Jiang Yiming gritted his teeth and glared at Ye Qingtang, who was standing behind Jiang Liu.

“It’s all her fault!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Jiang Liu was bewildered. Jiang Yiming was his elder brother’s child, and they had always been close. Ye Qingtang had just returned to the Jiang Family yesterday, so why were the two at loggerheads?

Ye Xun, who was standing nearby, took it all in and said, “Third Uncle, Ye Qingtang went berserk just now and suddenly struck Elder Brother Ming with an underhanded blow. That’s why we’re chasing her.”

Jiang Liu was shocked to hear this. He involuntarily glanced at Ye Qingtang and Jiang Yiming.

Ye Qingtang injured Jiang Yiming?

How can that be possible?

Jiang Liu was well aware of Jiang Yiming’s abilities. Ye Qingtang could not possibly hurt him.

However…

At that moment, Jiang Yiming’s ashen face, and his slightly arched back showed what poor state he was in. Also, Ye Qingtang had been fleeing, so there must be something to it.

Before Jiang Liu could get to the bottom of the matter, Elder Meng, who was standing nearby, suddenly gave a cold laugh.

“Disobedient creature. You’ve only just returned to the Jiang Family, but you’re so wild that you dared to strike a fellow brother. This one is definitely a bad apple.”
