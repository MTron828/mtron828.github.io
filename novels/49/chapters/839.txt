Chapter 840 Play A Game

Nonetheless, the enraged Soul Eater Daoist did not dare to go near Ling Yan at all.

In Eternal Dynasty and even the entire Central Mainland, this man had the equivalent of zero martial skills, yet he played the world in his hands.

“Soul Eater Daoist, perhaps, my head is more valuable than the treasures in the Dragon Vein. Now that I have sent myself here for you to behead me, are you really going to give up on this chance?” Ling Yan sized up Soul Eater Daoist with a penetrating gaze that seemed to be able to see through everyone clearly.

At this instant, Soul Eater Daoist’s eyes flickered persistently.

However, he scoffed after a long while. “Heh heh. Ling Yan… don’t think that I don’t know what game you’re playing. You’re simply goading me… According to my guess, your guards should be finding the Dragon Vein nearby. Thus, you’re merely making an empty show of strength. Do you think that I will be scared and toyed by you?”

After hearing Soul Eater Daoist, Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly into a devilish smile.

Ling Yan stretched his arm out immediately and curled his index finger with his palm facing upward. “Since you saw through it, why aren’t you coming to kill me? Come over. Don’t disappoint me.”

Soul Eater Daoist stood at the same spot and was in deep thought for a long time. Eventually, he scoffed and said, “Ling Yan, I have no time to talk nonsense with you today… The next time I meet you, I’ll definitely take your lowly life!”

After finishing his sentence, Soul Eater Daoist rushed to the sky immediately and disappeared without a trace.

Seeing that Soul Eater Daoist actually fled without fighting, Master Du could not help but inspect the youth in white.

“Where is this person from? I see that his martial aura is at most at the Martial Qi Level Three realm, but even an Arcane Supremacy was scared away. How unbelievable.” Master Du told Ye Qingtang softly.

What kind of concept was an Arcane Supremacy? Any figure above the Yin Yang Perfected Lord could easily crush a Yin Yang Perfected Lord with a finger, and a Martial Qi Level Three was like an ant in the eyes of an Arcane Supremacy.

“Ling Yan, Central Mainland… Eternal Dynasty’s Third Prince…” Ye Qingtang muttered softly and peered at the man in white.

At that moment, Ling Yan’s galaxy-like eyes similarly landed on Ye Qingtang with a seeming smile.

“Many thanks.”

Ye Qingtang thanked Ling Yan with cupped fists very quickly.

Ling Yan walked towards Ye Qingtang and said, “You seem to be familiar with me.”

“What are you saying, Young Sir? This is the first time we met,” Ye Qingtang said.

However, Ling Yan shook his head and explained. “Words may lie, but eyes will not… Your eyes tell me that we have met before in the past.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

Everyone said that Ling Yan’s intelligence was demon-like, but she never thought that he could analyze all of that from just her careless gaze…

“Young Sir Ling Yan, I am a cultivator on this mainland. The spirit energy here is thin, and there are very few cultivators who headed to the outside world. Furthermore, I’m only at a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord Realm. How is it possible for me to head to the mainland that you’re from and meet you before this?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“That’s right.” Ling Yan nodded, and the corners of his lips tugged up subsequently. “But it’s strange exactly because of that.”

“How about you and I… play a game?” Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang with a seeming smile.
