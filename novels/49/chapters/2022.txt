Chapter 2023: Phenomenal War (2)

“Are we really declaring war on the Ancient You Clan?” One youth from the ancient clans panicked, looking at his friend with uncertainty.

“The Holy Lord announced it so I think it should be the truth,” an elder from the ancient clan said in response.

“The Ancient You Clan is so strong... Are we even their match?”

“The Ancient You Clan destroyed so many ancient clans. They’re remarkable. The Temple of Shadows will be fine with the Holy Lord of Shadows and Ming Di overseeing them, but for us... It’s going to be death once war breaks out...”

Quite a number of the ancient clans panicked. They hated the Ancient You Clan’s brazen ways, but at the same time, were afraid of how powerful the Ancient You Clan was.

They had turned to the Temple of Shadows in order to stay alive, now that they had to fight with the powerful Ancient You Clan, they quivered.

“Holy Lord, the ancient clans want to talk to you.” Ming Wang flew into the sky and reported to Ye Qingtang. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang flew down after hearing the news, landing among the troop of ancient clans.

The ancient clans had been waiting for some time. When they saw Ye Qingtang, they exchanged glances.

“Holy Lord.”

The master of the Baili family stepped up and said, “Holy Lord, will we be having a showdown with the Ancient You Clan?”

“Of course,” Ye Qingtang answered.

The masters’ expression instantly darkened after hearing Ye Qingtang.

Ming Wang’s eyes narrowed.

After a moment, the master of the Baili family finally spoke. “We’re grateful for the Holy Lord’s benevolence. We will help when the Temple of Shadows is in need, but all the ancient clans want is to stay alive...”

Those words were full of mockery towards Ye Qingtang.

Lady Ghost and the others from the Temple of Shadows’ expressions darkened when they heard the master of Baili family’s words.

“What do you mean?” Lady Ghost asked with a cold voice.

The master of the Baili family answered, “The Ancient You Clan is after the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos and we’ve already handed the fragments to the Holy Lord of Shadows. To be frank, we have nothing to do with the Ancient You Clan now. We’ll be glad if the Temple of Shadows plans to deal with the Ancient You Clan, but we’ve suffered so much already, we don’t have the capacity to join the war. We will be waiting for the Holy Lord’s good news.”

Although the master of the Baili family was indirect about it, there was no one present who did not understand what he meant.

The ancient clans didn’t plan to fight it out with the Ancient You Clan after experiencing their prowess.

“You want to leave?” Lady Ghost scoffed.

The masters of the ancient clans didn’t say a word. After all, Lady Ghost was right.

“You humans are ridiculous. Who was the one who begged the Temple of Shadows to save your lives? Now that we have to fight the enemies, all of you are backing out and getting the Temple of Shadows to take the front line. How manipulative.” Lady Ghost’s eyes narrowed furiously, slamming the metal whip on the ground.

“We are grateful for the Holy Lord’s help, it’s just that... the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos are no longer in our hands. We no longer have any conflict with the Ancient You Clan...” One master said shamelessly.

Ye Qingtang just watched them without saying a word or giving any reaction.

Everyone was waiting for Ye Qingtang’s response. After all, the ancient clans would never dare to leave without hearing from the Holy Lord of Shadows.
