Chapter 1095 Reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode (3)

“What is that thing!”

Everyone in Falling Sky Valley was appalled by the situation as they looked in disbelief. An eye that was actually as huge as the moon appeared in the sky by itself?! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s still here…”

Ye Qingtang looked at that blood-colored eye with a frown and sighed softly.

The Dimension Wall was the extraordinary lady’s last protection for this mainland. A portion of it was already broken previously and currently…

As the Dimension Wall was completely broken, the ancient clan of that extraordinary lady might have found this place already.

Ten thousand years ago, the extraordinary lady almost became a God and possessed powers that surpassed the scope of this world. Similarly, that ancient clan was extremely powerful ten thousand years ago as well.

However, ten thousand years later today, the martial culture was backward and could not be compared to its initial years, and that ancient clan no longer had any Gods.

Yet, now that this mainland’s Dimension Wall was broken, they naturally desired to take the extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode away as it could raise the powers of their entire ancient clan by more than ten times…

A thousand miles away from this mainland.

Thousands of battleships above an ancient river were set on sail towards the mainland

Enormous demonic beasts pulled countless huge carriages in the air and led the battleships.

“Ha… Finally found it…”

A fuzzy voice sounded in the air.

“The energy source of the Spiritual Abode turned into a baby girl… We just need to… obtain the baby girl and destroy the entire mainland.”

“We also need to be careful. That mainland was once cursed by You Yun… Its spirit energy is extremely thin. When we reach that mainland, our martial skill will also be suppressed to the peak of the Yang Lord realm.”

“Haha… That is why this will be an interesting war…”

In Falling Sky Valley, Ye Qingtang wore a serious expression.

This day still came in the end…

An unprecedented calamity would eventually befall on this mainland.

At this instant, the Peerless School wardens who were previously killed and then revived by Demon Lord Luo Xue looked at the blood-colored eye in the sky. Seeming to sense something, their expression changed instantly, and they left with the Peerless School disciples.

On the other hand, the Falling Sky Valley masses were in a panic.

In the next few days, there was no longer any movement in that huge tree.

However, the baby boy and the baby girl grew rapidly at an observable speed.

In a few days, the two babies who were just newborns had already grown into children that were two to three years old.

The unusual phenomenon in the sky created a paranoid atmosphere.

Perfected Xuanchen gave an order that forbade anyone from going near the giant tree and the two babies.

Ye Qingtang was the only exception.In the deep night, Ye Qingtang stood beside the giant tree and inspected the young boy and girl.

“E-I…”

The boy’s clear eyes made eye contact with Ye Qingtang, and he subsequently stretched his hands out towards Ye Qingtang.

As she looked at the tiny hands that were stretched out towards herself, a warm smile spread across Ye Qingtang’s face. She slowly walked forward and held the boy’s hands gently.

The girl opened her beautiful, bright eyes and looked at Ye Qingtang and the boy curiously.

However, Ye Qingtang shuddered the moment she touched the boy, and the aura of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven instantly rushed into Ye Qingtang’s brain.

“This is…”

After sensing a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven force, a strange sentiment struck Ye Qingtang
