1600 Kingdom Fortress 3

The King was not concerned about Ye Qingtang’s abilities. He gave her the title of Kingdom Knight firstly because she had made a contribution to the war, and secondly to motivate other warriors in the kingdom. This signaled to them that if they were willing to contribute their strength to the Kingdom, the Kingdom would reward their loyalty.The King gestured for Ye Qingtang to pin the Kingdom Knight badge on herself. When she pinned on the badge, her keen senses perceived the unhappy looks from the other Kingdom Knights.

“Alright, you may leave. If you need anything, you can discuss it with the others.” After the King finished dealing with this matter, his focus returned to the battlefield before him.

Ye Qingtang and the vice-general exited the hall. The other Kingdom Knights also left the hall.

“Knight Tang, General Mark would be delighted to know that you’ve become a Kingdom Knight,” the vice-general said to Ye Qingtang with a smile.

Ye Qingtang laughed. “It’s all thanks to General Mark that I had an opportunity to serve the Kingdom.

The vice-general was about to say something when a slightly mocking voice suddenly rang in their ears. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Serve the Kingdom? Knight Tang says it so casually.”

The voice was now clearly dripping with sarcasm.

Ye Qingtang raised her head slightly and saw that the Kingdom Knights who were in the hall earlier were now blocking their way.

Each one of the dozen Knights was tall and imposing. Under the weight of their armor, they looked even more impressive. Compared to their tall physiques, the petite Ye Qingtang looked to be no more than a teenager. She did not even come up to their chests.

“Knight Tang, how old are you? Fourteen?” A golden-haired, blue-eyed Kingdom Knight dismissively gave her the once over. His eyes were filled with disdain.

“Looking at your size, I bet you can’t even handle a sword. How can you speak of serving the Kingdom on the battlefield?”

“Please, your words are too harsh.” A brown-haired rider shook his head in disagreement. “Tang is still young. How can she enter the battlefield? She can remain in the fortress with the cooks to prepare our meals so that we have more strength to kill on the battlefield. Isn’t that also a way of serving the kingdom?”

The brown-haired knight seemed to be speaking up for Ye Qingtang, but his words were even more jarring.

When they were in the hall just now, they were incredulous when they saw the King making Ye Qingtang a Kingdom Knight.

Did people know what a Kingdom Knight was? It was the ultimate symbol of knighthood!

These men who had become Kingdom Knights were proud of their titles. They were an example to all knights. They had absolute power. They had acquired the much-coveted title of Kingdom Knight after loyally serving the kingdom for many years, battling enemies with all their might, and making numerous contributions.

But now...

This weak young girl had actually acquired the same title. This was a huge insult to them!

Ye Qingtang’s existence besmirched the title of Kingdom Knight.

Ye Qingtang looked expressionlessly at the Kingdom Knights, whose eyes were filled with hostility. She could clearly sense the displeasure radiating from them. This sensation was already present in the hall.
