Chapter 2642 Saint Ye Yue (3)

“Yue’er, in the realm of martial arts, you have to be calm and steady. You must not be impatient. Remember, haste does not always bring success. It is already a miracle for you to break through from the Worldly Emperor level to the Illusory Emperor level in such a short period of time. Many powerful figures with astonishing talents remained stuck at the Worldly Emperor level for their entire lives. Even until their deaths, they did not manage to even reach the threshold of the Illusory level. Back then, even I had to spend 18 years to merely break through from the Worldly level to the Illusory Emperor level,” the Nine Heavens Saint advised Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded and said, “Master, you are right. I am too anxious.”

“Yue’er, since you’ve come out of seclusion this time, you should make a trip to the outside world,” the Nine Heavens Saint continued after a while.

Ye Qingtang was confused by the Nine Heavens Saint’s words. Why did he suddenly ask her to leave the Great Immortal Temple to wander around the outside world…

As if seeing Ye Qingtang’s confusion, the Nine Heavens Saint stroked his white beard and said, “It’s about the legacy of the Fourth Domain.”

“The Fourth Domain?!”

Ye Qingtang was astounded. In this era, the legacy of the Fourth Domain had actually been activated?! “That’s right.” The Nine Heavens Saint chuckled. “The world is in chaos. The opening of the legacy of the Fourth Domain will alarm countless powerful figures in the world. How can my Great Immortal Temple not join in the fun? You are my most beloved disciple, so you must represent me to take a look. If you are fated, you might even be able to enjoy a share of the benefits.”

“Then, is Master not going?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

Regarding this, the Nine Heavens Saint shook his head and seemed to look rather resigned. “Yue’er, Master has his own mission. Do you know what kind of demonic creatures are suppressed by this Great Immortal Temple? If Master leaves, the consequences will be unimaginable.”

“I see.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Actually, Ye Qingtang also knew some rumors about the Great Immortal Temple.

It was rumored that the Great Immortal Temple was formed by some monks tens of thousands of years ago. The purpose of the Great Immortal Temple was to suppress all evil in the world. Deep underground beneath the Great Immortal Temple were the devils sealed by those supreme monks from tens of thousands of years ago.

In the following generations, no matter how the times changed, the Great Immortal Temple remained the same. The strongest saints worked together to maintain the forbidden array formation, using it to continue suppressing the evil of the world.

This was the reason why the Nine Heavens Saint could not leave the Great Immortal Temple. “Master, I understand. When should I set off?” Ye Qingtang asked the Nine Heavens Saint.

“You just came out of seclusion. Before this, several teams of people from the Great Immortal Temple have already left for the transit station between the Divine Venerate Domain and the Fourth Domain. It is probably already time to leave. I will leave it up to you to decide when to set off. However, I advise you to leave as soon as possible so as to avoid missing out on any fortuitous opportunities,” the Nine Heavens Saint advised Ye Qingtang.

“Master, I understand.”

With that, Ye Qingtang turned and left.

Two days later, Ye Qingtang finished her preparations and stabilized her cultivation level at the Illusory Emperor stage. She then left the Great Immortal Temple and flew towards the transit station between the Divine Venerate Domain and the Fourth Domain.
