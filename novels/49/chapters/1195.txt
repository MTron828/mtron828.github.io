Chapter 1196: Occupied (4)

...

“Release!”

...

“Release!”

Elder Bai Kui shouted repeatedly. The specially constructed arrows fell in waves on the Ancient You Clan.

Ye Qingtang had used up all the ancient meteoric iron but had only made enough arrows for three waves of attacks.

However, these three waves of attacks had already caused the main force of the Ancient You Clan to sustain heavy losses.

The southern super sect forces were pushed to the front line by the Ancient You Clan and were completely wiped out. Even one-third of the Ancient You Clan’s main forces were killed or injured.

“Humph!”

After a moment, You Tong grunted coldly and used the power of a Heavenly Venerate to protect the main forces.

If You Tong had not shielded them with the power of a Heavenly Venerate, the casualties in the main forces would have been even greater.

When she saw that they had used up all the arrows, Ye Qingtang waved her arms slightly.

“Roar!”

Little white tiger instantly grew bigger and led Ye Qingtang to charge out of Heaven City.

The advantages of Heaven City were almost non-existent when faced with the southern battlefield’s main forces. You Tong could easily use his Heavenly Venerate power to destroy Heaven City or lay siege to the city, thus turning the advantage to himself.

“Kill!”

Elder Bai Kui, Valley Master Xuanchen, and dozens of Yang Lords led the charge. They leaped off the city wall to land outside the city and then charged towards the main force of the Ancient You Clan.

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Hundreds of Ye Family disciples followed, their faces grim and determined.

At that moment, a roar rang out in front of them. The vanguard of the Ancient You Clan held black-grade weapons and tried to surround Ye Qingtang.

“Roar!”

The white tiger, which had enlarged itself, bellowed in rage. The demonic aura of a Fiendcelestial was transformed into gusts of wind that forced the powerful cultivators of the Ancient You Clan to retreat.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang drew her black-grade divine weapon and brandished it as she advanced.

The Heavenly Demon Bloodline and the Divine Phoenix Bloodline were forced to their peaks. She was completely covered by a black aura and a golden glow. It was as if a god of the Ninth Heaven had arrived on earth.

Every time Ye Qingtang waved the black-grade divine weapon in her hand, it took a life.

Fortunately, most of the powerful cultivators in the main forces were still poisoned, and most of their martial capabilities were only at the Sixth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord as they had not yet recovered to the stage of a Yang Lord.

Otherwise, there was no need to even fight this battle.

In an instant, the thousands of men from this mainland and the Ancient You Clan violently collided like meteorites that had left their obits, howling wildly like the wind. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

However, after a few skirmishes, the Ye Family disciples started to fall back. Although most of the Ye Family disciples were on par with the powerful cultivators of the Ancient You Clan who had not yet recovered their full abilities, their martial arts cultivation level was still far inferior to that of the powerful cultivators of the Ancient You Clan.

When they saw that, the twelve peaks divided into two forces. One force continued to hold up the main forces while the other joined the Ye Family disciples’ formation to relieve the pressure on the Ye Family disciples.

“They would really rather die than surrender.” Before long, the green-robed man, You Tong, transformed into a ray of light and rushed at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang immediately extricated herself from the battlefield. She leaped from the little white tiger’s back, and her slender figure was soon embroiled in a fight with You Tong.

“Roar!” The demonic beast that You Tong was riding shot a beam of destructive light from its mouth. But before it reached Ye Qingtang, the white tiger sent it flying with a head butt.

The Little White Tiger and You Tong’s demonic beast were soon fighting.
