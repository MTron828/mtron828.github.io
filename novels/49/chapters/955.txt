Chapter 956 Return to Lin Town (7)

Ye Qingtang quickly took out a jet-black bronze longbow from her space ring. She placed them in Master Si’s hand, together with a few dozen black arrows.

At that moment, Master Si was still staring at the dozens of scarlet immortal elixirs in the bottle when he felt something ice-cold in his right hand. He subconsciously glanced downward and studied the black bronze longbow in his hand.

“Premium yellow-grade bronze arrow… and premium yellow-grade bronze arrows…”

At that moment, Master Si was completely stunned.

Master Si loved hunting, and among the various weapons, he was especially skilled at archery. He had a collection of a few dozen longbows in his house.

However, very few cultivators in the secular world could use the bow, and similarly, few were trained in archery. It was rare to see a longbow of slightly higher quality. Even among the sects, a yellow-grade longbow seldom appeared, and a premium yellow-grade longbow made of bronze was unheard of.

Among the longbows, those made of bronze were the rarest. Besides the bronze longbow, there were also a few dozen arrows, all made of bronze. Each bronze arrow was of premium yellow-grade level and could be used repeatedly.

“Tang Tang… this…”

Master Si looked at Ye Qingtang in shock and disbelief.

It was impossible to estimate the value of a premium yellow-grade bronze longbow, and with a few dozen premium arrows included…

“Grandfather Si, I know you are especially skilled in archery and have collected many bows in your home. I especially looked for this bow for you. The arrows have an aura of frost and are fairly powerful. Even a Martial Level Three cultivator will be instantly frozen if he comes into contact with the aura of frost,” Ye Qingtang said.

In this mainland, there were very few cultivators who were versed in archery. Master Si had been an expert marksman when he was young. Now, with this premium yellow-grade bronze bow and arrow, he would be fairly formidable.

“Tang Tang, these things are just too valuable. If you have no use for them, give them to your father. Right now, your Ye Family urgently needs these things…” Master Si said hurriedly.

Although Master Si did not know where Ye Qingtang had found these startling treasures, if Ye Qingtang did not mention it, then Master Si also would not pursue the matter.

“No need.” Ye Qingtang immediately shook her head. “Grandfather Si, I have many other items like that, and the Ye Family can’t possibly use them all. You should just accept them. Unless you don’t like them?”

“Don’t like?”

Master Si and Si Ye were both stunned. They had never seen treasures of this grade in their lives. They would love to sleep next to them. How could they not like them?

“Tang Tang, do you really want to give this to Grandfather?” Master Si looked shocked.

Even the current Long Family probably had nothing like that…

“Of course.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Tang Tang… thank you.” Master Si saw that Ye Qingtang was determined and did not refuse further. He could not bear to let go of the bottle of scarlet elixirs and the bow and arrows. To him, they were like precious treasures.

“Grandfather Si, these elixirs are enough for your skills to break through to the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord stage within half a year. At that time, you will be a force to reckon with when you use this bow” Ye Qingtang said laughingly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m
