Chapter 1682: One Wave After Another (2)

Just as the few of them were arguing over this, the door to the room was kicked open with a bang! Baili Xuanyun was standing there aggressively, with the youths from the two families in tow.

“Ye Qingtang, our previous bet has not ended yet. If you don’t challenge me in the next competition, I will send my men to take good care of your Jiang family disciples everyday.” Baili Xuanyun declared as he stared at Ye Qingtang.

Previously, Baili Xuanyun was not that interested in sparring with Ye Qingtang. But now that he wanted to help avenge Mu Ruxue, things were different. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Baili Xuanyun, how can you go back on your word? Brother Yun has already agreed to the terms of your bet. How dare you come charging at us now. What do you want?” Jiang Yiran stood up angrily. This entire situation was such a troublesome mess.

Baili Xuanyun raised his brows and smiled. “You’ve got to be kidding me. I already told you. I want Ye Qingtang to challenge me and I will only give up when I win. As for Jiang Yanyun, I was just giving him a chance to challenge me. Did I ever say that there’s no need for Ye Qingtang to challenge me once Jiang Yanyun did it?”

It was true that Baili Xuanyun hadn’t made things clear then and didn’t use precise language. His self-righteous tone was aggravating. Looking at Baili Xuanyun’s current attitude, even if he had made any prior promises, he would probably not admit it either.

Ye Qingtang’s capabilities had indeed surpassed Jiang Yiran and everyone’s expectations. But this didn’t mean Ye Qingtang had the ability to challenge Baili Xuanyun.

It must be pointed out that in the previous Martial Arts Championship several years ago, Baili Xuanyun’s powers had already reached the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm. How could Ye Qingtang possibly fight against that?

“It doesn’t matter even if you don’t agree. But I would advise the Jiang family members to not leave their residence over the next few weeks. After all, the Jiang family folks are so cowardly that they are an eyesore. Don’t blame us if we beat them up because they have irritated us.” Baili Xuanyun was determined to force Ye Qingtang to fight him and his words dripped with provocation.

“We are not afraid of you! Go ahead and try to beat us up if you dare!” Jiang Yisheng was enraged.

Baili Xuanyun was clearly trying to seek revenge for Mu Ruxue.

In response, Baili Xuanyun only smiled as he cast a sweeping glance at those bruised and battered Jiang family youths.

Those youths were not on close terms with Ye Qingtang at all. They were only good with Jiang Yiran. Having already been beaten up for no good reason, their faces turned even more grim after hearing Baili Xuanyun’s threat.

This was clearly Ye Qingtang’s own problem. Why did they have to suffer along with him?

“You are truly loyal. But can you speak for everyone in the Jiang family?” Baili Xuanyun smiled.

Jiang Yisheng was about to speak but noticed the unhappy faces of those Jiang family youths. He immediately halted his tongue.

They wouldn’t be so concerned if it was just the Baili Clan looking for trouble. Their numbers were comparable and they could stand their ground in a brawl.

But now that Mu family had also joined the fray, it was difficult for the Jiang family to face these two families together.

Also...

The Mu family had the high-ranking Mu Feiruo, while the Baili Clan had the demonically-talented top dog Baili Xi. If those two decided to fight, the Jiang family would definitely lose terribly, even with Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai on their side.
