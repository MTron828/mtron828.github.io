Chapter 874 Frightening Skills

Li Bingxue shuddered upon witnessing the sight, and a trace of fear finally emerged on her exquisite face.

Perfected Gu Yun’s skills were too powerful, and even if they joined forces, they still had no chance of winning. This match would definitely end with their death…

From the moment they decided to attack Perfected Gu Yun, perhaps their outcome was already decided!

The miserable cries persisted, and Gu Tianhe’s body seemed to be about to be torn into pieces.

“How’s it? This isn’t a good feeling, isn’t it?” Perfected Gu Yun scoffed. “However, don’t be afraid, I will not let you die so easily. I will let you enjoy this painful process well.”

From aside, there were still blood stains on the corners Li Bingxue’s lips as despair filled her heart.

“Kill me… Quickly… kill me!” Gu Tianhe could no longer bear this pain and was only thinking of seeking death.

“I will… fight it out with you!” At this instant, an icy aura exploded from Feng Wudang, who was previously hurled away by Perfected Gu Yun, and he flew to Perfected Gu Yun’s side immediately.

Hearing that, Perfected Gu Yun shot a look at Feng Wudang indifferently as a scorn hung on his lips. Then, he used his imposing manner and immediately hurled Feng Wudang away from the impact.

“Alright, I’ll send you all off. There’s no need to thank me for my compassion,” Perfected Gu Yun said, and the strength in his hands increased all of a sudden.

However…

At this moment.

Swoosh!

A deafening sound reverberated in the surroundings. It was as though it was the very first sound that exploded when the universe was first created, shaking one’s mind.

Perfected Gu Yun’s expression changed immediately when he heard the sound, and almost instinctively, he turned around to look behind immediately.

However, just as he was turning around, a black ray of light that could hardly be seen with the naked eye condensed into that of a thin thread. Its speed was extremely fast, and it appeared in Perfected Gu Yun’s sight in the blink of an eye.

Puff!

Under Li Bingxue and Feng Wudang’s shocked gaze, that black ray of light pierced through Perfected Gu Yun’s glabella in an instant.

In the next second, a mix of red and white unknown liquids gradually flowed out of the hole in Perfected Gu Yun’s pierced skull.

Perfected Gu Yun widened his eyes in disbelief. He followed the trajectory of the black ray of light and looked towards Ye Qingtang, who was standing far away.

In at most a few breaths, Perfected Gu Yun staggered, and the ground was stained into a strange, demonic red by the blood.

Boom!

Before long, Perfected Gu Yun’s body collapsed on the ground squarely. After twitching for a while, he no longer had any movement and died at the scene.

“This…”

Li Bingxue and Feng Wudang exchanged a look and instinctively looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Senior… Senior Sister Ye… is actually this powerful?!” Shock filled Feng Wudang’s face.

“Lie… It’s a lie, isn’t it! How did she do it?! That is Perfected Gu Yun…” Li Bingxue’s

mouth was agape.

Ye Qingtang was a distance away from Li Bingxue and Feng Wudang. Hence, they naturally did not know that Ye Qingtang was rubbing the plain-looking ring on her finger and thought that Ye Qingtang slaughtered Perfected Gu Yun with her own skills.

It was not just that. In a corner in the forest.

The two students from Divine Virtual Academy stared in bewilderment.

Since when did Supreme Academy produce such a scary student?!

Even that well-known Perfected Gu Yun was so easily killed by her?!
