Chapter 1942: Ancient You Clan (3)

“Aunt Qin, I know you are feeling very guilty. But now that things have progressed to this stage, we are already at the point of no return. If grandfather knows... we betrayed the Jiang family... I am afraid that...” Ye You didn’t continue.

Jiang Qin’s heart gave a heavy thump.

“I know. Ye You, go back and rest first.” Jiang Qin patted Ye You on the shoulder before turning to leave.

Ye You looked at Jiang Qin’s departing profile. A cold smile took over the subservient and worried look on her face.

In contrast, Ye Xun appeared very despondent. How could she not know how heartless Ye You was? Ye You was already like this when in the Ye family. But after personally witnessing Ye You cause the demise of the entire Jiang family without an ounce of regret, Ye Xun was now feeling increasingly frantic.

Ye Xun knew very well that Jiang Qin treated Ye You as her own daughter. But Ye You did not reciprocate the same feelings...

“Xun, come with me to find the warden of the Ancient You Clan.” Ye You suddenly spoke up after Jiang Qin left.

“Sister You, why are you seeking out the warden?” Ye Xun was surprised.

“Jiang Qin might not be able to find the Domain Monarch and the rest of the Jiang family. If this drags on, the Ancient You Clan will be very displeased with us.” Ye You narrowed her eyes.

“Sister You, you have another solution?” Ye Xun looked at Ye You.

Ye You smiled but kept silent. She just went to find the Ancient You Clan warden with Ye Xun in tow.

...

Meanwhile, quite a large number of the ancient clan members had gathered at the Temple of Shadows.

News of the Ancient You Clan being the mastermind had spread quietly across the various ancient clans. Thereafter, an increasing number of people sought protection under the temple. The eight tribe leaders were very unhappy about this. But they had no choice but to maintain their silence, as Ye Qingtang didn’t chase those folks off.

Ye Qingtang allowed the various clan members to stay on at the temple, but not without putting them to task.

The Temple of Shadows was very powerful but it would be even stronger with the gathered forces of the various ancient clans. Making use of the opportunity, Ye Qingtang instructed the clan leaders to discreetly make use of their connections to investigate the Ancient You Clan.

Ye Qingtang knew the reason behind the Ancient You Clan’s sudden increase in power. But she had no idea just how powerful the clan was now. She had to know—as a result, she needed to tap into the informant network of the various ancient clans. At the same time, she also hinted for the clan members to go investigate the clans who had been massacred, to see if there were any further news on them.

Especially the Domain Monarch’s Jiang Clan.

“It appears that the Ancient You Clan has no intention of attacking the Temple of Shadows in the near future.” Little White Tiger was sprawled across Ye Qingtang’s knee.

The entire Temple of Shadows had gone on high alert since the death of those two youths. But after two weeks of waiting, there was still no news of any impending attack.

“It’s only a matter of time before they come after us. From the intelligence gathered by the various ancient clans, they are still robbing others of the Spirit of Chaos fragments. They are not attacking the Temple of Shadows now as they are leaving us to the last.” Ye Qingtang was no fool. She could easily surmise the intentions of the Ancient You Clan.

As Ye Qingtang mused worriedly, there was finally some news regarding the Jiang family. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang hurried over.

“Holy Lord, the Ancient You Clan has destroyed several more ancient clans. We also found out that the Ancient You Clan is trying to seek out the whereabouts of the Domain Monarch. Several Jiang family hideouts were attacked in sequence. It looks like the Ancient You Clan has yet to obtain the Spirit of Chaos fragment belonging to the Domain Monarch.”
