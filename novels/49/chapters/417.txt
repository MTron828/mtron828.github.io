“How’s the Three Sect Competition this year?” Ye You asked slowly.

“There is quite a number of disciples at the Three Sect Competition this year. Some Wind Moon Sect disciples have pretty good endowments while there isn’t much change for Xuanling Sect. However, there’s Zhu Changge this year, whose spirit root is pretty good. If we can use his spirit root to nourish the disciples’ spirit roots, there would be a great improvement in their spirit roots,” Fu Lingtian said.

When Ye You heard the words ‘Xuanling Sect,’ her brows furrowed a little. “Xuanling Sect?”

“Yes.” Fu Lingtian nodded.

Ye You remained silent for a moment and continued. “You don’t need to touch Xuanling Sect’s Zhu Changge. There’s someone who will deal with it. Your main goal is the disciples of Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect.”

Fu Lingtian replied. “I understand. I will definitely settle everything properly.”

“It is naturally best that you can understand. Back then, Yunxiao Sect secretly allowed someone to recommend you into Qinglin Sect in order for you to search for outstanding spirit roots in Qinglin Sect and snatch them to nourish your own skills. You have entered Qinglin Sect for many years. How’re your skills now?” Ye You asked. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Fu Lingtian replied. “I have already advanced to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two a month ago.”

Ye You nodded slightly. “You can spar with Qinglin Sect elders with your current abilities. Although it isn’t bad…” Then, her thread of discourse changed, and her eyes sharpened,

“However, you must remember that no matter whether you’re in Qinglin Sect or this Three Sect Competition, you must not reveal your Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two skills. Otherwise, it would arouse suspicion once someone sensed that your skills exceed that of ordinary disciples. If Yunxiao Sect is dragged into this and the sect’s glory is tarnished, the sect will definitely let you off.”

There was cold sweat on Fu Lingtian’s forehead, and he said immediately, “I know. I will definitely not reveal my skills. In this Three Sect Competition, I will suppress my skills to below Martial Qi Level Two on purpose and not arouse any suspicion.”

Fu Lingtian had entered the sect way longer than Ye You, but at this moment, he was extremely pressured by Ye You, who only entered Yunxiao Sect for half a year.

How could he be compared to someone who could advance from Connate Level Nine to First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three in just half a year?

No wonder the Sect Master of Yunxiao Sect would think so highly of Ye You.

“That would be the best.” Ye You finally hid the coldness in her eyes and turned her head slightly to look at the man in the black robe beside her. “Elder Qu, seizing spirit roots is your Blood Moon Sect’s skill. Fu Lingtian has been in Qinglin Sect for many years and has secretly seized many Qinglin Sect disciples’ spirit roots. Can you take a look at how his spirit root is currently?”

The man in the black robe nodded slightly. He walked forward and suddenly raised a hand, and a black fog shrouded over Fu Lingtian. After a moment, he kept the fog and took a step back. “His spirit root is very stable from the nourishment. I believe it will improve in no time.”

Ye You nodded and turned to look at Fu Lingtian. “You must know your limits for the Three Sect Competition this time. After this, you should become an elite disciple of Qinglin Sect. Most of the elite disciples in Qinglin Sect are green spirit roots. By then, you will have even better resources. You still need to work hard. Do not let down Yunxiao Sect’s effort in training you.”

“Yes! Fu Lingtian will definitely not let down the sect’s expectation.” Fu Lingtian declared loyally.
