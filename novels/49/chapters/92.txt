Chapter 93: Xuanling Sect (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Those are people from the Liu Yun family clan?” Si Ye’s eyes swept over a group of people not far away.

The Liu Yun family clan is renowned worldwide, and the cultivators produced from this family clan were all deeply powerful. Family clans like the Si and Ye family seemed especially tiny before ones like Liu Yun’s.

Ye Qingtang followed Si Ye’s gaze, and as expected, she saw a group of finely-dressed people with elegant demeanors.

Leading the group of people was a tall middle-aged man with an extraordinary bearing, and he was quietly talking to a young man. When Ye Qingtang’s gaze fell on the male who listened with lowered eyes, something shone in her eyes uncontrollably.

[ Qingtang! Quickly leave! ]

On a stormy night, that handsome youth stood in front of her with his flesh and blood, bearing a fatal blow.

“Senior Brother Yun…” Ye Qingtang mumbled softly as she looked at the side profile of the youth.

“Qingtang, do you know the people from the Liu Yun family clan?” Si Ye seemed to have sensed Ye Qingtang’s abnormal behavior and could not help but ask. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ye Qingtang returned to her senses and shook her head immediately.

It was she who owed him.

In her previous life when Ye Qingtang entered the Xuanling Sect, she experienced difficulty in learning anything due to the absence of spirit root and was, thus, ridiculed by some senior and junior brothers. More than that, she was bullied for not having a family clan background. The only person in Xuanling Sect who treated her well was Senior Brother Yun, Yun Shu.

But ultimately…

Yun Shu died for her, but she did not even have the ability to seek revenge for him.

The only warmth in her previous life was slashed away hard on that stormy night.

Si Ye did not think much into it and was slightly shocked as he looked at the crowd.

He had always known that it was hard to enter a Sect but never expected that despite so, there were even the Formidable Heavens Royals here apart from the Liu Yun family clan. Every candidate participating in the entrance assessment had extraordinary backgrounds such that any random person picked out would have a glorious background.

And only people with such a social status would attract a mighty figure to recommend them.

“Big brother Si, there’s still a while more until the assessment. You don’t need to accompany me. Do head back first,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

Si Ye originally wanted to stay and accompany Ye Qingtang, but on second thought, if Ye Qingtang failed, she may be embarrassed to face him. Thus, he gave a few orders and descended the mountain without saying anything more, deciding to wait a while more in the carriage at the bottom of the mountain.

Once Si Ye left, Ye Qingtang stood at the summit alone. Her small frame and outstanding appearance attracted much attention.

However, the reactions she got were less of shock and more of mockery.

“Who is that girl? She can’t be here to participate in the sect assessment also?”

“Doesn’t look like it. All the candidates for the sect assessment today were escorted by many people from their family and had the company of a powerful person who recommended them. Just now, I saw that there was only one young man beside that girl, and he had left. It doesn’t seem like they’re here for the assessment.”

“Perhaps, she’s here to see the world. After all, this Path to Heaven cannot be traversed by normal people.”

The people who came today had extremely high expectations and could see that Ye Qingtang’s lone self was a misfit in this bustling and flourishing age.

Ye Qingtang was not at all bothered by those discussions and stood there calmly as she eyed the cloudy horizon.

In the previous life, she waited for the Path to Heaven—the path leading to the sect—to open by herself just like this.

Ridicule and coldness—she had long suffered them in her previous life. How would it still bother her in this life?
