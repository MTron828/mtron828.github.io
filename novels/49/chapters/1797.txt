“I say, you are really daring. You gave the Deity Ocean to that weakling... what can she do? She has probably already died in there.” Ba sighed. His words were stinging but his tone was also somewhat regretful.

He was feeling regretful over the loss of that beautiful human skin. Not the death of that weakling! Pffft!

He might be thinking that, but his chest constricted when the image of Ye Qingtang’s face surfaced in his mind.

Hu also looked rather grim. He was well aware of how risky his action had been, but he had no choice. He would never have been able to shake off the big three’s pursuit. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Just as Ba and Hu were lamenting over the situation, the fiendish demon guarding the camp suddenly cried out.

“It’s Qing! Qing is back!!! Hu! Qing is back!” An excited voice echoed across the eastern demon camp.

The faces of Hu and Ba froze, before they immediately sprang up.

“Go and tell the Great General now!” Hu told Ba.

Ba immediately went to deliver the news as Hu hurried to the entrance. The fiendish demons in the eastern camp had surrounded Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang had escaped from death. The crowd of demons who usually ignored her were suddenly full of excitement and high spirits to see her. They cheered and waved and gave her a hero’s welcome. Ye Qingtang was very shocked.

“Qing, you are back.” Hu squeezed his way through. His anxious heart finally relaxed upon seeing her.

“Mmm.” Ye Qingtang nodded. She also heaved a sigh of relief after seeing Hu.

Hu was pretty good to her. He usually looked out for her and she had been very worried that Hu had died in the sealed space.

“It’s good that you are back.” Hu smiled sincerely.

Those little fiendish demons who usually hung around Ye Qingtang couldn’t help sniffling when they saw her return safe and sound.

“Great Sage, you are finally back.”

Just as the crowd of fiendish demons surrounded Ye Qingtang, the eastern Great General also came over. His eyes lit up with delight when he saw her.

Hu had already told him everything that had happened. He knew that Ye Qingtang was the last person to have held the Deity Ocean.

Amidst all that commotion, the eastern Great General suddenly raised his hand. “Quiet”.

The noisy fiendish demons immediately quietened down.

“Ba, make arrangements to enhance the security of our camp. Strengthen our nearby barricades and send out some scouts to see if there are demons from other camps in the vicinity. Return immediately if there is any news. All of you listen carefully now. None of you is allowed to spread the news that Qing is back. I will kill anyone who leaks this information!”

The eastern Great General glared sternly at all the fiendish demons at present. Everyone immediately nodded.

“Qing, Hu, come with me into the cave.” Not wanting to make his inquiry public, the eastern Great General summoned Ye Qingtang and Hu back into the cave.

This was the first time Ye Qingtang was stepping into this cave. It was far deeper and wider than Ye Qingtang imagined. A huge hall was carved into the interior of the cave. Several of the most powerful fiendish demons in the eastern camp were already seated inside.

The eyes of those high-ranking demons flickered when they saw Ye Qingtang. But they didn’t dare to say anything in front of the eastern Great General.

“Qing, Hu, sit down.” A rare smile appeared on the face of the eastern Great General as he looked at these two demons who had performed an outstanding service.

The eastern Great General was no fool. He knew very well the standard of Ye Qingtang’s abilities. As a result, he knew that she had only made it back alive because the Deity Ocean enhanced her powers.

“Qing, did other fiendish demons manage to steal the Deity Ocean away?” The eastern Great General sat down and got straight to the point.

The moment the eastern Great General spoke, all the demons at present turned to look at Ye Qingtang. The anxiety on their faces was palpable.

After all, the Deity Ocean was just too important to the entire camp.
