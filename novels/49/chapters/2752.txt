Chapter 2753: Tian (2)

“Heaven’s Will, Reincarnation!”

Ye Qingtang raised her right arm and grabbed at the air.

Crash!

Everything in Ye Qingtang’s grasp shattered like glass and ceased to exist.

“To think that you were able to comprehend the power of the Heavenly Dao within a short period of time after absorbing the main body’s power… Your potential is indeed stronger than my sister’s,” the old man said as he stared at Ye Qingtang.

Back then, in the Fourth Domain, he had relied on sneak attacks to kill his sister.

“Unfortunately, although you’ve absorbed the power of the Heavenly Dao from your original body, it will still take some time before you can completely digest it… Meanwhile, I will take away all your power,” the old man said with a smile.

“You’ll only know after you try.” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled into a sneer before she leaped into battle with the old man.

From the Fourth Domain to the First Domain, and then back to the Fourth Domain.

...

In the blink of an eye, more than half a month had passed.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. She had to admit that the God of Nature’s abilities had exceeded her imagination.

“It’s over!”

......

The God of Nature’s voice rang out from the void.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang raised her hand and slashed behind her. In the next second, the old man’s head was chopped off by Ye Qingtang.

However, not long after, a new head appeared on the old man’s head. He was not injured at all. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Imperishable and indestructible…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the God of Nature thoughtfully.

“Hahaha, that’s right. I already have an imperishable and indestructible body. Apart from my sister’s Burning Heaven Flames, there’s no other existence in this world that can kill me.” The God of Nature laughed.

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought.

No wonder the God of Nature was so afraid of his sister. It was because she had a way to kill him.

“Therefore, no matter how strong you are, you won’t be able to kill me. Everything has already been decided.” The old man smiled.

“Domain, Heavenly Dao Realm.”

At this moment, all the experts of the Third Domain were gathered outside the Great Immortal Temple.

The battle had lasted for more than half a month, shocking the world.

“Go and help Sister Ye Yue.”

Feng Jiuyou said expressionlessly.

However, they were stopped by the big yellow dog. “This battle has nothing to do with you. Besides, if you go, you will only be a burden to that little girl.”

Although the big yellow dog’s words were harsh, everyone knew it was the truth. This level of battle was already far beyond what they could participate in.

Whether it was the residual power of Ye Qingtang’s sword attack or the old man’s divine power, it could easily wipe out their souls.

This was no longer mortal… no, even immortals and gods could only watch from afar.

This was a battle equivalent to the Heavenly Dao.

“Look.”

Suddenly, an Immortal Emperor looked up in shock.

At that moment, everyone saw a giant emerging from the clouds like a True God!

The face of that creature was exactly the same as Ye Qingtang’s.

“That little girl is really extraordinary. She actually transformed into the reincarnation of the Heavenly Dao… if she is given more time… I believe she won’t be inferior to Shi Tian.” The big yellow dog seemed to be in deep thought.

The giant god that Ye Qingtang had transformed into stretched out its palm from the clouds and pressed downwards.

In an instant, the entire Divine Venerate Domain seemed to be trembling violently.

During the period when Ye Qingtang transformed into the giant god, the God of Nature was smashed into meat paste hundreds of times. However, he recovered each time, imperishable and indestructible.
