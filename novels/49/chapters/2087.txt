Chapter 2088: Clone (1)

Ye Qingtang wanted to speak but realized that she couldn’t move a single muscle. The gold chain around her was completely restraining her entire body. Although she was conscious, she couldn’t move or speak and felt just like a statue.

“You’re already tired?” The middle-aged man retracted his gaze and looked at the boy.

The boy said respectfully, “Yes. I tested her strength when I found her, and it is inferior.”

The ‘inferior’ Ye Qingtang was lost for words.

Of course, no one cared about her opinion. The boy continued, “But I didn’t know how to handle it, so I could only ask you for help.”

The middle-aged man nodded slightly.

“Elder, is she really the one who separated from the Holy Lord?” The boy looked at Ye Qingtang as he asked the middle-aged man.

The Elder nodded and said, “You’re right. Many people look similar to each other in this world but none that look exactly the same.”

“No matter how alike people may appear to each other, their figure, features, and bone structure will all have some slight differences. They wouldn’t be exactly the same, even if they tried to alter themselves.”

They could always change their appearance but not their bone structure.

The Elder had already taken a look at her bones when she was bound by the golden chain and had confirmed that it was exactly the same. For someone to be identical to this degree, they could only be only the person themselves, or a clone.

“We’ve been looking for this clone all these years. Who would’ve thought that she had hidden in the First Domain? No wonder there were no signs of her when we were searching the Second Domain. How clever of her.”

Ye Qingtang listened to their conversation silently as it surprised her.

Holy Lord?

What did he mean by a clone?

“I heard that this clone appeared in the mainland where the Crimson League was over ten thousand years ago. After that, she gathered a group of Undead Clan members and built the Temple of Shadows. But she suddenly shifted everything to the First Mainland after the Temple of Shadows was built...” The boy repeated everything he had heard from Mi.

As Ye Qingtang listened in on their conversation, she started picking up on some hints.

It seemed that these two people had come from a strong power in the Second Domain. They were powerful enough to suppress the Crimson League and the Heavenly Wolf Sect easily.

And the one leading this power was the Holy Lord they were speaking of.

A long time ago, their Holy Lord of Shadows had an accident which created a clone. The clone had escaped amid all the chaos to another mainland and created the Temple of Shadows in secret.

Did that mean that...

The Holy Lord of Shadows was a clone?

She was shocked by this news. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The mighty Holy Lord of Shadows in the First Domain was a mere clone?

How terrifying was the main body then?

She hadn’t understood why the Holy Lord of Shadows had wanted to leave the Second Domain if she was so powerful that she would be at the top even in the Second Domain.

But now she understood.

So it turned out the Holy Lord of Shadows was running away.

No wonder...

The boy had given her such a request the first time they met. He had probably already been suspicious of her identity.
