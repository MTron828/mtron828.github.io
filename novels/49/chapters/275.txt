Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhou Qu originally thought that Ye Qingtang would definitely be dead after the Blood Moon Sect Elder chased after her. Yet, unexpectedly…

Ye Qingtang was actually standing before him, well and alive.

In just a moment, Zhou Qu shouted, “Ye Qingtang, why are you still standing over there? Come and save me!”

Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground calmly and looked at the loud Zhou Qu with a faint smile.

“Ye Qingtang, why are you spacing out! You’re a coward who only knows how to escape. Kill these two zombies! If the sect knows that you ignored the safety of other senior brothers in the sect and fled on your own, you’ll definitely be expelled out of the sect!” Zhou Qu frowned deeply as he struggled while barking loudly.

However, such seemingly-upright scolding was somehow funny when it came out from his mouth.

Ye Qingtang tilted her head slightly and looked at Zhou Qu, who barked incessantly. “Zhou Qu, I did not flee on my own. Am I not here to rescue all my senior brothers now?”

Zhou Qu was slightly surprised and immediately shouted, “Then quickly get over here to save me!”

However, Ye Qingtang only looked at Zhou Qu smilingly.

Zhou Qu was going to yell again, but a figure suddenly appeared beside Ye Qingtang.

With just a look, all his previous craziness vanished immediately. All color faded from his face, and his legs wobbled when he saw the Blood Moon Sect Elder beside Ye Qingtang.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eyes fell on Zhou Qu and sized up the sect disciple before him. Then, his brows were furrowed, and dissatisfaction emerged in his eyes. He looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “The person you chose for me is him? His physical constitution is too lousy already.”

Zhou Qu was stunned.

What did that mean?

Ye Qingtang cast the Blood Moon Sect Elder a look and replied casually. “That’s him. Take it or leave it.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s lips twitched. At that instant, he did not have any room for being choosy.

As the two people talked, Zhou Qu suddenly realized something. His eyes widened, and he glared at Ye Qingtang furiously. “Ye Qingtang! You actually submitted to the Blood Moon Sect! As a sect disciple, do you even care about the sect’s honor! You’re utterly shameless!”

Zhou Qu snarled in fear and uneasiness. No one knew that if he had an option, he would rather replace Ye Qingtang’s position. As long as the Blood Moon Sect Elder did not kill him, he would be willing to do anything that the Blood Moon Sect Elder told him to!

Ye Qingtang raised a brow at Zhou Qu who was as miserable as a mad dog. She glanced at the Blood Moon Sect Elder from the corner of her eyes, and her lips curled up slightly. “Submit?”

She chuckled. “Zhou Qu, you’ve got it wrong. I am his master.”

With that, Zhou Qu was completely frozen.

While the expression of Blood Moon Sect Elder beside her darkened, considering that he could not defeat Ye Qingtang, the Elder could only force himself to forgo his face and confirmed. “That’s right. I will listen to Lord Ye’s arrangements for everything.”

“What… what even…” Zhou Qu stretched his neck out, and his entire body trembled. His popped eyes stared at the smiling Ye Qingtang. At that instant, her exquisite face was like a nightmare which devoured his soul. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Mas… master… Who… exactly are you?!” Zhou Qu panicked.

Never would he have expected that her reply would be this unimaginable.

Ye Qingtang is the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s master?

How could this be!

Zhou Qu was simply unwilling to believe everything, but the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s behavior was completely like that of a servant. There was no way Zhou Qu could deny it.
