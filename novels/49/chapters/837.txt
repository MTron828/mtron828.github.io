Chapter 838 Exposed

A while later, Ye Qingtang and Master Du witnessed that elderly crush the youth’s headless corpse without any change in his expression.

Subsequently, that elderly in a Daoist robe left a ground of blood and walked towards the underground lair.

Before long, explosion sounds blared from within the underground lair.

It was so loud and was as if it could pierce one’s eardrums.

This deafening sound persisted for an hour before stopping gradually.

A long time later, the elderly in a Daoist robe walked out from the underground lair with a cold expression. “There’s actually a Diamond Boulder blocking the way. How unlucky!”

Master Du smiled at Ye Qingtang after hearing that.

That Diamond Boulder could only be destroyed with an Extraordinary Flame or if the skills of the elderly in a Daoist robe reached the Arcane Supremacy level.

However, the spirit energy on this mainland was extremely thin, and even if that elderly was really an Arcane Supremacy, his martial level would also be suppressed to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm once he entered this mainland.

In other words, as long as that elderly did not possess an Extraordinary Flame, he would definitely be unable to destroy that Diamond Boulder on this mainland!

Ye Qingtang was also relieved then. Since the elderly in a Daoist robe could not break the Diamond Boulder, he would leave this place, and by then, she and Master Du could use the Extraordinary Flame to destroy it.

“I’m so mad. I’m really so mad. I found an entrance to the Dragon Vein after much difficulty, but it actually can’t be opened!!” The elderly in a Daoist robe yelled.

However, the moment he finished his sentence, he looked at the place where Ye Qingtang and Master Du were hiding at and said, “I’m in a bad mood. Come out quickly,

you all.”

Both Ye Qingtang and Master Du were stunned to hear that.

This elderly in a Daoist robe actually knew where both of them were?!

The two of them were actually exposed from the start…

Aware that they were exposed and that the other party’s skills were very powerful, Ye Qingtang took the lead and immediately walked out from the dark. She smiled at the elderly and said, “Greetings, Supremacy Senior.”

Rapidly, Master Du walked out from the dark as well and followed beside Ye Qingtang with a nervous expression.

“Very good. You are very tactful, unlike those three youngsters who don’t even know to respect the old and cherish the young.” The elderly in a Daoist robe nodded in satisfaction when he saw that Ye Qingtang had a good attitude.

“Supremacy Senior, just now was the first time we saw an Arcane Supremacy. Thus, we were agitated and did not dare to show ourselves. Please forgive us, Supremacy.” Ye Qingtang confessed with a smile, and her attitude was extremely humble and respectful.

“Haha… Junior, you’re very smart… If it’s on the usual days, I would definitely not argue with you… however…” At this point, a glint flashed across his eyes, and his attitude changed suddenly. “I’m in a very bad mood right now!”

As the elderly in a Daoist robe spoke, he struck Ye Qingtang with a palm. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Careful, Ye Chen!” Master Du’s expression changed immediately. He never expected that this elderly would attack Ye Qingtang so suddenly!

This elderly’s speed was seriously too fast, and compared to him, the current Ye Qingtang was no different from an ant. It would only take a moment if the elderly wanted to kill her!

Even though Ye Qingtang had a good eye and could see the action and trajectory of the elderly’s attacks, it was simply impossible for her to dodge it given her current skill level.
