“You’ve injured my son. Of course I want your life as compensation,” said Duan Yangjing coldly.

“My life?” Ye Qingtang looked at Duan Yangjing. “I’m afraid you won’t be able to take that.”

Without waiting for Duan Yangjing to reply, Ye Qingtang said without consulting anyone, “Enough nonsense. Since you want revenge, all of you should come at me at the same time.”

“What?”

Ye Qingtang’s words surprised everyone.

“Tang Tang, you mustn’t be impulsive!” Ye Ling was shocked.

The group from the Duan Family were enraged by Ye Qingtang’s arrogant words. With that, an elder from the Duan Family leaped up and struck a blow at Ye Qingtang.

“Little girl, how dare you boast!”

Ye Qingtang lifted her head slightly and saw the Duan Family elder leaping towards her. She slowly lifted her hand and met his palm with her own palm!

There was a huge bang!

When the two palms met, the crisp sound of a bone breaking could be heard from the Duan Family elder’s arm.

There was the sound of an explosion, and the shards of white bone pierced through the skin of his arm. He was instantly sent flying by the force of the impact.

But Ye Qingtang stood motionlessly at her original spot. Her upraised palm was completely unharmed.

The faint smell of blood permeated the front yard of the Ye House.

Ye Ling and the others widened their eyes in disbelief as they looked at the Duan Family Elder, who had collapsed onto the ground.

This elder was at the mid-stage of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. Outside of the Long Family, few people in the entire Lin Town was a match for him.

However…

His entire arm had been rendered useless by one blow of Ye Qingtang’s palm?

“I said, you should all come at me at the same time… don’t you understand?” Ye Qingtang looked coldly at the Duan Family elder, who had collapsed to the ground with a broken arm.

The group from the Duan Family looked in shock at the Duan Family elder who had collapsed to the ground, their eyes full of disbelief.

How could this be…

“Kill her!” Duan Yangjing bellowed.

The moment he finished speaking, the group from the Duan Family rushed forward and pounced on Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang stood motionless in her original spot, looking at the group from the Duan Family that was rushing forward. Her eyes were expressionless. As the group rushed up, she suddenly raised her eyes, which had been slightly lowered.

The moment she lifted her eyes, an intangible aura suddenly burst from her body.

Boom, boom!!

There was an ear-splitting crash. Before the men from the Duan Family even knew what was happening, the intangible force sent them flying in all directions while they were still in mid-air!

In a blink of an eye, the men from the Duan Family were scattered throughout the Ye House courtyard. Each of them spat out a mouthful of fresh blood when they landed on the ground.

Even Duan Yangjing, the most powerful of the Duan Family, who had reached the peak of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One collapsed to the ground, unable to get up. A column of blood sprayed from his mouth.

In the blink of an eye, everyone from the Duan Family had been utterly defeated.

The front yard of the Ye House was a sea of weeping and wailing.

Ye Ling and the three elders were completely stunned.

They gaped at the group from the Duan Family who had collapsed on the ground. They had no idea what had just happened.

Why had all of them collapsed onto the ground, heavily injured, when Ye Qingtang had not even moved?

Ye Qingtang shook her head blandly when she saw the men from the Duan Family, who had collapsed on the ground. Then without consulting anyone, she walked towards Duan Yangjing.

At that moment, the previously aggressive Duan Yangjing who had been baying for blood was lying on the floor, his face ashen.

“I forgot something just now.” Ye Qingtang faced Duan Yangjing. Her eyes were slightly lowered, and from her vantage point, she looked at Duan Yangjing, who had fallen to the ground.

“Your son, Duan Tianyun, said on the dais that if he lost, he would publicly kowtow to me three times,” Ye Qingtang said unhurriedly. “However, he probably can’t get up right now. In that case…”

Ye Qingtang suddenly raised her hand, caught hold of Duan Yangjing’s collar, and lifted him off the ground.

“As his father, you should do it in his stead.”
