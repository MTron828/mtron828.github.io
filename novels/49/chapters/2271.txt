Chapter 2272: Exploring The Tomb Again (2)

Inside the dazzling treasure trove, garish streaks of blood splattered all across the jewels and artifacts. Multiple corpses were strewn across those treasures which could drive a person mad.

Those highly-desired treasures had now become a burial ground for the various factions. The bodies piled up on the treasures had died wretchedly, none of them whole.

Vast amounts of fresh blood dyed those bodies a bloody red.

The vibrant red color looked exceptionally eye-catching against the dazzling treasures.

“Help! Help!”

Cries and wails echoed through the treasure trove.

A group of bloodied people was scurrying madly in all directions. Their faces were filled with shock. Gone were the initial signs of delight at discovering this treasure trove.

Ye Qingtang looked over with a grim expression. While she could see those people running wildly, she did not see anything pursuing them.

No!

Ye Qingtang suddenly realized that there seemed to be something hidden in the treasure piles behind those men. It was protruding slightly and speeding toward those men.

Something hidden within the treasure piles was quietly chasing after those greedy intruders.

Tinkle tinkle tinkle!

The clear sound of countless treasures clinking against each other rang out.

A massive black figure suddenly burst out from underneath the treasure pile. Before those men could react, that black figure had pounced upon the first few. It then burrowed back into the treasure pile and sped toward the others. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Dismembered remains were all that was left of those who had been attacked.

The bodies of those men were cut off at the waist. The top halves were missing and fresh blood gushed out from the opening at the waist. Hot blood sprayed all over like raindrops.

What was that thing?

Ye Qingtang was shocked.

When she had first stepped into the fiendcelestial’s treasure trove, she already detected something horrifying was hidden underneath the treasure piles.

But the speed of that thing had been too fast. Even Ye Qingtang could not see what it was. All she saw was a black shadow flashing by and killing those men.

Ye Qingtang noticed that those who had lost the upper halves of their bodies soon collapsed to the ground, and bloodied treasures rolling out from their pockets.

Treasures inside the fiendcelestial’s tomb should not be touched…

Indeed, greed would attract the hidden monster.

“Boom!”

A loud crash sounded out from somewhere nearby.

Ye Qingtang saw an imperious-looking elder frowning and with his hands lifted. He held no sword but his spirit energy had morphed into the shape of one as he slashed at the approaching monster.

“Emperor level practitioner?” Ye Qingtang was startled.

The elder had an extremely powerful aura, and it was apparent that he was not an ordinary cultivator. This was a true blue Emperor level practitioner!

Even in the Second Domain, an Emperor-level practitioner was an elite existence. This elder was extraordinarily powerful. One of the factions must have sent him here to explore the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

But at that moment, the elder was not at all relaxed. He even looked somewhat wretched.

The monster beneath appeared completely unharmed even after he slashed at it. Its speed didn’t decrease as it barrelled out of the treasure pile.

“Heavenly Tyrant Constitution!” The elder gave a low shout. A golden beam of light engulfed him and all the treasures near him were blown away. His body seemed to be stained by the golden light, such that his skin was now giving off a dazzling golden sheen.
