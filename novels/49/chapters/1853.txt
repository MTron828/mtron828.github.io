Chapter 1854: One More Round (3)

The fat catfish was extremely excited to hear her decision. Neither Baili Xi nor the others couldn’t stop Ye Qingtang from going for it.

Picking up the dice cup on the ground with one hand, Ye Qingtang let her other hand glide past her long hair.

The fat catfish was deadly serious and its beady eyes gleamed. It also picked up the dice cup and shook it around vigorously.

The loud sounds of dice shaking around made it difficult for Baili Xi and the rest to decipher anything.

Bam! The fat catfish slammed the dice cup on the floor and revealed a smirk. It knew that Baili Xi and the rest could hear the numbers so this time, it prevented them from hearing it.

The fat catfish then looked towards Ye Qingtang.

“It’s your turn.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the dice cup in her hand before she looked at the fat catfish.

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang shook the cup vigorously, to the point where her hands might just fly and detach from her body. She slammed the dice cup on the ground.

It seemed like she was imitating the fat catfish once again. She shook really quickly, even the fat catfish couldn’t decipher the numbers.

But even if the fat catfish couldn’t decipher from hearing it, it didn’t have anything to worry about. It was confident about its number this time. It would be nearly impossible for Ye Qingtang to win.

“Open it!” The fat catfish opened the dice cup.

There were two sixes and one five inside.

The fat catfish started laughing.

Baili Xi and the others lost all hope.

This was Ye Qingtang’s previous score, it was almost a perfect number. Unless Ye Qingtang was able to get three sixes, she would definitely lose.

But three sixes... Without using their powers, how could these amateurs even achieve that?

Ye Qingtang was taken aback once she saw the fat catfish’s number.

The fat catfish was extremely pleased with itself. It lifted its head arrogantly as it looked at Ye Qingtang.

“It’s your turn.”

At that moment, Baili Xi and the others’ gazes also landed on Ye Qingtang. With pursed lips, Ye Qingtang slowly opened the dice cup.

When the first dice appeared, Baili Xi and the others gasped, closing their eyes in despair.

It was a one...

“Haha, lass, admit defeat now. Give me your bangle.” Once the fat catfish saw the dice with one point, it was delighted. Ye Qingtang definitely had no hopes, she had lost.

Ye Qingtang’s hand froze in mid-air. Once the fat catfish saw her reaction, it walked over and grabbed Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“Stop struggling. You only have one point now, you’ve lost for sure. Hand me the bangle now, I’ve still got to...”

The fat catfish pulled Ye Qingtang’s hand and the remaining dice appeared.

Before Ye Qingtang even understood what happened, the fat catfish was dumbfounded.

Three ones?!

“How is this even possible!” The fat catfish staggered backward. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ye Qingtang was not happy with her score, looking at the dice in disgruntlement.

“I’ve lost, I only have three points.”

But the fat catfish’s eyes were able to pop out.

When Baili Xi and the others heard Ye Qingtang’s score, they opened their eyes and were elated once they saw the dice.

“Miss Ye, you didn’t lose! You won! This is... three leopards!” Mu Feiruo exclaimed. Although he didn’t know how to gamble, he’d witnessed others in the act before. He knew that with three exact dice scores, it was considered the biggest number possible!
