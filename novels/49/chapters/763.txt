Chapter 764 Inter-Disciples Learning (2)

Reminiscence filled Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she watched Ye Ningxi and Yin Qingluo.

In her previous life, her senior brothers and sisters had always joked around like that.

Everyone was so happy.

Until…

Perfected Xuanchen was forced to hand over the Valley Master position, and Falling Sky Valley encountered a calamity.

Ye Qingtang clearly remembered that in that bloody battle, the familiar figures around her fell one by one. The cheerful talk and laughter turned into cries of despair which lingered in her memories.

In this life, she would definitely not let tragedy repeat itself.

Regardless of her Master or senior brothers and sisters, she would never let anyone injure them.

Ye Ningxi and Yin Qingluo joked for a while before realizing that Ye Qingtang had not said anything from the start.

“Senior Sister Ye, you frightened Junior Brother Ye.” Yin Qingluo blamed.

Ye Ningxi put on an innocent look.

Right at that moment, a nervous-looking Admirable Sky Peak disciple rushed over hurriedly.

“Senior Sister Ye, Senior Sister Yin, Senior Brother Ye… Water Cut Peak’s Liu Mo and Blue Cloud Peak’s Li Jingwen are here.”

With that, there was a subtle change in the expressions of Ye Ningxi and Yin Qingluo, who were initially still playing around.

“Is Li Jingwen done! Why did he bring Liu Mo here today?” Yin Qingluo’s expression darkened immediately. Previously, Li Jingwen came to Admirable Sky Peak to flaunt his impressive might.

He was just punished by Ye Qingtang sometime ago, and she thought that he would be more obedient.

Who would have thought…

He just regained consciousness but was back here again?

If it was only Li Jingwen, Yin Qingluo would naturally not be scared of anything since he had already suffered defeat at Ye Qingtang’s hands.

But Liu Mo…

The smile on Ye Ningxi’s face faded away unconsciously, and her bewitching eyes narrowed.

“Li Jingwen brought Liu Mo to Admirable Sky Peak today. I’m afraid he is here with ill intentions…” Afterward, Ye Ningxi’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang immediately.

“Junior Brother Ye, if you’ve nothing on, go back to your room first.”

Ye Ningxi was not a fool. Li Jingwen was a sinister and ruthless person who bore grudges. He harbored hatred towards Ye Qingtang when he was defeated by her that day, and he probably came here with Liu Mo today to seek revenge.

Liu Mo’s skills were comparable with those of their Eldest Senior Brother, Gu Yihan.

Although Ye Qingtang triumphed over Li Jingwen completely, she might not be Liu Mo’s opponent.

In the entire Falling Sky Valley, there were not more than three disciples who could win against Liu Mo.

If Ye Qingtang and Liu Mo sparred, Ye Qingtang would probably suffer a huge loss!

However, before Ye Ningxi could signal Ye Qingtang to leave, Li Jingwen and Liu Mo walked straight to them.

Li Jingwen caught sight of Ye Qingtang at a glance, and an evil look flashed across his eyes.

Liu Mo walked over without any emotions, and he passed a nonchalant glance at Ye Qingtang and the rest. His eyes did not stop on Ye Qingtang for long, and he instead looked at Ye Ningxi’s graceful body frivolously for a long time.

Ye Qingtang’s expression darkened when she saw Liu Mo. The moment she saw Liu Mo sizing up Ye Ningxi openly, coldness flashed across her eyes. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

This Liu Mo was exactly the same as he was in her previous life.
