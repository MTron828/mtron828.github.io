With the sudden appearance of the Armored Heavenly Demon, Ye Qingtang fixed her eyes on the dark figure, scanning the surroundings to prepare herself in case she needed to escape.

But even after a while, the Armored Heavenly Demon didn’t make a move. He just stood there in front of the remains of the Cursed True God, not moving an inch, just like a statue.

“Is this fellow... a statue?” Little White Tiger sniffed at the Armored Heavenly Demon. Other than the demonic aura, it couldn’t sense any life from it.

This thing was like a deadly creature who only had an endless demonic aura.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but feel suspicious as she looked at the Armored Heavenly Demon that wasn’t moving at all. She didn’t move abruptly, but rather, got Little White Tiger to slowly advance.

Right when Little White Tiger took a step forward, the Armored Heavenly Demon suddenly moved. He raised the Blazing Flame Sword and struck towards Little White Tiger.

Whoosh! Little White Tiger leaped up in an instant.

The moment the Blazing Flame Sword hit the ground filled with the undead, it caused a huge crack right in the middle. The intense aura from the sword resulted in a charred mess of destruction in its wake. The undead as well as the huge crack were charred black.

Little White Tiger secretly swallowed its saliva as it looked at the huge crack that passed through the entire Cemetery of the True Gods.

Holy... If the sword were to land on Little White Tiger instead, its body would definitely split into two halves!

Just as Little White Tiger jumped away, the Armored Heavenly Demon suddenly stopped attacking and just held the sword tightly, standing there, not continuing its attack at all.

“What’s going on? Why isn’t he coming for us?” This was Little White Tiger’s first time witnessing such a situation. How could there be such a ‘well-behaved’ Heavenly Demon?

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes, scanning the Armored Heavenly Demon and when her eyes landed on the section where the ‘eyes’ would have been, she sensed something suspicious.

The purpose of the armor was to provide full protection, only revealing a pair of eyes. However, when she studied the eye section, there weren’t any signs of eyes in there at all.

It was pitch dark, but she could somehow sense two balls of fire in there.

“Why did you say that he’s just like a statue just now?” Ye Qingtang asked Little White Tiger.

“Though he has a strong demonic aura, I can’t sense any life from it at all. Even if he’s a Heavenly Demon, he surely would have some signs of life,” Little White Tiger explained.

Ye Qingtang was suddenly hit by an idea. Maybe...

“I think that you might be wrong.”

“What do you mean?”

“This set of armor indeed belongs to a Heavenly Demon, but... it could very well just be a set of armor,” Ye Qingtang said.

“What do you mean?” Little White Tiger repeated. It was perplexed.

“I sensed something strange earlier when he was attacking us. When he first appeared out of nowhere, he didn’t attack immediately. It was us who triggered his senses and made him feel wary. When you took one step forward, he suddenly attacked but when you got away, he stopped moving. Do you get what I mean?” Ye Qingtang explained her thoughts.

Little White Tiger was not a fool. After hearing Ye Qingtang’s explanation, its eyes lit up.

“So you’re saying that he’s just a set of armor that bears the power of the Heavenly Demon?”

“That should be it,” Ye Qingtang answered.
