Chapter 975 Do You Really Want Me To Compete? (2)

Dan Yifan was pretty talented, but his ability was one level below that of Duan Tianyun. The gap between two Heavens was a deep as a ravine. No matter how hard he struggled, it was no use. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

To continue would be like flogging a dead horse.

On the dais, Dan Yifan had forced his inner qi to flood his entire body. The burning flames spread through his body and swiftly dispelled the cold air surrounding him. His aura instantly surged!

“I won’t lose,” Dan Yifan said coldly.

But a mocking smile hung on Duan Tianyun’s lips.

When the youths from the Ye Family, who were below the dais, saw Dan Yifan’s suddenly rising aura, a trace of hope surfaced in their eyes.

“Come on, Young Master Dan!”

“We aren’t afraid of you Duans!”

The yells rose and fell.

Ye Qingtang continued standing expressionlessly at the same spot.

“Dan Yifan should retreat,” she said somewhat pityingly.

But her words were heard by the youths from the Ye Family who were standing nearby.

They looked at Ye Qingtang in wonder, but their expressions seemed to be mixed with resentment.

“Eldest Young Lady, Young Master Dan is fighting for our Ye Family. Why are you rooting for the other side!”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the youths and said, “Duan Tianyun isn’t worth rooting for. He is merely average.”

The youths from the Ye Family were so angered by Ye Qingtang’s words that they almost vomited blood. They thought that this Eldest Young Lady was just a brainless beauty, shooting off her mouth.

The group from the Ye Family was unwilling to bandy words with Ye Qingtang. Instead, their eyes were nervously fixed on Dan Yifan, who was on the dais.

Dan Yifan mobilized the inner qi in his entire body, and a huge ball of fire suddenly brewed in his chest. The next instant, the fireball exploded and crashed towards Duan Tianyun!

However…

Without batting an eyelid, Duan Tianyun pressed his palms together. When his palms separated again, the oncoming fireball was blocked by his hands.

Icy blue cold air shot out of his palms and instantly covered the burning fireball!

The fireball that had been composed of an accumulation of roaring flames was instantly frozen by Duan Tianyun’s palms into a ball of ice.

“Let me return this to you.” Duan Tianyun’s lips curved into a cold smile. Suddenly, his palms pushed the ball of ice so that it flew towards Dan Yifan!

Dan Yifan was shocked. He tried to receive the blow but was too weak.

The gigantic ice ball instantly crashed into him. There was the sound of ice cracking. Then, Dan Yifan’s entire body was sent flying by a huge impact. He landed below the dais!

A mouthful of blood instantly sprayed out of Dan Yifan’s mouth!

His chest that had been smashed by the ice ball was covered with a layer of frost. The frost visibly and rapidly spread throughout his entire body.

The youths from the Ye Family hurried over and clumsily helped Dan Yifan up.

Ye Qingtang saw the layer of frost spreading out from Dan Yifan’s chest. With the tip of her finger, she drew a golden tongue of flame and secretly flicked the flame onto Dan Yifan’s back.

The moment the flame sank into Dan Yifan’s back, the frost that was accumulating on his chest slowly melted.

But because of the surrounding chaos, no one noticed Ye Qingtang’s actions.

Duan Tianyun looked at Dan Yifan, who had collapsed on the ground. A cold smile hung from his lips. However, he was inwardly perplexed when he saw from the corner of his eye that the frost on Dan Yifan’s chest showed signs of slowly melting.
