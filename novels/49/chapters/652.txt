“I understand already.” Ye Qingtang nodded as she looked at the black-robed person.

There would never be a conclusion if one were to debate over the right and wrong on this matter.

As a loyal follower of that extraordinary lady, the black-robed person wanted to avenge her, and there was nothing wrong with this.

If it were Ye Qingtang, she might not be any better than the black-robed person.

However, from another point of view, the predecessors who schemed against the extraordinary lady were almost all dead as time passed, and the people living on this mainland presently did not do anything wrong.

Ye Qingtang’s foster father and everyone in the Ye family clan grew up in this mainland. Should they all die to return the blood debt of those damn predecessors whom they did not even know?

Who was right, and who was wrong? The right and wrong could no longer be judged.

From the black-robed person’s point of view, there was indeed nothing wrong about seeking revenge. On the other hand, there was all the more nothing wrong with Ye Qingtang wanting to protect her foster father, the Ye family clan, Xuanling Sect… and even Falling Sky Valley.

Currently, arguing about right and wrong was out of the question, and they were only fighting for their beliefs.

“Actually, I’m very curious about how you can control this mystic realm,” Ye Qingtang said.

Normally, only the owners of mystic realms could control the mystic realm, but this black-robed person was merely a follower of that extraordinary lady. How could he open this Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avincinaraka mystic realm? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Ye Qingtang.” The black-robed person shook his head and sighed. “You have too many questions… Since we are destined to be enemies, there’s nothing much to say anymore.”

“F*ck you.” All of a sudden, the little white tiger shouted at the black-robed person. “Before that extraordinary lady died, she used the Dimension Wall to protect this mainland, which shows that she does not blame those who caused her death. As the descendant of a follower, what are you blindly worried over? If you have this extra time and energy, slaughter two cows and a few lambs and rest at home while savoring some wine.”

“Shut up!” After hearing what the little white tiger said, the black-robed person was infuriated.

“F*ck you. How dare you talk so fiercely to me?!” The little white tiger revealed its pearly white, sharp teeth. “I’ll kill you!”

“Really?” The black-robed person laughed coldly. “As a Fiendcelestial Beast, why don’t you come and try?”

“F*ck you!” Provoked, the little white tiger immediately told Ye Qingtang. “Come. Put me down! If I don’t kill him today, I’ll go and eat sh*t!”

Seeing that the little white tiger was really enraged, Ye Qingtang casually threw it to the ground.

However, there was still no trace of change in the little white tiger after some time.

“Change,” Ye Qingtang said with a frown.

“Wait…” The little white tiger looked around the place and suddenly scolded loudly. “F*ck. There is an array formation bound here. The demonic aura in my body is suppressed. I can’t use it!”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the little white tiger.

“Hahaha.” The black-robed person laughed coldly. “You could only transform in the first place not because of your own powers but because of the demonic aura that you plundered from the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm. Actually, there’s no array formation. It’s just that this third level is special as it isolates the energy of the demonic aura.”

“F*ck you. I was joking with you just now…” the little white tiger said and looked at Ye Qingtang subsequently. “Oh right… I suddenly recalled that I still have some matters to settle. I’ll leave first.”

However, the moment it spoke, the little white tiger was carried into Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“Die!” The black-robed person bellowed sternly. He turned into a black shadow and skimmed towards Ye Qingtang immediately.
