Chapter 1861: The Crystal Palace (1)

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo already knew that the spirit stones the fat catfish had were nowhere near as precious as it had said.

The fat catfishes here had various methods of gambling. Even if they had learned how to tamper with the dice, they knew nothing about the other games, which meant they were losing nine times out of ten.

They would rather exchange their Dharma treasures with Ye Qingtang than lose them to the fat catfishes.

Amusement flashed across Ye Qingtang’s face as she saw them take out their Dharma treasures.

These two were pretty honest. The Dharma treasures from the Baili family and the Mu family were pretty good. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Since the two of you are so adamant, I won’t refuse then.” Ye Qingtang took out a thousand spirit stones from her cloth bag and gave them five hundred each.

To the two who had lost almost everything by then, this amount of spirit stones was more than they had ever seen.

The two of them were so grateful to see Ye Qingtang giving them the spirit stones so generously that they almost knelt to kowtow to her.

Seeing Ye Qingtang play the two honest people, the Little White Tiger shook its head silently.

Having seen how much Ye Qingtang had won from the fat catfish, the Little White Tiger knew that a thousand spirit stones were nothing to her. The Little White Tiger had not seen the fat catfish win even a single time against Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang had used her Nine Souls Ring as a wager every single time and had won every time.

And these two also thought that they had met a living buddha...

They had handed over their family’s treasures so willingly and even thanked her.

“Hm? You’ve all won enough?” At this moment, Jiang Shaobai who had not shown his face all this time came over. His eye swept over the spirit stones in Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo hands and then landed on Ye Qingtang’s bulging pockets.

“Elder Sister Qing is amazing. You won so much,” Jiang Shaobai said as he smiled. He threw a cloth bag down and sat down beside her.

“Elder Sister Qing, I didn’t win much, just eight hundred stones. I’ll keep six hundred and give two hundred to you as payment. After all, I wouldn’t have won this much if not for your spirit stones.”

With that, Jiang Shaobai stuffed part of his winnings into Ye Qingtang’s hands.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo had thought that Jiang Shaobai would be empty-handed like them but looked embarrassed when they saw his winnings.

They couldn’t even compare to this small kid.

They felt even worse when they saw how much Jiang Shaobai was giving Ye Qingtang. They had all forgotten that Ye Qingtang had given them the spirit stone they had used to start betting.

Feeling like they owed Ye Qingtang, they stuffed two more Dharma treasures into her hands before she could say anything.

They weren’t idiots. The payment wasn’t just to thank her. Given their horrible gambling skills, they would likely need her help again in the future.

The five hundred spirit stones were only enough for one day here. And who knew how long they would need to stay?

They naturally had to cling to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang praised Jiang Shaobai silently as she received more Dharma treasures without doing anything.

This little rascal was going to have a bright future.
