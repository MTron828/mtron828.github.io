Chapter 2452: Space Technique (1)

Ye Qingtang stared at the dog and was silent for a few seconds before cupping her fists. “Thank you for your time. Goodbye.”

“Sigh, where are you going?” The big yellow dog shouted hurriedly when it saw Ye Qingtang turning around to leave.

“From now on, we will part ways. Don’t follow me.” Ye Qingtang was afraid that the big yellow dog would follow her.

Initially, she thought that she had chanced upon a great savior. Now, it seemed like it was her curse instead. If she stayed with this big yellow dog for a few more days, she would probably be angered to death.

“Look, the palace is out!” Suddenly, the big yellow dog shouted.

Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks.

If she turned around now and there was no palace, it would be the equivalent of being tricked by the big yellow dog yet again. If that happened, she would probably fight it to the death.

After pondering for a moment, Ye Qingtang finally turned around. The moment Ye Qingtang turned around, she was completely stunned.

Nearby, an incomparably majestic palace had appeared out of thin air, shocking Ye Qingtang.

Almost subconsciously, Ye Qingtang looked at the palace and sized up the big yellow dog. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“What do you say now? I’m not lying to you, right? You’re too strange. It’s normal for a palace constructed from energy bodies to be unstable. How is it that you don’t even know this kind of general knowledge? You’re really an embarrassment to Shi Tian,” the big yellow dog countered as it stared at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. How many times did she have to explain herself? Who the hell was Shi Tian? She really did not know him!

Setting Shi Tian aside, she had indeed misunderstood the dog in the matter of this palace…

Ye Qingtang looked at the dog and smiled. “Dog, I was wrong. I apologize to you.”

The big yellow dog glanced at Ye Qingtang and did not say anything.

“Let’s go in first,” Ye Qingtang said eagerly.

“Wait.” The big yellow dog stopped Ye Qingtang.

“What’s wrong?” Ye Qingtang looked puzzled.

“I have to clarify something first. This palace is used to capture prey. It’s easy to enter, but difficult to come out,” the yellow dog said.

“Capture prey…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply.

“That’s right. A palace constructed from such energy bodies is generally used to capture prey. Any creature that enters it will become a part of the energy body. However, going by their aura now, your students probably haven’t been in there for long. They probably haven’t died yet,” the big yellow dog explained.

Ye Qingtang now firmly believed in whatever the big yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang remained silent. She had to think of a way. She absolutely could not just stand by and let her students die such wretched deaths.

“However, you don’t have to be afraid. A palace of this level isn’t even worth a fart in my eyes. I have divine powers. If you bring me along, the palace won’t be able to do anything to us.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. It should have told her about its divine powers earlier!

With that, Ye Qingtang no longer hesitated and immediately pushed the door open.

Just as the yellow dog had said, it was indeed very easy to enter the palace.

Ye Qingtang had just pushed open the palace door a crack when human and dog were both sucked in.

When Ye Qingtang opened her eyes again, Qin Feng, Nangong Lie, and the rest were staring at her in confusion.

After staring at Ye Qingtang a few moments longer, Lei Yan quickly looked away and said, “Damn, I’m done for. I’m really about to die. I’m hallucinating… Do you know who I just saw? I saw Boss… That’s right, Boss must be missing me too much and is here to fetch me away..”
