Chapter 2188: Alchemy (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Hadn’t Mu Ziying been struggling to even move the puppet an inch before? What had happened? Now she could even make the puppet attack?!

Mu Ziying glanced at Lei Yan. With a curl of her finger, she summoned the puppet back.

Lei Yan clutched at his throat in shock. He could still feel a slight prickly pain where the puppet touched him.

He really couldn’t tell. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Was Mu Ziying that convinced by Boss?

He couldn’t even express any doubts?

I say, Little Senior Sister, please clear your muddled brain. As much as you worship Boss, please have some sense.

How in the world would Boss know how to refine medicine?

Just as the few teenagers were muttering amongst themselves, Yun Chen led them to his alchemy lab.

The group was speechless at the sight of the small, dilapidated room. Even though they didn’t know much about the medicine faculty, they could tell that this was definitely the lousiest lab in the entire faculty.

“Come in.” Yun Chen opened the door.

All sorts of medicinal ingredients were scattered on the floor of the small lab. The cooled-down tripod was filled with charred-black ashes. The smell of burnt herbs permeated the entire room.

Ye Qingtang: “...”

Feeling somewhat awkward, Yun Chen swept the medicinal ingredients on the floor to the side.

“Teacher Ye, my success rate at cultivating medicines is very low. So... I have not had the chance to clean this tripod.”

Apart from those scattered medicinal herbs and failed elixirs, Lei Yan and the rest discovered a bottle of completed elixirs.

“You refined this? Not bad.” To lessen Yun Chen’s embarrassment, Nangong Lie took up the bottle with a smile. He opened the bottle.

Yun Chen wanted to stop him but didn’t manage to in time.

The moment Nangong Lie opened the bottle, an indescribable smell spread across the small room.

That smell...

Lei Yan nearly threw up in disgust, while Nangong Lie’s face turned green.

“Yun Chen, what do you... have inside here?”

Yun Chen cleared his throat softly. “Cypress elixir.”

Cypress elixirs were a type of medicine that could enhance one’s vital essence. One of their special characteristics was their exceptionally fragrant smell...

Nangong Lie: “...”

He had been blind to Yun Chen’s “talents”. He never knew that Yun Chen had the “ability” to create such a heaven-defying, aberrant elixir.

How was this a cypress elixir?

Even the Hundred Poison elixir probably had a better smell than this?

Nangong Lie quietly closed the bottle and retreated to the side.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang scanned the alchemy lab. Compared to her medicine cultivation environment in the wilderness in her previous life, this place was much better.

“Yun Chen, stay here. The rest of you go back and cultivate,” Ye Qingtang instructed.

Lei Yan and the rest didn’t dare to object. They obediently went back to practice. Before leaving, they all shot Yun Chen a “take care” look.

Yun Chen”...”

“Yun Chen, what herbs do you have here?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Yun Chen immediately listed them out.

The medicine faculty provided an ample supply of medicinal herbs, so much so that the other students would never be able to use up their store. But for Yun Chen, who was very adept at destroying elixirs, it was not enough.

As Ye Qingtang listened to Yun Chen, she knew that the scant herbs that he had on hand were far from enough. She didn’t waste any words but just wrote down a list of medicinal herbs. She then took an empty space ring and handed it to Yun Chen.

“Bring me back all the medicinal herbs on this list.”

Yun Chen took the list and the space ring. He scanned the list, and his heart nearly leaped out of his chest.

“Teacher... Teacher Ye, all these... you need them all?” Yun Chen was from the medicine faculty and had seen his fair share of herbs. But for the herbs which Ye Qing had listed, some of them he had only heard of before.
