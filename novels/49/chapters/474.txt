“…”

“You are the Lord of the Blood Moon Sect? Then I say I’m the Pagoda Sword Master, do you believe me?” Ye Qingtang tried not to laugh.

“No.” The man still replied coldly.

Ye Qingtang felt a headache as she stared at the imitated blood moon at the man’s glabella. How obsessed was the man towards the Blood Moon Sect? He could choose to pretend to be anyone, but he had to call himself the supreme Blood Moon Sect Lord.

Though Ye Qingtang had never met the real Blood Moon Lord, she had seen the blood moon on the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s glabella. Obviously, it was different from the one at the man’s glabella.

When the ability of a cultivator had reached a certain level, one would be able to freeze their appearance and remain in their youth forever. However, during the peak period, the Blood Moon Lord was as famous as the Pagoda Sword Master and the Ultimate Elder. Rumors said that they were dead for at least a thousand years.

“No wonder someone tried to chase and kill you.” Ye Qingtang mocked him.

It was possible that his lie was too extreme and that offended the super sects.

If Ye Qingtang also claimed that she was the Blood Moon Lord to everyone she met, people would definitely chase after her and try to murder her…

The man with silver hair did not want to argue with Ye Qingtang.

“You saved me. What do you want in return?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“What do I want?” Ye Qingtang was puzzled.

“Something in return.”

“I want one hundred superior-grade spirit stones. Do you have them?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Not now.” The man thought for a while and then shook his head.

“Then… how are you going to pay me back?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“I will accept you as my disciple,” the man with silver hair said.

“I think… that’s not necessary.” Ye Qingtang twitched her mouth. Such a young man also wanted to be her master?!

That was not paying back but taking advantage of her.

“Are you too used to lying? I become your disciple? Do you really think that you are the Blood Moon Lord?” Ye Qingtang was trying to make fun of him.

“…”

“How about this… Since you were also fleeing from murder and so did I… shall we become sworn brothers?” Ye Qingtang smiled and said.

“Brothers?” The man frowned as he had never imagined that someone dared to pledge brotherhood with him.

“I was taking care of you for the past few days. So, I’m the older sister, and you will be the younger brother.” Ye Qingtang’s face was extremely serious.

“…”

It seemed that he had not agreed to pledge brotherhood with the girl.

“What? Just now you still said that you want to pay me back. Since you don’t have a hundred superior-grade spirit stones and you’re not willing to pledge, just leave. I don’t want to see you anymore.” Ye Qingtang waved her hand.

“Pledge,” The man said.

“Good.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head.

Soon, the pledging process was completed, and Ye Qingtang wanted to ask about the details of the man.

“Take it.” The man took out a red token from his space ring and threw it to Ye Qingtang. His hand gently touched her forehead. The moment his palm touched her skin, a blood moon sparkled at her glabella.

Ye Qingtang did not notice anything as she was holding the token and trying to figure out what that was for.

“Brother, what is this?”

However, there was no reply.

When Ye Qingtang lifted her head and glanced around, her sworn brother had long disappeared.

“Brother, you haven’t told me your real identity!” Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth. If she knew that her brother was so not reliable, she would not even take the pledge…

She saved him and even took care of him for three days. She eventually ended up with a token of no use?
