Ye Qingtang did not want to talk too much about divine abilities. She would never be able to explain everything to the Yongle Tribe General within such a short time, so she tried to simplify it as much as possible. “You don’t have to know what a clone is. Just tell me whether you can do what I asked just now.”

The Yongle Tribe General looked at Ye Qingtang with a serious expression. “Ancestor, if the conditions are met, it should not be a problem.”

‘What are the conditions?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“If Ancestor has already preserved his soul, then the strength of his soul cannot be stronger than mine. Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to do it.” The Yongle Tribe General told Ye Qingtang after thinking for a moment.

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought after hearing what the Yongle Tribe General said. Ye Qingtang did not know how strong the soul of the Blood Moon Elder’s original body was. However, the one she had was just a clone. Even if he had some soul strength, he could not possibly be stronger than the Yongle Tribe General. This Blood Moon Elder clone should not be on the same level as the Yongle Tribe General at all.

“No problem. I need to revive a soul but will definitely not force you. You don’t have to worry about this,” Ye Qingtang promised.

“Alright, in that case, there’s no problem. We just need a vessel,” the Yongle Tribe General said.

“Vessel…”

For a moment there, Ye Qingtang was in a dilemma. She knew what the Yongle Tribe General meant by vessel. To put it bluntly, it was a new body for the soul to safely take over. But where could she find a new body?

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was silent for a moment, the Yongle Tribe General asked Ye Qingtang, “Didn’t you prepare a vessel?”

Ye Qingtang did not deny it. She nodded and said honestly, “Indeed, I did not know that you would have such a divine ability, so I did not prepare the vessel you need. I’m afraid it’s a little troublesome.”

“I see. There’s no need for you to worry. I have quite a few vessels. I just don’t know if you’ll be interested,” said the Yongle Tribe General respectfully.

Ye Qingtang’s interest was piqued. The Yongle Tribe General actually liked collecting vessels?

“Zang, what kind of vessels do you have?” Ye Qingtang asked the Yongle Tribe General.

“Human vessels. I’ve collected a lot of human skins, but I don’t know if you would accept them,” said the Yongle Tribe General.

Not all demons liked human skin. Some cherished it like precious treasure, while others viewed it with contempt.

From the Yongle Tribe General’s point of view, for a great demon like Ye Qingtang, the skin of an ordinary human might not be good enough. Just one look at the human skin on Ye Qingtang’s body, and one could tell that it was very high-grade. The skins he had collected were not as good.

Ye Qingtang said in all seriousness, “It’s alright. As long as there’s a vessel, there’s no need to be picky.”

“Then do you want to come with me to choose a vessel, or should I select one at random?” The Yongle Tribe General did not dare to decide without Ye Qingtang’s permission.

“Let me come along to take a look,” Ye Qingtang said.

After thinking about it, it didn’t seem right to ask the Yongle Tribe General to just make a random selection. No matter what, it would still be the Blood Moon Elder’s new body.

“Ancestor, this way please.”

The Yongle Tribe General stood to the side and made a “please” gesture.

“No need. You can lead the way,” Ye Qingtang said..
