Chapter 2601: Unparalleled (9)

Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Although the two black-robed men concealed themselves, Ye Qingtang still sensed them.

Ye Qingtang was certain that the two men were focused on Feng Wuyin. She had read in the historical records that the Heavenly Demon Tribe kidnapped Jiuyou’s best playmate as a blood sacrifice for the Heavenly Demons.

The past had already happened and could not be changed. But now, Ye Qingtang had returned to this extremely distant era. She could watch history repeat itself and remain indifferent. Or she could also disrupt everything.

But at the end of the day, she was just a passerby in this era. If she interfered, would there be some unintended chain reaction?

If Ye Qingtang made a move and triggered a chain reaction, no one could guarantee if it would be good or bad. In fact, it was very likely that it would change the future eras. This was a concept that Ye Qingtang understood well.

If she dared to commit such atrocities in such a distant era, the consequences would be unimaginable. Perhaps in the future era, those who should have existed would disappear, and those who should not have existed would reappear

Ye Qingtang looked at the innocent-looking Feng Wuyin and frowned slightly. She did not know what to do.

“Sister Ye Yue, since you’re tired, let’s go home then!” Feng Wuyin wiped the sweat on his forehead from the hot weather and smiled at Ye Qingtang.

“Alright, let’s go home.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and smiled at Feng Wuyin.

As she spoke, Ye Qingtang scanned a certain part of the market. The two black-robed men who had disappeared had just appeared again and their focus was still on Feng Wuyin.

Actually, Ye Qingtang could not understand why the Heavenly Demon Tribe would target Feng Wuyin. There was nothing special about Feng Wuyin. Why would the tribe use Feng Wuyin as a blood sacrifice?

Logically speaking, even if the Heavenly Demon Tribe wanted to find someone to be their blood sacrifice, they should be looking for those people with a dense divine aura.

Ye Qingtang subconsciously glanced at Feng Wuyin.

Could there really be something special about Feng Wuyin that made the Heavenly Demon Tribe spy on him?

Ye Qingtang immediately secretly circulated the power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

Before long, Ye Qingtang realized that there was indeed something unusual about Feng Wuyin.

The divine aura in Feng Wuyin’s body was extremely majestic and terrifying, It was impossible for ordinary people to detect it. Only those with the Heavenly Demon Bloodline or others with extremely powerful divine aura could see through it.

Not only did Ye Qingtang have the Heavenly Demon Bloodline, but she also had the Heavenly Demon Pearl. With those two, it was very easy to pry into Feng Wuyin’s divine aura.

In addition, Ye Qingtang also had a divine aura herself. After she broke through to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven then, Ye Qingtang had already obtained a divine aura. However, Ye Qingtang’s divine aura was rather weak and could not be compared to the divine aura in Feng Wuyin’s body.

Although Ye Qingtang did not know how Feng Wuyin got his divine aura, she was certain that the two black-robed men were eyeing the divine aura in Feng Wuyin’s body.

With Feng Wuyin’s divine aura, he had indeed fulfilled the conditions for being a blood sacrifice. It was no wonder that the Heavenly Demon Tribe would target Feng Wuyin..
