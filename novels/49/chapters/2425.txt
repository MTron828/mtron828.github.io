Chapter 2426: Symbols (4)

Before long, Lu Yuanxiang led the group to where his team encountered the monster. It was a wreck with the smell of blood mixed with a strange odor.

The monster was no longer around.

When the group arrived, it was eerily quiet. Deep pain and sorrow surfaced on the faces of Lu Yuanxiang’s team when they saw the wreckage.

It was here that they lost a teammate and the rest of them had nearly died.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang searched through the debris and found the hole where the monster emerged from. Her face grew even grimmer when she saw the situation underground.

There were the same symbols carved in the ground beneath.

Ye Qingtang’s suspicions had been confirmed…

The appearance of these monsters and these symbols were probably linked and in a nefarious way. But what exactly did these symbols represent?

Why had the same symbols appeared in the fiendcelestial tomb and the Wailing Well?

…

“Wen Qi, your teacher… is rather capable.”

Outside the Wailing Well, the academy leaders were gathered in the hall and watching the movements of the teams through the screens.

During this period of time, they observed that the number of monsters had already far surpassed Ye Qing’s estimations.

They were unable to communicate with anyone inside. Meanwhile, Luo Sheng and the others, who had just entered the Wailing Well, had yet to meet with any team. As a result, those on the outside could not do anything but watch the events unfold.

And Ye Qing’s group had brought an unexpected piece of information to everyone.

Most of the teams had perished after encountering the above-Emperor level monsters. Even though a lucky few had managed to escape, none of them dared to return to investigate the matter. In the end, it was Ye Qing who examined the two places where the monsters emerged and discovered the same strange-looking symbols.

How courageous must one be to make such a move? FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Wen Qi also noted the appearance of the symbols in those two places.

“Does anyone know what those symbols are?” Wen Qi asked.

The crowd shook their heads.

“These symbols look very unfamiliar. We need to investigate further.”

The crowd believed that the appearance of those monsters was invariably linked to those symbols. But they had no idea what those symbols were.

They sent men to research those symbols.

“Wen Qi, this Netherworld Academy teacher is young and capable. It looks like he knows something about those symbols.” The Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President spoke up.

“It’s a pity that we are unable to communicate with them. Otherwise, we might be able to get more clues.” Wen Qi sighed.

The Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President was feeling rather helpless. “Never mind, going by his reaction, he must have some idea. Perhaps he can find more clues.”

The crowd nodded.

Ye Qingtang appeared to be the most clear-headed person amongst all the teams. Everyone at present was no fool. They could see that Ye Qing was looking for ways to leave the Wailing Well.

This point alone was already far beyond the progress of the teams from their own academies.

…

Ye Qingtang could vaguely feel that there was something wrong with this team competition. Before she had time to ponder over the newly-gathered clues, Mu Ziying’s face shifted from a warning by one of the wooden birds.

“Boss, bad news. Something is heading our way. And… it is very powerful.” Mu Ziying could clearly feel her wooden bird being completely destroyed even before the thing came close.

Whatever it was… It was definitely not one of the other teams…
