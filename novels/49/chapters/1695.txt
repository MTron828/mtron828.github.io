Chapter 1696: The Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate Realm (3)

Ye Qingtang raised her head to look at the enormous golden dragon. There was no fear or anxiety in her eyes. She gathered the power in her body and emitted a pale glow.

That glow became increasingly intense. Although it only enveloped her body, the dazzling light made it difficult for anyone to make out her profile.

“Even now you are just struggling in the mouth of death.” Baili Xuanyun was full of disdain as he gazed at the glowing Ye Qingtang. He leaped into the air and merged into his golden dragon. In the next second, the golden dragon dove toward that glowing ball. The enormous golden dragon opened its jaws as if it was going to swallow Ye Qingtang whole.

Boom! The golden dragon and the ball of light collided and the resulting intense rays of light blinded everyone in the crowd. No one was able to see what happened.

Jiang Yiran and the others had stepped onto the arena in their anxiousness, and the shockwaves from the collision shook the earth beneath their feet.

Elder Baili was all smiles at the sight. He turned slightly to gaze at the Jiang family elders, his eyes filled with arrogance.

“She just ascended to the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm. How could she even dream of competing with Xuanyun? Some people really think too highly of themselves.”

Elder Qian and the rest were very fretful as they gazed at the devastated arena. They were discreetly sighing and shaking their heads on the inside. As expected, she was not able to put up any sort of defence... Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Just as everyone thought the battle had ended now that Baili Xuanyun had attacked, a loud sound resonated from above the arena.

The intense light rays faded and the golden dragon appeared to be slowly dissipating from a pure white source of light.

After all the light faded away, two figures appeared in front of the crowd.

“How is that possible?” Elder Baili was taken aback and he sat up in shock.

Inside the arena, Baili Xuanyun was frowning at Ye Qingtang, who was still standing right in front of him. She was panting slightly but appeared to be completely unharmed!

It wasn’t just Elder Baili. Even Elder Qian and the rest were stunned. It must be pointed out that Baili Xuanyun had used the same attack to cause grievous injury to Jiang Yanyun!

If even Jiang Yanyun could not defend against the might of that golden dragon, how did Ye Qingtang... do it? It was impossible!

At this point, Baili Xuanyun was full of doubt at the turn in events. Only he knew himself that he hadn’t held back at all during his earlier attack. He had every intention of killing Ye Qingtang with one blow and then stepping upon her dead body.

He didn’t expect Ye Qingtang to be totally unharmed by this attack.

How was this possible?

“So that’s the extent of the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm?” Ye Qingtang lifted her gaze to look at the stiff-faced Baili Xuanyun.

Baili Xuanyun was momentarily taken aback. But then he gave a smirk. “Ye Qingtang, I was just warming up. Do you really think you can withstand a full attack from me?”

Although he didn’t know how Ye Qingtang managed to defend against his attack, Baili Xuanyun was not at all discouraged from his drive to kill her.

“You can try.” Ye Qingtang remained impassive. She continued to look at Baili Xuanyun with mild, chilly eyes.

A fighter who had just ascended the Fourth Heaven level would normally never be able to defeat an opponent in the advanced stages.

However...

She was holding a trump card, making her different from anyone else.

Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven!

If she didn’t possess the heritage of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven, Ye Qingtang would never have risked going head-on against Baili Xuanyun. But now, she did have the power to fight him.
