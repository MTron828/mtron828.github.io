1217 Rise Of The Phoenix 3

“Yin Yang Perfected Lord… Tenth Heaven?!”

The white-robed old man suddenly sensed the aura from Ye Qingtang’s body. His heart quaked in disbelief.

There was a Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord in this world. However, the Ninth and Tenth Heavens of Yin Yang Perfected Lord had already become the stuff of legends.

Based on unofficial historical records, the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord was a mark of divinity given to mankind by the true gods when the world was first created.

Any cultivator who managed to become a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven had hope of becoming a true god. In addition, at the initial state, their primordial qi would be transformed into divine energy…

However, at some point, the power of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven had been taken away by the true gods, ending mankind’s dream of becoming true gods.

A picture depicting this had surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

Many eras ago, there had been a major battle between the gods and the demons. The universe was shattered, and mankind betrayed the true gods…

This scene flashed past Ye Qingtang’s mind so quickly that she could not fully comprehend it.

Ye Qingtang vaguely understood that in the past, the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord was not a lost realm. It was possible for any cultivator to enter the Tenth Heaven. But at some point, the Ninth and Tenth Heavens had disappeared and been sealed within a mysterious iron door. It was extremely difficult for a cultivator to find the iron door, open it, and enter it.

“Is this the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord…”

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was standing in the void. The moment she thought of it, a Yin Yang image appeared behind her. It seemed to supersede the sun and moon as it emitted a solemn and ancient air.

“Looks like you’ve had a miraculous encounter…” The white-robed old man stared at Ye Qingtang and said thoughtfully.

Someone who was clearly doomed had mysteriously survived. Further, her martial powers had swiftly reached the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord when they had only been at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven previously. The white-robed old man was certain that Ye Qingtang had some miraculous encounter. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

However, even though she was at the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord and had comprehended the Realm of the Great Tao, the white-robed old man was still not afraid.

“Ant from an inferior mainland, no matter what, you are only a Yin Yang Perfected Lord. In my eyes, that is nothing.” At that moment, the white-robed old man glared at Ye Qingtang, who was in the void, and laughed coldly.

When she heard that, Ye Qingtang was silent for a moment. Her aloof gaze fell on the white-robed old man. “If we were in Central Mainland, you could indeed easily crush a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven to death like an ant, since you are in the Heavenly Venerate realm… A pity that on this mainland, you merely have the power of a Venerate and not a Heavenly Venerate.”

“Hmph, it’s all the same… if I can kill you once, then I can certainly kill you a second time!” The white-robed old man laughed coldly. He rose swiftly into the air and drew closer to Ye Qingtang.

“My rules are that you are not allowed to fly.”

Ye Qingtang said blandly.

As Ye Qingtang finished speaking, the white-robed old man who had just started flying suddenly lost his balance. He fell heavily to the ground with a loud crash.

“What?!”

The white-robed old man within the invisible screen was shocked.

The white-robed old man was somewhat familiar with the Realm of the Great Dao. But to attain the Realm of the Great Dao so that one could freely change the rules of a world as Ye Qingtang did was rare!
