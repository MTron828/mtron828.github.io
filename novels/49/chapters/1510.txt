Chapter 1511 Big Fellow 2

At that moment, the old man, who was being unrelentingly crushed by the big demon, was still using the qi in his upper body to protect himself. However, he had already spat out a mouthful of blood; he fervently wished he could tear Ye Qingtang into pieces.

But at that moment, it was nearly impossible to extricate himself from the grasp of the unhappy big demon.

The big demon was unimaginably large. The hollowed-out abdomen was as large as a palace. Blood continued to drip from the flesh above, and the earth beneath Ye Qingtang’s feet was unusually sticky from being soaked in fresh blood.

Ye Qingtang seized the opportunity to escape from the big demon’s abdomen with the little white tiger.

As for that old man...

He was on his own.

Ye Qingtang did not care whether the old man lived or died. She hoped the big demon would lose its temper and tear him into pieces.

Ye Qingtang walked for a long time through the big demon’s abdominal cavity. The smell was nauseating, but Ye Qingtang suddenly thought of something. She took out the dagger she carried on her person and scraped large quantities of the big demon’s flesh from the inner walls. Then, she stored them in her space ring.

One must know that the big demon’s flesh and blood were extremely valuable. Every small amount was a treasure greatly desired by many martial arts cultivators.

When this big demon’s body was taken away, everyone had given up hope.

Ye Qingtang had not thought about it, but she had unexpectedly... managed to obtain some flesh while the big demon was dealing with the old man.

But the smell in the big demon’s body was truly intolerable, especially for the little white tiger, who had an extremely sharp sense of smell. The stench almost caused it to faint.

When Ye Qingtang saw that the little white tiger could not stand it any longer, she simply pinched its nose shut so that it would be easier for the little white tiger to bear.

But the moment it opened its mouth to breathe, a drop of the big demon’s blood dripped into the little white tiger’s mouth.

This...

really caused the little white tiger to shudder.

Before Ye Qingtang could react, the little white tiger directly bit off a large piece of big demon’s flesh from the inner walls and swallowed it.

The big demon’s flesh was beneficial to Fiendcelestial Beasts, just as it was to martial arts cultivators.

The little white tiger’s skills had not advanced for a long time. The power in the big demon’s flesh was just what it needed.

So the girl and the beast busied themselves in the big demon’s abdomen.

Ye Qingtang scraped off large quantities of flesh, and the little white tiger seized the opportunity to munch on it.

Before long, they heard a dull noise outside, and the big demon’s body began to sway.

“Let’s go!” Ye Qingtang grabbed hold of the little white tiger, who had been eating happily, and flew towards the light.

No matter how valuable the big demon’s body was, it was not worth dying for.

The big demon’s attention was now on the old man. But once he was dead, the big demon would soon discover the two of them, which it had overlooked, partaking of its victory spoils. They would be doomed.

Ye Qingtang did not know whether the old man was alive, so she swiftly ran out of the big demon’s body with the little white tiger in tow. From afar, she could see a patch of dust rising behind her, but could not clearly see what was going on.

Ye Qingtang did not dare to remain any longer. She clutched the little white tiger tightly and swiftly clambered up the side of the valley.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

As they exited the valley, its interior was rocked by a huge tremor. Ye Qingtang saw the whale-like large demon flying through the clouds, gripping the other big demon’s body in its mouth. Large amounts of blood fell, and it looked as though it would fill up the valley.
