Chapter 1166: The Light of Hope (3)

Very quickly, Perfected Xuanchen returned to a small pavilion not far away and instructed her to control the spirit energy in the room to prevent others from seeing it.

Before long, spirit energy rapidly condensed in the air above, and it was exceptionally rich.

Looking at the spirit energy, Elder Bai Kui exclaimed repeatedly. He was going to be the first person out of everyone to feel this power.

“Elder Bai Kui, you must tell me when you’ve reached your limit, or else the consequences will be dire.” Ye Qingtang warned once again.

“Eldest Young Lady, I understand… Let’s begin!” Elder Bai Kui took a deep breath and said with a nod.

As Elder Bai Kui finished his sentence, the spirit energy in the air rapidly enshrouded him, and strings of spirit energy surged into his body.

With just a few breaths, Elder Bai Kui’s martial realm advanced from Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven to Fourth Heaven and subsequently to Fifth Heaven before everyone’s eyes.

When he reached the early-stage of Eighth Heaven, Elder Bai Kui was ghastly white. Unable to bear the ripping pain that his body was experiencing, he shouted loudly. “Eldest Young Lady… enough!!”

Then, the spirit energy that enveloped Elder Bai Kui faded away immediately.

At this instant, everyone was utterly dumbfounded when they looked at Elder Bai Kui, who was in the early-stage of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven.

Although they learned from Perfected Xuanchen that Ye Qingtang had a Dharma treasure that could control spirit energy, they still felt inexplicable amazement when they personally saw Elder Bai Kui advancing from Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven to Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven.

“Oh my god… This is simply an insane power…” Daoist Zijin walked over to Elder Bai Kui and shuddered when he felt Elder Bai Kui’s Yang Lord aura. Yet, he could not help but be exhilarated. In this case… Eldest Young Lady would definitely help him become a Yang Lord…

“Eldest Young Lady…”

A Ye Family Branch Master cupped his fists and asked Ye Qingtang, “Perfected Xuanchen is at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven, but why is Elder Bai Kui at Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven?”

Ye Qingtang explained. “The absorption of spirit energy is based on the cultivator’s own physique, martial talent, and mental state.”

“You mean that… a cultivator is like a holder, and every holder is different. Some holders can absorb more spirit energy while others will absorb less spirit energy…” The Ye Family Branch Master was in thought.

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head.

“So whether we can become a Yang Lord still depends on whether we can absorb even more energy,” Daoist Zijin said.

The Blood Moon Elder was rather uninterested in their discussion. How great would it be if he could absorb spirit energy as well?

The peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven was the peak of this mainland. Although Yin Yang Perfected Lord Ninth Heaven and Tenth Heaven both belonged to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm, these two realms could not be achieved by relying on absorbing spirit energy.

When Little Luo Xue was just reincarnated, Ye Qingtang once felt the breath of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven and had a slight understanding.

There was an “iron door” at a cultivator’s dantian. If this iron door could be opened, one could advance to Yin Yang Perfected Lord Ninth Heaven and even the Tenth Heaven.

Ye Qingtang once tried to open this iron door in her dantian, but no matter how hard she tried or what methods she used, she had no idea where the exact location of this iron door in her dantian was, much less opening it.
