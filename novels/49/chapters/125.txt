Chapter 126: Such a Pity (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

No one in a hundred years would be able to compete against Ye Qingtang’s results in the third segment.

Even the dissatisfied Elder Lin did not speak a word about Ye Qingtang entering Xuanling Sect.

How was it that such a talented and amazing young girl had only a red spirit root?

The more Elder Qin thought about it, the more despondent he was. If he had not known that a spirit root was hard to upgrade, he really would not give up.

As long as Ye Qingtang had an orange or yellow spirit root, the other three sect elders would most probably want to fight over Ye Qingtang.

However…

Elder Qin could only sigh, shake his head, and leave.

Once she entered the sect, how she developed herself from then on would be all up to her.

At that very moment, Elder Lin, who left the assessment observation location, returned to the Sword Faction with a gloomy expression.

Upon seeing Elder Lin’s unhappy face, the sect disciples cautiously retreated to a side and bowed respectfully without daring to utter a word.

Xuanling Sect was famous for its Sword Faction, and the Sword Faction was the most important. All the disciples would need to enter the Sword Faction to practice swordsmanship, and, thus, Elder Lin’s position in Xuanling Sect was self-evident.

Returning to the main hall of the Sword Faction, Elder Lin sat on the chair with a deep frown.

He felt a stifling feeling as he thought of Elder Qin’s proud reaction upon knowing Ye Qingtang’s real result for the third segment.

“Elder Lin.” A tall and handsome young man entered the hall and greeted Elder Lin obediently.

Elder Lin was initially unhappy but his stiff expression relaxed when he saw the young man.

“Ning Luo, is there anything that you’re finding me for now?” Elder Lin asked as he looked at the disciple before him whom he was extremely satisfied with.

“Regarding the absolute-kill sword array, I have already brought people to investigate it. There is nothing strange about the sword array. However, it was used to fight against demonic beasts a few months ago, and perhaps it wasn’t stable yet. I have already changed the raw stone in the sword array, and there should not be any more problems,” Ning Luo said.

Elder Lin nodded satisfyingly.

“Ning Luo, you’re the disciple whom I think the most highly of. I have always been at ease with you handling matters. I do not wish for the sword array accident to happen again in the future. Do order people to keep a tighter eye on it.”

“Yes, I will,” Ning Luo replied.

“Is there any other thing?” Elder Lin asked.

Ning Luo paused as he saw Elder Lin’s slightly gloomy expression from the corner of his eyes.

“I will definitely put in my best regarding the sword array, so please do not be troubled over it. Don’t let it affect your health.”

Elder Lin was very comforted. Yet, once he thought of Elder Qin’s expression when he asked whether Ye Qingtang passed the assessment, Elder Lin’s face darkened again.

“I’m fine. It’s only that the Array Faction elder thinks highly of a disciple who newly entered the sect. To think that my Xuanling Sect would actually have a disciple with a red spirit root, it’s very shameful, and we would be ridiculed by other sects.”

“Red spirit root?” Ning Luo was surprised as well.

Elder Lin sneered, “That disciple is Ye Qingtang. She was personally recommended by Mu Su, and Elder Lin thinks pretty highly of her. However… she is ultimately still a red spirit root and will not become anything big. I’m only afraid she would affect our sect’s reputation.”

There were very few people with orange spirit roots in all sects, and it was such an absurdity that they accepted a red spirit root as an outer sect disciple.

Ning Luo did not say anything, but upon hearing “Ye Qingtang,” a weird expression flashed across his eyes suddenly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Was not Ye Qingtang the person whom Ye You warned about?

She really passed the sect assessment!
