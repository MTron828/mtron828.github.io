Chapter 1649: See You In the Arena (1)

They were among the bottom of the top twenty from the Jiang Family and were basically there to gain some experience, spar with their peers, and join in the fun.

“Don’t make silly suggestions. I’ve heard there are few restrictions on the island. If you accidentally enter some forbidden ground, you’ll have no hope of leaving it alive. Many fools like you are lost on the island during each Martial Arts Championship.”

As they walked, they saw a group of people up ahead who seemed to be gathered around something.

They walked closer only to see a dozen youths from the Qiu Family. They were gathered together and seemed to be cursing at something.

In the middle of the group stood the figures of some Jiang Family members.

“Is that... Jiang Yisheng? How did he encounter these Qiu Family members?” The low-ranking youth standing next to Ye Qingtang asked curiously when he saw what was going on.

They had been planning to ask Jiang Yisheng to join them but could not find him.

They had not expected to run into him here.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. Jiang Shaobai, who was standing next to her, lost her amused expression.

“Is this all the Jiang Family is capable of? Doesn’t seem like much... In our Qiu Family, you wouldn’t even be able to crawl into the Island of Immortal Footsteps with your lousy skills. What’s the matter? Did I say something wrong? Aren’t we allowed to point out your Jiang Family’s incompetence?” A youth from the Qiu Family said sarcastically.

Jiang Yisheng and the other Jiang Family youths who were surrounded looked furious.

Jiang Yisheng had been planning to look for Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang, but along the way, he saw that a few Jiang Family youths, whom he knew, were quarreling with some members of the Qiu Family. He had approached to see what was going on.

However, he had not expected these Qiu Family youths to be so rude. They had heaped scorn on Jiang Yisheng’s head, so he had started to fight them.

The two sides were evenly matched in terms of numbers, and their skills were on par, but a big group of Qiu Family members had unexpectedly arrived soon after the fight started. This had forced Jiang Yisheng and the rest into an embarrassing situation.

After a while, Jiang Yisheng and the others were all wounded. They were outnumbered, and the situation did not look good.

“I think all of you are begging for a beating. You can’t even wait for the Martial Arts Championship to officially begin before looking for a beating. Don’t embarrass yourselves at the Martial Arts Championship with your poor skills. Get lost and crawl back to your Jiang Family before you completely ruin the last of your Domain Monarch’s reputation,” the youths from the Qiu Family said, roaring with laughter.

“What are you saying? I’ll fight you to the death!” Jiang Yisheng was infuriated. He swung his fist at that person’s face.

A few Qiu Family members held Jiang Yisheng down and punched him viciously in the stomach. Jiang Yisheng turned pale from the beating.

“You have such lousy skills, yet you still dare to display them in front of me? Looks like you don’t want your arms anymore. Break his arms. I would like to see how he participates in the Martial Arts Championship with broken arms!” A cold light flashed across the Qiu Family youth’s eyes.

Many of the youths from the various ancient clans could not stand each other, and they often brawled during each Martial Arts Championship. But it was not a big deal even if they lost. It just showed that their skills were inferior.

But now these Qiu Family youths were about to deal brutally with Jiang Yisheng and the other Jiang Family youths.
