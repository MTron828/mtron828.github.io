Chapter 109: Sword Array (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang used a voice that could only be heard by the two of them and said, “Array formation has a center to break, but the sword array does not. This means that it cannot be broken.”

“The sword in the stone is not the center?” Yun Shu was not familiar with array formations.

“That’s not true.” Ye Qingtang shook her head and smiled.

The middle-aged man arrived at the location when Ye Qingtang was chatting with Yun Shu.

“The sword array will test how long you can last inside.” The middle-aged man opened his mouth expressionlessly. It was another simple introduction without any clues given.

All candidates were confused by the rules. They were totally lost after the unpredictable illusion array just now. They could not figure out the assessment ways at all.

Testing on duration again…

This time would there be any demonic beasts?

“The standard this time is determined by your situation in the sword array. You can’t give up by yourself anymore. If you’re hurt by the array, your assessment will end.” The middle-aged man walked to the side and added.

Hurt by the array?

The candidates caught the key information.

However, when they glanced at the empty Eight Trigrams stage, they still could not figure out the nature of the assessment.

The first candidate felt extremely hopeless, as this round of assessment was conducted in front of everyone. People behind might still be able to refer to the previous candidates, but he was the first one again…

“First candidate, up the stage now.” The middle-aged man did not leave any thinking time for the candidates. He immediately announced the beginning of the assessment.

The first candidate came to the front in despair. However, this time the middle-aged man provided him with a reminder.

“You can use weapons to assist you in the sword array.” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The candidate immediately held the sword by his waist and stood on the Eight Trigrams stage desperately.

The middle-aged man then walked to the side of the stage and turned on the sword array.

Rays of light suddenly came out of the sword in the stone. The white light covered the entire sword. Suddenly, the stationary sword started to vibrate, and multiple sword shadows emerged out of the sword. The shadows formed five lightsabers, dashing towards the air. They turned sharply in the mid air and attacked the candidate on the Eight Trigrams stage.

The five lightsabers shot towards the candidate from all directions. The candidate shivered and then lifted his sword to defend himself.

A loud clang rang!

The candidates flourished his sword continuously to fend off the attack of the lightsabers. His feet also shifted swiftly for defense.

The moment he was hurt by the lightsabers, the assessment would then end. This assessment appeared to be easier than the previous one, and he definitely would put in all his effort to compensate his poor performance previously.

The candidate successfully fended off the first attack as the speed of the lightsabers were not too fast.

“The sword array doesn’t seem to be very difficult.” The rest of the candidates who were watching the assessment were much more relieved.

This was much easier than the illusion array.

Ye Qingtang noticed how the rest sighed in relief, and her mouth tilted.

Not very difficult?

You will soon know how difficult it can be.

When everyone was calmer than before, the sword in the stone vibrated again.

Another five lightsabers flew out all of a sudden.

The lightsabers on the stage increased to ten now, and the speed doubled!

The candidate who just sighed in relief was shocked by the ten lightsabers. Before he could react, the swords dashed towards him with double the speed!
