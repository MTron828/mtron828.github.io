Chapter 908 Demon-Like Intelligence (1)

“This game is extremely simple… Let’s guess who will die first: you or me?” Ling Yan said with a smile.

“Cut the crap with him. Kill!”

Ling Yan was known to have demon-like intelligence.

Although they had no idea what other cards Ling Yan had in his hand, they were a little restless when they faced such an intelligent

person.

Just in case anything happened, they had to kill Ling Yan in the fastest speed possible in order for their minds to be at ease!

“There are too many people that want my life… It’s a pity that they always die before me.” Ling Yan sighed softly. He turned a blind eye to the masses who surged towards him; he seemed completely relaxed, and no one could make sense of his calm composure.

Swoosh!

At the same time, a bolt of light appeared from somewhere and penetrated through the dozens of people present.

That bolt of light was extremely blinding, and no one could withstand its lethality.

“Heavenly… Heavenly Venerate…”

After sensing the power of this bolt of light, everyone widened their eyes in disbelief.

Boom!!

Boom!!

In the next second, the bodies of the dozens of people turned into ashes from the bolt of light. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Witnessing the scene before him, Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly into a devilish smile.

Such was the Karma Diversion!

At this instant, the dozens of powerful figures, who initially besieged Ling Yan, were hit by the strike from the Heavenly Venerate due to the Karma Diversion. They turned into ashes and disappeared along with the wind.

“Anyone beneath a Heavenly Venerate is an ant, is it…” Ling Yan stood with his hands behind him. His black hair danced in the wind as he looked up slowly with a faint smile.

“What about a Heavenly Venerate? At your peak, you were the Demon God.” Suddenly, the little azure dragon walked out from behind and spoke to Ling Yan.

“Demon God, you say…” Ling Yan slowly looked away and shook his head gently.

The so-called Demon God had already become past tense. If possible, he hoped to become the legendary… Divine Emperor in this lifetime and take a look at that even further, higher, and more mysterious world.

“Ling Yan, you added the Karma Diversion on the Heavenly Demon Pearl. This way, the strike of the Heavenly Venerate which Ye Qingtang bore will become your power boost. Not only will this resolve Ye Qingtang’s crisis, but it even allowed you to obtain the inheritance of the True Dragon. It truly is hitting two birds with one stone.” The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan and noted meaningfully.

“Hitting two birds with one stone, you say?” Ling Yan smiled without saying much.

“However, I’m really curious about how you knew that Ye Qingtang would definitely be hit by a strike of a Heavenly Venerate.” The little azure dragon was increasingly confused as it looked at Ling Yan.

Before waiting for Ling Yan to speak, the little azure dragon suddenly said, “Don’t say it yet. Let me take a guess… The Supreme Academy and Divine Virtual Academy are mortal enemies from the start.

“This time, a noble heir from the Feng ancient clan of the Central Mainland followed the team from the Divine Virtual Academy. Given his personality, he would definitely clash with the Supreme Academy while the people from the Supreme Academy definitely would not dare to attack him because of his identity…

“And given Miss Ye’s character, she would not watch from aside… But you lured the two Divine Virtual Academy disciples to the scene where Ye Qingtang killed Perfected Gu Yun with a strike…” The little azure dragon paused for a while and continued.

“As long as those two disciples tell the other Divine Virtual Academy disciples about the incident, the Divine Virtual Academy disciples would definitely be fearful or may treat Ye Qingtang as a Heavenly Venerate.”

“As such, Ye Qingtang would have the opportunity to attack that noble…” The more the little azure dragon spoke, the more it felt that its speculation was correct.
