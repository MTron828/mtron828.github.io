Chapter 2343: Try It Out Yourself (3)

“Boss, let me take your place in the fight.” Qin Feng immediately offered.

Ye Qingtang remained impassive as she said in a cold voice, “If you still treat me as your Boss, stand down!”

“Boss!”

Lei Yan was really in a panic now. Di Nuo hated Ye Qing so much that if they were to fight, wouldn’t he take this opportunity to just kill him?

Thud. Lei Yan kneeled down in front of Ye Qing.

“Boss, I cannot back down. Even if you kill me, I refuse to budge. You cannot fight him, I beg you, please. Let us leave now. Netherworld Academy? Inter-Academy Competition? We don’t care about any of that. Let’s just head out there together. As a group, we can rule the world!”

Ye Qingtang’s heart grew warm as she looked at Lei Yan’s red-rimmed eyes. She pulled him to his feet.

“As your Boss, how can I possibly let you leave with me? Don’t worry, if I can’t even protect you brats, I am not fit to be your Boss.”

Lei Yan wanted to say something else when Yun Chen gritted his teeth and stopped him.

“Listen to Boss.”

“Yun Chen, have you gone mad too? Don’t you know…”

Yun Chen tightened his grip on Lei Yan’s shoulder.

“When did Boss ever say something that didn’t come true? If he says he will be fine, we must believe him.”

No matter what Ye Qing said or did, they must believe in him!

Lei Yan was stunned. Nangong Lie and the others were also feeling very conflicted.

Meanwhile, Di Nuo laughed out loud at Ye Qing’s suggestion.

“Alright, since you wish to prove yourself in this manner, I will give you a chance. Teacher Zhu, what do you think?”

Zhu Ning was not at all interested in any of this. The only thing he wanted to know was who taught Yun Chen that palm flame. As a result, he remained silent. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Within minutes, news of Ye Qing challenging a martial arts and an alchemy teacher had spread across the entire medicine faculty. Quite a number of students from the martial arts faculty also heard the news and hurried over.

Those who had just arrived did not know what exactly happened. But after hearing the medicine faculty students’ narration, they were all dumbstruck.

“Has he gone mad? Ye Qing wants to fight Di Nuo? With his low cultivation stage… Wouldn’t Di Nuo kill him in just one move?”

“I think that he is just feeling guilty. Di Nuo’s theory is not without reason. Someone who is adept at both martial arts and alchemy. Is he a deity? And he is only a few years older than us.”

“Let’s not argue over whether that’s true, even if it is, how the hell is he going to fight Di Nuo? I just can’t understand what this Ye Qing is thinking. He’s probably a madman?”

Countless students streamed in to watch a good show. By then, Ye Qing was already standing on the platform with Di Nuo.

Lei Yan and the others stood beneath the platform, feeling more nervous than they had ever felt before. They were feeling even more nervous than when they were undergoing their own trials.

“Yun Chen, you should persuade Teacher Ye not to act so rashly. Ran Mo must have gone to inform the President. The President thinks very highly of Teacher Ye, so I’m sure we can wait until he is here before we make a decision?” Qiu Nan spoke in exasperation.

Yun Chen looked at Ye Qing before replying, “Boss is right, he must be the one to prove himself. No one else can do that.”

Even if Wu Fengling arrived and calmed the situation down, a rumor was like a seed. Once planted, it would grow rapidly and sprout leaves.
