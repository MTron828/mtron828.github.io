“…” There was a subtle change in Ye Qingtang’s expression as she stared at the lightning dragon.

Most of the spirit energy in the medium-grade spirit stones had been absorbed by her, and the remaining energy could not be used by humans anymore, so they were considered useless.

But she forgot that…

The last trace of spirit energy that could not be obtained by people still could be used by lightning dragons as they would swallow the entire stone.

Though most of the spirit energy was used by Ye Qingtang, the remaining was still much more than the spirit energy that inferior-grade spirit stones contained. No wonder the lightning dragon was so excited.

Ye Qingtang smiled and watched the lightning dragon swallowing all the seventeen medium-grade spirit stones. It laid beside her in satisfaction. Ye Qingtang could not help but poke its round belly gently.

The lightning dragon swung its body lightly but was too lazy to move anymore. Its eyes narrowed comfortably.

Ye Qingtang witnessed how satisfied the lightning dragon was and did not poke it anymore. She gently hugged it in her arms. This gave her a reminder that in future if there were medium-grade spirit stones again, she must leave the scraps to this little dragon.

After settling the lightning dragon, Ye Qingtang took out the Spirit Life Flower from her space ring.

Laughter filled her eyes as she sized up the Spirit Life Flower.

This was the treasure that Ye You was longing for.

Ye You got her hands on it in last time around, and her spirit root was refreshed. The power of her spirit root became purer, and her ability improved at a faster pace.

In this life, the Spirit Life Flower did not belong to Ye You anymore and fell into her hands!

Ye Qingtang did not hesitate and swallowed the Spirit Life Flower.

Other than a little sweetness, the taste was not special.

After four hours, Ye Qingtang suddenly frowned as there was a wide breath circulating inside her body.

Ye Qingtang’s body felt like it was being beaten by hammers. Her limbs and body were shivering slightly.

Ye Qingtang could clearly feel that her spirit root was surrounded by a weird power.

The Heart of the Demon God seemed to be disturbed and awoken at the same time. It engulfed the weird power constantly and then channeled all the power to the spirit root.

The whole process was unbearable for normal people.

The spirit root was the foundation of a cultivator and their source of power. The refreshing process was painful and unbearable.

Ye Qingtang’s entire body was soaked with cold sweat, but she gritted her teeth and persevered without making any sound.

The pain slowly faded after a long time.

Ye Qingtang calmed her heart down and checked the situation of her spirit root.

The orange color was brighter now, and her spirit root was radiating some kind of hot breath. The color was darkening, and eventually, the spirit root showed a golden-yellow color.

“Yellow spirit root?!”

Ye Qingtang was stunned, and her body trembled. It took her very long to realize what just happened.

She also did not expect the effects of the Spirit Life Flower to be so great. After the process, her orange spirit root had leveled up to a yellow spirit root!

Leveling up a spirit root was extremely difficult, and it was even harder to do so on this land where there was insufficient spirit energy and obsolete martial civilization. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

However…

Her spirit root still leveled up under such conditions…
