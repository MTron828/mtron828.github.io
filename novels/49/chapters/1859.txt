Chapter 1860: Hoodwinked (3)

In the gambling town.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo circled around for quite some time but soon enough, they were both filled with despair and ran into each other.

Originally, the pair were considerably well-dressed, wearing some exquisite accessories but now, their outfit was completely plain. They had lost almost everything.

Their eyes met and they both revealed an awkward smile.

They quickly spotted Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was sitting on a stump, caressing Little White Tiger’s fur. The moment they saw Ye Qingtang, a cloud passed over their faces.

“Miss Ye.” Mu Feiruo’s face was red as he looked at Ye Qingtang with embarrassment, feeling dejected.

Baili Xi also did the same.

“You lost everything?” Ye Qingtang sized them up. Just a glance and she could tell what had happened.

Things were awkward for Mu Feiruo and Baili Xi as they stood there with lowered heads, without their usual confidence.

They had won tens of spirit stones using Ye Qingtang’s method at the start.

But they were completely clueless about the fat catfishes’ multitude of ways to gamble.

They had only learned from Ye Qingtang how to control the dice but when faced with other situations, they had no idea what to do at all and naturally lost everything.

Having lost all their spirit stones, how could they not feel embarrassed? They didn’t want to ask Ye Qingtang for more, hence they started betting with the Dharma treasures in their space ring.

But who knew...

That they would lose almost everything.

They didn’t even win once out of the many bets...

If this went on, it wouldn’t take too long before they lose everything they owned, with not even a piece of clothing left for themselves.

They were both prodigies with superior martial talents, but for anything other than that...

Ye Qingtang seemed to already have predicted this outcome. She shook her head as she looked at them both, saying, “Shall I lend you more?”

She then reached out for the spirit stones she just won.

But Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo instantly shook their heads, rejecting her suggestion.

They had a clear idea of their gambling skills. With their current levels, even if Ye Qingtang gave them all of the spirit stones she had on hand, it wouldn’t be enough for them, they would just lose it all.

Thankfully, they took another approach.

“Miss Ye, can we exchange for spirit stones using our Dharma treasures?”

Mu Feiruo looked at the big sack beside Ye Qingtang. It seemed she had a big harvest.

“I... don’t think we should do that. Since we’re all in this together, I can just give the spirit stones to you if you need it.” Ye Qingtang was very generous. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But the more generous she was, the more guilty Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo felt.

They had already imposed on Ye Qingtang on many occasions, they even owed their lives to Ye Qingtang. How could they continue troubling her?

Miss Ye was benevolent but they couldn’t possibly be that shameless.

“No worries, Miss Ye. We’ve already made the decision. We’ll feel bad if we take your spirit stones without exchanging for something,” Baili Xi said earnestly.

Ye Qingtang had won the spirit stones based on her own efforts. How could they take them away from her without anything in return?

Afraid that Ye Qingtang would reject them again, Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo quickly took out a few Dharma artifacts from the space ring.

They were the geniuses of the two powerful ancient clans. They naturally had the best Dharma artifacts from the two ancient clans...
