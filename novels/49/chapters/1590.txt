Chapter 1591 – Allied Forces (1)

Night fell, and the people in the town were fast asleep. Dark clouds covered the moon silently as though it was a premonition of the arrival of death.

In the room, Ye Qingtang, who was cultivating through meditation, suddenly opened her eyes as she heard some noise. She immediately stood up to check what happened, but the moment she opened her room, the white-robed believers were scampering all over the place with terrified expressions while making cries that sounded like knells.

Ye Qingtang originally wanted to ask someone about the situation, but based on their current state, she probably would not get any answer.

Thus, Ye Qingtang simply left the Vatican and headed to the area of chaos.

The back of the town was guarded by a garrison, but this place was covered in smoke right now.

Numerous figures were locked in a deadly battle in the darkness, and swords glistened from the reflection of the moonlight. Tall figures collapsed in the pool of blood one after another, and the mixture of the heavy blood and smoke choked everyone. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“General Mark, the allied forces’ troops are too great in numbers. They launched a sneak attack in the night, and we have suffered a great loss!” One soldier dripping with blood spoke as he looked at the highest-ranked commander, General Mark, in the town.

Mark frowned deeply as he looked at the intense battle not far away.

This town was in a remote location and was extremely far away from the main battlefield. However, no one expected the allied forces to suddenly attack this place.

The abrupt attack left the guards completely unprepared.

The enemies’ numbers were far above theirs, and Mark’s guards suffered a great loss in just the first wave of battle.

“General, should we retreat first...”

The soldier had not finished his sentence when he was immediately kicked to the floor by Mark.

“I will behead whoever dares to retreat! Listen to me carefully. No matter what, we must endure the allied forces’ attacks. Even if I’m left with my final breath, I will never let them invade into the land of the Supreme League Kingdom!” Mark unsheathed the heavy sword on his waist with a sharp clank.

“My troop only has soldiers who died in a battle and absolutely no deserters! Do you all hear me!”

“Yes! General!” The soldiers were shocked by their general who pledged his life to guard the defensive line, and all of them prepared to fight with their lives on the line.

“Don’t stand around. Polish your spears and follow me to the battlefield!” General Mark waved his hand and secured his helmet before getting onto a horse in preparation to fight with his life.

The soldiers guarding this place numbered fewer than one-fifth of the allied forces’ troops, and even if they fought hard to the end, it would be difficult to achieve victory.

Mark was very clear that the allied forces were fully prepared this time, and the number of mobilized troops was far more than what met the eye. He had faintly seen a black lion flag flying at the back of the battlefield, and the elite forces represented by the flag truly sent a shiver down Mark’s spine.

Nevertheless, Mark had not extra time to consider these factors.

His homeland was right behind him, and a disastrous nightmare would fall upon them should they retreat.

“KILL!” Mark yelled furiously. The shouts of the army filled the air as they charged into the battlefield with him.

As Mark and the army charged into the battlefield, a slender figure slowly walked out of the town.
