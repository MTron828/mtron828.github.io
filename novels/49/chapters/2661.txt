Chapter 2662 I’m Here To Kill You (7)

Each move possessed supreme power. Every single one of Han Cangming’s attacks could destroy the world and make the heavens pale in comparison.

“Ancient Desolation, activate!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The light in the Paragon’s eyes flickered as she gave a soft command.

A barrier appeared around the Paragon. The five colors of the barrier corresponded to metal, wood, water, fire and earth. In the next second, golden light erupted and completely blocked Han Cangming.

“Ancient Desolation, attack!”

The Paragon shouted coldly.

Immediately after, endless flames fell from the sky like a storm. In just an instant, this place became a sea of flames again, forcing Han Cangming to dodge to the left.

“Ancient Desolation, grow!”

“Boom!”

Ye Qingtang saw the ground shatter everywhere and countless vines surged out from the ground. They were like the hands of a giant as they grabbed at Han Cangming.

“Too powerful...”

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck by the battle between the Paragon and the Demon God Han Cangming. This was the true battle between two supreme beings.

Each move was enough to destroy the mainland.

If Han Cangming and the Paragon were not restraining themselves, this world would have probably ceased to exist long ago.

In the next second, the colorful barrier around the Paragon gradually increased to ten. The additional five colors represented wind, lightning, electricity, light and darkness.

“Metal, wood, water, fire, earth, wind, lightning, electricity, light, darkness...”

Han Cangming looked at the ten elemental powers that appeared around the Paragon. He fell into deep thought.

Swoosh!

The Paragon suddenly waved her right arm and the Heaven-grade divine weapon in her hand immediately slashed towards Han Cangming.

As the sword descended, the power of the sword’s intent reached its limit. Even the surrounding void began to shatter. It was spine-chilling

“Heavenly Demon Curse, Domain!” Han Cangming muttered softly, his eyes instantly turning green.

Everything turned dark.

Ye Qingtang could not avoid it in time but she was also trapped in the domain of Demon God Han Cangming.

“This... Is this the domain power?”

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when she sensed the domain power.

Ye Qingtang had heard of domain power but had never seen it before. She only heard that only those at the Immortal Emperor level had the chance to comprehend the power of domains.

“I am akin to a god in my domain. No one can defeat me.” Han Cangming stood with his hands behind his back. He floated in front of the Paragon and smiled.

The Paragon frowned slightly. In Han Cangming’s domain, she could only hear faint sounds. It was impossible to see or touch. It was like she had lost her basic senses.

At this moment, the Paragon seemed to have been reduced to an ordinary person without the strength to even truss a chicken. She was probably inferior even to a normal practitioner.

“There’s no need to struggle anymore.” Han Cangming chuckled softly when he saw the Paragon’s expression. “If you had discovered this earlier, you might have been able to use the Space Technique to escape from the range of the domain. However, due to carelessness, you missed the opportunity. Now, you are totally at my mercy. You can’t even speak now, let alone escape this place.”

The domain was filled with endless darkness. Ye Qingtang stood in a corner as if she had been completely forgotten.

Just as Han Cangming said, Ye Qingtang could not move at all and felt as if she had lost all her senses.

Just as Ye Qingtang was at a loss of what to do, the power of the Great Dao in her body circulated automatically and her eyes and long hair became snow-white.
