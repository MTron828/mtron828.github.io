“Sister Qingtang, we’re here. This is my house!”

Just as Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, the young Feng Jiuyou tugged at the corner of her clothes.

It was only after hearing Feng Jiuyou that Ye Qingtang returned to her senses.

Directly ahead was a mansion with a plaque hanging above.

“Feng Family.’

“Jiuyou, call me Ye Yue,” Ye Qingtang suddenly said.

Feng Jiuyou was slightly taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words, and he looked at her in confusion. “Sister Qingtang... didn’t you say that your name was Ye Qingtang..? Now it’s Ye Yue?”

Feng Jiuyou had never heard that a person’s name could change. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Jiuyou, I met you for the first time and am not familiar with you, so I did not tell you my real name,” Ye Qingtang casually lied.

The reason why she could not use Ye Qingtang’s name was that she did not know whether this era would affect the future. Therefore, it was better to use another name. It was better to be safe than sorry.

“Alright, Sister Ye Yue. This name is much better than Ye Qingtang anyway.” Feng Jiuyou smiled.

Ye Qingtang, “..”

“Sister Yue, let’s enter,” said Feng Jiuyou.

Ye Qingtang nodded and entered the Feng Estate with Feng Jiuyou. The Feng family was different from large clans flourishing with numerous members. There were not many people in this family. Including the Feng disciples, there were only about a dozen people.

‘As soon as she entered the Feng residence, Ye Qingtang saw many youths who were about the same age as Feng Jiuyou.

Every single one of these youths possessed a cultivation at least at the Second Heaven level Divine Lord. The highest among them had already reached the Fourth Heaven level.

Seeing this scene, Ye Qingtang could not help but sigh. How old were these youths? They already had the power of a Divine Lord at such a young age. Even in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, they would be considered rare, genius talents.

Of course, the martial arts culture in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain was still much inferior to the Divine Venerate Domain. Therefore, Ye Qingtang was not surprised that these youths already had the cultivation level of a Divine Lord at such a young age.

“Jiuyou, who is this sister?”

Ayoung man walked over and sized up Ye Qingtang curiously.

“She’s Sister Ye Yue. I... I met her outside. Sister Ye Yue helped me when I was in danger.” Feng Jiuyou smiled.

“Hello, Sister Yue,” the young man greeted Ye Qingtang very politely.

Ye Qingtang smiled and nodded at the youth.

“Qingtang... no, Sister Yue, these are my siblings,” Feng Jiuyou introduced.

“Sister Ye Yue is really good-looking. She’s even better looking than the eldest daughter of the Feng Yun family.” The young man smiled.

Ye Qingtang, “..”

This young man was so good with words.

“Sister Yue, let’s go. I’ll take you to see my father and mother.’ Feng Jiuyou grabbed Ye Qingtang and strode towards the inner hall.

In the inner hall, a young couple was grinding some herbs. When they saw Feng Jiuyou enter with an unfamiliar woman, they immediately stopped and looked at Ye Qingtang.

‘Jiuyou, who is this lady?” Mother Feng asked.

“Mother, this is Sister Ye Yue. She came from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. When I was in danger, it was Sister Ye Yue who saved me,” said Feng Jiuyou..
