Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang felt fear in the face of the aura of the Immortal Emperor practitioners, which was an indescribably oppressive force.

Regardless of whether it was in the distant past or the now, it was her first time witnessing such insurmountable power from the Immortal Emperor level practitioners. It was a power that had far surpassed everyone else. Anyone below their level could only despair in the face of such oppressive power. There was no hope of resistance at all.

…

“This power…”

At this moment, Ye Qingtang who was standing inside the Feng family’s training arena looked up at the two Immortal Emperor level practitioners in the sky. Would she ever be able to be at their level?

Even though the current her was already a far cry from what she was in the past, she knew that in the face of the Immortal Emperor level practitioners, she was still extremely weak. Besides the peak-level powers of this world, she was nothing more than a tiny ant.

Even though she still had not used the massive powers within herself yet, it was probably still nothing compared to the Immortal Emperor level practitioners.

She watched as the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming fought each other in the sky. Their eyes were fixated on each other as the Immortal Emperor level aura started diffusing all around them.

As they fought, lightning flickered in the sky as day turned into night which was then lit up as bright as day by the lightning. The two of them were so powerful that they were affecting nature itself.

Everyone else could only look on in utter shock. The Immortal Emperor level was something that martial practitioners chased after their entire life.

“Heavenly Emperor, I’ve already calculated… I’ll come back after you win this battle, so that I won’t be dragged down by you,” Han Cangming said with a sudden loud laugh as he disappeared into the void. He vanished in an instant and it was as though he was never there,

“You want to escape?”

Seeing Han Cangming disappear, the Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flashed coldly.

With a slight wave of his fingers, the void shattered. He frowned as he looked up at the void.

The thunder clouds had all gathered in one area and there were flashes of red coming from it.

At this moment, the Heavenly Emperor suddenly understood why Han Cangming was running and what he meant by a calamity.

“That… that’s!”

Under the void, everybody stared at the dark clouds in the distance as their expressions turned incredulous.

“The Calamity of the Sky’s Wrath!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Feng Family Patriarch gasped.

“That… The Calamity of Wrath…” Ye Qingtangs eyebrows furrowed deeply.

The Calamity of the Wrath was a natural calamity. It was no ordinary natural disaster and was targeted at the Immortal Emperor level practitioners.

In the past, there have been many Immortal Emperor practitioners heralded as immortal who met their demise under the Calamity of Wrath.

The Calamity of Wrath… was going to be the Heavenly Emperor’s grave!.
