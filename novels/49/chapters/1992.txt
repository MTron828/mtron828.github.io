Chapter 1993: Theft (3)

In order to show her sincerity towards the Crimson League, she had included a few other gifts as well.

The Temple of Shadows was quite a distance away from the Ancient You Clan. Xue Fu was treating the Netherworld Ring as though it was real and transporting it carefully to the Frost Abyss.

But just as they were halfway through their journey, Xue Fu suddenly stopped the group and looked sharply at the road in front of them.

There was a group of people waiting for them on the wide road.

“Is that the Ancient You Clan?” the Goblin Tribe Leader who had followed on this journey stepped forward in surprise.

Xue Fu frowned. His heart sank as he looked at the menacing expressions of the Ancient You Clan. At the same time, You Qiong and the two wardens that he had brought with him saw the group from the Temple of Shadows as well. Their eyes lit up.

“I guess the information was right after all. The Temple of Shadows really is transporting something.”

“The Guardian is also here personally, which means that it must be something important.” One of the wardens looked at the cart full of beautiful boxes.

“Go.”

Without hesitating after spotting their target, the Ancient You Clan rushed forward with the few strong men they had brought along.

Xue Fu screamed silently in apprehension as he saw the Ancient You Clan make a move.

“Ancient You Clan, you dare?”

“What a joke. Why would we be scared? I might be able to spare your lives if you leave your things with us,” the Ancient You Clan warden spat out with a cold laugh.

“We are required to transport this elsewhere. Don’t you dare steal it from us!” Xue Fu shouted.

“And where are you sending this to? No matter where you were planning on going, this belongs to us now. There is nothing in the world the Ancient You Clan doesn’t dare to take!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The skirmish started in an instant.

Even though the Temple of Shadows had the advantage in numbers, the youths that the Ancient You Clan had brought were extremely powerful. Even Ming Wang wouldn’t be a match for them. Let alone the wardens that were there as well.

In the blink of an eye, the group from the Temple of Shadows had been beaten into the ground.

Xue Fu was giving his all to resist but could only watch as an Ancient You Clan youth took the cart from in front of him and brought it back to the Ancient You Clan camp.

“Guardian! What should we do?”

Xue Fu narrowed his eyes. He knew that their strength was completely mismatched and that within the Temple of Shadows, only Ming Di and the Holy Lord of Shadows were a match for these youths.

The items had already been stolen. They would only die if they continued to resist.

“Retreat!” After weighing his options, Xue Fu could only choose to retreat.

Seeing the Temple of Shadows retreat pathetically, the two Ancient You Clan wardens laughed loudly. “Who cares about the Temple of Shadows. They were beaten just like everyone else.”

You Qiong who was at the side glanced at the arrogant wardens and secretly gave a cold laugh.

Even though he wasn’t sure why Ye Qingtang had wanted him to spread this news and let the Ancient You Clan steal the items, he knew that she wouldn’t let them take advantage of this easily.

The Ancient You Clan returned with the cart full of loot. The two wardens opened the beautiful box to see what was inside. They laughed gleefully as they saw countless jewels inside.

Their eyes brightened as they opened the last box and saw the black ring laying silently inside.

“The Netherworld Ring!”
