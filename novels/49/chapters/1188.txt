Chapter 1189: Look At The Big Picture (4)

In such a critical situation, Gu Yu, as the overall general of Heaven City, did not look at the big picture and instead sent her, who went to aid them, to death out of his selfish desires.

How could such a selfish person defend this mainland? If such generals were aplenty, how could this mainland resist the invasion of the Ancient You Clan? As a general, one should protect the city with his life and fight the enemy army to the end instead of dragging out an ignoble presence.

Since Gu Yu did not know what a general should do, Ye Qingtang would help him fulfill the mission of a general.

There was no reason nor humanity in this war. As long as one could achieve victory, any method was justified.

The outcome of this war concerned the safety of this entire mainland. If everyone did not fight with their lives, defeat was inevitable.

Even Ye Qingtang was prepared to die.

After killing Gu Yu and the rest, the remaining Ancient You Clan figures were jointly killed by Elder Bai Kui and the rest, who were in ambush from the start.

Without Gu Yu and the rest giving their all, Elder Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin would definitely be wounded.

Then, Ye Qingtang opened the city gates and walked out of the city. Looking at the bodies of Gu Yu and the rest who died in the battle, she bowed slightly and muttered. “Thank you.”

Regardless of whether they were good or bad or a friend or foe, when they were still alive, they still made a contribution to this mainland at the last moment.

This bow was not to Gu Yu and the rest but to those warriors who lost their lives in the battle to protect their homeland.

“Listen to my command. All the powerful figures in the city, attack… Heaven City! No one shall stay behind!” Ye Qingtang shouted deafeningly from the air.

“Kill!”

Hundreds of Ye Family disciples echoed uniformly.

“Where are the twelve Peak Masters of Falling Sky Valley!” Ye Qingtang scanned the surrounding.

“General, we are here!”

Twelve shadows bolted over swiftly.

“The twelve Peak Masters are to be in the vanguard. Take down Heaven City regardless of the price. Spare no resistors!” Ye Qingtang ordered coldly.

“Yes!”

As she spoke, the twelve Peak Masters turned into twelve shadows and disappeared from the sky.

“Has the war of this mainland… finally begun…”

The little white tiger shook its head. It jumped out from Ye Qingtang’s arms, and its body enlarged instantly.

“Good timing. Coincidentally, my stored energy is sufficient… I will fight alongside you,” the little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

There was a tinge of a smile in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at the little white tiger. Then, she leaped up and sat on the white tiger’s back.

…

A moment later, outside Heaven City.

The Blood Moon Elder’s enormous body was as tall as Heaven City, and he could see the situation in the city clearly without flying in the air.

That Ancient You Clan troop suffered a huge loss in order to occupy Heaven City by force, and this was the best time to conquer Heaven City. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Elder Yin Fo?!”

Many Ancient You Clan figures’ expressions changed when they saw Blood Moon Elder. They already knew that Elder Yin Fo betrayed Ancient You Clan and joined this mainland…

Although Heaven City had a topographical advantage and powerful figures were unable to fly…

the Ancient You Clan were astonished to see that Blood Moon Elder was still taller than Heaven City by a head.

“Have you seen enough!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted furiously, and his fists were like a giant mountain that violently crashed toward the masses at the top of the city walls.
