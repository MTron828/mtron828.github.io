Chapter 811 Blade (3)

The little white tiger seemed to be in thought after listening to the white-bearded elderly’s words.

“My parents…”

A cold glint twinkled in the little white tiger’s eyes before a sense of loss filled his eyes right after. Subsequently, it turned into reverence and fear.

A presence which suppressed its entire clan was overly huge and scary, and the little white tiger was enveloped in terror every time it thought of it.

If not for the fact that its parents risked their lives to let it escape, its ending…

That presence was at a height that even Fiendcelestial Beasts could not reach.

Very quickly, the little white tiger restrained its emotions and looked at the white-bearded elderly, whose expression was calm. “Is what you said true?”

“What do you think?” The white-bearded elderly chuckled.

“What the f*ck. You’re really magical… I claim that there’s nothing I am unaware of, but you can tell the future. Have you heard that in this world, everything has its own destiny?” the little white tiger said.

“Destiny?” The elderly ran his fingers through his white beard and laughed lightly. “The so-called destiny is just empty talk. There’s nothing that cannot be changed.”

The little white tiger shook its head.

When it first met the white-bearded elderly thousands of years ago, he had already predicted what would happen to this day.

The little white tiger did not believe him originally, but looking at it now, he was truly magical.

“The current situation is a little complicated… That lady and the Demon God keep repeating the Heavenly Emperor’s route… There’s also a guide … I’m afraid I cannot prevent anything.” The little white tiger sighed after a long while.

The white-bearded elderly smiled. “You just need to do your best in blocking these death tribulations.”

Afterward, the white-bearded elderly looked up in the air and said, “Remember, nothing is destined. Anything that is destined is only so because the party involved has no ability to change it.”

“How I wish to reveal the truth entirely.” The little white tiger yawned.

The white-bearded elderly shook his head. “Some things still require the parties involved to explore and understand. If others explain entirely, it will definitely backfire and be self-defeating. Perhaps, it is impossible for death tribulations to be avoided, and even I have no means of changing it.”

“What the f*ck. So troublesome.” The little white tiger sighed. Swinging its tail, it stood up and headed out of the valley. “I’m leaving. I’m afraid that she will be sad and cry when she can’t find me.”

The white-bearded elderly chuckled. Subsequently, his entire body became increasingly transparent until it turned into nothingness.

The night before Ye Qingtang and Master Du planned to head to the Dragon Vein, the little white tiger finally returned to the workshop.

The silver wolf glared at the little white tiger fiercely and bared its fangs.

“What the f*ck. I’ll dig your eyeballs out if you look at me again!” The little white tiger barked.

As the little white tiger spoke, the silver wolf immediately turned its neck away and looked at another direction.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger and snickered. “Tell me. Where did you run off to?”

“I went to meet a great figure.” The little white tiger replied.

“Great figure? Which great figure?” Ye Qingtang went blank.

“I don’t know his name,” the little white tiger said after thinking.

No matter what, it was good that the little white tiger could return. Ye Qingtang was not bothered with it running away from home once in a while. Anyway, the silver wolf ran away from home frequently…

Before long, Ye Qingtang returned to her room to rest after finalizing the plan and deciding the time to head to the Dragon Vein with Master Du.

The little white tiger yawned and walked to the silver wolf’s side casually.

“Get lost.” Seeing that the silver wolf was so tactless, the little white tiger slapped the silver wolf several meters away and seized the silver wolf’s nest completely.DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
