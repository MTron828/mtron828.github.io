Chapter 171: I Was Lying (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

It could be said that Meng Sheng completely experienced what “having eyes but failing to see” meant.

“Junior Sister Ye, I’m sorry. I… was rude previously. You can punish me. It is all my fault for being ignorant and narrow-minded.” Meng Sheng took a step forward, bowed, and apologized to Ye Qingtang with heartfelt admiration.

Gu Yanqiu secretly smiled.

Meng Sheng was perhaps strict, but he had a good nature. Otherwise, Gu Yanqiu would not keep cooperating with Meng Sheng.

Ye Qingtang looked at Meng Sheng’s earnest apology and immediately waved a hand.

“Senior Brother Meng, why are you like this? We are all disciples of the same sect. There is no need to treat each other as strangers.”

A generous reply could resolve any possibly-existing feuds.

Ye Qingtang was like this as well, clearly distinguishing kindness and hatred.

“Senior Brother Qin, how is your condition?” Ye Qingtang was not too bothered with these and was more concerned about Qin Huan’s injuries.

Qin Huan was already helped to sit at a side by Gu Yanqiu. There was quite a large amount of the Giant Lizard’s poison stained on his chest, and his arm reduced in size. His face was slightly pale, but it did not seem like there was any fatal injury.

“Still alright. It’s just that my arm is in a little pain from the burn.” Qin Huan laughed bitterly.

Gu Yanqiu removed Qin Huan’s clothes to check his chest injury but was a little confused when he took a look.

A mouthful of poison was spat on Qin Huan’s chest by the Giant Lizard at that time. The power of a level 6 Giant Lizard poison was very scary, and if first aid was not done immediately, the person’s bones would be corroded completely. Moreover, they were disturbed by Qinglin Sect just now and missed the best timing.

Gu Yanqiu originally thought that Qin Huan’s injury would definitely be extremely serious.

However, he did not expect that…

After removing Qin Huan’s clothes, Qin Huan’s chest was perfectly fine, and not a single piece of skin was burnt. Rather, it was the area on his arm which was stained by the poison that burnt a small hole.

“This…” Gu Yanqiu was a little speechless.

This was completely different from what he imagined!

Meng Sheng and the rest were confused as well.

The level 6 Giant Lizard spat such a huge mouthful of poison on Qin Huan’s chest, but he was actually in perfect condition? RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Even if Qin Huan was made of steel, he would still not be able to stop the corrosion from the poison.

“I told you I’m fine.” Qin Huan patted his firm chest and found it strange as well. His gaze uncontrollably fell on the fire-resistant soft armor that Gu Yanqiu removed.

The fire-resistant soft armor was not damaged at all. Although the poison burnt his outer clothes, it was completely blocked away by this piece of soft armor and, thus, did not injure him.

“Junior Sister Ye, this soft armor…” Qin Huan suddenly returned to his senses with shock written all over his face.

“Junior Sister Ye, you saved my life this time!”

Qin Huan was not a fool. He knew that the level 6 Giant Lizard’s poison was extremely deadly and was aware that he could escape this tragedy all thanks to the fire-resistant soft armor that Ye Qingtang ordered him to wear.

Previously, Qin Huan only thought that this soft armor could block the heat and never expected that… it could actually withstand the poison from a level 6 Giant Lizard!

Ye Qingtang chuckled at Qin Huan who was brimming with energy once again. Without saying much, she took an antidote and stuffed it into his mouth.

Although the fire resistant soft armor could block away most of the poison, Qin Huan’s arm was still injured, and he would need to stay bedridden if he did not take any antidote.

Everyone was curious about how Qin Huan escaped death. Qin Huan was not corny and told them about the fire-resistant soft armor that Ye Qingtang gave him. Gasps filled the air instantly.
