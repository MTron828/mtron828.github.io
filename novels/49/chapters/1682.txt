Chapter 1683: One Wave After Another (3)

The Island of Immortal Footsteps would not prevent the disciples of the families from fighting. Even if the Baili family and the Mu family joined up to attack the Jiang family, no one could raise any objections as long as the Great Elders of both sides didn’t intervene. Even if the Jiang family got beaten up badly, they would only be blamed for not being good enough to protect themselves.

“So, Ye Qingtang, do you intend to hide behind everyone like a turtle in its shell and drag your family down with you? Or are you going to step up and fight with me?” Baili Xuanyun grinned maliciously.

“What do you mean by dragging down the family? Since we are the same clan, we will bear all troubles together. The Jiang family fears no one.” Jiang Yiran put up a false bravado as he stood up and faced off with Baili Xuanyun.

The camaraderie was dampened almost immediately by the Jiang family youths. “Yiran, you may be on good terms with Ye Qingtang, but we are not familiar with her. We don’t wish to be implicated in this matter.”

“Moreover... since she has to challenge the top ten sooner or later, it doesn’t matter who she challenges first.” Those few Jiang family youths were very reluctant to side with her and made no pretense of their stance. Ye Qingtang had only been at Taiyuan Valley for a short period of time and seldom interacted with them. Why did they have to be dragged into her troubles?

Jiang Yiran was nearly puking blood in anger at those youths and Baili Xuanyun laughed out loud.

“So it seems your Jiang family is not as united as I thought.”

By now, the faces of Jiang Yisheng and Jiang Yiran were very grim. Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai were not present and those Jiang family youths were rebelling against their wishes. What could they do?

Watching the squabbling crowd, Ye Qingtang suddenly stood up.

“As you wish. I will challenge you in the next competition.” Ye Qingtang gazed calmly at Baili Xuanyun.

“Little girl!”

“Qingtang!”

Jiang Yiran and Jiang Yisheng were thunderstruck.

Baili Xuanyun was not Mu Ruxue. He was way beyond her league!

“Alright, I will be waiting.” Having achieved his goal. Baili Xuanyun left with his gang in satisfaction. His eyes were filled with malicious intent. He would make sure Ye Qingtang died in that arena, to make good his revenge for Mu Ruxue.

After Baili Xuanyun and his gang left, Jiang Yiran turned to glare at those useless Jiang family youths.

But those youths only pasted on innocent faces.

“Yiran, didn’t you also wish to beat up Ye Qingtang then? You have changed your mind in such a short period of time? We have known each other for so long but still can’t compare to her? Do you really want to see us beaten up by Baili Xuanyun just for her sake?” The youths spoke bluntly, not caring that Ye Qingtang was just sitting there.

“You are all talking bullsh*t!” Jiang Yiran was so angry that his wound started to ache.

“It doesn’t matter whether you are happy about this or not. The Baili family has Baili Xi, while the Mu family has Mu Feiruo. Even with Brother Yun around, we may not be their match. So even if we stand and fight, the end result will be the same,” the youths continued to argue vehemently.

Jiang Yiran was about to rebuke them when Ye Qingtang stood up again. She patted Jiang Yiran’s shoulder.

“Since I was the cause of all this trouble, I will settle it myself,” Ye Qingtang stated.

The lips of those Jiang family youths twisted. They clearly didn’t buy Ye Qingtang’s words.

Settle it?

Her? Please. She was just going to get beaten up by Baili Xuanyun.

“No, little girl. This matter was clearly because I...” Jiang Yiran felt rather anxious. At the end of the day, he was the true cause of this entire situation. Ye Qingtang was just the scapegoat.

But Ye Qingtang shook her head and didn’t give Jiang Yiran a chance to finish speaking. She made up an excuse and left.

Jiang Yiran stared after Ye Qingtang’s departing profile until she disappeared from sight. He then remained seated in his chair and clutched at his own head fretfully.
