Chapter 2069: Strange (1)

Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang was still thinking of ways to wake Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue but nothing was working.

According to Ning Luo, the only way to break them out of the Ancient You Clan’s control was to kill the one controlling them, Elder Yuan.

But he had escaped after the previous battle.

At this moment she had no idea where to find the Ancient You Clan after they had escaped. The only way to completely eradicate them was to borrow the Crimson League’s power.

Originally she had planned to use the Spirit of Chaos fragments as an excuse when talking to Mi, but there were some things that she had to smooth out first.

In the past few days, Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo had both been by Little You Yun’s side.

The little white tiger had followed her to do so as well but noticed that her gaze had become strange over the past few days.

“Have you realized that... your cultivation level has been increasing rapidly...”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

How had she not noticed!

Ever since returning from the underground world, her power had been growing rapidly.

Perhaps... Was this all due to Little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode?

The more she understood the power of the Spiritual Abode, the more she was sure that if Little You Yun’s identity was exposed, it would create a lot of trouble. Even the Crimson League may take action.

Because of this, she could only hide Little You Yun. Even the Temple of Shadows didn’t know that she had brought back two children.

In the short span of a few days, Ye Qingtang’s cultivation level had risen by a few levels and she had reached the Seventh Holy Venerate level.

She was extremely happy with the rise in her power. She sensed that the reason she could absorb the power so quickly without the fear of combusting was due to the Deity Ocean within her.

Every time Little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode pumped power into her body, the Deity Ocean would release a wave of power as well, integrating the power into her body.

With her current power, there was no one more powerful than her in the Central Mainland save for those youths who had received power from the Spiritual Abode and ate the flesh of the demon cubs.

...

After a few days of strategizing, Ye Qingtang prepared to talk to Mi about her plan to eradicate the Ancient You Clan. But just as she entered the main hall, she saw a long shadow stretched out in front of her.

In front of her was the mysterious boy who had appeared beside Mi the other day. He seemed to have followed the Crimson League to the Temple of Shadows.

Although she had tried probing Mi a few times about his identity, Mi had never revealed anything about him, which made her all the more curious.

She looked at him and nodded slightly, preparing to leave but as they brushed past each other, he suddenly raised his hands to stop her.

“Do you need me for something?” she stopped in her tracks and looked at him.

His gaze swept past her face, as though he was thinking of something.

It would have been impossible for her not to sense something strange in his gaze.

“I wonder if the Holy Lord is free today?” he asked flatly.

“I’ve heard great things about you and I hope you can give me some advice.”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What was going on?
