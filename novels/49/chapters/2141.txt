Chapter 2142: You Dare To Hit My Student? (1)

The commotion spread across the entire practice arena.

Even Qin Feng who had been concentrating on his cultivation was roused by the noise. He turned and saw Lei Yan fleeing pathetically, but his eyes remained flat and emotionless.

“Brother Feng.”

A voice rang out beside Qin Feng.

Qin Feng turned and saw that three teenagers who had similar features as himself had suddenly popped up nearby. His brows furrowed slightly at the sight of the first teenager.

“Eldest Uncle asked me to bring this for you.” The teenager smiled at Qin Feng and placed an elixir flask in front of him.

Qin Feng didn’t move and that teenager just smoothly placed the bottle back into his own pocket. It was as if he had no intention of really giving that elixir to Qin Feng in the first place.

It appeared that Qin Feng was already used to this teenager’s actions. He remained silent and just turned to leave the practice arena.

Looking at Qin Feng’s departing profile, the corners of the first teenager’s lips curled up slightly.

“Qin Xuan, just look at him. He still thinks he is the former glorious Qin Feng?” Another teenager commented to the first teenager.

Qin Xuan smiled. “He stopped being that a long time ago.”

“That’s right. The Qin family invested so much in him but look at him now, his cultivation level has regressed to this state. The Clan Master is a fool. Qin Xuan, your current cultivation level is already at the Paragon Ninth Heaven level, and you have long surpassed Qin Feng. The prodigy whom the Qin family needs to focus on now should be you,” another teenager piped up.

Qin Xuan lifted his head slightly, his eyes brimming with confidence.

The Qin family only needed one elite prodigy and Qin Feng was already a lost cause.

“I heard that the Netherworld Academy already has plans to kick Qin Feng out. If he is chased out, as much as the Clan Master wants to continue protecting him, he probably cannot continue doing so without backlash from the rest of the family.” Yet another teenager piped up.

“In the past, someone from our family even said that Qin Feng would become the next Qin Zhuo. Look at him now, he’s merely become a joke... Qin Xuan, you are the only one now who can help rebuild the Qin family’s reputation. If you can find the Sword of Destruction, you will definitely replace the former Sword of Destruction Deity, Qin Zhuo!”

The two teenagers continued to speak excitedly.

Qin Xuan was now the strongest amongst the younger generation of the Qin family. It was only natural that they were treating him as the future leader of the Qin family.

“The Sword of Destruction went missing over 10,000 years ago together with Qin Zhuo. It won’t be that easy to find it.” Qin Xuan sighed.

If he could find the Sword of Destruction... he would definitely become the next Sword of Destruction Deity! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After listening to Ye Qingtang’s instructions, Jing Ze practiced for a long time before going to the other faculties to continue his studies.

Having nothing else to occupy her time, Ye Qingtang explored the area, trying to see if she could find traces of the Wind-Calming Pearl.

But after going one round and even exploring the academy’s treasure vault, she couldn’t find any trace of the Wind-Calming Pearl. It appeared that rumors of the President himself safeguarding those pearls must be true.

Just as Ye Qingtang was prepared to turn back and continue her cultivation, the sounds of laughter drifted over to her ears.

Ye Qingtang didn’t pay much attention at first, but she heard a name being spoken amidst the laughter. That name caught her attention.

“Mu Ziying, are you deaf or mute? I was calling you. Why are you ignoring me?”
