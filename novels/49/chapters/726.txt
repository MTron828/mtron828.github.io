Xiong Feng ran over hurriedly and spoke once he saw Ye Qingtang. “Ye Chen, why are you back so soon? Did you come around? Do you want to find another elder to be apprenticed to?”

Ye Qingtang shook her head and smiled. “That’s not the case. I’m still here to be apprenticed to Perfected Xuanchen.”

“Huh?” Xiong Feng was surprised. This time, he noticed that there was an elderly beside Ye Qingtang and immediately gasped when he fixed his eyes on the person.

…

In the main hall of Falling Sky Valley, Yan Shu was helping Perfected Xuanchen to tidy up the scrolls on the table.

“Master, the Blue Cloud Peak’s disciples are a little unsettled recently. They looked for trouble with the disciples at our side when they left the valley. This matter…” Yan Shu said with a frown.

Perfected Xuanchen’s brows were furrowed. He was about to speak but saw Xiong Feng entering the hall anxiously.

“Reporting Valley Master. That Ye Chen is back again.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Perfected Xuanchen did not have any emotions on his face. He was rather helpless towards that young man’s persistence.

Rather, Yan Shu had a look of annoyance on his face.

“Is that fellow finished? Didn’t Master already tell him clearly? Why is he here again? Warden Xiong, you also know what my Master meant. Why did you still let him in?”

Evidently, Yan Shu was dissatisfied that Xiong Feng let someone into the valley again.

Xiong Feng replied. “It’s not that… I did not let him in intentionally, but… he brought another person back.”

“Brought another person here? Did he bring a senior from her clan over to plead for her?” Yan Shu asked with a frown.

Xiong Feng shook his head. “It’s not someone from his clan but… but Master Du.”

“What?”

Yan Shu dropped the scrolls in his hand.

Perfected Xuanchen was all the more shocked.

“Master Du? You said Master Du of Bliss Forging Workshop?” Perfected Xuanchen asked.

Xiong Feng nodded.

Yan Shu was surprised. “It can’t be right? That fellow really invited Master Du over? Could it be that he found someone who looks similar to Master Du to pretend to be Master Du? Warden Xiong, did you identify him correctly?”

“Yes. That person is indeed Master Du,” Xiong Feng said.

Perfected Xuanchen was astounded. He had requested to meet Master Du countless times but was unsuccessful over the years. Now… this person was really invited over to Falling Sky Valley?

Perfected Xuanchen immediately stood up and walked out of the hall.

Yan Shu followed right after hurriedly.

Perfected Xuanchen saw an elderly with aged features standing beside Ye Qingtang outside the hall. The moment Perfected Xuanchen saw that elderly, his heart skipped a beat.

“Master Du, why are you here?” Perfected Xuanchen asked, surprised, as he looked at the elderly.

Master Du looked up slightly at Perfected Xuanchen and said, “Perfected Xuanchen?”

“That’s me.” Perfected Xuanchen nodded in reply.

Master Du nodded slightly and looked at Ye Qingtang beside him. “I’m here today because Brother Ye wanted me to come and make a sword for you.”

“Make a sword for me?” Perfected Xuanchen was astounded, and he looked at Ye Qingtang in surprise.

“Master Du… I have requested you to help me make a sword for many times before, but you’ve never agreed… Now…”

Master Du said, “I’ll naturally not bother if others wanted me to forge weapons for them, but since this is Brother Ye’s favor, of course I will help him.”

Perfected Xuanchen was astonished.

Ye Qingtang asked him to make a sword, and he agreed just like that?!
