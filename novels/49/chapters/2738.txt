Chapter 2739: Return to the Blue Sky Domain (4)

Everything that had happened was contrary to the wishes of the owner of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. The owner of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao wanted to make the Heart stronger, but half of the power had been absorbed by her, the vessel.

What would happen next?

...

“I need to leave for some time.” Ye Qingtang was deep in thought.

She had to find out more about her mother.

Ye Qingtang even vaguely felt that it was… That?she?might be linked to the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

...

The Divine Venerate Domain, the Great Immortal Temple.

The Deity Realm was locked in a fierce battle with the Great Immortal Temple.

The Nine Heavens Saint, Absolute Heaven Saint, and many other Saints were protecting the Great Immortal Temple. The divine might of their array formation emitted waves of ripples that completely enveloped the Great Immortal Temple.

“Just how long do you think you guys can hold out for?”

A man with long, waist-length hair stood there. His entire body exuded a supreme aura that made one’s heart tremble.

“Feng Wuyin, it’s been 10,000 years. Are you still unable to let go?” The Absolute Heaven Saint stared at the man and sighed.

“Let it go?”

The corners of Feng Wuyin’s lips curled up into a devilish smile. “You… killed my sister, and you want me to let it go.”

“Ye Yue is my disciple and also a member of our Great Immortal Temple. She has been missing for 10,000 years and we have never given up on searching for her,” the Nine Heavens Saint said to Feng Wuyin.

“This has nothing to do with me.” A terrifying coldness shot out of Feng Wuyin’s eyes. “You were the ones who sent her to the Fourth Domain for the relic, but you didn’t protect her well. You deserve to die, just like Han Cangming!”

As he spoke, Feng Wuyin raised his right arm slightly. A streak of heavenly fire descended from the sky and enveloped the entire Great Immortal Temple.

“It’s useless.”

The Absolute Heaven Saint said, “The Great Immortal Temple is protected by a Paragon Relic. You won’t be able to crack it.”

“Is that so?” The man sneered. “What if I include him?”

Another white-haired man slowly stepped out.

“Feng Jiuyou?!”

Everyone from the Great Immortal Temple was shocked at the sight of Feng Jiuyou.

Feng Jiuyou had gone to search for Han Cangming and disappeared for a long time. Why was he here?

“Although I don’t agree with Wuyin’s actions… Sister Ye Yue’s death is directly related to you all. You should pay the corresponding price.” Feng Jiuyou said in a mild voice.

“Jiuyou, cut the crap. Break their array formation,” snapped Feng Wuyin.

A moment later, there was a loud bang.

The array formation above the Great Immortal Temple was finally broken after the two of them joined forces.

“Kill them.”

Feng Wuyin raised his arm and countless practitioners charged into the Great Immortal Temple.

Within seconds, the Great Immortal Temple clashed with the Deity Realm.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang, who was in the air, shook her head. She did not expect Feng Wuyin to become like this because of her departure. In fact, Ye Qingtang only treated herself as a passerby of the era. That was why had she left with Ling Yan without saying goodbye. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

In a flash, Ye Qingtang disappeared from where she was and arrived in the Great Immortal Temple.

“Stop.”

Ye Qingtang shouted with a frown.

However, there were too many people from the Great Immortal Temple and Deity Realm.

No one heard her.

Swoosh!

An air-splitting sound rang out. One of the powerful figures from the Great Immortal Temple attacked Ye Qingtang with a Destruction-level divine weapon.

Ye Qingtang did not dodge at all. She raised her arm and stopped the Destruction-level divine weapon with just two fingers.
