Chapter 79: A Little Dragonoid (2)

When their eyes met, that bloodthirsty glare vanished without a trace. The little dragonoid’s expression became pleasant, blinking its innocent eyes at Ye Qingtang, and in the next moment, it trotted towards her on its little feet.

Beneath the surrounding gazes of astonishment, the little fellow who had beaten the Great Elder to a pulp was now wagging its tail like a puppy before its owner. While rubbing its hands with glee, it regarded Ye Qingtang with eyes sparkling with excitement. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Mommy~ Mommy~ I’ve beaten the bad guy~ Ain’t I great?”

“….” Mommy?!

Ye Qingtang stared at this peculiar little ‘beast’ in bewilderment.

She had heard of filial imprinting in precocial birds, whereby a hatchling would identify the first living species it saw as its parent, but to think… that such a ‘practice’ was amongst a noble beast, like the lightening drakes as well?

The little fellow was unaware of Ye Qingtang’s contemplations. With its head held high, it continued to wag its tail and regard her with enthusiasm. Its innocent and adorable features were totally unlike that of the savage beast that had just beaten someone to near death.

“Yeah…” Ye Qingtang heaved a deep breath to suppress the palpitations in her chest.

Having received her praise, its wagging tail turned livelier.

Rubbing her forehead, Ye Qingtang had the notion that things had proceeded beyond her expectations. But to not dwell on the matter, she approached Ye Ling to carry on with her plan.

The little fellow toddled behind her like a duckling following its mother, with its sparkling eyes transfixed on her and a smile playing on its lips.

Mommy~ Mommy ~ It had finally managed to appear before its mother-to-be….

However…. the little fellow peered at its own pair of little claws, and could vaguely make out the reptilian scales beneath its fair skin.

Sure enough, this wouldn’t do at all.

Only the offspring of that man and its mother could serve as the host for its powerful conscious. Though this lightning drake was a powerful existence, should it remain in this host for too long, the drake’s body would surely crumble.

If its mother had not faced that danger just now, it would never had succumbed to possess the young body of the drake.

Usually, drakes did not possess the ability to transform into a humanoid. Ye Qingtang’s knowledge from her past memories did not fail her, but she had no way to know that the chubby little fellow behind her was originally the little black orb conceived from the heart of the demon emperor.

“Tang Tang… that’s…” Like the others, Ye Ling was shocked by that little fellow’s presence since it first appeared.

“Father… that, I’ll explain later. We need to decide what to do with the Great Elder now.” Ye Qingtang suggested after having simmered down.

Ye Ling gave a slight nod, whilst the Second Elder had already apprehended the tattered Great Elder and brought him before them.

Ye Qingtang turned her attention towards the surrounding guests and addressed them: “We’re sorry for having to put all of you through that. May all the guests leave the premises now for this is a private matter. Thank you for your kind cooperation.”

The guests had no intention of staying behind in the first place. What transpired tonight was a sticky situation where no one would wish to get involved in. Thus, in accordance to Ye Qingtang’s request, the guests left without complaints, after bidding their valedictions.

“Tang Tang, tonight, I’ve….” With the exception of Duan Tianrao, who looked at Ye Qingtang with a face full of concern.

However, Ye Qingtang regarded him with an impassive look and interrupted his words: “Mr Duan, thank you for your assistance tonight. We’ll arrange for someone to see you home safely.”

Duan Tianrao faltered for a moment when he noticed her cold and impassive face. He could not help but to feel a sense of foreboding.

“Tang Tang, I’m fine, really. What do you think of what I’ve suggested earlier? As long as you agree, I’ll talk to my father once I return home later, and we can reinstate our engagement.”
