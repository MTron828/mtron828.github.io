Chapter 2005: Good Show (6)

“Is it the Crimson League?”

One warden immediately recognized Bai Zhi, who rode on the back of the mutant Wind Snake.

The two wardens looked at each other and instantly stepped forward. “How can we be of any help to the ambassadors of the Crimson League?”

Right after they said that Bai Zhi jumped off the back of the mutant Wind Snake and appeared right in front of them. She grabbed their necks forcibly and growled with flashing eyes.

“How dare you fool me!” Bai Zhi had a dangerous look in her eyes. She felt humiliated every single time she recalled that these idiots from the First Domain had fooled her.

“Fool you? Why do you say that? How did we fool you...” One warden quickly responded. He just couldn’t figure out how they even offended the Crimson League.

Hadn’t they already returned the Netherworld Ring? Why would the Crimson League even come back for them? Let alone the fact that she was in such rage.

Before the warden could even finish his words, Bai Zhi snapped his neck. A grown man’s neck was as fragile as a chopstick in front of Bai Zhi. The bones in his neck cracked and his head rolled onto the ground.

The morbid left the other warden so frightened he could barely stand. He simply couldn’t figure out what had gone wrong. Why did she just lash out like that?

“P-Please spare my life!”

All the color drained from his face. The Ancient You Clan was now powerful enough to dominate the Central Mainland, but when faced with Bai Zhi, who came from the Second Domain’s Central Mainland...

He wasn’t capable of handling her.

The Ancient You Clan’s guards were shocked. They were at a loss and didn’t know what to do, but they held the swords with a firmer grip, clenched fingers drenched in sweat.

They had seen Bai Zhi’s powers with their own eyes. Even the warden wasn’t a match for her, how would they stand a chance?

“Bai Zhi.”

They heard a voice from behind the mutant Wind Snake. The dangerous look in Bai Zhi’s eyes only subsided after she heard the voice.

The person in black robes rode on black wind and arrived.

“Who handed the Netherworld Ring to you?” the person in black robes asked. In response, Bai Zhi threw a pointed glare at the warden.

“It was... Elder Mo.”

“Get that old scoundrel to come out now,” Bai Zhi sneered.

“Elder... Elder Mo is not here right now. He left right after you earlier on. May I know... what made you this angry? Is there any misunderstanding?” the warden inquired. He was afraid that he would end up the same way as the other warden.

“So he left... That old scoundrel planned everything.” Bai Zhi grit her teeth as she figured everything out.

Elder Mo escaped after making up excuses and giving her a fake Netherworld Ring.

“How dare the Ancient You Clan fool the Crimson League with a fake Netherworld Ring. I’m certain that I can find the Netherworld Ring after I extinguish the Ancient You Clan!” A murderous look flashed past Bai Zhi’s eyes. Before the warden could even speak, she snapped his neck.

The next moment, Bai Zhi was just like a gust of wind and she flew into the Ancient You Clan’s valley. The alien races didn’t do anything, they just allowed Bai Zhi to do anything.

Outside the valley, the corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips lifted into a smile.

It seemed like the Crimson League had fallen into her trap.
