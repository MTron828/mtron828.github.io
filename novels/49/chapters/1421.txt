1422 Who Exactly Are You 3

In the next second, Elder Xu flew to the sky, and a piercing scarlet glow shot out from his palm, which struck toward Beidou Demon Lord’s heart.

Ye Qingtang was astonished, and she took out the Mirror of Illusions at once!

Right before the scarlet glow was going to touch him, the Mirror of Illusions that Ye Qingtang took out flew to Beidou Demon Lord’s heart and received the blow.

In an instant, that murderous scarlet glow turned into crimson butterflies, which flapped their wings and dispersed.

“Mirror of Illusions. You do have some stuff, but it’s a pity that you can only use it once in a short period of time.” A murderous expression emerged on Elder Xu’s face. A huge scarlet glow behind him expanded suddenly like a red sun that hung in the sky. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Anyone who offends the Jiang Family must die.”

The cold voice was like a funeral bell. In the next second that it rang, a huge scarlet glow shot at Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord.

“Careful!” Beidou Demon Lord flipped over and protected Ye Qingtang beneath him the moment he saw that supreme force crashing toward them.

Boom!

That ball of scarlet glow hit Beidou Demon Lord’s back directly and caused a huge wound on his large back. His originally glistening fur was completely burnt, and his flesh was ripped apart by the scarlet glow. Beidou Demon Lord spouted a mouthful of blood, which splattered all over Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang widened her eyes as she looked at Beidou Demon Lord’s large frame that loomed over her and his contorted expression as a result of the pain.

The sight before her overlapped with the scene from her previous life.

“Brother!”

A shout exploded from Ye Qingtang’s chest, and black flames covered her body instantly. She rushed out of Beidou Demon Lord’s protection quickly, and the black flames around her body crashed into the next blow of scarlet glow that struck at Beidou Demon Lord’s back.

The Heavenly Venerate skills were not what she could resist as an Arcane Supremacy Eighth Heaven. In the next instant, blood shot out of the ears of Ye Qingtang, who forcefully bore the attack.

All her energy was depleted, and blood dripped from the corner of her lips.

The little white tiger who was set aside by Ye Qingtang was alarmed by the sight.

“F*ck. I’m going to fight it out with you!”

In just a moment’s time, the little white tiger’s body enlarged out of a sudden as a white flame shot out from its mouth and hit straight at Elder Xu.

“Fiendcelestial Beast?” A look of surprise flashed across Elder Xu’s eyes when he saw the white tiger, which enlarged dozens of times. However, he turned calm very quickly and raised his hand to crush the flame that the white tiger shot out.

The white tiger spouted flames continuously in an attempt to stop Elder Xu.

“You’re just an infant. How can you harm me?” With the wave of a hand, a scarlet glow flowed out of his palm and crushed the white tiger on the ground. Under the overbearing force, the white tiger was pressed on the ground and unable to move.

“You’re not bad though. Once I kill them, I will bring you back to the Jiang Family and give you to Ye You.”

“F*ck… F*ck…” The white tiger could not move and wished it could bite this bastard to death.

Ye Qingtang’s powers have already reached the limit. Looking at the white tiger who was pressed on the ground, she spat out a mouthful of blood, and the black flames around her body disappeared rapidly. However, right before the black flames disappeared utterly, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline that had been dormant in her body seemed to have felt a familiar energy and erupted out of her.
