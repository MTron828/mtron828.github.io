Chapter 2050: Pagoda

Capturing demon cubs had become more difficult due to interference from the Temple of Shadows previously.

Elder Yuan didn’t think much of her words. The Ancient You Clan was in dire need of demon cubs after all.

“Understood. You can leave,” Elder Yuan spat at them impatiently before leaving.

They had their own rooms here, and the guard left after showing them to their quarters. They waited till there was no one before Ning Luo spoke up.

“I could feel her aura on him.”

That was not the only thing that he had sensed when he saw Elder Yuan. He had also sensed that his master was here!

Her aura was incredibly thick and filled the entire underground world.

“She’s here?” Ye Qingtang asked as she looked at him.

He nodded. “Definitely.”

She pondered for a moment. They had not raised any suspicion with the people of the Ancient You Clan and so they should be able to move freely.

“Ning Luo, try to sense it more clearly and see if you can tell where she is. We’ll go look for her now.”

Ning Luo agreed.

Even though You Qiong had no idea who they were searching for, he could tell that she was important from what they were saying.

“Holy Lord, please be careful.”

He was going to stay here in case anything happened.

Ye Qingtang nodded and followed Ning Luo out. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

This was the first time ‘Elder Mo’ had set foot here, so she could use the excuse of familiarizing herself to wander around. Pretending not to know anything, she started walking along the streets. Even though the place was huge, there was a sense of oppression wherever she went.

The children wandering the streets all had cold expressions and it was extremely quiet.

She noticed many pillars standing tall with intricate carvings on them. They reached from the ground to the sky.

All the pillars glowed faintly.

Her eyes swept over them and she briefly counted 108 pillars.

It was strange, they were all in odd positions.

She had just arrived here and had no idea what these pillars were for, but she suddenly thought of Ling Yan.

With his intellect, he would probably be able to tell at a glance what they were for.

However...

She could feel a headache coming on as she thought of his terrible martial arts skills. With his skills, she still didn’t dare take him out into the battlefield in case he got heavily injured.

“Ning Luo, have you noticed anything?” she asked.

His expression was odd.

“I can’t tell. I keep feeling like she is nearby but can’t pinpoint the location...”

He couldn’t make sense of the feeling as well.

Little You Yun’s aura seemed to be spread across the entire place and he could sense it everywhere. This meant he couldn’t quite sense the exact location she was in.

“But... I can feel that her aura is strongest near pillars,” he said.

Near the pillars?

She could feel her head starting to throb as she looked at the pillars.

There were a hundred and eight of them.
