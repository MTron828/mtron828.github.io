The black-robed man stared at Ye Qingtang with his eyes that were shown and explained his offer.

“Bullsh*t! We did not even meet before, and I don’t owe you anything! F*ck you! Why do you want to leave me here?” The white tiger shouted in rage.

The black-robed man did not respond to the white tiger. He was just staring at Ye Qingtang and seemed to be waiting for her answer.

After a short while, Ye Qingtang’s face was calm, and she said slowly, “I’m curious. why do you want me to leave this piece of land?”

“Ye Qingtang, do you want to know the reason?” The black-robed man sneered.

“I’ll listen to the story.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“It’s because this piece of land is full of sin… It needs to be destroyed… However, I’m willing to offer you a chance to live. Leave this land alone. Are you willing to accept my offer?” the black-robed man said.

After hearing the black-robed man’s words, Ye Qingtang sneered. “My parents and my siblings all live on this mainland… However, you want to kill all of them now and still ask me whether I’ll accept your offer. Don’t you think it’s pretty ridiculous?”

“So, you do not accept.” The black-robed man’s voice was full of disappointment.

“The Fiendcelestial Beast had signed the equality contract with me, so I will not leave it here. As for this mainland… no one dares to destroy it!” Ye Qingtang said firmly.

“Then we can only be enemies.” The black-robed man sighed.

“It seems that we will never be friends.” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled.

The black-robed man stood up slowly from the ground and swiped the dust on his clothes.

“Ye Qingtang, before you make your final decision, let me tell you a story first,” the black-robed man said and looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang could not tell the martial aura of the black-robed man. Thus, she did not rush to attack.

“This mainland was just a small island in the past. There was a lady who came from the Central Dynasty, and she used her own Spiritual Abode to form the mainland. She led the ancestors of the people here now to live on the mainland and taught them the higher levels of martial culture. Thus, there were many loyal followers of her… However, things changed. The lady’s strength was almost all used up as a result of forming the mainland… The greedy ancestors hurt the lady to acquire her last bit of energy. So, tell me. Do you think the people on this mainland deserve to die?”

Ye Qingtang had heard of the story from the white tiger before, so she did not have any feelings.

“No matter how many sins our ancestors had in the past, they’re already dead. This has nothing to do with their descendants. Furthermore, not every cultivator took a part of that. Most of them are innocent.” Ye Qingtang rebutted. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Hehe… everyone on the mainland here shares the bloodline of the ancestors. So, no one is innocent.” The black-robed man chuckled and shook his head.

“Just now you said there were a few loyal followers of the lady… So, are you a descendant of one of those followers?” Ye Qingtang probed.

However, the black-robed man did not seem to hide anything. He nodded and confessed. “That’s right. My ancestor was the loyal follower of the lady, and it does not change to my generation.”
