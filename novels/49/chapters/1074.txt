“Haha, I’m afraid this is none of your business.”

The warden of the Peerless School looked at Ye Qingtang somewhat impatiently.

“Really…”

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s mouth curved up slightly. She shielded her face with her sleeve. Within the span of ten breaths, her beautiful young girlish face quickly transformed into that of a handsome young man.

And this young man was the Ye Chen that they were looking for just now!

A half-smile hung on Ye Qingtang’s lips.

Her gaze passed over everyone as she said, “I’m Ye Chen… are you looking for me?”

“You… are Ye Chen?!”

Perfected Xuanchen stared at his own disciple, completely shocked and somewhat disbelieving

Ye Chen was actually a girl… and a Yang Lord?! How was that possible!

“You are Ye Chen!”

The Full Moon Peak Master, Xuanyuan Yi, looked at Ye Qingtang in shock and disbelief.

“Xuanyuan Yi, your grandson Xuanyuan Lie has already died. As a grandfather, aren’t you afraid that your grandson will be lonely? Shouldn’t you keep him company?” Ye Qingtang lifted her eyes slightly and glanced at the Full Moon Peak Master, Xuanyuan Yi, from the corners of her eyes.

“What did you say!”

Xuanyuan Yi’s expression was one of shock.

“Come here!” Ye Qingtang exclaimed.

A cold light suddenly flashed across Ye Qingtang’s smiling eyes. Without giving Xuanyuan Yi a chance to open his mouth, she suddenly grasped his neck and choked him.

At that moment, Xuanyuan Yi was in Ye Qingtang’s grasp and was unable to struggle. His body left the ground as Ye Qingtang lifted him up into the air.

“Have… have mercy…” Xuanyuan Yi’s face was flushed as he stared at Ye Qingtang in terror.

“Mercy?”

When she heard Xuanyuan Yi’s plea, the smile lurking at the corners of Ye Qingtang’s mouth seemed to deepen.

When she had left the Falling Sky Valley earlier, Xuanyuan Yi had continually pursued her. Had he shown any sign of mercy?!

“If you want mercy, you better ask for it in hell…” Ye Qingtang said blandly.

In the next second, there was a “snap”. Without giving Xuanyuan Yi a chance to speak, Ye Qingtang had swiftly twisted Xuanyuan Yi’s neck.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the lifeless Xuanyuan Yi and then casually threw the body at the feet of the warden from the Peerless School.

“You…”

The envoy from the Peerless School was both shocked and angry. He glared at Ye Qingtang.

“What’s the matter? Doesn’t your Peerless School want to capture and question me?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Peerless School warden. “I’m here now. Why don’t you act?”However, the Peerless School warden did not dare to say anything. He only clenched his fists, speechless.

Their pride in being a warden of the Peerless School made them unable to humble themselves. Although the person before him had injured disciples of the Peerless School, she was also a genuine Yang Lord…

If they started a fight with a Yang Lord as Ye Qingtang had suggested, their fate would probably be the same as that of the Full Moon Peak Master, Xuanyuan Yi…

“Ye Chen… We represent the Peerless School… you previously injured some disciples of the Peerless School. You should… give an account!” The warden of the Peerless School looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

“An account?” Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept across the warden of the Peerless School. Her face showed no expression. “I have already given you an account. I am here now. You can act whenever you want.”

“You…”

The Peerless School warden gritted his teeth in anger but was unable to argue.

“Ye Chen… it is true that you are a Yang Lord. But you are not showing the Peerless School any respect at all!” The Peerless School warden said.
