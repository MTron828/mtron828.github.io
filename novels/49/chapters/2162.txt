Chapter 2163: Failing To Recognize A Formidable Person (1)

Nangong Lie and Lei Yan had wanted to come and take a look at the situation. They believed that if even a person like Jing Ze could improve, they would do even better.

But...

This news was just too shocking!

Jing Ze’s bloodline had awakened?

What the hell...

“Bro... ahem... Teacher Ye, did you say that Jing Ze’s bloodline has awakened? What does this mean? I thought that he doesn’t have a bloodline?” Lei Yan was befuddled and full of queries. He was even addressing Ye Qingtang with a certain degree of respect now.

Ye Qingtang was finally assured after seeing Jing Ze’s condition stabilized. She then looked at the two brats who suddenly appeared, feeling rather exasperated by their questions.

“Who told you that Jing Ze doesn’t have a bloodline?”

“Everyone in the academy knows,” Lei Yan said.

“His bloodline was just dormant. It’s not that he doesn’t have one.” Ye Qingtang sighed. She now realized that Lei Yan’s level of intelligence was quite worrying.

The Leiting family was a great family clan. How did they produce such a foolish descendant?

Nangong Lie thought for a moment before suddenly coming to a realization. “I know about dormant bloodlines. Someone mentioned this before, but... isn’t a dormant bloodline something very troublesome? It is very difficult to awaken most dormant bloodlines. Either some major trigger or fortuitous encounter is required... Jing Ze didn’t have either during this period of time. Don’t tell me he managed to trigger the awakening of his bloodline just by beating Zhang Qiqiu?”

Nangong Lie believed that the fight must have been too stimulating for Jing Ze.

A dormant bloodline could lead to stagnation of one’s abilities. This could explain why Jing Ze didn’t improve after reaching the Paragon Sixth Heaven level.

While Nangong Lie’s reasoning was not without merit, but it was incomplete. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Zhang Qiqiu had used the power of his bloodline to attack Jing Ze. It was true that this might have been enough to trigger Jing Ze’s bloodline. But without Ye Qingtang’s prior teachings, even if Zhang Qiqiu beat up Jing Ze to a pulp with his bloodline power, Jing Ze’s bloodline might have remained dormant if it wanted to.

“Why are you two here?” Ye Qingtang gazed coolly at those two curious Georges. Bombarded by their questions, she went to sit down by the side.

Lei Yan and Nangong Lie exchanged looks, conflicted expressions on their faces.

Initially, they only had a vague interest in coming back to see what Ye Qingtang had to teach. But now, after discovering that Jing Ze’s bloodline had been awakened, their vague interest had deepened exponentially.

Jing Ze had been at the Netherworld Academy for quite a number of years. Even so, none of the teachers realized that Jing Ze had a dormant bloodline. And just a short period of time after meeting Ye Qingtang, his bloodline had been awakened!

This teacher did have some skills.

Lei Yan felt rather embarrassed to speak. After all, he had scorned Ye Qingtang earlier. It was really a blow to his pride to come crawling back now.

The youth was still caught in his dilemma when Nangong Lie suddenly spoke up.

“Teacher Ye, to be honest, your earlier confrontation with Teacher Di Nuo motivated me. Previously, I felt that I was already a useless person and didn’t want to trouble you. But now, I can see that you are a teacher who will not give up on any student. This has made me realize just how narrow-minded I was. In reality, I have always wanted to learn from you. I hope you will not dismiss me.” Nangong Lie tried to twist his earlier contempt of Ye Qingtang into him feeling unworthy of her teaching.
