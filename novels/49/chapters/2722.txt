Chapter 2723: Returning To Her Era (1)

Before Ye Qingtang could return to her senses, she was already dragged into the shattered void by Ling Yan.

“B*stard, where did this criminal come from? How dare you kidnap my Junior Sister Ye Yue!”

“Don’t you dare leave, you rogue!”

“You have a death wish!”

Seeing Ye Qingtang being dragged into the void by a strange man, Lan Shan and the other Great Immortal Temple disciples immediately drew their Destruction-level divine weapons and approached Ling Yan.

Seeing this, Ling Yan pointed his finger and an invisible wave of air spread out, sending the disciples flying across the sky.

In the next second, Ling Yan brought Ye Qingtang into the shattered void and disappeared.

...

When Ye Qingtang returned to her senses, she had already left the Fourth Domain’s legacy realm and returned to the outside world.

“Ling Yan, what’s going on…” Ye Qingtang was surprised. When did Ling Yan enter the Fourth Domain’s legacy realm?

“Miss Ye, do you remember the Heaven Ascension Sect Master’s core legacy hall?” Ling Yan smiled at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded. She had just left the legacy hall. How could she not remember?

“Whenever the five relics appear at the same time in that hall, there will be a spatial fluctuation. You guys probably felt as if it was only a few minutes, but in actual fact, several months have passed.” Ling Yan explained to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was surprised. No wonder she felt that there were rare ripples in the air when the five relics appeared.

“During this period of time, the upper echelons of the various supreme factions have already entered the legacy realm. However, because the Heaven Ascension Sect Master’s legacies were already activated, the high-tier ancient city you were in was sealed off. No one could enter before the legacy is inherited.” Ling Yan chuckled at Ye Qingtang’s puzzled expression.

“I see…” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Ling Yan, did something happen inside the legacy realm during this period?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

“Nothing happened. But I did obtain the legacy of my previous self, as well as the High Monk’s legacy,” Ling Yan said.

“You already know?” Ye Qingtang was surprised. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly. “I’ve been waiting for this day for many years.”

“So everything was part of your plan, including the opening of the Ancient God Karma Tunnel and… possessing Han Cangming’s body…” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan thoughtfully.

“Miss Ye, there are no secrets between us.” Ling Yan stared at Ye Qingtang. “Actually… I’m Han Cangming.”

“You?”

Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan with an indescribable glint in her eyes. She instinctively took a few steps back.

“Miss Ye, don’t panic. I am Han Cangming but I am also the Ling Yan whom you know,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

“What do you mean!” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply.

Ling Yan was very frank and told Ye Qingtang the whole story. After a while, the surprise in Ye Qingtang’s eyes intensified. So the Han Cangming of her era was just a shell that Ling Yan abandoned!

Furthermore, after returning to this era, Ling Yan personally possessed his former self…

“It’s really unbelievable…” Ye Qingtang muttered as she stared at Ling Yan.

Just how shrewd was this man to be able to accomplish this much?

“Miss Ye, do you know how you reincarnated?” Ling Yan suddenly changed the topic.
