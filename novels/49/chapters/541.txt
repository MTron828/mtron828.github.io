Chapter 542 War (2)

Without saying anything, Shuo Tianzang turned into a ray of white light and slashed his sword toward Li Chenfeng, the youngest internal affairs elder in Yunxiao Sect history.

The divine beast was held back by the eight demonic beasts and was assisted by the pale girl, who was nicknamed as the Fiendish Demon. Thus, it could not leave to help Li Chenfeng at the moment.

Almost half of the Yunxiao Sect disciples and wardens in Xuanling Sect were killed by Blood Moon Sect.

If not for the exhaustion caused by Xuanling Sect’s heritage, perhaps the Yunxiao Sect masses still could hold on for some time. However, under the powerful force of the Blood Moon Sect Division, the Yunxiao Sect masses retreated in defeat little by little and could not contend against their opponent.

Boom!

Blood Demon was flung out by the force of Ye You’s blue spirit root.

Subsequently, Ye You flew towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye You did not become Yunxiao Sect’s Holy Lady just because of her martial? talents.

Earlier on, Ye You faintly sensed that the Blood Moon Guardian’s martial aura was not extremely strong. Thus, Ye You thought that perhaps this Blood Moon Guardian had just resurrected not long ago.

Capture the ringleader first in order to capture all his followers. If she could capture the Blood Moon Guardian, none of the Blood Moon Sect members would dare to make any moves rashly.

“Humph!”

Soul Severing Troll scoffed coldly as he looked at Ye You who charged towards them and threw a heavy punch at her. However, Ye You was extremely nimble. She stepped on Soul Severing Troll’s shoulders and struck towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed when she saw Ye You coming for her, and she immediately shifted her body to a side. There was a lot of force in Ye You’s strike, and even the wind from the strike was extremely strong. Although Ye Qingtang dodged the attack, the wind from the strike directly caused Ye

Qingtang’s blood-colored veil to fall.

Looking at the face veil that drifted down, Ye Qingtang knew that there was trouble.

However…

“It’s your!”

The face that was revealed after the face veil dropped caused Ye You to be taken aback for a moment.

Didn’t the face before her right now belong to Ye Qingtang?! How could it be Ye Qingtang?!

At that time, Soul Severing Troll roared in fury and forced Ye You to retreat with his powerful force.

“Ye Qingtang…”

Ye You withdrew herself and leaped away. Her detached eyes were fixed right on Ye Qingtang. Why did she not know that Ye Qingtang had become that so-called Blood Moon Guardian?

In Xuanling Sect, Elder Mo, Elder Qin, and the rest were in disbelief after seeing the face of the Blood Moon Guardian. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

No one would have thought that the Blood Moon Guardian was actually… Ye Qingtang?!

“Isn’t that… Junior Sister Ye…” Zhu Changge, with his mouth agape, stared at Ye Qingtang who was donned in full red that resembled fre.

“Junior Sister Ye? Junior Sister Ye is Blood Moon Sect’s Guardian?” Qin Huan widened his eyes, suspecting if he was hallucinating.

“Impossible… How can Junior Sister Ye be Blood Moon Sect’s Guardian…” Yun Shu shook his head. There was definitely something off in this.

“Qingtang, why did you become the Blood Moon Sect’s Guardian?” The Grand Elder shouted towards the sky.

After hearing his words, the Yunxiao Sect masses immediately looked towards Ye Qingtang.

“This person isn’t a Blood Moon Guardian at all. She is a Xuanling Sect disciple, Ye Qingtang!” Suddenly, a Yunxiao Sect disciple who was once injured by Ye Qingtang shouted loudly.

“WHAT?!”

The Blood Moon Sect Division Head, Jiang Chen, and all Branch Masters stopped their action immediately.

“Ha…” Ye You’s lips curled into a sneer. “Blood Moon Sect has a legendary reputation, but after seeing it today, it doesn’t seem much.”

“What do you mean!” A Blood Moon Branch Master looked at Ye You with a frown.
