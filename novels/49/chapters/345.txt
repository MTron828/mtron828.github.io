Chapter 346: A Starving Camel Is Still Bigger Than A Horse (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At the thought that he would receive a beating every day as long as he was still in the outer sect, the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s heart turned cold instantly.

This girl was clearly a disciple from an orthodox sect. Why was it that she was even more shameless than he, a heretic sect elder, when it came to threatening people!

“I’ll go look for my senior brothers later. You can slowly think about how you want to live from now on.” After finishing her sentence, Ye Qingtang released the Blood Moon Sect Elder and took a glimpse at him with a spurious smile. Then, she turned around and left, seeming to be headed to brief Qin Huan and the rest.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder watched Ye Qingtang’s departing back view and was extremely aggrieved.

What kind of bad luck did he have to meet Ye Qingtang, such a devilish person, in Deer City!

If he knew he was going to meet Ye Qingtang in Deer City, he would have definitely made a detour.

But now…

It was all too late.

After meeting Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Sect Elder originally thought he was lucky and felt that Ye Qingtang was only scaring him.

Yet, the next morning, Qin Huan and Gu Yanqiu appeared before him with a look that harbored evil designs and invited him for a “practice.” The last bit of luck he felt was completely crushed.

When the Blood Moon Sect Elder crawled up with a swollen face, his heart completely crumbled as he watched Qin Huan and Gu Yanqiu bid him goodbye.

“Ye Qingtang! You’re ruthless!”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder finally saw it clearly that Ye Qingtang was real this time. If he did not find a way to enter the inner sect quickly, his life would end right here, much less find an opportunity to absorb essence from other disciples.

Thus, the Blood Moon Sect Elder could only hug his head that swelled into the size of a pig’s head and ran to the Elders’ Hall, puffing.

In the Elders’ Hall, Elder Huang had been in a good mood these few days.

Yuan Wei and Ye Qingtang gave him face in the inner sect assessment a few days ago. Being in a good mood, he was more patient and kind when interacting with other disciples.

“Elder Huang, I heard that Yuan Wei improved quite a lot recently?” The elder from the outer sect’s Array Faction asked with a smile.

“Yuan Wei’s natural endowment was extremely high. Now that he was accepted into the sect, he obviously would not be bad if he trained hard,” Elder Huang said cheerily. Now that Ye Qingtang entered the inner sect, he thought that if Yuan Wei worked hard this year, he would definitely be able to enter the inner sect next year.

As the two elders were chatting, a figure suddenly appeared outside the Elders’ Hall. Before they fixed their eyes on the person, they suddenly realized that the person standing outside the hall was actually a disciple who was badly battered!

The Blood Moon Sect Elder stood outside the Elders’ Hall with a swollen face and looked at Elder Huang. “Elder Huang, I have something to report.”

Elder Huang frowned. “What is it?”

“I wish to attempt the Thunder Array.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder tried to remain calm, but there was a wave of emotions in his heart.

He was a dignified Blood Moon Sect Elder, and yet he was actually forced to go through such misery in the sect by a little girl.

Even spitting a mouthful of blood would not dispel all his pent up frustration.

“Thunder Array?” Elder Huang and the Array Faction’s elder from aside were taken aback.

The Thunder Array was one of the array formations that Xuanling Sect provided for disciples to challenge. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Up to this date, the number of disciples who could solve the Thunder Array could be counted with a hand, and there were barely any who could do so in the inner sect.

This outer sect disciple dared to speak so wildly and challenge the Thunder Array?
