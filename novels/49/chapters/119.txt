Not only was Ye Qingtang not outstanding, but she also ended up in such an ugly position instead.

Looking at the perfectly flawless Invasive Stone, the middle-aged man could not help but sigh.

Ye Qingtang was already placed at the bottom in the third segment. With such results, it would be impossible for her to enter Xuanling Sect with a red spirit root…

“The assessment has ended. All candidates are to move to the entrance of the sect. The results will be announced in a while,” said the middle-aged man without emotion as he brushed away the regret in his heart.

Ye Qingtang stood before the Invasive Stone with a complicated expression, causing one to not understand what was going on.

Upon seeing such an outcome, Lu Xiuwen was already all sneers as he knew that there was no chance for Ye Qingtang to enter the Xuanling Sect with such results. Lucky that he did not need to be bothered about her anymore.

This kind of person was simply not worth his time and energy at all. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Candidates left successively, but Ye Qingtang stood before the Invasive Stone without moving a step.

Looking at the pale face, the middle-aged man could not bear it, but he knew the sect’s strictness. While it was regretful, there was already no way to save the situation.

“Miss Ye, should we leave?” Yun Shu walked forward and looked at Ye Qingtang’s side profile worriedly.

Ye Qingtang suddenly returned to her senses, and after taking a final look at the Invasive Stone, she turned around and left with Yun Shu.

Looking at the two walking away, the middle-aged man shook his head regretfully.

In the sect, the four faction elders all had weird expressions upon witnessing the sight.

Elder Lin sat on a chair and lifted his chin slightly as he looked at Elder Qin with disdain and sarcasm.

Elder Qin had a slightly ugly expression but did not say anything.

Seeing this, the Fist Faction Elder passed a message through the psychic tablet to the middle-aged man in charge of the assessment.

“The assessment has ended. Bring the Invasive Stone down first.”

The Fist Faction was in charge of this segment, and the Invasive Stone was normally used by the Fist Faction disciples for training. Now that the assessment ended, he would obviously want to bring it back.

The middle-aged man heard the message and, without thinking anything else, brought the hanging Invasive Stone down as ordered.

However…

Just when the middle-aged man took the Invasive Stone down, there was suddenly a crisp sound coming from the stone pillar which the Invasive Stone was originally hung on.

The middle-aged man instinctively looked up, and what laid before his eyes stunned him there and then as though he was struck by lightning.

Tiny cracks appeared on the strong and huge stone pillar right in front of him.

From where the Invasive Stone was hung, the tiny cracks stretched to the rest of the stone pillar rapidly as if they were fiery sparks.

In just the blink of an eye, that huge stone pillar split open before his eyes, and tiny cracks directly dismembered the entire stone pillar. Suddenly, countless lumps of gravel fell, and the entire stone pillar collapsed in a moment with a loud bang.

The scene left the middle-aged man completely dumbfounded.

The Invasive Stone was extremely ductile, but the stone pillar was made from white corundum. Even knives and guns would not be able to damage it easily, much less the force of one’s limbs.

However…

It actually turned into a lump of gravel right before his eyes.

The candidates, who had already started talking about the assessment, as well as the four faction elders through the Water Moon Mirror were attracted over by the loud roar.

When they turned around and saw the scattered mess, astonishment was written all over the four elders’ faces!
