Chapter 1369 An Immortal! 2

everyone stood up unsteadily. whether it be the dongfang family or the emperor, everyone looked at ye qingtang with reverence. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

they never thought that they would actually personally see an immortal on earth in their lifetime.

“immortal, i offended you greatly earlier on. please forgive me,” the emperor said hurriedly in fear that his actions made the immortal displeased.

“it’s fine.” ye qingtang waved a hand. she started having thoughts as she looked at the respectful expressions of everyone in the palace.

she still had to accomplish the second mission that the god of nature assigned her, and it would probably be very difficult to complete it alone in a short span of time.

the emperor did not know what ye qingtang was thinking about and merely looked at her silently and cautiously. hesitating, he said, “immortal… the immortality pill that you previously mentioned about…”

previously, when ye qingtang mentioned the immortality pill, the emperor naturally did not believe her. but now…

it was completely different.

wasn’t it an easy feat for this immortal to refine an immortality pill?

ye qingtang was still worried about finding an excuse to ask the emperor for help in accomplishing the second mission. when she heard the emperor saying that, a smile emerged in her eyes, and she put on a calm front.

“i will not go back on my words since i have promised you.”

ye qingtang subsequently retrieved a pill from her space ring.

the emperor obviously did not know about the space ring and was overjoyed when he saw that ye qingtang made a pill appear out of thin air.

“this is the immortality pill that you wished for. you may consume it.” ye qingtang placed that pill in the emperor’s hand indifferently.

excitement filled the emperor’s eyes as he cautiously received the pill and examined it detailedly.

leaving aside the effects of consuming this immortality pill, just the smell of it in his hands cleared his mind and refreshed him.

the emperor kept that “immortality pill” carefully, but a thought occurred to him.

although the immortal said that this was an immortality pill, the emperor was still rather worried as, after all, he once offended her.

“may i know what plans you have in the coming days? my yuan kingdom has always respected immortals greatly. if you don’t mind, you can stay here for a few days. i will immediately order people to prepare a place for you. if you are free, can you preach to my citizens?” the emperor spoke cautiously in a probing tone, and the way he phrased his sentences made him seem to be asking on his citizens’ behalf.in reality, he wanted ye qingtang to remain in the yuan kingdom as firstly, the kingdom would flourish rapidly with an immortal overseeing them.

secondly…

a few decades were needed to see if the immortality pill really had any effect. if the immortal left and he realized that there was something wrong with this pill in the future, he had no one to turn to.

ye qingtang looked at the emperor without any emotions as though she was thinking about his suggestion. however, she was jolly on the inside.

the pill that she gave the emperor just now was merely an ordinary pill in the central mainland and indeed could strengthen one’s body. but immortality??

that was really overthinking it.

in ye qingtang’s original world, as long as one was powerful enough, living for hundreds or thousands of years was not an issue. with the holy lord of shadows’s skills, living up to ten thousand years was also normal.
