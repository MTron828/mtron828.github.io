Chapter 31: Fire Venom (1)

In the past, quite a number of people had tried researching on the applications of those two items. However, it was not until many years later that they managed to grasp a general idea. Thus, though others might grow wary of Ye Qingtang’s bulk purchases, they could never know their purpose for now.

“Your taste is truly…. quite amazing.” Si Bai chuckled. He had no intention to probe further.

Soon, they arrived at the entrance to the Si household. Once having stepped through the entrance, Si Bai clearly sensed something amiss. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Even when they were still along the hallways, Ye Qingtang could hear the commotion coming all the way from the main hall.

“Grandpa, we couldn’t afford to delay his treatment. I’ll negotiate with the Duans to get their Flame Suppressant pill.” A deep voice resounded within the main hall.

“Dr. Xu had already begun his treatment. Getting the Duans to cooperate won’t be easy. Besides, they may seem friendly with us, but that’s only on the surface. Who knows what they’re doing behind our backs. Even if you approach them personally, I doubt they’ll comply.” Old Master Si’s reply followed, with a tone which hinted his distress.

Ye Qingtang and Si Bai threw a glance at each other before they entered the main hall in the next instant.

Aside from Old Master Si, there was another man with a large stature and a dashing look that bore a striking resemblance to Si Bai, though he appeared more matured and robust.

“Bro?” Si Bai was slightly surprised by the man’s presence.

The man was the eldest young lord of the Si household and Si Bai’s oldest brother, Si Ye.

“You’re back.” Si Ye gave a slight nod as he greeted Si Bai.

“Bro, when did you return? I’ve overheard you talking about someone’s treatment…. Where’s Si Qiong?” Si Bai became solemn. Their family’s younger generation consisted only of those three brothers. Si Bai, being the youngest and the one suffering from a frail constitution since birth, was showered with love from his eldest brother, Si Ye, and his older brother, Si Qiong. Thus, the brothers’ relationship was certainly cordial.

Once he asked about Si Qiong, Si Ye’s expression turned grave. He did not answer Si Bai straight away but looked towards Old Master Si instead.

Old Master Si heaved a sigh and said: “Si Qiong’s been wounded by an Ifrit and is poisoned by its fire venom. Dr. Xu’s attending to his injuries at the moment.”

Si Bai faltered for a moment.

An Ifrit’s fire venom was known to be lethal. It could cause an exothermic effect on the vital organs. Dousing that effect with common medications had proven to be ineffective. The fatality rate was almost nine out of ten, where the victim had to literally suffer the burning pain till their lifeforce burned out.

The only cure known at present was to consume an ice lotus, which could only be found growing in the mountains of Yucang.

The mountains of Yucang was a long-haul away from the City of Lin. A round trip would most likely take at least a month. When time is of the essence, bringing an ice lotus all the way back from the mountains would not be a feasible solution.

“I’ve already sent our men to get that ice lotus. What we need now is to borrow the Flame Suppressant pills from the Duan household.” Si Ye knitted his brows as he repeated his plan.

The Flame Suppressant pill, true to its name, were able to delay the effects of the Fire Venom, which would in turn, buy enough time for the retrieval of the ice lotus.

“But Bro, that pill is their family’s heirloom. Like what grandpa mentioned, I doubt they will just give them to you.” Si Bai’s countenance darkened as he stated the fact.

Si Ye’s brows remained knitted. He was fully aware of that obvious fact. But…. without that pill, Si Qiong’s life would no doubt be….

“I could help to suppress that venom.”

When the Si household members were in dire straits, a girl’s voice rang clearly amidst the commotion.

Si Ye turned his attention towards the voice and finally took notice of the girl standing next to Si Bai.

“Who is this lady?” Si Ye asked out of courtesy.

“She’s the young lady of the Ye household, Miss Ye Qingtang.” Si Bai plainly stated.
