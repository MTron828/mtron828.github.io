Chapter 2408: Accident (2)

“Our team cannot go on, but you are part of the Netherworld Academy. Previously, we encountered another Netherworld Academy team and heard from them about your team…”

Lu Yuanxiang paused and nodded at the teenager.

The teenager took out their demon crystals from the space ring. There were over a dozen of them.

“These are the demon crystals we have collected over the past few days. We cannot continue with the competition but we can give these to you… Ye Qing, I know you are a cautious person, unwilling to take risks. But this time, the Netherworld Academy really cannot afford to lose. You have Ran Mo, Qin Feng and the others under you. You guys are our greatest hope. Refining elixirs is important, but please have a bit more courage from now on… this is my only request.”

There were no traces of mockery in Lu Yuanxiang’s words. He was only considering the fate of the Netherworld Academy.

Ye Qingtang took in Lu Yuanxiang’s words and knew that he must have met Qiu Nan’s team earlier.

She sighed. Lu Yuanxiang’s demon crystals were important but how could not take them? They were exchanged with the blood and tears of Lu Yuanxiang’s team. If they gave up their crystals, their results would be zero.

They lost one teammate while everyone else was seriously injured, only to end up with nothing…

These demon crystals were too much of a burden. So she could not bear to take them.

“There’s no need. We have our own demon crystals,” Ye Qingtang replied.

Lu Yuanxiang thought that Ye Qing was just trying to maintain some pride. He continued. “Ye Qing, they told me that you didn’t kill any demons over the past few days. Please accept these demon crystals as a token of our gratitude.”

Ye Qingtang knew what Lu Yuanxiang was saying. To dispel his doubts, she opened her space ring. Inside the space ring were rows of demon crystals. There were dozens of them.

The sight stunned Lu Yuanxiang into silence.

“These… these demon crystals…”

“I appreciate your kind gesture. But I cannot accept your demon crystals. Don’t worry, I will not tarnish the name of our academy.” Ye Qing promised solemnly.

Even without the Sleeping Flower, there would be other ways. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang had all sorts of methods to get to those demons without shedding any blood. This was also why she had been in no hurry from the start.

Even now she had plenty of ideas on how to get more demon crystals. She could not accept these demon crystals, which were stained with so much blood.

Lu Yuanxiang was filled with astonishment. He thought that Ye Qing’s situation was as described by that earlier team. After all, he had personally seen Ye Qing take out so many elixirs. And so it deepened his belief that the youth had spent the entire time preparing elixirs, without making any move against the demons.

But…

He never expected Ye Qing to have obtained so many demon crystals. Several times more than their stash!

Meanwhile, Ye Qing’s team members looked completely unharmed and not at all fatigued.

With much effort, Lu Yuanxiang raised his blood-drenched hands and grasped onto Ye Qing’s hands.

“Ye Qing, it’s all in your hands now! The final hope of the Netherworld Academy rests on you!”

“I will do my best.” Ye Qingtang promised.

Having obtained Ye Qing’s promise, Lu Yuanxiang finally smiled, then he turned and spoke to his team.

“Come, let’s leave this place.”

The teenager with the talisman wiped his tears and nodded. Although reluctant, he knew that they had no other choice.
