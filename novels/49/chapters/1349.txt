Chapter 1350 Traps 1

Ye Qingtang turned back immediately as the animals approached. However, she noticed that there were halos floating behind her, and they were about to disappear.

“Is this the exit?”

The exit was about to disappear.

Ye Qingtang carried the little white tiger and dashed towards the exit instantly.

She did not care whether she could level up immediately. She might not even live for a day here based on her current strength.

The scene in front of her was covered by layers of glints. Ye Qingtang felt the world spinning, and she was back into the constellations on the next second.

The surroundings with intense spirit energy disappeared along with the Heavenly Venerate creatures.

“You came out fast.” The radiant object asked as it saw Ye Qingtang running back from the nine-star constellation.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath secretly, and her back was filled with cold sweat. She started to curse the radiant object in her heart.

Suitable for her?!

The place was extraordinary to level up. However, based on Ye Qingtang’s current ability, she could not even survive inside.

Everything inside was at the Heavenly Venerate stage. Even an insect could be at least at the Arcane Supremacy stage.

Ye Qingtang was only at the First Heaven of the Arcane Supremacy. She might not even know how she was killed inside.

“You were saying that the nine-star constellation was suitable for me?” Ye Qingtang stared at the radiant object, and she could not equate the God of Nature to kindness anymore.

This was just the nine-star constellation. If she entered the ten-star one just now…

Ye Qingtang guessed that she could never return then.

“Isn’t it suitable for you? See, you already have a breakthrough after a few breaths. I did not lie to you.” The radiant object did not sense anything wrong.

“…” Ye Qingtang twitched her lips slightly.

Yes, she thought.

She leveled up in a few breaths of time. If she stayed for a few more seconds, she could be crushed by the Heavenly Venerate creatures.

“Yah, it’s suitable… It was full of Heavenly Venerate creatures. Even a bird could kill me just by flapping its winds,” Ye Qingtang said. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Oh?” The radiant object was silent for a while.

“I assume that the world inside the nine-star constellation has changed and is different from what I know. Though these constellations have a fixed star level, the illusory worlds inside are not fixed. They can transform into another world anytime. I did not expect that you would enter that world…”

The radiant object’s voice sounded very sincere.

It seemed like it totally did not notice that it almost killed Ye Qingtang.

How would she believe it again!

Ye Qingtang did not doubt the God of Nature’s consciousness. However, she was misled into such a trap, and she would not believe it anymore.

She did not know whether the worlds inside these constellations would change. She definitely did not believe that the God of Nature could not sense the world inside the constellation.

The whole mystic realm is formed by its soul. How could it now know about that?

What the hell!

Ye Qingtang was very glad that she did not enter the ten-star constellation out of greed. If not…

Haha…

Ye Qingtang realized that the consciousness of the God of Nature was quite evil. It told her that she could enter and leave the world inside the constellation freely. However, as she came back, the door was about to disappear.
