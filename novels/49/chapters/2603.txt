“Feng Yun family, don’t push us too far!” The Feng family patriarch stared at the white-robed elder and gritted his teeth. “Although your Feng Yun family is powerful, we will not let you slaughter us. We will never let you take Feng Wuyin as a blood sacrifice. At most, we’ll fight you to the death!”

“Fight to the death?”

The elder in white said impassively, “I’m afraid that you can’t stop us even if you all die fighting. Besides, I’ve already made it very clear that Feng Wuyin satisfies the criteria for being a blood sacrifice to the Heavenly Demons. Who do you think my Feng Yun family works for?”

Everyones’ expressions changed.

It was no secret that the Heavenly Demon Tribe was one of the strongest factions in the Divine Venerate Domain. In the Divine Venerate Domain, they had the power to cover the sky with one hand and stir up storms. Furthermore, the Heavenly Demon Tribe was distributed throughout the entire Divine

Venerate Domain. Apart from a few other factions who were just as powerful, who would dare to provoke the Heavenly Demon Tribe?!

The Feng Yun family had always been working for a branch of the Heavenly Demon Tribe, but even if it was just a branch, no one dared to provoke it. Its strength was too powerful and was on a completely different level from small factions like them.

Seeing the shocked expressions on the Feng family’s faces, the white-clothed elder continued, “Therefore, Feng family patriarch, you have to consider carefully. If you don’t hand over the person, who are you making enemies with? Not only will you be exterminated, you won’t be able to protect Feng

Wuyin either.”

The Feng family looked at each other in dismay.

They understood clearly what the white-robed elder meant. Going against the Heavenly Demon Tribe was indeed no different from courting death. They would definitely suffer extermination. Even so, how could they hand just Feng Wuyin over?! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Dream on!”

suddenly, the young Feng Jiuyou drew his sword and pointed it at the white-robed elder and his men. He roared furiously, “You bunch of villains, even if I have to fight to the end, I won’t let you take Wuyin away!”

“Tt looks like you will not see reason until the moment right before your own death.”

‘When the white-robed elder saw the Feng family’s reaction, he immediately waved his sleeve.

In the next second, the martial arts practitioners who had already surrounded the Feng family leapt forward.

“Defend!”

The Feng family patriarch shouted.

The Feng Yun family was much stronger than the Feng family, especially that elder in white. He was already at the Eighth Heaven level Divine Lord! If the Feng family were to fight head-on, it would be impossible for them to win. Now, the only thing they could do was defend.

However, even if they just purely defended themselves, it was still extremely strenuous for the Feng family to face the Feng Yun family. Defense alone was still very difficult.

In just a few breaths’ time, the Feng family members were all sent flying across the air by the Feng Yun fighters. Even Feng Jiuyou suffered some light injuries.

“Brother Jiuyou... are you okay?”

Feng Wuyin hurriedly stepped forward and helped Feng Jiuyou up from the ground.

“Wuyin, don’t worry. We won’t let you be taken away as a blood sacrifice!” Feng Jiuyou stood up and looked at Feng Wuyin.

“Brother Jiuyou, you’re injured...”

“Father!!”

Before Feng Wuyin could say anything, Feng Jiuyou shouted loudly with a shocked expression.

Father Feng was knocked to the ground by an expert from the Feng Yun family. A sharp sword slashed mercilessly at Father Feng’s neck.

However, at this moment, a sigh came from nowhere. “We should show mercy whenever we can.”

It was just a sigh, but the soul of the Feng Yun fighter who was holding a long sword against Father Feng’s neck, trembled at it..
