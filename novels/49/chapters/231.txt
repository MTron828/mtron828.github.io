The Apothecary’s face darkened further as his lips curled into a sneer. “Lord Ye, you’re overthinking. If I were really Village Master Wu, why would I need to kill the surrounding citizens? What benefit will that bring me?”

Zhou Xuan, who had been standing aside all this while, walked towards Ye Qingtang at this time as well. What Ye Qingtang said just now really shocked him. “Junior Sister Ye, what the hell are you saying? If you don’t dare to investigate on your own, just say it. There’s no need to come up with such a ridiculous excuse.”

The Apothecary was Wu Chengze?

And he even killed all the citizens nearby and replaced them?

What was the intention of reducing himself from a Village Master to a citizen? He would not do this unless he was crazy.

Increasingly, Zhou Xuan felt that Ye Qingtang was speaking carelessly and that it was only because she did not dare to investigate the plague-filled corpses. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Zhou Xuan walked forward and glanced at Ye Qingtang with a belittling expression. Then, he was about to say something, but Ye Qingtang gave him a cold glare before he could say anything.

“Zhou Xuan, if you want to die, no one is stopping you. Don’t show off your useless brain here.”

“You!” Zhou Xuan widened his eyes unbelievably as he did not expect Ye Qingtang to speak so rudely to him.

It should be known that while he tried making things difficult for Ye Qingtang throughout the journey, she was still very obedient.

Why is she acting like a madwoman today!

“Ye Qingtang, do you know what rubbish are you spouting! You said he is Wu Chengze? Why? Is Wu Chengze crazy or dumb? He gave up his position as a Village Master to become an ordinary citizen? And he even made a scene of such scale? I think you’re the one who is really crazy!” Zhou Xuan retorted.

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to look at Zhou Xuan as she fixed her eyes on the sullen Apothecary with a cold smirk.

“Yeah… He was a Village Master, and why would he drag his family into pretending as citizens? And then purposely lead us here to investigate the case…”

“I am asking you a question. Why are you asking me back one?” Zhou Xuan scoffed.

Ye Qingtang chuckled as she glanced across the faces of the other somber citizens.

“Thousands of years ago, there were many sects vying for supremacy, but one sect stood above all. It was the Blood Moon Sect. The Blood Moon Sect topped the world with its black magic, consuming humans’ blood and essence and eating humans’ flesh to nourish themselves. They mastered the extreme evil cultivation techniques and raised countless of demonic creatures, causing great chaos. For peace and stability, all the sects and many mighty figures combined forces to exterminate the Blood Moon Sect.

“They did everything to wipe out the Blood Moon Sect from the world completely. To prevent the Blood Moon Sect from resurrecting, sects and mighty figures joined hands to suppress the soul of the Blood Moon Sect’s backbones in various areas so that it would never appear in the world again. Then, they incised inscriptions of a sealed soul on the tablet as a mean of suppression…”

Ye Qingtang spoke clearly, neither fast nor slow, as she recounted the history that had been buried for thousands of years.

Zhou Xuan frowned and completely did not understand why Ye Qingtang suddenly mentioned the Blood Moon Sect, which had been exterminated long ago. However, he did not notice that as Ye Qingtang spoke, the Apothecary’s face turned from white to black, and an intense murderous look filled his eyes.

Ye Qingtang slowly looked up and straight at the Apothecary, whose eyes spelled death. “At the cliff behind Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, the tablet used to suppress the evil spirit had already broken. The soul which had been sealed for thousands of years required large amounts of essence and blood to make up for its loss…”
