The Feng Yun fighter with the long sword frowned and looked around. But he did not see anyone.

After glancing around, the Feng Yun fighter realized that everyone else was behaving normally. Could he have been hallucinating just now.

‘The Feng Yun fighter immediately gathered his wits. With a sharp glint in his eye, he slashed his sword at Father Feng again.

At this moment, a snow-white figure flashed over.

Before anyone noticed anything, they heard a clear “clang”.

When everyone returned to their senses, they realized that Ye Qingtang was standing in front of Father Feng with a calm expression. She did not move but was blocking the sharp sword of the powerful Feng Yun fighter with two fingers.

“Sister Ye Yue!”

Feng Wuyin’s expression changed when he saw Ye Qingtang.

“Sister Ye Yue, you’re not a match for them...” Feng Jiuyou also shouted.

Although Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou were young, they were still at the Divine Lord stage after all. Ye Qingtang came from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and was clearly lagging behind compared to them. How could cultivators from the Second Domain fight with practitioners from the Divine

Venerate Domain?

Furthermore, this was the Feng Yun family, backed by the colossal power of a branch of the Heavenly Demon Tribe.

“Who are you!”

‘The Feng Yun fighter shouted sternly as his gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was expressionless as she said indifferently, “Didn’t you hear the two little fellows calling me Ye Yue just now?”

“You’re not from the Feng family?” The eyes of that Feng Yun fighter flickered coldly. This person was really audacious. To think that she dared to interfere in the Feng Yun family’s business?

“You are from the Feng Yun family?” Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought. She had never heard of them. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Everyone, on my account, please let the Feng family off today, okay?” Ye Qingtang said after a moment of silence.

Ye Qingtang had not wanted to interfere in this matter. After all, everything that was happening now was already set in history. If she did anything, it would very likely change history and something irreversible might happen. There was no way for her to be certain. Perhaps... there would be

earth-shaking changes to her era. It was even possible that she might not be born due to these changes in history.

However, Ye Qingtang could not bear to see Feng Wuyin being taken away as a blood sacrifice in front of her eyes.

“On your account?”

‘The white-robed elder from the Feng Yun family smiled as he sized up Ye Qingtang. “Who are you to ask this of us?”

“Ye Yue, this matter has nothing to do with you. You’re just a traveling martial arts practitioner from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. You are being too audacious. Hurry up and apologize to the Feng Yun family!” Feng Cang shouted angrily.

‘The Feng Yun family only wanted Feng Wuyin and would not exterminate the rest of the Feng Family. However, this woman was extremely audacious and dared to interfere. Who knew if she would anger the Feng Yun family or even the Heavenly Demon Tribe branch power.

“Mixed Heavens Holy Domain... You are saying that this woman is from Mixed Heavens Holy Domain?”

‘The Feng Yun family practitioners roared with laughter.

It had truly been an interesting day.. A mere martial arts practitioner from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain came to the Divine Venerate Domain and expected them to listen to her?
