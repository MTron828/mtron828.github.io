Chapter 2693: Customer, Do You Want To Buy Something? (1)

This situation was unacceptable to everyone.

If it were some ordinary weapons, it wouldn’t have mattered that much. But these were Heaven-level divine weapons!

“Heh, we might as well not have entered this shop.” The purple-haired young man scoffed.

“Senior Brother Zhou Yun is right. I’d rather have never seen these divine weapons. Now, I don’t want to ever leave this shop.” A disciple sighed softly.

“Senior Brother Lan Shan, quickly… your chance has come!” Zhou Yun’s gaze landed on Lan Shan.

Lan Shan was taken aback. He didn’t quite understand what Zhou Yun meant.

“What do you mean?” Lan Shan asked.

“Senior Brother Lan Shan, isn’t your biggest wish to open a weapons shop? Now is your chance. This weapons shop will be yours from now on.” Zhou Yun chuckled.

“Get lost.” Lan Shan glanced at Zhou Yun. Who would want to be a shopkeeper of a shop where no one could bring anything out?

“Senior Brothers and Sisters, what should we do now? Are we going to just watch as these Heaven-level divine weapons are left here and collecting dust?” A young and shy Great Immortal Temple disciple asked Ye Qingtang and the rest.

“What else can we do? We can’t take them out.” Lan Shan shrugged.

Everyone present felt their hearts ache. However, there was nothing they could do.

“Senior Brother!”

At that moment, a Great Immortal Temple disciple ran out from another shop nearby. He stared at Lan Shan and the others excitedly. “I went to another shop just now. Do you… Do you want to know what’s inside?”

Zhou Yun glanced at the disciple and said indifferently, “Scram. I don’t want to know.”

“Don’t tell us!” Lan Shan covered his ears in despair. He also did not want to know!

“I must say it!” The man looked excited. “There are so many immortal stones… not only that but there are also many manuals describing array formations and even… one with a heaven-defying divine power. Unfortunately, I can’t open the secret manuals… oh right, there’s also…”

“Shut up,” Lan Shan said fiercely, covering his ears.

“It’s not like we can bring them out. Stop telling us!” Wan Rong glanced at the man. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Yes, I can’t bring them out of the shop… I nearly suffered internal injuries from the impact just now.” The man sighed, his eyes filled with disappointment.

As they spoke, a strange “crack” sound came from inside the weapons shop, as if something hard had crashed into the ground.

Everyone instinctively looked inside the shop.

After a few breaths, a pale skeleton appeared.

“Get ready!” Lan Shan shouted.

In the next second, all the Great Immortal Temple disciples gathered around Lan Shan.

The skeleton was standing in the shop. Its empty eyes swept across the crowd. Soon afterward, everyone saw that the skeleton opened its mouth.

Although no sound came out, a strange voice was mentally transmitted to everyone’s minds.

“Customers, what can I do for you?”

This was the general gist of the voice echoing in their minds.

“What… are you?” Lan Shan frowned deeply as he stared at the terrifying skeleton standing in the shop.

“Hello Customers… I am… the shopkeeper of this weapons shop… Sir… do you need weapons… the weapons in our shop… are not very good, only Heaven-level… but… the price is fair.”

The voice floated in everyone’s minds.

Even Ye Qingtang was surprised.
