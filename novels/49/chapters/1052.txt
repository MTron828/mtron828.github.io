Chapter 1053 Beiming Manor (4)

This so-called Ye Family was a disorderly mob. Could it be that it had never heard of the three mighty forces of this mainland!

Everyone still had a certain level of fear towards the Beiming Manor; thus, the Ye Family Branch Master remained silent.

After all, Ye Family only had one Yang Lord while Beiming Manor had more than one!

Seeing that the Ye Family Branch Master no longer spoke, the Beiming Manor envoy nodded in satisfaction. Nonetheless, he was still curious as to why a Yang Lord, who even seemed so young, appeared out of nowhere when there was only a handful of Yang Lords on this mainland…

“You are the Yang Lord of the Ye Family!” The Beiming Manor envoy looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

“Yes, so what if I am?” Ye Qingtang replied indifferently.

She did not have any enmity with Beiming Manor and did not wish to complicate matters by having any relations with Beiming Manor. However, if Beiming Manor failed to appreciate her favor and insisted on poking their nose into this matter, it was fine with Ye Qingtang as well.

Ye Qingtang had never liked causing trouble, but this did not mean that she was afraid of trouble!

“Good. Not bad. It is indeed unbelievable that you can become a Yang Lord at such a young age… My Beiming Manor admires you greatly. If you’re willing, you can join my Beiming Manor, and you can freely choose any position that you want!” The Beiming Manor envoy looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

In other territories, the Beiming Manor envoy represented the entire Beiming Manor, and everything he said was equivalent to what the Beiming Manor Chief said. Thus, since he said that, it was definitely effective.

The three mighty forces of this mainland would all wish to snatch this Yang Lord. Regardless of the Phantom Valley, Peerless School, or Beiming Manor, their control and power would become even more powerful if they had an additional Yang Lord!

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Beiming Manor envoy and said with a seeming smile. “Do you mean what you say?”

“Of course, I do.” Arrogance filled the Beiming Manor envoy’s face. “I am a Beiming Manor envoy, and everything I say represents the Beiming Manor. As long as you are willing to join and dedicate yourself to my Beiming Manor, you can pick any position you want in Beiming Manor!”

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang said. “If that’s the case, I want the Beiming Manor Chief position. Do you think it’s possible?”

Everyone at the scene was stunned by Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang actually wanted to become the Beiming Manor Chief…

“What are you saying?!” The Beiming Manor envoy’s eyes were ice cold. This girl was so young yet so arrogant and conceited to want the Beiming Manor Chief position?!

Although Ye Qingtang was not familiar with the three mighty forces of this mainland, she was very clear with their routine.

Phantom Valley, Beiming Manor, and Peerless School were currently in a state of check and balance, and no one wished to break this balance.

However, if Ye Qingtang chose to join one side, this balance would definitely be broken.

Even if Ye Qingtang joined Beiming Manor, it would definitely not believe an outsider, especially when this outsider, was a Yang Lord. Once this Yang Lord had any ideas, it was very possible that it would result in a serious imbalance.

Moreover, Phantom Valley and Peerless School would face a relatively serious threat with Ye Qingtang’s addition to Beiming Manor. By then, Peerless School and Phantom Valley would definitely join forces to annihilate Beiming Manor!
