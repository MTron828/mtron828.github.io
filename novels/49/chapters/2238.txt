The news released by the Temple of Paragon gave the location of the fiendcelestial’s tomb, but it did not specify where the entrance was. To locate the entrance as soon as possible, the various factions split up to comb through the entire mountain.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Several figures quietly snuck over as the factions were searching for the entrance.

“Are you sure you saw them head this way?” Yun Chen furrowed his brows slightly, his handsome face covered with bruises of varying sizes.

“I’m sure.” Nangong Lie had an eight trigrams plate in his hand with a strand of hair on it.

Lei Yan, Jing Ze and Qin Feng were also present. The Rising Dragon Island had let them go because of Mu Ziying’s threat. But they could not just stand by and let her get kidnapped.

“Are we really not going to tell Boss about this first?” Lei Yan was hesitant..

“Little Senior Sister was captured. Don’t you know what kind of people the Rising Dragon Island are? If we delay, Little Senior Sister might not be able to make it back alive,” Nangong Lie said.

They were all very anxious after Mu Ziying was captured. After a discussion, they decided to go looking for her.

After all...

The Rising Dragon Island was notorious and about their Boss’ powers... To be honest, every single one of them was even more powerful than Boss.

Those teenagers did not dare to get too close. They followed the faction from a safe distance.

There were many people from the various factions and the mountain was not that big. Before long, someone spread the news that they had found the entrance to the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

All the factions swarmed toward the location.

It was a massive stone door hidden in the middle of the mountain. The door was covered in moss and other plants. It would have been easy to overlook it if one was not careful.

“I will open the door.” The eyes of the leader of the beast race flashed. Charging forward, he used his huge body to ram against the door.

But the door did not even budge. As hard as the beast race leader tried. he was unable to move it at all.

Seeing this, the other factions all stepped forward to try and open the door. But no matter how many people tried and how much effort they put in, the door remained unmoving.

“It’s not that easy to open the door to the fiendcelestial’s tomb.” The child from Black Moon Palace spoke up.

Everyone immediately stopped.

A small figure slowly walked out of the carriage on the massive beast.

It was a child who looked about five to six years old. His chubby face looked pink and tender, but his eyes were full of maliciousness.

“It’s him? The Black Moon Palace has really gone all out this time. They even sent the demon child.”

Previously, the crowd had their doubts about the identity of the person inside the carriage. But now, everyone’s faces grew solemn at the sight of the child.

The Black Moon Palace had a very miraculous skill. One had to start practicing it when one was still a very young child. The skill would stabilize after the child grew a little older, and he would never age from then on but maintain in a child-like form.

Those who looked very young inside the Black Moon Palace were actually very powerful.

This demon child in front of them was one of the four biggest powers of the Black Moon Palace. It was rumored that this demon child had already reached the Divine Lord Seventh Heaven level.

After the Divine Lord stage, the difference between each Heaven level was very wide. As wide as the difference between two major stages.

The various factions had sent their men here because of the Temple of Paragon’s edict, plus they were on the same mainland as the Temple of Paragon. So they had all exercised restraint.
