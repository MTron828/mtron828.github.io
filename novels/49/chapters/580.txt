Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang stared at the temple and frowned. She seemed to be facing her greatest enemy.

“How is it possible… We ran for so long, and we still end up at the same place?! Is there an illusion array? Is that why we can’t get out of this place?” the Blood Moon Elder said in disbelief.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

There was no energy turbulence of an array in their surroundings, so they were not trapped in an array formation.

“We have… all sinned!” the Blood Moon Elder said softly suddenly and walked towards the temple.

“Blood Moon Elder?” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes as she stared at the Blood Moon Elder.

“I have committed many sins… I shall use my blood to redeem my sins…”

The Blood Moon Elder suddenly knelt in front of the temple and murmured. His face and eyes were full of regret.

“This is bad…”

Ye Qingtang did not hesitate anymore. She stepped forward and stopped behind the Blood Moon Elder instantly.

Ye Qingtang used her palm and hit the Blood Moon Elder. He lost his consciousness and fell.

Ye Qingtang did not have other choices. He would kill himself if she did not hit him.

Ye Qingtang planned to bring the Blood Moon Elder away from this place, but suddenly, she heard a voice.

The voice sounded like the chanting of ancient gods, and one could not hear any other voice on earth.

Ye Qingtang felt her body was stiff.

“I… have sinned…”

Ye Qingtang murmured and dragged her stiff body forward a few meters. She knelt down on the ground when she reached the front of the temple.

There was an elegant stone buddha in the temple. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The buddha suddenly opened its eyes and said softly, “You have sinned the moment you are born.”

“I… have sinned…”

Ye Qingtang was filled with sadness all of a sudden.

“You need to use your blood to wash off your sins.” The soft voice of the buddha appeared again.

“Use my blood…” Ye Qingtang’s eyesight was firm.

Clank!

The Demonic Blood Sword was held in her hand.

The Demonic Blood Sword was placed beside her neck at the next second. She could chop off her head at any moment.

Suddenly, the blood moon at her glabella suddenly appeared, and a strong force surrounded her.

A tall shadow appeared through her blood moon at the same time.

It was a cold man with silver hair. His eyes were expressionless, and they seemed to be able to suppress everything in the world.

“Break!” The shadow shouted and broke the delusive voice.

A ball of strong energy exploded out of her blood moon as the shadow’s voice spread out. The energy surrounded Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed, and her entire life was replaying inside her brain.

She had never done anything harmful since she was born. She only killed those who intended to murder her. She had never hurt anyone innocent…

“Where… is my sin!” Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth and struggled to get up from the ground.

Her birth was a part of nature’s rule and the result of human reproduction. There was no sin.

She had never hurt anyone innocent in her entire life. There was no sin!

Even the buddha could not accuse her of any sin.

“Where… is my sin!” Ye Qingtang’s eyesight changed from confusion to firmness. Her eyes sparkled, and there was no trace of uncertainty at all.
