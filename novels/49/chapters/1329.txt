1330 You Are On Your Own 2

Ye Qingtang’s question shocked the Eldest Prince and the others.

“Elder Ye, what do you mean? Are these documents forgeries?” The Eldest Princess looked bewildered.

“I wrote them,” Ye Qingtang said casually as she slowly put down her teacup.

The eyes of the Eldest Prince and Princess immediately widened in shock.

“These… were written by you, Elder Ye?” The Eldest Prince looked incredulous.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“But the seals…” The Eldest Prince looked at the seals on the letters.

Ye Qingtang flicked her wrist and threw the seals she had carved earlier in front of the Eldest Prince.

“If you like them, you can take these and seal a few more letters.”

The Eldest Prince and Princess hurriedly took the two seals and examined them again and again. Compared to the original seals, these seals were made from different materials, but their carvings and details were all identical. No one would be able to tell the difference when they were used to seal letters.

The Eldest Prince and Princess were shocked.

They thought that Ling Yan was seeking his own death. They had not imagined that Ye Qingtang had forged these documents.

What was even scarier was that even they could not tell that the documents were forgeries.

If Ye Qingtang had not told them, they certainly would not think of it.

Ye Qingtang had lived for three hundred years in her previous life and spent a long time in Central Mainland. She also happened to know General Wu Hu, but in her previous life, General Mo had not yet died, and Wu Hu was just an ordinary officer. Ye Qingtang had seen his handwriting and also happened to see his seal.

Otherwise, how would she have known about the connection between Wu Hu and Ling Yan?

As for Ling Yan…

Ye Qingtang was extremely familiar with his handwriting, and forging it was easy.

In the three hundred years of her past life, Ye Qingtang had learned various things. Things like forging handwriting and stamps were child’s play to her…

“Show them to the Emperor,” said Ye Qingtang.

They had prepared for a long time, all for this step.

The Eldest Prince and Princess exchanged glances. They did not linger and hurried to the palace with these documents.

When Lady Ghost looked at Ye Qingtang, her expression was also filled with surprise. She had been rather curious as to where Ye Qingtang’s plans were leading, but she had not expected…

That Ye Qingtang was already all prepared.

Even if the Eternal Emperor was suspicious, the handwriting and seals were identical. It would be difficult for Ling Yan to argue.

“Tell me when there’s news. I’m going to rest.” Ye Qingtang did not seem to notice the shock in Lady Ghost’s eyes. She lazily stood up and slowly walked to her room.

“Ah Yao is so clever.” Ming Gu’s eyes flashed in excitement as he watched Ye Qingtang’s disappearing figure.

He knew that nothing was too difficult for Ah Yao.

Ah Yao was just the way she used to be… 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lady Ghost gave a small smile, but she secretly looked towards Ming Wang’s position. But at some point, Ming Wang, who had been hiding in a secret spot, had vanished completely.

When Ye Qingtang returned to her room and ensured that no one had followed her, she immediately took out the voice transmission stone.

“Ling Yan, I’m about to act.” Ye Qingtang called him softly and spoke.

Ling Yan’s laughter rang out from the voice transmission stone. His agreeable voice was warm and held a hint of amusement.

“I suppose my siblings are now greatly indebted to Miss Ye’s kindness. Miss Ye, no need to be merciful. Give it your best shot.”
