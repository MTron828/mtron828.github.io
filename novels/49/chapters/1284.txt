Chapter 1285: The Eternal Dynasty (2)

The Eldest Prince hurriedly carried the Eldest Princess away. However, after they left the palace and got into a sedan, the Eldest Princess suddenly recovered. She casually wiped the tear stains from her eyes and took out powder to repair her exquisitely made-up face, as if no one else was around. She also removed her mourning attire.

“Eldest Royal Sister, your acting skills are truly admirable.” The Eldest Prince laughed softly as he watched his younger sister swiftly change her appearance.

The Eldest Princess glanced at the Eldest Prince and laughed. “Royal Brother, is what you said true? The guests from the Temple of Shadows have arrived?”

“Naturally.” The Eldest Prince nodded with a smile.

The Eldest Princess nodded slightly. “That’s good. Our Royal Father spoiled our Fourth Royal Brother and made him crown prince over everyone’s protests. He did not expect our Fourth Royal Brother to be so unfortunate as to die after having been crown prince for only a few months.”

The Eldest Prince laughed softly and said, “Our Fourth Royal Brother was too young and needed more training. It was inappropriate for our Royal Father to allow him to become crown prince so early. Nonetheless… since Fourth Royal Brother is already dead, we will say no more… However, our Second Royal Sister has recently grown even closer to the Grand Advisor.”

“Hmph.” The Eldest Princess laughed coldly. “Second Royal Sister is too ambitious. The Advisor is from the Sacred Ground of Reflection. She thinks that by seeking support from the Advisor, she will receive aid from the Sacred Ground of Reflection. However… it won’t be that easy for her to achieve her desires…”

A malicious look flashed across the Eldest Princess’s eyes.

After a while, the carriage stopped at the residence of the Eldest Prince.

The Eldest Prince and Princess alighted and went directly towards the main hall.

Three figures were already sitting in the main hall of the Eldest Prince’s residence.

The moment the Eldest Prince and Princess saw the three figures seated in the main hall, they hurried over to greet them.

“Honored guests from the Divine Temple, we are sorry to keep you waiting. Please excuse us.” The Eldest Prince went forward with a smile and bowed apologetically.

The Eldest Princess also bowed.

Ye Qingtang, who was sitting in the main hall, quietly observed the two people who were next in line to the throne of the Eternal Dynasty. On the way here, she had vaguely heard about them from Lady Ghost.

The cooperation between the Temple of Shadows and the Eternal Dynasty was essentially selecting the most suitable prince to ascend the throne of the Eternal Dynasty.

In this generation, the Temple of Shadows had chosen the Eldest Prince, Ling Feng.

The Eternal Dynasty’s emperor was getting old and infirm. In recent years, the position of crown prince had been vacant, with the various princes and princesses jockeying for the highest position.

Not long ago, the Emperor of the Eternal Dynasty had suddenly selected a crown prince.

He had made his most beloved Fourth Prince the crown prince of the Eternal Dynasty. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Guardian Lady Ghost, it has been a long time. How are you…” The Eldest Princess greeted Lady Ghost. She had previously met Lady Ghost once and so knew who she was.

She was also very happy to see Lady Ghost.

Their chances of victory were slightly greater now that the Temple of Shadows had sent their guardian.

Lady Ghost smiled and nodded. She introduced the Eldest Prince and Princess. “This is the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows, Ming Gu.”

The Eldest Prince and Princess were taken aback and bowed to Ming Gu.

“Greetings, Holy Son Ming Gu.”

So far, the most senior member of the Temple of Shadows that they had met was Lady Ghost, and they had only met her once. They had not expected even the Holy Son to be dispatched!
