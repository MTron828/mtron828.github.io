“It’s quite possible that they dug the spirit stones from underground.” Ye Qingtang looked around their surroundings, quickly deciding on a few fat catfishes with larger builds. She gave Jiang Shaobai some instructions and the two immediately started making their moves.

Jiang Shaobai was sharp-witted and could quickly pick it up with ease. With Ye Qingtang’s guidance, they didn’t have to spend much time and effort to win big at the gambling town.

Ye Qingtang even took Jiang Shaobai with her and they disguised themselves in order to not be recognized by the fat catfishes.

But soon, Ye Qingtang realized that there wasn’t even a need for her to do so...

These fat catfishes had odd personalities. It seemed that they really had no other hobbies other than gambling. Even if they lost in a bet, they wouldn’t be that affected and would be energetic again in just a matter of time.

She had witnessed a few fat catfishes having extremely bad luck, losing almost every bet but they could still continue betting without feeling dejected at all.

As for Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai, they weren’t that obsessive over betting.

Fu Qiu hadn’t demanded as many spirit stones this time, but after experiencing the benefit of using spirit stones in cultivation, Ye Qingtang wouldn’t stop at just winning enough spirit stones for their stay at the Crystal Palace. She took Jiang Shaobai with her, going around to win more than 6000 spirit stones before she finally stopped.

With their disguised appearances, they prepared to head back to the Crystal Palace when they spotted two figures right outside the Crystal Palace.

It was a young girl with an exquisite appearance standing in front of a tall, middle-aged man. They were debating over something with Fu Qiu.

When Ye Qingtang walked over, she saw the young girl’s face flushing red from her anger.

“Isn’t it 500 spirit stones a day? Why did you suddenly raise the price?” The young girl’s cheeks puffed up.

“A thousand a day, if you can’t pay, you can leave,” Fu Qiu said irritably.

Ye Qingtang hadn’t expected to meet another human here, but she wasn’t interested in staying curious. She walked into the Crystal Palace with Jiang Shaobai, taking out a few bunches of spirit stones and handing them to Fu Qiu.

Fu Qiu counted the spirit stones, making sure it was enough before it let the two people in. However, when it saw Ye Qingtang’s beautiful face become an extremely ugly one, it was stunned.

What happened?

It only took one night and this lass became so ugly?

Fu Qiu was still shocked when the girl noticed that Ye Qingtang had a pocket full of spirit stones. Her eyes instantly lit up.

“Hold on!” The girl called out.

“Yes? Is there anything I can help you with?” Now that Ye Qingtang looked at the girl nearby, she noticed that the girl’s facial features were incredibly good-looking and exuded a noble aura.

However...

She could sense that the girl was demanding and wasn’t a fan of such people. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“You have many spirit stones?” The girl’s eyes landed on Ye Qingtang’s pocket.

Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly.

“I’ll exchange with you.” Before Ye Qingtang could even answer, the girl signaled at the tall man beside her.

The man stepped forward, taking out a huge amount of taels from the space ring. When she saw the taels, Ye Qingtang almost laughed out loud.

Using taels in a mystic realm? Was she even normal?
