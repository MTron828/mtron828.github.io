Chapter 489: Elder Lin (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Master… No. You have already betrayed the sect and no longer are my Master!” Then, Zhu Changge flew to the front of Ye Qingtang and glared at Elder Lin as he said in anger. “On account that you have taught me, I persuade you to turn round. What lays ahead is a sea of misery without any shore. If you still don’t stop now, you will be beyond redemption!”

As he spoke, the other Xuanling Sect disciples rushed forward at the same time and protected Ye Qingtang behind them.

“Impudent!” Elder Lin bellowed coldly. In an instant, the disciples were sent flying from his endless martial aura.

Given the skills of Zhu Changge and these inner sect disciples, it was impossible for them to block a sect elder.

Although they wanted to protect Ye Qingtang’s, the gap between their skills and Elder Lin’s was too wide. There was no battle to begin with…

“Ye Qingtang, I want to see who can save you today!” Elder Lin looked at Ye Qingtang with an icy laugh as though he had already beheaded Ye Qingtang.

Swoosh!

As he finished his sentence, his long knife was slashed towards Ye Qingtang once again.

However, as the knife was halfway in its motion, an unknowing evil force emerged in Elder Lin’s body.

“Yes.”

Instinctively, Elder Lin stopped in his tracks and looked down at his chest.

Boom! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Almost at the same time Elder Lin looked down, a horrifying explosive sound reverberated in the air of the scene.

A cloud of dust was spinning in the wind, and the entire view was covered by the dust.

Ye Qingtang looked at the cloud of dust ahead with a strange expression. Expressions of confusion were etched on her face.

Why did that Elder Lin suddenly explode out of nowhere…

Ye Qingtang walked forward slowly and picked up a broken shard on the ground.

“This is…”

Ye Qingtang inspected the shard of glass in her hand, and there was an expression of surprise in her eyes.

“Revolving Soul Orb?!”

The broken shard in her hands seemed extremely familiar to her eyes, and she quickly recalled that it seemed to be the Revolving Soul Orb that she handed to Elder Qin.

“That’s strange. I clearly handed the Revolving Soul Orb to Elder Qin back then. Why did it appear in Elder Lin’s hands today and even produce a spirit energy explosion…” Ye Qingtang tilted her head, unable to comprehend.

The Revolving Soul Orb was extremely rare on this mainland. Apart from the one that she handed to Elder Qin, there should not be another one in Xuanling Sect.

Moreover, according to Ye Qingtang’s understanding, Elder Qin and Elder Lin had always been on bad terms, and Elder Qin would definitely not gift the Revolving Soul Orb to Elder Lin.

Ye Qingtang was in deep thought for a moment and thought that there was only one possibility.

Perhaps Elder Lin stole the Revolving Soul Orb when Elder Qin was unprepared, but Ye Qingtang still could not think of the reason for its explosion at the moment.

“What a great Blood Moon Sect Elder. When you gave me the Revolving Soul Orb back then, you probably already have calculated that it would explode.” Ye Qingtang sneered.

However, Elder Lin suffered the result of that little slyness that the Blood Moon Sect Elder pulled in her place.

The dust faded away very quickly, and Elder Lin’s figure appeared once again from it.

However, Elder Lin was covered in blood while his hair was charred and disheveled. His abdomen area, especially, was badly mangled, and his left arm was entirely shattered from the explosion.

At that instant, Elder Lin panted heavily, and his body trembled violently. Disbelief filled his eyes.

He could not understand what exactly caused the Revolving Soul Orb that he stole from Elder Qin to explode and severely injure him.

From afar, Qin Huan, Zhu Changge, and the rest were dumbfounded as they looked at Elder Lin.

“Elder Lin… self-destructed?” Qin Huan was astonished.
