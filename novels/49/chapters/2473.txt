Chapter 2474: Ancestor Qing (1)

The people with Ye Qingtang were extremely cautious as well. Even though they had managed to trick the two demons, there was still the general.

Everything would be settled if they managed to trick the general. But if they failed to convince him, they would be dead before the other demons even got to them.

“Boss, I’m done.”

Yun Chen looked at her.

“Very good, come back,” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and said.

After all the preparations had been made, all that was left was for General Zang to open the door.

“Could I stop being the Yongle emperor? How about someone else plays the role? I don’t think I’m acting it out well.” The Flying Star Academy teacher looked at Ye Qing and the rest of them.

It was a stretch for him to even imitate a follower. They thought too highly of him to have him play the emperor.

“What are you talking about? You’re being too humble. With that great atmosphere just now, the two Yongle tribe demons were deceived successfully by you. Among all of us, you’re the one with the greatest qualifications and most experience. Teacher Ye and I are nothing compared to you”

Lu Yuanxiang looked at the Flying Star Academy teacher and said with a smile, “That’s why you’re the only one who can play the role of the Yongle Demon Emperor. We don’t have the qualification.”

“How dare you try to flatter me….” the Flying Star Academy teacher snapped.

“What a joke. Who do you think I am? You can go out and ask around. I don’t ever flatter people, only speak the truth,” Lu Yuanxiang said with a straight face.

“That’s right, he’s completely right. Teacher Lu only speaks the truth,” Lei Yan quickly chimed in.

Nangong Lie looked at the Flying Star Academy teacher and said, “What are you afraid of? We’ll all be dying together with you if you’re exposed. We’re all in the same boat here.”

The Flying Star Academy teacher looked at them as the edge of his lip started twitching. Words were cheap. They should try playing the role of the Yongle Demon Emperor themselves!

Just as they were speaking, a set of footsteps approached them from outside the ancestral hall.

They quickly fell silent and waited grimly.

“General, we won’t enter this time. The ancestor made it clear that they wanted you to go alone.”

Han and Gu’s voices floated in from the outside.

…

The door to the ancestral hall was quickly pushed open. The figure who entered was a tall man with a coldly handsome face.

It was apparent that the Yongle tribe general was wearing human skin.

As the door opened, the elixir powder that Yun Chen had hidden in the door spread silently. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

In just a few breaths, the man’s eyes filled with shock and disbelief. He seemed to have seen a demon dragon hovering between heaven and earth as well as a pair of eyes reflecting the sun, moon and stars.

The Yongle Demon Emperor seemed to descend from the sky.

However, it left as quickly as it came. The dream-like scene in front of him quickly vanished, as though it was never real. Everything returned to how it once was.

The man’s forehead furrowed as it looked at the statue of the Yongle Demon Emperor again.

“State your name.”

Ye Qingtang spoke up as she looked at the man standing in the ancestral hall.

“Zang,” he said calmly as his gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

She frowned as she saw his demeanor. This one was completely different from Han and Gu just now, as expected from a general.

She was afraid that it would be hard to trick him.

“I heard that the Yongle Demon Emperor descended from the skies. The younger ones were shocked and could not welcome you properly. I hope you do not hold their rudeness against them,” the general said to the Flying Star Academy teacher..
