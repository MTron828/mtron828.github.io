Chapter 1259: The Misery Inside (3)

“What… What is going on? Why did Luo Qufeng’s killing move… become a pool of water?”

Had they not witnessed it for themselves, no one would believe what just happened.

Everyone was aware of how frightening that move from Luo Qufeng was. Even powerful figures like Suo Mu and Hong Zhong would be shot dead instantly if they were hit.

However…

Ye Qingtang actually resolved this move so easily by just waving her sleeves gently?

Everyone was astounded.

While they were already very reverent towards the powers of the Holy Lord of Shadows, they were in full admiration of her skills after witnessing this unbelievable sight right now!

“What kind of skill is this, Holy Lord of Shadows? Why have I not heard of any skill that can produce such an effect?”

“Holy Lord of Shadows is indeed amazing. I wish to see what Luo Qufeng can still do now.”

The guests almost cheered for Ye Qingtang.

Even the Temple of Shadows Hall Master was stunned by Ye Qingtang’s godlike move.

Everyone was extremely delighted and respectful.

While Ye Qingtang who received the blow was drenched in a cold sweat.

What a freaking skill!

She had already secretly concealed the Mirror of Illusions in her sleeves earlier on. The Mirror of Illusions could resolve any attacks, and she had made this preparation when she provoked Luo Qufeng to execute his killing move.

No one smelled a rat since that Mirror of Illusions was hidden in her sleeves. Everyone only felt that the Holy Lord’s move was unexplainable and that her skills were unfathomable.

Ye Qingtang knew that she was not Luo Qufeng’s opponent; thus, she wanted to take a gamble using the Mirror of Illusions.

Suppressing her emotion, she looked at Luo Qufeng indifferently, and the smile on her face seemed to symbolize her disinterest.

Little did they know that…

She was really exhausted of abilities and only hoped that Luo Qufeng would be deceived by her move and not dare to act so brazenly.

Shock filled Luo Qufeng’s face, but he returned to his normal expression moments later.

He was shocked by Ye Qingtang’s move, but that did not eliminate his greed to absorb the powers of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

“Holy Lord is indeed amazing. I have truly broadened my horizons. However… I still wish to try again.”

If not for the fact that she could not defeat Luo Qufeng, Ye Qingtang really wished to smash Luo Qufeng’s head on the ground.

Had this fellow lost his mind from cultivating evil techniques?

He still dared to come again after her pretentious act just now?

Did he really think he was second to the Heavens?!

“Holy Lord, don’t be courteous to this person! Kill him!” The oblivious guests cheered for Ye Qingtang to quickly deal with Luo Qufeng.

Ye Qingtang was filled with misery on the inside. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The use of the Mirror of Illusions was limited. It could no longer be used again after using it just now, and Ye Qingtang would not have the ability to receive Luo Qufeng’s next move.

However, without giving Ye Qingtang any time to react, Luo Qufeng suddenly flashed across and bolted straight towards her. His fist, which contained all his strength, hurled at Ye Qingtang’s chest.

All Ye Qingtang felt was a chill around her, and she instinctively raised her hand to meet with Luo Qufeng’s palm!

The instant the two palms hit each other, Ye Qingtang felt an enormous force enter her palm and rush into her body rapidly.

There was a huge gap between her skills and Luo Qufeng’s, and Luo Qufeng’s full-force strike was simply not what she could bear.
