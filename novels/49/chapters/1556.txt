Jiang Lin’s swordplay was indeed pretty good. Although he did not use all his strength, Cao Xu’s physique must not be ordinary for him to be able to take the blow from Jiang Lin.

“Again.” Cao Xu cracked into a big smile and patted his chest.

“Don’t be a p*ssy. Use more strength and hit here.”

Jiang Lin’s expression darkened slightly. This time, he used ninety-percent of his force when he swung his sword toward Cao Xu’s chest!

Clang!

However, it was as if the sword collided into a huge rock, producing a clear sound.

The cloth in front of Cao Xu’s chest was slit, but his skin was completely devoid of any red marks.

The surrounding Jiang Family youths were stunned for a moment.

“What’s happening? Why is Cao Xu’s physique so powerful?”

“Could it be that Jiang Lin went easy on him?”

Seeing the slit on his clothes, Cao Xu’s eyes were filled with ridicule as he looked at Jiang Lin and smiled. “The second move. Jiang Lin, this is all you can do. These two strikes were like scratching an itch for me. Why? Is your hand crippled? You can’t hold the sword anymore?”

Jiang Lin’s expression worsened. Not only was Cao Xun completely uninjured from the two strikes, but Jiang Lin’s wrist was instead numb from the impact.

The glee in Cao Xu’s eyes deepened when he saw Jiang Lin’s worsening expression.

The Cao Family’s unique Impenetrable Golden Armor was a treasure for cultivating physique. Previously, Cao Xu only cultivated to the third level and thus was still unable to block Jiang Lin’s sword. However, a few days ago, Cao Xu’s Impenetrable Golden Armor advanced to the fourth level.

Each level of the Impenetrable Golden Armor was a significant leap from the previous one. If Cao Xu did not have this confidence, he would not dare to come straight for Jiang Lin either.

“Two moves are already over. Jiang Lin... I won’t be letting you have the next move for free. Be more careful. Don’t break your tiny arms and legs,” Cao Xu said with a scornful laugh. The youths of the Cao Family behind him roared with laughter as well. Their ridicule was evident.

“People in the Jiang Family only amount to that little. So much for being known as the best few in swordplay technique among the younger generation of the Jiang Family. In the end, he can’t even slit Cao Xu’s skin. I think that this bullshit swordplay technique might be worse than a chef’s knife in our Cao Family.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Cao Xu, take it easy. Don’t break people’s swords with your bulky body. Haha!”

The boisterous laughter of members of the Cao Family was extremely piercing, and Jiang Lin’s face darkened by the second. In the next instant, Jiang Lin leaped up as a stream of sword aura penetrated through the sword, and several meters of sword aura struck Cao Xu’s head.

A bolt of light flashed before Cao Xu’s eyes. With a scoff, he lifted his hand and deflected the sword aura!

Boom!

The sword aura charged toward a mountain peak a hundred meters away, flattening it entirely!

Jiang Lin turned pale.

Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed slightly.

Jiang Lin had used all his strength in that attack just now.

“How boring. Jiang Lin, you’re only capable of this?” Cao Xu suddenly guffawed before taking an abrupt leap and swinging his fist at the pale Jiang Lin.

Jiang Lin barely dodged it, and Cao Xu’s fist crashed into the ground!

In a moment, the entire ground seemed to crumble from Cao Xu’s punch as web-like fissures extended a hundred meters away from where his fist landed!

However, that punch caused Jiang Lin’s expression to change drastically. Before he could return to his senses, Cao Xu bolted to the sky at the speed of lightning. The moment he landed down, he stepped straight on Jiang Lin’s head, which was then entirely driven into the ground!
