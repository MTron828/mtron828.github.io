Chapter 2755: Tian (4)

“No... impossible. How did you know that I would use the power of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline to absorb your Heavenly Dao energy?” The God of Nature said in disbelief.

“Yes, I have to thank the Fourth Domain legacy realm,” Ye Qingtang said calmly. “I once witnessed you using the god-grade Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to attack your own sister.”

“In the distant era... you saw me attack... what nonsense are you spouting?!” The God of Nature was furious.

“It’s not important,” Ye Qingtang said expressionlessly. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ye Qingtang knew from the yellow dog that there were only two ways to obtain the power of the Heavenly Dao. One was to cultivate and the other was to snatch it. And the only way to snatch the Heavenly Dao energy was to use the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

The God of Nature had a god-level Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. Therefore, if she wanted to defeat him, she would have to wait for the moment when he used his Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to absorb her Heavenly Dao energy.

Although Ye Qingtang also had the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, it could not compare to his god-level bloodline. Therefore, when Ye Qingtang fought with the God of Nature, she had already used the Heavenly Dao power to nourish her own Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. That was why the God of Nature commented that she was absorbing the Heavenly Dao power too slowly.

Actually, it was not that Ye Qingtang was slow in absorbing the Heavenly Dao energy. Instead, she used all her Heavenly Dao energy on her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

The massive amount of Heavenly Dao energy was enough to allow a bloodline to surpass the god-level and reach the level of Heavenly Dao.

Ye Qingtang had been waiting all along. She was waiting for the moment when the God of Nature would use his god-level Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to absorb her Heavenly Dao energy. That moment had finally arrived.

“Sometimes, no matter how strong one’s martial arts are, they still need a certain level of intelligence... Am I right, Ling Yan...” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up as she looked into the distance.

After spending so much time with that man, she might have become more intelligent...

“I’m imperishable and indestructible. There’s no meaning in your actions... we can make a deal. Keep your bloodline power first.” The God of Nature stared at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “I am not interested in any deal with you. Moreover, the Heavenly Dao Devouring Bloodline cannot be stopped once it begins.”

“What did you say?!” The God of Nature’s expression changed.

“Furthermore, can you still be imperishable and indestructible after losing all your Heavenly Dao energy?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Let me tell you a secret. I can help you revive your parents. I can even help you become Tian,” the God of Nature continued.

Ye Qingtang said indifferently, “After absorbing your power, I can naturally become Tian. You don’t have to revive my parents either. I can do it myself.”

“You... do you know that I’m your brother? How could you bear to treat your own brother like this...”

“Ridiculous.”

...

After some time, Ye Qingtang looked at the God of Nature who had turned into a swirling mass of dust. There was no pity in her eyes.

However, it had to be said that the Heavenly Dao energy in the God of Nature’s body was indeed too immense.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang even felt that as long as she wanted, she could change the world with the snap of a finger...

“It’s over.”

Ye Qingtang muttered to herself.

It was all over.

...

Upper realm, inside an enormous palace.

Heavenly Palace.

Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan walked out of the palace.

“Greetings, Tian!”

Several guards knelt down upon seeing Ye Qingtang.

“Rise,” Ye Qingtang said.

These guards were powerful figures that Ye Qingtang selected from the lower realm. She bestowed them the bodies of Perfected Immortals and brought them into the upper realm.
