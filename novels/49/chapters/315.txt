“Junior Brother Yun, since that is what you want, I… can only play the game with you till the end.” Lin Feng smiled, and with the point of his toes, he leaped into the arena.

There were cheers below the ring.

Yuan Wei was the biggest dark horse this year and was victorious in all his matches over the past three days. Now that he was challenging Lin Feng today, many were boiling with excitement.

“Do you think that Yuan Wei’s chance of winning is bigger or Senior Brother Lin’s chance of winning is bigger?” The onlooking disciples discussed fervently.

“Yuan Wei’s skills is indeed powerful, but Senior Brother Lin is the elite of the elite in our outer sect. Furthermore, his improvement this year is extremely huge. I think that Yuan Wei may not be able to win.”

“Yuan Wei has not lost any round until now, and his moves are quick and fierce. It is still not certain who will win and who will lose in this battle.”

As everyone was caught up in their discussion, on the ring, Yuan Wei had already attacked!

His figure turned into a shadow and the sword into a cold light which flashed across the ring and charged towards Lin Feng.

Lin Feng stood rooted to the ground without moving. His narrowed eyes reflected Yuan Wei’s shadow, and he smiled briefly.

This little junior brother was really so arrogant.

Just as Yuan Wei was about to attack Lin Feng, Lin Feng suddenly vanished. Losing his target, Yuan Wei was instinctively stunned for a second, but before he could return to his senses, Lin Feng already appeared behind him, and his sword directly stabbed towards Yuan Wei’s shoulder.

In almost an instant!

Yuan Wei turned around and did a backflip, avoiding this fatal blow with only one hand on the ground to support his body.

But before Yuan Wei adjusted his posture, Lin Feng already chased after him swiftly with fancy swordplay.

The countless glistenings of the sword entered Yuan Wei’s eyes. Alarmed, he only managed to raise a sword to counter Lin Feng’s attack.

The two swords clashed, and a loud clank rang!

Yuan Wei used the force to pull some distance between Lin Feng, wanting to change from being on the offense to defense. However, when he did a flip and struck his sword towards Lin Feng, Lin Feng was already prepared. He immediately lifted his sword and hurled Yuan Wei’s sword away while, at the same time, landing a fierce kick on Yuan Wei’s abdomen.

In just a moment, Yuan Wei was kicked out of the ring by Lin Feng!

Yuan Wei, who fell off the ring, appeared in a rather bad state as he looked in astonishment at Lin Feng, who was looking down at him from a height.

“That was a good fight, Junior Brother Yuan Wei.” Lin Feng nodded at Yuan Wei with a seeming smile. Although his words were humble, there was arrogance in his voice.

Yuan Wei frowned, and Elder Huang came forward to help him up.

“You’ve already performed very well. However, it’s still too difficult to compete for the top three positions. Lin Feng’s improvement this year is very huge, and he simply isn’t your match.” Although Yuan Wei lost, Elder Huang was already extremely satisfied with Yuan Wei’s performance over the past few days. He was similarly shocked at Lin Feng’s improvement and with his current skills. But, he was afraid that…

Yuan Wei lost while Lin Feng won, and the onlooking disciples below the ring became restless.

“Senior Brother Lin is still amazing. Yuan Wei is so powerful but could only pass four moves… Tsk tsk… This is just scary.”

On the ring, Lin Feng did not walk down from the stage after the sparring. He lifted his chin slightly and glanced across the people. When his eyes fell on Ji Xianyuan, an ambitious expression flashed past his eyes.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
