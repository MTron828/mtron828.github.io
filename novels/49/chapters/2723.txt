Chapter 2724: Returning To Her Era (

Ye Qingtang was shocked. “How… did you know!”

She had never revealed her secret to anyone in her two lifetimes. No matter how smart Ling Yan was, it was impossible for him to guess her secret.

“Of course I know.” Ling Yan chuckled. “You reincarnated because of me.”

“Because of you?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered in confusion.

“That’s right.” Ling Yan nodded and smiled. “I used karma power to let you live again. In that life, I must have deduced something, which is why I didn’t hesitate to use karma to let you live again. In this life, you are tainted with my karmic power. I just need to use the karmic natal chart to deduce everything.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Wait, I’m a little confused…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply and looked at Ling Yan.” Do you mean that after I died in my previous lifetime, it was you who revived me and brought me to the past, to start all over again? In this lifetime, you managed to find me because of your karma power and the karmic natal chart, you are the one who saved me…”

“Miss Ye is indeed intelligent.” Ling Yan chuckled. “That’s correct.”

Ye Qingtang did not doubt Ling Yan’s words. On the contrary, she truly believed him.

“But you didn’t have much interaction with me in the previous lifetime. Why did you… save me?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan in confusion.

In her previous life, the two of them did not know each other. Why did Ling Yan pay such a huge price to let her be reborn?

“Perhaps in my previous life, I also had feelings for Miss Ye,” Ling Yan replied with a smile.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“I’m asking a serious question…” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“I’m also answering very seriously.” Ling Yan smiled.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, Ling Yan smiled and said, “Actually, my fate is linked to Miss Ye’s. It is my mission to make you my wife and protect you until you reach your peak so that the true owner of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao can absorb you. But I abandoned my shell body and escaped the restraint of fate… however, I have to live under the shadow of fate. Only Miss Ye has the chance to break through this destined calamity and also let me return to the peak and surpass it. This is probably why I was unwilling to let Miss Ye die in my previous life.”

“So… everything you did for me was… actually for yourself…” Ye Qingtang stared at Ling Yan beside her. For some reason, she felt an inexplicable sense of loss.

However, Ling Yan smiled. “I might have been like that in my previous life… but in this life, the moment I saw Miss Ye, I wanted…”

Before Ye Qingtang could react, Ling Yan pulled her into his arms.

Looking into Ling Yan’s seductive eyes, Ye Qingtang was at a loss. She did not know what to do or say.

“Wanted… Wanted what…” Ye Qingtang said softly.

“I wanted to protect you forever.” Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly. Under Ye Qingtang’s surprised gaze, Ling Yan kissed her lightly.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s face was flushed red and her body trembled violently. She instinctively wanted to escape but was unable to break free from Ling Yan’s embrace.

However, deep in the recesses of her mind, Ye Qingtang did not know if it was because she could not escape or if she did not want to.
