Chapter 2719: Becoming An Immortal Immediately (4)

The shopkeeper raised his arm.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang and the shopkeeper arrived at an illusory realm. The two of them were high up and below them was a dynasty formed by the illusion.

“Cultivator, I will mimic the power of an ordinary Immortal Emperor,” the shopkeeper said to Ye Qingtang with the black sword in hand.

With that, the shopkeeper slashed the sword downwards.

Silently, without any earth-shattering booms, a black sword beam shot out like an arrow.

Before long, the kingdom below completely turned into ruins under Ye Qingtang’s disbelieving gaze.

“This…”

Ye Qingtang was shocked by the sight. The dynasty was at least half the size of the Blue Sky Domain. With just a casual wave of the sword, the dynasty was reduced to nothing and all living beings were exterminated!

“Cultivator, although this is just an illusion, it is similar to the real world. In fact, the power of this divine weapon is even more terrifying in the real world. Therefore, 100,000 cursed points is not considered expensive for such a weapon,” said the skeleton to Ye Qingtang.

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang nodded after a pause. This divine sword had shocked Ye Qingtang greatly.

With that, the illusion disappeared and they reappeared in the shop.

“I want it,” Ye Qingtang said to the shopkeeper.

After deducting the corresponding cursed points, the shopkeeper handed the red-black sword to Ye Qingtang.

“Due to restrictions, you can only increase the power of this divine weapon to a fixed level, which is still several times that of a Destruction-level divine weapon. Most of its power will be sealed. After the cultivator leaves this realm, the seal on the divine weapon will automatically be released,” the shopkeeper said.

“Understood.” Ye Qingtang sized up the cold red-black divine weapon in her hand and nodded.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, you really bought it… You were really fooled by that shopkeeper… It must have cheated you because you have so many points!” Lan Shan said to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang just smiled nonchalantly.

For some reason, she felt an affinity with this red-black sword. Even if she had been fooled, it was not important.

Furthermore, the shopkeeper in the ancient city was formed from the consciousnesses of billions of soul bones. There was no need to deceive a cultivator. If that was the case, they could have just refused to give her the 300,000 cursed points. There was no need to do this.

“Don’t worry, Junior Sister Ye Yue is no fool. The shopkeeper already demonstrated its power for her just now. Since Junior Sister Ye Yue is willing to buy it, it must be because she’s satisfied,” Wan Rong said to Lan Shan.

“That’s true… Junior Sister Ye, how powerful is this divine weapon?” Lan Shan asked curiously.

“Very powerful,” Ye Qingtang replied.

Lan Shan rolled his eyes at Ye Qingtang. Who would not know that? Which idiot would spend 100,000 points on a weapon which was not powerful? It was a given that it was powerful, but the important thing was how powerful?

“Let’s go and find the Paragon Relic,” Ye Qingtang said after a while.

The Great Immortal Temple disciples had no lack of divine weapons and armor. Especially now that they had also bought some Destruction-level divine weapons, it would not be a problem for them to protect the Paragon relic.

After a while, everyone arrived at the hall.

In the main hall, a skeleton rubbed its hands as it walked over.

“Ah, so it’s the top cultivator with the most cursed points. Welcome, welcome!” The skeleton looked at Ye Qingtang. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone looked a little taken aback. This shopkeeper seemed to be different from the others…
