Chapter 1635: I Won’t Pay (1)

Only then did they realize that the gulf between Jiang Yanyun and themselves was an uncrossable abyss.

After Jiang Yanyun left, a cynical smile reappeared on Jiang Yiran’s face. He walked over to Jiang Yisheng and patted his shoulder.

“Boy, you have guts. I respect you as a man. You’ve lost, so according to the rules, you have to hand over your month’s allowance.”

The disciples in Taiyuan Valley were not allowed to fight. However, these hot-blooded youths could not restrain themselves, so they privately made a rule that they would call their fighting sparring so that the Elders would not scold them. The loser would have to hand over a month’s allowance.

The moment Jiang Yiran spoke, the faces of the crowd of youths turned ugly.

Jiang Yisheng had represented all of them in the fight. Now that they had lost, they would all have to pay up.

Although they were reluctant, they had no choice but to follow the rules. They gritted their teeth and flung their month’s allowance at Jiang Yiran.

Jiang Yiran unabashedly swept it into his space ring. His gaze fell on Ye Qingtang, who had not moved.

“Hand over your month’s allowance. I’m in a hurry to go back and cultivate,” Jiang Yiran said to Ye Qingtang casually. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But Ye Qingtang was stunned.

She had been dragged over here on her way elsewhere and did not know what was going on. Why did she have to pay up?

“Why should I hand it over?”

Jiang Yiran was amused by Ye Qingtang’s innocent words. “Why? Little girl, you’ve only just arrived in Taiyuan Valley. Hasn’t Jiang Shaobai taught you the rules here? Your side has lost, so of course, all of you must pay up.”

Jiang Yisheng and the other youths on his side nodded. They were unwilling but had no choice.

“Ye Qingtang, just hand over your allowance.”

Ye Qingtang was silent. She understood that Jiang Yisheng and the others were in the same clique as Jiang Shaobai. She often hung out with Jiang Shaobai in the past, so they had naturally assumed that she was one of them...

So she also had to pay her share of tribute.

But Ye Qingtang... had no allowance.

During her month in the two-star constellation world, she had missed the distribution of the allowances. She had thought of just handing over her allowance, but she had none.

“Hey, why are you so quiet. Don’t waste my time. Hurry up.” Jiang Yiran was growing impatient.

“I don’t have any.” Ye Qingtang sighed softly. She really had nothing to say about this turn of events.

“You don’t have any?” Now Jiang Yiran was really amused. “Alright, you don’t have to pay up. If you can beat me, I’ll waive your share. How about that?”

The youths could not help but worry as they watched the situation unfold. Ye Qingtang had only just arrived in Taiyuan Valley. How could she possibly be a match for Jiang Yiran?

“Ye Qingtang, just hand over your allowance. If you have any issues, you can discuss it with Shaobai when she gets back.”

“This one of the valley’s rules. You don’t have a choice. Just hand it over.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the crowd that was trying to persuade her and sighed softly. She looked at Jiang Yiran and said, “As long as I can beat you, I don’t have to pay?”

Ye Qingtang’s words shocked everyone.

Jiang Yiran glowered at Ye Qingtang. He studied her and then suddenly laughed.

“Sure, I always keep my word. If you can beat me, I will not only waive your share, but I will waive all their shares too. How about that?”

Jiang Yiran thought that Jiang Yisheng was rather stupid, but here was someone who was even more stupid.

Jiang Yisheng and the others goggled.

“Ye Qingtang, don’t be rash. You can’t beat him.”
