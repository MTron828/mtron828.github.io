At the side, Feng Wuyin tugged Ye Qingtang’s sleeve as he stared at her with his big watery eyes. “Sister Ye Yue…. this is the first time I’m seeing a completed elixir too!”

Looking at the middle-aged man and Feng Wuyin, Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She felt a little baffled. One had never seen a completed elixir before while the other had only seen one other in his entire life.

Seriously?

“Wuyin, you have never seen an elixir before?” Ye Qingtang blurted out.

Feng Wuyin shook his head and said, “Sister Ye Yue, no. Elixirs have only been recently invented by the Great Immortal Temple.”

Ye Qingtang was stunned.

What Feng Wuyin meant was that in this era… elixirs had just been invented. Before this, no one understood the concept of elixirs.

Ye Qingtang understood everything now.

It was no wonder that Feng Jiuyou had taken such a huge risk to find herbs in the middle of the mountain instead of just getting elixirs

All of this was because in this era, elixirs had just been invented. And it was still using the most traditional pill refinement method. There was no so-called palm flame and no such thing as a perfect-grade elixir. Everything was still in the crude initial stages, the most inferior grades of elixirs.

Ye Qingtang calmed herself down and looked at the middle-aged man. “What do you think? Do you want to exchange?”

‘The middle-aged man nodded profusely and carefully scanned his surroundings. When he realized that no one was paying attention to his elixir, he carefully kept it as if it was his family heirloom. He looked at Ye Qingtang and said hurriedly, “Exchange… Miss, I just said that you are definitely not an

ordinary person. Although your completed elixir is extremely precious… my item is my great-great-great-great grandfather’s peerless Dharma treasure. You are definitely not at a disadvantage. Don’t worry!”

Ye Qingtang did not waste any time talking. She took the small wooden box and threw it into her space ring.

“Let’s go.”

After putting away the small wooden box, Ye Qingtang looked at Feng Wuyin and smiled.

“Okay!”

Feng Wuyin nodded and pulled Ye Qingtang’s sleeve as they walked forward.

Meanwhile, somewhere in the market.

Two men in black robes never took their eyes off Feng Wuyin.

“That young man is very extraordinary,” one of the black-robed men said.

“Indeed, he has a divine aura and is very suitable as an offering.”

“He should be one of the youths from the Feng family.”

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered as she inadvertently scanned behind her. As for the two black-robed men, they had already disappeared.

“Sister Ye Yue, what’s wrong?” Feng Wuyin asked Ye Qingtang when he saw that she had stopped moving.

Ye Qingtang smiled at Feng Wuyin. “It’s nothing. Wuyin, have you finished buying what you need? Let’s go home.”

“Sister Ye Yue, I’ve bought everything I need. Sister Ye Yue, don’t you want to shop a little longer?” Feng Wuyin said.

“No, I’ma little tired today. Let’s go back.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Alright!” Feng Wuyin nodded and pulled Ye Qingtang toward the back. He went to buy two more sticks of candied fruit and handed one to Ye Qingtang. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang felt increasingly conflicted after receiving the candied fruit.

Was history going to repeat itself?

But she was just a passerby of this era
