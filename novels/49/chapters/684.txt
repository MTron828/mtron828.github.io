“Please, Young Sir. Save us from here… I’m willing to be a slave for you…” A girl hurriedly spoke.

However, before the young man said anything, the slave master took large steps forward and said, “Brother, you aren’t a citizen here, are you?”

“So what if I’m not?” the young man said.

“Haha…” The slave master shook his head and laughed. “Brother, it’s better if you don’t stand up for them. This Young Sir Shangguan Rui’s father is the Dragon-Tiger General of Nine Nights Dynasty…”

“WHAT?!”

After hearing that, the young man was appalled, and he looked at the hideous Shangguan Rui in surprise.

The Dragon-Tiger General had the most influence in the Nine Nights Dynasty. He had many armies under him and was a trusted subordinate of the current premier, Qin Long!

“Why? You want to snatch with me?” Shangguan Rui looked at the young man with interest.

“Uh…” After knowing of Shangguan Rui’s identity, the young man broke out in a cold sweat, and he hurriedly said, “Young Sir Shangguan… This… This is a misunderstanding…”

If it was anyone else, the young man would not have bothered and still dared to contend. However, he was facing the son of the Dragon-Tiger General, and there was no way would he dare to offend him!

“Oh?” Shangguan Rui looked at the young man with a teasing expression. “You don’t wish to compete with me anymore?”

“Young Sir Shangguan… This is a misunderstanding. I’ve never thought of snatching with you!” The young man immediately made clear his stance, deeply afraid that Shangguan Rui would continue to misunderstand him.

“Misunderstanding?” Shangguan Rui scoffed coldly. “How boring is that…”

As he spoke, he looked at the guard beside him and said emotionlessly, “Where’s the knife?”

The guard immediately took out a gleaming dagger without saying anything and handed it to Shangguan Rui.

Shangguan Rui received the dagger and walked towards that young man with a harmless smile.

The young man was a little nervous at the sight.

Swoosh!

In the next second, the dagger in Shangguan Rui’s hand was stuck into the man’s stomach instantly.

“Arh!”

In just a moment, blood surged out and dyed the young man’s white clothes crimson.

The young man screamed in agony. His face turned white, and large beads of sweat dripped down from his forehead. It was as though the unbearable pain wanted to consume him entirely.

“That fellow was really reckless and actually dared to provoke Young Sir Shangguan.”

“Tsk tsk. An outsider did not know the situation and casually stood up for the slaves in the black market. He was really courting death.”

The onlookers scoffed coldly.

In their eyes, Shangguan Rui’s stab perfectly avoided the vital organs, making it seem like he only wanted to torture this young man.

“Oh… I’m really sorry. I injured you by accident. This is a misunderstanding. You won’t mind right?” A sinister expression emerged on Shangguan Rui’s hideous face.

“Mis… misunderstanding… Young Sir Shangguan… Spare my life…” The young man withstood the pain and pleaded for mercy desperately.

However, in the next second, the dagger in Shangguan Rui’s hand stirred crazily in the young man’s stomach.

“Arh!!!”

The young man died there and then almost instantly.

Shangguan Rui then kneeled down to remove the dagger from the man’s stomach and measured the young man’s neck.

Before everyone returned to their senses, the dagger waved, and he immediately slit the young man’s neck.

Large gushes of blood spouted out from the young man’s neck and spattered all over Shangguan Rui’s face.

A cold glint twinkled in Shangguan Rui’s eyes as he grabbed the young man’s head and started to cut the neck area with the dagger.
