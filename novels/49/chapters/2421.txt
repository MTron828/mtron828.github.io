Chapter 2422: Who Said I Was A Good Person (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The teenagers nodded. Although still feeling rather conflicted, they chose to follow Ye Qing’s team, keeping a suitable distance between them.

“Boss, those guys are following us.” Mu Ziying’s wooden birds could sense the Flying Star Academy team’s presence.

“Let them be,” Ye Qing replied in a mild tone.

Lu Yuanxiang glanced at Ye Qing and he couldn’t resist a small smile.

Wasn’t agreeing to let those people tag along then?

“Teacher Ye, you are a good person.” Lu Yuanxiang commented.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Who said she was a good person?

“Boss, is it really good to let them follow us? They came at us with such ill intentions from the start,” Lei Yan muttered.

The Flying Star Academy team failed to defeat them. If they had managed to win the battle, would they have been so kind?

“Are you prepared to fight again if you meet another team like them?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Lei Yan was taken aback.

“The various teams would try to attack each other now. But this competition is not as simple as we think. There is no need for us to waste our energy to handle the other teams. This Flying Star Academy team already knows the truth so if we meet with another team from their academy, they would believe them more readily,” Ye Qingtang explained.

She allowed the Flying Star folks to follow them not because she was kind-hearted. Under the current circumstances, it was just the most appropriate decision.

The Wailing Well was too expansive and Ye Qingtang didn’t know how to leave this place. If they could gather more teams, they would be able to collect more information about the Wailing Well and would only support their attempts to leave.

…

Outside the Wailing Well, the academy leaders were focused on the scene before them.

When the Flying Star Academy Vice-President saw his team attack Ye Qing’s group, his heart had risen to his throat. He was desperate to tell his people about the dangers inside the Wailing Well and to stop fighting each other.

In the end…

Before long, he saw his own team being thrashed by Ye Qing’s group. Thereafter, they were even secretly following behind Ye Qing’s team like obedient chicks behind the mother hen.

The Flying Star Academy Vice-President shot Wen Qi an awkward glance.

Truly…

Embarrassing. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

If not for the current dire circumstances, he really wished to pretend that the team didn’t belong to his academy.

Wen Qi was oblivious to the Flying Star Academy Vice-President. He was no longer that worried for Ye Qing’s group. After all, this kid was steady and capable. Wen Qi felt very lucky to have made this correct choice.

“The first batch of our men have just entered the Wailing Well. I hope that they can find the teams as soon as possible,” someone announced.

“Actually, I am now more worried about something else.” Wen Qi frowned slightly.

“What?” The others looked at him.

“The team competition is 10 days long. Is this a fake deadline or will something even more terrible happen on that date?” Wen Qi’s face turned increasingly grave.

The other academy folks realized this point now. But they had too few clues at this moment. Universe City was like an empty shell, there was nothing useful remaining.

And during this period, another few teams had been attacked by above-Emperor level monsters. Just like the Maple Night Academy team, they had all perished in a matter of seconds…

And the monsters were all of different species.

The number of above-Emperor level monsters inside the Wailing Well had been increasing continuously. The number of deaths was also climbing exponentially…
