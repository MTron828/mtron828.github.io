Chapter 972 The Match (4)

“Blazing Flame Sword Technique…”

The watching citizens gaped at the scene before them. If they had not seen it with their own eyes, they would never have imagined that the Blazing Flame Sword Technique, that could only be learned within the sects, would one day be displayed before them.

“Duan Luoning, is it? You’ve lost this time.” Dan Yifan stood proudly on the dais. His slender figure showed no sign of injury.

Everyone from the Duan Family suddenly snapped out of their trance and hurried over to help Duan Luoning, who had fallen to the ground.

They would never have imagined that Duan Luoning would be so utterly defeated!

There was not the slightest wound on Dan Yifan!

“Based on the terms of our bet, from today onward, the Duan Family must pay tribute to the Ye Family.” Dan Yifan stood proudly as he sheathed the Blazing Sun Sword with a flick of his wrist.

“You…” Duan Luoning exerted himself and stood up. He glared at Dan Yifan and wanted to say something.

However…

“Today’s match is not yet over. Your words are premature.” A voice suddenly rang out from the martial arts arena.

Everyone within the martial arts arena looked towards the voice.

But everyone was shocked by what they saw.

Three tall figures had quietly appeared at the entrance to the martial arts arena. The person in the lead was the eldest son of the Duan Family—Duan Tianyun!

And standing behind Duan Tianyun were the Second and Third Young Masters of the Duan Family, Duan Tianrao and Duan Tianrui.

“Eldest Young Master!” The moment the group from the Duan Family saw that Duan Tianyun had appeared, their eyes lit up.

Duan Tianyun swept a glance at Duan Luoning’s injuries and frowned slightly. However, he did not say anything and walked straight towards the dais.

“You are?” Dan Yifan looked at the three men who had suddenly appeared.

Duan Tianyun said, “I am Duan Tianyun from the Duan Family.”

“So it’s the Eldest Young Master of the Duan Family.” Dan Yifan nodded slightly. “I wonder what Eldest Young Master Duan meant?”

“What did I mean? Wasn’t I clear enough?” Duan Tianyun laughed coldly. “Yesterday, the Duan and Ye Families agreed to this match, but any of the younger members of the two families can participate in the match. You merely won one round, how can you determine the winner?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Dan Yifan frowned slightly. But upon careful thought, he realized that Duan Tianyun was right.

Below the dais, Ye Qingtang was watching everything expressionlessly.

Duan Tianyun was the oldest of the Duan Family’s three sons, but Duan Tianyun had a haughty and mercurial personality and had not been chosen to be the next master of the Duan Family. Instead, Second Young Master, Duan Tianrao, had won the favor of the Duan Family’s master and had been selected to succeed him.

Just as Ye Qingtang was watching events unfold, a pair of eyes fell on her quietly.

“Second Brother, isn’t that Ye Qingtang? Why is she back?” The Duan Family’s Third Young Master, Duan Tianrui, suddenly saw Ye Qingtang’s figure amidst the crowd. He spoke to his second brother, Duan Tianrao, who was standing beside him.

When Duan Tianrao heard that, he looked towards Ye Qingtang.

Duan Tianrao and Ye Qingtang had been engaged, but after Ye Qingtang’s spirit root was destroyed, the engagement was broken. After that, he became engaged to the Ye Family’s adopted daughter, Ye Xun.

However, something had happened on the birthday of the Ye Family’s previous Great Elder. After that night, Ye Xun had vanished, and Duan Tianrao had no more contact with the Ye Family.

He only heard that Ye Qingtang had entered the Xuanling Sect a year ago, but he had not heard any more news.
