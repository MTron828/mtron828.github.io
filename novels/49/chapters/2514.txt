Chapter 2515: Not A God, But An Immortal (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“You speak the truth. With Teacher Ye’s abilities, just being a teacher is too wasteful. I wonder if Teacher Ye has any thoughts on this. Our Sky Martial Academy has two Vice-President positions and one of them is still available…” The Vice-President of the Sky Martial Academy said with a smile.

As soon as the Sky Martial Academy Vice-President said that, the other Vice-Presidents immediately surrounded them.

Everyone had witnessed Ye Qing’s abilities. Whether it was his ability to teach students or his own powers, he was a rare talent.

With Ye Qing’s abilities, it was more than enough for him to be the Vice-President of any one of the academies. One could even tell by the way the Academy Alliance elder spoke earlier, that he held Ye Qing in high regard.

If Ye Qing was willing, they would try to poach him at all costs.

“Everyone, what is the meaning of this? Do you treat me as dead?!” Wen Qi looked very angry. The Vice-Presidents of the other academies were trying to poach his staff right in front of him. This was simply outrageous!

“Haha, Vice-President Wen, you can’t put it that way. Teacher Ye did not sell himself to your school, so whoever offers the highest price will get priority, right?” One of the Vice-Presidents smiled at Wen Qi.

“Thank you all for your kind intentions. However, I have no intention of changing my position for now.” Ye Qingtang smiled at everyone before Wen Qi could retort.

The Vice-Presidents’ expressions shifted at his words.

Wen Qi smiled and said, “Alright, there’s no issue of price anymore. Everyone, please return and make the best use of your time to find those people from Universe City. That should be the most important matter at hand.”

There was not a single soul left in Universe City. All the major academies had returned, and Wen Qi and his group had also immediately set off and returned to their academy.

“Ye Qing, what is your friend planning to do? If he has no plans, he can be a teacher in the academy. How about that?” Wen Qi asked Ye Qing on the way back.

Naturally, Wen Qi had heard that Ye Qing had resurrected the Blood Moon Elder. In Wen Qi’s opinion, any friend of Ye Qing should be good enough to be a teacher.

“Vice-President, I think there’s no need for that. My friend and I still have some private matters to settle.” Ye Qingtang smiled at Wen Qi.

Wen Qi was taken aback by Ye Qing’s words. “Ye Qing… do you mean that you won’t be going back to the academy first?”

Ye Qingtang nodded. “Yes. I will leave with my friend when we reach the next resting point.”

Wen Qi pondered for a moment and finally nodded. “Alright, your friend’s situation is quite special. How about this, after I return to the academy, I’ll help you apply for a leave of absence from the President. We will wait for you and your friend’s return after you settle your business.”

“Thank you, Vice-President.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

She did feel some reluctance to part with them, but this was a step that had to be taken. After all, Ye Qingtang could not stay in the academy permanently as she had more important things to do.

At the next resting stop, Ye Qingtang waved goodbye to everyone.

“Boss, when are you coming back?” Nangong Lie looked at Ye Qing with obvious reluctance.

“That’s right, Boss. What are we going to do if you’re not in the academy?!” Lei Yan joined in anxiously.

They were already used to having Ye Qing by their side.. If Ye Qing was not around, they did not know what to do.
