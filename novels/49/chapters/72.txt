Chapter 73: Courting Attention (2)

Duan Tianrao hesitated for a moment before he continued: “I had never expected my father would choose me to be the next head of the household, and so I’ve had no choice but to put our household’s interests before my personal feelings, even if it meant hurting the one I loved….”

Duan Tianrao stopped in his tracks and in the next moment, he grabbed Ye Qingtang by the arm.

Ye Qingtang knitted her brows when she suddenly saw his yearning face.

“Tang Tang, will you forgive me?”

“I beg your pardon?” Ye Qingtang was not paying attention to him all this while, thus, to see him getting all worked up out of the blue was quite a ridiculous sight.

“Tang Tang, I know you’re still angry with me. I admit, it’s my fault. But you must believe me, though I’ve called off our engagement, you’re still always there in my heart. Due to the loss of your spirit root back then, I just didn’t have a choice. But things are different now, you’ve a spirit root again, even if it’s just a red one, I don’t mind at all, so…. Can we start over again?” Duan Tianrao poured his heart out to her.

But Ye Qingtang could only find his words amusing when she heard them.

She quickly slipped out of his grasp, and after smoothing out her wrinkled sleeves, she replied nonchalantly: “Mr Duan, please be reminded that you’re currently engaged with Ye Xun. Do not be distracted by nostalgia.”

Once Duan Tianrao heard her words, his heart fluttered. If Ye Qingtang was indeed jealous over his affair with Ye Xun, that would prove he was still there in her heart.

In the next moment, he made up his mind and said: “Tang Tang, just say the word and I’ll renounce my engagement with Ye Xun anytime. There’s actually nothing between me and her. You and I are meant to be.”

Ye Qingtang could not help but to roll her eyes at him. Does the word ‘shame’ exist in his dictionary?

Nothing between him and Ye Xun?

If getting engaged meant nothing to him, would bearing his child qualify as ‘something’ then?

Although all those thoughts crossed her mind, Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to respond to his romantic scam.

Just as Duan Tianrao continued to profess his love for her, four shadowy figures suddenly descended into the courtyard from beyond the walls.

A mischievous gleam flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

They are finally here.

When those figures landed, their eyes revealed an inkling of anticipation at the sight of Ye Qingtang, but when they noticed Duan Tianrao standing beside her, they faltered for a moment.

Ye Qingtang winked at them discreetly before stepping forward to speak. Her voice sounded cold and distant: “Who goes there? All illegal trespassers will be prosecuted!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Those figures, who turned out to be men clothed in black garbs, seemed to come to their senses at her words. After they exchanged glances, they unsheathed the swords on their hips.

“Are you Ye Qingtang?”

“Yes. I am.” Ye Qingtang answered without hesitation.

“Good. We’ve been hired to take your life. No hard feelings, but this is the end for you.” The men sneered before they launched their attacks on Ye Qingtang.

“Watch out!” After Duan Tianrao realized those men were after Ye Qingtang, a sudden thought struck him. He happened to be fretting over winning her back, and now, these villains actually showed up, allowing him to play the hero saving the damsel in distress.

With that in mind, Duan Tianrao drew his sword and while shielding Ye Qingtang behind his back, he engaged in a sword fight with those men.

Ed: Slight delay on these two chapters, but sometimes life really refuses to be ignored. On schedule for next week.
