Chapter 1059 Traitor (2)

A thousand years ago, only the Blood Moon Sect had this Robbing Spirit Root Skill…

In that case, the black-robed old man before them… was connected to the Blood Moon Sect?!

Daoist Zijin did not care about even the three greatest powers. But the Blood Moon Sect..

A thousand years ago, it was the foremost unshakable power in this mainland. Later, the Blood Moon Sect had grown overly powerful, single-handedly beating all others. This had aroused the hatred of hundreds of sects and powerful families in this mainland. In the end, powerful sects and families had joined forces and had barely managed to exterminate the Blood Moon Sect. But they paid a terrible price…

The Blood Moon Sect… at its peak, it had over a hundred Yang Lords…

Even after the Blood Moon Sect was exterminated, a thousand years later, its senior members were slowly recovering, and the Blood Moon Sect would rise again…

If they killed a member of the Blood Moon Sect today, the consequences would not be as simple as antagonizing the Beiming Manor!

“Yang Lord, I can use my Robbing Spirit Root Skill to serve you.” Elder Qu fixed his gaze on Ye Qingtang.

“That sounds pretty good… a pity that I’m not very interested in your Robbing Spirit Root Skill… However, I am interested in taking your life.” Ye Qingtang smiled coldly as she looked at Elder Qu. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

No matter what, she was the sworn sister of the Blood Moon Holy Lord. She even had the status of Blood Moon Holy Lady. As the Holy Lady of the Blood Moon Sect, Ye Qingtang must certainly act now that she had met a great traitor of the Blood Moon Sect. Otherwise, she could not answer to her handsome younger brother…

Elder Qu was taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words. He had no quarrel with this Yang Lord, so why was she so interested in taking his life?!

“Eldest Young Lady, slow down. Let this man live for now!” Daoist Zijin was afraid that Ye Qingtang would act immediately and spoke hurriedly.

“He mustn’t be killed?” Elder Bai Kui looked at Daoist Zijin. “He is a mere Yunxiao Sect elder, why can’t he be killed? Daoist Zijin, can it be that you are interested in the Robbing Spirit Root Skill… Does our Ye Family still need these things for embellishment?!”

When he heard that, Daoist Zijin immediately shook his head and said, “What rubbish Robbing Spirit Root Skill… Bai Kui, are you brainless? Don’t you know where the Robbing Spirit Root Skill originated from?”

When he heard Daoist Zijin’s words, Elder Bai Kui was shocked. The origin of the Robbing Spirit Root Skill…Bai Kui immediately sank into deep thought. After a few breaths, his expression suddenly changed.

As the Grand Imperial Sire of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty, Elder Bai Kui could not possibly be unaware of the origins of the Robbing Spirit Root Skill. It was the Blood Moon Sect… the foremost power a thousand years ago!

A thousand years ago, even the ancestors of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty had joined the plot to exterminate the Blood Moon Sect…

Only a senior member of the Blood Moon Sect could use the Robbing Spirit Roots Skill. Others could not possibly learn it!

“Are you saying that this man is… a member of the Blood Moon Sect?!” Elder Bai Kui was shocked.

In recent times, he had heard the news that the Blood Moon Sect was reviving but had not taken it to heart.

“Eldest Young Lady, you must not kill this man,” Elder Bai Kui hurriedly said. He was suddenly on the same side as Daoist Zijin.

“Eldest Young Lady, you should be aware of the Blood Moon Sect. It was the absolute power in this mainland a thousand years ago. Although it was exterminated, it can revive… This man must have some deep connection with the Blood Moon Sect. If he dies at the hands of our Ye Family, we will offend the Blood Moon Sect…” Cold sweat seeped from Daoist Zijin’s forehead.
