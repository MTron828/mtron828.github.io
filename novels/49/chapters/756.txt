Chapter 757 So It’s My Fault? (1)

Perfected Xuanchen sighed. When he was about to say something, Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke.

“I have no idea what mistake I made that need to be punished by Master, Peak Master?”

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master did not expect that Ye Qingtang would suddenly change her words after confessing the truth.

“What mistake did you make? Isn’t it a mistake that you injured your Senior Brother? Do you think that you can do anything you want when your Master is the Valley Master now?” He scoffed.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master seemed to be speaking to Ye Qingtang, but he was hinting at Perfected Xuanchen.

Ye Qingtang looked at how sarcastic was the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master and was very confused.

“I can’t take the blame of hurting my Senior Brother. I was just practicing with Senior Brother Li. When did I purposely hurt him? I just entered the valley, and I’m not aware of all the rules here. Is competition among disciples forbidden here?”

“Of course it’s allowed here. However, were you really practicing? Li Jingwen is still in a coma now. How dare you say it’s a practice when you beat him heavily?” The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master heavily.

“Isn’t that how it’s supposed to be? It’s the same when Senior Brother Li came to the Admirable Sky Peak today with others and competed with my Senior and Junior Brothers. My Junior Brother Sheng almost lost his life under Senior Brother Li’s sword. He is still in a coma now,” Ye Qingtang said.

“I thought that Senior Brother Li is an old disciple here and the chief disciple of the Blue Cloud Peak. Of course, he should know the rules here. He did not have any concerns when he competed with our disciples, and I thought so as well.” Ye Qingtang continued.

“What did you say? When did Li Jingwen come to the Admirable Sky Peak?” The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master was stunned.

A trace of a cunning smile flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She knew that those from the Blue Cloud Peak did not have the nerve to tell the truth to their Peak Master.

“I was not around when Senior Brother Li was here. However, most of the Admirable Sky Peak disciples were here, and they can prove that. If you do not believe me, you can visit the doctor now. My Junior Brother Sheng is still lying there now.”

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master scanned through the Blue Cloud Peak disciples he brought when he saw that Ye Qingtang’s sight was so determined.

He immediately knew that they were hiding something when he saw their faces.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master’s face clouded, and he was speechless at the moment.

Li Jingwen injured the Admirable Sky Peak disciple first. If he blamed Ye Qingtang for the same thing, then Li Jingwen was the one who made the mistake first.

“Furthermore, when I went over to look for Senior Brother Li, he said in front of everyone that he was practicing with me… Senior Brother Yan and all the Blue Cloud Peak disciples who were present could prove that.” Ye Qingtang added.

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples’ faces were unpleasant.

Li Jingwen really did say that before.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master’s expression turned ugly.

“I did not expect that Senior Brother Li would be so weak. I thought that as the chief disciple of the Blue Cloud Peak, he must be very powerful, so I did not hold back. However… I didn’t know that he was so weak. If I knew that earlier, I would not use my full strength…” Ye Qingtang stared at the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master with an innocent expression.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master almost fainted upon hearing her words.

His chief disciple was… weak?

Too weak for her to compete with?
