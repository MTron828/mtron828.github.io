Chapter 1539 Distorting The Truth 1

In Jiang Qi’s shock, that female voice rang again. Jiang Qi looked up and saw a rather familiar-looking girl standing beside him. However, there were two toddlers that were about three years old in her arms, and one of them was grabbing his wrist.

The child made eye contact with him and retracted his hand with a giggle.

“You are...” With a slight frown, Jiang Qi’s gaze swept across that girl’s clothes. He realized she was also a member of the Jiang Family.

Ye Qingtang revealed her identity, but Jiang Qi was still slightly dazed.

Jiang Qi was not to be blamed for having no impression of Ye Qingtang. As someone from the Elder Cabinet, any same-aged people who were not from the Elder Cabinet could not enter his eyes, and he all the more did not pay any attention to others on this journey.

However...

Jiang Qi never thought that he would be rescued by Ye Qingtang, whom he had never seen before.

“Thank you,” Jiang Qi said blandly. No matter what, Ye Qingtang saved his life today. It was just that... he glanced at the two toddlers in her arms with a strange look.

Even though Jiang Qi was a proud boy, he could not help but find it odd.

Where did she find these two kids from?

It was inconvenient for Ye Qingtang to explain; thus, she changed the topic to ask about Jiang Qi’s situation, and only then did she realize that those two ancient clan elders were after the Soul Sucking Jade.

Fortunately, nothing bad happened. As Ye Qingtang was carrying Jiang Yu and You Qiong and could not stay there for long, while Jiang Qi was injured, they immediately decided to return to the Jiang Residence first.

Due to the young toddlers and injuries in the group, their journey had to be delayed. Several days had already passed when they were out of the Land of Infinite Demons.

...

At the same time, an oppressive air loomed in the Jiang Residence.

Seated at the top position, the Domain Monarch tightly locked his brows together as he looked at Jiang Shangyu and the rest with a serious expression.

The Jiang Family suffered a considerable loss in this expedition to the Land of Infinite Demons—half of the total number of people that Jiang Shangyu brought lost their lives there. Luckily, they still gained plenty of good items in the Great Demon’s palace this time.

Yet, even so, the outcome was still beyond the Domain Monarch’s expectations.

The Domain Monarch’s expression darkened at this moment.

In the hall, the injured Jiang Xun was ghastly pale as she glared at Jiang Qin and the others, who were perfectly fine.

“You said that they wanted to kill Tang Tang?” The Domain Monarch looked at Jiang Xun and asked. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Jiang Xun nodded. If she was not injured right now, she would definitely give Jiang Xun a tight slap.

She had just returned, and in consideration of Jiang Lang’s rashness and Mo Yi’s poor health, she did not tell them about Ye Qingtang’s disappearance.

She only told the Domain Monarch about everything.

Facing Jiang Xun’s accusation, Jiang Xun, however, sneered and responded. “You’re so funny, aunt. We want to kill Ye Qingtang? She was clearly the playful one. Fifth great-uncle had already stated that the Land of Infinite Demons was a dangerous place, but Ye Qingtang refused to be disciplined and completely ignored fifth great-uncle’s orders. Not only did she act on her own, she even wanted to barge into the forbidden land and caused Jiang Qiu and the rest to follow her in as they were worried about her safety.”

“I haven’t blamed Ye Qingtang for acting on her own and implicating many other Jiang Family members, but you’re even accusing me now.”

Jiang Qin did watch those people from the Jiang Family chase Ye Qingtang into the forbidden area. Although she was shocked and waited outside for a while, she was still worried that it would implicate her and thus quickly gathered with Jiang Shun and the rest.

When Jiang Xun learned that Ye Qingtang entered the forbidden area, she hurried over to check. Jiang Shun and the rest also went along. After waiting for half a day, not a single Jiang Family member came out. It was then that they returned.
