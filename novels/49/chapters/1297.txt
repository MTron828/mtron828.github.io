Chapter 1298: Unreasonable (3)

“Mo Yunxian, shut up!” The Eternal Emperor looked stern as he shouted.

When they saw that the Eternal Emperor was angry, all the ministers, princes, and princesses present instantly fell to their knees.

“Your Majesty, please don’t be angry!”

Mo Yunxian was shocked by this shout. The Eternal Emperor had always treated her affectionately. This was the first time she had been reprimanded like that.

“Your Majesty…”

“Mo Yunxian, I will make allowances for your youth and ignorance, so I will not punish you severely. Do you know who these guests are?” The Eternal Emperor said coldly.

“I…” Mo Yunxian was taken aback. She glanced at Ye Qingtang and Ming Gu.

She had only noticed Lady Ghost and Ye Qingtang’s looks but had not observed them closely. Upon closer inspection, she vaguely noticed the color of Lady Ghost and Ming Gu’s pupils, which was unique to the Undead.

The Undead Clan!

Mo Yunxian instantly thought of that race.

Mo Yunxian had seen many Undead when she was cultivating with her Master. However, those Undead had been riddled with the aura of death and looked very peculiar, so they could be identified at a glance. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

However, her Master had said that the more powerful the Undead, the more they could hide their death aura and could even transform their looks to resemble ordinary humans. If a powerful Undead so wished, they could transform themselves so that they looked exactly like a human.

Mo Yunxian had not expected Undead to be present and had not paid close attention. But now…

“These three are our honored guests from the Temple of Shadows. The person you insulted just now is Elder Ye from the Temple of Shadows.” The Eternal Emperor spoke sternly.

Mo Yunxian instantly blanched.

An Elder from the Temple of Shadows?

When she thought of the force of Ming Gu’s blow, Mo Yunxian broke out in a cold sweat. If her Master had not given her a Paragon-level Dharma treasure upon her return, she would have been killed by the blow.

Even so, she had been severely injured…

“Perhaps Miss Mo has grown arrogant outside, and even the Elder from the Temple of Shadows is beneath her now? Surely an Elder of the Temple of Shadows is worthy to toast our Crown Prince?” The Second Princess seized the opportunity to fan the flames. Now that Ling Yan had become the Crown Prince, he was an even greater threat than the Eldest Prince.

“It is my fault that our honored guests from the Temple of Shadows have been annoyed today.” The Eldest Prince sighed and looked guilty.

“Miss Mo, our Royal Father is hosting today’s banquet to entertain our guests from the Temple of Shadows, but you have been so rude to them. Perhaps you have no regard for our Royal Father’s honor? Or perhaps now that our Third Royal Brother has become the Crown Prince, you think you will be the future Crown Princess, so…” The Eldest Princess chipped in, clearly intent on causing division.

At that moment, Mo Yunxian’s expression was extremely ugly. She had not known who they were; otherwise, she would not have acted as she did.

“Your Majesty, I did not… I… I did not mean it.”

The Eternal Emperor looked displeased, and he frowned as he looked at Mo Yunxian.

“Mo Yunxian, I will take into account your father’s services in battle on the behalf of the Eternal Dynasty. Get out now,” the Eternal Emperor said.

Mo Yunxian panicked and looked at Ling Yan. “Elder Brother Yan…”

Ling Yan only listened to the Eternal Emperor’s reprimand with a bowed head.
