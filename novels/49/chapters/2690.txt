Chapter 2691: Mysterious Land (3)

An ordinary shop could openly sell Heaven-level divine weapons?! It was no big deal if they were in an exclusive auction venue. However, the shops they were in now looked like your average street stall open to everyone. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Heaven-level divine weapons were very rare in the Divine Venerate Domain. Only Immortal Emperor-level experts were qualified to possess them.

Which one of the Great Immortal Temple disciples had ever owned a Heaven-level divine weapon?

The Great Immortal Temple disciples stared at the dazzling array of Heaven-level divine weapons. They looked like they had just received a precious treasure and were overjoyed.

“Senior Brother Zhou Yun, you are holding the Great Sun Divine Saber!” One of the Great Immortal Temple disciples stared at the long saber in the purple-haired youth’s hand excitedly.

“I think so.” The purple-haired young man nodded.

“Senior Brother Zhou Yun… My cultivation technique is very compatible with the Great Sun Divine Saber!”

The purple-haired youth snorted. “Junior Brother, what are you thinking? This is a Heaven-level divine weapon…”

But suddenly, the purple-haired youth looked slightly stunned. His gaze instinctively landed on the many divine weapons hanging on the wall. Without a word, he threw the Great Sun Divine Saber at that Great Immortal Temple disciple. “Take it, take it. It’s just a Heaven-level divine weapon!”

“I wield dual sabers, so I’ll take two. Does anyone have any objections?”

“Wait, my supernatural power is that I can grow two more arms… it’s reasonable for me to take four!”

At that moment, Lan Shan stared at the crowd with an anxious expression. “I… I have always had a wish. Junior Brothers and Sisters, can you help me fulfill my wish?!”

“Wish?”

Everyone was stunned and confused.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Wan Rong, “…”

All the disciples, “…”

“Senior Brother Lan Shan, I only want four weapons and already feel rather abashed at that… and you are claiming that you want to open a weapons shop? How are you planning to do that? You just want to keep everything for yourself!”

Having been exposed, Lan Shan looked a little embarrassed. “Forget it… I won’t open a weapons shop. You guys go ahead and choose first. I will take the rest…”

“Bah, there are dozens of Heaven-level weapons here. You will still gain a good number of weapons from the leftovers.”

After about 15 minutes, the Great Immortal Temple disciples happily carried several Heaven-level divine weapons out of the shop.

Wan Rong looked at herself and Ye Qingtang. Their hands were empty…

These people did not leave anything for them?!

“Bang!”

Before Wan Rong could say anything, the young man at the front had only taken half a step out of the shop when he was sent flying. He slammed heavily into the wall of the shop. The weapons in his hands fell to the ground.

“Who… who ambushed me!”

The young man stood up and scanned the crowd.

“Who ambushed you? Don’t speak nonsense.” Lan Shan frowned.

“What happened? He was indeed thrown by a mysterious force…”
