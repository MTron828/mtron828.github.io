Chapter 1584 Black Witch 2

When the flames of war swept through everything, hundreds of cities had been infected with a deadly plague. Like the Grim Reaper’s scythe, the plague took countless lives.The plague was like a gift from the devil; it only made more agonized people offer the devil their souls.

A black witch was a servant of the devil who had sold her soul. They believed in the idea of a devil. In order to serve their master, they would cruelly bring all kinds of disasters on people...

The most prominent features of these black witches were their long, jet black hair and dark eyes.

The devil came from hell, and his favorite color was black.

“We cannot allow her to leave this place or disaster will come upon our city!” Someone in the panicked crowd let out a terrified wail.

Those who feared the black witch began to surround the entire bar. Looking at the girl before them with tense expressions, they grabbed onto utensils and wooden stools.

Ye Qingtang saw that the crowd before her was terrified. They stared at her in horror and anger. She was still rather puzzled as they continued to scold and roar at her.

Black witch?

What’s a black witch?

Ye Qingtang felt that she could still understand what was happening in the one-star constellation. Why was this two-star constellation so bewildering? L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As she looked at the pairs of terrified and hate-filled eyes, Ye Qingtang felt that if not for the fact that she entered this world in her own body, she would have thought that she had inhabited the body of a villain who had committed all kinds of evil deeds and killed many people.

As the people continued to yell and scold, the clatter of horse hooves drew nearer.

The people who had gathered outside the bar with burning torches when they heard the commotion now turned towards the sound. They saw heavily armored knights on their tall horses heading in their direction.

Everyone acted as though they had seen their savior. Hopeful smiles appeared on their terrified faces. They looked reverently at the magnificent carriage behind the knights.

“It’s the Bishop of York! The Bishop of York is here!”

“Damn black witch, you’re doomed now. The Bishop of York will certainly send you back to hell!”

The people cheered.

As the door of the carriage slowly opened, a middle-aged man dressed in a long, white robe alighted. His eyes were deep-set, and his brown beard was neatly combed. As everyone looked on respectfully, he glanced at the chaotic scene and frowned slightly.

“Bishop of York, we’ve discovered a black witch. Please help us avert disaster and save those of us who are believers.” The old woman who had been viciously snarling at Ye Qingtang rushed over to the Bishop of York the moment she saw him. She piously kneeled before the Bishop of York as she prayed.

The Bishop of York’s gaze fell on the young girl in the bar. He was startled when he saw that the girl had long, jet-black hair and shining eyes as dark as the night sky.

“The claws of the devil are reaching for innocent citizens. You servants of the devil are not fit to step into this peaceful and happy place.” The Bishop of York spoke solemnly. He narrowed his eyes slightly and looked at Ye Qingtang with disdain.

With that, the Bishop of York raised his hand slightly. The Vatican’s knights that had followed him now advanced a step and handed him a holy chalice made of pure silver. Water sloshed in the holy chalice, reflecting the firelight.
