Chapter 144: Another Three Moves (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“No problem,” Zhou Qu agreed immediately.

He mocked Ye Qingtang for being foolish in his heart.

Did she really think that she was more powerful than him now just because she got lucky and received his three moves?

Zhou Qu’s ranking as the first one thousand in the outer sect was not fake. He was confident in sparring with new disciples with green spirit roots like Lu Xiuwen, much less a red spirit root disciple like Ye Qingtang.

A cold murderous look flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she saw Zhou Qu’s confident expression. Looking down slightly, she hid away all emotion in her eyes.

“Then, may Senior Brother Zhou receive my moves.”

At that point, the Rewards Pavilion was empty, and they had no other scruple while exchanging blows.

Zhou Qu was full of confidence, and the arrogance in his eyes could not be hidden at all. He waved to Ye Qingtang nonchalantly and said, “Come on, Junior Sister Ye.”

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up. In the very next instant when Zhou Qu finished his sentence, she suddenly disappeared before Zhou Qu’s eyes!

Suddenly, Zhou Qu lost sight of Ye Qingtang, and the arrogant smile on Zhou Qu’s face froze instantly.

In the next second!

Ye Qingtang suddenly appeared behind Zhou Qu, and a cold light flashed across the bottom of her eyes.

At that very moment!

Ye Qingtang suddenly raised her leg, and with a jump, she directly landed a heavy kick on Zhou Qu’s temple!

Zhou Qu simply had no time to react and only felt an extreme pain surging from within his brain. Under this pain, his tough physique could not withstand that blow, and he was kicked dumb. His mind buzzed, and his vision was blurred, rendering him unable to see anything.

“Senior Brother Zhou, this is the first move.” Ye Qingtang’s voice sounded like that of a devil’s which traveled from behind him.

Zhou Qu’s head seemed as though it was going to explode. The force in that kick just now was not at all inferior to any boxing cultivators and completely not what a fifteen-year-old girl should possess.

However…

This was not the end yet.

Only one move was over in the agreed three moves.

Ye Qingtang stood still and looked at Zhou Qu hugging his head without any pity.

Suddenly, she took a step forward.

Zhou Qu seemed to sense something at that point and straightened himself, wanting to block Ye Qingtang’s oncoming attack with his fists.

However, Ye Qingtang did not launch a sudden attack this time and merely smiled as she looked at Zhou Qu’s miserable look.

Zhou Qu was not born gifted, yet he forcefully developed himself to where he was today. Clearly, he was not someone that could be easily bullied. If Ye Qingtang wanted to teach him a lesson, it must obviously be under the pretext of ensuring her own safety.

“Senior Brother Zhou, the second move is next,” Ye Qingtang said with a slight smile.

Zhou Qu could not be bothered with the ringing pain in his brain and forced himself to raise his head, wanting to catch Ye Qingtang in action.

However…

He was still a step slower.

The moment he looked up, Ye Qingtang rushed to his front at the speed of light, and her tiny figure appeared right in front of him directly.

Zhou Qu only managed to look down at Ye Qingtang’s outstanding features. What entered his eyes was a smile, with indescribable evilness, which bloomed on her face.

It was also at the moment Ye Qingtang smiled when she gave a flying kick right across which violently landed on Zhou Qu’s lower jaw.

This kick had Zhou Qu flying out immediately!RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com
