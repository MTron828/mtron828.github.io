1464 Death Wish 3

In the next second, Jiang Qin leaped up and bolted straight toward Ye Qingtang.

Mo Yi’s expression changed, and she wanted to step up to take that blow. However, after being severely injured earlier on and forcefully implementing the barrier, which worsened her injuries further, blood seeped out of her mouth as she stood up in a flurry.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath, and all her strength reached the maximum at this point as she swore to fight Jiang Qin to the end.

Ye You looked at this scene from afar, and her eyes were filled with smiles. It was as though she turned into Jiang Qin at this moment as she cast the shadow of death over Ye Qingtang.

Kill her!

But the moment when Jiang Qin rushed to Ye Qingtang, a bolt of lightning shot down from the sky abruptly.

That deafening sound immediately lit up the dim courtyard.

The strike of lightning directly blocked Jiang Qin’s route. Seeing that familiar flash, Jiang Qin was alarmed and hurriedly retreated backward. However, the lightning strikes seemed to have a spiritual nature, and numerous bolts continuously chased after Jiang Qin and struck at her.

Any part of the ground that the lightning struck became charred and stirred up a storm of dust.

Several shadows suddenly appeared in the sky along with that lightning.

“Jiang Qin, you have a death wish.” An emotionless yell suddenly sounded from the sky.

Jiang Qin steadied herself and looked in the direction of the voice.

Only to see…

A stunning-looking man in a bloody robe standing in midair. His striking appearance bore some resemblance with Jiang Shun and Jiang Liu but had additional hints of wildness.

“Jiang Lang…” Jiang Qin trembled slightly when she saw that man.

Even Jiang Shun and the others in the courtyard were shocked as well.

Jiang Lang is back?

Why is he so fast?!

Like a devil that crawled out from hell, Jiang Lang’s body was coated with blood, and his clean face was stained with large traces of blood. Fresh blood dripped down from his dark hair, and the strong smell of blood rushed into everyone’s nose.

There were four men in ghost masks and black armor behind Jiang Lang. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ye Qingtang looked up in surprise at the handsome man in the sky. That man’s gaze coincidentally landed on her as well, but shifting his gaze slightly, he saw Mo Yi, who was standing behind Ye Qingtang.

When he noticed Mo Yi’s frail appearance and the blood seeping out from the corner of her lips, Jiang Lang’s eyes turned bloodshot immediately.

“Jiang Qin, I’ll take your life!” Jiang Lang flew down, and his body seemed to be surrounded by lightning as he charged towards the stunned Jiang Qin.

“Brother! What are you doing!” Jiang Shun was alarmed to see the murderous Jiang Lang attacking Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin turned pale instantly as she saw a berserk Jiang Lang. Never had she thought that Jiang Lang would suddenly appear at such a timing.

“She is your younger sister. Jiang Lang, are you crazy!” Jiang Shun shouted.

Yet, nothing entered Jiang Lang’s ears as he used lightning as a pike and struck at Jiang Qin successively.

Seeing that Jiang Qin was being attacked, Tuoba Yao was alarmed and hurriedly went up but was blocked by the four demon-masked guards brought by Jiang Lang.

“Jiang Lang, stop! Do you want to kill your own family?” Jiang Shun’s expression changed drastically as he rushed to Jiang Qin’s front and took a blow from the infuriated Jiang Lang with difficulty.

“Get lost.” Jiang Lang’s eyes were bloodshot like that of a wild beast as his emotionless eyes swept across Jiang Shun coldly.
