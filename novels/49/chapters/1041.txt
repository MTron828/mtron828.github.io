Chapter 1042 Who is Afraid of Who (2)

Sensing the aura of the Ye Family powerful figures, the senior members and wardens of Yunxiao Sect were alarmed.

“Who is so daring to behave unmannerly at my Yunxiao Sect!” A warden instantly flew out of Yunxiao Sect and yelled sternly.

This Yunxiao Sect warden’s eyes were ice cold. He had been at Yunxiao Sect for a long time and never once thought that there would be anyone who dared to act wildly at the doorsteps of Yunxiao Sect!

The Yunxiao Sect warden was startled when he saw the Ye Family war flags. This war flag appeared very foreign, and he did not know which force these people were from.

“Who are you all? Report your names! How dare you all behave so wildly at the doorsteps of my Yunxiao Sect!” The Yunxiao Sect warden looked at Ye Qingtang and the rest and shouted sternly.

“Bai Kui.” Elder Bai Kui stepped forward and said coldly.

Upon hearing that, the Yunxiao Sect warden frowned slightly. When he saw Bai Kui’s face clearly, he was taken aback and extremely astounded.

As a YunXiao Sect warden, it was impossible for him to not know the Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire, the most powerful cultivator of Formidable Heavens Dynasty with a horrifying combat power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven.

“Formidable Heavens Dynasty Grand Imperial Sire…”

Very quickly, the Yunxiao Sect warden frowned as he looked at Elder Bai Kui. “Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui, what is the meaning of this!”

Although Bai Kui was the Grand Imperial Sire of Formidable Heavens Dynasty, he never had any enmity with Yunxiao Sect. Not mentioning this Grand Imperial Sire, Yunxiao Sect and Formidable Heavens Dynasty had always minded their own businesses without interfering with the other. It thus seemed unacceptable that the Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire brought so many cultivators and behaved this way at the doorsteps of Yunxiao Sect.

As he spoke, ten-plus wardens and several elders rushed out of Yunxiao Sect.

“Bai Kui, our Yunxiao Sect and the Formidable Heavens Dynasty never had anything to do with each other. What is the meaning of your actions today?” An elderly with white hair shouted coldly at Bai Kui.Visit website our Listnovel.com

The person who spoke was Yunxiao Sect’s Great Elder, Zhou Tian. He was at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Second Heaven and was considered acquaintances with Bai Kui.

“Zhou Tian, I am not here today as the Grand Imperial Sire of Formidable Heavens Dynasty,’ Bai Kui snickered as he looked at that elderly. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After hearing that, the Yunxiao Sect Great Elder frowned deeply as he did not understand what Bai Kui meant.

Regardless of what identity Bai Kui was assuming to challenge the YunXiao Sect, given Yunxiao Sect’s foundation, they were not the least afraid even if the entire Formidable Heavens Dynasty royals attacked them, much less Bai Kui.

“Humph. The Grand Elders of Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect are here at Yunxiao Sect as visitors. If you know what’s good for you, leave now. Yunxiao Sect can treat it as though nothing happened today.” The YunXiao Sect Great Elder looked at Bai Kui impatiently.

“Kill!”

Nonetheless, Bai Kui did not bother as he raised his right arm and shouted coldly.

As Elder Bai Kui gave his orders, the Yin Yang Perfected Lords of the Ye Family immediately charged towards the Yunxiao Sect wardens and elders.

Noticing the situation, the talented Ye Family disciples smirked. One of the youths at half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm snickered. “I’ve heard that YunXiao Sect is arrogant and conceited, but I never thought that it would be to this extent. Brothers and sisters, let’s show YunXiao Sect what disparity is.”

“Kill!”

In a moment, hundreds of talented disciples flexed their muscles, drew their weapons, and attacked Yunxiao Sect.
