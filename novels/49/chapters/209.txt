Qin Huan went berserk. Without caring about the beef in his hands, he sprinted away while screaming. “Senior Brother Gu! This is bad! Junior Sister Ye’s wolf disappeared! Help me to find it, pleaseeeeeeeee!”

…

At the same time, a tall man was pacing up and down the woods at the foot of the cliff below Xuanling Sect. Worry and anxiety were written all over his face.

“This Lady Ye… She kidnapped His Highness just like that. How… can I ‘rescue’ His Highness without alarming the Xuanling Sect… Lady Ye… you are being a bandit do you know…” Mu Su lingered outside Xuanling Sect for half a month and was about to go insane.

There was only one way to the sect, which was the Path to Heaven. Although he was completely able to fly up to Xuanling Sect on his own, doing that would definitely alarm everyone in Xuanling Sect.

Mu Su had a special identity, and if he suddenly appeared in Xuanling Sect, there would be a big stir in Xuanling Sect. Then, it would take him a lot of effort to find an excuse to deal with those oldies in Xuanling Sect, much less be able to search for someone.

There was no way he could tell the Xuanling Sect people that the noble and holy Palace Lord of the Antiquity Palace was forcefully abducted by their outer sect disciple, right?

And he was even being abducted in a freaking animal form.

If such words spread, all those old elders in Xuanling Sect would definitely be shocked.

Moreover… if His Highness’s identity was exposed, there was no doubt that his highness would behead him.

On one hand, he wanted to bring his highness back, but on the other, he could not let anyone find out about it… Mu Su was so worried that he dropped a bunch of hair, yet he still had not found a reliable method. Thus, he could only stand around and wait for His Highness to leave Xuanling Sect on his own.

After all, with His Highness’s skill, Xuanling Sect’s defense and perception were as good as non-existent.

However, half a month passed…

Mu Su felt that hope was getting increasingly slimmer.

Just as Mu Su was weighed down with worry, he suddenly saw a group of Xuanling Sect disciples coming down from the Path to Heaven and was shocked when he saw a familiar face walking past him.

Ye Qingtang slowly walked down the Path to Heaven, got on a horse that was already prepared for them, and left with a few other Xuanling Sect disciples.

“Lady Ye has left?” Mu Su watched Ye Qingtang leave and trembled in shock as he did not even see a “silver wolf” by Ye Qingtang’s side.

Lady Ye abducted His Highness, but why was she going out alone now?

Where was His Highness?

“Your Highness, you must know better… You must not be reluctant to come back after being abducted to be the wife of a bandit chief. Even if you want to woo Lady Ye, you don’t have to do it now…” Mu Su mumbled perplexedly. Before he finished his sentence, he felt a gush of cold air from behind him.

“Wife of a bandit chief?” A rather low voice suddenly sounded behind Mu Su.

Once Mu Su heard that voice, happiness filled him. He turned around and saw Han Cangming, whom he had been away from for a long time, standing behind him in his attractive human form.

Mu Su almost burst out crying there and then.

“Your Highness! You’re back!” Mu Su wiped a bitter tear away and was only this close from hugging Han Cangming’s leg.

However, there was a strange look on Han Cangming’s face. His cold eyes slowly looked at Mu Su, and he said softly, “What did you say just now?”
