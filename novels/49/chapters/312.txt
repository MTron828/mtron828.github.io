Chapter 313: Inner Sect Assessment (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I heard that the outer sect’s Ji Xianyuan is skilled and is ranked first on the ranking chart. I wonder if anyone will challenge him today,” the Herbal Faction elder said with a laugh. Then, he seemed to have recalled something and looked at Elder Lin.

“I heard that Lin Feng challenged the disciple who was ranked third on the outer sect’s ranking chart last month and was victorious. He is already ranked third on the ranking chart now.”

Upon hearing the words ‘Lin Feng,’ there was a slight change in Elder Lin’s expression. “Although Feng is young, he is diligent. I am not worried about him.”

“That is a given. Lin Feng is your grandson, and his natural endowments have been good since young. Holding the same family values as you, it seems to me that he will be able to make it today.” The Herbal Faction Elder laughed. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Whether he has the qualifications to enter the inner sect is still dependent on his performance today. This has nothing to do with whether he is my grandson or not,” Elder Lin said.

The Herbal Faction elder laughed and did not say anything further.

The few inner sect elders were all aware that the disciple placed third on the ranking charts was the grandchild of Elder Lin from the inner sect’s Sword Faction. He was indeed above average, and if there were no accidents, he should be able to enter the inner sect this year.

After taking a look at the outer sect disciples below, Elder Lin glimpsed at Elder Qin, whose expression was slightly ugly.

“Elder Qin, it’s been a few days since I saw you. Why are you so unhappy? Could it be that you regret granting Ye Qingtang the qualification to take part in this year’s assessment?” Although there was no emotion in Elder Lin’s tone, there was a hint of sarcasm in his words.

Half a month ago, Ye Qingtang presented a mystic treasure of the Blood Moon Sect to Elder Qin, and Elder Qin rewarded Ye Qingtang with a huge sum of Xuanming points. Yet unexpectedly… these Xuanming points were actually used to exchange for the inner sect assessment participation qualification.

A new disciple who just entered Xuanling Sect for a few months actually had the nerve to take part in this assessment. If this was not seeking death, then what was this?

Elder Qin was even more displeased after being mocked by Elder Lin.

“You’re over-thinking, Elder Lin. Since Ye Qingtang wants to do it, it is inconvenient for me to say anything. I am lost in thoughts only because I lost something. Thank you for worrying.”

Elder Qin was indeed in a foul mood at that point. That day when Ye Qingtang handed the Revolving Soul Orb to him, he kept it carefully once he returned to the sect. But a few days ago, that Revolving Soul Orb disappeared all of a sudden. He searched every corner in his room but could not find any trace of it and almost fainted in anger.

Elder Qin was aware of how rare the Revolving Soul Orb was. However, before the treasure that he just obtained was warm from his touch, it was already gone!

He was really infuriated.

Elder Lin looked at Elder Qin’s frustrated behavior, and a pleased expression emerged in his eyes. Then, he turned away and replied. “Since you lost something, you should search carefully.”

“Alright. It is about time, the competition is going to start soon. Let’s just watch first,” said the Fist Faction’s Elder.

The square was extremely boisterous. Disciples surrounded the ring, and some were burning with eagerness to try it out while some were waiting to watch the show.

At the other end of the ring, ten elegant and talented young disciples stood there in an imposing manner. Those were the disciples ranked top ten on the ranking charts. Although Dai Changming was in tenth place, his demeanor was also different from other disciples.

The appearance of these ten people attracted much attention. Envious and fearful eyes were cast towards them.

And just as everyone’s attention was focused on those ten people, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Sect Elder entered the square without a sound.
