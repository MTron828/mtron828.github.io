After Ye Qingtang agreed, Feng Jiuyou excitedly dragged her along.

Along the way, Ye Qingtang learned about the situation in Feng Jiuyou’s house from him.

The Feng family was just an extremely ordinary and small family. It was not like what was recorded in history, that he was born in a major faction in the Third Domain. They did not have any powerful bloodline, especially Feng Jiuyou, whose martial art skills were only mediocre. But he worked harder than

any of his peers.

Feng Jiuyou had already spent a lot of effort to be able to become a Divine Lord, and he seemed to be stuck at this level. Therefore, Feng Jiuyou took the risk to head up the mountain to see if he could find some precious herbs, to help him break through his bottleneck. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang could not believe it. Feng Jiuyou would become such a formidable force in the future. To think that he was so mediocre as a youth and someone who took so much effort just to break through to the Divine Lord stage.

In the future, Feng Jiuyou would be famous for killing and becoming the Sage Emperor of Swords. There were even records in history that Feng Jiuyou had long surpassed himself. In that attack against the Sky Moon Tower, Feng Jiuyou shattered the void, broke through the Dao and became an immortal,

going on to an even higher realm.

Of course, most people didn’t believe in such legends. It was said that those who broke the Dao could achieve immortality, but who had ever seen a true immortal? It was said that those who broke through the Dao would go on to an even higher realm, but who had seen that realm?

In the hearts of the people, all that was just a beautiful lie to motivate the martial arts practitioners of the world in their endless pursuit of immortality.

Even Ye Qingtang had not believed in that. She thought that after Feng Jiuyou’s attack, he might have just died from over-exhaustion.

However, Ye Qingtang had now overturned all her previous conjectures because of the yellow dog.

It turned out that there was indeed an upper realm!

Could it be that the former supreme experts, such as Feng Jiuyou, had disrupted the natural laws of the world and broken through the void, becoming immortals and entering the upper realm...

‘The big yellow dog once said that as long as one had enough strength, they could disrupt the natural laws in the lower realm and become qualified to enter the upper realm!

Perhaps Feng Jiuyou and those former supreme experts from even earlier eras did not die.

Ye Qingtang also thought of something else. The Ancient God Karma Tunnel sent her to this era. If she caused some changes now, would it result in some chain reaction into the future?

For example, if she killed a certain expert in this era, then returned to her own era, would that expert still exist... Did that mean he and his descendants would all disappear?

Or what would happen if she became good friends with the Heavenly Emperor or the Demon God Han Cangming in this era? Would their memories change after she returned to her own era?

To put it simply, now that she was acquainted with the young Feng Jiuyou. If she returned to her own era and met Feng Jiuyou again... would Feng Jiuyou remember her?

If she didn’t do anything in this era that would change in the future, that was fine.. But if her actions directly affected the future world...
