Peng Ji naturally nodded in agreement.

Shi Shangfei finally noticed Ye Qingtang and the rest standing by the side and his brows furrowed slightly. After scanning their group, he realized that the strongest amongst them was just a Paragon Eight Heaven level. He relaxed a little.

“Who are they?” Shi Shangfei asked.

Peng Ji answered, “They are the people I met just now...” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Peng Ji wanted to say that they were a bunch of crazy folks. With their mediocre powers, they dared to go against a Night Soul Beast. If Shi Shangfei and his team had not arrived in time and chased off the Night Soul Beast, he would have ended up dying with this group of fools.

“Who are you?” Shi Shangfei looked at Ye Qingtang and her group. As he spoke, his gaze naturally landed on Qin Feng.

This youth was the highest level amongst them. Although he was just a Paragon Eighth Heaven level, he should be the leader of the group.

Qin Feng’s face hardened but he didn’t answer. He just instinctively looked toward Ye Qing.

Ye Qing replied, “We are just your usual bounty hunters.”

In the various mainlands, there were many times when people were willing to pay money for some affairs to be settled or to seek out certain things. And so, there would naturally be people who were willing to carry out those tasks for the money.

This group of people was called bounty hunters.

At first, Spy Cloud was also a group of such people. But after their faction grew in power, they no longer dealt in such things.

Shi Shangfei frowned slightly after hearing Ye Qingtang say that they were bounty hunters. He clearly did not think much of them.

“This is not a place for you. If you don’t wish to die, please leave.”

He was trying to chase Ye Qingtang and her group away.

Ye Qingtang found it rather strange. Shi Shangfei was trying to chase them off and it triggered her curiosity. And the fact that Spy Cloud would send so many people into the Evil Soul Forest, this was definitely no normal mission.

Could it be...

Had Spy Cloud discovered something inside the Evil Soul Forest?

“We didn’t plan to stay here long. But we have already been marked by the Night Soul Beast and even if we dig up the entire Evil Soul Forest, we won’t be able to escape its pursuit.” Ye Qingtang gave a look of exasperation as she pinched the Night Soul Beast’s ear.

The Night Soul Beast: “...”

Who would want to pursue you? Let me go, I never want to see you again!

Shi Shangfei had of course heard of the myths surrounding the Night Soul Beast. As such, he did not suspect Ye Qingtang’s words.

But Peng Ji said, “Since we were fated to meet, I still advise you to leave here as soon as possible. You were lucky today. Although you encountered the Night Soul Beast, you also met our Division Head Shi. If he had not scared off that Night Soul Beast, you guys would probably already... if you don’t leave now, that beast will definitely try to attack you again after we depart.”

Peng Ji really felt that this bunch of fools wouldn’t survive for long in this Evil Soul Forest. They had just been lucky to meet Spy Cloud men, otherwise, they would have all been dead.

Ye Qingtang didn’t say anything to Peng Ji’s warning. She just put on a conflicted and fearful expression.

Only the Night Soul Beast in her arms knew.

This person looked fearful but she was completely calm on the inside. Otherwise why wasn’t it growing even a little?

“Thank you,” said Ye Qingtang.

Peng Ji gave a small smile. His injuries were grave and he couldn’t be bothered with them anymore. Shi Shangfei led his team and left.

But after traveling a short distance, Shi Shangfei suddenly asked, “Peng Ji, did you notice anything strange about those earlier folks?”
