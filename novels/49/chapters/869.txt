Chapter 870 Flawless

Ye Qingtang ran into the deeper parts of the forest within a second.

Perfected Gu Yun was extremely fast as well. He turned into a streak of light and disappeared as well.

Soon, Perfected Gu Yun traced Ye Qingtang’s leaving path and entered the deep parts of the forest.

However, at that moment, golden rays of lights appeared around him, and he smelled something ancient.

Perfected Gu Yun’s face changed instantly. Before he had any reaction, he was surrounded by the golden rays of light.

“Sealed Sky Formation?”

Perfected Gu Yun sized up his surroundings in the golden light and murmured.

The Sealed Sky Formation was a special array formation of the Supreme Academy. It was invented by a few of the previous presidents together.

The Sealed Sky Formation was extremely powerful, but it required a few people to set up the formation. It would take a few hours at least.

Why is there a Sealed Sky Formation here…

Ye Qingtang walked out from the dark. She scoffed as she stared at Perfected Gu Yun, who was trapped inside the golden light.

Perfected Gu Yun would never be able to imagine that his every moment was well-known by Ling Yan. He would not expect that Ling Yan had warned her earlier that Perfected Gu Yun would try to kill her, and she had prepared the Sealed Sky Formation of the Supreme Academy to lurk him into the trap.

“You… you were prepared?!”

Perfected Gu Yun, who was trapped inside the golden lights, said coldly as Ye Qingtang appeared from the dark.

“Isn’t that obvious?” Ye Qingtang scoffed.

“You knew when I was going to find you… So, you set the golden light array…” Perfected Gu Yun scoffed.

“What a shame. You found out about it way too late.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“How did you know my presence and how did you know that I would be here to kill you…” Perfected Gu Yun frowned and said.

However, before Ye Qingtang said anything, Perfected Gu Yun’s expression suddenly changed. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Is it… Ling Yan?!”

Perfected Gu Yun seemed to recall something suddenly and was shocked.

“

“You’re smart. It’s Ling Yan indeed.” Ye Qingtang smiled softly and said.

“It’s impossible! How could he know that I betrayed him… Furthermore, I wasn’t with him for the whole time recently. How could he know that I would be here to kill you!” Perfected Gu Yun shouted angrily.

All the things he had done were considered flawless. He even hid his martial breath when he stalked Ling Yan. He always stood far from here, so he was sure that he would never be discovered. However, despite that, Ling Yan still discovered his identity…

Ye Qingtang shook her head and said, “Why are you still asking so many questions when you know he’s Ling Yan… He would definitely know everything since you betrayed him. What he had done was based on his own inference. Even if he inferred wrongly, he could just prepare beforehand to prevent any loss… You have at least followed Ling Yan for so many years. How come your understanding of him is scarcer than mine?”

“Bullsh*t!” Perfected Gu Yun shouted in rage. Everything he had done was useless and a waste of time. He was like a naked clown in Ling Yan’s eyes?!

“Perfected Gu Yun, you’re trapped inside the Sealed Sky Formation now. What else can you do?” Ye Qingtang said.

Upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, Perfected Gu Yun pulled himself out from his thoughts. A cold smile appeared on his face, and he said, “Young lady, do you really think that the Sealed Sky Formation of the Supreme Academy can trap me forever?!”
