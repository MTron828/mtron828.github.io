Chapter 539 Displaying One’s Remarkable Prowess (2)

The Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix which turned red flapped its wings instantly and hovered in the sky, becoming a member of the Blood Moon Sect.

“My Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix…” Ye You was shocked to witness her own Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix listening to that girl.

Her Master, the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master, personally sought this Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix for her, and it was extraordinarily precious. Yet, it was actually snatched by the Blood Moon Sect members today!

“That girl is… one of the one hundred and eight Branch Masters, Fiendish Demon…” Li Chenfeng had a serious expression when he recognized the other party’s identity immediately after seeing that she controlled the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix.

It was said that Fiendish Demon was transformed from a demonic beast, and it could control spirit animals and demonic beasts and even assimilate them.

Currently, the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix was already assimilated by the Fiendish Demon and no longer belonged to Ye You…

“Come back,” Ye You said gently as she looked at the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix that hovered above the Blood Moon Sect members.

However…

The blood-colored Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix glanced at Ye You without any warmth like before. Its eyes were cold and indifferent and even had a trace of disdain

“Blood Moon Sect, what exactly do you all want!” A Yunxiao Sect elder shouted at that instant.

“There are two goals for coming here today,” Shuo Tianzang said.

“Firstly, to kill our sect betrayer, Qu Zhongyang, and secondly, to annihilate Yunxiao Sect.” Soul Severing Troll added on.

“What?!” That Yunxiao Sect elder clenched his teeth. “Don’t push your luck, Blood Moon Sect… There were hundreds of sects who annihilated your sect back then. Why must you all come at Yunxiao Sect the moment you all appear and not other sects?!”

“What you said is right.” Shuo Tianzang looked at that Yunxiao Sect elder apathetically.

At that instant, the Xuanling Sect masses were shaken as they looked at the Blood Moon Sect forces in midair.

This was the colossus that took over the world a thousand years ago…

As powerful as Yunxiao Sect was, it, however, no longer had any attitude before the Blood Moon Sect.

In the blood carriage, the Blood Moon Elder looked out and shook his head. “Xuanling Sect really sustained heavy damages If we came any later, I’m afraid it would already have been annihilated by Yunxiao Sect.”

A cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes at that moment. She had already rushed over at the fastest speed. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang stood up and looked downward. It was haphazard in Xuanling Sect. The disciples’ corpses seemed to pile into a small mountain while the boundless blood reflected in her eyes like a flame that burned ragingly.

Then, Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes as she looked at Ye You not far away.

That Ye You who personally snatched her spirit root away!

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered, but she did not give any orders to the Blood Moon Sect members.

She took a deep breath quietly and suppressed all her emotions, allowing her eyes to slowly return to a calm expression.

She came today not to settle scores with Ye You but to rescue Xuanling Sect, and thus, she should prioritize the overall situation.

With a Blood Moon Sect Division in action, the other super sects in Formidable Heavens Dynasty would hear of it and rush over shortly after. She must save her sect from the misery in the shortest time possible.

As for Ye You…

They still had a long time ahead of them in the future, and she would slowly settle this score with Ye You!

At that instant, Li Chenfeng glimpsed across the blood carriage that the eight demonic beasts were pulling and asked, “I wonder who is in the carriage?”

“You’re not qualified to know.” The Blood Moon Division Head sneered coldly.

However, as the Blood Moon Division Head finished his sentence, the carriage door was suddenly opened.
