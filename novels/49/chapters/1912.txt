Chapter 1913: Tricks (1)

Narrowing her eyes, Ye Qingtang touched the hem of her sleeve.

Boom!

With a wave of her arm, the lavender fire crashed into her with no effects. She appeared to have exerted no effort at all.

Right before the eyes of everyone, the ferocious lavender flame was instantly changed into a clear blue spring...

There were sounds of splashing...

Then the clear blue spring waters splashed onto the ground, soaking the earth around Ye Qingtang. Elation danced in the eyes of everyone from the Temple of Shadows who witnessed this scene. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Did you really think you had to be worried for me?” Ye Qingtang gazed mildly at the undead who had been so anxious for her. Now, those undead just felt like cheering out loud upon seeing Ye Qingtang’s grand manner.

“The Holy Lord is magnificent!” Xue Fu hollered. Within seconds, all the undead started cheering for their Holy Lord.

The face of the effeminate-looking youth was filled with shock. Only he knew that he had not held back at all in his previous attack. He never expected his Cosmic Thunderbolt could be so easily disintegrated with just a single wave by the Holy Lord of Shadows.

In contrast to his previous arrogance, the youth looked somewhat grim now. Things had always gone his way, how was he to endure this setback?

“You have already made your move. It ends now.” Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly as she cast a sweeping glance at the youth.

The lips of the effeminate-looking youth twitched slightly as a sense of unease rose in his heart.

The Holy Lord of Shadows might have gone missing for 10,000 years but she had once been the most powerful being on the mainland.

Ye Qingtang had transformed his all-out attack into a puddle of spring water. His attack did not even come close to touching Ye Qingtang. The youth had never experienced something like this before.

Fear of the Holy Lord of Shadows subconsciously crept into the youth’s heart. Shifting his gaze, he suddenly leaped up and fled from the Temple of Shadows.

The ice encasing Ming Wang disappeared following the departure of the youth. Ming Wang staggered forward, his body full of injuries.

“Trying to escape?!” Lady Ghost wanted to pursue the effeminate-looking youth.

But she was stopped by Ye Qingtang.

“Let us take a look at Ming Wang’s injuries first.” Ye Qingtang spoke magnanimously, but she was heaving a huge sigh of relief on the inside.

Thank goodness she had been able to fake her way through this!!

Ye Qingtang had hidden the Mirror of Illusions in her sleeve and she was now discreetly placing it back in her space ring. Even now she was thanking the heavens it had worked.

There was no way she would be able to defeat the effeminate-looking youth if she were to pit her powers against his. As a result, she had come up with the “one move” condition, intending to use the Mirror of Illusions to play a trick on the youth and scare him off.

If Lady Ghost dragged him back now...

Ye Qingtang would be completely helpless.

After all, Ming Wang was already the strongest amongst all the undead at present and even he was powerless before the youth. If things dragged on, Ye Qingtang would be forced to reveal her bluff.

Lady Ghost was taken aback. She immediately assented and turned back to help Ming Wang. But Ming Wang shrugged her aside.

“Thank you Holy Lord for stepping in. I am useless, please enact your punishment.” Despite his heavy injuries, Ming Wang got down on his knees before Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang sighed inwardly at Ming Wang’s actions.

“This person has very strange abilities and an unknown background. Since you already have experienced fighting him, go and investigate his background,” Ye Qingtang commanded.

This was her way of glossing over Ming Wang’s request for punishment.

Although Ming Wang frowned slightly, he didn’t say anything more. He only accepted her order and retreated immediately.
