1328 Force Him to Revolt 3

The Second Princess left very soon to discuss the matter with the Advisor. Ye Qingtang was not in a hurry either as she came up with this plan very seriously and was confident that the Advisor would consent.

Before eliminating Ling Yan, the Temple of Shadows and the Advisor had the same goal.

The Eldest Prince and the rest also took this time to make the preparations. They initially made many schemes to deal with Ling Yan, but after hearing what Ye Qingtang said, they hurried to cancel them.

Ye Qingtang returned to her room and informed Ling Yan of her plans.

She wanted to prove herself to the Temple of Shadows but did not wish to really harm Ling Yan. However… if things developed according to her plan, Ling Yan only had two routes.

One was to lose the Crown Prince title. The other was to start a military revolt.

However, Ye Qingtang felt that the safest way was to lose the Crown Prince title as it was temporary, and there was still a chance of gaining it back in the future.

On one side, Ye Qingtang contacted Ling Yan.

On the other, Lady Ghost secretly met up with Ming Wang.

“Holy Son Ming Wang, what do you think of Holy Lord’s plan?” Lady Ghost looked at Ming Wang. She had to admit that Ye Qingtang’s plan was more meticulous than before, and even she herself was rather surprised.

There was no expression on Ming Wang’s face, and he merely looked at Ye Qingtang’s tightly-shut door.

“Secretly send someone to inform Ling Yan…”

Lady Ghost was stunned.

“What do you wish to reveal to Ling Yan, Holy Son Ming Wang?”

Ming Wang replied. “That Elder Ye is the Holy Lord of Shadows.”

Lady Ghost understood immediately.

“Only let Ling Yan know of this matter.” Ming Wang ordered coldly.

“Yes!”

Ming Wang narrowed his eyes. Assisting the Eldest Prince to become the Crown Prince was a definite, but they also wanted Ling Yan to verify Ye Qingtang’s identity.

…

In the Advisor’s residence.

The Second Princess hurried to the Advisor’s residence at once after leaving the Eldest Prince’s residence and informed the Advisor of Ye Qingtang’s plan.

After hearing it, the Advisor frowned slightly.

“Advisor, what do you think of that Elder Ye’s suggestion?” The Second Princess asked.

The Advisor remained silent for a while, but the corners of his lips suddenly curled up.

“Not bad.”

The Second Princess exhaled immediately.

The Advisor continued speaking. “The Temple of Shadows has been on the decline for some time, but it never lost its fundamental strength. This Elder Ye’s plan is very decent and can resolve the immediate problem.”

“Shall I arrange people to make the preparations then?” The Second Princess asked.

The Advisor nodded slightly, and the Second Princess immediately took her leave.

After she left, the Advisor slowly returned to the study, where a young man was already waiting for him.

“Lord Shui.” The young man immediately bowed when he noticed the Advisor entering.

The Advisor nodded but did not say anything. Lightly tapping his face with his fingertip, his aged facial features, wrinkles, and white mustache disappeared in an instant.

Replacing them was a face that was even more beautiful than a lady’s.

“Are you here because Master has an order?” After returning to his young face, the Advisor casually sat on a chair near him and looked at the young man who kneeled before him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The young man was from the Sacred Ground of Reflection and was here specially for the crowning of Ling Yan as the Crown Prince.

“Master heard that the Temple of Shadows’s ambassador is here as well and that she seems to be keen on supporting the Eldest Prince.” The young man replied.

The Advisor looked down slightly and uttered without emotion. “There is indeed such a matter, but it’s fine. Reply to Master that the Eternal Dynasty situation is still in control and that he can rest assured.”

“Noted.”
