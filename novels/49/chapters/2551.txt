Chapter 2552: Dragon Emperor Clan (12)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The sight of the room rendered Ye Qingtang speechless by the Dragon Emperor Clan’s extravagance. Surely the term luxurious was not enough to describe this.

There were some elixirs on the table that even Ye Qingtang could not refine. Even those that she could see were extremely rare and precious, requiring dozens of herbs which would be difficult to obtain outside. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The way the Dragon Emperor Clan treated their guests was truly an eye-opener for Ye Qingtang.

“Not bad!”

At that instant, the big yellow dog suddenly opened its eyes and stared at the table full of food. It drooled all over Ye Qingtang.

Seeing that, Ye Qingtang threw the big yellow dog aside in disdain. Was this the reincarnation of a hungry ghost?

The big yellow dog did not stand on ceremony and leaped onto the dining table to eat.

Looking at the big yellow dog’s eating habits, Ye Qingtang sighed. How long had it been since she last ate? Didn’t the big yellow dog say that it came from the so-called upper realm? Did the upper realm not have delicacies?

“Little girl, let me ask you. What’s in this bottle? It smells quite good to me.” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang and wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. “Elixir.”

“Elixir?” After learning what was in the bottle, the big yellow dog was rather disdainful. “Look, you humans just like to take advantage of every opportunity to mess around. What’s so good about elixirs? Aren’t they just processed products? You gathered and crushed so many natural and fragile spirit medicines together to make them into these ridiculous pills. You humans are simply wasting God’s gifts. Forget it, I’ll have a taste.”

With that, the big yellow dog opened its mouth to swallow the elixir. However, Ye Qingtang quickly grabbed the pill.

“Humans love to waste natural resources. Don’t commit sins like us. It’s better not to take it.” Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog.

“Hmph, what’s the big deal? There’s nothing my canine race has not tasted before.” The big yellow dog snorted.

“I think you guys don’t know how to refine elixirs,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Even if we knew how to refine it, we wouldn’t do it,” said the big yellow dog.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. The dog did not know how to refine elixirs at all. If the so-called canine race knew how to refine elixirs, it would not have said those words just now.

“Little girl, I’m full. When are we leaving… Also, when are you sending me back to the upper realm? I want to go home.” The big yellow dog stared at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was baffled. “When did I say I would send you back to the upper realm?”

Ye Qingtang remembered the rules of returning to the upper realm very clearly. Either she had to break the natural rules of the world or she had to destroy them. It was completely unrealistic. At the very least, it was completely impossible for her at her current level.

“You promised me earlier that you would send me back to the upper realm,” said the big yellow dog.

“My memory is very good. I never said that.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“I don’t care. Since you brought me out of that Wailing Well, you will have to grant me a wish. My wish is to return to the upper realm. Otherwise, you have to send me back to that Wailing Well,” the big yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

She already saved the big yellow dog from the Wailing Well, and now she still had to grant this major wish as well?
