Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It’s still the Hell of Avicinaraka… We did not manage to get out.” Ye Qingtang sighed softly.

Though the Space-transfer Talisman could ignore the constraints of space and send the user to all places, the space energy in Ye Qingtang’s talisman was very limited. If Ye Qingtang used it alone, she would definitely be able to leave the Hell of Avicinaraka. However, the power was limited when she brought the Blood Moon Elder along. As a result, they just escaped from the palace.

“Holy Lady… if… if just now you used for yourself, you should be out of the Hell of Avicinaraka by now…” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang. He did not understand why Ye Qingtang would grab him at that key moment.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder and said, “You have been following me for so long and helped me in various ways. How would I leave you and escape along at the point of death and survival?”

The Blood Moon Elder froze as he heard Ye Qingtang’s words. He felt it was hard to believe as he looked at Ye Qingtang who stood in front of him.

He had lived for a thousand years and had many friends…

They were brothers in normal days, but when it came to the point of death or survival, everyone only cared about themselves. It was the same for him as well!

If he was in Ye Qingtang’s position just now, he would definitely not care about others. Leaving the place alive was the key thing. However, he did not expect that…

“What? Are you touched?” Ye Qingtang made fun of the Blood Moon Elder as he was stunned.

“Holy Lady… I…” The Blood Moon Elder did not know what to say as he looked at Ye Qingtang who was many years younger to him.

Ye Qingtang forced him to sign the contract when they first met. He followed her unwillingly, and he wanted to kill the woman to free himself all the time…

However, when he identified her identity as the Blood Moon Holy Lady, he could only listen to her and obey her…

Today, Ye Qingtang had the chance to escape from the Hell of Avicinaraka. However, she brought him along at the last moment.

“Okay, I believe that you would not leave me there as well if it was you, right?” Ye Qingtang chuckled as she looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady, I definitely would not!” The Blood Moon Elder’s eyesight was firm at that moment.

The Blood Moon Elder did not even imagine that Ye Qingtang would bring him along in the palace. However, Ye Qingtang grabbed his left shoulder and brought him out of the palace at the last moment.

If not, Ye Qingtang would have escaped from the Hell of Avicinaraka… RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

If he was given another chance, he would definitely not escape alone.

Ye Qingtang gestured to keep quiet before the Blood Moon Elder could say anything.

Ye Qingtang paid attention to the sounds in their surroundings.

There was a horrifying roar of a beast from far just now. She could vaguely hear fighting sounds as well.

“Let’s go and take a look.”

Ye Qingtang frowned and waved her hands. She then walked swiftly towards the valley in front.

The valley was huge without visible borders. The sounds of people and beasts could spread to far places. Ye Qingtang also could not locate the origin of the sounds she heard just now.

However, it would be extremely difficult for the two of them to survive in the Hell of Avicinaraka. They needed to find more members of the super sects and work with them in order to survive.
