Jiang Liu only heaved a sigh of relief after Mo Yi left. His back was soaked in cold sweat.

“Third Brother, why do you need to be so timid? That Mo Yi is just too disrespectful. We have numbers on our side. Why should we be afraid of her!” Jiang Qin was angered by Jiang Liu’s weak nature.

But Jiang Liu said, “Can you calm down? So what if we have numbers on our side? You know that Mo Yi is from the Ancient Dynasty.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“What about the Ancient Dynasty? It’s been dead for ten thousand years. The Central Mainland of today is no longer in the era of the Ancient Dynasty. Our Jiang Family is the current Domain Monarch!” Jiang Qin said coldly.

“The Ancient Dynasty no longer exists, but don’t you know about the Ancient Dynasty’s strange cultivation techniques? We’ve known Mo Yi for many years, but no one has ever determined her cultivation level. Father will end his seclusion in a few days. Everything can wait until he ends his seclusion and deals with it. Why do you need to be so impatient?” Jiang Liu frowned and seemed rather agitated.

Jiang Qin wanted to continue, but Tuoba Yao pulled her aside, so she only grunted coldly.

Ye You, who was standing nearby, was completely ashen. This time, her pallor was real, unlike her previous act.

“You’er, don’t worry. Aunt Qin will back you up. I would like to see whether that Mo Yi has the ability to touch you within the Jiang Family.” Jiang Qin looked at Ye You’s paper-white face and comforted her tenderly.

“Aunt Qin… I’m frightened… Ye Qingtang’s mother says she’s going to dig out my spirit root… I know Ye Qingtang hates me, but… but we’re sisters…” Ye You pretended to quiver in fright and looked pitiable.

Jiang Qin felt even more tenderness towards her. “What sisters? She’s not fit to be your sister. If she had not tattled to Mo Yi and asked Mo Yi to come and dig out your spirit root, Mo Yi would not know about all this.”

Ye You secretly wept pitifully.

…

Meanwhile, Mo Yi brought Ye Qingtang back to the western courtyard, and Ye Qingtang invited Mo Yi into her room.

Mo Yi studied the room, then tugged at Ye Qingtang’s hand, and sat down. She spoke.

“Tang Tang, don’t worry. I will certainly get your spirit root back for you. There were too many of them just now. If I took the risk and just fought them to the death, I’m afraid Jiang Qin and the others would harm you out of desperation.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Mo Yi. Although she knew Mo Yi was not her real mother, her heart was filled with warmth.

She had been adopted by Ye Ling when she was young, and she had never had a mother or experienced a mother’s love. This time, she had traveled to the Central Dynasty hoping to find her mother.

But at that moment, Mo Yi had allowed her to experience the greatness of a mother’s love.

Which was to protect her child at all costs, even if she made enemies of everyone else.

“I know, Mother.”

Mo Yi was startled to be called “Mother”. Her limpid eyes suddenly grew moist. She gathered Ye Qingtang into her arms and half-closed her eyes, caressing this treasure that had once been lost.

“These years have been hard on you. But now that you have returned to my side, I will protect you. If anyone has hurt you, I will avenge you.”

Ye Qingtang almost greedily luxuriated in this precious maternal love.

Whether in her past or present life, this was her first time experiencing such warmth.

But at that moment, she could not help but envy the green-robed girl for having such a doting mother.

When she thought of the green-robed girl, Ye Qingtang somehow felt that she had overlooked something.
