Chapter 2500: Underground Demon God (10)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Above the Wailing Well was a group of elders. They were standing everywhere, with a huge altar in the center of them, as though they were holding an unknown ceremony.

“There shouldn’t be anyone still alive. There must be a mistake,” the elder holding the golden book said.

“Even though we have collected enough young blood, it is an insult to us for anyone to be left alive. We have to make sure that they do not get out no matter what,” one of the elders said coldly.

“It doesn’t matter. Now that we have collected enough young blood, we can close the exit. Let’s close it first then we can speak more,” the elder holding the golden book said.

...

At that moment, near the Ice Ocean, the big yellow dog was wagging its tail and looking up at the sky. After a long while, it said, “What are those old men doing? They even have an altar there and are muttering something.”

As soon as the big yellow dog said that, everyone froze.

There were people above them?

Everyone looked up but did not see the people that the big yellow dog was referring to.

“Hold on, I think they’re saying that they are closing the exit, ” the big yellow dog said as it scratched its head with its paw.

“Where are the people?” Lei Yan’s face was filled with curiosity. Why could the dog see them and not him?

Ye Qingtang observed for a long time but could not see anyone as well. But she did not doubt the big yellow dog’s words at all.

“They are saying that they are going to close the exit?” She seemed to be thinking of something and her expression changed slightly.

The big yellow dog nodded and said, “That’s right, not only are they saying that they want to close the exit, they also want you all dead. I’m only a dog so I don’t think I’m a part of their calculations.”

“We need to leave immediately!” Ye Qingtang shouted without another second of hesitation. They would be in grave danger if the exit was closed!

But just as she said that, the Ice Ocean started melting right in front of their eyes.

They had no idea what this meant but they all had a bad feeling about it.

“I think the exit will be completely closed once the Ice Ocean melts,” the big yellow dog said.

“Quickly!” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply, not caring about anything else. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Boss, you leave first!” Nangong Lie said hurriedly.

“Rubbish, you all go first. I have the Space Technique, so even if I can’t leave, they won’t be able to get to me,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Alright…” Nangong Lie nodded and quickly entered the Ice Ocean.

They all knew that Ye Qing had the Space Technique. And rather than argue about who to go first, they should stop wasting time and make sure that everyone could leave.

The Ice Ocean was made from magic and in reality, the exit was small and only one person could leave at any one time.

In the span of just a few breaths, the Ice Ocean had shrunk to half its size.

Without wasting any more time, they left in an orderly manner without fighting for the exit.

“Quick, it’s about to close completely!” Ye Qingtang watched as the Ice Ocean was about to completely melt away.

“Boss, let’s leave together!”

Yun Chen looked at Ye Qing, not wanting to leave him behind.

“What nonsense are you speaking!”

Without giving him a chance to say anything else, Ye Qingtang kicked Yun Chen into the Ice Ocean.

“Justー”

Just as Yun Chen was kicked into the Ice Ocean, it completely melted, with no signs of there ever being an exit.
