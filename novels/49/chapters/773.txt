Chapter 774 Peerless School (3)

The Falling Sky Valley wardens never thought that the Peerless School disciples would be so ruthless and were stunned.

“Mercy… I’m wrong. I will not dare to do it again. Please spare my life…” Frightened out of his wits, the disciple knelt on the ground and kowtowed repeatedly as he begged for mercy.

The other Falling Sky Valley disciples were extremely despondent when they witnessed the sight.

However, the Peerless School disciple did not take pity on the Falling Sky Valley disciple. He lifted his hand slightly, and a ray of golden light was shot out from his palm once again, killing that imploring disciple instantly.

From the start to the end, the Falling Sky Valley wardens from aside could not utter any pleas for leniency.

The Falling Sky Valley disciples were dead silent, and they trembled at the sight of the two dead bodies on the ground.

At that instant, Perfected Xuanchen and a few other elders walked over together. Xuanyuan Lie followed behind the Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master.

When the Falling Sky Valley disciples saw them, hope rose in their hearts.

“We were unaware of your arrival. Excuse us for not going out to meet you earlier.” Perfected Xuanchen greeted.

The two Peerless School disciples swept a look over perfunctorily.

Xuanyuan Lie, who was standing behind the Full Moon Peak Peak Master, glanced across the surrounding and felt that the atmosphere was strange. It was then he noticed the corpses of two Falling Sky Valley disciples not far away.

“This is…”

“This two disciples offended the Peerless School envoys just now and was punished by the envoys.” A warden explained.

Perfected Xuanchen’s eyes dimmed upon hearing it.

Xuanyuan Lie frowned slightly, and this reaction caused a trace of hope to arise in the Falling Sky Valley disciples’ hearts.

Xuanyuan Lie was the number one talent of Falling Sky Valley, and he would probably be infuriated when the Peerless School disciples killed Falling Sky Valley disciples so casually on Falling Sky Valley’s

turf.

However…

Xuanyuan Lie suddenly turned around and bowed to those two Peerless School disciples with cupped fists. “We have troubled you. It truly is our negligence for Falling Sky Valley to have such insolent disciples. Please don’t take offense, envoys.”

Xuanyuan Lie’s words stunned many disciples.

“Since it’s negligence, there better not be such an incident ever again, lest our hands are dirtied,” a Peerless School disciple said.

“Rest assured, envoys. There will never be such a case again in the future.” Xuanyuan Lie agreed.

The Peerless School disciples nodded slightly before looking straight at Falling Sky Valley’s Perfected Xuanchen.

“Perfected Xuanchen, are Falling Sky Valley’s tribute for this year prepared?”

Perfected Xuanchen repressed his emotions and replied. “They have been prepared long ago.”

Then, he exchanged a look with an elder beside him, who directly handed the list of tributes to the Peerless School disciples.

The Peerless School demanded a huge quantity of tributes. Apart from large amounts of superior-grade Spirit Stones, they even required hundreds of Dharma treasures.

It could be said that at least half of the entire Falling Sky Valley’s earnings landed in the pockets of the Peerless School

The Peerless School disciples received the list of tributes, and sneers hung on their lips after taking a glance.

“The quantity doesn’t seem to be right, doesn’t it?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Perfected Xuanchen was slightly dumbfounded. “Everything on the list is prepared according to the rules that the Peerless School had set in the previous years.”
