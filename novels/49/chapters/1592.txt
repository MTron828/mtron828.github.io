Chapter 1593 Allied Forces 3

The wounded teen guard originally thought that the innocent girl would also be slain by the sword, but unexpectedly, he witnessed that girl killing the strong allied force soldier casually.

Ye Qingtang remained emotionless as she watched the allied force soldier collapse before her. Bending down slightly, she helped up the teen guard who wanted to protect her and discreetly fed him a pill before gently sending him to a safe spot at the border of the battlefield.

“You...” A look of surprise was reflected in the youth’s eyes as he stared blankly at Ye Qingtang’s stunning face under the moonlight.

However, in the next second, Ye Qingtang leaped up and flew toward the most intense area of conflict on the battlefield.

The mission that the God of Nature assigned her was to help the Supreme League Kingdom unify the mainland; thus, its enemies could be killed! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

In the chaotic battlefield, a white figure suddenly appeared...

The troops from the opposing camps were locked in a fierce battle, but they suddenly saw a petite girl appearing before their eyes.

Before the guards could react, that girl turned into the incarnation of a death god and killed five allied force soldiers instantly like a bolt of lightning.

Blood splattered everywhere. Before the guards could take a clear look at her face, she disappeared before their eyes once again.

However, wherever she appeared, the soldiers of the allied forces died tragically without any chance to struggle or resist, just like a powerless lamb waiting to be slaughtered!

Given the martial skills of this world, Ye Qingtang could easily kill thousands of people in a second with her current martial realm. However, the soldiers of the Supreme League Kingdom were entangled in this fight, and Ye Qingtang was worried that she may accidentally kill a few Supreme League Kingdom soldiers.

Helpless, she could only control her powers to prevent the Supreme League Kingdom soldiers from being harmed.

Yet even so, her appearance completely turned the tables around!

On the battlefield, General Mark was on a horse as he slashed his sword around and killed numerous enemies. However, at this very instant, his body was covered with many injuries, and his breathing gradually turned irregular.

The guards fighting alongside Mark were extremely worn out as well, and their expressions darkened as they noticed the continual decline in guards.

“General Mark, we can’t fight on like this anymore. Otherwise, all of our brothers will die here!”

“General!”

“To hell with being afraid of them! Even if our entire troop is wiped out, we must not retreat! Kill!” Mark roared in a deep tone.

Just as everyone was completely disheartened, they suddenly realized that the allied forces around them seemed to be decreasing continuously.

“What’s happening? Could it be that the troops in the nearby town found out about the war? And rushed over to provide reinforcements?”

“Impossible. The nearest town to us is about two to three days’ journey away from us. It’s impossible for them to find...”

“General Mark, look!” A guard seized an opportunity and shouted loudly while pointing in the air above the battlefield with his sword.

Mark looked in the direction, only to see a slender figure shuttling through the battlefield like a bolt of lightning. Blood splattered every area she passed by, and countless allied forces soldiers were killed by that white streak of lightning.
