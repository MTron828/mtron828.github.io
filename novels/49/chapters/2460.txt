In fact, the little azure dragon had even heard from its ancestors that when one reached the peak of chaos, you could make the sky lose its color and everything turn into foam and dust. One could rewrite history and make things that had never happened to come into existence.

This was a change that no living being could understand. And this power to change was in the Chaotic Realm.

“Ling Yan, you want to enter the Chaos Realm?!” The little azure dragon was excited.

“I…” Ling Yan smiled.” I can’t enter. “

“What do you mean?” The little azure dragon couldn’t understand.

Blood slowly flowed from the corner of Ling Yan’s lips.

At that moment, Ling Yan waved his right arm and the stream of light in the air disappeared in an instant, as if it had left the Ancient God Realm.

After doing this, Ling Yan’s face turned pale as a faint smile appeared on his lips. “Miss Ye… It’s all up to you now.”

‘We are destined to meet in another era…’

But after some time, the little azure dragon laughed. “Ling Yan, oh Ling Yan… everyone says that a great man must be ruthless. And you are the most ruthless person I’ve ever seen.”

“Boom!”

Ye Qingtang and the others, who were watching the demon battle, suddenly heard a loud bang.

“What’s that?!”

Lei Yan jumped in fright and looked around worriedly, afraid that the demons would notice him.

Nangong Lie pointed at Ye Qingtang in surprise. “Boss, you exploded!”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. “You’re the one who exploded.”

“Boss, you really exploded!” Lei Yan looked at her.

A strange expression appeared on Ye Qingtang’s face as she instinctively touched her pockets.

“Voice transmission stone…”

Ye Qingtang’s face turned solemn when she looked at the shattered voice transmission stone.

This was the voice transmission stone which Ling Yan had given her.

All this while, Ye Qingtang had carried this voice transmission stone so that she could contact Ling Yan anytime. What Ye Qingtang could not understand was that this voice transmission stone had been made with a very special material. It could withstand a full-scale attack by an Emperor level practitioner.

In other words, even if Ye Qingtang herself was destroyed, the voice transmission stone would remain unscathed.

So why did the voice transmission stone suddenly shatter?

“Little girl, can you still hear me?”

Suddenly, a vaguely familiar voice could be heard from the voice transmission stone.

“Little azure dragon?” Ye Qingtang was surprised.

“Listen to me… you have to listen to me properly. From now on, you have to be careful of the person with a mark between his brows. Be it a man, woman, dog or animal… also, keep this voice transmission stone properly. You must not lose it!”

However after far, no matter what Ye Qingtang did, there was no more sound.

“Could something have happened to Ling Yan…” For some reason, Ye Qingtang could not calm down.

However, on second thought, she felt that it was unlikely. She could believe it was possible for something to happen to any other legendary figure in this world, but she would never believe that something could happen to Ling Yan.

That man had everything under control. What could happen to him?

Ye Qingtang stared at the shattered voice transmission stone. She had no choice but to wrap it up carefully before placing it in her space ring.

Since the other party had instructed her not to lose it, it was better for her to do so.

As for being careful of a person who had a red mark between his eyebrows.

The image of her brother, the Blood Moon Holy Lord, instantly appeared in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

Did the little azure dragon mean for her to beware of the little Holy Lord Blood Moon?

However, after thinking about it carefully, it seemed unlikely. Ling Yan knew of the Blood Moon Holy Lord. He would have just named him if he wanted her to beware of him. There was no need to be so cryptic..
