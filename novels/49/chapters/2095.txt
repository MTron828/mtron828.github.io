Chapter 2096: Reincarnation (3)

“Could you tell me where your extra three hundred years of memories are from then?”

Ye Qingtang looked expressionlessly at this seemingly gentle but actually oppressive fox-faced man.

“I’m sorry, I don’t understand what you’re saying. There’s nothing extra in my memories. You must be mistaken.” She could sense the situation turning strange.

She had already proven that she wasn’t a clone but...

Why did she get the feeling that... these people from the Temple of Paragon were treating her as the reincarnation of their Holy Lord?

She had no choice but to pose as the Holy Lord of Shadows previously, but was she supposed to pose as the Holy Lord of the Temple of Paragon now?!

The heavens didn’t give her enough guts to do that.

No matter how powerful the Temple of Shadows was, it was just a mere ant to the Temple of Paragon. Further to that, she didn’t understand much about the Second Domain, let alone the elusive Temple of Paragon.

She didn’t want to take this risk.

“Do you really not remember anything?” The fox-faced man looked at her with uncertainty. Almost as though he was trying to pick up some hints from her gaze.

She nodded resolutely.

He suddenly smiled and said, “Alright, since this was all a misunderstanding, I won’t keep you any longer. You can leave.”

Ye Qingtang breathed a sigh of relief but couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something strange in the way he had said it.

Elder Hua who was standing at the side seemed to have something to say but the fox-faced man gestured for her to hold her tongue.

After looking at them a few more times, she turned to leave through the main hall.

She didn’t want to be involved with the Temple of Paragon.

She walked towards the light and her slender figure passed right through it and straight out of the temple.

All this was witnessed by the other Elders and the fox-faced man.

“She really crossed it.” A smile appeared in Elder Hua’s eyes. She placed his hand on his chest and said, “The Guardian is smart after all.”

The fox-faced man smiled.

“Elder Hua, aren’t you going to get the Holy Lord back?”

Elder Hua nodded slightly as she vanished from the main hall. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang had just walked out of the main hall when she saw the winged man who she had met outside previously. The winged man seemed shocked to see her walk out alone.

“How... did you come out?” he asked in surprise.

She replied, “I walked out.”

What kind of question was that?

The winged man had a complicated expression on his face. This woman was clearly not from the Temple of Paragon, so how did she just walk out like this?

The winged man seemed to want to ask her something but Elder Hua walked out of the main hall at that moment.

The winged man dropped down to one knee.

“Greetings, Elder Hua.”

Seeing that Elder Hua had come out behind her, Ye Qingtang quickly turned to leave.

But...

“Please wait.” Elder Hua flew in front of her as she smiled at her.

“It was our mistake for dragging you here so suddenly, so it’s our responsibility to send you back to the First Domain. But we are busy these few days, so we invite you to stay here for a few days. I will send someone to bring you back after that.”

“There’s no need for that.” Ye Qingtang rejected her without hesitation as she shook her head. She had already experienced their embarrassment for the mistake.

Who knew what was going to happen if she stayed any longer.

The difference in their powers was too great. It would be better if she stopped having any further interaction with them.
