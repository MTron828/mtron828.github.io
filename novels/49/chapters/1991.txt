Chapter 1992: Theft (2)

It was You Qiong who had spoken up before, and his eyes flashed with greed as he heard Elder Mo’s words. “I will make sure to do my best and not let Elder Mo down.”

With a nod of satisfaction, Elder Mo gestured for him to rejoin the other two wardens to carry out the task.

You Qiong began discussing with the two wardens after leaving the main hall but the two wardens were extremely arrogant and didn’t take You Qiong’s words to heart at all, merely telling him to not worry, and that they would take care of everything.

Rejected and treated as an outsider, You Qiong could feel their prejudice against him. He retreated humbly with a glint in his eyes.

As per Ye Qingtang’s plans, he had returned to the Ancient You Clan, but his status was no longer as great as before.

The Ancient You Clan’s power was improving by leaps and bounds but his power had been reduced greatly due to the age reversal curse. He had made his way back after great difficulty only to be reinstated in a position not of a high-ranking elder but as someone even lower than the wardens.

The people who had once respected him were all now climbing over his head, which made him grit his teeth in despair.

Wasn’t he the one who had recommended Elder Mo to enter the Ancient You Clan?

But now...

Elder Mo was treating him like a pitiful dog to be kept by his side.

Looking at the two wardens discussing the attack on the Temple of Shadows, a cold smile flashed across You Qiong’s face. After making sure he was alone, he secretly crushed a spirit stone in his sleeve.

Back in the Temple of Shadows, Ye Qingtang smiled as she saw the spirit stones on her table shatter.

“All arrangements are in order in the Ancient You Clan?” Ling Yan asked as he looked at her.

She nodded.

“The pieces are all in place and all we have to do now is rely on the performance of Xue Fu and the rest. Is your Netherworld Ring completed?”

Without saying anything, Ling Yan placed a pure-black ring in her hands.

The moment the ring touched her, a wave of coldness washed over her palm and she stared at the ring in shock.

“What do you think?”

Ye Qingtang took a few more glances at the fake Netherworld Ring. She had asked Ling Yan repeatedly whether he was sure of the design when he had drawn it out.

He had affirmed it over and over again.

The ring that she was looking at was identical to the one on the paper. Even the feeling of it on her skin was as Ling Yan had told her. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“It looks exactly like the real one.”

Ling Yan smiled and said, “It merely looks like the real one. But since the Ancient You Clan don’t know much about it, they probably won’t be able to tell that it’s a fake. However, if it lands into the hands of the Crimson League, they will be able to tell that it’s not the real one.”

Ye Qingtang looked at him, a nagging feeling at the back of her mind that his words were not as simple as they seemed.

But she had no time to worry about all of this now.

Now that she had the fake Netherworld Ring, she quickly went to gather the group she was sending to the Frost Abyss.

Ye Qingtang wasn’t planning on going herself or sending Ming Di even though she wanted to “prevent” the Ancient You Clan from stealing the ring.

After all, this was below their station.

When all preparations were done, she placed the Netherworld Ring in a beautiful box and handed it over to Xue Fu who was leading a group of the Undead Clan to the Frost Abyss.

It was the last day the person in the black robes had given them.
