“It… it’s eating the corpses?” The Blood Moon Elder felt disgusted as the ferocious beasts were extremely ugly. The white tiger was still able to eat the disgusting corpses…

Ye Qingtang realized what was going on. Her eyes squinted as she stared at the white tiger who was eating the corpses continuously. She could clearly sense that the white tiger was regaining some sort of aura.

The aura was similar to the one it had when she first met it.

That aura belonged to the Fiendcelestial Beast, but it was much weaker than when they first met. However… as the white tiger swallowed more corpses, the aura was getting more intense.

“I understand,” Ye Qingtang suddenly said. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“What did you understand?” The Blood Moon Elder stunned.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything. She flicked her wrist and chopped off one giant ant’s head. She stamped the ground and kicked the giant ant’s headless corpse towards the white tiger.

The white tiger just finished “eating” the corpses around it and saw a black shadow falling from the sky. Its body suddenly tensed. Along with a “boom,” a headless giant ant’s corpses landed in front of its claws.

“F*ck you!” The white tiger roared towards the Ye Qingtang who “ambushed” it.

“Don’t bullsh*t! Eat now!” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

She finally understood that the Fiendcelestial Beast could acquire energy from swallowing the corpses of these ferocious beasts. This was how the white tiger had obtained its giant body in the first place.

The Fiendcelestial Beast must encounter many ferocious beasts in the Hell of Avicinaraka and absorb the demonic aura from the corpses to strengthen itself. That was how it transformed from its infant body and obtained the giant body.

The demonic aura on the Fiendcelestial Beast was all absorbed by the Heart of the Demon God in her body. That was the reason why it returned to its original form. However, if this method worked, it would allow the white tiger to swallow more corpses of the ferocious beasts. When the energy swallowed accumulated to a certain level, it might be able to be stronger again.

Though it was a makeshift solution, Ye Qingtang had to grasp the chance.

Under the attack of so many ferocious beasts, it would be extremely difficult to escape.

If the white tiger could turn into the Fiendcelestial Beast again, the chances of escaping would be much higher.

The white tiger’s whiskers shivered as Ye Qingtang shouted at it. “F*ck you! How dare you command me!”

However, when it finished saying its words, the white tiger opened its mouth without any hesitation and absorbed the new corpse of the giant ant.

The Blood Moon Elder saw the scene happening in front of him and understood Ye Qingtang’s intentions. He did not have any chance to talk anymore. He used Ye Qingtang’s method and kicked all the corpses of the ferocious beasts he killed towards the white tiger so that it could acquire more energy in a short period of time.

The two people and one beast were now cooperating with each other on the cliff.

The people who regained their fighting spirit earlier by Ye Qingtang were still eventually torn into pieces by the giant mice as they were not strong enough to last for long.

Without their hindrance, the giant mice rushed towards the cliff!
