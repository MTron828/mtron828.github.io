1454 Arrogance 2

“Mo Yi, don’t go too far!” Jiang Qin panted in Tuoba Yao’s arms. She looked viciously at Mo Yi.

“So what if I’m bullying you?” Mo Yi raised her brows slightly, completely unafraid.

Tuoba Yao’s eyes glittered, and a murderous aura rippled around him.

The two demon fox servants instantly returned to Jiang Qin’s side and flanked her with a serious air.

It looked as if the fight was about to start again, and Jiang Liu hurriedly advanced and said, “Second Sister-in-law, we are all family. Why disrupt the harmony in our family!”

“All family?” Mo Yi laughed softly. Her eyes were as cold as ice.

“We are all family, but you permitted someone to snatch my daughter’s spirit root? We are all family, but you allow the younger generation of the Jiang Family to bully my daughter at will? What rubbish. I, Mo Yi, am not in the same clan as you.”

“If you don’t hand Ye You over to me today, I don’t mind killing the entire Jiang Family.”

Mo Yi’s aura surged, and her robes flew.

Jiang Qin and the others had extremely ugly expressions.

Mo Yi had always been like that. She did not respect anyone. Her hands were even stained with Jiang Family blood.

“Second Sister-in-law, You’er is also a child of our Jiang Family. It is all water under the bridge. Just forget it. You’re rarely home. Why make things so difficult?” Jiang Liu continued to cajole.

Mo Yi laughed coldly and looked at Jiang Liu scornfully.

At that moment, Jiang Liu realized that his words were inappropriate. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye You was a child of the Jiang Family, so they wanted to protect her. However, Ye Qingtang was also a child of the Jiang Family, but the younger generation of the Jiang Family had bullied her repeatedly…

“We were biased in this incident. Second Sister-in-law, please calm down. Father is currently in seclusion. Why not wait for Father to end his seclusion before making a decision?” Jiang Liu used a conciliatory tone.

“Hmph.” Mo Yi’s gaze passed over everyone present. She seemed scornful of Jiang Liu’s words.

“Second Sister-in-law, even if you don’t consider yourself, please consider Second Brother and Tang Tang. The Jiang Family blood flows in their veins,” Jiang Liu said.

Mo Yi was definitely at a disadvantage in the current situation.

If it were just Jiang Qin alone, Mo Yi would not be concerned. But now, Tuoba Yao, Elder Meng, and Jiang Liu were all on Ye You’s side. If Mo Yi forced the matter, they might seize the opportunity to harm Ye Qingtang.

After some consideration, Mo Yi said frostily, “When is the Domain Monarch ending his seclusion?”

When Jiang Liu heard that there was room of discussion, he immediately said, “Father will end his seclusion in three days at the latest.”

“Then we’ll give her a few more days. In three days, when the Domain Monarch ends his seclusion, I will insist she returns my daughter her spirit root, regardless of his judgment,” Mo Yi said frostily.

“Dream on! Mo Yi, you just try to touch a hair on You’er’s head!” Jiang Qin glared at Mo Yi viciously.

Mo Yi swept a glance at Jiang Qin. Her lips curved in an icy smile.

“In three days’ time, not only will I touch her, but I will disembowel her and take her spirit root.”

“How dare you!”

“Why wouldn’t I dare?” Mo Yi said coldly.

If Tuoba Yao had not held her back. Jiang Qin would probably start fighting with Mo Yi again.

Ye You was standing nearby, watching Mo Yi, who was like a killing god. When she heard that Mo Yi wanted to disembowel her, she felt a chill throughout her body. She could not help but recall how she and a Ye Family elder had disemboweled Ye Qingtang together and dug out her spirit root…

No!

She definitely did not want to end up like that!

Mo Yi could not be bothered to quibble with them. She flew off with Ye Qingtang and the others.
