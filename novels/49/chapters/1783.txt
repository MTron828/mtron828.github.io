Chapter 1784: Deity Ocean (1)

The demons all looked in awe at the Deity Ocean suspended in midair. The Deity Ocean seemed to have an extremely mesmerizing effect on them. As they stood frozen, their eyes were all locked on the Deity Ocean.

“That’s the Deity Ocean... It’s my first time seeing it...” The demons were all awestruck.

The Great Generals of the three elite tribes seemed to be unnaturally calm as well. They raised their eyebrows as they looked at the Deity Ocean hanging in the sky and didn’t take a single step forward.

The Deity Ocean was hanging right over their heads this moment but at the same time, they understood that they were not going to be able to obtain it.

The last time the sealed space opened, there had been mass slaughter as well as they tried to obtain the Deity Ocean. Even though it was right over their head, no matter how hard they flew towards it, they couldn’t even touch it.

At the peak of the mountain was the Deity Altar and it was recorded there that the only way they could get to the Deity Ocean was if it descended on the Deity Altar. Otherwise, they could only look up at it and wouldn’t be able to touch it at all.

This was also the reason the Deity Ocean hadn’t been obtained for hundreds of thousands of years.

This time, the three elite tribes were all still holding out hope that the Deity Ocean would descend, but it hadn’t shown any signs of doing so up till now.

Could it be that...

They were going to return empty-handed again?

Ye Qingtang hid herself among the demons as she looked up at the Deity Ocean in the sky, her eyes filled with blue light.

But just as Ye Qingtang was about to look away, the Deity Ocean flashed brightly. Ye Qingtang felt something shudder in her and she suddenly paled.

At the same time, the Deity Ocean which had been in the sky for hundreds of thousands of years suddenly changed!

Right in front of all the demons’ eyes, the light from the Deity Ocean dimmed and moved slowly towards the Deity Altar!

“The Deity Ocean is descending?” The Great General of the Earth Demon Tribe widened his eyes in disbelief as he looked at the descending Deity Ocean.

This was the first time in hundreds of thousands of years that the Deity Ocean was descending!

As long as the Deity Ocean landed on the Deity Altar, they would be able to obtain it! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Great joy washed over all the demons. After hundreds of thousands of years, they were finally witnessing a miracle!

Ye Qingtang had no idea what was happening but suddenly felt a wave of coldness invade her, piercing straight into her bone.

Like this, the sight of the Deity Ocean descending had been pierced into the eyes of all the demons.

Under the blue light of the Deity Ocean, one of the Great Generals flew straight at it, wanting to go straight to the Deity Ocean.

But the moment he reached the mountain peak, the eyes of the Great General from the Earth Demon Tribe sharpened and a ray of cold light shot out from his palm, decimating the other Great General in midair.

“I’m not going to show any mercy to anyone who dares to go near the Deity Ocean!”

How dare they go near the Deity Ocean with their lowly status.

It was already an honor for them to witness the Deity Ocean being formed.

Even though the stench of death permeated the air, the blob of decimated flesh in the air did nothing to deter the demons’ greed.

The Deity Ocean was right in front of them. That great power was just within reach! As long as they had the Deity Ocean, they would rule over everything.

There was a sudden uproar among all the demons. They no longer feared the threats of the three elite tribes, and their eyes were transfixed, filled only with the sight of the Deity Ocean.
