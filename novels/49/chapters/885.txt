Chapter 886 How Dare You Trick Me (4)

At this very moment, Ye You was bearing an extreme pain and did not have the energy to bother with Ye Qingtang’s arrival.

“You… You… tampered… with the… dragon bone… and phoenix feather…!” Ye You glared at Ling Yan with gritted teeth.

However, Ling Yan shook his head with a smile. “Given your cultivation realm, with one look, you would be able to tell if I really had tampered with the Bone of the True Dragon and the Feather of the Divine Phoenix.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye You did not retort to whatever Ling Yan said as it was indeed so. If the two treasures were really tampered with, it was impossible for her to not be able to see it given her skills.

But if they were not tampered with, what was it then?!

“Miss, you’re unaware that in the war between the True Dragon, Divine Phoenix, and the Heavenly Demon back then, all three parties harbored a grudge… The True Dragon and Divine Phoenix were originally in love but were hunted down for their lives by the Heavenly Demon. Since you obtained the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon, there is the aura of the Heavenly Demon on your body. The Bone of the True Dragon and the Feather of the Divine Phoenix are mortal enemies with it. How would they spare you?” Ling Yan

smiled.

After hearing Ling Yan’s explanation, Ye You lifted an arm with difficulty and pointed at Ling Yan. “You… You schemed… schemed against me!”

“Schemed against you?” Ling Yan had a baffled expression. “What do you mean by that, Miss? It’s you who wanted to snatch my Bone of the True Dragon and then snatch my Feather of the Divine Phoenix. I did not ask you to snatch them.” Ling Yan spoke slowly.

Ye Qingtang looked gazed at Ling Yan. Although she did know what happened, Ling Yan definitely schemed against Ye You…

“These two items are divine items. Your body is now covered with the frost of the True Dragon and the flame of the Divine Phoenix. If you’re unwilling to give up the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon, you will definitely die today…” Ling Yan added on smilingly. “Do you wish to live… or die?”

Ye You clenched her fists tightly. This person actually returned what she said to herself!

Currently, Ye You was aware of how frightening the frost of the True Dragon and the flame of the Divine Phoenix were. If she did not give up the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon as he said, she would lose her life today!

To protect her life, Ye You did not have any other option and could only spit out a pitch-black pearl.

A demon aura lingered around that black pearl, and that was the essence which condensed after the Heavenly Demon died!

In order to locate the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon, she exhausted countless Dharma treasures which her grandfather gave her, and she almost lost her life to obtain the inheritance. Yet, she became a cat’s paw for someone else now!

“You still need to leave the Bone of the True Dragon and the Feather of the Divine Phoenix behind in order for the misery to dissipate.” Ling Yan reminded with a smile.

Almost without hesitation, Ye You threw the two treasures on the ground according to Ling Yan.

At this instant, Ling Yan raised his hand and took away the Heavenly Demon Pearl, Bone of the True Dragon, and Feather of the Divine Phoenix.

A few breaths later, the frost and flame on Ye You’s body finally faded gradually.

Ye You panted heavily. Her expression was extremely dark.

“Ye Qingtang… It’s you… Who schemed against me with him…” Ye You said coldly after seeing Ye Qingtang, who was beside Ling Yan.

“I am not involved in scheming against you. However, it’s time we settled our enmity today.” As Ye Qingtang spoke, she unsheathed her sword sharply.

Ye You was heavily injured presently, and Ye Qingtang would not pass this chance.

However, before Ye Qingtang could strike, Ling Yan grabbed her hand and pulled her back.

Taking this chance, Ye You used whatever last energy she had and disappeared without a trace.
