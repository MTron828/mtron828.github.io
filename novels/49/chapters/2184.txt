Chapter 2185: Medicine Faculty (5)

“I am not a teacher at the medicine faculty,” Ye Qingtang admitted.

Teacher Feng showed no surprise. He glanced at Yun Chen again.

“I heard that Yun Chen has been assigned to a new teacher. I wonder if you are the one?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Teacher Feng nodded. The other medicine faculty students watched the scene with glittery eyes, all expecting to watch a good show.

Ye Qing was not a teacher from the medicine faculty and had no use for an alchemy lab. Anyone could guess that she was asking for an alchemy lab for Yun Chen.

“Teacher Ye, you just joined the Netherworld Academy and probably don’t understand much of our medicine faculty procedures. Every student here has their own alchemy lab. Even though you are Yun Chen’s teacher, you are not part of the medicine faculty. Also...” Teacher Feng glanced at Yun Chen.

“With Yun Chen’s abilities, it is already considered generous of us to let him have the use of a low-grade alchemy lab.”

There was not even a need to consider anything else. He didn’t have the right to apply for them.

Teacher Feng’s words were still considered rather polite. But his disregard for Yun Chen was evident in his voice. Around him, the medicine faculty students secretly smiled.

“What the hell. Has this Yun Chen gone stupid? He thought that he could apply for a better alchemy lab just because he got a new teacher?”

“Never mind. Even if we give him a Grand Master-level alchemy lab, what can he produce? Even my 10-year-old younger brother can produce better elixirs than him. It is just a waste of our faculty resources to let him stay here.”

“I heard that Yun Chen will be kicked out of the academy soon? Why all this fuss now?”

“He should know his place.”

The teenagers whispered to each other. They stared at Yun Chen with maliciousness.

Yun Chen was a smear on the name of the medicine faculty.

The Netherworld Academy medicine faculty had once produced a Grand Master alchemist. But with Yun Chen’s abilities, even a medicine cultivation student from a normal academy was better than him. His presence here was just a smear upon their reputation.

Yun Chen maintained his smile as if he didn’t hear their mocking words. But Ye Qingtang saw and heard everything.

A frown was on her face.

“Teacher Feng, I think you misunderstand.”

Teacher Feng: “Oh?”

Ye Qingtang continued. “I am the one who wants to use the alchemy lab, not Yun Chen.”

Teacher Feng and the rest were all stunned by Ye Qing’s words.

“Why do you need an alchemy lab?” Teacher Feng asked. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“To refine medicine of course,” Ye Qing replied.

Teacher Feng: “...”

At this, even Lei Yan and his gang were shocked.

What did they hear?

Boss wanted to refine medicine?

What kind of joke was this!

Yun Chen looked at Ye Qing with astonishment. He really couldn’t imagine this teacher refining medicines.

Teacher Feng was stunned for quite a long while before he finally snapped out of it. “Teacher Ye, are you joking? You want to refine medicine?”

“Yes, is there a problem with that?” Ye Qing asked.

The corners of Teacher Feng’s lips twitched slightly.

Problem?

A big problem!

Where did this fellow come from, requesting for an alchemy lab from the medicine faculty? Did this teacher think that making medicines was like rolling balls of dirt?

What a farce.
