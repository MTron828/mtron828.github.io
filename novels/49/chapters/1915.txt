Chapter 1916: The Spirit of Chaos (1)

“What a joke. Would the Holy Lord of Shadows need to even lift a finger to defeat this small fry?” An elder of the Temple of Shadows retorted.

That arrogant youth had been scared away without the Holy Lord even doing a thing! Not only did the clan elders not get angry, but a smug satisfaction also appeared on their faces.

They were here today because they had been pushed into a corner but the youth. A few days ago, they had been informed that the youth had found the Temple of Shadows and they had turned their attention to it.

Even though the Holy Lord of Shadows had vanished for over ten thousand years, she had been extremely powerful. They wanted to see if the Holy Lord of Shadows could defeat the youth.

The results had pleased them immensely.

They had heard that the youth had humiliated himself in front of the Holy Lord of Shadows. He had used all his strength to attack the Holy Lord only for her to brush his attack to the side, then had sent him running away in fear.

The clan elders had seen a glimmer of hope and set their egos aside to come here to the Temple of Shadows.

“The youth is definitely no match for the Holy Lord of Shadows. Back in the past, in order to protect the Central Mainland, the Holy Lord refused to let the Second Domain oppress us and went to battle with your armor. You were so strong back then,” a member of the Baili Family Clan said with a smile. They were filled with praises for the Holy Lord of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang grimaced in her head. She already knew what these people wanted.

They were just a bunch of sly old foxes.

Since they knew that they were no match for the youth, they had all come running to the Temple of Shadows to ask for help. In the past, they didn’t want to have anything to do with the Temple of Shadows at all but were all singing praises right now.

What a bunch of hypocrites.

“Please speak your mind if you have something you want to say.” Ye Qingtang knew their intentions well but wanted to get more information from them.

“It’s refreshing to see the Holy Lord speak so frankly. This insolent youth has been causing havoc in the Central Mainland, causing much trouble to the people. Now he’s even undermining the authority of the Temple of Shadows. We beg the Holy Lord of Shadows to take action and purge this evil,” a clan elder said as he shook his hands.

Even if they refused to accept being below the Temple of Shadows, they had no other choice but to get the Holy Lord of Shadows to deal with the youth.

They could say anything if it would ensure their survival.

Ye Qingtang was by no means the real Holy Lord of Shadows but she was no fool and wasn’t about to let their words get into her head.

“You’re too lavish with your praise. This youth appears to be alone. With the strength of so many clans, there is no way he’ll be able to run amok for long.”

The expressions of the clan elders all became awkward.

“To tell you the truth, we did think of dealing with him ourselves. We gathered the strongest people from each clan but... none of them was a match for him. They were all killed...”

The other clans had tried all sorts of ways to deal with him but were crushed like ants underneath a giant’s foot. They were only here because they had been driven into a corner. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ye Qingtang looked at the faces of the clan leader and knew that they must have already exhausted all of their options. How else would they possibly have set aside their pride to come to ask for help?

If the real Holy Lord of Shadows was here, destroying the youth would be possible in a matter of seconds, but... she wasn’t the real deal and was no match for him.

What could she do?

Although Ye Qingtang was anxious inside, she maintained her strong facade, not letting anyone see her unease.
