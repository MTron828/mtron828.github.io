Chapter 2028: Battle (2)

A cold gaze was fixated on the powerful youths as Ye Qingtang studied them carefully. Underneath her mask, she was panicking a little.

“Oh? And I would like to see whether the youths of the Ancient You Clan are strong enough to go up against the powers of the Second Domain.”

Elder Cong froze, not understanding what she had just said.

In the next moment, the howls of beasts started coming from the Temple of Shadows army. Hundreds of flying mounts took to the skies behind her and flew onwards.

A red flag was flying in the wind with them.

Elder Cong’s face crumbled.

“The Crimson League?” His eyes widened and he couldn’t believe that the flying army behind her was from the Crimson League.

Before he could even come to his senses, many alien races appeared from within the troops of the Temple of Shadows.

What was going on?

He was completely and utterly shocked. Never would he have even dreamt that the alien races of the Crimson League would appear with the Temple of Shadows!

Mi stood above the mutant Wind Snake.

“Elder Cong, is that... the Crimson League’s army?” An Ancient You Clan soldier’s eyes widened in disbelief as his mouth dropped open. Beside him, Elder Cong’s arrogance had completely vanished. His brows furrowed together and he couldn’t understand what was going on.

Hadn’t Elder Mo gone to settle things with the Crimson League already?

Why was the Crimson League joining the battle?

He had not paid any heed to the Temple of Shadows army at all but it was a different story if the Crimson League was involved.

“May I know why the esteemed members of the Crimson League are here? Has there been some misunderstanding?” Elder Cong forced himself to keep calm as he asked as his eyes turned towards the mutant Wind Snake.

Even if the entire Central Mainland were to gather their forces against them, they could still wipe them out easily. But the Crimson League was from the Second Domain!

“Misunderstanding?” Mi spoke slowly and softly.

“The Ancient You Clan has insulted the Crimson League again and again. How can you say that it’s just a misunderstanding?” Bai Zhi said coldly.

Cold sweat peppered Elder Cong’s forehead. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“We have always respected the Crimson League. If this is about the Netherworld Ring, we will make sure to settle the matter properly with the Crimson League.”

“Hm? And how are you going to do that?” Bai Zhi asked.

“Today’s battle is between the Temple of Shadows and the Ancient You Clan. If we owe anything to the Crimson League, we will make sure to compensate the Crimson League accordingly...” Elder Cong wanted nothing more than to have the Crimson League gone.

Bai Zhi remained silent as she looked at Mi on the mutant Wind Snake.

“Compensate?” Mi asked.

“That’s right. As long as the Crimson League does not treat us as hostiles, we are willing to fulfill any requests you have.” Elder Cong spoke amicably. This was not the time for them to be fighting the Second Domain.

“If that’s the case, I want you to hand over all the Spirit of Chaos fragments you own. Only then will we consider sparing your lives,” Mi demanded.
