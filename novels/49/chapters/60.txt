Chapter 61: The Lull Before the Storm (1)

“And I wondered why the brat was unduly intimate with Ye Xun, so that’s the reason. To think your father and I once hoped you’d be in his hands, and he turns out to be a heartless bastard!” The Second Elder went rampant in his verbal lashings but as he turned his attention towards Ye Qingtang, he simmered down in an instant.

“No worries Tang Tang, there’s nothing to fear. Even if you’ve lost your spirit root, I’ll wring the neck of those who dare bully you.”

Ye Qingtang felt gratified by this heartwarming reunion. With Ye Ling and the Second Elder by her side, there was indeed nothing to fear.

“Sir, that Great Elder’s definitely up to no good. Now that his granddaughter has even made it to the Cloud-breakers, he’s sure to pull a stunt like that again. We’ll need to be on our guard. I’ll keep an eye on him once we’ve returned. I’d like to see what else he’s capable of.” The Second Elder spoke in a vehement tone. After the earlier incident, he could clearly tell that the Great Elder was intent on getting rid of him.

“Of course. With you around, I can rest assured. But your injuries….” Ye Ling asked concernedly.

“No worries. All those Elders can never stand up to me in a one-on-one. Their blows felt like a scratch.” The Second Elder reassured.

Ye Ling nodded with a look of relief and turned towards his daughter next. All that had transpired today went beyond his expectations. Though he was well aware of the Great Elder’s treachery, he did not expect him to act so brazenly immediately after failing in that assassination attempt.

If Ye Qingtang had not arrived in time, they would not have been able to overcome that ordeal.

“Tang Tang, you’ve grown up indeed.” Ye Ling regarded his precious daughter, feeling elated over her maturity, yet melancholic at her becoming independent of him.

Ye Qingtang had a genuine smile on her face as she watched their happy faces, and she made a vow in her heart, for their sake and her own, she would do anything to gain the power to protect all the people she loved.

With the Second Elder’s return, there was a reckoning within the hierarchy of the Ye Household.

During the Second Elder’s absence, the Great Elder was able to seize the authority over the household. But now that the Second Elder was back with a vengeance, possessing a prowess that the Great Elder could never hope to contend with, the entire household recognized the importance of acting prudently to prevent stepping on his toes.

As a result, Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang was overjoyed with their newfound peace, but on the other hand, the Great Elder was getting more sullen with each passing day.

And in two more days, the Great Elder would be celebrating his birthday. Though they had had that skirmish at the training grounds the other day, that incident was totally concealed from the public.

The Great Elder’s birthday was an event worthy of celebration. Thus, to respect the household’s traditions and values, both parties unanimously agreed to come to a temporary truce. Besides, they did not wish to tarnish the household name by disclosing their enmity to the public as well. To indict the Great Elder would require proper evidence, Ye Ling and the Second Elder could only wait for the opportunity to nab him red handed.

“Grandpa, the preparations are almost complete…” Ye Xun was currently stationed in the Great Elder’s quarters, as she addressed the Great Elder respectfully.

Although the Great Elder had his plans thwarted by Ye Qingtang, his position as Great Elder of the Ye Household remained unchallenged. However, with that recent skirmish, when it came to arrangements for his birthday feast, he would very much prefer Ye Xun to oversee its preparations.
