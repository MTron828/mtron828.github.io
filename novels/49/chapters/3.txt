Ye Qingtang opened her eyes dazedly. She felt the care and warmth from Ye Ling’s worried gaze.

Yes, she thought.

Why did she need to bother with those bastards? She should only protect those people who cared for her in this life.

“Father, I’ll dress up soon. You can go over first.” Ye Qingtang smiled slightly.

…

A tall and handsome man was sitting on the chair in the hall of the Ye family. Beside him was a beautiful and graceful girl.

“Duan Lang, about the matters we’re going to discuss today…” The girl frowned slightly. She puckered her lips expressing her concern.

After seeing such a lovely expression on the girl’s face, Duan Tianrao who was sitting there could not help but raise his hand to cover her white hands.

“Xun Er, you don’t need to worry. I’ll be here for you.” Duan Tianrao’s voice was very gentle when comforting the girl.

Ye Xun was an orphan adopted by Ye Ling at a very young age. She had been raised by the Ye family ever since she was a baby. 16 years had passed, and though she was an adopted daughter, she still received the same education as the rest of the Ye family’s daughters growing up. Her appearance was not inferior to those of the other daughters of the Ye family.

Ye Xun’s beauty was the reason why she was able to capture Duan Tianrao’s attention.

Ye Xun lowered her eyes filled with sadness and anxiety.

“I owe the Ye family a debt of gratitude for raising me up. I’m scared that this matter might…”

Duan Tianrao was heartbroken seeing how anxious Ye Xun was.

He held her hand tightly and said, “Xun Er, you’re the adopted daughter of the Ye family, and it’s true that you owe them the debt of gratitude. However, our matter has nothing to do with that gratitude. Just rest assured. I’ll be there for you no matter what happens.”

Ye Xun nodded her head. A faint smile could be captured in her eyes as she noticed how much Duan Tianrao cared for her.

At that moment, Ye Ling walked into the hall. Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao immediately let go of each other’s hands. Duan Tianrao stood up and greeted Ye Ling.

“Uncle Ye.”

“Father.” Ye Xun also stood up.

Ye Ling just nodded slightly and looked towards Duan Tianrao in front of him.

Ye Qingtang was the only daughter of Ye Ling. She had a weak body since she was born. She was even ashamed of herself due to her birthmark. Thus, it had always been Ye Ling’s greatest aspiration to find a husband who would take care of his daughter.

Lin Town had, in total, three large family clans. Apart from the Ye family, the Duan family and the Si family were the other two large family clans. The marriage alliance with the Duan family was based on equal social status, and Ye Ling would be relieved to hand over Ye Qingtang to Duan Tianrao as Tianrao cared for Qingtang all the time.

“Tianrao, Tang Tang is still dressing up. She’ll come over soon. Just wait for a while.” Ye Ling smiled. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

A trace of uneasiness appeared in Duan Tianrao’s eyes, but he did not show anything on his face. He exchanged glances with Ye Xun beside him secretly.

“No need to rush,” he said and smiled.

He then nodded towards the servant beside him. The servant immediately placed a few well-decorated boxes onto a table beside Ye Ling.

“I heard that Tang Tang’s spirit root was broken, devitalizing her. Thus, I prepared some tonics including the Hunyuan Pills which will help Tang Tang to regain her vigor. The pills are very effective in terms of healing power.” Duan Tianrao spoke gently.

“The Hunyuan Pills are difficult to find. I was about to look for them, but you have already brought them over. I’m very relieved to see that you truly love her.” Ye Ling felt pleased.

“This is to be expected from a fiancé,” Duan Tianrao said humbly.
