Wu Zheng was stunned. He raised his eyes to look at Ye Qingtang, and a trace of shock appeared in the pair of clear eyes.

“Lady Ye, are you suspecting that…”

Ye Qingtang smiled but did not reply to Wu Zheng. Instead, she murmured to herself. “There is a cliff behind the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, and there should have Duanyuan Grass. Only close people would have the chance to put the Duanyuan Grass in tea after the celebration.”

Wu Zheng’s eyes sparkled. He did not say anything and lowered his eyes.

Ye Qingtang took a glimpse at Wu Zheng and smiled.

“Since it’s not done by strangers, it must be people who are close. Young Sir, did Wu Chengze mistreat anyone supporting the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village before?”

Wu Zheng frowned and shook his head.

“Father is always a kind Village Master. Hundreds of families nearby benefited from father. They were not requested to submit any offerings, as father treated them as family. If Lady Ye has any questions, you can ask around.”

Ye Qingtang nodded. Actually, Spirit Condensation Mountain Village always had a good reputation. There were no rumors about Wu Chengze mistreating the people here.

Lin Long walked down slowly when they were chatting. She exchanged a glance with Ye Qingtang and sat at the side. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

While they were waiting for the rest, they heard a range of footsteps from the second level. One of the disciples rushed to the staircase. “Senior Sister Lin! Something’s wrong! Junior Brother Liu… You should go and take a look now!”

The disciple was panicking, and the three people were stunned slightly after hearing his words.

Lin Long stood up immediately and dashed to the second floor. Ye Qingtang and Wu Zheng also followed up.

They soon arrived at the room of Junior Brother Liu.

Junior Brother Liu, who came back with the rest, was extremely pale. He fell by the side of the bed, and his whole body was shivering. His clothes were only half-removed when he collapsed onto the ground and lost his consciousness.

“What happened?” Zhou Xuan also came over. He glanced at Junior Brother Liu who fell onto the ground, and his face suddenly changed.

“I don’t know as well… Just now I wanted to ask him to go downstairs, but I knocked his door for a while, and no one came. Thus, I pushed open the door. I did not expect that… He was lying on the ground when I came in…” The disciple who went to call up the rest replied in fear.

Zhou Xuan put up an unpleasant face. Junior Brother Liu was normal just now. What happened to him within such a short period of time?

“Help him up first.” Zhou Xuan commanded.

The disciple immediately helped Junior Brother Liu up to his bed, and Wu Zheng went to invite the Apothecary over at the same time.

“What happened?” The Apothecary rushed over, and he appeared to be very nervous.

“Please help to take a look at my Junior Brother.” Zhou Xuan requested once he saw the Apothecary.

“Sure, sure…” The Apothecary nodded immediately and went forward to do a checkup for Junior Brother Liu.
