1332 First Move 1

At that moment, Ming Wang’s eyes, which were totally devoid of human emotion, were staring straight at Ye Qingtang as if searching her eyes for some crack in her facade.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curved upwards slightly, and the small smile on her face turned cold. “Ming Wang, do you know… how Zhui Gong died?”

When Ye Qingtang mentioned Zhui Gong, Ming Wang’s eyes flickered, and his brow furrowed slightly.

Zhui Gong had been the most powerful tribe leader in the Temple of Shadows. His martial skills were incomparable, but at one point, he became disrespectful of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

However, the Holy Lord of Shadows had cut off his head just for showing a trace of disrespect. His body had been exposed to the burning sun until it vanished.

“Ming Wang, after my return, I became increasingly aware that you are somewhat like Zhui Gong… What do you think?” Ye Qingtang wore an inscrutable smile.

“Oh?” Death aura swirled around Ming Wang, and his eyes flashed. “Holy Lord, please tell me how I am like Zhui Gong.”

Ye Qingtang sat further away and remained motionless, though her fingers drummed a rhythm on the tabletop. Her lips arched in an inscrutable smile. “So you are about to become like a second Zhui Gong.”

As she spoke, a cold light flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Although she continued to smile charmingly, her smile was now bone-chilling.

Ming Wang frowned slightly as Ye Qingtang slowly stood up, and the death aura around him vanished suddenly. He cupped his fists and said, “Holy Lord, I dare not take on this charge. Zhui Gong was a criminal who offended the Lord. How can the Holy Lord compare me to Zhui Gong?”

When she heard that, Ye Qingtang laughed softly and rose to walk over to Ming Wang. She bent over slightly and lightly trailed a finger across Ming Wang’s face. “What is the penalty for offending the Lord?”

“Someone who offends the Lord will certainly be put to death,” said Ming Wang. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ming Wang, you are really rather adorable. I like you more and more.” When Ye Qingtang finished speaking, she brushed her fingers lightly over Ming Wang’s forehead. “Tell me, why did you pretend to be Ming Gu.”

“The Holy Lord is joking. The Holy Lord was the one who assumed I was my brother. I was merely playing along with the Holy Lord… I did not mean cause offense,” said Ming Wang.

“You came to look for me. What did you want to discuss with me?” Ye Qingtang withdrew her right hand and looked at Ming Wang coldly as she spoke.

“I came to look for the Holy Lord to discuss the Eternal Dynasty’s prince,” replied Ming Wang.

“Speak.” Ye Qingtang flicked her sleeves.

“Holy Lord, the current Crown Prince, Ling Yan is almost demonically clever. He is very difficult to deal with… Is the Holy Lord certain that she wants to offend the Crown Prince, Ling Yan, in order to support the Eldest Prince? If Ling Yan can be brought down, that is well and good. However, if he cannot…” As he spoke, Ming Wang was secretly studying Ye Qingtang’s attitude and her subtle reactions.

However, Ye Qingtang remained completely calm and unruffled, and he could not discern anything that was amiss.

“If the Holy Lord needs to, we can support the Crown Prince, Ling Yan, to ascend the throne…” Ming Wang said.

When Ming Wang finished speaking, Ye Qingtang laughed coldly. Her lips curled upwards, and an eerie look appeared on her face. “You’re implying that I may be afraid of Ling Yan.”

Before Ming Wang could speak, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flashed coldly. “Ming Wang, as one of the two Holy Sons in the Temple of Shadows, how can you be afraid of a prince of a human dynasty… I’m afraid you are not suited to be the Holy Son. Supporting the Eldest Prince to ascend the throne is a small matter. I am willing to act personally only because it amused me. If I had not thought that the Eternal Dynasty might still be useful, I could flick my fingers and exterminate all eighteen kingdoms in this dynasty.”
