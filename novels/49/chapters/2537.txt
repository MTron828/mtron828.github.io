“Heh, look at what you’re saying. The Devil Cloud Sect always had a knack for sow discording, right? Besides, with the nasty relationship between the Dragon Emperor Clan and the Temple of Paragon, I’m afraid there’s no need for anyone to sow discord.” The red dress woman looked at the white-haired elder and chuckled softly.

“Devil Cloud Sect, I heard that your Paragon was resurrected. I wonder if it’s true.” On the Six-winged Fire Phoenix, the Temple of Paragon practitioner with a silver fox mask spoke softly, his hands behind his back.

The corners of the woman’s lips curled up slightly. “Is there a need to ask? Of course it’s true. It is my esteemed Lord who asked me to come here to investigate the mystery behind the appearance of this Immortal Emperor.”

Elder Bai frowned slightly. Had the Devil Cloud Sect Paragon really been resurrected? Was the red dress woman speaking the truth?

It was common knowledge that the Devil Cloud Sect and the Temple of Paragon had always been archenemies. The two powers were completely different. If the Devil Cloud Sect Paragon had been resurrected, he would probably target the Temple of Paragon.

Although the Temple of Paragon was not necessarily afraid of the Devil Cloud Sect Paragon… the fact was that there was still no news of their own Paragon.

“I say, people from the Temple of Paragon, it’s better for you to return to your temple first. Tell your own Paragon to get ready and wait. I believe that our Paragon will be giving a huge surprise soon.” The red dress woman smiled at the silver fox man and Elder Bai on the phoenix.

“How dare you!”

Elder Bai shouted coldly, “You little brats dare to talk about my Paragon. Do you really not know how insignificant you are?!”

“Heh, Elder Bai, aren’t you getting a little too huffy? I was only telling the truth. How could you take my kind reminder as malicious intent?” The red dress woman’s expression did not change, not showing the slightest fear.

“Since the Devil Cloud Paragon has been resurrected, our own Paragon will also be offering a grand gift.” The silver fox practitioner spoke out nonchalantly.

“Oh? What kind of grand gift is your Paragon going to give my Lord?” The red dress woman’s face was filled with curiosity.

“Your head,” said the silver fox man.

The smile on the woman in red’s face faded. “Is that so?”

In the next second, the silver fox practitioner formed a seal with one hand. The void distorted and everyone from the Devil Cloud Sect, including the red dress woman, was sucked into the distorted space. Even the six-winged fire phoenix, Elder and the silver fox practitioner disappeared.

“Profound Void…”

The First Prince of the Sky Vault Sect smiled and looked at the white-haired elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan. “Elder, the people from the Temple of Paragon and the Devil Cloud Sect have all entered an alternate space. I wonder if we need to interfere. After all, our motive for this trip is that mysterious Immortal Emperor.”

The white-haired elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan replied expressionlessly, “The grudge between the Devil Cloud Sect and the Temple of Paragon has nothing to do with my Dragon Emperor Clan.”

“I agree. In that case, let’s see if that mysterious Immortal Emperor is here or not.”

The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince glanced at his men, while the white-haired elder of the Dragon Emperor Clan also waved his hand.
