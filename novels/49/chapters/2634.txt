Chapter 2635 Shocking Change (1)

In Han Cangming’s eyes, this red light was laughable. In just an instant, Han Cangming’s palm pierced through the red light.

Surprise appeared in Han Cangming’s eyes as the smile on his face froze. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang saw that the red light seemed to have a life of its own as it wrapped around Han Cangming’s palm. Not only that, the red light continued to expand in Han Cangming’s palm. In just a few breaths, it had already reached Han Cangming’s forearm. “What… is this…” Ye Qingtang stared at the red light and frowned. She found it increasingly strange and could not understand. At the same time, the unknown force that restrained Ye Qingtang gradually weakened and completely dissipated, returning her freedom. “This is… the power of the… Karma Bloodline?”

Han Cangming stood rooted to the ground and stared at the red light on his arm.

“Karma Bloodline?”

Ye Qingtang was even more surprised when she heard that. In the lower realm, only one person possessed the Karma Bloodline, and it was Ling Yan…

However, Ye Qingtang felt that something was wrong. She was the only one who came to this distant era. Why was Ling Yan’s Karma Bloodline here?

Ye Qingtang had the chance to escape but after thinking about it, she chose to remain here to wait and see what would happen. To be fair, Ye Qingtang did not want anything to happen to Han Cangming. After all, in Ye Qingtang’s era, Han Cangming did not do anything to her and even helped her.

In this ancient era, Han Cangming still did not know Ye Qingtang. Even though he wanted to kill her because of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, Ye Qingtang did not blame him.

“Are you… alright?”

Ye Qingtang asked Han Cangming.

As soon as she said that, even Ye Qingtang found her own question ridiculous. What kind of existence was Han Cangming? He was an Immortal Emperor, a top-notch expert in the world comparable to the Han Cangming. What could a red light do to him? “Woman, you have two bloodlines in your body… the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline and Karma Bloodline… How amazing,” Han Cangming stared at Ye Qingtang with no expression.

Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded. Han Cangming had misunderstood. She did have the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline in her body, but the Karma Bloodline was not hers. This Karma Bloodline had nothing to do with her. If Ye Qingtang guessed correctly, Ling Yan must have left the Karma Bloodline in her body.

Although Ye Qingtang did not know when Ling Yan left this bloodline in her, it was a fact. Moreover, Ye Qingtang thought that she saw Ling Yan in the Ancient God Karma Tunnel.

However, Ye Qingtang did not know what exactly happened. She was confused.

“Woman, even if you have the Karma Bloodline, you are too naive to think you can use it against me.” Han Cangming stared at Ye Qingtang and his lips curled up.

There had to be a cause and effect for the Karma Bloodline. He had no link with this bloodline. How could it pose a threat to him?

However, Han Cangming’s expression changed again. His body and even his most fundamental power did not reject this Karma Bloodline at all. Not only that, his body was trying to welcome and merge with it.
