Chapter 1080 Eternity is Solitary (1)

He had been living for more than ten thousand years. What kind of concept was that?!

Any cultivator who could live for ten thousand years could become an extremely powerful figure in the world. It was not impossible to even become an Emperor-level figure.

However, it was extremely difficult to live for ten thousand years.

Ye Qingtang stared at the old Valley Master in front of her and could not figure out how he managed to live for so long.

The old Valley Master heard the number and was embedded in memories. It seemed like he was trying to chase his past.

“Ten thousand years…” The old Valley Master sighed after a long while.

“I have lived… for too long. I almost forget about it…”

The old Valley Master swept his eyes across Ye Qingtang. He shook his head slightly and sighed.

“The ancient people consumed the extraordinary lady’s body parts after killing her… I ate her heart… And I have no idea why her heart can give me eternal life…”

The old Valley Master did not avoid talking about the things that happened ten thousand years ago. However, when he mentioned about consuming the body parts, an unusual look appeared in his eyes.

“I see…” Ye Qingtang frowned. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The extraordinary lady ten thousand years ago was really close to a god…

No one would expect that her heart would give eternal life.

However…

The extraordinary lady was too merciful. If not, she would not end up with such a consequence.

She sacrificed everything she had and nurtured a batch of ungrateful people.

“Hehe… I have not been saying these things for a long period of time… Not many from my age are still alive now…” The old Valley Master looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled as he shook his head.

Ye Qingtang stared at the old Valley Master. She could feel a sense of sadness and hopelessness in his eyes when he talked about these things.

However, the expression disappeared after a second. It was hard to catch that if she did not pay attention.

Ye Qingtang understood the whole image from the old Valley Master’s words.

The old Valley Master of Falling Sky Valley should be an ancient person from ten thousand years ago.

After killing the extraordinary lady, the old Valley Master ate her heart and had eternal life.However, the curse left by the extraordinary lady prevented the ancient people of that age from leaving this mainland.

The only way to break the curse was to get the extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode.

If the old Valley Master got his hand on the Spiritual Abode, he could break the curse and leave the mainland.

As long as he was able to leave the mainland, his power would increase exponentially with his ten thousand years of life…

The old Valley Master looked around, and a trace of hesitation appeared in his eyes. However, the hesitation disappeared immediately.

The old Valley Master raised his hand in the next second. A black glint exploded from the black pearl at his glabella and turned all corpses into black fog.

“Old Valley Master… What do you want!”

Perfected Xuanchen stared at the old Valley Master and shouted. An ominous feeling arose in his heart.
