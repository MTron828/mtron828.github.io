Ye Xun nodded immediately and filed a suit despite being the evil-doer. “Elder Xu, this person has been opposing Sister You since in the First Mainland and brought many troubles to Sister You. She must have snatched that Bone of the Dragon Breath intentionally today because of her hatred toward Sister You! Elder Xu, you must not let such a despicable person off!”

Elder Xu took a glance at Ye You, who had an aversive expression, and believed Ye Xun. He then shot Ye Qingtang a cold, murderous look.

“There’s actually such an impetuous person who dares to offend a lady of the Jiang Family time and time again.”

A powerful aura was emitted by Elder Xu. In the assault of that aura, Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord turned pale from the repressive force.

Ye Qingtang clearly sensed the difference between herself and Elder Xu. She glanced at Beidou Demon Lord, and her expression changed. Then, she resisted the repression with all her might and spoke.

“I was the one who bade the Bone of the Dragon Breath, and Ye You’s enemy is me. This has nothing to do with the young ape.”

Beidou Demon Lord was stunned to hear that. He bolted to Ye Qingtang’s front immediately and growled. “If you all dare to harm my little sister, it will be over my dead body!”

That huge frame was like a tall wall that did its best to block Ye Qingtang from all harm.

Tears suddenly welled up in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at the back view of Beidou Demon Lord.

Her sworn brother… really did not change at all.

In her past and present lives, he always protected her with his life.

“Ha. There’s no need to fight. Both of you will die here today,” Elder Xu snickered.

A pleased expression emerged on Ye Xun’s face. Back then, she was forced to flee Lin Town by Ye Qingtang, but she was about to personally witness Ye Qingtang’s death now. How could it not be satisfactory?

“Ye Qingtang, this is because you courted death. Who do you think you are to fight with Sister You? You aren’t even fit to carry Sister You’s shoes!”

Ye You’s eyes swept across Ye Qingtang, and a seeming smile played on her lips before speaking to Elder Xu beside her. “Grandfather is still waiting for me to return. Please settle these two people as quickly as possible, Elder Xu.”

Elder Xu nodded and attacked immediately. He exuded a destructive aura that lingered around him.

With a furious roar, Beidou Demon Lord pounded the ground with his fists, and the ground beneath his feet cracked the instant his enormous fists crashed onto the ground. Endless boulders were formed from the ground, and he hurled those boulders at Elder Xu with roars.

However, those heavy boulders did not even break Elder Xu’s defense and were crushed into pieces instead.

“Little sister, leave first!” Beidou Demon Lord knew that Elder Xu was formidable, and he and Ye Qingtang would probably still die even if they fought for their lives. Instead, he could stall for some time to give Ye Qingtang a chance to survive.

How could Ye Qingtang abandon Beidou Demon Lord behind and leave by herself?

Ye Qingtang unsheathed her sword immediately and prepared to fight alongside Beidou Demon Lord.

However, just as Elder Xu was about to strike his lethal move, a bolt of lightning suddenly struck the spot before Elder Xu and blocked his way. In the next second, numerous bolts of lightning from the sky struck right at Ye You and Ye Xun, who were watching the show at the back.

The speed of those lightning flashes were extremely furious. Ye You frowned slightly while Ye Xun turned pale from shock.

What is happening?
