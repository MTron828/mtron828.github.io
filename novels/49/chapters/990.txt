Chapter 991 The Long Family (3)

The next moment, Ye Qingtang used two fingers to swiftly intercept the longswords wielded by the two maidservants from the Long Family.

“You dare to resist?!”

The two maidservants from the Long Family shouted coldly in rage.

Ye Qingtang lips immediately curved upwards. She formed the aura of the Seventh Heaven Yang Lord into a straight line and suddenly enclosed the two maidservants from the Long Family in it.

The two maidservants from the Long Family, who had been so overbearingly arrogant just a moment ago, were completely stunned. They trembled violently all over when they felt the force of the Yang Lord.

Everyone present saw that the two maidservants from the Long Family seemed to be suddenly struck dumb and were rooted to the spot. No one knew just what had happened.

The invincible power of the Yang Lord had swept the maidservants from the Long Family into an abyss from which there was no redemption.

The shocking power of a Seventh Heaven Yin Yang Perfected Lord instantly wiped out the physical and mental strength of the two maidservants from the Long Family.

It was no exaggeration to say that even Long Family’s Master, who was known as the invincible Yin Yang Perfected Lord half-step, was tens of thousands of times weaker than Ye Qingtang in terms of pure martial power, much less these two maidservants.

Ye Qingtang was eight realms beyond them. If she wanted to, she could kill all living things within the entire Lin Town with just her force. She could turn Lin Town into a dead town within the span of a single breath.

“The ignorant have no fear.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the two shocked maidservants from the Long Family. With a light dab of her finger, she instantly pierced through their brows.

As everyone looked on in disbelief, the two maidservants from the Long Family collapsed to the ground like a pile of soft mud. They were dead.

“Ye Qingtang… you… you dare…”

At that moment, all the disciples and the senior members of the Ye Family stared at the two maidservants from the Long Family in disbelief.

The statuses of these two maidservants were immaterial. Even an insignificant servant in the Long Family was a member of the Long Family. Ye Qingtang had publicly killed these members of the Long Family…

Many members of the Ye Family had already felt uneasy when Ye Qingtang had injured Duan Yangjing. Now, this feeling grew even stronger.

“Ye Qingtang, you dare to rely on the treasures you obtained from the mystic realm of your sect to kill members of the Long Family… you…”

Some senior members glared at Ye Qingtang and shouted at her angrily.

Not only would Ye Qingtang have to die for offending the Long Family, but they would also be implicated!

Even Ye Ling had not thought that Ye Qingtang would really kill the maidservants from the Long Family…

“Mystic realm of the sect… treasure…”

When she heard the senior members’ words, Long Rui muttered thoughtfully to herself.

“This Ye Qingtang must have obtained numerous treasures from the mystic realm of her sect… my father was also utterly defeated by those treasures.” Duan Tianrao frowned and said. He had been puzzled by how Ye Qingtang had suddenly become so powerful. Now that he heard what the Ye Family said, he thought that it was plausible.

“So there really is a treasure…” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Long Rui immediately swept a glance at her surroundings. When she saw the weapons that everyone in the Ye Family was holding, a look of surprise flashed across her eyes.

The Ye Family had numerous premium yellow-grade weapons, and she also spotted many valuable elixirs.

Each item was so valuable that it was difficult to estimate its worth. Even her father’s divine weapon was merely a superior yellow-grade weapon…

Long Rui immediately closed both eyes and used the power of communication that was unique to the Long Family to connect with her father.

Within the span of two breaths, Long Rui reopened her eyes and looked at Duan Tianrao. “My father and the others have arrived.”
