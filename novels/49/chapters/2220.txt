Chapter 2221: Night Soul Beast (3)

Thereafter, the Night Soul Beast’s weakness was made known throughout the entire Second Domain. The Evil Soul Forest’s notorious reputation was dispelled after that.

Born from negative feelings, this was a monster who swallowed souls. But it was also an evil being who feared laughter and happiness.

If Ye Qingtang did not know of this, she would not have dared to bring Lei Yan and the rest of the brats into this place. She had Lei Yan and the rest split up and hide in separate corners as she didn’t want them gathered together and feed the Night Soul Beast with their accumulated fear.

Meanwhile, Mu Ziying was the youngest. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ye Qingtang was worried she might panic due to her young age, and so especially gave her a calming elixir.

When dealing with a Night Soul Beast, the most dangerous thing was the fear of others feeding the beast and making it grow stronger.

The Night Soul Beast wished to escape from the hands of this strange human. But every time it struggled, Ye Qingtang would smile at it.

The smile was a pure one that reached the eyes, making the corners crinkle with joy.

That kind of pure happiness was the most detestable thing to a Night Soul Beast. It trembled and suddenly felt drained of all energy by Ye Qingtang’s smile...

Lei Yan and the others were already prepared to fight to the death with that Night Soul Beast. But after waiting vigilantly for very long, and unable to tell what was happening because their eyes were closed and ears covered, they were filled with worry for Ye Qing.

Meanwhile, the Spy Cloud man, who had been trembling in fear and had shut his eyes just to wait for his death, also waited for a long time but didn’t feel any sense of imminent death. He opened his eyes in panic.

Only to see...

The formerly wretched scene had turned extraordinarily calm. That common-looking youth was now standing safe and sound in the forest, holding a horned, grey cat.

“Where... where is the Night Soul Beast?” The man stammered.

Ye Qingtang replied, “I don’t know. When I was fighting it, it suddenly left.”

The man was dumbstruck. He really couldn’t believe that the Night Soul Beast, who had been pursuing him for so long, suddenly just turned and left?

Ye Qingtang didn’t say anything more but just went over to pat Lei Yan and the others, who were still standing with their eyes closed and ears covered.

The teenagers leaped up in all readiness for a big fight but realized that it was just Ye Qing before them. They heaved a sigh of relief.

“Boss... where did that Night Soul Beast go?” Lei Yan was still feeling very unsteady. He surveyed the surroundings but couldn’t see the Night Soul Beast.

The others were also equally confused.

“Perhaps it sensed something, it left suddenly,” Ye Qing replied casually.

The teenagers did not know much about the Night Soul Beast and so just accepted her explanation.

“But... Boss, didn’t you say earlier that the Night Soul Beast would remember our scent and keep pursuing us? Will it suddenly return later?” Lei Yan swallowed hard.

“That’s not impossible,” Ye Qing replied.

Lei Yan’s heart leaped up to his eyes again.

“So you all need to become more powerful before it returns. Otherwise, you will never be able to escape it even after leaving the Evil Soul Forest.” Ye Qing lied in all seriousness.

It was also a myth that the Night Soul Beast would pursue a human to the ends of the earth. In reality, the Night Soul Beast would never leave the Evil Soul Forest.

Of course, Ye Qingtang would never tell them that. Instead, she wanted them to stay alert and motivated to improve their powers in this Evil Soul Forest.
