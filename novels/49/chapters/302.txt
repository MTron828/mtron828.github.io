Chapter 303: Spirit Consonance River (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Spirit Consonance River was the spot richest in spirit energy in Xuanling Sect and was the main area where inner sect disciples spent Xuanming points on.

In her previous lifetime, Ye Qingtang went to the Spirit Consonance River once before. Although it was only a brief two hours of cultivation, the effects were extremely astonishing. It was already so amazing when she did not have a spirit root that time, and now with a spirit root, it would go without saying that the effects would be even greater.

However…

Although the Spirit Consonance River was good, inner sect disciples were required to pay one thousand Xuanming points for two hours of usage, and there were not many who could afford to use it.

Ye Qingtang passed through a long aisle and reached the entrance of the Spirit Consonance River which was situated at the back.

Since teaching wardens were still giving lessons at this time, there were few disciples in the Spirit Consonance River, and only a handful of inner sect disciples walked out of the Spirit Consonance River.

The warden outside the Spirit Consonance River saw someone coming and instinctively looked up. However, there was a look of surprise on his face immediately as he found it a little strange to see the young lady before him.

“Disciple Ye Qingtang is here to exchange for the Spirit Consonance River’s usage rights.” Ye Qingtang went forward and reported her identity.

“Ye Qingtang?” The warden frowned slightly as this name was foreign to him. He scanned Ye Qingtang and asked, “Are you an outer sect disciple?”

This question attracted the attention of other inner sect disciples, who could not help but look at Ye Qingtang in surprise.

Outer sect disciple?

Is this a joke? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Even outer sect disciples dare to exchange for the Spirit Consonance River’s usage rights now?” An inner sect disciple could not help but size up Ye Qingtang.

The warden frowned more deeply. He had managed the Spirit Consonance River for many years, and the number of outer sect disciples who exchanged for usage rights could be counted with a hand. Although the Spirit Consonance River was open to the entire sect, this girl…

The warden lifted his chin slightly and spoke to Ye Qingtang impatiently. “Are you sure? The usage rights for the Spirit Consonance River is one thousand Xuanming points. If you are an outer sect disciple, you will need to pay five times that amount, totaling to five thousand Xuanming points. Do you really want to exchange?”

The few inner sect disciples snickered at the warden’s words.

Even inner sect disciples like them felt a pinch when spending one thousand Xuanming points to use the Spirit Consonance River.

If outer sect disciples wanted to use the Spirit Consonance River, they had to pay five times the amount.

And even if there were some outer sect elites who could afford five thousand Xuanming points, no one dared to squander like that.

This outer sect junior sister must have been unaware of the difference between the outer sect and inner sect and thought that she only needed to spend one thousand Xuanming points to enter the Spirit Consonance River.

Ye Qingtang ignored the stares and said, “Yes, I am sure.”

The warden frowned and asked coldly, “How many hours do you want to exchange for then?”

“Six hours.” Ye Qingtang replied.

The moment she said that, the warden’s face was full of surprise.

Six hours?

That would require fifteen thousand Xuanming points!

How could this disciple have so many?

The few inner sect disciples were a little bewildered as well. She spent fifteen thousand Xuanming points at one go. Even inner sect disciples like them did not dare to take this move!

Was this little junior sister an idiot!!

“You have fifteen thousand Xuanming points?” The warden evidently did not believe her.
