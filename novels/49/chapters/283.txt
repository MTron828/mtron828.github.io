And just when Elder Lin confidently thought that Ye Qingtang would hand the Revolving Soul Orb to him without a doubt, Ye Qingtang changed her direction slightly and handed it straight in front of Elder Qin.

“Please accept this item, Elder.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Elder Qin was taken aback, and delight flashed across his eyes. He stretched his hand out to take the Revolving Soul Orb, and a smile bloomed on his face.

“Sure sure sure. What a promising student who is worth teaching. I will definitely keep this item well. Ye Qingtang, you made a huge contribution this time. The sect will definitely reward you handsomely.”

Never would Elder Qin have thought that such a blessing would happen to him, and he laughed brightly.

Elder Lin, who was putting on a front, felt the arrogance on his face disappear completely. He glared at Ye Qingtang, who gave the Revolving Soul Orb to Elder Qin, as though he was going to devour her alive.

He never expected Ye Qingtang to actually present the Revolving Soul Orb to Elder Qin!

This was simply a slap in his face!

Elder Qin glanced at Elder Lin with a proud expression and showered Ye Qingtang with compliments.

Ye Qingtang stood there humbly and internally scoffed when she saw Elder Lin going green in the face from the corner of her eyes.

On the other hand, the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s lips twitched when he witnessed Ye Qingtang handing the Revolving Soul Orb into Elder Qin’s hands.

The elders from other sects were extremely envious but could not do anything about it as well. They secretly bad-mouthed Elder Qin for having dumb luck as Xuanling Sect did not have many casualties, and he even obtained a treasure without doing anything.

The Xuanling Sect disciples also had envious expressions on their faces, but they were envious of Ye Qingtang, who picked up the Revolving Soul Orb, and not Elder Qin. Judging from the rare excitement of all the elders, it was easy to realize how precious that treasure was. Ye Qingtang really made a huge contribution this time, and there would probably be many rewards waiting for her once she returned to the sect.

Elder Qin smiled blissfully, but Elder Lin pulled a long face.

After searching Deer City for another round and ensuring that there was no trace of the Blood Moon Sect Elder, the sects finally returned.

Before leaving, the teen from Wind Moon Sect suddenly found Ye Qingtang. He bowed to her and expressed his gratitude before leaving with his Master.

Elder Qin and Elder Lin led the group back. Ye Qingtang and the rest were considered to have completed this mission and returned to the sect immediately.

Qin Huan was very puzzled over why Ye Qingtang gave the item to the Elder of the inner sect Array Faction. “You foolish girl. Elder Lin is then the elder of the inner sect Sword Faction. Why didn’t you give the item to him?”

Ye Qingtang chuckled. “I like it.”

“…” Qin Huan remained silent.

Despite meeting with danger, everyone was able to return safely and was thankful to Ye Qingtang for diverting the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s attention.

When they returned to the sect, Dai Changming headed straight to submit the mission. Everyone bade their goodbyes and returned to take a required rest after suffering a huge fright.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder looked at the sect disciples who walked about the sect as though he saw an infinite surge of spirit energy waiting right before him for him to obtain.

Ye Qingtang sensed the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s gaze and warned. “If you don’t want your identity to be exposed, you better not do anything funny.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder immediately put on a loyal and honest look. “That’s a given.”

Ye Qingtang cast him a look skeptically. As Ye Qingtang was about to return to the dorm, a commotion occurred outside the sect, and a faint smell of blood spread in the air.
