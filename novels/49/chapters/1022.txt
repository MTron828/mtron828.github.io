Chapter 1023 The Funniest Joke (1)

Ye Qingtang was not at all surprised to see people from the Yunxiao Sect appear in Lin Town. In fact, she seemed to think it was perfectly natural.

The Yunxiao Sect had been aware that she had obtained a Fiendcelestial Beast in the Hell of Avicinaraka. They would certainly not let it slide and would send senior members of the sect to Lin Town to stake out the Ye House and wait for her to appear.

Little white tiger had been sleeping for nearly half a month. It had awakened once during this period to tell Ye Qingtang that its body was undergoing a transformation and would need a lot of sleep.

Ye Qingtang had already ordered a room to be cleared out in the Ye House for the little white tiger. She had placed the little white tiger in the room and asked the lightning dragon to guard it.

Now, the YunXiao Sect was unaware that it was courting disaster and was still thinking of snatching Ye Qingtang’s Fiendcelestial Beast…

After she returned to the Ye House, Ye Qingtang retreated to the study without making an appearance.

At that moment, the two elders from the Yunxiao Sect arrived in the vicinity of the Ye House. After studying it for a moment, they realized that the Ye House seemed rather different.

The Ye Family had previously been an ordinary clan in Lin Town. But now, it looked incredibly imposing, and the residence seemed to have expanded greatly.

“Who are you!”

Before the two elders from the YunXiao Sect could enter the Ye House, they were blocked by several Ye Family disciples who were guarding the door.

“This is the territory of the Ye Family. Miscellaneous people cannot approach!” One of the talented youths who had just joined the Ye Family shouted coldly.

“Get lost.” Elder Gu from the Yunxiao Sect looked at the Ye Family disciple who had spoken and spoke calmly.

When he heard Elder Gu’s words, the Ye Family disciple’s expression immediately darkened. No one had ever dared to speak to him like that. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Ah… he’s quite a braggart.”

Another young girl’s gaze fell on Elder Gu of the Yunxiao Sect.

“I asked you if Ye Qingtang has returned.” Elder Yin spoke at that moment.

“Oh, you know our family’s Eldest Young Lady?”

When they heard Elder Yin mention Ye Qingtang’s name, the Ye Family disciples were slightly taken aback. If these were the Eldest Young Lady’s friends, then they were in trouble. But they could not be blamed because these two men had not made themselves clear upon arrival.

“Answer my question.” Elder Yin was rather impatient.

“Eldest Young Lady is indeed at home,” one of the Ye Family disciples said.

“Very good. Has Ye Qingtang brought a little white tiger back, and is that little white tiger in the Ye Family residence?” Elder Yin continued.

When they heard the elderly man’s tone, the Ye Family disciples felt that something was amiss. If these two men were Eldest Young Lady’s friends, why would they speak so condescendingly?

One of them realized that the totem unique to the Yunxiao Sect was embroidered on these two elderly men’s robes and belongings, and they seemed to be senior members of a super sect.

“We are elders of the Yunxiao Sect. Ye Qingtang has committed atrocious crimes and will be judged by the sect. If you want to live, you better not play any tricks. Tell us the truth,” Elder Gu said coldly.

“Eldest Young Lady is going to be judged by the sect?”

When they heard Elder Yin’s words, the newly minted Ye Family disciples exchanged glances and then burst into laughter.

This was the funniest joke they had heard in their lives! Even they had no regard for the little Yunxiao Sect. Now, it was wildly asserting that it would judge an invincible Yang Lord, a peak Seventh Heaven Yin Yang Perfected Lord?! Even the Beiming Manor would not dare to be so arrogant, much less the Yunxiao Sect with its power as a super sect!
