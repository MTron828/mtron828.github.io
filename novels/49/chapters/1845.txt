Chapter 1846: Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm (1)

They were unconscious when the remains of the Cursed True God were destroyed. If Ye Qingtang hadn’t taken them out of the mystic realm, they would have been trapped in there forever.

After all, Ye Qingtang had nothing to do with them, other than the fact that they had entered the mystic realm at the same time. In contrast, Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang were both from the Jiang family, so it wasn’t surprising that Ye Qingtang saved Jiang Shaobai. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was partly thanks to Jiang Shaobai that Ye Qingtang saved them too.

“No words can express my gratitude towards you. I’ll remember this forever.” Baili Xi suddenly got up and spoke. He was a man of few words, this was his first time saying so many words to someone other than his younger sister.

Mu Feiruo also got up to voice his thanks.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze shifted. “Coughs. Don’t you need to find some clothes to put on?”

Only then Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo noticed that the outerwear had ripped open when they got up. They exposed every part of their body, even those that they shouldn’t.

The two astonishing geniuses’ faces flushed red. They panicked and quickly took some clothes out from the space ring and put them on.

As for Jiang Shaobai, he was rather calm compared to them. He slowly put on his clothes, wanting to move towards Ye Qingtang again but she only glared at him in response. All he could do was to back off.

Jiang Shaobai wasn’t happy and he looked at Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo. “Isn’t it too late to be feeling embarrassed? Both of you have already exposed yourselves when you were unconscious earlier...”

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo, “...”

They really had the urge to sew his mouth together!

Ye Qingtang thought the same...

Wasn’t Jiang Shaobai too mean?

“My pet helped cover your bodies with the outerwear.” Ye Qingtang told a white lie so they wouldn’t die of embarrassment.

It was only after they heard this that Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo breathed a sigh of relief.

Jiang Shaobai was just about to say something mean again but before he started, Ye Qingtang shot a glare in his direction.

“Actually, how I wish Sister Qing would personally put it on for me...” Jiang Shaobai said.

“Ha ha...” Ye Qingtang didn’t want to bother with him.

Mu Feiruo had always dressed as a female and so the clothes in the space ring were all female clothing. But now that his gender had been revealed, if he were to put on female clothing again...

He couldn’t help but recall Ye Qingtang calling those people ‘perverts’ earlier on.

He instantly put the clothes back into the space ring, borrowing a set of clothing from Baili Xi as he changed into it. After putting on the clothes, a trio of handsome men were facing Ye Qingtang.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were extremely good-looking. Baili Xi had a cold aura like that of a Young Master, while Mu Feiruo had a pair of attractive almond-shaped eyes. His beauty was understated when dressed as a female, but after putting on male clothing...

Somehow, Ye Qingtang felt that his charisma could not be contained.

Ye Qingtang was intelligent, she kept her thoughts to herself and didn’t mention anything that would make Mu Feiruo feel uncomfortable.

“This doesn’t seem to be an island.” Mu Feiruo seemed to be more normal after putting on clothes. He scanned the surroundings, realizing that everything was unfamiliar to him.

“The aura here is similar to the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm we entered the other time, just that the interior is completely different,” Baili Xi said.

They had entered the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm before and even though the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm would change every single time, the overall feeling would still be somewhat similar.
