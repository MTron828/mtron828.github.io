“Holy Lady, it’s not possible.” The Blood Moon Elder shook his head after hearing Ye Qingtang’s prediction.

This piece of land had a limited supply of spirit energy. Even a mighty Holy Venerate’s ability would be suppressed at the peak of the level of a Yin Yang True Lord on this land.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord’s ability had surpassed that of the Ultimate Elder, but the mainland suppressed his ability at the peak of the level of a Yin Yang True Lord. That was the reason why he was chased by the Ultimate Elder.

The Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka could pose dangers to gods as their abilities would also be suppressed at the level of a Yin Yang True Lord. How was it possible to play any tricks here?

Ye Qingtang pinched her glabella. Maybe she thought too much.

The starting of the Hell of Avicinaraka would last for half a month. Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder would need to spend another fourteen days in the Hell of Avicinaraka. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

When they were about to leave, ten young men and ladies arrived at the place.

The ten people were from the Nine Nights Dynasty and the Formidable Heavens Dynasty, including the Falling Sky Valley, the Ouyang family, and the Yuehua sect.

Ye Qingtang was a little curious. People of the two dynasties were together?!

“Hey brother, I’m Feng Cong, disciple of the Falling Sky Valley. May I know what happened here?!”

One of the men from the Falling Sky Valley walked over when he saw Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder. He frowned when he saw the collapsed temple and a few corpses.

Two of the corpses were Falling Sky Valley disciples.

Ye Qingtang held her fists together and said, “My surname is Ye.”

She then explained the truth to them.

“So that is how it is.” Feng Cong nodded and did not challenge anything.

“The Hundred Level Peril mystic realm was… extremely odd. We were sent to different locations when we entered the mystic realm and lost contact with our sect. We struggled to survive along the way. Initially, there were ten people in my team, but now, only ten of us are left in the entire mystic realm after one day.” Feng Cong sighed.

They would have never entered the place if they knew that it was the Hundred Level Peril mystic realm. However, there was no way out now.

“Brother Ye, are you interested in joining us? We need to work together in the Hundred Level Peril mystic realm. If not, we may all die here.”

“That is what I’m thinking.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Are you interested as well, this lady?”

Feng Cong’s eyesight landed on the Blood Moon Elder after getting Ye Qingtang’s reply.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder: …

“Brother Feng, she is my servant. It’s not necessary to ask for her opinion,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Okay.” Feng Cong nodded but still sized up the Blood Moon Elder.

Brother Ye’s taste is really fresh…

“Is it the illusion stone in your hand, Young Sir?”

A shy lady walked over slowly, and she looked at Ye Qingtang with her enchanting eyes.

“Ouyang Qian…”

Ye Qingtang scoffed in her heart as she looked at the lady in front of her.

Ouyang Qian had tormented in her previous life all the time!

However, she was very pretty. The men in the team all surrounded her.

Some of the men in the team stared at Ye Qingtang with hostility when they witnessed that Ouyang Qian seemed to be interested in Ye Qingtang.
