Chapter 1297: Unreasonable (2)

Mo Yunxian did not care whether Ye Qingtang had been rude or not. She only knew that she detested that face that was more exquisite than hers.

She could not tolerate this seductive girl shamelessly toasting her Elder Brother Yan!

Also, Mo Yunxian had never met Ye Qingtang. When she saw that Ye Qingtang’s clothes were not very luxurious, she guessed that Ye Qingtang was not very important.

Furthermore…

As the daughter of a great general, Mo Yunxian had never feared anyone in the entire Eternal Dynasty. When she heard that these were the Eldest Prince’s guests, she did not have any reservations.

The Eldest Prince frowned deeply, as if angered by Mo Yunxian’s words.

Ye Qingtang looked on coolly. This Mo Yunxian was exactly the same as she had been in her previous life.

In her previous life, Mo Yunxian had also been like that, simply finding any excuse to destroy her looks.

However…

Things were different now.

Before Ye Qingtang could move, a black figure suddenly rushed forward.

Mo Yunxian was about to say something else when she suddenly sensed an intense murderous aura rushing towards her.

Mo Yunxian almost subconsciously tried to block the oncoming blow.

But the force was unbelievably strong. She did not even have time to raise her hand before an immense force smashed into her shoulder.

An agonizing pain instantly spread through Mo Yunxian’s entire body. She fell to the ground, her carefully chosen outfit spattered with blood. Her shoulder blade had been smashed by the force.

“Who are you? How dare you to talk to Ah Yao like that!” Ming Gu was suddenly standing in front of Ye Qingtang, radiating a demonic aura. At that moment, Ming Gu was shrouded in a strong aura of death. The charming look had vanished from his exquisite little face, replaced by a viciousness that was akin to a killing god that had descended to earth. His liquid, black eyes seemed to be bottomless pits of death.

Mo Yunxian had not expected someone to actually strike her at the Eternal Emperor’s banquet She had never been so seriously injured before. She stared at this demon-like child.

“You dared to hit me?”

“Disgusting smelly grub, why haven’t you died yet…” Ming Gu frowned slightly as he looked at Mo Yunxian, who had actually withstood his blow. He suddenly lifted his small hand and prepared to kill this reckless smelly grub.

Ming Gu’s action completely shocked everyone. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Holy Son Ming Gu, have mercy.” The Eternal Emperor snapped out of his trance and spoke hurriedly.

Ming Gu did not seem to hear him. To him, the Eternal Emperor was a nobody. The only person who was important to him was Ye Qingtang.

Just before Ming Gu struck, Ye Qingtang suddenly reached out her hand and patted Ming Gu’s shoulder.

Ming Gu paused and turned. The vicious look on his face instantly transformed into a charming expression.

“Ah Yao?”

Ye Qingtang calmly shook her head at Ming Gu.

“Holy Son Ming Gu, today is the Eternal Emperor’s banquet. It is not appropriate for us to dampen his spirits.” Ye Qingtang spoke with a faint smile.

Ming Gu frowned slightly, but in the end, he withdrew his hand. Only his eyes swept coldly over Mo Yunxian. His gaze was so cold that it was almost freezing.

“How dare you fight at His Majesty’s banquet! You…” Mo Yunxian was in such pain that she had broken out in a cold sweat, but she had never been so humiliated in her life, so she continued to shout.
