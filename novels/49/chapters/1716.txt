Chapter 1717: The Undead (3)

“You are so unlucky to have entered this mystic realm, you will never be able to leave again. You will forever be trapped here and suffer the slow passing of time, never growing old and never dying, until your flesh melts away and your blood runs dry. In the end you will be like us, turning into skeletons and remaining this way forever, living in this frosty landscape.” One of the skeletons holding a heavy sword shook his head with a sigh.

Ye Qingtang looked at that skeleton, but her gaze was suddenly attracted by the sword in his hand.

“The Sword of Destruction?” Ye Qingtang was stunned by the sight of that sword.

“Wow Qin Zhuo, she actually recognized your Sword of Destruction...” Another skeleton with an iron chain hanging around its neck chuckled.

“You are Qin Zhuo? The Deity of the Sword of Destruction, Qin Zhuo?” Ye Qingtang stared in amazement at the skeleton.

Tens of thousands of years ago in the Second Domain, Qin Zhuo was the famous Deity of the Sword of Destruction. Legend had it that with the Sword of Destruction in hand, he could even slash the sun and moon in half with just one move. Ye Qingtang had heard his legendary stories when she was travelling toward the Second Domain in her previous life.

Qin Zhuo’s Sword of Destruction was the target of countless powerful practitioners in the Second Domain. Qin Zhuo had personally slaughtered millions of enemies in fierce battles where the blood ran thick as rivers. His reputation as the Deity of the Sword of Destruction had been forged since then.

But tens of thousands of years ago, Qin Zhuo disappeared from the Second Domain with the Sword of Destruction. Ye Qingtang had only seen the Sword of Destruction in pictures.

Holding the Sword of Destruction, Qin Zhuo stared at Ye Qingtang with his empty eye sockets. No one could tell what he was thinking.

“The Deity of the Sword of Destruction. Ha, I haven’t heard this name in such a long time. If you didn’t mention it, we would have nearly forgotten he used to be called by that name.” Another skeleton rubbed his bare chin thoughtfully.

“Yuan Di, are you that bored?” Qin Zhuo snorted.

Yuan Di?

Ye Qingtang stared at the skeleton rubbing his chin. Her eyes were full of astonishment.

“You guys are... the top fighters from the Second Domain?” Ye Qingtang scanned the crowd of skeletons. There were quite a number of them bearing famous mythical weapons that belonged to the divine soldiers of the Second Domain. But those divine soldiers had disappeared from the Second Domain tens of thousands of years ago.

Yuan Di said, “Top fighters from the Second Domain? Perhaps, once upon a time, but now we are just a bunch of skeletons.”

“Why are you all trapped here? And how did you turn into... this?” Ye Qingtang was filled with curiosity. All these people possessed immense power and skills. How did they become skeletons trapped in this God-forsaken place?

“Didn’t I just tell you? It won’t be long before you become like us,” Qin Zhuo answered.

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“We became like that because we stepped into the cursed sacred land. This mystic realm,” Yuan Di explained.

“Cursed land?” This was not the first time Ye Qingtang had heard of this phrase. Previously in the Land of Infinite Demons, Jiang Yu and the rest had also been trapped in a similar place.

However...

Compared to Jiang Yu and the rest, Yuan Di and the others appeared to have suffered a much more terrible fate.

“All this resulted from the original sin of humans... sigh...” Yuan Di couldn’t help sighing softly before he glanced at Ye Qingtang. “Do you know where the First Domain is?”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as doubt filled her eyes. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
