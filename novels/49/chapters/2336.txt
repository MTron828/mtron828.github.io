Chapter 2337: Perfect Quality (3)

Song Yanhan maintained his usual expression. After all, he had always been very confident of his own skills.

Looking at the teachers’ reactions, the candidates knew that Song Yanhan’s refinement had been successful and the quality must be pretty good.

“Song Yanhan is really a genius freak. This Sky Spirit Jade Elixir is so perversely difficult. To think that he was able to concoct it.”

“I have to concede defeat, it’s pointless to try and compare myself to him. It will be a breeze for me to qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition if I am even half as good as Song Yanhan.”

Just as the crowd was full of admiration and praise for Song Yanhan, a bluish-green glow suddenly appeared in the arena.

Everyone’s attention was instantly attracted by that glow.

Turning to look, the crowd was stunned by what they saw.

Everyone had nearly forgotten about Yun Chen. No one noticed that he had just finished his refinement. The flame in his palm had disappeared and a glowing bluish-green elixir rested on his palm.

A single glance was enough to send everyone into a stupefied daze.

“What is going on?”

“Is this for real? Yun Chen really managed to produce it?”

“What the… No matter how I look at it… the color of his elixir appears to be even purer than Song Yanhan’s.”

Song Yanhan had also noticed the situation and his brow furrowed in consternation. Startled, the teachers walked over to Yun Chen. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Up on the high stage, Zhu Ning’s expression turned extremely grave. The moment they ascertained the quality of Yun Chen’s elixir, he would know whether it was the palm flame.

Those teachers arrived at Yun Chen’s side. Right from the first glance, they were instantly bewildered by his Sky Spirit Jade Elixir. After all, they were all alchemists and could easily determine the quality of elixirs.

From the moment they approached Yun Chen, the light fragrance of the Sky Spirit Jade Elixir drifted into their nostrils.

Just the scent alone instantly washed away all their tiredness. Even Song Yanhan’s Sky Spirit Jade Elixir did not have that effect.

The teachers exchanged glances.

As teachers from the medicine faculty, they knew of Yun Chen’s reputation. They had been frustrated by his lack of skill and chose to simply ignore him.

But now, the Sky Spirit Jade Elixir resting in his palm had stunned them all.

“The quality of this elixir…” One of the teachers had a strange expression on his face. He picked up the pill and examined it closely with the other teachers.

Song Yanhan was also watching the entire process.

“Good! Good! Good!”

Exhilarated exclamations rang out from the mouths of those teachers, and the entire crowd found themselves dazed by the teachers’ shouts.

What did they mean by “good”?

“Yun Chen, we never expected you to be able to successfully concoct a perfect quality Sky Spirit Jade Elixir. You have given us a great surprise.” One of the teachers looked at Yun Chen with an ear-splitting beam on his face. He happily patted Yun Chen on the back, his excitement evident for all to see.

“A perfect quality Sky Spirit Jade Elixir? Are you kidding me? By Yun Chen?” Everyone was dumbstruck by the teacher’s words.

Those medicine faculty students stared at Yun Chen in shock. They suspected that they must be too tired after standing there the whole day, and were hallucinating now.

How challenging was it to refine a Sky Spirit Jade Elixir?

And how lousy was Yun Chen’s skill level?

Perfect quality? Impossible! No one believed that Yun Chen could even refine it in the first place. But why would the medicine faculty teachers tell a lie in front of everyone?
