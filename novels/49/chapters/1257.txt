Chapter 1258: The Misery Inside (2)

However…

Kill Luo Qufeng?

Haha…

That was thinking too much.

If possible, Ye Qingtang would definitely be the one who fled the fastest.

Unfortunately…

She had no choice.

However indignant she was deep down, she still had to pretend to be elegant and calm on the outside; Ye Qingtang was truly in misery.

“Are you willing to enlighten me now, Holy Lord?” A look of deviousness darted across Luo Qufeng’s eyes. He could no longer wait to absorb the strong powers of the Holy Lord of Shadows for his own use.

Ye Qingtang looked at the ambitious Luo Qufeng indifferently and said casually, “There’s no need for any flashy moves. Show me your most powerful move. I’ll just play with you.”

Ye Qingtang’s calm tone and words astonished many.

The Holy Lord of Shadows actually told Luo Qufeng to directly use his most powerful move. What kind of confidence was this?!

The guests were so exhilarated that they wanted to cheer her on.

Even more so, Luo Qufeng clearly felt the belittlement from the “Holy Lord of Shadows”.

“Since Holy Lord has already said so, I will not dampen your spirits.” A cold glint flashed across Luo Qufeng’s eyes, and the red gleam around him intensified by more than ten times. The scarlet gleam exuded a suffocating aura such that even the surrounding air seemed to be distorted by his powers.

Ye Qingtang secretly held her breath and concentrated. Her heart reached her throat when she saw that Luo Qufeng’s powers skyrocketed suddenly. Her hand that was hidden in her sleeves moved slightly, and no one discovered her subtle actions with the concealment of her wide sleeves.

A wild wind stirred up. The scarlet gleam around Luo Qufeng swayed like a raging blaze.

“In the war with the Second Domain thousands of years ago, I discovered a cultivation technique which could increase one’s cultivation base greatly and even absorb the powers of others for their own use. Today, you shall try this cultivation technique that I cultivated for thousands of years!”

Luo Qufeng’s face became twisted gradually, and his words stunned the guests.

No wonder Luo Qufeng’s skills skyrocketed! It was because he obtained fragments of the Second Domain’s cultivation technique thousands of years ago!

The might of the powerful figures in the Second Domain was truly astonishing.

In the next second, Luo Qufeng suddenly shouted coldly, and the red light around him instantly turned into an endless torrent that shot towards Ye Qingtang.

Every place that the red light passed by saw the ground shatter and slates crumble. Deafening roars pierced eardrums.

Under such a powerful might, everyone turned white. No one expected Luo Qufeng’s killing move would be as frightening as such mass destruction!

However… DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang did not move an inch and remained at the same spot. The smile on her exquisite face remained, and there was no sign of panic.

The moment the torrent reached her, she suddenly raised her hand and waved slightly. Her wide sleeves moved like the flutter of a butterfly and swept at that devouring energy instantly!

Greed filled Luo Qufeng’s eyes as though he could absorb the Holy Lord of Shadows’s formidable powers immediately.

However, in his eagerness, the flap of Ye Qingtang’s sleeves actually turned that destructive torrent into a stream of water before everyone’s eyes!

Right before it could touch Ye Qingtang’s sleeves, ripples of water could be heard, and glistening water spread across the ground.

Everyone was muddled for a moment.
