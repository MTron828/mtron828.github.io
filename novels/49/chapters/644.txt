Chapter 645: Demonic Force (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“It should be that thing.” The little white tiger’s eyes landed on that black ball.

“So that’s the case…” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes in thought.

The demonic force in that black ball was tremendous. The ordinary fierce beasts nearby had long been infected by the demonic air. This was probably what caused the anomaly to happen.

Roar!!

A loud sound came from nearby.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder looked in the direction of the sound, but the sight dumbfounded them.

A huge, black tiger whose body seemed to be dyed in ink slowly walked out from behind the black ball.

That black tiger’s body was unusually gigantic. It was at least over ten meters tall and was enough to cover the sky.

“F*ck…” The little white tiger’s expression changed drastically after seeing that black tiger. “It must have sensed my noble aura and wants to consume my flesh!”

Ye Qingtang was a little helpless after hearing the little white tiger.

That huge, black tiger was evidently influenced by the demonic air of the black ball, causing it to change. In Ye Qingtang’s opinion, the black tiger was probably an ordinary beast prior to this.

“Third Heaven of… Martial Qi Level Three… No… Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!” The Blood Moon Elder shuddered when he saw the extremely huge tiger before them.

Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord… This state was higher than the peak of the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. It was equivalent to having one foot stepped into the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state. Yet, people at that level were not a true Yin Yang Perfected Lord; thus, it was called half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Despite so, it was not to be trifled with!

“Run!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted loudly

Given their current skills, there was no way they could retaliate when they encountered a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Roar!!

As the black tiger roared, demonic air gushed out of its mouth. Then, its limbs moved, and it walked toward Ye Qingtang and the rest.

This is bad!

The Blood Moon Elder retreated backward instinctively.

Presently, the Blood Moon Elder had not reached the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three yet, and the black tiger which was a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord could rip him into pieces with just a claw. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The black tiger moved gradually as it sized up Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder interestingly as though these two humans were already rations in his stomach.

Ye Qingtang had a serious look. Given her current skills, she might not be able to defeat this black tiger either.

Then, the black tiger walked to the little white tiger, lowered its head immediately, and roared loudly.

A demonic wind rushed out of its mouth, and the little white tiger’s appearance resembled that of a lonely boat in a vast ocean.

“F*ck you!” As though it had received an extremely huge insult, the little white tiger roared furiously.

In the next second, the little white tiger’s body extended several meters and returned to the appearance it had when Ye Qingtang saw it for the first time.

The black tiger was stunned to see the little white tiger’s change.

However, just at this moment, the little white tiger leaped up and clawed at it.

“Hiss!”

The little white tiger leaped over ten meters and plucked out a big chunk of flesh from the black tiger’s abdomen immediately.

Right on the heels of that, the little white tiger bit the black tiger’s neck.

In an instant, large amounts of blood surged from the black tiger’s neck and dyed the icy lake into a shade of scarlet.

In at most ten breaths’ time, the black tiger which had a combat power of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord stage, however, had its throat ripped apart by the little white tiger and died.

Subsequently, the little white tiger opened its mouth wide and swallowed the black tiger’s body.

“How dare you useless trash insult me? F*ck you.” The little white tiger scoffed coldly as its body returned back to its infant-form once again.
