1404 Fuck You 3

The eight tribe leaders knew that the Holy Lord of Shadows was very powerful, but although they had followed her for many years, they did not know the depths of her powers. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Today, they had been shocked by the appearance of the golden dragon.

The Holy Lord of Shadows was also an Undead, but she even had the power to check part of the Undead Clan…

The Nether Fire Tribe Leader’s eyes narrowed slightly as he looked at the guard that had collapsed on the ground. The latter was mutilated beyond recognition by the continual devouring of the golden light. Suddenly, a huge black flame shot out from the tribe leader’s palm and tore the guard into pieces!

“Holy Lord, please do not be angry. I did not anticipate Hu Lun’s actions today. I only agreed to bring him here on account of his longing for the Holy Lord for the past thousands of years. I did not expect him to have evil intentions… It is my fault that the Holy Lord is displeased.” The Nether Fire Tribe Leader looked ashamed. Someone who did not know better might think he was innocent.

But Ye Qingtang was not stupid.

“Nether Fire Tribe Leader, is this the extent of your abilities? You cannot even control a guard. I’m afraid your days of being a tribe leader are at an end,” Ye Qingtang said with a cold laugh. She clenched her fists and forced herself to bear with the exhaustion of spending all her strength.

“Please, Holy Lord, forgive me,” said the Nether Fire Tribe Leader.

The commotion in the great hall had attracted Ming Wang and the others.

The moment Ming Wang stepped into the great hall and saw the Nether Fire Tribe Leader kneeling on the ground, pleading for mercy, then the Nether Fire Tribe guard that had been torn to pieces, and the Nether Fire on the ground that was slowly going out, a murderous intent flashed across his eyes.

The Nether Fire Tribe had dared to attack Ah Yao!

“Please, Holy Lord, don’t be angry. The Nether Fire Tribe Leader has been too lax and is indeed at fault. The Holy Lord may punish him, but we do have something important to report to the Holy Lord, which is why we are here today.” The other tribe leaders saw that the test had failed and trotted out the lines they had prepared earlier.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes slightly with a malicious expression on her face. The gaze of all the tribe leaders was cautiously fixed on her.

If Ye Qingtang was really the Holy Lord of Shadows, she would kill the Nether Fire Tribe Leader with a slap.

Too bad she was not and did not have the Holy Lord of Shadows’s ability.

At the moment, she did not have the power to kill the Nether Fire Tribe Leader.

“Speak,” Ye Qingtang said coldly. She seemed to deliberately ignore the Nether Fire Tribe Leader’s pleas for mercy and let him continue kneeling there without a chance to get up.

“It’s like this—when we came with the Holy Lord from the Second Domain to Central Mainland, which is in the First Domain, our Temple of Shadows was part of the Crimson League. But after the Holy Lord vanished, the Crimson League ejected the Temple of Shadows from the league. A few days ago, when we heard that the Holy Lord had returned, we especially sought news from the Crimson League. We wonder… if the Holy Lord can bring us back into the Crimson League.” The Goblin Tribe Leader spoke respectfully. He kept glancing at the Nether Fire Tribe Leader, who was kneeling on the ground.

Crimson League…

When Ye Qingtang heard these two words, her brain started to buzz!

The Second Domain had many large clans, so many that it exceeded that in Central Mainland by several hundred times.

These powerful clans formed leagues and morphed into huge entities in order to defend themselves against each other.

Their ferocity was such that no power in the First Domain could compare to them.

The Crimson League was one of these huge entities and was formed from a powerful alliance between the Undead Clan and many other clans.

Ye Qingtang had been to the Second Domain in her previous life, so she had naturally heard of the Crimson League.

Who would have thought…

The Temple of Shadows was part of the Crimson League?!
