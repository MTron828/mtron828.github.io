FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When Lei Yan was confined to the Leiting family compound, his only joy was making the other family clan youths play Illusion Beast Chess with him.

Soon enough, one of the players lost with a loud sigh. His face was grim as he tossed a small, intricate jade pendant over to his opponent. The winner kept the jade pendant with a smile and scanned the crowd.

“Who’s next?”

No one answered.

Lei Yan’s heart itched. “Let me try!”

He then sat down promptly.

The crowd looked at Lei Yan, who had settled into the seat. Their eyes fell on his Netherworld Academy uniform and a strange expression crossed their faces. The winner couldn’t resist smirking when he saw Lei Yan sitting opposite him.

“Buddy, Which academy are you from?”

Lei Yan was puzzled. Wasn’t his uniform clear enough?

“I am from the Netherworld Academy. What’s the matter?”

The winner chuckled. He leaned back a little.

“You want to play?”

“That’s right.” Lei Yan answered.

The winner looked at Lei Yan with amusement.

“Sorry, I am afraid you can’t.”

Lei Yan was taken aback.

The person continued. “We have rules regarding our Illusion Beast Chess games. If you wish to play, you need to offer the appropriate stakes.”

Lei Yan listened.

Stakes?

He immediately took out all his new purchases from his space ring.

“Which item do you want? Choose yourself.” Lei Yan spoke magnanimously.

But the teenagers from the other academies sniggered at his words. They sounded like they were laughing at a fool.

The person sitting opposite Lei Yan also laughed. “These lousy items of yours are not fit to use as stakes in this game.”

With that, he drew out the jade pendant he had won and waved it in front of Lei Yan.

“Do you know what this is?”

Lei Yan was unfamiliar with the pendant, but Ran Mo’s face shifted. He uncharacteristically charged forward and pulled Lei Yan to his feet.

“Let’s go.”

The person couldn’t resist smiling as he watched Lei Yan being dragged off by Ran Mo. Crossing his arms over his chest, he leaned back slightly and lifted his chin as he gazed at Lei Yan and the others.

“Your friend is right. It’s better that you leave. There are some stakes which are too high for your Netherworld Academy. Playing chess in Universe City is not something people like you can afford.”

The person’s words were extremely harsh. The faces of Qin Feng and the others darkened.

Rules were rules. If Lei Yan didn’t know of them, he could have just explained, but this person was full of scorn and ridicule. It was clear that he was trampling upon the reputation of the Netherworld Academy.

Ran Mo, who was dragging Lei Yan away, suddenly halted as he heard those insulting comments. For the first time, a sliver of displeasure flashed across that babyish face.

Spinning around suddenly, he turned and took out something from his space ring. In front of the scornful eyes of the crowd, he slapped the item into the stone table.

It was a small jade pendant, exactly the same as what the winner had.

“Little Mo Mo, you also have this item?” Lei Yan didn’t expect Ran Mo to also have this jade pendant.

The person narrowed his eyes at Ran Mo’s jade pendant. He sized up this exceptionally harmless-looking teenager.

“You are Wu Fengling’s disciple?”
