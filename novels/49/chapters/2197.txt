Chapter 2198: Identity (1)

They lowered their heads, looking at the elixirs. Lei Yan gave a surreptitious wink as he wanted Yun Chen to help say something.

However...

Yun Chen looked at Ye Qing in admiration, as though he idolized her.

Darn!

Another one who had gone crazy.

“Consume the elixir now and circulate your energy here for a day.” Ye Qingtang wasn’t sure whether the elixirs were suitable for them or not. She just refined the elixirs according to their individual needs and she needed to observe them after their consumption. If the elixirs worked for them, she could continue making the same ones for them in the future.

Without any hesitation, Jing Ze and Mu Ziying consumed the elixirs and sat cross-legged.

On the other hand, Nangong Lie and Lei Yan’s turn looked like they were about to cry. They poured the elixir onto their palms and had a miserable look on their face.

Nangong Lie suddenly had an idea. He tried to reuse an old antic by pretending he had a stomach ache. “Boss, my stomach is aching. I probably ate something bad, I’ll keep this and consume it later...”

Lei Yan, “...”.

Damn it, you’re using the same tactic? Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Lei Yan showed his contempt while making weird sounds, holding his stomach, and pretending to look ill.

“Boss, my stomach hurts too. I think that I might have eaten something bad too.”

Nangong Lie: “...”

There wasn’t anyone more shameless than him.

Ye Qingtang looked at the two brats with raised brows. “You ate something bad? Open your mouth, let me see if you’ve been poisoned.”

They opened their mouths, putting on awful expressions.

Right when they opened their mouths, Ye Qingtang lifted the hands they used to hold the elixirs.

Pow pow!

They were slapped by their own hands.

And the elixirs also went down their throats.

“...”

“...”

“Does it still hurt?” Ye Qing asked.

They shook their heads simultaneously.

“Sit cross-legged and circulate your energy now!” Ye Qing shouted.

With a shudder, they immediately sat on the floor.

Jing Ze and Mu Ziying had already started circulating their energy. They closed their eyes, isolating themselves from the rest of the world.

Since Nangong Lie and Lei Yan had consumed the elixirs and couldn’t throw them up, they could only start cultivating as well.

As Ye Qingtang watched them, four beams of silver light suddenly flew out of her fingertips, connecting to the back of their necks.

Yun Chen was stunned.

“Spirit Line?”

Yun Chen had a weak body. When he was a newborn, he had been determined to not be able to live past ten years old. To keep him alive, his family searched for the best doctors all over the world but they were still not able to change his fate.

It was only at last, his grandfather used his connections to find a sage of medicine to treat him.

Yun Chen was only eight at that time. He saw the sage release silver lights into his pressure points all over his body.

The Spirit Line was made from spirit energy. It could detect every little detail in the human body.

They needed to compress the spiritual energy until it was as thin as a spider web and have perfect precision, if not, it would cause dire consequences for both parties.

The sage used the Spirit Lines to save him, such that he could survive up until now.

Even now Yun Chen remembered that his grandfather once said there were not more than five people who could control the Spirit Line and all of them were legendary figures.

However...

How come Teacher Ye also knew how to use the Spirit Line?

Yun Chen’s brows furrowed while he looked at Ye Qing, and he couldn’t help but feel suspicious.

Who exactly was he?
