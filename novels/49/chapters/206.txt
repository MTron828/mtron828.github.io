Chapter 207: Spirit Root (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The preparation time for a sect mission was very short, and they had to set off the next morning.

When Ye Qingtang woke up, she saw that the silver wolf, which was hugged tightly by her, was looking at her with a numb expression.

Ye Qingtang was a little shocked.

But very quickly, Ye Qingtang returned to her senses and changed her clothes nimbly.

And that scene was on full display in front of a certain someone…

The silver wolf’s lips twitched slightly, and it instinctively looked away, although it acted to look at her carelessly.

Too skinny.

A little chubbier would be better.

Ye Qingtang did not even notice the silver wolf’s thoughts and took her things after changing. She patted the silver wolf’s head and said, “Wait for me to return obediently. I will ask Senior Brother Qin to help me feed you.”

After that, Ye Qingtang left the room without waiting for the silver wolf to react.

She did think of bringing the silver wolf on the mission with her, but because this mission was specially “prepared” for her, Ye Qingtang did not dare to risk bringing the silver wolf.

After leaving her dorm, Ye Qingtang only felt that her body was exceptionally light today and that the abdomen area where her spirit root was at was emitting a faint warmth. It was a very interesting feeling.

“Could it be that the spirit root is about to break through?” Ye Qingtang was very curious as well. She obviously felt that she still needed half a month’s time, but why was it that her spirit root had traces of a breakthrough after just one night of sleep?

Without thinking any more, Ye Qingtang immediately went to look for Qin Huan to ask him to look after the silver wolf on her behalf during this period of time. Afterward, she left the sect.

Outside the sect, many teams were already gathered. Some teams had already set off. Ye Qingtang saw Lin Long’s figure from a distance away and immediately walked in that direction.

“Senior Sister Lin.” Ye Qingtang greeted.

Lin Long nodded slightly, and her eyes stopped on Ye Qingtang for a while. She had a feeling that the aura around Ye Qingtang was a little different today, but she could not point out the difference at the moment.

Right at that instant, Ye Qingtang heard noisy footsteps and a sarcastic voice.

“Senior Brother Zhou, why must you bring a useless new disciple on this mission? I think that this group of new disciples don’t know anything at all. Even if we bring them, they will just be a burden. How about you rethink it?” A disciple who looked about twenty years old was beside Zhou Xuan, and he mumbled in dissatisfaction.

Zhou Xuan came right after. Other than the person who spoke just now, there was another disciple who was appointed this mission beside Zhou Xuan. Zhou Xuan’s eyes quickly landed on Ye Qingtang as though he completely did not notice what the junior brother beside him meant. He said with a smile, “She would require a certain amount of training as a new disciple anyway. Since we are senior brothers, we should take care of her. Moreover… this little junior sister’s spirit root is not good. If I don’t invite her, other new disciples might not be willing to go on a mission together with a red spirit root.”

“Red spirit root? It can’t be?!” Those two disciples were shocked when they heard the three words “red spirit root.”

A new disciple was already useless enough, and it turned out she was still a red spirit root? Was that not the same as a useless piece of trash?!

Zhou Xuan’s voice was neither loud nor soft, but it was enough for Ye Qingtang and Lin Long to hear clearly. When Zhou Xuan finished his sentence, he already appeared in front of Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled into a sneer. “Really… thank you for worrying, Senior Brother Zhou.”
