Chapter 271: The Contract (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Now…

The Elder’s mouth shivered. He bared with the pain and forced an ugly smile out.

“We can discuss… We can discuss. I’m willing to succumb to you and serve you.”

The Elder pledged his loyalty, but his eyes were evil. As long as he could escape, he would see what the girl could do to him then!

Ye Qingtang smiled as she heard his words.

“That’s right.” She chuckled and pulled out the sword slightly.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect stared at the sword that was slowly pulled out from his body. He concentrated all his energy and was ready to escape once Ye Qingtang pulled out the sword!

However…

The nervousness that was shown in his eyes was captured by Ye Qingtang. The instant when the sword was about to be pulled out, Ye Qingtang turned her hands and pushed downwards!

The sword was pierced back again!

The sharp pain immediately spread through his body, and the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect was full of cold sweat. His teeth trembled, and he stared at Ye Qingtang. When he met with Ye Qingtang’s complex sight, he instantly hid all the malice in his eyes.

“What is this for? I have succumbed to you right?” The Elder forced a smile.

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes slightly and smiled.

“You are right, but… to be safe, I think we should have a contract. Then, if you want to run away, I will not need to waste my energy to chase you back.”

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect cursed Ye Qingtang in his heart as he heard her ironic words. His eyes revealed his guilty conscience.

Ye Qingtang really predicted his intention.

However…

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect would not reveal his thought so easily. He smiled and said, “How will I run away when I can’t even beat you? You think too much.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Is it? You’re not wrong. But the contract serves as insurance right?” Ye Qingtang lifted her brows, but she showed a more splendid smile.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect cursed Ye Qingtang for being so cunning secretly, but he did not dare to say anything. Though he was still pinned to the ground, he was full of plans to escape. If the contract was completed, he would never be able to hurt Ye Qingtang anymore as he would be killed by the contract. Unless… he could kill her instantly so that it would not trigger the contract.

However, he could not achieve that based on his current situation.

Under the Elder’s desperate sight, Ye Qingtang lifted her hand and bit her fingertip. A drop of blood came out of her finger. She immediately touched the Elder’s blood moon at the glabella with the finger.

The Elder’s body trembled. The moment when the blood diffused into the skin, the contract was completed!

Ye Qingtang pulled out the sword after the contract was done.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect sat up when he regained his freedom, but he felt brain-dead.

He was forced to complete a contract with a sect disciple…

The thought of escaping was totally out of his mind now. His energy was greatly depleted during the fight previously, and the body that just recovered could not take it anymore. If he escaped now, the body would decay soon. Furthermore, he made a contract with Ye Qingtang. What difference would it make now if he escaped?
