Chapter 2508: Divine Concealment Reappears (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Although Ye Qingtang entered the Divine Concealment state, she was still extremely cautious. The power of the Deity Ocean was not inexhaustible. If the power was exhausted, the Divine Concealment Spell would disappear as well. There was no need to think about the consequences.

However, Ye Qingtang could not understand why the main body of the owner of the demon palm was still underground and did not appear yet. And why it refused to leave her alone. There was no deep grudge between them and they had never even met before.

Moreover, this great underground being had already been successfully revived by those elders. This meant that there was already enough nourishment, so there was no need to continue killing.

As such, Ye Qingtang could only think of one reason.

The mysterious underground being was probably an extremely bloodthirsty person when he was alive. Ye Qingtang had seen many bloodthirsty people in her previous life. They did not need any reason to take your life.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang retreated with the Blood Moon Elder and the big yellow dog in her Divine Concealment state.

However, when Ye Qingtang retreated, not only did the demon palm not follow her, it quickly retreated.

In the next second, the ground began to shake violently once again. It was as if doomsday had arrived, and a thunderous boom echoed across the sky.

“Holy Lady… Look!” The Blood Moon Elder pointed ahead in shock.

There was no need for the Blood Moon Elder to point it out. Ye Qingtang already saw the huge head breaking out of the ground. Following that, towering shoulders were revealed. The upper half of the body was like the sky, indomitable and the lower half was like a pillar supporting the sky. Compared to this, Ye Qingtang and the rest were like insignificant ants.

“This… this… this is… a Demon God?!” Blood Moon Elder stared at the majestic huge creature in front of him and lost his focus for a moment. Just the sight alone was extremely shocking to his heart.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder did not know what those elders resurrected, but regardless, the aura and pressure of this demon god-like existence was enough to suffocate them.

“Great Lord!”

Up in the air, several elders were extremely excited when they saw that the Demon God below had been completely resurrected. Their efforts had not been in vain. They had finally completed their mission and allowed their Great Lord to revive from the underground of the Wailing Well.

That Demon God’s eyes were suffused with a cold light, like the flames of the apocalypse. No one dared to look straight at it.

The demon god-like existence merely sized up the group of old men before looking away, as if he was deep in thought. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

After a long time, the body of the Demon God shrank rapidly as though it was growing backward. In about a dozen breaths’ time, the Demon God’s body had shrunk to about ten feet. Even so, it was still incomparably large. Ordinary people could not compare to it.

“Holy Lady, what exactly is that? This is too scary. I have never seen such a scary thing in my life.” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was feeling somewhat exasperated. How would she know what it was? But it did not look like any ordinary being. This group of elders had probably revived some incredible big shot.

Although the Demon God’s aura was extremely terrifying, his body seemed to be in a very weak state as he had just revived and had not reached his peak.

Even so, it was obvious that it could kill Ye Qingtang and the rest as easily as if it was crushing an ant..
