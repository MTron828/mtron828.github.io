Zhou Qu squatted at the corner of the cage. He stared at Qin Huan, who constantly looked outside, and said in a weird tone, “Qin Huan, don’t dream about it anymore. That is the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect. Ye Qingtang will never be qualified to be his opponent! She’ll definitely be dead when the Elder digs out her heart. She doesn’t even know her own ability. If she hid away, she would not have such consequences.”

Qin Huan turned his head and stared at Zhou Qu. If Dai Changming had not stopped him, he would have beaten Zhou Qu to death.

They belonged to the same sect, but Zhou Qu wanted Ye Qingtang to be dead all the time!

“Don’t waste your time worrying about her. You should think about how to escape now. When the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect finishes eating her heart, he will return to kill us again,” Zhou Qu said.

Qin Huan held his fists tightly.

“I was too nervous just now and forgot to crush the soft jade. The sect Elders should be nearby. It may not be too late if we crush the soft jade now,” Dai Changming said.

Qin Huan said coldly, “There’s no need for that. Junior Sister Ye had crushed the soft jade when we saw the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect. If the Elders are around, they should be on their way now.”

“What?” Dai Changming was stunned.

Ye Qingtang could still remain that calm at that kind of moment?

Zhou Qu’s eyes sparkled as he heard the news.

“She still has some use then. Luckily, she came to get killed so that she could buy us some time. Hope the Elders can reach us as soon as possible,” Zhou Qu said.

Everyone stared at him in rage. Qin Huan was about to kick his face. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

However…

The zombies suddenly moved. They opened the cage which Qin Huan and rest were in. They pulled the strongest Zhou Qu out of the corner.

Zhou Qu’s face was pale. He held the bars of the cage tightly, and cold sweat was flowing down his head.

“Senior Brother Dai! Help me! Help me!”

Dai Changming was stunned and wanted to reach for him instinctively. However, Qin Huan stopped him.

Qin Huan stood in front of Dai Changming and stared at Zhou Qu, whose face was totally pale. “Zhou Qu, you’re right. If you can buy us some time, we may survive. Thus… we will hand over the task to you.”

Qin Huan kicked Zhou Qu’s hands away from the bars, and Zhou Qu was pulled out by the zombies.

Dai Changming frowned but did not move anymore.

The other disciples who witnessed the scene surprisingly did not speak at all.

Zhou Qu hid at the back for the whole time. It was obvious that he wanted the rest to die first.

However, he never imagined that he would be the first one to die.

Zhou Qu cried and screamed. He was dragged away by the zombies towards the walls of Deer City through the dark path.

Zhou Qu struggled and screamed along the way. However, his arms were held tightly by the zombies. It was impossible for him to escape.

Zhou Qu was brought to the walls in a short while.

His whole body was soaked with cold sweat, and his legs were trembling.

When he lifted his eyes, he was shocked when he saw Ye Qingtang, who was standing a few steps away.

Ye Qingtang? She is not dead?!
