Zhou Xuan chuckled. “Of course. Since we are from the same sect, I will definitely be ‘worried’ about you.” A cold light thoughtlessly flashed across his eyes when he finished speaking.

However, the other two disciples became even more dissatisfied upon hearing Zhou Xuan’s words.

Sect missions were different from rewarded missions.

If rewarded missions were a failure, the disciples would lose some time at most and would not receive any other punishments.

However…

If it was a mission appointed by the sect, it had to be completed. Otherwise, the disciples would be reprimanded by the warden and punished correspondingly once they returned to the sect.

Thus, participating disciples were exceptionally meticulous when they were doing sect missions as they were feared that a failed mission would negatively affect themselves and the sect. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Those two disciples sized up Ye Qingtang. Apart from her beautiful face, they despised everything else about Ye Qingtang.

“Junior Sister Ye, it’s been a month since you entered the sect. Have you been cultivating hard? Are you familiar with the basics of the Xuantian swordplay already?” A disciple asked meanly. He did not care about Zhou Xuan’s reasons for adding this new disciple into the team and was only concerned about whether he could complete his mission.

The young girl before him looked weak and did not look like she had the ability to complete the mission. Even if such a person followed them, not putting in any effort was the greatest contribution already. If she was a hindrance in their investigation, it would really be a big problem.

How could Ye Qingtang not hear the harshness in the person’s words? She was very clear that all of this was intentionally created by Zhou Xuan.

These disciples may not know about Zhou Xuan’s objectives, but they hated her because of Zhou Xuan’s words. Even if she had an “accidental death” in the mission, these two disciples would probably not even ask about it.

Ye Qingtang sneered in her heart, and a sharp look flashed across her eyes as she looked at Zhou Xuan’s face of which he concealed his mocking expression.

“I am asking you a question, did you hear me? As a junior sister, how dare you ignore a senior brother’s question? Do you have any manners!” That disciple who did not hear Ye Qingtang’s reply immediately frowned unhappily and instinctively wanted to grab her shoulder.

A smile passed by Zhou Xuan’s eyes when he saw the disciple making things difficult for Ye Qingtang.

These two junior brothers were specially selected out from the outer sect by him. They had an arrogant and self-conceited nature. Even if he did not openly do anything to Ye Qingtang, Ye Qingtang would already be troubled just by the two’s verbal attacks.

However…

As that disciple stretched his hand out, Ye Qingtang suddenly looked up. Her eyes were obviously smiling, but the coldness in her eyes caused his hand to freeze in midair.

He did not know why either, but he felt as though he fell into an ice cellar when he was stared at by her.

“Senior brother, you’re caring too much.” Ye Qingtang scoffed.

“You…”

“If you don’t want to do the mission, then get lost quickly. Stop wasting time here.” Lin Long, who had remained silent all along, suddenly walked up to stand before Ye Qingtang and looked at the trouble-making disciples coldly.

That disciple saw Lin Long standing in front of him with a cold expression and was taken aback immediately. Fear flashed across his eyes as he said rather guiltily, “Senior… Senior Sister Lin…”
