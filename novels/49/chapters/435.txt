“Come back!” Ye Qingtang sprung up and held Fu Lingtian’s collar. She dragged him back to the ring directly.

“You…”

Blood flew out of Fu Lingtian’s mouth. Ye Qingtang really intended to kill him on the ring.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled into an evil smile. She murmured beside Fu Lingtian’s ear.

“I want you dead…”

…

Fu Lingtian was astonished. He could never imagine that Ye Qingtang would be so cruel to kill him!

He did not know the reason why Ye Qingtang wanted to do so, and he did not have enough time to figure out as Ye Qingtang’s move was about to land on him the next second.

Fu Lingtian was almost engulfed by the strong feeling of danger.

If he continued to suppress his ability at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One, he would not be able to fight with the disciple in front of him. Unless… he revealed his true power without holding back.

However…

If he used his full strength, the Yunxiao Sect might punish him heavily. If he chose not to, he might die here soon!

The moment Ye Qingtang’s move was about to lock him down, Fu Lingtian’s eyes sparkled, and there was no trace of fear left. His Martial Qi aura immediately reached the Second Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Two.

“You are seeking your own death!” Fu Lingtian’s face darkened as he shouted.

As he finished his words, his Martial Qi aura changed into unlimited primordial qi, and the power caused Ye Qingtang to be thrown out.

“Boom!”

Ye Qingtang struggled for about ten steps back until she stabilized herself.

“I’m going to kill you!”

Fu Lingtian was enraged. As a Yunxiao Sect disciple who reached the Second Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Two, his hand was fractured by a Xuanling Sect disciple, and he nearly lost his life! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Fu Lingtian smashed his palm down at Ye Qingtang. His Martial Qi was so intense that nothing could compare with it.

“Master, save me!”

Ye Qingtang shouted for help at Elder Mo.

However…

Before Ye Qingtang shouted, Elder Mo was prepared to take action against Fu Lingtian when he revealed his Martial Qi Level Two power.

“How dare you!”

Elder Mo shouted fiercely. His voice sounded like the thunder and seemed to be able to cause the entire world to tremble.

Before the audience could realize what was going on, Elder Mo flew onto the ring and protected Ye Qingtang.

At the same time, Elder Mo waved his palm

Boom!

Boom, boom!!

When the palm of Elder Mo reached Fu Lingtian’s palm, it seemed like two meteors hit each other.

As Fu Lingtian’s right hand was fractured by Ye Qingtang, his strength was not enough to counter Elder Mo’s attack. He backed off for a few steps.

“Master, he is at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two. He wanted to kill me!” Ye Qingtang’s face was full of ‘fear.’

Elder Mo’s face was extremely unpleasant.

“Don’t be afraid Qingtang, I will defend you now.”

Elder Mo’s cold eyes then scanned through the elders of the Qinglin Sect.

The Elders of the Qinglin Sect were totally shocked. The aura that Fu Lingtian just revealed was definitely at the level of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two.

“What’s going on?!”

“Fu Lingtian is at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two?”

“How can it be? The rules of the three sect competition say that only disciples at Martial Qi Level One can participate…”

“Martial Qi Level One?” One of the disciples sneered. “It was clear that he reached the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two just now. If Elder Mo did not help, Junior Sister Ye would die because of Fu Lingtian!”

“Is it possible that… the Qinglin Sect asked Fu Lingtian to suppress his Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two cultivation to the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One…”
