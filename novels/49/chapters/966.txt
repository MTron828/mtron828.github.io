Chapter 967 Another Incident (2)

Everyone from the Ye Family had been rejoicing, but when they saw the people from the Duan Family, their faces fell.

“Duan Luoning…” Second Elder frowned as he looked at the cold and arrogant man. His expression was rather grim.

Duan Luoning was the master’s nephew. He was the same age as the Duan Family’s eldest son, Duan Tianyun. The two of them had studied under the same master since young and cultivated together.

When Duan Tianyun returned to the Duan Family in Lin Town a year ago, Duan Luoning came with him.

Further, Duan Luoning’s ability had improved rapidly with the Long Family’s help.

Duan Luoning had not appeared the last time the Duan Family had come to make trouble.

Today, he had unexpectedly arrived at the Ye House.

“Was it you who injured someone from someone from my Duan Family just now?” Duan Luoning spoke coldly. His flinty gaze followed the direction in which the injured youth had pointed and looked towards Dan Yifan.

When Dan Yifan heard that, he smiled and said, “It was I. So what? Can it be that you want to carry on?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“You injured someone from my Duan Family. We cannot possibly let the matter rest,” said Duan Luoning coldly.

“Oh? What are you suggesting?” Dan Yifan raised his brows slightly.

“Since the Ye Family is unwilling to follow the rules, then tomorrow, our families will settle the matter with a match. If the Ye Family wins, the Duan Family will not pursue the matter. But if you lose… you have to follow the new rules,” said Duan Luoning.

“So be it. When was the Ye Family ever afraid?” Dan Yifan immediately agreed.

With that, Duan Luoning laughed coldly and led the others away from the Ye House.

The injured youth from the Duan Family only spoke when they had left the main gate of the Ye House.

“Elder Brother Duan… are we just going to let that fellow from the Ye Family get away with it?”

Duan Luoning said, “Get away with it? Dream on.”

“Then…”

“The Ye Family has always ignored the new rules. It is time that the Ye Family recognized this problem. In the arena tomorrow, the Duan Family will force the Ye Family to acknowledge that they have no more standing in Lin Town.” A cold look flashed across Duan Luoning’s eyes.

“I don’t just want the Ye Family to lose. I want them to completely lose their face in Lin Town. Many people in Lin Town will come to the match tomorrow. Then, we will use the Ye Family as a warning and let everyone in Lin Town see who calls the shots in here.”

After Duan Luoning spoke, everyone from the Duan Family immediately grasped what he

not say anything more. They only waited for the next day’s match to have a reckoning with the Ye Family.

In the Ye Family, everyone had different thoughts regarding the Duan Family’s challenge.

The Duan Family had previously acted arrogantly. Now that Dan Yifan had arrived at the Ye House, the Ye Family might not need to fear the Duan Family.

“Yifan, you will fight in tomorrow’s match.” The Great Elder looked at his grandson.

“Yes,” said Dan Yifan said graciously.

Then, the Great Elder looked at Ye Ling. “Why not let the younger members of the Ye Family attend tomorrow as well?”

“Very well.” Ye Ling nodded in agreement.

The younger members of the Ye Family had been oppressed by the Duan Family for some time. Now that Dan Yifan had arrived, they might as well use the next day’s match to regain some of the Ye Family’s prestige. It would also be a good opportunity to vindicate the younger members of the Ye Family, who had been oppressed by the Duan Family.

“Tang Tang, you should also go with us tomorrow.” Ye Ling turned to look at Ye Qingtang.

Although he did not say so explicitly, the truth was that he hoped Ye Qingtang could learn something from Dan Yifan. Perhaps, it would be of some help to her when she returned to the sect in the future.
