Chapter 1230 How Did I Put This On? 1

“Ah Yao, Ah Yao… I know I was wrong. I’ll listen to you, I’ll listen to you… If you want to keep him alive, we’ll keep him alive. I’ll obey you as long as you don’t leave…”

Ye Qingtang inwardly heaved a sigh of relief when she saw the child who was plastered to her kneel. She had been merely probing and was also looking for an excuse to leave the Temple of Shadows.

But it turned out that…

The notoriously savage Holy Son could not bear to be apart from the Holy Lord…

“Men, throw this smelly worm into the dungeon.” The child turned and ordered.

Now, Ye Qingtang could not leave even if she wanted to. She had no choice but to keep the situation as it was for the time being.

“Ah Yao, don’t be angry. You’ve been away for so long, so you must be tired. Go and rest.” The child spoke gingerly, seemingly terrified that Ye Qingtang would leave.

Although Ye Qingtang maintained an expressionless face, she was emotionally exhausted.

Heaven knew how much mental energy she had exhausted to put on a show in the Temple of Shadows, which had previously reigned supreme in Central Mainland.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

The child only slowly released Ye Qingtang when he saw that she had agreed.

Ye Qingtang stretched out her hand and picked up the little white tiger, who had been knocked aside and cuddled it.

When the child saw that little white tiger was in Ye Qingtang’s arms, his expression immediately turned murderous.

The little white tiger was alarmed by his glare.

F*ck, this little devil looks terrifying.

“I will escort the Holy Lord for a rest. Holy Lord’s sleeping chambers have been cleaned every day in anticipation of the Holy Lord’s return,” said Xue Fu.

Ye Qingtang nodded and walked towards her sleeping chambers with Xue Fu in the lead.

As Ye Qingtang walked, the child’s guarded expression immediately transformed. He turned to look at all the Undead in the main hall with a vicious and cruel expression.

“Now that Ah Yao is back, if I find out that anyone has made her unhappy…” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

A black flame suddenly burned in the child’s hand. As his fist closed, the black smoke instantly exploded.

The Undead were all silent and nodded repeatedly.

The Holy Lord was the supreme symbol of the Temple of Shadows, but it was the capricious and murderous Holy Son that everyone feared.

Ye Qingtang quickly arrived at the Holy Lord’s sleeping chambers. When she entered, it was as if she had suddenly returned to normal human dwellings.

The sleeping chamber was brightly lit with many lamps. Everything was clean and white. The entire atmosphere was completely incongruous compared to the dim Temple of Shadows.

One wall of the sleeping chamber was hung with many portraits. The portraits all looked similar yet different.

From emaciated to plump, the features of the person in the portrait had changed slowly from ugly and peculiar to beautiful. In the last portrait, the person looked exactly like Ye Qingtang.

“These must be the portraits of how the Holy Lord of Shadows slowly transformed from an Undead to a human…” Ye Qingtang slowly relaxed.

“F*ck, this Temple of Shadows is really terrifying. Did you see the last look that little devil shot at me? It was as if he wanted to skin me alive there and then. I think we better leave at the first opportunity. If your identity is revealed, we will both die here.” The little white tiger hopped out of Ye Qingtang’s arms.

The capricious Holy Son’s power was probably in the Heavenly Venerate realm, not to mention the guardians and elders of the Temple of Shadows.
