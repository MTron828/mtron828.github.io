Luo Sheng nodded as he agreed to the Vice President’s decision.

He was satisfied with Ye Qing’s unique understanding of martial arts foundations, but the youth wasn’t powerful enough and that worried him. He had to be careful when using him.

“Which students?” Luo Sheng asked.

The youth didn’t dare hide anything. He reported the few students that were pointed out by Di Nuo. Luo Sheng’s brows suddenly furrowed when he heard those names.

“Were they chosen by the Vice President?” Luo Sheng asked.

The youth replied, “The Vice President allowed Teacher Di Nuo to make the decision. They were chosen by Teacher Di Nuo.”

Luo Sheng’s brows furrowed even more. He could already sense that Di Nuo wasn’t too pleased with Ye Qing’s arrival.

“Got it. Get them to wait at the East Campus.” Luo Sheng waved his hand before he turned to Ye Qing. “I have some other matters to handle. Go to the East Campus first and meet the students... They may be a little weird, but since you’re only guiding them along for the foundation of their martial art, there shouldn’t be any problem.”

It was obvious that Luo Sheng didn’t feel confident saying those words.

Ye Qingtang watched as Luo Sheng spoke hesitantly. Hearing that those students were chosen by Di Nuo, she could already sense something was off.

She could sense that...

Teacher Di Nuo wasn’t going to give her any good students.

It didn’t matter anyway, so Ye Qingtang wasn’t bothered. She was confident in herself.

However, when she headed to the East Campus... She realized that she had underestimated Teacher Di Nuo. In a huge classroom, there were only a few students “seated”.

The classroom was spacious enough to accommodate a hundred students, but there were only six students in there. There were five males and one female, it seemed they were around 16 to 17 years old.

They were supposed to be students but looking at their demeanor...

“What the hell is this? When are they going to stop bothering us? I was asleep and they wanted me to come to this place?” A tall and handsome youth was obviously annoyed. He stepped on the table with one leg and behaved as though he was a king.

“T-The teachers wanted us to come so did...” A thin youth with a hunched back answered the tall youth. Terror was written all over his already pale face.

“Did I even ask you? Who are you to talk? Get lost! I’m disgusted just looking at your face. How the hell did you even enter the Netherworld Academy without a pure bloodline.” The tall youth didn’t give a damn and glared at the thin youth.

The thin youth was terrified. He took a few steps back, in fear that the tall youth would beat him.

“Young Master Lei Yan is acting like a big shot here. This isn’t the Martial Branch, none of your lackeys are here with you. You’d better behave yourself before you get punched. No one will help you when that happens.” A smiley youth warned the tall and arrogant youth. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Nangong Lie, is your skin itching?”

“My skin is not itching, but my fists are. Is Young Master Lei going to stop my itch?”

Lei Yan and Nangong Lie were almost going to start a fight and the thin youth was horrified, he went completely pale.

This was the scene Ye Qingtang witnessed once she stepped into the classroom. The corners of her mouth twitched and she didn’t say a thing. She merely proceeded to sit on a chair at the side.
