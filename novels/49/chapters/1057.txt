Chapter 1058 Traitor (1)

“The senior members of the Ye Family may pick any treasure from the Treasure Pavilion, with no conditions attached. If they are unsure of what to select, they can follow Old Zhou’s recommendations.” Ye Qingtang looked at the old man.

“Yang Lord, please don’t worry. I am very good with these matters,” the old man said repeatedly. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, the Ye Family Branch Masters and two Elders looked rather emotional. The Yunxiao Sect treasures were extremely attractive to them!

After they left the Treasure Pavilion, Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept across the air. Her lips immediately curved upwards and arched in a mysterious smile. Here was a fish that had escaped the net.

“Eldest Young Lady?”

Daoist Zijin was rather perplexed when he saw Ye Qingtang’s odd expression.

“Come out!”

Ye Qingtang shouted coldly as her right arm reached into the void and grasped at something

As everyone stared, an old man in a black robe was dragged out of the void.

“Who are you!” Elder Bai Kui immediately shouted sternly.

They had been completely unaware of this old man who was hiding in the void!

“Elder Qu, how are you?” Ye Qingtang smiled coldly as she fixed her gaze on the old man, who was frowning deeply.

Elder Qu was a Blood Moon Sect Elder, but after the sect was exterminated, he moved to the Yunxiao Sect and taught the Yunxiao Sect disciples the evil skill of robbing others of their spirit roots. When Ye Qingtang had been in the Yunxiao Sect, she had followed her teacher, Elder Mo, and the others to the Drifting Cloud Island and coincidentally met Elder Qu and Ye You. She had learned of Elder Qu’s status from the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

“Yang… Lord…”

Elder Qu stared at Ye Qingtang. This girl was so young but was already a Yang Lord…

A thousand years ago, Elder Qu had also been a Yang Lord. But unfortunately, a thousand years later, his level of attainment had dropped too rapidly, and now, he was only an ordinary Yin Lord.

“I am willing to serve you faithfully,” Elder Qu said to Ye Qingtang.

Elder Qu firmly believed that given his value, this Yang Lord would certainly give him an important position.

However, Ye Qingtang just laughed coldly. “I don’t need your faithful service. But you may leave your life here.”

Elder Qu laughed when he heard Ye Qingtang’s words. “Yang Lord, I know the Robbing Spirit Roots Skill. With me around, I can guarantee that the Yang Lord’s family will be elevated to the next level!”

When they heard that, all Ye Family members present were taken aback and even somewhat skeptical.

“Robbing Spirit Roots Skill… legend has it that one can indeed rob cultivators of their spirit roots and use them for oneself…” Daoist Zijin was shocked. This secret skill had long been lost in this mainland.

“Hmph!” Elder Bai Kui shouted angrily. “Who would have thought that the Yunxiao Sect would be so despicable as to do such evil things? The Robbing Spirit Roots Skill is equivalent to robbing others of their martial skills. It is a great crime!”

Elder Bai Kui’s fiancée had been snatched away by the Grand Elder of the YunXiao Sect, so he had a deep hatred of stealing, even if it was in terms of martial skills.

The skill of robbing spirit roots was somewhat similar to Ye Qingtang’s Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. However, when compared to the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, the Robbing Spirit Roots Skill was inferior.

The Robbing Spirit Roots Skill could be used to devour the spirit root of others. However, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Skill could devour anything in the world, from the spirit energy of a stone, to the martial skills and bloodline of a person.

“Robbing Spirit Root Skill…”

Daoist Zijin thought for a moment and then suddenly frowned.
