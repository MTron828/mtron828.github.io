Chapter 2042: Slaughter (2)

Ye Qingtang turned into a ray of light and black flames appeared in her palms the moment she hit the ground.

Within seconds the flames turned into a black sword. She swung it around the head of an Ancient You Clan warden and he collapsed to the ground.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, we’ll fight to the death with you!” Elder Mo roared as he raised his hands at her.

Quickly dogdging how blow, she hid her surprise. To think that his power was already at the Paragon Fifth Heavenly Venerate level?

She had her own plans and didn’t want to face off with Elder Mo right now. She flew over him and sliced another warden in two. An uneasy feeling grew from within as Elder Mo saw two people dying right in front of him.

The Holy Lord of Shadows’s power had long surpassed the Holy Venerate level. Even if the Elders worked together to fight her, it would be difficult. He had struck out in anger just now but now that he had calmed down, he was fearful of her powers.

Little did they know that...

Ye Qingtang’s current power was three levels lower than Elder Mo’s. But just her reputation was enough to make them hesitate.

On the other side of the battle, the two youths couldn’t hold out against Ming Di for long and were quickly squashed into meat pancakes.

Ming Di quickly flew over to Ye Qingtang, imposing as a mountain behind her. His shadow gave Elder Mo and the rest of them a great sense of oppression.

“I can give all of you one chance.” Ye Qingtang withdrew her flames and stared at the ashen-faced Elders.

“I’ll spare you if you can defeat Ming Di,” she said lightly.

They rejoiced when they heard that. Even though it was said that Ming Di’s strength was as great as the Holy Lord of Shadows, the pressure that the Holy Lord gave them was far greater.

Ye Qingtang’s words gave them a ray of hope. Even though they couldn’t defeat the Holy Lord of Shadows, they might have a chance against Ming Di.

They might stand a chance at winning.

Ye Qingtang secretly sighed with relief as she saw their reactions. She could probably defeat Elder Mo if she used all her strength but there was no way she could win against all of the Elders.

After all, she wasn’t the real Holy Lord of Shadows.

But Ming Di was the real thing.

She didn’t want to fight in front of so many alien race people from the Crimson League in case they saw through her. Furthermore, if Ming Di realized that she was a fake...

She would be doomed.

“Stop wasting time. Make sure to attack all at once!” Ming Di said, his blood boiling. Ever since the Crimson League joined them, he had had to divide his kills with them.

Over the past few battles, he hadn’t been able to kill to his satisfaction at all. He was going to kill as many as he liked today! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Elder Mo and the rest looked at each other and all rushed towards Ming Di.

With an almighty roar, Ming Di turned to face them.

The skies and earth were torn apart as the shockwaves rippled through the area. The entire canyon shook as boulders shattered and fell from the cliffs!
