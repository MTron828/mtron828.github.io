“What is Jiang Yanyun doing? Didn’t we already agree to play it safe?” Elder Kun was shocked.

Elder Qian frowned slightly but said, “Jiang Yanyun is quite powerful. We previously discussed the most conservative strategy,, butit would be better if he could win one of the previous top fighters and come in at a higher ranking.”

Just as Elder Kun was about to speak again, he saw Elder Baili walking over with a smile.

“Elder Qian, Elder Kun”

The hearts of Elder Qian and Elder Kun dropped when they saw Elder Baili, but they had their thoughts behind an indifferent front.

“Elder Baili.”

“I wonder if you know who Jiang Yanyun will challenge today?” Elder Baili smiled.

“No, we are not aware.”

Elder Baili continued. “What a coincidence. I heard rumors that two members of the Jiang Family will be challenging Xuanyun.”

Elder Qian was taken aback.

Two?

Looking at Jiang Shaobai, who had already joined the fighters going for the elimination format, Elder Qian felt momentarily puzzled. But he suddenly thought of Ye Qingtang, who had yet to appear.

Could it be that Ye Qingtang was also going to challenge Baili Xuanyun?

Surely it must be a joke, right?

“But that is expected. Xuanyun didn’t perform too well in the previous competition. Even though they have the courage to challenge, it is natural they will choose the fighter which they believe to have the highest chance against. They can’t possibly challenge Xi-er, right?”

His words were full of mockery.

Elder Qian and the others looked very unhappy. But they were rather confident of Jiang Yanyun’s abilities. Let’s see if Elder Baili could still smile when Jiang Yanyun defeated Baili Xuanyun.

As expected, Jiang Yanyun announced that he was going to challenge Baili Xuanyun when he stepped onto the arena.

In response, Baili Xuanyun leaped onto the arena and smirked at the cool-looking Jiang Yanyun.

“Jiang Yanyun, you sure have guts and I’m glad you kept your word. But unfortunately, not everyone in the Jiang family is as trustworthy as you. That Ye Qingtang... is she so scared that she didn’t dare to turn up?” Baili Xuanyun raised his brows slightly.

Jiang Yanyun said mildly, “This battle is between you and me. It doesn’t concern others.”

Baili Xuanyun smiled and continued. “Looks like you are very confident. I hope that you won’t lose too badly to me. After all... I heard that you are the top fighter in the Jiang family, so if you lose to me... I am afraid the Jiang family would lose all of its status in one hit.”

Jiang Yiran narrowed his eyes. It was impossible to not understand the provocation in Baili Xuanyun’s words. Him and all of the Jiang family youths gritted their teeth in anger.

“Baili Xuanyun, don’t be so cocky. Our Brother Yun will definitely beat you. You will be coming off that arena covered in shame.” Jiang Yiran was itching to rally his support for Jiang Yanyun.

A caustic smile appeared on Baili Xuanyun’s face, but he otherwise did not respond.

Soon enough, the battles would commence. In fights at this advanced level, neither fighter dared to make any rash moves.

Zhan Rao and the rest watched the two standing in the arena with keen interest.

“I heard that Jiang Yanyun is pretty good. I also noticed him in the previous fights. He does have some pretty good skills.”

“Jiang Yanyun is indeed quite good. He would definitely enter the top ten if he competed in the previous competition. But he has been too impulsive in challenging Baili Xuanyun this time...” Sang Feiyu chewed on her fingertips.

One could not overlook the fact that every single one of these top fighters from the previous competition had already experienced the mystic realm.
