Chapter 2082: Instant Kill (1)

“Roar!”

All of a sudden, a loud dragon’s roar ripped the sky apart. Mi was too exhausted to even deal with it but he suddenly spotted a huge figure that flew to attack the terrifying water dragon.

Stunned, Mi quickly lifted his eyes to look up.

All he could see was Ye Qingtang riding on Ming Di’s back. The water dragon started turning into water droplets that only glimmered under the sunlight.

Ye Qingtang was certain that if the Crimson League were to lose, the entire Temple of Shadows and Central Mainland would be taken away.

Little You Yun was once taken away right in front of her. She was never going to let history repeat itself.

Her foster father, her master...

She had to do anything and everything to make them come back to this world.

As Ye Qingtang scanned the Temple of Shadows’ Undead Clan and had a somewhat gentle gaze. Though she was forced into this role, it was undeniable that...

She kind of liked this damned Undead Clan.

Shui Mou hadn’t expected someone from the Crimson League to outdo the water dragon. She narrowed her eyes and tried to make another move, but was interrupted by Lu Zhiyao.

“Mo Yao, it’s been long.” Lu Zhiyao lifted his head, looking at Ye Qingtang, who rode on the demon dragon’s back.

Tears trickled down Ye Qingtang’s cheeks. She looked at Lu Zhiyao from above without any expression on her face.

He was one of the 12 sect custodians and it turned out he was acquainted with the Holy Lord of Shadows?

Ye Qingtang had no idea how many more secrets the Holy Lord of Shadows kept.

Lu Zhiyao clearly knew that it was the Holy Lord of Shadows so he didn’t allow Shui Mou to attack yet. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I heard that you came to the First Domain long ago. I didn’t expect us to be able to meet again. Great, we can have some closure today.” Lu Zhiyao had a sinister look on his face.

Ye Qingtang was shocked.

Darn!

So it turned out he had some bad blood with the Holy Lord of Shadows!

Lu Zhiyao suddenly transformed into a beam of light, flying up the sky to charge towards Ye Qingtang.

Smoke and fire erupted into the skies as Ming Di instantly breathed hot air in his direction.

Lu Zhiyao paused in the sky, holding a sharp sword to fight Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang was glad that she had Ming Di with her. When she was still thinking about it, Shui Mou flew up into the sky too.

“Let me deal with the demon dragon.” Shui Mou smiled as she prepared her moves. “I’ve got to give it to you for breaking down my water dragon earlier, but this time, I don’t think you can last that long.”

Ming Di’s eyes were filled with a murderous aura as he charged towards Shui Mou. Of course, Ming Di assumed the Holy Lord of Shadows wouldn’t need his help.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Calm down!

“Now there’s no one to interrupt us.” Lu Zhiyao glared at Ye Qingtang with a murderous look.

Chill!

Ye Qingtang looked at the murderous Lu Zhiyao and was filled with despair.

“Ah Yao!” Ming Gu saw the dangerous situation and flew up. Ming Wang also followed right behind.

Right as they were flying up, a few youths from the Ancient You Clan followed and interrupted them.

“Kill them.” The Ancient You Clan’s Clan Master ordered with a murderous look on his face.

Once he gave the orders, almost everyone from the Ancient You Clan moved. The groans from the Heavenly Wolf Sect’s war beasts were never-ending. The horn signals rang and the Heavenly Wolf Sect’s army charged forward.

It only took a moment and the Heavenly Wolf Sect’s army was in a chaotic skirmish to the death with the Crimson League’s army.
