Before Ye Qingtang returned to her senses, Ming Wang notified them of the information that the Ming Butterfly sent.

“Ling Yan offended the Ancient You Clan for some reason, and the Ancient You Clan is here to give him his payback.”

The Ancient You Clan is here for Ling Yan?

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback.

Perhaps others were unaware of how Ling Yan formed an enmity with the Ancient You Clan, but Ye Qingtang was more than clear.

Back when they were in the previous mainland, if not for Ling Yan, who secretly poisoned the water that Ancient You Clan drank and deteriorated their strength, that mainland would have been destroyed in a day. Even if they set their mind to warring with the Ancient You Clan, there might not even have been a chance to.

The Ancient You Clan must be here currently for that incident.

“Holy Lord, our Temple of Shadows and the Ancient You Clan have always minded our own business. The Ancient You Clan is here today because of their grudge with Ling Yan, and there’s no need to ask to interfere. We can leave as per our original plan,” Ming Wang looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

Although they did assist Ling Yan to ascend the throne, it was not worth it to go against the Ancient You Clan just over a tiny Eternal Dynasty.

Furthermore…

Since the Ancient You Clan was here to seek revenge on Ling Yan, even if Ling Yan died, they could just support another Emperor.

“Ah Yao, let’s return,” Ming Gu, who was glued to Ye Qingtang, said while blinking his eyes.

It was evident that the Temple of Shadows did not intend to interfere with this matter.

Ye Qingtang remained expressionless, but she was extremely anxious on the inside.

Ling Yan offended the Ancient You Clan in order to help her, so how could she abandon Ling Yan now?

Ye Qingtang accessed the situation swiftly. Looking at Ming Wang, who did not plan on meddling in this incident, she secretly took a deep breath, and her eyes darkened.

“Ming Wang, you are really regressing more and more as you live.”

Ye Qingtang’s tone had a few hints of coldness.

Ming Wang was slightly stunned.

Ye Qingtang snickered. “Since when did my Temple of Shadows have to keep a distance from the Ancient You Clan even if we crossed paths?” The moment she finished her sentence, her piercingly-cold eyes swept across Ming Wang.

Ming Wang froze and immediately responded. “Holy Lord, please simmer down.”

“Simmer down?” Ye Qingtang snickered. “I’ve only been away from the Temple of Shadows for a few thousand years, but I never thought that you all are reduced to this state. How dare you call yourself the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows with your cowardice?”

Ming Wang’s expression froze, and he narrowed his eyes uncontrollably.

Back in the Temple of Shadows’s peak, it was extremely impressive and had never paid attention to any other force.

Even the Ancient You Clan might keep a distance from the Temple of Shadows if they met them.

“Are you really scared of the Ancient You Clan?” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“It’s not that I am scared, but I feel that there is no need for this. Ling Yan is only a puppet for us to control the Eternal Dynasty. If we lose him, we can still supp…”

“Shut up.” Ye Qingtang immediately interrupted Ming Wang.

“One has to pay regard to the status of the dog’s master in beating the dog. What rights does the Ancient You Clan have to touch my man?”

“Noted.” Ming Wang was slightly startled.

This style was exactly like that of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang looked down at the flood beneath her.

“It’s merely the Ancient You Clan. I will pay them a visit.”

“Holy Lord…” Ming Wang still wanted to say something.
