Chapter 2727: Returning To Her Era (5)

“Holy Lady, of course. Although the current Great Immortal Temple cannot be compared to its glorious past and is being forced into a corner by the supreme faction Deity Realm, how can it be so easy to destroy it…? The Great Immortal Temple has many rare and precious treasures. It has a heaven-defying spirit animal, the Purgatory Demon King guarding it. Not only that, but it also has rare Destruction-level divine weapons and Dharma treasures. Although the Deity Realm is rumored to have a Perfected Immortal, it will not be easy for them to destroy an elite existence like the Great Immortal Temple which has an extremely strong foundation.”

“Deity Realm…” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She had not heard of them. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

As for the Purgatory Demon King and those Destruction-level divine weapons, Ye Qingtang knew that she had exchanged quite a number for her senior brothers and sisters in the high-tier ancient city in the Fourth Domain’s legacy realm.

Now, Ye Qingtang finally understood that history had indeed changed drastically because of her. This change would always exist and had replaced the earlier version of history…

Although Ye Qingtang did know that this was very likely, she was still extremely shocked to hear that it really happened.

She… Ye Yue… Saint Ye Yue of the Great Immortal Temple…

“It’s just a pity that Saint Ye Yue has been missing for tens of thousands of years. Those sages from the Great Immortal Temple once said that if Saint Ye Yue didn’t disappear, the Great Immortal Temple would never have declined to its current state… Actually, the main reason why the Great Immortal Temple declined was because of Lan Shan and Feng Wuyin’s betrayal.” The Blood Moon Elder sighed.

“Lan Shan and Feng Wuyin betrayed the Great Immortal Temple?!”

Ye Qingtang was stunned by this news.

How was that possible!

In the Great Immortal Temple, Ye Qingtang was closest to Lan Shan. Ye Qingtang knew him very well. It was impossible that he betrayed the Great Immortal Temple!

“That’s right. What kind of existence is that Feng Wuyin… I heard that Feng Wuyin was once a disciple of the Great Immortal Temple only because of Ye Yue. After Saint Ye Yue went missing, Feng Wuyin and his brother Feng Jiuyou left the Great Immortal Temple. Feng Wuyin then established the Deity Realm faction just to destroy the Great Immortal Temple,” the Blood Moon Elder sighed.

“Do you know why?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown.

“Holy Lady, how would I know? I am nobody…” The Blood Moon Elder said before continuing, “But there is one thing. Be it the Great Immortal Temple or the Deity Realm, they are all looking for the Demon God Han Cangming. These two major forces swore a vicious oath that they would skin the Demon God Han Cangming alive and destroy his soul so that he would die without even a burial place! ”

“Han Cangming?”

What did this have to do with Han Cangming?

“That’s right, Holy Lady. I heard that in the Fourth Domain legacy realm, it was Han Cangming who captured Saint Ye Yue. Therefore, the Great Immortal Temple and Deity Realm have been searching for Han Cangming. I heard that 50 years after Saint Ye Yue was kidnapped by Han Cangming, he appeared once. He was discovered by the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon who asked Han Cangming to hand over Saint Ye Yue. The battle between the two of them triggered the Great Immortal Temple. In the end, several sages from the Great Immortal Temple, who rarely left the temple, went to surround Han Cangming. But it seemed that Han Cangming received the news in advance and fled. After that, Han Cangming never reappeared and his existence is still a mystery,” the Blood Moon Elder said.

After hearing what the Blood Moon Elder said, Ye Qingtang was deep in thought.
