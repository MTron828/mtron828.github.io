Chapter 2712: Wealthy (3)

Xie Jun was holding a Heaven-level divine weapon and also wearing divine armor. However, there were scuff marks on it.

“Heh, thankfully, I obtained these treasures. Otherwise, I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to return,” said Xie Jun with a smile.

However, Xie Jun’s expression changed when saw that Lan Shan and the other disciples were all wearing divine armors. Furthermore, all of them had heaven-defying Dharma treasures and Heaven-level divine weapons.

“You all…”

Xie Jun looked surprised.

“Let’s not talk about us for now. What happened to you?” Lan Shan was puzzled.

“I went to investigate and followed a disciple of the Dragon Emperor Clan into an ancient city. In that ancient city, there were actually people selling divine weapons… there were also all kinds of unbelievable spirit pets… in fact, if a pet died, one could use cursed points to revive them in the shop… I saw a disciple of the Dragon Emperor Clan buy a Heaven-level divine weapon and divine armor. He was on his own so I ambushed him and snatched his treasures. In the end, I was nearly pursued by the other Dragon Emperor Clan disciples and nearly couldn’t return. Fortunately, this divine armor’s defense is astonishing, so they were helpless,” said Xie Jun.

Everyone smiled.

Why take such a huge risk to snatch something from others? They had everything and could take anything!

“By the way, there’s a ranking list for cursed points in the ancient city. Before I left, I saw that Junior Sister Ye Yue was ranked first… many disciples from the supreme factions seemed to have designs on Junior Sister Ye Yue. The rules are like this. You can snatch cursed points from another cultivator, but only if he or she is from another faction. For example, as long as Junior Sister Ye Yue is killed by a cultivator from another faction, her cursed points will be transferred to the person who killed her,” said Xie Jun.

“Did they reveal exactly how many cursed points I have?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown.

Xie Jun shook his head. “No.”

Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief. If the other factions knew exactly how many cursed points she had, she would probably be hunted down with no mercy. Even though she had already spent 10,000, she still had 290,000 left. That was enough to drive anyone crazy. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“By the way, there’s another especially important piece of news.” Xie Jun continued, “There’s a palace in that high-tier ancient city. I sneaked in and saw that it was selling a Paragon relic… Furthermore, there is only one!”

“The Paragon relic is for sale?!”

Everyone was astonished.

“It looks like everything here needs to be bought with cursed points, including the Paragon relic.” Wan Rong looked thoughtful.

“Senior Brother Xie Jun, how many cursed points does the Paragon Relic cost?” Ye Qingtang wondered if her remaining 290,000 was enough.

“100,000 cursed points.” Xie Jun said, “It’s too expensive. It’s probably very difficult to gather so many points. Therefore, no one was interested in that palace as no one managed to accumulate 100,000 curse points.”

Everyone turned to look at Ye Qingtang.

“We can buy three Paragon relics, but there is only one for sale. Don’t you think it’s infuriating?” Lan Shan commented.

“Three?” Xie Jun looked shocked. The price of a Paragon relic was 100,000 cursed points! Did they know what 100,000 cursed points meant?

There were many extremely powerful demons in this realm. He had risked his life to kill one and only got 40 cursed points for it. Not only that, he sustained heavy injuries from the ideal.
