Chapter 1301: Dangers Abound (3)

This was not a good time for Ling Yan to become the Crown Prince. Not only would the powers on the Eldest Prince’s side try to kill him, but the Second Princess would also be scheming all night to get rid of him.

Ling Yan faced not only his siblings but also the powers behind them.

The Sacred Ground of Reflection and the Temple of Shadows.

However…

Ye Qingtang somehow felt that Ling Yan was not as easy to deal with as everyone thought.

Ling Yan had the power of karma. Surely he could predict these things?

When Ye Qingtang thought about it, she realized she was being absurd. She could barely save herself. She certainly did not have the time and energy to worry about Ling Yan’s safety.

One should know that…

Dangers had abounded at today’s banquet.

Logically, Lady Ghost should have done something when Mo Yunxian had insulted her. But from start to finish, Lady Ghost had not acted at all.

Although this could be explained as Lady Ghost deliberately concealing Ye Qingtang’s status as the Holy Lord, Ye Qingtang also knew that Lady Ghost’s inaction served to further intensify the unhappiness between her and Mo Yunxian.

So that Ling Yan could tell who she really was more quickly.

Ye Qingtang had not forgotten Ming Wang’s plans.

Lady Ghost spoke to Ye Qingtang for a little longer before she left. Although he was reluctant, Ye Qingtang also persuaded Ming Gu to return to his room. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang only heaved a sigh of relief after they left.

Ling Yan was currently in an unpleasant situation, but so was she.

Ming Wang had placed Lady Ghost by her side as a watchdog. She needed to exercise extreme caution at every moment.

She might inwardly be filled with grievances, but she still had to adopt the air of the Holy Lord. She had suffered enough.

Ye Qingtang just wanted to sleep, but the conversation between the Eldest Prince and Lady Ghost kept surfacing in her mind. She involuntarily took out the voice transmission stone. She hesitated for a moment, then activated it.

“Ling Yan.”

“Mhm?” Ling Yan slightly indolent voice sounded from the voice transmission stone.

“What are you doing?” asked Ye Qingtang.

“Waiting for you.” Ling Yan’s voice held the hint of a smile.

“…” Ye Qingtang suddenly had the impulse to fling the voice transmission stone aside. But she quickly recovered and said seriously, “Don’t talk rubbish. I haven’t settled accounts with you for your fiancée’s actions today.”

“And how would Miss Ye like to settle them? I’ll do whatever you wish,” Ling Yan said with a laugh.

Ye Qingtang felt that if she continued to wrangle with him, she would end up digressing. So she stopped beating around the bush and spoke bluntly.

“Since you have helped me so much, I will warn you out of the kindness of my heart that your eldest brother is going to expedite investigations into your circumstances. I guess that your eldest brother or older sisters will be doing their utmost to kill you. You’d better watch out.”

He still had the mood to tease her in these circumstances.

The moment Ye Qingtang finished speaking, Ling Yan’s melodious laughter emerged from the voice transmission stone. His good mood was apparent just from his tone.

“So Miss Ye is so concerned about me…”

“…” She should not have contacted him. She should have just let him die.

“Their intention to kill me is not new. If they had that kind of ability, I would not have survived until today. Miss Ye does not need to worry,” Ling Yan said gently.

“Who’s worried. I’m just reminding you.” Ye Qingtang muttered.
