Chapter 1921: Ming Di (3)

Behind the stone door lay a vast space.

If not for the fact that she had walked so deeply underground before reaching this place, she would never have imagined that such a vast space could be under her feet.

She had originally thought that the Holy Lord of Shadows had sealed Ming Di away because she was not happy with it but after looking at this vast space that it was sealed in, Ye Qingtang felt that the Holy Lord of Shadows may not have hated Ming Di after all.

Why else would she have made the place Ming Di was sealed in so vast?

After walking some distance in darkness, she heard a deep breath. Soon after, a huge gust of air blew at Ye Qingtang’s hair and clothes.

“Why have you come here?” A deep voice reverberated in her ears like thunder. Almost subconsciously, she turned to face the source of the voice, her eardrums throbbing.

In the blurry darkness, she could vaguely make out a pair of glowing red eyes staring at her.

Ye Qingtang glanced at those eyes.

A huge, dragon-like shape occupied the darkness in front of her.

“Mo Yao, when are you planning to seal me here until?” the huge dragon asked in a low, incensed voice. It had been sealed for over ten thousand years in this dark place. Enough was enough.

Mo Yao?

Startled, Ye Qingtang recalled how Ming Gu had addressed the Holy Lord of Shadows. He had called her Ah Yao...

Was Mo Yao the Holy Lord of Shadows’s real name?

Ye Qingtang’s mind was racing. She looked at the giant figure half-hidden in the darkness and steeled her nerves.

“Ming Di.”

The huge dragon scoffed coldly. Danger filled its red eyes as its eyes narrowed.

She must have angered it.

Looking at its reaction, it was obvious that Ming Di harbored great unhappiness towards the Holy Lord of Shadows. But... Ye Qingtang had rushed over because she wanted to know more about Ming Di’s strength...

As well as the feelings between the Holy Lord of Shadows and Ming Di.

She wanted to know if Ming Di’s strength was as terrifying as she had heard.

There was no need for it to stay by the Holy Lord of Shadows’ side at all. It could have left as soon as they had a conflict and did not have to stay to argue with her.

Ye Qingtang felt like... Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The feelings between the Holy Lord of Shadows and Ming Di were more complicated than people thought.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes turned regretful as she thought of this.

“Ming Di, I was wrong.”

When Ming Di heard Ye Qingtang’s apology, it froze. The smoldering rage it had been feeling all these years seemed unable to assimilate the unexpected words that had come out of her lips.

“What do you mean?”

Pinching her thigh, Ye Qingtang made her expression even more somber as she lifted her eyes to look at Ming Di. “I used to think that I was right but now, after ten thousand years, I’ve come to realize that you were right after all.”

Ming Di was stunned.

Did it hear correctly?

“You said that I was right?” Ming Di looked utterly flummoxed at her revelation.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

The savagery in Ming Di’s eyes faded as it calmed down. Then surprisingly, it narrowed its eyes, and its expression seemed to be a combination of mirth and something akin to smugness.

“Mo Yao, you finally understand! You see, I was the one who was correct in the end. What do you mean by advancing gradually and those bullsh*t strategies? In the face of overwhelming power, all that is useless! You’ve finally wisened up!”
