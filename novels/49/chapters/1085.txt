Chapter 1086 Is It A Pity? (1)

“Is it a pity…”

Divine King Luo Xue closed his eyes, but his lips tugged up slightly into a heart-wrenching smile.

….

Ten thousand years ago, between the clouds and mountains, the flowers were in full bloom. There were vibrant blooms, chirping of birds, natural wind, and fluffy clouds at the mountain ranges.

A man in snow-white clothes with outstanding looks was walking.

“You are Divine King Luo Xue… I am You Yun from the Central Mainland. I like you.”

It was as though that lady walked out from a painting; she was so beautiful that one could not bear to touch her.

Divine King Luo Xue’s heart raced as he looked at that alluring face.

Many seasons later, the lady became a respected goddess of the people, and together with Divine King Luo Xue, they led the masses toward a brighter future.

However, years later, the lady’s divine powers were slowly bled dry.

As the lady’s divine powers were exhausted, the world was filled with abomination.

The ancient people smashed the lady’s statue, destroyed the temple, and tainted the faith with resentment; it was a dark era.

“I want her heart.”

In the temple, Divine King Luo Xue wielded the Regicide Sky Blade and killed the ancient people like a madman, making them pay with their lives.

However, in the end, a few elite family clan powerful figures appeared and joined forces to suppress Divine King Luo Xue.

“I want her heart. I want her heart…” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ultimately, Divine King Luo Xue seemed to gave in and became a puppet without emotions in front of the millions of powerful figures. After swallowing the lady’s heart, he left the temple and disappeared for ten thousand years.

“Yun…”

Suddenly, Divine King Luo Xue opened his eyes, and a surge of white-colored divine power emerged in his eyes and rushed into the clouds.

In Ye Qingtang’s disbelief, an extraordinarily stunning lady appeared in the form of a virtual image. She stood beside Divine King Luo Xue protectively with an elegant smile on her face.

“Yun…”

Divine King Luo Xue used all his energy to touch the lady, but his palm passed through her body. It was mystifying.

Ye Qingtang looked at that perfect lady, perplexed.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang finally understood everything that the Regicide Sky Blade and Divine King Luo Xue were talking about.

That lady… should be the extraordinary lady from ten thousand years ago.

Ten thousand years ago, she once adored Divine King Luo Xue and was willing to remain on this mainland for him.

Divine King Luo Xue did not hesitate to bear the countless sins and conceal his identity for ten thousand years, just to leave this mainland with her heart and revive her once again.

Ten thousand years elapsed quickly…

In these ten thousand years, Divine King Luo Xue clung onto that last trace of hope and lived with the company of loneliness.

As for that extraordinary lady, even after she died, her obsession with her loved one was also hidden deep in her heart.

When Divine King Luo Xue encountered a calamity today, the obsession transformed into the appearance of that extraordinary lady when she was alive and appeared here to protect the most important person in her life…

As the lady waved her hand, the blood-colored lightning exploded and vanished without a trace.

“I am You Yun… from Central Mainland… Divine King Luo Xue, I like you.”The lady looked at Divine King Luo Xue as she continuously repeated the words she said when they first met.

“Yun…”

Divine King Luo Xue trembled. A strong man was, however, no longer able to bear the pain as he sobbed softly.

The scene from ten thousand years ago seemed to replay once again.

After the extraordinary lady died back then, Divine King Luo Xue brought her heart to a small tree, and no one knew the location of it.

Once the little tree grew into a tall tree of a towering multitude, Divine King Luo Xue’s jet-black hair had already turned white.

He remained under the tree for thirty years.

Without knowledge of what year it was.
