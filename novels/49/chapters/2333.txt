Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Meanwhile, Di Nuo noticed the immobile Yun Chen and his eyes filled with joy. He looked forward to the moment when he could see Ye Qing crawl out of the Netherworld Academy!

“Boss, what happened to Yun Chen? Why is he not moving?!” Lei Yan had been brimming with confidence but he was feeling a little panicky now.

Why was Yun Chen not moving?

At least go get the ingredients first!

Ye Qingtang remained silent. She only continued to watch Yun Chen with a calm expression. By this stage, most of the candidates had already prepared the ingredients and were starting the refinement process.

At this moment, everyone finally realized there was something amiss with Yun Chen.

“He doesn’t have any tripod? What’s going on? Could he have forgotten to bring it?” Someone noticed the empty space around Yun Chen. It was completely different from the other candidates who each had their own tripod beside them.

How would one refine elixirs without a tripod?

Yun Chen finally went over to gather the ingredients to start the prep work.

His speed was far slower than an average person’s.

“Boss, did you forget to prepare a tripod for Yun Chen? Should Nangong Lie and I go and bring one over for him?

Ye Qingtang shot Lei Yan a look.

“While we were in the Evil Soul Forest, when have you ever seen me or Yun Chen use a tripod?”

Lei Yan was stunned.

Jing Ze suddenly recalled something.

He vaguely remembered that Ye Qing usually taught Yun Chen elixir refinement late at night. By then, the rest of them were all dead tired and sleeping like pigs. Once, he happened to wake up in the middle of the night and saw Ye Qing and Yun Chen with fires on their palms.

Could it be…

“Boss, don’t tell me…” Jing Ze looked at Ye Qing with a strange expression.

Ye Qing smiled but remained silent.

At this moment, a sudden cry rang out.

“Quick, look! What is Yun Chen using to refine his elixir?”

The crowd thought that with Yun Chen’s slow speed, everyone else would have finished refining their elixirs before he even completed the prep work. In the end, his preparation speed had been astonishing. In the blink of an eye, all his ingredients were already properly prepared.

And just as everyone had lost interest in him, an intense flame was ignited upon his palm. He placed all the ingredients into his palm.

That flame engulfed all the ingredients… Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What… what is this? He’s not using a tripod, but using… his hand? Are you kidding me?”

Everyone was bewildered.

In their knowledge, alchemists always used tripods to refine elixirs. This was the first time they were seeing someone refine elixirs using a flame from their palm!

At this point, even Zhu Ning was shocked.

“Palm flame… How did he… how did he learn this?” Zhu Ning was utterly stunned. His earlier arrogant manner disappeared.

Zhu Ning was obsessed with alchemy and had studied countless ancient records. He had once read about a special elixir-refinement method which made use of a palm flame in place of a tripod.

With this method, one could better control every parameter of the elixir-refinement process. Using this special technique, the elixir quality and success rate would far surpass that of the usual method using a tripod.

Even a divine-level tripod would not be able to produce such results.

The palm flame was the dream technique that all alchemists aspired towards.

However, the palm flame method had already been lost over time. Zhu Ning had searched for a hundred years but failed to find any more information on it.

Zhu Ning never imagined that he would be able to witness the palm flame method in his lifetime. And… it was being executed by Yun Chen, whom he had completely disregarded!

Impossible.

The palm flame technique was a lost legacy. How did Yun Chen manage to learn it?

Zhu Ning’s expression shifted.. He instinctively turned to look at Ye Qing.
