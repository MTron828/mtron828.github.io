After Ye You was brought away by the Jiang Family, Ye Qingtang never saw her again. Yet, unexpectedly, she actually met her here.

However, since Ye Qingtang was almost completely blocked by Beidou Demon Lord, Ye You and Ye Xun did not notice Ye Qingtang’s presence.

After Ye You was brought back by the Jiang Family, the life she led in the Jiang Family was much more affluent than in the First Mainland. The Jiang Family was the Domain Monarch, and it had an advantage whether in cultivation conditions or any other aspects. However, in such a short time apart, Ye Qingtang realized that Ye You’s skills had already reached Arcane Supremacy Ninth Heaven!

The Jiang Family’s foundation was indeed strong.

Ye Qingtang observed Ye You and Ye Xun secretly and scoffed coldly.

From what Ye Xun said just now, Ye You’s objective for coming here seemed to be for the Bone of the Dragon breath as well.

“So what if he has his eyes on the same item? In this Central Mainland, how many people can fight over anything with you, Sister You?” Ye Xun said smilingly as she spoke of Ye You highly.

Ye Xun had been following Ye You’s side ever since she left Lin Town. With her intelligence, she gained Ye You’s satisfaction and was brought along to the Central Mainland by Ye You.

Ye You had an aloof and indifferent expression as she lifted her chin slightly, which revealed her arrogance.

She once thought that Yunxiao Sect was a massive force, but it could not even hold a finger to the Jiang Family of the Central Mainland.

“If you obtained this Bone of the Dragon Breath, your attributes will definitely enhance. I heard that the Bone of the Dragon Breath is also effective for improving the spirit root.” Ye Xun beamed.

Ye You narrowed her eyes. Back then, she snatched the spirit root from Ye Qingtang’s body, which allowed her to become the direct disciple of Yunxiao Sect’s Sect Master. However, she had a startling discovery after coming to the Second Domain.

The spirit root was no longer as important in the Central Mainland.

The spirit energy in the Central Mainland was extremely rich, and spirit roots of any grade would receive extremely great benefits from such rich spirit energy.

Only people in the backward First Mainland cared so much about spirit roots.

Despite this, it was still helpful.

Ye You naturally paid more attention to the Bone of the Dragon Breath after hearing that it could enhance one’s attributes and even improve the spirit root.

Since she entered the Jiang Family, she was naturally unwilling to be ordinary for her entire life.

Ye You and Ye Xun conversed for a moment, but since they were not too far away, Ye Qingtang heard everything they said.

“It seems that quite a few people have their eyes on the Bone of the Dragon Breath.” Beidou Demon Lord grabbed his head, seeming to be calculating if he brought enough money to win the Bone of the Dragon Breath.

Ye Qingtang took a look at the Beidou Demon Lord, and a smile emerged in her eyes.

The auction began very quickly.

It was the first time Ye Qingtang participated in an auction in the Central Mainland. The auctioned items were valuable treasures, and anyone of them was a treasure that the entire mainland would fight to lay their hands on.

Ye You auctioned for a few items, and most of them were mainly for nourishing her attributes. Evidently, she was desperate to increase her attributes.

Ye Qingtang was extremely calm when she looked at these treasures.

Although they were good, they were not very attractive to Ye Qingtang, who just came out of the Temple of Shadows.

In the entire Central Mainland, how many forces could compare their reserves of treasures to the Temple of Shadows?
