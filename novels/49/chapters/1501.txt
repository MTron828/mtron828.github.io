Chapter 1502 Treasures 2

The Beast Master was still in shock after finding the Eternity Bottle. A white-haired elder, who came along with the lady in green, picked up a ring from a pile of diamonds.

This ring was not made of silver or gold. There was a diamond that glimmered in seven colors of light on the ring. The radiances were splendid and attractive.

“Master, this is...” The lady in green took a glimpse at the ring and looked towards the elder with confusion.

“It’s the Moon Goddess Ring.” A smile emerged in the elder’s eyes.

According to the legend, the Moon Goddess Ring contained a trace of the Moon Goddess’s power before she passed away. Normal people could not even imagine what power from a Goddess contained. If this power was released, it could destroy any mainland in the First Domain.

If someone decided to wear the ring, they would be nurtured under the power of the Moon Goddess during cultivation. The effect of that was obvious.

The elder wore the ring on his finger under the gaze of the lady in green, but he did not realize that a strange look flashed across her eyes.

Besides the Beast Master and the elder from the Second Domain, many people found other long lost Dharma treasures from a few thousand to tens of thousands of years ago.

The big demon of the Frosty Snow Mountains had lived for at least ten thousand years. It had taken an incredible amount of treasure in its lifetime.

After seeing the treasure the big demon owned, Ye Qingtang understood the reason why people from different forces all rushed here. She scanned through the crowd in front of her and was shocked by what she saw.

Besides those who were chased by the big demon, there were many more powerful figures appearing in the hall. There were even people from the Second Domain.

Out of all those people, Ye Qingtang was attracted by a tiny figure.

There was a pretty little girl who was about five to six years old. She had round and big eyes and was dressed in a lilac dress that made her seem more adorable.

There were many women following behind the little girl. The women all wore the same type of mask to cover their faces, and they all followed silently behind the girl.

It felt a little strange that a little girl would appear here with the rest of the malicious forces.

No one would expect there to be any link between the girl and any group here based on her tiny arms and legs.

However, no one dared to provoke the innocent little girl.

Celestial Fairy from the purple palace. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Qingtang recognized the girl’s identity.

The purple palace was the most powerful force in the Second Domain. Even though she appeared to be only five or six, the Celestial Fairy was more than ten thousand years old. Having cultivated a group of heretical techniques when she was young, she was affected by that process and could not grow anymore.

The purple palace was involved in the battle between the powerful figures from the Second Domain and the Central Mainland, so they were famous in the Central Mainland now.

Ye Qingtang looked away and was taken aback by the number of powerful figures here. The little white tiger suddenly jumped out of her arms and seemed to be smelling something. Its round and tiny body dashed into a pile of treasure.

Fiendcelestial Beasts had a better sense of smell and were more sensitive to Dharma artifacts. Ye Qingtang followed the little white tiger secretly while everyone else was digging for treasures.
