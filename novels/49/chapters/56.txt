Chapter 57: Conspiracy (3)

Upon receiving the full impact of that fatal blow, blood spewed from the Second Elder’s mouth and in the next instant, he was pinned down by his opponents as he became disoriented from the damage.

“Second Elder of the Ye household. You’ve committed a heinous crime against humanity and in accordance to the decree of the noble Houses, I hereby sentence you to death.” The Great Elder approached the Second Elder whilst he remained pinned to the ground, and with hardened eyes that exuded scorn and ruthlessness, he delivered his judgment.

“You’re the treacherous one trying to usurp the authority of our House! Your persecutions against your Family Head and fellow Elders will not go unpunished! Our ancestors will never forgive you!” The Second Elder had realized, by now, that what transpired today was all part of the Great Elder’s atrocious scheme.

He had long caught on to the Great Elder’s treachery, but unfortunately, he could not be indicted without evidence.

And the Great Elder managed to find the chance to exploit his negligence.

Alas, it was all too late!

“That’s none of your concern because from now on, you’re no longer a member of our House. Repent on your sins in front of our ancestors!” A cold and vicious gleam flashed from his eyes as the Great Elder brandished a blade and with one powerful thrust, he drove it towards the Second Elder’s head!

While being hindered by Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun, Ye Ling could only watch in despair at the cruel scene that had unfolded before him!

However…

Just before the blade could reach, a streak of light flashed before everyone’s eyes.

A sudden force, which accompanied the light, knocked the blade directly out of the Great Elder’s hands!

“Stop right there!”

A female voice rang distinctly in everyone’s ears.

The voice attracted everyone’s attention, including Ye Xun and Duan Tianrao who were still embroiled in a grapple against Ye Ling.

But before the couple could catch a glimpse of the owner of that voice, a shadow fleeted amongst them, sweeping them off their feet via a single boot to their ankles!

“Who dares ambush the noble houses of Ye and Duans! Show yourself!” The Great Elder bellowed his warning.

The shadow stopped beside Ye Ling, and it was only till then that everyone could finally determine its appearance.

“So? Serves them right for being impertinent towards the Head of our household. Sparring their lives is already showing them mercy.” Ye Qingtang revealed her presence as she stood beside Ye Ling, glaring down on the others with a cold-eyed stare.

Everyone was stunned for a moment when they realized the intruder was Ye Qingtang. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Duan Tianrao remained stupefied even after getting back up on his feet. But his cause was more of being dazzled by Ye Qingtang’s mesmerizing beauty.

While donned in a scarlet dress, her voluminous ebony curls cascaded over her shoulders and flowed along with the winds, accentuating her already impeccable facial features, and this feast for the eyes enthralled Duan Tianrao in an instant.

In her race against time, Ye Qingtang had forgotten to wear her usual face veil.

And while rushing all the way to her destination, her flustered face actually served as a lustrous makeup that enhanced her appearance when compared to her debut on the stage for the rites.

“Tang Tang!” Ye Ling was astounded for a moment when she made her sudden appearance.

Ye Qingtang reined her anger in, only after ensuring Ye Ling was unharmed.

Never would she expect Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun to raise their hands against her father.

“Ye Qingtang! How dare you raise your hand against us!” The Elders from the Duan household were obviously displeased. Since Ye Qingtang was no longer Duan Tianrao’s fiancé, injuring him in the presence of those Elders was akin to belittling their family name
