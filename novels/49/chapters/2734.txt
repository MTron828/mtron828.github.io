Chapter 2735: The Second Tian (6)

“So you are the second Tian… Misfortune?” Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog.

“Why? Is there something wrong with that?” The big yellow dog shook its tail. “It’s all Shi Tian’s fault. He used that bullshit Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to absorb most of my Heavenly Dao energy. Otherwise, how could he have become Tian… that damned Karma Bloodline, that damned Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline… 10,000 years ago, Shi Tian’s term was about to end. I planned to give him a fatal blow and take revenge, but I was tricked by the Karma Bloodline Clan. They said that I was too violent and unsuitable to become Tian again.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

It really did not seem suitable…

“No wonder you refused to say anything that day and even lied to me, claiming that there were restrictions in the lower realm.” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“I didn’t lie to you. Everything about the upper realm is regulated by rules established by Shi Tian after he became Tian. It’s a rule set by him that the people in the lower realm are not allowed to know about the upper realm,” the big yellow dog said.

“But you just told me everything,” Ye Qingtang said in confusion.

“Things are different now. The power of the Heavenly Dao in your body is sufficient. The laws of the lower realm cannot do anything to you,” explained the big yellow dog.

Ye Qingtang was still doubtful of the big yellow dog’s words. However, whether it was true or false, what did the upper realm matter to her?

“Little girl, now that you know the truth, will you not bring me to the upper realm?” The big yellow dog looked a little anxious.

“Don’t worry. Even if you cause chaos in the upper realm, it has nothing to do with me.” Ye Qingtang shrugged.

With that, Ye Qingtang grabbed the big yellow dog and charged into the sky, disappearing without a trace.

Layer after layer of clouds. It looked as though they were at the end of the world.

“Is this the upper realm?”

After an unknown period of time, Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback as she looked at the huge lifeless city.

“How could this be…”

The yellow dog’s expression changed. “The spirit energy in the upper realm has completely vanished… Wait…”

The yellow dog surveyed the area with its divine power for a long time. “There are no living beings here… This…” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What happened?” Ye Qingtang asked in surprise.

“The upper realm has been destroyed.” The big yellow dog’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

“Huh?” Ye Qingtang was surprised. The upper realm was so powerful. How could it be destroyed?!

“I don’t know what happened either. All the spirit energy in the upper realm has been extracted. Furthermore, I can sense… the remnant souls of Perfected Immortals… there must have been a great battle in the upper realm and they were completely wiped out…” The big yellow dog seemed to be in deep thought.

“We shouldn’t linger here. Let’s go back now!” The big yellow dog said anxiously.

Ye Qingtang did not dare to delay. She immediately disappeared with the big yellow dog and returned to the lower realm.

...

After returning to the lower realm, Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog and asked, “What happened?”

“If I’m not wrong, someone wanted to become the next Tian. He must have extracted all the spiritual energy in the upper realm and killed all the Perfected Immortals there. He then absorbed their Heavenly Dao power.” The big yellow dog seemed to be in deep thought. “To become Tian, the most important condition is to have sufficient Heavenly Dao power.

“Little girl, you must absorb all the Heavenly Dao energy from your heart as soon as possible. Otherwise, I’m afraid you will become a new target,” the big yellow dog said to Ye Qingtang.

“Aren’t you Misfortune, the second Tian, who commits all kinds of crimes? You actually care about me?” Ye Qingtang teased the big yellow dog.

“That was in the past…” The yellow dog glanced at Ye Qingtang.” I wanted to return to the upper realm to seek revenge on the Karma Bloodline Clan. It seems that there’s no need for that now.”
