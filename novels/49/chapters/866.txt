Chapter 867 Midnight Whisper RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

It was years later when Ye You was brought back by the Jiang family in her previous life. However, the Dimension Wall was destroyed earlier as a result of Ye Qingtang, and the Jiang family managed to sense the Jiang bloodline in Ye You’s body.

Ye Qingtang’s original plan was to take her revenge before Ye You was brought back by the Jiang family. However, the best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry; man proposes, god disposes. She was still a step late…

The reason why Ye You could reach the Paragon Great Empress was closely related to the Jiang family’s nurturing.

“You know Ye You as well, Senior Sister Ye?” Li Bingxue asked curiously.

“I was just asking,” Ye Qingtang smiled and said.

Li Bingxue nodded and did not think much about it.

Soon, midnight arrived.

Ye Qingtang sat on the ground and entered a state of meditation.

“Miss Ye.”

Ling Yan voice was suddenly heard.

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes almost instantly and sized up her surroundings.

“I’m in your pocket,” Ling Yan said.

Ye Qingtang took out the Supreme Token from her pocket, and Ling Yan’s voice came from the token.

“I installed a voice transmission stone into the Supreme Token,” Ling Yan said.

Ye Qingtang was totally not surprised by such a trick.

“It’s quite late now. What do you need?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“My teacher intends to kill you now.” Ling Yan’s voice came out from the token.

“And then?” Ye Qingtang felt triggered about that. She would not have been involved in so much trouble if it not because of Ling Yan.

“Kill him,” Ling Yan said.

“Your Highness, are you joking with me? Or tell me, what’s the cultivation level of your teacher?” Ye Qingtang frowned and said.

“The second stage of the Arcane Supremacy, Divine Arcane Supremacy.” Ling Yan replied.

Ye Qingtang almost threw the Supreme Token away when she heard that.

There would be two stages when a cultivator reached the Arcane Supremacy.

The first stage was the Virtual Arcane Supremacy.

The second stage was the Divine Arcane Supremacy.

Every stage was divided into five Heavens. People at the Virtual Arcane Supremacy had to reach the Fifth Heaven to strive towards the Divine Arcane Supremacy.

Though Gu Tianhe, Li Bingxue, and Feng Wudang were at the Arcane Supremacy level, all of them were still at the first stage, Virtual Arcane Supremacy. However, Ling Yan’s teacher had reached the Divine Arcane Supremacy.

The difference between the two was the same as the difference between the Yin Lord and the Yang Lord of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord level. Nothing was comparable.

“Are you scared, Miss Ye?” Ling Yan’s laughter came from the Supreme Token.

“Scared? Why will I be scared? I shall prepare myself to be killed when he comes.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“

“You’re angry with me, Miss Ye,” Ling Yan said.

“At least you’re smart,” Ye Qingtang said.

Ye Qingtang had no relationship with Ling Yan’s teacher. However, he intended to kill her now because of Ling Yan. How was it possible for her not to be angry?

“Don’t worry too much, Miss Ye. This piece of mainland limits the ability of Arcane Supremacy. Even my teacher’s ability is limited to the Sixth Heaven of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Furthermore, you have three disciples at Arcane Supremacy with you. Why do you need to be scared?” Ling Yan said.

“You’re asking them to die for me?” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“Why would I be bothered with others’ lives? I only need you to be safe, and that’s enough for me.” Ling Yan smiled and said.

Before Ye Qingtang could reply, Ling Yan added. “If that doesn’t work, you can use your Spirit Ring to kill him.”
