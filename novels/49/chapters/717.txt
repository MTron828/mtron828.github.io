Ye Qingtang did not have time to waste here. Furthermore, the Falling Sky Valley’s assessment was very complex. There would be more trouble if she had to go through the assessment.

Ye Qingtang said immediately, “I’m very determined today. May I know whether I can enter first…”

Xiong Feng frowned slightly. However, before he could say anything, Ye Qingtang suddenly took out a pair of boxing gloves.

The gloves were made of unknown material, but it was shining under the light, making it extremely eye-catching.

Xiong Feng opened his eyes wide as he saw the gloves.

“Scorching Sun Gloves?!” Xiong Feng recognized the gloves instantly.

The Scorching Sun Gloves were made of pure gold, an extremely rare material. Even the Falling Sky Valley might only have a few weapons made of that.

The Scorching Sun Gloves would take half a year for forging masters. The price one had to pay a blacksmith would be unimaginable, not mentioning the price of the pure gold.

Xiong Feng had seen one of the Tiangang Sect elders wearing the Scorching Sun Gloves before. His fist was able to break mountains and overturn rivers. The power was insane. He longed for that all the time. However, the Scorching Sun Gloves were priceless. Even if he had the money, he would not be able to find one. Furthermore… he did not have that amount of money…

Xiong Feng’s sight was immediately fixed on that pair of Scorching Sun Gloves.

Xiong Feng’s reaction was totally captured by Ye Qingtang. A smile flashed across her eyes, and she handed the gloves over to Xiong Feng.

“I have heard that your Eight Direction fist techniques are outstanding. As people say, heroes must be paired with the best swords. I think this pair of Scorching Sun Gloves match with your fist techniques well.” Ye Qingtang smiled and said.

Xiong Feng held the pair of Scorching Sun Gloves, and his heartbeat accelerated. He thought that the Luyuan Pill that Ye Chen gave him was precious enough; however… he even had the Scorching Sun Gloves for him.

“This… This is inappropriate…” Xiong Feng held the Scorching Sun Gloves tightly, but he was still being polite on his words.

“The Scorching Sun Gloves are only suitable for a strong person like you. If they fall into normal people’s hands, their potential will not be expressed as well.” Ye Qingtang threw out a lot of pretty words that made Xiong Feng feel contended.

The Luyuan Pill and the Scorching Sun Gloves were precious, but Ye Qingtang did not feel pity for them at all.

She acquired these things from the disciples’ corpses in the Hell of Avicinaraka. Besides these two, she still had many precious things from all the sects in her space ring.

Ye Qingtang really gained a lot from the Hell of Avicinaraka. People would be surprised by any few that Ye Qingtang took out.

“Then I’ll accept them.” Xiong Feng smiled and said. He kept the Scorching Sun Gloves, and his sight was getting ‘gentler’.

“Young Brother, I see that you are in a rush. I will help you to ask the elders in the valley. If you have the ability, it should not be a problem for you to enter early.” Xiong Feng was easily convinced after receiving such heavy presents. Furthermore… he guessed that Ye Chen came from some renowned family clan. If not, he would not be able to offer such treasures like the Luyuan Pill and the Scorching Sun Gloves.
