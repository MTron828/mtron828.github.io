Chapter 2102: Floating Island (2)

There were many talented children but not all of them would grow up to show as much potential as they had. Whether they could enter the Temple of Paragon or not depended on their ability as an adult.

“I’m sorry, I don’t think... you should be telling all of this to a stranger.” Ye Qingtang interrupted Elder Hua.

She emphasized the word ‘stranger’.

After all, she had no interest in the matters of the Temple of Paragon. The more Elder Hua told her, the more she wanted to cover her ears.

The children on these floating islands could all have their memories wiped and sent back to where they were if they weren’t good enough.

And what about her?

She didn’t want her memories to be wiped.

Elder Hua was stunned by her bluntness for a moment before smiling slightly.

“I’m sorry, I forgot for a moment. Please don’t see yourself as an outsider. The view on this island is beautiful so you can walk around by yourself for a while. I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll take my leave first.” With that, Elder Hua leaped into the air and left the floating island.

She left Ye Qingtang standing alone where she was. Ye Qingtang was speechless as she gazed at the vanishing Elder Hua.

Don’t see herself as an outsider?

No thank you!

She would continue treating herself as an outsider.

It wasn’t difficult to guess that Elder Hua thought she was the reincarnation of their Holy Lord, which was why her words and actions were so suggestive...

But Ye Qingtang couldn’t stand it.

How many times did she have to say that she wasn’t the reincarnation of their Holy Lord?

Was it appropriate for Elder Hua to leave an outsider somewhere they were building their power?

Was she being generous or was it because the difference in their power was so great that Elder Hua could do whatever she wanted?

Ye Qingtang sighed. She wanted nothing more than to take this chance to escape this place but there was a feeling holding her back.

Elder Hua must have only put her here if she wasn’t afraid that she would escape. For all she knew, Elder Hua was waiting for her to return.

So in the end, Ye Qingtang could only accept her fate for now.

She would continue staying with them.

With nothing else to do, she walked around the floating island. Like Elder Hua had said, there were a group of children on the island, the biggest of them not even coming up to her chest.

Many of them weren’t even up to her waist.

She loved children. No matter how complicated and dirty the world got, in their eyes, everything was pure and clean.

Having experienced a lifetime of turmoil, the children made her relax.

After walking around the island, she sat down on a stone beside the pond. Resting her chin on one hand, she started thinking of how she could assuage their suspicions that she was the Holy Lord. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Just when she was deep in thought a loud sound blasted in her ear.

A strong stream of air followed the sound.

She lifted her eyes to take a look. A short distance away from her, a little winged child was floating in midair, both hands hanging by his belly with his fingers arched and he tried to raise his dantian level.

The sound she had heard was from the release of his energy.

His face was filled with intense concentration as he continued to stimulate the power of his dantian. But right at the most important moment, he kept releasing the power.
