Chapter 620: Little White Tiger (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I saw that you did not put in all your might either. How about we battle again? What do you think?” Ye Qingtang asked the little white tiger.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang did not have any intention to leave, the little white tiger put on an act. “Mhm, I accept this suggestion of yours… However, I suddenly recalled that I haven’t killed all of those people from earlier on. Wait here and not move… Once I’ve killed all of them, I’ll come… come and find you again.”

Afterward, the little white tiger turned around and wanted to leave.

After noticing the situation, Ye Qingtang took a step forward and stopped the little white tiger. Although this little white tiger did not have much combat power anymore, it was, after all, a Fiendcelestial Beast. If it grew in the future, even a Godfiend had to avoid it. How would Ye Qingtang let it go so easily?

“Move away! You’re blocking my way!” The little white tiger looked up at Ye Qingtang and said with a trace of childishness in its tone.

“Yes, I’ll block your way. What do you wish to do?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were full of smiles.

“You dare to block my way?!” The little white tiger scoffed. “Then I’ll take another route!”

Afterward, the little white tiger indeed passed by Ye Qingtang and strutted away.

The Blood Moon Elder’s lips twitched at the sight. This… was completely an insult to the reputation of Fiendcelestial Beasts.

Since ancient times, millions of beings retreated away once Fiendcelestial Beasts were out. Even those who were crowned as Godfiends had to avoid the Fiendcelestial Beasts.

However, the Fiendcelestial Beast before them completely insulted the name of Fiendcelestial Beasts… What humiliation!

What about the prior imposing manner?

Or the previous mighty air it had?

Humiliation!!

Before the little white tiger could walk any further, it was grabbed by Ye Qingtang and hugged in her arms. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“F*ck you. Let me go, you lowly chap!” The little white tiger struggled crazily with its legs in the air in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“If you dare to curse at me again, I’ll slap your mouth.” Ye Qingtang threatened.

“You despicable and idiotic human, I’m a Fiendcelestial Beast… Fiendcelestial Beast! Even if its an exceedingly powerful human, he also has to stay away and give way to a Fiendcelestial Beast. Are you even clear of what a Fiendcelestial Beast is? Aren’t you afraid of me?!” The little white tiger shouted angrily.

“What you said is the case for an adult Fiendcelestial Beast. However, you’re merely an infant. Why should I be afraid of you?” Ye Qingtang touched the little white tiger’s red nose and smiled.

“Ow… Stop touching my nose. I’ll fight it out with you!” Then, the little white tiger slapped its three-fingers large paws on Ye Qingtang’s wrist.

“Are… you serious…” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little as she looked at the little white tiger. The force of that slap was really too small…

“F*ck you. I still have something urgent to settle. Put me down and apologize to me! Then you can leave. Otherwise, you’ll suffer the consequences!” The little white tiger threatened.

“I wonder what the consequences are.” Ye Qingtang pinched the little white tiger’s little cherry nose again.

“Ow…” The little white tiger roared childishly. “I still have a hidden trump card!”

“Oh… use it then,” Ye Qingtang said.

“I… I… I have a kind heart and am unwilling to slaughter. You must not force me… I’m doing this for your good. You must know how to appreciate favors. Your life should be prioritized no matter what,” the little white tiger said in an earnest tone.

“Oh, there’s no need. Just use it. If I’m killed by your hidden trump card, it’s because I’m not skilled enough. It has nothing to do with you,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.
