Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Sheng Qianyu, show me the proof that the White Sage is yours.” There were a few tall teenagers who stood in front of the young man. They stared at the pale young man arrogantly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Sheng Qianyu held his fist tightly and said, “The White Sage was mine. I found it at the Sea Moon Bay.”

“What a joke! We got the White Sage at the Sea Moon Bay on a mission. How come it becomes yours now? What? Is it because you belong to the Admirable Sky Peak and your Peak Master now takes over the position as the Valley Master temporarily so you can say anything you want?” The few teenagers smiled coldly.

Sheng Qianyu raged, and his body trembled. He pointed at the teenagers and said, ” Don’t you dare to defile the Valley Master! How is this related to him? The White Sage belonged to me! You took it over before you returned to the valley.”

Ye Qingtang and Yan Shu walked into the crowd and heard them quarreling.

Sheng Qianyu was a normal disciple of Admirable Sky Peak. He got a White Sage by chance when he was out a few days ago at the Sea Moon Bay. However, just when he picked up the White Sage, he ran into the disciples of the Blue Cloud Peak. The few disciples noticed that Sheng Qianyu was alone. The White Sage was a rare find, and they then asked to take a look.

Sheng Qianyu did not contemplate as they were both the Falling Sky Valley disciples. However, the moment they got their hands on the White Sage, they ran away with it.

Now, all of them were back to the Falling Sky Valley. Sheng Qianyu rushed over to ask for it back.

However, the Blue Cloud Peak disciples did not admit that at all. They claimed that they found the White Sage and that it was totally not related to Sheng Qianyu.

“The Senior Brothers of the Blue Cloud Peak are reasonable. Sheng Qianyu, you said that the White Sage is yours? How did it end up in their hands when it’s yours? Are you trying to fabricate a charge against them as you want the precious White Sage to yourself?” One of the disciples from the other peak in the audience smiled and stared at Sheng Qianyu, whose face was pale.

“I gave it to them as they wanted to take a look…” Sheng Qianyu explained in a hurry.

However, no one cared about his explanation. Everyone looked at him sneeringly.

Ye Qingtang witnessed the whole thing coldly and sneered in her heart.

She met Sheng Qianyu in her previous life. He was talented but very weak. She really believed that the White Sage was fooled over by the people from the Blue Cloud Peak.

Based on Sheng Qianyu’s temper, he could never lie to others.

If such things happened under other peaks, the wardens of the respective peaks would be invited over for justice. However, it happened to an Admirable Sky Peak disciple, and the situation was different now.

After the Perfected Xuanchen took over the position as the Valley Master, he noticed other Peak Masters’ discontentment. In order to meet the old Valley Master’s expectations and maintain the harmony in the valley, he warned all disciples of the Admirable Sky Peak to prevent trouble.

If they had any conflicts with other peaks, they had to forbear with them.

That was the reason why disciples of other peaks dared to create trouble under their Peak Masters’ hints. It was a norm to bully disciples of the Admirable Sky Peak.
