Qin Xuan smiled. He wanted to say something else but a wailing teenager suddenly charged out from a nearby forest. The top half of his body was bare and flushed red.

“Nangong Lie, I curse you and all your ancestors!” A frantic Lei Yan charged onto the main pathway.

The bare top half of his body was covered in bruises.

Those marks were not deep, just superficial scratches. However, there were many of them, densely covering his entire back and arms. It looked rather startling.

“Lei Yan, it’s useless for you to curse me. Boss instructed me to do this. One hundred lashes a day. Just endure it. Don’t worry, I’m going very light on you, you won’t suffer any internal injuries.” Nangong Lie chased after Lei Yan with a whip. Now and then, he would lash out at Lei Yan’s body, making loud smacking noises.

The two brats charged forward, one chasing after the other. Lei Yan desperately wished to kill Nangong Lie and all his ancestors. But his eyes suddenly hardened and he came to a screeching halt.

He nearly collided with Qin Feng.

“Qin Feng!” Lei Yan saw the guy who was the cause of his misery over the past few days. He also noticed his grim expression, as if he would be lifting his hand to punch someone any moment now. Lei Yan instinctively took a step back as he stared vigilantly at Qin Feng.

“Qin Feng, we already agreed to fight again in ten days. We still have five days to go. You cannot attack me before that.”

Lei Yan had been cultivating the sealed energy technique and his head was already bloated. After being lashed and chased by Nangong Lie, it was not his fault that his mind was now frazzled and filled with a constant buzzing. He instinctively thought that Qin Feng was here to beat him up.

Nangong Lie also halted on seeing Qin Feng.

Meanwhile, Qin Xuan had overheard everything that Lei Yan just said.

“Oh? Brother Feng, you’re going to duel with Lei Yan?” Qin Xuan laughed. Lei Yan was notorious in the Netherworld Academy.

Qin Feng frowned. He looked at the madcap Lei Yan with eyes filled with disdain.

“It’s not a duel! I just need to endure ten moves from Qin Feng. Our Boss said so. If he can defeat me within ten moves, our Boss will leave him alone in the future.” Lei Yan spoke in a daze. He had no intention of dueling with Qin Feng for real.

He still wanted to live. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I see.” Qin Xuan spoke in a meaningful tone. He looked at Qin Feng’s back profile. “Brother Feng, I know you look down on the new teacher. But it’s just a pity... that Faculty Head Gu no longer wishes to teach you. I feel that... you should just obediently comply with the academy’s arrangements. After all... apart from the new teacher, who else would be willing to teach a student whose cultivation level is set on declining?”

Qin Xuan’s words were like a hammer, smashing down on Qin Feng’s chest.

Yes, he was right...

Since Qin Feng’s powers declined, none of the teachers wanted to be implicated by his problem. All the teachers cared about was producing outstanding students so that they could bring glory upon themselves. At the very least, even if they couldn’t produce exceptional students, they would still want to maintain their status quo.

But Qin Feng was different. No matter how much effort they put into teaching him, Qin Feng’s cultivation level continued to drop. This would only be a blemish on a teacher’s reputation.

As time passed, all the teachers in the Netherworld Academy started to ignore Qin Feng. Even when he was sitting in class, all the teachers would subconsciously forget about his presence.

In the eyes of all the teachers, Qin Feng was now like a plague to be avoided at all costs.
