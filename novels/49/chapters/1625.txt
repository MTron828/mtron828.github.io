Chapter 1626: Mission Countdown (7)

The Supreme League Kingdom had fewer soldiers, but they had Ye Qingtang and could defeat the army’s most powerful protectors.

Under Ye Qingtang’s leadership, the Supreme League Kingdom army easily swept aside all resistance and destroyed one allied army camp after another. Wherever they went, the allied forces would flee in disarray. Their only wish was that they were born with a few more legs.

As the allied troops were routed, the Supreme League Kingdom’s power grew.

Utterly terrified, the countries could not consolidate their strength. All of them sought to preserve themselves, so the alliance died in all but name.

The Supreme League King advanced towards his goal of uniting this mainland.

As they won again and again, the King’s cruel and domineering side became increasingly apparent.

Each time they captured a Kingdom’s capital, the King would order everyone in the kingdom to be killed.

It was a massacre. Not a single soul was left alive, be it nobles or commoners...

Ye Qingtang was cultivating in her room when there was a sudden knocking on her door. She arose to open the door and saw Joseph standing outside.

Joseph and the others had idolized Ye Qingtang ever since she beat the dozen Kingdom Protectors. The Kingdom Knights, who had despised Ye Qingtang, now became her fans.

At that moment, Joseph’s expression was extremely ugly. He was also dead white.

“Lord Protector... please... plead His Majesty!” Joseph suddenly kneeled before Ye Qingtang. His voice shook.

“What’s going on?” Ye Qingtang sensed that something was amiss with Joseph.

Joseph raised his head. His bloodshot eyes were filled with helplessness and despair.

“His Majesty has ordered us to slaughter everyone in the Hughes Kingdom, even the commoners. When General Ronald tried to dissuade His Majesty, His Majesty had them beheaded... Lord Protector, I know that the Hughes Kingdom betrayed our Supreme League Kingdom, but... the commoners are innocent...”

The Hughes Kingdom was originally allied with the Supreme League Kingdom, but when the Supreme League Kingdom began to struggle, the Hughes Kingdom chose to throw their lot in with the alliance. They even sold their Kingdom Protector to the Monza King for two million soldiers.

Because of that, the Supreme League King decided to carry out this shocking act of tyranny when he conquered the Hughes Kingdom.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She was only involved in the fighting and seldom interfered with the affairs of the Supreme League Kingdom. However, she did not expect the Supreme League King to give such a sadistic order.

It was the King of Hughes who had betrayed the Supreme League Kingdom. What did it have to do with the commoners who were just getting on with their lives?

Ye Qingtang did not speak, but she brushed past Joseph and hurried to the great hall.

When Joseph saw Ye Qingtang heading for the great hall, a ray of hope rose in his heart, and he hurriedly followed.

At that moment, the great hall was filled with the strong scent of blood. The Supreme League King had just cut off the heads of General Ronald and the others who had tried to stop the massacre. The floor of the great hall was sticky with blood. Everyone was ashen, and their hands shook as they tried to wipe the blood stains away.

The King on his throne showed no sign of pity.

The great hall was flanked by two ministers, who were pale and unnerved. They did not dare to say a word.

Amidst this dead silence, Ye Qingtang strode through the entrance.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
