Chapter 514 Blood Moon Guardian (3)

“B’Ilsh*t.” Ye Qingtang shouted. “Do I still need you to restate the Holy Lord’s divine power?”

Blood Demon was extremely nervous after being shouted at by Ye Qingtang and said cautiously, “Guardian is right… I was being long-winded… In this period of time before the Sect Master resurrects… our division here has already expanded to thousands of members. Although it cannot be compared to when we were at our peak, it’s still quite alright…”

“What about other divisions?” Ye Qingtang inquired.

“This… Guardian, other divisions rarely contacted us… It’s said that they’re pretty alright as well. As for the exact details, we are not very clear. If you are interested, you can summon the other Division Heads for interrogation any time when you’re free…” Blood Demon said.

Blood Moon Division Head and Blood Moon Sect Elder were both ranked higher than a Branch Master.

For example, this division was managed by a Division Head. Before coming here, the Blood Moon Elder had already told her everything.

“Blood Demon, invite the Guardian to head to the Hall,” Soul Severing, Troll said.

“Guardian, do enter the Hall to rest first…” Blood Demon smiled.

The Blood Moon Elder was extremely conflicted when he heard Soul Severing Troll and Blood Demon addressing her ‘Guardian’ readily.

Ye Qingtang did not reject the offer and followed the two Blood Moon Branch Masters in.

After several hundred meters later, the entire patch of yellow sand slowly split apart, revealing a huge ancient palace beneath the sand.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder followed behind Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll and entered the underground ancient palace.

Right after entering the ancient palace, Ye Qingtang felt an ancient air brushing across her face.

This palace appeared boundless and was extremely huge, with Blood Moon Sect members in red witch robes everywhere. “We pay respects to both Branch Masters!”

Noticing the appearance of Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll, read it at w.u.x is wor od . S.ite only, the Blood Moon Sect members greeted with cupped fists. “Impudent!” Blood Demon shouted coldly. “The Blood Moon Guardian is here. How dare you pay respects to us!”

“Blood Moon Guardian?!”

The Blood Moon Sect members were appalled to hear that. When they looked at Ye Qingtang once again, the color of the crescent on her glabella intensified, shaking the hearts of everyone.

“We are wrong! We pay respects to Guardian!”

Immediately, the hundreds of Blood Moon Sect members guarding outside the palace fell on their knees and did a full bow.

“The uninformed is innocent. All of you may rise.” Ye Qingtang waved a hand.

Ves!”

As Ye Qingtang spoke, hundreds of Blood Moon Sect members were pardoned.

“Guardian, please,” Soul Severing Troll said respectfully.

Ye Qingtang nodded and walk ahead.

Not long later, inside the main hall.

“Guardian, please take a rest. The Division Head is still unaware of your grand arrival. We will invite the Division Head here…” Blood Demon said carefully.

Ye Qingtang shut her eyes and said, “Go ahead.”

After obtaining Ye Qingtang’s agreement, Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll finally left.

At that instant, only Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder remained in the main hall.

Although there was no one around, Ye Qingtang did not dare to converse with the Blood Moon Elder casually. Should the walls have ears, the consequences would be dire.

Ye Qingtang had already learned from the Blood Moon Elder that he had always been on bad terms with the Division Head managing this division, and that was even more so the case for those two Branch Masters. They did not belong to the same faction, and, thus, it was inconvenient to reveal his identity. Moreover, after possessing Zhou Qu’s body, there was no way the current Blood Moon Elder could show his crescent, and he could not prove his identity.

Not long later, Ye Qingtang scanned the walls of the main hall.RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only
