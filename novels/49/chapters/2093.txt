Chapter 2094: Reincarnation (1)

Ye Qingtang could only go all out. If they were still convinced that she was the clone, they wouldn’t even need the Soul-Absorbing Stage. They could easily destroy her with their capabilities. This was her last chance.

“You think that I’m a clone just because I look like your Holy Lord. However, there are many people who look alike. No one can prevent such coincidences,” Ye Qingtang explained.

“The Soul-Absorbing Stage is able to destroy all clones, but it just doesn’t work on me. Isn’t this enough proof?”

Elder Hua was originally just casually listening but with the mention of the Soul-Absorbing Stage, she grew suspicious. She didn’t say anything and just gave Elder Bai a look. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“There are bound to be differences between clones and real humans. If we’re going to investigate it, I’m sure we will have an outcome,” Elder Bai said.

Clones could bleed and have a consciousness of their own, however, there was one thing that could distinguish them from humans.

Elder Bai and Elder Hua exchanged glances.

Elder Hua slowly opened her hand and a pink lotus flower appeared on her palm.

Grabbing onto Ye Qingtang’s arm, Elder Bai made an incision on her hand using a dagger.

Fresh blood dripped onto the lotus flower.

The lotus flower started emitting gold lights...

It took just a split moment for Elder Hua and Elder Bait to be confused.

“How could this be...”

The lotus flower was Elder Hua’s Dharma artifact, it could discern all truth. If she was a clone, once her blood touched the lotus flower, the lotus flower would close. If she was a human, the lotus flower would radiate.

Elder Bai’s face darkened when he saw it. He was convinced that he had captured the clone that had escaped for years. As Ye Qingtang watched their expressions, she could already surmise the outcome.

“I’ve said that I’m not a clone.”

Elder Bai’s brows furrowed, not quite willing to believe it.

“That’s impossible. You appeared right at the same time when our Holy Lord’s clone escaped. Our Holy Lord decided to make you part of the Undead Clan when you were created.”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes lit up and she smiled. “Undead Clan? Would the Undead Clan bleed?”

Elder Bai was stunned at Ye Qingtang’s words.

He was preoccupied with suspecting Ye Qingtang’s identity that he forgot the Undead Clan would never bleed.

“You’re not part of the Undead Clan? That’s impossible. The Holy Lord of Shadows is part of the Undead Clan,” Elder Bai said.

Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief when she heard what he said. All along she had been waiting for this sentence. “I never said that I was the real Holy Lord of Shadows.”

“What?”

“This is a misunderstanding. I’m not the real Holy Lord of Shadows, I just resemble her. The Holy Lord of Shadows disappeared more than ten thousand years ago. Her disappearance caused the Temple of Shadows’ predicament in the Central Mainland. They needed someone to represent the Holy Lord of Shadows...”

Ye Qingtang sounded convincing.

“If you’re not convinced, you can check my bone age. You can say that I faked everything else, but I can never fake my bone age. I’m only a normal human and I’m not older than 20.”

With that, Ye Qingtang stretched her arm out to let them inspect it.
