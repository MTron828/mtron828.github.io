Chapter 714: The Silver Wolf

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Chu Yi’s neck was cut by the silver wolf, and he collapsed on the ground. The silver wolf’s sharp claws tore his neck apart, and a large amount of blood was spurting out of the wounds, dyeing the ground below him red. Within a few seconds, he was out of breath.

Ye Qingtang did not care about Chu Yi’s life right now. She stared surprisingly at her regained treasure.

“Xiao Guai, how come you are here?” Ye Qingtang took a step forward and went in front of the silver wolf. She sized up the familiar figure, and her eyes were filled with joy.

The silver wolf stood in front of Ye Qingtang calmly. Its eyes scanned through Ye Qingtang and then landed on the little white tiger behind her.

It just took a glance without any further reaction.

Ye Qingtang did not expect that she would meet the silver wolf here. Based on the silver wolf’s reaction, it recognized her as well.

Ye Qingtang did not bother about that. Beasts recognized people by their aura and not their faces. Even if her appearance changed entirely, as long as her aura remained, the silver wolf would be able to recognize her.

“Where have you been? I have been looking for you all the time.” The coldness on her she had previously all disappeared now. She stared at and gently touched the silver wolf’s fur as how she did in the past. She squinted her eyes in satisfaction as the fur slid through her fingers. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The silver wolf just stood there and allowed Ye Qingtang’s close contact with it.

The little white tiger narrowed its eyes as Ye Qingtang touched the silver wolf. It stared closely at the silver wolf and was suddenly shocked.

What the hell!

How could it be this guy!

The same time the little white tiger figured out something, the silver wolf’s eyes met with its eyes.

The little white tiger trembled as it could sense the warning from the silver wolf’s eyes.

The little white tiger felt complexed as it stared at the close interaction between the silver wolf and Ye Qingtang…

She doesn’t feel weird at all?!

While Ye Qingtang was immersed in the joy of the silver wolf’s return, she did not notice that there was a man dressed in Tiangang Sect’s clothes standing in the woods a hundred meters away. He stared at the corpses of his Senior Brothers in terror…

He received Chu Yi’s call earlier, but he was busy with something else and arrived slightly later. However…

When he reached the place, he witnessed how Chu Yi was killed by the silver wolf.

The Tiangang Sect disciple was afraid that he would be exposed. He remembered Ye Qingtang’s appearance and left.

“Xiao Guai, are you here to look for me?” Ye Qingtang stared at the silver wolf closely, but she was still very curious. She thought that it was just a wolf with special fur, but… the silver wolf always went missing.

The last time the silver wolf appeared was at the Xuanling Sect in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. How did it find her when she was at the Nine Nights Dynasty?

The silver wolf did not have any reaction, and its eyes glanced at the ring on Ye Qingtang’s finger.

“Little white, you are the Fiendcelestial Beast. Do you know beast language?” Ye Qingtang suddenly had a thought and looked towards the little white tiger behind her.

The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang then the silver wolf and said, “F*ck you, I’m not a wolf. How will I know what it’s talking about?”

She can neglect those details, but don’t drag me alone.
