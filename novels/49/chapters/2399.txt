Chapter 2400: All in One Shot (1)

“Vice-President Wen, so this is the strongest team from the Netherworld Academy?” An elder from the Heaven Dome Academy said with a laugh as he looked at Ye Qing’s situation.

He hadn’t seen a team worse than the Netherworld Academy’s team in the past few days.

In the past few days, not only did the team not kill any demons, they didn’t even show any signs of killing any.

It was a complete joke.

Wen Qi’s expression was tight.

The Heaven Dome Academy’s elder watched the screen as Lei Yan and the rest of them carried a bunch of herbs back to Ye Qing and piled them in front of the youth. What a joke.

“That’s right. Why struggle bitterly if you know that you’re already going to lose? The teacher from the Netherworld Academy already understands this. Rather than fighting to the death with the demons and not being able to turn the tables anyway, why not suffer less?”

Wen Qi took a deep breath and suppressed the unhappiness in his heart.

A few other teachers heard what was happening and came over. Seeing the absurd situation on the screen, they let out sarcastic smiles.

The Netherworld Academy was done. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Even a few other nameless academies had killed quite a few demons. Yet the top team from the Netherworld Academy did not have a single kill.

It was an embarrassment to the Netherworld Academy.

“Wen Qi, where did you even find this teacher? Look at him plucking flowers in the middle of a competition…”

One of the teachers smiled as they looked at the pile of flowers in front of Ye Qing and his team. At the same time, Wen Qi looked expressionlessly at Ye Qing, his feelings complicated.

In the Wailing Well, Ye Qingtang looked at the pile of pink flowers in front of her, her mind working quickly on a plan. Lei Yan and the rest who had plucked flowers to exhaustion were all sitting on the ground.

“Boss, are we done? We’ve already plucked all the flowers in this area. What do you need all these flowers for?” Lei Yan asked curiously.

Ye Qing had instructed them to pluck all the pink flowers and as many as they could.

Even Yun Chen didn’t recognize these flowers, and Ye Qing didn’t seem to be making an elixir out of them, so why did he need so many flowers?

“Take off your outer clothes.”

Lei Yan and the rest of them looked confused but did as they were told.

With that, Ye Qingtang stuffed the flowers into their outer clothes, using all her strength to stuff them in. The essence of the flowers dripped onto the contraption she had made from the leaves on the ground.

Lei Yan and the rest followed her.

In a short time, the pile of flowers had transformed into a pool of pink essence.

Gathering all of the essence, Ye Qing said, “Follow me.”

Although they were all confused and had no idea what he was going to do, they followed him.

Ye Qing walked over to the lake, where many demons were drinking.

“Do you know what this is?” Ye Qingtang pointed to the pink essence.

They shook their heads.

By this point, Song Yanhan’s patience had already run out and he was not interested in hearing what Ye Qing had to say.

Ye Qing said lightly, “This is our winning strategy.”

With that, he poured all of the pink essence into the lake in front of him.
