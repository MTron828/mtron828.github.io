Chapter 2306: Divine Lord Stage (1)

Meng Yao hated Mu Ziying’s dark, quiet expression that was filled with apathy. Raising her sword, she was instantly surrounded by a harsh, chilly glow.

Everyone gasped the moment she activated her sword. Apart from those who were Divine Lord level and above, everyone could feel the suffocating pressure of that oppressive aura.

A powerful existence just below that of the Divine Lord stage. She certainly lived up to her name. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Mu Ziying probably wouldn’t be able to withstand even this first blow.

Glee flashed across Di Nuo’s eyes when he saw Meng Yao brandish her sword to attack. He instinctively looked at Ye Qing, hoping to witness the latter’s flustered expression.

But…

Ye Qing remained emotionless. He stood there, arms across his chest as if he was watching some inconsequential competition.

Di Nuo frowned slightly. But he quickly understood. After all, this had always been a hopelessly one-sided match. Ye Qing knew it himself.

On the fighting platform, Meng Yao had been instructed to end the match quickly so she did not show any mercy to Mu Ziying. With a vicious slash, the powerful sword aura looked as if it would slice the ground in half!

But just as Meng Yao attacked, Mu Ziying suddenly lifted her head.

At the same time, the surrounding air seemed to solidify.

The hand which Meng Yao used to hold her sword felt like it had been gripped by a wide palm. Frozen in mid-air, she was unable to move her sword even half an inch, despite putting in all her energy.

The spectators thought the match would end the moment Meng Yao’s sword landed.

No one expected Meng Yao to suddenly stop.

“What happened?”

“Why did Meng Yao suddenly stop moving?” The crowd was puzzled. They thought Meng Yao must be giving Mu Ziying a chance.

Di Nuo was further away and could not see clearly what was happening. He just saw that Meng Yao had halted and thought she must be trying to drag out the match and torture Mu Ziying slowly. He called out in a cold voice.

“Meng Yao, don’t waste time.”

On the platform, Meng Yao’s forehead was already drenched in a layer of cold sweat. Di Nuo’s reprimand entered her ears, making her expression turn even grimmer.

She was not dragging out the match!

She couldn’t move at all!

Meng Yao herself did not know what was happening. It was like she was being suppressed by an invisible force. She could not move a single inch.

Looking at the immobile Meng Yao, Mu Ziying finally spoke.

“You insulted my teacher, I won’t rest until you are punished.”

A powerful aura surged from Mu Ziying as she spoke. A suffocating pressure immediately enveloped the entire arena.

Everyone was stunned.

Meng Yao’s eyes widened in disbelief!

Divine Lord stage!

Mu Ziying was a Divine Lord level practitioner?

How could this be?!

Meng Yao was not the only one who was shocked. Everyone in the crowd was gaping at Mu Ziying.

“This… is the Divine Lord level? Mu Ziying is a Divine Lord stage practitioner?!!” Astonished cries rang out from the crowd.

They could hardly believe the Divine Lord level aura they were now experiencing.

Di Nuo’s face turned extremely grim.

How was it that he had no idea Mu Ziying was so powerful?!

A Divine Lord level practitioner was enough to lift Mu Ziying straight up to the top 10 in the Netherworld Academy!
