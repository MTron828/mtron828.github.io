Chapter 1236: Pagoda Of The Dead (1)

At that moment, Ye Qingtang almost collapsed emotionally.

Legends of the Temple of Shadows usually described its power and mystery but had never recorded what it was like inside. Come to think of it, no outsider would know about these matters.

Now…

Ye Qingtang was at her wit’s end.

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to secretly search for the location of the pagoda, Ling Yan’s voice suddenly rang out.

At that moment, Ling Yan’s voice was extremely soft, and only Ye Qingtang could hear it.

“Miss Ye, don’t move.”

Ling Yan?

When Ye Qingtang heard Ling Yan’s voice, it was as if heavenly music sounded in her ears. However, she was in the Hall of Gloom, and all the Undead had their eyes fixed on her, so she could not show the slightest sign that something unusual was happening and could not reply.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang could only follow Ling Yan’s instructions and remain expressionlessly in her original spot. She looked at Ming Wang.

Ming Wang had been secretly studying Ye Qingtang’s movements. After a moment, Ming Wang suddenly shouted coldly. “How dare you!”

This low shout so frightened Ye Qingtang that she broke out in a cold sweat.

At Ming Wang’s shout, an Undead kneeled down in a panic.

“I… I deserve to die…”

“How can there be any delay during a ritual? You can’t even get a small thing right.” Ming Wang’s gaze suddenly fell on the kneeling Undead. His small gray hand opened suddenly. The next moment, his fingers suddenly arched.

The Undead kneeling on the ground was instantly crushed by an invisible force. Its entire body transformed into a pile of ashes before their eyes.

“…” Ye Qingtang was shocked.

One must know that…

The Undead who had just died had the power of Arcane Supremacy Fifth Heaven.

Even she was no match for him.

But Ming Wang had crushed such a powerful figure into powder without even touching him!!

This Ming Wang was truly terrible!

“The Holy Lord’s return is a joyous occasion. There is no need to spoil the mood over such a small matter. Let me, Lady Ghost, activate the Pagoda of the Dead for the Holy Lord,” said Lady Ghost.

With that, she leaped up and suddenly took down one of the lamps that were hanging everywhere.

The moment she took down the lamp, the ground in front of the Hall of Gloom began to shake.

With a might quake, black fumes of death suddenly spurted out from the huge skeleton’s mouth that was carved on the ground. The endless fumes of death entwined to form a mirage of the Tower of the Dead. An altar suddenly appeared at the top of the pagoda.

“Holy Lord, please ascend the pagoda.” Lady Ghost descended to the ground and bowed to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang looked at the unreal, almost partially transparent Pagoda of the Dead. Her heart beat like a drum. How was she supposed to step into a pagoda that seemed to be made of smoke and mist?

However… Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Given the circumstances, she had no choice but to steel herself and ascend the pagoda.

Ye Qingtang secretly took a deep breath and walked step by step towards the Pagoda of the Dead. But she could clearly sense numerous eyes behind her, watching her every move.

Ye Qingtang stepped into the Pagoda of the Dead. Although it looked unreal, it felt solid. Ye Qingtang had no choice but to continue upwards.

Ye Qingtang could clearly sense that Ming Wang and the tribe leaders did not believe that she was the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows. This was probably a test of her identity.

At that moment, Ling Yan’s voice rang out again.

“Miss Ye, how much do you know about the Holy Lord of Shadows?”
