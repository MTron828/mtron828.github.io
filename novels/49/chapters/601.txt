Chapter 602: Mental Demons (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Everyone from the Central Dynasty royals and Sacred Martial Academy watched on angrily but could not do anything either.

While the Heart of the Demon God was good, if their lives were gone, it was useless no matter how good it was.

One would definitely die after entering the sea of death as the turbulent storms could shred everything into pieces.

If they chased after him and entered it, wouldn’t they be completely churned by that turbulent storm as well!

While everyone was unreconciled, they could only watch Beidou Demon Lord bring Ye Qingtang away with their eyes wide open.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang ignored the sea of death and chased after Beidou Demon Lord.

All of this was merely a part of Ye Qingtang’s mental demons. In this space, she was intangible and invisible. Thus, the sea of death did not have any effect on her. Everything here was merely an illusion from her memory.

Some time later, Ye Qingtang arrived near the bottom of the sea of death.

At that instant, Beidou Demon Lord was already drenched in blood, and all his fur was stained red while the black Dead Sea was also dyed crimson by his blood.

On the other hand, the Ye Qingtang from the previous life was wrapped in a ray of golden light and was completely isolated from the torrential storm of the Dead Sea. She did not sustain a single injury.

Beidou Demon Lord’s body was hundreds of meters large. So magnificent was it that it seemed like a pillar that supported the sky, astounding everyone.

Yet presently… this tall and indomitable frame was a ghastly sight.

The turbulent storms in the surrounding had already cut Beidou Demon Lord’s flesh into pieces, and blood cascaded like raindrops…

“Brother!” As the lady saw that the giant ape still stood straight and upright in this deathly situation, tears streamed down her face.

“Hahahaha…” Beidou Demon Lord looked at the sky and laughed, ignoring the blood that spouted out of all the ruptured cuts. “I, Beidou Demon Lord, can be considered… to have crossed the sea of death in this lifetime. From now on, historical records must mention my name!”

Subsequently, Beidou Demon Lord lowered his head and looked at the lady in the golden light.

“Qingtang, the golden light on your body is converted from my Demon Core. Even if you are in this sea of death, you can get through a day…”

With the lady in his hands, the giant ape moved his legs with extreme difficulty. With every step he took in this sea of death, a glaring blood print was left below his feet. Each step depleted Beidou Demon Lord’s vitality continuously.

However, Beidou Demon Lord seemed to have no fear at all as he walked forward upright. He was very clear that only by sending his sister to a safe land above the Dead Sea would he prevent those people from taking her life.

He…

Must not stop.

“Brother… Let’s return… Your body is no longer able to withstand the force of the turbulent storms…” the lady said and looked up at the giant ape.

However, Beidou Demon Lord did not utter a single word and walked several miles in the sea of death before arriving at an unknown island.

The moment Beidou Demon Lord’s feet stepped on the island!

Boom!

A loud sound erupted.

Beidou Demon Lord’s huge frame collapsed with a crash. As gushes of blood from his body dyed the ground, his vitality disappeared rapidly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Brother!”

The lady felt a piercing pain in her eyes as she watched the giant ape turn back into a normal human.

“Ha… Haha…” the ape said between pants. “Qingtang… that year… when we became sworn siblings… I said that… I would do… my duty as the older brother… Now… I… I have done it…”

The lady wept silently as she held onto the pair of furry hands.
