Chapter 269: Yoho? (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The essence spirit that the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect absorbed from the disciples was not enough to fill his powerful body. The strength he recovered was just one out of a thousand percent!

Everything was going according to the Elder’s plan. His enchanting voice could delude the disciples and make them lose their fighting ability. He then threatened everyone with that smash.

However… Ye Qingtang showed up mid-way.

Suddenly, the Elder’s face was extremely unpleasant.

His essence spirit was not enough to support his strength.

This time, the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect was in a real dilemma.

Ye Qingtang had figured out his disguise. Now with the sword in her hand, she could use the skills she had accumulated for three hundred years in her previous life to beat the Elder even though her cultivated spirit energy was not strong enough.

Almost instantly, the Elder’s body was full of cuts. Even though there was no blood dripping, the pain was obvious.

The longer the fight was, the more the essence spirit he used. He was becoming weaker and weaker. He could fight with Ye Qingtang for a few rounds previously, but now, he was panting heavily from Ye Qingtang’s attacks. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect knew that he would definitely lose if he continued the fight. He immediately used the last essence spirit in his body and shouted towards Ye Qingtang. “How dare you!”

The roar was mixed with strong deluding effects.

Ye Qingtang’s body froze when she heard that.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect then ran away immediately during the gap.

However, Ye Qingtang was only stunned for a moment. The presence of the Heart of the Demon God allowed her to regain consciousness soon. She narrowed her eyes as she saw the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect, who was a hundred meters away. She stepped onto the wall and took a leap. The sword in her hand was thrown out fiercely.

The sword appeared to be a streak of light under the moonlight and shot towards the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect directly.

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect could sense the cool air from his back. He wanted to dodge, but the speed of the sword was too fast. It pierced through his abdomen instantly. The great force of impact brought him down to the ground, and he was pinned to the ground as the head of the sword landed!

The Elder’s dried face was full of astonishment.

What happened?

Why did his enchanting voice not work on the young lady?!

Though he was pinned onto the ground, it was not enough for him to die. When he was about to pull out the sword from his body, Ye Qingtang walked to him silently.

There was an evil smile on that delicate face, which made the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect shiver.

“Trying to run? Not so easy, huh.” Ye Qingtang smiled at the confounded Elder. She held the handle of the sword and pushed downward heavily.

Puff!

The sword went into the ground by a few more inches, leaving only the handle outside. The Elder was pinned securely onto the ground.

The Elder’s face was dark. His eyes were opened wide and stared at Ye Qingtang, who was smiling at him.

‘What kind of monster is this girl!’
