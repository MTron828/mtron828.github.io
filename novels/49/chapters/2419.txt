Chapter 2420: Who Said I Was A Good Person (1)

Within a few rounds, Ye Qingtang thrashed the Divine Lord Fourth Heaven Level teacher so badly that he could barely lift his head. He was drenched in a cold sweat but Ye Qing still looked fresh, as if he had hardly used much strength.

As the youth executed another round of attacks, his speed was so fast that his opponent had no time to react at all.

In the next second…

The teacher felt like his head had been smashed by a huge rock. Seeing stars, he dropped from mid-air and collapsed to the ground with a loud crash.

Soon after their teacher fell, the Flying Star Academy students were defeated one by one. Lei Yan and the others tossed the defeated students before Ye Qing’s feet.

Grinning, Yun Chen had also dragged his swollen-faced Flying Academy opponent over.

The other Flying Academy students had been feeling rather despondent. Now, the sight of Yun Chen in his medicine faculty uniform, dragging their teammate over, shocked them.

What was going on?

A medicine faculty student able to thrash their Divine Lord level martial arts teammate?!

Lu Yuanxiang also led his team over. He heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the entire Flying Star Academy team had been defeated.

The Flying Star Academy teacher thought that he had come upon a good opportunity. Instead, his face was now swollen beyond recognition, fresh blood still flowing from the gashes on his face. He never imagined that he would be so utterly defeated.

“Teacher Ye.” Lu Yuanxiang looked seriously at Ye Qing. The other Netherworld Academy teachers had disagreed with Ye Qing’s decision to not let his team participate in the martial arts competition. But now, it looked like Ye Qing’s decision was the right one.

Only a few days after the individual martial arts competition, the academy teams entered the Wailing Well to endlessly hunt and slaughter demons. It was an exhausting period.

As a result, even though Yun Chen’s opponent was also a Divine Lord level practitioner, he was too exhausted to be able to fight properly.

Ye Qing looked at the Flying Star Academy teacher collapsed on the ground. Without another word, she took out his space ring. The teacher already expected that they would lose their demon crystals after being defeated.

But he saw that Ye Qing didn’t retrieve their demon crystals. Instead, he took out their teleportation talisman. Shock filled his eyes.

“Stop! What are you trying to do!”

The Flying Star Academy teacher was panicking. There was still a period of time before the end of the competition. Although they had lost their current horde of demon crystals, they still had a chance to get more. But if Ye Qing crushed their teleportation talisman, they would be transported out of the Wailing Well. They would lose all hope then!

“Have mercy. Don’t be so ruthless!”

Ye Qingtang ignored his cries. As the Flying Star Academy teacher railed at her, she crushed their teleportation talisman.

The Flying Star Academy team fell into despair as they looked at the flash of light emitted by the talisman.

But…

They soon discovered that the teleportation talisman did not seem to work…

They were not transported out.

At this moment, Lu Yuanxiang’s earlier words suddenly echoed in the Flying Star Academy teacher’s mind.

The Wailing Well had monsters above the Emperor level. And their teleportation talismans were all defective…

Could he be telling the truth? Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“You guys really didn’t… kill those from the Maple Night Academy?” The Flying Star Academy teacher seemed to be hoping that Ye Qing’s team had killed those people. After all, that scenario was far better than Lu Yuanxiang’s claims being real.

“If we had killed them, you would have already met the same fate. Would we still waste time talking to you?” Nangong Lie sneered.

The Flying Star Academy teacher’s face turned pale. There was no way he could fail to know what this all meant.
