Ye Qingtang shook her head. She originally wanted to throw this unknown token away but ultimately placed it in her space ring to return to him when she met him next time.

Then, Ye Qingtang got onto her horse and left the area.

It had already been near half a month since Xuanling Sect headed for Drifting Cloud Island, and it had been days since Elder Mo brought Fu Lingtian back to the sect, though it was still unknown whether the Yunxiao Sect spy in Xuanling Sect was found.

Ye Qingtang rode to Xuanling Sect at top speed.

Deep down, Ye Qingtang did not wish for Xuanling Sect to find out the truth as Yunxiao Sect would definitely not leave the matter at that.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang was rather frustrated. If only she killed Fu Lingtian immediately back when he barged into her room on Drifting Cloud Island, then, perhaps, the subsequent events would not happen.

However, Ye Qingtang did not think that Elder Mo was guarding in the area because of her breakthrough and would rush in immediately, catching Fu Lingtian and causing her to not have the chance to kill him.

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought at that moment.

If Xuanling Sect had not been able to find the spy, it may be a good idea for her to kill Fu Lingtian without anyone knowing when she returned to the sect.

However, if Xuanling Sect already discovered the spy hiding in the sect…

At that thought, Ye Qingtang frowned, and an inauspicious feeling filled her heart.

Although Xuanling Sect was one of the three sects of Formidable Heavens Dynasty and had a pretty good background, it was too weak when compared to super sects like Yunxiao Sect.

If Yunxiao Sect had the heart to exterminate Xuanling Sect, it was, in actuality, not difficult.

The happenings in her previous life had already proven this point.

As Ye Qingtang pondered, there were fighting and shouting sounds ahead, and one of the voices seemed to be familiar to Ye Qingtang.

“Qin Huan?”

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised. If that voice did not belong to Qin Huan, who else could it be?

Immediately, Ye Qingtang raced forward.

About two hundred meters away, several Xuanling Sect disciples surrounded a young man.

The young man’s lips curled as he glimpsed across the Xuanling Sect disciples nonchalantly.

“How daring of you all to encircle me.” The young man sneered.

“Pfft!” Qin Huan spat immediately. He was just accepted into the inner sect as an exception as an inner sect elder regarded him highly, yet he encountered such an incident the moment he entered the inner sect. Before Fu Lingtian was interrogated properly, he was killed by Ning Luo.

“Ning Luo, you betrayer! Fu Lingtian is a serious offender, but you infiltrated in the night and killed him!”

“Oh?” Ning Luo snickered coldly. “Since Fu Lingtian committed a serious offense, is there anything wrong for me to kill him?’

Qin Huan scoffed coldly. He was not dumb either. “Ning Luo, that’s simply a fallacious argument. That Fu Lingtian knows the spy in Xuanling Sect, but you sneaked into the Hall of Justice and killed him. It clearly is because you have a guilty conscience and thus silenced him before fleeing the sect. This is absconding to avoid punishment!”

“Qin Huan, you have just entered the inner sect but don’t know anything about seniority. How dare you talk to your senior brother like this.” Ning Luo laughed.

“Senior Brother Ning Luo, it’s better to return to the sect with us and explain this matter clearly.” Zhu Changge, who was beside Qin Huan, frowned tightly as he wielded a sword in his hand.

Ning Luo was the disciple that Elder Lin was the proudest of while Zhu Changge was also Elder Lin’s disciple. They were originally extremely close senior and junior brothers, yet, unexpectedly, they had to fight each other today.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
