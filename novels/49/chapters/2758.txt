Chapter 2759: Epilogue (2)

Lower Realm.

The lower realm was no longer the same as before.

Whether it was the martial arts culture of the Blue Sky Domain, the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, or the Divine Venerate Domain, they had all greatly surpassed what they had been before. Furthermore, the gap between the martial arts culture of the three regions was also shrinking.

All these years, due to the revival of the upper realm, the spirit energy of heaven and earth had increased to an unprecedented level. Large numbers of Immortal Emperors emerged, and they were all eager to become Perfected Immortals.

The once fearsome Heavenly Tribulation had already been abolished by Ye Qingtang. According to the rules set by Ye Qingtang, as long as a lower realm cultivator reached the necessary level, they would be qualified to participate in the Perfected Immortal Test. If they could pass the test, they would have the chance to become a Perfected Immortal.

…

Divine Venerate Domain, Heavenly Void.

A man and a woman sat beside a huge chessboard in front of the waterfall. They each held a colored chess piece.

.

“Tian, it’s been a thousand years. We meet again.”

The Heavenly Emperor’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang as he said softly.

“With your skills, you can definitely become a Perfected Immortal. Are you really not interested?” Ye Qingtang asked softly.

The Heavenly Emperor shook his head. “It doesn’t matter if it’s the mortal world or the immortal realm. I am unique, the only one of my kind. There’s no difference whether I am human or immortal. Furthermore…”

At this point, the Heavenly Emperor looked into the distance. “I was born in the mortal world. There are still things in the mortal world that I can’t part with.”

…

Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

The Ancient God Karma Tunnel opened and a man and woman entered.

The opening of the Karma Tunnel alarmed Ye Qingtang. After checking, she realized that the opening of the Ancient God Karma Tunnel was due to the emergence of the Heavenly Dao Karma Bloodline.

“That brat, Ling Yun’s Heavenly Dao Karma Bloodline actually opened the lower realm’s Ancient God Karma Tunnel…” Ye Qingtang muttered.

Ling Yun was Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan’s son. Not long ago, he developed the Heavenly Dao Karma Bloodline in the upper realm. Ye Qingtang did not expect Ling Yun’s bloodline to be so powerful that it could even interfere with the lower realm.

Moreover, some people had entered the Ancient God Karma Tunnel not long ago and Ye Qingtang was not unfamiliar with them.

…

Cursed Hell.

A man and a woman appeared. They were travel-worn and covered in blood. The girl seemed a little weak, but the man’s gaze was deep and firm.

“We… can’t leave anymore… maybe we shouldn’t have been so greedy and entered,” the girl muttered, holding a long sword.

The man looked at the woman. “Don’t give up. I will bring you away from here.”

Previously, they had discovered that the Ancient God Karma Tunnel had opened, but didn’t consider the consequences. They simply entered it to search for fortuitous opportunities.

But unexpectedly, they entered a land of despair.

“The Ancient God Karma Tunnel. In this land of despair, even those powerful fiendcelestials can’t leave. How can we escape?” The woman looked at the man.

The man fell silent after hearing that. He had witnessed those powerful fiendcelestials suffering day after day in this cursed hell…

“You Yun, Luo Xue, long time no see.”

Ye Qingtang suddenly emerged with a smile.

The man and woman were stunned to see Ye Qingtang.

This woman looked very familiar, for a moment there, Luo Xue and You Yun could not recall where they had met her before.
