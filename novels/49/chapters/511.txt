Chapter 512 Blood Moon Guardian (1)

Just one Blood Demon had the ability to defeat them totally, much less with another Soul Severing Troll!

If they still did not escape, they might not even know how they died!

Seeing that the remaining Yunxiao Sect disciples wanted to escape the wilderness, Blood Demon cackled. “Someone, kill all of these disciples.”

As the Blood Demon spoke, the sand below his feet quaked.

In just a few breaths’ time, over ten Blood Moon Sect members donned in red witch robes walked out from beneath the sand.

In the blink of an eye, these Yunxiao Sect disciples were drowned instantly.

In a hurry, the elite disciple took out the talisman that contained the Great Perishing Curse which the Sect Master gave him.

However, before he could release the Great Perishing Curse in the talisman, it was torn by a Blood Moon Sect member.

In about fifteen minutes, all fifteen Yunxiao Sect disciples who were sent to take Ye Qingtang’s life died at the scene. Warm blood stained the yellow sand red.

While that elite disciple was powerful, it was simply not enough when facing multiple Blood Moon Sect members. Without the Great Perishing Curse, he could not even persist for a few minutes and was killed by the Blood Moon Sect members.

After killing the Yunxiao Sect disciples, the Blood Moon Sect members headed straight for Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

They were about to kill these two people, but all of them stopped uniformly as confusion emerged on their faces.

“What happened? Kill all of them,” Blood Demon said rather impatiently.

“Branch Master…” One of the Blood Moon Sect members looked at Blood Demon, and his brows furrowed. W u xia world. sit e “These two people have our Blood Moon Aura…”

Upon hearing that, Blood Demon was stunned and subsequently exchanged a look with Soul Severing Troll.

“They have our Blood Moon Aura?” Blood Demon turned into a human form and walked forward in great strides.

“Who are you all? Why do you have the Blood Moon Aura?” Blood Demon looked at Blood Moon Elder and Ye Qingtang and asked with a frown.

“This…” The Blood Moon Elder hesitated.

Although the position of Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll was lower than his in the Blood Moon Sect, he had a feud with them before. Moreover, he possessed the body of a Xuanling Sect disciple, Zhou Qu, and the blood moon on his glabella could not appear. If he said that he was a Blood Moon Elder, no one would believe either.

Before the Blood Moon Elder thought of a comprehensive explanation, Ye Qingtang beside him had a look of indifference as she declared coldly.

“Not bowing in respect when you see me is equivalent to looking down on me.”

The Blood Moon Elder froze instantly. What was this darn girl saying!!

“What… did you say! Do you want a tragic death!” Blood Demon’s expression darkened at her words. This girl actually wanted him to bow?!

“Blood Demon, although these two people have the Blood Moon Aura, they have a dubious background. Kill them.” Soul Severing Troll spoke.

“Impudent!” Ye Qingtang yelled strictly.

At the same time, Ye Qingtang quietly directed her primordial qi to her glabella, and a crescent moon in the shade of blood appeared on Ye Qingtang’s glabella.

Blood Demon was about to strike, but upon seeing the blood-colored crescent moon on Ye Qingtang’s glabella, his eyes widened. The ruthless expression on his face froze instantly and was quickly replaced with surprise.

Even Soul Severing Troll was shocked.

“Could it be that you all… wish to revolt?” Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up slightly, forming into a devilish smile.

The Blood Moon Elder was shocked at Ye Qingtang’s action but quickly realized Ye Qingtang’s intention. Then, he cleared his throat and berated loudly.

“Aren’t you all going to bow upon seeing a Blood Moon Guardian!”
