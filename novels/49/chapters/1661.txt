Chapter 1662: Beauty Roll (3)

Baili Xuanyun was currently taking the opportunity to draw close to Mu Ruxue, so it was no surprise that all his attention was on her.

“I saw an irritating fly that kept buzzing. It’s so noisy.” Mu Ruxue’s elegant brow furrowed. She glanced at Ye Qingtang’s features and a look of displeasure flashed across her eyes.

Baili Xuanyun followed Mu Ruxue’s gaze and saw a group of youths from the Jiang Family who seemed to be discussing something.

With their current abilities, no word in this restaurant could escape their ears if they so chose. But they usually did not bother to pay attention to others. When she thought of the Jiang Family’s nasty comments, Mu Ruxue grew unhappy.

“If Younger Sister Ruxue thinks it’s too noisy here, we can eat somewhere else next time.” Baili Xuanyun smiled, and tried to appear as gracious as possible.

“Which clan is at that table?” Mu Ruxue asked.

“The Domain Monarch’s Jiang family.”

“Jiang family...” Mu Ruxue paused, then her lips curled in amusement. “Right now, the Jiang family is only supported by the Domain Monarch himself. The Jiang family hasn’t produced anyone outstanding for years. It doesn’t matter whether they participate in this Martial Arts Championship or not.”

Baili Xuanyun also smiled.

Right now, the Jiang family was experiencing a gap in their talents. Of the older generation, only the Domain Monarch was outstanding, but the younger generation could not compete with the youths of the other ancient clans. They had slowly become a laughing stock at the Martial Arts Championships.

“Elder Brother Xuanyun, don’t you agree?” Mu Ruxue raised her eyes and looked at Baili Xuanyun expectantly.

In response, Baili Xuanyun only nodded with an indulgent smile.

Beside them, Mu Feiruo had remained silent all this while, but her glance swept over Mu Ruxue, Ye Qingtang and the others at her table. She knew Mu Ruxue all too well, and she already knew what Mu Ruxue was thinking.

“Elder Brother Xuanyun, is there a beauty ranking during the Martial Arts Championship?” Mu Ruxue suddenly asked.

“There is something like that, but it’s just a foolish thing that the youths of the different clans do in their free time. It’s not anything formal.”

Although it was just something that was judged privately, everyone recognized it. Mu Feiruo had come in top in the beauty ranking, which was why her reputation for beauty had spread through the entire mainland. She had even been called the most beautiful woman in the Central Mainland.

Mu Ruxue’s eyes flickered. She was confident that she was more beautiful than anyone else. Even the frosty Mu Feiruo could not compare with her. As for any others...

Mu Ruxue glanced at Ye Qingtang and a disdainful smile appeared in her eyes.

At that moment, the beautiful sounds of a zither rang out in the restaurant. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

A beautiful young girl was sitting by the window, softly caressing the strings of a zither. The light filtered through the window and illuminated her, making her look incredibly beautiful. All the youths from the various ancient clans were eating in the restaurant. At the moment, they all looked over and admired the sight of a beautiful girl playing the zither.

“The beauty ranking that Younger Sister Ruxue mentioned has just started,” Baili Xuanyun said with a smile.

“What do you mean?” Mu Ruxue looked baffled.

Baili Xuanyun explained, “The beauty ranking usually begins after the matches have ended. All the girls who wish to participate will display their looks at a place where the various clans are gathered. Look, that girl hasn’t said a word, but when she started playing the zither, everyone focused their attention on her, and naturally they would also notice her looks...”

To be considered the most beautiful woman in the Martial Arts Championship was akin to being acknowledged as the most beautiful woman in Central Mainland. Naturally, all the young girls from the various clans were happy to compete.
