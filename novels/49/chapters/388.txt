Alarmed, Song Junqiu and the rest turned around instinctively.

What appeared before them was a black shadow that suddenly flew out from the dust at such a rapid speed that they could not react in time.

The black shadow was like a force of evil. Accompanied by a cold glint, the shadow directly scurried to the side of those three disciples.

Before the three people could take a good look at the opposing party’s face, a sharp pain spread from their throats.

They wiped the spot instinctively but touched a warm liquid!

Before they returned to their senses, scarlet blood immediately spattered out from the cut on their throats and showered everywhere like a blood rain!

Everything happened merely in the blink of an eye. It was utter silence.

A fair hand silently plucked out the Demonic Blood Sword that was stuck on the edge of the ring. Against the splattering blood, Ye Qingtang’s devilish smile entered everyone’s eyes.

With three thuds, the three disciples whose necks were slit collapsed on the ground. They held on the cut on their necks tightly, but blood never stopped flowing no matter how they tried to stop it.

Ye Qingtang swept a look across the three bastards with laughter in her eyes. When she caught sight of Ni Shang and Fei Ying, she could not help but smile.

“What are you crying for? Am I not well and alive?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ni Shang, whose face was full of tear stains, and threw a handkerchief over. “Wipe your tears away. Watch how these three people die.”

Ni Shang frantically caught the handkerchief and widened her eyes. Surprise and elation filled her eyes when she saw Ye Qingtang standing in the ring.

Miss is alright!

Miss is really alright!

Ye Qingtang turned around and looked at Song Junqiu, the only one out of the four who was still standing on the ring.

At that moment, Song Junqiu’s face was already covered in blood splatters. Below the blood, there was nothing but shock in his sinister eyes.

“Why… Why didn’t you die?!” Song Junqiu looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief, completely unable to believe that Ye Qingtang was not at all injured from three attacks of the Illusory of the Dragon’s Breath!

“Die?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow, and her smile deepened. “How can three people at a mere stage two of the First Heaven be able to injure me?”

“What do you mean?” Uneasiness suddenly crept up in Song Junqiu’s heart. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Three people at a mere stage two of the First Heaven?

How could Ye Qingtang say this?

She was clearly only at stage one of the First Heaven!

Ye Qingtang did not reply to Song Junqiu and only looked down as she wiped the blood off the Demonic Blood Sword. Without even lifting an eye, she uttered emotionlessly. “I originally intended to play with you all for a while more, but you all dared to touch my person and courted death yourselves. I’m afraid I don’t have that good of a temper to allow you all to live any longer.”

Terror filled Song Junqiu.

The instant Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, she suddenly struck. Her method of attack was completely different this time. In a split second, the Demonic Blood Sword was already blanketed in a scarlet sword aura!

In just a moment’s time, there was a reverse in the offense and defense. Song Junqiu lifted his sword in a flurry in an attempt to block Ye Qingtang’s attack.

The two swords clashed loudly. Sparks flew. Nervousness was nowhere to be seen on Ye Qingtang’s face, which only had a smile blooming on her lips. On the other hand, Song Junqiu’s forehead was already covered with sweat, and the arm that held the sword was already numb from the impact.
