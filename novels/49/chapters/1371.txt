Chapter 1372 Quack 2

At this moment, Ye Qingtang truly believed that no one here knew how to cultivate spirit energy.

Over the four weeks, no one was aware of or could sense the rich spirit energy here and instead swarmed after the spring water that contained a little spirit energy…

Once Ye Qingtang returned to the Immortal Pavilion, she saw the Emperor looking at her eagerly.

“Immortal, that immortal dew…”

Thinking that she still had some use for the Emperor in the future, Ye Qingtang “readily” tossed the water pouch with a little water left to the Emperor.

The Emperor behaved as though he received an ultimate treasure instantly. Looking up, he poured the remaining few drops of immortal dew into his mouth in satisfaction.

“The effects of the immortal dew that you bestowed is indeed stunning. I feel that my whole body is reinvigorated after taking a sip.” The Emperor returned the water pouch. His face was flushed, and he appeared extremely energized.

Ye Qingtang stared blankly at him. “…”

Is this really not a psychological effect?

Although there was slight spirit energy in the water that was beneficial in nourishing the body… this bit of spirit energy was really nothing to cultivators in Ye Qingtang’s world.

After the completion of the Immortal Pavilion, the citizens who were fortunate to obtain the immortal dew boasted about its miraculous effects.

They were just short of bragging that it could revive a dead person.

Distressed by the failure to obtain the immortal dew, people brought offerings to the Immortal Pavilion daily and did the formal etiquette of kneeling three times and kowtowing nine times.

Ye Qingtang suddenly felt that she was a quack.

But it had to be said that…

As compared to the pressing atmosphere in the Temple of Shadows where she had to move cautiously, Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

In this world…

She was a god!

Rapidly, the entire mainland learned that there was an immortal in the Yuan Kingdom.

Ye Qingtang did not receive the next mission from the God of Nature for some time and suspected if he despised this world so much that he could not even be bothered to assign missions.

However, Ye Qingtang also did not care enough to continue badmouthing the God of Nature. In the month that she was in the Yuan Kingdom, Ye Qingtang’s skills improved drastically with the help of the spirit energy in this world, and she advanced to the Arcane Supremacy Fifth Heaven.

However, as her cultivation base improved, the speed of cultivation slowed down, and there was no progress for consecutive days.

There was a huge gap between the Fifth and Sixth Heaven; thus, the spirit energy required was all the more multiplied.

Just as Ye Qingtang was wondering about the ways to sustain the speed of her advancement, the God of Nature finally spoke.

“The third mission.”

“Mhm?” Ye Qingtang looked up.

“Attain the admiration of everyone in this mainland.”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared at the God of Nature, who spouted alarming words. Could he be even more ridiculous?

According to the motion of his missions, would he ask her to attain the admiration of everyone in this world subsequently?

What exactly did he want to do?

Before Ye Qingtang could question the God of Nature about his intentions, the Emperor suddenly sent Long Qi to visit her.

“Greetings, immortal. The Dragon Court Sect has invited the rulers of various sects to head to the floating island seven days later. The Emperor has sent me to find out if you are interested in heading there.”

Dragon Court Sect?

This name was not foreign to Ye Qingtang as she had more or less understood this world in the past month since arriving here.

The Dragon Court Sect was an esteemed place in this entire mainland for people who cultivated to achieve immortality. Its believers could be found everywhere in this mainland such that even some royal families and Emperors were believers of the Dragon Court Sect.

It was rumored that an immortal presided over the Dragon Court Sect and wielded control of the entire sect. Every year, he would decide on a period of time to allow believers to head there to bestow his favor.
