Chapter 800 Emperor Dowager (1)

“Fa… father…” The little Emperor stared at the Grand Emperor pitifully.

The door of the bedroom was pushed open by someone suddenly.

An elegant and graceful lady walked in. The lady was dressed in gorgeous clothes and was at most twenty-six or twenty-seven. There was almost no trace of childishness that belonged to girls but more demureness.

The moment the lady pushed open the door, a trace of astonishment appeared on the delicate face of the little Emperor who was sitting on.

“Son?!”

The little Emperor raised his eyes and burst into tears the moment he saw the lady. He immediately rushed into her arms and cried. “Mother, father… father just beat me…”

The lady was slightly stunned. She was the Emperor Dowager now, the Grand Emperor’s only wife and the little Emperor’s mother.

The Emperor Dowager was shocked as she saw the red finger marks on the little Emperor’s face. She raised her head and looked forward.

However, she was stunned.

There was a pretty young lady who was standing beside the dragon bed staring at her expressionlessly.

The Emperor Dowager was surprised by Ye Qingtang’s appearance and almost dropped the food in her hand.

“You…”

“Mother, this rabble just beat me in front of others. I told father about that. He did not help me but beat me instead. Mother, you need to stand up for me…” The little Emperor pointed at Ye Qingtang and complained towards the Emperor Dowager with tears.

The Emperor Dowager panicked for a second and then put up her calm expression. She sized up Ye Qingtang carefully and frowned slightly.

“Grand Emperor, what are you doing? Xuan is your only child. How dare you to beat him?” the Emperor Dowager said coldly as she looked at the Grand Emperor who was lying on the bed.

“You’re the one who always spoils him, resulting in his disobedient attitude.” The Grand Emperor stared at the Emperor Dowager and frowned.

He only married one person as his wife in his life.

“Disobedient? That’s because you did not care for him at all. Did you once pay attention to him since he was born? You spent all your time looking for the person and cared for that woman. If I did not protect our son, how could he survive in this world.” The Emperor Dowager scoffed and hugged the little Emperor. “He’s just a kid. How disobedient can he be?”

The Grand Emperor felt blood rushing towards his chest. He wanted to educate the little Emperor in the past but was interrupted by the Emperor Dowager. He did not have the energy to educate him as he lay in bed all the time.

“Why did you let these rabbles in here?” The Emperor Dowager scanned through Ye Qingtang and the rest coldly.

“Long Jiang, what were you doing? How dare you to let these rabbles in to disturb the Grand Emperor when he is still ill? Are you planning to do something to the Grand Emperor?” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Long Jiang narrowed his eyes, and a cold light flashed across his eyes.

He only served one person as his Master. It was his Master’s order to protect the Emperor.

If not, why would he always protect the Grand Emperor and the little Emperor?

TAT

Ye Qingtang stared coldly at the Emperor Dowager. She was calling them rabbles all the time. Now, Ye Qingtang knew that where the little Emperor learned his vulgarities from.

“Don’t be rude. This girl is her daughter…” The Grand Emperor gasped for air and said.

A trace of astonishment flashed across the Emperor Dowager’s eyes. After studying Ye Qingtang’s appearance, the astonishment was replaced by malice.
