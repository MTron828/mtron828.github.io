The demise of the Ancient Dynasty was a mystery to everyone in Central Mainland. Thousands of years ago, men might still remember some legends about the Ancient Dynasty, but as time passed, the name “Ancient Dynasty” became foreign to many.

Even in legends, the top cultivators of the Ancient Dynasty were slowly forgotten.

Ye Qingtang would never have thought that Mo Yi was a princess of the Ancient Dynasty.

Did that mean that the Ancient Dynasty was not completely extinct?

Legend had it that the bloodline of the Ancient Dynasty was special and their cultivation techniques extreme. A normal person could not even have a taste of it. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Ye Qingtang was unable to tell what cultivation realm Mo Yi was in. Even now, as Mo Yi and Jiang Qin fought, she could not see clearly. Mo Yi’s aura was turbid, and it was hard to tell what realm she was in.

Although she could not tell what realm Mo Yi was in, Mo Yi had firmly suppressed Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin was extremely talented, and within the Jiang Family, she was considered to be one of the elite members of her generation. Few could compare to her.

Even so, she was no match for Mo Yi.

At that moment, Ye You, who was standing nearby, was growing increasingly frantic.

She thought that with Jiang Qin to protect her, no one in the Jiang Family could touch her. She had not dreamed that Ye Qingtang’s “mother” would have such terrifying powers.

Even two Jiang Qins were no match for her.

Ye You could not help but panic. If Jiang Qin lost, wouldn’t she suffer too?

She subconsciously tried to flee.

But her movements did not escape Mo Yi’s sharp eyes. Even as she traded blows with Jiang Qin, Mo Yi did not overlook this girl who was responsible for stealing her daughter’s spirit root.

“Don’t let her go,” Mo Yi said with a cold laugh.

The two demon fox servants immediately flew over and attacked Ye You.

Ye Qingtang now realized that both the demon fox servants were Heavenly Venerates. Even Ye You, who was at the Ninth Heaven of the Arcane Supremacy, was no match for them.

Her mother’s companions were truly… talented people keeping a low profile…

“You’er!” Jiang Qin saw that Ye You was in danger and wanted to rescue her, but before she could take a single step towards Ye You, Mo Yi blocked her way with a flash of cold light.

“Jiang Qin, where do you think you’re going? I haven’t had enough fun yet…” The amused smile on Mo Yi’s lips deepened.

Jiang Qin was now frantic. She wanted to disengage herself to rescue Ye You but was unable to rid herself of Mo Yi.

Ye You screamed with fright as she saw the two demon fox servants charging towards her.

At that moment, Elder Meng suddenly flew over and raised his hands to force the two demon fox servants back.

Jiang Liu, who was slightly behind him, also arrived. He was alarmed to see Mo Yi and Jiang Qin embroiled in a fight.

“Second Sister-in-law! Have mercy!” Jiang Liu panicked. He knew Mo Yi’s powers and knew that Jiang Qin was no match for her.

Mo Yi would not listen. Her blows grew increasingly vicious, and within a few rounds, Jiang Qin’s face had been scraped in several places. Things were going badly for her. At that moment, Tuoba Yao, who had gone out, hurriedly returned.

When he saw Mo Yi suppressing Jiang Qin, he looked grim and immediately worked with Jiang Qin to force Mo Yi back.

Mo Yi pivoted and landed next to Ye Qingtang. Her pale face remained composed.

“What’s the matter? Are you in a hurry to die?”
