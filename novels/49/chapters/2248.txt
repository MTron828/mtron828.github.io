Chapter 2249: Matrix Path (2)

Bloodied intestines hung out, drooping all the way to the ground.

In a flash, the demon child and the faction leaders all went on high alert. If they were correct, the batch of people who charged in first had all died here.

But…

What had killed them?

Did those evil demon statues come alive?

“Everyone.” Ye Qingtang’s voice suddenly rang out.

“Please do not make any noise on this Matrix Path, otherwise you might awaken the evil demons. If you do, you will have to pay with your lives.”

“Evil demons? Pay with our lives? What do you mean by that?” Everyone was horrified by the sight that greeted them.

Ye Qingtang didn’t reply but only took out a cobblestone from her space ring and tossed it onto the pathway in front of her.

The smooth, round cobblestone rolled across the hard ground. The clear clacking sound echoed across the expansive darkness. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Clack, clack, clack…

Everyone’s eyes were fixed upon that Matrix Path.

Just as the cobblestone rolled to the second row of evil demons, it was like the sound of that stone woke up the slumbering evil demons.

Those inert evil demon statues suddenly moved!

Boom!

One of the evil demons stepped forward and crushed the cobblestone into dust. Before the sound of the impact even faded, the evil demon had returned to its position.

It was as if nothing had happened.

“…”

Everyone finally realized why Ye Qingtang told them not to make any noise.

The first batch of folks didn’t know of this restriction and had charged in wildly. Of course it created a huge din.

“Doesn’t this… mean that any noise would awaken those statues, and we will all be killed?”

“Evil demons will only go to the source of the noise.”

They would take the lives of whoever disturbed them.

“Remember, whatever you see or hear later on, don’t make any noise.”

Ye Qingtang turned and made a shushing gesture at the crowd. Leading the Night Soul Beast, she then stepped first onto the Matrix Path.

Taking deep breaths, the crowd fell into a dilemma.

As the others hesitated, the demon child followed Ye Qingtang and stepped onto the Matrix Path. His every step was very light, producing no noise at all.

After the demon child made his move, the other faction leaders also followed.

At the very back, Lei Yan and his group could only swallow hard as they watched the people in front step onto the Matrix Road one by one. They saw people from the Rising Dragon Island knocking Mu Ziying unconscious and carrying her in. The Rising Dragon Island men were worried that Mu Ziying would try and create trouble.

“Let’s go. We just can’t make any noise, right?” Nangong Lie took a deep breath.

Yun Chen stopped them before taking out several bottles of elixirs from his space ring. He handed them to the others.

“This is a mute elixir. After eating this, you can shout all you want but you will not make a sound. I brought the antidote too, just in case. Let’s have one each?”

Everyone immediately nodded. They quickly swallowed the pills and with hardened resolve, stepped into the world surrounded by those evil demons.

Previously, they hadn’t been that terrified. But now that they had stepped onto the Matrix Road, they realized that even though the evil demon statues remained unmoving, it was as if those eyes were following their every move.
