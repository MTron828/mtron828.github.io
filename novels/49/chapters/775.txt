Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Then, Xuanyuan Lie immediately put on a straight face and reproached coldly. “How brazen! Who allowed you two to criticize the Peerless School?”

Xuanyuan Lie shouted, drawing the attention of Ye Qingtang and Yin Qingluo.

It was then that Yin Qingluo realized those two Peerless School disciples were looking at her and Ye Qingtang coldly.

An inauspicious premonition struck Yin Qingluo’s mind suddenly.

Ye Qingtang looked at Xuanyuan Lie coldly before glancing at the two Peerless School disciples.

One of the Peerless School disciples lifted his chin slightly and pointed at Yin Qingluo and Ye Qingtang. “Come here.”

Yin Qingluo had no choice but to brace herself and head over with Ye Qingtang.

That Peerless School disciple subsequently glanced at Ye Qingtang and Yin Qingluo. His eyes landed on Ye Qingtang, and he said, “You, kneel down.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xuanyuan Lie obviously laughed in his heart when he saw the Peerless School disciples’ reaction.

However, those Falling Sky Valley disciples who had not dispersed from the square felt a shudder when they saw the sight.

Those two Falling Sky Valley disciples merely whispered a few sentences and were mercilessly killed by the Peerless School people. Now… Ye Qingtang was noticed to be making comments about the Peerless School by the Peerless School people again.

Most likely…

The disciples shook their heads secretly.

Yin Qingluo was all the more nervous with worry.

Only Ye Qingtang’s expression was the same as before as she looked at that Peerless School disciple indifferently.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang suddenly lifted her leg and kicked the knees of that Peerless School disciple!

Sharp pain took over him in an instant. Defenseless, the Peerless School disciple fell on his knees with a thud before Ye Qingtang!

There was dead silence in the surroundings.

Everyone stared at the scene before their eyes in bewilderment.

Even Xuanyuan Lie was utterly stunned as well.

No one had expected that Ye Qingtang actually dared to attack a Peerless School disciple!

“What are you! How dare you order me to kneel?” Ye Qingtang said coldly as she looked at the Peerless School disciple.

The other Peerless School disciple was taken aback. Seeing that his senior brother was treated this way by the Falling Sky Valley disciple before him, a gleam flashed across his eyes. He unsheathed his sword immediately and aimed towards Ye Qingtang.

“You have a death wish!”

Ye Qingtang took a few steps back and dodged the sharp sword easily. Turning her palm, she locked that disciple’s wrist and kicked that person’s abdomen.

A loud thud rang.

That Peerless School disciple was sent flying several meters away by Ye Qingtang’s kick.

After returning to his senses, the other Peerless School disciple stood up immediately and lunged at Ye Qingtang.

The scene completely dumbfounded everyone at the square.

Ye Qingtang actually dared to hit the Peerless School disciples?

Was she tired of living?

Ye Qingtang looked at the Peerless School disciple who charged towards her indifferently. She drew out the Demonic Blood Sword and used it to hit the sword in that disciple’s hand away before sending him a flying kick, which caused him to be flung out.

Everything happened too abruptly that even Yin Qingluo had not taken it in.

When she saw that the two Peerless School disciples were sent flying away from Ye Qingtang’s kick, she finally returned to her senses and broke out in a cold sweat immediately.

Is Junior Brother Ye insane?

Those two are disciples of the Peerless School!
