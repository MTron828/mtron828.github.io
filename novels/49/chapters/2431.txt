Ye Qingtang had not paid too much attention to that but she heard Luo Sheng say that the East Tomb Academy had sent a girl to the competition. If Ye Qingtang was right, this girl standing beside Jin Qianyang should be the one.

Why were these two together here?

Ye Qingtang couldn’t resist feeling curious. She suddenly recalled something which had been nagging at her.

How those from the Heaven Dome Academy had seemed to know of the Inter-Academy Competition rules beforehand. That day during the chess matches, Xing Rong had accidentally revealed this information and it had attracted Ye Qingtang’s attention.

Jin Qianyang and the girl from the East Tomb Academy did not realize that there was someone beneath the frozen water surface. The two of them came to a stop by the side of the lake.

“What’s going on with the teleportation talismans?” Jin Qianyang looked very unhappy.

Earlier, they had attacked a team from another academy. Knowing they no longer had a chance to win, that team’s teacher had crushed the teleportation talisman, ready to bring his team out of the Wailing Well. But the teleportation talisman failed to work.

The teenage girl smiled as she gazed at the distressed-looking Jin Qianyang. “Teacher Jin, why are you so anxious? It was just an accident.”

“Accident? When the Heaven Dome Academy came to an agreement with you guys, there was no mention of this, was there?” Jin Qianyang frowned.

The teenage girl replied, “Teacher Jin, calm down. We already told your academy of the rules beforehand. I am sure you already made the necessary preparations. We have cooperated well this whole time. Why get upset over such a small matter?”

“Small matter!” Jin Qianyang’s face turned cold.

“You never told us about those above-Emperor level monsters inside the Wailing Well.”

The teenage girl said, “We came to an agreement to let the Heaven Dome Academy reap the biggest rewards in this year’s Inter-Academy Competition. The prize for winning the team competition is the best. Everything we have done is just to ensure that we fulfill our agreement.”

Jin Qianyang was looking extremely grim. He grabbed the teenage girl’s shoulder. “I don’t care what tricks you guys are up to. Those above-Emperor level monsters are already far beyond what my students can handle. And now the teleportation talismans are defective. You need to let us leave this place now.”

The teenage girl appeared unafraid of Jin Qianyang’s threat and only maintained her smile.

“Of course, Teacher Jin, don’t worry. Haven’t I led you to the exit now?”

“What?” Jin Qianyang was taken aback. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The teenage girl turned to look at the frozen lake surface.

“Although the teleportation talismans are defective, Teacher Jin can lead your students to the bottom of this frozen lake. The Wailing Well’s exit is right there.”

Jin Qianyang was stunned before his eyes turned to look at the surface of the frozen lake.

Ye Qingtang had been hiding there all along and didn’t expect them to turn their attention to the lake. She thought that she was about to be exposed but realized that…

Jin Qianyang and the teenage girl looked like they couldn’t see beneath the surface. She was clearly just beside them but they remained oblivious.

“Are you speaking the truth?” Jin Qianyang narrowed his eyes. He moved his hand upward and gripped the teenage girl’s neck.

The teenage girl remained unmoved. She answered in a docile manner, “Of course I am. Our goal is simple, we only want the people from the other academies to be buried here. The Heaven Dome Academy is our partner. How could we go back on our word to you?”

Jin Qianyang smirked. “You’d better make sure your words are true.. Taking the lives of so many elite youths from so many academies. What the hell do you guys plan to do?”
