Chapter 110: Sword Array (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Shadows of the sword shimmered on the Eight Trigrams stage. The ten lightsabers flew in the air. Their speed increased so fast that they did not leave any reaction time for the candidate.

The candidate’s shoulder was cut by one of the light swords before he could adjust his position.

The middle-aged man switched off the sword array immediately.

The lightsabers on the Eight Trigrams stage then disappeared, leaving the shocked candidate on the stage alone. The wound on his shoulder was clearly visible.

The whole process happened within a split second, which was even shorter than the time he spent in the illusion array.

“Next.” The middle-aged man said.

The candidates no longer felt relieved anymore.

Previously, they were nervous about the illusion array as they could not see the situation inside. However, though the views inside were terrifying, some who were brave were still able to fight against the demonic beasts. Even if they could not do so, they could still run around in the array to earn some time.

But now…

There seemed to be a heavy stone pressing down on everyone’s hearts.

There was totally no time to rest in the sword array.

Though the Eight Trigrams stage’s size was at least a hundred square meters, where could they run to under the attack of so many lightsabers together?

What was more desperate was that even if they could fend off one attack, the number doubled in the next round. The time in between only allowed them to take one breath at most!

No one felt relieved anymore.

The second candidate had no choice but to step onto the stage.

Everyone had a heavy heart now, trying to adjust their state of mind.

Lu Xiuwen was calm when he witnessed how the rest reacted.

He was quite talented as he went through cultivation with his Master at a very young age. He was definitely more skilled than the rest, and he had more confidence towards the sword array.

However…

Lu Xiuwen’s calmness faded slowly as more candidates went through the sword array.

The first round was five lightsabers, the second was ten, and the third increased to twenty!

The number doubled each time. Previous candidates only managed to last until the start of the third round at most. If based on this calculation, it would be forty the next round…

How were the candidates supposed to defend that?

People were dazzled by the flying lightsabers on the stage. It was difficult to have a clear vision of the positions of the lightsabers. How could they dodge the attacks? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This was like fighting against ten people with one person’s strength.

The sword array took less time than the illusion array. Candidates who finished the assessment left straight away. Soon, it was Lu Xiuwen’s turn.

Lu Xiuwen’s ability allowed him to push through the third attack with all his strength. Eventually, he was cut by one of the lightsabers during the fourth attack, and his assessment ended.

However, he was the best candidate among the rest for now.

Yun Shu was the next one after Lu Xiuwen. Yun Shu’s results were almost the same as Lu Xiuwen. He struggled for a while more, but eventually, he also stopped at the fourth round.

Now…

Ye Qingtang was the only person left.

“I’ll wait for you at the third assessment location. Be careful.” Yun Shu reminded Ye Qingtang and left.

The middle-aged man looked towards Ye Qingtang worriedly.

If the illusion array was testing on one’s wisdom and bravery, the sword array would be testing one’s true fighting skills.

Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu both possessed green spirit roots. It was normal for them to be better than the rest.

However, Ye Qingtang…

Ultimately, she only had the worst red spirit root.
