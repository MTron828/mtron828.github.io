Chapter 1589 White Magician 3

The Bishop of York looked at Ye Qingtang, who descended quite some height. The closer she got, the more he could feel the powerful aura exuded by the light surrounding her.The source of magic had already disappeared from this mainland for a long time. Their ancestors once said that the source of magic might not have completely disappeared from this mainland and that perhaps it was hidden in a deeper area.

The Bishop of York had always thought that the ancestors said that for self-comfort, but he truly believed this saying when he saw the light around Ye Qingtang.

The source of magic must not have disappeared. Otherwise, why did this white magician still have magical powers?

“Respectable white magician, we were rude and impetuous. Please forgive us,” the Bishop of York said sincerely.

Offending a white magician was a disaster for every kingdom, but winning the favor of a white magician was the supreme glory of any kingdom!

Since this white magician appeared in their Supreme League Kingdom, did it mean that she might have once been a member of this kingdom?

The Supreme League Kingdom was currently in hot water, and if they could obtain the help of the white magician, they would definitely be able to overcome this suffering and welcome the light of victory!

“It’s alright,” Ye Qingtang said indifferently.

It’s alright?

The Bishop of York did not understand what Ye Qingtang meant, but seeing that she did not have any unusual expression, he faintly guessed that she probably did not blame them.

The Bishop of York heaved a great sigh of relief immediately.

The white magician is indeed a white magician. Based on the way she speaks, she is probably utilizing colloquialisms of the epoch of magic.

The Bishop of York shuddered at that thought.

Could it be that the white magician before me is a lucky survivor of the massive disaster during the epoch of magic?

Wouldn’t she be thousands of years old then?

The Bishop of York was even more astounded. Seeing that Ye Qingtang’s clothes were completely different from theirs, he believed even more strongly that his guess was right.

Everyone else could not help but be astonished when they saw the Bishop of York’s humble behavior.

“White magician... She’s actually a white magician... Ah! The white magician actually ate the food that I made... I’m so lucky!” A young woman in the bar was about to faint from bliss—an attitude completely unlike her earlier disgust and fear of the black witch.

“What about that? The white magician even touched me with her hands.” The muscular man who was knocked down by Ye Qingtang had a completely different attitude as well. He touched his swelling head with a pleased and satisfied expression, drawing the envy of his friends.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang acknowledged her identity as a white magician, the Bishop of York immediately said, “We were unaware of your arrival. Please head to the Vatican for me to express my apologies.”

The Bishop of York was aware of the kingdom’s current difficulty and was obviously unwilling to let the powerful white magician leave.

Ye Qingtang nodded and signaled the Bishop of York to lead the way.

He raised his finger and pointed in the direction of the Vatican. He originally intended to invite Ye Qingtang into the carriage to head there together, but who would have thought that Ye Qingtang would simply fly there after knowing its location. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Her glowing figure turned into a bolt of light under the moonlight, and she flew across the city like a shooting star.

This instantly attracted the exclamation of many, and some even kneeled on the ground and made a wish silently.

The Bishop of York dared not to hesitate and quickly returned with his men.
