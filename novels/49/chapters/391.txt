Chapter 392: Receive Your Death (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Warden Song stared at Song Junqiu, who stopped breathing, unbelievably. He raised his head, and his eyes met with Ye Qingtang’s smiling eyes.

“You!”

Ye Qingtang smiled and pulled out the dagger that pierced through Song Junqiu’s heart. Blood spurted out onto her face, but her smile remained.

“Warden Song, the rules of the Life and Death Ring are set by the Sect Master. I didn’t violate any of them, right?”

Warden Song’s face was extremely unpleasant. Based on the rules, Ye Qingtang did not violate the rules at all. Even though she killed Song Junqiu in front of his eyes, it was still obeying the rules. If he purposely targeted Ye Qingtang on that, he would be the one who violated the rules.

Ye Qingtang scanned through Warden Song’s face and pulled out the Demonic Blood Sword in Song Junqiu’s shoulder. She wiped off the blood on the dagger and the sword and then jumped off the ring.

Song Junqiu had to be killed today. Even if she ignored the resentment between them and let go of him in front of Warden Song, Song Junqiu would never give up. He would definitely ask Warden Song to help him take revenge.

Since the possibility existed… she had to kill him first to prevent further troubles.

There were only four lifeless bodies left on the Life and Death Ring, lying in the pool of blood.

The disciples who watched the whole fight were all stunned. They could never even dream about the results today. Song Junqiu and the three people’s combined attack could not fend off Ye Qingtang alone. The four people who were so confident of their victory had finished their last breath.

The way everyone looked at Ye Qingtang had changed.

Ye Qingtang’s ability must have reached the Second Heaven to be able to suppress Song Junqiu, who was at Stage Three of the First Heaven…

She had just entered the sect for only a month…

Where did this girl come from?

Rumors said that she only possessed a red spirit root?!

Where else in the world would there be such an insane red spirit root?!

Ye Qingtang walked to Ni Shang and Fei Ying. She looked at how the two little guys were stunned, and she squeezed Ni Shang’s chubby face. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“People who bullied you have all died. Are you relieved now?” Her voice was warm and caring.

Ni Shang then realized the situation. The tears in her eyes finally flowed out as she saw Ye Qingtang standing in front her safely. She cried out and hugged Ye Qingtang, and her hands held Ye Qingtang’s waist tightly.

No one would know how worried she was during the whole process. She was really scared that Ye Qingtang would get hurt because of her.

Ye Qingtang sighed as she looked at Ni Shang, who was crying in front of her. She gently patted her back and called Fei Ying to follow up. The three of them left the place under everyone’s gaze.

The smell of blood spread out from the Life and Death Ring. Now that the fight had ended, the disciples also dispersed with their frightened minds.

The fight today made Ye Qingtang’s name famous in the inner sect. How insane was it for her to reach the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One in a month from Connate Level Nine!

As the crowd dispersed, Warden Song stood beside the ring alone. His eyes were fierce as he stared at Song Junqiu, who was lying on the ring. He raised his head slowly and looked towards Ye Qingtang’s direction. His eyes were full of unpleasantness and danger.
