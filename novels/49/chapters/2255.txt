Chapter 2256: Escape (2)

Ye Qingtang: “…”

There was not much time left. The illusory door was not as solid as the one at the entrance. If the major factions managed to break their way out, it would be a one-way road to hell for them. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Qingtang shed her disguise and took off her black robe. The nervous teenagers were completely dumbstruck after Ye Qingtang revealed herself.

“Bo… Boss??” Lei Yan widened his eyes in disbelief. Looking at that familiar face, he didn’t dare to believe his own eyes.

“I asked you to stay put, why are you so disobedient?” Ye Qingtang scolded.

That familiar voice. That familiar face. That familiar manner. All the teenagers were stunned.

“Is it really Boss? Boss, when did you become the protector of the fiendcelestial’s tomb?” Nangong Lie asked in astonishment.

Yun Chen was the most shocked. He had already suspected that Ye Qing was hiding his true identity, but now…

“What protector? It’s just to trick those fools,” Ye Qing said.

Those fools…

The corners of the teenagers’ lips twitched when they thought about those powerful practitioners behind the door.

“We have no time to waste. Follow me now. If they break through that door, we will all die here.” Ye Qing stated as she led Lei Yan and the rest to the middle door.

“Boss, isn’t the entrance behind us?” Jing Ze asked.

Ye Qing explained as he walked. “That’s the entrance. You can enter but you cannot exit. Just follow me. Remember, follow me closely.”

One could only enter and not exit via the Matrix Path. Otherwise, any bit of noise would trigger an attack by the evil demon statues.

Although Ye Qingtang had heard many stories about the fiendcelestial’s tomb in her previous life, she was not 100% sure if those stories were entirely accurate.

If not for the sake of rescuing Mu Ziying, she would never step into such a dangerous place.

Lei Yan and the rest didn’t dare to spend any more time talking. With Mu Ziying in their arms, they followed close behind. But as they gazed at Ye Qing’s back profile, the faces of the teenagers became increasingly curious.

“Boss… why does he know so much about the fiendcelestial’s tomb? If he hadn’t revealed himself, I would never have thought that the black-robed person was him.” The more Lei Yan thought about it, the more amazed he became. When the black-robed person first appeared, he was so dominant and powerful. Even the major factions were all subdued by him. Who could have known that it was their teacher who was underneath those black robes…

“I am even more curious as to whether that thing beside Boss is really the Night Soul Beast?” Nangong Lie mused with a perplexed expression.

Ye Qingtang didn’t have the time to explain herself now. She just searched her memories for everything related to the fiendcelestial’s tomb, so that they could avoid any hidden traps.

Soon after Ye Qingtang and her group left, the major factions behind that illusory door saw that their surroundings had started to morph as they fought each other.

The various factions had started fighting to get the fiendcelestial’s will. Under the influence of pain and the smell of blood, they started to become more clear-headed.

“Stop!” The demon child hollered.

The power of a Divine Lord Eighth Heaven level practitioner swept across the place. Everyone stopped.

“You bunch of fools. We have been duped! Where is the fiendcelestial’s will?” The demon child snapped in a cold voice.
