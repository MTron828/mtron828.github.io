Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Chu Yi opened his mouth wide and did not manage to say anything after a long while.

The reason why Master Du came out now was not due to his Master’s letter?

Besides Chu Yi, others in the forging workshop were all confused by Master Du’s changing temper.

Master Du was apparently out of patience to talk to Chu Yi anymore. He walked passed him and reached in front of Ye Qingtang.

“Young man, where did you get this dagger?” Master Du suddenly took out the dagger that Ye Qingtang handed over to Du Sheng previously. He stared at Ye Qingtang with sharp eyes.

Everyone else in the forging workshop was stunned after hearing Master Du’s words.

They all stared at Master Du in disbelief, and their sights landed on the pretty young man again. It seemed like they were staring at a ghost.

What is going on?

Master Du really came out because of this guy?

And not the Tiangang Sect elder’s letter?!

“I forged the dagger by myself,” Ye Qingtang said and looked at Master Du. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Master Du lifted his eyebrows, and his eyes were full of suspicion.

Master Du had scrutinized the dagger. Both the forging technique and the details on the dagger were considered perfect. Even someone like him who was so strict also could not find any flaw.

However, the young man in front of him was at most fifteen or sixteen. How could he be the blacksmith that forged such a perfect dagger?

“Young man, you said that this dagger was forged by you? Do you know what the material of the dagger is?” Master Du asked.

‘Black gold meteoric iron,” Ye Qingtang said.

Black gold meteoric iron?

Chu Yi, who was ignored by Master Du, looked at the dagger after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words. He had seen many weapons forged by black gold meteoric iron in Tiangang Sect. However, those weapons were different from the dagger here.

Chu Yi took a glimpse at Master Du, who frowned slightly. A thought emerged in his mind. He said directly to Ye Qingtang, “Young brother, Master Du is the representative in the forging industry. I think it’s not very appropriate for you to say such nonsense here.”

“Oh? Why do you say my words are nonsense?” Ye Qingtang looked at Chu Yi.

Chu Yi chuckled but did not say anything. He took out a black sword from his space ring. The sword was pure black in color, but the sword body was suffused with cold gleams.

“I have a sword forged using the black gold meteoric iron. Young brother, though your dagger is black in color, it seems to be different from the one in my hand?” Chu Yi smiled and said. He wanted to expose the young man’s lie to earn a good impression in front of Master Du.

Everyone’s sight landed on the sword on Chu Yi’s hands.

It was obvious that when the sword and Ye Qingtang’s dagger were placed together, the materials seemed to be different.

Though both were black, Ye Qingtang’s dagger seemed to be mixed with impurities and did not have the gleam like the one on Chu Yi’s sword.

The black gold meteoric iron was rare, and normal people might not even have the chance to witness one. Chu Yi was a disciple of Tiangang Sect. It was normal for him to have a sword that was forged using black gold meteoric iron. Of course, no one would question the authenticity of his sword.

However, as for Ye Qingtang…

Though she appeared to be a handsome man, she was dressed in ordinary clothes.

She did not seem to be able to own any weapon forged using black gold meteoric iron.

“The young man here really hit the wall today. How dare he say such nonsense in front of Master Du?”

“Black gold meteoric iron? If he had black gold meteoric iron, I would have the Millennium Meteoric Iron.”
