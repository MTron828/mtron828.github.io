“Swoosh!”

All of a sudden, a violent rush of wind burst out, and everything was engulfed by purple-red lightning. Everything trembled under this pure power of destruction.

In the blink of an eye, under the watchful eyes of the crowd, the body of the golden-robed Sky Vault Branch Master shattered into pieces under this force, turning into specks of dust, as if burned by the flames of the abyss.

“Branch Master!”

The faces of the people from the Sky Vault Sect turned pale at the sight. No one knew what had happened. The Branch Master, who had been fine just a second ago, turned into nothing in the next second. All that was left was a streak of golden soul power which escaped from his body and fled into the distance.

“Branch Master’s soul has left his body… Run!” A certain Sky Vault Sect disciple shouted, and only then did the people from Sky Vault Sect return to their senses. They immediately scattered, fleeing into the distance.

In the blink of an eye, everyone from the Sky Vault Sect had disappeared without a trace. Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder were the only ones left.

After a few breaths, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder likewise returned to their senses. The two of them looked at each other and saw disbelief and shock in each other’s eyes.

The nearly invincible Sky Vault Branch Master’s body had been destroyed by the big yellow dog in less than a second!!

Unfortunately, the Sky Vault Sect Branch Master reacted extremely quickly. He actually managed to separate his soul from his body at the last second. If he had been just a moment late, even his soul would have been obliterated!

“Brother Canine!”

The Blood Moon Elder rushed forward and scooped up the big yellow dog. He sized it up with concern. “Brother Canine, are you alright? That bastard actually dared to be so rude to you. He deserves to be hacked into pieces and die a horrible death… As the saying goes, a brother for a day is a brother for life. You’re my Brother Canine and I’m your Brother Human… I’ll be depending on you from now on, Brother Canine!”

However, the big yellow dog shook its tail and ignored the Blood Moon Elder. It looked up into the sky.

The power that had been accumulated for so many days was released all at once… and contained a unique aura. This aura would probably alert the higher realms… this was not a good thing.

…

At the same time.

The Dragon Emperor Clan.

“The Evil Lord… is an unfamiliar Emperor-level power. I’ve never felt it before… It’s coming from the north and is currently in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain!”

Hearing that, one of the Evil Deities in the Dragon Emperor Clan suddenly opened his eyes and looked towards the north. His eyes seemed to be able to peer through space and reach the end of the void.

...

The Temple of Paragon.

“Oh… Immortal Emperor-level combat powers?”

A man walked out from the walls of the palace hall and looked into the distance thoughtfully.

...

In a remote place in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

The man’s tightly shut eyes opened.

“My Lord, it should be Immortal Emperor-level combat power.” An old man stood respectfully beside the man.

“How interesting.”

“My Lord, you just recovered from the Wailing Well… and now…”

“My Lord, your body is still too weak. Why don’t you rest and return to the Third Domain?”

...

Almost at the same time, the various large factions of the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain were all alarmed by this unprecedented Immortal-Emperor power.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was just looking at the big yellow dog.. She did not expect the power released by the big yellow dog to alert the top-notch forces in the entirety of the Second Domain.
