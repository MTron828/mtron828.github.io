Chapter 650: I’ll Keep for You

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Based on Ye Qingtang’s observations, there were at least a few million kilograms of the Millennium Meteoric Iron on the second level.

“Oh my god!” The Blood Moon Elder exclaimed at the Meteoric Iron mountain below the staircase.

During the prime of the Blood Moon Sect a thousand years ago, the amount of the Millennium Meteoric Iron in the sect was only around ten kilograms…

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang flew up and landed on the Meteoric Iron mountain in the next second.

Ye Qingtang was very swift as she put all the scattered Millennium Meteoric Iron into her space ring until the entire space was full.

“Around a hundred kilograms… It’s a pity that the storage of my space ring is not enough…” Ye Qingtang sighed.

However, when she just turned over, she realized that the Blood Moon Elder was also continuously picking up and putting the Millennium Meteoric Iron into his space ring.

“Hahahahaha, I’m rich now… This is indeed the land of inheritance hahahaha. A hundred kilograms of Millennium Meteoric Iron!!” The Blood Moon Elder stared at his space ring and laughed constantly.

“Give it to me…” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang smiled and walked towards the Blood Moon Elder.

The Blood Moon Elder was stunned.

“It’s not safe on you. I’m stronger than you, so I’ll keep it for you. If you need it… I’ll return it to you.” Ye Qingtang seemed to be caring for him.

“…”

“What? Don’t you trust me?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“…”

“You’re such a disappointment.” Ye Qingtang sighed.

“…”

“Holy Lady, don’t… don’t cheat me…” The Blood Moon Elder had no choice but to give his space ring to Ye Qingtang.

“Why would I cheat you? It’s just some rotten Meteoric Iron. I’ll return it to you if you need it. Now, I’m keeping for you just in case.” Ye Qingtang took over the space ring and comforted the Blood Moon Elder.

Though her words seemed to be trustworthy, the Blood Moon Elder had the feeling that the one hundred kilograms of meteorite iron would never be on his hand again…

The Blood Moon Elder was not reconciled of his loss after passing his space ring to Ye Qingtang. He picked up another few kilograms of meteorite iron and placed them in his pockets before he felt satisfied.

“The few kilograms meteoric iron on you…” Ye Qingtang stared at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady! They’re too heavy! I shall keep them personally,” The Blood Moon Elder said immediately.

“Hmm… Alright. But if you feel that they’re too heavy, just give them to me and I’ll keep for you…”

“F*ck you. What’s the point of fighting over the rotten iron.” The white tiger’s face was full of disdain.

The Millennium Meteoric Iron was totally useless to Fiendcelestial Beast.

Soon, after collecting the Millennium Meteoric Iron, Ye Qingtang stepped onto the staircase again unwillingly and climbed towards the third level.

They finally reached the third level after an hour.

It was another Small World on the third level. There was a giant palace at the center. The blood of the dead cultivators from the first level was flying towards the palace.

Weird energy turbulence came out from the palace.

“You stay here. I’ll go take a look at the palace,” Ye Qingtang said to the Blood Moon Elder.

The dangers inside the palace were unknown. It would be hard for the Blood Moon Elder to protect himself as he was still at the peak stage of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three.

The Blood Moon Elder understood Ye Qingtang’s intention. He did not say anything and chose to wait at the place.
