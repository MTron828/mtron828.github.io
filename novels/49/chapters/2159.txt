Chapter 2160: Awakened Bloodline (1)

The eyes of Meng Yao and the others lit up at the mention of the Inter-Academy Competition.

Only the best students in Netherworld Academy could participate in the Inter-Academy Competition.

Meng Yao never expected that she would have the chance. In fact, Meng Yao’s talents were not that outstanding. But Di Nuo had already received news that Meng Yao’s family had obtained some rare elixirs and was prepared to use them on her. They could rapidly increase her powers.

“Meng Yao, you are someone who will have the chance to compete in the Inter-Academy Competition. Don’t waste your time on these useless fools.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Di Nuo did not mention Mu Ziying’s name but every single word he uttered was aimed straight at her, crushing her dignity in front of all who were present.

Face turning pale, Mu Ziying could only lower her head in silence.

Glaring at the pale-faced Mu Ziying, Di Nuo said disdainfully, “Teacher Ye, you can leave now. Bring your incompetent students with you and leave as soon as possible. Don’t disrupt the cultivation of other students.”

Ye Qingtang smiled. She had been at many academies and sects in her previous life and was used to the underhanded tactics and dirty politics of such places.

But now, the ones being bullied were her students!

“Incompetent?” Ye Qingtang’s face turned chilly. “The name-list for the Inter-Academy Competition is not confirmed yet. No one knows if your students or mine will be selected...”

Di Nuo was taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words. Going by her words, she wanted to let this bunch of useless fools enter the Inter-Academy Competition?

“Teacher Ye must be joking. Only the top students will be selected to enter the Inter-Academy Competition. If those students of yours are selected, it can only mean that there is no one else left in the Netherworld Academy.”

The onlookers also felt that Ye Qing was spouting nonsense.

Not only was this teacher new, but his cultivation level was also pitifully low. Plus those students under him were a ragtag bunch. Yet he still dared to talk about the Inter-Academy Competition?

“We will see.” Ye Qingtang spoke mildly.

His breezy attitude ignited Di Nuo’s anger.

“Since Teacher Ye is so confident, let us make a bet. If any single one of your students can enter the Inter-Academy Competition, we will consider it as your win. How about that?”

“Alright. What does Teacher Di Nuo wish to bet on?” Ye Qingtang agreed swiftly.

Everyone felt that Teacher Ye was crazy.

Which one of his students would be able to make the list?

The only one who was considered somewhat promising was Qin Feng. But not only was Qin Feng’s cultivation level not improving, it was even declining.

“If you lose, leave the Netherworld Academy immediately, and don’t smear our academy’s reputation. A person like you is not fit to be a teacher at our academy.” Di Nuo narrowed his eyes.

“Alright. But don’t worry, I won’t need you to leave the academy if you lose. I just want you to kneel and apologize to my students in public.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Deal.” Di Nuo accepted the condition.

Ye Qing and his lousy bunch of students wished to enter the Inter-Academy Competition? It was a completely ridiculous notion. The onlookers also believed that this new teacher was aiming for the impossible. How was she to achieve that?

What a joke.

Not wishing to prolong the exchange, Ye Qingtang just turned and left with the unconscious Jing Ze and Mu Ziying.

She had no time to waste on Di Nuo. Jing Ze’s body temperature was rising and she had to check his condition to find out what the hell had happened.
