Chapter 1226 Temple of Shadows 3

Ye Qingtang had no choice but to nod and say, “Alright then, I’ll go back with you and take a look.”

If worse came to worst, she would just guard her words and tread carefully.

Once Ye Qingtang gave her word, the Undead clambered up joyfully. They brought Ye Qingtang and the little white tiger back to the Temple of Shadows. The man with the goatee was also dragged along with them.

…

The former Temple of Shadows was the highlight of Central Mainland.

It was the glory of the Undead Clan.

However, with the disappearance of the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows, the temple’s power in Central Mainland had collapsed. The glory of the Undead Clan had also vanished with it.

Ye Qingtang had heard many legends about the Undead when she visited Central Mainland in her previous life.

They were cruel, bloodthirsty, and capricious. They cultivated special Dharma spells that made them very difficult to deal with.

Central Mainland’s academies had classes that specialized in dealing with the Undead.

However, in her previous life, Ye Qingtang had been busy with her own affairs and did not know much about the Undead Clan. She had occasionally seen the Undead but had not paid much attention to them.

Now, she was going to Temple of Shadows, the pride of the Undead Clan.

The Temple of Shadows had declined for the past thousand years. They walked through the Valley of the Dead, passed through the Waterfall of the Deceased, and trod through the Swamp of Death. The ancient and mysterious Temple stood between two cliffs, built against the wall of the cliff.

Before they even stepped into the Temple of Shadows, they could already sense the aura of death that saturated the surroundings. Layers of gray fog shrouded the Temple, as if hiding it from the daylight. Even the sunlight was unable to completely pierce through the fog.

Although it was day, the surroundings of the Temple of Shadows were as dim as if it was evening. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

A gigantic skeleton was embedded in the Temple of Shadows. Only the upper half of the skeleton remained, but it was more than a hundred meters tall. Its hands were crossed over its chest as if it was silently guarding the land of the Undead.

Ye Qingtang was carrying the little white tiger in her arms. It looked at the Temple of Shadows as the aura of death lingered in its nostrils, bringing with it a chill.

Dozens of skeleton soldiers wearing light armor and carrying long spears stood at the entrance to the Temple of Shadows. In the coiling gray fog, the place looked like a dark cemetery or hell…

When the skeleton soldiers heard the sound of footsteps, they turned to look. Their skulls and throat bones rattled together to emit a clattering noise.

When the skeleton soldiers saw the Undead, they bowed.

“Go quickly and inform the Guardians and Elders that the Holy Lord has returned!” An Undead said proudly.

When the skeleton soldiers heard that, they immediately raised their eyes and looked at Ye Qingtang, who was standing in the middle. They suddenly opened their mouths wide. Their teeth clattered continually as they emitted excited sounds.

The noise sounded like eerie knocking that spread into the dark Temple wildfire. The noise continued to spread through the deepest parts of the Temple. It was as if countless skeletons had received the news and were spreading it by some special method.

This was the first time Ye Qingtang had seen the Undead use this method to transmit information, and she was intrigued.

The next second, an eerie wind suddenly blew from within the pitch-black Temple. A black fog came coiling out with the wind and suddenly came to a halt in front of Ye Qingtang!

The black fog slowly dissipated, and five figures suddenly appeared.

Before Ye Qingtang could see the five figures clearly, five Undead fell to their knees and chorused reverently,

“We respectfully welcome the Holy Lord back to the Temple!”
