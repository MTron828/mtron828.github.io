Chapter 1254: Ambush (1)

“Luo Qufeng, do you want to become enemies with everyone here!”

“I never expected you to be so sanctimonious!”

The guests who felt extremely deceived berated furiously.

Yet, Luo Qufeng’s expression did not change. He merely snickered as he looked at the numerous powerful figures before him who were his offerings today.

“There’s no need to be angry. If I ever reach the peak, you all naturally have the credit for it. You all will also reach that highest realm that no one has ever reached before through another form. You all should not be angry and should thank me instead,” Luo Qufeng said with a laugh.

“Pfft! Shameless old bastard! I will fight it out with your Luo Family today!”

“What the f*ck! The Luo Family is so malicious! Let’s fight it out with them!”

The guests were completely enraged. They came out of goodwill to celebrate his birthday, but the Luo Family was so evil to want to harm all of them. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

All the exits were completely sealed by the Luo Family currently, and, in anger, everyone dashed toward Luo Qufeng and the other members of the Luo Family!

The Luo Family was already prepared for this from the start. Many powerful figures from the Luo Family who were already laying in wait rushed out and fought the guests instantly.

The initially auspicious and peaceful birthday celebration was, however, a full-blown battlefield now.

Many powerful figures took out their Dharma treasures as they engaged in a life-and-death struggle against the Luo Family.

Although Hong Zhong and Suo Mu knew Luo Qufeng a long time ago and had many years of friendship, they clearly sensed Luo Qufeng’s viciousness at this moment and feared that no one present today would be spared from his malice.

“I really never thought that Luo Qufeng would become like this.” Hong Zhong frowned deeply.

Suo Mu said coldly, “In the Central Mainland, the powerful ones have always commanded honor and respect. It’s just that Luo Qufeng’s method is too shameless. If we let him have his way today, we don’t know what will come out of it.”

“Luo Qufeng must have cultivated a secret evil cultivation technique to be able to absorb other people’s powers and convert them for his own use. Brother Suo, let’s go after him now.”

“Alright!”

Then, the two men bolted toward Luo Qufeng and attacked directly.

These two out of the twelve Saints were extremely skilled, and two destructive forces rushed straight toward Luo Qufeng!

Luo Qufeng’s lips curled into a snicker as he watched the two men coming for him.

In just a moment, Luo Qufeng shifted his body slightly, and a scarlet gleam erupted from his body and shot into the sky. The wind from his palm formed a giant dragon, which lunged at the two men.

Suo Mu, Hong Zhong, and Luo Qufeng were locked in a messy battle.

In the chaos, all clans fully displayed their capabilities. The Giant Clan trampled around thunderously while their huge fists swung toward the light barrier over the Luo Residence in an attempt to break it.

Yet, despite the unparalleled strength of the Giant Clan, that light barrier did not budge at all even with their combined effort.

Lan Yu and his nephew were fighting the Luo Family members. Spreading the wings on his back, numerous light rays emerged on his wings and shot down successively.

The entire battlefield was messy and in shambles.

Ye Qingtang was seated in her original seat. She had not spoken, and thus the Undead Clan behind her naturally did not move. Amidst the chaos, they seemed exceptionally unusual.

What is going on?!

Ye Qingtang’s head started hurting as she watched the wild battle before her.

Why did a normal birthday celebration become such a huge scheme?

She just sent the Yunying Sect Grand Elder away, but another even bigger incident followed right after?!
