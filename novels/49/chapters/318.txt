Ye Qingtang nodded.

The assessment continued, and Elder Huang could only walk down the stage temporarily.

The inner sect assessment, which should have ended, was extended because of Ye Qingtang’s arrival, and the disciples who were about to leave stopped in their tracks. Perhaps in scorn or curiosity, their eyes were fixed on Ye Qingtang. After a few rumors from the insiders, many were more or less aware of the background of this girl on the stage.

Elder Lin and the rest, who were about to grant qualification certificates to the top three on the Excellence Roll, stopped walking as well and waited at the side of the ring for the last match to start.

“Disciple Ye Qingtang is contending for a qualification to enter the inner sect.” Ye Qingtang declared on the ring.

This neither haughty nor humble statement attracted many cheers.

Below the ring, Lin Feng looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled briefly. He shrugged his shoulders and walked up into the ring with large steps where his tall frame faced Ye Qingtang.

Elder Huang from aside was extremely conflicted. Although Lin Feng lost to Ji Xianyuan, his skills were evidently way above that of normal outer sect disciples. How could Ye Qingtang fight him?

“Please take care of me, Junior Sister Ye.” The corners of his lips were tugged up. He was the third on the Excellence Roll, and since Ye Qingtang wanted to contend for the inner sect qualification, she would naturally spar with him.

Looking up towards Lin Feng who was already ready to strike an attack, Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke out.

“Wait.”

Lin Feng initially wanted to end this nonsense of a competition as soon as possible and thus could not help but frown when he heard Ye Qingtang.

“Why? Could it be that you regret your decision?”

At that instant, Elder Huang earnestly wished Ye Qingtang would have a “sudden awakening” and quickly come down from the ring.

There were muffled laughs among the surrounding disciples as well.

Indeed!

Not many had the boldness to spar with such a skilled elite like Lin Feng.

However…

Just as everyone assumed Ye Qingtang regretted going into the ring, Ye Qingtang suddenly lifted a hand. Her finger moved past Lin Feng on the stage and pointed at Ji Xianyuan, who was standing below the ring!

“I want to challenge Senior Brother Ji, the number one on the Excellence Roll.”

Ye Qingtang’s words caused a blast of comments in the square.

“Is Ye Qingtang crazy? She actually wants to challenge Senior Brother Ji directly?!”

“What kind of joke is this? With her skills, she might not even make it through one move from Senior Brother Ji…”

All the disciples were completely shocked by Ye Qingtang’s words.

Elder Huang’s heart, which had just calmed down, raced immediately. He widened his eyes in disbelief and looked at Ye Qingtang.

On the ring, Lin Feng was dumbfounded for a moment. An astonished expression flashed across his eyes. He obviously did not expect Ye Qingtang’s appetite to be this huge! She actually initiated a challenge to Ji Xianyuan directly!

Lin Feng narrowed his eyes, and his lips curled into a sarcastic smile. With a casual shrug, he turned to look at Ji Xianyuan.

“Senior Brother Ji, Junior Sister Ye wishes to spar with you. I guess you can only help to fulfill her wish.” Then, Lin Feng jumped down from the ring.

There was no expression on Ji Xianyuan’s face as he walked up to the ring after casting a look at Ye Qingtang.

According to the inner sect assessment qualification that Ye Qingtang obtained, she could challenge anyone of the top three disciples on the Excellence Roll. However, the act of directly challenging the number one was unbelievably insane.
