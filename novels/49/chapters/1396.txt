1397 Sacred Ground of Reflection 2

The expressions of the ambassadors of the Sacred Ground of Reflection expression darkened.

Immediately, the ambassador who was standing at the front said, “Holy Lord of Shadows, the Sacred Ground of Reflection has never interfered with the Temple of Shadows’s matters. Our forces are everywhere and very different. However, what you did in the Eternal Dynasty previously…”

Before that person finished speaking, Ye Qingtang said impatiently to Ming Wang, “I don’t wish to repeat myself.”

Almost instantly after Ye Qingtang said that, Ming Wang’s eyes turned cold, and his figure turned into a ball of black shadows.

Before that ambassador realized what was happening, he felt a sharp pain in his knees suddenly, and he fell on his knees with a thud.

“If you have anything to say, speak on your knees,” Ye Qingtang said.

“You…” That ambassador’s expression froze. He wanted to stand up, but Ming Wang’s hand was pressed on his shoulder.

Ming Wang merely placed his hands on the ambassador’s shoulder lightly, but that ambassador felt that he seemed to be pressed down by a mountain and could not move an inch.

Looking at the ambassador’s foul expression, Ye Qingtang suddenly snickered. “The Sacred Ground of Reflection is really egotistical. How dare it send you small fries to speak to me. Does it really think there is no one in the Temple of Shadows?”

Ye Qingtang could tell that these ambassadors were at most at the Arcane Supremacy realm and thus were evidently not important members of the Sacred Ground of Reflection. From the Sacred Ground of Reflection’s decision to send these people to the Temple of Shadows, it was clear that they belittled the Temple of Shadows.

In the thousands of years that the Holy Lord of Shadows disappeared, the Temple of Shadows declined gradually while the Sacred Ground of Reflection rose rapidly.

That ambassador’s expression turned even uglier after hearing what Ye Qingtang said. Meanwhile, Ming Wang found out that these people were not skilled enough a long time ago and was rather dissatisfied as well.

Seeing that the situation was a little off, another ambassador immediately came forward, kneeled down, and bowed courteously. He smiled at Ye Qingtang and said, “Holy Lord of Shadows, please don’t be angry. We are not very familiar with the Temple of Shadows’s rules and breached the rules slightly.”

Ye Qingtang originally wanted to make use of the subject as a pretext to chase the Sacred Ground of Reflection ambassadors away, yet unexpectedly, there was a tactful person in the group.

“We are here today for the Eternal Dynasty incident. May I know what was the reason behind your actions, Holy Lord of Shadows?” That person asked Ye Qingtang with a smile.

“Do I still need to inform the Sacred Ground of Reflection about what I do?” Ye Qingtang snickered. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

That person froze.

The Sacred Ground of Reflection’s purpose of coming was to question the Temple of Shadows about the reason behind their interference in the Eternal Dynasty. Yet, they did not expect that the Holy Lord of Shadows would be this arrogant and not give them a chance to speak.

“Uh… The Sacred Ground of Reflection is interested in many large kingdoms. I’m afraid the Temple of Shadows’s interference is inappropriate.”

Ye Qingtang said immediately, “I will support whoever I want to. Others do not have the qualifications to tell me what to do in front of me.”

That person was about to say something, but Ye Qingtang put on an impatient look.

“Ming Wang, throw them out.”

Anyways, she was not the real Holy Lord of Shadows, and it was none of her business even if the Temple of Shadows and Sacred Ground of Reflection really fought…

Ye Qingtang’s current mentality was to not put herself in the real Holy Lord’s shoes.

If the Sacred Ground of Reflection has the ability, it can just fight with the Temple of Shadows.
