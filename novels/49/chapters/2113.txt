Chapter 2114: Sea King (2)

All of a sudden, eight giant sea creatures sprang out of the waves. They were wrapped in gold chains and pulled out from the water behind them a glowing blue carriage!

Everyone’s pupils shrank instantly.

“That’s... It’s the Sea King’s carriage!”

“The Sea King?”

“The Sea King is here?”

They couldn’t believe their eyes. Even though they were all the top powers of the Second Domain, the sight of the azure carriage made them tremble.

The ruler of the seas in two domains, millions of sea creatures, the leader of the oceans... It was the Sea King!

Swoosh!

Riding the rippling blue waves, the sea creatures stopped at the entrance of the main hall. The carriage behind them glowed a brilliant blue, blinding all of them.

A figure suddenly flew from the carriage and landed in the middle of the Sky Temple main hall.

It was a mammoth blue figure, about two times taller than an adult male. He held a golden trident in one hand, gold scales covering his body.

“Where is the Holy Lord?” His loud voice boomed out in the main hall.

The Sea King.

The Fox Demon who had already been standing in the main hall greeted the Sea King politely as he saw him. “Greetings, Sea King. The celebration has yet to start, so may we trouble you to wait a little while?”

He gave the attendants a subtle look.

An attendant quickly moved a special seat into the main hall. The other attendants moved out of the way and formed a path for the Sea King.

No one had any interest in provoking the king of two domain seas. No one wanted to die today.

But they were all surprised as the Sea King was elusive and didn’t like interacting with people on land. How great was the Paragon Holy Lord that the Sea King had come to personally attend her birthday celebration!

Everyone exchanged glances but didn’t dare to do anything in front of the Sea King.

All this was seen by Ye Qingtang. She could see the entire room freeze when he had appeared.

The Sea King was the power of legends...

She hadn’t heard of a single person who could befriend the moody Sea Clan in her previous life.

She was truly impressed... by this Holy Lord.

Even the Sea King had come.

“A long time ago, the Holy Lord made a bet against the Sea King and won.” Elder Hua seemed to sense Ye Qingtang’s confusion and spoke up.

“The Sea King lost and had to hand a Deity Ocean from the Sea Clan over to the Temple of Paragon. Each Deity Ocean had to be cultivated for a long time by the Sea King to become that powerful but our Holy Lord had already fallen and missed the agreed timing to meet with the Sea King. After half a year, the Sea King began to have his suspicions and decided to come today...”

“You’re saying that the Sea King suspects that your Holy Lord has already fallen?” Ye Qingtang said.

Elder Hua nodded.

“He’s here now. So you prepared this celebration for him? she asked.

Elder Hua nodded. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I see.” Ye Qingtang stopped asking questions.

Elder Hua was shocked. “Are you not curious as to why we are doing this? Our Holy Lord has already fallen. Don’t you think we should be afraid that the Sea King will find out?”

“I’m not curious at all. I’m not a naturally curious person. If there’s nothing else, I’ll be heading back to the floating island.” Ye Qingtang was determined to not fall into Elder Hua’s trap.
