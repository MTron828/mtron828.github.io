Chapter 2217: Spy Cloud (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

When Qin Feng was young, he had once seen an elder hire someone from Sky Cloud, so he knew what this faction was like. Let alone the emblem of Sky Cloud was stitched onto the chest of the person’s clothes.

It was rumored that as long as one offered enough money, there was nothing Sky Cloud could not do. Even so, Qin Feng did not understand why someone from Sky Cloud would come to the Evil Soul Forest...

In the blink of an eye, the person had arrived in front of Ye Qingtang and her group. The person was so frightened that his face was pale as a sheet of paper. His clothes were covered with fresh blood stains and his eyes were crazed. He was like a madman and one of his legs seemed to be injured. Limping, he left behind a trail of blood wherever he went.

He looked like he was in his early 30s, but his appearance was extremely wretched now...

“Help! Help!” That person looked at the group of living humans as if they were his saviors. He threw himself toward Ye Qingtang, who was in the lead, his widened eyes filled with terror.

At this point, Nangong Lie and the rest suddenly realized that he was missing one eye. It looked like someone had just gouged out his left eye. All that was left was a dark, bloodied hole.

“Dead... all dead... everyone is dead. A monster... monster killed them...” The man was in a frenzy and tears of blood flowed out of his eye socket.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

The hairs on Lei Yan and the rest all stood on end on hearing the words of the man.

“Monster? What monster? Boss... let’s escape now.” Lei Yan hurriedly spoke up.

But before Lei Yan could finish his words, that strange beastly howl rang out again in the Evil Soul Forest.

In the next second, a massive black figure weaved through the dense forest, rapidly charging toward them.

That black figure was extremely bizarre. It was pitch-black as if it was a big mass of sludge. All the plants which came into contact with it seemed to merge into its body, before reappearing again after it passed. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Ghastly wails followed the black figure as it came closer and closer.

“What... what is that...” Lei Yan’s heart leaped nearly to his eyes on seeing that massive black figure.

“Night Soul Beast.” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes as she stared at the large black mass.

“What is a Night... Night Soul Beast?” Lei Yan was stunned.

“A servant of the fiendcelestial. It was born from all the gathered resentment of grievous souls. It eats human souls as food.” Ye Qingtang explained impassively.

But Ye Qingtang didn’t tell them one additional point.

And that was the Night Soul Beast especially loved souls that were filled with terror and despondency. Souls filled to the brim with negative feelings were the best delicacy for this Night Soul Beast.

Thus...

When a Night Soul Beast hunted, it would try its best to force someone to the edge of despair.

“Run... hurry up and run. That Night Soul Beast killed over a hundred people from my team... it is a monster...” The man from Spy Cloud wailed fearfully. He gripped Ye Qingtang’s arm in a begging manner, praying that they would bring him along and escape far away.

Lei Yan and the others looked even grimmer, especially Qin Feng. He had some knowledge about Spy Cloud and knew that they would definitely send a strong contingent into a place like this.

But all that was left of them was this man.

“Boss, let’s run now!” Lei Yan cried in panic.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

“It’s too late.”
