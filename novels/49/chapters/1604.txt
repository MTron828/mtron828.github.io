Chapter 1605: Parasite (2)

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on both Toby and Ye Qingtang at this instant as they waited for Toby to teach the parasite a lesson. They wanted to show her the powers of a true Kingdom Knight and let her know that she was simply unworthy of the same title.

Toby sized up Ye Qingtang nonchalantly. His eyes were full of contempt as he picked up his spear and made a few strokes in front of Ye Qingtang.

In the next second, Toby’s strokes became extremely fast. Every move was aimed at Ye Qingtang, yet all of these imposing and frightening moves coincidentally missed her body.

Even if one was not pierced by it, the sight of a spear striking at someone numerous times was already terrifying enough.

Yet, Ye Qingtang remained rooted to the ground as she glanced at those attacks emotionlessly.

The surrounding Kingdom Knights erupted in laughter when they saw that Ye Qingtang did not move.

“Toby, go easy on her. Don’t you see that she has already turned white in fear?”

“How pitiful. Tang probably does not dare to move at all now, right?”

The surrounding Kingdom Knights looked at Ye Qingtang scornfully. “How dare she carry the Kingdom Knight title with such timidity? If she were really sent to the battlefield, she would just pee in her pants out of fear, wouldn’t she?”

With a pleased expression, Toby looked at Ye Qingtang and said. “We go through such training every day. Tang, since you have already become a Kingdom Knight, you must come here every day and train with us.”

They would take great care of this sheltered girl every day and teach her proper Kingdom Knight bearing. By then, even if they did not initiate it, Ye Qingtang would make a request to the King for her to leave due to the inability to withstand such training.

Surrounded by the mockery, Ye Qingtang remained emotionless, however. Her eyes passed by each scornful face and eventually landed on Toby.

“Can we start now?”

Toby raised a brow. “Of course. You can surrender anytime when you can’t stand it.”

Ye Qingtang did not say a word.

While facing his surrounding comrades, Toby shrugged before lifting his spear in the air as though to display his strength. Afterward, he looked at Ye Qingtang indifferently and said, “I’m going to start, okay?”

He sounded like he was teasing an immature child.

The moment he finished his sentence, Toby directly struck at Ye Qingtang with his spear.

Ye Qingtang remained motionless, and it was as though she did not notice Toby’s attack at all. To everyone else, Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck and did not even have the courage to flee.

But just as Toby’s spear was about to stab into Ye Qingtang’s shoulder, Ye Qingtang suddenly raised her right hand and grabbed the spearhead.

In just a moment, Toby’s move seemed to come to a standstill as he maintained his attacking stance without moving.

Toby was slightly taken aback, but the clueless Kingdom Knights around him continued to guffaw.

“Toby, isn’t it too obvious that you went easy on her?”

However, only Toby himself knew what was going on; his spear seemed to be stuck in a huge mountain, and he could not move it no matter how much strength he put in.

What is going on?

Toby almost used all his strength—his face was flushed, and his veins were about to pop. But it was still useless.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
