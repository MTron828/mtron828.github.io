Chapter 984 Death Wish (5)

“Now that matters have reached this state, what do you have to say for yourselves?” Duan Yangjing looked coldly at everyone from the Ye Family.

Even he had been completely taken aback by the news he had just heard.

He had flown into a rage when he saw Duan Tianyun being carried back by Duan Family members.

The injuries that Duan Tianyun had sustained throughout his body were unusually severe. The bones throughout his body had been crushed. Although Duan Yangjing had invited numerous famous doctors to treat Duan Tianyun, the results had caused Duan Yangjing to break down.

Duan Tianyun’s injuries had extended to his organs and affected his veins. Even if he recovered, he would probably be crippled. In the future, it would be impossible for him to continue his martial arts cultivation, much less return to the peak of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One.

Ye Ling and the elders exchanged looks. Even with the youths from the Ye Family as witnesses, they still found it hard to accept the situation. However, it looked like they would have no time to ponder how Ye Qingtang had severely injured Duan Tianyun.

In the face of Duan Yangjing’s aggressive stance, Ye Ling blandly spoke.

“The Duan Family was the first to suggest this match. Fights are dangerous, and injuries are common on the dais… Not only was someone from your Duan Family injured, but someone from our Ye Family was also severely injured. What is there to say?”

“Rubbish!” Duan Yangjing bellowed coldly. “Your Ye Family skills are inferior, so it’s not surprising you sustained injuries. But my son is so talented, how could your daughter, Ye Qingtang, have injured him so severely! Today, I will make Ye Qingtang pay an eye for an eye.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Duan Yangjing’s unreasonableness infuriated the Ye Family.

Did they mean that the people from the Duan Family counted as human beings but not those from the Ye Family?

“Duan Yangjing, don’t go too far!” Ye Ling shouted coldly. He drew the sword at his side with a ringing sound.

The three elders behind him also drew their swords.

“Go too far?” Duan Yangjing laughed coldly. A malicious gleam suddenly flashed across his eyes. “So what if I’m bullying you today? Men, even if you have to completely overturn the Ye Family, you must capture Ye Qingtang today!”

At Duan Yangjing’s command, the group of Duan Family members behind him immediately drew their swords and faced off with the group from the Ye Family.

The youths from the Ye Family saw that things had gone awry and prepared for battle.

“I heard that… you want to capture me?” A clear female voice suddenly rang out from behind them.

The moment she finished speaking, Ye Qingtang slowly walked out from behind the group from the Ye Family.

“Tang Tang?” Ye Ling was startled when he saw his daughter suddenly move forward.

Ye Qingtang gave Ye Ling a placating look and walked to face the group from the Duan Family.

“Ye Qingtang, you’ve finally appeared!” Duan Yangjing looked at Ye Qingtang, who had emerged from the crowd. His bloodshot eyes looked at her as if he wanted to flay her alive.

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang looked expressionlessly at the furious Duan Yangjing.

“Men, capture Ye Qingtang!” Duan Yangjing shouted.

“Let’s see who dares to try!” Ye Ling stepped in front of Ye Qingtang, and the group from the Ye Family also advanced a step.

“Father, let me deal with this.” Ye Qingtang placed her hand on Ye Ling’s shoulder and spoke calmly.

Ye Ling hesitated, but Ye Qingtang had already walked in front of Ye Ling. Her calm eyes swept across the group from the Duan Family.

“You wish to avenge Duan Tianyun?” said Ye Qingtang.
