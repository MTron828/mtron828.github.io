Chapter 2332: Palm Flame (1)

But for some unknown reason, Ye Qing had just directly rejected him. There was no mercy nor hesitation at all.

Not only that, Qin Feng and the others did not protest either. They even showed their firm support?

Had they all gone mad?

Rejecting Song Yanhan just for one Yun Chen?

And offending Zhu Ning…

…

Zhu Ning was scowling as he led Song Yanhan away. Halfway, he suddenly spied a familiar figure.

“Teacher Di Nuo.” Song Yanhan greeted politely when he saw Di Nuo heading their way.

As Di Nuo was acquainted with Zhu Ning, Song Yanhan was more courteous toward him than he was to other teachers. In response, Di Nuo gave a brief nod before looking at Zhu Ning’s dark face.

“What’s the matter, Teacher Zhu? Why do you look so grim?”

Zhu Ning frowned but kept silent.

In the end, Song Yanhan narrated the entire incident that had happened earlier.

Di Nuo smiled after hearing the story.

“So it’s because of Ye Qing. I think that Teacher Zhu and I have the same issue.”

“Oh? How so?” Zhu Ning looked doubtful at Di Nuo.

Di Nuo immediately told him about his bet with Ye Qing, but he glossed over his attempts to make things difficult for the youth and only talked about how arrogant Ye Qing was and how he had flouted multiple school rules…

The previous encounter already had Zhu Ning dislike Ye Qing. After hearing Di Nuo’s account, he now detested him even more.

“I have come today to see if Yun Chen can qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition. I wonder what Teacher Zhu thinks?” Di Nuo asked.

Zhu Ning didn’t respond but Song Yanhan couldn’t resist snorting. “Him? Dream on. Teacher Di Nuo, Yun Chen is the lousiest student in the medicine faculty. If not for the Liu Yun family clan, he would have been kicked out long ago. Why else would he still be here?

“Ye Qing might have shown some abilities in martial arts, but today’s competition is on elixir refinement. Don’t tell me he knows how to teach alchemy too?”

A smile flashed across Di Nuo’s eyes on hearing that.

“If that’s the case, it’s also a good thing that Yanhan didn’t partner with Qin Feng. After all, if Yun Chen fails to qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition, the entire group of them would be kicked out of the Netherworld Academy.”

Upon hearing the news, Song Yanhan felt somewhat better.

…

The selection trials for those in the medicine faculty were about to begin. Unlike those in martial arts, the medicine faculty’s trials were more inclusive. Any student who was willing to give it a shot could sign up.

The format of the competition was very simple. A few hundred students would be participating in this trial and all competitors had to refine a certain elixir within a fixed amount of time. The quality of the elixir would be judged and the top 10 students selected from there.

Yun Chen had already been escorted to the trial arena by Ye Qingtang and the others. Given his reputation, his appearance attracted quite a number of astonished looks from the other medicine faculty students.

No one expected such a lousy student to dare to participate in this trial.

And those in the know soon spread the news of the bet between Ye Qing and Di Nuo. They also reported on the recent clash between Ye Qing and Zhu Ning.

In an instant, a fierce discussion was ignited across the entire medicine faculty. Everyone believed that Ye Qing must be mad.

Could he even teach alchemy? On what basis did he dare to go head-to-head with Zhu Ning?

“I think Ye Qing is getting ahead of himself. Just because he managed to produce a few good martial arts students, he now thinks that the medicine faculty is also his domain?”
