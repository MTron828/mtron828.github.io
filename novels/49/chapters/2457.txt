The big yellow dog wagged its tail and sniffed the air before it glanced at the cheering crowd and said, “I say… aren’t you guys celebrating too soon? Come, smell the air here.”

“What do you mean?” Yun Chen was confused.

Ye Qingtang felt like smacking her own face. These people were really slow. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Don’t you guys think that the quality of the spirit energy here is very high?” Ye Qing, who had been silent all this while, suddenly asked.

Only then did everyone realize something. Previously, because they had just escaped death, they had been too excited to think so much.

“Teacher Ye Qing… the quality of the spirit energy here… is indeed too high!” Lu Yuanxiang was shocked. He had never felt such rich and high-quality spirit energy in his life.

Even the top spirit energy room in an elite academy was not even one-thousandth as good as this place!

“This… this is an excellent place to cultivate!!” Apart from the initial shock, the Flying Star Academy teacher also felt ecstatic.

If he were to cultivate here for a period of time, he would definitely be able to break through the bottleneck that he had been stuck at for the past seven to eight years!

What kind of divine place was this?!

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. Great, they still did not recognize the reality.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, sounds of fighting came from afar.

Ye Qingtang moved toward the source of the noise. Lu Yuanxiang, the Flying Star Academy teacher and the students followed Ye Qing without hesitation.

A moment later, Ye Qingtang arrived at a small hill. She carefully popped her head out and examined the area below.

Lu Yuanxiang, the Flying Star Academy teacher and the rest followed suit and carefully stuck their heads out like Ye Qing.

“What is that?”

Lu Yuanxiang stared at the chaotic battle between hundreds of demons and trembled violently.

He had never seen such a scene in his life.

The auras emitted by those beasts were suffocating. Some of them were even more terrifying than the above-Emperor level monsters in the Wailing Well!

Strictly speaking, an above-Emperor level monster had only just breached the Emperor level. But the beasts before them had true Emperor-level auras. Moreover, these auras were even more ancient and astounding!

“Those are demons…”

Ye Qingtang said coldly.

“Demons?! Teacher Ye Qing… you are saying that those beasts are… demons!” Cold sweat broke out on the Flying Star Academy teacher’s forehead.

Demons… they had only seen them in pictures. None of them had seen a real demon before. This was the first time they were looking at demons. And they were already looking at such a massive number.

“Why are there humans down there too?” Lu Yuanxiang was confused.

Indeed, there were human figures among the demons.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “They’re not humans. They’re demons in human skin.”

Everyone gasped at her words.

Wearing human skin?

“Demons like human skin the most. When they see humans, they will completely peel off their human skin and put it on themselves,” Ye Qingtang said.

At that moment, the crowd began to realize what had happened.

No wonder the spiritual energy here was so rich and the quality so high. This was not their world!

They had felt so happy and relieved earlier, but now, they all fell into a daze. They had clearly left the wolf’s den just to land in the tiger’s lair…

With their lowly skill levels, wouldn’t they be skinned alive by those demons?

“Boss, how did you return to the palace earlier? I left something back there and need to go back and get it,” Lei Yan looked at Ye Qingtang in all seriousness..
