The woman in green’s deal was a little too ridiculous. She wanted her heart? She might as well have said that she wanted her life.

“Ye Qingtang, your heart is an unlucky item. With your intelligence and strength, you are unable to control it at all. It will only bring you a fatal calamity. Therefore, my deal is that I can remove all the bad luck contained in your heart,” the lady in green explained.

Ye Qingtang did not find it strange that this woman in green could see through the mysteries of her heart. After all, she was the reincarnation of a True God. Although she was not a True God now, she had been one in her previous life.

“You can see through my heart…” Ye Qingtang frowned.

The lady in green gave a small smile. “I can’t see through your heart, but I can extract all the bad luck in your heart from your body. In this way, your heart will become an ordinary heart. From then on, you won’t have any more worries. Your true potential won’t be restricted by the heart any longer. Meanwhile, I might have to endure the bad luck for you too. This deal is very worth it for you, isn’t it?”

Ye Qingtang understood her logic. However, why would the lady in green be so kind-hearted? Even if this woman could really suck away the misfortune of the Heart of Heavenly Dao and turn her own heart into an ordinary heart, Ye Qingtang would never make a deal with her.

Ye Qingtang wanted to speak, but before she could say anything, the big yellow dog suddenly said, “Alright, we understand the deal you want to make and we agree.”

Ye Qingtang was surprised and looked at the yellow dog in confusion.

However, before Ye Qingtang had the chance to speak, the big yellow dog looked at the lady in green and continued, “However, in your current condition, are you certain that you can endure the bad luck of her heart? If you think that there’s no problem and that you won’t explode and die, you can take it.”

The woman in green shook her head and said, “It’s impossible in my current situation, but no problem. I won’t make her wait too long. Soon, my strength will be enough to control the misfortune of her heart.”

“That’s easy for you to say. Everyone outside should be from the Sky Vault Sect, right? They probably won’t let her off,” the big yellow dog said.

The lady in green smiled. “Not exactly. Because of you, many major powers in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain were alerted. Many of them are just trying to probe into the appearance of the new Immortal Emperor level being. But they don’t know that this Immortal Emperor needs to accumulate its powers over a long time to launch just one single attack. If they knew, don’t you think they would just kill you all? It would prevent future troubles.”

The big yellow dog nodded and said, “You have already comprehended the restrictions of the natural laws at such a young age. You actually know so much. Not bad, not bad.”

“Alright, there’s no need to say such flattering words. Remember, you must not admit that the Immortal Emperor’s power is yours. Don’t die before our deal is completed.” After saying that, the woman in green turned and left.

After the lady in green left, Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog. “Do you think she would be so kind-hearted?”
