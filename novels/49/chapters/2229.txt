Chapter 2230: Mental Demons (1)

Ye Qingtang would not remain too long on this mainland because of the Temple of Paragon. She was trying to make use of the Inter-Academy Competition and the Netherworld Academy’s Wind-Calming Pearl to leave this mainland.

The matter of the First Domain had already been settled. Ye Qingtang’s most pressing issue now was that Heart of the Heavenly Dao which could bring her trouble at any time.

The only clue that could unravel this mystery was her mother.

“The Dragon Emperor Clan...” Her mother had been missing for a long time and the Dragon Emperor Clan had been trying to find traces of her mother all this while. Since Ye Qingtang was in the Second Domain now, she wanted to visit the Dragon Emperor Clan and try to see if she could find her mother.

But before that, Ye Qingtang needed to get that Evil Fruit and seal the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

Although Ye Qingtang said that she wanted to bring Lei Yan and the rest out of the Evil Soul Forest, they weren’t really going to leave. After all, their training had yet to be completed. Although every one of them had improved, they still had a fair degree to go before being able to enter the Inter-Academy Competition.

Ye Qingtang planned to bring them to the borders of the Evil Soul Forest, far away from the core region. The various factions had already entered the Evil Soul Forest. They shouldn’t bump into them at the borders.

Having realized how much they had progressed over the past few days, those brats were now reluctant to leave this place, which they had been desperate to escape from earlier.

The feeling of their powers continuously improving made their blood surge with excitement. They were at that energetic, vibrant age. Which youth wouldn’t wish to keep improving their powers?

Qin Feng approached Ye Qing late at night.

“Teacher Ye.” Qin Feng seldom came to talk to Ye Qing.

Ye Qing glanced at him. “What’s the matter?”

Qin Feng looked somewhat conflicted. He did not know how he felt about this teacher. Previously, he had already lost all hope and allowed himself to descend into an endless abyss. But unexpectedly, after training under Ye Qing, he had started to progress.

Qin Feng said, “My powers are increasing.”

Ye Qing smiled. “That’s a good thing, right?”

Qin Feng shook his head.

“Since I entered the Netherworld Academy, my powers have been deteriorating non-stop.”

Many teachers have tried all sorts of ways but to no avail. Likewise, he had also given up.

Ye Qing wanted him to plant flowers and he mechanically complied. He was just passing the time, waiting to be kicked out of the Netherworld Academy. He had heard Ye Qing’s teachings to Jing Ze and the rest. He could tell that this teacher was different from the others.

Apart from himself, even someone like Lei Yan kept improving under Ye Qing.

And so now, Qin Feng did not believe that his increase in powers had nothing to do with Ye Qing.

“I want to know, how did you do it?”

Ye Qing looked at Qin Feng. He was a man of few words but was a clear-headed youth. If not for the fact that she owed Qin Zhuo one, she might not have spent so much effort on Qin Feng.

“The Qin family has a powerful Killer Bloodline. But do you know why, apart from Qin Zhuo, it has been difficult for the Qin family to produce another powerful practitioner?” Ye Qing asked.

Qin Feng shook his head. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qing chuckled. “The Killer Bloodline is also the reason behind the Qin family’s decline.”

Qin Feng was taken aback.

Since he was a young boy, he had been taught that the Killer Bloodline was very powerful. But this was the first time he was hearing that the Killer Bloodline was the reason behind the Qin family’s decline.
