Chapter 66: The Birthday Banquet (3)

The Second Elder shook his head and said: “Tang Tang, that’s the Marquis of the City of Luoxing, a renowned dignitary. If Ye You managed to invite him, then I’m afraid from now on, the Great Elder will only act more audaciously with his backing.”

“It’s useless to cry over spilled milk. He’s already here; we have to put our best face forward.” Ye Ling heaved a sigh before he and the Second Elder went ahead with getting the attendants ready for Mu Su’s reception.

Ye Qingtang felt like laughing her head off.

In her past, Ye You was nearly slaughtered by Mu Su during their first meeting. Him accepting her invitation would be the greatest joke of all time.

While the thought crossed Ye Qingtang’s mind, a strapping and dashing man appeared in front of the main hall.

The initial clamor in the hall died down in an instant, and those city-acclaimed personages amongst the guests actually retreated quietly to a side, peering nervously at the man as he made his way into the hall.

The Great Elder heaved a deep breath. He could no longer pay heed to Ye Ling or the Second Elder, whom stood close beside him. Adjusting his attire and acting with his utmost decorum, he approached the man to receive him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Ling and the Second Elder followed closely behind.

Upon a closer look, Mu Su’s stalwart build, chiseled features, and dignified appearance far surpassed any man in the city, and the brilliant confidence he exuded directly reflected his immense prowess. Even as he approached casually, his demeanor compelled respect from others.

Duan Tianrao watched the approaching Mu Su with eyes of admiration and he spoke to Ye Xun in a hushed tone:” Who could have expected that even his Lordship would turn up for the Great Elder’s birthday?”

Ye Xun giggled and said: “Well, only Sis could come up with such a big surprise. Grandpa’s certainly thrilled.”

Ye Ling, as head of the household, took the lead and welcomed Mu Su.

“Welcome, my Lord. Please forgive us for any inconvenience. We’ve not expected you to grace us with your presence.”

Mu Su nodded indifferently. While everyone was in awe with his surprisingly composed and relaxed demeanor, he pretended to sweep an inadvertent gaze across the people in the hall, seemingly searching for someone.

Huh?

Where’s Ye Qingtang?

Mu Su was baffled, just like the time when the Si Household delivered her message to him. He could never figure out her intentions, but alas… due to an intimidating existence, he had no choice but to accept her invitation. Not to mention coming all the way to the Ye residence, even if he had to carry her back on a palanquin personally, he would have to do it without complaints.

The Great Elder, who stood next to Ye Ling, watched the admiring crowd with a smug gleam in his eyes. As he dared not act arrogantly before Mu Su, he addressed him with deference immediately: “What brings you here today, my Lord? Was it my granddaughter who troubled you with this invitation?”

Whilst the Great Elder asked the question, he glanced at Ye Ling deliberately from the corner of his eyes.

Granddaughter?

Mu Su had no idea who the old man asking the question was, but judging from his age and his seemingly reputable status in the Ye Household, he assumed he was Ye Qingtang’s grandfather and nodded in reply: “Yes.”

Mu Su’s informal answer was akin a glorious blessing bestowed upon the Great Elder.

With his conjecture affirmed, the Great Elder was all the more thrilled over this best birthday gift he had ever received.
