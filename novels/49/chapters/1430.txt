1431 Sisterhood 3

The tall man behind Jiang Qin was her husband, Tuoba Yao. His thick brows were furrowed slightly, and his aura was frighteningly strong.

“Forget it. It’s alright as long as the matter is settled. Take care of your body. Don’t be angry.” Tuoba Yao comforted.

Jiang Qin took a look at her husband without saying anything before she glanced across the hall.

“Where’s You? Why didn’t she come to welcome me home today?” Jiang Qin seemed to be blaming Ye You, but there was no hint of dissatisfaction in her tone. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Xun, who had been waiting in the hall as ordered by Ye You, heard Jiang Qin’s question and replied immediately. “Sister You is a little unwell today, so she is still resting. She told me to wait here and immediately inform her once you are back. Instead, I am overjoyed by your return and almost forgot about it.”

Jiang Qin frowned immediately again, and a look of worry appeared on her face.

“You is unwell? Is it because she ate spoiled food? Hurry, bring me to her.”

Jiang Qin and Tuoba Yao had been married for more than years but did not have any children. Her twin sister’s child finally returned, and thus, she naturally doted on Ye You like she would to her own child.

A smile flashed by Ye You’s eyes, but she concealed it. She immediately led Jiang Qin and Tuoba Yao to Ye You’s residence

At this instant, Ye You had a pale complexion and was laying on the couch. Jiang Qin’s sudden entrance into her room saw an immediate look of surprise on Ye You’s face.

“Aunt Qin? You’re back so early?” Then, she shot Ye Xun a look of blame.

“Xun, why are you so insensible? I told you to inform me once Aunt Qin returns. Why did you…”

Jiang Qin’s heart ached at the sight of Ye You’s pale face, and she immediately walked up to hold Ye You’s icy hands.

“You, what happened? Where are you feeling unwell?”

Ye You opened her mouth, but there was only a bitter smile.

“Aunt Qin, I’m alright. I just had a cold from last night.”

“Tuoba, request Physician Long to come and take a look at You. Quick,” Jiang Qin said immediately.

Ye You hurriedly responded. “Aunt Qin, I’m alright. There’s no need to trouble Physician Long.”

“How can that be?” Jiang Qin was very stubborn.

Ye Xun saw that the timing was about right and mumbled with feigned carelessness. “Sister You, how is this a cold? You were clearly bullied.”

“Xun!” Ye You berated.

However, Jiang Qin caught the key in what Ye Xun said.

“Xun, what do you mean by this? Who dares to bully my You?”

“Aunt Qin, there’s no such thing. Don’t listen to Xun…” Ye You acted as though she was unwilling to complicate matters.

Yet, Ye Xun said with righteous indignation, “Sister You, you are kind, but I cannot bear it anymore.”

Then, Ye Xun told Jiang Qin. “Aunt Qin, you’re unaware that Elder Xu brought a person back today. That person always made things difficult for Sister You and set her up when we were in the First Mainland previously.”

Jiang Qin’s expression darkened immediately.

“Who is that person? She made You so miserable. Just kill her.”

“But Elder Xu said that that person is a child of the Jiang Family, and there’s no way to touch her. You were not here today. That person is called Ye Qingtang. After Elder Xu brought her back today, she relied on the fact that she was a child of the Jiang Family and acted haughtily around Sister You. Sister You tolerated her once and again and is thus sick from holding in her anger.” Ye Xun embellished the story and made it as though Ye You suffered a great injustice.
