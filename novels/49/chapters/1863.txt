Chapter 1864: Fu Qiu (1)

Although Jiang Shaobai didn’t know how to gamble, his mind was much more flexible than Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo. After one lesson from Ye Qingtang, he quickly got the hang of things and they were completely in sync. By the time the first light of day broke, they had already gathered enough spirit stones and headed back into the Crystal Palace.

Everything in the Crystal Palace was crystal clear. Ye Qingtang found that even though they couldn’t see into the Crystal Palace when they were outside, they could see the outside clearly from the inside.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo had been waiting at the entrance all this time and only breathed a sigh of relief once they saw Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai enter safely.

“Just for one day. If you don’t have enough stones tomorrow, you’ll all have to get lost,” Fu Qiu said in a greedy voice as he puffed on his cigarette. His gaze kept deviating unconsciously to Ye Qingtang, his thoughts mysterious.

Fu Qiu kept its word after receiving the spirit stones. It brought them underground of the Crystal Palace where there were many small rooms which looked like caves. They each had their own room.

Jiang Shaobai took this opportunity to slip into Ye Qingtang’s room, where he ignored Ye Qingtang rolling her eyes at him and refused to leave. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Elder Sister Qing, please don’t be mad. I know my mistake now. Aren’t I here now to share the information I’ve gathered?” Jiang Shaobai said with a smile.

“What information?” Ye Qingtang asked Jiang Shaobai with her arms crossed.

“I managed to gather some information on Fu Qiu when I was gambling with the fat catfishes just now,” Jiang Shaobai said.

“Hm? Ye Qingtang lifted her eyebrows slightly. She was relieved that he was smart enough not to trust the words of the first catfish she met.

“I heard that they were originally nameless and lived underground. Fu Qiu is the only one in their clan with a name, and I even heard that it was given to it by a human.” Jiang Shaobai told her all the information he had gathered.

In the beginning, Fu Qiu had been like the other fat catfishes, nameless and living underground. But over ten years ago, a group of humans had entered this mystic realm by chance.

At that time, there were no places to offer them sanctuary. It was rumored that while ten people entered, there were only two to three left in the end.

But there was a wise person among those who had survived. That person found Fu Qiu and somehow, they became closer. Not only did the person give it its name, but they also pushed Fu Qiu to build the Crystal Palace.

It was from then on that Fu Qiu’s Crystal Palace became the only place that humans could seek shelter in this mystic realm. In exchange for reparation, Fu Qiu would allow them to stay.

Fu Qiu had become the odd-one-out the moment it had gotten its name and the other fat catfishes wanted nothing to do with it.

But Fu Qiu had managed to earn a fortune by offering shelter to the humans and had become one of the richest among the clan.

Ye Qingtang was surprised to hear all this. She had met many fat catfishes along the way and knew how stubborn they could be. Fu Qiu was the worst out of all of them, and she couldn’t imagine it being set straight by any human.
