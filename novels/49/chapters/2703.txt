Chapter 2704: Destruction (3)

With the roar of the Heaven-Devouring Beast, a gap seemed to open in the void, forming a black hole. Immediately after, a violent wind blew and cries of alarm rang out throughout the entire area.

Ye Qingtang and the others saw the majestic buildings in the capital being uprooted. They were sucked into the huge mouth of the Heaven Devouring Beast as if they were paper in a violent wind.

“There’s actually such a thing!”

The scene stunned all the disciples of the Great Immortal Temple. The Heaven-Devouring Beast could actually produce such divine might just by breathing!

Before long, screams rang out incessantly in the capital. Ye Qingtang saw that the humans in the capital were sucked into the void like ants by the Heaven-Devouring Beast.

At that moment, the number of humans in the sky was indescribable. There were hundreds of thousands of them, and they had become food for the Heaven-Devouring Beast.

Many humans who had been sucked into the void were powerful practitioners. Even so, they were unable to withstand the might of the Heaven-Devouring Beast. Regardless of how high one’s level was, he would be as weak as an infant before a Heaven-Devouring Beast. No one was able to fight back at all.

“Too… too terrifying. Heaven-Devouring Beasts are indeed as recorded. They can devour everything in the world with a snap of their fingers!” Cold sweat trickled down one of the disciple’s forehead as he stared at the Heaven-Devouring Beast in the sky.

“There was a legend that in ancient times, there were many tribes. An ordinary tribe would have a population of hundreds of thousands, but a large tribe would have a population of millions. Even so, the Heaven-Devouring Beasts managed to swallow countless tribes, causing utter misery and suffering,” Zhang Chi said.

Most of the disciples had also heard of such legends, but they had only treated it as fairy tales. A beast that could easily devour millions of people? How was that possible? It was simply unimaginable.

However, what they saw today completely subverted everyone’s understanding.

With one bite, the number of people in the capital decreased by half. With another bite, the capital would turn into a completely dead city. Apart from the High Monk and the Silver Star Holy Lord, no one else had survived.

Before long, the imperial palace of the capital was completely disintegrated by the violent wind. A middle-aged man swirling in mid-air appeared furious. However, no matter how powerful he was, he could not escape from the Heaven-Devouring Beast.

Apart from the capital’s royal family, there were many other supreme experts who were all swallowed by the Heaven-Devouring Beast. They were unable to resist.

Ye Qingtang stared at the Heaven-Devouring Beast in the sky with shock. Even if a fiendcelestial beast like the little white tiger stretched to its limit, it might not even last one round with this Heaven-Devouring Beast…

It was then that Ye Qingtang also thought of the big yellow dog when she looked at this Heaven-Devouring Beast. She did not know if the big yellow dog could fight with this Heaven-Devouring Beast.

“This is too cruel…”

Even though they were disciples of the Great Immortal Temple and none of them were kind-hearted people, they were still upset by this hellish scene. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This was a direct hit on the entire human race. No matter how evil one was, it was impossible not to react at the sight of this Heaven-Devouring Beast killing hundreds of thousands of people.

However, faced with such a huge monster, they were as weak as ants.

There were countless supreme martial arts practitioners among the humans who had been swallowed by the Heaven-Devouring Beast. Even those elite existences had been reduced to meee fodder…
