Chapter 1488 Gathered From All Directions 3

After seeing a part of the great demon’s body, Ye Qingtang felt that it was ridiculous that the Cloud Valley Clan mistook the small demon as it.

The toe of this great demon was probably larger than that small demon’s body.

“This fellow probably wanted to enter the forbidden area but died here.” A thunderous voice entered everyone’s ears. That was a plain voice, but its force seemed to be able to crush the organs of the listeners.

A one-hundred-meter tall demonic creature stood at the bottom of a mountain cliff, and a sole eye in the center of its face was squinted as it looked at that great demon’s body.

“Cyclops Demon King...” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes at that enormous Cyclops Demon King. This Cyclops Demon King never paid any regard to them when it passed by them just now, and it must have headed to this location because it sensed the location of the great demon.

This Cyclops Demon King dominated a region and was extremely aggressive. There were numerous demons under him, and they once wiped out several countries. It had a brutal nature and found joy in devouring humans. Several large imperial courts hated it to the core and joined forces to annihilate it, but they ultimately ended up giving the Cyclops Demon King a huge meal.

Ultimately, they were unable to kill it and could only let it be.

A phoenix caw rang at this instant. The Nine-Heads Demon Phoenix that Ye Qingtang and the rest saw earlier was hovering in the sky with groups of demons gathered behind it.

The Cyclops Demon King looked up slightly and scoffed at the sight of the Nine-Heads Demon Phoenix. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“So it’s here...” A cold voice rang as numerous shadows suddenly arrived in the air. They were stern-looking men donned in green robes who rode on swords. Standing upright in the air, their eyes were fixed on that great demon’s corpse.

“The Seven Saints of the Snow Zone...” Ye Qingtang was shaken when she saw the figures of those men.

The Seven Saints of the Snow Zone were the top powerful figures of the Central Mainland. Although the seven of them were not old, they were insanely talented and became renowned in a few years after becoming adults. Possessing different specialties, these seven people moved together whenever they were in an operation and remained undefeated to date.

“I never thought that the Seven Saints of the Snow Zone would also be joining in the fun in the Land of Infinite Demons.” A deep laugh suddenly resounded. As that laughter entered everyone’s ears, a huge demonic beast gradually approached the crowd from a cliff. That demonic beast had gold-plated armor, and on its back sat an old-looking elderly with sharp eyes.

With a bone flute in his hands, the elderly smiled, but his eyes seemed to be permeated with an icy chill.

That elderly was the Beast Master in the Central Mainland, and he could control all demonic beasts for his use with a bone flute.

Although he was alone, a troop with a million demonic beasts struck terror in humans. Back when the Central Dynasty was in chaos, the Emperor personally requested the Beast Master’s help. With just a flute and by himself only, he commanded a huge troop consisting of millions of demonic beasts and forced the enemy to retreat, thus stabilizing the internal disorder within the Central Dynasty.

In no time, more and more figures appeared near the great demon, and Ye Qingtang was shaken when she took a glance.

Everyone she met today was a prominent powerful figure of the Central Mainland. It was difficult for others to take one eye at them on normal days, but who would have thought... all of them were actually gathered here after hearing about the death of the great demon.

As Ye Qingtang scanned those top powerful figures, a dragon roar broke out in the sky all of a sudden.

Ye Qingtang blanked out for a moment at the sound of that familiar dragon roar.
