Chapter 2067: Complete Victory (2)

The Grand Elder should have received the news and taken the children with him. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Since he had yet to return, Elder Yuan and the others guessed that he went to look for help.

The Ancient You Clan had sustained great injuries. It was no surprise that the entire Ancient You Clan wanted to retreat and tried to pull out of the battle.

When Ming Di saw that they were about to escape, there was no way he would ever grant their wish. He wanted to chase after them but Ye Qingtang stopped him from doing so.

Following the Ancient You Clan’s escape, the clans let out raucous cheers of victory. At the same time, Ye Qingtang rode on Ming Di’s back to look for Mi.

Before she got off Ming Di’s back, she realized a handsome man was standing beside Mi.

The man stood right beside Mi and didn’t have much of an expression on his face. Ye Qingtang was shocked that Mi wasn’t hostile towards the man, and instead, was very welcoming.

Who was he?

She hadn’t seen him before.

Ye Qingtang brushed it aside and spoke to Mi. “The Ancient You Clan has been defeated. I’m not sure if they took the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos. We need to hurry up and go back to the underground world to look for the fragments.”

Mi nodded and discreetly watched the man’s reaction.

After seeing that the man wasn’t interested in the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos, Mi didn’t say anything more.

“May I know who this is?” Ye Qingtang looked at the man.

Mi was about to speak up but noticed the man was startled when he saw Ye Qingtang.

Mi couldn’t help but feel suspicious, but nevertheless continued, “This is my friend from the Second Domain. He had some matters to take care of in the First Domain so he came by to visit me.”

Ye Qingtang didn’t think too much after hearing Mi’s words, but she couldn’t help but feel a little curious. The Crimson League seemed indifferent towards humans, but now, Mi had good relations with this human. Moreover... Ye Qingtang could somehow sense that Mi respected this man.

Regardless, Ye Qingtang wasn’t planning to be involved in the Second Domain’s affairs. She had already brought littl5e You Yun back. As long as Little You Yun regained consciousness, she would set the First Mainland’s living creatures free.

With that, Ye Qingtang let the Crimson League enter the underground world to search for the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos so that she could prove her innocence.

The Crimson League found many rare treasures that the Ancient You Clan had collected over the years, but they couldn’t find even a single piece of the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos.

“The Ancient You Clan might have taken it away while they were escaping, but don’t worry. They will never be able to escape from this mainland.” Ye Qingtang comforted them, but she wasn’t surprised at the outcome at all.

The Crimson League hadn’t discovered the secret passage yet. The Grand Elder was dead and only Ning Luo, You Qiong, and herself knew of the whereabouts of the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos. Ning Luo wasn’t interested in them while You Qiong had already pledged loyalty to Ye Qingtang.

It was impossible for the Crimson League to be able to find the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos unless Ye Qingtang spoke up.

They were victorious and returned in triumph.

The Crimson League and the others returned to the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang went to look for You Qiong and Ning Luo once she stepped foot into the Temple of Shadows. Ling Yan was also in the room.

“How are they doing?” Ye Qingtang looked at Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue, who both lay on the bed. Little You Yun was unconscious while Little Luo Xue had a blank expression.

“Not so good. The Ancient You Clan must have cast a special spell on them and we’re not able to remove it just like that. We can only try to observe and deal with it gradually,” Ning Luo said.

Ye Qingtang frowned. At least they were back and thankfully, they still had time.
