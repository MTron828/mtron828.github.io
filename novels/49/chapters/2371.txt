Chapter 2372: Let Me Play (2)

On their way back, Wen Qi had told her about the spirit jade and how the Netherworld Academy only won one in the previous competition. The winner had been a medicine faculty student, and the spirit jade was placed in Wu Fengling’s care. Not long after, the medicine faculty student died in an accident and the jade was passed on to the Netherworld Academy student with the most potential, Ran Mo…

The Netherworld Academy and the spirit jade.

It had to be Ran Mo!

After overhearing those teenagers, Ye Qingtang instantly felt that something very bad must have happened. Wasting no time, she immediately hurried over with Mu Ziying.

…

In the backyard, Lei Yan and the rest were looking extremely grim. After several rounds, Lei Yan’s space ring was completely empty. Nangong Lie, Hang Wenwei and the others had also lost everything.

“My friends, I am truly very happy today. You guys have given me so many presents. How can I ever thank you?” Xing Rong was grinning victoriously as he gazed at the wretched faces of those few.

“Now, you don’t have anything more to bet on right? You would probably have to stake your lives now if you continue betting.”

Lei Yan and the others were trembling with rage but they were helpless. Their skills were really not up to par. Not only did they fail to win the spirit jade back, but they had also lost everything.

“Since you don’t have any more resources, shouldn’t you get lost?” Xing Rong’s face changed as he commanded coldly.

“Who said we have nothing left? Didn’t you mention staking our lives? I will bet with you using my life!” Lei Yan was consumed with anger.

“Forget it. Your life is worthless to me. Do you have anything left? If you do, I will continue playing with you. If not, please don’t stand there taking up space. Get lost,” Xing Rong said.

“You!” Lei Yan’s face was grim to the extreme. Xing Rong’s Illusion Beast Chess was just too good. They were no match for him at all.

“Can I play?”

A familiar voice drifted over.

The voice was like a clear spring, instantly soothing the fretful hearts of those brats.

Lei Yan and the others immediately turned to see Ye Qing with Mu Ziying beside him. When had he appeared behind them?

“Boss…”

Lei Yan was nearly crying now.

Xing Rong and the crowd of teenagers also shifted their gaze, only to see a mediocre-looking, skinny, frail youth in his 20s. But he was wearing the Netherworld Academy uniform for teachers.

“A Netherworld Academy teacher? This is getting interesting.” Xing Rong did not think much of Ye Qingtang.

The Netherworld Academy had fallen. There was no difference between their students and their teachers.

“What, this teacher wishes to play?” Xing Rong smiled.

Ye Qingtang didn’t waste any words but just sat down. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Boss, don’t play with him. This fellow’s Illusion Beast Chess is really very formidable.” Lei Yan and the others were panicking.

Earlier, they had lost so badly that they had lost their cool and thrown all reason out the window. Having been so utterly defeated, how could they drag Ye Qing down into the mud with them?

Ye Qingtang shot them a steady look to calm down before turning back to Xing Rong.

“What are the rules?”

“It’s very simple. We only play for spirit jades. Your side has already lost the only spirit jade owned by the Netherworld Academy, but I’m an easygoing guy. As long as you can offer me something interesting, I guess I can bend the rules for you.”

Xing Rong spoke magnanimously but his attitude was dripping with arrogance.
