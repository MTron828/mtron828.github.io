Chapter 2054: Frightening Might (2)

Ye Qingtang’s expression was complicated. She didn’t doubt the seriousness of his words at all.

After all...

Her sudden leap in strength already proved how powerful the red light was.

“No wonder the Ancient You Clan is gathering all their troops here.” She was still unsure of the reason previously but everything was clear now after she had experienced it herself.

The Spiritual Abode was extremely powerful. Just the power of the white glow on the pagodas was already letting out power from the Spiritual Abode continuously, strengthening the Ancient You Clan.

The power of the Spiritual Abode rose by more than a hundred times when the light turned red.

The streets had been empty when they had gone out previously. There was almost nobody in sight. Even the youths that were with Elder Yuan had been sent back to their respective pagodas and were not roaming outside.

This power was not something that everyone could tolerate. Ye Qingtang, who already had a strong bloodline as well as the Deity Ocean, was still knocked out the first time she encountered the Spiritual Abode.

There was no way Elder Yuan and the others would have been able to tolerate the massive power. Only the youths who had devoured the demon cubs and cultivated themselves could deal with such overwhelming power.

“If I’m not wrong, Little You Yun should be in the pagoda we entered yesterday,” she said.

Little You Yun was the only one who could control the Spiritual Abode. She realized yesterday that the red light had originated from that pagoda. The scream that she heard before the red light was a clue as well.

Ning Luo’s eyes flashed as he agreed with her deduction. After so many hardships, she had finally found Little You Yun. But...

“There didn’t seem to be any other youths in the pagoda yesterday other than Little Luo Xue?” She had only seen Little Luo Xue enter the pagoda yesterday. The other youths had come out from the pagodas when the red light started shining but Little Luo Xue had been standing alone outside his pagoda.

Ning Luo nodded. The Spiritual Abode did not affect him, so he had seen everything.

Ye Qingtang pressed her lips together. Ning Luo and her had almost been caught yesterday. It was lucky Little Luo Xue didn’t recognize her now, otherwise, she was afraid that he would attack if he noticed them.

“We have to find a way to enter the pagoda...” she said softly.

She returned to her room quickly with the news.

While he no longer had his high status, You Qiong had several tricks up his sleeve that he had used to make himself an Elder. He managed to get some clues from the Ancient You Clan people.

“From what I know, only youths can enter the pagodas and they seem to be cultivating there. They go in every three days and once they’re inside, they will cultivate for another three days. When they come out, their power would have increased significantly. But... there is one pagoda that no one is allowed to enter other than a little guy. Even the other youths are not allowed in,” You Qiong reported back to her.
