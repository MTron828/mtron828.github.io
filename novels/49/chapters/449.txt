Chapter 450: Spirit Life Flower (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This Spirit Life Flower was effective in improving even ordinary spirit roots, and for Ye Qingtang’s current spirit root, it would only be better.

Presently, she had to obtain both this Spirit Life Flower and the Black Heaven Water.

However, the Yunxiao Sect disciple guarding the Spirit Life Flower here was rather skilled as well. Although Ye Qingtang knew it, she initially did not intend to take a risk and snatch it.

Yet, she was forced by the situation. She faintly sensed a hint of danger from the revelation of Fu Lingtian’s identity. She had to increase the realm of her martial skills in the shortest time possible. Otherwise, all her lofty sentiment and soaring determination would be nothing but empty talk.

Between the clouds, Ye Qingtang looked at the area in the mountain valley which was the most abundant in spirit energy.

A male who looked below thirty was guarding near a huge rock where the Spirit Life Flower was growing at the top of the rock.

According to Ye Qingtang’s observations, the Spirit Life Flower was already ripe, and the man had not plucked it probably because he felt that the effects would be better if it was a little riper.

Ye Qingtang scanned that man whose cultivation was about Martial Qi Level Three.

Given Ye Qingtang’s Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two, it was a little too unrealistic to snatch the Spirit Life Flower away from someone at Martial Qi Level Three.

Over the past two days, Ye Qingtang had remained here all along and did not return to Xuanling Sect. The Spirit Life Flower was extremely effective to her. Before Xuanling Sect’s mystic realm started, the Spirit Life Flower was the only method she could think of which would raise her skills by the greatest extent. As the level of her skills moved higher, the speed of her improvement in skills would slow down. Ye Qingtang did not wish to miss this chance.

However, that Yunxiao Sect disciple guarded by the rock over the past two days and never left a step, which made it hard for Ye Qingtang to make a move.

If she stole it up-front, she was not an opponent of that Martial Qi Level Three person given her current skills, and she would never do anything she had no confidence in.

Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang never wasted any time while waiting for the opportunity as she consolidated her cultivation level in the clouds.

Even in the earliest hours of the third morning, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered as she looked straight ahead.

Then, a middle-aged man about forty years old walked towards the direction of Ye Qingtang.

“Tsk tsk tsk… My luck is really good… There’s actually such a beauty here in the wild.” The middle-aged man looked at Ye Qingtang with a sinister laugh.

Ye Qingtang glimpsed at the middle-aged man before her and was stunned.

Yi Tianchou?!

Yi Tianchou was the number nine on the sect’s Assassination Roll. He committed countless wrongdoings in his life and liked to seek pleasure with girls from sects. It was said that Yi Tianchou once intruded the residence of a prince in the Formidable Heavens Imperial City and tainted one of the princesses in the night…

From then on, not only were sects after his life, even the Formidable Heavens Dynasty listed him as a wanted criminal where one would be heavily rewarded for bringing Yi Tianchou’s head.

There were portraits of everyone on the Assassination Roll, and Ye Qingtang saw the face of Yi Tianchou in Xuanling Sect’s Assassination Roll gallery and thus recognized him instantly.

“Heh heh… girl doll… what are you doing here?” Yi Tianchou walked to Ye Qingtang’s side and beamed. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly and looked at Yi Tianchou, who was harboring evil intentions. A glint flashed across her eyes suddenly as she immediately put on a frail expression and looked at him rather nervously.

“I… I’m a Xuanling Sect disciple. I was training outside… and was injured by a demonic beast… I’ve not yet recovered now…”
