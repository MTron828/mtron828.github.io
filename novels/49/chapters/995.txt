Chapter 996 Ability (2)

“Don’t bother!”

An elder from the Long Family gave a cold grunt as he strode towards Ye Qingtang. He raised his right arm and grabbed at the space ring on Ye Qingtang’s finger.

“You really have a death wish.” Ye Qingtang stood motionless in the yard. Her bone-chilling look fell on the elder from the Long Family, who was striding over.

The elder from the Long Family was taken aback. He shivered all over. He had merely received a look from the Ye Family’s Eldest Young Lady, yet he felt as if he had fallen into an icy pit.

“This girl is certainly carrying a priceless Dharma treasure on her person!” The elder from the Long Family not only did not feel any fear, but a wild joy appeared in his eyes instead.

Today, all the treasures that the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family carried would belong to their Long Family!

“Ye Qingtang, if you dare to resist, I assure you that not a soul will be left in your Ye Family.” The elder from the Long Family looked at Ye Qingtang and spoke coldly.

“Braggart,” said Ye Qingtang.

“Braggart?” The elder from the Long Family was taken aback. He did not know what Ye Qingtang meant or why she had suddenly uttered these mysterious words.

Clank!

The next second, a longsword was drawn.

Clank!

And then sheathed.

This drawing and sheathing of the sword were done in one smooth motion. No one even saw how Ye Qingtang had acted or how she had drawn her sword.

However, as they stared stupidly, the elder from the Long Family emitted a heart-rending wail.

When they looked at the elder from the Long Family again, his mouth was full of blood. The tongue in his mouth had been cut off by the long sword and fell to the ground.

“Braggarts will lose their tongue.” Ye Qingtang stared at the elder from the Long Family. Her lips curved upwards slightly in an inscrutable smile.

This scene completely stunned the senior members and disciples of the Ye Family.

Who would have imagined that Ye Qingtang would be so daring! This was a senior elder of the Long Family…

This Ye Qingtang had dared to cut off the tongue of a Long Family elder in front of the Long Family’s Master, a powerful half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

This would push them and the Ye Family into an abyss from which there was no return! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Naturally, everyone was shocked. In terms of martial arts cultivation, this Long Family elder had already entered the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. Just what kind of powerful Dharma treasure did Ye Qingtang have on her person that even allowed her to cut off the tongue of a powerful cultivator at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three!

At that moment, Duan Tianrao was frowning. “Be careful. Don’t underestimate Ye Qingtang’s Dharma treasure…”

“Ah… it looks like your ex-fiancée is really daring… However, I am curious as to just how powerful her treasure is. Even our Long Family’s elder suffered such a great loss,” Long Rui said with a cold laugh.

“Rui’er, no matter what kind of powerful Dharma treasure Ye Qingtang has, she is ultimately relying on an external source of power. No matter how powerful the Dharma treasure is, it will belong to you in the end,” Duan Tianrao said to Long Rui smilingly.

At that moment, the Long Family Master let out a cold grunt. The terrifying force of the half-step Yin Yang cultivator suddenly permeated the whole area and shrouded the entire Ye House.

“Your Ye Family is outrageously daring. Since that is the case, from today onward, there will be no Ye Family in Lin Town.” The Long Family Master shouted sternly. He was intimidating even when calm, like a lofty and invincible true god, causing everyone from the Ye Family to turn pale and quake inwardly.

“Lord Long, please don’t be angry… Lord Long, please don’t be angry. This girl doesn’t have the sense to appreciate a favor and acted rebelliously. We will certainly punish her severely and hand all the treasures and Dharma treasures on her person over to Lord Long!”
