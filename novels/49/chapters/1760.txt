Chapter 1761: False Bravado (2)

Three earth fire lizards were killed in this manner, their heads bashed in without even a chance to retaliate. The little fiendish demons broke the thick chains and dragged the dead earth fire lizards from the pit.

“Great Sage...” Those little fiendish demons who had attacked those earth fire lizards so ferociously were now as meek as mice toward Ye Qingtang.

“...” Ye Qingtang shivered on the inside as she observed those earth fire lizards who had their skulls crushed to a pulp.

The fierce reputation of the fiendish demons were not for nothing...

“The earth fire lizard’s brain is the freshest and tastiest. Why did you do that?” Ye Qingtang suppressed the shock in her heart and raised her brows in displeasure.

Those little fiendish demons shivered like willows in the wind at Ye Qingtang’s cold stare.

“Great Sage, have mercy!” They behaved as if Ye Qingtang intended to eat them.

Ye Qingtang maintained her cold expression. “I will spare you this time.”

Those little fiendish demons immediately acted like they had just received a great gift. They thanked Ye Qingtang profusely and cautiously followed a few steps behind her as they left the pit.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang heaved a secret sigh of relief the moment she turned her head.

“You truly know how to act!” Little White Tiger murmured as it observed Ye Qingtang’s false bravado.

“Alright, I won’t act anymore. Let’s just throw ourselves at the mercy of these fiendish demons.” Ye Qingtang smirked.

She couldn’t even defeat the prey of these fiendish demons—it would be suicide to try and fight an adult fiendish demon, or even a baby one.

Little White Tiger’s face seemed to blanch and immediately stopped its teasing.

“No, no, you’d better continue your act. It looks like your skin is still pretty useful.”

Without this human skin, Ye Qingtang would be exposed no matter how much demon blood she spread on herself. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The earth fire lizards were sent into the cave. Ye Qingtang could not see what was deep within, but she knew there must be extremely powerful fiendish demons inside. Even from standing at the entrance of the cave, she could feel their mighty aura.

After finishing their task, the little fiendish demons gathered together to eat. They desperately wished to grow bigger and become adult fiendish demons, to possess powerful abilities and lose the fear of being eaten.

Ye Qingtang had been here for a day and none of the demons discovered her identity. It was only then that she allowed herself to relax a little.

Most of the fiendish demons went to sleep as night fell over the mountain valley.

Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to sleep. She was afraid of being exposed while sleeping. Consequently, she found a quiet spot near the entrance and sat down cross-legged. After making sure there were no fiendish demons around, she placed Little White Tiger on the ground and had it keep watch while she cultivated.

It would not be easy to sneak away under the watchful eyes of those little fiendish demons. Due to the war between the various factions, most of the fiendish demons went out in pairs and groups. Ye Qingtang tried to leave once during the afternoon but before she had gone far, she was discovered by a few other demons who asked her where she was going. They were going to accompany her in case she encountered demons from the other factions.

Ye Qingtang quickly threw out a few excuses before turning back. She knew that it would not be that easy to leave this fiendish demon camp. There were also a good number of fiendish demons guarding the entrance of the camp.

Since she couldn’t leave, Ye Qingtang had no choice but to try and cultivate while most of the demons were sleeping.

In such a dangerous place, every bit of extra power counted.
