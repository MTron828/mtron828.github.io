Chapter 2307: Divine Lord Stage (2)

All along, Meng Yao had been priding herself on being just below the Divine Lord stage. Now, this point of pride had turned into a big joke.

Even the most powerful practitioner below the Divine Lord stage was still below that stage. And the Mu Ziying standing before her was a true-blue Divine Lord level!

Meng Yao was just one step below but the disparity was massive!

Before the crowd could recover from their shock, Mu Ziying reached out one palm.

The movement looked light and gentle but the force created crushed Meng Yao’s sword into a ball of scrap metal. The palm then made direct contact with Meng Yao’s chest.

“Oof!!” Meng Yao was defenseless against the suppressive aura of a Divine Lord level practitioner. Struck by that palm, she flew out of the battle platform and landed heavily beneath the high stage. Fresh blood spurted out of her mouth!

Everything happened too fast and too suddenly. No one was able to react.

Mu Ziying looked impassionately at Meng Yao on the ground below, who was still vomiting blood. She turned and surveyed the crowd with malevolent eyes.

“If I hear anyone talk bad about our Boss again, they will meet the same fate as her.” Mu Ziying’s voice was as cold as ice.

That malevolent gaze made everyone shudder in fear. Who else would dare say anything more about Ye Qing after this spectacle?

At this moment, the hearts of everyone were filled with doubt.

Who could tell them when Mu Ziying had broken through to the Divine Lord stage?! Surely it wasn’t too long ago when she was just a pitiful little kid who was helplessly bullied by Meng Yao?

After Mu Ziying issued her warning, she walked off the platform and stood beside Ye Qing. As everyone watched on, she threw herself into Ye Qing’s arms with a cry.

“Boss, you have suffered so much!”

Mu Ziying sobbed wretchedly. She never imagined that Ye Qing had been forced to undertake such a bet. Unless forced to a corner, who would risk their dignity in a bet?

Was it really that important if they were kicked out of the academy? Without Ye Qing, they would have been kicked out long ago.

Mu Ziying could bear any kind of hardship or scorn, but she would never allow anyone to disparage Ye Qing in front of her.

This was her heart’s most precious, most respected Boss!

No one could make Boss suffer. Not even a god!

Ye Qingtang looked at the sobbing Mu Ziying, who had been a mighty and intimidating figure on the platform just moments before.

She didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry.

Mu Ziying’s tears soaked through her shirt. The warmth moist seemed to seep into Ye Qingtang’s heart.

By the side, Lei Yan, Nangong Lie and the rest also felt a tugging at their heartstrings as they watched Mu Ziying’s sobbing back profile.

When they heard of that bet, an unprecedented sense of rage and heartache had risen in them. It was because they had been useless, that was why Boss had been doubted.

Lei Yan took a deep breath. Then he leaped onto the battle platform.

“Student Lei Yan, I am here to declare a challenge!”

They would protect their Boss!

The crowd had yet to recover from the shock of Mu Ziying’s performance when they saw Lei Yan standing fiercely on the platform. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

That fearsome, murderous aura was completely unlike the Lei Yan they used to know!

“Who do you want to challenge?”

Lei Yan said in a low voice, “Hang Wenwei!”

Everyone was stunned.

Madness, pure madness.

Lei Yan was challenging the student ranked number 10 in the Netherworld Academy!
