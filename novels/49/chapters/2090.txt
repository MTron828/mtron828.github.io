Chapter 2091: Soul-Absorbing Stage (1)

Right when Ye Qingtang was still feeling puzzled, an old-sounding voice suddenly rang in the empty main hall.

“It’s her?”

Ye Qingtang couldn’t see anyone speaking, but the voice in question seemed to drift into her ear, as though someone was speaking right beside her ear.

Elder Bai nodded. “Yes.”

“Looking at her, I believe we’ve got the right person. No one else can imitate our Holy Lord’s bone structure to this extent. This clone escaped back then, but now, we’ve finally found her. I think that we can answer to our late Holy Lord now.”

“What has this clone been doing over the years?” Another voice started talking. It was a female’s voice, sounding somewhat casual.

“Elders...” The young man who brought Ye Qingtang in began to report on everything regarding the Holy Lord of Shadows to a non-existent audience in the main hall.

His expression was serious, as though the elders stood right in front of him.

However, Ye Qingtang...

She couldn’t see a single person.

How much stranger could the Temple of Paragon get?

“Hmm... How dare a mere clone claim to be a Holy Lord.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Forget it. Since we’ve already caught her, let’s just forget what she did in the past. We should just send her to the Soul-Absorbing Stage, according to the Holy Lord’s instructions and get rid of her.”

At this moment, Ye Qingtang was still bound by the gold chains. She couldn’t move, neither could she talk. She could only listen to them discussing how to deal with her as though she were nonexistent.

There were at least seven different voices but she could not see a single person.

Where were they?

“Elder Bai, we’ll have to trouble you to take her to the Soul-Absorbing Stage.”

“Alright.” Elder Bai nodded and he tapped the ground with his feet.

A ball of light suddenly appeared beside Ye Qingtang and Elder Bai’s feet.

The light blurred the entire scene before Ye Qingtang’s eyes. When the light finally dissipated, Elder Bai, Ye Qingtang and the young man appeared at a platform in the palace.

A mysterious, yet creepy-looking altar appeared on the platform, with radiant balls surrounding it. The balls wouldn’t stop emitting illusory forces that seemed to play with the mind.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Couldn’t they give her a chance?

At least a chance to explain herself...

She couldn’t say a single word to defend herself nor move even the slightest bit.

The people at the Temple of Paragon presumed she was the clone of the Temple of Paragon’s Holy Lord. They didn’t bother to give her an opportunity to explain herself and had already given her the death sentence.

“Elder, are we going to use this Soul-Absorbing Stage to make this clone disappear?” a man asked.

The Soul-Absorbing Stage had already existed when the Temple of Paragon was being built. As for the others at the Temple of Paragon, they rarely had the chance to witness the use of the Soul-Absorbing Stage.

“Of course,” Elder Bai said.

“If it’s just an ordinary person’s clone, we can easily destroy them. However, she is the Holy Lord’s clone, so we cannot use ordinary methods. This Soul-Absorbing Stage is able to absorb all clones. No matter how powerful the clone is, the Soul-Absorbing Stage can crush them before sending them into the illusory space and they’ll completely disappear...”

“But... this clone is not that powerful. She’s at most a Holy Venerate. Isn’t it wasteful to use the Soul-Absorbing Stage for a clone of this level?”
