Chapter 2757: Tian (6)

Outside the Demon Cloud Sect, the Devil Cloud Sect Paragon stared at Ye Qingtang in shock.

“Oh, so you know about Tian.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

The Devil Cloud Sect Paragon nodded. “I’ve read an ancient record…”

“Are you willing to follow me into the upper realm?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“You… are willing to bring me to the upper realm?” The Devil Cloud Sect Paragon looked shocked. “I… am willing!”

…..

The Divine Venerate Domain, Great Immortal Temple.

“Greetings, Tian!”

The Nine Heavens Saint, Feng Wuyin, Feng Jiuyou and the rest knelt on the ground.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

The people from the Great Immortal Temple knew that she had become Tian, but… this change in attitude was too sudden. Those excited expressions… were they anticipating their turn to become Perfected Immortals?

“Holy Lady!!! It’s me, it’s me, ahhh!!” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang with burning eyes.

“Little girl, why are you only here now? Are you turning your back on me now? I’m waiting to return to the upper realm!” The big yellow dog wagged its tail as it stared at Ye Qingtang.

“I’m here now, aren’t I?” Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog.

“In the name of Tian, I hereby bestow upon you all Perfected Immortal bodies. Follow me into the upper realm and help reconstruct it,” Ye Qingtang declared.

With that, everyone from the Great Immortal Temple vanished.

A moment later, Ye Qingtang’s eyes shone with heavenly might.

A woman and a man who looked similar to Ye Qingtang appeared out of thin air.

“Jiuyuan?!”

The man looked at Di Jiuyuan with a shocked expression.

“I… am not dead?” Di Jiuyuan was also in disbelief.

“Father, Mother, I will bestow you both with Perfected Immortal bodies to follow me to the upper realm.” Ye Qingtang waved her arm and the two of them also disappeared.

Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang and fell into deep thought. “There’s still not enough people. More people are needed to reconstruct the upper realm.”

“Actually, it should not all be humans.” Ye Qingtang smiled. “There are demons and alien races in my Deity Ocean. It will be no problem to release them then.”

...

Many years later.

Upper realm, Heavenly Palace.

“Tian, I will personally help you dress for your wedding today.” Di Jiuyuan sat beside Ye Qingtang with a smile.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Mother, just call me by my name.” Ye Qingtang sighed.

“How is that possible? My daughter is Tian now, the great Tian. How can I call you anything else?” Di Jiuyuan frowned.

“Tian, your mother is right.” The Evil Deity smiled.

Ye Qingtang said, “Grandpa, don’t encourage her.”

“Your mother and grandfather are right,” Di Feng piped up.

“Father…”

Ye Qingtang was speechless. She did not know what kind of potion Ling Yan had given her parents… they had pestered her into marrying…

“Tian is getting married today. Congratulations. I hope Tian can give us a grandson soon.” Ye Ling strode into the palace.

Ye Qingtang, “…” Another father.

The big yellow dog squatted at the side and wagged its tail. “Ye Qingtang, if you get tired of this position one day, just give it to me. I’m more experienced than you.”

Di Jiuyuan and the others glared at the yellow dog.

“How dare you!” Ye Ling shouted.

“How dare you!” The yellow dog sneered. “I am the second Tian, and your Tian is my junior!”

“Pfft, second Tian? You were dragged down from your position. If I were you, I would be too embarrassed to mention it.” The little white tiger glanced at the big yellow dog.

The big yellow dog, “…”

“Don’t say that. The big yellow dog is the second Tian after all. It has its dignity.” The little azure dragon smiled.

The little white tiger glanced at the little azure dragon. “Why are you here? Shouldn’t you be with Ling Yan?”

“No, I’m with Tian.” The little azure dragon stared at Ye Qingtang with a flattering smile.

The little lightning dragon laid on Ye Qingtang’s shoulder and stared at the little azure dragon curiously.

“Tian is getting married!”

…..

The Heavenly Palace was packed with people. Tian, who was dressed in a crimson wedding gown, married Ling Yan.

Late at night, the crowd finally dispersed, leaving only Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan in the Heavenly Palace.

Their eyes met and they pulled each other into a tight embrace.

Laughter rang out in the Heavenly Palace.

The end.
