Chapter 683 Skin (2)

“What?!” The girl did not dare to believe what she just heard as she landed in the hands of those followers.

Those followers received the orders immediately and held the girl.

The girl simply had no time to react. All she saw was that a man had already walked to her with a flaying knife in his hands. The sharp blade slit her soft skin open, and blinding red blood spouted out immediately!

“Arh!!!”

“How do you do things?” Shangguan Rui frowned suddenly. “She is too noisy. Pluck her tongue out first.”

“Yes!”

A horrifying wail rang throughout the black market loudly. A bloody tongue was plucked out from the girl’s mouth. A raspy and distorted scream was forced out from her lungs, but the people who grabbed her did not release their grip at all.

The flaying knife touched the girl’s skin, slowly skinning the warm human skin off from her body.

In just the blink of an eye, the girl who initially had a gentle and beautiful appearance had turned into a skinless bloody human, while the beautiful skin was handed directly to Shangguan Rui.

As Shangguan Rui looked at the beautiful skin that was dripping with blood and still had a lingering warmth, a twisted smile immediately emerged on his hideous face. Satisfied with the outcome, he gently rubbed it against his cheeks to feel the lingering warmth. An intoxicated expression filled his face.

“Indeed. A girl’s skin is still the smoothest and most tender. Keep it and bring it back. After processing it, place it in my Beauty Pavilion.” Shangguan Rui took a deep breath of the bloody smell and subsequently threw the beautiful skin to his subordinates.

The intense smell of blood filled the

surroundings. The buyers who were initially interested in buying female slaves were horrified by Shangguan Rui’s violent methods. When they saw the skinless girl who collapsed on the ground, their hearts could not stop quivering.

Shangguan Rui was born ugly. He had a strange smell and a few defects on his body. In addition, his father pampered him a lot. Thus, his personality was exceptionally twisted and violent.

Shangguan Rui’s greatest hobby was to collect the skin of the beauties in the world. Moreover, it was by skinning the beauties alive, and the skin would be stored after processing it. He even specially built a Beauty Pavilion in his residence which was used just to store his “collections.”

The regulars in the black market were

already no stranger to this.

If those girls who were waiting to be sold were in despair and fear previously, when they saw their previous companion being skinned alive, only an insane fear remained in their hearts.

They would at most be humiliated if no one bought them, but if they landed in Shangguan Rui’s hand, it would be worse than death…

The skinned person would not die immediately, but without the protection of skin, as long as anything came into contact with the wounds, it would cause heart-wrenching pain. This torture was a hundred times more miserable than death.

At this moment…

Those girls were already frightened out of their wits. They even pleaded for someone to buy them away quickly as they were unwilling to land into Shangguan Rui’s monstrous hands no matter what.

However… Who dared to snatch with Shangguan Rui? The buyers at the side had already retreated to a side quietly. Even if they witnessed everything, no one dared to utter a word.

Shangguan Rui’s eyes landed right on the remaining girls on the wooden stage.
