Ye Qingtang crouched down and looked at the stall owner. The stall owner was a middle-aged man whose cultivation level was around the Fourth Heaven level Divine Lord. From his appearance, he seemed to be an itinerant cultivator.

“Miss, what are you interested in? Tell me.”

The middle-aged man smiled when he saw that Ye Qingtang was interested in the items in his stall.

“That small wooden box is rather interesting. What is it?” Ye Qingtang pointed at the small wooden box in the stall.

The middle-aged man was taken aback.

“This?”

‘The middle-aged man picked up the wooden box.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. It was this small wooden box that had some mysterious connection with the Heavenly Demon Pearl in her body.

Holding the wooden box, the middle-aged man sized up Ye Qingtang. In fact, the middle-aged man did not know what this wooden box was either. He advertently picked it up a few days ago at the periphery of a certain holy land popular with treasure hunters.

‘The middle-aged man thought it was a treasure, but in the end, he discovered that other than being incomparably hard and indestructible, this small wooden box was completely useless. There were no energy fluctuations or any such thing, The only amazing thing was that it was so hard that it made

one’s hair stand on end. Even if the middle-aged man used the full strength of a Divine Lord, he was still unable to cause the slightest damage to this small wooden box.

It was also because of this that the middle-aged man placed the small wooden box in the stall. During this period of time, many martial arts practitioners were curious and asked him about it. However, the middle-aged man did not know the origins of the small wooden box. He could not explain it so no

one was willing to buy it.

At that moment, the middle-aged man saw that Ye Qingtang seemed to be interested in the small wooden box. His eyes darted around and he said seriously, “Little girl, you know your stuff. You can tell that my small wooden box is extraordinary.”

Ye Qingtang was stunned. When did she say that this small wooden box was extraordinary? She was just asking a casual question.

“Miss, to be honest, this item belongs to my great-great-great-great grandfather. It has existed since a long time ago. It is said that... it is my great-great-great-great grandfather’s Dharma treasure. Unfortunately, although this Dharma treasure has been passed down, the method to use it has been lost.”

The middle-aged man stared at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang could not help chuckling when she heard the middle-aged man’s narration. This person’s ability to lie through his teeth was indeed extraordinary.

If this wooden box was really as the middle-aged man had said, would he have placed it in his stall?

“Uncle, someone asked you about this small wooden box earlier. Didn’t you say that you didn’t know... Why has it become your great-great-great-great grandfather’s treasure now?” Feng Wuyin looked at the middle-aged man curiously.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

The middle-aged man, “...”

“Ahem, kid, I just didn’t want to sell it to them and so lied to them. How could I not know the origin of my things... Miss, if you really want it, give me a price. I feel that you are somewhat fated with my late great-great-great-great-grandfather... Perhaps you will be able to activate this Dharma treasure?”

The middle-aged man stared at Ye Qingtang.

Before Ye Qingtang could reply, the middle-aged man continued, “Miss... do you want it? I can sell it to you at a cheaper price?”
