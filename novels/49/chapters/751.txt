Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the blink of an eye, the sword in Li Jingwen’s hand was pierced right towards Ye Qingtang’s chest. It was at this instant when everyone felt that Ye Qingtang would die without a doubt.

However!

When the tip of Li Jingwen’s blade was half a finger away from Ye Qingtang’s chest, it suddenly stopped.

Li Jingwen looked in shock at Ye Qingtang, who lifted a hand up since god knows when.

That fair palm held on the sharp blade steadily and directly stopped that powerful charging stance.

An expression of shock flashed across Li Jingwen’s eyes. He could not even see clearly when Ye Qingtang raised her hand just now.

“Cold Winter Sword Aura?” Ye Qingtang watched the blue-colored sword aura slowly seep past her hand which held onto the sword.

The next second after Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, a golden flame suddenly started burning in her hands!

In just a moment, that striking golden flame slowly spread to Li Jingwen’s sword, and the faint blue-colored sword aura was swallowed by that flame almost instantly. The sword which initially had a slight coldness was, however, burnt by that golden flame!

The heat directly transmitted to Li Jingwen’s hand that wielded the sword, and the burning heat caused Li Jingwen’s expression to change.

Ye Qingtang looked up slowly at Li Jingwen, and the corners of her lips curled into a devilish smile.

“The approaching cold winter still can’t beat the heat of a burning flame.”

“What…” Li Jingwen was taken aback.

Ye Qingtang’s smile deepened. Suddenly, she blew the golden flame up by multiple times, and it was as though the golden flame wanted to engulf everything in the surroundings!

The blade she gripped was instantly burnt red by that golden flame.

Under the high heat, Li Jingwen’s right hand was burnt, and he violently released the sword handle.

In the next second, the sword that Li Jingwen dropped down burnt until it melted in Ye Qingtang’s hands

Drops of red molten iron dripped near Ye Qingtang’s feet and entered the soil, where smoke emerged.

“How can it be…” The excited Blue Cloud Peak disciples were dumbfounded when they saw that the sword was completely burnt.

The sword in Li Jingwen’s hand was personally bestowed to him by Blue Cloud Peak’s Peak Master and was made with a superior-grade meteoric iron. It could be said to be unbreakable and extremely durable.

Yet now…

That sword was burnt into a pool of molten iron…

Astonishment was written in Li Jingwen’s eyes as he looked down at his right hand which held the sword just now. Although he did release his grip in time, his palm was still injured by that golden flame, and pain from the burn spread out in his palm.

“Blue Cloud Peak’s top disciple is merely like that. Now… it’s my turn to make a move.” Ye Qingtang looked up, and the smile on her face was increasingly sinister.

Li Jingwen was alarmed. For some reason, an intense uneasiness snowballed in his heart wildly.

Before Li Jingwen returned to his senses, Ye Qingtang had already disappeared before everyone without a trace.

Li Jingwen was alarmed and instinctively stirred up all the primordial qi in his body. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However…

All of this was a futile resist.

Ye Qingtang’s figure suddenly appeared behind Li Jingwen like a ghost.
