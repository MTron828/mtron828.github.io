Chapter 1948: Betrayal (1)

“Domain Monarch, it’s a different time now. With your current strength, what right do you have to negotiate with the Ancient You Clan? Even I can kill you easily. I’m only asking you to hand it over to save you some dignity.”

The Domain Monarch narrowed his eyes. He took out a small fragment from his chest and pinched it in his hand.

The warden’s eyes lit up as he saw the fragment.

“Not a single fragment of the Spirit of Chaos can be missing. Isn’t obtaining all the fragments the reason you’ve been wiping out all the Ancient Clans? I’m going to destroy it if you don’t listen to me. then you will never be able to fulfill your wishes in this lifetime,” the Domain Monarch said coldly.

The warden narrowed his eyes and gritted his teeth.

“Alright, I’ll save you a bit of your dignity and let them go then!”

With that, Ye You and the rest were released on the spot.

Ye You and Jiang Qin exchanged a look with the warden before replacing their expressions with worry and picking up the unconscious Jiang Xun and Jiang Lang. They rushed over to the Domain Monarch’s side.

“Domain Monarch, you should hand the fragment over now,” the warden said coldly.

Seeing Ye You and the rest of them walk behind him, he breathed in silently and enveloped them in his power.

“Go now!”

The Domain Monarch shouted fiercely as the ball of light surrounding them flew up into the sky.

“You want to leave? It’s not going to be that easy!” The warden laughed coldly. As he said that, a figure flew out from behind him.

The Domain Monarch didn’t even have time to see what the figure looked like before a fierce attack came at him like thunder. He quickly retaliated but was still thrown back a few meters.

A handsome youth stood in front of the Domain Monarch.

“Domain Monarch?” the youth laughed lightly.

“You’re from the Nanlin family?” the Domain Monarch looked strangely at the Nanlin family clothes the youth was wearing.

The youth lifted his eyes slightly and ripped off the disguise he was in. “What do you mean Nanlin family? The warden doesn’t find this troublesome at all, does he? Why do we need such complicated antics to deal with trash like you? We should just kill you all.”

The Domain Monarch suddenly understood why he was in those clothes.

All he wanted to do right now was to make sure Jiang Xun and the rest left safely. He raised his hand and threw the Spirit of Chaos fragment out.

Eyes flashing, the youth leaped over to catch it.

The Domain Monarch seized this opportunity to leave with the people in the ball of light.

The youth immediately felt something off as he clutched the fragment with some strength. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“This fragment is fake!”

The warden’s eyes turned cold. He let out a cold laugh as he looked at the fleeing Domain Monarch.

Just as he thought he could get away with the people in the ball of light, Jiang Qin gritted her teeth, the hand in her sleeve hesitating for a while. But just as she was hesitating, Ye You took advantage of the Domain Monarch’s lack of attention and stabbed him in the back with a dagger.

“Ugh!”

In great pain, the Domain Monarch looked at his granddaughter in disbelief. A sudden pain ripped through his chest from the wound, disrupting his power and they fell from the sky.

“Ye You!” the Domain Monarch’s eyes widened at the unexpected attack by Ye You.
