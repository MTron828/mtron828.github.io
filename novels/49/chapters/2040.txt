Chapter 2041: Slaughter (1)

Elder Mo whipped You Qiong harshly with the whip but was unhappy when he showed no reaction at all.

“I allowed you back into the Ancient You Clan that day after seeing how pitiful you were. I didn’t expect you to bring such misfortune.” Elder Mo gazed at You Qiong’s bloodied face. He had no idea what he used to look like.

You Qiong didn’t stir at all.

Elder Mo was not about to let him go this easily and was about to whip him again when there was a commotion from within the camp.

Furrowing his brows, he abandoned You Qiong to go check out the situation.

He froze when he saw the scene.

The great Ming Di soared in the sky with a figure on his head. Behind him were over ten flying mounts, and behind those were a group of alien race figures.

“What’s happening?” Elder Mo looked at the silhouette in the sky with widened eyes as a sense of foreboding overtook him.

Likewise, the other members of the Ancient You Clan ran out of the camp. The two elders and wardens with Elder Mo ran out as well.

“The Holy Lord of Shadows... what is she doing here?” Elder Mo’s eyes were filled with shock.

The road to the west region that the Ancient You Clan had taken was extremely obscure. Only the Elders and those higher knew of it and anyone outside did not know the path.

“Elder Mo, we meet again.” Ye Qingtang looked down at him as she stood against the wind.

Elder Mo’s face was extremely dark.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, don’t be too arrogant. You’re just riding the coattails of the Crimson League!” he snapped.

“That’s right... So what?” Her mouth under the mask curved slightly.

Elder Mo was inflamed by her words. He had never met a more shameless person! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Elder Mo, surrender if you don’t wish to die, and hand over all the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos you have on hand. Maybe then I’ll consider sparing your lives,” Ye Qingtang said.

“In your dreams!” Elder Mo said with a cold laugh, but he was internally calculating the difference in strength between them.

They had three troops as well as over a hundred powerful youths with them right now. If they just went by numbers, Ye Qingtang’s side did not hold any advantage.

Perhaps they had a chance after all!

“I guess you’re choosing the hard way then,” she said as she raised a hand, signaling for the Crimson League to attack.

“Kill them all!” Elder Mo ordered.

Both sides clashed in an instant.

The number of Ancient You Clan youths and alien race people that Ye Qingtang had brought numbered roughly the same and they began fighting with each other.

But the Ancient You Clan had thousands of other people on their side who rushed towards the battle as well. Narrowing her eyes, Ye Qingtang gestured for Ming Di to rush forward with the flying mounts.

A dragon’s roar tore through the sky.

Ming Di flew downwards as he breathed hot air on all of them. The heatwave incinerated anyone who came in contact with it.

The Elders and warden rushed into the battle as well. They brought with them two youths as they rushed towards Ye Qingtang. She leaped off Ming Di as he swiped his tail at the two approaching youths.
