Chapter 788 A Fierce Struggle (2)

Ye Qingtang shook her head suddenly.

“It is not impossible if you really want me to release your son.”

“Just tell me any demands you have.” Qin Long’s tensed expression relaxed upon seeing that there was still a chance for a favorable turn.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the surrounding citizens and then looked at the vigilant Qu Xiangyang.

“You just need to clear Qu Xiangyang’s name in public, kowtow to him, and admit your mistake. I’ll release your son afterward.”

Everyone was bewildered by what Ye Qingtang said.

Ye Qingtang wanted Qin Long to kowtow to Qu Xiangyang and admit his mistake in public?

Even Qu Xiangyang, himself, was dumbfounded.

A gloomy expression filled Qin Long’s face as malevolence flooded his eyes.

“Insolent! Men, come and…”

Qin Long was about to act up, but Ye Qingtang suddenly lifted a leg and kicked Qin Chen’s legs.

A miserable cry rang in the air. Qin Chen, whose legs were broken, knelt on the ground immediately as cold sweat trickled down his good-looking face due to the pain.

“Stop!” Qin Long yelled loudly.

“How?” Ye Qingtang asked. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Wrath filled Qin Long’s eyes.

“How dare you hurt my son!”

“Mhm.” Ye Qingtang nodded. Without waiting for Qin Long to react, she waved her sword and chopped off Qin Chen’s left arm.

Blood gushed out immediately, and a strong smell of blood diffused in the air.

“Ahhh!” Qin Chen howled in grief and collapsed on the ground. He clutched on the area where his left arm was broken as his entire body twitched from the pain.

“I’ve already given you a chance to make a choice. Since you’re unwilling to save your son, I have no choice then,” Ye Qingtang said indifferently, but a trace of iciness suddenly passed through her eyes. She lifted her hand once again and the Demonic Blood Sword directly slashed across Qin Chen’s neck!

“Sto…” Qin Long roared in alarm.

But he was still one step late.

The moment Ye Qingtang waved her sword, Qin Chen’s head was chopped off, and the blood-stained skull rolled to Qin Long’s legs.

Qin Long looked at his son’s skull in disbelief, and fury filled his eyes.

“I want you to die! Chop her into pieces!” Qin Long felt every part of him ripping. He wanted to skin and devour Ye Qingtang alive.

The citizens in the surrounding area were astonished. After suffering under the Qin family for many years, how would they have expected that there was actually someone in this world who dared to kill Qin Long’s son?

And it was even right in front of Qin Long?

Under Qin Long’s orders, the guards around him attacked immediately.

This time, Qin Long brought thousands of guards and even moved the monarch city’s garrison over. Furthermore, the group of skilled people whom he raised were dispatched as well.

At that moment, everyone charged towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes slightly. Before she struck, a silver shadow suddenly flashed by and obliterated the front few people who were charging towards Ye Qingtang.

“Xiao Guai.” A trace of a smile emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at the silver wolf who suddenly blocked in front of her.

The silver wolf did not waste any time and directly used its sharp claws to tear apart the people who closed in on Ye Qingtang.

An unusual look flashed by the little white tiger’s eyes when it saw the silver wolf coming to the aid of Ye Qingtang.

“What the f*ck! Bullying the outnumbered?” The little white tiger shouted immediately and spouted a ball of white flame!

Anyone who was touched by the white flame was engulfed instantly and turned into ashes in no time.

Ye Qingtang had not attacked, but the silver wolf and the little white tiger had already killed near a hundred guards in an instant. With a wolf and a tiger on each of her sides, her fierce stance caused one to tremble with fear.
