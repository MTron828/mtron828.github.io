Meng Sheng was so angry over Du Qiang’s words that his face paled.

The level 6 Giant Lizard had such a thick, rough skin. How could one arrow kill it? If not for their long fight which exposed the Giant Lizard’s weakness, Du Qiang would not even be able to hurt the Giant Lizard even if he shot all the arrows he had on hand.

These Qinglin Sect people were clearly here to fish in troubled waters.

If it were any other day, Meng Sheng and the rest would have long gone up to fight it out with this group of bastards. But now…

Meng Sheng looked at his teammates from the corner of his eyes.

Apart from Ye Qingtang who was temporarily not present since she was in charge of directing the monsters away, others were already exhausted from the battle against the level 6 Giant Lizard, and quite a few of them even sustained injuries.

Amongst them, Gu Yanqiu, Qin Huan, and he were the best members of the team.

However, Gu Yanqiu was the main attacker and had depleted the most energy while Qin Huan had poison spat on him by the Giant Lizard because of the Qinglin Sect bastards sudden sneak attacked, and no one knew whether he would be able to survive.

Under such circumstance, how could they fight against the people from Qinglin Sect, who were fully armored?

Everyone from Xuanling Sect could clearly tell the Qinglin Sect people’s plan: the other party specially chose this time to freeload because they saw that Xuanling Sect’s condition was extremely bad!

“Why are you still standing here? Go remove the poison gall!” Du Qiang ordered arrogantly. He was certain that the other party would definitely not revolt. Otherwise, given Xuanling Sect’s current condition, they would likely be beaten up to death by them, much less be able to protect the poison gall.

Upon hearing the order, the Qinglin Sect disciple immediately went forward and used a dagger to remove the poison gall right before the nine people from Xuanling Sect.

A few of the short-tempered Xuanling Sect disciples were so furious that their eyes were bloodshot as they saw how the result of their hard work was snatched away by this group of thieves.

“Qinglin Sect bastards, I dare you, try to even touch the poison gall!” One Xuanling Sect disciple suddenly stepped up. Though exhaustion was written all over his face, he blocked the Qinglin Sect disciple’s road with a sword.

They could not lose the poison gall. If it was lost, all the hard work in this half a month would be all wasted!

“Then try us. Who do you think you Xuanling Sect people are? I gave you face, but you don’t want it. Not only do I want to take the poison gall away today, but I also want to teach you useless pieces of trash a good lesson. Junior brothers, attack!” Du Qiang scoffed and immediately ordered his senior and junior brothers to attack.

“f*** your mother, I’m going to fight it out with you!” Everyone from Xuanling Sect did not retreat and directly rushed up with swords in their hands.

In just the blink of an eye, the two parties entered a brawl.

Using the fact that they had way more people and were in extremely good condition, the Qinglin Sect people did not even give Gu Yanqiu and the rest any respect and attacked them mercilessly.

Gu Yanqiu pulled the poisoned Qin Huan and fought the enemies at the same time. While he had a composed nature, Qinglin Sect’s arrogant act of theft had resulted in fury to fully arise in him.

Helplessly…

Gu Yanqiu and the rest had already depleted too much energy while the opposing party was in perfect condition. In just the blink of an eye, the nine people from Xuanling Sect were already on the losing end.

Gu Yanqiu’s heart sank to the bottom. If this continued, they would definitely lose without a doubt!

“Senior Brother Gu, just go ahead and fight them. Leave me alone, I am fine,” Qin Huan said breathlessly as he clenched his teeth and bore the burn from the poison.

Those people from Qinglin Sect clearly noticed Qin Huan’s condition, and Du Qiang brought two junior brothers to circle Gu Yanqiu and Qin Huan. No matter how powerful Gu Yanqiu was, dragging an injured Qin Huan around already made him break out in cold sweat.
