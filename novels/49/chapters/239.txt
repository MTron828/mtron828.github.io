The little dragon man’s appearance turned the tables completely.

Its tiny frame possessed a destructive force, and the zombies died instantly when the dragon man passed by them!

Lin Long looked in shock at the little fellow that suddenly appeared, and goosebumps rose all over her body when she saw its extremely brutal attacks.

“Junior Sister Ye, that is…” Lin Long looked at Ye Qingtang. If she did not see wrongly, that little thing seemed to have jumped out from Ye Qingtang’s chest.

Furthermore…

That little fellow even called Junior Sister Ye… mother?!

Ye Qingtang chuckled and did not know how to explain to Lin Long, but she quietly let out a relieved sigh.

This little fellow was always so listless on usual days, but at critical times, it was still reliable.

“Senior Sister Lin, don’t care about that. Eat this elixir first.” Ye Qingtang took out a bottle of elixir and fed Lin Long.

Lin Long was infected with the Blood Plague and even suffered a sneak attack from Zhou Xuan. If she did not stop the bleeding, her life would be in danger.

Lin Long nodded slightly and swallowed the elixir gratefully.

The little dragon man killed all the zombies without restraint and returned all the oppression Ye Qingtang felt previously, multiplied.

Just when Ye Qingtang was trying to search for a chance to bring Lin Long out from the battlefield, a powerful force suddenly descended in their surrounding.

After being pestered by the zombies, the enormous evil spirit already neared Ye Qingtang and Lin Long. Its scarlet eyes filtered the wild battle out as it glared right at Ye Qingtang.

Its blood-stained mouth moved a little, giving out a screeching cry.

Sensing danger immediately, Ye Qingtang looked up and saw the evil spirit from not far away.

Her heart stopped!

When the evil spirit tried to approach them, the little dragon man broke a zombie’s neck and lunged to the front of Ye Qingtang, coming face to face with that evil spirit!

“Quickly leave, mother… I will hold it back.” At this instant, the little dragon was no longer as presumptuous as before. It fixed its eyes on each and every movement of the evil spirit, and panic rose within it.

It was temporarily using the lightning dragon’s body, but the lightning dragon was still very young and was simply unable to hold all of the little black ball’s power. Being restrained in the body of the lightning dragon, the little black ball could not unleash its real combat power, but it felt a deadly threat from the evil spirit before it.

This was not what it could deal with right now using the little lightning dragon’s body.

If it had a real body, whatever evil spirits… they were nothing to it.

But now…

It could not.

What was more critical was…

What a resurrecting evil spirit needed the most was vital essence, and the Heart of the Demon God in mother’s body could be said to be the greatest temptation to all evil spirit creatures in the world.

If the Heart of the Demon God were to be swallowed, the evil spirit would obtain power as mighty as that of an evil god! Ye Qingtang heard the nervousness in the little dragon man’s tone clearly, and the expression in her eyes completely changed. She protected the injured Lin Long while tightening her grip on her sword.

The evil spirit’s eyes wavered between the little dragon man and Ye Qingtang. Evidently having sensed the two powerful offerings, its eyes glistened with greed and savagery as it suddenly raised a hand, releasing a blood-scented smoke.

The little dragon man’s face paled. With a jump, it used its body to block the attack of the blood-scented smoke!

But this attack caused tiny cracks to appear on the little dragon man’s face, and a black fog slowly escaped through the cracks

This is bad!

The little dragon man was startled. If its aura was scattered, its power would subsequently disappear from the little lightning dragon’s body!
