Chapter 2745: The Truth (3)

Di Jiuyuan sneered. “Don’t even think about it. It’s impossible. My daughter… will never get entangled in the martial arts world in this lifetime. No matter what scheme you have, you won’t succeed!”

As Di Jiuyuan finished speaking, the star spirit’s voice turned cold. “You really are vicious parents. How sinister is this world? How cruel is it to prevent your child from embarking on the martial arts path…”

Ye Qingtang was astonished by their conversation.

There was no mistake. This star spirit was indeed the God of Nature behind the Void Door in the Temple of Shadows…

“It seems very obvious now.” The big yellow dog shook its tail and looked at Ye Qingtang. “This b*stard obviously wants you to enter the martial arts world, so he tried to coerce and entice your parents to hand you over to him. In the end, your parents would rather die than submit and even made up their mind not to let you enter the martial arts world for the rest of your life.”

Ye Qingtang understood even without the big yellow dog’s explanation.

Could it be because of this that her mother sent her to the Blue Sky Domain… the region with the least developed martial arts culture? She had even abandoned her in front of the Ye family residence.

Compared to the Dragon Emperor Clan, the Ye family of the Blue Sky Domain was no different from an ignorant fool.

Her mother’s motive was to prevent her from stepping into the world of martial arts…

“Star spirit, why did you try to force my parents to hand me over to you? Why do you want me to become a supreme force?” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply, completely unable to understand.

Could it be that the star spirit already knew her identity and opened the gate to let her train…

She had entered the star door twice, and each time, her strength had increased substantially. If she had followed the star spirit’s wishes and advanced step by step through the 10 star doors… perhaps she really might have become an immortal.

So the star spirit had a hidden motive. It wanted her to improve quickly!

However, after she went through the first two star doors, she did not continue because of other matters. She managed to break free from the star spirit.

But why?!

At that moment, the star spirit looked at Di Jiuyuan and sneered, “Did you think that I wouldn’t be able to find your child just because you sent her away? I can sense her aura.”

With that, the star spirit’s body emitted a faint luster.

After a moment, the star spirit spoke in a slightly off tone. “Where exactly did you hide the child? I can’t sense her…”

Di Jiuyuan sneered. “Of course you can’t sense her. The child is already dead.”

“Dead?” The star spirit was doubtful. “You can’t fool me. Although I can’t sense her aura, her life has not faded.”

“Very well. In that case, you can slowly search for her,” said Di Jiuyuan.

“Fine.” Xingling stared at Di Jiuyuan. “Since your child has already been born, you are useless to me. You two love each other so much, you can sleep here together forever.”

With that, Di Jiuyuan’s vitality rapidly dissipated. After a few breaths, Di Jiuyuan collapsed to the ground with a thud.

With Di Jiuyuan’s death, the scene returned to normal. Everything was the same as before.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered coldly.

Her father and mother had been killed by the star spirit!

“This jade pendant belongs to your mother, right?” The big yellow dog stared at the jade pendant in Ye Qingtang’s hand.
