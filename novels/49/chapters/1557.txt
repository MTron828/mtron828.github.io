Chapter 1558 Display of Remarkable Prowess 2

“Hmm? How are you at your limit already...” Cao Xu stepped on Jiang Lin’s head arrogantly. If Jiang Lin was not in the Heavenly Venerate realm, his head would have been crushed by that blow.Yet, despite so, Jiang Lin was already puking blood as he struggled to get up. However, Cao Xu was like a huge mountain, pinning him down and rendering him unable to move.

The faces of the Jiang Family youths darkened instantly, and they walked up to Cao Xu, who could not be any more arrogant at that moment.

The Cao Family members behind Cao Xu rushed forward as well. Both sides were face to face with each other, and a fight was about to start.

“What? Jiang Lin couldn’t defeat Cao Xu, so now you all want to make use of your numbers to fight us?

“Is the Jiang Family only capable of this? Is there no one else who can fight? There’s no problem if you all want to fight. We will keep you all company to the end.”

The Jiang Family youths had dark expressions and almost charged forward. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

However, before a fight erupted, a slender figure suddenly appeared in the air.

A teenage girl in a sky blue blouse landed lightly before everyone.

Before Cao Xu returned to his senses, he sensed a burst of energy charging towards him, and he instinctively retreated. At the same time, Jiang Lin, who was under his foot, was instantly pulled up by a small, fair hand.

“Xinyue...” Jiang Lin was extremely pale with patches of blood around his mouth. A look of embarrassment was etched on his face as he looked at the girl who pulled him up

“Cao Xu, you can endure beatings rather well, can’t you?” With her chin lifted slightly, the stunning girl glanced at Jiang Lin, and her lips curled into a sneer as her eyes swept across Cao Xu and the rest half-heartedly.

“I wonder if you’re interested in receiving a strike from me?”

Cao Xu’s eyes flickered when he saw that girl.

“Cao Xu, she is Jiang Xinyue, one of the extraordinary talents of the Jiang Family,” said a Cao Family youth, who identified the girl immediately.

“Jiang Xinyue? Ha... I haven’t heard of your name before. If you want to save your reputation, tell that little demon of your Jiang Family to come and fight me.” Cao Xu scoffed, completely disregarding Jiang Xinyue.

The little demon Cao Xue mentioned referred to the disciple with the best endowment in the current generation of the Jiang Family. At a young age, he had already defeated all the extraordinarily talented disciples of his generation. Although he had not officially revealed his skills to anyone else in this mainland, his name was already circulated among the big family clans.

Jiang Xinyue handed Jiang Lin to the rest of the Jiang Family youths and subsequently looked at Cao Xu with a smile.

“You want to look for him? Take a strike from me first. If you can receive it, I will immediately send him here.”

“Alright. I will receive a strike from you then. But let me put it out there first. Don’t blame me if you fail to injure me and instead cause an internal injury to yourself.” Cao Xu derided coldly as he shot Jiang Xinyue a look of disdain.

The Jiang Family youths were already annoyed with Cao Xu, and if Jiang Xinyue did not appear, some of them would have already begun fighting Cao Xu.

However, now that Jiang Xinyue stepped out, all of them remained calm instead and looked at Cao Xu as if he was a dead man.

“Receive a strike from Jiang Xinyue? He really dared to spout such nonsense...”

“Don’t worry. I definitely won’t blame you.” Jiang Xinyue chuckled lightly as her fair hands slowly unsheathed her sword. Her eyes were lowered slightly, and she appeared rather relaxed.

Cao Xu loosened up his joints as he stood at the spot glaringly while waiting for Jiang Xinyue to strike with her sword and embarrass herself.
