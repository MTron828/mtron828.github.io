1201 Blood Battle 3

In just the blink of an eye, the Blood Moon Elder had already fled out of the city and was nowhere to be seen.

That middle-aged man was too powerful, and the Blood Moon Elder could not rival him given his skills. Moreover, the Blood Moon Elder could not escape in the direction of the battlefield or he would lead the middle-aged man towards the battlefield…

Swoosh!

Outside a forest, the middle-aged man appeared once again before the Blood Moon Elder.

“Elder Yin Fo, you cannot escape. I’ll give you one last chance. Hand the kids to me or bear the consequences,” chuckled the middle-aged man.

The Blood Moon Elder gently placed Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun on the ground immediately and looked at them seriously. “Listen to grandfather… Leave this place immediately, understood?”

“Grandfather…”

Little Luo Xue looked at Blood Moon Elder with worry.

“Hahaha, don’t worry, Little Luo Xue. Look how huge my body is. I am unrivaled. No one can defeat me… Didn’t you all say that you all want to be as powerful as me in the future…” The Blood Moon Elder said with a smile.

“Mhm!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun nodded repeatedly.

“That’s right. You two will run away first. When I start attacking, there will be too much of a stir, and I’m afraid you two will be hurt by accident… I will find you all later, alright?” The Blood Moon Elder said.

“Grandfather… don’t… lie…” Little Luo Xue was still rather worried.

“When have I ever lied to you all… Are you all not going to listen to me and are going to anger me?” The Blood Moon Elder said in a furious tone.

Ultimately, Little Luo Xue held Little You Yun’s hands and ran ahead quickly after being driven away by the Blood Moon Elder.

“The two little kids… must be safe…” The Blood Moon Elder muttered softly as he watched Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun leave.

“Humph!”

The middle-aged man scoffed coldly and immediately flew to the sky, wanting to chase after Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue.

His objective this time was to obtain the reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode, and anything else was not important.

“Where do you think you are going?!”

The Blood Moon Elder hollered furiously, and he struck the man with his left palm.

However, the middle-aged man was extremely fast. He retreated backward immediately and avoided the Blood Moon Elder’s attack.

The middle-aged man had a clear idea of the Blood Moon Elder’s specialty: anyone apart from the Commander who was caught by him would die without a doubt.

Of course, the middle-aged man did not think that Blood Moon Elder could catch him either.

“Move away.”

The middle-aged man looked at the Blood Moon Elder and said coldly.

“Hahaha, you are dreaming!” The Blood Moon Elder snickered.

The only mission that Holy Lady gave him was to protect the two kids. No matter what, he would not let the Ancient You Clan lay their hands on Little You Yun!

“It seems that you’re just courting death.” The middle-aged man slowly unsheathed the long saber on his waist.

“Let’s see who will die! You or me!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted angrily and threw a punch at the middle-aged man.

“Since you are seeking death, as someone from the same clan, I can only fulfill your wishes.” The middle-aged man had an indifferent expression as he said, “Saber intent.”

Martial willpower filled the air instantly. Two bolts of light shot out from the middle-aged man’s eyes, and he slashed away with the long saber in his hands.

Puff!”

The fist that the Blood Moon Elder threw out was chopped immediately.

A small mountain-like fist flung afar.
