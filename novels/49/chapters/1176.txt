Chapter 1177: Heaven City (5)

Ye Qingtang was currently inspecting the foot of the city walls. The poison in the You Ancient Clan members was already greatly weakened, and many of them had a significant increase in their skills, with several Yang Lords present. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Ye Qingtang was a little helpless. Ling Yan should have laced a more toxic poison back then and kill all of these bastards…

While that was what she thought, she knew that it was simply unrealistic.

Ling Yan laced poison on a large scale, and the effects of poison would be greatly diminished once it dissolved in water no matter how toxic the poison was. Furthermore, most of the people from the You Ancient Clan were in the Arcane Supremacy, Divine Arcane Supremacy, and even Heavenly Venerate realm. Thus, it was almost impossible to poison them to death. If the poison was too strong, it would be easily detected as well.

What Ling Yan had done was already a great help to this mainland. If not for Ling Yan, this mainland would not have lasted to this day and would probably have been annihilated within several days of the You Ancient Clan’s invasion.

“Miss Ye just reached Heaven City… I’m afraid it’s not good… if she goes out to accept the battle now…” The injured elderly looked at Gu Yu and said with a frown.

However, Gu Yu shook his head and replied. “No matter what, Miss Ye is a Yang Lord sent by the headquarters. Although she is young, she must have a forte. Sending Miss Ye to the field would be the best. If she wins, we can also drive the You Ancient Clan out.”

“Uh…” The injured elderly was hesitant. What Gu Yu said seemed to make sense, but… that You Tianhe was too powerful and was one of the ten great young talents of the You Ancient Clan. If Ye Qingtang was highly-skilled, she should all the more stay in Heaven City to observe the fight. It was not too late to challenge You Tianhe after she completely understood him…

“Alright, there’s no need to talk much. Let’s decide it as such.” Gu Yu waved his hand and stopped the injured elderly from speaking again.

“Alright…” The injured elderly no longer spoke anything else.

Gu Yu was the overall commander of Heaven City, and others would oblige unconditionally once Gu Yu made a decision. This was the rule of the battlefield.

“Miss Ye, do you have any issues?” Gu Yu looked at Ye Qingtang quickly and chuckled.

“Senior Gu Yu is the overall commander of Heaven City. Since you have already made the decision, I will not have any issues,” Ye Qingtang said.

Obviously, Ye Qingtang knew what Gu Yu was plotting.

Before she came to Heaven City, she had already heard from the Peerless School Sect Master that this Gu Yu seemed to be very close to the Beiming Manor Chief.

Ye Qingtang initially believed that in the face of a calamity, everyone would be united to defeat the enemy. Yet, this Gu Yu was so short-sighted.

She should not be the first to go up regardless of any aspect as she did not know anything about You Tianhe. If she was the overall commander, she would definitely let the newcomer observe the battle first and then send them to the field once the newcomer had a rough understanding of the You Ancient Clan figures.

The You Ancient Clan’s martial skills and foundations were much more powerful than that of this mainland from the start, and hastily countering them would only result in the huge likelihood of death.

Of course, Ye Qingtang would not dispute with Gu Yu right now. After all, Gu Yu was the overall commander of Heaven City while she was a Yang Lord sent over to support them. Gu Yu indeed had the right to do this. Thus, Ye Qingtang would not comment much.
