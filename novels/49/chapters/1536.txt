Chapter 1537 Clinging On 2

The Ancient You Clan was the most savage one among the dominant forces. By contrast, the Jiang Family was rather kind and respected their ancestors greatly.You Qiong was filled with envy when he saw how respectfully Ye Qingtang treated Jiang Yu.

Although You Qiong did not speak this out loud, Ye Qingtang understood his worries very well. But Ye Qingtang had her own plans.

The Ancient You Clan’s powers had increased greatly after they had seized little You Yun. They were acting more and more arrogantly, and would soon clash with the Jiang Family. She herself longed to seize little You Yun from the Ancient You Clan.

Now, Ye Qingtang had two of the dominant forces—the Temple of Shadows and the Jiang Family—within her grasp. However, her position was not yet stable. These two forces were her bargaining chips in dealing with the Ancient You Clan. You Qiong used to be the most famous Great Elder within the Ancient You Clan. He was familiar with everything connected to the Ancient You Clan.

If You Qiong could help her bring down the Ancient You Clan, that would count as a few more bargaining chips. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ever since Ye Qingtang had come to Central Mainland, she had been plotting to obtain enough power to deal with the Ancient You Clan, be it from the Temple of Shadows or the Jiang Family.

Jiang Yu had also guessed You Qiong’s inhibitions but intended to ignore him.

But Ye Qingtang whispered to Jiang Yu, telling him about the Ancient You Clan’s current situation. When Jiang Yu heard that the Ancient You Clan had grown very powerful and that it was eying the Jiang Family, he also started to think.

But he did not trust You Qiong.

“Great grandfather, you and Elder You have been friends for so many years. If he returns to the Ancient You Clan in this state, he will certainly die. Why not bring him back to the Jiang Family?” Ye Qingtang unexpectedly spoke up for You Qiong, which delighted him.

But Jiang Yu frowned deeply. He did not know why this junior wanted to help You Qiong. Wasn’t she afraid that You Qiong would betray them after recovering his abilities?

But Ye Qingtang was not afraid that You Qiong would betray them.

The Ancient You Clan of today was different from what it was in the past. Also, once You Qiong entered the Jiang Family, the news of this would reach the Ancient You Clan sooner or later.

An elder who had lost his powers and had some kind of connection with the Domain Monarch? With the Ancient You Clan’s suspicious nature, the clan certainly would not take him back.

In fact, to ensure that You Qiong did not reveal too many of their secrets, they might think of some way to dispose of him.

You Qiong was just trying to protect himself. However, he did not understand that if he went to the Jiang Family, he would be severing his ties with the Ancient You Clan. Ye Qingtang could not allow such a good opportunity to slip away.

Although she knew this, she could not say it out loud now.

She must trap You Qiong first.

Jiang Yu was moved by Ye Qingtang’s persuasive words and reluctantly agreed in the end.

You Qiong looked delighted when he saw that Jiang Yu had agreed. He climbed up Ye Qingtang and crawled into the crook of her arm, looking extremely lazy.

“Scoundrel.” Jiang Yu grunted coldly.

You Qiong simply smiled and allowed Jiang Yu to scold him.

Ye Qingtang brought the two reduced little fellows and the little white tiger, and she flew straight into the void. Within moments, they had vanished from the vicinity of the forbidden land.

Just as Ye Qingtang was prepared to speedily leave the Land of Infinite Demons for the Jiang Family, her sharp eyes noticed a tumultuous battle scene from her vantage point in the void. She did not want to become involved. After all, the battles in the Land of Infinite Demons were neverending. Life and death were all fated.

But Ye Qingtang was startled to see a familiar figure among them.

In the midst of the intense battle was a detached-looking Jiang Qi. He was soaked in blood, and two elders of the Ancient You Clan were approaching.
