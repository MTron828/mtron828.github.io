Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang was confused. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I didn’t do anything.”

She had been sitting there in deep thought. What could she have done?

“If you didn’t do anything, how did this gold-gilded black box suddenly pop open?” Little White Tiger lifted one paw and pointed at the box in Ye Qingtang’s hand.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

She looked down at the box in her hand. She had been so absorbed thinking about the Jiang family incident that she hadn’t been paying much attention to it. She had just been playing with it in her hands.

But...

How did the lock on the gold-gilded black box suddenly just pop open?

“How did you do it?” Little White Tiger jumped onto Ye Qingtang’s knee and gazed at the box.

When the gold-gilded black box first came into Ye Qingtang’s possession, neither she nor Little White Tiger could open it. They had tried all sorts of ways but failed.

How did this gold-gilded black box... suddenly pop open?

Ye Qingtang was also puzzled. She hadn’t been paying attention to what she was doing with the box earlier.

“Quickly take a look. See what kind of Dharma artifact is inside this gold-gilded black box!” Little White Tiger’s eyes shone with excitement.

This was a Dharma artifact left behind by the Holy Lord of Shadows. It must be some extremely precious treasure.

The Holy Lord of Shadows had once been the most powerful figure in the entire Central Mainland. He must have had many valuable items.

Ye Qingtang was also very curious, so she lifted the lid of the box.

Inside the intricate box was a delicate finger bone. The finger bone was long and slender and looked like it belonged to a lady.

Astonishment flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw the bone.

“The Dharma artifact of the Holy Lord of Shadows is a finger bone?!” Little White Tiger was shocked by the sight.

All this time, Little White Tiger had thought that there must be some really powerful Dharma artifact locked up in this mysterious gold-gilded black box. But... it was just a finger bone?

The higher one’s expectations were, the bigger the disappointment.

“Whose finger bone is that? To be kept so carefully by the Holy Lord of Shadows.” Little White Tiger was full of curiosity.

Ye Qingtang also found it very bewildering. She took out the bone from the box.

The bone felt cold to the touch.

As Ye Qingtang held it, the chill traveled through her palm and spread throughout her entire body. She felt like she was being enveloped in a shroud of cold air.

Instinct told Ye Qingtang to put the bone back into the box. But just as she was about to, a loud boom went off in her mind and everything went black before her eyes.

Even then, the chill continued to assault Ye Qingtang and she felt like she was submerged in ice.

Gradually, faint beams of light started to pierce through the blackness before her.

A tall, strapping man was standing amongst the clouds, his back towards her as thunderclouds were swirling high up in the sky. Although Ye Qingtang couldn’t see his face, his tense shoulders revealed his anxiety.

The man seemed to be facing off something. He had a sword in one hand, while the other was shielding her.

The image flashed by too quickly. Before Ye Qingtang could get a clearer look, the man had already disappeared.

When her vision cleared once again, Ye Qingtang was sitting in front of a mirror and combing her long hair. The mirror reflected Ye Qingtang’s face.

Dozens of images flashed by, filling Ye Qingtang’s mind to the brim. She felt waves of intense pain as if her head was going to explode any second.
