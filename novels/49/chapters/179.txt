His Highness was being carried…

And it was even by a girl in! Bridal! Style! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Mu Su simply did not dare to believe the scene he witnessed.

But just when Mu Su was shocked that his legs turned into jelly, Ye Qingtang had long carried His Highness and ran away like a wisp of vapor!

Mu Su was violently alarmed as he dashed after her with a broken-down expression!

Lady Ye! Put him down!

Put His Highness down ASAP!!

If you like wolves, I can even catch a pack of them for you. But put down His Highness, please…

On the other side, Ye Qingtang’s annoyance over all sorts of accidents in the Giant Rock Canyon was completely gone because she gained such a precious wolf. She was so happy carrying the sleeping wolf that her feet were as light as feathers.

The Giant Rock Canyon’s magma eruption gradually stabilized. This time, Ye Qingtang did not encounter any more irritable incidents as she carried the wolf cheerfully and searched for her senior brothers.

What Ye Qingtang was unaware of was that halfway through her journey, the wolf’s originally tightly-shut eyes opened, and a violent, murderous aura rushed out from its eyes as though it wanted to summon an apocalypse…

However, in the next second, the silver wolf saw a familiar face and, at the same time, felt a cold air which continuously flowed from her chest area and slowly swallowed the uncontrollable Aura of the Evil within him.

The brutal expression in its eyes disappeared as it fell into a trance in an instant.

Ye Qingtang…

“Don’t be scared… I won’t abandon you…”

It heard the girl’s ever-gentle comforting words as her soft hands lightly caressed its head, ears…

The silver wolf wanted to move but discovered a fact that stunned him—

At this moment, he was being carried in the arms… of a tiny girl…

Perhaps… continue pretending to unconscious… was better…

At the entrance of the Giant Rock Canyon, Gu Yanqiu and the rest looked fearfully at the canyon which was swallowed by lava. As they saw the temperature of the magma decreasing and the crimson patch being slowly covered by an ash-black, they could not help but regard the power of mother nature with reverence.

“Is everyone here?” Gu Yanqiu took a glance at the other disciples.

While the eruption was sudden, it was good that Ye Qingtang warned them in time, and they were pretty skilled, so all of them escaped out.

Qin Huan looked around, and his expression turned ugly.

“Junior Sister Ye…”

Nine out of ten of them had returned, and only Ye Qingtang was missing.

At that time, everyone’s expressions turned extremely ugly.

“Junior Brother Qin, stay here and keep a lookout. Junior Brother Meng and I will search nearby. Junior Sister Ye is sharp and intelligent and would probably not have any accidents,” Gu Yanqiu said with a frown.

Meng Sheng nodded immediately.

But just when they were ready to leave in search for Ye Qingtang, a worried-looking Qin Huan suddenly saw a figure running towards them at high speed.

“Junior… Junior Sister Ye?” The worry on his face was frozen the instant he saw Ye Qingtang, and surprise subsequently filled his eyes as he watched Ye Qingtang dashing towards them with a big unknown thing in her hands.

“Senior Brother Qin, all of you are out already?” Ye Qingtang obediently stood before her senior brothers while carrying her precious wolf.

The group of them who were initially full of worry for Ye Qingtang immediately gathered forward. But just when they noticed that Ye Qingtang not only escaped but also carried such a huge silver wolf in her arms, a look of horror appeared on their faces.
