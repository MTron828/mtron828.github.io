Chapter 2650 Black Tower (3)

“Miss Ye Yue… just call me Ah Yao,” said the woman in white.

“Ah Yao…” Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. This name was very familiar to her.

Back in her era, she had also been called Ah Yao by the Holy Son of Shadows. However, the Ah Yao that the Holy Son referred to was the Holy Lord of Shadows and just a clone. This Ah Yao in front of her was the real original body, the supreme Paragon of the Temple of Paragon in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

“Miss Ah Yao… what a nice name.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Miss Ye is really good with words. I saw that Miss Ye was attracted by this pitch-black tower just now, but this tower is a little strange. There is a monstrous demonic aura surrounding it. It’s best if Miss Ye doesn’t get too close,” the woman in white cautioned.

Ye Qingtang had already discovered this. However, she felt that something was amiss. This tower seemed to be inexplicably linked to her. It was precisely because of this connection that Ye Qingtang fell into a trance and wanted to enter to take a look.

“I keep feeling that this tower… seems to be linked to me in some way.” The Temple of Paragon’s Paragon suddenly said in a subconscious manner.

Ye Qingtang’s expression became even more bewildered. She looked at the Paragon.

The two of them were thinking the same thought… Why? Could it be that this black tower had some kind of magical power that made everyone who saw it have such thoughts? Or could it be…

“Ah Yao, do you want to go in together to take a look?” Ye Qingtang suggested to the Paragon. Ye Qingtang was not confident of entering the tower alone. However, if she brought this Paragon in with her, she believed that they would be able to escape in time if there was any danger. After all, this was an Immortal Emperor.

The Paragon was clearly tempted by Ye Qingtang’s suggestion. It was true that the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon was indeed very curious about this black tower. She kept feeling that it was linked to her, and it should be no problem to just take a look.

In the end, the Paragon nodded at Ye Qingtang.

“Let’s go and take a look then….but before we do this, I’m a little curious if Miss Ye Yue is from the Divine Venerate Domain?” The woman in white stared at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang did not know why the Paragon was suddenly asking this question. Nevertheless, she shook her head very honestly and said, “I’m the same as you, Ah Yao. I’m not from the Divine Venerate Domain. I am also from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Oh?!”

Surprise flashed across the Paragon’s eyes when she heard Ye Qingtang’s reply. “That’s really strange. Miss Ye Yue is also from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain… but with Miss Ye’s skills, I should have already known of you if you are really from that domain.”

An Illusionary Emperor level practitioner was considered one of the top experts in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. There was no Illusionary Emperor level cultivator who was unknown in that domain.

The Temple of Paragon’s Paragon was curious how Ye Qingtang managed to remain anonymous in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

“I came to the Divine Venerate Domain a long time ago…” Ye Qingtang found a random reason.

“Yes, I wonder if Miss Ye Yue has any plans to return to your hometown… a few years ago, I created the Temple of Paragon in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain but am currently short of manpower. If Miss Ye Yue has any plans to return, you can come to my Temple of Paragon and manage it with me.” The woman in white smiled at Ye Qingtang.
