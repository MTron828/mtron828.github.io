The big demon’s body was decomposing rapidly. If this continued to drag on, they would miss the optimal timing even if they managed to seize the big demon’s body. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

By then, all the major forces had grasped the situation. They exchanged glances and made up their minds.

“We are definitely taking this big demon.” The person in the Ancient You Clan’s golden carriage spoke once more. The moment he spoke, a golden glow suddenly shimmered around the thirty-plus elders of the Ancient You Clan. Their aura instantly multiplied.

In a moment, all the human forces were ready for battle.

The eight tribe leaders from the Temple of Shadows let out deafening roars.

The twelve demon kings thundered as the little demons behind them bayed, poised to attack.

The battle was imminent...

When Ye You saw the scene unfold, she subconsciously retreated by a step. At that moment, everyone’s attention was focused on the battle that was about to erupt. Her movements did not seem to attract any attention.

But two people noticed Ye You’s retreat.

One of them was Ye Qingtang. She glanced at Ye You, and a cold smile crossed her lips. But she looked away, only to see that Jiang Qi, who had remained silent all this while, cast a calm and fleeting glance at Ye You.

It was just a glance, and Jiang Qi remained expressionless. However, a faint look of disdain seemed to surface in his eyes.

The moment Jiang Qi looked away, the spirit energy around him rose to its peak. The strength of his aura shocked Ye Qingtang.

This Jiang Qi is no less powerful than Bai Lixi?

At that point, Ye Qingtang finally understood why Jiang Qi had not said a single word to anyone during their journey. To Jiang Qi, all of them probably did not exist.

After all...

Compared to his talent, the little ability that Ye You and the others possessed was laughable.

The battle was about to begin; all sides were fully prepared.

The Cyclops Demon King led the charge. The demonic aura around him seemed to transform into a gigantic vortex that reached the sky.

But the moment the Cyclops Demon King charged forward, the mountain range behind the demon hordes suddenly began to quake violently.

Behind the mist-covered mountain peaks, a black palm suddenly appeared. It was so huge that it blotted out the sun .

Only for an instant!

The huge black palm was large enough to smash the mountains into pieces. It seemed to rise straight out of the ground behind the mountain peaks, and it suddenly came crashing down!

A gale blew as the huge palm swept through the entire battle field as countless boulders were sent flying towards the horizon. The gale swept up the flowing river, and the entire river instantly dried up.

Boulders... the river... All of these were mixed together by the wild wind.

Everyone widened their eyes as the huge palm that seemed to cover the entire sky descended towards the ground!

The Cyclops Demon King and the horde of small demons only had enough time to sense a suffocating demonic aura surge forth from behind them; before they could turn around, the gigantic black shadow engulfed them.

Boom!

The huge palm crushed the Cyclops Demon King and all the small demons. The force of the impact caused the entire ground to sink by a few meters!

“This... What’s going on...” Jiang Shangyu looked startled. He looked over only to see that the supposedly dead big demon had suddenly started to move!

As the body of the big demon arose, the surrounding mountain peaks—ones that touched the clouds—were instantly crushed into smithereens...
