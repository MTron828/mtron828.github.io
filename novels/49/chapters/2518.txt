Chapter 2519: Dog Is Angry (2)

Ye Qingtang already had an idea from before and had always wanted to try it out. Now she could use these people as a trial.

There were two outcomes when using the Deity Ocean. The first outcome was to directly enter the Deity Ocean space. The second outcome was the Divine Concealment Spell.

In such an uncertain situation, Ye Qingtang would pretend to concede defeat and approach those elders, before using the power of the Deity Ocean. If she was lucky, she could bring them into the Deity Ocean space. At the very least, she could activate the Divine Concealment spell. Those elders would not be able to do anything to her then.

Ye Qingtang gave a secret smile. The Yongle Tribe General Tribe had always loved human skin. If she brought these people into the Yongle Tribe, she believed that the Yongle Tribe General would definitely like them…

Even if they were not directly transported to the Yongle Tribe, many other demons liked human skin and were as obsessed as the Yongle Tribe General. Those demons would definitely be very interested in such a gift.

“Attack.”

Before Ye Qingtang could ponder further, the golden book elder gave a cold shout.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered and she shouted, “Fine, fine, fine. You guys are too formidable. I admit defeat. I’ll leave with you guys, alright?”

The golden book elder waved his hand and stopped his men’s attack. He then sized up Ye Qingtang and laughed coldly. “You do know your place after all.”

“Holy Lady, are we leaving with them just like that? Didn’t you say you would rather die than submit?” The Blood Moon Elder had been willing to risk his life but was surprised by Ye Qingtang’s sudden concession.

“You can go if you want to. I’m not going. Little girl, you won’t make things difficult for a dog, right?” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang.

However, Ye Qingtang did not have any intention of letting go of the big yellow dog. She laughed softly and said, “That won’t do. We are friends who have gone through thick and thin together. I definitely cannot leave you behind.”

“Unless…” Without giving the big yellow dog a chance to speak, Ye Qingtang continued,” Unless you show your true powers and chase these people away. What do you think?”

Ye Qingtang believed that as long as the big yellow dog was willing, it would definitely be able to do it. After all, back at the Wailing Well, the big yellow dog had killed an above-Emperor level monster in one move. Also, in the Deity Ocean realm, she did not know what the big yellow dog did, but it managed to frighten the West Sea Tribe General.

In Ye Qingtang’s opinion, the big yellow dog was really hiding its abilities. There was no way she would let it off just like that.

After hearing what Ye Qingtang said, the big yellow dog was a little anxious. “I wish. Look, if I could defeat them, would I still need to wait for you to speak? I would have already slapped them to death long ago. Why would I let these people bully me like this? Little girl, don’t you agree?”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog in disdain. Keep pretending. Let’s see how long it could keep up its pretense. It was clearly a god-like dog, yet it wanted to pretend to be weak. What was its purpose?

If the big yellow dog was willing to help, the matter would have been resolved long ago. Why was it still trying to squirm its way out of this?

Looking at the big yellow dog in her arms, Ye Qingtang started to miss her little white tiger.

If Little White Tiger was here now… damn, forget it. If that thing was here, it would probably flee even faster than the dog.

“Holy Lady, don’t be afraid. I’ll cover you while you run.. My skills are not good, but…” The Blood Moon Elder stared at Ye Qingtang and fell into silence. He seemed to be utterly helpless now…Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎
