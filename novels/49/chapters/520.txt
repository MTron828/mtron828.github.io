“Yes. Elder Qu lost his life in the battle that year.” The Blood Moon Division Head nodded after remaining silent for a moment.

“Lost his life in the battle?” Ye Qingtang suddenly sneered. “As the Blood Moon Division Head here, don’t you know that Elder Qu did not die in the battle but surrendered to Yunxiao Sect?!”

“WHAT?!”

Upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the Blood Moon Division Head was utterly shocked and could not believe what he heard.

Elder Qu was loyal and devoted to the Blood Moon Sect. How could he surrender to Yunxiao Sect?

However, since this was said by Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Division Head did not have any doubts at all.

“Elder Qu actually surrendered to Yunxiao Sect. How can it be…”

Blood Demon, Soul Severing Troll, and other Branch Masters exchanged a look, with expressions of shock written on their faces. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Humph!” Ye Qingtang scoffed and swung her sleeves. “You aren’t even aware that Elder Qu surrendered to Yunxiao Sect. How are you doing your job as the Division Head here!”

“Please pardon me, Guardian. I should die!”

Seeing that the Guardian was infuriated, the Blood Moon Division Head knelt down immediately, and all the Branch Masters followed.

The Blood Moon Elder was originally having tea, but seeing that everyone was on their knees, he could only put his cup down and hurriedly kneel down.

“Should die?” A cold glint flickered in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. “You all indeed should die! Elder Qu is an elder in your division here. I’ll have you all tell me what should be done then!”

“A Blood Moon Sect betrayer and all his relatives should be executed!” The Blood Moon Division Head replied.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up into an unknown smile. This was her motive exactly.

If she ordered the Blood Moon Sect members who were still recuperating to protect Xuanling Sect for no reason, it would definitely arouse suspicions.

Yet, by using Elder Qu as an excuse, it would be right and proper, and no one would suspect her. The Blood Moon Elder told her the information regarding Elder Qu on the way, and she already planned all of this.

Ye Qingtang is so meticulous and shrewd. Is she really only fifteen years old…

The Blood Moon Elder could not help but eye Ye Qingtang.

However, the blood moon symbol on her glabella and her Blood Moon Aura are definitely real… What happened exactly? Could it be that… her sworn brother is really the Blood Moon Holy Lord of the Blood Moon Sect?!

The sworn sister of the Blood Moon Holy Lord?… At that thought, the Blood Moon Elder no longer dared to continue thinking. If that was really the case, even if their Sect Master met Ye Qingtang, he also had to be reverent and respectful…

Recalling how he wanted to kill Ye Qingtang previously, a chill ran down the Blood Moon Elder’s spine.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang scanned across everyone. “Currently, that Elder Qu is extremely high-ranked in Yunxiao Sect. To kill him, you must destroy the entire Yunxiao Sect. Can you all do it?”

“Rest assured, Guardian!” The Blood Moon Division Head knelt on a knee. “Although our division cannot be compared to our peak years back then, we have been recuperating for a long time. Although we cannot annihilate Yunxiao Sect, we would not be any weaker than them!”

It was not only Elder Qu. When Blood Moon Sect was wiped out back then, Yunxiao Sect also participated in it. Even without Elder Qu’s incident, the Blood Moon Sect would definitely take part in punishing all the powerful forces that annihilated Blood Moon Sect once they were completely resurrected.

“I have just resurrected, and my martial skills are still very weak. I cannot lead you all to annihilate Yunxiao Sect directly by force. However, I heard that Yunxiao Sect would attack Xuanling Sect soon and would thus send out a portion of the sect’s forces…” Ye Qingtang said.
