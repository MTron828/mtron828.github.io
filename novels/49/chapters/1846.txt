Chapter 1847: Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm (2)

But at least it felt more normal than the mystic realm with the Cursed True God in it.

“Does this mean that we’re still in the mystic realm? We’ve only switched from the creepy mystic realm to this mystic realm that we were originally supposed to enter?” Jiang Shaobai touched his chin as he said.

Mu Feiruo and Baili Xi nodded in agreement.

Ye Qingtang thought about it too. They previously entered the cursed mystic realm because of the Deity Ocean, but since the Deity Ocean sent them out, they must have returned to the original place they were originally meant to be in.

However... F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

No one knew what the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm would be like.

“Though the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm is mysterious and different every single time, it seems safer this time. Let’s just be careful and walk around to see if we can spot anything. There shouldn’t be much of a problem,” Mu Feiruo said.

The differences in the attitudes between the comparisons were clearly different this time. They weren’t cooperative with each other the previous time but after experiencing such an ordeal and receiving help from Ye Qingtang, they wouldn’t hide anything about the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm from her anymore.

Mu Feiruo’s suggestion was accepted by the rest and they moved around, exploring the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm.

“Mu Feiruo.” Jiang Shaobai suddenly looked at Mu Feiruo as he walked.

Mu Feiruo looked at him perplexedly.

A smile appeared on Jiang Shaobai’s face, revealing his pearly white teeth. “I have a friend who likes you very much. He says that you’re his only goddess.”

With absolutely no shame at all, Jiang Shaobai enunciated the word ‘goddess’ clearly.

Mu Feiruo’s face instantly darkened. He quickened his footsteps, pretending he hadn’t heard anything.

How did the Jiang family even raise such a mean person!

Ugh! Facepalm! Ye Qingtang could sense that the forces in her body were slightly different from the previous time.

When Ye Qingtang entered the cursed mystic realm, she was only at the early-stage of the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm, later advancing to the mid-stage. But just then, she felt...

The forces in her body had advanced to the early-stage of Heavenly Venerate Fifth Heaven?!

What was going on?

Looking at the others, Ye Qingtang decided to test the waters. But they replied that nothing had changed for them. They were in the exact state as when they first came.

Ye Qingtang was perplexed.

But somehow, she figured out something.

According to Jiang Shaobai and the others’ descriptions of the cursed mystic realm, they fell into a hole just right after entering the mystic realm. They soon lost consciousness and ran into Ye Qingtang.

As for Ye Qingtang, she made use of every single second in the mystic realm to cultivate.

Though the mystic realm was filled with dangers and her spirit energy depleted rapidly, the effects of her cultivation were impressive. Moreover, the mystic realm was filled with spirit energy. Ye Qingtang had experienced countless battles and built her skills along the way. Since they had been unconscious, they naturally wouldn’t be able to compare with her...

Was this considered a blessing in disguise?

Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief. At least she hadn’t wasted time and energy.

“Look, there’s light there!” After walking for some time, Jiang Shaobai suddenly lifted his hand, pointing up ahead.

Everyone looked over.

There was a brightly lit area not too far away.
