“There is no time left…”

The old Valley Master sighed softly. The black pearl at his glabella flew towards the sky. Almost instantly, a black fog exploded and surrounded the entire Nine Nights Dynasty in darkness.

Ye Qingtang steadied herself. She stared at the old Valley Master and asked.

“You killed a selfless lady for your own greed… Now, you want to use all living creatures’ lives on the mainland as your stepping stone to break the curse?!”

Ye Qingtang would not call herself a kind person. However, she could not accept the fact that he was going to kill everyone.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the old Valley Master remained silent. After a while, he raised his head and looked at Ye Qingtang. “I have given too much time to this mainland… However, the Dimension Wall is broken… I believe that there will be a lot of powerful people coming from elsewhere soon to take the Spiritual Abode. Why not just give it to me…”

Ye Qingtang stared at the old Valley Master, who seemed to be very determined. There was no trace of hesitation.

No matter how he tried to explain himself, he could never erase the crimes he had committed due to his selfishness.

“When the snow fell, the Divine King appeared. When he raised his head, he saw the most beautiful spirit. However, time flies, and hair whitened almost instantly…” The old Valley Master sighed with a complex expression.

The old Valley Master’s sigh and murmur landed into Ye Qingtang’s ears.

She was slightly stunned.

Divine King Luo Xue?!

Before the mainland was formed ten thousand years ago, there was a hero appeared after a snowstorm. He was known as the Divine King Luo Xue…

The Divine King Luo Xue led ancient people to form tribes and battled everywhere. His story was written in an enclosed historical record.

“You are… Divine King Luo Xue?!” Ye Qingtang stared at the old Valley Master in surprise.

The old Valley Master’s body trembled slightly.

His subtle reaction was all captured by Ye Qingtang

Ye Qingtang felt a mixed chain of emotions.

If her assumption was correct, the old Valley Master was the Divine King Luo Xue from ten thousand years ago!

According to the legend, Divine King Luo Xue lived together with a demon ten thousand years ago. In one battle against a strong enemy, he lost, and he used his life to cover for the demon for it to escape. However, the demon was not willing to leave and was willing to die together with him.

The Divine King Luo Xue in the legend cared for everything, even for a demon.

Ye Qingtang could not believe that the person in front of her who betrayed the extraordinary lady, ate her heart, and wished to kill everyone here as his stepping stone would be the Divine King Luo Xue in the legends, the one that was so selfless and kind.

Either the Divine King Luo Xue was lying, or the historical record was wrong.

However, Ye Qingtang was not sure of the truth.

Boom!

Suddenly, the sky was covered with dark clouds. Blood-red streaks of lightning appeared in the clouds and were about to attack everyone like a beast.

Swoosh!

In the next second, the blood-red streaks of lightning stroke towards the old Valley Master from mid-air.

Ye Qingtang was shocked. The blood-red streaks of lightning contained enormous power of the sky!

Ye Qingtang could still remember how she encountered the Heavenly Tribulation when she was about to charge towards the Holy Venerate. She almost died under the Heavenly Tribulation. Eventually, she managed to avoid the Heavenly Tribulation and became a Holy Venerate.
