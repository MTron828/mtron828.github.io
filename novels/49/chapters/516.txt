Chapter 517 Doubts (3)

“Demonic Water…”

As calm as Ye Qingtang was, she was finally a little nervous at that moment.

But she restrained her emotions very quickly. She must not make the slightest mistake at this critical juncture. She immediately planned a method to flee this place with the Blood Moon Elder in the shortest time possible after she was found out.

Before entering the division, Ye Qingtang had already memorized the topography of the place. Thus, topography was not an issue. However, how was she supposed to flee before the eyes of these mighty figures?

This was originally a huge gamble. If she won, she could ensure Xuanling Sect’s survival, but if she lost… perhaps, what she would lose would be her own life…

There was only a fine line between life and death. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Guardian, I hope that you can understand. After all, the three great Guardians of Blood Moon Sect never appeared before anyone, and using the Demonic Water to certify is for your good. After all, it is the only way for the Branch Masters and hundreds of members in the division to be convinced in heart and by word… What do you think, Guardian?” The elderly had an ambiguous smile on his face as he walked towards Ye Qingtang with the Demonic Water in hand.

Seated from afar, Ye Qingtang had an indifferent expression and never said anything.

Currently, she still had a fine Kingdom of God Array Formation and a Concealed Breath Spell…

Ye Qingtang pondered.

Once her identity was completely exposed, she would immediately activate the Kingdom of God to repress this area and use the Concealed Breath Curse to flee at the fastest speed. Although it might not succeed, she could not wait for death either…

Currently, Ye Qingtang was rather worried about the Blood Moon Elder.

Although the Blood Moon Aura on his body was real, he was still unable to certify his identity as an Elder of the Blood Moon Sect.

“Impudent! You are not allowed to be disrespectful to the Guardian!” The Blood Moon Elder walked forward immediately and declared coldly. “I’ll do it first!”

Noticing the situation, the elderly looked at the Blood Moon Elder with a slight frown and chided. “How dare you interrupt when I’m talking to the Guardian!”

“What a joke!” The Blood Moon Elder uttered. “You’re merely a Blood Moon Division Head and don’t have the qualification to reprimand me!”

“Oh?” The elderly sneered. “What is your identity in the Blood Moon Sect then?”

“There’s no need to discuss it.” The Blood Moon Elder waved a hand.

He already had a plan in mind.

Ye Qingtang’s Blood Moon Aura was forged, but he was an authentic elder.

He was not stupid and knew that he had to prove his own

identity ahead of Ye Qingtang.

Otherwise, once Ye Qingtang was exposed, these people would probably not give him a chance to prove himself or explain. They most likely would treat him as Ye Qingtang’s accomplice and kill them off altogether.

He did not wish to die in the hands of his own sect.

“What are you!” Blood Demon glared at the Blood Moon Elder angrily. “The Division Head is talking to the Guardian. There’s no room for you to speak!”

Then, under the elderly’s indication, Soul Severing Troll walked forward in large strides and grabbed the Blood Moon Elder’s collar, lifting him and bringing him to a side.

Ye Qingtang was a little helpless as she witnessed the scene.

A great Blood Moon Sect Elder was actually lifted away like a little chick by a Branch Master. He was probably the most wronged elder in Blood Moon Sect history.

Similarly, the Blood Moon Elder was seething with rage. Back then, Ye Qingtang stopped him from possessing that little genius sect disciple and forbade him from absorbing other’s vitality and strength. Otherwise, his current cultivation skills might not comparable to when he was at his peak but should have been more than enough to deal with a Blood Moon Branch Master. How would he be bullied by a Branch Master like Soul Severing Troll!
