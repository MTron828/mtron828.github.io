Chapter 1769: Sealed Space (1)

“What is this sealed space? Why haven’t I heard about this before?” One of the little fiendish demons asked the bunch of adult demons.

The adult fiendish demons tossed the little demon a scornful look. “You were only born not long ago. There are many things in this world you don’t know about.”

“Can you please tell me?” The little fiendish demon asked respectfully.

Since the adult fiendish demon was in a pretty good mood and it said, “Do you know how long the demon wars have lasted in this mountain valley?”

The little fiendish demon shook its head.

The adult demon continued. “Our ancestors have battled in this valley for tens of thousands of years.”

The little fiendish demon was stunned. Ye Qingtang, who was eavesdropping, was likewise astonished. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Tens of thousands of years...

“Tens of thousands of years ago, this place was not a mountain valley but it gradually evolved into one. I heard a previous Great Sage mention that this valley contains a secret sealed space called the Deity Ocean. Every ten thousand years, strange fissures in the space-time continuum will appear in this area. The great earth would crack, causing mountains to collapse, rivers to overflow and the stars to shift. During this chaotic time, the Deity Ocean would appear. Whoever can obtain this Deity Ocean will be able to rule over everything...”

The little fiendish demons were all engrossed in the narration. “Then did the fiendish demon who obtained the Deity Ocean become invincible?”

The adult fiendish demon snorted derisively. “Do you think it’s that easy to obtain the Deity Ocean? Let me tell you that no demon has been able to obtain the Deity Ocean for tens of thousands of years. Fiendish demons from the various factions have been battling for so many years just to get the opportunity to obtain the Deity Ocean when it appears. But no one has succeeded yet. Haven’t you noticed that the battles have become more intense recently? According to our estimates, the Deity Ocean will likely appear sometime within these two years. Everyone wants to obtain that Deity Ocean.”

The Deity Ocean was very desirable to fiendish demons. Greed and ambition were present in any race—even more so for the vicious fiendish demons.

The little fiendish demons were very impressed by the story. They felt that the Deity Ocean was something extremely powerful.

Ye Qingtang was also listening but she didn’t think much about the Deity Ocean. But there was something that triggered her suspicions.

She, Jiang Shaobai and eight others were supposed to enter the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm. But the mystic realm had undergone a complete change and turned into a vicious battleground. According to that fiendish demon, it was because of the impending appearance of this Deity Ocean.

Was it because of this fissure in the space-time continuum that resulted in them falling into this mystic realm?

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help feeling that these two things must be linked. But she was unable to ascertain it as a fact.

Just as Ye Qingtang was prepared to listen to more stories about the fiendish demons, the demon in the skin of the handsome man who brought her to this camp came over with a bunch of other demons. They had just returned from a great battle.

Those demons were covered in blood and the thick stench of it wafted off them.

“Here, for you.” The fiendish demon in the skin of the handsome man tossed a piece of demon flesh toward her.

Ye Qingtang was momentarily taken aback before reaching out to catch the bloody meat.

“I heard that you led a bunch of little demons and discovered traces of our enemies. This is your reward,” the demon declared gallantly.
