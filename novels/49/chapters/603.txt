At that instant, Ye Qingtang had already broken free from the screen of her mental demons and regained mental clarity.

“You want to retaliate?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady, you’re awake?” The Blood Moon Elder was slightly stunned when he saw Ye Qingtang speak.

Ye Qingtang nodded. “I fell into my mental demons earlier, but I have broken free from it already.”

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the Blood Moon Elder had a shocked expression. “Mental demons?”

Ye Qingtang looked down at the Black Heaven Water in her hands.

“There seems to be something wrong with this Black Heaven Water.” Ye Qingtang mumbled.

The Blood Moon Elder walked forward immediately and looked at the Black Heaven Water.

“Holy Lady, can I have a look?” The Blood Moon Elder asked.

Ye Qingtang handed the Black Heaven Water to the Blood Moon Elder directly.

Currently, Ye Qingtang had already trusted the Blood Moon Elder and was not worried that he would snatch her Black Heaven Water away.

After inspecting it for a long time, he covered the mouth of the bottle, and a black mist emerged from his palm subsequently.

About a few breaths later, a pitch-black plant about the size of a thumb was sucked out from the mouth of the bottle by the Blood Moon Elder.

“This is… Ghost Wood Root…”

The Blood Moon Elder was surprised, and even Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed.

The Ghost Wood Root was a plant that grew in lands that were condensed with grievance, and it was bred using grievance. It only formed after a hundred years of growth, and this Ghost Wood Root that was about the size of a thumb required at least two hundred years to grow.

The Ghost Wood Root emitted a faint scent. Once a cultivator breathed it in, they would hallucinate and be trapped in his deepest mental demons.

“The Ghost Wood Root itself is not scary, and the diffusion of its scent is extremely limited, but when it’s placed in the Black Heaven Water, the effects are multiplied by at least a few times…” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply as she pondered.

When they entered the Hell of Avicinaraka, everything seemed to be designed by someone…

Cultivators like them who entered the Hell of Avicinaraka were like chess pieces which were controlled and toyed by someone!

“What exactly… is going one…” The Blood Moon Elder was rather anxious.

Looking back, it seemed like they were manipulated by an invisible hand throughout, including entering this mysterious palace…

Ye Qingtang looked behind her. In the second palace, more than ten people were in a frenetic state and fighting each other with their lives.

A golden flame emerged in Ye Qingtang’s palm immediately, burning the Ghost Wood Rood into ashes.

At the same time, the people in the second palace who were originally killing others suddenly stopped.

As the Ghost Wood Root was completely burnt, the bewitching scent no longer persisted, and everyone naturally sobered up.

“This…”

“What happened?”

“I seemed to… be stuck in an illusion just now?”

The people in the second palace were very puzzled.

Suddenly the Yunxiao Sect Elder caught sight of Ye Qingtang who held the Black Heaven Water from the corner of his eyes.

“Black Heaven Water!”

After seeing the Black Heaven Water in Ye Qingtang’s hands, the Yunxiao Sect Elder’s expression changed immediately.

The preciousness of the Black Heaven Water was no less than that of the paragon Dharma treasures on this mainland.

Everyone knew that the Black Heaven Water could cleanse the spirit root and evolve its physique. It was a rare treasure that could cause the super sects to go crazy over.

However, this item was extremely hard to come by, and normal people simply did not even have the chance to see it.

“Is that the Black Heaven Water in your hands!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Yunxiao Sect Elder flew towards Ye Qingtang immediately and locked his eyes on the item in Ye Qingtang’s hands.
