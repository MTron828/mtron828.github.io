Chapter 1975: The Crimson League (1)

“What exactly is the Spirit of Chaos? Will it bring the Ancient You Clan more benefits? Or is it greater power?” Ye Qingtang didn’t have much understanding of the Spirit of Chaos, she had only heard a little about it from the ancient clans.

With her current identity as the Holy Lord of Shadows, she couldn’t possibly go around asking others about it.

“Miss Ye, you don’t need to figure out what exactly the Spirit of Chaos is. So long as they have not been fully collected, they are just useless fragments,” Ling Yan answered.

“Does the Eternal Dynasty own any Spirit of Chaos fragments?” Ye Qingtang asked. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ling Yan shook his head.

“Only the various powerful ancient clans own these fragments. As for the fragment belonging to the Temple of Shadows, it was taken away from an ancient clan by the Holy Lord of Shadows. Even the Sacred Ground of Reflection never owned it.”

Ye Qingtang gave it some thought. “You want me to contact the Crimson League, but what can they do for me? I’m not familiar with the Second Domain and have no idea about how to find the Crimson League, moreover...”

If she were to leave the Central Mainland and head to the Second Domain, the Ancient You Clan could possibly hear of the news.

Even if she was a fake, she still had the ability to keep the Ancient You Clan in line as long as she stayed in the Central Mainland.

“Of course you can’t leave the Central Mainland, but you’re forgetting that you don’t have to physically go to the Second Domain to contact the Crimson League,” Ling Yan said.

“Even though the Crimson League is a strong power based in the Second Domain, they have their people in the First Domain, right in the Central Mainland. Miss Ye, you would just have to find the members of the Crimson League who are currently in the Central Mainland to pass them the news.”

“Do you know where these members are at now?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan with hope in her eyes.

Ling Yan smiled when he saw her eyes sparkle with anticipation. Then he very decisively...

Shook his head.

“...”

Ye Qingtang: Is it too late to beat him to death now.

Ling Yan couldn’t help but laugh when he saw Ye Qingtang’s expression change. “You know it.”

I know it?” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s mouths twitched a little.

She should just beat him to death!

“To be precise, the Holy Lord of Shadows should know. Not only the Holy Lord of Shadows, the two Holy Sons of the Temple of Shadows and the eight tribe leaders know. You can ask them about how to find the Crimson League.” Before Ye Qingtang could turn her thoughts into actions, Ling Yan gave an answer that calmed her down.

Ye Qingtang had a rough direction of how things could go. As for how she could get the eight tribe leaders or Ming Wang to let her know of how to find the members, she had to give it some further thought.

Right when Ye Qingtang was thinking about what excuses she could make, she saw Ling Yan supporting his chin with one hand, his eyes crinkling into a smile as he looked at her.

Just seeing his carefree expression made Ye Qingtang want to beat him up again.

He had the audacity to smile even when his entire dynasty had been snatched over by the Central Dynasty?

Was he magnanimous or what?

“What are you looking at?” Ye Qingtang asked fiercely.

“I’m looking at you.” Ling Yan smiled.

Ye Qingtang felt that she couldn’t continue with this fierce expression anymore.

“Miss Ye.”

“What’s the matter?”

“It’s been a long time, I missed you a lot.”

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. Before her temperature got even higher, she wasted no time and grabbed Ling Yan’s collar, chasing him out of the room.
