Yue Tiancheng replied immediately. “Since that is the case, you will stay here to guard this array formation and Ji Yixuan. There is a force of destruction from Senior Sister Ye You’s blue spirit root. In a while, Ji Yixuan will be nothing but bones. You don’t need to do anything. Just don’t let anyone come near and wait for me to return.”

“Alright. Rest assured, Senior Brother Yue. With me here, no one will be able to come near here.” Ye Qingtang hurriedly agreed and nodded.

At that moment, Yue Tiancheng was burning with anxiety and immediately turned around to leave without explaining much to Ye Qingtang.

At the same time…

A loud bang sounded!

Ji Yixuan, who was sealed in the array formation, was astounded, and his jaws fell wide open.

The moment Yue Tiancheng turned around, Ji Yixuan saw that the Yunxiao Sect girl immediately turned hostile and slapped his back.

Without surprise, Yue Tiancheng’s body flew out and knocked on a rock over ten meters away.

Boom!

The rock crumbled into pieces from the impact. Yue Tiancheng further caused several sturdy trees to fall and finally fell on the ground.

“Ow!”

Yue Tiancheng’s complexion was pale, and blood gushed out of his mouth. He looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

“You!!” After saying just one word, Yue Tiancheng spat another mouthful of blood again.

Ye Qingtang looked at Yue Tiancheng, who collapsed below a tall tree after being severely injured from just one move from her, and her lips curled up in a playful smile. She darted to where Yue Tiancheng was swiftly.

“You!” Yue Tiancheng clenched his teeth, wanting to stand up, but that one slap from that girl utterly smashed all life in him, and all his vital organs were damaged.

“Who exactly… are you!” Yue Tiancheng used all his energy to ask the devilishly stunning girl who had arrived before him.

“Senior Brother Ye, have you forgotten that you offended me before?” The smile on her lips deepened as she looked at Yue Tiancheng’s twisted expression.

“Other than today… I’ve… never… seen you before… at all!” Yue Tiancheng said between pants.

He was in a hurry to leave just now and did not guard against this girl at all. Who would have thought that she would launch a sneak attack from behind him and attack his gate of vitality!

“You are not a Yunxiao Sect… disciple!” Yue Tiancheng was not foolish. He was so cautious, but there was still a slip.

However, what replied him was the Demonic Blood Sword that had already been drawn out of its scabbard.

Swoosh!

The Demonic Blood Sword waved in Ye Qingtang’s hand. A blood-colored sword shadow emerged and pierced through Yue Tiancheng’s chest.

In just a moment, Yue Tiancheng stared disbelievingly at the Demonic Blood Sword that was pierced in his chest and watched blood spatter out from the wound. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“I don’t like to b*llsh*t with a dead person.” Ye Qingtang looked at the pale Yue Tiancheng from a commanding position. She suddenly withdrew her Demonic Blood Sword out and flicked her wrist for the blood on the sword to fall off.

Indignation was written all over Yue Tiancheng’s face. Even when he died, he still did not understand what exactly happened.

Looking at Yue Tiancheng who had already stopped breathing, Ye Qingtang bent down and took his space ring away without hesitation.

At that instant, Ji Yixuan was flabbergasted. He only saw Ye Qingtang suddenly attacking Yue Tiancheng previously, and the two of them flew over ten meters away. He could not hear what they said afterward and only witnessed Yue Tiancheng being killed by Ye Qingtang.

They were both Yunxiao Sect disciples, yet why would Yue Tiancheng be killed by another Yunxiao Sect disciple? Could it be that the two of them had an internal strife…

Ji Yixuan was extremely puzzled.
