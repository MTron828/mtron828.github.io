Chapter 1687: The Challenge Begins (1)

“I hope not. I’m seriously bored to death here. Any one of them will do. Just let me stretch out my limbs.” Zhan Rao looked so despondent that Sang Feiyu couldn’t help grinning in amusement.

Zhan Rao was from the Zhan family and they were known for being violent and fond of battles. The moment they were triggered, they became like wild beasts and were oblivious to pain, not stopping until the opponent was dead.

It could be said that the members of the Zhan family lived for battles.

“Things have just started. Don’t be so anxious, Brother Zhan.” Baili Xuanyun smiled.

“Xuanyun, I heard that you have come into conflict with the Jiang family recently?” Zhan Rao looked at Baili Xuanyun.

“It’s just a joke.” Baili Xuanyun smiled. “The Jiang family are descended from the Domain Monarch and their descendants can’t be that bad. I just want to exchange moves with them. To put it another way, I do want to experience the Jiang family’s Heavenly Demon Bloodline.”

Zhan Rao pursed his lips. No matter how nicely Baili Xuanyun tried to put it, his tone was clearly full of ridicule and scorn.

This year’s fighters soon selected their battle format. Out of the 20 candidates who came, most of them chose to fight amongst themselves for the four empty spots. Only a few chose to challenge the top fighters from the previous round.

Zhan Rao’s eyes burned as he gazed at those challengers. Heavens knew how desperately he wished to have a fight now.

As expected, Baili Xuanyun spotted Jiang Yanyun in the group of challengers. But he didn’t see Ye Qingtang. His eyes instantly darkened and he instinctively gazed toward the Mu family. He saw Mu Ruxue, who was wearing a veil.

At this moment, Mu Ruxue’s eyes were like that of a venomous snake hidden in the shadows, sharp and alert to her surroundings. She clenched her fists when she didn’t see Ye Qingtang in the crowd. With a sudden leap, she landed beside Baili Xuanyun.

“Brother Xuanyun, where is that detestable Ye Qingtang? Didn’t you tell me she agreed to challenge you?” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ruxue, don’t be so anxious. Even if she doesn’t turn up today, I won’t allow her to leave the Island of Immortal Footsteps alive. Don’t worry. I will never forget my promise to you,” Baili Xuanyun assured her.

Mu Ruxue remained petulant.

After all, Ye Qingtang had embarrassed her in front of so many people that day. The hatred in her heart would not be extinguished until she got her payback tenfold.

Zhan Rao overheard their conversation. He already knew Baili Xuanyun was interested in Mu Ruxue, but he had no idea who this Ye Qingtang was. Over the past weeks, he only paid attention to those who had attained the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm and above, as only they were qualified to challenge him. He was completely oblivious to the rest of the people around.

“I say, Baili, that Ye person must have been too scared to show up. She hasn’t even reached the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm, how could she dare to challenge you? She’s probably hiding in a corner and crying.”

Baili Xuanyun smiled in agreement. Even if Ye Qingtang didn’t appear today, he would still keep his promise to Mu Ruxue. As he said, he would not allow Ye Qingtang to leave the Island of Immortal Footsteps alive.

The elimination battles soon began.

Meanwhile, the challengers would carry out their fights in another part of the arena. Elder Qian and the rest of the others were completely thunderstruck when they saw Jiang Yanyun standing amongst the challengers.
