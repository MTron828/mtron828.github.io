Chapter 1360 You Are Deliberately Provoking Me 2

For a moment…

Pandemonium reigned in the courtyard of the General’s residence. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

General Qiao, who had been about to stop them, stood rooted to the spot in disbelief. His expression was one of incredulity.

Uh…

What’s going on?

The General’s wife, who was all prepared to watch a good show, was also shocked. She looked on as her elder brother and the others from her family flew here and there in the courtyard as if possessed. Please go and support our new domain MangaBob.com.Thanks!They looked as if they had seen a ghost.

General Qiao was one of the most skilled people in the entire kingdom. Even so, he did not even have the ability to clearly see Ye Qingtang’s movements.

Within the span of a few breaths, the entire courtyard of the General’s residence was in disarray. Dongfang Qing was one of the first to be hit. He lay motionless on the ground. He had stopped breathing.

Only Ye Qingtang stood casually amidst the group. Her expression was rather strange.

She had thought that General Qiao was pretty weak but had not expected that…

These people from the Dongfang Family were even weaker than General Qiao?

Was there even one person in this world who could fight?

Ye Qingtang was speechless. She did not know that this group of people who had collapsed on the ground were considered elite fighters in this world.

Dongfang Qing, in particular, was almost on par with General Qiao. Outside of the capital, he could become a chief anywhere else.

But this “chief” was now lying motionless on the ground. He was not even breathing.

“Elder Brother… Elder Brother…” When the General’s wife saw the chaos, she could not maintain her act any longer. She wept as she ran to Dongfang Qing’s side. She turned ashen as she looked at Dongfang Qing, who was bleeding copiously from the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.

Dongfang Qing had died just like that?

“You… You lunatic, you killed my Elder Brother?!” The General’s wife glared at Ye Qingtang. Her expression was a mixture of fear and hate.

Ye Qingtang stared blankly at her. “…”

Dead?

Surely he can not be that weak?

She had just moved her hands and legs a little and had not even used any force. And he had died?!

Why the hell is he so weak…

They really were not deliberately provoking her?

For some reason, Ye Qingtang had a strange feeling that the disparity in ability between her and the people of this world was even greater than that between her and the Heavenly Venerate level animals in the nine-star constellation.

She had just moved her fingers slightly, and they had all died.

General Qiao was completely shocked. He thought that his daughter was a good-for-nothing who could not learn martial arts. Then, she had turned into a lunatic and was probably ruined for life.

Unexpectedly…

Ye Qingtang’s casual act today had smashed General Qiao’s world view.

How terrifying was her power?

Even his Master probably could not defeat dozens of people from the Dongfang Family in such a short span of time…

Apart from Dongfang Qing, a dozen men from the Dongfang Family had come along. Now, seven or eight of them were dead, and the survivors were all injured. Up to now, they could not figure out what kind of sinister power Ye Qingtang had used to strike them all down.

When the rest saw that their family Master was dead, a chill crept down their spines. They were so frightened that they shivered.

Because Dongfang Kai was injured, he had not advanced. He thought that his father and the General’s wife could take care of this lunatic, but who knew…

In the end, all he had was Dongfang Qing’s body that was slowly turning cold.
