Chapter 353: Sword Spirit Workshop (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There had already been rumors in Xuanling Sect that the Grand Elder loved blacksmithing and that the Sword Spirit Workshop was catered to his interest. With the Grand Elder’s protection, even the inner sect elders were relatively polite to the blacksmiths there, much less ordinary disciples.

Perhaps, those two disciples complained a bit because they suffered in the Sword Spirit Workshop, but one could still hear the fear in their words.

Ye Qingtang was not too concerned though. She was there to strengthen the Demonic Blood Sword and could not be bothered about anything else

In just a while, Ye Qingtang reached the entrance of the Sword Spirit Workshop.

Although the Sword Spirit Workshop was opened to forge weapons, the place was relatively magnificent. Before Ye Qingtang entered the workshop, she was already able to feel the gradual increase in the surrounding temperature.

When Ye Qingtang entered the workshop, she saw a few blacksmiths making weapons. As the hammers landed, a clank sounded, and sparks flew everywhere. Surrounded by furnaces, the temperature of the Sword Spirit Workshop was frighteningly high.

All types of weapons were hung on the walls of the Sword Spirit Workshop, and from the sharp blades, it was evident that they were of relatively fine quality.

Although they were a group of arrogant blacksmiths, their standards were way above those of the blacksmiths outside the sect.

Ye Qingtang’s arrival did not draw any attention from the blacksmiths, who even could not be bothered to look up and only focused on the work on hand.

An incharge sitting aside was smoking an opium pipe every now and then. Lifting an eyelid lazily, he swept an indifferent look across Ye Qingtang, who entered the workshop

“Incharge, I wish to forget a sword. How do I go about doing this?” Ye Qingtang walked forward and said politely.

The incharge glanced at Ye Qingtang and took two puffs before answering casually. “What kind of sword do you wish to forge?”

Ye Qingtang removed the Demonic Blood Sword hung on her waist.

The warden took a look and nodded slightly, though he still had an emotionless expression on his face.

“Thirty thousand Xuanming points.”

“…” Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded instantly.

Thirty thousand Xuanming points?

Was this a joke?

With another ten thousand, it was enough to exchange for the Demonic Blood Sword.

The incharge saw Ye Qingtang’s expression and said, “I quoted this price because your sword is pretty good. If it were some ordinary plaything, no one would help you to forge even if you paid double the price.”

Ye Qingtang could tell that the blacksmiths here were not easy to deal with. A casual quote was already tens of thousands of Xuanming points, and whether they forged it was another matter altogether. It was all dependent on whether the weapon could catch the attention of the blacksmiths.

Ye Qingtang wanted to strengthen the Demonic Blood Sword, but thirty thousand Xuanming points… was definitely not a price she could afford to pay.

She was not a fool!

They really were working under the Grand Elder. Look at how different their tone was.

Ye Qingtang had a little headache. Not mentioning how she did not have so many Xuanming points, but even if she did, she would definitely not be willing to spend so lavishly like that.

However…

She was not resigned to leaving her weapon as it was.

Then, Ye Qingtang scanned her surrounding and finally spoke after some hesitation “I don’t have thirty thousand Xuanming points. I’m afraid I can’t request the masters to personally work on it. I wonder if… I can forge it myself?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The incharge scanned Ye Qingtang and could not help but chuckle after noticing her thin wrists and legs. Knocking on his opium pipe, he leaned back on his chair lazily and asked, “You wish to forge it yourself?”
