“This is the land of inheritance. I have come to this place a few times in the past and saw this pagoda. The pagoda of inheritance has three levels in total, but there seems to be strong energy turbulence on the third level, and the turbulence is very unstable.”

“Pagoda of inheritance…”

Ye Qingtang pondered.

As the white tiger had said, she could sense the energy turbulence released from the third level even when she was a few thousand meters away from the pagoda.

“What is… inside the third level of the pagoda…” Glints flickered in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Ye Qingtang felt that she was getting closer and closer towards the secret of the starting of the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka. Maybe she could find all the answers from the pagoda of inheritance, including… the identity of the black-robed man!

The starting of the Hundred Level Peril mystic realm was not simple. It seemed to be a trap from the beginning.

“Ye Qingtang!”

A few figures landed at that moment.

“You’re Ye Qingtang?” A young man stared at Ye Qingtang and held a long sword in his hand.

Ye Qingtang sized up the crowd as she heard the voices.

There were a few Yunxiao Sect disciples and a few Yuehua Sect disciples in the crowd.

“F*ck?! How dare you come here to hunt me down? I am the Fiendcelestial Beast! Think for yourself again! If I reveal my true power, ordinary people like you will never be able to face the consequences!” The white tiger was lying in Ye Qingtang’s arms, and its eyes stared at the crowd in anger.

The disciples from the two sects were shocked as they saw the white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“This is the legendary… Fiendcelestial Beast?!” One of the Yunxiao Sect disciples was very excited.

They only heard about the Fiendcelestial Beast in rumors. Today, they finally got the chance to see one in real life.

Ye Qingtang took a glimpse at the white tiger and said, “No one will treat you as a dummy if you don’t talk.”

“Ye Qingtang, hand over the Fiendcelestial Beast. Then, we will let you die in peace!” One Yunxiao Sect disciples shouted.

“There are only a few of you?” Ye Qingtang scanned the surroundings without any change in expression.

“What? Are the few of us here not enough to kill you?” The Yunxiao Sect disciple smiled coldly.

“He…” Ye Qingtang curled her lips. It seemed like these super sect disciples were just a leading team.

“It’s all on you.” Ye Qingtang looked towards the Blood Moon Elder.

“Rest assured, Holy Lady.” The Blood Moon Elder smiled coldly and walked towards the super sect disciples.

“You are looking for your own deaths here…” The Blood Moon Elder stopped half-way and looked at them with interest.

Before those disciples could say anything, a few black rays came out of the Blood Moon Elder’s body.

A few disciples were engulfed by the black rays after just a few seconds.

“Engulfing heretic skill… You are from the… Blood Moon Sect?!”

A Yuehua Sect disciple could not believe the situation happening in front of them. He remained confused until he was completely engulfed.

The few black rays returned to the Blood Moon Elder’s body after a short while.

“A batch of trash…” The Blood Moon Elder sneered.

The Blood Moon Elder’s ability had entered the peak stage of the First Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Three. He was able to reuse some of the heretic skills. He was confident that he could kill people of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three as well.

“F*ck! How dare you to consume them alone?! At least leave one for me!” The white tiger protested against the Blood Moon Elder.
