Chapter 2280: Moving Up (1)

Leaving the secret room and returning to the tunnel, Ye Qingtang suddenly realized something.

The hole in which she had entered the secret room had disappeared. Right in front of her was a complete and whole wall.

Did the crack mend itself?

Taken aback, Ye Qingtang instinctively reached out.

Her hand passed right through the wall.

Ye Qingtang instantly understood.

“No wonder the black snake looked like it couldn’t see me. So this secret room has this kind of illusion.” Ye Qingtang lowered her eyes and saw a pile of shattered rocks on the ground.

The illusion of the wall mending itself was probably created by the array formation in the secret room.

Understanding this, Ye Qingtang hurried over to the exit.

After recovering her vision, Ye Qingtang was now outside the entrance.

She saw quite a number of people around the area.

But those people were from the various factions and they were just about to enter the tomb. They were all focused on the tomb and did not realize the sudden appearance of Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang knew how dangerous it was inside the tomb. But even if she were to warn everyone here, they would probably not believe her. Instead, they would suspect her of having ulterior motives and might even kill her…

Before the crowd could notice her presence, Ye Qingtang quietly snuck off.

Soon enough, she returned to the campsite with the Night Soul Beast.

At this point…

Lei Yan and the rest looked very forlorn. The faces of the teenagers were covered in dirt and dust.

“Where did Boss go? It’s already been so long. Why is he not back yet? Did something happen to him?” Lei Yan spoke despondently.

After Ye Qingtang told them that she had to go settle some affairs, she disappeared without a trace and had not returned since.

At first, the teenagers didn’t feel anything amiss. But as time passed, they started to feel anxious.

Nangong Lie smacked Lei Yan on the back of the head.

“Shut your inauspicious mouth. Who do you think Boss is? He is someone who can make a Night Soul Beast as tame as a cat. What can possibly happen to him? Stop making such wild guesses.”

Nangong Lie might be saying that but in his heart, he was also feeling rather anxious.

Originally they had planned to go and look for Ye Qing, but the number of factions entering the Evil Soul Forest had increased over this period. With the prior incident still looming over their heads, they didn’t dare to venture out.

Boss was weaker than them, but somehow, they had a certain level of faith in him.

Especially after their experience in the fiendcelestial’s tomb. They just felt that nothing was too difficult for their Boss to overcome.

Yun Chen, Qin Feng and the rest also looked anxious. Ye Qing’s continued absence caused the hearts of those teenagers to sink even deeper.

Over time, they had started to regard Ye Qing as some kind of spiritual leader. They were useless garbage disdained by the entire academy. Ye Qing was the only one who chose not to give up on them.

“Ahem, let’s not talk about this anymore. I say, Qin Feng, your powers have increased tremendously. I think you must be close to the Divine Lord stage now?” Nangong Lie changed the subject.

Slightly taken aback, Qin Feng nodded.

“At most another two weeks.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Nangong Lie gasped.

“Amazing. My brother is so awesome!”

Qin Feng remained silent.

His powers had been declining so much that he had given up on himself. But unexpectedly, under Ye Qing’s guidance, his powers started to increase again. In fact, his formerly-declining powers started to improve rapidly.

Previously, he was already close to the Divine Lord stage. Now that his powers were rising again, it was only natural that his rate of progress was faster than others.
