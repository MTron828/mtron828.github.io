Chapter 285: Committing Murder To Snatch A Treasure (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“This smell of blood is so aromatic…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder was indulged in the bloody smell which was rich with spirit energy.

Ye Qingtang rolled her eyes at him and headed out to find out what happened.

However…

When Ye Qingtang scanned the situation, she suddenly saw a terribly battered figure which caused her mind to explode!

Outside Xuanling Sect, Yun Shu, who was covered in blood, collapsed on the clouds with feeble breathing. A large amount of blood gushed out from his body and stained the clouds beneath his body. All color was lost from his good-looking face, leaving a complexion as pale as a sheet of paper.

“Senior Brother Yun!” Ye Qingtang, alarmed, dashed out of the sect immediately.

A group of disciples surrounded and looked at the miserable Yun Shu in confusion.

Ye Qingtang hurried to Yun Shu’s side and held Yun Shu up.

Yun Shu looked up with great effort, and when he saw Ye Qingtang, his body trembled slightly. He suddenly clutched onto Ye Qingtang tightly. “Junior… Junior Sister Ye…”

“Senior Brother Yun, what happened to you?! Who injured you?” Ye Qingtang’s eyebrows were tightly furrowed.

“Lu… Lu Xiuwen… Junior Sister Ye… Lu Xiu… wen… He injured me… in order to snatch my… Shangyue Fire Tripod,” Yun Shu said strenuously as though every word was squeezed out from his throat.

Shock filled Ye Qingtang’s eyes. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lu Xiuwen!

Yun Shu already had no energy left and passed out after forcing this sentence out of his mouth.

Ye Qingtang looked at the long trail of blood behind Yun Shu and did not dare to imagine how Yun Shu crawled back to Xuanling Sect with such heavy injuries.

The bright red blood stain pierced her eyes.

“Senior Brother Yun… I will not let Lu Xiuwen off… Don’t worry.” Ye Qingtang carried Yun Shu and rushed into the sect with the Blood Moon Sect Elder following right after.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang only knew that Lu Xiuwen was the one who revealed her secret regarding the Heart of the Demon God, yet it turned out that he actually harmed Yun Shu secretly as well. It seemed that Yun Shu was so wretched in his previous life exactly because of Lu Xiuwen’s murderous schemes!

Ye Qingtang had heard of the Shangyue Fire Tripod that Yun Shu mentioned earlier. That was the treasure that he happened to obtain in the previous mission. It could increase one’s cultivation speed and was extremely rare, and Ye Qingtang was happy for him as well.

Yet, unexpectedly…

This Fengyue Fire Tripod actually caused him to meet with a fatal disaster!

Ye Qingtang swiftly sent Yun Shu to the physician, who was also stunned to see Yun Shu’s injuries and quickly treated him.

As the blood-stained clothes were disrobed from Yun Shu, a deep cut on his chest of which his bones could be seen was revealed. An intense murderous expression flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

The cut on Yun Shu’s chest was extremely deep and was less than a finger away from his heart. If the cut was just a little deeper, Yun Shu would have lost his life already.

The news of Yun Shu’s severe injuries spread throughout the entire outer sect rapidly.

It was then that Ye Qingtang realized that Yun Shu was out on a mission with a group of people including Lu Xiuwen and Su Wan. However, the group had already returned to the sect to submit their mission two days ago and even reported that Yun Shu met with a mishap in the mission.

Now that Yun Shu suddenly returned, there was indeed a huge stir, and the warden of the Disciplinary Hall immediately ordered for Yun Shu to be brought over after hearing what Yun Shu said before he fainted.
