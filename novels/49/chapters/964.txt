Chapter 965 Boy Genius (4)

“What a delightful beating. Did you see how arrogant that fellow from the Duan family was when he came? But now? Young Master Dan, with just one stroke of your sword, you sent him sprawling, and he couldn’t even get up. Let’s see if he dares to come back to the Ye house.”

The young people of the Ye Family surrounded Dan Yifan, chattering away and praising him.

What was a genius?

This was a real genius!

Dan Yifan was a few years younger than many of them, but they could not hope to measure up to his ability in their lifetime.

The Great Elder was very pleased with Dan Yifan’s performance and could not help smiling faintly.

“Grandfather and Master, please don’t worry. If the Duan Family makes trouble again, I will send them packing,” Dan Yifan said bluntly.

The elders and Ye Ling nodded.

When the Duan Family had made trouble, they had only involved the younger generation, so it was inappropriate for the Master and Elders to be involved.

“Young Master Dan, what was that sword that you used? It seemed very powerful!” A youth from the Ye Family stared curiously at the sword at Dan Yifan’s side.

“Are you talking about my Blazing Sun Sword?” Dan Yifan smiled and unbuckled the sword at his side. He unsheathed it before everyone’s eyes.

Clank!

The blade suddenly rang out as the sharp sword was unsheathed. It glittered with a blinding light.

Flame-like reliefs could be faintly seen on the blade.

“A good sword!” When Ye Ling saw the sword, his eyes brightened.

“This sword… looks extraordinary,” said Second Elder.

Dan Yifan laughed and said, “This sword was personally given to me by my Master. It is an inferior yellow-grade weapon.”

“Inferior yellow-grade?”

Everyone was shocked by Dan Yifan’s words!

A yellow-grade weapon had not appeared in Lin Town for many years. Even those that had surfaced recently belonged to the Long Family. Since when had the other major families seen a divine weapon of this grade? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

With that, everyone turned their fervent gaze to the Blazing Sun Sword.

“Young Master Dan… isn’t a yellow-grade weapon… quite powerful?” The disciples of the Ye Family seldom had a chance to see a yellow-grade weapon, much less witness its power.

Just now, Dan Yifan had only casually swung the sword, so they had not been able to carefully observe the power of the Blazing Sun Sword.

“Of course, an ordinary weapon cannot compare with a yellow-grade weapon.” Dan Yifan smiled as he spoke. “Even among the sects, very few disciples possess one.”

“It is truly powerful.” All the youths stared unswervingly at Dan Yifan’s Blazing Sun Sword.

They would probably never possess a divine weapon like that in their lifetime.

“Young Master Dan, your master must think very highly of you to give you such a valuable sword,” said a youth enviously.

Dan Yifan smiled. Although he did not say anything, his expression showed his pride.

He suddenly took out a sword from his space ring.

“This was the original sword I carried. Although it does not have any grade, it’s a pretty good weapon.” As he spoke, Dan Yifan suddenly stretched out his hand and pushed the sword in front of Ye Qingtang, who had remained silently by the side.

“Since Eldest Young Lady has entered a sect, then she should have a good sword by her side. This sword is for you.” Dan Yifan smiled as he spoke. Although his sword had no grade, he had obtained it when he was part of the outer sect of the Xuanling Sect, so it was naturally superior to an ordinary weapon.
