Chapter 2625 That Unparalleled Strike (2)

Within the Feng family arena, Ye Qingtang looked at the Heavenly Emperor with a feeling of unease in her heart. She knew that the Heavenly Emperor had to get through this. If he didn’t, she wouldn’t be able to meet his clone in her lifetime and this wouldn’t be fair to her brother at all.

But looking at the terrifying Calamity of Wrath, she was filled with worry.

Furthermore, while the Heavenly Emperor didn’t recognize Ye Qingtang, she had not forgotten him at all.

Ye Qingtang had never seen the Heavenly Emperor in this lifetime but she still treated him as the Blood Moon Holy Lord that she knew, the little brother who spoke very little and was very cheap. “It’s here!”

One of the practitioners called out as she was still in deep thought.

Soon, the eighth bolt of lightning appeared in the sky like a blood dragon and headed straight towards the Heavenly Emperor. “Boom!”

A great sound shook the skies.

As everyone looked on, the Heavenly Emperor raised his hands slightly and the light in front of him started to form golden patterns, into an old totem. The totem harbored massive power and protected the Heavenly Emperor behind it.

The eighth bolt of lightning quickly struck him. It first struck the huge totem of light in front of the Heavenly Emperor savagely.

“Bang!”

As the eighth bolt of lightning struck, the bright totem light quickly dissipated in front of their very eyes.

After that, the eighth bolt of lightning continued its route towards the Heavenly Emperor, its power not having been diminished at all.

But this time, the eighth bolt landed on the golden totem in front of the Heavenly Emperor. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

There was the sound of a mirror shattering.

They all looked on as the golden totem around the Heavenly Emperor shattered.

“Oh my god…”

At that moment, the practitioners all looked in awe at the Heavenly Emperor in the sky.

He had withstood the eighth bolt from the Calamity of Wrath!

Ye Qingtang sighed in relief as she saw this.

She had to admit that the Heavenly Emperor had a terrifying defense.

Although the eighth bolt from the Calamity of Wrath was extremely scary, the Heavenly Emperor’s two totems had managed to block it. It was a pity that they were no longer there.

After a long time of thunder rumbling, the ninth bolt was forming in the storm clouds. The ninth bolt was much more terrifying than the previous bolt. The power it harnessed was way stronger and it was more condensed as well.

Ye Qingtang felt chills all over her body as she stood in the Feng family arena. Seeing that many of them were worried, she waved her hand and used her great dao power to dissipate the power of the ninth bolt that was seeping all around them.

“How do you feel?” Ye Qingtang asked Feng Jiuyou and Feng Wuyin.

“Sister Ye Yue, I feel so much better…” Feng Wuyin said.

“Sister Ye Yue, how did you do that? I thought I was about to be ripped to shreds just now. The ninth bolt is just too terrifying!” Feng Jiuyou said fearfully.

“Everything is alright as long as you’re all fine. Step back so you don’t get hurt by it,” she reminded them.

As soon as she said that, the people from the Feng family all retreated.
