Chapter 29: Buoys (2)

Ye Qingtang, who was still shopping in the boutique did not notice at all, that from atop those inconspicuous higher levels of the building, a pair of deep set eyes were silently watching her every move.

Mu Su stood next to the man, Han Cangming, in a secret loge and while observing Ye Qingtang, he became fascinated by the gorgeous young lady.

That is the host for the heart of the demon emperor?

Mu Su could not help but to recall Han Cangming’s question to him, when they left the Ye’s residence last night.

So, his Highness desired for a girl like her to conceive his…. Ahem….

Mu Su stole a glimpse at Han Cangming, whose eyes were fixated on Ye Qingtang all the time, not in the least aware of the undulating mood of his entourage.

The Pavilion of Treasures offered an assortment of exotic merchandise. Thanks to Ye Qingtang’s help for locating the Bent grass, she earned a tantalizing discount for all her purchases, which she would obviously make the most out of. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The manager, tasked by Mu Su, was assisting Ye Qingtang in her shopping personally. He initially thought she would make full use of this opportunity to buy a few famous pieces of merchandise and did not expect her to stop by an unattended counter abruptly.

“Are these Buoys?” Ye Qingtang enquired as she pointed to the counter displaying some brightly colored pebbles.

The manager nodded as he threw a glance on those display.

Buoys were spoils scored from hunting down a fifth-order spirit beast that required the collaboration of more than a hundred people. The Buoys in itself however, were deemed unremarkable.

Buoys had a solid composition, highly resistant to any form of physical damage. In lieu of the efforts required for their achievement, Buoys were highly priced despite no one perceiving a practical use for it. Even as just mere decorations, Buoys were not as exquisite as gemstones, thus other than a few aristocrats who would buy one or two pieces to flaunt their wealth, almost no one would be interested in them.

But Ye Qingtang was totally attracted by those few pieces of Buoys.

Buoys might be useless to the others but definitely not to her. She regarded them as priceless!

“How many of these Buoys are available for sale?” Ye Qingtang inquired further.

The manager could not comprehend her enthusiasm over those deadweight Buoys and merely considered her as being inquisitive, “Around a dozen or more.”

Those things were considered deadweight as they were a burden to sell, and had accumulated like a hoard.

Whilst Ye Qingtang stroked her chin, her eyes gleamed in delight, “I’m buying them all.”

“….” The manager’s eyes nearly popped out of his head at her decision.

All?

“Miss Ye, just a single piece costs a thousand gold. Are you sure?”

Ye Qingtang gave an affirmative nod.

“….” The manager was dumbstruck.

Whilst expecting Ye Qingtang to purchase something worthwhile with her discount, who could have thought this young lady would choose instead, to buy those Buoys which were as insignificant as some common pebbles!

Furthermore, just a dozen would cost her more than ten thousand gold!

Paying that price for a pile of stones was a total dead loss!

The manager was prepared to advise her against her hasty decision but the deal was sealed when Ye Qingtang placed that amount of gold directly onto the counter without a second thought. The manager was at a total loss for words.

Without a choice, he could only steel his heart against her loss as he ordered his assistants to present every piece of Buoy available in the boutique for her purchase.

There was a total of seventeen pieces that amounted to a price of thirteen thousand six hundred gold after Ye Qingtang’s twenty percent discount. On top of that, the manager gave her his own concession and only collected thirteen thousand gold from her in the end.

Even with all that, the manager still felt he was cheating Ye Qingtang out of her coffers.

However, the person in question received her new purchases in all smiles.
