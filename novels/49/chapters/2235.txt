Chapter 2236: Puppet Emperor (2)

Ye Qingtang had already found it strange that over the past few days in the expansive Evil Soul Forest, the only Night Soul Beast she had encountered was the one in her arms.

The various factions’ sudden invasion of the Evil Soul Forest was similarly bizarre. Although much blood had been spilled with countless bodies strewn across the ground, things were not as terrible as Ye Qingtang would have imagined

These factions had dispatched several powerful practitioners but only a few were truly the elite.

This was not at all like the expected arrangements for invading the Evil Soul Forest. Usually, a thousand-man team stepping into the Evil Soul Forest would just be a suicide mission.

But today, quite a huge number had managed to arrive at the core region of the Evil Soul Forest.

They had probably received news that most of the Night Soul Beasts were in hibernation and were taking advantage of this time to invade the forest.

At this thought, Ye Qingtang quickly drew back a good distance with the Night Soul Beast in her arms. She found a safe spot at the foot of a mountain before placing the Night Soul Beast on the ground.

The Night Soul Beast glared at this human, whose face was full of ill intention. Its teeth ached with hatred.

“Don’t glare at me like that. Let’s make a deal, how about that?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Night Soul Beast.

The Night Soul Beast just rolled its eyes at Ye Qingtang.

Deal?

If this human hadn’t discovered its weakness, it would have already swallowed her alive.

“Aren’t the Night Soul Beasts the guardians of the Evil Soul Forest? Now you’ve already seen that many factions are invading. I think the other Night Soul Beasts are in hibernation now, so you are the only one awake, right?” Ye Qingtang explained patiently.

The Night Soul Beast’s eyes shifted.

“I am not interested in the fiendcelestial’s tomb, but those men have captured my friend. You also saw the situation. You want to protect the fiendcelestial’s tomb while I want to save my friend. Why don’t we join forces?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

There was only one way to save Mu Ziying. Although risky, she had no choice but to take a bet.

The Night Soul Beast sized up Ye Qingtang, a sliver of panic surfacing in its eyes.

No one on the outside knew about the Night Soul Beasts’ hibernation period. But with the participation of the Temple of Paragon, the Evil Soul Forest was now in grave danger.

But this mere human wished to join forces with it? And against so many powerful factions? What a joke.

The Night Soul Beast had little regard for Ye Qingtang’s powers. But it was in her possession now and it had no choice but to keep humble.

The Night Soul Beast narrowed its eyes.

As long as it could temporarily escape from this human’s clutches, it could immediately swallow her and then go and kill off all those who dared to invade the fiendcelestial’s tomb!

The Night Soul Beast pondered for a short while before finally nodding at Ye Qingtang.

The hint of a smile flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

The Night Soul Beast quietly concealed the murderous intent in its eyes.

It would kill her the moment she turned around!

Just as the Night Soul Beast was secretly preparing to attack, Ye Qingtang said as she continued to stare at it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Before we join forces, it’s best that we sign a contract first.”

The Night Soul Beast: “...”

What?

Contract?!

The Night Soul Beast was stunned.

“For you to join forces with me, you naturally can’t remain in this state. But once you recover your powers, I will not be a match for you. By then, I will be helpless if you wish to just kill me off, right?”

After all, she had been able to capture this Night Soul Beast only by catching it unawares. By releasing it now, it would be like unleashing a tiger from its cage.
