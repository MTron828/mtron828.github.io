Back then, based on the aura of the white-haired elder, Ye Qingtang guessed that he must have come from the Second Domain. Now it seemed that her guess was right. This lady in green actually followed the white-haired elder to the Second Domain.

In the Land of Infinite Demons, Ye Qingtang once heard the lady in green refer to the white-haired elder as her master. It seemed that she had joined a major force in the Second Domain.

Of course, with the lady in green’s martial art talents, she was indeed worthy. Ye Qingtang would not refute this point.

“Holy Lady, who is this?” The Blood Moon Elder was stunned by the appearance of the lady in green, who was sneering coldly. What was this? They had yet to settle one problem and another was already cropping up?

“My enemy.” Ye Qingtang gave a brief reply.

The Blood Moon Elder’s lips twitched slightly. “Holy Lady, after my death… it seems like you have made many enemies. Look, Holy Lady, you can’t live without me. Although you are unparalleled in the world, you have little experience. You can’t compare to me in that aspect. Don’t worry. With my glib tongue, I can make us more friends and fewer enemies.”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. Ever since his resurrection, his shamelessness had been honed to perfection. However, the Blood Moon Elder was right about one thing.

The Blood Moon Elder had lived in the First Domain for countless years and even with her two lives, she had not lived as long as him.

“Little b*tch, you snatched my bloodline back then… Today, I will dig out your bones and eat your flesh.” The lady in green stared at Ye Qingtang with a cold glint in her eyes that would send chills down one’s spine.

Ye Qingtang sneered quietly. Back then at the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, she did not have any intention of stealing any bloodline. It was the lady in green who had nefarious motives. In trying to steal something, she ended up losing everything. Not only did she fail to snatch the bloodline, but she had also lost one herself. Now, she was accusing Ye Qingtang of being the thief. What a joke. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“That’s her, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.”

Suddenly, a middle-aged man in a golden robe walked over slowly with a faint smile on his face. The middle-aged man seemed to be walking slowly, but he crossed a thousand meters with a single step. In a flash, he arrived beside everyone.

“Mighty one…”

When they saw the man in golden robes, the lady in green and her group greeted the middle-aged man respectfully.

The middle-aged man did not speak. His eyes landed on Ye Qingtang and he smiled. “Little girl, follow me.”

“Holy Lady, you’re really popular…” The Blood Moon Elder said softly.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered. She had a sudden idea.

“This… I’m afraid that’s not possible.” Ye Qingtang said to the middle-aged man in the golden robe, “First-come-first-serve. I’ve already agreed to leave with that elder. How about this? If I survive them, you can look for me when the time comes. I’ll leave with you then. How about that?”

“Oh?”

The golden-robed man’s gaze landed on the golden book elder and his group. He smiled and said, “Could you give me some face and let me take this little girl away?”

“Face… face?”

Everyone behind the golden book elder burst into laughter.

“Are you worthy enough for us to do that?” The golden book elder stared at the golden-robed middle-aged man as he spoke impassively.

“Oh, I am not worthy enough?” Although the golden-robed middle-aged man had a smile on his face, it was a smile that would make one shudder.
