Chapter 698: Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord (5)

The Dragon-Tiger General was naturally not a fool to be able to attain this position under Qin Long. He hurriedly said, “We did not know our manners and spoiled your mood. It is right for us to compensate for our fault.”

“Oh? How do you intend on compensating?” Ye Qingtang said without emotion.

In reality, it was very easy to kill the Dragon-Tiger General with her skills. However… she had just come to Nine Nights Dynasty and did not plan on stirring up so much trouble.

Killing Shangguan Rui was at most a personal grudge, but the Dragon-Tiger General was a minister in the Nine Nights Dynasty. If she killed him with everyone watching, she would be in quite a lot of trouble. Luckily… using his life to exchange for some items was pretty good too.

“It’s all… up to you,” the Dragon-Tiger General said.

Ye Qingtang flashed a faint smile and said, “I heard that the Exquisite Jade in your family clan is not bad.”

The Dragon-Tiger General trembled.

The Exquisite Jade was an item handed down by the ancestors of his family clan and was extremely effective in nourishing the spirit root.

Ye Qingtang knew about this Exquisite Jade from Ouyang Qian in her previous life.

“Why? Unwilling?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly and placed the Demonic Blood Sword against the Dragon-Tiger General’s neck immediately.

With the cold blade placed against his skin, the Dragon-Tiger General paled in shock and did not dare to bargain. No matter how precious a family heirloom was, his own life was more important.

“Willing, willing…” The Dragon-Tiger General hurriedly removed the Exquisite Jade that he brought.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled into a smile as she looked at the Exquisite Jade in her hands.

“Get lost,” Ye Qingtang said coldly and kicked the Dragon-Tiger General away.

The Dragon-Tiger General stood up and fled in a flurry, not daring to remain there a second longer.

The onlookers cluck their tongues in wonder. If they did not witness it personally, who would have thought that the Dragon-Tiger General, who threw his weight around in the monarch city, would actually end up in this plight today?

Not only was his son killed right before his eyes, he still had to personally hand his family heirloom to the murderer.

Everyone was filled with reverence towards that beautiful young mean, who stood there with an outstanding manner.

The blue-haired girl was stupefied as she looked at the young man. Never would she have thought that the person who saved her would actually be such a powerful person.

“Why are you still spacing out over there? Follow me.” Ye Qingtang turned to look at the blue-haired girl who was in a daze.

The girl returned to her senses and followed behind Ye Qingtang immediately. She had a feeling that the calamity was over, and she felt she had a new lease of life.

“Eh, where’s your Yuan Returning Stone?” The little white tiger spoke to the blue-haired girl. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The blue-haired girl hurriedly took out a Yuan Returning Stone that was about the size of half a palm. After receiving it, Ye Qingtang took a look at the little white tiger, whose face was brimming with satisfaction, and found it a little funny.

“I still have something on. Wear this first.” Ye Qingtang took out a shirt from her space ring and tossed it to the shabbily-dressed young girl.

“Thank… Thank you, benefactor…” The blue-haired girl hurriedly wore it.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything further. After this drama, she had taken up quite some time and had no mind to care about anything else as she walked straight to her destination.

The blue-haired girl did not dare to utter a word and obediently followed behind Ye Qingtang.
