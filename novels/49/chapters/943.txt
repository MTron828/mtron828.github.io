Chapter 944 We Meet Again (2)

Before Ye Qingtang could speak further, her gaze suddenly fell onto something next to Ling Yan.

The silver wolf, who had been lost in the previous chaos, was now standing quietly next to Ling Yan.

“Xiao Guai, where have you been?”

Ye Qingtang looked at the silver wolf with some surprise.

The silver wolf was quietly following Ling Yan and seemed intent on ignoring Ye Qingtang.

This was the first time that the silver wolf had ignored her, and Ye Qingtang felt that it was rather strange.

She knew that the silver wolf was proud and aloof. It usually ignored everyone.

But she was the only exception.

Now…

Why was Xiao Guai ignoring her too?

“Does Miss Ye like my silver wolf?” Ling Yan laughed when he saw the situation.

“Yours?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback when she heard Ling Yan’s words.” Xiao Guai is mine.”

“Very well, since Miss Ye says so, then it belongs to Miss Ye.” Ling Yan nodded and turned to look at the silver wolf. “Hadn’t you better go over.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“ARH-W000000!”

When it heard Ling Yan’s words, the silver wolf unwillingly walked over to Ye Qingtang. But it looked back every few steps, as if it could not bear to leave Ling Yan.

Ye Qingtang was speechless when she saw the silver wolf’s resentful expression.

What is wrong with Xiao Guai?

Could it be that Ling Yan demonic intelligence had even allowed him to subdue the wolf?!

“That’s right, the Devouring Bloodline. Miss Ye needs to use it cautiously. Do not allow anyone to find out about it.” Just as Ye Qingtang was puzzling over the sudden change in Xiao Guai’s personality, Ling Yan suddenly spoke to her.

When he mentioned the Devouring Bloodline, Ye Qingtang’s earlier suspicions awoke in her heart again. She looked at Ling Yan.

“Ling Yan, was this a part of your scheme… how did you know that the girl had the Devouring Bloodline… how did this happen and how will it end?”

Ye Qingtang was unable to understand Ling Yan’s schemes. Probably no one on earth could guess what Ling Yan was thinking.

“That girl was a member of the Jiang family,” said Ling Yan.

Ye Qingtang was not surprised. The fact that she possessed the Heavenly Demon Bloodline meant she was probably from the Jiang family.

“Let me tell you.” Little azure dragon, who had followed Ling Yan, cleared its throat and said.

“Ling Yan is familiar with the Jiang family. The girl left the Jiang family when she was young and traveled to the Second Domain. After she grew up, her Heavenly Demon Bloodline transformed into the Devouring Bloodline. The Jiang family found out and searched far and wide for the girl.

“Then Ling Yan received news that the girl had reached this mainland and entered the Dragon Vein. The girl had previously devoured someone else’s Phoenix Bloodline. After entering the Dragon Vein, she was sure to head towards the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix… Further, as Miss Ye’s only opponent was the girl, one of two outcomes were certain to arise.”

“What are the two outcomes?” The little white tiger was curious.

“The first outcome was that the girl would obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.” The little azure dragon spoke mysteriously. “The second outcome was that Ye Qingtang would obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.”

“If the girl obtained the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, after she saw the power of Ye Qingtang’s Rise of the Phoenix, she would certainly try to devour it. However, once the girl and Miss Ye crossed swords, Miss Ye’s Heavenly Demon Pearl would certainly react and seize the power of the girl’s Devouring Bloodline.”

Little azure dragon smiled and said, “The second outcome was that Ye Qingtang would obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, and the girl, unwilling to resign herself, would seize Miss Ye’s Divine Phoenix Bloodline.”
