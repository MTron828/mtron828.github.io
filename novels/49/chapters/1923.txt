Chapter 1924: Unleash The Demon Dragon (3)

Indeed it was Ye Qingtang riding upon Ming Di’s back. Her already-slender figure looked even smaller in contrast to Ming Di’s massive body.

As she surveyed the ancient clans gathered down on the ground, all she saw was them staring at her with equally dumbstruck expressions. She immediately felt more steady.

She only truly realized just how gigantic Ming Di was the moment she released it. She finally understood why the Holy Lord of Shadows had to construct such a vast abyss prison.

Ming Di was huge! There was no way he could have been imprisoned in any place smaller.

If Ming Di charged straight down, he would easily flatten the entire Temple of Shadows. Even more shocking was the fact that Ming Di’s aura increased by more than tenfold after leaving the abyss prison!

“Are these the stupid tiny bugs who dared to belittle our Temple of Shadows?” Ming Di surveyed the front of the Temple of Shadows with his blood-red eyes. It instantly spotted the “tiny” ancient clan members.

The faces of the “tiny” ancient clan members immediately darkened on hearing Ming Di’s words.

What was going on?

When did they ever belittle the Temple of Shadows?

Utter nonsense!

The hearts of everyone leaped in fright at the sight of Ming Di charging toward them with gaping jaws.

“It’s not them.” Ye Qingtang hurriedly corrected. She was worried that Ming Di would just swallow the whole bunch of them if she didn’t quickly clarify.

“Whether or not it’s them, they have to die anyway. I should just kill them off now.” Ming Di didn’t care whether they were the culprits. In its eyes, apart from the Undead Clan of the Temple of Shadows, all other living creatures in the mainland had to die. It was just a matter of sooner or later. It saw no issue with just killing them off now.

Ye Qingtang was nearly driven mad by Ming Di’s violent character.

It really was an insane murderous monster!

No wonder the Holy Lord of Shadows had to imprison this fellow. With such a character, it would be making enemies left and right for the Temple of Shadows.

Ming Di continued to charge toward those ancient clan members as he spoke. Their faces turned from dark to pale in an instant.

“Holy Lord, we have no ill intentions at all. We would never dare to belittle the Temple of Shadows. We... only have the highest respect for the Holy Lord’s powers. Holy Lord...”

“Yes, yes, yes. Holy Lord, please be appeased!”

The ancient clan members had no idea what Ye Qingtang was saying to Ming Di. They only heard the dragon saying that he was going to kill them all, and so they immediately started to beg for mercy.

They were here to seek help, not death! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“They can find the whereabouts of that person. Spare their lives for now so that they can provide us with information. With their mediocre abilities, we can kill them off anytime we want.” Ye Qingtang understood Ming Di’s character. It was impossible to command it not to kill anyone.

Even the real Holy Lord of Shadows was unable to do that. As a result, Ye Qingtang decided to play along with Ming Di’s insane character.

The demon dragon’s gaping jaws snapped at the ancient clan members in contemplation, while their hearts were all thumping wildly.

From his position on the ground, Ming Wang’s eyes darkened and he stared at Ye Qingtang with a conflicted expression. He had seen the Holy Lord of Shadows fighting alongside Ming Di countless times. When the Holy Lord imprisoned Ming Di, he thought there was no way she would ever release Ming Di.

He had never expected...

In the end, she had still released Ming Di.
