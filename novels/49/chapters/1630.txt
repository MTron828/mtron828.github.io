Chapter 1631: Star Ring (3)

Ye Qingtang picked up the little white tiger and stood up. She was about to use the last of her time here to find a wider space and wait for the constellation gate to open.

But when they exited the cave, the fog that filled the air suddenly changed subtly. When they breathed in the air, there was a strange, burning sensation. If Ye Qingtang’s cultivation realm had not advanced, the air would have burnt her lungs when she breathed it in.

“What’s the matter with this world?” Ye Qingtang was puzzled.

At that moment, a thunderous drumming sound rang out. The drumming noise was so loud it hurt their eardrums. Ye Qingtang only listened for a moment, and the vibrations caused two tiny cracks to form at the corners of her ears. Her chest ached from the vibration of the drumming.

Boom!

A huge black shadow slowly emerged from the mist and drew closer to them. Every time it advanced a little, it made a clear ringing sound like that of a brass bell.

Ye Qingtang hurriedly picked the little white tiger and hid, only to see the gigantic shadow slowly pass near them.

The shadow was so tall they could not see the top of it at a glance. It seemed to be dragging something along and moved very slowly.

Ye Qingtang soon saw that a shattered bronze statue was being dragged along on the ground. The bronze statue was several hundred meters in size. The outer layer of bronze that covered it was completely smashed. Trickles of black fluid seeped from under the bronze layer, and they could vaguely see something flesh-like wriggling under the bronze layer.

The clear ringing sound like that of a brass bell was caused by the bronze layer bumping against the ground.

The bronze statue suddenly came to a stop a few hundred meters away from Ye Qingtang. The head, which was covered with cracks, faced Ye Qingtang. The dull copper eyes seemed to look straight through Ye Qingtang’s disguise. As she looked at it, the huge cracked mouth suddenly split open slightly in a sinister smile.

Puff!

A huge head lowered itself through the fog. It looked like neither man nor beast and was very peculiar. It abruptly opened its huge mouth and chewed on the bronze statue’s head. Large quantities of black liquid sprayed from the injured areas, and a large proportion of the bronze statue’s head was immediately bitten off...

What on earth is that?

What is that bronze statue?

And what is that monster chewing on the bronze statue?

Ye Qingtang was filled with questions, but her body was abruptly seized by a force, and the constellation gate suddenly formed between her.

The sparkles were especially conspicuous in the dark surroundings.

The monster chewing on the bronze statue sensed the gleam of light and suddenly raised its head. The mouth filled with bits of meat and black blood suddenly let out an earth-shattering roar.

Alarmed, Ye Qingtang did not dare to stay any longer. She hurriedly picked up the little white tiger and rushed through the constellation entrance. As the constellation entrance closed, Ye Qingtang saw an enormous claw, large enough to cover the sky, hurtling towards her!

Boom!

The instant the giant claw descended, the constellation gate suddenly disappeared.

When she came to her senses, Ye Qingtang realized she was in the Illusory Void. The radiant body of the God of Nature was wriggling about indolently.

“Hmm?” The radiant body noticed that Ye Qingtang had returned, but it seemed to have made an interesting discovery, and it circled Ye Qingtang. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang saw that the radiant body was “looking” behind her. She turned involuntarily and saw that her shoulder had somehow become stained with a patch of black.
