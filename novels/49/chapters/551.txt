Chapter 552 Replenish for Prosperity (1)

“Today, I will kill you anyway to benefit the world!”

The Ultimate Elder’s eyes flickered. He smashed his palm down towards the Blood Moon Holy Lord without any sign. Just the force of the palm seemed to be able to shake the entire earth.

However, the Blood Moon Holy Lord did not bother to fight against him. He faded into the void and disappeared.

“Blood Moon Holy Lord, you cultivated the recurrent fiend skills, and that led to the development of the mental demons. If you still choose to run away, it will accelerate the development of your mental demons, and then… I’ll see whether you really enter the rebirth cycle!” The Ultimate Elder gritted his teeth as the Blood Moon Holy Lord ran away again. He immediately chased after him.

“Holy Lord!”

The Blood Moon Division Head and the rest were shocked. Ye Qingtang blocked their way when they were about to follow up.

“Holy Lady…” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The Blood Moon Division Head Jiang Chen felt perplexed.

“Even the Blood Moon Holy Lord is not able to fight against the Ultimate Elder. Are you going to sacrifice yourself for no reason if you follow up?” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

“But…”

Shuo Tianzang and Soul Severing Troll knew that Ye Qingtang’s words were reasonable, but they could not be relieved.

“The Ultimate Elder had chased the Blood Moon Holy Lord for five hundred years and did not succeed. Do you think he will succeed this time?” Ye Qingtang said as she saw how disturbed the people of the Blood Moon Sect were.

Without giving them any chance to say anything again, Ye Qingtang waved her hand and said, “You should leave now.”

“Holy Lady… but…”

The Blood Moon Division Head still wanted to say something.

“There’s no but’s. I order you as the Blood Moon Holy Lady, leave now!” Ye Qingtang frowned.

The super sects would return soon when they sensed the breath that the Ultimate Elder left. People of the Blood Moon Sect would not have the chance to leave alive then.

“Yes!”

The Blood Moon Division Head Jiang Chen had to listen to the order together with other Branch Masters.

“Master, Grand Elder, please pack up and leave with me and the Blood Moon Sect!”

Ye Qingtang said and looked towards Elder Mo and the rest in the Xuanling Sect.

However, the Grand Elder shook his head and sighed. “Qingtang, look at those disciples.”

Ye Qingtang scanned around, and there were more than a few hundred disciples with severe injuries.

“They treated the Xuanling Sect as their home and decided to stay to protect our sect. They are injured severely, and they will definitely die if there is no treatment given to them… As the Grand Elder of the sect, how can I leave my family for my own safety?” The Grand Elder sighed again.

Elder Mo and the rest also shook their head upon hearing the Grand Elder’s words.

Though they would survive if they left with Ye Qingtang… what could the disciples do?

As the higher-ups of the sect, how could they leave the disciples here and escape?

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, there were few hundreds of strong breaths approaching.

“It’s the three super sects! They sensed the remaining breath of the Ultimate Elder and are coming back!” the Blood Demon said.

“Holy Lady, can you pass me your token?” said a Blood Moon Branch Master who was an expert in array formation.

Ye Qingtang did not hesitate and gave him the blood token.

“Holy Lady, there is the divine power of the Holy Lord left in the token. I can use the divine power to create a barrier outside the Xuanling Sect. That way, no one will be able to enter the Xuanling Sect from outside, but people of Xuanling Sect can go out anytime,” the elder said.

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang was stunned slightly. So there was the

Blood Moon Holy Lord’s divine power left in the token…
