Chapter 1288: The Eldest Prince (2)

Although Ye Qingtang was pretty fond of this little fellow, he was, after all, the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows. He was nice to her only because he thought she was the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows. If her true identity were to be revealed…

He would be the first to try to kill her.

“Come in.” Ye Qingtang sighed inwardly but put on a smile to welcome Ming Gu.

Ming Gu rushed in and threw himself into Ye Qingtang’s arms. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Ah Yao, can I sleep with you over the next few days…” Ming Gu rubbed Ye Qingtang’s arm as he gazed at her with large, liquid eyes.

“Ming Gu… you…” Ye Qingtang tried to tactfully reject Ming Gu “attempt” when someone suddenly knocked on the door.

“Come in.”

The Eldest Prince appeared at the door with a few servants in tow.

“Elder Ye, Holy Son, Ming Gu.” The Eldest Prince spoke graciously with a smile. “Meeting you has been a rare opportunity, so I have prepared some presents.”

With that, the Eldest Prince lifted his chin slightly, and the servants that followed him humbly came forward. They placed a few brocade-wrapped boxes and a crystal bottle before Ye Qingtang and Ming Gu.

Ming Gu frowned slightly. He was clearly displeased that someone had interrupted his time alone with Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept over the presents on the table. All the items were exquisitely wrapped, but Ye Qingtang could smell the faint scent of blood.

The crystal bottle in particular gave off the strongest scent of blood. The transparent crystal bottle held some liquid that was crimson, like fresh blood, although a shade darker.

“I happened to learn of some of Holy Son, Ming Gu’s hobbies. It was hastily prepared today. I hope Holy Son Ming Gu will graciously accept it, even if it is somewhat lacking.” The Eldest Prince smiled, and his gaze fell on the crystal bottle filled with the dark red liquid.

“This is blood essence, distilled from the blood of a hundred young girls who just turned sixteen years old. I hope the Holy Son, Ming Gu, will enjoy it.” Since the Eldest Prince was cooperating with the Temple of Shadows, he had secretly investigated the tastes of the senior members of the Temple of Shadows.

In the course of this, he learned that the Holy Son, Ming Gu, was a mutant Undead and liked fresh blood, so he had made preparations.

After hearing the Eldest Prince’s words, Ming Gu’s unhappy look diminished a little. His gaze passed over the blood essence in the bottle, but he did not immediately reach out for it. He only subconsciously glanced at Ye Qingtang.

Ah Yao did not like him to be too brutal.

Ye Qingtang received a jolt when she saw the bottle of blood essence.

She had heard of blood essence before. The blood needed to be extracted while the person was still alive. The fresh blood was slowly drained drop by drop, to the last drop. Furthermore, blood essence of the highest quality had strict requirements for the person whose blood was being extracted.

After the fresh blood was distilled, it could only be kept for a very short period of time. After two days, the purity of the blood essence would deteriorate, and the color would fade.

But the bottle of blood essence gifted by the Eldest Prince had such a deep color that it was apparent that…

It had been freshly extracted.

They had only been here for half a day, but the Eldest Prince had already distilled this bottle of blood essence.

Ye Qingtang could almost imagine the Eldest Prince immediately ordering someone to prepare it after he had met them.

A hundred young girls had been instantly and casually murdered.

Just to provide the Eldest Prince with a present…
