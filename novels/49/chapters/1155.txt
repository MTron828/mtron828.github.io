Chapter 1156: The Spirit Energy Crisis (2)

Apart from him, almost no one from the remaining obscure ancient clans lived over ten thousand years.

These obscure ancient clans and Divine King Luo Xue did not live in the same generation. While they were obscure ancient clans, they were the descendants of those ancient figures from ten thousand years ago.

In terms of skills, it was impossible for them to be compared to that Yang Lord Tenth Heaven person whom Divine King Luo Xue killed.

Endless explosions could be heard at this instant. The Pagoda Sword Master’s side and the You Ancient Clan’s side were locked in a battle. Immensely horrifying martial auras crashed into one another, and remarkable skills were executed. One could hardly distinguish the situation with the naked eye.

“Holy Lady, are we going to join the battle?”

The Blood Moon Elder was standing beside Ye Qingtang currently. The two of them had long been ignored as though they did not exist.

Ardor and zeal coursed through the Blood Moon Elder’s blood as he watched the great match. His eyes were burning while his unrivaled body could not hold back any longer, and he wanted to show off his skills… By then, he would definitely become the center of attention…

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply and shook her head.

“We are not joining the battle?” The Blood Moon Elder was slightly surprised and did not know Ye Qingtang’s intention.

The Pagoda Sword Master and Ultimate Elder’s side fell behind in terms of numbers and skills when fighting against the Ancient You Clan. Once Ye Qingtang and he, two top Yang Lords, participated, there would be an evident improvement in the situation.

However, Ye Qingtang did not say anything and inspected the sky instead.

The spirit energy of this mainland was expanded increasingly as the battle intensified.

If it expanded to the limit, there would only be one possibility…

This mainland would no longer be able to bear this pressure…

The pressure of the spirit energy from the outer world would completely crush this mainland!

By then, everyone did not need to continue fighting as everyone… would die…

“Look at the spirit energy of this mainland.”

Ye Qingtang told the Blood Moon Elder.

“Spirit energy?”

Confusion was etched the Blood Moon Elder’s face as he did not know what Ye Qingtang meant. He looked up instinctively.

His expression changed drastically a moment later, and horror filled his wide eyes.

“This… This..” The Blood Moon Elder trembled slightly. “The spirit energy of this mainland is compressed rapidly and inflating outward…”

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“If… this goes on, this mainland will definitely be unable to bear the pressure of the spirit energy… and explode…” The Blood Moon Elder was astonished.

Once this mainland could not bear the pressure of the spirit energy and exploded, no one dream shall of leaving this place alive. The people of this mainland and the Ancient You Clan members would all die here!

Blood Moon Elder naturally knew the reason behind the compression and expansion of the spirit energy.

The spirit energy in this mainland was thin from the start, and this mainland was classified as a low-level mainland. Normally speaking, it could only withstand the aura of an ordinary Yang Lord.

However, with Ancient You Clan, Pagoda Sword Master, and those powerful ancient clans gathered at one place currently, all their forces, including the Pagoda Sword Master’s Sword Dao willpower, had greatly surpassed the power that a Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm could control and even more so, the limit that this mainland could withstand…

Now that all the excess force that this mainland could withstand exploded in one area, this was simply suicidal…
