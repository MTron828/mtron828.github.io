Although he could still handle them, he no longer had an absolute advantage. The power held by the Ancient You Clan was indeed unfathomable. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Still on the sidelines, Ye Qingtang observed Ming Di battling those three youths. They had perfect coordination and although Ming Di was still more powerful than them, he could not destroy all of them in one go.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help feeling somewhat worried. Meanwhile, the Ancient You Clan warden didn’t look too good either.

He had expected the first batch of youths to fail.

After all, the disparity between Ming Di and them was too wide. But these three youths were considered among the top in their batch. And yet, they were unable to handle Ming Di.

The warden’s face turned grim and he shot a discreet look at the sentry beside him. He uttered some commands in a low voice and the sentry immediately turned and ran into the canyon.

Inside the canyon, a white-haired elder was standing inside a pavilion. A row of spirit pearls was arranged before him, shimmering softly.

Some of those spirit pearls were already cracked. But there were so many spirit pearls that barely anyone would notice those cracks.

“Elder, the Temple of Shadows’ Ming Di is too powerful. The three brothers are unable to handle him either...” The sentry hurried over with his report.

The elder had his hands clasped behind his back. He maintained his neutral expression.

“Useless garbage,” the elder said mildly, all the while keeping his eyes fixed upon the spirit pearls.

As the elder spoke, cracks suddenly appeared in three of the spirit pearls in the front row. The elder narrowed his eyes.

Those three youths had been killed by Ming Di.

“The Temple of Shadows’ Ming Di has indeed lived up to his reputation.” The elder gave a cold laugh.

The power of that demon dragon, who had once fought alongside the Holy Lord of Shadows, was enough to dominate the entire mainland.

Nevertheless...

“Uh...” The sentry looked somewhat worried.

The elder lifted his hand and pointed at the foremost spirit pearl. “There’s no need to mess around with the Temple of Shadows any longer. We will send him.”

The sentry shuddered when he saw which spirit pearl the elder was pointing at.

“But... that guy...”

Before the sentry could finish his sentence, the elder shot him a look. The sentry broke out in cold sweat and didn’t dare to utter another word. He immediately turned and went to carry out his orders.

...

Outside the canyon, Ming Di gazed down at the three youths collapsed beneath his feet. But the arrogant light in his eyes had faded a little.

Indeed he had won but it was a tough win. The powers of those three youths were exemplary and they had perfect coordination and camaraderie. Even Ming Di had found it somewhat challenging to defeat them.

The ancient clan folks heaved a sigh of relief after witnessing the defeat of those three youths. If they hadn’t seen it with their own eyes, they would never have believed that there could be youths who were that powerful in this world.

The amount of power possessed seemed beyond the bounds of the First Domain.

But just as everyone heaved a sigh of relief, a horse carriage came rolling out of the canyon. The carriage appeared very dense and heavy. It was entirely black and bound all over with chains, which made clinking sounds the entire way.

Everyone instantly went on high alert again at the sight of that horse carriage. Although the carriage was still quite some distance away, they could already feel a powerful aura radiating from it.

Even from that distance, they were already finding it difficult to breathe from that oppressive aura.
