Chapter 1910: Enemy Attack (1)

Just as Ye Qingtang was mulling over this, Xue Fu hurried into the grand hall. He looked very grim.

“Holy Lord, Holy Son, someone is causing trouble outside.”

“Who?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Xue Fu shook his head. “I don’t know. He is demanding to see the Holy Lord.”

Before Ye Qingtang could reply, Ming Wang’s face instantly became very stern.

“Xue Fu, you have become increasingly negligent and careless.”

Xue Fu was momentarily startled before immediately getting down on one knee.

Ming Wang said coldly, “What kind of place is the Temple of Shadows? Who is this person who can demand to see the Holy Lord as and when he pleases?”

Xue Fu’s face turned pale as he tried to defend himself... “This person is... very powerful. I couldn’t stop him. I am the useless one. Holy Lord, please see fit to punish me!”

Ye Qingtang was astounded by Xue Fu’s words. She knew just how strong Xue Fu was. Although he paled in comparison to Ming Wang and Ming Gu, he was still amongst the elite in the Central Mainland.

Even Xue Fu could not handle this person?

Ming Wang’s eyes also darkened.

“I want to see just who this person is.” With that, Ming Wang took his leave from Ye Qingtang and turned to leave the grand hall.

As Ye Qingtang gazed after Ming Wang’s departing figure, a sense of unease rose in her heart.

Outside the Temple of Shadows, a crowd of anxious and tense undead was keeping a close watch on an effeminate-looking youth.

The youth looked like he was in his early teens. With long, jet-black hair that flowed loosely behind his back, it contrasted with his fair face, which was pale to the point of looking a little sickly.

The youth had very effeminate features. His skin was fair and flawless, while his rosy lips were curled up in a coquettish smile.

“Please ask your Holy Lord to come out. I am not interested in dealing with a bunch of minions.” The youth lifted his chin and crossed his arms over his chest. He surveyed the bunch of undead with scornful eyes.

The corpses of several undead were already strewn beside the youth.

Even the charming Lady Ghost was in a pathetic state now. She was being supported by an elder, as a large piece of her shoulder had been sliced off. Spiderweb-like cracks had also appeared on her human form.

“Who the hell are you? Do you think you are fit to meet our Holy Lord?” Lady Ghost gritted her teeth.

The effeminate-looking youth narrowed his eyes at Lady Ghost. “Don’t think that just because you are called the Undead Clan that you really won’t die. I couldn’t be bothered with you earlier but if you continue to whine, I will make sure you completely disintegrate from this earth.”

A lavender-colored flame suddenly ignited as the youth spoke. The flame didn’t appear hot at all but the surrounding temperature suddenly increased.

Lady Ghost gritted her teeth. She knew very well that she was no match for this youth. They had barely exchanged moves but she was already half-dead.

The youth was far more powerful than Lady Ghost could imagine.

Lady Ghost was also considered one of the elite practitioners in Central Mainland, but even she couldn’t withstand a single blow from this youth. She had never been so humiliated.

“What a bold statement.” A cold voice suddenly resonated out from the Temple of Shadows.

Lady Ghost felt a burst of joy at that voice. In the next second, Ming Wang suddenly landed in front of Lady Ghost.

“Holy Son Ming Wang,” Lady Ghost greeted him.
