“Yes.” Qin Chen nodded.

If a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord could be used for oneself, it would naturally be a doubling of might. However, if not, it was a huge latent threat.

“Ouyang Qian is back in the monarch city now. I heard that she was rather traumatized from the trip to the mystic realm. You can make use of this opportunity and pacify her.” Qin Long looked at his son and continued on.

“The Ouyang family clan has a powerful force in the Nine Nights Dynasty, and Ouyang Qian is Ouyang Clan Master’s beloved daughter. Even her other brothers are not as doted on as her. If you can marry Ouyang Qian, it will be extremely beneficial for us in the future.”

“I understand. I’ve already interacted with her quite a number of times previously. Looking at her attitude, she does have some feelings for me. I believe that this can be accomplished in no time,” Qin Chen said slowly, confident that he could take Ouyang Qian down.

In the entire Nine Nights Dynasty, Qin Chen’s position and appearance were considered the cream of the crop, and there was barely anyone who could contest against him. Moreover, his family and Ouyang Qian’s were well-matched in social status.

“That will be best.” Qin Long nodded slightly.

“Investigate the background of that half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and interact with Ouyang Qian. You must not slacken your efforts in these two matters. The Tiangang Sect Master has sent someone to confer with me recently, and I will not be able to leave to do anything else in this period of time.”

Qin Chen nodded with smiles in his eyes.

Currently, his father, Qin Long, could be said to hold absolute power in Nine Nights Dynasty, and that young Emperor was fooled to be extremely obedient. If he could gain the support of Tiangang Sect, a super sect, there was no one in the entire Nine Nights Dynasty who could shake his father’s position.

“Tiangang Sect already has the intention the work with Nine Nights Dynasty since some time ago, though the previous Emperor was unwilling to. However… it’s not something he can control anymore.” Qin Long’s lips curled into a sneer.

Qin Chen did not say anything and seemed to be in thought as he looked at his father’s expression. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Nine Nights Dynasty’s previous Emperor was in the prime of his life when he suddenly came down with a severe illness, and he had to pass his position down to his son. As for the reason behind the previous Emperor’s sickness, it was a question to the entire imperial court.

However, Qin Chen understood one point.

Ever since the previous Emperor abdicated, his father had increasing authority in the Nine Nights Dynasty, and the young Emperor was all the more trustful of his father.

Was his father involved in the previous Emperor’s illness?

While Qin Chen was curious, he did not ask about it.

“Oh right. Fuling city seems to be quite ill-behaved these few months,” Qin Long suddenly said.

“The City Lord of Fuling City is an official who served the royal family for a long time. Although he is far from the central authority, he still acts haughtily,” Qin Chen said.

“Ha… didn’t he just serve that person before? That person has already disappeared for over ten years now. Who else in the Nine Nights Dynasty remembers her? Since Fuling City is not behaving, let the Emperor decree that the City Lord of Fuling City makes a trip to the monarch city.” As Qin Long spoke, he spread out an imperial decree on his table and wrote a few lines. Afterward, he took out the Emperor’s jade seal which he carried on him and directly stamped on the imperial decree that he personally wrote.

“Have someone send it to Fuling City.”

“Yes.” Qin Chen received the imperial decree, and a scoff flashed across his eyes.
