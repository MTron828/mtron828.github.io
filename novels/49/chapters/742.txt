Chapter 743: Causing Trouble (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Admirable Sky Peak disciples had only heard that Ye Qingtang used the back door to be apprenticed to the Valley Master and that her spirit root was not as good as some ordinary disciples.

They did not have any ties with Ye Qingtang from the start, and now that they saw Ye Qingtang stirring these troubles, many Admirable Sky Peak disciples felt conflicted about that new Valley Master’s disciple. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Only Sheng Qianyu showed a trace of nervousness and bewilderment.

Others did not know why Ye Qingtang offended these Blue Cloud Peak people, but he was more than clear.

Ye Qingtang clearly did it for him…

However, never would Sheng Qianyu have thought that this matter would actually offend Blue Cloud Peak’s top disciple, Li Jingwen.

It should be known that Li Jingwen was extremely skilled, and in the entire Admirable Sky Peak, only their eldest senior brother, Gu Yihan, could contend against him.

“No… Senior Brother Ye… Senior Brother Ye…” Sheng Qianyu tried to explain to the other disciples beside him, but he did not have any presence in the peak, and no one would hear him with all their attention focused on Li Jingwen.

Yan Shu knew Li Jingwen’s motive of coming here, but he tried to maintain a calm expression on his face.

“We will let Junior Brother Ye know about this. When he returns, he will find you to give you an explanation.”

“Let him know?” Li Jingwen arched his brows as he sized up Yan Shu.

“This is how Perfected Xuanchen teaches his disciples? Since you Admirable Sky Peak does not have any regard for Blue Cloud Peak, there’s no need for us to be polite anymore.”

Once Li Jingwen finished his sentence, his left hand suddenly balled into a fist and crashed into Yan Shu’s chest.

Yan Shu did not expect Li Jingwen to strike suddenly and was completely defenseless. Moreover, Li Jingwen’s skills were above his, and his fist directly landed on Yan Shu’s chest, which sent him flying out.

“Senior Brother Yan!” Yin Qingluo did not think that Li Jingwen would be so truculent and unreasonable. When she saw Yan Shu collapse on the ground and struggling to stand up, she instinctively clutched onto the sword at her waist.

“Junior Sister Yin… Do not!” Yan Shu supported himself up with difficulty and hurriedly stopped Yin Qingluo from attacking.

The knuckles of Yin Qingluo’s hand which gripped the sword whitened.

“Your Admirable Sky Peak is impertinent in this matter first. Since you all can attack disciples from other peaks in the valley so casually, you all should be able to tolerate these yourselves, right?” Li Jingwen laughed coldly. Looking at Yin Qingluo who wanted to unsheathe her sword, there was no regret on his face, and he was more arrogant instead.

“Li Jingwen! Don’t go too far in bullying others!” Yin Qingluo gritted her teeth as she glared at Li Jingwen. It was clearly their Blue Cloud Peak disciples who caused troubles over and over again, but they were playing the blame game now!

“Go too far in bullying others? I am bullying you all today. So what?” A sneer flashed across Li Jingwen’s eyes. Anyways, his Master had been dissatisfied with Perfected Xuanchen for a long time, and he could use this opportunity to teach the Admirable Sky Peak people a lesson. There was nothing to be scared of!

Then, Li Jingwen suddenly attacked Yin Qingluo.

Yin Qingluo unsheathed her sword immediately, but Li Jingwen’s skills were way above hers. Before she could make a move, Li Jingwen had already kicked Yin Qingluo away.
