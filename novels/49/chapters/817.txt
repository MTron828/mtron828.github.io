Chapter 818 He Who Has A Mind To Beat His Dog Will Easily Find His Stick (1)

Then, Ye Qingtang vanished with a flash, and there was no trace of her.

“Oh… I’m discovered.” Xuanyuan Lie scoffed immediately when he saw that Ye Qingtang disappeared without a trace, and he slowly descended from the sky.

“Ye Chen, do you really think that you can escape?!”

Xuanyuan Lie’s face was extremely dark.

However, laughter suddenly sounded from a dark corner right after he spoke.

“Who’s there?” Xuanyuan Lie frowned and shouted coldly.

“Xuanyuan Lie, are you looking for me?”

Ye Qingtang slowly walked out from the dark corner as she looked at Xuanyuan Lie indifferently. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ye Chen?!”

Xuanyuan Lie was slightly stunned when he saw Ye Qingtang.

Almost in a flash, Xuanyuan Lie’s expression darkened to an extreme.

Ye Qingtang did that on purpose just now with an aim of leading him to reveal himself!

“It’s me.” Ye Qingtang studied Xuanyuan Lie and snickered. “I was wondering which sacred existence was following me, but never have I thought that it’s a little trash fish.”

“Little trash fish…” A murderous intent emerged in Xuanyuan Lie’s eyes immediately after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words.

He, Xuanyuan Lie, was the number one talent in the younger generation of Falling Sky Valley. He was unparalleled among the Falling Sky Valley disciples, yet he was actually called a little trash fish by Ye Qingtang…

“Ye Chen, you’re really bold… Do you think that you have the right to speak to me on the same level just because you can defeat two outer sect disciples who just joined Peerless School?” Xuanyuan Lie’s lips tugged up slightly, and a martial aura filled the air instantly.

“Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three…” Ye Qingtang looked at Xuanyuan Lie thoughtfully.

It was understandable why Xuanyuan Lie was known as the number one talent in Falling Sky Valley as he already entered the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three despite his young age.

In her previous life, when she entered Falling Sky Valley, prodigies like Xuanyuan Lie were hard to be seen on usual days.

However, after her rebirth, such prodigies were no different from ants in her eyes.

At this moment, Xuanyuan Lie looked at Ye Qingtang and scoffed. “You must not be clear of my cultivation base.”

Those two outer sect disciples who just entered the Peerless School were merely at the early-stage of Martial Qi Level Three while Xuanyuan Lie had already entered the late-stage of Martial Qi Level Three. In a few more years, he would have the chance of attempting to advance to a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

He treated those two Peerless School people so solicitously not because of their skills but because they were disciples of the Peerless School.

“I am indeed not clear.” Ye Qingtang laughed.

“Oh… interesting. Things have reached this stage, and you still can laugh… So, are you ignorant or arrogant?” Xuanyuan Lie said coldly to Ye Qingtang.

“Xuanyuan Lie, what has your cultivation skills got to do with me? By blocking me, could it be that you want to show me the skills of your late-stage of Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three?” Ye Qingtang could not help but joke.

Xuanyuan Lie was taken aback after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words and frowned unconsciously.

Ye Qingtang was Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple, and even if she had left the valley, he did not seem to have any reasons to attack her either…

“Humph.” Then, Xuanyuan Lie kept all his martial aura back and shot a cold look at Ye Qingtang. “Ye Chen, you have offended two outer sect disciples of the Peerless School and have committed a serious offense. As a Falling Sky Valley disciple, I obviously cannot ignore it. Quickly return to the valley with me!”
