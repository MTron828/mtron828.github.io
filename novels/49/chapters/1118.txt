Chapter 1119 Wrath 3

“Who are you? How dare you poke your nose around?!” A You Ancient Clan disciple shot a cold look at Ye Qingtang, who suddenly appeared. When he noticed Ye Qingtang’s stunning beauty, a vile expression flashed across his eyes.

“Do you… also treat your mother this way?” There was no expression on Ye Qingtang’s face as she glanced at the You Ancient Clan disciple coldly.

That You Ancient Clan disciple’s face darkened immediately. With a sharp “clank”, he unsheathed his sword and wanted to slash at Ye Qingtang.

“I think you’re tired of living!”

Swoosh!

However, just as that You Ancient Clan was about to slash down, a gleam suddenly flashed by. Before he could come to his senses, blood spouted out from his neck!

The man’s body collapsed on the ground lifelessly and convulsed as blood gushed out from his neck.

Most likely, even when he died, he still did not understand when exactly he was injured…

The Shenchao Sect people were dumbstruck.

This lady who appeared from nowhere was actually so decisive in killing and killed a You Ancient Clan disciple in an instant!

The Shenchao Sect female disciple who was previously tugging onto Ye Qingtang’s clothes tightly widened her eyes in confusion.

There was no emotion on Ye Qingtang’s face. She glanced across the scene coldly and immediately noticed that many of the You Ancient Clan disciples were around Yin Yang Perfected Lord Fourth Heaven realm while those senior executives in black robes had not entered the Yang Lord realm either…

Logically speaking, the You Ancient Clan disciples should at least be in the Arcane Supremacy realm, and the senior executives should be in the Divine Arcane Supremacy realm. Even after entering this mainland, their martial skills would not be as weak as this…

Ye Qingtang’s instant kill of a You Ancient Clan disciple caught the attention of the You Ancient Clan people.

“Yang… Lord…”

The black-robed elderlies from You Ancient Clan saw Ye Qingtang, who suddenly appeared, and frowned deeply.

“Let’s go!”

After sensing Ye Qingtang’s skills, one of the black-robed elderlies immediately waved a hand and wanted to command the You Ancient Clan members to leave.

At this instant, Ling Yan’s voice sounded from the voice transmission stone again. “Miss Ye, tear the weed out by the roots so that it can never grow again.”

Without Ling Yan’s reminder, Ye Qingtang also understood this logic.Although it was unknown as to why those senior executives of You Ancient Clan had not reached the Yang Lord realm, this was an opportunity not to be missed to Ye Qingtang.

“You wish to leave?” Ye Qingtang’s cold voice was heard.

The moment she spoke, an overbearing Yang Lord aura filled the air instantly and enshrouded the You Ancient Clan figures in it. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

It sealed the entire Shenchao Sect completely and did not give the You Ancient Clan members any chance to escape.

“Who dares to go against the You Ancient Clan!” A black-robed elderly roared furiously.

Ye Qingtang cast a cold look at that black-robed elderly and slashed her sword across without giving him any response.

Sensing the might from the Yang Lord’s strike, everyone was horrified and could not help but retreat backward.

Under Ye Qingtang’s slash, dozens of You Ancient Clan disciples were slaughtered on the spot while a few black-robed elderlies fled in all directions and riskily avoided the blow.
