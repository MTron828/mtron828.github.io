Chapter 546: Blood Moon Holy Lord (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The man’s silver hair swayed in the breeze. The blood-colored crescent on his glabella added an inexplicable devilish charm to his almost perfect face.

His eyes were like an ancient well with still water as he scanned the scene; the corners of his long red robe rustled.

The Blood Moon Division Head, Jiang Chen, Blood Moon Elder, and others were completely stupefied as they stared at the silver-haired man, seeming to have already forgotten to breathe.

Ye Qingtang looked at her cheapskate brother in puzzlement and was surprised by his arrival. Why did he run here at this dangerous time?

Seeing that he did not react, Ye Qingtang could not help but call him again.

“Younger brother?”

“…” Blood Moon Holy Lord stared at her blankly.

As the Blood Moon Holy Lord appeared, the whole world seemed to have fallen into a dead silence, and there was not a single noise.

Li Chenfeng’s brows were slightly furrowed as he looked at the silver-haired male. After taking a close look, he was completely lifeless. It was as though a mountain range crushed his body, and fear eroded every part of him.

“Elder Li?”

Standing in the air silently, Ye You was a little puzzled as she looked at Li Chenfeng.

However, Li Chenfeng’s lips only twitched, and he could not say anything.

The Xuanling Sect masses inspected the silver-haired man behind Ye Qingtang instinctively with strange expressions.

“Who is that fellow…” Confusion was etched all over Qin Huan’s face as he looked at the silver-haired man beside Ye Qingtang.

“I’m not sure… But looking at the crescent on his glabella, he should be someone at the level of a Blood Moon Sect Elder!” Feng Moli looked over as well and took a guess.

“Blood Moon Sect Elder?!”

The remaining Xuanling Sect disciples gasped immediately.

Although an Elder and Division Head had similar positions in Blood Moon Sect, an Elder’s skill was higher than that of a Division Head.

Although a Division Head was the leader in a Blood Moon Division, he would still require to seek the opinion of an Elder when settling important matters. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

With a Blood Moon Elder here, perhaps… it would be enough to reverse the crushing situation that Blood Moon Sect was in!

Currently, the three super sects were attacking Blood Moon Sect from all sides. Although Xuanling Sect was temporarily forgotten by the three super sects, Xuanling Sect did not forget Yunxiao Sect’s purpose for coming here today. Once Blood Moon Sect was defeated, Yunxiao Sect would naturally deal with Xuanling Sect.

Then, it would be the arrival of the calamity.

At this moment, they could no longer care about Blood Moon Sect’s rumors.

“I can’t tell anything from his aura, and I don’t know what state he has reached… However, it seems that he should be someone of the level of a Blood Moon Elder.” After scanning for a moment, Elder Qin told the Xuanling Sect Sect Master and Elder Mo.

There were one hundred and eight Branch Masters and thirty-six Division Heads in Blood Moon Sect, but there were only twenty-four Elders, each possessing remarkable abilities.

No one thought they could still witness a Blood Moon Elder after a thousand years.

Ye Qingtang had a strange expression as she looked at the cheapskate brother before her.

She merely had a teasing mindset when she took him as her younger brother that day.

Moreover, from her memory, her cheapskate brother was an ardent fan of Blood Moon Sect. With Blood Moon Sect appearing here today, it couldn’t be that… he obtained the news… and purposely chased after the Blood Moon Sect all the way here, could it?!

“Who are you!”

Then, a Yunxiao Sect Elder shouted sternly at the silver-haired man.
