“You don’t have the skills, but you still stirred up these troubles. Qiao Mo, if you are a man, you should answer for your own acts and admit your mistakes to the Wind Sword Sect people. Don’t implicate us.” Lu Xiuwen’s brows were tightly furrowed as displeasure filled him.

Qiao Mo hung his head low. He was the most severely injured and was extremely vexed over implicating his fellow senior and junior brothers. After being incited by Lu Xiuwen, Qiao Mo straightened himself with difficulty and said, “Junior Brother Lu is right. I should answer for my own acts. I’ll look for the Wind Sword Sect people right now.”

Seeing that Qiao Mo was about to leave while struggling with all the injuries, the other disciples stopped him immediately.

“What do you mean answering for your own acts! We are all Xuanling Sect disciples and are senior and junior brothers.”

Deep down, everyone was aware that although the conflict was started because of Qiao Mo, the sect’s prestige was at stake right now. If Qiao Mo were to be handed over, what would become of them?

Pieces of trash that betrayed a fellow disciple to ensure their own safety?

Lu Xiuwen’s expression turned colder. He did not intend to waste any time here. An outer sect elder recently thought highly of him, and he learned quite a number of cultivation techniques, which improved his skills greatly. This delay would waste so much time that could have been used to upgrade himself.

“Senior Brother Lu’s words have some reason in them. The number of us is fewer than that of the Wind Sword Sect. If they don’t retreat, god knows how long we will be surrounded here for. It is already past the mission submission deadline. If we return any later, I’m afraid we would all be punished.” Su Wan echoed after Lu Xiuwen. Over this period of time, Su Wan witnessed Lu Xiuwen’s improvement, and she was naturally more hopeful.

Given Lu Xiuwen’s improvements, it seemed that he probably had a chance of becoming an inner sect disciple in the inner sect assessment next year.

As the group was arguing, a few figures suddenly appeared.

“I was still wondering where you all hid. So it is here.” A tall young man who was donned in the Wind Sword Sect’s outer sect uniform walked with large strides towards the group with over ten Wind Sword Sect disciples following behind him.

The appearance of the Wind Sword Sect disciples caused the Xuanling Sect disciples to be on full alert. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“What do you all want to do?” A Xuanling Sect disciple asked in a low tone.

“What do we want to do?” The leader of the Wind Sword Sect disciples scoffed. He scanned the faces of the people from Xuanling Sect, and his eyes eventually fell on Qiao Mo.

“You Xuanling Sect disciples do not have any manners and are actually asking me what I want to do now? He offended a disciple of my sect. Has Xuanling Sect never taught you how to settle this matter?”

Qiao Mo’s expression was a little ugly. He looked at the blustering and truculent Wind Sword Sect people and then looked back at the miserable appearance of his fellow disciples. He clenched his fist silently and took a step forward.

“I was the perpetrator. If you have anything, just come at me.”

The Wind Sword Sect disciple raised a brow at Qiao Mo and cackled instantly.

“You have some sense of responsibility. My requirements are not high.” His eyes sharpened. Suddenly, he lifted the hem of his clothing and stepped on a stump with his left foot. Tapping his thigh, he laughed with an ill intention.

“As long as you crawl between my legs and admit your mistake with three kowtows, this matter can be considered to be over. I’ll bring my people away immediately and allow you all to leave the Floating Light Canyon.”

The expressions of all Xuanling Sect disciples were extremely ugly upon hearing the Wind Sword Sect disciple.

“Scoundrel! You’re going too far!!”
