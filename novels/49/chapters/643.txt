Boom!

With a loud sound, the sword shadow chopped the blood rat’s head off instantly.

The little white tiger ran forward immediately, and in just a few moments, the entire blood rat was eaten up cleanly.

As the blood rat stuck at the cave entrance was eaten, more blood rats and flying ants surged in.

Ye Qingtang did the same thing, and in just half a day, all of the blood rats and flying ants were killed

As for the carcasses, they were naturally consumed by the little white tiger.

“How exactly… did your stomach do it…” The Blood Moon Elder commented as he eyed the little white tiger’s stomach.

A giant rat weighed at least several hundred pounds, but the Fiendcelestial Beast finished one in a mouth… It was truly an eye-opening sight that caused one to gasp in astonishment.

“What does this young lady know? I still can eat another ten times the amount,” the little white tiger said nonchalantly.

Fiendcelestial Beasts like them could turn food into energy. To Fiendcelestial Beasts, the amount and size of food did not matter.

“When can you become like when I first met you?” Ye Qingtang asked as she looked at the little white tiger.

If the little white tiger returned to its initial form, they would definitely be able to move around the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm as they wished.

“Almost.” The little white tiger sat on the ground and told Ye Qingtang. “However, the demonic force I stored is still not a lot… Even if I can return to my previous size, it will not be sustained for long.”

“How long can you hold it for?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“At most ten minutes.” The little white tiger replied. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Ten minutes…” Ye Qingtang said thoughtfully.

To Ye Qingtang, a mere ten minutes was simply not enough.

“However, I can smell that those giant rats and flying ants from earlier on should be influenced by some demonic air. I can smell the exact location of that demonic air. If I can swallow that demonic air… the duration can be extended.” There was a rare look of seriousness on the little white tiger’s face.

“You really have a dog’s nose.” The Blood Moon Elder could not help but say.

“Rubbish,” the little white tiger said proudly. “My nose is better than a dog’s!”

The Blood Moon Elder nodded repeatedly. “Mhm… That’s about what I mean…”

“Lead the way,” Ye Qingtang said.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. There was not much time left, and they had to head to the third floor to find the black-robed person before the Blood Curse Array Formation started.

Very quickly, the little white tiger brought Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder out of the cave.

Currently, there were more and more fierce beasts on the first level, and almost half of the cultivators had died there.

After they died, their bodies turned into blood water and surged into the air.

The energy turbulence… in the third level is getting increasingly stronger…?Ye Qingtang pondered quietly.

Although she did not know what was being raised in the third level, one did not need to think much to know that it was definitely not a good thing.

Already, there was not much time remaining. Ye Qingtang could not help but quicken her footsteps at the thought of that.

There was quite a number of fierce beasts that attacked Ye Qingtang on the road, but they were all slaughtered by Ye Qingtang’s Demonic Blood Sword.

Presently, Ye Qingtang’s martial cultivation was already close to the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, and she naturally did not fear them.

About two days later, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder finally arrived near an icy lake under the little white tiger’s guidance.

This place was a mountain valley that had been sealed by ice long ago, and ahead of them was a frozen island lake.

There was a large black ball above the island lake with black fog lingering around the black ball.
