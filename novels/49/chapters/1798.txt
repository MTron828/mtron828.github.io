Chapter 1799: Right And Wrong (1)

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

All the fiendish demons in the hall breathed a sigh of relief.

The eastern Great General looked very satisfied. “You have done well this time. With this Deity Ocean, the eastern fiendish demons will never need to fear anyone else again. The big three races will be nothing to us. We will become the lords of all fiendish demons after we absorb the power of the Deity Ocean!”

Hu and the rest immediately cheered.

“Qing, give the Deity Ocean to the Great General.” Hu looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang felt very distressed but she maintained a calm face. “Great General, the Deity Ocean is not with me now.”

“What?!” The fiendish demons were shocked.

The smile on the Great General’s face froze, then he frowned. “Didn’t you say that no other fiendish demons managed to snatch the Deity Ocean from you? Why is it not with you now?”

Ye Qingtang was crying on the inside. The Deity Ocean was actually with her, but she could not hand it over. But she really didn’t know what would happen if they knew the Deity Ocean had merged with her.

Exasperated, Ye Qingtang put on a conflicted expression. “When we were in the sealed space and Hu secretly handed the Deity Ocean to me, I knew how important it was to the camp. There were so many fiendish demons surrounding me and I knew my powers were too weak. The other demons would have immediately found out if I kept the Deity Ocean on me. So... I hid the Deity Ocean...”

All the fiendish demons in the hall lapsed into deep thought at Ye Qingtang’s words.

They never suspected anything amiss with Ye Qingtang’s claims. In fact, they found her story very logical. After all, the Deity Ocean was indeed very powerful and countless fiendish demons were desperate to steal it.

Even the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General who was the first to get hold of the Deity Ocean failed to keep it with him. And Ye Qingtang’s own abilities...

The Great General considered Ye Qingtang and felt... it was true she would probably be instantly destroyed if the other demons realized she had the Deity Ocean.

Hu handed the Deity Ocean over to Ye Qingtang as he had no choice then. Ye Qingtang’s explanation sounded very reasonable and plausible.

In fact, they would find it unbelievable if Ye Qingtang managed to bring back the Deity Ocean safe and sound, from under the noses of so many fiendish demons.

“Is the place where you hid the Deity Ocean safe?” the Great General asked.

Ye Qingtang nodded. “It should be very safe. I hid it only after all the surrounding demons scattered off. No one saw me.”

The Great General nodded slightly. “Very good. You must remember the hiding place. Now that the Deity Ocean has gone missing, all the demon camps will be seeking it. It will be rather chaotic during this period. For now we will lay low for a while before going to retrieve the Deity Ocean.”

The Great General spoke steadily. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“But Great General... won’t the sealed space be closed?” Hu asked.

The Great General shook his head. “I thought the sealed space would close like before, but it looks like it has undergone a change after the Deity Ocean descended. Although the opening has become slightly smaller, there are no signs of it closing up.”

Hu felt reassured.

The Great General patted Ye Qingtang on the shoulder. “It must have been hard on you. Go and take a rest now.”

Ye Qingtang heaved a secret sigh of relief. She took her leave and immediately went to look for Little Heavenly Demon and Little White Tiger.
