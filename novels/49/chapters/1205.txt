1206 Blood Battle 8

“Ling Yan… It’s him again?!” You Tong’s eyes sparkled. When they entered this mainland, they were poisoned by Ling Yan. Now, when they were about to exterminate everything on this land, Ling Yan kidnapped the five noble descendants of the higher-ups of the Ancient You Clan? And even the Clan Master’s beloved princess?!

“But… As long as we can find the reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode and use that power to absorb all the lives on this mainland, we will be able to maximize its power… That can allow the Ancient You Clan to have another great leap…” You Ton was not reconciled to retreat.

“How dare you! The Clan Master has given the order. We need to retreat within three days. I’ll go and look for the reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode and bring her out of the mainland. After rescuing our three princesses and two noble heirs, we can use the Spiritual Abode’s reincarnation power and absorb all the lives on this land!” The illusory voice shouted coldly.

“Yes…” You Tong nodded after a while. He could not do anything besides following the order.

“Don’t stay there anymore. Go back to the headquarters now. I’m in the South now, and I’ll go look for the reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode.” The black eye disappeared.

“Ling Yan… You’re really… seeking your own death…” You Tong sneered.

You Tong’s sight landed on Ye Qingtang. Since he was about to return to the Central Mainland, he should kill the leader of the Heaven City to mark the end of the Southern war.

You Tong raised his sword and slashed towards Ye Qingtang’s neck.

Every member of the Ye Family shouted in rage.

However, before the sword landed, a blood-red figure suddenly appeared.

A crisp ringing sound was heard. A man stood in front of Ye Qingtang expressionlessly. He used two of his fingers and held You Tong’s sword.

“Oh… there’s another powerful person…” You Tong looked at the man in the blood-red robe and scorned.

However, before he could finish his words, the man in the blood-red robe punched him.

The punch was so fast that it was invisible to the naked eye.

There was a huge “boom”, and You Tong’s body was thrown out like a kite with a broken string.

“Ow…” Blood spurted out of You Tong’s mouth, and he had a shocked expression.

The abilities of the man in the blood-red robe… were so terrifying…

You Tong returned after a while. He remained floating in the air and sized up the man from mid-air. “Who are you?”

“Come down.”

The Blood Moon Holy Lord raised his right arm. Before knowing what was going on, You Tong’s body was pulled by an invisible hand. He could not maintain his balance anymore and fell hard onto the ground.

However, some blood flew out of the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s mouth.

“This body… cannot make it anymore…” The Blood Moon Holy Lord contemplated.

This body was heavily injured after fighting against the Demon God’s body. If he could rest for a few months, he could recover. However, if he still tried to forcefully use the power in his body, the body might break into pieces.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord did not even bother to look at You Tong. He turned and looked towards Ye Qingtang.

There were some feelings that appeared in his cold eyes suddenly.

He knew that it would be the best ending if Ye Qingtang died here after the land was conquered…
