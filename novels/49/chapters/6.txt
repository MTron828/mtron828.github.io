Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Uncle Ye, you’re also the master of your family clan. Is there anything wrong with what I just said?”

Duan Tianrao finally removed the entirety of his disguise. He knew long ago from Ye Xun that the Great Elder was the one with power and that Ye Ling was only the master of the family clan only in name.

“You…” Ye Ling trembled with rage.

Ye Xun who was standing aside stepped forward. A slight smile appeared on her face, but she quickly disguised it with an expression full of concern.

“Father, please do not be angry.”

“Do not be angry? How can I not be angry?” Ye Ling questioned. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Xun looked at the tall and strong Duan Tianrao gently and said, “Young Master Duan has his own reasons. As the next family master, he needs to care for the prestige of the family. Father, I hope you will understand. Tang Tang is still young. She will be able to find a good husband in the future.”

“What did you just say?” Ye Ling stared at her adopted daughter unbelievably. He could not believe that she would speak up for Duan Tianrao.

Ye Xun stared at the furious Ye Ling and then looked towards Ye Qingtang, who had not spoken at all. She took out the Hunyuan Pills that Duan Tianrao gave her and handed them over to Ye Qingtang.

“Tang Tang, Young Master Duan cares for you. He even brought the Hunyuan Pills to help you recover,” Ye Xun said as coldness sparkled in her eyes.

She was very sure that Ye Qingtang loved Duan Tianrao and that she definitely would not agree to the annulment. Ye Qingtang would not accept the Hunyuan Pills. She might even beg Duan Tianrao to keep the engagement.

Eventually, the Hunyuan Pills would return to Ye Xun’s hands.

Even though Ye Xun held such beliefs, she still pretended to persuade Ye Qintang sweetly.

Ye Qingtang stared at Ye Xun coldly, watching her fake concern. She smiled coldly in her heart.

Ye Qingtang saw through Ye Xun’s actions and could read her thoughts. In her previous life, Ye Qingtang was exactly the type of person Ye Xun thought she was. When she knew that Duan Tianrao wanted to annul the engagement, not only did she reject the tonics and Hunyuan Pills that Duan Tianrao gave her, but she also begged him not to abandon her, throwing away her dignity and pride.

She did not care about the prestige of Ye family and Ye Ling, and she had placed herself in an inferior position. Ye Ling even vomited blood as he was too furious.

However, this time…

Suddenly, a smile appeared on Ye Qingtang’s lips. Just as Ye Xun was feeling very confident of her analysis, Ye Qingtang extended her arm and took over the Hunyuan Pills.

“Then I will thank Young Master Duan for his kindness.” She then placed the Hunyuan Pills into her own space ring, a dimensional storage item.

The whole process happened smoothly.

While Ye Ling was still enraged, Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke up for the first time.

“Father, I think Young Master Duan has a point as well.”

The three people in the hall were all taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words.

Duan Tianrao stared at Ye Qingtang in surprise. He thought that the moment he asked to annul the engagement, Ye Qingtang definitely would be crying and begging. He did not expect that she would say such words.

Ye Ling was also dumbfounded. He looked at his daughter with great concern as he was scared that she was too upset by the news.

“Tang Tang, what… what did you say?”

Ye Qingtang sat on the chair and stared at the three astonished people.

She said slowly, “As a girl, of course I understand it is embarrassing for my engagement to be annulled. However, since Young Master Duan is the heir of the family master, it’s understandable that he needs to focus on the prestige of his family. I am not suitable to be the mistress of the Duan family.”
