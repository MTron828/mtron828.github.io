1574 Cultivation 2

Ye Qingtang originally planned to tell Elder Qian that the Domain Monarch Founder had already taught her four sets of techniques. However, she stopped herself when she considered the difficulties she faced when practicing the finger technique.

The Domain Monarch Founder was not in the valley right now, and she could not ask him about anything she did not understand.

Now that Elder Qian was going to reteach her, she could watch carefully and ensure that there were no errors in her cultivation in the future.

Curiosity, diligence, and humility—Ye Qingtang understood their importance and genuinely wanted to ask for guidance.

Elder Qian saw Ye Qingtang’s positive attitude and was satisfied.

Even if she could not become a top powerful figure, she could not ruin the Jiang Family’s reputation at the very least, and her future was dependent on her luck.

Elder Qian immediately performed the finger technique before Ye Qingtang’s eyes immediately.

While Elder Qian’s finger technique was powerful, it was still quite lacking when compared to the Domain Monarch Founder’s. However, he did his best as he was extremely patient and told Ye Qingtang about all the important points.

Ye Qingtang looked very closely. Comparing how she practiced in the past two days and Elder Qian’s finger technique, she faintly felt the difference and was grateful on the inside.

Elder Qian was rather pleased with Ye Qingtang’s serious attitude toward learning. Although he was aware of Ye Qingtang’s mediocre talent, he guided her attentively on the account that she was studious and serious.

Elder Qian guided Ye Qingtang repeatedly for the entire afternoon and corrected some of her mistakes, which benefited her understanding greatly.

“Practice well when you’re back. I will teach you other things after some time,” Elder Qian said slowly. There were many youths in the valley, and he himself had quite a number of disciples as well. Thus, he had no time to monitor Ye Qingtang’s cultivation all the time.

Given Ye Qingtang’s talent, she probably needed at least one month to be familiar with and master this finger technique.

It would be alright if she could practice diligently, but if she slacked off, nothing could help her anymore.

Ye Qingtang nodded and thanked Elder Qian sincerely. Although she could feel that Elder Qian did not value her much, he was impartial and did what he could, which she was extremely grateful for.

As Elder Qian watched Ye Qingtang leave the room, he could not help but shake his head and sigh.

“What a pity...”

Elder Qian was very satisfied with Ye Qingtang’s eagerness to learn, but if her talent could be a little greater... Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Sigh...

Elder Qian did not think too much either, and these thoughts were diverted away when other youths came to seek guidance. After all, the Jiang Family still had to prioritize the training of top talents.

As for Ye Qingtang, her outcome was dependent on her luck.

After gaining Elder Qian’s guidance, Ye Qingtang had a sudden flash of insight and was already very familiar with the finger technique in just two days.

Afterward, Ye Qingtang went through the palm technique, movement technique, and swordplay technique individually to familiarize herself. Perhaps because of Elder Qian’s attentive guidance where he pointed out the main points of the Jiang Family’s techniques, Ye Qingtang understood many key aspects of those three techniques without any extra guidance from Elder Qian and could learn them smoothly and easily.

Ye Qingtang almost never left her room for a whole month. Apart from stepping out to have a meal every two or three days, the remaining time was all spent in the room cultivating. She either familiarized herself with the four techniques or cultivated through meditation; she truly wasted no time.

Exactly because of such diligence, Ye Qingtang was skilled in all these four techniques in just a month.

Furthermore, Ye Qingtang also obtained a huge advancement in her skills through this high-intensity cultivation.
