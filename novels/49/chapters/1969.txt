Chapter 1970: Spy (2)

Before entering the Land of Infinite Demons, You Qiong had met with the Holy Lord of Shadows a few times as an Elder of the Ancient You Clan. Now that the Ancient You Clan was committing all sorts of heinous deeds on the mainland, he was afraid that his identity was going to be revealed.

It would mean certain death for him.

Ye Qingtang only laughed without saying anything and singled him out.

The Jiang family had no clue about his true identity and only knew that he was Jiang Yu’s friend. They weren’t surprised that Ye Qingtang seemed to recognize him. But he started panicking as Ye Qingtang pulled him out.

“Please have mercy on me, Holy Lord of Shadows! The actions of the Ancient You Clan have nothing to do with me. I’ve already abandoned the dark ways.” You Qiong spilled everything as he realized while looking at the Holy Lord of Shadows that she seemed to have recognized him.

Ye Qingtang found this extremely amusing but maintained her cold expression, which made You Qiong panic even more.

“You’ve already abandoned the dark ways?” Ye Qingtang repeated his words as she raised an eyebrow.

You Qiong quickly nodded.

“You, an Elder of the Ancient You Clan, have hidden yourself within the Jiang family. Are you sure you don’t have ulterior motives?” Ye Qingtang asked.

You Qiong wanted to cry.

How would he dare have ulterior motives?

“To tell the truth, as I’m sure the Holy Lord can tell, I’m not looking like this because I want to. I’m under the age reversal curse. I’m sure the Holy Lord knows of the effects of the age reversal curse as well as how the Ancient You Clan is. I won’t be treated well if I go back in my current state. The Jiang family has saved me as well and I’ve long abandoned the dark ways and the Ancient You Clan. Why else would I not divulge the location of the Domain Monarch and everyone else to the Ancient You Clan?” You Qiong did seem to not have any ulterior motives and spilled everything.

It was only then that Ye Qingtang finally let him off the hook.

You Qiong sighed silently with relief.

But Ye Qingtang wasn’t actually letting him off this easily. She had no choice but to deal with him in the past but he could be of some use right now.

“Since you said that you’ve abandoned the dark ways, I want to see how sincere you are.” She lifted her hand and clamped it over his shoulders as she silently activated the Deity Ocean within her.

Pain coursed through the entirety of his body as she activated her energy.

The Holy Lord of Shadows wanted to kill him?

Just as he was panicking, he suddenly realized that his body had elongated. His body which had belonged to a toddler had suddenly grown into a young boy of about thirteen.

This made him freeze.

Ye Qingtang froze as well as she saw this.

All she had wanted to try using the power of the Deity Ocean to dissolve the curse in his body. She hadn’t expected it to work.

“Holy Lord?” You Qiong looked in shock at Ye Qingtang, not knowing whether she wanted to kill him or save him.

She composed herself and said lightly, “Return to the Ancient You Clan if you’ve really given up your dark ways.”

“What?” Somehow, her words made You Qiong even more terrified. Why did he have to return if he had already abandoned the dark ways?

“I can help you get rid of the age reversal curse. You’re an Elder of the Ancient You Clan who has been missing for ten thousand years. It’s normal if you return now,” Ye Qingtang said lightly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

You Qiong’s head was spinning as he suddenly understood what she was saying.

She wanted him to return to the Ancient You Clan as a spy.
