Chapter 1978: Crimson League (2)

After flying for a couple of hundred meters, Ye Qingtang finally spotted a place where she could land.

There were countless figures hidden inside the Frost Abyss.

Ye Qingtang saw many alien races. The figures gathered together in the abyss that was cut off from the world. Although there were many alien races around, there was one particular race that Ye Qingtang hadn’t seen before.

It was a little white furry ball, around the size of a human’s head. It was covered in white fur and looked just like little snowballs. They jumped around with those claws hidden underneath its fur. They were simply adorable.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but smile when she saw the little white balls jump around.

“Holy Lord, the ambassador of the Crimson League is over there.” The Goblin Tribe leader pointed over at a cave in the Frost Abyss. There were all types of strange-looking weapons placed outside the cave, with a few little white balls standing outside the cave, communicating with the alien races with a special language.

Ye Qingtang and the two tribe leaders walked over in their direction.

The Goblin Tribe leader bowed, whispering in the ear of a little white ball that was slightly bigger in size. The little white ball hesitated for a bit before jumping into the cave. After a while, it jumped out and nodded at the Goblin Tribe leader.

The Goblin Tribe leader then took Ye Qingtang with him into the cave.

The cave was filled with ice lamps that were carved from crystals. They were glistening and very beautiful. One little white ball led the way in front while Ye Qingtang followed behind and her eyes scanned through the ice lamps.

The ice lamps were unique, some were carved with beautiful totems and others were carved according to the respective shapes of the alien races. They were hung around the cave, lighting the dark cave up.

They walked for quite some distance and deep inside the cave, there was an ice door. They could somehow see some figures walking around behind that door, but it felt surreal.

It was then that the little white ball stopped outside the door.

Just as the Goblin Tribe leader was about to knock on the door, the ice door just opened up automatically.

“Holy Lord, we only heard that the ambassador is here, but we haven’t actually verified it ourselves...” the Goblin Tribe leader whispered in Ye Qingtang’s ear.

Ye Qingtang looked over at the ajar door.

A white figure appeared before them. When Ye Qingtang saw the figure, she was somewhat bewildered.

It was a Fox Demon. It had a build that was similar to a grown man, walking on two back legs, a slender figure and its entire body covered with white fur. There was a mark on its glabella, it seemed like three fire flames.

The Fox Demon’s eyes crinkled into a smile when it saw Ye Qingtang and the rest, the corners of its lips kicking up into a polite smile.

“Anything I can help you with?” The Fox Demon sounded polite as it asked. It had a pleasant voice and no one could bring themselves to dislike it.

When the Demon Tribe leader saw the Fox Demon, he stepped forward and asked, “You’re the ambassador of the Crimson League?”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
