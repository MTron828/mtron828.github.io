Chapter 1590 White Magician 4

The Vatican palace was situated in the corner of a town.Ye Qingtang learned from the Bishop of York that the town that she was in now was a small town of the Supreme League Kingdom, and most of the fit young men were sent to the frontline by the Supreme League Kingdom.

Previously, those muscular men she met in the bar were also going to head to the frontline a few days later.

Gradually, Ye Qingtang learned more clues about this world from their conversation.

From the source of magic to the epoch of magic, the disaster and the war between the black witches and white magicians... as well as the war that was happening on this mainland right now.

This war involved every country on this mainland regardless of their size, and no one was fortunate enough to escape it. As the kingdom that first incited the war, the Supreme League Kingdom arose the dissatisfaction of other countries, and thus the war expanded to an unimaginable scale.

Ye Qingtang listened to the Bishop of York silently. Although he did not say it clearly, he secretly sounded her out if she was from the Supreme League Kingdom. After Ye Qingtang gave him a definite answer, he evidently heaved a sigh of relief and continuously lamented about the dangerous situation that the Supreme League Kingdom was currently facing.

Ye Qingtang knew what the Bishop of York meant from his tearful complaints.

His goal coincided with hers.

“It is truly regretful for the Supreme League Kingdom to face such a situation.” Ye Qingtang sighed.

“The Emperor initially only wanted to get rid of those avaricious people from the Luo Kingdom and did not expect things to develop to this state. Everyone on this mainland was deceived by the people of the Luo Kingdom! We will be destroyed sooner or later! The people of the Luo Kingdom are the remaining evildoers left behind by the devil on this mainland. They’re the best at using flowery speech to bewitch people!”

The Supreme League Kingdom’s initial war was over a small country named the Luo Kingdom, which was stuck between various large and powerful kingdoms.

The size of Luo Kingdom’s territory was pitifully small and was less than the size of a province in the Supreme League Kingdom.

“Lord white magician, please help the Emperor. He has become a supposed devil to all the other kingdoms, but only we know the reason behind his actions. Without the Emperor, the citizens of the Supreme League Kingdom would probably die from starvation,” the Bishop of York said anxiously.

“I am willing to do so if it can save the citizens of the Supreme League Kingdom from disaster.” Ye Qingtang concurred with the Bishop of York.

The Bishop of York’s eyes shone, and he expressed his gratitude to Ye Qingtang. He immediately ordered people to arrange a room for Ye Qingtang before hurrying off to contact his superior so as to personally bring this precious white magician to the Emperor and gain glory for himself.

The Bishop of York did want to help the kingdom, but this did not obstruct him from gaining benefits either.

If he could personally send a powerful white magician to the Supreme League Kingdom’s Emperor, he would definitely rise in ranks in the Vatican! And he no longer needed to be stuck in this remote little town!

As Ye Qingtang looked at the busy Bishop of York, her knowledge regarding this two-star constellation world deepened again.

It had to be said that this world was greatly different from her original world. However, it was great that she already knew what the mission was and how to proceed with it.

Ye Qingtang returned to the room that the Bishop of York prepared for her, calmed her heart down, and meditated on the ground cross-legged as she waited for good news from the Bishop of York.
