Chapter 1931: Battle My Steed First (1)

The effeminate-looking youth didn’t look remotely worried as the Demon Tribe Leader rushed at him. He lifted his arm and shot a beam of cold light at the elder leader.

The Demon Tribe Leader panicked, not expecting the weak youth in front of him to attack with so much power. He had no time to react at all as the beam of light shot towards him.

Just as the light was about to hit him, a small hand pushed the Demon Tribe Leader to the side and he managed to escape the fatal attack.

“Ming Wang?” The Demon Tribe Leader looked at Ming Wang in surprise.

Ming Wang looked solemnly at the effeminate youth who had once humiliated him.

“Another loser. I’ve already said that I’m not interested in wasting my time on you. Holy Lord of Shadows, if you insist on not attacking, I’m going to kill off every single person from the Undead Clan.” The effeminate-looking youth didn’t even give the Demon Tribe Leader and Ming Wang a second glance, instead focusing all his attention on Ye Qingtang.

“You’re no match for him,” Ming Wang told the Demon Tribe Leader.

The Demon Tribe Leader wanted to retort but fear still lingered in his heart at the thought of that young man’s attack.

“He should consider himself lucky. If my powers aren’t suppressed because I’m in the Central Mainland right now, there would be no place for his arrogance,” the Demon Tribe Leader said through clenched teeth. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

But he had to admit that his current strength was no match for this youth.

“Holy Lord, look at how arrogant this boy is. We implore the Holy Lord to not show mercy and end him.” Seeing the effeminate-looking youth act so presumptuously in front of Ye Qingtang, the Ancient Clan took this opportunity to fan the flames.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

This bunch of old foxes.

The effeminate-looking youth’s lips twisted as he looked at the Ancient Clans hiding behind the Holy Lord of Shadows.

“I was wondering how the Ancient Clans in the Central Mainland had all vanished just like that. To think that you all ran here to hide like the rats you are. Did you think that you would be safe if you hid behind the Holy Lord of Shadows? What a joke. You’ll all be next after I deal with the Holy Lord of Shadows.”

“You d*mned brat, you’re not worthy to be compared with the Holy Lord!” Empowered by Ye Qingtang’s presence and angered by the effeminate-looking youth’s words, the Ancient Clans all shouted back at him.

“With your ability, you’re not even qualified to carry the Holy Lord’s shoes.”

Emboldened, the Ancient Clans continued scolding the youth.

The effeminate-looking youth’s expression was darkening as well. A hurricane suddenly rose from his feet, sweeping up the ground all around him as his eyes changed color.

“Are you all done? You bunch of trash, I’ll make sure that none of you leave with your lives. I don’t have time to deal with you now. Holy Lord of Shadows, do you dare to fight me?”

Ye Qingtang looked expressionlessly at the angered youth. Meanwhile, the surrounding Ancient Clans and the eight tribe leaders all turned to look at Ye Qingtang.

Still she remained silent.

They were running their mouths so freely just now. To think there was not a peep from them now?

Lifting her eyes lightly, Ye Qingtang looked at the effeminate-looking youth and said, “You’re not qualified enough for me to make a move.”

Her dismissive words made him stiffen as his expression darkened further.

“Are you sure you’re not just scared? I see that the Holy Lord of Shadows is just a coward.”

“I would only dirty my hands if I were to fight a person who ran from a battle.”
