Chapter 2556: Dragon Emperor Clan (16)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After a few breaths, Ye Qingtang took out a jade pendant from her space ring and carefully kept it with her.

This jade pendant was left behind by her mother, Di Jiuyuan. It was an item that could prove her identity. When she came to the Second Domain, Ye Qingtang took off the jade pendant from her body and placed it in her space ring.

In this current situation, it was best for her to carry the jade pendant on her body. Should anything happen to them, the jade pendant would be able to protect their lives.

Of course, Ye Qingtang would only reveal this jade pendant when she was forced to. Otherwise, she absolutely would not take it out for any old reason.

The situation in the Dragon Emperor Clan was too complicated. Ye Qingtang currently did not know much about the clan. This jade pendant might be able to help her regain her position or it might consign her to eternal damnation. At the very least, Ye Qingtang needed to know who she could trust in the Dragon Emperor Clan and who she could not. Did her mother have any enemies?

If she revealed the jade pendant without even properly investigating such basic information, the consequences would be unimaginable. Not only that but the identities of her mother’s other two children must also be investigated. Whether they were real or fake.

“Little girl, don’t worry. You have me,” the big yellow dog told Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was about to say something when the dog added, “Don’t worry. Before you fulfill my wish, I won’t let you die so easily. Tell me, if you die, who will fulfill my wish?”

Ye Qingtang was speechless. She had been momentarily touched and that moment would be an eternal humiliation to her.

“The demonic aura here is very compatible with your own demon physique. You can try to absorb it and turn it into your own power.” Ye Qingtang said patiently to the Blood Moon Elder. “Don’t just eat.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Holy Lady, my demon physique?” The Blood Moon Elder put down his chopsticks in confusion.

“Your new body was used by General Yongle before, so you have an intense demonic aura too. He used a special method to seal that demonic aura in your body,” Ye Qingtang explained.

“I understand… I knew that this new body was extraordinary. So that’s how it is… Holy Lady, you are really too good to me.” The Blood Moon Elder stared at Ye Qingtang and sighed.

“After you’re done resting, you can try using the power of demons to absorb the demonic energy here. Also, don’t move around on your own here. This is to avoid getting into trouble.” With that, Ye Qingtang grabbed the big yellow dog and left.

During this period of time, she had nothing to do but could not leave the guest area. There was also no opportunity to investigate the information she wanted to know. She might as well spend more time cultivating.

After returning to her guest room, Ye Qingtang sat down and composed herself before entering a meditative state.

Over the recent few days, Ye Qingtang’s martial arts level showed signs of breaking through. There should not be any problems for her to advance from the Fifth Heaven level Divine Lord to the Sixth.

“Little girl, if you can absorb the power of the Heavenly Dao in your heart, your strength will surge. By then, it will be possible to shake the natural laws of the lower realm.” The big yellow dog, which had been silent the entire time, suddenly spoke up.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes snapped open.
