“Ha….”

Ning Luo showed an evil smile and said, “Senior Brother Zhuo, Senior Sister Yue, you worried too much. Senior Sister Ye You asked me to finish Ye Qingtang, but you wanted to step in. It should not work this way. Furthermore, Ye Qingtang caused me great injuries. I would definitely not let her go so easily. I will be the one to end her life.”

After hearing Ning Luo’s explanation, Senior Sister Yue’s eyes were full of suspicion.

Senior Brother Zhuo gave an ambiguous smile. “Junior Brother Ning Luo, based on your second level of Paragon Skill, you did not use your full strength just now. It was obvious to me. Is it that… you are obsessed with Ye Qingtang’s appearance and fell in love with her… I shall warn you first. Junior Sister Ye You wants her dead. You should keep your little thoughts in case you provoke Junior Sister Ye You. No one will be able to save you then.”

“Senior Brother Zhuo, don’t bother to talk to him. Ning Luo’s beloved one had passed away three years ago. He will never be interested in another person. I don’t care what he was thinking, but now, we should chop off the woman’s head and bring it back to Ye You. Then, it would be mission complete,” Senior Sister Yue said.

“Okay.” Senior Brother Zhuo nodded.

The two people’s aura of Martial Qi Level Three exploded in the surroundings. Ye Qingtang was engulfed by the wind and the waves created instantly.

Ye Qingtang could only defend herself using her primordial qi.

“These two people’s abilities are even higher than Ning Luo… Even if my primordial qi is sufficient, I may only be able to come to a draw with one of them…” Ye Qingtang frowned.

Ye Qingtang rolled her eyes and looked towards her space ring.

A talisman appeared in her hand at the next second.

The talismans were the treasures that the Yunxiao Sect Master gave to Yue Tiancheng. They sealed powerful array formations and divine skills.

With the talisman in her hand, Ye Qingtang was confident that even if she could not fight off the two people, she could still run away.

“Such a pity… I wish I can keep all these precious talismans… One will be gone now…” Ye Qingtang stared at the talisman and felt heart-broken.

When Ye Qingtang was about to use the talisman, Ning Luo suddenly said, “Senior Brother Zhuo, Senior Sister Yue, there’s a Xuanling Sect elder approaching. I think it’s best to handle him first.”

Laughter filled his eyes.

The two people then looked up and saw an elder walked over slowly.

There was an elder about eighty years old taking slow steps over. He said, “Young people should care for each other and be peaceful. Don’t always try to fight and kill each other.”

“Venerable Wu?” Ye Qingtang sized up the elder and realized that he was the Venerable Wu from the Sword Spirit Workshop. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

As an elder who always stayed at the Sword Spirit Workshop for weapon refining, why would he come here…

Ye Qingtang felt a headache. Even she herself also decided to escape… now there was one more person to take care of…

“Another one comes here for death.” Senior Sister Yue snorted.

“Old man, look at your age. You’re committing suicide here.” Senior Brother Zhuo laughed at the elder.

Venerable Wu walked beside Ye Qingtang and smiled. “Young people nowadays… always need old men to take care of…”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared at him blankly. “I did not ask you to look after me okay… It is much easier for me to escape along…”

“Old man, I don’t want to have your blood on my hand since you are so old. If you understand the situation, leave now.” The smile on Senior Brother Zhuo’s face still remained.

“Where are your manners, son… Did your parents did not teach you basic manners?” Venerable Wu sighed.
