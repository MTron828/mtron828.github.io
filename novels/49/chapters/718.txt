Chapter 719: Falling Sky Valley (3)

Since he was a disciple from a big family clan, his foundation should be pretty good.

Ye Qingtang looked at Xiong Feng’s blissful expression, and her smile deepened.

Indeed, Xiong Feng’s character was exactly the same as in her previous life. As long as he was fed fully, it was much more convenient for him to do things.

Ye Qingtang immediately said, “Thank you, Warden Xiong. May I trouble you to refer me to the Valley Master please?”

“What?” Xiong Feng was excited over the two treasures at hand but could not help but be shaken when he heard Ye Qingtang.

“You want to meet the Valley Master? Why?”

Ye Qingtang said, “Truth to be told, I’ve long heard about the current acting Valley Master of Falling Sky Valley, Perfected Xuanchen, and have looked up to him for a long time. If I can become Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple, it will be my honor.”

This time, Xiong Feng could not smile anymore.

“Little brother, this is a little hard already. Our Valley Master has not accepted a disciple for many years. Even if you look up to him, I’m afraid it will be difficult for you to get what you want.”

Xiong Feng originally thought that Ye Qingtang merely wanted to enter Falling Sky Valley as soon as possible; thus, he agreed to her request. Given Ye Qingtang’s situation, there should not be any problem in gaining an Elder’s approval and be permitted to enter the valley.

Yet, unexpectedly…

The person she wanted as her Master was actually their acting Valley Master, Perfected Xuanchen!

Ever since their old Valley Master was heavily injured and was recuperating, Perfected Xuanchen became their acting Valley Master, and his position in Falling Sky Valley was naturally different from before. Moreover, he had not accepted a disciple for many years, and many geniuses who wanted to become Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple were all rejected.

“Little brother, it’s best if you don’t think about that. It’s alright as long as you enter Falling Sky Valley, but as for our Valley Master… you can forget about it.” Xiong Feng accepted many things from Ye Qingtang and could only persuade her instead of being too tough.

However, Ye Qingtang had made up her mind long ago. The purpose of coming to Falling Sky Valley was to become a disciple under Perfected Xuanchen.

She did not say anything and retrieved an armor from her space ring straightforwardly.

Once that armor was taken out, Xiong Feng was giddy by the sight.

It was a dark green armor with golden fine lines all over the armor which sparkled under the sunlight, extremely eye-catching.

Xiong Feng could not notice anything else at that moment as he was in a daze by the shining armor.

“Golden Moon… Armor…” Xiong Feng naturally heard of the name of this armor before. If the Scorching Sun Gloves was a valuable treasure, this Golden Moon Armor could only be described as rare.

“Do you like this Golden Moon Armor, Warden Xiong?” Ye Qingtang said with a smile as she watched Xiong Feng’s reaction in satisfaction.

“Yes… Of course I like it…” Xiong Feng nodded repeatedly and was only short of gluing his eyes on that armor.

“If you can refer me to the Valley Master, regardless of whether the Valley Master is willing to accept me as a disciple, this Golden Moon Armor can be considered as a fee for your hard work,” Ye Qingtang said generously.

Xiong Feng was about to tear up from the agitation. He had only seen this Golden Moon Armor in paintings and had never thought that he could lay his hands on it.

It was only possible for such a treasure to be possessed by someone at an Elder level, and a warden like him did not even have to think about it.

What exactly is this fellow’s background?

First the Luyuan Pill.

Then the Scorching Sun Gloves.

And now, even the Golden Moon Armor is out?!

Could she be Ouyang Family Clan Master’s illegitimate child?DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com
