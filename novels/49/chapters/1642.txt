Chapter 1643: Forced To Concede (2)

Elder Qian’s emotions were in turmoil as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who was standing before him. He had not expected Ye Qingtang to be one of the top twenty.

Although the rules could not be changed, a lucky dark horse like Ye Qingtang was unexpected.

During this period, Elder Qian had given Ye Qingtang a few pointers, but had not paid her much attention. He only knew that she seldom left her room so she must be diligently cultivating.

Elder Qian could not help but sigh softly at this thought.

If Ye Qingtang had not been lost and had started cultivating since she was young, this extra time coupled with her diligence would have ensured that her mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline would not go to waste.

But as it was, it was too late.

“We will soon be heading for the Island of Immortal Footsteps. The Martial Arts Championship will be held on the island. You’ve only just arrived in Taiyuan Valley and are not yet familiar with the various Jiang Family martial skills. In the next few days, you must work hard and practice these cultivation techniques,” Elder Qian said with a soft sigh. They had no choice but to make a frantic, last-minute effort.

The top youths of all the major clans would be participating in the Martial Arts Championship. Even talents like Jiang Yanyun might not win. Right now, Elder Qian could only pray that Ye Qingtang would not lose too badly in the Martial Arts Championship and ruin the Jiang Family’s reputation.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied.

Elder Qian had always been pleased with Ye Qingtang’s conscientious attitude. At the moment, the more profound cultivation techniques were not suitable for Ye Qingtang. Instead, he carefully taught Ye Qingtang the Jiang Family movement technique. He told her to study it carefully and practice hard for the next few days. She could not defeat her opponents with her powers, but at least she would not lose too badly in the arena.

Elder Qian meant well. If the Domain Monarch Founder were in the valley, he would not need to worry about Ye Qingtang, but now that the Domain Monarch Founder had left, he would have to take care of Ye Qingtang.

Elder Qian taught her in detail, and Ye Qingtang studied diligently. Of the Jiang Family techniques, she was best at the finger technique. She was not very familiar with palm technique, sword technique, and movement technique. So she seized the opportunity and did not dare to slack off at all.

Her goal was to participate in the Martial Arts Championship and place high enough to enter the mystic realm to look for clues about her mother. That was what Ye Qingtang really needed.

For fully half a day, Elder Qian pointed out the flaws in Ye Qingtang’s movement technique. Ye Qingtang learned quickly and swiftly grasped the areas she had previously overlooked. Elder Qian was pleased with her progress. He thought that with Ye Qingtang’s bloodline and ability to quickly grasp onto new techniques, it was a pity that she had been lost and wasted her opportunity.

Ye Qingtang only left Elder Qian when night fell.

On her way back. Ye Qingtang met many youths who frowned and looked disdainful when they saw her.

“Is she fit to participate in the Martial Arts Championship?”

“I wonder if someone fiddled with the lots. The Elders may say that they were fair, but she was brought here by the Domain Monarch Founder.” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Elder Qian is right. Luck is part of skill. A pity that we aren’t as lucky as someone to be favored by the Domain Monarch Founder. Ah...”

A few youths did not hide their contempt for Ye Qingtang. They felt that if Ye Qingtang had not been lucky enough to make the ranking, they might have had a chance to be one of the top twenty.
