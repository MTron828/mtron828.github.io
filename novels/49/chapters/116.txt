Chapter 117: With All of One’s Fist (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang was the only candidate who solved the illusion array and was obviously ranked first in the first segment of the assessment.

As for the sword array, although there was a sudden abnormality, Ye Qingtang was very clear that it was enough to suppress everyone just based on the fact that she withstood the first wave of attack

Thus…

As long as she was not ranked the last few in the third segment of the assessment, she was confident that she would be able to enter Xuanling Sect.

“Miss Ye, there is no need to argue with him,” Yun Shu comforted Ye Qingtang.

Lu Xiuwen had been arrogant for a long period of time and was also a prince; hence, he would not allow anyone to disobey him. While there was nothing to pick on about Ye Qingtang’s words before she stepped on the Path to Heaven, it had already planted the seeds of dissatisfaction in Lu Xiuwen’s heart.

All of this fell into Yun Shu’s eyes, and his opinion of Lu Xiuwen became worse.

“I know,” Ye Qingtang chuckled as her eyes could not help but land on Yun Shu.

Previously, she was only focused on her own assessment and, in turn, neglected something. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

In the previous two segments, Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen’s assessment results were about the same and were considered to be outstanding. With such top-notch performances, their natural talents should be around the same.

However…

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

In her previous life when Ye Qingtang entered Xuanling Sect, Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen had long entered Xuanling Sect for many years.

But then, Lu Xiuwen had become the best disciple in the outer sect and was only one step away from becoming an inner sect disciple. Everyone in the outer sect all the more followed his lead and was very respectful towards him. Rather, it was Yun Shu, who had a similar level of natural talent, that seemed miserable.

Although the Yun Shu then was still skilled, it was far from his stunning performance today.

Being in the outer sect seemed a little commonplace.

If one were to say that Yun Shu could not win a spar against Lu Xiuwen, Ye Qingtang would definitely not believe it.

Many thoughts ran across Ye Qingtang’s mind. She had a feeling that something must have happened after Yun Shu entered Xuanling Sect. Otherwise, he would not have fallen to that ordinary state as in the previous lifetime.

However…

The Yun Shu in the previous life had never mentioned any related incident even until death, and Ye Qingtang did not know anything about it now. She could only bury all the confusion in her heart temporarily and start observing after entering Xuanling Sect.

Just when Ye Qingtang was thinking about it, the third segment of the assessment had already started.

The middle-aged man announced the contents of the third segment in front of everyone.

All candidates will come forward one by one and hit the black stone slate hung on the stone pillar with their fists. The results of the assessment would be decided by the degree of damage done to the stone slate.

Candidates, who had been afraid for a long time, heaved a heavy sigh of relief at the third segment of the assessment.

After going through the unpredictable illusion array as well as the dangerous sword array, the third segment unexpectedly looked very easy.

At least…

They did not need to be worried about being frightened anymore.

The previous two segments had already drained the strength of all candidates. If they were to go through any intense assessments now, there would most likely be no prideful results.

It was just hitting a stone slate, how hard could it be?

The first candidate went up the array without any burden from before. Gathering all his strength, he let out a loud roar and heavily punched at the dark, black stone slate!

A loud boom was heard as all his strength was put in the punch on the stone slate.

However, a shocking scene appeared!

This hit with all his might only made a faint dent on that stone slate that was a finger thick.
