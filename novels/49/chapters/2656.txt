Chapter 2657 I’m Here To Kill You (2)

After a long time, the black-robed man finally nodded seriously and said, “Alright… as long as you spare my life, I can climb a mountain of blades or plunge into a sea of flames. Tell me, what do you need my help with?”

“Go toward that black tower.” The Paragon looked at the black tower.

A strange look appeared in the black-robed man’s eyes when he heard that, but he didn’t say anything. He hurriedly got up from the ground and walked towards the black tower.

The black-robed man was extremely cautious with every step he took. It was as if the black tower was an extremely dangerous place. One might lose their life if he was careless.

If that was not the case, why did those two not approach the black tower themselves?

After an unknown period, the black-robed man finally got close to the tower. His body began to tremble slightly. “Puff…”

The black-robed man finally arrived at the Black Tower. He wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and looked at Ye Qingtang and the Paragon. “Is that all?”

Surprise surfaced in Ye Qingtang and the Paragon’s eyes.

The black-robed man did not lose his mind when he got near the black tower. Nor did he show the slightest abnormality.

“Enter the black tower,” the Paragon commanded.

The black-robed man nodded and entered the black tower hesitantly. After about 10 minutes, the black-robed man walked out of the black tower.

“How’s it in the black tower?” Ye Qingtang asked the black-robed man with a frown.

“It’s a little dark inside…” The black-robed man began.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

The black-robed man continued, “There are many levels in the tower. I’ve looked at almost every level and they are just some old knick-knacks inside. There’s nothing special. Could there be some secret in the black tower?”

Ye Qingtang and the Paragon were even more puzzled now. The black-robed man had entered the black tower. Ye Qingtang and the Paragon saw him with their own eyes.

In that case, just as Ye Qingtang and the Paragon conjectured, the black tower had some kind of connection to the two of them. They were the only ones whose minds were affected by the tower.

“Is there anything else you need me to do… if not, can I leave?” The black-robed man looked at Ye Qingtang and the Paragon. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Sister Ye Yue, are you going to let him leave?” The Paragon asked Ye Qingtang.

“Anything is fine,” Ye Qingtang said. In the next second, the Paragon waved at the black-robed man.

Seeing this, the black-robed man looked like he had been granted freedom after years of imprisonment. He thanked Ye Qingtang and the Paragon profusely before leaving quickly.

A cultivator of his level was no threat to Ye Qingtang. There was no difference to her whether she released or killed him.

“Sister Ah Yao, I think that the black tower is really linked to us. Otherwise, the other factions would already be guarding it and not let others near it.”

Ye Qingtang said to the Paragon after the black-robed man left.

The Paragon nodded. “It’s really strange… I’ve never encountered such a situation.”
