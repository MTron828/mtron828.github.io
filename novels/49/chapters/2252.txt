The demon child narrowed his eyes.

“The demon energies here are very intense. I wonder what kind of power exists behind those doors.”

“Don’t tell me the black-robed person is speaking the truth? Could it be that the fiendcelestial’s will is behind those doors?” Elder Feng’s eyes flashed.

“I cannot be sure.” The demon child frowned.

No one had ever really entered the fiendcelestial’s tomb before. To them, this was all unprecedented.

Even now they still had doubts about Ye Qingtang’s real identity, so of course they remained suspicious of her words.

.

The demon child looked toward Ye Qingtang. But she just stood there in silence in the middle of the underground palace.

So the demon child asked, “Mighty one, are we to enter these doors?”

Ye Qingtang put on a profound manner. “Yes and no.”

The demon child narrowed his eyes.

Ye Qingtang said, “I do not know who is the fiendcelestial’s chosen successor. I only know that these doors are not for just anyone to enter. It was prepared only for the chosen one.”

Everyone was shocked by Ye Qingtang’s words.

If she had made them enter those doors immediately, they would probably be suspicious.

But now, she didn’t want them to enter? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Mighty one, I am a bit confused by your words. Since you are the guide and have led us to this place. why aren’t you letting us enter those doors?” Elder Feng asked.

Ye Qingtang replied, “I am the guide only for the chosen one, not for all of you.”

“…”

Everyone’s expression changed.

“Oh? I wonder how you will determine who the chosen one is?” The demon child asked.

Ye Qingtang remained silent as if she didn’t know.

Everyone knew that if not for the Temple of Paragon’s news, there would not be such a huge number of people gathering here. If Ye Qingtang’s words were true, it was highly likely that the first person to step into the fiendcelestial’s tomb was the chosen one.

Ye Qingtang’s obstruction and silence was inciting their desire for the fiendcelestial’s will. Almost unconsciously, their suspicions lessened.

“Mighty one, if you cannot determine who it is, why don’t we let the fiendcelestial’s will personally choose the fated one? Wouldn’t that be more accurate?” Shi Shangfei suddenly spoke up.

“How?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Mighty one, you said earlier that the fiendcelestial himself would choose the fated one. I think that for the time being, you are unable to determine which of us is the chosen one. Why don’t you allow us to enter these doors, and the fiendcelestial will naturally know who is the destined one. There’s no need for you to vex over this issue then.” Shi Shangfei explained.

Ye Qingtang remained silent.

But the crowd became thoughtful at Shi Shangfei’s words.

No one knew how the fiendcelestial’s will would choose his successor. Since the fated one was amongst them, it was only natural they all hoped that they would be the lucky one.

Obtaining the fiendcelestial’s will was the equivalent of rising to the very top of the Second Domain. This level of power was fatally alluring to anyone.

“No.” Ye Qingtang immediately objected.

But the more she objected, the more the people desired it.

“There is logic to Division Head Shi’s words. Since you cannot determine who the fated one is, are we to stand here forever? Even the chosen one himself doesn’t know if he is the one. In standing here we are merely wasting time. Instead of having you vex over this,since it’s the fiendcelestial’s will, he will naturally choose the correct person. Even if a large number of people enter, it wouldn’t have any effect on the fiendcelestial’s will, right?” Elder Feng spoke up.
