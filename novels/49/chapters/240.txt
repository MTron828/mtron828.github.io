Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang’s heart suddenly wrenched when she saw the cracks on the little dragon man’s face. Her expression turned cold, and with a nod at Lin Long, she drew out her sword and walked forward.

As the little dragon man was still panicking over how to deal with the evil spirit, it suddenly saw a figure appearing behind it.

It looked up and saw…

Ye Qingtang was actually wielding a sword and standing behind it since god knows when.

“Mo… mother…” The little dragon man widened its eyes in shock, and fear appeared in its eyes for the first time.

“Mother… leave now. I can hold it back. Hurry…”

However, Ye Qingtang shook her head at the little dragon man and smiled. “Since you call me mother, which mother in this world would abandon her own child… and flee for her own life?”

Her faint smile was imprinted in the little dragon man’s heart; it was beautiful and moving. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It felt something tugging on its heartstrings—something it had never felt before. The little dragon man only felt a warmth and an unfamiliar thing filling its eyes constantly.

Drip Drop…

A warm sensation slid out from the corner of its eyes. It looked in shock at the liquid that dripped down its cheeks and was at a loss.

What was that?

It… cried…

How could it be?

It was only a consciousness born out of the Heart of the Demon God, how could it cry?

“I will fight together with you, okay?” Ye Qingtang looked at the crying little dragon man and patted its head with a smile.

The little dragon man was stunned as it nodded absentmindedly. It lowered his head, and while its eyes were brimming with tears, the sharp and determined expression in its eyes was never erased.

It must protect its mother well!

Watching the little dragon man’s resolute back view, warmth surged within Ye Qingtang.

If in the future…

She really had a child, and if her child was like this little dragon man… she was really expectant.

However…

Looking at the evil spirit which was a few steps away, Ye Qingtang’s eyes sharpened. All warmth faded completely, and death filled her eyes.

Presently, this evil spirit must be killed off first.

The evil spirit saw the two offerings before it and let out a shrilling cry before lunging towards Ye Qingtang and the little dragon man with its blood-stained mouth wide open!

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath, lifted her sword, and charged forward together with the little dragon man.

Right when they were about to exchange blows…

A strong repressive force like nothing before suddenly enveloped the entire mountain forest!

Countless birds shrieked and soared into the sky!

The greedy evil spirit suddenly felt a force which elicited fear in it and immediately stopped in its tracks.

In the next second, a tall figure suddenly descended in the moonlight of which casted a dreamlike glow around his body.

That man stood in front of Ye Qingtang and the little dragon man. His large and tall back was like the strongest, indestructible mountain in the world.

Upon seeing the person’s face, the evil spirit trembled severely without control. For the first time, it looked fearful and actually lowered his head and back, retreating backwards step by step.

Ye Qingtang looked shockingly at the tall figure that appeared before her eyes all of a sudden. Under the moonlight, the person seemed to be a god from heaven who was filled with holiness and power which no one dared to infringe!

“Get lost.” A piercing, cold voice reverberated throughout the mountain village

The enormous evil spirit trembled in fear. Bending down humbly, it retreated slowly as though the owner of that was someone who could destroy everything in the world.
