Chapter 2752: Tian (1)

Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on Ling Yan. “You knew from the start?”

Ling Yan smiled. “More or less, but I couldn’t tell you. Otherwise, the consequences will be dire if things backfire.”

Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought. She never expected this was all because of her and would end because of her.

“Maybe it’s all heaven’s will.” The big yellow dog glanced at Ling Yan. “If this brat didn’t have the karma bloodline, we wouldn’t have been able to win.”

Ye Qingtang did not refute. It was indeed as the yellow dog said. If not for Ling Yan’s karma bloodline…

“Win?”

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, a bone-chilling chuckle echoed through the air.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang saw an almost ethereal star spirit appear.

“You’re finally here.” Ye Qingtang stared at the star spirit with a cold glint in her eyes.

“Hehe, young lady, you did not disappoint me after all. You… all of you did well. You did very well and helped me eliminate a major problem.” The star spirit turned into an old man with white hair and beard.

Looking at the old man in front of her, Ye Qingtang said coldly, “I understand now. The mysterious old man who spoke to my white tiger earlier on should be you, right?”

The old man smiled. “It was indeed me. I’ve revealed enough information to make that white tiger wary of the guide in your heart. Of course, it was for your own good.”

“Young lady, no… to be exact, you should be my younger sister. Unfortunately, you insisted on competing with me for the throne. Why didn’t you respect your elder brother?”

......

“Elder Brother?” Ye Qingtang stared at the old man and sneered. “Are you worthy?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Although you harbor hostility towards me, I have been protecting you since you were born. You are my hope and you have not disappointed me now… Come, dig out your heart for me.” The old man stared at Ye Qingtang with excitement in his eyes.

“If you want my Heavenly Dao energy, come and get it.”

Ye Qingtang hooked her index finger at the old man in provocation.

“Sigh, you really won’t give up until the very end. Since you are so disobedient, I have no choice but to do this…”

As soon as the old man finished speaking, he turned into an afterimage and vanished on the spot.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang slashed forward expressionlessly. In an instant, the surroundings were covered by sword qi, causing the ground to collapse and everything to tremble.

When Ye Qingtang slashed out, the will of the sword surged and could shatter even the heavens.

“This is a power that is close to Tian’s…”

Ye Qingtang muttered after sensing the power of her attack.

“Hahahaha, very good… very good. You are indeed no disappointment. This power… as long as I can obtain it, I can become the next Tian!”

The old man appeared thousands of miles away. His expression became increasingly agitated when he saw the power of Ye Qingtang’s attack.

Swoosh!

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang had traveled thousands of kilometers and appeared in front of the old man.

“Destroy.”

The old man smiled. Day turned into night and a terrifying aura engulfed the world. It was as if an apocalypse was about to happen. A pair of huge blood-colored eyes appeared in the void and shot out two pitch-black rays of destruction.

“This destructive force…”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Even at her current level, she could still feel the immense threat.
