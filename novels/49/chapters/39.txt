Chapter 40: Turning the Sky Wheel (2)

As Ye Xun gazed at the approaching Ye Qingtang across the crowd, a gleam in her eyes revealed her scorn towards her, which she had cleverly disguised without anyone noticing.

“Duan-lang, but she’s….” Ye Xun feigned unease as she looked at Duan Tianrao.

Duan Tianrao shook his head at her and stated: “That’s none of your concern. We’ll be married next year and you’re no longer just part of the Ye household. So, you don’t have to worry too much about their matters.”

Duan Tianrao appreciated Ye Qingtang’s understanding, at not kicking up a fuss over his engagement matters in public. But whether she was able to turn the wheel, or whether she would be an embarrassment to her family mattered naught to him.

When Ye Qingtang stepped onto the stage, Duan Tianrao hugged Ye Xun’s waist brazenly and with a single leap, they descended gracefully to the floor.

Only Ye Qingtang remained on the spacious altar’s stage.

“Bro, the Ye household’s really sending her? Given her current condition, it’ll be a wonder if she’s able to turn that.” Duan Tianrui did not conceal his disdain, as he rolled his eyes at Ye Qingtang coming on stage.

“Tianrui, please stop saying that…. “Ye Xun furrowed her brows as she put on a despondent face.

Duan Tianrui retorted instead: “You’re far too amiable. You remember the day you sent me to get that Flora moonstone? She’s the one who snatched it up.”

Ye Xun pursed her lips and dropped her gaze, hiding a glint of appeasement in her eyes. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Xun-er, he’s right. Her well-being’s the Ye household’s responsibility and has nothing to do with you. You don’t have to feel guilty about this.” Duan Tianrao consoled her in a gentle voice when he noticed his damsel in distress.

“That’s right. Just sit back and relax.” Duan Tianrui concurred.

Ye Xun nodded meekly at last, without anyone realizing her sneer behind that pretense. When she raised her eyes to look at Ye Qingtang standing on stage, a gleam of irony could be seen from her eyes.

Ye Qingtang remained indifferent as she observed the gigantic Sky Wheel while standing alone on stage.

The common folk crowded around the stage shook their heads discreetly when they noticed her lack of intent to turn the wheel.

Given Ye Qingtang’s current circumstances, there was no way she could turn the wheel. Unfortunately, there was no one else who could represent the Ye household. If Ye Xun had yet to give her blessing on behalf of the Duan household, she could have participated in her stead, without Ye Qingtang having to make the attempt that was clearly beyond her capabilities.

However, ….

Just as everyone was assuming Ye Qingtang could not turn the wheel even an inch, beneath her face veil, a smile played on her lips. Suddenly, she raised her fair and delicate hands, placing a grip on the sides of the wheel, and with a chilling glance, she exerted her strength!

A tumultuous roar rumbled instantly, that was deafening to all surrounding the stage.

The Sky Wheel rotated without fail under her own strength, right before their eyes!

Not only was it rotating at a high speed, but in the blink of an eye, it exceeded two rounds and only started to slow down after the third.

It was only after a fourth round, that the gigantic Sky Wheel finally came to a halt.

That deafening roar ceased simultaneously as well.

And with that, a deafening silence filled the entire plaza.

Everyone was stunned as they stared at Ye Qingtang with their mouths agape.

“What on earth just happened?”
