Chapter 1093 Reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode (1)

The stars shone brightly in the night sky.

Demon Lord Luo Xue was sprawled on the ground

Ten thousand years of waiting and persistence. He used his last trace of obsession to persist to the very last moment.

Yet at this moment…

He eventually died.

Boom, boom!!

As Demon Lord Luo Xue died, this mainland’s Dimension Wall exploded into a million pieces instantly.

The last line of defense that protected this mainland was broken just like that.

Looking at the breathless Demon Lord Luo Xue, the entire Falling Sky Valley masses were extremely downcast.

The old Valley Master who built Falling Sky Valley by himself passed away right before their eyes…

“Look!”

Just as everyone was grief-stricken, a Peak Master suddenly pointed at Demon Lord Luo Xue’s body and shouted.

Upon hearing that, everyone’s eyes instantly landed on Demon Lord Luo Xue.

Ye Qingtang looked over as well.

This glance stunned Ye Qingtang.

Demon Lord Luo Xue’s fallen body suddenly turned into a streak of black fog and penetrated into the ground. At the same time, a blinding white light erupted from the extraordinary lady’s heart in Demon Lord Luo Xue’s body.

Before Ye Qingtang’s shocked watch, a giant tree and vines sprouted up from the ground, but it became calm very quickly again.

High up in the giant tree and above the vines were two fruits.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were popped wide open.

Those two fruits actually gradually grew into two babies before their naked eyes! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Everyone in Falling Sky Valley looked in astonishment at the two babies that formed on the tree. Disbelief filled everyone.

Instinctively, Ye Qingtang took a step forward and looked at the two babies on the tree.

Those two babies-one boy and one girl—had exquisitely-carved features, and their eyes were shut gently.

Ye Qingtang glanced at them only to realize that those two babies actually looked similar to Demon Lord Luo Xue and the extraordinary lady.

“Reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode?!”

Ye Qingtang mumbled almost instinctive as astonishment emerged in her eyes.

The baby girl’s body was crystal clear and had a heavy Spiritual Abode aura while the baby boy had an overwhelming demon aura.

In her previous life, after Ye Qingtang became a Holy Venerate, she happened to know a method that could allow a powerful figure to be reincarnated.

It was called the Reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode.

This method required a powerful Spiritual Abode to work.

The supposed source of the Spiritual Abode’s energy was the extraordinary lady’s heart. If this heart was broken, this mainland would no longer exist.

However, because of Demon Lord Luo Xue, the extraordinary lady’s heart was kept and stored away.

Now, the two of them turned into two fruits on a tree and then turned into humans…

Just as Ye Qingtang was caught in a trance, the baby boy on the tree suddenly opened his eyes. Seeming to not notice his surroundings, he immediately looked at the baby girl the first moment he opened his eyes, and his delicate little mouth suddenly opened.

“E-I…”

The baby boy seemed to be laughing as his big, bright eyes looked at the baby girl.

The baby girl seemed to sense something, and her tightly-shut eyes opened slowly and looked in the direction of that baby boy.

“You Yun… Demon Lord Luo Xue…”

Ye Qingtang looked up at the two babies with a complicated expression.
