The night was silent.

The faint moonlight entered from the window and was cast on the silver wolf’s body.

In the silence, the silver wolf quietly stood up, and its slender limbs allowed it to jump up onto the bed easily. Its deep eyes landed on Ye Qingtang’s face. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A small black ball of fog emerged out from Ye Qingtang’s chest. It wriggled a little out from the fluffy blanket and looked agitatedly at the mighty wolf above it.

“Would-be father, have you finally come round? Are you finally going to sneak an attack on mother in the middle of the night~” The little black ball was so excited that its voice trembled unconsciously.

It had already been some time since its would-be father came to its mother’s side. However, the wolf just remained at a side without saying anything the whole day and completely did not know how to get closer to its mother, which really worried it.

The silver wolf swept a cold glare at the little black ball, which immediately hid in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“I am saying this all for your own good. Otherwise, when will you be able to have a baby with mother…” mumbled the little black ball softly.

The silver wolf’s gaze sharpened, but when its eyes landed on Ye Qingtang, the sharpness in its gaze quietly turned into a complicated expression.

When it looked at Ye Qingtang’s hands, which were lying outside the blanket, its brow was slightly raised.

It could not help but recall the image of its body being carelessly touched all over by this pair of hands in the past few days…

The silver wolf slightly shook its head and completely cleared that depressing image out of its mind. It slowly raised its paw and placed it on Ye Qingtang’s abdomen lightly. A faint light from the silver wolf’s paw slowly passed through the blanket and into Ye Qingtang’s abdomen.

“Oh! Would-be father, is this a special… copulation method?!” The little black ball secretly peeked out from the blanket, and its eyes were dazzled with stars when it saw the silver wolf’s affectionate action.

“…” The silver wolf froze as it cast a cold glance at the little black ball that said shocking things, wondering if it should squeeze the little black ball to death with a paw.

Perhaps, it was because of the fact that the silver wolf stiffened and the strength it exerted changed, Ye Qingtang suddenly felt a little uncomfortable. She opened her eyes sleepily and looked at the silver wolf standing on its bed with sleep in her eyes. “??”

The silver wolf did not expect Ye Qingtang to suddenly wake up and immediately froze.

However…

“Uhm… Don’t play around… Tired…” Ye Qingtang, who was still drowsy from her sleep, did not even notice what the silver wolf had done to her. Her hands stretched out to hug and press down on the silver wolf’s head while her slim legs flipped out from the blanket and laid across the silver wolf’s body. With both her hands and legs, she directly hugged the furry silver wolf in her arms and even rubbed her head on the silver wolf’s face in extreme satisfaction.

“Be good… let’s sleep…”

The silver wolf was hugged tightly by Ye Qingtang’s octopus-like position. With a slight trace of movement, Ye Qingtang, who was in her sleep, hugged it even more tightly instead.

“…” The silver wolf could not do anything.

The little black ball still wanted to take a peak but was hit by the silver wolf’s paw.

The silver wolf looked at Ye Qingtang’s sleeping face, which was close at hand, and let out an almost inaudible sigh. It finally closed its eyes, and its body, intentionally or unintentionally, leaned against Ye Qingtang.

The little black ball which hid back into the Heart of the Demon God trembled in excitement.

Its would-be father and mother were finally “sleeping on the same bed!”

Mother will be able to have a baby very soon~ Heh heh~ So exciting~
