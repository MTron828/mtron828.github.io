Chapter 1276: Slaves (2)

Although Ye Qingtang disliked these things, she had been hard-pressed to survive in her previous life, much less bother with other people’s troubles.

But now…

Ye Qingtang vaguely sensed that Lady Ghost was secretly observing her reaction when she talked to Ming Gu.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curved in a small smile.

Outside the mine, the small Undead who was being whipped had broken a bone, and he was writhing on the ground in pain.

“Lazy bones, you still want to play dead?” When the foreman saw this, he did not show any guilt. Instead, he advanced with large strides and stepped on the little Undead with an ugly expression on his face.

“Get up. If you continue to laze around, I will break all your bones.”

He shouted and berated them. He did not treat them with a shred of dignity, dealing with them like lowly insects.

The other Undead looked on in terror. They were used to the abuse and the scoldings. Even if they wanted to help, they knew that this would ultimately result in the small Undead suffering even more.

They had lived happily in Central Mainland for generations. They had not expected that they would one day be relegated to this state.

“Please, please… don’t beat me… It hurts… it hurts so much…” The small Undead tried to protect himself in terror. His scrawny frame quivered as he was kicked and punched mercilessly.

“How dare you talk back… I’ll kill you.” The foreman did not show any pity. He raised the metal whip in his hand again and fiercely whipped the small Undead.

There was a huge bang!

The metal whip did not land on the small Undead’s body as expected.

The small Undead raised his eyes in shock but realized that the foreman who was whipping him had been flung straight into a nearby boulder. A large patch of blood seeped from his mouth and nose.

Everyone was stunned.

“Damn it, who dared to hit me!” The foreman’s whole body was in agony. He forced himself to stand up and suddenly saw the person who had struck him.

He saw a beautiful young girl smiling at him.

“Who are you! How dare you hit me!” The foreman shouted. All the other foremen in the surrounding mine shafts were summoned by the sound of his yelling. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Where are these Undead from? How dare they make trouble in our Long Family’s territory!” The foremen who had hurried over soon realized that something was amiss.

The young girl looked quite ordinary, but the child standing behind her, with his completely pitch black eyes, was emanating an aura of death. The seductive-looking lady’s eyes were different from humans, and she was radiating an even more intense death aura.

The foremen who had enslaved the Undead immediately saw that the child and the seductive-looking woman were Undead.

At that moment, Lady Ghost and Ming Gu were looking at Ye Qingtang. They had not expected Ye Qingtang to suddenly act.

A trace of a smile hung on Ye Qingtang’s lips. She looked at the shouting foremen with a cold look in her eyes.

“What’s going on?” An impatient shout suddenly rang out from a nearby mine shaft.

A luxuriously dressed youth with an oily face walked towards the disturbance.

When the foremen saw the youth walk over, they immediately went over fawningly.
