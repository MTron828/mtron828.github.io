Chapter 839 Intelligence

Although the elderly’s Arcane Supremacy realm was suppressed, his Supremacy aura was not weakened at all, and it had completely repressed Ye Qingtang, rendering her unable to move.

“F*ck. How dare you touch my person!” The little white tiger’s eyes flickered immediately. When he was about to burn all the stored energy in its body and go all out against that elderly in a Daoist robe, an apathetic laugh traveled into everyone’s ears.

“Ha… Interesting.”

The elderly in a Daoist robe stopped his movement instantly and looked at the direction of the voice.

At that instant, a male youth slowly walked into everyone’s line of sight.

The male youth was donned in white, and his every movement was cultured and refined. He had an extremely handsome appearance, and it seemed as if he walked out from a painting, completely unlike a human from earth.

“Ling Yan…” The elderly in a Daoist robe was slightly taken aback to see that male youth.

“Soul Eater Daoist, you’re a dignified Arcane Supremacy, but you’re bullying a lady when you just arrived in this mainland. It’s not too good if this news is spread,” the youth in white, who was called Ling Yan by the elderly, said with a smile.

“Ling Yan?!”

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang looked at the cultured and refined male.

Although Ye Qingtang had never met Ling Yan in her previous life, he had a well-known reputation! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ling Yan was the Third Prince of Eternal Dynasty. His martial endowments were extremely mediocre, but his intelligence was no different from that of a demon’s!

Ling Yan’s frightening intelligence once allowed him to toy a peak Arcane Supremacy to death when he was only at Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One!

Before Ling Yan, any wise person could only admire him greatly.

Many years later, a certain prodigy in Central Mainland started the Emperor Bloodline and trampled over all other six dynasties to become the most powerful dynasty in Central Mainland. Nonetheless, that prodigy did not dare to touch the Eternal Dynasty all in fear of Ling Yan, who did not have much martial skill…

Demon-like wisdom in the entire world, only Ling Yan was worthy of this description…

“Ling Yan, just you alone?” Soul Eater Daoist scanned Ling Yan’s surroundings and used the power of his spirit to peep miles around, but he discovered that Ling Yan’s people were not nearby.

After a cultivator entered the Arcane Supremacy realm, he could condense his soul, which was extremely useful. Higher than the Arcane Supremacy, a Heavenly Venerate could peer into thousands of miles around himself with their Divine Sense, and every single movement and object would not escape their spirit’s scanning.

“Ha…” Ling Yan chuckled. “Soul Eater Daoist, don’t worry. It’s only me.”

“Oh… It’s only you, but you still dare to appear before me?!” Soul Eater Daoist’s eyes flickered, and a thought of killing Ling Yan arose in him instantly.

“I came to let you kill me, and indeed, I told you that there’s no one in my surroundings, but you still aren’t killing me.” Ling Yan’s lips tugged up slightly into a devilish smile as he stood with his hands behind him, appearing as though he would definitely not resist.

“You…” Soul Eater Daoist clenched his teeth as he wished he could rush forward and chop Ling Yan’s head off. However, his rationality forbade him from doing so.

Given Ling Yan’s demon-like intelligence, he clearly knew that he would die without a doubt after meeting Soul Eater Daoist, but how could he appear here without bringing anyone and let Soul Eater Daoist kill him as he wished?!

“Why? Are you so timid?” Ling Yan roared with laughter. “Soul Eater Daoist, you’re truly more foolish the older you become. I’m only at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. As a Supremacy, do you actually not dare to step forward?”

“You… You… You!” Soul Eater Daoist gritted his teeth, and his face was flushed, making it evident that he was infuriated.
