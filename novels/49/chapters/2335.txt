Chapter 2336: Perfect Quality (2)

Song Yanhan’s eyes were focused on Yun Chen’s hand. Even now he could not confirm whether it was the palm flame.

As time passed by the minute and second, the sky started to darken with the night.

Song Yanhan looked away again. His elixir had been successfully refined!

The surrounding students were now somewhat bored and tired. When they saw Song Yanhan about to open his tripod and take out his elixir, everyone immediately perked up.

“Song Yanhan has finished refining his elixir?”

Everyone was amazed. They immediately turned toward Song Yanhan.

A wonderful fragrance spread across the arena when the tripod was opened, leaving behind a bluish-green elixir pill in the tripod. The elixir was covered in a faint, shimmery glow, looking exceptional under the moonlight.

Retrieving his successfully-completed elixir, Song Yanhan placed it in an open silk box.

Song Yanhan was the first to complete his concoction. Thereafter, an increasing number of candidates also ended their refinement process, but…

When they opened their tripods, the disparity was clear for all to see.

Apart from Song Yanhan, the elixirs of all the other candidates were dull and lackluster. Some of the pills didn’t even form properly at all. Quite a number of the elixirs were also suffused with a thick medicinal smell.

It should be pointed out that the most obvious sign of a successful refinement of the Sky Spirit Jade Elixir was its clear, light fragrance.

And that medicinal smell was proof of failure.

Those candidates felt their hearts sink into the floor when they looked at their own pills before looking at Song Yanhan’s.

There was no comparison at all…

“I say, this year’s test is just too difficult. The number of people who are able to concoct this elixir in the first place can be counted on one hand. And to compete on quality…?”

Select 10 candidates? It would be a blessing to even find five who managed to produce a proper elixir.

“I say… Yun Chen has been burning his for an entire day already. Have his ingredients been reduced to ashes?”

Someone noticed that Yun Chen had yet to complete his refinement. As most of the candidates had already concluded the test, the teachers in charge of judging the quality of the elixirs walked over. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They inspected all the completed elixirs.

The more they inspected, the more solemn their faces grew.

As a part of the Netherworld Academy medicine faculty, they had once produced a Grand Master alchemist. What happened to these students?

What the hell did they concoct?

Was this even considered a concoction?

Looking at those charred black, shapeless objects, the teachers couldn’t believe those things were meant to be elixirs. A few could be considered more or less properly formed, but the quality was terribly inferior.

When they arrived in front of Song Yanhan and saw his bluish-green elixir, smiles finally broke out on the grim faces of those teachers.

“Not bad.” One of the teachers was very pleased as he inspected the elixir.

Song Yanhan’s elixir refinement had been a success. The quality was not perfect, but the Sky Spirit Jade Elixir had always been a very difficult pill to refine. Song Yanhan was the only one who managed to produce a successful elixir.

And with the quality of his Sky Spirit Jade Elixir, countless people on the outside would be willing to pay top dollar for it!

“Elder Zhu has indeed produced a good disciple.”

All the teachers were full of praise for Song Yanhan. Even they might not have been able to successfully concoct a Sky Spirit Jade Elixir in one try. But Song Yanhan had managed to do it.

Indeed he deserved his reputation as the top student in the medicine faculty.
