Chapter 218: Burden? (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The residue on the tongue was mixed with blood. How many people could notice that? ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Zhou Xuan’s face clouded up. It was funny to recall how he mocked at Ye Qingtang previously.

They were looking everywhere for the whole afternoon to no avail, yet Ye Qingtang alone found out the hidden clues from such insignificant details.

Burden?

If she was counted as a burden, then… the rest of them could be called useless.

Zhou Xuan, who tried to make things difficult for Ye Qingtang, was embarrassed now. All the sarcastic things he said were punching his own face now.

“Junior Sister Ye, you are… good at… finding details,” Zhou Xuan said and gritted his teeth.

Ye Qingtang lifted her eyebrows and said, “Senior Brother Zhou, do you want to take the residue for further investigation?”

She moved the dagger with mucus closer to Zhou Xuan.

The foul smell immediately flew into Zhou Xuan’s nose. He stepped back to prevent any contact with the mucus.

“Junior Brother Liu, what are you waiting for? Keep the things here.” Zhou Xuan tried to remain calm as he called one of the disciples at the side.

That disciple had vomited a few times by the scenes in the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village. His face was as pale as a piece of paper when Zhou Xuan called his name. His unpleasant face was a clear comparison with Ye Qingtang’s smile.

Junior Brother Liu could not help but go forward and take over the dagger. His body was full of goosebumps instantly.

Ye Qingtang smiled as she saw the unpleasant faces.

“Only some of the skulls here have Duanyuan Grass residue, and some are not obvious. If you want to look closely, you need to take their tongues…”

“Junior Sister Ye!” Zhou Xuan stopped Ye Qingtang before she finished her sentence.

He could guess what she was about to say.

The sect disciples here all came from prestigious families. They lived a comfortable life when they were young. Though they were requested to attend the mission, they would never use their hands to touch the filthy stuff. However, Ye Qingtang did not seem to be bothered by that at all.

None of the rest wanted to scale mucus down from the dead people’s mouths.

They could feel the goosebumps by just imagining that.

“It’s getting late today. We should not rush now. Tomorrow, I will ask the Apothecary to find someone to do that. We need to analyze other things as well. Since we have figured out that it was all caused by Duanyuan Grass, we should discuss the potential suspects who could have used the Duanyuan Grass.” Zhou Xuan tried to speak in a normal way, but he felt constricted by Ye Qingtang’s behavior and words.

Ye Qingtang just shrugged her shoulder and did not say anything.

“Apothecary, please lead us to the place that we will be staying at. We will figure out the murderer based on the investigation today.” Zhou Xuan looked towards the Apothecary and said.

“Yes.” The Apothecary replied respectfully.

The Apothecary and Wu Zheng then led the group to their living place. Only after the gate of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was closed, Zhou Xuan and the rest felt slightly relieved.
