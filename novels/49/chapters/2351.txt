Chapter 2352: Intoxicated (3)

At this stage, Zhu Ning was full of shame and regret. All these years he had been obsessed with alchemy and researched it all his life, giving it his everything. That was why he detested people who didn’t take elixir-refinement seriously.

Previously, Ye Qing’s bold claims made Zhu Ning believe that he was just an ignorant layman, and this unfounded dislike of the youth only continued to rise.

But now, Zhu Ning realized that Ye Qing’s elixir-refinement standard far surpassed his own. How could he have been so blind and foolish?

He had completely humiliated himself because of his narrow-mindedness.

Zhu Ning hated those who didn’t take elixir-refinement seriously but was extremely respectful toward those with exceptional skill.

So now, his tone toward Ye Qing had subconsciously become more respectful.

“I have lost. But it is my honor to have witnessed Teacher Ye’s exquisite elixir-refinement skills. Teacher Ye, don’t worry, I will adhere to the terms of our bet. From now on, I will seal off my tripod and never refine elixirs again.” Zhu Ning stated.

A huge commotion erupted at Zhu Ning’s words. Song Yanhan’s face paled.

He never imagined that his Master would lose.

And to Ye Qing as well. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

If Zhu Ning sealed off his tripod, what would happen to him?

“Master! Please reconsider!” Song Yanhan hurriedly cried out.

Zhu Ning waved him off. “I have committed wrong after wrong. But today, I managed to witness a true expert at work, it is already a blessing for me.”

He had doubted Ye Qing and wanted to know who taught Yun Chen the palm flame. Now, Zhu Ning knew that it was indeed Ye Qing who imparted that skill to Yun Chen, and his initial doubts made him feel extremely ashamed.

Ye Qingtang looked at Zhu Ning. She felt that he was too old-fashioned. Nevertheless, she also felt that this elder did have some backbone.

“It is truly admirable that Teacher Zhu is keeping his word,” Ye Qingtang said.

“But Teacher Zhu’s teaching stint at the Netherworld Academy is an agreement between him and President Wu Fengling. Since the agreement between Teacher Zhu and the President has yet to end, we must uphold that agreement first,” Ye Qingtang continued.

Zhu Ning was taken aback by Ye Qing’s words.

Recalling how he had been so overbearing toward her and how gracious the latter was being now, he felt even more ashamed.

“Teacher Ye, I was in the wrong, so of course…” Zhu Ning couldn’t bear to give up elixir-refinement but he was unwilling to go back on his word.

Before Zhu Ning could complete his sentence, Wu Fengling walked up the platform.

“Elder Zhu, Teacher Ye is right. You lost to me that year and said that as long as I am in the Netherworld Academy, you will be a teacher at the medicine faculty. What? Are you trying to go back on your word now?” Wu Fengling smiled.

Zhu Ning felt a headache coming on.

“President.” Ye Qingtang saw Wu Fengling and Ran Mo standing behind him and she immediately knew why he had come.

Wu Fengling nodded.

“Ye Qing, I didn’t expect you to be skillful in elixir-refinement as well… you are truly full of surprises. But… you have really raised a ruckus today. I heard that you challenged Zhu Ning and Di Nuo?”

Ye Qing nodded.

Wu Fengling gave a small smile. He had already heard about the entire affair from Ran Mo. “I will handle this matter. Since this match is done, let’s forget about your challenge to Di Nuo.”

Ye Qing gave a strange look at Wu Fengling’s words.

“I am afraid that’s not possible.”

Wu Fengling was startled.

This punk. Didn’t he realize he was trying to help him? He would be in trouble if he really had to fight Di Nuo.

“Why?” Wu Fengling asked sternly.

Now Ye Qing looked exasperated. “Because… the match between Di Nuo and I has already ended.”
