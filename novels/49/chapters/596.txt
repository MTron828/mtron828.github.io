Chapter 597: Black Heaven Water

“Die!” The Yuehua Sect Master laughed loudly and slashed the giant sword in his hand.

“Rotten asshole!” Furious, the Blood Moon Elder raised his right arm and turned into a ball of demonic air, dodging the Yuehua Sect Master’s attack.

“Don’t be afraid!” Ye Qingtang shouted. “No matter how powerful the Yuehua Sect Master is, there is only one of him, but there are over ten of us. What should we fear!”

Everyone was shaken by the strangeness of this hall earlier on. Especially after seeing that the Yuehua Sect Master went berserk, everyone was even more fearful of the unknown, and their thoughts were a little messy at the moment.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, everyone took out their own weapons.

They would die if they did not fight, but there was still a possibility of survival if they fought!

“This brother is right. He only has himself, but we have over ten people. If we fought with our lives, he is not our opponent!”

After someone shouted that, everyone charged towards the Yuehua Sect Master in succession.

Previously, they fought independently and lacked unity and thus were naturally not the Yuehua Sect Master’s opponent. However, they had to come together as one now.

Most of the people present were inner sect disciples of super sects, and their skills were at Martial Qi Level Three. There were even some elders and wardens as well. With combined forces, even a super sect’s Sect Master would not be able to ward off their attacks easily.

For a moment, the first palace was extremely chaotic. Sword auras slashed across everywhere, and Dharma treasures were used.

In less than fifteen minutes, the Yuehua Sect Master was finally subdued by the combined attack.

The Yuehua Sect Master had a frenetic expression at that instant. “You all… will die. All of you will die here… Even with god’s protection… all of you will still die!”

“If you speak any more crap, I’ll sew your lips together!” The Blood Moon Elder walked forward and slapped the Yuehua Sect Master.

“Miss Ouyang… Sect Master is already subdued. You…”

A Yuehua Sect disciple seemed to be a little uncomfortable after seeing the Blood Moon Elder slapping the Yuehua Sect Master loudly.

The Blood Moon Elder looked at the person who spoke and scoffed coldly. “How about I lock you and your Sect Master in the second palace for you two to interact?”

After hearing that, the Yuehua Sect disciple felt a shudder run through his spine and did not dare to utter a word more.

After the Yuehua Sect Master was subdued, everyone decided to proceed further into the palace.

The demonic creature outside the palace never left. Even if everyone wanted to retreat from the palace, it was impossible. There was no other choice other than proceeding forward.

Very quickly, everyone passed through the huge iron door and arrived at the second palace.

This mysterious palace was extremely gigantic. Entering the palace, they felt like a grain of sand falling into an ocean.

As Ye Qingtang walked into the second palace, she inspected the place clearly without letting off a single detail.

Perhaps what caused the Yuehua Sect Master to go berserk rested in here.

“Holy Lady, there is something strange about the smell of this place…” The Blood Moon Elder walked to Ye Qingtang and said softly.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. She felt that it was rather odd as well.

“This smell is…” Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly furrowed. “Black Heaven Water…”

There was an extremely faint scent in the second palace which would not be easily sensed if not attentive. This sweet scent was extremely similar to that of the Black Heaven Water…

Ye Qingtang was in deep thought. In her previous life, apart from knowing that Ning Luo obtained the Black Heaven Water in this mystic realm, she once saw it in the second mainland. Thus, she always remembered its smell.

However, the smell here seemed to be mixed with some other things…

“Ha… Haha… Hahaha!”

Before Ye Qingtang could think it through, a crazy laugh suddenly erupted from the crowd.
