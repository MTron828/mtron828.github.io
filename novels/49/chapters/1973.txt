Chapter 1974: Male Pet (3)

Before she continued, she would have to pacify him first.

“The Second Domain?” Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed.

“The Temple of Shadows belonged to a different alliance named the Crimson League when it was in the Second Domain. The Crimson League had significant power even in the Second Domain. When the Holy Lord of Shadows disappeared back then, Ming Di was suppressed. The Temple of Shadows lost both sources of power and naturally lost its status in the Crimson League and was removed.

“But now, the Holy Lord of Shadows has made a comeback and Ming Di has been released. The Temple of Shadows certainly can return to the Crimson League,” Ling Yan said.

“You want me to lead the Temple of Shadows to return to the Crimson League and convince them to deal with the Ancient You Clan?” Ye Qingtang didn’t know much about the Crimson League. She barely had any contact with them even during her previous lifetime.

Ling Yan shook his head. “It’s not that easy for the Temple of Shadows to return to the Crimson League, but if you can make use of the Crimson League, you can easily strike the Ancient You Clan down with no doubt.”

“Make yourself clear. How do I do that?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Miss Ye, are you anxious?”

“Why don’t you make a guess.”

“Don’t worry, I will make sure to help you with it.”

Ye Qingtang, “...”

Why does it sound so weird?

Before Ye Qingtang could even make sense of his words, Ling Yan continued, “The Crimson League rarely interferes with the First Domain, but if anyone tries to threaten their interests and reputation, the Crimson League would never let it go.

“There’s no need for you to approach the Crimson League. You just need to make it known to the Crimson League that the Ancient You Clan is ambitious and is not only aiming for the Central Mainland, but also the Second Domain. Once that happens, the Crimson League would not just ignore it.”

“Even if the Ancient You Clan is truly ambitious, they are not that foolish to provoke the powerful ones in the Second Domain. I don’t think the Crimson League would be easily convinced.” Ye Qingtang felt that Ling Yan’s plan had a big loophole. It wasn’t like him.

“Miss Ye, don’t worry. I’ll let you know about every step, including what to say and what to do.” Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang with a smile.

Ye Qingtang could somehow sense that his gaze was unusual. She quickly changed the topic. “We can talk about it next time. I have some questions for you regarding something else.”

Ye Qingtang retrieved the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos that the various powerful ancient clans had handed to her from the space ring, showing it to Ling Yan.

“These are the fragments from the Spirit of Chaos. The ancient clans handed them to me. What can I do with it? Why is the Ancient You Clan so determined to get their hands on these fragments?”

Ye Qingtang couldn’t figure out what the fragments could be used for even after looking at it repeatedly. She wasn’t able to get any response from it even after pouring energy into it.

“There is no use of it at all,” Ling Yan said.

“What?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

“The fragments will only become something useful to the Ancient You Clan after they are pieced together. It would not be of any use to the Ancient You Clan if it were missing even a single piece,” Ling Yan said.

So that was it. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

That explained why the Ancient You Clan was after the ancient clans that owned the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos.
