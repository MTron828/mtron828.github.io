Pain was spreading around Ye Qingtang’s body quietly. Some kind of unbearable pain seemed to engulf her. She opened her eyes suddenly, but she was no longer at the snow-covered peaks of Lingyun Mountain.

“Tang Tang, you’re finally awake.” Ye Qingtang heard a tiring voice beside her ears.

Ye Qingtang was shocked when she heard the voice.

This voice…

How many years had it been since she last heard this voice?

Ye Qingtang instinctively shifted her sight to see a middle-aged man with a haggard face standing beside her.

“Father…” Ye Qingtang opened her eyes wide, unable to believe what she had witnessed. The middle-aged man helped her as she struggled to get up.

Ye Ling, master of the Ye family clan, stared at his daughter and said worriedly, “Tang Tang, your body hasn’t recovered since your spirit root was broken. You need to rest more. Don’t rush to get up.”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes opened wider. She was extremely astonished by the situation in front of her.

What happened?

I destroyed my own heart on the peaks of Lingyun Mountain. Why am I alive?

Father… I thought father was killed by the Great Elder three hundred years ago? Now… How…

A series of questions arose in Ye Qingtang’s brain continuously. Only after taking a glance at her surroundings, she realized that she was in her own room of the Ye family, a room that ceased to exist a few hundred years ago.

“Tang Tang, as your father, I will still take care of you in future even if you have lost your spirit root. You don’t need to care about what others say. Just rest well and recover soon.” Ye Ling did not give much thought to the abnormal behavior of Ye Qingtang. He thought that Ye Qingtang was just too shocked to pay attention to him.

Only Ye Qingtang knew how shocked she was internally in that moment.

She had revived and returned back to the Ye family three hundred years ago!

Looking at her father in front of her, Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with tears. Three hundred years ago, in her previous life, she was weak and useless. She could only helplessly witness her father and her beloved Second Elder being killed by Ye You’s grandfather, the Great Elder of the Ye family. However, she could not believe that she was back now!

Ye Qingtang sat up slightly, staring at her father whose face was full of concern. She tried to calm herself down.

At the same period of time in her previous life, her spirit root had just been snatched by Ye You. On top of that, the Great Elder threatened that her father would be in danger if she ever told him the truth. As a result, she could only cover up the truth by saying that she broke her spirit root by herself.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang thought that she would be able to ensure her father’s safety as long as she could tolerate the humiliation. However, she did not know that the Great Elder had already taken most of the power of the Ye family and had secretly laced her father’s meals with chronic poison. The Great Elder not only encouraged Ye You to snatch Ye Qingtang’s spirit root but also killed Ye Ling to take over the official master position of the Ye family.

She could only blame herself for being too naive in her previous life.

“Tang Tang, since you are up, drink the medicine before it gets cold.” Ye Ling did not notice the changes in her daughter at all. Instead, he caringly offered her the medicine that was still warm.

Ye Qingtang took the medicine her father handed over to her. Staring at the reflection of herself in the medicine, she went blank for a second.

The girl in the reflection had delicate features, but there was a red palm-sized birthmark on her face which used to be white and clean. The birthmark which stretched across half of her face totally ruined her original beauty, even making her appear extremely ugly.
