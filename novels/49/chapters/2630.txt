Chapter 2631 Han Cangming’s Ambush (2)

Now this unknown woman wanted to send them away with just a few words. It was obvious that she wanted to take the Heavenly Emperor’s corpse for herself. How could they possibly allow this? VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Everyone, why don’t we do this? Although we can’t tell the depth of this woman’s strength, in order to avoid trouble, we should work together to eliminate this woman first. As for how to split the corpse of the Heavenly Emperor later, that will depend on our individual abilities,” one of the Emperor-level practitioners suggested.

“Agreed.”

“I have no objections either.”

“In that case, let’s attack.”

Several Emperor-level practitioners leaped towards Ye Qingtang from the sky. They were so fast that it was difficult to catch them with the naked eye.

However, the first Emperor-level practitioner who suggested this did not attack Ye Qingtang. While the others were attacking Ye Qingtang, his lips curled up slightly. He immediately turned around and flew towards the Heavenly Emperor who was in the deep pit on the ground. “What are you doing?!” One of the Emperor-level practitioners shouted in anger. The others who were surrounding Ye Qingtang stopped in mid-air and looked at the Emperor-level practitioner rushing into the deep pit.

“That old fool tricked us into attacking that woman, while he takes the opportunity to get at the corpse of the Heavenly Emperor!” The Emperor-level practitioners immediately ignored Ye Qingtang and flew towards the Heavenly Emperor who was in the deep pit on the ground. No matter what, they must not let that trickster’s scheme succeed.

In just a few breaths, the others arrived at the deep pit on the ground. They all wanted to get close to the Heavenly Emperor in the shortest time possible.

The corpse of the Heavenly Emperor was like a huge treasure trove. Anyone who could obtain the Heavenly Emperor’s body would have a high chance of becoming a new Immortal Emperor. Who would be willing to miss such an opportunity?

However, just as the Emperor-level practitioners approached the Heavenly Emperor and before they could do anything, the Heavenly Emperor, who was supposed to be dead, stood up. He looked at everyone with his bone-chilling eyes. “Heavenly Emperor…”

The Emperor-level practitioners were shocked and in disbelief.

“This… Heavenly Emperor, how is this possible!”

One of the Emperor-level practitioners stared at the Heavenly Emperor, his eyes filled with shock and fear. How could the Heavenly Emperor survive the 10th Heavenly Tribulation?!

At this moment, a cold glint flashed across the Heavenly Emperor’s eyes. Before the Emperor-level experts knew what was happening, their bodies were torn apart and turned to dust.

In the distance, Ye Qingtang stared at the Heavenly Emperor and frowned slightly. She had been right not to approach the Heavenly Emperor earlier. Otherwise, she would probably end up the same as those Emperor-level practitioners.

How could it be so easy to raid an Immortal Emperor? Even if he really died in the 10th Heavenly Tribulation, his body would transform into an extremely dangerous Deity Ocean.

Before Ye Qingtang could think further, the Heavenly Emperor’s body collapsed again. At that moment, Ye Qingtang slowly approached the deep pit. She still had to be careful. Those Emperor-level practitioners who wanted the corpse of the Immortal Emperorthey were a lesson to be learned.

In fact, Ye Qingtang had already given those fools a hint when she told them that the Heavenly Emperor was not dead. But they had been overwhelmed by their desires and died as a result.
