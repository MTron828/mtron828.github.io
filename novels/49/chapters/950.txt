Chapter 951 Return to Lin Town (2)

“However, the Long family’s appearance is beneficial to Lin Town as well. In the past year, Lin Town is more prosperous than before, and the Long family’s businesses are everywhere.”

A certain elderly laughed softly.

“Of course. The Long family is too powerful. The Si family and Ye family still dared to resist initially, but they don’t even have the courage to fight back now!” A young man commented. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“The Long family took over too many businesses from the Ye and Si family. Nearly half of the Ye and Si family’s businesses were absorbed by the Long family. Look at the wise Duan family which understood the times. Soon after the Long family rooted itself in Lin Town, the Duan family leaned on the Long family and offered all their businesses to the Long family. Currently, the Duan family has become a subsidiary family clan of the Long family but is also extremely wealthy and much more powerful than before. With the Long family’s assistance, the Duan family has already beaten the Si and Ye family!”

“Is that Long family really so powerful? The Ye and Si family have at least several hundreds of years of history in Lin Town already.” A person had a confused expression as he did not have much knowledge about the Long family.

“There are things you don’t know. The Clan Master of the Long family is a mighty figure from another town and is at the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm. How can the Ye and Si family be able to fight against the Long family? If not for the fact that the Long family saw some exploitative use of the Ye and Si family, it would already have taken over them a long time ago!” The elderly explained.

“What… Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?!”

After learning of Clan Master Long’s martial skills, everyone was startled and in disbelief. Even the super-powerful cultivators in sects were not even at this realm!

To the family clans in the town, one was already considered an unparalleled, powerful figure if one’s skills could enter the Martial Qi Level Two realm. They had never seen a cultivator at Martial Qi Level Three before, not to mention a so-called half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. To the masses, that was simply an invincible realm that existed only in legends.

“Long family…”

Ye Qingtang began thinking. She truly had no impression of the Long family at all.

She did not think much about it, however. The Si residence was right ahead, and Ye Qingtang headed over to meet the Si’s.

When she was in Lin Town, the Si family took great care of her, and she never forgot about

“Who are you! Stop!”

A few guards at the entrance of the Si residence immediately stopped Ye Qingtang.

“Notify Clan Master Si that Ye Qingtang is here to pay a visit.” Ye Qingtang told the few guards who prevented her from entering.

“Ye Qingtang… Young Miss Ye of Ye family?”.

The few guards were dumbfounded. Subsequently, one of them nodded and informed Ye Qingtang to wait for a moment.

Before long, a young male in white walked out with the guard.

“Tang Tang, it’s indeed you…” The male in white was surprised to see Ye Qingtang.

It had been almost two years since Ye Qingtang left Lin Town, and it was unexpected for her to return today.

“Brother Si Ye, how have you been?” Ye Qingtang looked at the male and asked with a smile.

The male in white before her was the Young Master of the Si family, Si Ye, whom Ye Qingtang was familiar with.

“Quick, come in with me!” Si Ye laughed and hurriedly led Ye Qingtang into the Si residence.

“Is Grandfather Si in?”

After entering the Si residence, Ye Qingtang looked at Si Ye and asked.

“Mhm… Grandfather is at home. However, he was injured awhile ago; thus, he is unable to go out to receive you.” Si Ye answered.

“Grandfather Si is injured?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback. “What happened?”
