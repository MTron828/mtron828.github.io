Chapter 1622: Mission Countdown (3)

“Tang, the Kingdom Protector of the Glorious Kingdom is very formidable. It’s said that he can control the land and cause landslides and crack the ground with his bare hands... Are you confident that you can beat him?” The Supreme League King did anticipate the enemies to send their kingdom protectors, but the one from the Glorious Kingdom was considered rather powerful out of all the kingdom protectors.

Ye Qingtang smiled briefly and gave the Supreme League King a comforting look.

“Don’t worry, Your Majesty.” Afterward, Ye Qingtang leaped up and flew toward the battleground from the tall fortress.

At this instant, everyone in the Supreme League Kingdom was overwhelmed with anxiety.

Meanwhile, the allied forces were calm. In reality, the Glorious Kingdom Protector was not the only Kingdom Protector who was dispatched. However, he had a famous teacher and could fight in the war while the other protectors were constrained by the mainland convention and could not strike directly.

Nevertheless, in their opinion, the protector of the Supreme League Kingdom seemed very young and weak, so the Glorious Kingdom Protector himself seemed to be enough to deal with her.

The Glory Kingdom Protector raised a brow in contempt as he looked at the girl who flew toward him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Are you the Supreme League Kingdom Protector?”

“That’s right,” replied Ye Qingtang.

“Ha. Great... You massacred 500,000 soldiers of the Glorious Kingdom. I will settle this score with you today!” The Glorious Kingdom Protector jumped down from his horse immediately and cracked his knuckles.

Ye Qingtang glanced at him plainly, making it seem as if she did not detect the intense murderous intent emitted by him.

“I will use my hands to crush every single bone on your body, bury you underground, and make you die a miserable death.” The Glorious Kingdom Protector had a look of malice. Without any warning, he lunged forward and swung his fists, which could crush a mountain, heavily toward Ye Qingtang.

With a loud bang, the Glorious Kingdom Protector swung his fist toward Ye Qingtang’s shoulder. However, rather than piercing through Ye Qingtang’s flesh, his fist seemed to have hit an extremely sturdy block of diamond!

“Full of crap.” After uttering a plain sentence, Ye Qingtang used her hand as a knife and struck her opponent’s nape in a flash.

In an instant, the Glorious Kingdom Protector felt as if his nape was struck by lightning as an excruciating burst of pain spread throughout his whole body, causing him to turn pale from the pain. His tall figure collapsed to the ground in a stiff manner as he twitched in pain.

“Crush my bones?” Ye Qingtang looked at the protector on the ground, and her lips gradually formed into a smile. She lifted her leg slowly before stepping on the protector’s head and driving it right into the ground.

In an instant, blood spouted everywhere, and the protector’s head was crushed by Ye Qingtang’s step.

Control the land?

Ye Qingtang definitely did not feel that this person had such an ability.

Perhaps he did, but... in front of Ye Qingtang, his skills were so weak that he did not even have the chance to display his unique abilities.

Currently, Ye Qingtang was only thinking of completing the mission as soon as possible and exchanging treasures using her points. Obviously, she did not have the time and mood to continue being entangled in this world.

Retracting her blood-stained leg, Ye Qingtang looked up at the allied forces camp.
