Chapter 1104 Eye Of Extermination (3)

When they saw that, everyone from the Ye and Si Families looked shocked.

They were unable to withstand such a strong destructive force.

However, at that moment, Ye Qingtang descended from the void. Her entire body was filled with an immense demonic aura. She swiftly forced the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to its peak.

Boom!

Ye Qingtang reached out and grabbed the blood-red arrow, which instantly exploded in her palm. However, the force of destruction was absorbed by the Heavenly Demon Devouring power.

At that moment, a trace of shock surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. After she absorbed the force of the Eye of Extermination, both her personal cultivation level and the strength of her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline were elevated.

“Eldest Young Lady!”

When they saw Ye Qingtang, Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin looked rather agitated.

Ye Qingtang rapidly descended among the ruins of the Yunxiao Sect.

Master Si, Ye Ling, and the others all quickly surrounded Ye Qingtang.

“Tang Tang, what’s going on?!”

Ye Ling walked over to Ye Qingtang and asked with a frown.

A few days ago, a blood-red eye had appeared in the void. No one in the Ye Family recognized the giant blood-red eye. When the Si Family heard that the Ye Family had exterminated the Yunxiao Sect, Master Si brought Si Bai and the others in his family over to congratulate them. However, not long after they arrived, the blood-red giant eye suddenly exploded with a terrifying force of destruction. A large portion of the YunXiao Sect had been destroyed. If Ye Qingtang had not arrived in time, the consequences would have been devastating.

Even Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin were at a loss, much less Ye Ling. They did not know what the blood-red giant eye was.

Ye Qingtang explained the sequence of events so that everyone could be mentally prepared.

The fight between this mainland and Central Mainland’s ancient tribe would soon cause widespread death and destruction. Even Ye Qingtang could not say for sure if she would survive.

“A powerful enemy from the external world has invaded?!”

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s explanation, both the Ye and the Si Families were shocked.

“All of you pack your things and come with me to the Nine Nights Dynasty’s Falling Sky Valley,” Ye Qingtang said bluntly. This place was dangerous. Only the Falling Sky Valley which was protected by many powerful cultivators of Central Mainland, was somewhat safer.

“Alright!”

As time was pressing, they did not ask any more questions and followed Ye Qingtang’s instructions.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was standing in the void. She was looking at the blood-red arrows that were scattered everywhere. A mysterious gleam appeared in her eyes.With that, Ye Qingtang started actively flying towards the blood-red arrows.

These arrows of extermination could be devoured by her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. Besides elevating her own personal cultivation level, it could also purify her bloodline. Ye Qingtang could not waste such a golden opportunity.

Under the shocked gaze of the Ye and Si Families, Ye Qingtang actively headed for the arrows of extermination. When she touched them, these arrows that were imbued with the power of destruction were instantly transformed into nothing. They were completely absorbed by Ye Qingtang.

After half a day, the arrows of extermination within a radius of a hundred miles had been almost completely devoured by Ye Qingtang. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

When Ye Qingtang reappeared in the sky above the Yunxiao Sect, her cultivation level had increased significantly.

“Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven…”

Ye Qingtang muttered to herself thoughtfully.

“That’s strange. I can’t tell what Eldest Young Lady’s cultivation level is anymore…” Daoist Zijin stared at Ye Qingtang in shock.
