Chapter 58: Retaliation (1)

“Like I said, I’ve already shown mercy.” Ye Qingtang sneered. But when she saw the Second Elder remained pinned to the ground by those Elders from the Duan household, she gave rein to her anger again.

The Great Elder and the Duan Household are all the same!

“The Duan Household are really getting out of hand. Not only did you people dare interfere in our affairs, you’ve even allowed your young master to raise a hand against the Head of our Household!” Ye Qingtang coldly berated them.

One of the Elders from the Duan household furrowed his brow as he asserted: “That’s our young master’s goodwill, to prevent your father from getting hurt in the scuffle. Your Second Elder had committed a heinous crime by plotting an assassination against your father and Great Elder. Our families share a conjugal bond and Xun-er has been on good terms with your Great Elder. So, it’s only appropriate for us to lend a hand.”

“Appropriate?” Ye Qingtang snickered, as a smirk played on her lips. “Ye Xun’s merely an adopted child and was never in a position to meddle in our family affairs. So, what gives you people the right to interfere just by being related to her?”

Ye Qingtang did not spare a thought for Ye Xun’s dignity and divulged her diminutive role in the Ye Household, despite she being recognized as one of the young ladies.

The color drained from Ye Xun’s face in an instant, before she clenched her fists discreetly.

“Or is the Duan Household trying to expand its influence? Interfering in our affairs as an attempt to exert your dominance over the other noble houses?” Ye Qingtang gave those Elders a cold-eyed glare as she voiced her allegation with a tone that could chill others to the marrow.

The Elders’ faces clouded over when they heard her statement.

They were invited at the Great Elder’s behest to deal with the Second Elder and had no ulterior motive. But Ye Qingtang’s instigation might spark off a clash between them and the other noble houses if that rumor was to spread around.

Speaking of rumors, those Elders knitted their brows when they recalled….

Just a few days ago, they heard a rumor of this young lady being in an intimate relationship with the young master from the Si Household. Presuming she had been frequenting the Si residence, if she was to embellish her story about what transpired today…

The Duan Household would, no doubt, find themselves in a tight spot. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

With that in mind, the Elders from the Duan Household faltered in their decision to back the Great Elder.

Ye Qingtang gave a condescending laugh before saying: “Dear Elders, if you haven’t had such an intention, shouldn’t you let go of our Second Elder this instant?”

Those Elders had an aggrieved look on their faces before they finally released their grips, after thorough contemplation.

Ye Qingtang was a nobody, and nothing about her demanded their discretion, aside from her relationship with the Si Household.

They had no skirmishes with the Si Household in these recent years. To risk starting a feud with them over a favor for the Great Elder was definitely not worth the trouble.

When the Second Elder regained his freedom, he sprang back to his feet and tried to recover his inner composure, though he could not help but to peer at Ye Qingtang with a glint of bewilderment.

Is that the same timorous girl, who had been known to hide behind him and her father’s back all the time?

“Miss, that’s not the proper way to address Elders.” The Great Elder berated Ye Qingtang but he could never imagine she would actually foil his plans.
