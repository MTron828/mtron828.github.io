1417 The Guilty Party Files The Suit 1

“Elder Xu, it’s those two who snatched Sister You’s Bone of the Dragon Breath.” Ye Xun immediately pointed at Beidou Demon Lord after landing.

That Elder Xu looked old, but his eyes were bright and sharp. He glanced at Beidou Demon Lord and vaguely sensed that there was still someone hiding behind Beidou Demon Lord.

Beidou Demon Lord had never seen such a shameless person before. “What do you mean by snatch? My little sister auctioned for the Bone of the Dragon Breath with three hundred thousand spirit coins.”

“Sister You wanted the Bone of the Dragon Breath first. It’s clearly you all who snatched it.” Ye Xun could not be bothered with the auction or not. To her, as long as Ye You had her eyes on anything, everyone else had to give it up for her.

“You…” Beidou Demon Lord, who was not good with words to begin with, was so furious that he was left speechless.

“Hand the Bone of the Dragon Breath to us, and I can consider to let you all die in one piece,” Elder Xu said haughtily as his eyes swept across Beidou Demon Lord as if he had no regard for this demon youth.

“Can you all be reasonable? We clearly auctioned for this item…” The Beidou Demon Lord attempted to argue.

However, impatience was written all over Elder Xu’s face. “You all are not fit to talk about reason with the Jiang Family.”

Beidou Demon Lord’s expression contorted. He clenched his fists tightly and turned around to look at Ye Qingtang, who was behind him while secretly calculating the distance between him and that Elder Xu.

Elder Xu was already in the Heavenly Venerate realm. Although Beidou Demon Lord was about to advance to the Heavenly Venerate, there was still a big difference in his skills compared to those of Elder Xu.

“Little sister, leave now. I will stall them.” Beidou Demon Lord was not foolish either. This Elder Xu clearly wanted to kill them, and regardless of whether they handed the Bone of the Dragon Breath over, Elder Xu would still kill them for offending the Jiang Family’s dignity.

“You all have offended the Jiang Family. Do you all still think of running away…” Elder Xu’s expression turned cold. Before Beidou Demon Lord realized what was happening, Elder Xu flew toward them like a bolt of lightning, surpassed Beidou Demon Lord’s large frame, and hit the person hiding behind Beidou Demon Lord.

“Let me see who this person who dares to oppose the Jiang Family is.”

Feeling a forceful blast of wind, Ye Qingtang hurriedly dodged as speedily as she could. Yet, despite doing so, her cheek was still cut by the air pressure from Elder Xu’s attack, and it left a streak of blood.

At this instant, Ye You, who had been silent all this while, clearly saw the face of the girl who dared to compete with her.

She was dumbfounded by what she saw. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

That alluring appearance was more than familiar. No wonder she found the person’s voice extremely familiar earlier on.

“Ye Qingtang? It’s actually you?!” Ye Xun was surprised, and she glared at Ye Qingtang, whose face was finally revealed.

Ye You and Ye Xun left the First Mainland very early on, but they learned from the Jiang Family that all living beings on the First Mainland had vanished completely, and the little lady who devoured all life on the First Mainland was brought back by the Ancient You Clan.

They thought that…

Ye Qingtang had already died in the First Mainland. Yet, unexpectedly, she was still alive?

What’s more, she even came to the Central Mainland.

Ye You squinted slightly as a murderous expression emerged in her eyes.

“Why? Do you all know her?” Elder Xu looked at Ye You and Ye Xun.
