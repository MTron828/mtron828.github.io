Chapter 2747: The Owner Of The Heart Of The Heavenly Dao (2)

“How can I gather enough?” Ye Qingtang asked hurriedly.

“There are two ways. The first is to cultivate, and the second is to snatch it directly. If it’s cultivation, it will take tens of millions of years to gather enough, so it’s quite unrealistic. If you want to snatch it, only the power of the god-level Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline can do it,” the big yellow dog said.

“God-level Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline…” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was far from the god-level.

The power of the Heavenly Demon Pearl was almost exhausted. Although it had substantially increased the level of her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, it still could not compare to a god-level.

“Let’s wait and see,” the big yellow dog finally said.

In the end, that was the only thing Ye Qingtang could do for now. Although she could not find the God of Nature, Ye Qingtang believed that he would definitely come looking for her. Perhaps it was not time yet.

...

In the blink of an eye, several years had passed.

Ye Qingtang lived in the Great Immortal Temple for the past few years. Many supreme factions wanted to target the Great Immortal Temple after seeing its decline, but they were all destroyed by Ye Qingtang without exception.

Currently, the strongest faction in the Third Domain was the Deity Realm, with Feng Jiuyou nearly at immortal-level. With Ye Qingtang in charge, no one dared to offend the Great Immortal Sky Temple. The two brothers, Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou, would even visit the Great Immortal Sky Temple every few days.

...

Inside the Great Immortal Temple.

Two white tigers sat beside Ye Qingtang.

......

After a while, Ye Qingtang opened her eyes and exhaled.

She had absorbed a little more power from the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. Unfortunately, the guide was very difficult to deal with. Otherwise, she would have already absorbed all the Heavenly Dao energy in the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

“Qingtang.”

Suddenly, one of the white tigers’ gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

This white tiger was the little white tiger’s father. He had once participated in a major battle with the High Monk in the Fourth Domain.

“Senior.” Ye Qingtang looked at the white tiger.

“I don’t know why, but that terrifying aura is getting increasingly closer… I wonder if it’s just my imagination.” The white tiger seemed to be in deep thought.

“Is it… the black shadow that forced the High Monk to his death?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The white tiger nodded. “Indeed… it was extremely humiliating to think of it. We didn’t even get to see their faces before we were utterly defeated…”

Indeed, Ye Qingtang had seen how terrifying those two black shadows were.

“Sister Ye Yue…”

Feng Wuyin barged in.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on Feng Wuyin.

“Sister Ye Yue, what’s going on in the upper realm… Brother Jiuyou broke through and entered the upper realm, but… the upper realm has become a land of death… so Jiuyou returned,” Feng Wuyin said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I’m not sure either.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

In her previous life, Feng Jiuyou should have gone to the upper realm. However, Ye Qingtang guessed that Feng Jiuyou or the other Perfected Immortals in the upper realm were killed by someone or some force.

“Sister, that’s not the main point… Actually… I came here to tell you…” Feng Wuyin stared at Ye Qingtang’s face with an awkward expression. He wanted to say something but was unable to.

“Actually… Sister Ye Yue, I…”

Before Feng Jiuyou could finish speaking, Ye Qingtang turned into a shadow and disappeared.
