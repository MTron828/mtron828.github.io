Chapter 2125: Netherworld Academy (1)

“Why didn’t you close this back door after you brought her to this temple?” The Fox Demon’s voice was icy.

Elder Hua was speechless. How was she to know that Ye Qingtang would escape!

“Immediately send some men to find her!”

...

By the time the Temple of Paragon realized that Ye Qingtang had gone missing, she had already disappeared without a trace from the Sky Temple.

At this moment, she was hiding in a dense forest about a hundred miles away from the Sky Temple. She finally stopped for a break after making sure that she had fled far enough.

After the Sea King left, Ye Qingtang had secretly eavesdropped on the situation outside. After hearing that the Sea King was going to reactivate the Sea Clan’s divine item there and then, Ye Qingtang knew that...

Her chance to escape had come!

Taking advantage of the time during which the Sea King was reactivating the item, Ye Qingtang made her way over to the back door which she had already discovered earlier. She then slipped out and disappeared without a trace.

Luckily the Sea King had brought over a large entourage of the Sea Clan and there was a lot of commotion created by the reactivation. Because of that, her escape had gone undetected.

“I’m finally free.” Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief. But she didn’t remain idle. Taking out a set of men’s clothes from her space ring, she set them aside.

The Temple of Paragon would realize that she had escaped and she didn’t want to be captured again and undergo their attempts to determine whether she was the Holy Lord’s reincarnation.

Ye Qingtang changed her appearance and put on some men’s clothing. She specially altered her appearance to look more mature, and no longer glowed with youth. Instead, she looked like a handsome youth in his 20s.

After changing her appearance, Ye Qingtang’s state of mind also shifted. She was suddenly brought to the Second Domain and things had happened that were beyond her expectations. But the little lightning dragon’s resurrection made her realize that the people from the First Mainland had already been revived.

At least this was a major burden lifted off her heart.

Now, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao inside her was showing subtle signs of reviving, and the Divine Phoenix seal was nearly gone. Her most pressing need now was to find out why this Heart of the Heavenly Dao existed in her body.

And the only one who could answer all that was probably that mother whom she had never met...

Ye Qingtang thought about the Dragon Emperor Clan. She had to find that clan to seek out traces of her mother. This was the only way to solve the mystery behind the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

However, Ye Qingtang had a big problem.

The storm surrounding the mainland was not something that she could penetrate. Unless she devoted herself to cultivation for a few more years, there was no way she could pass through safely. She might even be discovered by the Temple of Paragon in the middle of her attempt, and there was no doubt they would recapture her.

Ye Qingtang did not have that much time. The Divine Phoenix seal would only hold on for at most a few more months.

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang thought of something which she had heard in her previous life.

Between the Second Domain and the various mainlands, some people could pass through the storms. Not everyone could pass through those storms but there were always people who needed to travel between the mainlands.

In such cases, there were quite a several powers who would dispatch strong practitioners to lead the way. Many academies would make use of a special artifact called the Wind-Calming Pearl to pass through dangerous regions.

But these Wind-Calming Pearls were very rare. Only the top academies in the various mainlands possessed them. Even so, their numbers were very sparse.

If she could get her hands on a Wind-Calming Pearl that meant she could leave this mainland.

Ye Qingtang’s thoughts started to become clearer. Memories from her past life surfaced in her mind, containing all the information about this mainland. According to those memories, several academies on this mainland had the Wind-Calming Pearl...
