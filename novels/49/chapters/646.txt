“Heh heh, it is my blessing to be able to follow behind you.” The Blood Moon Elder nodded repeatedly.

Before waiting for the little white tiger to continue saying anything, Ye Qingtang interrupted them impatiently and carried the little white tiger in her arms. She flew above the icy lake and walked towards the black ball that floated in the air.

“Eat.” Ye Qingtang spoke and quickly placed the little white tiger beside the black ball.

Without saying nonsense, the little white tiger opened its mouth wide and started to absorb the demonic aura on the black ball.

The black ball that was floating in the air was condensed by the demonic aura in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm. It had enormous energy, and the little white tiger needed some time to absorb all of it.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang was in thought as she looked at the black ball.

Previously, the Heart of the Demon God in her body could absorb the demonic aura on the little white tiger, so could it absorb the demonic aura energy in the black ball as well?

At that thought, her heart moved at will.

Buzz!

The Heart of the Demon God started beating quickly.

In the next second, the Heart of the Demon God actually started to absorb the demonic aura of the black ball.

The little white tiger was stunned at the sight. It looked at Ye Qingtang and said in a panic, “F*ck you. You’re even snatching my food. Are you human!”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared at the little white tiger blankly.

She only had this thought earlier on, but who knew that the Heart of the Demon God would act on its own and begin to absorb the demonic aura energy? It was not what she could control…

“Forget it that you’re snatching my food… but you’re absorbing it faster than me… What is the meaning of this? F*ck you!” At that moment, the little white tiger used all its energy desperately and began to suck the demonic aura of the black ball.

Yet, despite so, the Heart of the Demon God began to absorb even faster.

About fifteen minutes later, the Heart of the Demon God absorbed one-third of the demonic aura of the black ball and was in a saturated condition.

However, the saturated Heart of the Demon God crazily absorbed the demonic aura of the black ball which, through the Heart of the Demon God, evolved into spirit energy and entered Ye Qingtang’s body.

“Slow down, will you! F*ck you!!” The little white tiger was anxious and furious. “You’ve absorbed it all. I only ate a tiny bit. Do you still have any humanity in you!!”

Ye Qingtang did not respond to the little white tiger as she was astounded when she felt what the Heart of the Demon God returned to her.

After sucking the demonic aura on the black ball until it was saturated, the Heart of the Demon God did not stop. Instead, it turned the demonic aura into spirit energy and delivered it into her body. This spirit energy was extremely magnificent and faintly gave her a trace of another breakthrough!

Before long, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered, and the martial aura suddenly strengthened multiple times of that from before.

“Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three!” Ye Qingtang exclaimed.

In the blink of an eye, the spirit energy absorbed from this black ball allowed Ye Qingtang to rapidly reach the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three from the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, and there were no signs of it stopping.

“Mid-stage of Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three…”

“Late-stage of Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three…”

“Peak of Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three…” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!”

Elation emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

In just fifteen minutes, her martial cultivation achieved a breakthrough from the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three to the peak of Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three and even reached the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord state.

Then, the speed that the Heart of the Demon God was absorbing finally slowed down gradually until it stopped.

“F*ck you… Didn’t we agree to let me absorb it!” After absorbing the last trace of demonic aura on the black ball, the little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang with an indignant expression.
