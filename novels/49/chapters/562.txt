Chapter 563 As Beautiful As A Flower (2)

After signing the contract with her, this old fellow did not do anything good. He had always wanted to escape from her, though she caught him red-handed every time.

“It’s naturally great to stay beside you. However, is it possible to change my disguise?” The Blood Moon Elder truly could not bear his current appearance. To think that he was also a top figure a thousand years ago…

“There’s no need. It’s pretty good just like this.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“Alright…” The Blood Moon Elder piled smiles on his face, but it seemed way uglier than crying.

The two of them circled outside the mountain range for a long time but realized that quite a number of powerful figures from Formidable Heavens Dynasty had already entered.

Apart from the super sects Yunxiao Sect, Yuehua Sect, and Lingyun Sect, there were ordinary sects like Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect and even the main ruling Formidable Heavens Royals.

The Formidable Heavens Royals was formed by various small and large nations. Although they were all called the Formidable Heavens Royal Family, the main ruling royals were above other nations and were the true overlords of Formidable Heavens Dynasty.

“Falling Sky Valley’s people…”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were fixed ahead where a line of Falling Sky Valley disciples silently entered the mountain range.

“It’s not simple.”

The Blood Moon Elder suddenly leaned close and had a serious expression. “Holy Lady, almost the entire world knows that Xuanling Sect’s mystic realm has become an owner-less mystic realm. That is a place of inheritance with a sect’s heritage that goes as far as thousands of years. Once it becomes an owner-less mystic realm, it will definitely attract thousands of powerful figures. In my opinion, it’s better if we don’t go to this mystic realm.”

To all forces, mystic realms were extremely tempting. The mystic realm that originally belonged to Xuanling Sect became a gold mine without an owner because Xuanling Sect was trapped, and it was without doubt that all the forces would not let go of such a good opportunity.

After hearing the Blood Moon Elder’s words, Ye Qingtang was in deep thought.

After Xuanling Sect was ruined, the mystic realm’s array formation was broken and became an owner-less mystic realm, which had plenty of destinies and inheritance. Hence, those powerful figures naturally flooded in once they gained news of it.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder disguised themselves exactly because they wanted to enter this owner-less mystic realm.

Ye Qingtang had already speculated earlier on that there would definitely be people from the super sects who would enter the mystic realm but did not think that this many forces would appear.

Apart from the righteous forces, Ye Qingtang even saw a number of forces from evil sects.

“Strange…”

Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed slightly.

Xuanling Sect was, after all, a small sect. Although a mystic realm owned solely by a sect had many inheritances and destinies, it was not to the extent to attract so many powerful figures such that even people from Falling Sky Valley did not hesitate to take the risk and enter Formidable Heavens Dynasty. The risks and gains were simply disproportional. What exactly did they do it for…

At that instant, a row of young people walked towards them from afar.

The person in the lead was a stunningly beautiful young lady who appeared to be around seventeen or eighteen years old.

Behind the lady followed several males who were all donned in luxurious clothes and had an impressive appearance.

Every movement these people made exuded a frightening martial aura. All of them had at least entered Martial Qi Level Three.

“Nine Nights Dynasty… Ouyang family’s eldest daughter, Ouyang Qian…”

After seeing the leading girl, a cold glint flickered in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

The Ouyang clan was the number one family clan in Nine Nights Dynasty and was extremely influential. Ordinary family clans could not be compared to it, and even more than that, it was not weaker than super sects like Falling Sky Valley and Yunxiao Sect. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In Ye Qingtang’s previous life when she cultivated in Falling Sky Valley, she had crossed paths with the Ouyang family before…
