Before Li Jingwen sensed her, Ye Qingtang suddenly lifted her hand, grabbed Li Jingwen by the collar, and hurled him away instantly.

All Li Jingwen felt was a huge force at the back of his neck, and he simply had no room to resist.

Ye Qingtang raised her leg and landed a powerful kick on Li Jingwen’s lower back.

In the next second, Li Jingwen was sent flying several meters away before hitting a tree trunk and crashing on the ground with a thud.

All of this happened within a breath’s time.

Everyone in Blue Cloud Peak was stunned.

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples widened their eyes in disbelief as they watched their Eldest Senior Brother, who was unparalleled in their hearts, being beaten up without being able to retaliate.

“How… How can it be… Eldest… Eldest Senior Brother… Why… Why is he…”

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples who were still truculent and cocky initially could not laugh anymore now as they looked at Li Jingwen, who was sprawled on the ground, with their jaws dropped.

Even Yan Shu was utterly dumbfounded.

He had sparred with Li Jingwen before as well and naturally knew how frightening Li Jingwen’s skills were.

However…

Currently, Li Jingwen could only be beaten up in Ye Qingtang’s hands?

Li Jingwen scrambled up. Ye Qingtang’s light-looking kick almost broke his spine, and it was as if his entire body was falling apart.

Looking at the suspecting gazes of his junior brothers in the surroundings, Li Jingwen’s face darkened to an extreme.

To think that his face was thrown in front of everyone because of Ye Qingtang despite his position at Blue Cloud Peak.

“Ye Chen! You have the guts!” Li Jingwen clenched his fists suddenly, and a soaring aura suddenly spread around him.

A powerful torrent-like spirit energy surged towards Li Jingwen wildly, and his skin seemed to be covered in a layer of blue light in an instant.

“Flying Dragon Inner Qi!” Yan Shu was alarmed to see the blue ray surrounding Li Jingwen.

The Flying Dragon Inner Qi was one of Falling Sky Valley’s many profound techniques with an extremely powerful attack ability. It could raise one’s potential within a short period of time and was truly one of the most powerful killing moves.

Yan Shu never expected Li Jingwen to have acquired the Flying Dragon Inner Qi. It was no wonder Li Jingwen’s skills improved immensely over this period of time since he cultivated this powerful cultivation technique in secret. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Not only can the Flying Dragon Inner Qi increase one’s strength and speed, but it could even allow one’s defense to double.

Presently, Li Jingwen was forced to unleash his Flying Dragon Inner Qi, making it evident that he would battle it out with Ye Qingtang until she was killed.

Ye Qingtang looked at Li Jingwen, who could no longer restrain his anger, and the ball of blue light indifferently. The smile on her face never faded a bit.

“I want you dead!” Li Jingwen shouted and suddenly turned into a blinding blue light as he charged towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang looked down slightly, sweeping away the murderous intent in her eyes.

A wild gust of wind lifted her long hair up, and Li Jingwen’s aura inched closer rapidly.

RIght at the crucial moment, Ye Qingtang suddenly looked up, and she seemed to carelessly raise her hand that was dangling beside her. In the next second, however, her hand clutched on Li Jingwen’s fist that he had put all his force in.

“Don’t disgrace yourself with your smattering cultivation technique.”
