Chapter 21: Conceive a Child (2)

“Your Highness…. Is the Heart of the Demon Emperor here?” Mu Su asked.

The man nodded briefly. In the darkness, his profound gaze went over the locked gates to the Ye household. The gates unlocked and swung open by itself abruptly whilst the man walked towards the residence.

“Wait here.”

The man commanded in a deep and soothing voice. Mu Su obeyed reverently and remained on watch outside the gates as he looked devoutly at the man who stepped into the residence.

The little black orb that was snuggling in Ye Qingtang’s bosom keenly sensed something amiss. Its rounded form trembled instinctively before darting straight beneath her quilt.

In the next second, the door to Ye Qingtang’s room swung open without a sound. A stalwart figure appeared outside the door.

A sense of nostalgia beckoned the man to approach Ye Qingtang at her bedside. Under the moonlight, he saw the young girl’s exquisite and refined facial features that was akin to God’s gift to mankind while she slept like a baby.

Not the slightest wavering was seen from his profound eyes as he held out his hand over Ye Qingtang’s chest, that softness felt in the palm of his hand hindered his action momentarily, before he resumed his intention.

A waft of aura began gathering at the palm of his hand from where Ye Qingtang’s heart was.

The little black orb that hid under the quilt was observing the man’s actions discreetly. It darted out of the quilt anxiously, knocking itself directly into the man’s “indecent” hand.

The accumulated aura was dispersed with the orb’s collision. A dark miasma swarmed up the man’s hand as he frowned at the little black orb that settled itself atop Ye Qingtang’s chest, protecting her.

“You can’t take her heart!” An immature voice that was childlike resounded from within the little black orb.

The man’s eyes and voice were equally cold as he gazed upon the orb unperturbed.

“That’s mine.”

The little black orb became hysterical in an instant and guarded Ye Qingtang like there’s no tomorrow.

The man wore a slightly contemplative demeanor when he observed the orb’s behavior, “The demonic aura, to think that it condensed to develop a conscious… “He turned his gaze instinctively towards Ye Qingtang, who continued to sleep soundly. “Is it because of her?”

The Heart of the Demon Emperor contained the demonic aura that pervaded the world. Its presence had now condensed into a soul that should not have existed. Had the girl managed to awaken that aura?

“Now that I’ve a will of my own, you can’t erase me!” The little black orb exclaimed. It was originally, the demonic aura which dwelled dormant within the Heart of the Demon Emperor. It was finally tinged with consciousness, when Ye Qingtang called upon its presence. If the heart was to be retrieved by the man, it would lose its conscious forever!

It did not want that!

It did not want to disappear, just after having a conscious!

“That’s not up to you.” The man gave an apathetic response.

“If you dare to take the heart by force, I’ll blow myself up and you’ll be left with nothing!” The orb retorted in anger.

The man’s eyes squinted slightly, flashing a menacing and chilling gaze.

Nothing had dared to threaten him.

As though it picked up on the man’s dangerous vibes, the little black orb could not help but to shrink back in fear.

“I…. I may return the heart to you, but you’ve got to give me a body first.”

“That’s impossible.” A demonic soul could never possess a body.

“Its not impossible! That’s if she had a child with you. I’m initially your heart with a soul infused from her body, hence only the flesh and blood born from the both of you, will be able to inherit my consciousness.” The orb grew more and more excited as it spoke.

If it became her child, wouldn’t it be nice to call her mommy~
