Chapter 2431: Eavesdropping (1)

Somehow, the scene before her was not the Wailing Well but a blue-green valley.

An indescribable smell permeated the air.

Ye Qingtang felt that this smell was somewhat familiar. She could clearly remember being attacked by that above-Emperor level monster. Why had she suddenly appeared in this valley?

Just as Ye Qingtang was feeling befuddled, sounds of fighting drifted over.

Ye Qingtang instinctively hid behind a large tree, and several figures suddenly flashed before her eyes.

The figures left Ye Qingtang stunned by the sight.

Several demons were sprinting vigorously. A heavily-injured demon was desperately running in front, with several behind in close pursuit. They appeared intent on catching it.

And that demon being chased looked exceptionally familiar to Ye Qingtang.

“Hu?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

Wasn’t this Hu from the east demon faction in the Cursed Land?

What was going on?

Could it be that…

She had returned to the Cursed Land? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Since Ye Qingtang pretended to be a demon to stay hidden in the east demon faction and inadvertently obtained the Deity Ocean, the east faction had been pursued by the other demon camps. Thereafter, Ye Qingtang had used the Deity Ocean to leave the Cursed Land. She never imagined that she would return one day.

Hu was still being chased and this meant that the other demons had not stopped pursuing the east faction…

Could it be… the Deity Ocean inside her sensed the danger she was in and teleported her here?

Ye Qingtang could not understand what had happened. In the next moment, she felt dizzy and the valley disappeared before her eyes to be replaced by a bone-chilling cold.

When Ye Qingtang opened her eyes again, it was dark and blurry. It was like there was a layer of frozen ice before her. Engulfed by the chilly air, Ye Qingtang could feel the Deity Ocean inside her vibrate, its power gradually fading away.

It looked like she had guessed correctly. At the moment of imminent death, the Deity Ocean had been activated and she was transported back to the Cursed Land.

But now…

Where was she?

Ye Qingtang was not sure. After the Deity Ocean transported her out of the Cursed Land, she was now trapped beneath a lake that had frozen over.

Thick ice layers had formed over the surface of the lake under which she now was trapped. The strangest thing was when Ye Qingtang looked downward, there was no water around her at all. It was just an empty space and she was floating in the darkness.

It was pitch-black beneath her, with no end in sight.

Just as Ye Qingtang wanted to try and break through the ice, two figures suddenly appeared by the side of the lake.

Ye Qingtang immediately halted when she noticed those two figures.

One of them was Jin Qianyang, the Heaven Dome Academy teacher whom Ye Qingtang had met in passing in the North Hall!

A slender, delicate-looking teenage girl stood beside Jin Qianyang. She was not wearing the uniform of the Heaven Dome Academy, but that of the East Tomb Academy.

The East Tomb Academy was not well-known in the Second Domain. They were not at all comparable to elite schools like the Heaven Dome Academy, but in this year’s Inter-Academy Competition, the East Tomb Academy had suddenly performed outstandingly.

The sole reason was this teenage girl, who had won the top position in the individual martial arts competition.
