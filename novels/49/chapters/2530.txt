The big yellow dog pondered for a long time before saying slowly, “Since the creation of the world, it has been divided into the Upper and Lower Realms. In the Lower Realm, there were once gods and demons. The god race created the primordial human race… Meanwhile in the Upper Realm…”

Just as the big yellow dog finished its sentence and was about to say something more, the void around it started to expand and distort at a visible rate.

In just an instant, the big yellow dog jumped up from its kennel with a grave expression.

“Restricted…”

The expression on Ye Qingtang’s face changed as well. What had happened?

“Little girl, stop asking. There are some things that you can know, and some things that you cannot. If I tell you, I will bring about a calamity that will be enough to destroy all living beings,” the big yellow dog said seriously.

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought after hearing the big yellow dog. What happened just now… could it be that the big yellow dog said something that it should not have said and caused the natural laws of the world to distort? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

No, it was not that the big yellow dog had said something that it should not have. It was probably… what the big yellow dog was about to say, that was something that she should not hear, she probably didn’t have the right to hear.

Ye Qingtang was surprised and curious. What kind of truth was it that caused the natural laws to distort so intensely? And what did the upper and lower realms that the yellow dog mentioned represent…

Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang now learned a shocking piece of information from the big yellow dog. It was that the world was split into the upper and lower realms. Moreover, even the most powerful races of gods and demons in the primordial era were just a product of the lower realm!

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang did not know about the upper and lower realms. Looking at it now, the world was far from being as simple as it once appeared.

After a long while, when the surrounding void regained its calm, the big yellow dog slowly said, “Your lower realm is ruled by the Heavenly Dao rules, and the higher realm is the same. However, little girl, I can tell you clearly that the Heart in your body and your Deity Ocean are not products of the lower realm.”

“So you’re saying that my Heart and the Deity Ocean are from the upper realm?” Ye Qingtang asked the big yellow dog.

“If I’m not wrong, the Deity Ocean comes from the upper realm. As for your Heart, I’m unable to see through it. Its Heavenly Dao aura is too rich and blocks everything.”

Ye Qingtang gathered her thoughts. No matter what the world was like or what the truth was, it was not important to her now.

The prerequisite for everything was one’s own strength. If she had absolute strength, she would know everything without anyone telling her.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang suddenly had an intense desire that she had never had before. She wished to become stronger, stronger than anyone else.

Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog and her eyes flickered. A faint smile appeared on her face. “Didn’t you say that you wanted to train me…”

In Ye Qingtang’s opinion, the big yellow dog was completely qualified to teach her and could let her skills undergo a significant transformation in a short period of time.

“No.” The big yellow dog did not hesitate at all and said frankly, “I don’t know how to teach humans. Besides, if it’s so easy to nurture expert practitioners, the current world should already be filled with such people.”

Actually, the yellow dog was not lying.. Powerful practitioners had never been the products of nurturing.
