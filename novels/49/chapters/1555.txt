Chapter 1556 Taiyuan Valley 3

Ye Qingtang guessed that some friction had arisen between this Cao Family youth and Jiang Lin when they were training outside.

“This fool Cao Xu really has a death wish. He actually dares to challenge Jiang Lin.” A few youths from the Jiang Family, who were standing nearby, glanced disdainfully at the heavily-built Cao Xu.

“Jiang Lin had another breakthrough in his swordplay a few days ago. Cao Xu is just going to embarrass himself.”

“I remember that when Cao Xu and Jiang Lin had a match two years ago, Cao Xu was completely crushed...”

“Haha, that’s right...”

The group of Jiang Family youths looked at Cao Xu and the others derisively.

Jiang Lin’s swordsmanship was considered one of the best among the younger generation in Taiyuan Valley. They did not expect Cao Xu to dare to come here.

“I defeated you in the past. I have no interest in wasting my time with you.” Jiang Lin raised his brows slightly and looked at Cao Xu patronizingly.

Cao Xu laughed coldly and said, “Do you have no interest or no guts? If you’re scared, that’s easily dealt with. I’ll let you have two moves. If you can beat me, I’ll leave immediately and never appear before you again. How about that? Or do you think you have no hope of beating me? In that case, I’ll leave if you kneel and apologize to me publicly. How’s that?”

Cao Xu’s speech was very sarcastic. The faces of many of the Jiang Family youths darkened.

But Jiang Lin frowned.

“I really have never seen anyone so shameless. Who are you to let me have two moves?”

“Elder Brother Lin, just play along with him so he can gain some self-awareness. Then, he won’t embarrass himself in front of others in the future.” Many Jiang Family youths clamored.

Jiang Lin looked at Cao Xu impatiently. “If you’re asking to be embarrassed, I won’t stand on ceremony.”

With that, Jiang Lin suddenly drew his sword. The moment his sword left its scabbard, a cold light shone forth.

The corners of Cao Xu’s mouth curved in a frosty smile when he saw that Jiang Lin had drawn his sword. He rolled his neck, and a cracking noise could be heard. Then, he said, “Come on. I’m waiting for you to embarrass me.”

A cold light flashed across Jiang Lin’s eyes. He suddenly swept his sword towards Cao Xu.

But Cao Xu did not try to avoid the blow. He stood upright in his original spot, watching Jiang Lin’s sword descend on him. He actually bent his neck to expose it and moved it to meet the sword!

“Is Cao Xu crazy?” Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief.

They saw that Jiang Lin’s sword was sweeping towards Cao Xu’s neck!

Clang!

A clear ringing noise pierced their eardrums.

Jiang Lin’s sword squarely struck Cao Xu’s neck. But it was as if the sword had struck Millennium Meteoric Iron. It did not even cut into Cao Xu’s skin!

A look of shock flashed across Jiang Lin’s eyes.

Cao Xu stretched his neck, and a cold smile appeared on his lips. He looked at Jiang Lin mockingly.

“First move. Jiang Lin, aren’t you being too dismissive? You didn’t use any strength at all? Just like a girl.”

Jiang Lin’s expression changed. Although he had only used half his strength just now, most people could not have withstood it. Two years ago, Cao Xu would not have been able to withstand it either.

“Elder Brother Lin, don’t stand on ceremony with this fellow. He thinks too highly of himself just because he’s stoutly built.” The Jiang Family youths did not think much of what had just happened.

The Cao Family mainly cultivated physical strength, and their physical defensive abilities were extremely strong.

Ye Qingtang, who was watching from the sidelines, looked on thoughtfully.

Her current powers could not compare to Jiang Lin and the others. However, in her previous life, she had also reached the realm of Holy Venerate after training for three hundred years. Her experience in combat was certainly greater than what these youths had.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
