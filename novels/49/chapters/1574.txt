1575 Cultivation 3

She advanced straight from the peak of Arcane Supremacy Eight Heaven to the peak of Arcane Supremacy Tenth Heaven and was only one step away from the Heavenly Venerate realm.

Although Ye Qingtang’s martial realm was low, she mastered four new sets of cultivation techniques and advanced two small realms consecutively in just a month. This speed was indeed shocking.

It was just that no one noticed her because she rarely left her room and neither her martial realm nor endowment was high.

Ye Qingtang was not anxious though. Thinking that she still had ten thousand honor points in her hand, she decided to rest for a day before heading to the Jiang Family’s sacred cultivation ground to increase her skills.

After making this plan, Ye Qingtang surprisingly allowed herself to rest for a day.

The moment she opened her door, she saw Jiang Shaobai kneeling at her door while playing with a baguenaudier with a lowered head.

Hearing the sound of the door, Jiang Shaobai looked up immediately, and a wide smile bloomed on her face suddenly.

“Sister Qing, I’ve been waiting for a long time. If you hadn’t come out soon, I’m afraid I would’ve died of starvation outside your door.”

Ye Qingtang did not know how to react when she saw the pitiful-looking Jiang Shaobai. Ye Qingtang did not know what was up with this little girl, but every time Ye Qingtang left her room to eat in this past month, Ye Qingtang would always see her and be dragged to have her meal. Gradually, the two of them reached a subtle rapport, and every two to three days, Jiang Shaobai would wait for Ye Qingtang outside her door to have their meal together.

“If you die from starvation, wouldn’t I be a huge sinner? Get up. Let’s go and eat together.” Smiles filled Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She was not against Jiang Shaobai getting closer to her; although she felt that it was rather strange, she somehow felt that Jiang Shaobai did not mean any harm.

With a grin, Jiang Shaobai hugged Ye Qingtang’s arms and walked out.

Along the corridors, Jiang Qi saw the back view of Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang leaving together and frowned instinctively, but he remained silent in the end. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang rarely left her room this month, and in addition, she had just come to Taiyuan Valley. Thus, logically speaking, there should only be a few people who recognized her.

However, as she was always with Jiang Shaobai whenever she appeared, she attracted the attention of many people.

Jiang Shaobai had an extroverted personality. Ye Qingtang found out that many people always greeted Jiang Shaobai whenever she was out with her, and it seemed that Jiang Shaobai had good relations with the people in the valley.

“Shaobai, why are you here so late today? We were all waiting for you.” A sixteen-or seventeen-year-old waved his hand once he spotted Jiang Shaobai’s figure. A group of youths who usually hung out with Jiang Shaobai was already seated at the table.

“Who told you all to wait? It’s not like I can’t eat by myself. How long-winded,” said Jiang Shaobai before pulling Ye Qingtang to sit with them.

The youths at the table were all focused on Jiang Shaobai as they chatted and laughed.

Because of Jiang Shaobai, Ye Qingtang frequently had her meals together with this group of teenagers. However, Ye Qingtang was like a transparent person that did not exist to them, and barely anyone talked to her.

Ye Qingtang did not mind either as she was fully occupied with cultivation matters. However, she vaguely sensed that although these youths always joked around with Jiang Shaobai, they seemed to be rather fearful of Jiang Shaobai from their tone; even if they were chastised by Jiang Shaobai, they mostly laughed it away and never fought back.

“Sister Qing, are you still going to stay in your room this afternoon?” Jiang Shaobai blinked and asked Ye Qingtang while biting her chopsticks.
