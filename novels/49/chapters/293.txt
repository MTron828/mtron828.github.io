“Senior Brother Yun, don’t worry. I will not let Lu Xiuwen off so easily. I will definitely make him personally return the Shangyue Fire Tripod that he stole.” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes which turned cold.

At this point, Yun Shu finally realized how complicated Ye Qingtang’s plan was.

Ultimately, leading the Warden to order a search would definitely off Lu Xiuwen’s last glimmer of hope in keeping the Shangyue Fire Tripod.

Yun Shu was extremely grateful to Ye Qingtang. If he was able to have the Shangyue Fire Tripod back, his future could, perhaps, be saved.

After walking Yun Shu back, Ye Qingtang then returned to her room.

Su Wan was also in the room at that time. When she saw Ye Qingtang, her eyes could not help but avert away. While Ye Qingtang did not say anything, Su Wan felt like she was sitting on pins and needles. Just a while later, she immediately left the room.

Ye Qingtang saw how Su Wan left in a flurry and scoffed internally. She walked into the room and touched the silver wolf’s fur, bearing this grudge in her heart.

Regardless of Lu Xiuwen or the betrayer Su Wan, she would not let any off.

“You’re back, Junior Sister Ye?” Lin Long could not hold back her smile when she saw Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang said, “How do you feel, Senior Sister Lin?” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“I’ve recovered a lot.” Lin Long chuckled and asked, “What happened just now? I saw that Junior Sister Su’s expression was not too good when she returned, and she turned even paler when you returned. Could it be that there’s a conflict between you two?”

Lin Long did not have any good impressions of Su Wan.

Ye Qingtang scoffed. “Conflict? More like she has something to hide.”

Su Wan always clung onto Yun Shu eagerly and guarded against Ye Qingtang like the way one guarded against a thief. But when something happened to Yun Shu, Su Wan jumped into Lu Xiuwen’s embrace instead.

Now, Ye Qingtang finally realized why she heard rumors about Su Wan and Lu Xiuwen everywhere when she entered the sect in her past life. It seemed… these two people must have gotten together after Yun Shu’s accident.

Ye Qingtang’s heart turned even colder when she recalled Yun Shu’s injuries.

With her here in this life, she wanted to see how this adulterous pair could harm her Senior Brother Yun anymore!

The Disciplinary Hall warden conducted a detailed search on the disciples who participated in the mission. Just a while after the search started, the stolen Shangyue Fire Tripod was secretly sent back into Yun Shu’s room by the thief.

The Shangyue Fire Tripod was returned to its owner, and the search was naturally concluded without any outcome.

After recuperating for a few days, Yun Shu’s condition gradually improved. On the other hand, Lu Xiuwen stayed bedridden for days after being flogged fifty strokes and did not even have the energy to get out of bed, much less cultivate.

As Ye Qingtang was appreciating the sight of Lu Xiuwen falling victim to his own evil deeds, Elder Qin and Elder Lin returned with a group of people.

Ye Qingtang just finished her cultivation and felt that her spirit root was going to make a breakthrough to the orange grade in a few days. Then, a disciple passed on a message—Elder Qin of the inner sect Array Faction summoned her over.

Ye Qingtang’s heart skipped a beat, and she immediately headed over.

According to rules, ordinary outer sect disciples would not have any chance to meet the inner sect elders. Thus, the news of Ye Qingtang being summoned by the Elder of the inner sect’s Sword Faction attracted much attention.

Ye Qingtang was led into the Elders’ Hall by that disciple. The moment she stepped in, she was greeted with Elder Qin’s smiling face.

“Disciple greets Elder Qin.”

Elder Qin was full of smiles. The more he saw Ye Qingtang, the more he favored her. When he thought of Elder Lin’s expression which was as ugly as though he ate dung, Elder Qin’s mood turned even better.
