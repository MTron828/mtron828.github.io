“I lost…” Ji Xianyuan took a breath and announced his defeat.

He picked up his sword and signaled to Ye Qingtang before walking off the arena.

Ye Qingtang was the only one on the arena now.

Ye Qingtang won!

She really won against Ji Xianyuan!

Everyone who watched the whole battle felt that it was so hard to believe.

“Was that real? Did Senior Brother Ji lose?”

The outer sect disciples would never believe what they just saw if they had not witnessed that with their own eyes.

Ji Xianyuan lost… to a new disciple who just entered the sect for a few months? Furthermore, Ye Qingtang only possessed a red spirit root?!!

Everyone felt it was insane as it was too hard for them to believe!

Elder Huang’s face was full of astonishment. He only realized what had just happened when he heard the discussions around. He raised his head to look at Ye Qingtang. It seemed to be a dream to him. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang really defeated the top of the outer sect?!

Was… Was it a joke?

Elder Huang was in a complex mood. The feeling of joy slowly spread out in his heart.

Previously, he did not agree with Ye Qingtang’s crazy decision, but now, he felt glad that Ye Qingtang insisted.

Who knew that this girl really would win!

Furthermore, she defeated Ji Xianyuan!

Elder Huang was delighted now.

Ye Qingtang did not lose on the arena, and instead, she earned the reputation for him!

Such a miracle!

No one expected that there would be such a reversion to the inner sect assessment. Ji Xianyuan who always remained as the top was defeated by Ye Qingtang.

The new disciple whose name was unknown previously suddenly became the top on the Honor Roll List!

Everyone was having a heavy heart at the moment.

Ye Qingtang was the top on the Honor Roll List now. The others on the list all moved back by one position.

Ji Xianyuan became the second, and Lin Feng… was kicked out of the top three.

“Anyone still want to battle?” The warden went up to the arena. He glanced around and asked.

Everyone on the Honor Roll List remained silent.

No one dared to challenge Ji Xianyuan or Ye Qingtang, who just defeated Ji Xianyuan.

No one went up to the arena after a while, and the inner sect assessment came to an end.

Elder Qin stared at Ye Qingtang in a satisfied way. He agreed to give the permission of attending the inner sect assessment to Ye Qingtang all because of her stubbornness. He did not expect that she would bring such a surprise. Her thirty thousand Xuanming points were really worth it now.

“Ye Qingtang is not bad, I feel. She brings a little surprise to the inner sect assessment.” The Fist Section Elder commended after watching the entire battle.

“Not bad indeed,” Elder Lin said coldly, but his sight landed on his grandson Lin Feng, who was kicked out of the top three on the Honor Roll List.

“Lin Feng had great improvements this year. I intended to take him in as an inner sect disciple.”

Other Elders were not surprised with what Elder Lin said. Lin Feng’s ability could qualify him to be an inner sect disciple. He was only kicked out of the top three by accident.

“The assessment has ended. It’s time to give them the qualification to enter the inner sect now,” Elder Qin said and smiled.

Ye Qingtang was the top person for the assessment, and the permission to attend the assessment was given by Elder Qin. The task of giving the qualification certainly landed on Elder Qin.
