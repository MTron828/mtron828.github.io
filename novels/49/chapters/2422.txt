Chapter 2423: Symbols (1)

Ye Qingtang’s group continued forward. Luckily they only met a few demons on the way and didn’t encounter any above-Emperor level monster monsters. With the protection of Ye Qingtang’s team, Lu Yuanxiang’s team also remained safe.

“Teacher Ye, we have been a burden to you.” Lu Yuanxiang was full of gratitude to Ye Qing.

Ye Qingtang merely waved off his words.

“These demons are not a problem. The key now is how to leave the Wailing Well.” Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought. There was just another day to go before the 10-day deadline, but with the defective teleportation talismans, what should have been a limited number of days now felt like an endless period.

How were they to leave the Wailing Well without a teleportation talisman?

“The Vice-President and the others should have already seen what had happened. I believe they will have a plan soon,” Lu Yuanxiang said.

But Ye Qingtang was not that optimistic.

The teleportation talismans had all failed, and the Wailing Well was an unfamiliar location. All around them were unknown dangers. If anything, Ye Qingtang had a premonition that the 10-day deadline might not be the end to this team competition, but the start of a new danger.

And this prediction of hers happened to be the same as Wen Qi’s earlier conjecture.

“What is that?” Qin Feng suddenly saw a destroyed patch amongst the dense forest in front of them.

It looked like the scene from the Maple Night Academy incident. A large area was flattened as if the ground had been turned upside down. Collapsed trees had fallen upon large mounds of dirt and rocks.

Ye Qingtang immediately turned to look at Mu Ziying. The young girl shook her head, indicating that she did not sense any living creature in front.

Only then did Ye Qingtang lead her group forward.

A large hole had been split open under the wreckage. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang stood at the side, peering into the darkness.

“Ying-er, send a puppet in to take a look,” Ye Qingtang said.

Mu Ziying sent a few wooden birds in.

Following behind them, the Flying Star Academy team saw that Ye Qing’s group had suddenly stopped. They also came to a halt some distance away.

“Teacher, what are they doing?” One of the students looked at the Flying Star Academy teacher in puzzlement.

The teacher shook his head. They did not dare to step too close and couldn’t hear what Ye Qing’s group was saying but along the way, he had witnessed how capable Ye Qing was in assigning the limited number of students in his team to handle the demons, all the while protecting the heavily-injured Lu Yuanxiang and the others. He had earned his respect at that.

“This Netherworld Academy teacher is still young but is so steady and capable. His powers are also above mine. How strange. Why haven’t I heard of this person before?” The teacher felt increasingly puzzled.

With Ye Qing’s young age, no one would doubt him even if he claimed to be a student. As young as he was, the way he handled crises was not at all inferior to an experienced teacher. Even the Flying Star Academy teacher himself had to admit that if he had been in the youth’s shoes, he might not have handled things as well as him.

“Wu Fengling, where did you get such a treasure?”

The Flying Star Academy teacher’s eyes widened when he saw Mu Ziying release several wooden birds into the hole.

“A puppet master.”
