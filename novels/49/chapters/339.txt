Feng Moli looked at Song Junqiu, who was trying to explain coldly. He scanned through the other few disciples standing behind Song Junqiu.

If he was not asking for a protection fee, why would he bring a group of people over to a new disciple’s place?

Song Junqiu had no way to explain himself now. If he knew that Ye Qingtang would frame him earlier, he would definitely not have smashed those Soul Condensation Pills.

He did not get a single bottle of the Soul Condensation Pills, and instead, he had to face the tyrant of the inner sect.

Ye Qingtang smiled as she saw Song Junqiu’s desperate face. “Senior Brother Feng, both of you said that you will look after me in future. I just entered the inner sect, and I want to find a stronger person to rely on. May I know… which one of you is stronger?”

Feng Moli sneered. His eyes were half-closed, and he stared at Song Junqiu. “Senior Brother Song, what do you say?”

A layer of red flames surrounded Feng Moli’s body as he finished his words.

The temperature around suddenly rose.

Song Junqiu could feel cold sweat on his back when he saw the red flame surrounding Feng Moli.

The Paragon Skill!

Song Junqiu’s brain almost exploded.

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised when she saw the flame surrounding Feng Moli’s body.

The Paragon Skill was one of the highest skills in cultivation.

Only people who possessed a yellow spirit root or better could understand the Paragon Skill.

People with more superior spirit roots could understand more powerful Paragon Skill.

There were millions of people who cultivated, and the levels of spirit root differed from each other. The Paragon Skill was the power that everyone dreamed about. Only extremely talented people could understand the Paragon Skill. The ability of those with the Paragon Skill had entered another level.

People with the Paragon Skill could easily defeat opponents in the same level or with the same spirit root, or even challenge opponents of a higher level.

It was just that…

It was extremely difficult to understand the Paragon Skill.

There might be at most one out of millions.

When Ye Qingtang entered the inner sect in her previous life, Feng Moli had already understood the Paragon Skill. However, she did not know that he had understood the Paragon Skill at such a young age.

The disciples who followed Song Junqiu opened their eyes when they saw the flame.

They would never dare to challenge Feng Moli when he understood the Paragon Skill.

Even though they had more people, they were so shocked that no one made any sound.

“Junior Brother Feng, we can discuss… discuss…” Song Junqiu felt that his heart was going to jump out of his chest as Feng Moli was about to use the Paragon Skill.

He would never dare to fight against Feng Moli!

Feng Moli totally neglected Song Junqiu.

Song Junqiu almost went insane. Others might not do anything extreme in the sect, but Feng Moli was the infamous tyrant. He was the only disciple in the Xuanling Sect who understood the Paragon Skill. He was the most talented disciple in the sect. Every Elder and Sect Master valued him. Even if he were to fight with other disciples in the sect, he was the only one who might not face any punishments.

“Junior Brother Feng, I broke the rules today. The ten bottles of Soul Condensation Pills will be my apologizing gift.” Song Junqiu, who was showing off in front of Ye Qingtang previously, was entirely frightened by Feng Moli.
