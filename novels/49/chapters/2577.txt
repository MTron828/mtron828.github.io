Ye Qingtang frowned.

Did this young man just say that she was an Immortal Emperor?

Did she look like an Immortal Emperor?

“You’ve got the wrong person.” Although Ye Qingtang did not know what happened, she still denied it.

“Got the wrong person?” The young man sized up Ye Qingtang for a long time and muttered, “Eh, that’s not right either. Although you look the same, the clothes that the Immortal Emperor was wearing were different from yours.”

“So you got the wrong person,” Ye Qingtang repeated.

“are you really not an Immortal Emperor?” The young man asked doubtfully.

“Tm really not.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“alright then. Perhaps I got the wrong person. However, you look like that Immortal Emperor. Are you twins?” The young man stared at Ye Qingtang curiously.

“Can you tell me more?” Ye Qingtang asked the youth.

‘This matter was rather strange. She had just entered this strange world and did not even know anything about it. But this young man had so quickly recognized her as an Immortal Emperor.

“Sister Qingtang, I just came out of my house. I came here to pick herbs today…” The young man started from the beginning.

Ye Qingtang felt rather exasperated but out of rest respect, she had no choice but to brace herself and listen to the youth drone on about what had happened earlier in the morning.

“After I went up the mountain, I saw an Emperor-level practitioner being killed by an Immortal Emperor. That Immortal Emperor looks very similar to you. Also, that Emperor said… that the matter regarding the Temple of Paragon had nothing to do with him. He called the Immortal Emperor the

Paragon and begged her to spare his life… or something like that…” The young man fell into deep thought. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed.

“Temple of Paragon… Paragon?”

Ye Qingtang was in disbelief. Ye Qingtang was very familiar with the Temple of Paragon, but how could there be one here? Was it a coincidence, or… did the Ancient God Karma Tunnel send her back?

“This is the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain?” Ye Qingtang blurted out as she looked at the youth.

“Mixed Heavens Holy Domain?” The young man looked at Ye Qingtang with a strange gaze and shook his head. “Sister Qingtang, how can this be the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain? This is the Divine Venerate Domain. The Mixed Heavens Holy Domain you mentioned is the Second Domain.”

“Divine Venerate Domain?”

Ye Qingtang was even more shocked. In other words, after she entered the Ancient God Karma Tunnel, she had been teleported back and sent to the Third Domain?!

However, Ye Qingtang quickly realized that something was wrong.

The young man said that the Immortal Emperor just now had the same appearance as her. Furthermore, she was the Paragon of the Temple of Paragon

However, the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon had died a long time ago. Why would she appear in the Third Domain?

“Sister Qingtang, you must not speak nonsense about the Immortal Emperor. If you’re not careful, you might bring about a fatal calamity. If you didn’t save me just now, I wouldn’t have told you so much,” the young man said carefully to Ye Qingtang.

“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“By the way, Sister Qingtang, you’re not from the Divine Venerate Domain, are you? I think you look like someone from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain… In recent years, many cultivators from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain have barged into the Divine Venerate Domain. They all want to make a name

for themselves here. Unfortunately, it’s very difficult because the experts from the Divine Venerate Domain are too powerful. It’s not easy even for natives like us to survive here.” The youth stared at Ye Qingtang and sighed.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, the young man continued, “Sister Qingtang, over the past few days, someone is petitioning to conferred the title of Third Emperor. He is called Han Cangming or something like that. He’s very powerful.”
