Chapter 2281: Moving Up (2)

“Sigh… I say, am I missing Boss too much? Somehow, I feel that tree looks like him.” Lei Yan rubbed his chin.

The corners of Nangong Lie’s lips twitched. “You’ve gone mad. Now, whatever you look at will appear like… damn! Boss! You really?are?back!”

The teenagers had been grumbling amongst themselves. And now, Ye Qing had really returned.

“Boss…” Mu Ziying stood up and looked at Ye Qing and the rims of her eyes turned red.

“What’s the matter? Did those brats bully you when I was away?” Ye Qingtang did not try to hide her preferential treatment toward girls. She caressed Mu Ziying’s head.

“Hey! Little Senior Sister, don’t say things that aren’t true. We didn’t do anything to you…” Lei Yan immediately tried to defend himself.

Who didn’t know that Mu Ziying was Boss’ precious baby? Who would dare to bully her?

“Boss, you’re finally back. If you still hadn’t returned, Lei Yan would start seeing you in every object.” Nangong Lie wisely changed the subject.

Standing by the side, Jing Ze, Yun Chen and Qin Feng all heaved a sigh of relief on seeing Ye Qing’s return. They were not like those two bubbly, extroverted boys and mostly kept their emotions to themselves.

“Shut up. How can you talk badly about me the moment Boss returns? Can you live with yourself?” Lei Yan chided Nangong Lie.

Ye Qingtang’s mood lightened quite a bit on seeing this bunch of noisy brats. But she soon noticed that their powers had increased significantly during her absence. Every single one of them had risen by at least one or two Heaven levels.

Ye Qingtang was astonished by this discovery.

“You lot have been very hardworking during this time.” Ye Qingtang was pleased.

“Of course. Boss, while you were away this entire month, we’ve been training non-stop.” Lei Yan reported smugly, just waiting for Ye Qing to praise him.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

“A month? I’ve been away a whole month?”

Inside the secret room, Ye Qingtang was immersed in her cultivation and didn’t feel the passage of time. She thought that she had only been in the secret room for a few days, but…

“That’s right, Boss. You were away for a whole month.” Yun Chen nodded.

Ye Qingtang looked slightly bewildered.

She didn’t expect to have lingered in the secret room for an entire month.

Yun Chen and Qin Feng were the most sensitive and they sensed that Ye Qing seemed to be unaware just how long he had been away.

Meanwhile, the simple-minded Lei Yan and Nangong Lie did not notice anything amiss. Now that Ye Qing had returned, all they wanted to do was to show him how much they had progressed over the past month.

Rising by one to two Heaven levels in a month was something they had never even dared to imagine. All of them had been enrolled in the Netherworld Academy for at least a year. But their powers had not seen much improvement. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Now, after being under Ye Qing for only a short period of time, their powers had progressed so significantly.

It was not difficult to understand why those teenagers were practically worshipping Ye Qing like a god.

Ye Qingtang looked on as they exhibited their powers. She didn’t appear surprised.

In reality, Lei Yan and the rest were blessed with pretty good innate talents. Otherwise, with their previous powers and cultivation attitudes, they would have already been kicked out of the Netherworld Academy a long time ago. The academy wouldn’t have waited so long to do so.
