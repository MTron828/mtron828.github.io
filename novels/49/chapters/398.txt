Chapter 399: Think Highly Of You (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The blacksmiths lost their breaths instantly.

Why was the incharge muddled today?! He was actually allowing her to play around?

Ye Qingtang’s eyeballs moved after hearing the incharge. Her ultimate goal of coming to Xuanling Sect was to enter the mystic realm and obtain the Black Heaven Water.

In the inner sect, only the best disciples had the qualifications to enter the mystic realm. To be selected, disciples required the nomination of an inner sect elder on top of being highly-skilled. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang did not have much interaction with the inner sect elders, and if she really wanted to enter the mystic realm, she must obtain the nomination of an inner sect elder.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang was naturally glad to have this chance to come into contact with Elder Mo.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang replied.

“I am willing to give it a try.”

The elderly laughed in satisfaction and then gave a look to Elder Mo.

Elder Mo could tell that the elderly and the incharge thought highly of Ye Qingtang. With both of them echoing each other, it was clear that they wanted him to accept this girl.

Elder Mo still had reservations about Ye Qingtang’s forging skills. After remaining silent for a while, he finally handed the brocade box that was over one meter long to Ye Qingtang.

“This is the Tower Sky Sword. It broke a long time ago.”

Tower Sky Sword?

Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly raised. She received the box and opened it. Indeed, there was a broken sword lying in the box quietly.

It was not difficult to repair a broken sword, but the sword body of the Tower Sky Sword was not straight and flat as ordinary swords. Thus, repairing it would not be easy. Otherwise, Elder Mo would not have been unable to repair it after dragging on for so long and even have no choice but to request the Sword Spirit Workshop to forge the Remnant Ice Sword.

“Can you repair it?” the elderly looked at the Tower Sky Sword and asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang flashed a smile. “There shouldn’t be any problem.”

Ye Qingtang’s words caused the blacksmiths to have an indifferent expression.

Wasn’t this girl talking too big?

Elder Mo had brought the Tower Sky Sword over many times, but even their incharge did not have the confidence to repair the sword perfectly. Yet this young girl dared to talk big and say there was no problem?

Perhaps she saw that this sword belonged to Elder Mo, so she was so hurried to curry favor with him?

Such a person who was eager for quick success and instant benefits really displeased them.

Elder Mo, similarly, had some suspicions to Ye Qingtang’s assured reply but never expressed it and merely waited for Ye Qingtang’s next step quietly.

Ye Qingtang did not babble and placed the box on the anvil. There were many materials in the Sword Spirit Workshop today, and she naturally made the most out of them. The sword was Elder Mo’s anyway, and so she used materials in the workshop lavishly without going soft.

The blacksmiths watched Ye Qingtang move large quantities of materials over and were so anxious that their eyeballs almost popped out.

What exactly is this girl doing? Don’t fool around if you aren’t adept at forging alright!

The blacksmiths beat their chests and stamped their feet, frustrated that they could not go up to stop Ye Qingtang from fooling around. However, the incharge was already standing beside the elderly and watching her intently. Thus, the blacksmiths could only hold their tongues.

All of them thought that the incharge was not in his right mind today to actually let a disciple who only had little knowledge in forging to fool around here.

Ye Qingtang completely ignored the knives-like stares of the blacksmiths as she melted the materials and started hammering.
