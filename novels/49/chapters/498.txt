“Around there.” The Blood Moon Elder replied unpleasantly.

After getting the confirmation, Ye Qingtang rolled her eyes, and her lips tilted. She had thought of a bold plan.

“Where is the headquarter of the Blood Moon Sect?” Ye Qingtang chuckled and came near to the Blood Moon Elder.

“Why did you ask?” The Blood Moon Elder frowned as he could sense her intentions.

“I have a plan.” Ye Qingtang explained her thought softly by his ear.

The Blood Moon Elder’s pupils contracted upon hearing her plan. He could not believe what he just heard.

“How is my plan?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“You… Ye Qingtang, you’re daydreaming! How dare you disguise as the Blood Moon Guardian and deceive the members to join the fight against Yunxiao Sect?!”

“What? You don’t want the Bonded Soul Pill anymore?” Ye Qingtang’s face darkened.

“This… This is not the problem about the Bonded Soul Pill. It is too risky. The position of the Blood Moon Guardian is just below the sect master… How can you just easily disguise as a guardian…” the Blood Moon Elder said. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Ha… You are such a coward.” Ye Qingtang shook her head and laughed coldly.

“Ye Qingtang! Who did you call a coward?!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted in anger.

“What? Did I say anything wrong? Was Yunxiao Sect not part of the sects that terminated the Blood Moon Sect back then? Even one of your Blood Moon Sect elders also surrendered to the Yunxiao Sect. You don’t even feel humiliated?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“You…” The Blood Moon Elder’s face was gloomy as if Ye Qingtang mentioned his weak spot.

“If you’re angry, release your anger on the Yunxiao Sect. What’s the point of arguing with me here? Are all the people of the Blood Moon Sect cowards? No wonder you failed thousands of years ago.” Ye Qingtang sighed, and her face was filled with disappointment.

“Nonsense! Who dares to call himself the king when the Blood Moon Lord was present?!” the Blood Moon Elder said and waved his sleeves.

“Ha… True heroes do not mention their past. Furthermore, what’s the point of telling me who the king is? Tell Yunxiao Sect then.” Ye Qingtang sneered.

Ye Qingtang’s words did make the Blood Moon Elder feel slightly angry.

When the Blood Moon Sect was in control of the world, everyone had to pay respects to them back then. What was Yunxiao Sect even!

“Since you’re not willing to cooperate with me, then you can stay at the Xuanling Sect and wait for the Yunxiao Sect to kill you,” Ye Qingtang said.

Ye Qingtang seemed to be serious with her words. If the Blood Moon Elder did not agree with her, he might really be involved in the fight and die miserably.

“Ye Qingtang, I can only bring you to the sect division.” The Blood Moon Elder could not help but compromise eventually.

At the Blood Moon Sect’s peak, there were one hundred and eight branches and thirty-six divisions. The peak influence and power disappeared along with the fall of the Blood Moon Sect.

Now, the Blood Moon Elder could only bring Ye Qingtang to one of the divisions.

“So, you agreed?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“I don’t want to wait for my death here. It’s not bad if you can teach the Yunxiao Sect a lesson. Then, the bonded soul pill…” the Blood Moon Elder said.

“Relax, if you cooperate, I will refine the Bonded Soul Pill soon.” Ye Qingtang gave her promise.

…

Ye Qingtang left the Xuanling Sect secretly with the Blood Moon Elder after a short while.

The nearest Blood Moon Sect Division was at a remote place in the North.

Before heading to the Blood Moon Sect Division, Ye Qingtang brought the Blood Moon Elder to Yunxiao Sect’s territory.
