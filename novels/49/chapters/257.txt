“Even such a young child can acquire such power after entering the inner sect. That is really amazing,” Dai Changming said.

“Though he is young, he must possess a high-quality spirit root. If not, his age does not meet the requirements to enter the inner sect. I think he is accepted by the inner sect Elders as an exception since his spirit root is superior…” Zhou Qu sighed in awe and looked towards Ye Qingtang, who remained silent throughout. He purposely stressed the words when he mentioned the spirit root.

Dai Changming nodded in agreement.

“The inner sect selection will be held in a month’s time. Senior Brother Dai, you are strong enough to enter the inner sect and will have the chance to level up,” Zhou Qu said.

Dai Changming was expressionless. The inner sect examination was extremely strict. It was not that easy to pass.

However…

The move that was done by the youth from the Wind Moon Sect’s inner sect did shock everyone there. They were still immersed in astonishment after a while.

Inner sect disciples…

This was the target of millions of outer sect disciples.

Only after you entered the inner sect, you would gain access and be exposed to the unimaginable power.

Ye Qingtang stared at the back view of the two disciples with a heavy heart.

This was the ability of inner sect disciples.

Ye You was at an even higher status than inner sect disciples.

If she did not hurry, the distance between her and Ye You would be greater.

She must get the opportunity to join the inner sect examination in a month’s time!

After some adjustments, Dai Changming and the group rushed towards Deer City through the path. Many disciples could not help but raise their heads to see the sky through the narrow gap between mountains.

They had no idea when they could acquire such power.

However…

It was extremely difficult to enter the inner sect.

While thinking of such thoughts, the group hurried on. The path created by the two young men saved quite a lot of time for Ye Qingtang and the team.

The group figured out that both they and the Wind Moon Sect disciples were heading towards the same destination through the chat between the two young men. Though no one mentioned that, everyone knew that if they really encountered them again, they could only back off. Their abilities added up would still not able to be compared with the youth’s one move.

Dai Changming also slowed down the pace.

After half a day, the sky darkened, and they saw the city that connected the desert and the plains away from them by just a few hundred meters.

The size of Deer City was not huge. The sand blown by the wind from the desert covered the entire city. The city was dimmed under the dust. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qin Huan wanted to say something, but once he opened his mouth, the sand went in. He could only keep his mouth shut.

“The sand and the wind is too strong. We will hurry and enter the city. Once we enter, find a place to rest. We’ll start the investigation tomorrow morning.” Dai Changming frowned.

No one had any objections, and they rushed towards Deer City.

When they entered, the tall walls blocked off the sand and the wind. Everyone then sighed in relief.

Ye Qingtang shook off the sand on her clothes and came down from the horse with the rest.

Dai Changming was planning to find a place to rest. However, after he wiped off the dust on his face, he realized…

There was not a single person on the street of Deer City!
