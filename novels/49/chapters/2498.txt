Ye Qingtang glanced at the Flying Star Academy teacher and said, “When I accidentally used the Space Technique before, I was brought to this place and found the exit there.”

“Why didn’t Teacher Ye leave then?” Lu Yuanxiang looked strangely at her. Why did she choose not to leave if she knew where the exit was?

Hearing his words, Ye Qingtang smiled gently and said, “Would you still be able to see this exit if I had left?”

They were all rendered speechless.

Ye Qing knew where the exit was but did not leave for the sole reason that he wanted to leave this god-forsaken place together.

The Flying Star Academy teacher chuckled. “Well, I did say that Teacher Ye was a great person. Even in such dire circumstances, he was thinking of us …Since Teacher Ye says that this is the exit, what are we still waiting for? Let’s go!” he said.

“Boss… thank you, ” Mu Ziying said softly after a moment.

She knew that Ye Qing could have left whenever he wanted but didn’t do so because of them.

“Let’s go. We’ll talk more when we’re out,” Ye Qingtang said as she smiled at Mu Ziying.

They quickly reached the edge of the Ice Ocean.

They could feel the might of the ice all around them. Ye Qingtang would never have been able to see that this was an illusion if she didn’t already know it was.

“What a strong illusion… it’s so realistic that e can’t even see it clearly for what it is. How strange.” Qin Feng frowned as he looked at his surroundings.

“I can’t see it clearly as well,” the Blood Moon Elder said softly.

Regarding the Blood Moon Elder, they already knew that he was Ye Qing’s friend. They also knew that the Yongle Tribe General had the power to recover souls, and they had used their status as ancestors to make him bring the Blood Moon Elder back to life. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Hm, the people who set up this illusion must have been extraordinary. It is something we cannot even fathom,” said Lu Yuanxiang.

Even Ye Qingtang was feeling the same way.

The person behind the Wailing Well possessed great power and was not comparable to ordinary people at all. As for what his motives were, Ye Qingtang did not know them and had no intention of finding out.

“Once we are out of this place, we have to make sure to investigate everyone and find out more about those behind this! Universe City must have some connection to this!” The Flying Star Academy was extremely angry. This was a great embarrassment to the universities.

“Let’s leave this place first. Let me go first.” Qin Feng kept his sword and took big steps forward. Under their gaze, he entered the Ice Ocean and a faint light enveloped him.

“It really is the exit, ” the Flying Star Academy teacher said excitedly.

With that, he followed Qin Feng into the Ice Ocean.

At the same time, in the space above the Wailing Well…

An elder holding a golden book suddenly opened his eyes and his sharp gaze swept downwards.

“So they’re still alive…” he said as his eyes flashed coldly.

“What’s the matter? I felt it just now that they should all be dead… how could there still be people alive? It’s impossible,” another elder from afar said with a frown..
