The crowd all felt that the young man was here to find trouble. However, it was unlucky for him to meet Chu Yi, who had a weapon made of real black gold meteoric iron here.

“Master Du, the brother here is still young. I believe that he did not purposely offend you.” Chu Yi looked at Master Du and explained nicely. It seemed that he was helping Ye Qingtang, but his words assured that Ye Qingtang was a liar.

Chu Yi then smiled and looked towards Ye Qingtang. “Young brother, I understand that you are still immature, but you should not be rude towards Master Du. Leave now and don’t create any more trouble.”

Create more trouble?

Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly. Chu Yi had said everything for her and played the role as a good man.

Ye Qingtang did not plan to explain anything. However, since someone wanted to use her to bring himself up, she was not so kind to be a stepping stone.

“Young Sir Chu?” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

“Yes.” Chu Yi nodded slightly.

“You said that your sword is made of black gold meteoric iron?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“That’s right.”

“I heard that the black gold meteoric iron is strong and unbreakable. Since you feel that my dagger is fake, how about using your sword to compete with my dagger?” Ye Qingtang smiled and said.

Chu Yi frowned slightly. He took a glance at Master Du and noticed that Master Du was deep in thought. He then smiled and said, “Young brother, since you insist, I agree. However… my weapon is extremely tough as it’s made of black gold meteoric iron. If your dagger can not take it and gets damaged…”

“If it gets damaged, I will not say anything. But if your sword is broken…”

“I will not complain about anything as it’s an honor to help Master Du to prove the authenticity of the sword.” Chu Yi smiled as he was very confident with his sword.

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang nodded and took back her dagger from Master Du.

“Please, Young Sir Chu.”

Chu Yi smiled. He lifted his sword and split down towards Ye Qingtang’s dagger.

Everyone’s sight was fixed on Chu Yi and Ye Qingtang. Even Master Du was also contemplating.

“Master, that dagger…” Du Sheng wanted to say something.

Master Du shook his head and said, “We shall see first.”

Du Sheng then kept quiet.

Chu Yi lifted his sword high up and split down at the dagger. When the two weapons clashed, a loud clatter followed.

As the clatter was heard, a cold gleam suddenly shot out from the point of collision!

Everyone was stunned at that moment.

Chu Yi, who was holding the sword extremely confidently, suddenly froze.

The black sword in his hand that was made of black gold meteoric iron was broken into half, and the dagger was still intact in Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“It seems like your sword is not that tough…” Ye Qingtang raised her eyes and smiled at the shocked Chu Yi.

The confidence on his face was replaced by astonishment. He gazed at the broken sword in his hand, and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

“How is it possible…” Chu Yi could not believe that his sword was broken.
