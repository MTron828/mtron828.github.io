Chapter 103: Illusion Array (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The real assessment began after the spirit root test. Based on the inverted order which people completed the Path to Heaven, Ye Qingtang would be the last person to go.

The middle-aged man who was in charge of the assessment led everyone to a place outside the courtyard. The courtyard was peculiar as it was built on top of cloud layers. Multiple Eight Trigrams flags served as walls that surrounded the courtyard. The flags were four meters in height and stuck closely together. The view inside was totally covered up.

The middle-aged man placed his hands back and stared at the candidates. All candidates then stopped chatting and remained silent.

“This is an illusion array. All candidates are required to enter the array one by one.”

“Illusion array?”

Various discussions arose among the candidates after the middle-aged man’s words. No one knew what this illusion array was, but they were all clear that as a sect assessment, it would not be easy to pass.

“Senior, do we need to break the array in order to pass the assessment?” One of the candidates asked, and that was what the rest were curious of.

The middle-aged man shook his head.

“It would be best if you can break the array. If you can’t, we shall see the situation in the array.”

Do not need to break the array?

Everyone became even more curious about the illusion array in front of them.

The middle-aged man asked a disciple behind him to distribute wax balls to candidates.

“There will be combat inside the array. Nothing inside will threaten your life. If you cannot take it anymore, just crush the wax ball, and the illusion array will disperse. You can then leave the array. However, I have to warn you now. The moment you crush the wax ball, the assessment comes to an end. The timing you crush the wax ball and the length of time you can stay in the array will be taken into consideration for the assessment.” He said.

Combat?

The key information in the middle-aged man’s words was clearly captured by the candidates. Though he mentioned combat, their life would not be threatened. Furthermore, it was mentioned earlier that they did not need to break the array. It seemed like this assessment was just to test how long they could last in the array.

Everyone was not that nervous after figuring out the rules.

Even if they could not break the array, they just needed to spend more time in the array. It would not be very difficult.

Based on the inverted order which people completed the Path to Heaven, a young man would be the first person to enter the illusion array.

The young man was around 18 to 19 years old. He was tall and possessed an orange spirit root.

He did not perform very well on the Path to Heaven, so he was well-prepared now to earn some attention in the array.

“Are you ready to enter the array?” The middle-aged man looked at the excited young man and asked in a deep voice.

The young man nodded without any hesitation.

The middle-aged man raised his hand, and a path emerged from the closely arranged Eight Trigrams flags. The path was covered entirely by fog, and no one could see the view inside clearly.

“Enter.” A command was given.

The young man then walked towards the illusion array. His giant body disappeared from view after he stepped into the fog. The Eight Trigrams flags assembled back and enclosed the entire array. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I think that young man will be inside for quite a while. The longer you stay inside, the better it is. Even if you can’t break the array, you can also drag out time inside.” One of the candidates murmured.

“That’s true. It’ll take at least two to three days to assess the hundreds of us.”

Ye Qingtang stood at a corner and scanned through the rest of the candidates. She smiled slightly when she noticed how the rest felt relieved towards the illusion array.

When was it ever easy to pass a sect assessment?
