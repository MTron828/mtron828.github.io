Chapter 1990: Netherworld Ring (3)

“You want to create your own Netherworld Ring,” Ling Yan said with realization.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“I was wondering how I could stir things up between the Ancient You Clan and the Crimson League before, but now I have an idea,” she said with a smile.

“You’re planning to let word out that the Ancient You Clan has stolen the Netherworld Ring?”

Ye Qingtang wasn’t surprised at all that Ling Yan had managed to guess her plan. He was extraordinarily intelligent and could easily think of the same plan that she had. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“That’s right, the real Netherworld Ring is in the hands of the Holy Lord of Shadows. Since the Crimson League is demanding it of me, I’ll make them a fake one. But it can never land in their hands, so I’ll let out word about the location of the Netherworld Ring, and the fact that I’m going to move it elsewhere...”

“And you’re going to cause some damage to the Ancient You Clan with Ming Di before this?” Ling Yan took the words right out of her mouth.

“That’s right. I’ll make sure to make it unbearable for them but won’t push them to their limits.” Ye Qingtang loved speaking with Ling Yan. He understood everything she was thinking of. It was undeniably relaxing to speak with one she didn’t have to explain anything to.

“Once the dissatisfaction the Ancient You Clan has towards the Temple of Shadows increases, they will want to make some trouble for us without attacking directly. Miss Ye, you’re going to be killing two birds with one stone. It’s a great plan.” Ling Yan looked at her with admiration.

She didn’t notice his smile at all and only asked him to quickly draw the ring out.

“It’s not hard for me to draw it out, but there are some things that we can’t let people from the outside find out. The Undead Clan within the Temple of Shadows is one of them and we should hide them. Why not let me help you make a fake Netherworld Ring?” Ling Yan said.

“You can do that?” Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows slightly.

“I know a little.”

Ye Qingtang had faith in him since he had suggested this himself.

To avoid any more unnecessary ramifications, she let Ling Yan create the fake Netherworld Ring in her own room. Because of this, he went in and out of her room more often and was pale and sweating profusely every time he left.

All this was seen by Xue Fu and the rest but they interpreted it far differently

Even the eight tribe leaders who didn’t particularly like Ling Yan patted his shoulder in sympathy after seeing him.

As Ling Yan was busy creating the fake Netherworld Ring, Ye Qingtang brought Ming Di around the Central Mainland to attack the Ancient You Clan.

She didn’t dare attack them when they were in groups. But when they had first started slaughtering the different Ancient Clans, they had sent out many young people to do the job. So she attacked them together with Ming Di and wiped them out without much effort at all.

As she always left before they could get word out and send for reinforcements, the Ancient You Clan’s army always missed them.

This angered the Ancient You Clan so much that they were this close to declaring war on the Temple of Shadows.

“Elder, the Temple of Shadows is too much. We let them go that time but this is the fifth time they are attacking us. The Holy Lord of Shadows and Ming Di have been foiling our plans. Elder, are we just going to sit still and endure it?” One of the wardens fumed as he heard the report.
