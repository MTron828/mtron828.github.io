Everyone was in high spirits after receiving the Xi Spirit Pills and wanted to use the pills to further improve themselves in their cultivation.

Just when the new disciples were preparing to leave, a bustling noise suddenly came from the side of the public square.

A group of outer sect disciples were gathered together and having a jolly time.

That lively scene attracted the group of disciples who just entered the outer sect of Xuanling Sect, and many headed in that direction out of curiosity.

In the crowd, there was a ten-square-meter empty space in the center of the crowd, where a tall outer sect disciple stood imposingly.

From the surrounding people’s discussions, the new disciples finally understood what was going on.

The person standing in the middle of the crowd was called Zhou Qu. He had been in the outer sect for two to three years, and although his skills were not top-notch, he was ranked in the top one thousand people amongst over three thousand people in the outer sect.

Now, Zhou Qu was standing there to set up an arena.

Malicious fighting was completely banned in sects. Infighting amongst disciples in the same sect was all the more disallowed; otherwise, they would receive extremely strict punishments.

The arena was the only place where disciples could exchange blows with each other openly, though it was to be of a suitable degree and could not be overly extreme.

The way Zhou Qu started an arena was very interesting. He challenged the outer sect disciples ranked in the last two thousand places, and both parties would bet with Xi Spirit Pills where the winning party could obtain the pills.

Everyone was aware of how precious the Xi Spirit Pills were, and once the new disciples heard that the arena actually used the Xi Spirit Pills as a bet, they were instantly interested.

However, they were not fools.

No matter what, Zhou Qu had been a disciple in the sect for two to three years, and there was no comparability between them, the newly joined disciples, and him.

“We don’t have much to do with this arena. How can we possibly beat Senior Brother Zhou?” A new disciple sighed rather disappointingly. Although there was the Xi Spirit Pill as bait, they were still self-aware.

That new disciple’s lament traveled into Zhou Qu’s ears, and Zhou Qu laughed. “This Junior Brother over here, I’m afraid you’re mistaken. I don’t require you to beat me on this arena. As long as you all can withstand three of my moves, I will gift you all a bottle of Xi Spirit Pill. If you can withstand six moves, I will gift you two bottles.”

With these words, those new disciples who previously dropped the idea suddenly had a glimmer of hope.

If they really had to fight with Zhou Qu, they would definitely not be able to win. However, if they only had to receive his three moves… why not give it a try?

Many thoughts ran across everyone’s mind. Xi Spirit Pills were precious, and although they obtained two bottles, it was definitely a case of “the more the better.” Immediately, the group of new disciples was a little swayed.

Their reactions fell into Zhou Qu’s eyes, and a cold scoff emerged in his eyes.

Upon seeing the excited expression of the junior brothers and sisters, the old outer sect disciples from aside could not help but quietly shake their heads.

Someone might just be baited again.

Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu were about to leave but were attracted over by the noise.

A sneer hung on the corner of Ye Qingtang’s lips when she saw Zhou Qu’s face.

Rather, it was Yun Shu who was interested in the arena.

“You can obtain a bottle of Xi Spirit Pill as long as you receive three moves? This arena is pretty interesting,” Yun Shu chuckled.
