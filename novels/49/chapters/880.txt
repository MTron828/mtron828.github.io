Chapter 881 Precious and Current Life (1)

“I have signed a contract with Ling Yan.”

The little azure dragon totally sold Ling Yan out.

“Ling Yan…”

A trace of surprise appeared in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. How did he manage to sign a contract with an azure dragon when he did not even have any martial ability?

“The azure dragons worship intelligence more than power,” the little azure dragon said.

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the little azure dragon.

“Ling Yan is my good friend. His will be mine…” Ye Qingtang was not willing to let go of the little azure dragon.

“I’m not involved in this okay. You should know that I did not say or do anything. In the future, when you see my clan and yours, don’t mention anything. If not, I’ll beat you to death!” The little white tiger tried to pull itself out of the situation here.

Before the little azure dragon could say anything, Ye Qingtang added. “I’m intelligent as well.”

“It will be enough.” The little azure dragon pointed at the little white tiger with its claw and said.

Ye Qingtang looked towards the little white tiger, and she had mixed feelings…

She sighed and said, “Ling Yan asked me to look for the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. Forget about the contract then… I think that Ling Yan is good enough…”

Since the little azure dragon had signed a contract with Ling Yan, she did not need to care about this anymore.

“Let’s go!”

The little azure dragon struggled to free itself from Ye Qingtang’s arms and walked forward.

The little azure dragon led Ye Qingtang to a giant divine tree after three days.

There was a narrow path a few miles behind the divine tree. The Wintry Yin aura was getting more intense.

“The divine Puti Tree? I did not expect there to be a holy tree at this place.” The little azure dragon was slightly stunned.

Ye Qingtang was also surprised and said, “I heard that the divine Puti tree can show your previous and current lives…” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Just a rumor.”

The little azure dragon shook its head.

Ye Qingtang was attracted by the divine tree’s aura.

Suddenly, a strange luster exploded out of the divine tree, and Ye Qingtang was surrounded inside the luster.

The next second, Ye Qingtang saw herself being chased by millions of people in her previous life in disbelief.

At the last moment of her previous life, Ye Qingtang crushed the Heart of the Demon God. She did not want anyone to have it even if she had to sacrifice her life.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply as her life was replayed.

However, a man in white appeared slowly.

“Found it.”

His pleasant and deep voice was covered by the wind. The man slowly squatted down and touched the bloody wound gently using his long and elegant fingers. Wisps of breaths were emerging continuously from Ye Qingtang’s wound and slowly into the man’s palm. The breaths then formed a translucent heart.

When the heart was about to condense into the solid form, the breaths suddenly dispersed. The heart that was about to condense dispersed into particles, scattering around the body of Ye Qingtang.

A trace of blackish green light sparkled in the man’s deep eyes.” I see…”

The man’s finger pointed at the area between Ye Qingtang’s brows the next second. A streak of golden light diffused into the area softly…

When the golden light diffused into Ye Qingtang’s glabella, her breathless body suddenly radiated golden rays of lusters and slowly faded in the wind.

As the golden light disappeared, the man lifted his head slowly. His dark green eyes seemed to be able to see through everything.

Soon, the man raised his right arm, and the endless power of karma surrounded the place.

“I found about everything too late in this life… Go back. This time I’ll prepare everything and wait for you…” The man murmured to himself and left a mark on his own karmic natal chart.
