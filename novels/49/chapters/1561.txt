Chapter 1562 An Obvious Extortion 1

Jiang Yu nodded slightly. You Qiong glanced at Ye Qingtang but did not say anything.Anyway, he was staying here for free, and Jiang Yu usually just ignored him.

“What else do you want to say?” Jiang Yu noticed that Ye Qingtang seemed to have something else on her mind.

“I have something that I want to ask you, Domain Monarch Founder,” Ye Qingtang said obediently. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“What is that?” Jiang Yu said.

“I heard from the other disciples in the Taiyuan Valley that we can get honor points from contributions to the Jiang Family?” Ye Qingtang said slowly.

“That’s right.” Jiang Yu nodded. The honor point system was a rule he set with the inner sect elders when he first became the Domain Monarch. It was used to motivate the young generation to work harder and always prioritize the family.

“What is considered as a contribution to the Jiang Family?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

“Anything that honors our family. For example, saving our family people, joining battles... You don’t need to rush all these since you just entered here. When your ability improves and you make contributions, there will be honor points awarded,” Jiang Yu said righteously.

A smile flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes, but she still appeared to be very curious on her face.

“Save someone in the family?”

Jiang Yu nodded.

Ye Qingtang smiled, “Then I can get the honor points now?”

Jiang Yu was slightly stunned, but You Qiong laughed secretly at the side.

“Now?” Jiang Yu was confused. What did she do for her to get the honor points when she just entered the Taiyuan Valley?

“Who did you save?”

“You.” Ye Qingtang showed an innocent expression.

“...” Jiang Yu’s expression darkened instantly.

How could he forget about this!

“I happened to save you in the Land of Infinite Demons, Domain Monarch Founder. I didn’t expect that I could still get some honor points. Please prove that for me.” Ye Qingtang smiled and said.

Jiang Yu’s expression darkened further when he heard that Ye Qingtang wanted to use this incident to exchange for honor points; furthermore, he still needed to publicly vouch that she saved him.

Ye Qingtang was the only one in the Jiang Family who knew about how he was trapped in the Land of Infinite Demons. No one else knew that his abilities were gone. He did not want others to know that the majestic Domain Monarch Founder in the past had become a child with no power.

How would he dare to meet others in the future if everyone knew about that?

Jiang Yu’s serious and righteous expression was gone, and now he looked even grimmer.

“No.” He refused directly.

“Why is that so?” Ye Qingtang was confused. It appeared that she did not know Jiang Yu’s concern here.

Jiang Yu wanted to vomit blood, but he could not ruin his prestige in front of one of his descendants. He said with a steady and deep voice, “Things that happened at the Land of Infinite Demons were of a big scale and related to the god. It will cause more trouble if others know about that. Furthermore, you have seen so many powerful figures in the appearance of a child. The influence will be bad for you as they do not want their prestige to be destroyed here.”

“I’m not afraid of that. I just want the honor points to level up. This is also a way to appreciate the effort you spent to bring me into the Elder Cabinet. I believe that the powerful figures must be very generous in order for them to reach that stage.” Ye Qingtang pretended to not understand the meaning behind Jiang Yu’s words and instead praised him.
