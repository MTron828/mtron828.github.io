Chapter 1152: Pagoda Sword Master (1)

“This is the girl who destroyed Sky Stars City and Wind Cloud City,” You Ming, the other black-robed man, said. His remaining eye fell on Ye Qingtang.

Behind the two generals were many powerful cultivators from the Ancient You Clan. Most of them were at the level of Yang Lord.

“Ah ah, this old man is quite powerful, and his skills are comparable to mine. Also, Elder Yin Fo tried to kill me and seize my generalship. I was attacked from all sides just now,” the golden-robed man said laughingly.

When he heard that, the green-robed man, You Tong, looked at the Ultimate Elder.

In an instant, You Tong’s eyes turned blood-red. His pupils slowly turned as if they contained everything in the universe.

With just one look, Ultimate Elder shuddered.

“Illusion?!”

When she saw what was happening, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed. This green-robed man’s eyes belonged to some bloodline and were extremely terrifying! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“He is under my control… However, this old man has great mental strength… General You Jin, I cannot last for long. Go and kill him,” said the green-robed man, You Tong.

When he heard that, the golden-robed man’s lips curled slightly upwards. The frightening lotus-shaped Extraordinary Flame surfaced in his hand, and he threw it at the Ultimate Elder’s brow.

“This is bad…”

Ye Qingtang immediately used her mutated Extraordinary Flame. Her entire body was instantly filled with black flames, and she was poised to rescue the Ultimate Elder.

However, before Ye Qingtang could act, they heard a swooshing noise. Thousands of sword glints fell like rain from the void.

At that moment, there was a surge of sword breath, and sword silhouettes could be seen everywhere. The entire area seemed to turn into a country of swords.

The golden-robed man was blasted by the sword glints and forced back by a few dozen steps.

A golden sword glint surfaced in the void.

The golden-robed man narrowed his eyes when he saw the golden sword glint.

The golden sword glint rapidly transformed into an old man in a cotton robe.

“Humph!”

When the old man saw the Ultimate Elder, he grunted loudly. The Ultimate Elder immediately opened his eyes.

“We haven’t met for a long time. You’re getting weaker.” The old man looked at the Ultimate Elder and said coldly.

“You…” When he saw the old man, the Ultimate Elder looked rather surprised. “Pagoda Sword Master…”

When she heard that, Ye Qingtang was also taken aback. Legend had it that this old man was the most powerful cultivator in this mainland… but he had left many years ago… Pagoda Sword Master…

Legend had it that the Pagoda Sword Master had become renowned when he was young. He had defeated all the powerful cultivators in this mainland. The Ultimate Elder and the Blood Moon Holy Lord had cooperated to fight the Pagoda Sword Master, but they had also lost…

Of course, the Blood Moon Holy Lord was only the spiritual incarnation of the Heavenly Emperor and not the Heavenly Emperor himself. No matter how powerful the Pagoda Sword Master was, there was probably still a gap between him and an especially strong cultivator like the Heavenly Emperor.

Of course, Ye Qingtang did not know how powerful the Pagoda Sword Master currently was.

“Everyone, please show me some respect and leave this mainland.” The Pagoda Sword Master swept a glance at the golden-robed old man and the three generals as he spoke.

“I’m afraid you don’t deserve such respect.” The green-robed man, You Tong, laughed coldly.

“We are the Ancient You Clan. We want to exterminate this mainland and take away something that belongs to our clan… But how about this, if you are willing to join the Ancient You Clan, we will let you live,” The golden-robed man said.

“In that case, more words are futile. Let us fight.” As the Pagoda Sword Master spoke, two frightening beams of sword breath burst forth from his eyes and swept towards the group from the Ancient You Clan.
