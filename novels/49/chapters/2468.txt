The Flying Star Academy teacher and Lu Yuanxiang were familiar with the powder. Powders like True Dreams were of no use to martial arts practitioners like them. They had seen many elixirs that could cause hallucinations, and could easily guard against them.

However, according to what Ye Qing had said, the demons in this realm did not seem to know much about elixirs. At most, they had some knowledge about natural herbs. Therefore, they would not suspect or guard against elixirs that they had never seen or even heard of.

A moment later, Lu Yuanxiang said, “That’s a good idea. It might work if we use the unknown to deceive those demons.”

“Yun Chen, go and refine some True Dreams. No need to refine too many.” Ye Qingtang instructed Yun Chen, who was standing nearby.

Yun Chen nodded. “Boss, there’s no need to refine. I have some here.”

“In that case, let’s leave this place now,” said the Flying Star Academy teacher.

Their bodies were imprinted with tracking marks and they did not know when those demons would find them. The most important thing now was to carry out Ye Qing’s plan as soon as possible.

“Teacher Ye Qing, what should we do next?” Lu Yuanxiang asked Ye Qing. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Although Ye Qing’s plan might work, Ye Qing had yet to explain how exactly to trick those demons. Surely he could not possibly scatter the medicinal powder directly on their faces of the Yongle Tribe demons.

“Those sculptures,” Ye Qingtang said.

In this realm, it was common knowledge that the Yongle Tribe had a custom to worship the statue of Demon Emperor Yongle every day.

Back then, it was precisely because the West Sea Tribe had desecrated Demon Emperor Yongle’s sculpture that they had formed a deep enmity with the Yongle Tribe.

The reason why Yun Chen did not need to prepare too much medicinal powder was also because there were not many demons who would go and pay their respects. Only the high-ranking members of the tribe did that and only a few from that group would pay their respects every day.

As long as they could trick the high-ranking members, everything would be fine.

“Ye Qing, do you know where the sculptures worshiped by the Yongle Tribe are?” The Flying Star Academy teacher asked.

In fact, Ye Qingtang was not too sure about the exact location. However, when she was in the Eastern Faction, she had once seen the high-ranking members of the Yongle Tribe walking towards a certain area with a large flag. One of the more powerful demons in the Eastern Faction told her that it was the daily pilgrimage of the Yongle Tribe.

“I only know the general direction. But with Ziying around, it shouldn’t be a problem.” Ye Qingtang looked at Mu Ziying and smiled.

…

A moment later, Ye Qingtang brought Lu Yuanxiang, the Flying Star Academy teacher and the rest to the territory of the Yongle Tribe.

“Ziying, use your puppet… to find the place,” Ye Qingtang said.

Hearing that, Mu Ziying nodded slightly and a few scouting puppets flew in all directions. Mu Ziying closed her eyes and sensed everything that the puppets encountered.

“So she is a Puppet Master.” The Flying Star Academy teacher sized up Mu Ziying with a surprised expression.

About 15 minutes later, Mu Ziying opened her eyes again and looked at Ye Qingtang excitedly. “Boss, I found it!”

“Damn! Let’s hurry over now!” said Nangong Lie.

“Tell me about the situation first,” Ye Qingtang replied steadily.
