Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang’s breath almost stopped under such an outrageous aura. She felt that her heart was held by an invisible hand.

“Such terrifying aura…” Ye Qingtang’s face was filled with astonishment. She looked towards the mausoleum and wondered who the horrifying person inside was.

At that moment, the elder sneered and said, “Finally, you can’t bear with it anymore? You want to escape now?”

A cold humph came out of the mausoleum at the same time.

A streak of silver light rushed out of the mausoleum and flew away.

The elder’s eyes sparkled as he saw the silver light. He laughed scornfully. “Want to escape?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The elder did not bother to look at Ye Qingtang, and a cyan sword flew from his waist.

The elder stepped onto the sword and flew into the clouds.

The horse’s stiff body slightly relaxed after an hour. It was so frightened, and it howled. Ye Qingtang could only use her primordial qi to comfort it.

Ye Qingtang frowned. The silver shadow that flew out from the mausoleum had an extremely terrifying aura, and the elder who seemed to be an ordinary person was surprisingly a strong person…

No wonder the elder did not allow her to walk through the mausoleum and asked her to make a detour.

Ye Qingtang stared at the mausoleum and immersed herself in deep thought. Though the elder had left with the silver shadow, Ye Qingtang still decided to make a detour. The intense aura had yet dispersed from the mausoleum, and her horse definitely could not walk through.

After a while, Ye Qingtang rode the horse and detoured.

…

Ye Qingtang sat on the horse, and her hand was holding a space ring.

She acquired the space ring from Yue Tiancheng after the assassination.

There was great primordial power sealed inside the space ring. Besides Yue Tiancheng, it was difficult for others to access it.

During the two days. Ye Qingtang used her own primordial qi to erode Yue Tiancheng’s primordial power.

After a while, joy filled her eyes.

“That’s it…”

Ye Qingtang murmured, and her face was filled with joy.

Though Yue Tiancheng’s primordial qi was strong, Ye Qingtang’s primordial qi was affected by the Ultimate Origin Skill and had some kind of mutation. It was mixed with a flame aura that could destroy and erode Yue Tiancheng’s space ring.

After neutralizing the sealing power, Ye Qingtang immediately looked into the space ring.

Yue Tiancheng’s space ring contained a black sword and some random stuff.

“Just a sword?” Ye Qingtang frowned.

She thought that as the Yunxiao Sect disciple, he must have stored some precious stuff inside the space ring.

She did not expect there to be only one weapon inside.

Ye Qingtang took out the black sword.

When she held the sword in her hand, the coldness she felt was like pure ice.

“The quality is still okay…” Ye Qingtang contemplated for a while. The sword’s quality was even higher than her Demonic Blood Sword.

Martial weapon’s quality was classified with Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow grades.

The Heaven-grade was the strongest divine weapons. The Earth-grade was slightly lower. The Black-grade was the spirit weapons, and the Yellow-grade was the most inferior ones.

In most of the sects, the Xuanling Sect for example, the outer sect disciples’ weapons were ordinary weapons. Yellow-grade weapons were considered rare, and Ye Qingtang’s Demonic Blood Sword belonged to the Yellow-grade.
