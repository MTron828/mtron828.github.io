Chapter 1079 Ten Thousand Years

“Old Valley Master of the Falling Sky Valley… what’s the relationship between you and the extraordinary lady?” Ye Qingtang stared at the old Valley Master and contemplated.

“The extraordinary lady?” The old Valley Master was slightly stunned after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words.

“The extraordinary lady who used her Spiritual Abode to create this mainland,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

The old Valley Master was taken aback and stared at Ye Qingtang in surprise.

After a while, the old Valley Master said, “How did you know about that?”

“You don’t need to know about that.” Ye Qingtang replied coldly.

The old Valley Master’s response proved that Ye Qingtang’s guess was correct. The old Valley Master must be related to the extraordinary lady who created the mainland.

“You know quite a lot based on your age. The extraordinary lady you mentioned… was regarded as a God by us. After she came to the mainland, she led us to the magnificent martial civilization… She used her own Spiritual Abode to create the land for us…”

The elder was immersed in deep thought as if he had returned to that age.

“However, things did not go well… Her divine power was used up as she lost her Spiritual Abode… However, without her divine power, she still enjoyed our worship and respect… She really treated herself as a God… How funny was that hahaha…” The old Valley Master’s expression was getting a little insane.

Ye Qingtang was slightly stunned after hearing his explanation. The extraordinary lady had passed away around ten thousand years ago. According to the old Valley Master’s words, it seemed that he lived in the same age as the extraordinary lady and had even served her before…

Perfected Xuanchen and the rest all froze, stunned. None of them could understand the conversation between the old Valley Master and Ye Qingtang… Who was the extraordinary lady, what Spiritual Abode, God were they talking about…

Ye Qingtang looked at the old Valley Master coldly and said, “The extraordinary lady had passed away for around ten thousand years. It seemed that you lived in the same age as her.”“Hahaha… Young girl, you’re very clever. No wonder you can become a Yang Lord at your age… I have lived for more than ten thousand years… I was the first Sect Master of Yunxiao Sect, and I created the Falling Sky Valley. I always change my identity every few hundred or thousand years.”

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed slightly as well after the old Valley Master finished his words.

The person in front of her… really had lived for ten thousand years!

“What a pity… there isn’t enough spirit energy on this mainland. Furthermore, the extraordinary lady you mentioned used her remaining divine power as a curse to build the Dimension Wall after she passed away. The Dimension Wall could shield any outsiders and also prevent us from leaving this mainland… If not, I believe some of us would have become Emperor-level figures…” The old Valley Master sighed softly and helplessly.

Ye Qingtang did not know about the curse from the little white tiger.

Even the little white tiger might not know about that.

The old Valley Master was right. If it was not due to the power of the curse that prevented the group of ancient people from leaving the mainland, they all had the chance to become Emperor-level figures after living for ten thousand years…

“You… How did you manage to live so long…” Ye Qingtang frowned and asked.
