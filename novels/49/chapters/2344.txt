Chapter 2345: Swollen Face (2)

Di Nuo was not anxious to make his move. After all, with Ye Qing’s powers, he could kill him in one move.

“You really like to talk a lot.” Ye Qingtang stared impassively at Di Nuo.

Di Nuo’s face stiffened.

“Make your move and stop wasting time. I still have to compete with Zhu Ning after this match ends.”

If anything, Ye Qing’s words enraged Di Nuo.

The surrounding students widened their eyes.

“This Ye Qing is so bold! Or is he just a fool? Does he really think that after this match Di Nuo, he will still be able to walk off this platform?”

Seeing that Ye Qing was so eager to die, Di Nuo narrowed his eyes and unleashed his powerful Divine Lord stage aura.

“So powerful!” The crowd couldn’t resist gasping.

Qin Feng’s expression darkened. Ran Mo was also a Divine Lord Second Heaven level, but he was only at the early stage and Di Nuo was at the peak. With Di Nuo’s powers, even if they all joined forces to fight him, they would still not be a match for Di Nuo. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Qin Feng quietly clenched his fists as he paid close attention to everything that happened on the platform. He was prepared to dash up at the crucial moment to rescue Ye Qing.

The same idea had simultaneously appeared in the minds of Jing Ze and the others.

They didn’t care about the academy rules and didn’t care about who they offended. They were already prepared to charge up the platform the moment Ye Qing was in danger and then flee with him from the Netherworld Academy.

Ye Qingtang stared coldly at Di Nuo, whose aura was surging wildly. Still she remained unmoving.

Di Nuo was unsurprised at Ye Qing’s lack of reaction. Suppressed by a Divine Lord level aura, it was only natural that a Paragon Sixth Heaven level practitioner could not move.

In the next second, Di Nuo morphed into a golden light and he charged toward Ye Qing.

Qin Feng and the rest were extremely tense.

Just as Di Nuo was approaching Ye Qing, he suddenly lifted his eyes and parted his lips. Then he uttered a single word.

“Retreat.”

The word was spoken lightly but the moment the word left his lips…

Di Nuo felt a buzzing numbness spread across his mind. In the next instant, it was like he had been sent flying across the air by an invisible force!

Crash!

Du Nuo landed heavily on the platform.

Meanwhile, Ye Qing remained standing there, completely unharmed. Apart from his lips, he had not moved a single inch of his body.

“What happened?”

Everyone was stupefied by what they had just witnessed.

Di Nuo had made his move. Shouldn’t Ye Qing have been killed within seconds?

Why…

Was Di Nuo the one who was sent flying instead?

Qin Feng and the others were also dumbstruck. They were all prepared to rush up and had already taken one step forward before they all halted in their tracks.

What happened?

How did Di Nuo end up flying through the air?

Collapsed on the ground, Di Nuo felt like he was being completely covered by an invisible force.

Shock flashed across his eyes. He had no idea what happened.

“Get up.” Ye Qing’s voice rang out again. Following that calm voice, Di Nuo was suddenly lifted into the air by that invisible force.

It was spine-chillingly strange.

“Damn, could there be a ghost?!” Someone exclaimed.

Just as the crowd was feeling very befuddled, Ye Qing crossed his hands behind his back and strolled over to where Di Nuo was being suspended mid-air.
