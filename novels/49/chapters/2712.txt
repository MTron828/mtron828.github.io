Chapter 2713: Wealthy (4)

Furthermore, most of those demons moved in groups. Very few were alone. If they were to challenge a group of demons, there would only be one outcome—complete annihilation. There were too many of them.

“Senior Brother Lan Shan, we can’t buy three supreme relics.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“That’s right. The price of a Paragon relic is 100,000 cursed points. Didn’t I make myself clear just now?” Xie Jun nodded.

“We can only buy two now,” Ye Qingtang continued.

Xie Jun. “…”

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, how many cursed points do you have?” Xie Jun looked at Ye Qingtang in surprise.

Although Ye Qingtang was currently at the top of the ranking list for cursed points, the ranking did not show the exact number of cursed points she had.

“I originally had 300,000 but now I have only 290,000 left,” Ye Qingtang replied honestly.

“290,000?” Xie Jun was shocked. “Junior Sister Ye Yue… where did you get so many cursed points?”

“It was blown in by the wind,” Ye Qingtang answered after some thought.

Everyone, “…”

Ye Qingtang was not afraid of the Great Immortal Temple disciples knowing how many cursed points she had. Firstly, Ye Qingtang trusted them. Secondly, they belonged to the same faction. To snatch cursed points, one had to belong to different factions. Therefore, there was no need for Ye Qingtang to hide anything from them.

“290,000. We will have to spend 100,000 to purchase the Paragon Relic, leaving us with 190,000…with 190,000, we can purchase a Destruction-level divine weapon from a high-tier ancient city. It won’t matter even if we die, we can use cursed points to revive ourselves too. One life only costs 1,000 cursed points!” said Xie Jun.

“It means that as long as Junior Sister Ye Yue doesn’t die, we can revive indefinitely.” Zhang Chi appeared to be in deep thought.

“Everyone, you are overthinking things.” Another disciple sneered as he gently wiped his six Heaven-level divine weapons. “Even if I want to die, these six Heaven-level divine weapons of mine… they won’t allow it!”

The corners of Xie Jun’s lips twitched as he looked at this person’s six Heaven-level divine weapons.

It seemed that it was really not easy for them to die.

“It’s here. I watched Xie Jun from the Great Immortal Temple enter this ancient city.”

A clear voice suddenly sounded.

“Heh, Ye Yue from the Great Immortal Temple is now ranked first in terms of cursed points. Kill her and snatch her points.” A light laugh rang out.

Hearing the commotion, Lan Shan and the others rushed out of the shop.

At this moment, more than 20 disciples from the other supreme factions descended from the sky.

“Heavenly Saint Cult?” Lan Shan glanced at Xie Jun. “You brought back a tail?”

Xie Jun shrugged. “It was a mistake. I didn’t notice. My bad.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After a while, more than 20 people from the Heavenly Saint Cult were outside the shop now. Ye Qingtang stood in front and scanned the crowd coldly before she said calmly, “May I know why you are looking for me?”

A Heavenly Saint Cult disciple shouted coldly, “Ye Yue, we are here to kill you and take away your cursed points!”

“Nonsense!” The long-haired leader glared at the person who spoke.

“Huh?” The person who spoke was stunned. Wasn’t that so?

“What do you mean by stealing cursed points… it is clearly because Ye Yue killed a disciple of our Heavenly Saint Cult after entering this realm. We’re here to take revenge…” The long-haired man claimed.
