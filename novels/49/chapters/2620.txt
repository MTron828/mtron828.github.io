Chapter 2621: Fighting the Skies (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Calamity of Wrath was a natural calamity to prevent the Immortal Emperor level practitioners from becoming even stronger. They would become legends if they were able to overcome it but they would die if they failed.

“So it is the Calamity of Wrath,”

Ye Qingtang’s expression was grave. Even though she had never witnessed the power of the Calamity of Wrath before, she had heard many stories about it.

It was said that none of them had ever escaped the Calamity of Wrath before.

For most of them, once they rose to the level of Immortal Emperor, they would forcefully suppress their powers to make sure they did not continue getting stronger so that they would not trigger the Calamity of Wrath.

But the Heavenly Emperor obviously did not care for these things and had no intention of suppressing his powers at all. If he had been more careful and suppressed his strength, the Calamity of Wrath would not be here now.

This… is this the Calamity of Wrath?”

Above the void, the Heavenly Emperor’s silver hair flew in the wind as his cold, emotionless eyes shut slightly. He stood with his hands behind his back as though he was basking in the presence of the Calamity of Wrath.

“Fighting with the skies… interesting,” he murmured.

In the next second, a beam of snow-white light appeared from his body and pierced through the skies.

‘Mad… he’s mad!”

The Feng Family Patriarch was pale as his entire body trembled and cold sweat peppered his forehead. He said in utter shock, “The Heavenly Emperor… he wants to… fight the skies!”

Ye Qingtang’s face filled with surprise as she heard that.

Once the Immortal Emperor level practitioners reached a certain level and tried to obtain more power from the skies and earth, they would attract the natural calamity out to destroy them, which was the Calamity of Wrath.

Yet at this moment, not only did the Heavenly Emperor show no signs of stopping at all, he was still absorbing a huge amount of power from the skies, which seemed to anger the skies even more.

“How… how arrogant!”

Everyone was stunned.

There had never been an Immortal Emperor level practitioner who did not care about the skies at all before. The Heavenly Emperor was probably the only one!

At this moment, the Heavenly Emperor was surrounded by white and he looked like a demonic god that cared about nothing. He seemed to feel nothing in the face of the skies. What a powerful spirit!

“Boom… ”

The sound of thunder and rage reverberated through the skies. This force made those in the Feng family turn pale as Feng Jiuyou, Feng Wuyin, and a few other younger Divine Lord level practitioners fell to the ground.

Ye Qingtang could feel her body shaking. The power obtained from absorbing the demon blood in her was released in an instant.

In the next second, her eyes and hair turned white.

“This is…”

She frowned.

Just one roar from the skies made the great Dao power within her feel so threatened and filled her with such power…

But she calmed down as power entered her body. She wasn’t going to be this shaken after hearing the roar again. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Lady… Lady Ye, are you alright? What’s happening?”.
