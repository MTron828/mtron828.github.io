Chapter 2394: Wailing Well (3)

The person’s tone was casual but there was an undertone of sarcasm and his words attracted the attention of a few others.

Staking everything on one bet or just one final desperate attempt to survive?

The other academies did not really care. After all, they had personally witnessed Netherworld Academy’s decline, and no longer treated them as worthy competition.

“Yin Kongluo’s team has just entered the Wailing Well,” someone pointed out as another screen appeared in the hall.

Jin Qianyang had indeed just led Yin Kongluo and his team into the Wailing Well. But their surroundings looked different from where Ye Qingtang and her team arrived.

There was only one portal entrance to the Wailing Well. But after entering, no one could predict where in the Wailing Well they would land. At this point, everyone’s attention was focused on the elite teams from the Heaven Dome Academy and other top academies.

Everyone was well aware that the winner would probably be one of those elite teams. The rest were just along for the ride.

…

It was dark, cold and gloomy inside the Wailing Well. This kind of setting was the perfect environment for hidden dangers.

Ye Qingtang led Lei Yan and the others further in, carefully analyzing her surroundings.

“Boss, are we going to hunt some demons now?” Lei Yan rubbed his fists together, itching to fight. The others were likewise prepared for battle.

But Ye Qing only replied, “No hurry.”

“What?” They were stunned.

Song Yanhan couldn’t help shaking his head discreetly at Ye Qing’s answer.

They only had a limited amount of time inside. About 50-60 teams had entered the Wailing Well before them and those teams were probably already killing demons now.

Meanwhile, Ye Qing was not at all anxious. How could they hope to win against the other teams in 10 days with this kind of laid-back attitude?

Ye Qingtang didn’t say anything else. Instead, she observed her surroundings. It was dark and murky but she could see quite several unfamiliar vegetation growing in the gloom. She didn’t lead her team onward but turned to a patch of vegetation at the side. Bending down, she picked up a nondescript-looking plant.

Lei Yan and the others couldn’t understand what Ye Qing was doing. They just stood foolishly by the side.

Taking a few steps forward, Ye Qing picked several more plants before turning around.

“Explore this area. If you see these plants, pick all of them and bring them back to me.”

“Boss? You want us to pick plants? But… shouldn’t we hunt for some demons first?” Lei Yan was bewildered and his eyebrows furrowed.

“If you don’t wish to die from blood loss during the battles, do as I say.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Lei Yan was still puzzled, but Song Yanhan and Yun Chen immediately understood.

Ye Qing was holding plants which were all herbs required to refine elixirs. To think that he was able to find these herbs in the darkness within such a short period of time. As they could not bring any elixirs with them, if they met with danger and incurred injuries, they would not have any medicine to help them.

“Boss, you want us to refine elixirs first?” Yun Chen guessed at Ye Qing’s plan.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

She had observed their surroundings and saw that it was relatively safe for now. When entering an unfamiliar place, the most important thing was to move in a calm and steady manner.

These brats usually had plenty of elixirs in their space rings and so they didn’t know how frightening it was to not have any during critical moments.

During a crisis, a single elixir could mean the difference between life and death.
