Puff!

Puff!

Ye Qingtang’s shocking aura crashed directly on Chu Yi and his junior brother, and they were hurled several meters away. Both of them fell on the ground heavily and puked blood.

“Half… Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord…” Chu Yi crawled up from the ground with a pale complexion. At this instant, there no longer was any arrogance on his face as before. He widened his eyes at the young man in white in disbelief as astonishment filled his eyes.

Didn’t the aura that suddenly erupted belong to a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?

Chu Yi would never have dreamed that this refined and pretty young man would actually be a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!!

“Senior… Senior Brother Chu… She… She is a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?!” That youth was completely flustered. They originally thought that their target was an ordinary young man, but unexpectedly…

She was actually a domineering half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

Given their cultivation levels, how could they contend against such a powerful figure?!

“Run!!” All color had long been drained from Chu Yi’s face. He never thought that the person he belittled would actually be a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. If he knew that from the start, he would not have dared to offend her no matter how bold he was.

However…

It was already too late for them to escape now.

Ye Qingtang was not one who would let these two off easily. She lifted her legs slightly and shuttled to the front of those two people. She raised her hand and slapped the back of those two youths’ head.

Blood spattered out instantly all over Chu Yi’s face.

Chu Yi felt as if he was soaked in ice water, and his whole body shuddered. Looking at his junior brother’s dead body right before him, Chu Yi’s legs wobbled, and he fell on the icy ground with a thud.

“You… You cannot kill me… My… My master is a Tiangang Sect Elder… If you kill me, my master and Tiangang Sect will not take it lying down…” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang looked at Chu Yi coldly without a trace of warmth in her eyes.

Let him go?

If she let him go him, that was when Tiangang Sect would not let her off, wasn’t it?

Ye Qingtang did not wish to say any more things to Chu Yi. She took a few steps forward to Chu Yi with aura already condensed in her hands.

After seeing Ye Qingtang’s murderous intent, Chu Yi gasped and tore a talisman that he had been holding in his hands previously.

A ball of light suddenly shone. Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes and faintly saw Chu Yi attempting to flee when the light ray appeared. A murderous intent emerged in her eyes, and she leapt towards Chu Yi.

Chu Yi fled at top speed, not daring to remain any longer.

A silver shadow suddenly flashed by in front of Chu Yi, who felt an excruciating pain in his throat before crashing on the ground before he was able to see what that silver shadow was.

Ye Qingtang, who chased over, was surprised to find Chu Yi on the ground and paused in her tracks. When she saw the silver shadow that suddenly appeared, delight filled her heart.

“Xiao Guai?” Ye Qingtang widened her eyes as she looked at the silver wolf who stood in front of Chu Yi majestically.

The silver wolf that disappeared for a long time suddenly appeared before Ye Qingtang in a domineering and impressive manner as when it left. A bright trace of blood could be faintly seen on the silver wolf’s front paws.
