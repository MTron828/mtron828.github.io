Chapter 2263: Treasure Trove (4)

“There are many treasures here but don’t you all feel that it’s too quiet in here?” Ye Qing asked after looking at the confused faces of those teenagers.

“Boss… what do you mean?” Qin Feng asked.

Ye Qing surveyed the surroundings. “There are dangers everywhere in the fiendcelestial’s tomb. It’s illogical for the place where the treasures are stored to be so safe. If I am not wrong, this is the most dangerous place in the tomb…

“Every single one of these treasures might trigger a trap. I am afraid that if any one of us touches a single thing here, we won’t be able to leave this tomb.”

Ye Qing’s words brought a sliver of common sense back to those deliriously tempted teenagers. At this moment, they realized that it was truly too quiet in here.

No evil demons, no undead mermaids, no illusions…

It was like all these treasures had been laid out nicely before them, for them to choose at will.

At this point, Qin Feng and the rest couldn’t help feeling relieved. Luckily they had been too overwhelmed by the choices and didn’t immediately reach out to take an item. Otherwise, who knew what kind of trouble they would invite.

“Can see, but cannot touch… this feeling… is so…” Lei Yan held his face as his heart ached.

Ye Qingtang turned to look at the Night Soul Beast. The Night Soul Beast guiltily averted its eyes, trying to pretend as if nothing happened. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The hints of a smile flashed past Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Originally she hadn’t been sure if there were any dangers hidden within this treasure trove, but the actions of the Night Soul Beast triggered her suspicions.

The Night Soul Beast had been forced to sign a contract with her. The contract stipulated that the Night Soul Beast couldn’t harm her, but it had been reluctant to sign this contract. It probably hoped that she would die as soon as possible, so that the contract would become void.

What a pity that it couldn’t harm her itself. That was why it had carried out those actions.

Observing the Night Soul Beast’s reactions, Ye Qingtang confirmed that the treasures inside this place could not be touched. It was probably a one-way road to hell for whoever took anything.

“Let’s leave this place first.” Ye Qingtang looked away. After knowing the thoughts of the Night Soul Beast, she did not want to stay too long at this place.

Lei Yan and the others were just teenagers and had little worldly experience. Their way of thinking was also more pure and naive. If they continued to linger in this treasure-filled place, who knew if they would be tempted to do something disastrous.

Leading the group, Ye Qingtang sped past those treasures. The treasures were piled as high as mountains, their dazzling sparkle lighting up the entire space.

Ye Qingtang was constantly alert to any movements in the surroundings. When she focused, she seemed to hear some faint tinkling sounds coming from some of the further treasure piles.

The sound was very faint. As if something was crawling under those piles of treasures.

The thing hidden amongst the jewels seemed to be circling Ye Qingtang and her group from a distance. And that faint noise was continuous, echoing subtly around the entire place.

A sense of unease rose in Ye Qingtang’s heart. She needed to find the exit as soon as possible.

“What is that?”

Mu Ziying’s voice suddenly rang out from behind.

Mu Ziying’s body was too weak so Jing Ze was carrying her. As a result, her line of sight was also higher now.

Now, Mu Ziying had widened her large eyes, staring at one end of the treasure trove.

Ye Qingtang followed Mu Ziying’s line of sight and saw a huge skeleton standing upon a mound of treasure!
