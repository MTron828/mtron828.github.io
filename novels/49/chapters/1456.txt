Mo Yi passed the medicine gourd to her servant and smiled. “It’s a problem from the bloodline. It’s nothing much. I was initially still worried that you followed my bloodline, but now, it seems that you followed your father. This is good as well… Although people with my bloodline are powerful, there are many drawbacks. It is great that you have the Heavenly Demon Bloodline variant.”

Bloodline drawbacks?

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback.

Everyone knew about the power of the Ancient Dynasty, but their downfall was a mystery.

Could it be… related to this bloodline?

Mo Yi did not seem to intend to talk about her bloodline. Meeting her daughter after over ten years, Mo Yi did have many things to talk to Ye Qingtang about, and Ye Qingtang calmed down to feel the momentary familial comfort.

Mo Yi was overjoyed that her lost daughter returned to her, but there was one person in the Jiang Family who was infuriated.

Jiang Shun’s firm features seemed to be ripping apart from hatred as he looked at Jiang Yiming, who was laying in bed breathlessly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Jiang Liu, Jiang Qin, and her husband and others were present in the room.

“How’s Yiming’s injury?” Jiang Liu took a look at Jiang Shun’s somber expression and then at the physician beside them.

That physician’s forehead had a layer of cold sweat as he replied anxiously. “Young Master Yiming’s… injuries are very severe… His arteries are damaged. Although… Although his life is saved… I’m afraid… all his cultivation will…”

Jiang Liu was shocked by what the physician said.

Jiang Yiming is crippled?

Ye Xun, who was standing aside, shivered as he looked at the lifeless Jiang Yiming. Jiang Yiming was a Heavenly Venerate, but Mo Yi actually crippled him with one move.

She was standing right behind Jiang Yiming then, and if Mo Yi’s attack landed on her…

She would have died at the scene!

“Sister You…” Ye Xun tugged Ye You’s sleeves.

Ye You looked down with an ashamed expression. “It’s all my fault. If Brother Yiming did not vent anger for me, he would not confront Ye Qingtang and all the more not cause Ye Qingtang to be resentful and incite her mother to hurt Brother Yiming.”

Then, Ye You took a step forward and kneeled before Jiang Shun.

“Uncle, it’s all my fault. I did Brother Yiming wrong.”

Jiang Shun had a gloomy expression and did not speak.

Jiang Qin was tearful at the sight and hurriedly helped Ye You up.

“You, this has nothing to do with you. It’s Mo Yi and her daughter who are evil.” Jiang Qin looked at Jiang Shun and said, “Eldest brother, Yiming is your only son. Now that he is harmed to this state because of Mo Yi and her daughter, you must definitely avenge him!”

“It’s all my fault. I did not notice and protect Yiming.” Jiang Liu was extremely vexed at this instant.

Jiang Shun was the eldest son of the Domain Monarch. He had been the acting Family Master during the Domain Monarch’s seclusion and had an extremely high status in the Jiang Family. Jiang Yiming was his only son.

“Eldest brother…” Seeing that Jiang Shun did not reply, Jiang Qin wanted to say something more, but he suddenly raised his hand and smashed the wall with his palm.

“Where is Mo Yi at now?” Jiang Shun had a sinister and murderous gaze.

Jiang Qin was delighted and replied immediately. “She is in the west garden right now.”

Expressionless, Jiang Shun turned around and walked out of the door. Jiang Qin and the rest noticed and immediately followed.

“Eldest brother, Mo Yi is too arrogant. Her cultivation technique is unusual. I will come with you.” Jiang Qin had her own plans. Mo Yi’s cultivation techniques were unusual, but no matter what, she was on her own. Now that Jiang Lang was not around and the Domain Monarch was in seclusion, it was the best time to get rid of Mo Yi and Ye Qingtang.
