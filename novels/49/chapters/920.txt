Chapter 921 Faced With Beauty (2)

“What business is it of yours!” Yin Yang Child said coldly as he looked at the youth in black armor.

The youth in black armor was stunned. He was just about to speak when at the same moment, the Divine Phoenix said, “No matter. I’ll tell you. The next test is lust.”

“Lust?”

When they heard the Divine Phoenix’s words, everyone exchanged glances. What did that mean?! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“To be precise, it is temptation. Your temptation will be actively produced by what you have seen and heard,” the Divine Phoenix said.

Realization dawned after they heard the Divine Phoenix’s words.

“Divine Phoenix, we will certainly be prepared now that you have revealed it… no matter how tempted we feel, we cannot possibly be moved… So, what is the purpose of the next stage’s test?” A middle-aged man was puzzled. The Divine Phoenix had not given them any hints in the previous stages. Why was it suddenly being so agreeable now?

They were not stupid. Since they knew it was a test and that the situation was obviously created by the Divine Phoenix, they would not fall into the trap.

The Divine Phoenix only calmly shook its head in response to the middle-aged man’s doubts. “This time, I will strip you of your ability to think rationally. You will not think that it is a test. I want to observe your instincts.”

Strip them of their ability to think rationally?

What did that mean?

Could it be that… the Divine Phoenix was so powerful it could control their thinking?!!

Everyone was shocked, but they had no time for further consideration.

As the Divine Phoenix spoke, complete silence fell on the valley.

As they entered a trance, a dense fog descended…

Yin Yang Child stood in the black fog. A delicate fragrance seemed to linger in his surroundings.

Beside him stood a girl of stunning beauty. Her clothes were in disarray, and her eyes exuded tenderness.

Yin Yang Child looked rather puzzled. He did not know where he was or what he was doing

His mind was blank and completely devoid of former memories.

He looked at this girl of stunning beauty. He did not know where she had popped out from.

“Come…”

A voice that was so soft it sank into his bones, slowly rang out. The stunningly beautiful girl narrowed her lovely eyes slightly and waved at Yin Yang Child with her right hand. Her hand was so soft, it was almost boneless.

This careless action seemed to contain all kinds of flirtatious expressions. Her fluid glances seemed to encompass all that was beautiful in this world.

Yin Yang Child looked at the girl of unparalleled beauty before him. He was not moved at all. Instead, he frowned and shouted coldly,

“Whose maid is this? Get lost, don’t hold up my cultivation!”

Yin Yang Child did not know where he was or why he was here. Only the path of pursuing power he had always pursued remained buried deep in his heart.

So what if he was faced with beauty?

Yin Yang Child was only thirteen or fourteen. What did he know of love between a man and a woman?

He was intent only on hastening his cultivation and upgrading himself as fast as possible so that he could press his sworn enemy, Black and White Holy Son, to the ground and pound him with a hammer.

At the same time, not just Yin Yang Child, but Black and White Holy Son, the youth in black armor, Absolute Monarch of Heaven, and the twenty over men and women present, including Ye Qingtang, were all in the same situation. They had all sunken into the same state. They had forgotten the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, forgotten the Dragon Vein, forgotten everything.

The dense fog dissipated a little.

A faint light shone.

Ye Qingtang looked around. Before her was the interior of a dimly lit room.

This was…

Before Ye Qingtang could think clearly, she suddenly sensed a trace of a strange aura coming from behind her.
