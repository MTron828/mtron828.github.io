Chapter 2231: Mental Demons (2)

“Teacher, please explain it to me.” Qin Feng requested in a solemn voice.

“Do you know why after you came to me, I didn’t teach you any skills? Instead, I had you go and plant flowers?”

Qin Feng shook his head.

Ye Qing replied simply, “Because of mental demons.”

Qin Feng was taken aback. A sliver of embarrassment flashed across his face as if he was sheepish about being found out.

“The Killer Bloodline is very powerful but it is a bloodline with very potent killer characteristics. It can bring you unfathomable power but it can also bring you unshakeable mental demons...” Ye Qing continued.

In the beginning, when the Qin family first became famous, the Killer Bloodline had been put on a pedestal. But after several decades of great repute, the family suddenly declined. Thereafter, although the family produced quite a number of strong practitioners, most of them died young.

No one knew the reason behind this. After the decline of the powerful practitioner from the Qin family’s first generation, the Qin Zhuo’s status in the Second Domain became increasingly lower. In the end, after being subdued for thousands of years, they finally produced Qin Zhuo, who led the Qin family to the peak again.

But after Qin Zhuo’s death, the Qin family was unable to find another powerful practitioner to continue his legacy.

“The moment mental demons appear, there are only two endings. The first is to forever be tormented by the mental demons and have one’s lifespan shortened. The second is to experience a major decline in your practice and powers.” Ye Qing explained.

“I don’t know how much you know about the Killer Bloodline. But if I am not wrong, your ancestors should have already found out that the Killer Bloodline can result in mental demons. And so they implemented some changes and altered your situation so that your lifespan wouldn’t be shortened by mental demons. However, this also resulted in the possibility that you will find it difficult to progress to higher levels. The watershed line should be at the Divine Lord stage.”

In her previous life a hundred years into the future, the Qin family was completely ruined and disappeared from the world. Ye Qingtang just happened to have heard someone mention that it was due to the Qin family’s Killer Bloodline.

The Killer Bloodline was a double-edged sword. The more powerful it was, the higher the chances of you developing mental demons. The consequences included death after descending into complete madness or an absolute mental breakdown.

The Qin family ancestors must have been afraid of the Qin family being eliminated by the Killer Bloodline, and so implemented some changes.

“But Qin Zhuo...” Qin Feng said with uncertainty.

“Qin Zhuo was an exception. His willpower was much stronger than your usual person. Only someone with enough determination can restrain the mental demons.” Ye Qing explained. In the Cursed land, even in his withered state, Qin Zhuo was still able to maintain his nature. This was definitely not something that ordinary people could do.

“So... Teacher Ye, you had me plant flowers to cultivate my willpower, to decrease the killer aura in my body?” Qin Zhuo asked.

Ye Qing nodded.

“If you can control your mental demons, you can become the second Qin Zhuo. You can even... surpass him and become the most powerful practitioner in the Qin family.”

The words made Qin Feng’s eyes flash. Without saying another word, he turned and left.

Ye Qing suddenly spoke up again. “If you can subdue your mental demons, I will give you a present.”

A present which should have been returned to the Qin family.

Ye Qingtang had not forgotten Qin Zhuo’s request. But she hoped that the person who inherited the sword would not tarnish Qin Zhuo’s great name.

Qin Feng was taken aback. He looked at Ye Qing with an increasingly conflicted expression. He had only known about mental demons not long ago. He looked at Ye Qing in confusion. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Why did Ye Qingtang know so much about the Qin family bloodline? Even more so than him, a descendant of the Qin family?
