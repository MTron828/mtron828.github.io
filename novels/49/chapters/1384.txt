1385 Exposing the Fraud 1

The Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom humphed and exhaled freely as he finally regained his reputation.

Ye Qingtang did not bother with Emperor Qi and the rest’s apology. She looked towards the half-closed jade door.

“It seems like I misjudged you. Please do not take it seriously, Immortal Su. Many people in this world tried to challenge the dignity of Immortals. I was playing safe, and that’s why I requested you to prove yourself.” The Immortal in the jade door finally spoke again. After witnessing Ye Qingtang’s ability, he changed his words and attitude.

“Someone bring a chair for Immortal Su. She deserves the highest honor here,” the Immortal said slowly. It seemed that everything that just happened was just a misunderstanding, and he did that in order to protect the Immortal’s dignity.

The Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom was delighted after hearing the Immortal’s words.

The Dragon Court Sect admitted Ye Qingtang’s identity. The Yuan Kingdom could use that to keep in contact with the Dragon Court Sect more often in the future.

Though Ye Qingtang was in the Yuan Kingdom, the Emperor certainly wanted to be close to an Immortal sect like the Dragon Court Sect.

However…

Ye Qingtang scoffed at how calm the Immortal sounded and how he tried to explain himself for what just happened.

“You’re right. No one could challenge the dignity of the Immortals…”

“Yes.” The Immortal agreed.

However, fierceness flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She gently pointed her fingers, and the fire phoenix that was resting by her side suddenly dashed towards a few envoys, who were standing in midair.

No one expected that to happen.

The few envoys just witnessed how the fire phoenix burned so many powerful people into ash. Their faces were pale when they saw it dashing towards them. They jumped down from midair and fell hard onto the ground.

The fire phoenix flapped its wings gently towards the place the envoys were standing just now. Flames spread out instantly in the air.

Flames dropped down and burned along the transparent rope.

“The Dragon Court Sect has challenged the dignity of the Immortals for such a long time. How serious is the offense…” Ye Qingtang stared at the ropes burning ropes, and a smile appeared on her face.

Everyone was stunned when they heard Ye Qingtang’s words. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

What did that mean?

The Dragon Court Sect challenged the dignity of the Immortal?

The envoys who jumped down from midair kept sweating and wanted to run away instinctively. However, Ye Qingtang lifted up her hand and held them up without any contact.

“How dare you say that you’re able to fly in the air?” Ye Qingtang stared at the envoys who were held in the air. She narrowed her eyes and flipped her hand. The envoys were thrown up towards the ceiling of the palace.

“Now, show me how you fly.”

The envoys were pale as none of them really knew how to fly. The moment they were thrown out, they fell to the ground. They felt their bones fracture from the great impact.

The believers in the palace were totally shocked when they saw the envoys hit the ground.

What was happening?

How come the envoys suddenly did not know how to fly?

The person in the jade door sensed something was not right and wanted to escape from the secret path in the jade door.

But any movement in the jade door could be detected by Ye Qingtang.

“Escaping?” Ye Qingtang scoffed. She raised her hand and threw out the little white tiger.
