Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Why is it still too early?” Lu Xiuwen scoffed as he lifted his chin and glanced over at Ye Qingtang with despise.

“Perhaps, someone has no self-awareness and is still struggling hard when death is at hand?”

Ye Qingtang did not bother with Lu Xiuwen’s ridicule anymore and stood there silently, waiting for the moment when the results were released. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

As for Lu Xiuwen, he was unwilling to waste any more saliva on someone with no qualification to enter the sect. After taking a look at her, he stood aside, only wanting to see the moment when Ye Qingtang’s hopes were dashed; Her expression would be so satisfying to watch.

Not long later, the middle-aged man who was in charge of the assessment appeared in front of them once again.

All the candidates trembled and strained their ears, waiting for the revelation of the final results.

“This assessment is finished, and our sect already knows of everyone’s performance. Now, the names that I read out are those who have passed the assessment and have the qualification to become an outer sect disciple of Xuanling Sect,” the middle-aged man said sternly as he looked over the crowd.

Everyone’s eyes were focused on one point. They eagerly hoped to hear their name from the middle-aged man’s mouth.

“Su Wan.” The middle-aged man read the first name.

A beautiful young girl walked out from the many candidates. Delight and agitation were written all over her lovely face. Suppressing all her emotions, she tried hard to remain calm and walked in front of everyone.

From this moment on, she was a disciple of Xuanling Sect!

Many envious gazes landed on her successively, and upon feeling those eyes on her, she took a deep breath and lifted her chin.

The middle-aged man continued, “Mo Yu.”

A handsome young man was the second to walk up. Compared to Su Wan, his expression was relatively calmer, but the agitation in his eyes revealed his inner feelings.

This two people both had a yellow spirit root and were outstanding in the sword array and Invasive Stone assessment. Passing the assessment was not unexpected to others.

As the middle-aged man read out name after name, a group of people amongst all the candidates were in utter despair.

Until then, the middle-aged man had already read out over ten names, but all of them had yellow spirit roots without exception.

Until then, a candidate with an orange spirit root had not appeared, and this made those with an orange spirit root rather disheartened.

The gap in the grade of spirit root really could not be crossed.

Even if their performance was similar, those with yellow spirit roots were prioritized and chosen.

Moreover, just based on performance, almost none of those with an orange spirit root could win against those with a yellow spirit root.

The initially hopeful candidates with orange spirit roots hung their heads low gloomily as the despair in their heart already told them the final outcome.

Xuanling Sect did not need people with such an inferior spirit root like them.

“Lu Xiuwen,” the middle-aged man said again.

Lu Xiuwen, who was prepared long ago, stepped out of the envious crowd with a face full of confidence and not a single hint of agitation.

With his ability, it was to be expected for him to enter the sect.

What he wanted was not just a placement as an outer sect disciple of Xuanling Sect. In the future, he would want even more things.

“Yun Shu.”

Yun Shu walked forward immediately after.

The assessment results for both of them were within the expectations of everyone.

There was nothing surprising about it.

Until then, all the names of the candidates were read out in reverse order. As Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu’s assessment results were revealed, those whose names were not read out completely gave up hope.
