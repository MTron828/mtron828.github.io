Chapter 2721: Five Great Relics (2)

The main goal of these people was the Paragon Relic.

As the group looked on, a golden relic appeared.

“This is the Yin-Yang Relic.” The skeleton continued, “The Yin-Yang Relic has the power of extreme yin and yang. If a warrior consumes it, he can control yin and yang and transform into a Yin Yang Divine Body.”

Everyone was shocked.

Lan Shan said in surprise, “Yin Yang Divine Body… So there really is such a thing!”

Seeing the confusion on the faces of the other disciples, Zhang Chi explained, “The so-called Yin Yang Divine Body can transform Yin into Yang. It is more or less a form of natural power. It is even more terrifying than the forbidden Yin Yang Bloodline.”

“Kid, you are rather knowledgeable.” The skeleton nodded.

Immediately, a third black relic appeared in mid-air.

“This is the Imperishable Relic.” The skeleton explained. “Any living being who consumes this relic will become immortal and not enter the cycle of reincarnation. They will live as long as heaven and earth, but they have to pay a certain price. They will never be able to sense the spiritual energy of heaven and earth again. In other words, if an Immortal Emperor consumes the Imperishable relic, his cultivation will forever be at the Immortal Emperor level. Of course, the benefit is that he will be indestructible. No one will be able to kill a living being who consumed this relic. They can only seal it.”

“Formidable…” Lan Shan was in shock. “There’s actually such a divine item in this world.”

A fourth relic soon appeared. The skeleton continued its narration. “Space-Time Relic.”

“With this relic, you can pass through space-time barriers, return to the past and go to the future. However, you can only use it once,” the skeleton said.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered. Moving through the past and future… This was what she needed. Even if she could only use it once, with this relic, she could return to her era.

“The final relic.” As the skeleton spoke, a fifth relic floated in the air.

“The Perfected Immortal Relic.” The skeleton stated. “Any living being who consumes this relic will immediately become an immortal.”

“Immediately become an immortal?!”

All the disciples at present gasped. Was this for real? Could one really become an immortal after swallowing this?!

“There’s no need to doubt the authenticity of these relics. After all, there’s no need for me to lie to you. These five relics are the ultimate legacies of the Heaven Ascension Sect Master. Of course, to obtain them, you will need sufficient cursed points. If you are good enough, you can buy them all,” the skeleton said.

“Wait.” Xie Jun looked at the skeleton in confusion, “Sir, you didn’t tell me that there were other relics when I first came to this hall.”

The skeleton replied, “That’s because you hurried away before I even finished talking. Besides, can you afford them?”

Xie Jun, “…” He really couldn’t afford them.

“What is the price of these five relics?” Ye Qingtang turned away from the five relics and looked at the skeleton.

The skeleton told her. “Each of these five relics has its own price. The Space-Time Relic costs 40,000 cursed points, the Paragon Relic and Yin-Yang Relic each costs 100,000 points, the Imperishable Relic costs 150,000 cursed points, while the Perfected Immortal Relic costs 200,000.”

Ye Qingtang, “…” It was too expensive. Even though she wanted them all…

Each of these five relics was a rare treasure in this world. Especially the Perfected Immortal Relic. It could allow a person to instantly become immortal. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

At that moment, Ye Qingtang suddenly recalled Tian, whom she had met in the cursed hell.
