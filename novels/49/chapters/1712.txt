Chapter 1713: Alive or Dead (2)

“AHHH!”

Wu Xiao screamed in shock as he slipped and landed with his butt on the ice. Fear flashed across his face.

“What happened?”

“He... his eyes... his eyes just moved.” Wu Xiao’s teeth were chattering as he pointed at the head under the glacier in fear.

The rest of them walked up to take a look but didn’t notice anything amiss.

“You must have damaged your mind from the fear right?” Qiu Chen said with a cold laugh.

Wu Xiao looked at the head again in disbelief but didn’t see anything wrong. He couldn’t help but feel that he must have seen it wrongly.

“Let’s not stay here. There’s something wrong with this place.” Zhan Rao rubbed his hands together as he urged them.

There was something wicked about the place and there was no way to tell what would happen if they continued staying here. They had just entered the mystic realm and the entrance had vanished. They had no choice but to continue exploring the mystic realm.

As the rest of them prepared to leave, Ye Qingtang walked by them, her eyes sweeping across the corpses. Just as Ye Qingtang’s eyes swept across them, something strange happened. The corpses started shaking beneath them!

In the next second, the glacier beneath them shook violently as a huge crack webbed across their feet. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“What’s going on?!”

“The glacier is cracking, quick, run!” The rest of them started running as they panicked.

Just as their feet left the ground, the glacier rose from the layers of ice beneath them. The lifelike corpses were all pushed out from within the ice.

“AHHHH! It hurts!”

“So cold... so cold...”

“Save me... save me...”

“Kill me... let me die... let me die...”

The moment the corpses broke out of the ice, shrill cries emanated from the dead bodies.

Ye Qingtang and the other nine who were flying in the sky looked down below them in disbelief at the rising glacier, with the myriad of frozen corpses shrilling at them with their white mouths.

“Are they... are they not dead?” Sang Feiyu looked at the countless corpses and then at the head of the Wu Family Elder. He was howling shrilly as well, his mouth opening and closing, as though he was in purgatory.

But before they could fully understand what was going on, a mighty roar entered their ears.

As the ice continued to break beneath them, a giant figure rose from the ice.

It was a monster so enormous it was hard to comprehend. Covered completely in scales as sharp as knives, the corpses seemed to be all frozen on its back. The loud cry from the monster seemed to devastate the corpses and their faces twisted grotesquely as their shrill cries became even louder.

“What is that...” Wu Xiao blanched as he stared at the monster crawling out of the glacier. The monster was draped entirely in corpses, the lifelike corpses adorning it like jewelry.

In an instant, they could feel the strong breath from the monster.

It felt like death.
