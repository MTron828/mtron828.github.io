Ye Qingtang’s heart quivered. She had never expected to see Zhan Rao here. Almost subconsciously, she propelled herself with the black flames to Zhan Rao’s side.

“I’ll take you along.”

A frown appeared on her face as she focused. Grabbing hold of Zhan Rao’s shoulders, she tried to pull him out. Zhan Rao’s face remained in a trance as he continued mumbling Ye Qingtang’s name.

Ye Qingtang used all the energy in her body but was only able to drag him up a little. But what lay beneath his body made her blood run cold.

Underneath him was a huge, wriggling mouth and from it were a myriad of tentacles that had already infiltrated Zhan Rao’s lower half.

It was then that Ye Qingtang realized that his lower half had already been fully invaded by those tentacles. Blood gushed from his wounds straight into the huge mouth as it continued chewing on Zhan Rao.

“Argh!!!”

The pain from her pulling made Zhan Rao cry out in agony. The immense pain seemed to clear Zhan Rao’s mind. The red glow in his eyes gradually faded as he looked at Ye Qingtang in shock and horror.

He knocked Ye Qingtang’s hands away. Dragging himself up on the other dead bodies with the tentacles trailing behind him in his abdomen, he shouted at her.

“Leave! You need to go now! Leave me, I can’t be saved.”

Ye Qingtang’s frowned. Even though she had already prepared for the worst, still...

Zhan Rao grabbed hold of an undead’s head to keep the huge mouth from dragging him back.

“Ye Qingtang... thank you... I never thought that you would have wanted to save me... but it’s too late...”

After Zhan Rao was dispersed with the others, he came into contact with an extremely powerful monster. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t defeat it and was brought here.

This was truly a living hell.

There was no land under the undead at all, only huge, bottomless, gaping mouths full of tentacles. Once someone was caught in the tentacles and dragged into the mouth, the parts below their chest would be chewed up quickly.

Zhan Rao was only left with everything above his waist intact. Anything below that had long been chewed into mincemeat and swallowed up by the bottomless gaping maws.

With the continuous injuries that they were taking, as well as the relentless infiltration of the tentacles, their consciousness would soon be wiped out, leaving them an empty shell of an undead.

Zhan Rao’s consciousness had already faded to almost nothing. If not for the fact that he had met with someone familiar, he would probably not have regained the last part of his consciousness.

“Go... please go now...” Zhan Rao knew that he didn’t have long to live. The once elegant young man had been reduced to something neither dead nor alive, with his consciousness almost gone.

He knew that there was no way he was going to survive this and didn’t want Ye Qingtang and the rest to suffer the same fate as him.

But before he could finish what he wanted to say, the tentacles piercing through him dragged him back into the huge mouth.

Ye Qingtang barely had time to grab hold of his arm, as he slipped right out of her grasp.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
