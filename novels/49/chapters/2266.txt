Chapter 2267: Leaving (4)

After walking for an unknown period of time, the group finally emerged from the herd of hibernating Night Soul Beasts. It was not that far a distance, but everyone was drenched in cold sweat.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang and her group had safely emerged, the Night Soul Beast in her arms rolled its eyes in hopelessness.

Ye Qingtang scanned the way before them. It was pitch-black, like a tunnel with no end. But Ye Qingtang knew that as long as they continued this way, they would be able to leave the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

“Go on.” Ye Qingtang nodded at the teenagers, indicating that they should move first.

Lei Yan and the others thought that there was still a long way to go and so despondently trudged forward. But the moment Lei Yan entered the darkness, the pitch-black scene before him was suddenly replaced by bright light.

Dazed by the piercing light, Lei Yan instinctively shut his eyes and when he opened them again, he realized…

He was standing outside the entrance of the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

The entrance of the fiendcelestial’s tomb was erected right before his eyes, in the middle of the mountain.

Lei Yan was bewildered.

How did he suddenly arrive here?

Before Lei Yan could snap out of his trance, Mu Ziying and Jing Ze appeared beside him. The two of them reacted the same way as Lei Yan. They were similarly stunned.

Close behind, Nangong Lie, Qin Feng, Yun Chen and the rest all appeared. Ye Qing, with the Night Soul Beast in his arms, was the last to emerge.

“Boss… how… how did we come out?” Nangong Lie was puzzled. He looked around. Apart from the large stone door, which was the entrance to the fiendcelestial’s tomb, they could not see any other doorway.

How did they come out?

“Just like that.” Ye Qing would not be able to explain everything about the fiendcelestial’s tomb right now. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

They had been lucky. After diving into the boundless river, they managed to find the nearest exit. If they had entered another tunnel inside that boundless river, who knew where they might have ended up?

Ye Qingtang had also noticed earlier that there were nearly a thousand different tunnel entrances at the fiendcelestial’s treasure trove. Each represented a road and no one knew what they would encounter in each.

And amongst the 1,000 tunnel entrances, only the one hidden behind the skeleton would lead to the exit from the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

If Ye Qingtang hadn’t been reborn and knew key information about the fiendcelestial’s tomb, they would probably have died inside.

“Now is not the time to talk about all these. We must return to the camp immediately.” Ye Qing surveyed the teenagers with a cold eye.

Lei Yan and the rest knew that Ye Qing was just waiting till they returned to camp to give them a good scolding.

“Boss, let us explain. We had no choice, Little Senior Sister…”

“We will talk after we go back.” Ye Qing stated coldly.

Since the Temple of Paragon had issued the reward notice, the factions they encountered earlier would not be the only ones in the Second Domain to be interested. Those factions would be on their way to the Evil Soul Forest now. Ye Qingtang did not wish to encounter those other factions outside the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

Lei Yan and the rest instinctively shrank back. Knowing that they were in the wrong, they had no choice but to obediently follow Ye Qing back to camp.

On the way back, Ye Qingtang noticed from afar several teams of horsemen flashing past the undergrowth. They looked like men from the other factions, who were rushing to the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

After the entrance to the fiendcelestial’s tomb had been opened, it would not close for the time being.
