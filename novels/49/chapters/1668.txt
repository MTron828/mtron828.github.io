Chapter 1669: In Trouble (1)

Baili Xuanyun swept a glance towards Jiang Yiran and laughed frostily. “Apologize? I’m afraid your apology doesn’t carry enough weight. But if you are willing to publicly kneel and kowtow to Younger Sister Ruxue three times, perhaps I will consider it.”

“You!”

Jiang Yiran’s expression darkened at Baili Xuanyun’s words.

Even Jiang Yisheng and the others felt that Baili Xuanyun was going too far.

“Fine! I’ll kneel.” Jiang Yiran gritted his teeth. He had brought about this trouble, so he would accept the consequences!

Gathering his robes, Jiang Yiran prepared to kneel.

“Jiang Yiran, what are you doing?!” Jiang Yisheng was growing frantic.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Although she felt that Jiang Yiran had caused her a lot of trouble, he was being forced to kneel, and that was not an outcome that she desired either.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang suddenly stepped forward and grabbed Jiang Yiran’s arm, preventing his knees from touching the ground.

“What’s the matter? Come to a decision?” Baili Xuanyun sneered coldly.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. A cold light flashed across her eyes, mirroring the gleam in Jiang Shaobai’s. He was about to rise when another figure beat him to it.

“Jiang Yiran, stand up,” a cold command rang out.

Jiang Yiran raised his eyes and saw that Jiang Yanyun had arrived at some point and was standing in front of them. At that moment, Jiang Yanyun’s expression was as frosty as an iceberg and he considered Baili Xuanyun coldly.

“Is this what the Jiang family rules are like? They don’t dare to take responsibility for their actions? If you’re really afraid, then just stay at home and don’t come out to embarrass yourself,” Baili Xuanyun sneered.

Jiang Yanyun’s gaze swept over Jiang Yiran, who lowered his head in shame. Turning his gaze away, he said, “Baili Xuanyun, if you want to fight, I will challenge you in three days.”

Everyone was shocked by Jiang Yanyun’s words.

In three days, the final results of the Martial Arts Championship would be announced. Then, the top ten from this championship could challenge the top ten of the last championship.

What Jiang Yanyun meant was that he planned to challenge Baili Xuanyun. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At that moment, everyone was stunned.

“Elder Brother Yun...” Jiang Yiran was ashen. He knew he was in huge trouble.

Baili Xuanyun laughed.

“Alright. I’ll be waiting for you in three days. Jiang Yanyun, I hear that you’re the most powerful of your generation in the Jiang family. If you lose, does it mean that your entire Jiang family is a pile of trash? But... that’s already common knowledge. I shall look forward to it. Haha...” Baili Xuanyun chuckled as he turned to leave with Mu Ruxue.

Mu Feiruo frowned slightly. She seemed about to say something, but in the end, she remained silent and left the restaurant.

“Elder Brother Yun, this is all my fault. Please beat me.” Jiang Yiran knew he had really messed up. Not only had he gotten Ye Qingtang into trouble, he had even dragged Jiang Yanyun into this mess.

Jiang Yanyun glared at Jiang Yiran. Then he suddenly raised his hand and simply swept it across Jiang Yiran’s head. “Scram. Go back and cultivate.”

With his eyes red, Jiang Yiran silently nodded and glanced apologetically at Ye Qingtang before leaving without a word.

Ye Qingtang was inwardly conflicted. She had not expected this turn of affairs.

“Jiang Yiran caused today’s trouble. I hope you won’t take it to heart,” Jiang Yanyun said as he looked at Ye Qingtang.
