Chapter 855 So That Is Why

“I don’t know anything. May I know what Fiendcelestial Beast senior knows?” Ling Yan looked at the little white tiger.

“If you don’t know, then forget it.” The little white tiger shook its head.

It seemed that Ling Yan only calculated Ye Qingtang’s karma destiny but was still completely unaware of what would happen

next.

“Ling Yan, how about I tell you all of the secrets!” the little white tiger said excitedly.

However, Ling Yan shook his head in response. “There’s no need. If you tell me everything, what meaning is there left?”

“F*ck, you’re really a strange person.” The little white tiger sized up the man before it curiously.

A while later, Ling Yan closed his eyes to rest while the little white tiger remained beside him idly with boredom.

In the dark night.

A black ball emerged out of Ye Qingtang’s body and floated outside the cave instantly. A murderous intent filled its eyes when it saw the man who was resting.

Swoosh!

The little black ball darted towards Ling Yan in a flash. A powerful and strange aura rushed in the air, wanting to envelop Ling Yan and crush him.

At the same time, Ling Yan suddenly opened his eyes and sized up the little black ball in the

air.

The corners of Ling Yan’s lips tugged up slightly immediately. “So that is why… I understand already.”

“You must be conspiring something for getting close to my mother. You must die!” The little black ball looked at Ling Yan and said. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“You want me to die, but even you… may not be able to do it, right?” There were no ripples in Ling Yan’s eyes.

“Die!”

The little black ball charged towards Ling Yan immediately.

Without saying anything, Ling Yan slowly closed his eyes again, ignoring the murderous intent of the little black ball.

“Roar!”

Instantly, the little white tiger let out a furious roar. Its body enlarged rapidly, and it guarded Ling Yan. “If you wish to kill him, get past me first!”

“That’s why I said that you cannot kill me.” Ling Yan shook his head. “Thank you for helping me, Fiendcelestial Beast senior.”

“F*ck. No wonder you asked if you have any life danger. You calculated this out from the start didn’t you… You even didn’t let me return to the cave. What a good scheme!” The little white tiger immediately turned around and shot Ling Yan a look.

Ling Yan merely returned a small response without saying anything.

“Get lost. You don’t have any business here!” The black ball glared at the little white tiger.

“Scramble back. As long as I am here, you won’t even be able to find the chance to kill this fellow!” The little white tiger guarded beside Ling Yan without moving an inch.

“Since that’s the case, I will kill you two off together!” The little black ball remarked coldly.

“Haha… If you could kill me, you would have done so a long time ago, and there’s no need to wait until now. Both of us can’t do anything to each other right now. Get lost!” The little white tiger snickered coldly.

Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Ling Yan seemed to be in thought.

“Good… Just you wait.” Seeing that it could not deal with the little white tiger, the little black ball left a threat and returned to the cave and back into Ye Qingtang’s body instantly.

“You are really so intelligent to the point that you’re unbridled!” When the little white tiger saw that the little black ball backed out in the face of the difficulties, it could not help but size up Ling Yan once again.

“Fiendcelestial Beast senior, you should know why it wants to take my life, right?” Ling Yan smiled.

“Of course I do.” The little white tiger nodded.

“Then, you and I are allies from now on,” Ling Yan said.

“F*ck. As long as you don’t have any wicked ideas and injure it, I will definitely befriend you. Otherwise, don’t blame me for falling out with you,” the little white tiger said coldly.

“If that is the case, I believe you and I will be good friends forever.” Ling Yan chuckled.
