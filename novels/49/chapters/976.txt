Chapter 977 Do You Really Want Me To Compete? (4)

The moment Duan Tianyun finished speaking, everyone recalled Duan Tianrao and Ye Qingtang’s past engagement.

“What’s the matter? Unwilling to compete? Or perhaps… you people from the Ye Family are just a useless bunch, as cowardly as mice. Even you, the Eldest Young Lady, are too cowardly to stand up for your Ye Family.” Duan Tianyun mocked them without mincing his words. He intended to use this match to completely subjugate the Ye Family forever.

Abusing Ye Qingtang in public would completely shatter the Ye Family’s dignity.

Ye Qingtang looked coldly at Duan Tianyun, who had repeatedly provoked them. Her expression was completely calm, and she asked blandly, “Do you really want me to compete?”

“What else?” Duan Tianyun laughed softly and shrugged. “But if you are afraid, it is no big deal. Your Ye Family has been utterly defeated in today’s match. In the future, you just have to follow the rules and pay tribute to the Duan Family … As a start, you have to show your submission to our Duan Family in your capacity as Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family.”

Malice flashed across Duan Tianyun’s eyes as he spoke. He smiled and said, “If you publicly kowtow to me three times, I won’t make things difficult for anyone in your Ye Family today. How about that?”

The moment Duan Tianyun spoke, the surrounding audience could not help but secretly shake their heads.

Ye Qingtang was no match for Duan Tianyun. After today, the Ye Family would probably be unable to retain their dignity.

Everyone clearly sensed that Duan Tianyun was planning to use Ye Qingtang to destroy the last shred of the Ye Family’s dignity.

“Duan Tianyun, don’t go too far!” When the youths from the Ye Family heard Duan Tianyun’s words, they glared at him in rage.

Even though they did not like this Eldest Young Lady, Duan Tianyun was insulting the entire Ye Family. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“What’s the matter? Are any of you unwilling to concede defeat? You can always come up on the dais and fight for the Ye Family.” Duan Tianyun spoke boldly. “The winner takes it all. If any of you can defeat me, I can kneel and kowtow to him and publicly admit defeat. How about that? But… you Ye Family members are probably a pile of garbage without the courage and ability to do that.”

“You!” The youths from the Ye Family were enraged. They fervently wished they could hack Duan Tianyun into a thousand pieces.

However…

Just as the group from the Ye Family was raging, Ye Qingtang, who had remained silent all this while, slowly stepped onto the dais.

At that moment…

Everyone below the dais fell silent. They looked in astonishment at Ye Qingtang, standing alone on the dais.

“Has Ye Qingtang really gone to compete? Is she crazy?”

“I’d say she’s really foolish. She can just pretend to be deaf and flee. Why go up there and make a fool of herself…”

Everyone sighed and shook their heads when they saw the “impulsive” Ye Qingtang.

The youths from the Ye Family snapped out of their trance and hurriedly said, “Eldest Young Lady, come down now!”

Ye Qingtang was the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family, but everyone knew that she was no match for Duan Tianyun. But if she was publicly defeated by Duan Tianyun, then the Ye Family would truly be utterly embarrassed.

“Eldest Young Lady, don’t be impulsive!”

The group from the Ye Family was nervous and angry.

Never mind that this Eldest Young Lady had not much ability.

Couldn’t she refrain from causing trouble?!

Ye Qingtang did not seem to hear the shouts from the Ye Family group. She just stood calmly and faced Duan Tianyun.
