Upon hearing that, Yi Tianchou’s eyes flickered as he chuckled. “So you’re injured… Don’t panic though. I can help to treat you.”

“Really…” Ye Qingtang looked at Yi Tianchou in confusion with an “innocent” expression.

“Of course it’s real… However, what benefits can you give me?” Yi Tianchou narrowed his eyes, and a malicious intention flashed across his eyes.

“I… I don’t have any valuables or money on me as I lost all of them when I was being chased after by a demonic beast…” Ye Qingtang uttered pitifully as though she did not see the evil intentions in Yi Tianchou’s eyes.

“Heh heh. I have plenty of money, and I don’t like those…” Yi Tianchou’s burning gaze scanned Ye Qingtang brazenly as he continued. “How about… we’ll do some wonderful things together… Afterward, I’ll treat your injuries.”

“Wonderful things?” Ye Qingtang looked at Yi Tianchou in confusion.

“Heh heh… she’s actually a virgin too… This luck of mine… Hahaha…” Yi Tianchou guffawed. “Wonderful things obviously meant the thing between a male and a female.”

“What!” Ye Qingtang’s expression changed immediately, and panic emerged on her face. She shook her head and said frantically, “I don’t want you to treat my injuries for me anymore…”

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, all traces of a smile on Yi Tianchou’s face faded as he said coldly, “Little beauty, this is not up to you… Haven’t you seen my face in Xuanling Sect’s Assassination Roll? Don’t you know who I am?!”

Ye Qingtang deliberately inspected Yi Tianchou carefully and acted as though she had just realized it now. “You are… Yi Tianchou!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hahahaha…” Yi Tianchou had a pleased expression on his face. “Since you know me, you should be clear about my rules… If you obediently please me until I’m satisfied, I can still keep your corpse as a whole… Otherwise… I can only chop your head and use your body for pleasure…”

“No… No… I beg you, please don’t kill me…” Ye Qingtang retreated backward “fearfully” although there was a sly smile at the bottom of her bright eyes.

“Hahaha!” Yi Tianchou licked his lips. “I even killed the princess of Formidable Heavens Dynasty… Any beauty that I have my eyes on is already dead… However, before you die, you can always feel extreme happiness…”

“I beg you… Don’t kill me… I can use the Spirit Life Flower to exchange for my life!” Ye Qingtang said.

“Spirit Life Flower?!” Yi Tianchou was slightly taken aback then.

He obviously was aware that the Spirit Life Flower was a treasure nurtured by the Heaven and Earth and that it could increase the powers of one’s primordial qi and even cleanse the spirit root!

Every powerful figure knew how precious the Spirit Life Flower was, and he had only heard about it in rumors but never seen it for himself before.

“You have the Spirit Life Flower?” Yi Tianchou looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

The Spirit Life Flower was a treasure that could be chanced upon but not sought after. How could the Xuanling Sect disciple before him have the Spirit Life Flower?

“I don’t have it!” Ye Qingtang said.

“You’re fooling me?!” Yi Tianchou’s expression darkened instantly.

“But I know where the Spirit Life Flower is. In a spot in the mountain valley where the spirit energy is rich, a Spirit Life Flower is growing there. I can bring you there!” Ye Qingtang said immediately.

After hearing her, Yi Tianchou was deep in thought for a moment and then nodded. “Alright. You’ll bring me to take a look. However… if you dare to lie to me…”
