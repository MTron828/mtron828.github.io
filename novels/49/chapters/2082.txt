Chapter 2083: Instant Kill (2)

The entire Central Mainland army that was mainly made up of the Temple of Shadows also charged towards the battlefield. It only took a few minutes before the entire battlefield was completely chaotic and the strong acrid scent of blood permeated the air.

Corpses were laying everywhere, with blood spilled as far as the eye could see.

Death was common on battlefields.

The Heavenly Wolf Sect had far exceeded the Crimson League in terms of the number of soldiers and had an overwhelming advantage.

Bloody corpses were everywhere.

Although the battle had just begun and the various ancient clans already had many casualties. However, no one cowered. Everyone was giving it their all to eliminate the enemies.

In the sky, Lu Zhiyao suddenly raised his sword and struck at Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang wasn’t powerful enough to handle Lu Zhiyao. She could barely even catch his shadow.

Right when Ye Qingtang thought that it was about time to die, a beam of holy light appeared from above and she was surrounded by the light.

Lu Zhiyao struck his sword over the holy light and he flew away from the impact. What in the world had happened?

The holy light passed through Ye Qingtang and struck the battlefield, instantly splitting the battlefield.

Mi and the others present were all stunned. They heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing the holy light separate the Heavenly Wolf Sect and the Ancient You Clan from them.

The holy light was extremely powerful. The moment it landed on the ground, it instantly burned all the living creatures that came into contact with it into ashes.

No matter the Heavenly Wolf Sect or the Crimson League, none of them had a chance at escaping. They were burned into ashes, becoming one with the ground.

What terrifying power!

Everyone was shocked and they subconsciously looked over to the holy light.

A Six-Winged Fire Phoenix appeared before their eyes in the sky. The fire phoenix glimmered and it was akin to a sun, floating above the sky.

“The Six-Winged Fire Phoenix... Is that... a heavenly beast?” Bai Zhi was stunned, with shock written all over her face.

Somehow... They could somehow see two figures riding on the back of the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix. They were both dressed in white robes and were calm and collected, looking at the battlefield from above. They seemed to not be affected by anyone at all.

Lu Zhiyao stared at the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix in astonishment. She realized that when the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix appeared, the beasts in the battlefield whimpered when they saw it. It was as though they saw something terrorizing, they crouched over, lowering their heads, and didn’t dare to make a single move.

The flying beasts also stopped moving, they landed on the ground and didn’t dare to fly back up into the sky. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

All that was left behind in the sky was the glimmering Six-Winged Fire Phoenix.

The beasts were all paying their respects...

Ye Qingtang was surrounded by the holy light and she felt like she was controlled by a certain force. She couldn’t move even the slightest and lifted her eyes to look over.

The two figures riding on the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix’s back appeared before her eyes. One of them was the man who suddenly challenged her at the Temple of Shadows that day.

What was going on?

Ye Qingtang was confused.

When Mi saw that familiar face, his heart raced.

Lu Zhiyao looked at the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix in front of him with narrowed eyes. He would have managed to kill Ye Qingtang earlier if they hadn’t come into the picture.
