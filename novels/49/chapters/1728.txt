Chapter 1729: Being Watched (3)

Ye Qingtang nodded.

A cold chill seemed to spread throughout Little White Tiger’s body.

Damn, and it thought it was being paranoid. It never expected there was really something outside watching them.

Given the situation, Little White Tiger didn’t dare to hesitate any longer. It picked up Ye Qingtang and dashed out of the cave.

Ye Qingtang clung onto Little White Tiger’s back. She had yet to fully recover and had no choice but to let Little White Tiger carry her.

But before they had even travelled over a hundred meters, Ye Qingtang instinctively turned back to glance at the cave. She saw that the black figure had been hiding under the snow, and it suddenly charged toward them!

The black figure was very fast, so fast that Ye Qingtang could not see what it was. That thing seemed to be targeting Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger. With its agility, it was soon right on their tail!

“Damn, is that thing following us?!” Little White Tiger could feel something terrifying behind them and catching up at a fast pace.

“Don’t stop.” Ye Qingtang furrowed her brows. She could see that the black figure was quickly approaching. Even Little White Tiger’s full speed seemed slow in comparison!

In both her previous and current lives, Ye Qingtang had never seen something that could match the speed of that black figure.

How many more types of these terrifying creatures existed in this mystic realm?!

Nevertheless, just as Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger were panicking over the black figure behind them, a series of web-like cracks appeared on the glacier in front of them!

In the next second, water gushed out of those cracks and morphed into numerous giant ice wolves!

Sh*t! Each of those giant wolves were three meters in height and possessed sharp icy fangs and malevolent eyes. Mighty howls emitted from their wide, bloodthirsty jaws.

“Damn! There are dangers everywhere! This place is relentless!” Little White Tiger exclaimed when it saw the pack of giant ice wolves charging toward them. Those giant ice wolves emitted waves of powerful aura as mighty as that of a Paragon-level practitioner.

What kind of joke was this! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Over a dozen Paragon-level giant ice wolves, any one of which could easily tear Little White Tiger and Ye Qingtang into pieces. Moreover, there was also some strange creature pursuing them from behind...

They were dead-meat!

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank all the way to the bottom. Her breathing seemed to stop as she watched the pack of giant ice wolves charging her way.

But just as that pack of giant ice wolves was about to pounce at Ye Qingtang, a tremendous demonic aura suddenly surged from behind her.

That demonic aura passed over Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger, heading straight towards the pack of giant ice wolves.

The giant ice wolves seemed to suffer an immense blow the moment that demonic aura made contact. With wretched howls, they stopped dead in their tracks, before standing there shivering and whimpering.

It was like some powerful force was holding them there.

“This...” Ye Qingtang stared at the shivering pack of giant ice wolves and confusion flashed past her eyes. Her heart quivered as she observed the demonic aura that permeated the air.
