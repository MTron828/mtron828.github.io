Ye Qingtang slowly looked up and sized up the sky.

An old man whose entire body was suffused with a green luster stood quietly in the sky like a god, looking down at the world below.

“The Feng… Feng Yun family patriarch… Emperor level!”

“T’ve never seen the Feng Yun family patriarch before. Is that old man really the Feng Yun family patriarch?” A young man from the Feng Family asked with a trembling voice.

“I’s indeed the Feng Yun family patriarch… It looks like even if Miss Ye wants to leave, she probably won’t be able to.” The Feng family patriarch looked up into the sky and sighed.

Seeing the white-haired elder in the air, Feng Cang and the other youths from the Feng family trembled violently.

‘The Feng Yun family patriarch had not appeared in the outside world for decades. He remained in seclusion all year round. Apart from the Feng family patriarch who had met him before, this was the first time the rest of the Feng family was seeing the patriarch.

“Members of the Feng family, how dare you kill an elder of the Feng Yun family!”

The Emperor-level powerhouse, who was emitting a green luster, spoke softly from the sky. Although there was no expression on his face, the might of his voice was terrifying.

The Divine Lord and Emperor levels were like the sun and moon, heaven and earth. They were completely incomparable. Only those who had truly stepped onto the Emperor level could be considered true experts. They had the ability to comprehend the stars in the universe, to develop their own Deity

Ocean, and even to comprehend the power of their own domain.

“Emperor… Emperor level, no… it’s not us, it’s her!”

Ayoung man pointed at Ye Qingtang with a trembling finger.

Ye Qingtang was the one who killed that elder in white from the Feng Yun family. It had nothing to do with them!

“Great Sir, this has nothing to do with the Feng family. It’s a personal grudge between her and your Feng Yun family!” Feng Cang’s entire body was already soaked in cold sweat. If an Emperor level practitioner wanted to, he could destroy the entire Feng family with the flick of a single finger.

“It’s you.” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

‘The white-haired elder’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly. She stared at the old Emperor level elder in the air without any fear in her eyes. “It was indeed me. One of your Feng Yun family members wanted to kill me. Unfortunately, his skills were inferior to mine and so I killed him.”

“Oh… his skills were inferior to yours?” The Feng Yun family patriarch seemed to be deep in thought. “So, you killed an elder of my Feng Yun family.”

Ye Qingtang said, “Why? Do you want to avenge him?”

However, to everyone’s surprise, the Feng Yun family patriarch shook his head and smiled. “Miss, there’s no problem with what you said. A Feng Yun Family elder wanted to kill you, but his strength is inferior to yours. It’s reasonable for him to be killed by you.”

“What do you plan to do then?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The elder continued to smile. “I didn’t want to do anything. However, the person you killed was still an elder of my Feng Yun Family. In my opinion, your life is not worth the life of an elder of the Feng Yun Family. In that case, I will have to kill off the entire Feng Family together with you.”

‘The faces of Feng Cang and the others turned ashen. An Emperor level practitioner was no joke

“You want to take my life?”

As Ye Qingtang stood below, the smile on her face faded. “Do you have the capability?”1
