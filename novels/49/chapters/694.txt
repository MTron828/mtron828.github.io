The demonic force in the little white tiger’s body was immediately drawn away by the Spirit Restriction Spell. Without the support of the energy, the little white tiger naturally could not spout the white flame anymore.

“What the f*ck. This human clan’s Beast Tamer Master does have some skills… Quick, help me kill him!!” The little white tiger stared at itself in wide eyes. Bound by the Spirit Restriction Spell, its body floated up and uncontrollably flew into the hands of the Zhou family clan in just a few breaths.

“Hahahaha. Good. Very good!” Clan Master Zhou beamed as he grabbed the little white tiger.

“F*ck you.” The little white tiger swore as it glared at the elderly.

If the energy in its body was stronger in the outside world, a mere Spirit Restriction Spell would simply be unable to draw its energy away.

The demonic force in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm was in higher quantities and could not be compared to the pure positive energy in the outside world. Thus, the Beast Tamer Master could succeed easily.

“Break this bastard’s arms and legs!”

The Dragon-Tiger General shouted furiously when he saw that Ye Qingtang was no longer protected by the spirit animal.

In the next second, thousands of military cultivators charged towards Ye Qingtang.

“You have a death wish!”

Seeing that the dozens of people in the lead were charging at her with spears, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered.

In an instant, the aura of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord filled the air.

Puff!

Puff!

With just the emergence of the aura of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, the dozens of military cultivators who charged towards Ye Qingtang paled and immediately spouted large amounts of blood. The dozens of people were strewn into the air and flung hundreds of meters away by the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord aura.

Swoosh!

Without giving anyone time to react, the Demonic Blood Sword slashed across.

The frightening blood-colored sword gleam swept the surroundings, seizing the lives of near a hundred of cultivators with just one strike.

Everyone in the black market was completely stupefied by the sight.

“Im… Impossible…”

“Lie… This must be a lie!”

“Oh my god. It’s actually… the peak of Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven!”

“No… No… This aura… Half-step… Yin Yang Perfected Lord!!”

“Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?!”

Everyone gasped as they looked at the beautiful young man who was holding a folding fan.

What kind of concept was a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

After sensing Ye Qingtang’s half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord martial aura, the remaining military cultivators were aghast and in disbelief as they trembled in fear.

In their troop, a cultivator with the skills of a Martial Qi Level Three First Heaven was already considered a super powerful figure. Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord… In their entire life… they had never seen a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord before!

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered as she walked forward slowly.

All that everyone saw was that the beautiful young man singlehandedly forced thousands of military cultivators to retreat continuously.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang turned into a shadow immediately and disappeared from where she was.

When Ye Qingtang appeared once again, she was beside Clan Master Zhou.

“You… are really bold.” Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly behind Clan Master Zhou.

After sensing Ye Qingtang’s half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord martial aura, Clan Master Zhou was drenched in cold sweat.

The most powerful person in their Zhou family clan had only entered the Martial Qi Level Three Second Heaven not long ago, and a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord was simply unimaginable…

“Have mercy, senior! I failed to recognize a formidable person that is you. Spare my life, senior!”

Clan Master Zhou fell on his knees before the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. If he knew that this young man was a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, he would not dare to offend him no matter how bold he was!!
