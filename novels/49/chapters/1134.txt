Chapter 1135: Protect (1)

“Holy… Holy Lady… save… me…”

The veins on Blood Moon Elder’s forehead popped up as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang walked forward, and a black demonic aura spiraled around her.

The energy of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was activated to the maximum.

Ye Qingtang placed a hand on Blood Moon Elder’s left shoulder and used the energy of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to devour the elderly’s mental energy. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Cooperate with me. Release all your mental energy!” Ye Qingtang looked at Blood Moon Elder grimly.

“Okay…” Blood Moon Elder nodded repeatedly.

Without any defense from the Blood Moon Elder, Ye Qingtang’s Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline invaded into Blood Moon Elder’s mental level easily and fully guarded his mental energy fully with her bloodline.

As long as that virtual elderly’s mental energy invaded in, Ye Qingtang’s bloodline energy could devour it, and thus, the Blood Moon Elder could remain safe and not disappear.

The moment Ye Qingtang guarded the Blood Moon Elder’s mental energy, an impressive amount of mental energy suddenly rushed from that virtual image of the elderly to the Blood Moon Elder!

In just a moment, the Blood Moon Elder’s body seemed to have suffered a huge impact and trembled uncontrollably.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes darkened, and her grip on the Blood Moon Elder’s shoulder tightened.

That surge of mental energy wanted to invade into Blood Moon Elder’s mind aggressively, but just as it filled him, the Heavenly Demon Bloodline that Ye Qingtang injected into the Blood Moon Elder’s mental level was immediately activated.

In the blink of an eye, the surging mental energy was completely devoured by Ye Qingtang’s Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

The elderly, who was originally waiting to collect his split self back, was surprised by the situation. He clearly felt that the mental energy he released earlier on was entirely devoured by a force in a moment.

Instinctively, the elderly looked at Ye Qingtang, who was beside the Blood Moon Elder.

Could it be that she… devoured my mental energy?

The elderly was uncertain, but he intensified the mental energy needed to collect the Blood Moon Elder back. Yet, no matter the extent that he increased by, all the mental energy that entered the Blood Moon Elder’s body was completely devoured by that mysterious force in no time…

“What… is going on…” The elderly frowned slightly as confusion filled his eyes.

Ye Qingtang looked up at the elderly with eyes blazing with anger.

“As long as I exist, you can dream on about collecting him back.”

The elderly was stunned. “It’s you who devoured my mental energy?”

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang admitted.

Surprise flashed across the elderly’s eyes. Never had he thought that Ye Qingtang actually had the ability to devour all of his mental energy!

However, he was just a virtual image formed by mental energy, and the majority of its mental energy was devoured by Ye Qingtang already. There was insufficient energy to sustain this virtual image, much less collect back the Blood Moon Elder.

The elderly in the air looked at Ye Qingtang in worry and sighed.

“Holy Lady…”

“What did you call me?” Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed slightly when she heard the familiar form of address from that elderly.
