Chapter 1439 Intolerable Bullying 2

Beidou Demon Lord’s expression darkened when he heard that youth’s unrelenting reprimands. Putting down his dear dragon peach, he looked at the youth coldly and said,

“What younger sister You or not? Why must my little sister apologize to anyone? What a joke.”

“Little sister… Ha… So much for having the Jiang Family bloodline in your body. You actually relegated to becoming brothers with an ape. How disgusting. It is seriously a humiliation to the Jiang Family to let such a person like you crawl into the Jiang Family.” The youth in the lead scoffed and immediately looked at the people behind him.

“Since someone is so shameless, there’s no need for us to be polite either. We should properly teach this newbie the rules of the Jiang Family.”

The moment that youth spoke, the teenagers behind him immediately walked toward Beidou Demon Lord and Ye Qingtang. Only Ye Xun stood beside that youth in the lead with a gloating expression.

“Luckily, Brother Yiming is here today. Otherwise, no one can help Sister You after she suffered such an injustice.”

The youth in the lead was Jiang Yiming, one of the grandchildren of the Domain Monarch. Ever since Ye You returned to the Jiang Family, she was very close to Jiang Yiming.

“Of course I have to help younger sister You vent her anger after she suffered such a huge injustice. There’s no need for Aunt Qin to step in in such small matters,” Jiang Yiming said.

A smile flashed across Ye Xun’s face as she watched Ye Qingtang, who was encircled by the group.

Failing to use Jiang Qin to get rid of Ye Qingtang yesterday remained as Ye You’s sore point.

Fortunately, Ye Qingtang’s “parents” were not in the Jiang Family, and it would be best to get rid of her at this timing.

Moreover, the issue could be shirked if Jiang Yiming and the other younger generation people killed Ye Qingtang. By then, even if Jiang Lang and his wife came back, they could not say much about it.

This was also what Jiang Qin wanted.

Ye Qingtang’s expression darkened immediately as she looked at the people encircling her.

She knew that Ye You would definitely not let things be so easily.

Especially after knowing that her “parents” had no regard for laws and rules, Ye You would definitely get rid of her before they returned. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Little sister, what’s with these Jiang Family people? They were clearly the ones who brought you back, but now…” Beidou Demon Lord could also tell that these unfriendly people clearly targeted Ye Qingtang.

A tinge of coldness emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Most of these people were above Arcane Supremacy Fifth heaven, and one of them even reached the Eighth Heaven, which was on par with Ye Qingtang’s skills.

Ye Qingtang still had confidence if she fought them one on one, but it was clear that they were not intending to do that.

“Bullying the outnumbered? So this is what you all are capable of?” Ye Qingtang put on a calm front as she shot Jiang Yiming a sarcastic look.

“Ha. There’s no need for principles in dealing with people like you. You offended my younger sister You. Even if you are killed, you deserve it.” Jiang Yiming snickered.

Ye Qingtang could tell that these people were under Jiang Yiming. Seeing that they had already surrounded herself and Beidou Demon Lord and blocked an escape route, Ye Qingtang changed her mind immediately.

“In this case, you want to help Ye You to seek revenge?”

“Of course.” Jiang Yiming replied.

“You’re just an incapable bastard to help Ye You seek revenge. You don’t dare to come over to personally avenge Ye You and only dare to send them to me. Why? Could it be that you’re afraid of me?” Ye Qingtang seemed to be completely fearless as she spoke with a provocative tone.
