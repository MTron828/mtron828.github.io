Chapter 2388: Endure (4)

A student who had just undergone a battle stood behind the teachers, his body covered in multiple injuries. These students had used their own flesh and blood to defend the Netherworld Academy’s reputation.

Meanwhile, Ye Qing and his team were hiding at the back. Even though he had the two most important students in the Netherworld Academy, he refused to let them participate!

How could the students and teachers, who had sacrificed so much for the honor of the Netherworld Academy, endure this situation?

“We can’t say anything about Qin Feng not participating. After all, he was brought to his current level by Ye Qing. But what about Ran Mo, Hang Wenwei and the others? What right does Ye Qing have to prevent them from participating?”

“This is also my decision. If you have a problem with it, I will bear the consequences.” Wen Qi sighed.

“Vice-President, we know you are protecting Ye Qing, but this Inter-Academy Competition concerns the future of our Netherworld Academy. As much as you want to protect him, there should be a limit to it!”

Wen Qi looked very helpless. After all, he already predicted this situation.

At this time, Ye Qingtang had just arrived at the doorway. Before she stepped in, she could already hear the teachers’ angry demands. Just as she was prepared to enter, Luo Sheng suddenly hurried over to stop her.

Luo Sheng shook his head at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang knew Luo Sheng had good intentions. She was just about to say something when a familiar voice rang out from the room.

“Qiu Nan, speak for yourself.”

“Vice-President, I also wish to participate in the sparring matches…”

Qiu Nan’s voice rang out from the room.

Previously when Ye Qingtang informed them that they were not going to participate in the sparring matches, Qiu Nan already felt rather uncomfortable. Then his former teacher had sought him out and told him that he couldn’t forsake the academy’s honor just to save his own skin.

Even if he knew he would lose, he should not be afraid of battle.

As a result, Qiu Nan had followed his teacher to meet Wen Qi today. But even if Qiu Nan wanted to participate now, it was already too late.

Having missed the drawing of the lots on the first day, no one would be allowed to join in mid-way.

Argumentative voices continued inside the room, and Luo Sheng didn’t let Ye Qingtang enter. The two of them just remained standing outside.

After a long time, the door was opened.

Angry-faced teachers barged out. Seeing Ye Qing standing outside, the anger on their faces intensified. Meanwhile, Qiu Nan couldn’t help ducking out of sight when he saw Ye Qing.

“Ye Qing, from today onwards, you are not to interfere with Qiu Nan anymore. He is my student. You don’t need to worry about him in the future.” Qiu Nan’s teacher snapped furiously before leading Qiu Nan away.

The other teachers and students also glared at Ye Qing with displeasure. Without another word, they all stormed off.

Wen Qi was inside the room looking very grim. Seeing Ye Qing and Luo Sheng outside, he composed himself and said, “Ye Qing, the individual martial arts competition will end in a few days. Following that will be the alchemy competition, so have Yun Chen prepare.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Even now Wen Qi’s attitude was genial and gentle and he behaved like nothing had happened. But Ye Qingtang had also heard of the consecutive defeats suffered by the Netherworld Academy over the past few days. Combined with what she overheard just now, Ye Qingtang could imagine just how much pressure Wen Qi was under now.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded before she departed without another word.

After that day, Qiu Nan no longer appeared with Hang Wenwei and the others. He had returned to his teacher’s side. Lei Yan and his group realized this but no one made any further comments.
