1380 A Qualified Quack 1

the qi emperor and the other believers had been adherents of the dragon court sect for many years, and this was not the first time they had seen the immortal use his powers to resurrect the dead. they did not show any signs of surprise and merely looked reverent.

“of course the immortal can resurrect the dead when he uses his powers. yuan emperor… you claim that your yuan kingdom also has an immortal, so why are you so surprised at this little bit of immortal power? ah… in the end, a fake is still a fake… now that you have seen the power of the immortal, you and that sinner who pretended to be an immortal know how pathetic you are,” the qi emperor said with a cold laugh.

ye qingtang, the sinner who pretended to be an immortal, looked expressionlessly at the man who had risen from the ice coffin.

when the old man saw his son come back to life, he kneeled and kowtowed to show his immense gratitude.

when everyone saw this, they were filled with envy. their faith in the dragon court sect was further strengthened. as long as they were sincere enough, the immortal would use his powers to save them…

“today is very hot. we need some rain to provide moisture…” the immortal’s voice rang out from the jade door again.

as he finished speaking, the patter of rain could immediately be heard from outside the hall. although it had been a blazing hot day, torrential rain immediately poured down outside the hall.

first, he had resurrected the dead. then, he had created a downpour on a blazing hot day. this immortal’s powers were truly boundless. the believers in the hall were filled with fear and trembling. their faith in the dragon court sect became even more deeply rooted.

ye qingtang glanced at the downpour outside. she could not even be bothered to smile.

she had thought…

that the dragon court sect’s immortal might be an explorer that the god of nature had trapped here.

but now it looked as if…

he was a poseur who was even more professional than her…

immortal aura that could relieve the summer heat? he had burned herbs that could relieve the summer heat.

empty decanters that suddenly produced wine?

had she not seen yin yang wine decanters before?

and the resurrection of the dead…

that friend who drank the drug to fake death should be more professional. since he was “killed” by wild beasts, why did his body show no sign of injury? surely he had not been frightened to death…

and the rain…

ye qingtang peered through the heavy rain and looked at the sun high in the sky a few hundred meters away. her lips twitched.

as for those ambassadors who were balancing on a transparent thread, pretending to fly, ye qingtang did not want to talk about them…

she was wrong.

she was not a quack. this “immortal” within the jade door was the real quack.

fortunately, ye qingtang had real abilities.

but this one was even better. not only was he proficient in the use of illusions, but he had also worked seamlessly with others. that scene with the old father trying to save his son was a delightful show. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

ye qingtang had been cautious at first. however, as the dragon court sect’s “immortal” produced one “good show” after another, ye qingtang’s caution evaporated.

this “immortal’s” illusions would, at most, be used by artistes in the villages of central mainland.

but here, they had made him an “immortal”, venerated by everyone.

just as she said.

the people in this world… were really gullible!

reality had proven that in this world, the martial arts standards were so low, and the people so inexperienced that it was pathetic.

ye qingtang could see through all this because she was powerful enough. her sight and hearing were many times superior to anyone here. these illusions could not escape her eye.

“yuan emperor, you have finally seen the immortal’s power today. i wonder what kind of powers the immortal by your side has?” the qi emperor asked suddenly, looking straight at ye qingtang.

she dared to pose as an immortal and was still thick-skinned enough to participate in the dragon court sect’s pilgrimage. she deserved to die!
