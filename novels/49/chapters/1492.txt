Chapter 1493 Overreaching 2

But the moment the man moved, rage flashed across the eye of the Cyclops Demon King, who was still shouting harshly across the void. His huge body suddenly doubled in size, and his gigantic hands were instantly covered with a beam of black light. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

He raised his huge palms with a roar and swatted at the powerful cultivator from the Second Domain.

The powerful cultivator from the Second Domain smiled scornfully when he saw the Demon King make his move. He looked on disdainfully as he tried to raise his sword to slash the Cyclops Demon King’s palm, only to realize...

That his sword blade immediately shattered upon impact. The leather armor on the Cyclops Demon King’s arm was actually hundreds of times harder than meteoric iron!

Crash!

There was a tremendous crash, and the Cyclops Demon King simply smacked the stunned powerful cultivator from the Second Domain straight into the ground.

With a loud smash, the Cyclops Demon King’s palm crushed the powerful cultivator from the Second Domain. A large patch of blood, mixed with mangled flesh, oozed from between the Cyclops Demon King’s fingers...

The strong scent of blood immediately spread to everyone’s nostrils.

The Cyclops Demon King slowly opened his massive mouth, his ugly face looking even more sinister.

Everyone stood there stunned as they watched the Cyclops Demon King kill the powerful cultivator from the Second Domain with a single blow. Many of them started to frown.

“Hehe...” A bone-chilling laugh came from the Cyclops Demon King’s mouth. He slowly raised his hands. The flesh in his huge palms was mangled. The sticky mess of flesh and blood in his hand slowly dripped into the pool of blood.

The old man who was the leader of the Second Domain frowned slightly. The green-robed girl standing behind him had a strange expression.

“Overreached... himself...” The Cyclops Demon said mockingly in his stiff human speech. He opened his mouth and roared.

“If you don’t go... you will end up like him...” The Cyclops Demon King narrowed his single eye and swept a cold look at the other races present.

Jiang Shangyu frowned slightly. The Cyclops Demon King was even more powerful than legends had it.

As the Cyclops Demon King threatened them, all the Demon Kings and small demons present let out a deafening roar, as if in agreement.

The roar shook the area. The force of it poured forth like rushing waters of a waterfall.

“Master, this Demon King’s power...” The green-robed girl in the void showed no signs of pity when she saw the Cyclops Demon King kill her companion with a single blow. She only looked at the old man in front of her.

The old man’s expression did not change. To them, it was as if their companion’s death was no more than a cool breeze brushing past them.

“He was careless. It was no one else’s fault.” The old man said gravely, with only a hint of compassion.

The Demon King was incredibly powerful. His skin was as tough as bronze, and his bones as hard as iron.

The Cyclops Demon King smashed one fist on the mountain. The mountain peak was instantly crushed to smithereens. He clearly intended to intimidate them.

Jiang Xun frowned as she looked at this hostile Demon King. Her brows deeply furrowed, and she subconsciously moved to guard Ye Qingtang, who was behind her, a little more carefully.

The Cyclops Demon King’s abilities were remarkable. Even she was no match for him.

“Everyone, this Demon King seems to refuse to relinquish this big demon. What should we do?” The Beast Master looked at everyone. The Cyclops Demon King had already demonstrated that he was ready to drive them off. If this situation continued to drag on, who knew when it would end?
