Chapter 770 Full Moon Peak (1)

They really looked down on Ye Qingtang previously and thought that she was apprenticed to their Master by artifice.

Yet, unexpectedly… This fellow actually had such frightening skills himself!

Even Ye Ningxi, who had extensive knowledge, was truly convinced this time.

After dealing with Liu Mo, Ye Qingtang did not think much of it and went to do her things.

Gu Yihan, who rushed over a moment later, learned of Ye Qingtang’s actions from the others and was shocked.

Ye Qingtang thrashed the top disciples of Blue Cloud Peak and Water Cut Peak successively, which truly allowed the Admirable Sky Peak disciples who had been holding themselves back for a long time to feel avenged.

In just half a day, all the Admirable Sky Peak disciples already knew about Ye Qingtang’s actions.

Many disciples who had been repressed by these two peaks were overcome with emotions after knowing about the incident.

When dusk fell, a handsome man in green clothes stood under the moonlight on Falling Sky Valley’s Full Moon Peak. The moonlight scattered on his slender body, and it was as though his body was plated in a layer of pale light.

The youth was standing with his hands behind him. A pot of top-grade wine was placed on the stone table in front of him.

A Full Moon Peak disciple rushed to that man’s side hurriedly.

“Senior Brother Xuanyuan.”

The man standing under the moonlight was Falling Sky Valley’s number one talent, Xuanyuan Lie.

Xuanyuan Lie was currently waiting for Liu Mo to come over for a drink.

“Is Junior Brother Liu here?” Xuanyuan Lie asked that disciple who rushed over.

That disciple replied. “Senior Brother Xuanyuan, I’m afraid Senior Brother Liu is unable to come today.”

Xuanyuan Lie frowned slightly. “Why?”

“Senior Brother Liu was severely injured by Ye Chen of Admirable Sky Peak and is currently recuperating in Water Cut Peak. I heard from the physician that he may not recover fully even after half a month of rest,” the disciple said.

“What?” Surprise flashed across Xuanyuan Lie’s face.

Then, the disciple told Xuanyuan Lie the news he heard from Water Cut Peak in full detail.

Xuanyuan Lie’s brows were slightly furrowed.

“Ye Chen? Is he the disciple whom Perfected Xuanchen just accepted?”

“Yes.”

Xuanyuan Lie thought for a moment and said, “I know already. You may retreat.”

After that disciple retreated, Xuanyuan Lie suddenly turned around and headed to Full Moon Peak’s main hall.

Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master was seated at the main seat of the hall as he read through the files before him.

“Grandfather.” Xuanyuan Lie walked into the main hall with great strides and greeted the Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master.

Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master was already over fifty years old, but there were not too many traces of his age on his face. His bright eyes were threateningly sharp. In the entire Falling Sky Valley, Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master was at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state already, and his skills were only second to the old Valley Master.

“Didn’t you ask Liu Mo out for a drink today? Why are you back now already?” Full Moon Peak’s Peak Master asked his grandson whom he took pride in.

Xuanyuan Lie took a step forward and immediately told the Full Moon Peak Peak Master about Liu Mo.

The Full Moon Peak Peak Master frowned slightly upon hearing it.

“Perfected Xuanchen’s newly-accepted disciple really has this ability? He defeated Liu Mo with just one move?”

“Yes.” Xuanyuan Lie nodded.

Full Moon Peak Peak Master narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Given your skills, how would it be if you fought Liu Mo?”

“I naturally have the confidence to defeat him within a move,” Xuanyuan Lie said confidently.
