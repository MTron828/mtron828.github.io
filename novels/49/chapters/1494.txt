Chapter 1495 Big Demon 1

The roaring noise continued to reverberate in their ears. It looked as if the huge body would crush the mountain range.

They had been ready to fight, but now, they stiffened and looked at the gigantic creature slowly rising from the ground.

“Isn’t dead... the big demon... isn’t dead?” Jiang Xun had an extremely ugly expression.

The Cyclops Demon King was so powerful, yet the big demon had crushed him into meat paste before their eyes with one blow.

Roar... A low growl emerged from behind the mountains. They saw a huge black figure slowly arise, and a gigantic head emerged from behind the mountain peaks. With a pair of crimson eyes holding vertical pupils that were as large as moons, the huge figure swept a look across every living thing present.

The cry of a phoenix suddenly arose. The Nine-headed Demon Phoenix was so aggressive earlier, but the instant it saw the big demon “return from the dead”, it spread its wings and urgently tried to flee this hellish place.

But before the Nine-headed Demon Phoenix could get far, a scarlet tongue suddenly shot out from behind the mountains. The mucus-covered tongue swept across the horizon and swept up the Nine-headed Demon Phoenix, which was hundreds of meters long, and countless flying small demons. They were swiftly dragged behind the mountain peaks and vanished.

A crisp crunching noise instantly rose from behind the mountains. They could vaguely see blood flying and splattering the half-hidden head.

When Ye Qingtang saw this shocking scene, she almost instantaneously grabbed the stunned Jiang Xun, turned, and ran.

The big demon of the Frosty Snow mountains... was still alive!

No one would have thought that the big demon they were fighting for was still alive. It had been lying motionlessly on the ground, as if waiting to swallow those who wanted to steal its treasure. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Damn it, the big demon was pretending to be dead. It’s going to seize the opportunity to kill us.”

The ambitious crowd finally realized that danger was imminent.

The big demon was as intelligent as any of them. In fact, it was smarter than most people.

This big demon had not died at all. It had deliberately crouched there without moving so that everyone would think it was dead, so that their greedy natures would emerge.

But they did not know that...

Their greed had brought death upon their heads.

Everyone who had intended to steal the big demon’s treasure now had a different expression. They hurriedly fled in all directions. Even the old man from the Second Domain immediately led his companions and flew to escape the area.

No ordinary person could withstand the power of the big demon. Even the demon kings submitted to the big demon and acknowledged it as sovereign.

But a moment later, the big demon finally straightened up. The endless mountain range looked like pathetic little hills beneath its feet. The big demon’s six gigantic claws easily strode over the mountain peaks. Sending a wild gale with every move, the big demon instantly flattened the sturdy mountains.

Debris showered down from the sky like rain, killing the horde of small demons at the foot of the mountain.

Countless bodies piled up to form a mound at the foot of the mountains. Blood flowed like rivers.

The moment the big demon stood up, its body was no longer in everyone’s line of sight. Its huge head plunged into the clouds. and only its six gigantic claws remained in sight. The rest of its body was covered by the clouds.
