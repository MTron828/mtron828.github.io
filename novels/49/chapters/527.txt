Chapter 528 What is a Sect (4)

The man was strong and wore a bamboo hat. There was a ferocious scar beside his eyes.

“Senior Brother Yuanhu! His ability is the second in the inner sect. He has reached the peak of the Third Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Two!”

Many inner sect disciples were excited when they saw Yuanhu appeared.

“How dare you!”

One of the Yunxiao Sect’s inner sect elites had eyes filled with anger.

The Xuanling Sect disciples’ abilities could not even be compared to those of the Yunxiao Sect disciples, but they relied on the treasure and weapons of the Xuanling Sect to increase their own abilities.

“Fierce Bell!”

The Yunxiao Sect disciple threw a copper bell into the air.

The small bell increased in size once it was released into the sky. It only took two breaths’ time for it to be insanely huge. Deafening bell rings filled the sky, and the bell pressed down towards Yuanhu.

The huge bell was also a Dharma treasure.

Before the huge bell could press down, a huge cyan palm appeared in the sky.

Boom!

A deafening sound exploded in the sky. The cyan palm headed towards the huge bell, and they hit each other heavily.

Yuanhu and the rest took the gap to step back and avoided the attack from the bell.

The cyan palm was withdrawn by a young man after seeing that the Xuanling Sect disciples had escaped.

“Mo Changkong… Senior Brother Mo!”

The young man was handsome and sophisticated, but he was not dressed in a Xuanling Sect disciple’s attire.

Many Xuanling Sect inner sect disciples felt delighted when they saw the young man. They headed towards him.

“Sect Master, Mo Changkong is here.”

The young man held the cyan print and greeted the Sect Master.

“Good!”

The Xuanling Sect Master nodded. A smile passed his eyes as he stared at the young man.

Mo Changkong was Elder Mo’s son and the previous top disciple of Xuanling Sect. His ability surpassed everyone else’s, and he had left the sect many years ago. Now that the sect was in danger, he came back to help.

Elder Mo felt rejoiced as he saw Mo Changkong. He was not only his son but also one of his disciples like Ye Qingtang of which he felt most proud.

Mo Changkong scanned around and looked at the Xuanling Sect inner sect disciples, He wielded his hand. “Kill!”

Ten of the Xuanling Sect disciples headed forward instantly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Yun Shu, Lin Long, and Gu Yanqiu, together with the other outer sect disciples who remained, did not join the fight. They were in charge of helping those injured disciples.

“Ow!”

Large amounts of blood spurted out of one Xuanling Sect disciple’s mouth as he lay in front of Yun Shu.

“I’m sorry…” Yun Shu gritted his teeth. He felt that he was so helpless for the first time as he saw the blood on his hands.

“Live… You must live…”

The disciple held Yun Shu’s and Lin Long’s hands tightly. It seemed that he used all his strength to finished the words.

His arms fell to the ground as he finished his words. His eyes were still open as if he was not willing to accept his death.

Lin Long’s head was filled with the scenes of the disciples of both inner and outer sect gathering and celebrating yesterday as she witnessed the corpses around her.

However, the beating sounds of the drum pulled her back to the harsh reality.

Though Xuanling Sect had a lot of disciples, not everyone had weapons.

The treasures and divine weapons in the Treasure Pavilion were limited. Disciples whose abilities were weaker were all willing to give the divine weapons to those stronger. Only those who were strong were able to exploit the divine weapons completely.

There were quite a few injuries at Xuanling Sect, but the Yunxiao Sect also lost ten inner sect elites.
