Chapter 498: The Blood Moon (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

He remembered that many super sect disciples disguised themselves as the Blood Moon members and fooled the Blood Moon Sect using the special potion.

However, those potions could only help them to disguise as normal members. He had never seen a potion that could help Ye Qingtang disguise as a Blood Moon Guardian…

“Someone had invented the potion that could disguise one as a Blood Moon Guardian?” The Blood Moon Elder was confused.

“What’s going on!” Ye Qingtang slapped his head.

“Why did you hit me?! It’s not even my business!” The Blood Moon Elder took a few steps back. Was Ye Qingtang obsessed with hitting him?

As a Blood Moon Sect Elder, he was hit by a girl?!

Ye Qingtang did not bother about the Blood Moon Elder and immersed herself in thought.

Suddenly, she remembered the brother she had.

The sworn brother that she had seemed to be a great fan of the Blood Moon Sect and even called himself the Blood Moon Lord…

Ye Qingtang’s face suddenly changed, and she held the Blood Moon Elder up.

“I will fight back if you hit me one more time.” The Blood Moon Elder tucked his neck instinctively.

“Is the Blood Moon Lord… still alive?” Ye Qingtang said.

The Blood Moon Elder shook his head. “Since the fight between the Lord and the Ultimate Elder happened thousands of years ago, he has not been seen. No one knows whether he is alive or dead.”

Ye Qingtang let go of the Blood Moon Elder. She shook her head and laughed at herself. How could the brother she had be the Blood Moon Lord in the legend?

“Ye Qingtang, did you have any contact with anyone? The Blood Moon Aura and the blood moon you have are the same as the Blood Moon Guardians. From what I know, there was a potion that could forge the Blood Moon Aura few thousands of years ago,” The Blood Moon Elder said.

After hearing what he said, Ye Qingtang told him the things between her and her brother.

…

“What did you say? Who dared to disguise as the Blood Moon Lord?!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted in anger.

The presence of the Blood Moon Lord was like the faith totem of the Blood Moon Sect. Who dared to disguise as him?!

“The brother I have… is a bit ignorant. If I meet him next time, I will ask him to apologize to you.” Ye Qingtang felt slightly embarrassed. It was really inappropriate to disguise as someone who was the faith totem of the Blood Moon Sect…

She said earlier that he had to disguise as the Blood Moon Lord out of so many other choices… Did he think that his life was too long for him to live?

“Humph! If he dares to show up, I will chop off his head.” The Blood Moon Elder sneered.

“Okay, okay, you are the most powerful, and you are the best.” Ye Qingtang tapped his left shoulder as a sign of comfort.

The Blood Moon Elder took half a step back in discontentment. Did the girl just treat him like a child?

Ye Qingtang was sure that the brother she had must have possessed the potion that could forge the Blood Moon Aura and the blood moon. He definitely applied the potion on her when she was not aware.

He was the crazy fan of the Blood Moon Sect, and he wanted to drag her down as well?

Ye Qingtang was stunned for a second and then looked at her reflection in the water. She concentrated her primordial qi at her glabella area, and the blood moon resurfaced again. It faded as she released her primordial qi.

A thought emerged in her head. She looked at the Blood Moon Elder and said, “Just now, you said that the forged Blood Moon Aura and the blood moon belonged to the guardians level?”
