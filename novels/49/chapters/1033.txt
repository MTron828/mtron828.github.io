Chapter 1034 Return to the Sect (2)

One of the Yunxiao Sect disciples was a little surprised to see Ye Qingtang walking towards Xuanling Sect slowly.

“Why is that lady so familiar-looking?”

Before long, another Yunxiao Sect disciple exclaimed in shock. “Ye Qingtang!”

Although these YunXiao Sect disciples had never seen Ye Qingtang face to face, they had seen her portrait before.

“That Ye Qingtang appeared in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm previously and even obtained a Fiendcelestial Beast. Quick, inform the higher-ups!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

A YunXiao Sect disciple’s eyes were burning with desire.

“Although Ye Qingtang is only an ordinary disciple of Xuanling Sect, she was enraged our Yunxiao Sect and was listed on the Assassination Roll… Hehe, I never thought that my luck would be so good…”

A male in white stared at Ye Qingtang, and his lips curled into an icy snicker.

“Ye Qingtang’s skull is indeed valuable. However, it’s said that Ye Qingtang obtained the Fiendcelestial Beast in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm… If we kill her and end up not being able to find the Fiendcelestial Beast… Wouldn’t the sect not forgive us?” Another man spoke up.

“Humph. What about that. Let’s just break Ye Qingtang’s limbs and keep her alive on her last breath.”

“Wait wait… A Fiendcelestial Beast is very scary, and Ye Qingtang obtained it. No matter how weak Ye Qingtang’s martial skills are, she still possesses the Fiendcelestial Beast… Would we be able to block the attack of the Fiendcelestial Beast?”

“Hehe, what are you afraid of… that Fiendcelestial Beast is merely an infant.”

“That’s right. How lethal can it be if it could be taken by a Xuanling Sect disciple? There’s nothing to be fearful of!”

Then, the few of them immediately rushed towards Ye Qingtang without hesitation.

“Stop!”

The youth in the lead stared at Ye Qingtang and shouted coldly.

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks slightly and looked at the men before her.

“You are Ye Qingtang.” The man in the lead sneered.

“That’s right.” There were no emotions on Ye Qingtang’s face.

“You’re a lady, but I never thought that you would be so bold.” The Yunxiao Sect disciples snickered when the lady before them admitted her identity so simply.

Back when Ye Qingtang was in Xuanling Sect, she was merely an ordinary inner sect disciple, but she formed a deep hatred with YunXiao Sect and was listed on the Assassination Roll.

After such a long time, Ye Qingtang reappeared outside Xuanling Sect, and this was a great thing for the YunXiao Sect disciples.

“Ye Qingtang, if you are sensible, hand over that infant Fiendcelestial Beast, and we can consider sparing your life. What do you think?” One of the Yunxiao Sect disciples looked at Ye Qingtang and sneered.

However, before this Yunxiao Sect disciple could continue speaking, Ye Qingtang raised her right arm a little, and the disciple died instantly without anyone seeing how Ye Qingtang did it.

“This…”

The remaining YunXiao Sect disciples were left dumbstruck and in disbelief.

To these Yunxiao Sect disciples, Ye Qingtang’s attack was too quick, and they simply did not see how Ye Qingtang attacked.

Without giving the people a chance to speak, Ye Qingtang slaughtered all the Yunxiao Sect disciples in the surroundings in just the blink of an eye.

These disciples were already at the peak of Martial Qi Level Two Third Heaven, and it was considered pretty good. Yet, before Ye Qingtang, they were as frail as pieces of paper.
