“Senior Brother Fu, how are you going to take my life now?” Ye Qingtang smiled. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Fu Lingtian was outraged, and the force of his primordial qi escalated to the maximum. He immediately broke free from Ye Qingtang’s hold and turned around in an attempt to escape.

Then, Fu Lingtian was already aware that Ye Qingtang was at Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two. Even if he could kill her, it would cause a stirring, and the Xuanling Sect people would definitely be alerted since this was Xuanling Sect’s area of residence.

Ye Qingtang’s speed was originally swift. Now, after breaking through to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two, her skills had increased multiple folds, and her speed was all the more incomparable to before. In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang had already blocked Fu Lingtian’s way.

“Want to escape?” Ye Qingtang let out a cold laugh. “Just stay since you’re already here.”

Then, Ye Qingtang gathered all the force of her primordial qi into her fingers.

Whiz!

With the pointing of a finger, a piercing sound lingered in one’s ears as though the air was still.

Fu Lingtian was startled after feeling the force of Ye Qingtang’s one finger. He originally wanted to leave, but Ye Qingtang’s finger was pointed very brilliantly as it sealed his route of retreat and rendered him to have no way of escape.

In a moment of desperation, Fu Lingtian launched a lousy attack, but the speed of Ye Qingtang’s finger was too fast, and Fu Lingtian was too late.

Boom!

This finger fiercely landed on Fu Lingtian’s chest.

In the next second, a shrill scream escaped Fu Lingtian’s mouth. His entire body floated in the sky and was flung out of the room like a kite with a snapped string.

Ye Qingtang chased after, but before she attacked again, Elder Mo suddenly appeared.

“What audacity!” There was a cold glint twinkling in Elder Mo’s eyes as he slammed his palm against Fu Lingtian.

“Ow!”

Fu Lingtian was already injured by Ye Qingtang and was now attacked by Elder Mo, who suddenly appeared. After sustaining another injury on top of his previous injuries, his face paled, and blood spurted out of his mouth.

“Young one, how dare you intrude into my Xuanling Sect’s area of residence and attack my disciple in secret!” Elder Mo grabbed Fu Lingtian’s collar, lifting him in midair.

Ye Qingtang had just advanced to Martial Qi Level Two not long ago, and Elder Mo had been guarding in the vicinity. After hearing some unusual noise from Ye Qingtang’s room, Elder Mo immediately rushed over.

Very quickly, Elder Mo and Elder Lin appeared as well.

“Fu Lingtian from Qinglin Sect? What’s going on?” Elder Qin’s brows were tightly furrowed.

“This bastard intruded Qingtang’s room with evil designs,” Elder Mo said coldly.

“What?!” Elder Qin was shocked. Then, he shot a furious glare and pointed at Fu Lingtian. “How bold of you to do anything to satisfy your lust!”

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched upon hearing that. He was here to kill her all right…

“Elder Qin… Fu Lingtian… is here to kill me.” Ye Qingtang explained.

Elder Qin was stunned and instantly understood the situation. Awkwardness filled his face.

“Elder Mo, you should speak more clearly. ‘Evil designs’ can cause misunderstanding.” Elder Qin coughed lightly to cover up his embarrassment.

Elder Mo did not bother with Elder Qin as he gripped Fu Lingtian’s throat. “Speak. Did Qinglin Sect instruct you to do this!”

Then, Fu Lingtian’s face was flushed, and he had difficulty in breathing.

“Are you not speaking?” Elder Mo’s expression darkened.

“Elder Mo, you’re strangling his throat. How is he to talk?” Elder Qin reminded.

“Humph!” Elder Mo lifted his right arm and threw Fu Lingtian on the floor.

“You all… This bunch of old things…” Fu Lingtian looked at the elders.

“Do you have a death wish!” Elder Mo was filled with murderous intent.
