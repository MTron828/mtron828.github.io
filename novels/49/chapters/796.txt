Chapter 797 Grand Imperial Sire (2)

“Father, save me!” The little Emperor shouted.

After lifting the bed curtain, a haggard middle-aged man was laying on the wide bed with weak breaths.

The originally-handsome face was, however, shriveled like a dried corpse. His limbs that were exposed out of the blanket were exceptionally dry as though there was only a layer of skin that wrapped around the bones.

A pair of eyes fluttered open weakly and looked at the group of people at the bed’s end.

“Father…” As the little Emperor looked at his father, his eyes reddened involuntarily. At this moment, he was no longer a stubborn and rash Emperor but merely a child.

“My son has offended you all. Please… forgive… him… May I know… What do vou all… have to ask me…” The Grand Imperial Sire uttered slowly, and every word was spoken with great effort.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Grand Imperial Sire before him complicatedly.

She had heard that the Grand Imperial Sire was very ill, but she did not know that it would be this serious.

It was no wonder he had to abdicate and let his five-year-old son succeed him.

Compared to the mischievous little Emperor, the Grand Imperial Sire gave others a much more gentle and polite feeling.

Without saying anything, Ye Qingtang took out that jade pendant from her space ring and placed it before the Grand Imperial Sire.

When the Grand Imperial Sire saw that jade pendant, a trace of shock flashed across his eyes, and he looked up at Ye Qingtang strenuously in disbelief.

“Why… Why… Why do you have… this jade pendant?” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“So the Grand Imperial Sire recognizes it indeed. I am here today because of the jade pendant.” Ye Qingtang spoke slowly.

“Recognize… How can I not recognize it… This… This is an item she carried on her… back then… But why would this… be in your hands? I clearly… clearly saw her placing it somewhere else… back then…” the Grand Imperial Sire said.

“To tell you the truth, this jade pendant is related to my parentage. If you know about it, please let me know.” Ye Qingtang replied

“Wha… What?” The Grand Imperial Sire widened his eyes with great effort, and he scanned Ye Qingtang. “You… You said that this jade pendant… is related to your parentage?”

“This jade pendant was on me when I was still an infant. When my foster father picked me up, this jade pendant was with me.” Ye Qingtang explained.

The Grand Imperial Sire looked at Ye Qingtang with widened eyes but suddenly shook his head.

“No… It’s not possible… This jade pendant cannot be yours… She was pregnant when she came to the Nine Nights Dynasty and assisted me to steady my position as the Emperor. However… she was about to go into labor back then as well. She seemed to be worried about something and wanted me to secretly hide her. After her labor, she placed that jade pendant with that child… I personally witnessed her placing the jade pendant with her child, but that child was a girl…”

Ye Qingtang suddenly turned around, wiped her disguise away, and returned to her original voice.

“I am originally a girl.”

Ye Qingtang turned around and looked at the Grand Imperial Sire.

In just a moment.

When Ye Qingtang returned to her original looks, the Grand Imperial Sire and Long Jiang were completely shocked.

“Your… Your Lordship?!” Long Jiang widened his eyes in disbelief, and even Qu Xiangyang who came along gasped.

The young lady who stood before them clearly resembled their then Lord greatly!

“It’s you… So it’s you…” The Grand Imperial Sire’s body trembled as he looked at Ye Qingtang, and tears fell down from the corners of his eyes.
