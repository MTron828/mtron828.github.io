Chapter 962 Boy Genius (2)

Dan Yifan was now an inner sect disciple of the Leiting Sect, and his ability was naturally greater than average. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although Ye Qingtang had entered the Xuanling Sect, everyone knew that her spirit root was only a lowly red spirit root. It was already difficult for her to enter the sect, but she probably would not have the opportunity to enter the inner sect of the Xuanling Sect in her lifetime.

If Dan Yifan was willing to give a pointer or two, anyone would consider it a wonderful blessing.

Ye Qingtang looked expressionlessly at the youth before her with his arrogant brow.

“No need to bother you,” Ye Qingtang said blandly.

Dan Yifan raised his brows slightly. Clearly, he had not expected Ye Qingtang to reject him so curtly.

One must know that within the sects, the inner and outer sects were separated by a great divide. An outer sect disciple usually had no opportunity to even converse with an inner sect disciple.

However, Dan Yifan did not take this matter to heart. He had merely made the offer as a favor to the Ye Family.

“Yifan, did you obtain leave from your sect to return?” The Great Elder looked at his grandson whom he was so proud of.

“I have already made arrangements with my master. However, I cannot stay for long and will have to return to the sect after half a month at the most. My Master is bringing me into the sacred ground of the Leiting Sect to cultivate next month, and this cannot be delayed for too long,” said Dan Yifan.

“Of course, the sect takes precedence.” The Great Elder nodded slightly. “I have already made the situation with the Duan Family clear in my letter. Do you understand?”

Dan Yifan laughed softly and said, “Grandfather, don’t worry. Since I have returned and am now considered part of the Ye Family, of course, I won’t allow anyone to bully you. The truth is that I already broke through to the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One a year ago. So Grandfather, please don’t worry.”

The eyes of everyone in the main hall brightened when they heard Dan Yifan’s words.

One must know that Dan Yifan was currently only seventeen or eighteen and was considered very young. For him to have broken through to the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One meant he truly deserved to be called a genius.

Even Ye Ling and Second Elder, who were sitting by the side, looked at Dan Yifan in amazement.

“Since that is the case, I won’t worry anymore.” The Great Elder nodded and smiled. His eyes were filled with pride.

How talented was he, to be able to enter the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One at the age of seventeen or eighteen?

With Dan Yifan’s talent, given time, he would have no trouble breaking through to Martial Qi Level Two in the future.

However, just as everyone in the Ye Family was rejoicing in Dan Yifan’s arrival, a Ye Family guard suddenly rushed in.

“Master and Elders, the Duan Family… someone from the Duan Family is at the door.”

“Hmph, they are really arrogant. This Duan Family is going too far!” The Great Elder expression darkened, and he frowned deeply.

When Dan Yifan saw the Great Elder’s expression, he immediately said, “Grandfather, is this the youth from the Duan Family that you mentioned in your letter?”

“That’s right…” The Great Elder nodded slightly. “Not long ago, this person sought out the Ye Family and injured many of us. He is really arrogant. I’m afraid he’s here to make trouble again.”

Dan Yifan laughed softly. His gaze swept across everyone in the main hall as he said, “No problem. Since I’ve returned, I won’t permit anyone to make trouble. Grandfather, why don’t we go take a look at this Duan family member together?”
