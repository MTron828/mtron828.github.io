Ye Qingtang faced the warden and said, “Can I trouble you to let me take a look at the Demonic Blood Sword?”

“Demonic Blood Sword?” Qin Huan had a face of shock. He had heard of its name before and did not expect that this sword was actually in their sect. Looking at Ye Qingtang’s stance, it was clear that she wanted it since a long time ago.

At that thought, Qin Huan felt a chill down his spine.

Strangely, he always felt that apart from the aim of entering the inner sect, Ye Qingtang directly challenged Ji Xianyuan in the inner sect assessment was most likely… because she had her eyes on the reward for the first place in the assessment. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The more Qin Huan guessed, the more he felt that Ye Qingtang’s thoughts were unfathomable.

When exactly did she make this decision?

Upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the warden did not have any emotions on his face and said coldly, “It is difficult to show a treasure priced at tens of thousands Xuanming points to people who are not exchanging for it. Do you have forty Xuanming points?”

The warden’s attitude was neither cold nor warm, and his words were indeed by the rules.

“No.” Ye Qingtang replied honestly.

The warden’s expression turned even more indifferent.

He showed those swords to Ye Qingtang previously because he thought that Ye Qingtang had enough Xuanming points in her hands and made an exception. However, now…

Ye Qingtang had spent her Xuanming points away a long time ago. How was she able to fork out forty Xuanming points?

Although the warden heard the news of Ye Qingtang participating in the inner sect assessment, being stationed at the Xuanming Pavilion, he never paid much attention to the events in the inner sect assessment. Yet, honestly speaking, he did not believe that a new disciple who just entered the sect was able to top the Excellence Roll.

Now that Ye Qingtang did not have any Xuanming points and was unable to achieve the number one position, she obviously did not have the qualifications to look at the Demonic Blood Sword, which costs tens of thousands Xuanming points.

“Since you don’t have enough Xuanming points, I cannot show you the Demonic Blood Sword according to the rules. If you want to get a weapon you like, according to the amount of Xuanming points you have, you can choose from here.” The warden pointed at the weapons displayed in the open that were priced at the thousands, clearly not paying her too much attention.

However, there were weird expressions on the surrounding disciple’s faces at the sight, and they reckoned that the warden probably had not heard of the results of the inner sect assessment.

Qin Huan was a little dissatisfied to see the warden’s attitude, yet since he was after all a warden, Qin Huan was in no place to speak.

Ye Qingtang had an indifferent expression on her face though. She looked at the warden who was already beginning to be impatient and said slowly, “I do not have forty thousand Xuanming points, but… it should be fine if I use this, right?” Then, Ye Qingtang took out the scroll that Elder Qin gave her and placed it on the counter.

The warden who was initially still idle looked at the golden scroll on the table. The casual expression on his face instantly froze and broke apart. He suddenly straightened himself and stared at the scroll in surprised.

“Is it fine?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The warden did not reply to Ye Qingtang immediately and carefully read the scroll.

[First in the inner sect entrance assessment. Eligible to exchange any treasure below fifty thousand Xuanming Points in the Xuanming Pavilion.]

And the words ‘Ye Qingtang’ were glaringly written on the blank for the name of the number one position!

The warden’s eyes almost popped out, and he was only this close to burning a hole in that scroll.
