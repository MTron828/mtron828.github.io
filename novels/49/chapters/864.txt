Chapter 865 The Plot

At one of the ridges in the Dragon Vein after a few days.

Ling Yan’s eyes that seemed to contain the entire universe were filled with smiles.

The midget stood beside respectively but did not say anything.

“Thank you, Your Highness. The Execution Sect will not be facing any problems in the short future. I have no idea why that the Crown Prince summoned the President of the Supreme Academy and tried to assassinate him. Though he managed to escape, he was injured heavily. The Crown Prince sent military forces secretly to attack a few base camps of the Supreme Academy…” A virtual image of an elder appeared beside Ling Yan.

Ling Yan smiled and said, “The Execution Sect will have time to recover.”

Excitement filled the elder’s face. Though he did not know why the Crown Prince would suddenly attempt to assassinate the President of the Supreme Academy, he understood that this was done by Ling Yan based on his confident look. However, he would never be able to know how Ling Yan managed to do that.

“Thank you, Your Highness. If you did not lend us a helping hand, the Execution Sect would not have been able to survive another attack from the Supreme Academy,” the elder said with graciousness.

The elder added. “Your Highness, since the Crown Prince also targeted the Supreme Academy and the President was injured, I suggest that the Execution Sect can take the initiative and attack the Supreme Academy!”

However, Ling Yan shook his head and said, “No… Instead, I want you to help the Supreme Academy.”

“Arh?!”

The elder was stunned after hearing Ling Yan’s words. The Supreme Academy was a strong opponent. Why should they help them when they had the chance to kill them?

“Yes. The Crown Prince is always very suspicious about everything. If you help them this time, the Crown Prince will believe that the Supreme Academy has sided with me. No matter how the Supreme Academy tries to explain in the future, the Crown Prince will never trust them anymore… The only path that is left for the Supreme Academy is to side with me wholeheartedly.”

“Brilliant… No one else will be able to think of such a strategy, Your Highness!” The elder exclaimed.

“Go ahead.” As Ling Yan waved his hand, the virtual image of the elder disappeared.

The midget sized up his master. He could plan everything without any flaw…

The sword that he warded off for Miss Ye had resulted in so many chain reactions. Besides saving Miss Ye’s life, he saved the Execution Sect from the desperate situation under the attack from the Supreme Academy. He even broke the relationship between the suspicious Crown Prince and the President of the Supreme Academy. It was even possible to recruit the Supreme Academy under him…

Everything was just the result of the sword that Ling Yan warded off for Miss Ye.

What was more terrifying was that none of these were planned by Ling Yan before. The prehistoric dried corpse existed in the Dragon Vein. Even Ling Yan could not control its appearance and whether it would attack Miss Ye…

However, Ling Yan could instantly seize the opportunity that normal people would even notice. Then, he achieved a series of things at the next instant…

The midget could not help but take a cold breath.

It was lucky that he was Ling Yan’s henchman. If he was the Crown Prince’s henchman…

“Your Highness, Perfected Gu Yun will definitely try to kill Miss Ye. Do we need to protect her?” The midget looked towards Ling Yan and asked.

Ling Yan shook his head and said, “He will definitely try to kill her, but Miss Ye has three Arcane Supremacies following her with the little white tiger… It’s disappointing if he does not do anything… He’s been fated to die ever since I brought him over.”
