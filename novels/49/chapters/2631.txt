Chapter 2632 Han Cangming’s Ambush (3)

Soon after, Ye Qingtang walked into the deep pit. She had already decided that she would leave immediately if there were any abnormal movements. This was to ensure that she would not suffer an undeserved catastrophe. Even in his current state, the Heavenly Emperor was still extremely powerful. He had just casually slain several Emperor-level practitioners with barely any discernible movement. From that alone, it was clear how terrifying he was. As the saying goes, a starving camel is still bigger than a horse.

Although Ye Qingtang was not far from the Heavenly Emperor, she spent a good half an hour slowly approaching him.

Upon closer inspection, the Heavenly Emperor had indeed fainted. He was lying bare-chested in the deep pit and his long hair, which was covered in blood, hung loosely. Even so, he still exuded a faint suppressive aura.

Although Ye Qingtang knew that it was impossible for anything to happen to the Heavenly Emperor, she was still worried. “Is this the power of the Heavenly Tribulation…”

Ye Qingtang stared at the Heavenly Emperor and frowned.

The Heavenly Emperor’s body contained an extremely large amount of destructive energy. It seemed that it was also because of this energy that although the Heavenly Emperor’s physique was extremely powerful, he was unable to self-heal quickly.

Ye Qingtang placed her palm gently on the Heavenly Emperor’s back. This destructive force might be unbearable for the Heavenly Emperor, but it was extremely nutritious for Ye Qingtang

Actually, Ye Qingtang was not interested in the Heavenly Emperor’s destructive force at all. However, her Heavenly Demon Bloodline was salivating for it. Moreover, if she did not remove this destructive energy from the Heavenly Emperor’s body, even if the Heavenly Emperor recovered in the future, it would leave behind a hidden malady.

Killing two birds with one stone. Why not?

Without any hesitation, Ye Qingtang immediately activated the power of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her body and began to absorb the destructive force in the Heavenly Emperor’s body. As the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline devoured the power of destruction, Ye Qingtang could feel its joy. About an hour later, Ye Qingtang’s entire body was soaked in a cold sweat. It was difficult for Ye Qingtang’s body to withstand the process of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline absorbing this destructive force.

Ye Qingtang stared at the Heavenly Emperor meaningfully.

Just this residual destructive energy was already very difficult for her to handle. It was impossible to imagine how the Heavenly Emperor had managed to block the full power of the Heavenly Tribulation. In fact, if not for the shadow behind that thundercloud suddenly attacking him, the Heavenly Emperor might have already completed his so-called ascension.

Just as she finished absorbing all the destructive energy from the Heavenly Emperor’s body, Ye Qingtang accidentally activated her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline and was about to devour the Heavenly Emperor’s original energy. Ye Qingtang hurriedly withdrew the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. If she allowed it to continue, both she and the Heavenly Emperor would be in big trouble.

All in all Ye Qingtang was rather helpless. This Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was completely different from the Divine Phoenix Bloodline. It was an extreme manifestation of overbearingness and wanted to devour the heavens and the earth. Previously, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was too weak to have so many tricks up its sleeves. But now, the Heavenly Demon Bloodline had become more powerful and it no longer had any restraints.
