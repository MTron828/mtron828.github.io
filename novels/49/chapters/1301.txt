Chapter 1302: A Conspiracy (1)

“Just as you say, Miss Ye.” Ling Yan said good-naturedly.

Ye Qingtang felt that she was quickly running out of things to say.

She should not worry about him.

Before Ling Yan could continue, Ye Qingtang switched off the voice transmission stone. She inwardly despised herself for worrying over nothing.

So far, she had not yet met anyone who could get the best of Ling Yan.

When she thought of that, Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to pursue her train of thought any further. However, she was not sure what the Temple of Shadows would do in this fight to help the Eldest Prince be Crown Prince. If she made the slightest mistake, she might expose herself. Then, she need not worry about helping Ling Yan because they would both be dead.

Ye Qingtang fell asleep midway through her thoughts.

Shortly after Ye Qingtang got up the next morning, she understood why Ling Yan had been so calm yesterday.

At that moment, the Eldest Prince was sitting despondently in the hall. Ming Gu and Lady Ghost, with Ye Qingtang in tow, walked into the hall together, only to see the Eldest Prince and Princess sitting there gloomily.

“I didn’t expect our Royal Father to place so much importance on our Third Royal Brother.” The Eldest Prince frowned deeply with an irritated expression on his face.

Ye Qingtang did not know what had happened in the night, but she clearly sensed the Eldest Prince’s annoyance.

“Guardian Lady Ghost, my Eldest Royal Brother investigated Ling Yan’s situation yesterday, and…” the Eldest Princess said with a frown. She recounted the results of the Eldest Prince’s investigations.

Ling Yan skills were average, and no one took any notice of them. He was most widely praised for his intelligence. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Eldest Prince wanted to target Ling Yan’s poor skills and secretly sent men to kill Ling Yan. But the next morning, he received the news.

After yesterday’s banquet, the Eternal Emperor sent his personal elite group of powerful cultivators to Ling Yan’s residence. He said that he was providing Ling Yan with more attendants, but in reality, each of these was more powerful than the next. He had clearly sent them to protect Ling Yan!

Even the Eldest Prince’s powerful cultivators were no match for the Eternal Emperor’s men.

“Your Royal Father is not a stupid monarch. He did not say much about the Fourth Prince’s death, but he knew what happened. Now that Ling Yan has been recently made Crown Prince, he will not allow another tragedy to happen. So he’s prepared,” Lady Ghost said as she rested a finger on her chin.

“It won’t be easy to kill Ling Yan with these people around. Unless…” The Eldest Princess’s gaze involuntarily turned towards Lady Ghost.

The Temple of Shadows was immensely powerful. The Eldest Prince and Princess’s men might not be able to deal with the situation, but the Temple of Shadows certainly could.

“No.” The Eldest Prince refused the Eldest Princess’s suggestion outright before Lady Ghost could even speak.

“The powerful cultivators from the Temple of Shadows would be detected too easily if they were to act.”

Everyone from the Temple of Shadows was from the Undead Clan. Their moves could clearly be identified.

The Eldest Princess frowned, but at that moment, a servant suddenly announced that the Second Princess, Ling Yue was at the door.

When they heard the news, the Eldest Prince and Princess immediately knew what was going on.

The Second Princess had probably reached the same conclusions as they did.

The Second Princess was rapidly invited to enter.

Ye Qingtang watched as Ling Yan’s three siblings gathered. They were clearly conspiring to kill Ling Yan.

Someone…

Really induced hatred.
