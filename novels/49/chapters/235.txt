The huge monster let out a low growl and slowly opened its mouth, revealing a crooked row of teeth that was as sharp as that of a beast’s. It raised the hand which held the heart as its scarlet eyes glanced across the dead Xuanling Sect disciple. Suddenly, it widened its blood-soaked mouth, ripping the fresh heart into pieces and swallowing it down. Blood spurted out and spattered all over the decomposed flesh on its body.

It applied force in the hand which held the disciple, and its five fingers pierced the disciple’s flesh, penetrating through his body which was still warm. In the blink of an eye, the disciple’s flesh shriveled rapidly at a visible speed, and his body turned into a horrifying dried corpse.

After swallowing the heart and absorbing the essence, there was a tiny change to the monster’s body. The rotting flesh all over its body dropped to its feet in chunks, and its blood-stained hands were gradually covered by new flesh…

Zhou Xuan stared at the monster which suddenly appeared and trembled in fear uncontrollably.

What exactly is this?!

What kind of scary monster did Spirit Condensation Mountain Village revive!

At that instant, Zhou Xuan clearly felt a sense of fear creeping from the bottom of his heart.

“What is that…” Lin Long’s eyes widened in disbelief as she watched the monster that was similar to a decomposed body. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

That thing was way beyond her knowledge!

“It is an evil spirit.” After kicking the oncoming enemies away, Ye Qingtang glanced across at the evil spirit which was in the process of resurrection.

The evil spirit buried under Juling Mountain was originally a member of the Blood Moon Sect. The evil cultivation technique which they cultivated allowed them to offer souls to the evil god, thus obtaining almost immortality.

The evil spirit had already swallowed the vitality of the over three hundred people outside Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, and now it absorbed the essence of two sect disciples consecutively…

Ye Qingtang’s chest tightened. Her current skills were simply not enough to fight against such a powerful evil spirit.

“Senior Sister Lin, we must fight our way out. Otherwise… we will end up in the same state as Senior Brother Lin,” Ye Qingtang muttered.

Lin Long’s forehead was long covered with cold sweat. After sucking dry the essence of the disciple in its hand, the evil spirit threw the shriveled, dried corpse aside, and its scarlet eyes were already fixed on them!

Lin Long’s grip on the sword tightened. For the sake of survival, she could only risk her life and fight it tooth and nail!

Ye Qingtang and Lin Long joined hands, and with such cooperation, they slowly moved towards the exit of the hall. However, the evil spirit had already walked down the stairs and was walking towards where they were at.

As the evil spirit descended from the stairs, respect filled Wu Chengze’s eyes. He knelt on the floor devotedly and bowed at the nauseating evil spirit in worship while singing praises,

“Master, please accept the strength that we have offered. May this allow you to resurrect…”

Ye Qingtang looked at Wu Chengze from the corner of her eyes, and her eyes sharpened for a moment. She immediately gave Lin Long a look. Understanding Ye Qingtang’s intention, Lin Long executed quick moves with her sword while Ye Qingtang used this time when Lin Long was holding back the masses to dart to the back of Wu Chengze. Before Wu Chengze could react…

Ye Qingtang grabbed Wu Chengze by his hair, lifting him up violently, and then held her blood-stained sword against his neck.
