Chapter 2329: Trust (1)

“I don’t think that Yun Chen is inferior to the other medicine faculty students,” Ye Qingtang replied in a mild tone.

She had taught him herself and was well aware of his skill level.

Song Yanhan and all the other medicine faculty students were stunned by Ye Qing’s claim.

Yun Chen was not inferior to them?

Was Teacher Ye a fool?

Some of the medicine faculty students had come over just to watch a good show. But now, they couldn’t help feeling somewhat speechless.

“Is this teacher joking? What kind of standard is Yun Chen?”

“He must be joking. This teacher is new and has only been here a few months. He majors in martial arts, why in the world was Yun Chen assigned to him?”

“What? A martial arts teacher teaching elixir refinement? Are you kidding me? Can he refine elixirs? Does he know what alchemy is? He knows nothing and yet he dares to make such audacious claims here.”

“Refine elixirs? He must be able to tell the difference between the various herbs first.”

“Why did this person reject Song Yanhan? I think he must be teaching elixir refinement the same way as martial arts. He has no idea of the disparity between Song Yanhan and Yun Chen. It’s as wide as heaven and earth.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“This is alchemy, what does it have to do with a martial arts teacher? Coming over here to make a fool of himself.”

The medicine faculty students were disgusted by Ye Qing’s fake attitude of expertise. He was just a layman at best, how dare he stand before them and judge the skill level of the students here?

Song Yanhan raised his brow slightly before he glanced at Yun Chen. “Oh? I am afraid this is your own opinion. With Yun Chen’s abilities, it would be difficult for him to be selected for the Inter-Academy Competition. Even if Qin Feng and the others partner with him, he might not qualify for the competition anyway. If that were to happen, Qin Feng and the others would lose their chance to compete. Teacher Ye… is this really what’s ‘best’ for your students?”

Song Yanhan’s words were extremely harsh. He was more or less trampling Yun Chen’s name into the mud. But the surrounding students all felt that there was nothing wrong with what he said.

In their eyes, Yun Chen was not fit to stay on in the medicine faculty anyway. Let alone the fact that Ye Qing was a martial arts teacher. What could he possibly teach Yun Chen?

Ye Qingtang looked at Song Yanhan. “Who said Yun Chen won’t qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition?”

Song Yanhan smiled.

“If Yun Chen can enter the Inter-Academy Competition, it will only be because every single medicine faculty student is automatically qualified. Teacher Ye, alchemy is not as simple as you think. The refinement of elixirs is not just a matter of throwing a bunch of herbs together.”

Ye Qingtang gazed impassively at Song Yanhan as she observed Yun Chen from the corner of her eye.

Yun Chen had remained silent right from the start. It was like he was already used to all the insults and ridicule. That gentle, nonchalant smile remained on his face. But it was exactly that smile that made Ye Qingtang’s heart ache.

“I don’t know about the others, but Yun Chen is guaranteed to qualify,” Ye Qingtang repeated.

Song Yanhan frowned slightly at Ye Qing’s words. Just as he was about to say something, an aged voice rang out.

“Yanhan, have you not settled the matter yet?” An elder with a long white beard strolled through the crowd.

All the students in the medicine faculty immediately stepped back respectfully and made way for the elder.
