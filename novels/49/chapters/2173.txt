Chapter 2174: 10 Days (1)

Ten days passed in the blink of an eye.

Qin Feng arrived promptly at the agreed time and location to find that Lei Yan was already there. Apart from Lei Yan, Ye Qingtang, Jing Ze and the rest were also already there.

“Qin Feng looks like he is in a bad mood today. Do you think he will take this opportunity to beat me to death?” Lei Yan really felt like crying now. Especially after he scanned the arena and realized that quite a number of other students had gathered nearby.

The sight made him feel like breaking down into a blubbering heap.

All his nemeses were present and accounted for. The Leiting family teenagers were also here. They were staring at Lei Yan in exasperation.

Qin Feng’s powers might have declined but he was still at the Paragon Eighth Heaven level. Within the Netherworld Academy, he was still considered at least above average.

Meanwhile, Lei Yan was a sub-par piece of garbage. But he still dared to challenge Qin Feng?

Ten moves?

What a joke.

A disparity of two whole levels. That alone was enough to completely subdue Lei Yan.

“I... I feel a bit dizzy. Boss... what should I do?” Lei Yan usually put on a swaggering front, but inwardly, he knew very well that he could not defeat anyone. Now seeing the cool-faced Qin Feng, and thinking of his stupid actions a few days ago, he was suddenly worried that he would die here today. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Ye Qingtang was full of disdain at the sight of the whimpering Lei Yan.

“Wipe the snot from your nose.”

Lei Yan sniffled.

“Just do exactly what I told you earlier,” Ye Qingtang instructed.

Lei Yan recalled Ye Qing’s earlier instructions. A wave of fear washed over his heart. Taking a deep breath, he finally walked forward.

The spectators’ excitement and curiosity surged at the sight of Lei Yan stepping forward.

“Seriously? Is Lei Yan going for real this time? Is he really going to fight against Qin Feng? Does he have a death wish?”

“Lei Yan has always been a fool. But I find it strange that Qin Feng is involved in this. He knows Lei Yan is no match for him. Why did he agree to fight Lei Yan?”

“Do you think he is still the Qin Feng of before? His powers have declined tremendously. By now, he might not even be able to defeat Lei Yan.”

“Tsk tsk, a former prodigy has fallen so far.”

Some of the spectators had come to see Lei Yan make a fool of himself. The others had come to witness Qin Feng’s “fall”.

This bunch of teenagers was full of youth and vigor. They were naturally drawn to anything that could offer some excitement and entertainment.

Lei Yan was already used to the mockery of outsiders. He was now fully focused on Qin Feng.

But Qin Feng’s eyes dimmed when he heard those mocking words. He would remain a laughingstock no matter the outcome of this fight.

Qin Feng glanced at Ye Qing, who was standing by the side. His slight frown revealed his displeasure.

“Qin Feng, ten moves. Just ten moves, alright...” Lei Yan stood in front of Qin Feng. He was very worried that Qin Feng might take the opportunity to sneak in a few more attacks.

Qin Feng had already lost his patience. Both Lei Yan and Teacher Ye were like clowns to him. He had enough of them.

“Let’s go,” Qin Feng snapped coldly.

Lei Yan quietly swallowed and nodded.

Qin Feng struck out in the very next second, startling Lei Yan.

A powerful light engulfed Qin Feng as if he was immersed in a holy light.

The spectators were stunned by the sight of Qin Feng enveloped in the holy light.

“Light Stream! Lei Yan is using his killer move right from the start? Lei Yan is doomed!”

Light Stream was one of the Qin family’s elite moves!
