Han Cangming stood quietly in the air and stared at the Paragon. The corners of his lips curled up slightly as he said softly, “There’s no need for any reason to kill. I feel like killing you so I will. This reason is sufficient.”

The Paragon nodded at Han Cangming, “This reason is enough for me too.”

“Sister Ah Yao…” Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the Paragon and she said softly,” Be careful. This person’s skills are unfathomable. Why don’t we join forces?”

The Paragon shook her head. “Sister Ye Yue, with your skills, it’s better if you don’t interfere.”

Ye Qingtang still wanted to say something, but seeing the Paragon’s determined attitude, Ye Qingtang finally nodded.

...

“Since you want to take my life, go ahead and make your move. Coincidentally, I have never fought with an Immortal Emperor from the Divine Venerate Domain,” said the Paragon to Han Cangming.

“Good.” Han Cangming smiled. As he spoke, he raised his right arm slightly and pointed at the void in front of him.

Golden flames blotted out the sky as they surged towards the Paragon, forming a terrifying sea of flames.

The Paragon stared at the sea of flames. She did not say anything and just stood where she was. As Ye Qingtang watched, the Paragon did not resist at all until she was completely engulfed by the sea of fire.

After an unknown period of time, the sea of flames gradually dissipated, but the Paragon was already gone.

“Sister Ah Yao?”

Ye Qingtang frowned and looked around.

The aura of the Paragon had completely disappeared as if she had never existed. Ye Qingtang could not understand. Even if it was the Demon God Han Cangming, it was impossible for him to annihilate an Immortal Emperor with just one move.

But then the Paragon suddenly appeared in front of Han Cangming. Without any warning, she threw a punch at Han Cangming.

“Bang!”

A loud sound that shook the air echoed in all directions. The Paragon and Han Cangming’s fists collided, causing the entire space to tremble.

“You are indeed an Immortal Emperor from the Divine Venerate Domain. Your reaction is extraordinary.” The Paragon looked at Han Cangming expressionlessly.

The corners of Han Cangming’s lips curled up slightly when he heard the Paragon’s words. He smiled at her. “The Space Technique does live up to its reputation.”

“Space Technique?!”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Paragon. She suddenly remembered that the most

terrifying thing about the Paragon was not her martial art skills but her Space Technique. It was said that she was the first person in history to completely integrate the Space Technique into her body and reach the peak of creation. She could fuse with space at will and even transmigrate.

“The Space Technique is powerful but it might not be enough to defeat me.’ Han Cangming continued.

“Is that so... Since you are so confident, why don’t you give it a try?” the Paragon asked.

Swoosh..

In the blink of an eye, two astonishing glowing lights shot out of Han

Cangming’s eyes. They were filled with endless destructive power as they shot towards the Paragon who was mere inches away..
