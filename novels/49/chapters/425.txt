Chapter 426: The Competition (5)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Feng Yiran from Wind Moon Sect is already defeated. As long as Senior Brother Zhu can win against Fu Lingtian, our Xuanling Sect will definitely place in the first in this Three Sect Competition.”

The disciples felt an upsurge in emotion. This concerned the sect’s glory, and if Zhu Changge won, all of them who participated in the competition would glow. They clenched their fists tightly and screamed to cheer for Zhu Changge.

Looking at how the Xuanling Sect disciples behaved as though victory was at hand, Ye Qingtang from aside, however, did not smile at all.

Zhu Changge could win against Fu Lingtian?

Ye Qingtang could not help but shake her head quietly. From the current situation, Zhu Changge seemed to have the upper hand, but this was only seemingly...

Given Zhu Changge’s comprehension of the Moonlight Steps Swordplay Technique, there should not be a problem in fighting a normal disciple at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. However, Fu Lingtian’s true abilities were far from this. The sword shadows that Zhu Changge created were simply unable to confuse an opponent above Martial Qi Level Two. The disadvantageous position that Fu Lingtian held currently was merely an intentional act of his.

She had to say though that Fu Lingtian’s acting was extremely skillful, and even all the elders below the ring could not tell his true level of skill.

However...

Fu Lingtian definitely would not really lose to Zhu Changge. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes as she focused on the ring.

Zhu Changge was on the offense continuously and used the Moonlight Steps Swordplay Technique to restrict all of Fu Lingtian’s attacks. As he saw that Fu Lingtian was in passivity, delight emerged within Zhu Changge.

If he could win against Fu Lingtian in front of everyone, he would definitely receive a huge reward when he returned to Xuanling Sect.

At that thought, Zhu Changge was even more spirited, and his attacks were increasingly sharp.

Fu Lingtian looked at Zhu Changge, who suddenly quickened and sharpened his attacks, with a heavy expression. However, there was a sneer in his narrowed eyes, and an undetectable impatience swept across his eyes.

How dare a mere Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One act so proudly before me?

Fu Lingtian’s eyes changed.

Zhu Changge did not sense Fu Lingtian’s change and attacked with full force.

But just as he spun and waved his sword, Fu Lingtian suddenly escaped from Zhu Changge’s attack range with a flash when Zhu Changge was striking back. Once Zhu Changge was ready to attack again, Fu Lingtian sprinted to the back of Zhu Changge and slashed his sword across Zhu Changge’s waist before he could react in time!

In a moment, blood dripped down from Zhu Changge’s waist.

His white clothes were stained red by the blood.

Never did Zhu Changge expect Fu Lingtian to suddenly change his moves and seize an interval to attack him.

Under the pain, Zhu Changge’s movements paused for a moment, and it was in this instant where Fu Lingtian sprung up and kicked the wound at Zhu Changge’s waist repeatedly. Blood gushed out as Fu Lingtian stamped on the cut. Zhu Changge was kicked to the edge of the ring, and although he had not fallen off the ring, there was already a pool of blood below him, and his face was beaded with cold sweat from the pain.

The smile on Elder Lin’s face froze at this instant.

He originally thought that Zhu Changge could defeat Fu Lingtian at that moment and did not expect... Fu Lingtian was actually able to see through Zhu Changge’s approach and grasp a chance to deliver a fatal blow.
