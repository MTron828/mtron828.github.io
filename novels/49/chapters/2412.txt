“This monster… doesn’t look like the one who attacked the Netherworld Academy team…” One of the teachers muttered with eyes widened in shock. His statement was like the straw which broke the camel’s back. The entire hall was engulfed in dead silence.

It only meant that there was more than one monster that was above the Emperor level inside the Wailing Well…

And Lu Yuanxiang’s teleportation talisman was not the only faulty one.

“Damn it, what the hell is happening!”

“What are those Universe City idiots trying to do!”

“We cannot let them remain inside the Wailing Well. If they encounter those monsters… none of them will make it out alive.”

At this point, everyone realized just how serious things were. This year’s Inter-Academy Competition was clearly a trap.

But why would the Universe City people do this?

“Send men to search every inch of Universe City. We need to know why they are doing this. And what exactly is going on in the Wailing Well.” The Sky Martial Academy Vice-President’s face was grim.

The other academy leaders agreed and immediately dispatched their own men to investigate the situation inside the city, to try and find some clues.

“We need to find a way to get them out,” Wen Qi started with a frown. Having seen what happened to the Heaven Dome Academy team, Wen Qi realized that Lu Yuanxiang’s team was already considered rather lucky. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But this kind of luck would not repeat itself.

“Those above-Emperor level monsters seem to have only recently appeared?” someone asked.

The team competition was nearing the end and there had been no sign of any monsters which were beyond Emperor level. But today, there were two consecutive sightings. Lu Yuanxiang’s team was the first batch to encounter such a monster, and that monster seemed to have just burrowed out from underground.

Soon after, the Heaven Dome Academy team encountered an above-Emperor level monster which was clearly moving freely above ground. As a result, their outcome was much worse.

“Do you mean that these above-Emperor level monsters only appeared today?”

“I am not sure, but it certainly feels like it. Moreover… I have a bad feeling about this. Two such monsters have already appeared and we don’t know just how many of them are in the Wailing Well. Also, the first two monsters are of different species…”

As they continued to analyze the situation and come up with their own conjectures, the situation seemed to become increasingly dire.

Was this an accident? Or was this intentionally caused by someone?

If it was an accident, why had the Universe City people all disappeared? Why were the teleportation talismans not working?

If it was intentional… which terrifying character came up with such a bold plan to scheme against the top academies? How did this formidable person manage to control these above-Emperor level monsters?

The current state of affairs was extremely dire. Even more depressing was the fact that the academy leaders had no way to communicate this information to the teams inside the Wailing Well.

Still in the dark, those oblivious teams had no idea of the danger they were in. They still thought it was a normal team competition.

Everyone in the hall knew very well what would happen toward the last stage of the team competition.

“We must find an exit out of the Wailing Well immediately. Try to find some way to communicate with the people inside. We cannot let them start fighting each other!” Wen Qi clenched his fists.

“I am afraid we can’t contact them,” the Cold Cloud Academy’s Zhan Yunzhou said with a deep sigh.
