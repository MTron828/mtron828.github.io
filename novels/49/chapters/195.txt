“…” Qin Huan’s lips twitched as he looked at Ye Qingtang, and his head was about to explode.

Sh*t!

Tong Hua this scoundrel screwed him!

“So it’s Junior Sister Ye… Ha… ha… What a coincidence…” Qin Huan said as he broke out in a cold sweat. How he wished he could hang Tong Hua, who called him over, on a tree and hammer him.

Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly and swept a meaningful look at Qin Huan.

Qin Huan only felt a gush of cold air behind his back, and the smile on his face broke into pieces.

Tong Hua looked strangely at the frozen Qin Huan and had not sensed that Qin Huan became strange suddenly as he asked curiously. “Junior Brother Qin, do you know this little junior sister?”

Qin Huan put on a smile that was uglier than a cry and nodded tragically. “She is… Junior Sister Ye… Why would I not know her…”

Was it too late for him to leave now?

Tong Hua nodded slowly and did not notice Qin Huan’s expression which read “I want to die right now” and said uprightly, “That’s good then. Qin Huan, help me persuade this junior sister. There is not much use if she buys these Spirit Crystals back. If she likes them, it’s fine for me… to gift some to her. These Xuanming points cannot be anyhow spent, especially new disciples.”

Tong Hua persuaded earnestly.

If not for the fact that Qin Huan could not defeat Tong Hua, he really wanted to box this fool to death.

New disciples’ Xuanming points could not be anyhow spent?

That applied to others but not Ye Qingtang, who was a tycoon.

He personally witnessed Ye Qingtang cheerfully taking the head of a villain on the Assassination Roll to claim her reward after receiving over sixty Xuanming points from the Giant Lizard mission.

Qin Huan really wanted to tell Tong Hua that he was worried for the wrong person and that the number of Xuanming points in Ye Qingtang’s hands was more than both of theirs added together.

However, a wise man would submit to the circumstances. Qin Huan simply did not bother about Tong Hua’s persuasion and looked straight at Ye Qingtang. “Junior Sister Ye likes this Spirit Crystal? You should have said earlier. I have known Senior Brother Tong for a long time, and I can let him sell them at a cheaper price. I see that there’s quite a number of Spirit Crystals, how about I help you to carry them back?” Qin Huan smiled in an extremely suck-up manner.

After personally witnessing Ye Qingtang’s powers, he did not dare to offend such a fierce junior sister. Furthermore… Ye Qingtang’s fire-resistant soft armor even saved his life. Who knew how many more treasures this little junior sister had. He really had to sweet talk her and offer his assistance the best he could.

Tong Hua was dumbfounded…

He clearly got Qin Huan over to persuade Ye Qingtang. Why did he suddenly betray him?!

Ye Qingtang chuckled at the suck-up Qin Huan and said, “Senior Brother Qin’s price is very low already, and it doesn’t need to be lowered further. However, if Senior Brother Qin is free, I can approve your request to help me move my things.”

Tong Hua already said previously that if Ye Qingtang wanted, he could sell two Spirit Crystals at one Xuanming point. This price was already shockingly low, and Ye Qingtang was not the type to squeeze money out of others. No matter what, she would not go overboard.

“No problem! Leave it to me!” Qin Huan did not care that his manly image was broken at that very point. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

His suck-up behavior completely confused Tong Hua.

“Senior Brother Tong, pack the Spirit Crystals. I’ll carry them back for Junior Sister Ye,” Qin Huan said.

Tong Hua was really on the verge of tears. Why did the help that he found turn to help Ye Qingtang in urging him instead?
