Chapter 2007: Working Together (2)

“May I know the reason for your visit? You have already gotten the Netherworld Ring back, correct?” Ye Qingtang remained composed while looking at them, acting like she was puzzled.

She wasn’t supposed to know anything.

The corners of Bai Zhi’s lips twitched. She didn’t say a word and just looked at the person in black robes.

The person in black robes spoke. “You disappeared ten thousand years ago without giving any reason and the Crimson League removed the Temple of Shadows from the league. Ten thousand years later, the Temple of Shadows is no longer under the Crimson League. However taking into consideration your sincerity towards the Crimson League, the League Chief is willing to accept the Temple of Shadows again.”

It took only three days for the Crimson League to completely fall out with the Ancient You Clan. The Ancient You Clan hadn’t returned the Netherworld Ring and the League Chief of the Crimson League was very displeased.

It was inevitable, be it for the Netherworld Ring, or to uphold the Crimson League’s dignity.

The Crimson League’s main powers were concentrated in the Second Domain, it wasn’t appropriate to make such a big move just to act against a First Domain power.

This was the reason why the Crimson League’s Chief ordered the person in black robes to collaborate with the Temple of Shadows.

The Temple of Shadows had a long presence in the Central Mainland and was clear about the Ancient You Clan’s distribution channels. If they worked together, the Crimson League would need to spend fewer resources.

When Ye Qingtang heard the person in black robe’s words, she couldn’t help but laugh inside. They put it in such a pleasant way that others would have thought that the Crimson League was magnanimous to accept the Temple of Shadows again.

They really thought that she didn’t know that it was because of the Netherworld Ring?

Nevertheless...

Ye Qingtang wouldn’t just expose them like that. “Reaccept us into the Crimson League?”

The person in black robes nodded. On the other hand, Bai Zhi’s expression was awful, but she didn’t say a word.

“I appreciate the League Chief’s good intentions. However, the Central Mainland is a mess right now. Furthermore, the Ancient You Clan is very ambitious. We may not even be able to protect ourselves during such times. If we return to the Crimson League, I’m afraid that we will implicate the Central Mainland. I don’t think this will be good...” Ye Qingtang acted as if she wanted to be responsible for herself.

“If you return to the Crimson League, the Temple of Shadows will not fight the Ancient You Clan alone. The Crimson League will not leave you defenseless,” the person in black robes added.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips kicked up. She had been waiting for them to say that.

“If that’s the case, I will accept the League Chief’s good intentions,” Ye Qingtang answered.

The person in black robes nodded.

Ten thousand years after its extrication, the Temple of Shadows returned to the Crimson League. The eight tribe leaders and other important members of the Temple of Shadows smiled when they heard that.

No matter what, it was good news for the Temple of Shadows to return to the Crimson League.

“I reported to the Crimson League about the Ancient You Clan’s intentions, may I know how the investigation is going?” Ye Qingtang suddenly asked.

Bai Zhi’s expression turned even more awful. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The person in black robes kept quiet for a moment. He didn’t try to hide anything.

“We’ve investigated it. You were correct and that’s why the League Chief has confirmed your allegiance to the Crimson League.”

Ye Qingtang laughed. “I surely wouldn’t just make things up. I wasn’t in the position to reveal too much previously, but since I’m back in the Crimson League, I guess I shouldn’t hold back anymore. To be honest, I could already sense that the Ancient You Clan was coming at the Crimson League when they snatched the Netherworld Ring.”

Without any hesitation, Ye Qingtang wasted no time in accusing the Ancient You Clan.

“Why do you say that?” the person in black robes asked.
