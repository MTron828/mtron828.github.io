Chapter 2156: He Must Have Taken Drugs (3)

Zhang Qiqiu turned and charged toward Jing Ze, who retreated and ducked. The onlookers all believed that Jing Ze was only dodging as he had no chance of counterattacking at all.

But Jing Ze’s expression became increasingly shocked.

He could see it...

All of Zhang Qiqiu’s moves. He could see them all clearly.

It was as if Zhang Qiqiu’s speed had slowed down.

No...

It was his own speed that had increased.

Joy surged in Jing Ze’s heart at this discovery. Just at that moment, Zhang Qiqiu unleashed another punch, and Jing Ze remained standing there, unmoving. It was like he had been petrified on the spot. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Oh no, even if Jing Ze doesn’t die today, he’ll end up half-dead.”

“He’s no match for Zhang Qiqiu at all. This is just a one-sided beating.” Everyone was convinced that Jing Ze was dead-meat.

But right before Zhang Qiqiu’s fist landed on Jing Ze, the latter’s head shifted slightly.

The punch brushed past his hair and went right past his head.

Zhang Qiqiu was shocked.

What was going on?

He was so close. How did he manage to dodge?

“Zhang Qiqiu, don’t go easy on him!” Meng Yao cried out impatiently when she realized that Zhang Qiqiu had already launched several attacks, but had yet to defeat that useless Jing Ze.

Zhang Qiqiu’s face darkened. He alone knew that he was not going easy at all. But on second thought, he also realized that he had already attacked several times. In the past, Jing Ze would have already been beaten to the ground. What was going on today?

The more he thought about it, the more frustrated he became. Zhang Qiqiu suddenly hollered and was engulfed in red light. His body instantly doubled in size.

“Sky Rage Bloodline!” The onlookers gasped.

This was Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline. He could activate all the power in his body in a short span of time. His skin and bones were transformed to become as hard as metal, while his strength increased by over 10 times.

The moment he activated his bloodline, Zhang Qiqiu hollered angrily and charged toward Jing Ze.

Still, Jing Ze didn’t move aside but stood his ground with narrowed eyes. As Zhang Qiqiu charged toward him, everything that Ye Qing taught him rushed into his mind. He gathered his energy in his dantian and endured Zhang Qiqiu’s attack, at the same time launching a punch right into Zhang Qiqiu’s chest.

“Boom!”

A loud boom rang out as those two clashed.

But the most startling sight had yet to appear.

Covered in red, Zhang Qiqiu was sent flying into the air by that punch. He was like a kite whose strings had been cut, flying out over a hundred meters before crashing onto the wall of the arena. A huge crater was created in his wake.

Silence descended over the entire arena.

Jing Ze stood there panting. Somehow, his fist was covered in a layer of red light, the same as that on Zhang Qiqiu.

“Argh!” Zhang Qiqiu spurted out a mouthful of fresh blood as he collapsed out from the crater in the wall. He fell onto the ground and twitched a couple of times before he finally stopped moving.

“What... what happened...” The onlookers were all dazed. The scene before them had surpassed all their expectations.

Zhang Qiqiu was the one being sent flying into the air? In contrast, Jing Ze was still standing there completely unharmed...

What the hell!

Jing Ze kept staring at his glowing red fist. Even up until this moment, he had yet to snap out of his trance.

He...

Had sent Zhang Qiqiu flying into the air with one punch? This was something that he had never even dreamed of!

Lei Yan and Nangong Lie were completely thunderstruck.

What kind of joke was this?

Had Jing Ze taken some miracle drug? When did he become so formidable?!
