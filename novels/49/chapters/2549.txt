“Hehe, Miss Ye need not worry about that. Since you are already in the Dragon Emperor Clan, you should rest for a few days.” The middle-aged man looked at Ye Qingtang and chuckled.

Ye Qingtang wanted to say something, but after pondering for a moment, she kept silent. Currently, she did not have any bargaining power. Rather than waste her breath displeasing others, she might as well shut her mouth and take things one step at a time. Presumably, a major faction like the Dragon Emperor Clan would not deliberately make things difficult for a nameless junior.

“Come.”

A moment later, the white-haired elder gestured for Ye Qingtang to follow him into the Dragon Emperor Clan.

“Long Yun, who is this woman you have brought back?”

A powerful figure guarding the mountain stood in front of her and his cold eyes landed on Ye Qingtang.

However, after sizing her up, the guards were all stunned.

…

Ye Qingtang’s appearance was very similar to Princess Jiu of the Dragon Emperor Clan, Di Jiuyuan. Although they were not exactly the same, her mannerisms were also very similar to Di Jiuyuan.

“This girl’s appearance is really too similar to Boss… If not for the fact that Boss has already found her two children, I would really think that this girl was one of her children,” one of the mountain guardians said after scrutinizing Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang frowned at his words.

If she had not misheard, the guard said that Di Jiuyuan’s children had been found by the Dragon Emperor Clan…

“Heh, Long Yun, this girl looks very similar to Princess Jiu. Where did you find her?” Another guard chuckled.

“Open the door,” the white-haired elder said impatiently.

The guards opened the mountain gate together and the white-haired elder led Ye Qingtang and the rest in with large strides. As soon as she entered the clan, Ye Qingtang saw several huge sculptures in the middle. Each sculpture was about a hundred meters tall and nearly reached the clouds.

“Hahahaha.”

Suddenly, one of the “sculptures” laughed out loud. Its huge eyes looked at the white-haired elder as it let out a deafening and thunderous noise. “Long Yun, what are you doing?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Business.” The white-haired elder looked up at the “statue”.

The “statue” smiled and didn’t continue the conversation.

Ye Qingtang stared at the few huge “sculptures” in front of her and was slightly surprised. She originally thought that they were sculptures built by the Dragon Emperor Clan and did not expect them to be living creatures.

Seeing Ye Qingtang’s confusion, the middle-aged man smiled and said, “These are all the Dragon Emperor Clan’s guardian weapons.”

“Weapons?” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. She had never seen a weapon that could speak. It looked like a race of giants. However, no matter how big the giant race was, it was impossible for them to grow to such an extent.

“Senior, these should be considered confidential information of the Dragon Emperor Clan, right? I’m just an outsider. It doesn’t seem appropriate to tell me this.” Ye Qingtang looked at the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man shook his head with a smile. “Even we don’t know the true secrets of the Dragon Emperor Clan. There’s no way a secret would be placed out in the open like that. These are not considered a secret but just an ordinary defense mechanism.”

After hearing what the middle-aged man said, Ye Qingtang could not help but sigh. The Dragon Emperor Clan was a veteran force in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain after all.. To think that even this kind of defense was considered ordinary.
