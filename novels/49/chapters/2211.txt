Chapter 2212: Invitation (5)

Ye Qingtang had checked earlier that the Netherworld Academy would arrange training excursions for students outside of the campus every year, led by teachers.

So her decision was not against the rules.

“Huh? Training excursion? Boss, where are we going? Flaming Valley? Or...” Curious, Nangong Lie listed out several locations. These were all the usual external training grounds frequented by Netherworld Academy students.

Ye Qingtang replied, “You will know in time.”

In bringing these brats out for training, Ye Qingtang could also conduct her own training. It would not be a waste of time.

There was still no news from Di Nuo, but Ye Qingtang was not anxious.

No news from Di Nuo was good news. Otherwise, going by Di Nuo’s fervent desire to drive her out of the Netherworld Academy, he would have already kicked up a huge fuss at the Vice-President’s if the elixir was ineffective.

Like this, Ye Qingtang peacefully stayed at the Vice-President’s over the next few days, guiding those brats in their cultivation.

Time passed day by day. Ye Qingtang still saw no sign of Di Nuo, but Teacher Luo Sheng suddenly approached the Vice-President one day. He had gone to visit Zhang Qiqiu and discovered that his bloodline had already started to recover.

The Vice-President was also very shocked by the turn of events. But since this confirmed that Ye Qing was not just speaking nonsense, he relaxed and allowed Ye Qing to return to the classroom to teach.

That very afternoon after Ye Qingtang regained her freedom, she led the already-prepared Lei Yan and the others out of the academy for their training. Who knew if that scoundrel Di Nuo would try to stir up more trouble. She did not have that much time to waste on him.

Ye Qingtang had just left the Netherworld Academy with those brats of hers when Di Nuo was summoned by the Vice-President.

“How is Zhang Qiqiu’s bloodline?” The Vice-President had already heard from Teacher Luo Sheng and was relieved, but it was still better to hear the details from Di Nuo himself.

Moreover...

The Vice-President was exceptionally curious about this elixir which could heal bloodlines.

“He is slightly more stable now, but has yet to fully recover.” Di Nuo looked rather unhappy. He thought that he could definitely drive Ye Qing out of the Netherworld Academy this time, but he never imagined that she could concoct such an elixir.

To say that Di Nuo was displeased that his plans came to nothing was an understatement.

“As long as there are results, it is a good thing.” The Vice-President nodded. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

One corner of Di Nuo’s lip curled up discreetly. But he maintained a serious manner as he spoke, “Ye Qing’s elixir does have some effect, but this doesn’t deny the fact that he allowed his students to commit such a grave offense. Vice-President, please reconsider if this kind of person is really suitable to remain in our Netherworld Academy...”

“Since Ye Qing came to the Netherworld Academy, many teachers have been discussing if he has the proper qualifications. Although Zhang Qiqiu’s condition has improved slightly, he has yet to fully recover. No one knows if he can ever fully recover...”

The Vice-President replied, “Let’s get Ye Qing to come over and ask him if he can fully recover then.”

Initially, the Vice-President didn’t believe that there were elixirs that could heal bloodlines, but Ye Qing had given him a huge surprise.

Di Nuo was taken aback by the Vice-President’s words.

“Vice-President, Ye Qing is not here?”

The Vice-President replied, “After Teacher Luo Sheng told me about Zhang Qiqiu’s improvement today, I allowed Ye Qing to leave first. His students have been missing him.”

Di Nuo’s expression underwent a major shift.

“Vice-President, how can you let him leave just like that? What if he flees?”
