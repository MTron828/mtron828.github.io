Chapter 2153: Humiliation (3)

It was difficult for one person to fight against a whole group. Jing Ze immediately blocked Mu Ziying with his body, using himself as a shield against those punches and kicks. He bore all the attacks in silence.

“You are pretty resilient. Let me see how long you can endure this. Continue beating him.” Meng Yao knew that the practice arena teacher was away for the moment. This was why she dared to behave so brazenly.

Jing Ze knew he was not their match. All he could do was to stay firm and shield Mu Ziying with his body. Heavy strikes landed on his back endlessly, as if they wanted to hammer his organs to mush.

“Fool, leave... they are here for me.” Mu Ziying struggled to push Jing Ze away but he gritted his teeth and refused to let go.

“Teacher Ye said... you are younger than me and I have to take care of you.” Jing Ze uttered through clenched teeth.

When Mu Ziying just arrived, Ye Qing and Jing Ze were already well-acquainted. So whenever Ye Qing didn’t have the time and Mu Ziying had any queries, she would instruct Jing Ze to take care of Mu Ziying and guide her.

Jing Ze did not forget this point.

The smiles on the crowd dimmed a little at the sight. This was a pure one-sided beating. Several people frowned slightly but kept silent as they didn’t wish to interfere.

“Haul him away.” Meng Yao had lost patience. She didn’t care about Jing Ze. Her target was Mu Ziying.

Tugging and hitting, the teenagers managed to pry Jing Ze’s hands apart and drag Mu Ziying out. Meng Yao noticed with delight that Mu Ziying’s eyes were red.

“What? Does your heart ache?” Meng Yao was in no hurry to beat her. Seeing Mu Ziying’s anxious and angry expression, an idea popped into her head. She gestured at Zhang Qiqiu who immediately understood her meaning. He gave a few vicious punches straight into Jing Ze’s stomach.

Jing Ze instantly spurted out a mouthful of blood.

“Stop it!” Mu Ziying was panicking.

“Stop? Sure. You are shameless right? I will support you. Take off all your clothes, kneel down and kowtow to me three times, then run around the arena once. I will let him off then.” Meng Yao was vindictive and a contemptuous sneer was on her lips.

Everyone was stunned by her words. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Meng Yao was truly vicious!

Mu Ziying was just a young girl. This was way too malicious. She might as well force her to her death.

The words made Mu Ziying pale as the light in her eyes darkened. She moved her five fingers and the puppet in her arms seemed to move. Sizing up the distance between Meng Yao and herself, she wanted to take one step forward. But she was stopped by the two teenagers beside her.

“What? You are unwilling?” Meng Yao smirked and Zhang Qiqiu landed a punch right on Jing Ze’s chin.

“Ugh!” Fresh blood spurted out of Jing Ze’s mouth again.

“I’ll do it!” Mu Ziying suddenly spoke.

Meng Yao smiled.

The onlookers all had varying expressions. Some were still enjoying the spectacle while some were rather disapproving of what was going on.

“Meng...” Lei Yan wanted to speak up again but one of the teenagers from his family clan covered his mouth and dragged him away.

“Don’t talk so much. Meng Yao and Teacher Di Nuo are very close. You’d just be asking for it.”

Lei Yan glared at him.

“Don’t...” Dripping with blood, Jing Ze stared at Mu Ziying as he shook his head vehemently.

Mu Ziying took a deep breath, her finger trembling slightly. She clutched the front of her clothes tightly.
