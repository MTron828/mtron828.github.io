Chapter 661: Who Are You (3)

Ye Qingtang looked down in shock at her empty hand which previously held the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

The Ice Frost Divine Sword was actually taken away by Ning Luo without her sensing anything…

Even more so, Ye Qingtang did not discover Ning Luo making any movements. It was as though the Ice Frost Divine Sword flew into Ning Luo’s hand by itself.

“Ning Luo… who on earth are you exactly…” Ye Qingtang asked with a low voice as she looked at the male on the Buddha statue.

Ye Qingtang could not gauge Ning Luo’s level of skills. She could not even sense any breath when she scanned him carefully. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Who I am is not important to you.” Ning Luo looked at Ye Qingtang without any emotions. “There is a bloodline on your body that I miss. This is also the reason why I did not kill you back then.”

“Bloodline…” Ye Qingtang was in thought. “Are you saying the Immortal and Buddha Bloodline?”

“The so-called Immortal and Buddha Bloodline is merely a concept used by the descendants in general. All the bloodlines of the Fourth Domain belong to the Immortal and Buddha Bloodline… The bloodline of you and her are both from the Fourth Domain.” Ning Luo’s eyes were distant, seeming to be recalling the past memories.

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang was dazed. Regardless of her previous or current life, Ye Qingtang did not have much understanding about the Fourth Domain.

Ye Qingtang originally thought that the so-called Immortal and Buddha Bloodline was merely a general designation of the bloodline from the Fourth Domain. As for whether she and that extraordinary lady shared the same type of bloodline from the Fourth Domain, it was still unknown.

“It seems that you already… know about her from either the Fiendcelestial Beast or grandfather.” Ning Luo smiled faintly at Ye Qingtang.

“F*ck. What did you mention me for… Since you know that I’m a Fiendcelestial Beast, hurry up and bow in respect. Give me whatever good thing you have… I see that the Ice Frost Divine Sword in your hand seems to not be bad…” After hearing that someone mention it, the little white tiger suddenly peeked its head out from Ye Qingtang’s arms and uttered arrogantly.

However, the moment the little white tiger spoke, the surrounding temperature dropped abruptly, and the Ice Frost Divine Sword let out a sword cry for some reason.

Noticing the situation, the little white tiger took a look at the Ice Frost Divine Sword first and then at Ning Luo. “Why? You’re unhappy after I said a few sentences? If you’re unhappy… If you’re unhappy, then treat it as though I did not say anything.”

Ye Qingtang pinched her glabella upon hearing that. She had no idea what to say to this Fiendcelestial Beast anymore.

“Impudent!” Suddenly, the Blood Moon Elder took a step forward and stood in front of Ning Luo. “How dare you speak to my Blood Moon Sect’s Holy Lady like this! You-”

“Get lost!” Ning Luo shouted coldly.

At the same time, the demonized Buddha statue beneath Ning Luo opened its enraged eyes. It looked at the Blood Moon Elder and rammed a punch out.

Before the punch even landed, the air pressure of the punch already blew the Blood Moon Elder several dozens of meters away.

“Holy Lady… that demonized Buddha statue is too powerful. It’s even more powerful than the one in the blood-colored city…” Alarmed, the Blood Moon Elder warned Ye Qingtang frantically.

After hearing it, Ye Qingtang had a grave expression, and she looked at the little white tiger in her arms.

“F*ck you… Don’t look at me… I can’t…” The little white tiger shook its head hurriedly.

“This is no longer the third level.” Ye Qingtang reminded.

“Not the third level? Meaning?” The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang, baffled.

“It means that you can use the demonic aura stored in your body already,” Ye Qingtang sighed.
