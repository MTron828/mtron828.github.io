Chapter 1965: So Filthy (4)

Ye You leveled a fierce glare toward Ye Qingtang, her expression like that of a demon that had just climbed out of hell.

“Ye You, you’re extremely smart, so smart that you’ve been playing everyone in your palms. But you’re selfish as well and are willing to use even your own blood relatives if it means any benefit for you,” Ye Qingtang said slowly.

“Even the Great Elder himself couldn’t predict that the granddaughter he had brought up personally would turn a blind eye to his death.”

Ye Qingtang’s words made Ye You freeze.

Great Elder.

It had been a long time since she had heard that.

This stirred up some memories in Ye You’s mind. She fixed her gaze on Ye Qingtang’s cold eyes.

Suddenlyー

Ye You seemed to have discovered something. She let out a shriek as her glare intensified. She reached out madly, wanting to take off Ye Qingtang’s mask.

Ye Qingtang looked calmly at the savage Ye You. Then she slowly took off the golden mask in front of the downtrodden form collapsed on the ground.

Her beautiful face was revealed to Ye You.

Ye You seemed like she had seen a ghost. A twisted wail squeezed itself out of her throat.

“Ah ah!!”

“Argh!”

She shrieked as she pointed at Ye Qingtang’s face.

“Surprised?” Ye Qingtang looked at the mask in her hand and back at Ye You.

“You managed to calculate everything so carefully but failed to account for the fact that your life would be in the hands of me, whom you stole the spirit root from. Ye You, how do you like this little surprise?”

“Ahhhhhhhhh!” Ye You wailed as her eyes darted towards the door, as though she wanted to attract the attention of the Undead Clan and reveal Ye Qingtang’s true identity.

But she had already lost her tongue and couldn’t form proper words.

“Don’t bother wasting your strength. I’m the Holy Lord of Shadows and I’ve ordered them to stay away. No one will come.” Ye Qingtang smiled as she looked at the pathetic Ye You.

She had thought that she hated Ye You with all her being.

All the suffering and even her horrible death during the three hundred years of her previous life had all been caused by Ye You, who had forced her into a corner. She should hate Ye You with all her might.

But for some reason, she felt nothing as she looked at Ye You’s pitiful state. Having experienced so many different things this life, Ye You was no longer the only obsession in her heart.

“That year, you personally dug out the spirit root from me and now, you’ve dug it out from yourself...” Ye Qingtang said lightly.

Ye You looked at Ye Qingtang and finally understood what she meant by ‘so filthy’.

The spirit root which she had cultivated for so many years in her own body was now stained with blood and looked filthy to her.

Ye Qingtang had no intention of taking back the spirit root. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

As Ye You looked at Ye Qingtang, who was surrounded by an aura of power, she was left astounded. She had never expected her to be pretending to be the Holy Lord of Shadows. After all, when she had first seen the Holy Lord of Shadows, she had felt a power far above hers.

A completely oppressive power.

Never would she have even dreamed that the Ye Qingtang whom she had stolen her spirit root from would ever become this frightening and possess power that was so far beyond her reach.

She had tried her best but was now going to meet her demise in the hands of one she had once not even bothered sparing a glance for.
