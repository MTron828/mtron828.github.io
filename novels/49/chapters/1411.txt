1412 Confrontation 2

Ye Qingtang was calm while Beidou Demon Lord had a struggling expression.

He heard the two ladies saying that they wanted to auction for the Bone of the Dragon Breath earlier on, and just by looking at their generous spending in this period of time, it was obvious how shockingly large their wealth was.

Just as Beidou Demon Lord was in a dilemma, the Bone of the Dragon Breath was being presented.

It was a white bone that was the length of an adult’s arm. Rumors had it that the Bone of the Dragon Breath was left behind by the deceased ancient dragons. The power of the dragons in the ancient times was nothing that the current dragon clan could compare to. The bones that they left behind had been stored underground for many years, and despite the decomposition over the years, it still stored the dragon soul of the ancient dragon clan.

This type of dragon soul could incite the powerful potential in the bodies of all clans and was the best item for cultivation.

It was a pity that before the ancient dragons died, most of them would find a spot that no one knew about, which was known as the Great Dragons’ Graveyard. To date, no one knew where that graveyard was, and the Bones of the Dragon Breath that people could find were mostly left behind by ancient dragons who had an accidental death. Thus, they were extremely rare in quantity.

Once the Bone of the Dragon Breath was presented, all bidders were stirred. The bids rose rapidly, and it reached twenty times the starting price in no time.

At this instant, Beidou Demon Lord and Ye You were anxious to bid.

When he saw that the bid price finally rose slowly, Beidou Demon Lord gritted his teeth and offered a price that was way higher than the current bid price.

“Thirty thousand spirit coins.” Beidou Demon Lord roared loudly.

There were two types of currency used in the Central Mainland. The first type was the ordinary gold coin, which was similar to the First Mainland, while the second type was spirit coin.

Spirit coins were money that stored compressed spirit energy, and its worth greatly surpassed that of an ordinary gold coin.

A spirit coin was approximately worth ten million gold coins.

There were not many competing bidders left after Beidou Demon Lord shouted out the bid of thirty thousand spirit coins.

After all, thirty thousand spirit coins was an exorbitant amount even to a big family clan.

Beidou Demon Lord had a determined look on her face, but unbeknownst to all, he was a little nervous on the inside. He only had forty thousand spirit coins in total on him, and this was all of his family assets. He called such a high bid earlier on to use this chance to raise the bid and suppress all the other bidders.

“Thirty-five thousand spirit coins.” A feminine and weak face rang suddenly. The bidder was none other than Ye Xun.

Ye Xun immediately grinned at Ye Xun after offering the bid.

Ye You nodded slightly.

“Is that… someone from the Domain Monarch Jiang Family?” Some people in the auction recognized Ye You and Ye Xun and that their clothes had the embroidery of the Jiang Family’s unique totem on their chest.

Everyone in the Central Mainland knew about the Domain Monarch and that it was not one that normal people could afford to offend. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Furthermore, the Jiang Family’s wealth was extremely shocking. In the entire Central Mainland, perhaps only top forces such as the Sacred Ground of Reflection, Ancient You Clan, and Temple of Shadows could match up to the Jiang Family.

Even some large kingdoms may not be its opponent.

Some people who still wished to bid halted very sensibly when they saw that someone from the Jiang Family increased the bid.

Beidou Demon Lord frowned slightly and gritted his teeth as he went all in.

“Forty million spirit coins!” Beidou Demon Lord clenched his fists secretly while raising the bid.

Ye Xun glanced at Beidou Demon Lord and immediately bid after him. “Fifty thousand spirit coins.”
