Chapter 1308: Deliberate Provocation (1) Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Of course, the Crown Prince asked me to pass you a message. He knows that your injuries are serious, so he asked you to stay in your residence to recuperate. He will come and visit you when you are better. You must be aware that the Crown Prince just ascended to his position and has many matters to deal with. It’s natural that he is too busy to visit you right now.”

Mo Yunxian beamed the moment she heard this.

“I knew it. Elder Brother Yan would never stop loving me. Cousin, my injuries… are much better. Can you bring me to the Crown Prince’s residence? I haven’t seen Elder Brother Yan for many days.”

“This…” Mo You wanted to turn her down, but he could not harden his heart against the sight of Mo Yunxian’s pale little face.

“Alright, I’ll bring you to see the Crown Prince. But you must behave yourself and not make a fuss. I heard all about what happened at the banquet. How could you be so rash as to offend an Elder from the Temple of Shadows? If not for the Crown Prince’s sake, His Majesty would not have let you off so easily.”

When Mo Yunxian heard that, Ye Qingtang’s beautiful face involuntarily surfaced in her mind’s eye, and her expression hardened.

“How was I to know she’s an elder of the Temple of Shadows? Just that face alone would make one think she is some vixen from who knows where.”

Mo You sighed softly. He knew that Mo Yunxian had an almost warped possessiveness of Ling Yan. She would not allow any pretty girl to appear around Ling Yan.

“Perhaps His Majesty did not punish you any further because the Crown Prince pleaded for you. You must be more careful in the future.”

A sweet smile surfaced on Mo Yunxian’s face the moment she heard that Ling Yan had pleaded for her.

“Elder Brother Yan really cares for me.”

Mo You did not speak anymore and ordered men to prepare the sedan. When Mo Yunxian was seated in the sedan, he brought her to the Crown Prince’s residence.

Along the way, Mo Yunxian touched up her makeup in the sedan. Her one wish was to appear beautiful for Ling Yan.

But before long, the sedan suddenly stopped. The shrill whinnying of a horse could be heard from outside the sedan, followed by someone wailing.

“What’s going on?” Mo Yunxian was anxious to see Ling Yan and impatiently stuck her head out. She suddenly saw a youth, who had fallen to the ground in front of them. Mo Yunxian was sitting astride his tall horse, frowning.

“Cousin, why have we stopped?” Mo Yunxian asked crossly.

Mo You looked gloomy. He had been riding along when he suddenly saw a black figure dart out from the nearby crowd. The man had rushed straight into the path of his horse, and Mo You had not been able to stop in time. His horse’s hooves had crashed straight into the person.

“Go and see how he is,” Mo You said to a nearby guard.

But before the guard could go forward to make his inquiries, the youth who had fallen to the ground suddenly vomited blood, and his body convulsed violently. Just as the guard reached the youth’s side, the latter suddenly collapsed and stopped breathing.

“Lord Mo, the man is dead.” The guard checked his breathing.

“Dead?” Mo You was slightly taken aback. He would never have imagined that this person would suddenly die.

In the sedan, Mo Yunxian’s only thought was to see Ling Yan as soon as possible, but now, she had run into such an unfortunate incident. “So what if he’s dead? Never mind if he wanted to die, why should he bring such bad luck on others? Hurry up and drag him to the side so that he doesn’t block my way.”
