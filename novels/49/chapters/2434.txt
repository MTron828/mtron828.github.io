Chapter 2435: Suspicions (2)

The various academies and Universe City had worked together for so many years and no such incident had happened in the past before. This was why the academy leaders didn’t think too much about it at the beginning. But as more time passed, as blind as the academy leaders had been, they now realized that there were just too many things that had gone wrong. The Universe City people were definitely involved in this.

“No matter what, we have to find those Universe City folks. If this is really some devious plan of theirs, I will tear them apart!” The eyes of one of the academy leaders flashed with cold light.

The students enrolled in the various academies were their lifeblood. They were the future of the academies, many of them belonging to all sorts of powerful family clans. Some even had royal relations!

If these prominent descendants ended up dying in the Wailing Well just because they had participated in a normal inter-academy competition, how were they going to explain these to the family clans? How were they going to answer for their deaths?!

For today’s catastrophe, regardless of Universe City’s role in it, every single academy at present had an undeniable responsibility!

If they hadn’t been so pliant toward those Universe City people and had insisted on understanding the situation more, today’s crisis might have been avoided. The various academies had been competing against each other for so many years, but when faced with such a situation, they miraculously all came together. The Universe City… had to answer to them, answer to those dead children, and answer to their family clans!

“Wen Qi, look!”

Just as Wen Qi was stewing in anger, one of the academy leaders exclaimed as he watched the screen beside Wen Qi. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“What?” Wen Qi asked.

“Look at that screen,” the academy leader said.

Wen Qi turned toward the screen and was stunned by the image. The screen was showing Luo Sheng’s team, who had all been annihilated.

A youth was now walking within the lifeless scene.

“Ye Qing?!”

Wen Qi was astonished when he saw the face of that youth. He was filled with disbelief.

“How can it be?!”

The academy leaders immediately crowded over to look at the screen in front of Wen Qi. They looked amazed.

They had all personally witnessed just how formidable Ye Qing’s above-Emperor level monster was. There was no doubt that he had a zero percent chance of survival.

But now, that youth who should have been utterly destroyed had appeared on the screen in a completely unharmed state. How could one even begin to explain that!

Just as everyone was filled with disbelief, the Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President suddenly frowned. He stared at the stunned Wen Qi.

“Wen Qi… this might not be an appropriate time for me to voice out certain things, but Ye Qing died right before our eyes. And now, he has appeared again, completely unharmed. Shouldn’t you say something about that?”

Wen Qi met the eyes of the Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President. “What do you mean by that?”

“What do I mean?” The Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President gave a cold laugh. “A person who should be dead reappearing well and alive before us. Isn’t that strange enough?”

The other academy leaders fell into deep thought after hearing the Heaven Dome Academy Vice-President’s words.
