Chapter 1976: The Crimson League (2)

Little White Tiger only came out when it heard the sound of the door closing.

“Finished already?”

Ye Qingtang looked at Little White Tiger.

Little White Tiger moved its whiskers. “Ling Yan doesn’t look too bad but he’s completely useless. It’s only been this long... He’s too weak...”

Ye Qingtang took a while to figure out what Little White Tiger meant. When she could finally comprehend what it just said, she couldn’t help but want to sew its mouth shut!

How could they still be in the mood to joke around!

They couldn’t control their mouths even at such times! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang truly was in no mood to think about anything else. The thought of the Ancient You Clan coming anytime stressed her out, feeling as though someone threatening her with a knife against her neck.

As she thought about Ling Yan’s suggestion, she recalled that the eight tribe leaders did mention her return to the Crimson League before. Back then, Ye Qingtang was afraid that her identity might be exposed so she didn’t bother with it, but now...

Wasting no time, Ye Qingtang called the eight tribe leaders to inquire about the Crimson League’s situation in the Central Mainland.

The Holy Lord of Shadows had left the Temple of Shadows for too long. Before the Holy Lord of Shadows left, the Temple of Shadows still belonged to the Crimson League. This only happened years after she disappeared.

It had been more than tens of thousands of years ago since the Holy Lord of Shadows broke off contact with the Crimson League

Ye Qingtang casually asked the eight tribe leaders whether there were any changes regarding the Crimson League in the Central Mainland.

Their answers made her heave a sigh of relief.

“Holy Lord, not too long after you left, the Crimson League removed us from the league. Following that, the ambassador’s location in the Central Mainland also changed. Don’t worry, we have been watching their moves all these years.” The Goblin Tribe’s leader spoke, looking at Ye Qingtang with a hopeful expression.

Before the removal from the Crimson League, the eight tribe leaders felt suppressed and aggrieved. They knew for a fact that the Crimson League only agreed to let the Temple of Shadows join because of the Holy Lord of Shadows’ capabilities.

That explained why after the disappearance of the Holy Lord of Shadows, the Temple of Shadows no longer qualified for the Crimson League.

The eight tribe leaders were unhappy at the Holy Lord of Shadows for the longest time ever for leaving without any notice, but at the same time, they anticipated the Holy Lord of Shadows’ return so that they could return to the Crimson League.

The eight tribe leaders were initially suspicious about it, but after they confirmed, they felt even more strongly about the return to the Crimson League. They didn’t dare to tell Ye Qingtang what to do and could only hint at it indirectly.

Now that Ye Qingtang finally mentioned the Crimson League, the eight tribe leaders couldn’t wait to let her know about every single piece of news they collected about the Crimson League over these years.

Nobody even realized that Ye Qingtang didn’t have much understanding of the Crimson League. After all, the Holy Lord had left for so long. There were massive changes in the Crimson League and it wasn’t unusual at all.

“Oh? Tell me what you know.” Ye Qingtang remained composed.

The eight tribe leaders told Ye Qingtang about everything they knew.

One of the ambassadors from the Crimson League in the Central Mainland remained at the Temple of Shadows. After many years of waiting for the Holy Lord of Shadows to come back, the ambassador eventually informed the headquarters at the Second Domain to remove the Temple of Shadows from the Crimson League.

Other than that one ambassador, they had a couple of capable ambassadors hidden among the Central Mainland. It was no surprise that the eight tribe leaders had already found their locations.
