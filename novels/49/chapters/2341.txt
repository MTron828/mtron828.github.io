Chapter 2342: Try It Out Yourself (2)

Their Boss was so good. There was no need to stay here and endure this abuse.

“Boss, we will all leave with you,” Jing Ze said.

“What? Trying to flee after being exposed?” Di Nuo sneered.

Di Nuo had just completed his sentence when a murderous light flashed across Qin Feng’s eyes. He drew his sword and stood in front of Ye Qingtang.

“Say another word and I will kill you today.” Qin Feng stared coldly at Di Nuo. From her position nearby, Mu Ziying also narrowed her eyes. The puppet in her arms had already disappeared from sight.

Hang Wenwei and his group were dumbfounded. They never expected the situation to escalate like this. They also felt that Di Nuo was purposely making things difficult for Ye Qing, but…

Qin Feng dared to draw his sword at a teacher?!

“Damn, what’s going on? Ran Mo, hurry up, go and…” Hang Wenwei was about to ask Ran Mo to call for reinforcements when he turned to see that Ran Mo had already disappeared.

They had just acknowledged Ye Qing as their teacher and still weren’t that close to him, but they could feel that Ye Qing was not like what Di Nuo and Zhu Ning claimed. He was not someone who would go and find someone else to teach his own disciples.

Moreover, just looking at how Qin Feng and the others were willing to lay down their lives for Ye Qing, it could be seen how much respect they had for him.

If Ye Qing had not personally taught them, would they respect him so much?

This commotion was a shock to everyone in the medicine faculty.

In the beginning, Jing Ze had tried to explain that Ye Qing had taught them everything. But no matter what he said, Di Nuo would have some excuse or other to counter his words.

The key reason was…

Ye Qing’s cultivation level was too low.

It was inconceivable that such a youth could produce several Divine Lord level students in such a short period of time. It was even more impossible for him to be a godsend in alchemy.

As Jing Ze and the others had been instructed by Ye Qing not to talk about their experience in the Evil Soul Forest, they did not dare to do so.

After all, the Evil Soul Forest matter had immense significance. It might even end up triggering the other factions in the Second Domain. They had to keep it a secret.

Ye Qingtang looked at the little brats surrounding her. Her heart felt like it was burning.

“Back down,” Ye Qingtang spoke in a mild tone.

As their teacher, how could she let her own disciples stand up for her while she hid behind them?

Ye Qingtang did not care what Di Nuo and the others thought about her. After all, she had no intention of staying long in the Netherworld Academy, but… Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

If this implicated Qin Feng and the rest, she would never back down.

“Boss…”

Ye Qingtang shot them a “keep quiet and stay calm” look before turning toward Di Nuo and Zhu Ning.

“Since the two of you don’t believe me, why don’t you try me out yourselves?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Ye Qing, what do you mean by that?” Di Nuo frowned.

“You two believe that I cannot possibly produce Divine Lord level students and cannot possibly know anything about alchemy. It’s just a simple matter. I will challenge you two. If I lose, I will accept all of your accusations. If I win, I hope that you two can honor the terms of our bets.”

Everyone was dumbstruck by Ye Qing’s words.

Even Lei Yan and the others had widened their eyes in disbelief.

“Boss, don’t be too impulsive. Just leave this matter to us!” Nangong Lie was panicking.

They were not worried about Boss’ alchemy skills, but… fighting with Di Nuo… that was too much.

Di Nuo was a teacher from the martial arts faculty and had already reached the Divine Lord Second Heaven peak level. He was just one step away from the Third Heaven level. And Ye Qing was only a Paragon Sixth Heaven level. The disparity between these two was unimaginable.

If it really came down to a battle, Di Nuo would be able to finish off Ye Qing with just one move!
