Chapter 2685 Fourth Domain (5)

Before long, all the disciples of the Great Immortal Temple were summoned by the Absolute Heaven Saint. Among them were Ye Qingtang’s seniors, Lan Shan and Wan Rong.

Lan Shan and Wan Rong were both disciples of the Nine Heavens Saint, the same as Ye Qingtang. However, these two people joined the sect and became his disciples much earlier than Ye Qingtang.

“We are sending our disciples into the void rift first. While inside, listen to Junior Sister Ye Yue’s instructions.”

The disciples of the Great Immortal Temple looked at the Absolute Heaven Saint. After affirming that this was truly the Absolute Heaven Saint’s wishes, everyone nodded, as if they had no objections. “All of you are too reckless and unsuitable for commanding. On the other hand, Junior Sister Ye Yue should be fine,” Lan Shan said with a smile.

“You don’t seem to have the right to speak ill of others.” Wan Rong glanced at Lan Shan.

Before Lan Shan could reply, the Absolute Heaven Saint slowly stood up and said without looking back, “Follow me.”

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang and the other disciples of the Great Immortal Temple followed the Absolute Heaven Saint.

A few seconds later, the Absolute Heaven Saint waved his arm and a void rift appeared.

The rift was black and there was an extremely powerful pressure surrounding it. If one was careless in dealing with this kind of pressure, no matter how powerful one was, or how heaven-defying one’s divine abilities were, they would instantly turn into nothingness and be torn apart by the pressure.

Looking at this rift, Ye Qingtang finally understood how powerful the owner of the soul bone was.

“Master, is this the rift?” Xie Jun walked forward and stared at it.

“That’s right.” The Absolute Heaven Saint nodded. He seemed to be deep in thought as he said, ” All the supreme factions have discovered the existence of the rift long ago. Originally, they wanted to try and disperse the pressure around the rift, but to no avail. The rift will spread wider on its own, but it will take a very long time. As a result, we can only send you all inside first.”

“Uncle-Master, where does this void rift lead to?” Wan Rong looked at him.

All the disciples wanted to know where they would end up after entering this void rift. This was extremely important.

However, the Absolute Heaven Saint shook his head and said, “Not necessarily.”

“Not necessarily?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

All the disciples of the Great Immortal Temple were taken aback by the Absolute Heaven Saint’s words. What did he mean by that? Where would they end up after entering the spatial rift?

After a long while, the Absolute Heaven Saint finally said, “Millions of years ago, this place was the transit station between the Divine Venerate Domain and the Fourth Domain. After the destruction of the Fourth Domain, the transit station lost its effectiveness and the power of the teleportation array formation was lost. According to the speculations of the various supreme factions, it’s very likely that you will enter the Fourth Domain, which no longer exists and is now a dead domain. Of course, they are not a hundred percent sure. Nevertheless, it is quite probable.”

“The Fourth Domain?!”

Everyone, even Ye Qingtang was shocked by what the Absolute Heaven Saint said.

Many generations ago, the Fourth Domain had been destroyed and turned into a dead domain. Everyone knew this, but now he was saying that there was a high chance that this void rift would send them into the Fourth Domain…

“Uncle-Master, this is too terrifying. The Fourth Domain has already become a dead domain. No one knows what’s going on in the Fourth Domain now. Back then, the Heavenly Emperor wanted to go to the Fourth Domain to investigate. It’s said that even before he managed to step inside the Fourth Domain, he was pushed back by the intense aura of resentment.”
