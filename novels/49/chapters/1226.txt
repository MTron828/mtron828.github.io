Chapter 1227 Holy Son 1

At that moment, five completely different Undead were kneeling before Ye Qingtang. Some were pure skeletons while others were part flesh and part bones like the remains of a body. Some even… looked like normal humans. However, all of them carried the faint scent of death.

“Holy Lord, you have finally returned.” A skeleton in a long golden robe spoke with a quavering voice. It raised its head and fixed its dark eye sockets on Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang had no idea who these five Undead were. So, she assumed a calm demeanor and nodded.

“Rise, all of you.”

The five Undead got to their feet. Among them was one that looked like a youth. It raised its hands to wipe the unprecedented traces of tears from the corner of its eyes.

“Holy Lord, we have waited for you for many years. Please return to the Temple,” several Undead said respectfully.

Ye Qingtang raised her eyes and looked at the pitch-black Temple. She sighed inwardly and walked in.

The moment Ye Qingtang entered, eerie green lights suddenly sprang up along the walls on both sides, lighting up the previously pitch-dark temple.

She saw at a glance that the huge temple was held up by thirty-six black bone pillars. Each bone pillar was crisscrossed with numerous black snake bones.

Right at the end of the main hall was a bone throne made of black gold. It suddenly appeared in front of Ye Qingtang.

“Holy Lord, please take your seat.”

In the main hall, many Undead turned their empty eye sockets towards Ye Qingtang. Although they had no eyeballs, their expectancy and urgency were apparent.

Under the scrutiny of the numerous Undead, Ye Qingtang had no choice but to steel herself and step onto the throne of black bone.

As Ye Qingtang took her seat, all the Undead in the main hall clattered their lower jaws. Their teeth made a crisp clacking noise that filled the entire hall. The scent of death swiftly spread through the hall.

The little white tiger crouched on Ye Qingtang’s knee. At this sight, it secretly used its claws to grip Ye Qingtang’s knees.

There were so many Undead that just the sight of them was frightening. If Ye Qingtang’s true status was exposed, they would never escape.

Ye Qingtang nodded silently.

However, before Ye Qingtang could recover her wits, a black shadow emerged from the side of the temple and rushed forward.

Bringing with it the strong scent of blood.

This black shadow was extremely fast. Before Ye Qingtang and the little white tiger could ascertain what it was, the black shadow had burrowed into Ye Qingtang’s arms, sending the little white tiger, which had been crouching on Ye Qingtang’s knee, flying.

“Ah Yao… You have finally returned.” A soft voice with a trace of tears came from the black shadow.

Ye Qingtang finally saw what had burrowed into her arms…

It was a dainty little child, standing only as high as her knee. He had an exquisite little face, and his pale and flawless skin had a hint of gray. His large black eyes had no white. They were hollow and black, like a cat that had widened its eyes.

Although he looked eerie, he was also adorable.

However…

The child’s clothes seemed to be soaked in blood. Fresh blood dripped from his robes and fell at the foot of the throne of black bone.

“…” Ye Qingtang stared at him blankly. What the hell?!
