Chapter 1876: Chasing (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang wanted to ask Fu Qiu more about the man but it shuddered in fear at the mere mention of him. It could only shake its head and say that it remembered nothing about the man. It was as though Fu Qiu’s mind had been wiped of all memories of that mysterious man.

If not for its obsession with Jiu Yuan, Fu Qiu would probably not have remembered the man at all. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Her lead had come to a dead-end once again.

But Ye Qingtang had obtained a crucial piece of information about her mother from Fu Qiu. Jiu Yuan had told Fu Qiu before that she was from the Secondary Domain.

It said that Jiu Yuan seemed to be hiding from something that time, but hadn’t told Fu Qiu more about it.

At least Ye Qingtang could confirm now that Jiu Yuan was indeed her mother.

Just as Ye Qingtang became lost in her thoughts, Long Yi and the young girl walked out from the underground. The young girl looked extremely sleepy and she rubbed her bleary eyes as she looked at Ye Qingtang.

Her nose wrinkled up with only one look but they quickly caught sight of Ye Qingtang’s bloodstained clothes.

Long Yi didn’t say anything and merely greeted Fu Qiu before heading out to earn that day’s spirit stones.

The young girl crossed her arms and stood there looking at Ye Qingtang’s pathetic appearance.

“It stinks.” The young girl lifted her hand to fan the smell away, as though she was extremely bothered by the smell of blood on Ye Qingtang.

As Ye Qingtang’s mind was filled with her mother, she was in no mood to argue with the arrogant girl.

But at this moment, Ye Qingtang saw the girl something at her. She lifted her hand instinctively to block it and was shocked to feel something cold on her hand.

When she lowered her head to look, she saw that it was a bottle of medicine.

“It’s an excellent healing ointment. “Put it on quickly or you’re going to kill me with your smell.” The young girl explained dismissively.

Ye Qingtang looked at the medicine on her palm and couldn’t help but laugh.

This girl had such a strange personality. She was obviously being kind yet wanted to seem like she wasn’t.

“Thank you,” Ye Qingtang said. Even though the wound from Fu Qiu’s bite wasn’t deep, it still hurt.

The young girl harrumphed.

“I’m not wasting any time talking to you. I’m going back to rest.”

With that, she turned and left.

But at this moment, someone knocked frantically at the entrance of the Crystal Palace and her footsteps halted.

From the inside, they could see a row of people knocking on the entrance of the Crystal Palace. They looked to be in a bad state, with many of them injured.

Fu Qiu looked annoyed. It seemed like whatever had happened just now had not made him any friendlier. He seemed to still have no interest in helping the human race at all.

But the young girl’s eyes widened when she saw who was standing outside.

“Elder brother!”

The young girl rushed to the entrance and opened the door before Fu Qiu could do anything.

There was a young man on the other side of the door with a face as beautiful as the young girl’s, but it was deathly pale. He had suffered heavy wounds and could only stand with the support of his guards.

He let out a pained smile when he saw the young girl behind the doors.

“Yao’er...”

With that, he fainted and was caught by his guard before he collapsed.
