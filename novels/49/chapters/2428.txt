Chapter 2429: Death (3)

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank.

But just as the black shadow approached Ye Qingtang, a chilly feeling suddenly arose from her wrist area.

Multiple streams of black mist surged out from her wrist!

Within seconds, the black mist clashed with the black shadow from the monster. As the mist swirled around, Ye Qingtang could smell a thick evil stench as well as the faint wails of malicious ghosts. In the next second, the black shadow looked like it had been destroyed by the black mist.

It disappeared without a trace.

The black mist also gradually dissipated. Ye Qingtang could vaguely see a blurred figure inside the black mist. Before it completely dissipated, it bowed at her before vanishing.

Crack…

A cracking sound rang out from Ye Qingtang’s wrist.

It was like something had broken. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang looked down and saw her Nine Souls Ring falling to the ground in pieces.

Nine Souls Ring!

This was something that Ye Qingtang had inadvertently placed on her wrist while in the Temple of Shadows. The Nine Souls Ring became invisible after being worn and Ye Qingtang had forgotten about its existence.

This was a precious artifact left behind by the Holy Lord of Shadows. Ye Qingtang never expected the long-forgotten Nine Souls Ring to save her life at such a crucial moment.

Able to withstand the attack of an above-Emperor level monster. It could be inferred just how powerful the Nine Souls Ring was. Even so, the Nine Souls Ring was now broken and Ye Qingtang had lost this life-preserving trump card.

Taking advantage of the impasse, Ye Qingtang poured all her energy and focus into her legs, just wishing to escape from this massive monster.

But an above-Emperor level power was not something which Ye Qingtang could run from. Within seconds, the monster appeared in front of Ye Qingtang. Countless black shadows shot out of its opened maw toward Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes reflected the countless black shadows, all looking like they wanted to completely tear her apart. Shock was the only thing she could feel.

It was as if she could feel the approach of imminent death, and her blood seemed to freeze.

“Boom!”

A loud boom rang out as the countless black shadows landed. All the vegetation in the area where Ye Qingtang stood was disintegrated.

A massive black hole appeared.

Several figures standing not far off stiffened.

“Boss!!”

Lei Yan and his group had split up per Ye Qing’s instructions. But halfway, they realized that the monster was not pursuing them anymore. Instead, it headed in Ye Qing’s direction.

Almost simultaneously, they realized something was not right and hurried over. But the moment they came near, they saw Ye Qing engulfed by the countless black shadows. And after the black shadows dissipated, the entire area was in ruins.

Only a charred black hole remained.

After seeing the black hole, the monster appeared to have no intention of staying. It continued traveling forward. It was like its only target had been Ye Qing. It had no interest in the others at all.

As they watched the monster’s departing back profile, Lei Yan and the others looked like they had lost their souls.

They stood there in a daze, unable to move at all.
