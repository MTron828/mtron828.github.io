Ye Qingtang was not an illegitimate child of the Ouyang family clan. This Golden Moon Armor was merely found from a super sect Elder’s space ring when she was in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm.

Although this item was good, it was too large for Ye Qingtang, and there was no way she could wear it given her size.

Furthermore…

Given Yin Yang Perfected Lord’s current half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord state, this item was not a must either.

She was just offering a present provided by others to achieve her goal, and this was the true value of the Golden Moon Armor.

Xiong Feng hesitated. He indeed wanted this Golden Moon Armor very much, and what Ye Qingtang said earlier caused his heart to waver.

“This… There’s no issue with helping to refer you, but… you also know that our Valley Master has not accepted any disciple for a long time. If you want to become his disciple, I reckon that it’s not so simple…”

“I’ve already said that regardless of whether it is successful, this Golden Moon Armor is yours,” Ye Qingtang said readily.

Xiong Feng clenched his fists secretly. Ye Qingtang had already put it that way. If he refused, wasn’t he a fool?

“Alright! I’ll help you to refer him then. As for whether the Valley Master is willing to accept you or not, it will be up to you.” Xiong Feng finally succumbed to the temptation of the Golden Moon Armor. Furthermore, this fellow had already said that it was dependent on his skills whether he could make it or not, and he only needed to refer him, which was nothing much.

This fellow has so many treasures, and he must be from a pretty powerful background. If the Valley master sees her, there should not be any issues either.

“I’ll have to trouble you then, Warden Xiong.” Ye Qingtang bowed with a smile as a glint flashed across her eyes.

This was the outcome she wanted.

“Alright. You’ll follow me into the valley now. I’ll bring you to meet our Valley Master.” Warden Xiong kept the Scorching Sun Gloves and the Golden Moon Armor in his space ring cautiously as an indescribable satisfaction filled him.

If the valley’s disciples were all like this little brother Ye Chen in giving away things so extravagantly, wouldn’t his life be extremely sweet?

Ye Qingtang brought the little white tiger and the silver wolf into Falling Sky Valley. The scenery before her made her recall the various incidents in her past life. Images of her cultivating with her senior brothers and sisters in Falling Sky Valley popped up in her mind continuously, and the figure of her Master lingered in the deepest corner of her memory.

Very quickly, Xiong Feng led Ye Qingtang to a hall. Xiong Feng paused outside the hall and turned to look at Ye Qingtang.

“Valley Master is inside. I’ll enter the hall and speak to him. Wait outside here.”

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang nodded. Looking at the hall in front of her, she could not help but recall images of her listening to her Master’s teaching inside the hall.

After giving the orders, Xiong Feng walked straight into the hall.

A silver-haired senior was seated in the central seat of the hall. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Although that senior’s hair was all white, his features did not seem aged at all. He stroked his long beard gently as his deep-set eyes were focused on a scroll on the table.

A handsome youth stood beside the senior.

When Xiong Feng saw that senior, he immediately bowed and greeted. “I pay my respects, Valley Master. I have something to report.”

Perfected Xuanchen looked up slightly and was not in a hurry to speak when he saw Xiong Feng, who entered suddenly. Indifferently, he handed the scroll on the table to the youth beside him.

“Yan Shu, send this scroll to your Eldest Senior Brother later.”

“Yes.” The youth nodded slightly, received the scroll, and stood aside.

Then, Perfected Xuanchen turned to look at Xiong Feng. “What is it?”
