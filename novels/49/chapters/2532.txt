Chapter 2533: Deal (1)

After an unknown period of time in the darkness, Ye Qingtang opened her eyes and leaped up. Running over quietly to the kennel, Ye Qingtang tugged at the big yellow dog’s ear.

“What are you doing?” The big yellow dog opened its eyes which gleamed faintly in the darkness.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly and gestured for them to keep quiet. She said softly, “Lower your voice. Someone is approaching.”

“What does that have to do with me? Anyway, he’s definitely not here to look for me.” The big yellow dog yawned and was indifferent to Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Not looking for you? I don’t think so.” Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog and said softly, “Previously, you severely injured a Branch Master of the Sky Vault Sect and destroyed his body, forcing his soul to flee. Perhaps the Sky Vault Sect is here to take revenge on you.”

The big yellow dog regained its senses and asked in surprise, “Why do you humans like to seek revenge so much… then what should we do?”

Ye Qingtang remained silent in thought. They clearly knew how powerful the big yellow dog was but they still dared to come over to seek revenge. This meant that these people were not afraid of the big yellow dog’s abilities at all. If it was really the Sky Vault Sect, it was very likely that the Sky Vault Sect Paragon had personally come.

If that was the case, the consequences would be unimaginable. A Branch Master of the Sky Vault Sect already had terrifying powers. If the Sky Vault Sect Paragon were to come in person… Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. She did not dare to finish that thought.

“Little girl, are you plagued by bad luck? Why do we encounter so many things wherever you go? It’s really my extreme bad luck to be by your side!” the big yellow dog complained.

Ye Qingtang glared at the big yellow dog. “You still have the cheek to criticize me? If you did not severely injure the Sky Vault Sect’s Branch Master, the people from the Sky Vault Sect would not have come here to seek revenge, right? Are you blaming me?”

The big yellow dog snorted. “That was all to help you…”

“Help me?” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. That had not been the case. Previously, she had asked the big yellow dog to help but it refused no matter what. It had obviously blown up in anger after getting beaten. What did it have to do with her?

“Little girl, now is not the time to talk about this. Didn’t you say earlier that you wanted to grant me a wish? I have one now. Go and lure those people from the Sky Vault Sect away. Go quickly.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Astonishment was the only way one could describe Ye Qingtang as she stared at the big yellow dog. Could this dog be any more shameless? It was clearly the one who said that it wanted to grant her one wish. But now, it had suddenly become the other way around?

It was only at that moment that Ye Qingtang finally believed that the big yellow dog was not lying. It was indeed unable to gather its strength in a short period. Otherwise, it would not have said such shameless words.

Before she fell asleep, Ye Qingtang was still full of anticipation for the upper realm mentioned by the big yellow dog. She wanted to know what was actually up there. But now, Ye Qingtang had completely lost interest in the so-called upper realm. In all honesty, she was afraid that all the powerful figures in the upper realm were as shameless as the big yellow dog. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

With that thought in mind, Ye Qingtang was too lazy to continue paying attention to the big yellow dog. She walked to the round window in the house and looked out.

The surroundings were quiet and there was no sound at all. However, Ye Qingtang could feel a few powerful forces inadvertently spreading out from the dark, causing one’s heart to tremble..
