‘At that moment, Ye Qingtang was completely expressionless. Her face was cold and her eyes were completely white. Coldness surrounded her as if she had already escaped the boundaries of humanity and morphed into the unknown.

With that point of her finger, Ye Qingtang shattered the void and formed a finger-sized black hole.

Soon after, the damaged black hole was quickly repaired and Ye Qingtang’s snow-white eyes returned to normal.

Ye Qingtang gasped lightly. The power of the great dao alone was terrifying. It was as if… she was standing at the top of the world and wanted to step on everything. It was so dangerous that it could even make her lose her mind.

Having returned to normal now, Ye Qingtang was extremely shocked. The Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline only swallowed a trace of the great dao power, but this sliver of energy was already so terrifying. If she could absorb all the great dao power.

What would happen then?!

However, it seemed that as long as the Heart of the Heavenly Dao remained hidden, she and the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline did not have any good solution. Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang was not discouraged. No matter what, she had already succeeded somewhat. She had managed to snatch some

of the dao power and this was enough to prove that it was possible.

As for how she could snatch all the great dao power from the Heart of the Heavenly Dao, she could only wait for an opportunity.

Surely there should be a way to fulfill her wish in this era.

Ye Qingtang checked her body again. The Heavenly Demon Bloodline had also suffered a major blow just now. However, with the Heavenly Demon Pearl, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline’s recovery speed was also extremely fast, so Ye Qingtang did not need to worry too much.

However, there was still something that Ye Qingtang did not understand. Why did the power of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline and the Heavenly Demon Pearl improve so much after she arrived in this era? If she had the chance, she had to study this matter. Perhaps there was still a chance for her

Heavenly Demon Pearl and the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline to improve.

“Qingtang… I mean, Sister Ye Yue!”

Just as Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, the young Feng Jiuyou, shouted from outside and knocked on the door.

Getting to her feet, Ye Qingtang walked over to open the door. Looking at the sweating Feng Jiuyou, she asked curiously, “Jiuyou, what’s wrong?”

“Sister Ye Yue, do you have time?” The young Feng Jiuyou wiped the sweat off his face and asked Ye Qingtang. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang smiled and said to Feng Jiuyou, “Your parents told me to look after you and not allow you to go to the middle of the mountain.”

Ye Qingtang thought that Feng Jiuyou wanted to drag her to Mt. Zhong to search for herbs again.

“That’s not it, Sister Ye Yue. I don’t want to go to the middle of the mountain.” Feng Jiuyou explained, “Sister Ye Yue, do you want to cultivate with us? As you’re from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, your strength isn’t that strong.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

In the end, Ye Qingtang still agreed. It seemed she couldn’t bring herself to reject this future legendary figure.

“Sister Ye Yue, I’ve reached a bottleneck, but I still have to work harder. We can cultivate together and become experts in the future. I don’t want to see the Feng family continue to be bullied!” The young Feng Jiuyou clenched his fists.

“Jiuyou, did something happen?” Ye Qingtang frowned.

Feng Jiuyou stared at Ye Qingtang and seemed to want to say something. In the end, he only shook his head. “Sister Ye Yue, it’s nothing. Let’s cultivate together.”
