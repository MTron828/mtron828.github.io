Chapter 1300: Dangers Abound (2)

“It’s late. Please get some rest,” the Eldest Prince said politely.

Lady Ghost, Ye Qingtang, and Ming Gu all returned to their rooms to rest.

Ye Qingtang had had a relaxing day. Anyway, she was supposed to be just an Elder, so Lady Ghost had taken care of everything. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Ah Yao, can I come in?” Ming Gu had secretly crept outside Ye Qingtang’s room door, and now, he poked his head through the doorway and looked pitifully at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang looked at the exquisite little face. She was hard-pressed to reconcile this innocent face with the murderous god of killing in the main hall. She nodded, and Ming Gu immediately flew to her side.

“Ah Yao, that smelly grub was so insulting. Why didn’t you let me kill her?” Ming Gu squatted next to Ye Qingtang, his small hands on Ye Qingtang’s knee. He rested his small chin between his little hands, his large, black eyes filled with bewilderment.

Ye Qingtang chuckled but felt helpless.

Although Mo Yunxian had insulted her, one blow from Ming Gu was as much as she could withstand. Also, she guessed that based on her character, the actual Holy Lord of Shadows would not have allowed Ming Gu to actually kill Mo Yunxian either.

Someone like Mo Yunxian was probably beneath the Holy Lord of Shadows’s notice.

“Because today, I am only an Elder from the Temple of Shadows and not the Holy Lord,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile. She could not help but reach out to pat Ming Gu’s furry little head.

Ming Gu frowned. He did not care whether she was an Elder or the Holy Lord. Ah Yao was Ah Yao.

Ye Qingtang saw that Ming Gu was not prepared to let it go. She was about to say something else when the faint aura of death suddenly spread through her room.

Ye Qingtang’s heart thumped for a moment, but she maintained her composure and continued to rub Ming Gu’s hair smilingly.

The next moment, Lady Ghost’s lazy voice rang out from within the room.

“Holy Son Ming Gu, the Holy Lord made the right decision. We are here to help the Eternal Prince become the Crown Prince. If we started killing today, the Eternal Emperor would have been displeased.” Lady Ghost slowly emerged from a dim corner and bowed to Ye Qingtang.

“Why do I need to care about what a smelly grub thinks?” Ming Gu frowned impatiently.

So what if he was the Eternal Emperor? If he was displeased, Ming Gu would kill him too.

Lady Ghost was used to Ming Gu’s nature.

To Ming Gu, all humans were smelly grubs. They had no reason to exist. Even within the Temple of Shadows, the only two people that Ming Gu listened to were the Holy Lord of Shadows and Ming Wang.

Other than that, Ming Gu did as he pleased.

Lady Ghost knew that she could not convince Ming Gu, so she did not say anything more. Instead, she looked at Ye Qingtang. “Holy Lord, the Eternal Emperor’s move today was earlier than anticipated. However, it should not be a major problem. Tonight, the Eldest Prince will certainly investigate everything related to Ling Yan. Barring all other accidents, the Eldest Prince will try his best to make Ling Yan vanish forever from the Eternal Emperor, just like the Fourth Prince.”

Lady Ghost was not interested in why the Fourth Prince had died. But she was certain that the Fourth Prince’s death had been caused by the other princes and princesses.

And Ling Yan was their next target.

“Mhm.” Ye Qingtang nodded calmly, keeping her expression casual. But in her heart, she was silently mourning for Ling Yan.
