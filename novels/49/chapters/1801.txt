Chapter 1802: Fleeing The Valley (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Luckily Ye Qingtang was the only one who knew where the Deity Ocean was. Even if any one of the eastern fiendish demons were captured, the big three wouldn’t be able to get any information out of them.

“But...” Ye Qingtang still felt very uneasy.

“Don’t worry. We have been able to survive for so long under the reign of the big three because we have our own methods of self-preservation. They won’t be able to find us if we split up and hide within the valley.” The Great General patted Ye Qingtang on the shoulder. He was rather comforted by Ye Qingtang’s hesitation.

“Qing, don’t worry. Now, the most important thing is to prevent you being captured. If you end up in their hands, all our efforts would have been for nothing,” Hu spoke up.

Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth. She knew this was the best arrangement. She would only delay the evacuation of the eastern fiendish demons if she remained.

“Alright. Great General, Hu, Ba, take care. And those little fellows...” Ye Qingtang thought of those little fiendish demons who followed her all day long in the camp.

“We will make the appropriate arrangements. You must remember that there is hope for the eastern camp only if you stay alive,” the Great General stated gravely.

Ye Qingtang bowed and turned to leave. She picked up Little Heavenly Demon and Little White Tiger before hurrying out from the back of the cave.

Fiendish demons. Ye Qingtang had a deep fear of these creatures previously, but now, she had a whole new perspective on them.

They were the epitome of terror as an enemy.

But as a friend, they were brave, pure and honorable.

There were so many different types of creatures in this world. No single species’ way of living was the right way. Right and wrong, it really depended on which side you happened to be standing on.

At this point, Ye Qingtang had no time to mull over her worries about the eastern fiendish demons. She had to quickly escape with Little White Tiger and Little Heavenly Demon.

To avoid being discovered, Ye Qingtang once again activated the Deity Ocean within her to make herself invisible.

Having fled to a mountain range near the eastern camp, she saw that the eastern fiendish demons, who would usually be hanging around outside, were already rushing into the cave. The Great General must have already started the evacuation.

Meanwhile, some distance away, Ye Qingtang could clearly see the troops of the big three surging toward the camp like a giant wave.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. Without any further hesitation,she quickly left her current spot.

The wrath of the big three and news of their combined attack had spread across the entire valley. All the other demon camps had also come forth to watch the battle.

As a result, a strange peace and quiet settled across the valley, which was usually filled with all sorts of fights and skirmishes.

After staying invisible for a period of time, Ye Qingtang surveyed her surroundings to confirm there were no other fiendish demons around. Only then did she undo her invisibility to continue her escape. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The Deity Ocean took quite a long time to recharge its power. As a result, Ye Qingtang didn’t want to use its power unless absolutely necessary. After all, this was the treasure that would guarantee her life.

Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to stop for even a second while in the valley. She moved very vigilantly, traveling day and night for several consecutive days without stopping. She also took the chance to wash off the demon blood on her and swallowed some elixir to mask her aura.

While hiding, she came upon some passing fiendish demons by chance. Overhearing their conversation, she learned that the big three invaded the eastern camp only to find that all the fiendish demons had already fled without a trace. The big three had ended up completely empty-handed.
