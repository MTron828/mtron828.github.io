Chapter 518: Paying Respects To The Guardian (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Excuse me, Guardian.” The elderly did not bother with the Blood Moon Elder at all as he walked forward and uncapped the golden bottle in his hand.

Soon after, the cool Demonic Water was sprinkled on Ye Qingtang.

This is bad…

There was a change in the expression of the Blood Moon Elder who was lifted by Soul Severing Troll. Ye Qingtang… still lost the gamble eventually…

So be it that Ye Qingtang was going to die, but, in the end, he would be implicated as well!

At that moment, Ye Qingtang had already taken out the talisman and hid it in her palms, preparing to use the Kingdom of God to repress this place any time.

However…

About a few breaths’ time later, the blood-colored crescent moon on her glabella was still as bright as before, and there was not the slightest change in the Blood Moon Aura on her body!

Immediately, the several Branch Masters’ expressions changed as they stared at Ye Qingtang in disbelief. Even the Blood Moon Division Head was surprised as well.

Initially, he and the few Blood Moon Branch Masters believed this to be a fraud and that this girl who claimed to be a Blood Moon Guardian was most likely an impostor.

However, what made the Blood Moon Division Head and the several Blood Moon Branch Masters gasp in disbelief was that there was no reaction when the Demonic Water landed on the girl before them!

This circumstance could only prove that her Blood Moon Aura and crescent moon on her glabella was not forged… Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Along with the rinsing of the Demonic Water, not only was the Blood Moon Aura on Ye Qingtang not washed away, the crescent moon on her glabella shone even more brilliantly.

“This…”

Suddenly, there was a huge change in the expression of the Blood Moon Branch Masters, and they were in utter disbelief.

After the rinse by the Demonic Water, they clearly felt a shred of the Holy Lord’s remaining aura on Ye Qingtang’s body!

“How can this be…” The Blood Moon Division Head looked at Ye Qingtang with his mouth agape.

The three great Blood Moon Guardians and Sect master were appointed by the Holy Lord and were bestowed with the Holy Lord’s blessing. Thus, there would be a remnant of the Holy Lord’s aura.

The Holy Lord’s aura was originally very obscure, but after the rinse with the Demonic Water, it would be slightly more evident.

Ye Qingtang had already intended to release the array formation in the talisman, but noticing the shock on the elderly’s face and the stunned expression on the Blood Moon Branch Masters, Ye Qingtang was extremely confused.

Could it be that the Demonic Water was… ineffective because it had been too many years?

The Blood Moon Elder who was lifted up by Soul Severing Troll felt his heart race wildly. He could not believe the sight.

What exactly happened to Ye Qingtang? The Blood Moon Aura and the crescent moon on her glabella… were actually real?

More than that, he even felt the supreme Holy Lord’s aura on Ye Qingtang’s body.

He involuntarily recalled the avid Blood Moon Sect worshiper whom Ye Qingtang mentioned before.

An unfathomable thought emerged in the Blood Moon Elder’s mind all of a sudden.

In almost an instant, the Blood Moon Elder was already drenched in his cold sweat.

He once said that he would definitely behead that avid fan who dared to impose as the Blood Moon Holy Lord if he saw him…

“Over… Over… This is all over… I…” The Blood Moon Elder trembled. If the so-called avid worshiper that Ye Qingtang mentioned was really their Blood Moon Sect Holy Lord and the Holy Lord heard of the Blood Moon Elder’s disrespectful words… wouldn’t he…

As the Blood Moon Elder was filled with horror, everyone had a surprised expression.

“I pay respects to the Guardian!”

After witnessing that the crescent moon on Ye Qingtang’s glabella shone even more brightly after being rinsed by the Demonic Water, the Blood Moon Division Head fell on his knees and knelt by Ye Qingtang’s legs.
