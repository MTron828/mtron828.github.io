Chapter 1445 Mother 2

“Don’t worry. As long as your mother is here, no one will harm you at all.” Mo Yi lifted her hand and patted Ye Qingtang’s head. A gentle smile hung on her lips. Then, she raised her eyes and looked at Elder Meng and the others. The gentleness in her eyes was replaced by a piercing, murderous air.

“If anyone dares to hurt one hair on your head, I’ll flay him. If anyone dares to bully you, I’ll scrape the meat off his bones…”

Although Mo Yi spoke gently, every word was ice-cold. Everyone’s scalp prickled. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Elder Meng raised his brows. “Mo Yi, it is enough that you and Jiang Lang have disregarded the Jiang Family rules. Now, your daughter has only just returned to the Jiang Family and has already done something wrong. How can we let her off!”

“What has my daughter done wrong?” Mo Yi raised her brows slightly.

Elder Meng glanced at Jiang Yiming and the others.

Only then did Jiang Yiming snap out of the trance induced by Mo Yi’s intimidating air.

Jiang Yiming was still young when Jiang Lang and Mo Yi left the Jiang Family, so he had no impression of them. He had only heard Jiang Family members mention them a few times.

A youth standing next to Jiang Yiming advanced. He saw that Mo Yi looked frail, and with Elder Meng to back him up, he was not afraid. He said, “Ye Qingtang hit my Brother Yiming for no reason. All of us witnessed it.”

Mo Yi was pale as her eyes swept over the youth’s face.

“Did you see it?”

“That’s right,” said the youth.

“Which of your eyes saw it?” Mo Yi asked indifferently.

“Of course both eyes saw it… Ah!!” Before the youth could finish speaking, Mo Yi’s figure flashed by as she dug out the youth’s eyes. Then, in a flash, she returned to her original spot, but her pale and slender fingers held a pair of eyeballs that were dripping with blood.

“How can someone with no eyes see?” Mo Yi lifted her chin slightly. She squeezed her fingers together and squashed the eyeballs.

The thick scent of blood immediately spread through the front courtyard.

No one expected Mo Yi to suddenly strike and dig out the youth’s eyeballs!

Even Ye Qingtang, who was watching from the sidelines, was dumbfounded.

Now, she really believed that this frail-looking Mo Yi was really the vicious demon in legends…

Truly…

One cannot judge a book by its cover.

“Mo Yi! How dare you injure someone!!” Elder Meng glared at her.

Jiang Liu, who had not even managed to greet Mo Yi, was shocked.

“Injure someone? Did anyone’s eyes see me injure someone?” Mo Yi blandly glanced at everyone present.

Jiang Yiming and the other youths, who had been so aggressive, were now shocked into silence when they saw Mo Yi dig out their companion’s eyes. All of them shivered uncontrollably.

Who would dare to say they had seen it?

If they said so, wouldn’t their eyeballs be dug out too?

“Seems like no one saw it. Elder Meng, you must be getting old, and your eyesight is failing. Why would I injure someone for no reason?” Mo Yi laughed softly. As everyone stared, she calmly took out a handkerchief and slowly wiped the stains off her hands.

Elder Meng’s expression grew even grimmer. “Mo Yi, don’t you use these tactics to intimidate the youths of my Jiang Family. I may be old, but I can still see clearly. You have turned a blind eye to your daughter’s violence and severely injured a Jiang Family member. You are impudent!”

“Impudent?” Mo Yi casually tossed the bloodstained handkerchief aside. Her eyes suddenly grew sharp.
