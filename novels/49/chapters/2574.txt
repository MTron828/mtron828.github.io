Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched when she heard the man’s words. Was this man doing this on purpose? Did he think she wanted to be here?

Before Ye Qingtang could respond, the man asked, “Do you have anything to eat?”

“Food?” Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang took out the remaining beef rations from her space ring.

“Thank you.” The man’s eyes flickered. In the blink of an eye, the beef jerky in Ye Qingtang’s hand disappeared and reappeared in the man’s hand.

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck. What kind of sorcery was that?

However, Ye Qingtang did not mind and asked, “Brother Tian, you said that I have karma fire in my body and that I can’t die… What do you mean?”

“I don’t know.” The man seemed to be uninterested in answering Ye Qingtang’s question. He just continued to eat his beef jerky.

In the blink of an eye, the man finished all the food.

“Do you have any more?” The man looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “No, you finished it all.”

“Do you have wine?” the man asked again.

In this land of despair, Ye Qingtang did not mind even if the other party was a lunatic as long as there was someone to chat with. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Sure.” The man nodded. “Are you sure? If you are, you can leave immediately.”

“Yes, send me out.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Okay. Bring more strong wine the next time. The stronger the better,” the man said.

Ye Qingtang was about to say something when everything before her disappeared in a flash. There was no bone-piercing cold wind, no man who called himself Tian, no fiendcelestials who were suffering for eternity.

“This…!”

Ye Qingtang looked around and her pupils constricted.

“Ancient God Karma Tunnel?!”

Ye Qingtang gasped. She had returned to the Ancient God Karma Tunnel!

“am I dreaming?” Ye Qingtang pinched her face.

The sensation was very real.. She was not dreaming,
