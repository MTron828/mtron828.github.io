Chapter 1123 Demonic Creature 1

Ye Qingtang glanced at the little white tiger meaningfully. Before she could say anything, Ling Yan’s voice was heard once again.

“Miss Ye, this place is not safe to stay long.”

“Why…” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Leave the city now and don’t look back,” Ling Yan said.

“F*ck you… This rich*ss… It’s easy for you to say…”

The little white tiger was full of grudges when it heard what Ling Yan said.

Ling Yan was a prince and naturally did not lack valuable items, but it lacked many!

However, before the little white tiger could finish its sentence, Ye Qingtang directly grabbed the little white tiger, which continued to complain incessantly, and dashed out of Sky Stars City without looking back. The Blood Moon Elder followed after tightly when he saw Ye Qingtang leave.

“F*ck. You’re really leaving!!” The little white tiger glared at Ye Qingtang.

As the little white tiger finished speaking, an extremely frightening overbearing force instantly enshrouded the entire Sky Stars City.

A pair of enormous eyes appeared in the sky, and black rays of light emerged in the eyes.

Boom…

Boom Boom!!

The entire city shook tremendously.

Outside the city, Ye Qingtang was shaken when she saw the owner of that pair of eyes.

A pitch-black demonic creature near a hundred meters tall was not wearing anything as it walked in the city slowly. With every step it took, the ground of Sky Stars City shook violently as though it was cracking apart.

“Sh*t…”

Looking at that enormous creature, the little white tiger could not help but swear.

If it really remained in Sky Stars City to search for its spoils of war just now…

The little white tiger really had to give it to Ling Yan’s brain. It silently turned to look at Ye Qingtang and said, “What is… that thing… Is it a monster?!”

Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly furrowed, and she shook her head.

The little white tiger could not help but turn around to look at that enormous, black monster in the city. No matter how its skills were, the visual impact was too shocking…

A pair of eyes that were darker than the night contained destructive energy. Every inch of its skin seemed to have an explosive force.

The creature, which was walking upright, hollered furiously. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

There were still many citizens who were alive in Sky Stars City. When that enormous demonic creature appeared, the looming fear spread throughout the city rapidly. Everyone fled in all directions with their life.

However, the human-looking demonic creature suddenly opened its mouth.

As its mouth opened, a gust of wild wind swept into the city instantly.

As the wild wind rushed in, the citizens who were fleeing away were instantly swept into the demonic creature’s mouth.

The cries of children, shrieks of ladies, laments of elderlies… All of these were mixed together at this moment, resembling a howl from hell and causing one to tremble with fear.

The cries of fear and screams shattered everyone’s eardrums.

However, the miserable sounds ended very quickly, and a dead silence ensued.

The ten thousand plus people remaining in Sky Stars City were all swallowed by that human-looking demonic creature in the blink of an eye.

A bloodcurdling chewing sound reverberated in the surroundings as fresh blood gushed out of the demonic creature’s mouth continuously.

A roar erupted from that demonic creature subsequently. The moment its blood-filled mouth opened, fresh minced flesh could be seen in its mouth…
