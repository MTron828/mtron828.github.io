Chapter 1961: Ye You (3)

“You’re really brave aren’t you,” Lady Ghost said with a cold scoff.

Ye You looked at Lady Ghost, then bowed slightly to Ye Qingtang and said, “Holy Lord of Shadows, I have heard great things about your strength. Surely you know that a wise person submits themselves to their circumstances.”

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang did not utter a word.

Ye You continued, “The Ancient You Clan is extremely powerful and the Jiang family shouldn’t have made an enemy out of it. With my strength, I would’ve died before I could do anything. Only the living have any say in what they do.”

“You’re not afraid that I’ll hand you over to the Jiang family?” Ye Qingtang suddenly asked.

Ye You laughed lightly and said, “Holy Lord, you are extremely powerful. The Ancient You Clan is extremely strong now and wants to eliminate all the other ancient clans on the Central Mainland, which makes them your enemy. Holy Lord, you may have held regard for the Jiang family in the past but they’re nothing now. Why would you kill off someone with information on the Ancient You Clan just for a desolate clan?

“You’re pledging your allegiance to me?”

“That’s right.” Ye You spoke frankly without hiding her intentions.

She had known ever since the day she had betrayed the Jiang family that it was no longer her home. She had thought that she could settle down in the Ancient You Clan but had unexpectedly landed in the hands of the Temple of Shadows.

But this wasn’t an issue at all for Ye You.

“My understanding of the Ancient You Clan is far greater than yours or any of the other ancient clans. If you decide to spare me, I promise to be useful. Furthermore, I am no match for you and you can kill me in the future if you ever have doubts about your decision,” Ye You said.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ye You without speaking. After a moment, she raised her hand, signaling for Lady Ghost to retreat.

Lady Ghost shut the gates of the prison as she left, thinking that Ye Qingtang was going to accept Ye You’s conditions.

After all...

From her point of view, the bad blood between Ye You and the Jiang family had nothing to do with the Temple of Shadows. Ye You was an intelligent person and it would be useful if they could use her well.

Ye You couldn’t help but smile as Lady Ghost left. She knew that she had played her cards well and would be able to keep her life.

So what if she had betrayed the Jiang family?

The Jiang family was long gone.

What did she have to fear?

Ye You had seen the powerful battle between the Temple of Shadows and the Ancient You Clan. Even though she didn’t believe that the Temple of Shadows could win against the Ancient You Clan, it wasn’t something she was worried about now.

As long as she remained alive, she would find other ways to return to the Ancient You Clan.

“You said that the plan to lure the Domain Monarch was yours?” Ye Qingtang asked in a level voice.

Ye You nodded and said, “Yes.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

She looked up at Jiang Qin who was hung up in the air and smiled in disdain.

“Jiang Qin wanted to join the Ancient You Clan but was weak. She had no way of finding the Domain Monarch for them and naturally lost her value. I won’t be waiting for my death like her.”

“Hm? So you’re saying that you’re confident of your value to me?” Ye Qingtang spoke calmly.

“Holy Lord, do you know why the Ancient You Clan sent people to wipe out the ancient clans at the start and didn’t reveal their identity at first?”

Ye You knew that she had to give them enough reasons to keep her alive.
