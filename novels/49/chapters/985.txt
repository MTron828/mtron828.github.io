Chapter 986 Rare Treasure (1)

With that, Ye Qingtang did not give Duan Yangjing any time to react and simply shattered Duan Yangjing’s kneecap with a kick. She pressed Duan Yangjing’s head down and smashed it against the floor with a crash.

“One.”

“You bastard! Ye Qingtang, I’ll kill you!!” Duan Yangjing, who was pressed to the ground, had never been humiliated like that.

Crash!

Ye Qingtang lifted Duan Yangjing’s head up and then smashed it on the ground again!

“Two.”

Duan Yangjing’s face had been heavily smashed on the ground twice in succession. His nose bridge had already been smashed to smithereens. Large patches of blood trickled out of his wound onto the ground.

But Ye Qingtang did not seem to notice. She lifted Duan Yangjing’s head up and smashed it onto the ground again!

Crash!

There was another heavy thump. Duan Yangjing’s face was pressed into a depression in the ground. His body twitched a few times, but he did not make another sound.

“Three…” Ye Qingtang straightened up at the last count. Her gaze swept across the faces of the other members of the Duan Family, who had all collapsed on the ground.

The moment Ye Qingtang’s gaze passed over them, they felt a chill spreading throughout their bodies.

“Who else wants revenge?” Ye Qingtang looked at the members of the Duan Family.

The Duan Family members did not dare to even emit a peep.

“Based on the rules, the Duan Family must henceforth pay tribute to the Ye Family every month. Isn’t that right?” Ye Qingtang repeated her question when she saw that no one had replied.

The Duan Family members looked at Duan Yangjing, who had fallen to the ground. They could not tell if he was dead or alive. No one dared to refuse. They all nodded vigorously, each afraid that they would be next.

Ye Qingtang looked at the group from the Duan Family and said, “Scram!”

With that, the Duan Family did not dare linger around any longer. They stood up clumsily and dragged the half-dead Duan Yangjing up from the ground. Then, they hurriedly slunk away from the Ye House.

The Ye Family members only snapped out of their trance when everyone from the Duan Family had left.

“Tang Tang, you…” Ye Ling looked at his daughter, both surprised and pleased.

“Father, these matters are not urgent. I have not had a chance to have a good talk with you since my return. I have some things here that the family might find useful.” Ye Qingtang looked at Ye Ling and sighed inwardly. When she had returned yesterday, she had wanted to have a good chat with her father and also distribute some items in her space ring to everyone in the Ye Family.

But before Ye Ling and the others could comprehend the implications of Ye Qingtang’s words, Ye Qingtang had already opened her space ring. She reached inside…

Cling… Clang…

Ye Qingtang pulled out a pile of weapons. She did not look at them closely and just stuffed a few of them in Ye Ling’s hand.

When everyone from the Ye Family glanced at them, they almost fainted from shock.

The weapons that Ye Qingtang had casually handed over were all divine weapons of yellow grade or above!

“Tang Tang, these things…” Before Ye Ling could finish speaking, Ye Qingtang simply pulled out another pile. When she saw that Ye Ling’s hands were full, she turned and stuffed them into Second Elder’s hands. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Another pile of yellow-grade weapons…

Ye Qingtang pulled out three or four piles. Her father’s and the three elders’ hands were all full.

“And here are some elixirs. They are quite effective in improving your powers. Father, take them and distribute them to everyone.” With that, Ye Qingtang pulled a pile of elixirs out of her space ring and stuffed them in the hands of a youth from the Ye Family.
