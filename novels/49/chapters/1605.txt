Chapter 1606: Parasite (3)

Ye Qingtang looked up slightly and saw a popping vein on Toby’s forehead. Then, she flipped her hand that was grabbing the spear and lifted it with force!

“Arh!”

With a surprised shout, Toby was lifted up entirely with his spear, and before he could react in time, Ye Qingtang abruptly released her grip on the spear!

Boom!

A loud and deep crash echoed in the surroundings, and Toby crashed to the ground violently as his head buzzed.

The loud sound shattered the laughter in the surroundings. Looks of surprise appeared on everyone’s faces as they looked at Toby, who was grimacing in pain.

“What... happened?” Joseph and the others exchanged a look. Why did they not understand the situation before them anymore?

To Toby, it felt as if his organs were shattered as he turned pale from the pain. He slowly looked up in shock at Ye Qingtang, who remained at the same spot.

“Toby, what’s with you? Did you not eat today? You can’t even defeat a little girl?”

The Kingdom Knights who were waiting to see Ye Qingtang make a joke out of herself were evidently displeased. They would never believe that Toby was really thrown to the ground by such a frail and weak-looking girl.

Apart from going easy on her, they could not think of any other possibility.

The ridicule of his comrades rang in his ears, causing him to turn pale immediately. Suddenly, he stood up and forcefully swung his fist toward Ye Qingtang’s head with a growl.

Damn it. How dare this parasite embarrass me in front of everyone!

Ye Qingtang did not avoid Toby’s punch and instead met his fist straight on with hers!

The instant the two fists collided, Toby’s face distorted in pain. There was a sharp and crisp sound as a large force sent Toby flying away!

“Ah!” Toby grabbed onto his fist as he retreated a distance. Dripping in cold sweat, his distorted palm hung beside his body, and it was evident that his bones were crushed.

However, Ye Qingtang’s fist seemed completely unharmed—fair, clean, and perfect as before.

Everyone at the scene was stunned.

If they felt that the previous scene happened because Toby went easy on her, then now... with both fists meeting each other, Toby’s fist was fractured from the impact while Ye Qingtang’s was completely intact. This...

“My hand! Ah!” Clutching his distorted hand, Toby was drenched in cold sweat from the excruciating pain, which almost drove him berserk.

Joseph and the rest returned to their senses from Toby’s cries, and two Kingdom Knights hurriedly brought the injured Toby to receive medical attention.

“Tang, you were too ruthless! Do you want to kill Toby!” The Kingdom Knights immediately berated Ye Qingtang loudly when they saw their long-time comrade injured

“Toby practiced with you out of kindness, but you were evil enough to attack him so fiercely!”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Kingdom Knights and felt that they were more than ridiculous.

They acknowledged Toby and felt that she was at fault for injuring Toby, but if the injured one was her, they probably would humiliate and ridicule her endlessly...

They were clearly the ones who wanted to teach her a lesson first, but now that their man was being taught a lesson instead, they wanted to play the blame game?
