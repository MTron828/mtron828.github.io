Chapter 509 Hunt Down (3)

The Blood Moon Elder was dumbfounded as he suddenly remembered that his current body belonged to that of a Xuanling Sect disciple, Zhou Qu… Zhou Qu was only about twenty years old and obviously did not have an old appearance as the Blood Moon Elder originally had.

“Are you Ye Qingtang|” that elite disciple asked once again with a terrifying demeanor.

“No.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“You’re still denying even with death at the corner?!” The elite disciple scoffed, and he looked at the portrait in his right hand. “No matter how you disguise yourself, I still can recognize you.”

“Since that is the case, why bother with talking crap?” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly.

“You’re a mere disciple of a small sect, yet you dared to challenge my Yunxiao Sect’s prestige. You must die today!” The portrait in the leader’s hand was crushed into dust by the impact of his primordial qi.

“Kill!” The leader waved a hand. The sect ordered that he only needed to bring back Ye Qingtang’s head, and there was no need to keep her alive!

“Wait!” Ye Qingtang suddenly said.

“What last words do you still have!” The leader scoffed. In his eyes, Ye Qingtang was already doomed to die, and he was not afraid that she would escape.

“Before I die, I want to give you all some presents.” A cold laugh emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

As she spoke, the talisman she hid in her hands already started to burn.

“Roar!”

As the talisman was completely burned, an enraged roar suddenly sounded from the sky.

In the next second, over ten enormous ink-black bats lew towards them.

“Array Formation in a talisman… Psychic Curse?!”

A cold glint flickered in the leader’s eyes.

The bats were formed using the magical powers of array formations. They were extremely huge and had a human face but the body of a bat. Just looking at them was horrifying.

In at most a few breaths, the fifteen Yunxiao Sect disciples had already slaughtered the enormous bats formed from the Psychic Curse.

However, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder were nowhere to be seen.

“Senior Brother, they’ve escaped,” reminded a Yunxiao Sect disciple.

“Great. | want to see whether they can escape from my hands!” The elite disciple clenched his right fist tightly.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder had already fled from the forest, and ahead was a wilderness that stretched as far as the eyes could see.

There seemed to be no life in this wilderness.

This was an ominous land.

Fear and uneasiness arose in the heart of anyone who entered. The breath of death had long combined as one with the air, and a chill lingered in the air.

Every breath was torture to humans.

The sand below their feet devoured the hope of the uninvited people without a sound as though it was living.

“Be careful. The Blood Moon Forbidden Curse has been laid on this wilderness. Even an inconspicuous grain of sand can consume the life of any living thing. If you’re uncomfortable, say it early.” The Blood Moon Elder told Ye Qingtang. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Cut the crap. Go quickly,” Ye Qingtang said without turning her head back.

The Blood Moon Elder was slightly stunned as he stared at Ye Qingtang’s back view. Confusion filled his face. Ye Qingtang seemed to be unaffected by the Blood Moon Forbidden Curse. Whiz!

At the same time, the Yunxiao Sect disciples followed tightly after Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder and arrived at the wilderness.

“This is strange…” The leading elite disciple frowned. “Why do I not know that there is such a wilderness here… I’ve never heard of it as well.”

Not far away, the Blood Moon Elder saw the figures of the Yunxiao Sect disciples and snickered secretly.

The Blood Moon Sect Division had laid a Hidden World Array in that forest a long time ago. Without the directions of a member of the Blood Moon Sect, it was simply impossible to find this wilderness.
