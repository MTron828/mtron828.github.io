Chapter 68: The Birthday Banquet (5)

Just the words “Exalted Clans” were enough to instill reverence in the hearts of the people. God knows how many had squandered their whole lives making every possible attempt at joining, but to no avail.

The reason the Great Elder was able to earn his current prestige was not only due to his position in the Ye Household, but mainly because of his granddaughter being recruited into an Exalted Clan.

Given Mu Su’s status, he was indeed more than qualified to refer candidates for the entry examinations.

No one had the guts to approach him for that, but Ye Qingtang had just done it.

Thus, everyone thought she was out of her mind.

Mu Su would never agree!

Ye Qingtang was well aware that that would be the result, had she made the request personally, and that was why she decided to approach the Si household in the first place. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Mu Su and the Si household shared a very special bond, and he would certainly accede to the request if Old Master Si was involved. From Ye Qingtang’s past experience, the young masters of the Si household having successfully joined an Exalted Clan, was mainly due to the merit of Mu Su’s referral.

No one believed Mu Su would accede to Ye Qingtang’s sudden request.

The Great Elder, who was at his worst, managed to turn his mood around upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s impudent request.

To think she would waste all her efforts of inviting Mu Su over such a ludicrous matter, what a joke.

What kind of personage does she consider Mu Su as?

To come all this way to meet her was already a Godsend and she actually had the audacity to push her luck by attempting to use him as a stepping stone!

The color drained from Ye Ling’s face in an instant. He could never have expected his daughter to come up with such an absurd request. He anticipated an ominous reaction from Mu Su, and nearly begged for his forgiveness.

However….

Mu Su only furrowed his brow after hearing Ye Qingtang’s request and even before Ye Ling could speak up, he replied:

“Are you sure you want Xuan Ling’s clan and not the others?”

Given his status, referring Ye Qingtang to an Exalted Clan was not much of an issue, the only problem was, why did it have to be Xuan Ling’s clan.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded explicitly.

In her past, without a spirit root, she only managed to join Xuan Ling’s clan after overcoming great odds. Thus, she was well aware that one could only achieve greater heights by joining an Exalted Clan.

And…. only Xuan Ling’s clan had something that she needed.

“All right.” Mu Su acceded to the request after pondering for a moment.

Though his answer was simple, that was like dropping a bomb which exploded in the Great Elder’s face, whom was totally stunned by it.

Did he just agree to that?

He did!

Mu Su not only acceded to Ye Qingtang’s absurd request, judging from his tone, he even seemed willing to refer her to other Exalted Clans if she ever requested.

Having realized that, the Great Elder went bonkers.

Joining an Exalted Clan was almost deemed an impossible feat. If things were otherwise, he would not have to risk robbing Ye Qingtang’s spirit root for Ye You.

But now…

Ye Qingtang just had to simply ask and she was presented with the entry opportunity!

Although Xuan Ling’s clan was not as big in name as the Cloud-breakers, but they were still considered prestigious. The Great Elder could never stomach the fact of Ye Qingtang turning her life around!

“My Lord, perhaps it might be better for you to know that Ye Qingtang had actually shattered her spirit root? Without it, it’ll be impossible to pass the entry examinations and if the clans ever found out she was referred by your good self, wouldn’t that tarnish your good name?” The Great Elder reminded everyone that Ye Qingtang was, in fact, without a spirit root.

Everyone came to their senses after hearing his words.
