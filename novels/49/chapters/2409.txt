Chapter 2410: Faulty Talisman (1)

“Impossible…” Lu Yuanxiang struggled to move forward to check the teenager’s hand.

The crushed remnants of that talisman were all that remained in that hand. This sudden change in the situation filled everyone with anxiety.

“Is this a faulty talisman? Don’t tell me someone tampered with it?” Yun Chen frowned slightly.

The entrance to the Wailing Well only allowed people to enter and no one could exit from it. The rules also stated clearly that the only way to leave the Wailing Well was to use the teleportation talisman.

But crushing the talisman meant that the team would be disqualified. No team would do that under normal circumstances.

“This talisman has been in my space ring the entire time. I did not take it out even once before this. No one should have been able to tamper with it.” Lu Yuanxiang was frowning deeply. His body was already wrecked with exhaustion and intense pain. This new situation was an added burden.

Their team was in no condition to remain inside the Wailing Well. If not for Ye Qing, Lu Yuanxiang would have probably died here. The rest of the team were all gravely injured and they could not possibly continue in such a dangerous environment.

They wouldn’t even be able to handle any adult demons now, not to mention that powerful monster earlier.

Lu Yuanxiang looked increasingly grim. The teenagers in his team were also panicking. No one knew what was going on.

The teleportation talismans had been handed out to everyone at the same time. Lu Yuanxiang immediately kept his team’s talisman into his space ring the moment he received it. He thought that they would never need to use the teleportation talisman. Now, it had become their sole chance of survival.

But this route to survival had disappeared right before their eyes.

Despair engulfed the entire team.

“Boss, what’s going on? Why did their teleportation talisman fail?” Jing Ze couldn’t help feeling puzzled.

As the crucial life-saving tool, there should have been zero mistakes in its preparation.

For the moment, Ye Qingtang also had no idea what was going on. She took out their own talisman from her space ring and examined it.

There appeared to be nothing wrong with it.

It would be useless even if Ye Qingtang handed their teleportation talisman to Lu Yuanxiang. Each talisman was assigned to fixed members. Even if she handed her talisman to someone else to activate, her team would be the ones teleported out.

“Teacher… what should we do?” The teenagers looked at Lu Yuanxiang in helpless panic. They had encountered a powerful monster and were all gravely injured. It would be certain death for them if they remained in the Wailing Well.

Lu Yuanxiang looked increasingly ashen. He knew how severe things were now.

“Don’t worry.” Ye Qingtang spoke up as she looked at Lu Yuanxiang’s increasingly pale face. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Teacher Ye, do you have a plan?” Lu Yuanxiang looked at Ye Qing. He had disdained this youth previously, but he was now looking at this very same youth as his final hope at survival.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the two small balls floating above them.

“Vice-President and the others can see our situation via those balls. They should have noticed something is wrong. We cannot confirm what happened with your talisman. But this does not prevent us from conveying a message to them.”
