“Eldest… Eldest Young Lady… Thank… Thank you for… protecting… this mainland… The person… I admire the most… is you, Eldest Young Lady… Eldest Young Lady… I’ll tell you a… secret… A lot of us… Ye Family disciples… like you… and said… we want to… marry… you… in the future…” Ye Leng said weakly. It seemed as though he wanted to smile, but he did not even have the energy to squeeze out a smile.

“Eldest… Eldest Young Lady… I lied to you… I… am very scared… I don’t wish to die…” Ye Leng was suddenly extremely worked up, and he spat out large mouthfuls of blood as he spoke. “Save… save me… Otherwise, my grandfather Bai Kui… will… be… sad…”

His determined eyes were filled with mist. Ye Qingtang hugged Ye Leng’s upper body tightly until he could no longer speak, and his teary eyes closed forever.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang stood up and turned into a blur, slashing at the Ancient You Clan masses not far away.

“Little Leng…”

In no time, Elder Bai Kui slashed his way to the spot and was dumbstruck when he saw Ye Leng’s half body.

“I want you all… to be crushed to pieces!!” Elder Bai Kui roared to the sky and charged towards the Ancient You Clan camp ahead along with Ye Qingtang.

Puff!”

Elder Bai Kui immediately slashed an unprepared You Yang Lord at his waist with one strike.

“Arh?!”

Seeing that a Yang Lord was killed, the remaining Yang Lords were shocked, and anger riled up within them subsequently as they surrounded Elder Bai Kui.

“I want you all… to be buried with my descendant!!”

Elder Bai Kui did not have the slightest intention to back away in the face of several Ancient You Clan Yang Lords.

“Elder Bai Kui… retreat quickly!”

Ye Qingtang, who was fighting with other Yang Lords currently and could not get away, shouted at Elder Bai Kui loudly.

Puff…

However, with numerous Yang Lords opposing him, Elder Bai Kui was defeated in an instant.

Whiz!

With a bow in hand, a Yang Lord released ten arrows at top speed, which simultaneously shot towards Elder Bai Kui, who was already badly battered.

Puff!”

Sounds of a sharp weapon piercing into flesh rang successively.

Blood seeped out of the corner of Elder Bai Kui’s lips, but he still stood tall and straight. The ten arrows had penetrated through his body.

“It’s a pity that I cannot… continue to fight this war with you… Eldest Young Lady… Thank you for your care… in this period of time…” Resolution filled Elder Bai Kui’s eyes as a force of destruction emerged from his body.

“He wants to self-destruct?!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Yang Lords were shocked after sensing the force of destruction on Elder Bai Kui’s body.

“Quickly run!”

One of the Yang Lords shouted.

The self-destruction of a Yang Lord could pose as an extremely huge threat to an Arcane Supremacy, much less to a Yang Lord.

“Sealed Sky… Technique!”

Seeing that the Yang Lords wanted to escape, Elder Bai Kui formed a print with his palms, and in an instant, a golden screen sealed himself and those Yang Lords in it.

“You have a death wish!”

One of the Yang Lords was enraged and charged towards Elder Bai Kui with a sword in his hand.

Puff!

Elder Bai Kui’s skull was detached from his body instantly but just as he was beheaded, the force of destruction reached its peak.

Boom, boom, boom!!!

A shattering explosion sounded from within the golden screen.
