Chapter 405: Three Sect Competition (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“I have a request to make.” Ye Qingtang went directly to the point.

“Oh? What is it?” Elder Mo fixed his eyes on Ye Qingtang. In this one month, although Ye Qingtang was an in-name disciple under him, she was low-key and never publicized it. She never harassed him on usual days and repaired his weapons very swiftly. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

With that, Elder Mo was rather satisfied with the disciple he just accepted, and thus his attitude towards Ye Qingtang was considered gentle.

“I wish to participate in the Three Sect Competition.” Ye Qingtang replied directly.

Elder Mo’s expression changed slightly as a look of surprise flashed across his eyes.

“You wish to participate in the Three Sect Competition?”

“Yes. Please give me a chance, Master,” Ye Qingtang said firmly. She had to become an elite disciple and enter the mystic realm. The Black Heaven Water in the mystic realm was what she needed the most.

In her previous life, the Black Heaven Water was obtained by Ning Luo in the mystic realm this year. Ye Qingtang was very aware that once she missed the chance this year, she would no longer have any fate with the Black Heaven Water.

Elder Mo looked at Ye Qingtang without saying anything. The Three Sect Competition was of great significance to the sect. Ye Qingtang had only entered the inner sect for over two months, and the priority was to increase her skills. Just based on her credentials, she simply had no qualification to participate in the Three Sect Competition.

“Ye Qingtang, you’ve only entered the inner sect for a short time. The Three Sect Competition is significant to the sect. There’s no need for you to be so anxious to participate in it this year.” It was not that Elder Mo was making things difficult for Ye Qingtang intentionally, but he truly felt she was not suitable.

Ye Qingtang’s spirit root was only a red spirit root, which was too low. There was not much difference at the current stage, but the more her skills increased, the harder it would be for her to improve, making it difficult for her to attain a higher state of cultivation. Moreover, although her skills were considered pretty good amongst the new disciples, it was not outstanding.

To Elder Mo, he admired Ye Qingtang’s talent in forging more.

Ye Qingtang, however, insisted. “I only wish to participate in the Three Sect Competition. Please permit it, Master.”

Elder Mo could not help but have a headache. If other disciples had such a request, he would reject them straight-up without saying anything else. However, he was pretty satisfied with Ye Qingtang’s performance in this one month, and since she was so persistent, it was not nice of him to reject so forcefully.

“You really wish to go to the Three Sect Competition?” Elder Mo asked again after a moment of silence.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang’s gaze was firm.

Elder Mo sighed lightly. “Since you’re so bent on it, I can allow you to. However, even if I permit you to go, you can only be a reserve disciple at most. Are you still willing?”

Previously, the Sect Master wanted them to select some disciples worth training to participate in the Three Sect Competition as a reserve. This type of disciples usually would not need to battle and were merely there to widen their horizons.

If Ye Qingtang really wanted to go, it was not impossible to give her the reserve position.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes twinkled, and she replied immediately. “I am willing. Thank you for agreeing to my request, Master!”

Whether it was a reserve or whatnot, there was a chance as long as she could head to the Three Sect Competition.

Ye Qingtang would not let the slightest opportunity away!

“It is settled then. I will submit your name over. At that time, you can just go with the other selected disciples,” Elder Mo said.

“Noted! I’ll do as you say.”

Elder Mo sighed and then took out an esoteric book from his space ring and handed it to Ye Qingtang.
