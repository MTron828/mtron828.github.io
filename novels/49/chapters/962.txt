Chapter 963 Boy Genius (3)

When the Great Elder heard this, his expression grew warmer. A trace of a smile surfaced in his eyes when he looked at his grandson.

When the younger members of the Ye Family heard what Dan Yifan said, an expectant look surfaced in their eyes.

Did the Duan Family really think they could bully them?

Little did they know that Dan Yifan had returned to the Ye Family. It was time for a showdown with those bastards from the Duan Family!

With that, everyone from the Ye Family exited the main hall and walked towards the courtyard.

A few members from the Duan Family were standing in the courtyard.

They were at most in their early twenties, but all of them had haughty expressions. They stood blatantly in the Ye Family courtyard without showing any signs of fear.

The leader of the group from the Duan Family was a youth in his early twenties. He lifted his chin slightly, and his eyes filled with disdain when he looked at the approaching group from the Ye Family.

“Well? Has the Ye Family completed its preparations?” The young leader asked impatiently.

After the Long Family had settled in Lin Town, its formidable power had firmly established it as the foremost family clan. The original three great family clans had lost the glory of their former days. Instead, the Duan Family, who had curried favor with the Long Family, now used their connections to bully others. Under the Long Family’s banner, they had blatantly demanded tribute from the Si Family and the Ye Family.

This youth had previously come knocking at the Ye Family’s door. The Ye Family had ignored him, but unexpectedly, he then provoked all the younger members of the Ye Family and started a fight.

Ye Ling frowned slightly, and the elders looked displeased.

When Dan Yifan saw what was going on, he immediately stepped forward. He had already learned about the Duan Family’s doings from the letter the Great Elder had sent him.

“Your Duan Family need not stretch out its hands for our Ye Family’s belongings,” said Dan Yifan coldly.

The youth from the Duan Family looked up and saw the unfamiliar Dan Yifan. He frowned impatiently. “Who are you? What right do you have to speak here? Hasn’t the Ye Family learned the meaning of fear? Or is that their skin itching again?”

With that, the youth from the Duan Family rolled up his sleeves and clenched his fists.

This youth was the eldest grandson of the Duan Family’s elder. He had some natural talent, but he was originally no more than a Connate Level Five. However, with the Long Family’s help, he had improved drastically within a year.

Last month, he had broken through to the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. Based on ability, he was currently ranked third among the younger members of the Duan Family.

“I think the person with itchy skin is you.” Dan Yifan laughed coldly, and a cold light flashed across his eyes. “You are just an idiot who recently stepped into the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One, yet you dare to boast here.”

The youth from the Duan Family looked grim. “You are really not afraid to die. Since the Ye Family doesn’t know what is good for it, I don’t mind teaching you the rules of Lin Town!”

With that, the youth from the Duan Family forced his energy to circulate around his body. As his inner qi flowed through his body, he immediately drew the sword at his waist. A gust of sword breath immediately shot out from his sword! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Dan Yifan looked coldly at the oncoming gust of sword breath. His eyes showed no trace of fear. His lips curved slightly in a mocking arch. Then, he suddenly drew his sword, and a red glow flooded the blade of his sword!

The next instant, Dan Yifan casually struck with his sword. A red glow flew outwards and dispersed the oncoming sword breath!

A deafening sound suddenly erupted in the Ye Family’s courtyard.
