Alarmed, Feng Yiran hurriedly withdrew his hands and retreated backward. However, it was as though Fu Lingtian had long guessed Feng Yiran’s actions, and he sprinted forward at top speed and kicked Feng Yiran off the ring right when he retreated.

Feng Yiran was thrown down the ring, and a look of astonishment flashed across his face.

At that very last moment, he clearly felt that Fu Lingtian’s speed doubled. Otherwise, he would have reacted in time.

“Thank you for the enlightenment.” Fu Lingtian stood in the ring alone with an arrogant smile, as he unhurriedly cupped his hands together at Feng Yiran below the ring.

Feng Yiran’s expression was very ugly. During the sparring, he clearly felt that there was not a huge gap between him and Fu Lingtian, but who knew that he would actually be flung off the ring in the end?

“I’ve lost. Thank you for your enlightenment, Brother Fu.” While Feng Yiran was unwilling, he could only hold it in. He walked to sit in front of his master with a pale face.

The Wind Moon Sect elders did not expect Feng Yiran to lose as well, and their expressions were not pretty.

On the other hand, the Qinglin Sect elders were full of smiles and were complacent.

“Zhu Changge, how do you feel after watching their sparring?” Elder Lin, who had been observing the match from below the ring, asked Zhu Changge after seeing that Fu Lingtian was victorious.

“I thought that Feng Yiran and Fu Lingtian were on par, but Fu Lingtian is more experienced and predicted Feng Yiran’s move, which helped him win in the end,” replied Zhu Changge honestly.

“If it were you, how do you think you would fare?” Elder Lin asked again.

“I would definitely not be this careless.” Zhu Changge replied.

“How confident are you?” Elder Lin questioned.

After thinking carefully, Zhu Changge replied. “Sixty percent.”

His skills were at the same level as Fu Lingtian and had been through Elder Lin’s tough training in the past half a year. Furthermore, his battle experiences were not lesser than Fu Lingtian’s. There was nothing special in the match between Fu Lingtian and Feng Yiran. However, he had a card in his hand, and thus his chance of winning was higher.

“Sixty percent…” Elder Mo pondered for a while and uttered. “Changge, this match concerns the sect’s glory. You must put in your one hundred thousand percent in the match. Go along.”

“I’ll do as you say!” Zhu Changge immediately received the orders and entered the ring.

“Zhu Changge from Xuanling Sect. Please enlighten me.” Zhu Changge stood opposite of Fu Lingtian and said with his hands cupped together.

Fu Lingtian requited, and the two confronted each other immediately.

Below the ring, Elder Lin was rather confident in Zhu Changge. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Don’t worry, Elder Mo. Changge will not be as careless as Wind Moon Sect’s Feng Yiran.” Elder Lin looked at Elder Mo, who was frowning.

“That would be the best if that’s the case. However, Fu Lingtian is very steady, and we must not belittle him.” Elder Mo uttered.

“I know that our sect must not lose in the Three Sect Competition this year. Thus, I specially intensified Changge’s training in the past half a year. He already has initial success in the Moonlight Steps Swordplay Technique,” Elder Lin said confidently.

Elder Mo was slightly stunned.

The Moonlight Steps Swordplay Technique was a high-level swordplay technique of Xuanling Sect. Even if it was an initial success, its force was already extremely huge.

After knowing about this, Elder Mo’s heart finally calmed down.

Ye Qingtang was standing not far away behind the two elders at that instant, and the conversation between the two elders fell into her ears.

When Elder Lin spoke with confidence, the corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up secretly.
