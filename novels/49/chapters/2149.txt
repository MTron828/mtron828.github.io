Chapter 2150: Teaching (3)

Mu Ziying was a serious student and Ye Qingtang was a conscientious teacher. After teaching her the key concepts, she let Mu Ziying try the technique out on her own. Then she could come and ask her if she encountered any issues.

Apart from practicing the Spirit Control Line, Mu Ziying would also listen to Ye Qingtang’s teachings on foundational martial art techniques together with Jing Ze.

Whenever there was anything she couldn’t understand, Mu Ziying felt too embarrassed to disturb Ye Qingtang. Instead, she would ask Jing Ze.

Jing Ze was naturally timid and faced with Mu Ziying’s queries, he would go all red-faced. But he still explained it all to her patiently.

“Jing Ze.” Mu Ziying had just finished all her queries when she gave a sudden start. She scanned Jing Ze all over with her pitch-black eyes.

Jing Ze: “...”

He swallowed nervously.

“Your powers seemed to have improved...” Mu Ziying circled Jing Ze. Her abilities were above that of Jing Ze’s, and so she could sense the changes in his body.

Jing Ze was taken aback. He immediately blushed. “Yes... I have improved a little. I will break through to the Seventh Heaven level soon.”

Mu Ziying was startled.

“So fast?”

She remembered that Jing Ze was only at the Sixth Heaven level when Ye Qingtang had arrived. And he had remained stagnant at the Sixth Heaven level for many years without any progress. But he was going to break through after just half a month?!

What kind of demonic speed was this?!

Even the top prodigies in the Netherworld Academy could not possibly advance by a whole level in just half a month!

“Teacher Ye... where did he come from...” Mu Ziying pursed her lips. She was very curious about the mysterious Ye Qing.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang was no longer a lousy teacher in the hearts of Mu Ziying and Jing Ze. Her teachings had opened a brand new doorway for them both. In fact, her status in their hearts had become extremely high.

“I don’t know but I feel very lucky to have met Teacher Ye.” Jing Ze gave a silly smile.

The hint of a smile also appeared in Mu Ziying’s eyes. She hugged her puppet tightly and nodded.

Teacher Ye’s appearance was like a bright lamp, lighting up their pitch-black paths.

“Damn, am I seeing things?” Nangong Lie was just passing by the classroom when he saw Mu Ziying also sitting inside. He couldn’t help feeling rather astonished.

Nangong Lie had not come to this classroom over this period of time. He just happened to pass by today, unexpectedly seeing that the strange Mu Ziying was also there.

And that useless Jing Ze.

What was going on?

Had Mu Ziying also been convinced by that Teacher Ye?

Impossible!

Mu Ziying’s powers were even higher than Teacher Ye’s.

Nangong Lie was very curious but saw Jing Ze emerging from the classroom looking like he had something to do. Without a second thought, Nangong Lie immediately turned to leave. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Left alone in the classroom, Ye Qingtang settled down to cultivate. By teaching Jing Ze and Mu Ziying, she was at the same time refreshing her faded past memories on those foundational martial art techniques.

As she quietened down to cultivate, there was a sudden knock at the door. Ye Qingtang rose to open the door and saw Nangong Lie standing outside.

Why had this brat come looking for her?

Ye Qingtang was puzzled.

Nangong Lie had a strange expression on his face, but he grinned when he saw Ye Qingtang. “Teacher Ye, I just saw something and feel that I need to tell you about it. If you are free now, please hurry over to the martial arts faculty’s practice arena to take a look...”
