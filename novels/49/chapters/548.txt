Chapter 549 Blood Moon Holy Lady (1)

That fear was deeply imprinted in their memories to the point that their descendants would have an unknown fear when they heard of the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

If not for the Ultimate Elder’s appearance in that battle which impeded the Blood Moon Holy Lord, the hundreds of super sects would have probably been long destroyed by the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s hands a thousand years ago.

What was a true god?

One that ruled the world with a hand!

What was a true god?

One that killed everyone who went against him!

What was a true god?

One that ignited generations of fear!

When hundreds of sects combined forces and revolted, he wanted to exterminate all of the sects; when no one in the world could accept him, he wanted to massacre everyone!

It was he who once made the Blood Moon war drum resonate throughout the world; it was he who once let the Blood Moon war flag fly high in the sky; it was he who ruled the world in the name of the Blood Moon Sect.

“Blood Moon Holy Lord…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the rather lonely back view of her cheapskate brother in shock.

She originally thought that he was only an ardent worshiper of the Blood Moon Sect who claimed to be the Blood Moon Holy Lord…

Never would Ye Qingtang have thought that the cheapskate brother she picked up on her way back was really the Blood Moon Holy Lord. She did not think that… this Blood Moon Holy Lord would be so “honest.” Even if it was anyone else, they would most likely not believe him as well…

“He… He is the Blood Moon Holy Lord!”

“How can it be? The Blood Moon Holy Lord disappeared for a thousand years. Why would he reappear in the world!”

“Quickly escape… Quickly escape!” “Run!”

After a long while, the hundreds of people from the three super sects were finally sober.

His long blaze-red robe swayed. Although there was only one person before them, he was the pillar of this world, and the gap between them and him was an eternally-insurmountable gap.

In the eyes of the Blood Moon Holy Lord, the so-called super sect was no different from an ant…

In just an instant, hundreds of people fled in all directions. However…

A blood-red screen enveloped the place, and those powerful figures from the super sects who initially fled away in a flurry froze completely.

Ye Qingtang looked into the red screen, where those powerful figures were still like a frozen image

The Blood Moon Holy Lord’s indifferent eyes landed on the Blood Moon Division Head before him.

“Name.”

The Blood Moon Holy Lord asked coldly.

“Replying… Replying Holy Lord, I am one of the thirty-six Division Heads, Jiang Chen!”

Jiang Chen was agitated, and his face flushed. The Blood Moon Holy Lord nodded.

“Why did you want to attack her?” the Blood Moon Holy Lord said.

“Huh?”

Upon hearing that, Jiang Chen quivered, and immense fear filled him.

“I… I… don’t… don’t know her identity… She… She claimed to be a Blood Moon Guardian…” Jiang Chen was extremely nervous.

“Guardian…”

The Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at Ye Qingtang immediately.

“You didn’t tell me your identity…” Ye Qingtang mumbled as she shifted her gaze away guiltily.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord was emotionless. “Didn’t I?”

He seemed to have indeed said that he was the Blood Moon Holy Lord. However, the Blood Moon Holy Lord had disappeared for a thousand years and was a legendary figure on this mainland. How would she believe that he would be so blunt and reveal his identity without any concealment…

All this time, Ye Qingtang thought that her sworn brother was a Blood Moon Sect fanatic and even thought to pull him back from astray one day…

She would have never thought that he would actually be real.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord’s eyes were fixed on Ye Qingtang as though they could bewitch one’s heart.

“Token,” the Blood Moon Holy Lord said.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
