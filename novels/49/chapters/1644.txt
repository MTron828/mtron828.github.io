Chapter 1645: Forced To Concede (4)

To the youths, seeing Jiang Shaobai’s brilliant smile was like catching sight of an evil ghost. They shivered all over and quickly lowered their heads and slunk away.

Ye Qingtang looked at Jiang Shaobai, who had stood up for her, and a trace of a smile surfaced in her eyes.

For a moment, it was as if she was looking at the former Xuanling Sect, the former Falling Sky Valley, and her senior brothers who squabbled violently but always cared for each other...

The once-familiar faces had now vanished. The countless living things and those kindly faces had all been destroyed by the Ancient You Clan.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes dimmed. Her desire to get everything back from the Ancient You Clan grew even stronger.

Father, Master...

Wait awhile. I will certainly save you.

Her road ahead was a lonely one. Ye Qingtang had long been used to facing everything alone—mockery, abuse, contempt.... she paid no heed to any of these. On a road strewn with obstacles, her sole goal was to rescue the ones she once knew.

Now, Ye Qingtang could not help but be warmed by Jiang Shaobai’s protectiveness. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Elder Sister Qing, are you still angry? If you’re still angry, I’ll catch them and beat them up for you,” Jiang Shaobai said with a smile. Her bright eyes shone in the moonlight.

Ye Qingtang subconsciously reached out and patted Jiang Shaobai’s fluffy head.

For a moment, Jiang Shaobai’s smile froze, and a faint blush surfaced on her face. She lowered her head in some embarrassment. Gone was her previous impish look.

“Thank you.”

Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai walked away in the moonlight without noticing two figures hiding in the darkness.

“What does Jiang Shaobai see in that girl? She’s guarded her so closely ever since she entered the valley.” Sitting in the fork of a tree, Jiang Yiran was chewing on a stalk of grass as he looked at the two disappearing figures in bewilderment.

Jiang Yanyun was standing under the tree, his hands behind his back. However, his eyes were fixed on Jiang Shaobai’s figure.

“Elder Brother Yun, what do you think that Jiang Shaobai has been doing outside with the Elder? Do you think it’s about some special cultivation technique?” Jiang Yiran lowered his head to talk to Jiang Yanyun, who was standing under the tree.

Jiang Yanyun’s expression was remote as he glanced at Jiang Yiran. “If you don’t have anything better to do, why not go back and cultivate?”

Jiang Yiran’s face turned pale as he was scolded, but he was used to it.

“Elder Brother Yun, I came in fifth this time. That’s pretty good...”

Jiang Yanyun grunted coldly.

Jiang Yiran subconsciously drew back and said, “I’m just concerned for you...”

Jiang Yiran spoke guiltily. The truth was that he had been looking for an opportunity to torment Ye Qingtang to relieve some of his resentment, but he had unexpectedly run into Jiang Yanyun.

Fortunately, Jiang Yanyun’s presence had prevented him from making trouble for Ye Qingtang. Otherwise, if Jiang Shaobai had seen him...

Jiang Yiran sensed a chill prickling up his neck.

“I just don’t understand what that fellow, Jiang Shaobai, is up to. But anyway, Ye Qingtang will be utterly crushed in the Martial Arts Championship. Then, Jiang Shaobai will also be embarrassed. Unlike you, Elder Brother Yun, not everyone is surrounded by people as capable as I am...”

Jiang Yanyun turned to leave even before Jiang Yiran could finish speaking. Jiang Yiran was left alone in the tree to feed the mosquitoes.

“Hey, Elder Brother Yun... wait for me! I’m not too familiar with the technique that the Elder taught us just now. Can you help me with it over the next few days... Elder Brother Yun!”

Jiang Yiran shouted as he hurried after Jiang Yanyun.
