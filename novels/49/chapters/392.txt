Before Ye Qingtang entered her yard, Ji Xianyuan walked over in a serious face.

“Junior Sister Ye,” Ji Xuanyuan looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

“Yes? Senior Brother Ji?” Ye Qingtang answered.

“I heard about the challenge between you and four people on the Life and Death Ring. I wanted to persuade you, but surprisingly you won! I shall congratulate you on your victory,” Ji Xianyuan said.

Ye Qingtang smiled and nodded. She heard from Fei Ying that Ji Xianyuan visited her a few times during her seclusion period. It seemed that he wanted to persuade her to not go onto the Life and Death Ring. But now that the challenge had ended, the persuasion would be meaningless.

“Thank you, Senior Brother Ji.”

Ji Xianyuan forced a smile and said, “I witnessed the challenge today. Your improvement was indeed amazing. I admitted the fact that I lost to you the other day, but the truth showed me that I still looked down on your ability. If the fight between us happened today, I think I can only avoid at most three attacks from you.”

Ji Xianyuan was quite talented. He was diligent in cultivation and remained focus all the time.

He entered the inner sect with Ye Qingtang together, and he had reached the First Stage of the First Heaven, about to break through to the Second Stage. His improvement was huge, but it was incomparable to Ye Qingtang, who had entered the Second Heaven of the Martial Qi Level One.

“Junior Sister Ye, I have to say that though you are very talented, you should not have killed Song Junqiu just now.” Ji Xianyuan suddenly changed his focus.

“Oh? Why is that so?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Ji Xianyuan scanned through the surroundings to make sure there was no one around.

“His death is not important, but he has some connections with Warden Song. Warden Song has worked in the inner sect for years. He is always very decisive and fierce and is valued by Elder Lin of the Sword Fraction. Today, Warden Song asked you in front of everyone to not kill Song Junqiu, but you still killed him in the end. Though you did not break any of the sect’s rules, you provoked Warden Song. I’m afraid that… this is not very appropriate,” Ji Xianyuan said softly.

Ji Xianyuan really believed in Ye Qingtang’s talent, and that was why he bothered to remind her.

Ye Qingtang’s face remained unchanged. But when she heard the name “Elder Lin,” coldness appeared in her eyes.

The person she resented the most in the Xuanling Sect in her previous life was Elder Lin of the Sword Faction.

In her previous life, when her Heart of the Demon God was exposed, even the Sect Master did not leak out the news, as he valued the sect bond with her. He gave a private command to ask her to leave the Xuanling Sect. However, Elder Lin knew the news and wanted to assassinate her secretly after she left the sect. If Yun Shu had not sacrificed himself for her, she would have been reaped apart by Elder Lin for her heart.

This time, she entered the Xuanling Sect again for the Black Heaven Water in the Mystic Realm. The happenings between her and Elder Lin still remained in her heart.

She would never forget the scene when Elder Lin smashed Yun Shu’s head in front of her.

Under the pouring of rain, the only person who treated her nicely died in front of her eyes. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes and kept her thoughts. She pretended to be casual and smiled at Ji Xianyuan. “Thank you for your concern, Senior Brother Ji. I’m just a normal disciple. I think Warden Song will not purposely make things difficult for me.”

Ji Xianyuan could only sigh as he saw how casual Ye Qingtang was. He reminded her to be more cautious and left without saying anything else.
