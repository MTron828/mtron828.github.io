“Whatever. You can go down first.” It seemed that Elder Lin was unwilling to say anything more as he waved a hand and allowed Ning Luo to retreat first.

Ning Luo left the main hall with many thoughts running across his head. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Senior Brother Ning, arrangements for the outer sect disciples are already made. I heard that there are two green spirit roots this time,” said one inner sect disciple who went up to Ning Luo upon seeing him.

Ning Luo returned to his senses and said flatly, “Even if they have green spirit roots, they’re still merely outer sect disciples. We are from the inner sect. There’s no need to be bothered with it.”

There was a big difference between the inner and outer sect. In every sect, there were many outer sect disciples, but everyone knew that only getting into the inner sect would they be considered a real disciple of the sect and learn the sect’s mystic techniques.

“That’s true.” That disciple scratched his head and continued. “I saw that Elder Lin was unhappy when he came back just now. Did anything happen in the assessment?”

Ning Luo wanted to say something, but when he thought of what Ye You said previously, a sly look emerged in his eyes.

“Nothing much actually. He just met with some irritating thing. This year, things are not as simple as just having only two disciples with green spirit roots in the outer sect. Other than that, our sect even accepted a young girl with a red spirit root as an exception.”

“Red spirit root?” The disciple’s eyes almost fell out when he heard it. “Are you joking? How can a red spirit root enter the sect?”

Ning Luo laughed. “It is no longer important whether it is possible or not. What is important is that the person has already entered our outer sect.”

That disciple’s expression turned weird.

Ning Luo did not say anything else to him, and his mind was preoccupied on another matter.

Ye Qingtang was the person whom Ye You wanted him to give “special treatment” to. Previously when Ye You’s letter mentioned Ye Qingtang, Ning Luo was not concerned about it. After all, Ye You did clearly write that Ye Qingtang was only a red spirit root.

Ning Luo originally thought that it was definitely impossible for such a person to enter Xuanling Sect.

Yet, unexpectedly…

Things did not go as one wished.

Ning Luo was very clear that none of the sects would make an exception for anyone to accept them as a disciple. If they did not pass the assessment, the sect would not give the mighty figures any face regardless of who they are.

He really did not expect Ye Qingtang to pass the Xuanling Sect entrance assessment with a red spirit root.

However…

A smile hung on Ning Luo’s lips.

Regardless of how Ye Qingtang entered Xuanling Sect, she was already a Xuanling Sect disciple from the moment she entered the sect.

If she was someone Ye You wanted to take care of, he would naturally not let Ye Qingtang be too happy in Xuanling Sect.

“Come here.” Ning Luo waved at a disciple nearby who went forward immediately.

“Help me pass a message to Zhou Xuan from the outer sect,” Ning Luo said.

“Zhou Xuan? Senior Brother Ning, just tell me what you want me to pass on to him,” replied the disciple very obediently. Ning Luo had outstanding skills and was one of the best amongst the inner sect disciples. Moreover, the Sword Faction’s Elder Lin favored him, and, thus, he had a certain level of influence in the inner sect.

Ning Luo smiled and had the person lean over as he quietly whispered something into his ears.

After listening to it, the disciple could not help but look shocked; however, his face returned to normal very quickly.

“Senior Brother Ning, I will definitely pass this message.”

“Go ahead.” Ning Luo waved a hand without emotions.

“Yes.”

Looking at that disciple’s departing back view, the smile on Ning Luo’s face deepened.

Ye Qingtang, I will definitely “take care of you well” on behalf of Ye You.
