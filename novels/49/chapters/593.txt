Chapter 594: The Palace (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Though the palace was full of danger, there was at least hope that they could survive. If they did not enter the palace and fought against the demonic monster born from resentment, there was no chance that they would survive. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Qingtang estimated that the demonic monster was at least at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. Unless the big figures of the super sects were the ones who took action, others who wanted to fight against it would face the consequence of death.

“Are you sure that we are going to enter the palace?!” A sect disciple was still frightened by the scene he saw just now. He was not willing to step into the palace at all.

“If you’re not willing to go in, feel free to stay outside and fight the demonic monster.”

Ye Qingtang scanned through the person coldly.

“You…”

The sect disciple gritted his teeth but sighed eventually.

Ye Qingtang’s words were very straightforward, but they were true. That sect disciple was not stupid. It was obvious that they would lose even if all of them combined their forces to fight the demonic beast.

Based on their current situation, there was no other choice besides entering the mysterious palace that was full of danger.

Ye Qingtang dashed into the palace first. Others did not hesitate and followed her path to enter the unknown palace.

Ye Qingtang stopped for a second after entering the palace. She turned over and looked towards the desert.

The huge demonic monster was just staring at them from afar. It did not have the intention to enter the palace.

However, Ye Qingtang felt more disturbed.

“Who are you!”

A roar came from the palace suddenly.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder looked towards the direction where the sound came from.

There were around sixty to seventy people standing in the hall of the palace.

Besides people from the normal sects, there were powerful people from Yunxiao Sect, Lingyun Sect, and other super sects.

“We are sect disciples!” Ye Qingtang replied calmly.

The starting of the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka was beyond everyone’s expectations. The conflicts between the two dynasties were set aside for now. Leaving the Hell of Avicinaraka alive was the key focus for everyone.

Any conflicts and resentment could only be present if they were alive. If they were a cluster of bones, nothing would be left…

Everyone here understood that.

People in the hall sized up Ye Qingtang and the team but did not say anything.

“I’m Feng Cong, disciple of the Falling Sky Valley. May I know what happened here?” Feng Cong stepped forward and asked one super sect disciple.

“We’re not sure as well. People from different sects were all separated when we entered the mystic realm. We met these people along the way, and we entered the palace when we were walking in the desert to seek for possible treasures. However, the moment we entered, the Yuehua Sect Master killed his own Great Elder and a few disciples…” The young man was very anxious and disturbed.

“Yuehua Sect master?”

Everyone was shocked when they heard that.

They thought that there was a powerful creature in the palace from the bloody scene they witnessed outside. However… the Yuehua Sect master was the one who murdered others!

The ability of a super sect sect master too powerful to imagine. If people like him started attacking and killing others, the consequences would be too dreadful to think of.
