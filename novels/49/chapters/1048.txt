Chapter 1049 Skill (6)

Moreover, how could a dignified Fiendcelestial Beast fancy an ordinary sect disciple! The lady before them was none other than a genuine, unrivaled Yang Lord!

“Damn it… Which dimwit released false information that the person who obtained the infant Fiendcelestial Beast was an ordinary Xuanling Sect disciple…” The Lingyun Sect Grand Elder gritted his teeth.

At this instant, the Yuehua Sect Sect Master shuddered as he looked at the Ye Family war flags, which were held high by the talented youths. It was at this moment when he finally understood what the “Ye” surname on the war flag represented.

The name of this Yang Lord was probably Ye Qingtang, and the Ye war flag probably represented the family clan of this Yang Lord…

“No wonder… No wonder Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui and that veteran Yin Yang Perfected Lord proclaimed to be a member of the Ye Family….”

For a daunting family clan with a powerful figure at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven, it was Bai Kui’s and Daoist Zijin’s honor to join the family clan!

“Se… Senior… I was unaware of your arrival. Please pardon me and not be hard on me!” The Yuehua Sect Grand Elder stared at Ye Qingtang in horror.

He was facing an authentic Yang Lord!

“I remember that you wanted me to hand over the Fiendcelestial Beast?” Ye Qingtang stared at the Yuehua Sect Grand Elder and said coldly.

Upon hearing that, the Yuehua Sect Grand Elder shuddered and instinctively shook his head without thinking. “No no no… Senior, I did not say that… It’s… It’s him! He said it!”

The Yuehua Sect Grand Elder immediately pointed at the Ling Yun Sect Grand Elder.

“Don’t spout nonsense. When did I ask senior to hand over the Fiendcelestial Beast… I don’t even know what a Fiendcelestial Beast is. What do I need it for? It must be you. You offended the senior and want to shift the blame to me now!” Lingyun Sect Grand Elder denied anxiously.

“Humph. It’s clearly you who asked the senior for the Fiendcelestial Beast. Why don’t you dare to admit it! Even saying that you don’t know what a Fiendcelestial Beast is… I think you’re the one who is spouting nonsense!” Yuehua Sect Grand Elder sneered.

The hundreds of talented Ye Family disciples behind Ye Qingtang snickered as they watched the two Grand Elders of super sects blame each other. This was the so-called powerful Grand Elder of a super sect. Before absolute strength, they were just like clowns. If their super sects’ disciples were present and saw their own Grand Elder behaving this way, how would they think? Would they feel the slightest disgrace? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Previously, when Ye Qingtang appeared, the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master, Great Elder, and even Grand Elder were delighted. However, after knowing that Ye Qingtang was an unrivaled Yang Lord, they were completely dumbfounded.

“Didn’t the two of you want to protect Yunxiao Sect?” A Ye Family Branch Master looked at the two Grand Elders and scoffed.

“Yunxiao Sect?!”

Lingyun Sect Grand Elder shook his head repeatedly. “Senior Ye, this is a misunderstanding. A great misunderstanding. We are actually not that close with Yunxiao Sect… We just happened to pass by here today and came in to take a seat… Senior, we have nothing to do with your enmity with Yunxiao Sect!”

“Right, right, right! Senior Ye, we have nothing to do with YunXiao Sect. This Yunxiao Sect is really audacious. How dare they offend you, senior! They deserve to die! Definitely deserve to die! Senior, if you need us to do anything, just tell us!” Yuehua Sect Grand Elder added hurriedly.
