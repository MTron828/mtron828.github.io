1414 Competing Your Wealth With Me? 1

“Continue,” Ye You said.

“Ninety thousand!” Ye Xun offered immediately. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“One hundred thousand.” The girl in the shadows seemed to be against Ye You. As long as Ye You’s side offered a bid, she followed immediately after without hesitation.

Beidou Demon Lord, who was originally utterly despondent, was taken aback when the little girl beside him suddenly began to compete with the two ladies from the Jiang Family fiercely.

“Little girl, do you want this Bone of the Dragon Breath as well?” Beidou Demon Lord asked curiously.

Ye Qingtang smiled at him without saying anything.

Then, Ye You seemed to be rather impatient and simply told Ye Xun to offer a shocking amount to win Ye Qingtang’s bid of one hundred thousand spirit coins.

“One hundred and fifty thousand spirit coins!”

Everyone gasped at the bid.

One hundred and fifty thousand spirit coins?

This was an amount that no family clan dared to imagine.

This lady is indeed from the Jiang Family; her bidding is simply gallant!

The entire auction was halted for a moment as the offer price of fifteen thousand spirit coins was shouted, and the girl in the shadows did not seem to have any thoughts of raising the bid.

A smile emerged on Ye You’s face.

Ye Xun said, “That girl really overestimated herself. How dare she fight with you, Sister You? Who doesn’t know that grandfather, the Domain Monarch, dotes on you the most? With the entire Jiang Family on your back, who could win against you?”

The Domain Monarch was extremely attentive to Ye You, his granddaughter whom he found after losing her. For Ye You’s trip to Burnt City, he specially sent an elder to follow her and even gave her two hundred thousand spirit coins to spend freely.

Ordinary family clans could not accumulate two hundred thousand spirit coins even if they sold all their assets.

However, in the Jiang Family, it was merely a small token of affection from the Domain Monarch to his granddaughter.

For a moment, many were overwhelmed with emotion at the thought of the Jiang Family’s wealth.

But just as everyone thought that the ultimate bid price of the Bone of the Dragon Breath was one hundred and fifty thousand spirit coins, that girl who had remained silent suddenly said an amount that left everyone agape.

“Three hundred thousand.”

Everyone in the auction house froze.

Three hundred thousand spirit coins?

Does that girl even know that she bid such an unimaginable price?

Even Ye You and Ye Xun were utterly stunned.

Three hundred thousand spirit coins?

What joke is this?

They had a little over two hundred thousand spirit coins on their hands at most, and that was an amount that others did not even dare to imagine. Yet, that girl actually offered an astronomical price of three hundred thousand spirit coins?

It was double the price that Ye You offered!!

The smile on Ye You’s face froze completely, and a layer of frost seemed to plaster over her face.

Ye Xun’s expression turned ugly as well. Seeing the displeasure on Ye You’s face, Ye Xun immediately said, “This friend over here, do you know that this Lady Ye You is the biological granddaughter of the Domain Monarch? She wanted this Bone of the Dragon Breath first…”

She did not believe that the person would not retreat after hearing the Domain Monarch title.

But before Ye Xun could finish her sentence, the girl in the shadows snickered and said, “This is an auction. If you want the item, use your money to auction for it. If you don’t have money, then stop harassing others. The highest bidder wins the item. Don’t you know the rules of an auction?”

The words Ye Xun insulted Beidou Demon Lord with were now shoved back in her face by that girl in the shadows.

Ye Xun froze and wanted to retort.
