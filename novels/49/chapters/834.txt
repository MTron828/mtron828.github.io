Chapter 835 Appearance of A Supremacy

Since they knew that the Peerless School were still unable to destroy the Diamond Boulder, they only needed to deal with those three people directly that were guarding the place right now. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, Ye Qingtang did not bother with Master Du and looked at the sky with a serious expression.

Noticing that, Master Du followed Ye Qingtang’s gaze and scanned the air above.

Whiz!

In a flash, a piercing sound rang, and a light twinkled in the sky.

In the next second, an elderly in a Daoist robe descended from midair gradually.

“Oh... the Wintry Yin aura is so intense here, and it’s even guarded by people. Could it be the entrance of the Dragon Vein?” The elderly in a Daoist robe mumbled to himself.

Ye Qingtang and Master Du watched that mysterious elderly, who appeared out of nowhere, in the dark without making a sound.

At this instant, the three Peerless School outer sect disciples looked at the elderly at the same time.

“Leave this place immediately or die!”

One of the Peerless School disciples shouted sternly at the elderly.

The elderly had a normal expression and did not seem to be angered.

“Brothers, can I ask if this place is the entrance to the Dragon Vein?” The elderly in a Daoist robe asked with a smile.

“You actually know about the Dragon Vein?” A Peerless School disciple asked with a deep voice.

“Haha, I have only heard about it.” The elderly nodded.

“I originally intended to let you live, but since you know about the Dragon Vein and found this place, I’m afraid I can’t let you leave this place alive today.”

A Peerless School disciple unsheathed his sword sharply and walked towards the elderly in a Daoist robe with great strides.

“Ah. Are the younger generations on this mainland so irritable?” The elderly in a Daoist robe had a disappointed expression.

“What nonsense are you saying, old thing!” The Peerless School who wielded the sword shouted coldly.

“Little friend, upon seeing me, a Supremacy, you did not bow and even wielded a sword, wanting to take my life. I cannot spare your life today,” the elderly in a Daoist robe said.

“Supremacy?”

The three Peerless School disciples exchanged a look and subsequently convulsed with laughter.

The most powerful realm on this mainland was merely the Yang Lord of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Where did a Supremacy come from!

In this world, only those whose skills had entered the Arcane Supremacy dared to refer to themselves as a Supremacy. Yet this Daoist priest called himself a Supremacy?!

Swoosh!

Without seeing the elderly in a Daoist robe do anything, the armed disciple’s head was slashed as he was laughing, and blood spattered all over the yellow sand.

When this sight fell in the eyes of the other two Peerless School disciples, the unbridled laughter stopped immediately, and disbelief filled their faces.

Since they could become the outer sect disciples of Peerless School, their martial endowments and skills were already classified as superb. Their skills were about the same as that of the Grand Elders of ordinary sects and were at least at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three.

Yet, the two Peerless School disciples did not even see the elderly in a black robe strike. It was as though their senior brother’s neck broke by itself...

“This...”

Astonished, the two Peerless School disciples retreated instinctively.

Swoosh!

The elderly in a Daoist robe raised his right arm gently with a smile.

In a flash, another Peerless School disciple’s skull exploded and shot out.

“Ah... How... How can this be!” The last remaining Peerless School disciple was extremely shaken.
