When Li Jingwen said that, the Blue Cloud Peak disciples had a complacent expression on their faces as they looked at Ye Qingtang and Yan Shu in disdain.

Yan Shu never expected Li Jingwen to be so overboard. He was about to say something, but Ye Qingtang suddenly walked forward and shut Yan Shu up.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up, and she scoffed coldly while looking at the Li Jingwen with head held high. “Are you all done? Who said I’m here today to apologize? Li Jingwen, if you want me to apologize, win against me first.”

When Ye Qingtang said that, all the Blue Cloud Peak disciples were completely dumbfounded.

In the next second, everyone looked at the reckless Ye Qingtang unbelievably.

“What is she saying?”

“Is she crazy? With her dilettantish skills, she still dares to yell at Eldest Senior Brother?”

Li Jingwen was delighted. “Ye Chen, you do talk big. Since you really don’t know how to appreciate favors, there’s no need for me to be polite with you anymore. Since you wish for us to learn from each other, I’ll play with you then.”

Then, the Blue Cloud Peak disciples beside Li Jingwen retreated immediately and grinned as they looked at Ye Qingtang, who courted death.

Yan Shu was completely dumbfounded. He did not think that Ye Qingtang would be so bold.

Li Jingwen was the number one disciple in Blue Cloud Peak. There were only a few people out of the tens of thousands of disciples in Falling Sky Valley who could win against Li Jingwen.

Yan Shu wanted to persuade Ye Qingtang out of it, but she did not even intend on giving him a chance to speak. She immediately took a step forward and announced. “Make your move.”

Li Jingwen looked at Ye Qingtang with a raised brow. He had seen people who wanted to die, but not one who wanted to die so bad.

She actually let him make the first move?

“Eldest Senior Brother, don’t go easy on her. This fellow clearly has it coming.” The Blue Cloud Peak disciples hooted, eager to see Ye Qingtang being beaten up by Li Jingwen.

Li Jingwen did not spare any talk with Ye Qingtang and drew his sword out immediately. Suddenly, an overbearing sword aura was injected on his blade

In just a moment, Yan Shu’s heart rose up to his throat.

Looking at the light blue sword aura on Li Jingwen’s blade, Yan Shu was alarmed by the impending trouble.

Li Jingwen actually executed the Cold Winter Sword Aura, which the Blue Cloud Peak’s Peak Master created at his first move!

The Cold Winter Sword Aura was Blue Cloud Peak’s Peak Master exquisite skill which had an extremely-shocking lethality. When injured by the sword aura, the cut would immediately freeze, and the Bitter Poison in the sword aura would subsequently enter the person’s body.

Li Jingwen had already mastered seventy percent of this Cold Winter Sword Aura, and using it now was evident that he was not going to spare any mercy!

“Junior Brother Ye, be careful!” Yan Shu shrieked in alarm. The moment he spoke, Li Jingwen had already turned into a bolt of blue light as though he became one with the Cold Winter Sword Aura, and he dashed towards Ye Qingtang!

The faint blue ray had a bone-piercing cold air, and the temperature in the air dropped.

Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground, and a murderous expression flashed across her eyes as she looked at Li Jingwen who rushed to her.

“Is that fellow dumbstruck from the shock?” The Blue Cloud Peak disciples could not help but snicker when they saw that Ye Qingtang did not move an inch.

As long as Ye Qingtang was grazed by the Cold Winter Sword Aura, she would definitely be injured by the Bitter Poison.

This was simply a battle without any suspense.
