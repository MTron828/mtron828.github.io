1379 Boundless Power 3

the wine decanters had been empty, but now, they were filled with excellent wine.

the yuan emperor was shocked when he saw everyone pouring out wine. he picked up the formerly empty decanter and tilted it in disbelief…

wine fumes entered his nostrils as clear, excellent wine flowed from the spout.

“this… this… really is the wine given by the immortal…” the yuan emperor looked shocked. “no wonder the qi emperor said that the wine given by the immortal cannot be drunk whenever you like. the decanter was empty, but the immortal used his powers to give us wine…”

the yuan emperor was afraid to miss out on the immortal’s kindness, so he drank deeply.

“immortal wine is truly exceptional…” he looked deeply satisfied.

ye qingtang took the wine decanter and glanced at it. then, she swept a glance under the feet of the flying ambassadors. her lips arched, but she did not say anything.

“yuan emperor, is the wine given by the immortal nice?” the qi emperor asked suddenly.

the yuan emperor was intoxicated by the immortal’s kindness and said without thinking, “of course it’s nice.”

“you’ve never drunk it before, right? why? has your yuan kingdom’s immortal ever given you wine?” the qi emperor was just waiting for the yuan emperor to respond like that before he pounced.

the yuan emperor’s expression stiffened. he knew that the qi emperor was sneering at him.

but before the yuan emperor could reply, a white-haired old man suddenly rose and kneeled before the ambassadors.

“please, immortal, have mercy and save my son…” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

this old man was an adherent of the dragon court sect and had been a sincere believer for many years. he had one son who also believed in the dragon court sect. but not long ago, the son was involved in an accident—while out hunting, he was attacked by wild beasts and killed.

the old man had come here today to plead the immortal to bring his son back to life.

“you have believed in our dragon court sect wholeheartedly. the immortal is naturally aware of your sincerity. but it is up to the immortal whether he will save your son. has your son’s body been properly preserved?” an ambassador said loftily.

“yes, yes, yes… i ordered someone to make an ice coffin,” the old man nodded vigorously.

the ambassador nodded slightly and left to report to the immortal.

a low and melodious voice suddenly rang out from beyond the jade door.

“bring your son forward.”

the moment this voice rang out, all the believers in the hall looked expectant.

“thank you, immortal! thank you, immortal!” the old man immediately kowtowed gratefully. this voice belonged to the dragon court sect’s immortal. since the immortal had said that, it meant he had agreed to the old man’s plea.

when everyone saw this, they were filled with envy at the old man’s good fortune.

before long, the old man had ordered the ice coffin holding his son to be carried forward.

in the ice coffin was a middle-aged man, about thirty years old or so. his face was ashen and his lips bloodless. his chest remained still and did not rise and fall. he was dead.

at that moment, everyone’s gaze was centered on the ice coffin. they were waiting for the immortal to use his powers to resurrect the dead.

ye qingtang’s gaze was also on the ice coffin.

the next moment, a flash of light suddenly flew from the jade door and sank into the ice coffin.

the crystal clear ice coffin was instantly covered with a blinding red glow.

when the red glow slowly vanished, the body in the ice coffin suddenly moved.

“he’s alive… he’s really alive…” the yuan emperor stared in wonder at the dead man, who was now struggling to sit up in the ice coffin. he was more shocked than anyone else present.
