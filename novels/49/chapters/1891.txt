Chapter 1892: Breakthrough (1)

At that time, Liu Ruofeng was still not the Poison Emperor. Nevertheless, he had already displayed exceptional talent and it was universally known that he would become the next Poison Emperor. As a result, everyone treated him with the utmost respect.

No one expected him to be humiliated by the very woman whom he had taken a fancy to. He had nearly become the laughingstock of the entire Second Domain.

Ye Qingtang suppressed a smirk. She knew very well that Liu Ruofeng must be seeking out Di Jiuyuan for something much more complicated than that. However, it looked like Long Xiao was unwilling to divulge any further.

If she wished to learn more about her mother, it was likely she would have to go to the Second Domain to investigate.

Although the danger had passed, the security they had now would not hold for long. Ye Qingtang, Long Xiao, and the rest had to find the exit from the mystic realm while it was still dark.

Not only that, Long Xiao and his men were still injured. Although they had yet to find traces of Di Jiuyuan, they did not dare to linger on.

Ye Qingtang and her companions were even more anxious to leave the mystic realm, in case they were once again dragged into this messy affair.

At this point, Ye Qingtang was already very satisfied knowing her mother’s name and family clan. It was more information than she had hoped to find.

Before leaving, Ye Qingtang told Fu Qiu to stay hidden away for the time being. This was in case the Ten Thousand Poison Valley folks came back and failed to find them—Fu Qiu would be unwittingly implicated.

Fu Qiu understood. It handed over a silk box to Ye Qingtang, explaining that this was something her mother had previously left in its care. It asked Ye Qingtang to open it only after leaving the mystic realm.

Before this, Baili Xi and the rest had already been seeking out the exit and found some clues. As a result, they managed to locate the exit rather easily before daylight.

Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief upon seeing the exit from the mystic realm. She was truly exhausted after this long tribulation.

Giving the mystic realm one last glance, Ye Qingtang and the others finally fled from the place.

The world spun around them before Ye Qingtang and her group returned once again to the island. Looking at everyone’s wretched states, they didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to stretch out, an intense power suddenly surged within her.

“What’s wrong?” Jiang Shaobai was startled by the sight of the intensifying light emanating from Ye Qingtang’s body. Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were likewise astounded.

“Ms. Ye, it looks like... you are going to have a breakthrough?” Baili Xi gave a slight frown.

The previous time when they entered the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm, they hadn’t felt anything much while they were inside. But one of their companions had gained a fortuitous experience.

That person didn’t have any reaction at the beginning, but her powers suddenly surged after leaving the mystic realm.

“The powers of the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm would not be revealed while we are inside. Perhaps Ms. Ye had a lucky encounter but didn’t notice it at that time. Brother Jiang, quickly take her back to rest. She looks like she is going to have a breakthrough anytime now,” Mu Feiruo hurriedly advised.

Jiang Shaobai didn’t dare to hesitate. He immediately lifted the dazed Ye Qingtang into his arms and carried both her and Little White Tiger back to their accommodations on the island.

What was going? Ye Qingtang could only feel a burning intensity inside her body, which was now radiating waves of orange light. Her temperature was also rising steadily. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Despite the barrier of their clothing, Jiang Shaobai was already flushed from the heat exuded by Ye Qingtang’s high temperature.

Ye Qingtang’s state of mind was becoming increasingly hazy. She felt like she was submerged in a sea of darkness with orange dots of light continuously flashing at her from all angles. The glowing lights looked like those spirit stones inside the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm.
