Chapter 1987: The Arrival of the Crimson League (3)

Bai Zhi wasn’t someone they could take on.

After a second, Ye Qingtang walked into the main hall with her golden mask on. As soon as she was seated, she spotted the three from the alien race on the black mist.

Ye Qingtang silently touched the cold mist.

What frightening power!

Even though the three ambassadors had not shown their true powers yet, Ye Qingtang’s perception of other people’s power had become more acute after entering the Holy Venerate realm.

In her eyes, the three of them were surrounded by a horrendous level of power, with the person in black robes being the most terrifying one.

This was expected since they were from the Crimson League and their power was vastly different from even the powerful people of the Central Mainland.

Ye Qingtang had no doubt that any of these three could easily wipe out the Ancient Clan people outside. And without sparing much effort at all.

What she was seeing of their powers was merely the tip of the iceberg.

The difference between the First Domain and the Second Domain was truly immense. She had experienced this difference before in her previous life and nothing had changed this time around.

Ling Yan, this double-edged sword of yours isn’t going to be easy to use.

Ye Qingtang was acutely aware of the hostile glance the lady was casting at her the moment she sat down. She made no effort to conceal her hostility.

This was probably the Bai Zhi Xue Fu was talking about.

Inside, Ye Qingtang was despairing. Who knew that there would be an old enemy among the ambassadors that the Crimson League had sent over? Wasn’t she going to die then?

While her heart was in turmoil, she maintained her calm composure and spoke. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What business do the three of you have with me?”

“Mo Yao, why are you asking when you already know the answer?” Bai Zhi asked as she raised her chin slightly.

“Hm? What am I supposed to know?” Ye Qingtang shot back calmly in a steady tone.

“Weren’t you the one who informed the Snow Fox that the Ancient You Clan had an agenda against the Crimson League?” Bai Zhi asked coldly.

“That’s right, I did say that.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and continued, “So you are here for this?”

“Of course.”

Ye Qingtang went on. “I’ve already said all that I want to say. I’m sure that with the Crimson League’s might, you’ll be able to figure out whether I’m telling the truth. Is there any need to ask again?”

Bai Zhi was about to speak when the person in black robes spoke up.

“We will investigate the Ancient You Clan ourselves. We came here today to inform you of something else.”

“What is it?” Just hearing the person in black robes speak was enough to send chills down Ye Qingtang’s spine.

“Long ago, you promised the league that you would find the Netherworld Ring and present it to the Elder. You’ve already been dragging this matter for tens of thousands of years and it’s time for you to fulfill your promise.”

It was at this moment that Ye Qingtang saw what was under the person’s robes. His head was surrounded by black mist and she could not make out his features at all. Her hands turned cold.

She was taken aback as she heard what he said.

Netherworld Ring?

What in the world was that?

The Holy Lord of Shadows owed the Crimson League something?

She was doomed...

Why was there something else she had to settle when she hadn’t even sorted out the Ancient You Clan yet...
