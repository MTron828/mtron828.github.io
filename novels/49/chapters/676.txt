“When you see Ouyang Jian later, just speak as how we planned earlier.” Ye Qingtang told the Blood Moon Elder.

As long as they could get past this stage, the Blood Moon Elder’s identity as the Ouyang family clan’s Young Miss would be solidified. After all, there were rare cases of possessing others’ body. As long as the Blood Moon Elder did not expose himself, there should not be any problems. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

In the hall of the Ouyang family clan, Ouyang Jian was seated at the highest-ranking position. Although he was over fifty years old, he maintained his appearance well. He had a good-looking face, and there was not a single gray hair to be seen.

“Oh? Qian is back?” A smile suddenly broke out on Ouyang Jian’s stoic face. He was extremely happy that his daughter returned safely.

“Yes.” The housekeeper replied honestly.

After hearing that, a handsome man in the hall spoke immediately, “Miss Qian is a good person and is protected by the god. Uncle Ouyang was worried that Qian may meet with danger in this mystic realm. Now that she has returned, your heart can finally be at ease.”

Ouyang Jian laughed. “Qian is stubborn. I originally did not wish for her to head to this mystic realm herself, but I could not convince her. Fortunately, she returned safely though. Since you happen to be here today as well, treat it as welcoming Qian back home.”

That handsome man was the current premier’s son, Qin Chen.

“That is of course. I haven’t seen Qian for a long time as well.” Qin Chen replied with a smile.

As they spoke, two figures arrived in the hall. When Ouyang Jian saw the girl at the front, his eyes were immediately filled with a loving expression.

“Qian, you’re back.”

When the Blood Moon Elder saw Ouyang Jian who was beaming dotingly, he felt an infarction and could only force himself to reply. “Fa… Father, I’m back.”

“It’s good that you’re back. Why are you back alone? Where are the rest?” Ouyang Jian looked behind the Blood Moon Elder. For this trip to the mystic realm, he specially arranged quite a number of people to accompany his daughter. However, apart from a foreign-looking young man behind her, there was not a single member from the Ouyang family clan.

The Blood Moon Elder glanced at Ye Qingtang from the corner of his eyes. When he saw Ye Qingtang nodding at him discreetly, grief and indignation filled him. He took a deep breath and pinched his thigh hard without leaving a trace!

The extreme pain that took over him forced two drops of tears out of his eyes. Right after that, he looked up at Ouyang Jian with a grieved expression.

“Father… Everyone… Everyone died…”

“What?!” The smile on Ouyang Jian’s face froze instantly.

“That mystic realm was simply a trap. After we entered it, we realized that it was simply not an ordinary mystic realm but a Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka… The danger level of it was simply unimaginable. Many of us died soon after entering the mystic realm. If not… If not for the fact that I met Holy… Young Sir Ye, my life would probably have ended in there…” The Blood Moon Elder wailed as he pinched his thigh, brilliantly putting on the grieved expression.

“There’s actually such a thing?!” Ouyang Jian’s face darkened when he saw his precious daughter crying so pitifully. He immediately stood up and walked to the Blood Moon Elder, patting his back with a doting expression.

“Don’t be afraid, Qian. Now that you’re back home, no one can harm you anymore.”
