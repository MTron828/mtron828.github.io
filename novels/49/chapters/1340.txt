Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang shot him a cold look and said, “If you can’t undertake the Holy Son title, you can step aside and give the chance to a worthier person. Stop embarrassing my Temple of Shadows.”

Ming Wang’s face darkened, but he could not say anything.

…

The person in the golden carriage let out a snicker after hearing Ling Yan.

“Ling Yan, you’ve been known to have a demon-like intelligence. However, no matter how smart you are, it is useless today. Anyone who dares to offend the Ancient You Clan will definitely die…”

As that old voice sounded, a golden ray suddenly shot out from the golden carriage and bolted towards Ling Yan.

Wu Hu was alarmed but realized that Ling Yan remained floating in midair without moving an inch.

But just as the golden light was about to touch Ling Yan, a black aura of death suddenly rushed out and rammed against that golden ray.

A rumble erupted. The force from the collision of the two forces caused freak waves in the flood.

“Definitely die? I doubt so…” Ling Yan’s lips curled into a smile, though his expression remained the same.

Just as Ling Yan finished speaking, an immense aura of death suddenly filled the air.

Numerous dragon roars rang in the sky.

Three enormous Skeletal Dragons approached from Ling Yan’s back. The black aura of death lingered around the Skeletal Dragons, creating endless ripples as they flapped their skeletal wings.

The three Skeletal Dragons led a large Black Bone Carriage over slowly.

In the evening glow, the Black Bone Carriage was like a huge shadow that masked the setting sun.

The Ancient You Clan people froze slightly when they saw the black bone carriage.

The Black Bone Carriage was owned uniquely by the Undead Clan, and only those with prestigious identity in the Undead Clan could sit in such a carriage.

A clear yet eerie sound rang as the bone chime on the Black Bone Carriage swayed in the wind.

“That is… the Temple of Shadows’s carriage?” An Ancient You Clan disciple sharply noticed the unique bone chime.

Only the Temple of Shadows’s Black Bone Carriage had such an item.

It was rumored that an evil spirit was tied to each bone chime, and anyone who heard the sound would have his soul devoured by the sound of that evil spirit if his willpower was not strong enough.

“Why would the Temple of Shadows appear here?”

Everyone from the Ancient You Clan was surprised. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this instant, the three Skeletal Dragons have already arrived before the Ancient You Clan people.

The moment the Skeletal Dragon stopped, three huge mouths suddenly widened and roared to the sky, almost piercing everyone’s eardrums. A thick, black aura of death blasted out from the dragons’ mouths endlessly as though they wanted to devour the sky.

The gray-haired elderly in the Ancient You Clan carriage narrowed his eyes at the Black Bone Carriage.

“Elder…” A young man from the Ancient You Clan looked at the elderly inside the gold carriage instinctively. “Why would the Temple of Shadows suddenly appear here?”

The Elder frowned slightly but did not say anything.

Wu Hu could not help but shudder as he looked at the huge Black Bone Carriage and the three enormous Skeletal Dragons in the air.

“Your Majesty…” He instinctively wanted to ask Ling Yan, but he saw a smile on his face.

Uh…

Could His Majesty have planned this from the start?

In the next second, the door of the golden carriage opened, and an Ancient You Clan Elder slowly stepped out in a long robe.
