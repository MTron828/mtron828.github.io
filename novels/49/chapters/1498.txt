Chapter 1499 Big Demon 5

As the big demon chewed on its food, blood spurted out and soaked its entire surroundings, filling the dried river with blood.

The alliance that was formed just now was immediately destroyed after the big demon rampaged. A few Demon Kings were swallowed by the big demon, and about ten elders from the Ancient You Clan were smashed under its paw.

Both the Jiang Family and the Temple of Shadows suffered great losses. The rest were in even more disastrous states.

Despair filled everyone’s minds at that instant.

Ye Qingtang’s veil was stained red by the blood; Jiang Xun was injured as well since he tried to protect her.

However, even after such a horrifying fight, the big demon was not injured at all. The wound on its body that was a few meters deep did not even penetrate its outer layer of skin. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Those who remained, including the powerful figures that came from the second domain, could not stay calm as they saw the big demon approaching.

Boom!

The big demon crushed the surrounding mountains and rivers. Its head was covered by the clouds, and only pieces of flesh dropped from the clouds as it chewed. The flesh of the other demons smashed onto the ground in front of everyone.

No one expected the situation to develop in such a way; everyone was here to fight for the big demon’s corpse and treasures, but soon, they would be a part of the lump of flesh in its mouth.

However, when everyone was almost engulfed by the feeling of despair, the big demon suddenly stopped.

“What happened?” Jiang Xun’s guard was up as he stared at the big demon.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and planned to figure out what happened...

The giant body that was covered by the clouds suddenly fell down. Its head slammed onto the mountain ridges and flattened them.

No one was prepared for the big demon’s fall. Many were crushed as it collapsed.

The big demon fell down in front of everyone, and its body was like a huge mountain one could not climb over. Now, everyone managed to see its appearance.

“Is it dead?” Someone asked while trembling.

Everyone gazed at the body of the big demon.

The big demon would only head toward the Land of Infinite Demons when it was about to die. This was why everyone rushed over after hearing about the news, but no one expected it to be still conscious and alive.

Yet now...

Was it trying to prank everyone again, or was it really dead?

No one could figure that out.

The Demon Kings who survived by luck had very unpleasant expressions. They stared at the big demon cautiously and used their demonic air to probe the big demon.

No one dared to move at all.

After a long while, the big demon did not move, so someone took the courage and went forward.

He then realized that...

The big demon was really dead.

Everyone sighed in relief after knowing that. Most of them had been to the Land of Infinite Demons countless times, and this was the first time they encountered a living big demon.

If it was alive for a while more, all of them would be dead now.

The situation was getting strange after the big demon died.
