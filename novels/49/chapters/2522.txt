Indeed, just as the Blood Moon Elder said, when considering both the golden book elder and the golden-robed middle-aged man, who was known as the Sky Vault Sect’s Branch Master—their abilities had already reached the Emperor-level.

Not only that, the aura exuded by those two of them was not something an ordinary Emperor stage cultivator could compare to.

It was also Ye Qingtang’s first time seeing the golden-book elder attack. Although Ye Qingtang knew that he was very powerful when they were in the Wailing Well, she did not expect him to be so powerful.

If this golden-book elder was already so powerful, then that meant that resurrected man…

Ye Qingtang did not dare to continue thinking about it as it was too terrifying.

“Holy Lady, how are they compared to those generals in the Deity Ocean realm? Are they still inferior?” The Blood Moon Elder asked.

Ye Qingtang pondered over that.

Actually, a demon general in the Deity Ocean realm was much stronger than them in terms of martial strength. More importantly, demons lived in groups and the difference in strength between them wasn’t that wide, especially between a general and a major demon.

If these people were thrown into the Deity Ocean realm, they would not be able to survive if they became enemies with an entire tribe of demons. However, if they fought one-on-one, the demons might be on the losing end as they did not understand the divine abilities and martial art techniques of the human race. It was hard for Ye Qingtang to be able to judge the outcome accurately.

“Holy Lady, I thought of something… you are able to bring people into and out of the Deity Ocean space freely… How about you throw them all into the Deity Ocean space and let them die!” A sly look flashed across the Blood Moon Elder’s eyes as he murmured his idea to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. She had already thought of this idea. However, given the current situation, how was she going to throw so many people into the Deity Ocean realm in one go? It was simply unrealistic. Moreover, she might not be able to enter the Deity Ocean space. At best she only had a 50-50 percent chance.

At this moment, rumbling sounds could be heard in the distance. The Sky Vault Sect and the golden book elder’s men were fighting.

“What Deity Ocean realm? Why aren’t you running now? What are you waiting for? Are you stupid?” The big yellow dog hurriedly said.

Ye Qingtang immediately ran away with the big yellow dog in her arms, and the Blood Moon Elder close behind.

Ye Qingtang was not afraid of being discovered by the golden book elder and the golden-robed middle-aged man. They were locked in such a fierce battle, so even if they saw them running away, would they be able to stop their fight and chase after her?

…

“Sir, those people ran away,” one of the golden book elder’s men pointed out to him.

The golden book elder looked into the distance and smiled. “There’s no need to be anxious. I’ve already locked onto her aura. She won’t be able to run far.”

…

Ye Qingtang only stopped after fleeing for about a hundred miles. However, she discovered that she still had the two extremely powerful auras on her body.

“No wonder.”

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. They allowed her to leave because they had already infused her body with their auras. No matter how far she ran, they could still catch up to her. These people were really cunning.

“Finally safe…”

The Blood Moon Elder heaved a sigh of relief. He thought that he would have to leave this beautiful world again after being resurrected.

“Little girl.”

The big yellow dog stared at Ye Qingtang thoughtfully.

“What’s wrong?” Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the big yellow dog..Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
