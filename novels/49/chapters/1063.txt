Chapter 1064 Shameless (3)

However, the Beiming Manor elderly could not understand one point no matter how he thought about it: his words were flawless, and there was nothing to pick on, yet why was this lady already prepared for this attack?!

If Ye Qingtang was completely unprepared before and sensed it afterward, it was impossible for her to react so quickly, and she would have definitely been injured.

However, that was not what happened.

“Beiming Manor… One of the three mighty forces of this mainland. I never thought that the Manor has such sly people.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Beiming Manor elderlies, and a cold glint emerged in her eyes.

If she was not already on her guard earlier on, the consequences would be unthinkable. Once she was injured and the two Yang Lords before her joined forces, they would be an extremely huge threat to her!

“Haha… Little girl, you annihilated Yunxiao Sect and injured my Beiming Manor envoy. You already have a death crime. If you join Beiming Manor today, perhaps Beiming Manor can still let bygones be bygones. However, you don’t know what is good for you. Since that’s the case, there’s no need for you to leave here today.” The Beiming Manor elderly sneered, exposing his true nature.

“Even if I joined Beiming Manor, I’m afraid that it does not have room for me either. By then, even if I died, I would most likely die mysteriously.” Ye Qingtang snickered coldly.

“Oh… You even know about this too?” The two Beiming Manor elderlies were startled and were in disbelief.

Given this girl’s age, she could actually analyze all of that…

“Hahahaha, little girl, it seems that you’re not a brainless Yang Lord… With things as such, there’s no harm coming clean with you. Your guesses are indeed right. Currently, the three mighty forces are relatively balanced, and with you, a Yang Lord, this balance will be destroyed no matter which side you join, and the side you join would definitely be jointly annihilated by the other two forces… Neither the Phantom Valley, Peerless School, or our Beiming Manor wish to see such a situation happen. As long as you die, everyone will be happy, right?” The Beiming Manor elderly laughed. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang did not retort and nodded. “What you said makes a lot of sense. However… the condition is that you all need to have the ability to do so.”

“Humph. Little girl, don’t be so selfish. Even if it’s for the balance of the three mighty forces, offering your life is worth it,” a Beiming Manor elderly said.

“It’s a pity that the so-called three mighty forces that you all are talking about are nothing in my eyes,” said Ye Qingtang.

“Haha… interesting. I just thought that your thinking is extremely mature. Now, it seems that that is not the case. After all, you’re too young. Do you really believe that you are unparalleled now that you are a Yang Lord?!” The Beiming Manor elderly scoffed.

Each of the three mighty forces of this mainland had four Yang Lords. With a total of twelve Yang Lords, what could Ye Qingtang, a mere itinerant cultivator, amount to?!

“I don’t dare to believe that I am unparalleled, but I should be skilled enough to deal with you two.” Ye Qingtang had an indifferent expression.

After hearing what Ye Qingtang had said, the Beiming Manor elderly was infuriated. “With death at hand, how dare you make such bold claims!”

Then, the Beiming Manor elderly shot a look to the other elderly.

That elderly then retrieved a scarlet ancient mirror from his space ring.

As the scarlet ancient mirror appeared, a surge of olden air flooded out.
