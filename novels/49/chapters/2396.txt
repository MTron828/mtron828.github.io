Chapter 2397: Slow And Steady (3)

As Song Yanhan looked at the quiet Mu Ziying, he was surprised. He had never imagined that this withdrawn little girl was actually a puppet master…

Mu Ziying had made use of her spare time in the Evil Soul Forest to create this puppet. The materials used were all from the Evil Soul Forest.

Light as a feather, her fingers danced and the immobile puppet suddenly moved.

As if suddenly filled with life, the puppet suddenly got up and snuck toward those demons outside the cave.

Puppet masters were very rare. This was the first time Song Yanhan witnessed a puppet master controlling a puppet. And he discovered that Mu Ziying was not even using any strings at all. Nevertheless, that puppet moved very naturally. From afar, it looked just like any living human.

Mu Ziying had the puppet approach the demons outside the cave. Those demons seemed to be oblivious to that lifeless puppet’s presence.

As the puppet approached one of the smaller demons, the demon suddenly attacked. It opened its jaws and countless hands shot out of its mouth.

In the blink of an eye, Mu Ziying’s puppet was shredded to bits.

Mu Ziying, “…”

“Let’s go.” Ye Qingtang commanded them to retreat the moment she saw what happened to the puppet.

Song Yanhan, who had already prepared to do battle, was shocked.

Go?

They were leaving just like that?

After quietly putting more distance between them and that cave, Ye Qingtang finally spoke.

“Jing-er’s puppet has at least 70% of her powers. But it could not even withstand a single attack by the smallest demon…”

The puppet had been crafted with materials from the Evil Soul Forest. Ye Qingtang had specially tested that puppet before and knew that it could easily withstand attacks from someone who was a Divine Lord First Heaven level.

It was clear that those demons were above that of a Divine Lord First Heaven level.

Everyone in the team heard Ye Qing’s explanation.

There were at least seven to eight of those lion-shaped demons outside that cave, and Mu Ziying had chosen one of the smallest ones.

Despite this, its battle prowess was already so formidable. If they had charged forward, they would have been torn to shreds within seconds.

“Boss, what kind of demons were they? Why did they have those things inside their mouths…” Nangong Lie shuddered when he recalled those hands inside that demon’s jaws.

“I don’t know.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

The team, who had been full of aggression and energy, all prepared to sweep the entire Wailing Well clean of demons, was now muted after meeting their first demons.

Just a random demon and it was already beyond the Divine Lord stage. How were they going to hunt and kill any?

Unless they could find some solitary demons. They had no hope at all when faced with a group of them. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Just as they were feeling very depressed, sounds of fighting echoed from nearby.

The sounds drew closer and closer. Lei Yan and the others turned to see a massive black figure charging straight toward them.

A harsh light flashed

That massive figure was instantly destroyed.

It was a demon which looked like a giant ape. But its fur was made up of millions of worms, which wriggled non-stop.

“Urgh.” Lei Yan nearly puked at the sight of those worms.

What kind of place was this?!

“Who’s there?” A stern voice rang out.

A familiar figure appeared before Ye Qingtang’s team.
