Chapter 2446: I’ll Bring You to Search for it

Ye Qingtang was all ready to die at that moment. There was no way she could defeat or outrun the above-Emperor level monsters in front of her.

“Roar”!

The above-Emperor level monster bellowed furiously, as though they were trying to split the sky.

“I already told you, your mouth stinks. Please shut it,” the big yellow dog said to the above-Emperor level monster.

But this dire situation only made Ye Qingtang even calmer.

If only… I could enter the space from before again…

As long as she could use the mysterious Deity Ocean, she would be able to enter the other space. After she had obtained the Deity Ocean all those years ago, she had tried to connect with it many times but to no avail.

Let’s give it a go.

Forcing herself to calm down, she tried connecting to the Deity Ocean.

Even after two breathing exercises, she frowned as she still couldn’t connect with it. Although she could touch it, it seemed to have no intention of connecting with her. It was tightly shut like a stone door with no intention of opening.

“You’re all animals. I’ll save you some face and let you go. If you want to cause trouble, go and do it to that woman and don’t bother me, alright?” the big yellow dog said as it noticed the above-Emperor level monsters fixing their gazes on it.

But just as those words came out of its mouth, the above-Emperor level monster was thoroughly angered. With a loud slam, the ground shook and the big yellow dog was trampled under its feet.

Ye Qingtang took a few steps back instinctively.

The big yellow dog… really was unafraid for its life. It was still provoking the above-Emperor level monster with its words. That stomp alone was enough to kill her, let alone the big yellow dog.

But she was stunned by what happened after that. The big yellow dog which had been trampled by the above-Emperor level monster quickly sprang back up happily after the monster removed its foot.

“Damn… this must be a lie…” She looked at the big yellow dog wagging its tail at her in shock. Was she dreaming? Not only was it not dead, but not a single hair on its body had also been harmed.

“Ouch… that hurt… this animal… looks like it’s not going easy on me at all… how dare it step on me. It deserves a thousand blows…” the big yellow dog muttered.

She was more and more surprised as she looked at the big yellow dog. Could it be hiding something?

“I’m angry… I’m really angry… you’ve made me really angry. You’re a goner!” the big yellow dog shouted angrily at the above-Emperor level monster.

“Did you see that? It’s not going easy on me at all. How dare it step on me,” the big yellow dog said to Ye Qingtang.

She was speechless. That much was obvious.

“I saw. Finish it.”

“I’m nothing but your child if I don’t get rid of it today,” the big yellow dog continued to mutter.

Ye Qingtang smiled. There was no way she would be able to give birth to a dog.

With that, the big yellow dog’s eye gleamed red.

The above-Emperor level monster was hit by a red light and under Ye Qingtang’s disbelieving gaze, it dissolved into ashes which floated away, as though it had been incinerated by intense heat.

“My god…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog in a brand new light.

The above-Emperor level monster… had been killed in one hit by this big yellow dog!Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
