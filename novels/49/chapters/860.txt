Chapter 861 Are You Alright

“Senior Sister, thank you for saving us!”

“Please break the Shun Tian Formation and rescue us, Senior Sister!”

However, before Ye Qingtang came close to the Shun Tian Formation, one of the ladies hurriedly shouted to Ye Qingtang. “Senior Sister, careful!”

The moment she spoke, a shattering sound rang from behind.

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang leaped away and retreated over ten steps.

Boom!

A rumble exploded along with a slash in the air.

Ye Qingtang turned around and sized up the front calmly.

Ahead was a completely-decomposed warhorse that had purple flames lingering around its entire body. A corpse in black armor was on the back of the horse.

“Prehistoric human…” Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed.

The supposed prehistoric human referred only to the prehistory of this mainland.

It was said that before this mainland was formed, countless humans lost their lives in the battle between the True Dragon and Divine Phoenix.

Afterward, the True Dragon and Divine Phoenix died, and the Dragon Vein was formed. As a result, those prehistoric humans were also buried in the Dragon Vein.

The prehistoric human before them had been dead for many years, but it seemed to condense to a strange soul due to the Wintry Aura in the Dragon Vein, and it became a killing machine.

The flaming warhorse neighed, wanting to sweep everything away, while the corpse in a black armor roared and shot daggers with his eyes. It was as though they could take away people’s souls.

Swoosh!

In the next second, the corpse rode towards Ye Qingtang, and the long knife in his hands was stabbed towards her.

Fast. This strike was so fast that one could barely see it with the naked eye.

Even an Arcane Supremacy may not be able to block the attack of a prehistoric human, much less Ye Qingtang, who was only at Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven currently.

However, at the same time, a shadow flashed by and landed beside Ye Qingtang.

Puff! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The long knife pierced through the shadow.

Surprised, Ye Qingtang looked at the man in white who suddenly appeared beside her.

The man was wearing a mask, and there was a trace of blood on his hair.

At that instant, the man’s blood splattered on the corpse’s body.

The corpse cried immediately, and the man’s blood started burning, forcing the corpse to retreat.

Before long, the warhorse and the corpse in a black armor dashed away and disappeared without a trace in no time.

“Are you alright…”

The man turned around and looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Ling Yan…”

Ye Qingtang was surprised.

In her previous life, she once heard that Ling Yan’s blood could intimidate the evil. Apart from Ling Yan, who else could this masked man be?

“I should be the one asking you that… Are you alright?” Ye Qingtang looked at the pierced wound on Ling Yan’s left shoulder and asked with a frown.

“I’m alright… You should be more careful. This Dragon Vein does not seem to be as simple as what we see.” Ling Yan leaned to Ye Qingtang’s ear and said softly.

Subsequently, Ling Yan turned around and left this place without looking back.

“That person is?”

The three Arcane Supremacies in the Shun Tian Formation appeared to be a little confused.

The magical effect of Ling Yan’s blood was only circulated many years later. Currently, apart from a few certain people, most of the powerful figures had not heard of it before, and as a result, it was all the more impossible for the students of the Supreme Academy to know about it.

As Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan’s leaving back view, there was an inexplicable feeling in her heart; that Ling Yan suddenly appeared and took a blow for her…
