Chapter 1061 Traitor (4)

Elder Qu was taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words. He did not understand her meaning but involuntarily glanced at her brow.

The next moment, a thin blood-colored crescent moon surfaced on Ye Qingtang’s brow. The singular Blood Moon aura filled the entire area. The Blood Moon aura, which was unique to the Blood Moon Holy Lady, gradually surfaced.

Elder Qu was stunned for a few seconds when he saw the blood-colored crescent moon on Ye Qingtang’s brow. When he snapped out of his trance, his lips moved a little, but he remained rooted to the spot.

A thousand years ago, Elder Qu had been a Blood Moon Sect Elder. He certainly recognized the mark of the Holy Lady of the Blood Moon Sect…

The girl standing before him had such a powerful Blood Moon aura…

“H-h-holy Lady… impossible… that’s impossible!” Elder Qu could not believe it.

Elder Qu was ashen. The Yang Lord standing before him was the most mysterious Holy Lady of the Blood Moon Sect… even more mysterious than the two Blood Moon Guardians, who had never been seen before… Also, the status of Blood Moon Holy Lady was even higher than that of the Blood Moon Sect Master, almost equal to that of the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

When the Ye Family Branch Masters, Daoist Zijin, and the others saw the Blood Moon mark on Ye Qingtang’s brow, they were also stunned.

However, when they learned from Elder Qu that their Eldest Young Lady was actually the Blood Moon Sect Holy Lady, they were completely shocked. They stared at Ye Qingtang and almost forgot to breathe.

“Holy… Holy Lady, please have mercy. Great Holy Lady, please have mercy!”

With a thump, Elder Qu’s body slumped, and he kneeled by Ye Qingtang’s feet.

“Elder Qu, a thousand years ago, you betrayed the Blood Moon Sect. You collaborated with outsiders to kill numerous members of the Blood Moon Sect. Now, I am going to show you grace and be merciful.” Ye Qingtang fixed her gaze on Elder Qu and blandly spoke.

Actually, Ye Qingtang did not really identify with her status as Blood Moon Holy Lady. However, the Blood Moon Holy Lord was her sworn brother and was loyal to her. Now that she had run into a traitor of the Blood Moon Sect, she naturally needed to put the sect’s affairs in order.

Besides this connection, Elder Qu and the others in the Yunxiao Sect had also harmed many of the younger talented martial arts cultivators.

Of course, it was none of Ye Qingtang’s business as to who Elder Qu and the Yunxiao Sect had harmed, but the Xuanling Sect had almost been exterminated by the YunXiao Sect, and this was closely related to Elder Qu. No matter what, Ye Qingtang would not allow him to leave.

“Kill him.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin.

“Huh… what?!”

Daoist Zijin was taken aback. When he recovered his wits, he still looked rather shocked. “Eldest Young Holy Lady… kill?”

“Kill…”

Repeated Ye Qingtang.

“Hmph, I hate traitors the most. You Blood Moon Sect traitor, you betrayed the Blood Moon Sect and betrayed the Blood Moon Holy Lady. Your crimes are unforgivable!” One of the Ye Family Branch Masters stared at Elder Qu and shouted angrily.

The next moment, Daoist Zijin, Bai Kui, and a few Ye Family Branch Masters advanced together and simultaneously struck a killing blow.

Although Elder Qu had been a Yang Lord a thousand years ago, his current martial skills were merely around Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven. He could not possibly compare with Bai Kui, Daoist Zijin, and others. Within the span of ten breaths, the Ye Family members had acted together to kill him.

After Elder Qu was killed, the group from the Ye Family stared at the blood-colored mark on Ye Qingtang’s brow. They were all shaken.

Besides being a Yang Lord… their Ye Family’s Eldest Young Lady… was actually the Blood Moon Sect Holy Lady!

No wonder… no wonder she had become a Yang Lord at such a young age. No wonder she dared to challenge the Beiming Manor without fear…
