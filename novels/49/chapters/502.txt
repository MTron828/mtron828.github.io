Chapter 503 Stirring Things Up (4)

“Jiwu… Jiwu!!” The Yunxiao Sect elder looked at his most doted disciple and screamed at the sky.

On the other hand, Ye Qingtang sneered coldly as she succeeded with one attack.

In her previous life, Li Jiwu was Ye You’s dog and committed countless atrocities. Slaying him one-shot was really letting him off lightly. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The Yunxiao Sect elder stood up swiftly and lifted his right arm to suck the black sword that pierced through Li

Jiwu’s heart into his palm.

“Everlasting Hatred Sword?!” Yunxiao Sect elder was slightly taken aback after inspecting the sword in his hand.

He naturally recognized the Everlasting Hatred Sword; it belonged to Yunxiao Sect Sect Master’s small disciple,

Yue Tiancheng.

“Yue Tiancheng?!” The Yunxiao Sect elder’s face darkened. The Concealed Breath Curse previously clearly had the appearance of an Array Formation in a talisman, and the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master bestowed Yue

Tiancheng with many array formations in talismans, including the Concealed Breath Curse, when he headed

out the other time.

However, the Yunxiao Sect elder could not think of a reason as to why Yue Tiancheng would suddenly attack Li

Jiwu.

Although Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciples were not really on good terms and it was not rare for disciples to assassinate those whom they had overly-deep conflicts with, how audacious was it for Yue Tiancheng to kill his favorite disciple with the Array Formation in a talisman in front of him?!

The Yunxiao Sect elder disappeared from the spot immediately and turned into an aurora as he flew forward.

Sensing that the Yunxiao Sect elder’s aura was closing in, the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s expression changed subtly, and he looked at Ye Qingtang. “This is not good… Let’s flee quickly!”

However, Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground.

No matter how fast they were, it was impossible for them to be faster than the Yunxiao Sect Elder, and fleeing was simply useless.

Swoosh!

As the Blood Moon Elder spoke, the Yunxiao Sect Elder had already appeared in front of them.

The Yunxiao Sect Elder sized up Ye Qingtang and the

Blood Moon Sect Elder condescendingly.

Earlier, he suspected that it was probably not Yue Tiancheng, and looking at the people right now, his suspicion was indeed right.

“Who are you all! How dare you assassinate my disciple!

Why do you all have Yue Tiancheng’s Everlasting Hatred Sword and Array Formation in a talisman?!”

An infuriated bellow escaped the Yunxiao Sect Elder’s

mouth.

Immediately, a horrifying martial aura transformed into a typhoon, enshrouding Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon

Elder instantly.

At that instant, the two people in the martial aura were like lone boats in the vast ocean.

Facing the Yunxiao Sect Elder who was at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, Ye Qingtang was not the slightest bit fearful as she scoffed. “Yue Tiancheng?

He is already a soul under my sword. The Everlasting

Hatred Sword and Array Formation in a talisman are naturally my spoils of the battle.”

“You killed Yue Tiancheng?!” The Yunxiao Sect Elder found it hard to believe.

Yue Tiancheng was a Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciple and was the Sect Master’s disciple. How would he be killed by someone at Martial Qi Level Two?

“You don’t believe me?” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up as she took out a space ring. “Do you recognize this?”

“Yue Tiancheng’s space ring?” The Yunxiao Sect Elder’s eyes flickered.

Some time ago, Yue Tiancheng was sent to follow and assassinate Ji Yixuan from Falling Sky Valley, and, thus, the Sect Master bestowed him with numerous array formations in talismans. From then on, there was no more news of Yue Tiancheng…

He never thought that Yue Tiancheng was already killed while his Everlasting Hatred Sword and the Array

Formation in talismans given by the Sect Master actually had a new owner!

“You have a death wish!” The Yunxiao Sect Elder roared in

fury.

A mere Martial Qi Level Two girl killed the Sect Master’s small disciple and infiltrated into this mountain to kill his disciple, Li Jiwu, using the Array Formation in a talisman!
