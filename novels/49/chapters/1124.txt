Chapter 1125 Demonic Creature 3

“Don’t worry... Just do as I say. There’s me,” Ling Yan said softly.

Before waiting for Ye Qingtang to speak, a bolt of power of Karma rushed from the voice transmission stone to the sky.

Ye Qingtang looked in the direction of the scarlet power of Karma and saw that it had turned into a huge Buddha, and it was in a battle with the demonic creature.

“What is that...”

The Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed as he looked at that Buddha with limitless might.

“Realistic Illusion?!” Ye Qingtang looked at that huge Buddha statue and mumbled.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang once knew about an illusory spell called Realistic Illusion.

The energy of the Realistic Illusion swung between reality and illusory. It could confuse one’s mind and was extremely difficult to differentiate.

She just witnessed the power of karma explode from the voice transmission stone and turn into a Buddha statue. That should be the Realistic Illusion as the Buddha statue did not really exist and was merely transformed by illusory energy as Ye Qingtang had understood.

“Leave quickly.”

Ling Yan’s voice suddenly rang.

Without hesitation, Ye Qingtang immediately brought the Blood Moon Elder and little white tiger and fled rapidly.

On the other side, the human-looking demonic creature was blocked by the illusory Buddha statue and was fighting it without revealing any weak points.

Ye Qingtang knew a little about Ling Yan’s skills. He seemed to be able to divert his remarkable skill using his Karmic Bloodline from millions of miles away.

They had Ling Yan to thank today. Otherwise, with Ye Qingtang and the little white tiger, it would be very difficult to fight against the human-looking demonic creature.

“Ling Yan, you can tell what’s happening here?” The little white tiger could not hold back and asked.

“That’s right.” Ling Yan’s voice could be heard a long while later.

“No wonder...” The little white tiger was in thought.

“Miss Ye, that demonic creature is one of the elders of You Ancient Clan and is called Yin Fo. It is limited in my illusory spell right now. You can head to the city where Elder Yin Fo was at and take it down,” Ling Yan said. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ling Yan’s words verified Ye Qingtang’s guesses.

Estimating the time that Elder Yin Fo took to rush over for assistance, the city he was in was probably the city nearest to Sky Stars City, Wind Cloud City.

After the You Ancient Clan invaded the north, it conquered ten cities, and each city was not too far away from each other.

A while later, Ye Qingtang descended from the sky with Blood Moon Elder and the little white tiger and arrived outside Wind Cloud City.

“Be careful, Holy Lady. How about we investigate first and verify that this is the city conquered by that Elder Yin Fo? Otherwise, if it’s not and this city has another demonic creature guarding it, we will still die without a doubt...” The Blood Moon Elder flashed an obsequious smile.

Looking at the Blood Moon Elder’s toady smile, Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and said, “You’re right. You’ll go to investigate first then.”

“Huh... I’ll go?” The smile on the Blood Moon Elder’s face shattered completely. He pointed at himself with eyes popped wide and was completely dumbfounded. How he wished he could slap his mouth!

Why did he blab for nothing!!

At the same time, in Sky Stars City.

The human-looking demonic creature let out a low roar and immediately charged towards the huge Buddha statue in front.
