Chapter 626: As A Chess Piece

“If my guess is right, you actually have the bloodline powers of ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals in your body… Otherwise, your body would definitely be unable to contain that heart,” the little white tiger said with certainty.

“My heart is the Heart of the Demon God.” Ye Qingtang was helpless.

This little white tiger had a habit of lying with its eyes wide open.

“Heart of the Demon God?” the little white tiger said with a serious expression. “Demon God, Human Emperor, Fiend Honor. Although they are powerful figures at the emperor-level and have already reached an extremely high position to you humans, even the legendary gods might not be able to control the heart in your body. Hence, you said that that is the Heart of the Demon God?”

The little white tiger sighed. “I’ve heard about the Demon God for this generation. Although he is powerful… truth to be told, this heart may not belong to him. Even if he was the Demon God for this generation, he might not be able to control this heart… I think that it seems to belong to you.”

When the little white tiger spoke to the end, a trace of seriousness flashed across its eyes. It was as though it knew something but kept mum about it. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At that instant, Ye Qingtang’s brows were tightly furrowed. Looking at the little white tiger, it definitely did not seem that it was lying to her.

But if the little white tiger were speaking the truth… then what exactly was this Heart of the Demon God…

The Heart of the Demon God did not belong to the Demon God… but herself?

According to the little white tiger, to control this heart perfectly, one’s body required the bloodline of ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals… So what relation did she and the disappeared Fourth Domain have…

Presently, Ye Qingtang already knew that her birth parents were not from the Ye family…

The little white tiger said that her body possessed the bloodline powers of ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals. Speaking in another way, wouldn’t she be a descendant of the Fourth Domain?

However… she had never been to the Fourth Domain and did not understand a thing about it.

For a moment, Ye Qingtang’s heart could not help but shake.

It seemed that she had fallen into a huge scheme right from the start…

A pair of invisible hands were slowly controlling from the back while she was actually like an insignificant chess piece on the chessboard…

Why would her body have the bloodline power of the Fourth Domain, and how did she arrive in the Ye family…

“Mhm… Actually… I only heard about it from hearsay… All of this was told to me by my father and mother.” The little white tiger added.

“Your father and mother?” Ye Qingtang said and looked at the little white tiger. “So where are they?”

Currently, Ye Qingtang desperately wanted to know exactly what happened. What was the Heart of the Demon God about also…

However, the moment Ye Qingtang mentioned the little white tiger’s parents, a hint of blurriness emerged in its round eyes. “My parents…”

“What happened?” Ye Qingtang asked softly.

“Nothing…” The little white tiger licked its paws with its tiny pink tongue and subsequently rubbed its eyes.

Looking at the little white tiger, Ye Qingtang knew that this Fiendcelestial Beast also had its own story and past, and its parents seemed to be a hurtful memory for the little white tiger. Since it was unwilling to say, it was not right for Ye Qingtang to continue asking.

“Good… Since you are my spirit pet already, I’ll definitely not let anyone bully you in the future…” Ye Qingtang could not help but hug the little white tiger tightly.

Although this white tiger’s brain was not bright and assumed that anyone it saw wanted to kill it, as ridiculous as it sounded, thinking of it carefully…

It was away from its parents since it was an infant and had wandered outside. If it did not suffer endless humiliation and torture, how would it become like this…

As a Fiendcelestial Beast, it would command reverence from everyone if it grew up.

But if it did not grow and was only at its infant-form, it was only a magic elixir which had a taste that would linger in memory.
