Chapter 1581 Two Star Constellation 3

As the carriage and the knights crossed the streets, the surrounding people with different hair and eye colors all humbly stood aside.“It’s the Bishop of York!”

“Bishop of York, please protect our troops!”

Various prayers emerged from the crowd. The respectful and devout expressions on the peoples’ faces did not vanish even after the carriage and knights had gone.

Ye Qingtang did not know how to feel when she saw this strange scene.

These people were clearly humans, but they were completely foreign. Their hair color was like that of an alien race, and all of them, whether male or female, had deep-set features and snow-white skin.

Even their attire was completely different from the clothes that Ye Qingtang was familiar with. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Here, the women mostly wore tight-waisted dresses with long, loose skirts. The men all wore close-fitting clothes similar to the leather armor of martial arts outfits.

Ye Qingtang quietly watched the scene before her as she thought about whether she should find a place to familiarize herself with her environment. She quickly found the place with the densest crowd.

A place filled with the fumes of alcohol.

Ye Qingtang thought that this must be a restaurant, so she stepped in. She realized that her appearance in the dim firelight had attracted the attention of many pedestrians. When this strange world’s large-sized people saw a petite young girl with jet-black hair and shining black eyes, they looked horrified.

Ye Qingtang entered the establishment that looked like a restaurant and sat down in a corner. After she entered, she realized that this place was not what she had expected.

A few bearded, burly men had rolled up their sleeves, showing their well-muscled biceps. They clutched huge mugs and were banging them together. She could vaguely see some white substance that looked like foam continually flowing from the mugs.

A woman with an enchanting figure flicked her long, curly hair. She was dressed revealingly, and she giggled as she circulated among the men, who also embraced her. Her little hands teased their hairy chests.

“...” Ye Qingtang felt that this was a very strange place.

“Does this adorable young lady want anything? We have intoxicating wine and delicious beef here.” The woman who was dressed so revealingly plopped herself down at Ye Qingtang’s table. Her reddish-brown hair was long and hung to her shoulders in waves, and her dark green eyes smiled provocatively.

Because Ye Qingtang was sitting in the corner, the darkness veiled her hair and eye color so that others could not see her clearly.

Adorable... young lady?

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little.

“Please, a portion of meat will do.” Ye Qingtang spoke slowly in a warm and polite tone.

“Um?” The red-haired girl frowned slightly.

Please?

Will do?

What does that mean?

But she understood ‘a portion of meat’, so she smilingly noted it down and went to prepare it. When she brushed past her companions, she remembered to smile teasingly and say, “Hey, did you see that? That poor little lamb has ended up here. Pray that she won’t be devoured by the wild beasts here.”

Fred’s bar was a paradise for men.

Ye Qingtang was seated in darkness and could hear the shouts from the surrounding people. With her keen sense of hearing, she could clearly hear the voice of every person present. She needed to extract information about this world from their conversations.
