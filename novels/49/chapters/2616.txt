Chapter 2617: The Power Of A God (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

At this moment, more and more powerful practitioners from the various family clans gathered around. They seemed to have sensed the aura of a supreme expert, so they especially rushed over to take a look.

“Oh my god… Heavenly Emperor… also, that man is… Han Cangming, who is on par with the Heavenly Emperor and is about to become the Third Emperor?!”

“It really is the Heavenly Emperor. I never expected to see the Heavenly Emperor in my life… I really never expected this.”

“Is that the legendary Heavenly Emperor? He swept through the nine heavens and 18 earths with his divine aura. He once charged into the Fourth Domain alone and escaped unscathed. After that, he single-handedly destroyed the Heaven Supporting Divine Pillar. He’s known as… the unrivaled Heavenly Emperor!”

As more and more powerful practitioners rushed over, the discussion became louder and louder.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the two elite-level figures again. Before Ye Qingtang could take a closer look, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline in her body stirred. Her heart turned cold when she sensed the desire of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

This Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline must be crazy. After sensing how powerful the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming were, it actually wanted to devour them…

“I don’t want to die yet. Don’t create trouble for me…” Ye Qingtang thought to herself.

Neither the current Heavenly Emperor nor Han Cangming knew about her. If those two people sensed the power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline in her body, there was a high chance that she would die.

Ye Qingtang immediately calmed her emotions and hurriedly reigned in the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. After a few breaths, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline’s desire gradually disappeared.

The two supreme practitioners stood quietly in the air. No one below dared to take even half a step forward, all they wanted was to spectate. If they took the risk and approached those two, they might be burned to ashes. Just the aura of those two was enough to destroy all living things within a radius of several hundred miles. This was already the power of a god. Mortals could only look up from afar.

After a while, Han Cangming’s gaze landed on the Heavenly Emperor again. His lips curled into a faint smile as he said softly, “Heavenly Emperor, you’ve been chasing me for half a year. Aren’t you tired?” As Han Cangming finished speaking, the expressions of the surrounding warriors changed.

Were these two supreme beings going to fight here?!

“Move further away!”

A martial arts practitioner shouted and the surrounding crowd retreated. If the two supreme beings started fighting, there would still be some buffer between the battle and the spectators.

Soon, the Heavenly Emperor raised his cold eyes and sized up Han Cangming. After a long while, he said indifferently, “Continue.”

“Continue what?” Han Cangming smiled.

“Running,” the Heavenly Emperor replied.

“Heavenly Emperor, that thing is so important to you,” Han Cangming smiled gently.

In the next second, the Heavenly Emperor raised his arm slightly and stared at Han Cangming. He said coldly, ‘Give it to me.”

“Heh, Heavenly Emperor, that won’t do. You want to ascend to the heavens and I am your final tribulation.’ As he spoke, Han Cangming took out a dazzling jade stone that was suffused with a white luster and fiddled with it casually.

“Oh… you want to stop me from ascending to the heavens.” The Heavenly Emperor’s eyes flickered coldly.

“Heavenly Emperor, if you ascend to the heavens, who in this world can accompany me? It would be so boring without you. So what do you think?” Han Cangming smiled..Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates
