Chapter 1137: Possession (1)

If a split self wanted to become the true original self, the only option was to personally destroy the original self. Otherwise, it would remain as a split self forever.

“Humph. There’ll be one day where I take revenge for today and kill him!” The Blood Moon Elder scoffed as his eyes twinkled continuously.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly after hearing the Blood Moon Elder.

The elderly’s martial skills were immeasurable, and even in her peak in her previous life, she might not be able to defeat that elderly.

“Allow me to remind you that your original self is very likely… a Holy Venerate,” Ye Qingtang said candidly.

“Holy Venerate?!” The Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed instantly, but it only lasted for a moment as he returned to his previous fierce expression. “Humph. So what if he is a Holy Venerate?! As long as I can kill him personally, all of his will be mine, and I will become a Holy Venerate as well…”

Then, the Blood Moon Elder suddenly changed the direction of his discourse and said, “However, thinking about it carefully, I exist because of him… Forget it. I will be compassionate and spare his life.”

Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the Blood Moon Elder. “…” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

When has this Blood Moon Elder ever been compassionate?

Now that he had changed his stance, it was probably because he learned of that elderly’s Holy Venerate cultivation base… and was frightened…

Ye Qingtang was already used to the Blood Moon Elder’s “flexibility” according to the situation and merely cast him a look plainly without saying anything.

She directly led the Blood Moon Elder to the demonic creature’s side and pushed him towards it.

“Don’t say anymore bullsh*t. Quickly possess it.”

This opportunity was rare. Han Cangming and Blood Moon Holy Lord seemed to have a feud, and no one knew where they had battled to.

Blood Moon Elder looked at the demonic creature on the ground with a complicated expression. However, he abandoned his last “principle” and immediately moved forward to use his mental energy to invade the demonic creature’s body.

Who cares if it was human or not! If he still did not work hard to become more powerful, he would be killed by that old original self!

However big the world was, his life was the most important thing!

Blood Moon Elder had thought it through, but after a long while later, he panted heavily and was sweating profusely. He looked at Ye Qingtang dejectedly and said, “Holy Lady… I can’t do it. This demonic creature’s mental energy is too strong… Given my current level, it’s simply impossible to break through his mental defense…”

What the hell is this!

He had already given up his rights to become human, but there was still such an obstacle!

Ye Qingtang nodded. This was reasonable.

It was easy for a high-level powerful figure to possess a low-level cultivator, but if a low-level cultivator wanted to possess the body of a high-level figure, it was almost impossible.

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang raised her right arm, and a pitch-black flame floated in her palm.

Before Blood Moon Elder’s eyes, Ye Qingtang waved her hand gently and threw that destructive flame onto the demonic creature.

At the same time, the demonic creature shrieked in pain as though it was a cry from the depth of his soul.

The demonic creature was heavily injured and had lost all combat ability; thus, it had no way of blocking Ye Qingtang’s black flame.

Ye Qingtang immediately looked at Blood Moon Elder and said, “Continue.”

“Alright.” Blood Moon Elder nodded and then used the power of his spirit to invade into the demonic creature’s body.
