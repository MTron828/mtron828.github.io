Chapter 2287: Where Did The Energy Go? (2)

So many dead souls. The demon pearl would definitely have absorbed a lot of energy, but…

The old man’s face instantly turned grim. According to their plan, the demon pearl should have already absorbed enough energy. That was why they had closed the main doors of the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

But…

The old man could not understand. He took out his communication token.

“My lord…” The old man said respectfully.

“Have you retrieved the demon pearl from the Evil Soul Forest?” A deep voice rang out from the communication token.

“I have… already retrieved it.”

“Bring it back now.”

The old man’s face stiffened. Hesitating a little, he finally said, “I have retrieved the demon pearl but… there is a small problem.”

“Speak.”

The old man continued. “There is not enough energy inside the demon pearl. I can sense that it is still at least 70-80% away from the amount of energy required by my lord…”

“What?” The voice from the communication token was instantly filled with anger.

Cold sweat appeared on the back of the old man as he said hurriedly, “I don’t know what happened either. Enough people have entered the fiendcelestial’s tomb and the demon pearl should have already absorbed enough energy. But… I don’t know what happened… my lord, should we arrange to open the main door to the fiendcelestial’s tomb again? And have another batch of people enter?”

The old man continued after a short pause. “There is a limit to how much energy the demon pearl can absorb at one time. My lord, you already planned to open the tomb regularly and entice the various factions to enter until we absorbed all the energy we needed. I think… it shouldn’t be too big of an issue for us to extend this round?”

“Imbecile. How long do you think we can use this tomb for?”

The old man was slightly taken aback. Before he could reply, the voice spoke out again.

“Never mind. Arrange for some men to open the main doors. We will give it another month, by then, no matter how much energy the demon pearl has absorbed, you must bring it back.”

The old man did not understand why his lord was so anxious. But knowing his lord’s temper, he naturally did not dare to ask.

The old man returned the demon pearl into the tomb and left.

But…

He just could not understand why the demon pearl failed to absorb enough energy?

Where did all that energy go?

Could it be that the demon pearl was damaged?!

The puzzled old man had no idea that the demon pearl was not damaged at all. It had already absorbed enough energy, but…

Someone had stumbled into the secret room by mistake and discovered the secret behind the array formation. That someone had then brought along her students and absorbed all the energy. And they themselves had no idea what they did…

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang had led her group out of the Evil Soul Forest and finally arrived at a city after several days of journeying. They were at the halfway mark from the academy.

Having lived in the wilderness for several months, those teenagers suddenly felt somewhat unused to the bustling city. But after they settled down in an inn, they couldn’t resist sighing in relief.

They finally had a bed to sleep in!

They no longer had to chew on those dry rations…

They no longer had to soak in that bloodbath, but could take a nice long shower!! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Showered, well-fed and lying on a clean bed, the teenagers were nearly crying in happiness.

It had been so long before they enjoyed such comforts…

This was pure bliss!
