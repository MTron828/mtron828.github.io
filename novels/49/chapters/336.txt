Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes as she sensed the panic from Fei Ying and Ni Shang.

Fei Ying and Ni Shang were really terrified. It was easy for inner sect disciples to punish them. There were even rumors about sword boys and servants being beaten to death just because they disrespected the inner sect disciples.

Fei Ying and Ni Shang stared at the disciples who were going to surround them. They felt the coldness spreading in their body as the disciples stretched their hands out.

However, the moment when they were terrified, an arm blocked the incoming hands.

Ye Qingtang stood right in front of them and stopped the action of the disciples. She then turned and looked at Song Junqiu.

“Song Junqiu, though I just entered the sect, the warden of the inner sect had told me some of the rules here. If my servant made any mistake, I would be the one to punish them. Now, you want to bypass me to punish my people, isn’t that considered disobeying the rules?” Ye Qingtang said rightfully. She did not intend to compromise at all.

He needed to ask for her permission before touching her people!

Fei Ying and Ni Shang were surprised as they saw Ye Qingtang standing in front of them.

Song Junqiu’s face darkened as he did not expect Ye Qingtang to know such a rule.

He then smiled suddenly.

“It seems like you know quite a lot here…” He waved his hand, and the few disciples stepped back.

Song Junqiu then noticed the box with the Soul Condensation Pills inside. A streak of evilness sparkled through his eyes. He suddenly took out one bottle of the Soul Condensation Pills and stared at the bottle with interest.

“Junior Sister Ye, the inner sect is totally different from the outer sect, right? I think the Soul Condensation Pills are rare in the outer sect.” Song Junqiu raised his eyes to look at Ye Qingtang. The moment he finished his words, he lifted his hand casually, but his elbow knocked the box with the Soul Condensation Pills inside.

The whole box of Soul Condensation Pills dropped onto the ground as his elbows swung pass through. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The cracking sound was heard instantly as the elixirs rolled to the ground.

Song Junqiu showed an evil smile, and he pretended to be shocked. “I’m so sorry. I was careless. What are you waiting for? Help Junior Sister Ye to pick up the Soul Condensation Pills.”

The few disciples certainly understood his intention. They seemed to be very helpful and went forward, but the Soul Condensation Pills on the floor were crushed to powder as they stepped around.

“I apologize again, Junior Sister Ye. Only these few are left.” Song Junqiu nodded in contentment as he saw the crushed Soul Condensation Pills. He pretended to be guilty and picked up a few Soul Condensation Pills that were full of mud.

Fei Ying raged as he witnessed the precious Soul Condensation Pills being stepped purposely by Song Junqiu and the rest. He held Ye Qingtang’s sleeves tightly. He would definitely do something on impulse if Ye Qingtang did not stop him.

“Young Lady! This is really too extreme!!” Fei Ying gritted his teeth and said. He could see the intentions of Song Junqiu at his age.
