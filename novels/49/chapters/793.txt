Chapter 794 Spank Your Bottom (1)

Long Jiang retreated disappointedly as blood seeped out from the corners of his mouth. 1

Panic was evident on Qin Long’s face, and even the little Emperor’s mischievous expression turned blank.

“Long… Long Jiang? What are you doing? Hurry…” Recovering from the shock, the little Emperor stood up and pointed at Long Jiang, who was severely injured.

However…

Before the little Emperor finished reproaching, a slim figure suddenly flew to his front.

He was directly lifted up from the royal sedan before he could react in time.

“Insolent! How dare you be disrespectful to me! Release me quickly!” The little Emperor looked at Ye Qingtang with wrath written all over his face and made threatening gestures to hit Ye Qingtang.

But his small arms and legs were nowhere near enough for him to be Ye Qingtang’s opponent, and no matter how he swung his fists, he could not touch Ye Qingtang a bit.

Ye Qingtang lifted the little Emperor from the royal sedan and leaped to her original position.

The little Emperor had never been treated like this by others and roared angrily. “How dare your filthy hands touch me?! Put me down quickly! I will slaughter your entire clan!” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ye Qingtang raised a brow and looked at the brutal and tyrannical little Emperor.

She did hear of this little Emperor’s fatuous and unruly behavior in her previous life, but it turned out to be even worse when she witnessed it today.

Ye Qingtang lifted the little Emperor with one hand while the other hand struck his bottom.

Pow Pow Pow Pow! The sound of a bottom being spanked could be heard in succession.

That clear sound dumbfounded everyone at the scene.

He…

He actually hit the Emperor’s bottom?

The little Emperor was stupefied from the spanking. He had never been hit by someone in his life.

“Lowly peasant! How dare you hit my bottom! I want to kill you! I want to kill your entire clan!”

Ye Qingtang was emotionless as she looked coldly at the little Emperor who was still clamoring non-stop. She raised her hand once again and spanked the little Emperor’s bottom without restraint.

To this day, a dignified Emperor had never been spanked on his bottom in public before.

“Escort… Escort…” Flushed from the spanking, the little Emperor was in pain and frantic.

Only then did the guards return to their senses. They were about to move forward, but they did not dare to move an inch after Ye Qingtang cast them a cold glance.

Not mentioning the fact that even the most skilled person in Nine Nights Dynasty, Long Jiang, was not this young man’s opponent, the fact that the little Emperor was in the young man’s hands caused the guards to not dare to move recklessly.

Otherwise, their entire clan would be exterminated if the little Emperor was injured.

“Lowly peasant! Release me quickly. I…”

Pow pow pow! Ye Qingtang slapped his bottom successively once again. “If you scold me once, I’ll spank you ten times.”

The little Emperor was stupefied. He glared at Ye Qingtang angrily, yet he was afraid of being hit and could only purse his lips. His pink cheeks were puffed up from the anger, and his teary eyes were filled with exasperation and embarrassment.

“You… Put his Majesty down quickly…” Long Jiang barely steadied himself as he looked at Ye Qingtang with a frown.

“You are not my opponent.” Ye Qingtang looked at Long Jiang indifferently.

Long Jiang’s expression stiffened, but he had to admit it.

He simply had no chance of winning against this young man.

“Your little Emperor is in my hands now. If you want him to be safe and sound, kill Qin Long, and I’ll release him.” Ye Qingtang’s eyes suddenly landed on Qin Long

Long Jiang looked straight at Qin Long, and a trace of murderous air emerged in his eyes.
