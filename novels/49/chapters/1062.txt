Chapter 1063 Shameless (2)

The two Beiming Manor elderlies were here for none other than Ye Qingtang, a Yang Lord.

Once Ye Qingtang left and was not within Beiming Manor’s boundary of control or joined Peerless School or Phantom Valley, it was not a good thing to Beiming Manor.

Although it was said that Beiming Manor could never accept another Yang Lord in order to maintain the balance among the three mighty forces, they could not let the Yang Lord end up in someone else’s hands. They had to hold onto her first, and whatever they decided to do with her was something to be dealt with later on.

“Join Beiming Manor?” Ye Qingtang shook her head. “Not interested.”

“Not interested?!”

After they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, a glint flashed across the Beiming Manor elderly’s eyes

No matter whether this lady was uninterested in Beiming Manor or in the three mighty forces, both Beiming Manor elderlies did not dare to take this risk as the consequences would be dire should they not deal with this Yang Lord.

“Not interested. Do you still want me to say it a third time?” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

Ye Qingtang had lived for hundreds of years and was clearly aware of what Beiming Manor was thinking, which was merely to hold onto her. However, once she joined Beiming Manor, the consequences would then be truly dire.

“Little girl… Do you really not want to reconsider?” The Beiming Manor elderly stared at Ye Qingtang and asked with a frown.

“There’s no need to reconsider.” Ye Qingtang replied firmly.

Upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s reply, the two Beiming Manor elderlies exchanged a look. One of them nodded with a smile and said, “Alright. Beiming Manor has never forced people to do things against their will. Since you’re unwilling, forget it then. However, if you are interested in the Beiming Manor in the future, you can head to Beiming Manor directly. Our doors will always be open for you.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If that’s the case, thanks a lot then,” Ye Qingtang said.

It was the best if the two Beiming Manor elderlies thought that way. However, Ye Qingtang snickered to herself. They spoke so nicely on the surface, but it was impossible for Ye Qingtang to not know exactly what those two were thinking.

“I’ll take my leave then.”

Ye Qingtang cupped her fists towards the two Beiming Manor elderlies and subsequently turned around, wanting to leave.

However, just as Ye Qingtang turned around, one of the Beiming Manor elderly’s eyes twinkled. Horrifying killing intent exploded from him, and he dashed forward at top speed; he was so fast that one could only see the motion of the waves of air with the naked eye. A black mist that emerged from his palm subsequently aimed towards the back of Ye Qingtang’s head.

For a battle among Yang Lords of similar cultivation realm, if one party was totally unguarded while the other launched a sneak attack, the one who sneaked an attack could very possibly kill the other with one strike at close distance!

However, at this critical moment, Ye Qingtang scoffed. In a flash, she turned around and raised her palm to attack the Beiming Manor elderly.

A deep rumble echoed around them immediately. As Ye Qingtang’s palm slammed against the Beiming Manor elderly’s palm, it was as though there was a thunderous explosion from the sky.

After this strike, the two of them retreated several steps away from each other.

“Oh…”

The Beiming Manor elderly stared at Ye Qingtang and was taken aback. He previously saw that this Yang Lord was young and judged that her experiences in the outside world should be rather little. As such, whatever he said earlier on was just to make Ye Qingtang lower her guard.
