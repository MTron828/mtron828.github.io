Chapter 559 We Will Meet Again Some Day (4)

They could not only believe Xuanling Sect completely as well since no one had any evidence after all.

Moreover, Yunxiao Sect and Xuanling Sect were enemies, and the words of Xuanling Sect disciples might contain some slander.

“Haha. This is a private issue between Yunxiao Sect and Xuanling Sect and has nothing to do with us… However, it better be that Xuanling Sect is talking nonsense. If Yunxiao Sect is truly like what Xuanling Sect said…”

The Lingyun Sect Master sneered and stopped his sentence there.

Before Li Chenfeng could explain, a shadow suddenly fell on the place.

Almost instinctively, everyone gazed up in the air.

A giant battleship floated in midair, where a man in white stood in it.

“Antiquity Palace?!”

“That person is Antiquity Palace’s emissary, Mu Su?” The three sects were extremely astonished.

The Antiquity Palace was similar to the Blood Moon Sect, except that the Blood Moon Sect was evil while the Antiquity Palace was the leader of the righteous.

Furthermore, the Antiquity Palace did not gather followers like the Blood Moon Sect, and its Palace Lord was all the more mysterious. His skills were profound and unfathomable, and he rarely appeared before people.

Including the people present in Xuanling Sect, everyone guessed that the Antiquity Palace’s appearance was probably related to the Blood Moon Sect.

Standing on the battleship, Mu Su swept a glance over the area below him.

He had already reached here a long time ago and originally intended to bring Ye Qingtang away. Yet unexpectedly, the Blood Moon Holy Lord suddenly appeared. Thus, he did not dare to casually appear.

What Mu Su never expected was Ye Qingtang actually becoming the Blood Moon Holy Lady. How was he going to mention it to His Highness when he returned…

“Lord Mu Su, Xuanling Sect was speaking nonsense just now. Please do not believe it!”

Li Chenfeng’s brows were tightly furrowed, as he did not know whether Mu Su heard what the Xuanling Sect elders had said.

However, Mu Su vanished quickly without uttering a word.

Once the Antiquity Palace’s battleship was gone, Li Chenfeng finally sighed in relief. He immediately looked at Xuanling Sect with coldness filled in his eyes.

This Xuanling Sect has to be gotten rid of?

Allowing them to live in this world is not a good thing to Yunxiao Sect!

However, it was difficult to break the barrier above Xuanling Sect, and this troubled him greatly.

The sect protector divine beast was heavily injured and still required time to recuperate once it returned to the sect. There was simply no way it could continue to battle in a short time. Without the divine beast, it would be difficult to break Xuanling Sect’s barrier.

As Li Chenfeng stared at the barrier, a slightly odd feeling arose in his heart.

If Xuanling Sect executed this barrier from the start, it would have probably been impossible for them to charge in…

However, things had already reached this point, and Li Chenfeng did not continue to think further. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

At that instant, in a hidden corner.

After seeing Mu Su passing by there, Ye Qingtang initially thought that the Antiquity Palace, as the leader of the righteous path, was there to rescue Xuanling Sect from the misery, but she ultimately realized that she was overthinking…

“Holy Lady, let’s go. We must not let Yunxiao Sect find us,” the Blood Moon Elder said softly.

“Let’s go.”

Ye Qingtang agreed, and the two of them disappeared.

Not long later, both Lingyun Sect and Yuehua Sect left successively while Yunxiao Sect secretly ordered people to watch Xuanling Sect.

Although they could not enter the barrier, the Xuanling Sect people could leave the barrier. If they did not watch Xuanling Sect, all of the Xuanling Sect masses would escape before long.

It was Li Chenfeng’s excessive worry this time. Many disciples in Xuanling Sect were heavily injured and had to continue to be treated. Before those disciples recovered, the Xuanling Sect masses would naturally not go anywhere.
