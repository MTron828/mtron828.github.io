Chapter 2382: Making A Choice (1)

Soon after, the Netherworld Academy teachers had all gathered. Since knowing of the rule changes, they had been deliberating over it non-stop.

“This year’s Inter-Academy Competition is very important to our academy. Does anyone have any thoughts?” Wen Qi asked.

The teachers all looked grave. No matter how one looked at it, the Netherworld Academy had no advantage at all for this year’s Inter-Academy Competition.

Due to the storms, the mainland where the Netherworld Academy was situated was isolated from the other mainlands. Even if the family clans from the other mainlands had wanted to enroll their youths in the Netherworld Academy, they would give up in the end due to the relentless storms.

Moreover, their mainland was somewhat different from the other mainlands.

The sects flourished on their mainland. Due to the presence of the Temple of Paragon and the deep pockets of the family clans, they would choose to send their top talents to the stricter sects instead. This resulted in a dwindling number of elite youths enrolled in the Netherworld Academy.

This situation had only worsened over time, contributing to the gradual decline of the Netherworld Academy.

“Vice-President, apart from the team competition, there are not many changes to the other segments. Although we are not supposed to speak of some things, for fear of tarnishing our reputation, I must still speak up. Just looking at the martial arts segment, our Netherworld Academy has no advantage at all.” One of the teachers spoke up in exasperation.

There was a significant disparity between the top students from the Netherworld Academy and those from the other academies.

“For alchemy, Song Yanhan and Yun Chen might be able to win placements… but even if they successfully enter the top 10, we still need one more.” Luo Sheng looked grim.

As the Netherworld Academy had Elder Zhu, their medicine faculty was still coping well. And Ye Qing had produced Yun Chen, who had become another potential candidate.

But the Netherworld Academy needed at least three spirit jades to be able to retain their permanent spot in the Inter-Academy Competition…

“In your opinion, what are the chances of Qin Feng and Ran Mo winning in the competition?” Wen Qi asked.

The teachers exchanged looks. For a moment there, no one spoke. This silence was a good indication of what they were thinking on the inside.

Although Ran Mo was very gifted, he was still too young. If he could continue training for a few more years, he would be able to stand out in the martial arts segment. As for Qin Feng, he should have been the best candidate but due to his decline over the past few years, his progress had been delayed by quite a bit.

If he hadn’t met Ye Qing, Qin Feng might have just completely disappeared from everyone’s radar.

These two were very talented but one was too young while the other’s progress had been delayed. Even with their current powers, they were still quite some distance behind the top students from the other academies.

The group all felt that it was such a pity. If only they had another year to prepare for the Inter-Academy Competition. Their Netherworld Academy would not end up in such a dismal state then.

Only the top 10 would be selected in the martial arts segment and both Qin Feng and Ran Mo were from the martial arts faculty…

From what the teachers observed, all the other academies had over 20 Divine Lord Third Heaven level students…

The Netherworld Academy had no chance of winning. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wen Qi was well aware of their situation. He had already mentally prepared for this, but faced with the truth now, he still couldn’t help feeling depressed.

All the while Ye Qingtang silently observed the scene. She more or less had a clear idea of the Netherworld Academy’s circumstances now.
