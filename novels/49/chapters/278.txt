Chapter 279: My Junior Sister Is Amazing (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Martial Qi was a grade that only inner sect disciples possessed. There were three grades between Martial Qi Level One and Martial Qi Level Two which were called First Heaven, Second Heaven, and Third Heaven.

Between each of these three grades, there were three stages… Advancing from each stage was extremely difficult.

In Xuanling Sect, those who could reach this realm most likely were only the inner sect elders who were in charge of internal affairs.

He was truly someone the status of a Blood Moon Sect Elder; Even though he had been miserable for thousands of years, a casual item he took out was already a Martial Qi Level Two treasure.

Ye Qingtang lived for three hundred over years in her previous life, and she was already at the Paragon level when she suffered a downfall. She had seen many of such treasures and obviously knew how beneficial this item was to people at the peak of Martial Qi Level Two.

However, it was useless to the current Ye Qingtang, and she could only keep it for future use.

“Thank you then.” Ye Qingtang kept the Revolving Soul Orb.

“Don’t mention about it. This is what I should do. I can’t use this item for now, and there’s no use leaving it aside.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder was elated when he saw Ye Qingtang keeping the Revolving Soul Orb.

This Revolving Soul Orb was indeed as powerful as what he said, but… it had a disadvantage…

The Revolving Soul Orb would absorb the essence in the world continuously, and if the essence was not absorbed by someone for a long time, the essence would exceed the Revolving Soul Orb’s capacity and explode.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder narrowed his eyes slightly and hid away the sly look in his eyes. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He was destined to be unable to kill Ye Qingtang right now because of the contract between them, but… if she died from the Revolving Soul Orb’s explosion, it would be completely unrelated to him. When she died, the contract would naturally be nullified, and he could regain his freedom.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder planned out everything well in his heart though his face did not reveal anything.

“Get rid of your corpse. You’re Zhou Qu from now on,” Ye Qingtang said.

Your corpse…

The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s lips twitched but still obediently picked up his dried corpse and absorbed all the remaining energy. This dried corpse had been in existence for thousands of years, and it was the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s power which allowed the corpse to maintain its current appearance. Now that it lost its very last remnants of energy, the corpse quickly turned into ash and vanished along with the wind.

Ye Qingtang nodded at the sight and led the Blood Moon Sect Elder towards the square where the disciples were locked up at.

As she walked, she added on. “Get rid of the blood fog around the city. You cannot touch those people in the square anymore.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder accepted the orders in obedience but sneered internally.

I’ll let you order me around now. When that Revolving Soul Orb explodes…

In the square, the people in despair looked at the red light that filled the sky, and the shadow of death remained in their eyes.

Qin Huan sat in the cage distraughtly as he pulled his hair. Regret was written all over his face.

“I should not have brought Junior Sister Ye here. It’s all my fault… I brought harm onto her…” At that moment, Qin Huan was extremely regretful. Had he known how dangerous this trip was, he would definitely not agree to bring Ye Qingtang along.

It was ultimately too late now.

Dai Changming sighed quietly. Under such circumstances, all of them had become lambs waiting to be slaughtered.

Dai Changming glanced across the bloody scene around him, but his eyes were suddenly attracted by two figures not far away. He suddenly widened his eyes and patted the regretful Qin Huan.

“Junior Brother Qin, take a look quickly! Who is that!”

Qin Huan looked up with a weary expression but was utterly stunned from the sight. He rushed forward and clutched on the metal cage tightly. Shock filled his eyes when he saw the figure that was nearing them.

“Junior Sister Ye!”
