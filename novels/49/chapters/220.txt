Chapter 219: Hidden Danger (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Apothecary still found a relatively nice house for Zhou Xuan and the rest to stay even though the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village was destroyed. He did not dare to neglect these disciples of the Xuanling Sect.

“We will go pack our luggage now and gather at the Level 1 hall later to discuss the clues we have found today.” Zhou Xuan acted as a leader and gave out commands.

No one had any objections, and everyone returned to their respective rooms.

Zhou Xuan held his composure until the moment he closed his door. He quickly removed his shirt and washed his hands repeatedly with water.

The corpses of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village were there for quite a long time. Though they were spread with powder, it could not slow down the speed of decay. Furthermore, the weather was not cold, and it was possible to have a plague outbreak. That was the reason why Zhou Xuan did not touch any single corpse today.

“Where does Ye Qingtang come from?” Zhou Xuan finally washed off the stink on his body and then remembered Ye Qingtang’s behaviors today.

He intended to make things difficult for her by asking her to investigate the skulls. However, she was not scared at all and found out the only clue.

Zhou Xuan felt slightly embarrassed, but… he was not in a rush to eliminate her now.

Zhou Xuan clearly remembered the revenge for Zhou Qu and the orders from Senior Brother Ning Luo. However, he realized the value of Ye Qingtang today. If he could make use of her to find out the truth of the tragedy in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, it would save a lot of troubles for himself. He could eliminate her afterward… Then, he could kill two birds with one stone.

Zhou Xuan was proud of himself for such brilliant plans. He sat lazily in his chair with his legs crossed. He leaned on the back of the chair, and his eyes were cunning.

“Ye Qingtang, you should treasure the time you have left with and use your brain to help me complete my mission.”

While Zhou Xuan was scheming against Ye Qingtang, Ye Qingtang left her room after washing up.

When she reached the hall, there were no other disciples yet. There was only one tall and handsome young man standing in the hall.

Wu Zheng heard the footsteps and saw Ye Qingtang coming down. He withdrew his sight and lowered his head humbly.

“Lady Ye.” Wu Zheng addressed her with respect.

Ye Qingtang smiled and walked downstairs. She sat on a random chair and used one of her hands to support her head and looked towards Wu Zheng.

Wu Zheng was very tall and had delicate features on his face. He was not that shockingly handsome, but his face was flawless when one observed closely.

“Don’t be so polite, Young Sir. Just sit down and talk.” Ye Qingtang smiled at him.

Wu Zheng hesitated for a while and eventually sat down.

“Since you are adopted by Wu Chengze, do you know who your real parents are?” Ye Qingtang pretended to be bored and threw out a random question. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“My parents are normal hunters. They were killed while hunting. Father adopted me when I was still young back then.” Wu Zheng replied.

“Young Sir, the Village Master and the Junior Masters died during the tragedy. I’m afraid that you will be the heir of the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village in the future, right?” Ye Qingtang chuckled and asked.
