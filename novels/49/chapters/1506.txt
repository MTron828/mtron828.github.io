Chapter 1507 Hunt Down 1

Jiang Shun laughed coldly. “Ye Qingtang found a high-level Dharma artifact, but gave it to someone else. She should be punished in accordance with our family rules. Aunt, if you don’t stay out of this, don’t blame me for being discourteous.”

Jiang Xun’s expression immediately darkened. She wanted to rain curses down upon Jiang Shun’s head.

Under those circumstances, Ye Qingtang would certainly have died if she did not hand the items over. The Jiang Family not only did not step forward to protect her, but were now attacking her instead.

At that moment, Jiang Xun understood that Jiang Shun and the others were only looking for an excuse to kill Ye Qingtang.

Jiang Xun suddenly spoke softly to Ye Qingtang, who was behind her.

“Tang Tang, you’d better go.”

With that, Jiang Xun suddenly attacked Jiang Shun and the others while Ye Qingtang turned and fled without a word.

When Jiang Shun and the others saw that Ye Qingtang was escaping, their expressions darkened. Jiang Shun met Jiang Xun’s attack, then gestured to Jiang Qin and the rest. Jiang Qin and the others immediately gave chase.

Jiang Qin led a group of Jiang Family disciples and chased her. As the distance between Ye Qingtang and them narrowed, a cold, malicious gleam flashed across Jiang Qin’s eyes.

“Let’s see where you can run to!” Jiang Qin’s lips arched in a chilly smile. She increased her speed and was just about to deal a blow to Ye Qingtang’s back when a blinding beam of light shot forth from behind Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin was startled. She sensed an immense aura surround her, coming from the void. Before she had time to look up, the beam of light shot past her and flew directly towards the nearby Ye Qingtang.

Boom! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

A huge explosion rang in their ears.

Jiang Qin looked up at the void in shock, only to see the old man from the Second Domain. At some point, he had caught up with them, and now, he was looking down at Ye Qingtang from his vantage point. The latter had been struck by the beam of light. His eyes were filled with cold amusement.

Jiang Qin was shocked, but delighted.

Ye Qingtang must have annoyed this powerful cultivator from the Second Domain when she handed the two Dharma treasures to the Celestial Fairy. But this person was even more powerful than their Fifth Uncle.

Ye Qingtang would probably be killed this time without them needing to lift a finger.

As Jiang Qin waited to confirm Ye Qingtang’s death, Ye Qingtang was surrounded by the beam of light that had struck her. Ye Qingtang was not spurting blood under the blinding light, as Jiang Qin had expected. Instead, her figure flickered and then disappeared...

When the light disappeared, there was no trace of blood where Ye Qingtang had been standing.

“What’s going on?” Jiang Qin’s eyes widened. She had personally witnessed Ye Qingtang being struck. Why did she disappear?

“An illusion, hmph...” The old man from the Second Domain, who was in the void, saw the image vanish before his eyes. A malicious look slowly surfaced in his eyes. Then, he vanished from the void with a flash.

“Aunt Qin, what happened to Ye Qingtang?” A Jiang Family disciple who had accompanied Jiang Qin could not understand what he was seeing.

Jiang Qin was no fool.

“That Jiang Xun. I didn’t expect her to be able to create an illusion of Ye Qingtang. I thought it was strange...” Jiang Qin’s eyes narrowed slightly. At that moment, she finally understood that the Ye Qingtang they had been pursuing was an illusion made out of spirit energy.
