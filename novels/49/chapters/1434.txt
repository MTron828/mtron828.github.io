1435 Slander 1

Ye You’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang unconsciously. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Qingtang did not have any facial expressions, but she was rather shocked on the inside.

According to the information that Ling Yan provided, that lady in green had not been in the Jiang Family since young. The Jiang Family only knew that the Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her body would mutate into the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline when she was of age. However, they were unsure of her location.

Rather, it was Ling Yan who found out that the lady went to the Second Domain.

Although the Jiang Family had been looking into the lady’s location, it was to no avail partly due to the fact that the lady went to the Second Domain.

The Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline in Ye Qingtang belonged to that lady originally.

Jiang Qin fixed her expression and said subsequently, “So what if she is the child of my second brother and sister-in-law? Since she made a mistake, she must be punished. She bullied You once and again. Should she be let off just because she is my second brother’s child?”

Elder Xu and Jiang Liu knew that Ye You was extremely protective of Ye You, and with Jiang Qin’s strong personality, this matter probably would not end so easily.

“Whatever conflicts that You and Tang Tang have might as well be settled this time. If there is nothing serious, then let bygones be bygones.” Jiang Liu immediately mediated.

Jiang Qin scoffed and looked at Ye You, signaling Ye You to recount her unjust treatment.

But what could Ye You say at this point?

“There’s nothing much actually. Those things happened in the past, and I’ve long forgotten about it. Shall we forget it, Aunt Qin? Tang Tang is a member of the Jiang Family, and I don’t wish to talk about the past incidents,” Ye You said very obediently, but there was a hint of grievance as though she gave up on her own grudge for the bigger picture.

Those who were unaware of the truth would think that Ye You suffered a huge injustice.

Elder Xu and Jiang Liu admired Ye You’s generous response greatly.

Of course, Ye Qingtang knew what Ye You’s intentions were.

Ye You played the nice guy already while she somehow shouldered baseless accusations.

“Sister You must really feel aggrieved…” Ye Qingtang said suddenly.

Compared to Ye You’s compromise, Ye Qingtang’s sarcastic statement caused Elder Xu and the rest to frown slightly.

“Ye Qingtang, You has backed down already, but you are still so insensible. If not for You’s persuasion, I definitely would not let you off so easily.” Jiang Qin scoffed coldly.

“Tang Tang, you are at fault this time.” Jiang Liu was a little dissatisfied at Ye Qingtang’s unwillingness to forgive Ye You.

Looking at the people who were deceived by Ye You, Ye Qingtang laughed and said, “I did not know that there’s such a thing in this world. Ye You was clearly the one who dug my spirit root, but it seemed like I bullied her from what she said.”

Ye Qingtang’s words surprised everyone.

“What did you say? You snatched your spirit root?” Elder Xu looked at Ye Qingtang in astonishment.

Even Jiang Liu was a little dumbfounded.

Ye You’s face froze suddenly. She did not think that Ye Qingtang would suddenly mention this incident.

Yet Jiang Qin had a face of disbelief.

“Ye Qingtang, don’t slander You just because she has a nice personality. How will You snatch your spirit root?”

“Slander? My spirit root is in her body right now. There is a resonance between the spirit root and its original owner. If you don’t believe me, you are free to check it,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.
