Chapter 2392: Wailing Well (1)

The next two days passed in the blink of an eye. Soon enough, the final segment of the Inter-Academy Competition finally arrived.

The team competition was upon them and the location was the Wailing Well situated in the Evil Marsh. A strange and mystical land which was only recently opened. Over a hundred teams from the various academies, comprising thousands of participants, were fully prepared, just waiting for this final battle.

There was only one entrance to the Wailing Well. The academy teams had to draw lots to decide the sequence of entry. Without the special talisman, no one would be able to leave the Wailing Well after entering.

And for this year’s competition, they had to remain in the Wailing Well for a fixed period of time and kill the most number of demons to win. As a result, the team to enter the Wailing Well first would have the greatest advantage. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Lei Yan and the others had already prepared everything. Due to the special rules for this competition, they had to hand over their space rings to others for safekeeping. Apart from their clothes and personal weapons, they could not bring anything in.

Only the teachers in the various teams could bring one space ring, and it could only contain the teleportation talisman to leave the wailing well, as well as the medicine faculty students’ tripods.

No food, no water, no elixirs, no special artifacts… once inside the Wailing Well, they would face a harsh, unknown land.

Ye Qingtang went forward to draw their lot. Lei Yan and the others waited at the side.

“Humph, haven’t seen you all for so long. Didn’t think you guys would have the guts to show up today.” A mocking voice rang out from behind the group.

Lei Yan and the others turned to see Xing Rong with a group of Heaven Dome Academy students.

Since that fateful day, Xing Rong held a grudge against them. He wanted to see if he could get a chance to beat up Lei Yan and the others during the martial arts sparring matches.

But unexpectedly…

He didn’t even catch a glimpse of them in the arena.

Thereafter, Xing Rong heard that the Netherworld Academy’s top two students had not participated in the sparring matches at all. This became a big joke and a major talking point amongst the other academies.

Lei Yan wanted to charge forward but Qin Feng stopped him.

Now was not the time to get in a fight.

Xing Rong sneered provocatively at them with a mocking expression.

“I won’t let you off so easily for our previous altercation. After entering the Wailing Well, you’d better pray that you don’t encounter me. Otherwise…” Xing Rong narrowed his eyes which were filled with threat.

“Xing Rong, don’t waste your breath on them. Teacher said that our main opponents are the Sky Martial Academy and Cold Cloud Academy.” One of the teenagers reminded him.

The Netherworld Academy had fallen so far behind that they were no threat to anyone, and no one treated them as competition.

“That’s right.” Xing Rong smiled.

“But I can still toy with them. Haha.”

With that, Xing Rong and his team turned to leave.

“Damn, after entering the Wailing Well, let’s see who’s afraid of whom.” Lei Yan gritted his teeth as he glared at Xing Rong’s departing profile.

But Song Yanhan, who didn’t know what had happened between the two sides, looked grim. He didn’t expect for Lei Yan and his team to have already made enemies with the Heaven Dome Academy even before the competition started.

It should be pointed out that the Heaven Dome Academy’s Yin Kongluo had won second place in the individual martial arts competition. Their power was not something which they could go against.

It was definitely not a good thing to be targeted by those folks so early on.

After all, there were no rules stating that teams couldn’t attack each other inside the Wailing Well.
