Chapter 1859: Hoodwinked (2)

Astuteness flashed past Ye Qingtang’s eyes. The owner of the Nine Souls Ring was the Holy Lord of Shadows. Ye Qingtang wasn’t certain of the value of it and how attractive it would be to the fat catfish, but seeing their reactions...

It was obvious that the worth of the Nine Souls Ring was way more than a mere 500 spirit stones.

She knew exactly what to do. With a hesitant expression, she replied, “500 spirit stones? Let me think about it.”

Once the fat catfish noticed Ye Qingtang’s hesitation, it panicked. “If that’s too little, I’ll add a hundred more spirit stones.”

“Hundred?” Ye Qingtang’s attitude was ambiguous.

The fat catfishes surrounding them were also tempted to make an offer. Nothing was set in stone yet, they could still intercept!

“Lass, I’ll offer 700 spirit stones!” A fat catfish wasn’t shy to make an intercepting offer.

“700? I’ll do 800!”

Once a fat catfish made the first move, the other started making offers and in no time, the bet went up to 1200 spirit stones.

The rapid increase in stakes was a pleasant surprise for Ye Qingtang.

To think that the bangle of the Holy Lord of Shadows was this attractive to the fat catfishes?

Why?

When the first fat catfish that Ye Qingtang had originally approached saw the other fat catfishes vying for the bet, its face darkened to a charcoal black.

“2000! I’ll bet with you!” it shouted.

The other fat catfishes were slightly hesitant hearing the number of spirit stones.

Not because they felt the bangle wasn’t worth it, but because... they didn’t have that many spirit stones with them.

Disappointment was written all over their faces.

“Alright, how do we go about it?” Ye Qingtang was pretty satisfied with the offer. With inconspicuous movements, she was ready to get a strand of hair on stand-by.

But who knew...

“Let’s bet on whether the number of petals of the first flower that falls from the tree is an odd or even number,” the fat catfish said as it patted the tree behind it.

The tree was enormous and seemed to reach the skies. Pink flowers grew beautifully on the tree, with heavy layers of petals.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

They could do it this way too?

Ye Qingtang surveyed their surroundings, noticing that other than dice, there were many strange items placed on the tables around.

Ye Qingtang hadn’t noticed the purpose of those items, but now she did.

These items were all for the fat catfishes to make their bets...

They could bet on literally anything and everything. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, Ye Qingtang wasn’t flustered at all. With her rich experiences in her previous lifetime, she was confident in dealing with such a scenario.

However...

“I have a feeling...” Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke with a low volume.

Little White Tiger lifted its head, feeling confused.

“Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo might come back crying...”

The fat catfish was impatient, rushing Ye Qingtang into making a decision. Thinking about the situation she would have to face later, she wasted no time and pushed on decisively.
