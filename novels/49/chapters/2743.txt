Chapter 2744: The Truth (2)

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback and asked the big yellow dog, “You can?”

“What a joke. Of course I can. I’m the second Tian after all. Although I’m no longer the same… I can still do such things. On account of the fact that you and I have gone through so much together, I’ll help you.” After the yellow dog finished speaking, a dark glint appeared in its eyes which instantly enveloped the cave.

...

In that instant, ripples appeared in the air and time seemed to reverse. The woman’s body actually regained vitality.

“Di Feng… I’m sorry… I brought this upon you…” Di Jiuyuan looked at the dead man in her arms. Her face was ashen. “Did we do wrong… Why did we invite such a disaster…”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply and looked at Di Jiuyuan, not knowing what had happened.

“Little girl, this is your mother’s last memory before she passed away. Luckily her body was intact, otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to do this,” the big yellow dog explained to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded and instinctively moved forward. Her hands reached out to touch Di Jiuyuan’s body, but they went through her body.

“Little girl, what you are seeing is just a memory. You can’t interfere. It’s a pity. If only I was still Tian…” The yellow dog sighed.

“What if you were still Tian?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang. “If I was still Tian, I would have sufficient Heavenly Dao energy to revive your parents. This is one of the abilities of being Tian.”

“Tian… has such an ability?!” Ye Qingtang was shocked.

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang recalled that in the cursed hell, the man who claimed to be Tian told her that he could satisfy anything she wished for, including… achieving immortality on the spot.

......

If she became Tian, she would be invincible! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“If Tian was so powerful, why were you defeated?” Ye Qingtang could not understand.

“Hmph, I get angry just thinking about it. Although Shi Tian was not from the Heavenly Demon Tribe, he had the power of a god-grade Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. I was tricked by him. He snuck up on me and took advantage of my surprise to absorb a portion of my Heavenly Dao power. If my Heavenly Dao power was complete, how would I be defeated by him?” The big yellow dog’s face was filled with indignance.

“I also have the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. Can I become… Tian then?!” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered.

“Even if you have it, it’s impossible to devour the power of the Heavenly Dao unless you have a god-grade Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. Don’t even think about it.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Before Ye Qingtang could reply, a cold chuckle spread throughout the secret lair.

In the next second, a star spirit appeared.

“God of Nature?!”

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when she saw the star spirit.

“It’s you?!” Di Jiuyuan suddenly stood up as if she was facing a formidable enemy. She glared at the star spirit. “Why did you kill my husband and force us to come here?!”

The star spirit smiled and said, “Sigh, who asked you to be so disobedient? Your daughter is a genius, but the two of you want to go into seclusion and live a normal life…”

“What business is that of yours?!” Di Jiuyuan said angrily.

“Of course it’s my business…” The star spirit smiled gently. “But you don’t have to know the truth. Come, hand over the child. I will not hurt her.”

Di Jiuyuan replied, “Dream on!”

“Tsk tsk, don’t worry. Leave the child to me. I’ll nurture her to become the most powerful being in this world. I can even let her become a True God or a Perfected immortal…”
