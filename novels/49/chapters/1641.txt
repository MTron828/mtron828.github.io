Chapter 1642: Forced To Concede (1)

Everyone was shocked after Ye Qingtang suddenly admitted defeat.

“The top twenty candidates who are going to the Martial Arts Championship represent our Jiang Family. Now, there is such a person inside. Won’t she ruin our reputation?”

“Elders, Ye Qingtang does not deserve to go to the Martial Arts Championship!”

Those young men who were defeated earlier were all angry. They hoped that they could fight against Ye Qingtang right now to show her that she did not deserve to go for the Martial Arts Championship.

Elder Qian and the rest were also stunned. They did not pay attention to her during the selection, but no one expected that she could be so lucky to enter the top twenty effortlessly.

Complaints arose from everywhere. The Elders looked towards each other helplessly.

“The selection is absolutely fair. Luck is also a part of skill. Otherwise, why do we ask you to draw lots?” Elder Qian contemplated for a while and stopped the complaints from the audience.

“But how can Ye Qingtang represent the Jiang Family to attend the Martial Arts Championship?”

Everyone refused to accept that.

“Is it due to the Domain Monarch Founder... that she can be so lucky...” Someone murmured.

Elder Qian’s expression immediately darkened.

The young man shut his mouth as he knew that he said something inappropriate.

Not only the young men suspected Ye Qingtang’s luck—Elder Qian and the rest also held some suspicions. However, the process of drawing lots was open and fair. No one could play any tricks here. They could only admit that Ye Qingtang’s luck was insane.

Elder Qian’s sight landed on Ye Qingtang. He looked at her in a complicated way, but the ranking battles would continue, so he asked everyone to quiet down.

Though Jiang Yiran won without any effort, he felt like he had just swallowed a fly. He had no place to vent his anger. He would really fight her in a secret place if he did not have battles ahead.

He had met shameless people before, but not someone as shameless as her!

Everyone’s comments did not affect Ye Qingtang. They would know whether she wasted this position when it came to the Martial Arts Championship.

“Congratulations, Qingtang.” Jiang Yisheng smiled and looked at Ye Qingtang sincerely.

Elders were right. Luck was a part of skill.

“Little girl, you’re so lucky. You provoked Jiang Yiran earlier on, and now you entered the top twenty. Please help if there’s going to be some blind drawing rewards.”

The fight between Jiang Yiran and Ye Qingtang was only known to Jiang Yisheng and the few of them. Jiang Yiran would definitely not let the information out. Jiang Yisheng and the rest felt that Ye Qingtang was just too lucky, but they were not bothered by that.

Ye Qingtang smiled at Jiang Yisheng and the rest but did not say anything.

Jiang Yisheng still had ranking battles later and could not leave now. The rest of the men who lost earlier on all asked Ye Qingtang to treat them to a meal to comfort their lost.

Ye Qingtang agreed instantly and treated them to a meal.

While halfway through eating, Ye Qingtang was called over by Elder Qian. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

There were other elders managing the selection, so Elder Qian brought Ye Qingtang to the empty martial hall.
