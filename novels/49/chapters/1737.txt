Chapter 1738: A Bewitching Melody (3)

A loud clang rang out!

No matter how many times Ye Qingtang tried, she could not penetrate the troll’s defence.

Even so, Ye Qingtang was becoming increasingly calm.

She had no idea whether little Heavenly Demon’s bewitching melody had a limit to it. Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to waste a single second. Her attention was suddenly focused on the troll’s huge eyes.

“Little White Tiger!” Ye Qingtang suddenly called out. Understanding immediately what was asked, Little White Tiger immediately took out another fruit and tossed it to little Heavenly Demon.

Carrying the fruit, little Heavenly Demon continued to hum its bewitching melody. But this time, its voice was significantly softer.

Ye Qingtang could instinctively tell that the little Heavenly Demon was too young to be able to use its bewitching melody too many times. She immediately stepped off the troll’s arm and flew to the top of its head. With her Black Flame Sword in hand, she viciously stabbed the troll’s wide open right eye.

The sword instantly pierced into the troll’s eyeball.

The intense pain caused the troll to snap out of its trance. It gave an ear-piercing howl as it raised its hand toward its own eye.

This was her last chance! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Watching as the troll raised its huge palm, Ye Qingtang drew out her sword and flipped over to stab the troll’s other eye.

Thick, viscous fluid spurted out of the wound. Ye Qingtang drove the entire sword right into the eyeball before leaping away. She managed to escape right before the troll’s huge palm smacked down.

Earth-shattering howls erupted continuously from the troll.

The moment Ye Qingtang landed on the ground, she conjured a roaring black fire with her bare hands and directed a steady stream of dark flames straight towards the sword embedded in the troll’s eyes. Being channelled through the sword, the flames spread throughout the troll’s body from within.

The troll’s most challenging factor was its iron-cast skin. No weapon was able to penetrate it. But if the attack came from within, that tough skin was no protection at all.

The troll emitted gut-wrenching shrieks the moment the black flames entered its body. Balls of dark fire spurted out of the troll’s orifices.

Black flames spurted out of its eyes, ears, mouth and nose. That immense body swayed side to side and after a long time, the troll suddenly collapsed on the ground. There were no visible wounds on its body but its eyeballs had already been burned away, leaving two huge empty sockets. The flames continued to rage within those sockets, looking very freaky and deranged.

“You killed the troll.” Little White Tiger flew down and stared at Ye Qingtang in amazement.

Shoulders heaving from the adrenaline, Ye Qingtang panted as she stared at the dead troll. She was also astonished.

She had killed a troll?

It must be pointed out that any one of these things could single-handedly destroy not just a country but a whole continent...

Ye Qingtang suddenly turned to look somewhere behind Little White Tiger.

Having finished eating a whole bag of fruit, little Heavenly Demon was obediently sitting on Little White Tiger’s back. It gazed at Ye Qingtang with a tilted head.

Ye Qingtang’s expression softened.

If not for little Heavenly Demon, she and Little White Tiger would have been no match for the troll.

“Thanks, little fellow.” Ye Qingtang reached out and stroked little Heavenly Demon’s head.

Little Heavenly Demon blinked as it continued to stare at Ye Qingtang’s space ring, which it knew was filled with food.

“...”

This greedy little creature!
