Chapter 1660: Beauty Roll (1)

“Bullshit! Qingtang won based on her skills. What do you mean by catching him unaware!” Jiang Yisheng scoffed.

“Whatever you say.” Jiang Yiran rolled his eyes at Jiang Yisheng.

Ye Qingtang’s victory over Lin Weiyuan was unexpected to the youths in the Jiang Family. But on another thought, that Lin Weiyuan was not considered highly-skilled and because of this, they did not find it too strange that Ye Qingtang won.

Everyone would only have one round of sparring in the Martial Arts Championship and they were free to rest once their round ended.

This was the last match of the day. Most of the people from the Jiang Family passed their round while only a handful were unlucky to meet formidable opponents and failed to advance.

All in all, Elder Qian and the others were pretty satisfied with the results from the first day. The matches for the second day were to be decided by drawing lots, thus everyone was still unfamiliar with their next opponent.

After the matches, Ye Qingtang and the rest looked for a place to indulge in a meal. As everyone from the various ancient clans were on the Island of Immortal Footsteps, all eateries and lodgings are also within the boundaries.

When they arrived at the Island of Immortal Footsteps restaurant, it was already exceptionally packed. Most of the youths from all the ancient clans were gathered here to have a good meal. Of course, the victors were joyous while the losers were not in the mood and were silently nursing their emotional pain in their rooms.

Squeezing through the crowd, Ye Qingtang and the group found an empty table at a corner and sat down. Jiang Shaobai ordered plenty of dishes at once and subsequently sprawled on the table as though he was about to fall asleep anytime soon.

On the other hand, Jiang Yisheng and the others were boasting about their impressive performances in the arena.

All of a sudden, there was a sudden flurry of excitement in the restaurant and many people looked out of the restaurant.

Always one to get in on the action, Jiang Yisheng could not help but follow the crowd to look out as well, only to almost salivate.

“Mu Feiruo! It’s Mu Feiruo! My goddess!”

Outside the restaurant was a cool and elegant lady in cyan clothes, who was escorted into the restaurant by a crowd of people. Despite the large crowd of people revolving around her, Mu Feiruo remained expressionless as though she was not involved in this boisterous situation.

Beside Mu Feiruo was a sweet-looking girl who was all smiles. The girl bore some resemblance with Mu Feiruo, but both had completely different dispositions. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Is that Mu Ruxue?” A youth from the Jiang Family asked when he saw that pretty girl.

“It should be. Mu Ruxue is Mu Ruxue’s younger sister. I heard that she is very talented as well and that she will be displaying her skills in the Martial Arts Championship this year. Although she does look quite similar to my goddess... my goddess is still the prettiest to me.” Jiang Yisheng was smitten and his saliva was drooping as he stared at Mu Feiruo’s aloof face.

When paired with this lovestruck expression, his normally attractive facial features were truly wasted and all the group felt about him was disgust.

Mu Feiruo went to the second floor of the restaurant quickly and happened to sit not far away from Jiang Yisheng. As Jiang Yisheng had adored Mu Feiruo for a long time, he was ecstatic to be able to interact with her at such “close distance” and stared at his goddess’s face to the best of his abilities from his seat in the corner.

“How can there be such a beautiful lady in the world?” Jiang Yisheng was completely besotted. As he was caught up in his staring, there was suddenly a slap on his head and he immediately turned around with a glare.
