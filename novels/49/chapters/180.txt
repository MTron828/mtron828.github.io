Ye Qingtang had a small frame, but the creature in her arms was so “magnificent.” The contrast between the two was striking. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Junior Sister Ye, this wolf…” Qin Huan wanted to say something but stopped, and his eyes had a complicated expression.

“I picked it up on my way back.” Ye Qingtang’s eyes immediately smiled blissfully once she talked about the wolf.

Everyone did not know what to feel.

They were chased by the lava throughout and had to run like dogs.

But Ye Qingtang was another level. Not only did she escape by herself, she even carried such a huge wolf back… This little junior sister was rather fierce.

“This wolf seems quite special. I have never seen a silver wolf before,” Gu Yanqiu said as he forced himself to stay composed. His junior sister had done many shocking things already.

“Right!” Ye Qingtang’s widened her bright eyes which were filled with pride and said, “I have never seen one before as well. At first, I suspected whether it was a demonic beast but did not see any demonic beast aura on its body. Perhaps, it’s a special breed.”

The certain Demon God who pretended to faint: “…”

Special… breed?!

Qin Huan touched his chin as he sized up that silver wolf. Just seeing Ye Qingtang’s spirited look, he already guessed that his junior sister was intending to raise this wolf. Shifting his gaze back to the wolf’s blinding fur, Qin Huan also thought that while the wolf was not conscious, it was more majestic the more he looked at it, and, perhaps, this was a good thing.

“Junior Sister Ye, you’re really lucky. I see that this wolf is pretty good…” Qin Huan said as he reached out to touch the wolf.

Suddenly, an undetectable deathly cold air radiated around the silver wolf, and a murderous aura filled the air.

But just when Qin Huan stretched out his hand, Ye Qingtang immediately took a step back while carrying the silver wolf and shouted at Qin Huan with a protective look. “Mine!”

“…” The Demon God’s heart was… very complicated.

The murderous aura subsequently vanished into thin air…

When Qin Huan looked at his hand hanging in the air and then looked at Ye Qingtang’s protective stance, his lips could not help but twitch.

“Okay okay okay… yours, yours. I will not snatch with you,” Qin Huan dropped his hand helplessly and could not help but quietly think to himself.

Why did he not see that his little junior sister had such a childish side to her?

It was just a touch, why did she have to be so stingy!

She had already given him the exorbitant fire-resistant soft armor but could not even let him touch a single hair of the wolf!

Ye Qingtang lifted her chin and hugged the silver wolf more tightly.

The image of the little wolf’s miserable death from her previous life was still etched in her mind. She instinctively protected the silver wolf in her arms tightly.

Qin Huan’s mood fell to the bottom since he could not touch the wolf and was even glared at by Ye Qingtang.

On the other hand, Gu Yanqiu and the rest were elated at the sight. They felt that this little junior sister was scarily powerful previously and was completely not like her age. But now, she acted a little spoiled like that of a teenage girl.

“It is not easy to ride a horse while carrying a wolf. Junior Brother Meng and I will look for a carriage from the town nearby,” Gu Yanqiu said.

“Thank you, two senior brothers,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

Gu Yanqiu and Meng Sheng were about to leave but felt that something was off suddenly. Their attention was completely attracted by that silver wolf in Ye Qingtang’s arms previously, and only now did they notice there was actually a huge cloth bag hung on her waist. Something circular was in that bag, and it was even dripping with blood.
