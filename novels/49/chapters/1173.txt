Chapter 1174: Heaven City (2)

“Please take a look.”

A while later, Gu Yu raised his hand and pointed afar.

Ye Qingtang and Peerless School Sect Master immediately looked in the direction that Gu Yu pointed at, and what laid before their eyes was a temporary camp.

“Brother Gu Yu, is that You Ancient Clan’s camp?” Peerless School Sect Master had a solemn expression after looking at it.

Gu Yu nodded and said, “That’s right, it is the You Ancient Clan’s camp. They are fully prepared. Every noon, they trap us within the city and besiege the city. A few powerful figures within the city could not take this lying down and went out to counter them… In the end, there were many deaths and injuries, and even Mo Feng lost his life…” Gu Yu sighed softly as helplessness overwhelmed him.

“There are many ordinary citizens in Heaven City and we are unable to replenish the food supplies and water after being trapped in the city. The stocked supplies are already running out now…” Gu Yu shook his head.

Yang Lords like Ye Qingtang and the Peerless School Sect Master could enter the city, and You Ancient Clan would not care nor stop them. However, if they were delivering water and rations, the You Ancient Clan would definitely kill the transporter. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

You Ancient Clan’s invasion strategy in Heaven City was extremely obvious. There was an array formation beneath Heaven City which made flying impossible, and the city walls were too high to be broken through forcefully. However, as long as the water and ration supplies to Heaven City were broken, the You Ancient Clan could achieve victory without fighting in no time.

“Miss Ye, do you have any good ways to overcome the You Ancient Clan’s strategy?” Gu Yu suddenly looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

“None at the moment.” Ye Qingtang replied honestly.

Before Gu Yu could continue speaking, Peerless School Sect Master said, “I cannot leave Sky Eagle City for too long and need to rush back now.”

“Alright. Be careful on your way.” Gu Yu nodded.

After Peerless School Sect Master left, Ye Qingtang looked at the situation at the bottom from the top of the city walls and frowned. Just as she had thought earlier, Heaven City’s situation was bleak. However, it was fortunate that the terrains were steep, so the You Ancient Clan could not do anything in a short while.

With Ye Qingtang’s arrival, Gu Yu summoned one thousand powerful figures to the top of the city walls.

With Gu Yu included, the entire Heaven City had three Yang Lords left currently, and the remaining people were at Yin Yang Perfected Lord Fourth Heaven to Sixth Heaven.

Two of the Yang Lords were heavily wounded from the battle with the You Ancient Clan talents.

The remaining powerful figures had a lukewarm attitude to Ye Qingtang.

They originally thought that the ancient clan Master would send some Yang Lords at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven, but they merely sent one person, and her cultivation base was only at the mid-stage of Yang Lord Eighth Heaven though she was young. What was the use of sending her then?

Even the youngest Yang Lord talent of the ancient clan, Mo Feng, died outside the city. Without sending more Yang Lords at the peak, it was impossible to resolve this problem.

Ye Qingtang was, however, not bothered by their lukewarm attitude, and she could even understand how they feel. If it was her, she might not be anywhere better than them either.

However, the mainland party was already in a disadvantageous position in the South battlefield due to the insufficient number of powerful figures. Otherwise, the Peerless School Sect Master would not head to Falling Sky Valley to look for her.

“Miss Ye, why don’t you go back to rest first? You can think of the countermeasure after recuperating and restoring your energy.” Gu Yu suggested with a smile.

However, before Ye Qingtang could reply, a group of You Ancient Clan people appeared at the bottom of the city walls.
