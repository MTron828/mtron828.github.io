Ye Qingtang’s action caused Han Cangming’s eyes to flicker. His beautiful brows furrowed a little when he saw the girl’s fearful behavior.

She’s afraid of him?

Why?

“Thank you for saving us today, senior…” Ye Qingtang lowered her head and tried to reduce her presence.

“Han Cangming,” said Han Cangming suddenly.

Ye Qingtang was astounded.

Was not Han Cangming the Palace Lord of Antiquity Palace?!

Her guess was indeed right!

Lin Long, who was standing from aside, was shaken to the core when she heard the words “Han Cangming”!

Han Cangming?!

That was actually Han Cangming!

The person who saved them was actually the Palace Lord of Antiquity Palace?!

She simply did not dare to believe that the legendary supreme figure in Antiquity Palace actually appeared in front of her and… even rescued her and Junior Sister Ye?

Lin Long even almost suspected whether she was hallucinating from the pain of the Blood Plague.

All of this was too much of a fantasy.

“My name.” Han Cangming could not help but say when he saw that Ye Qingtang was still like a frightened little rabbit.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little.

Of course she knew that it was his name, but why was he saying his name here?

Who knows whether Han Cangming had discovered the Heart of the Demon God in her…

Great powerful person, I know you are the most powerful person on earth. Please let my heart off!!

Ye Qingtang had a mental breakdown but did not show any of it on her face and could only say humbly, “I seek your forgiveness for being unaware of your arrival. I am unable to return your kindness for saving us today, but I will remember it for the rest of my life.”

For the first time, Ye Qingtang realized had such a suck-up side to her.

It was not that she was too weak but that the opposing partner was too powerful. She had no choice but to chicken out! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

She just escaped a wolf’s lair one moment ago and entered a tiger’s den in the next. Her heart was already flooded with tears from a long time ago.

If Han Cangming discovered the Heart of the Demon God, her only fate was death even if she grew two more legs!

Han Cangming looked down at the person who was only at his chest level. Her cautious behavior and the girl who touched him carelessly all over in Xuanling Sect on normal days were completely two different people.

The mountain forest was unusually silent in the dark night. The zombies that had not been killed sensed Han Cangming’s power and laid on the floor, shivering, not daring to move.

A cold night breeze brushed past them.

The unusual silence almost suffocated Ye Qingtang. There was no way for her to find out whether Han Cangming discovered the Heart of the Demon God in her heart. If he did not, why would a person with such a noble identity like him keep staring at her like this?

And just at that moment, Han Cangming, who remained silent all along suddenly, opened his mouth.

“Since you’re unable to repay my kindness…”

Ye Qingtang looked up slightly and at the beautiful god-like face in confusion.

Indifference was etched on Han Cangming’s face, and his lowered eyes reflected Ye Qingtang’s bewildered face. Han Cangming said slowly in a cold tone,

“Then marrying me will do.”

“…” Lin Long stared at the man.

What did I hear?

“…” Ye Qingtang also blanked out.

In just a moment, Ye Qingtang was stunned and rooted to the ground as though she was struck by lightning. She widened her eyes in disbelief.

He…

What did he say?

Marry him??!!

Was he blind or was she deaf?!

Your Highness, isn’t this joke of yours is too big already!!!
