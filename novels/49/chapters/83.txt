Chapter 84: Flirting is a Skilled Task (3)

Your highness, your humble vassal can only do so much!

There was still no sound from the inner chambers.

Ye Qingtang was about to decline the offer and make a run for it, but just before she uttered her words, a deep, resonant voice broke the silence.

“Noted.”

“……” Mu Su felt like crying. Though silence is golden, now’s not the time for that!

Ye Qingtang’s mood had gotten worse as well.

“Miss Ye, may I suggest you reveal thy root?” Mu Su tried his best to keep the conversation going.

Ye Qingtang realized she had lost her chance to escape and could only bite her lip and play along.

Hovering halos converged on her open palm and at the center, a replica of her spirit root emerged.

“Your highness, this is Miss Ye’s new spirit root. Are there any peculiarities?” Mu Su prompted for an answer again.

Han Cangming furrowed his brow as he observed Ye Qingtang’s spirit root.

No one else knew better than him, that the demonic soul of the demon emperor’s heart was the one that facilitated the growth of her new spirit root.

Han Cangming replied after a moment of silence, “Its quality can be nurtured.”

The spirit root fostered by the demon emperor’s heart was fundamentally different from a natural one. That demonic soul did not possess a clear understanding on the nature of a spirit root, thus, though it did manage to grow a new one, it was not cultivated at all.

However, this allowed its quality to be improved as one cultivated his or her prowess. That is, with adequate cultivation, this red spirit root could transform into a blue one, akin to Ye Qingtang’s original, or beyond that to even indigo or violet.

Han Cangming’s deduction gave Ye Qingtang quite a shock.

Her new spirit root could improve in quality?!

The quality of a natural spirit root was a fixed attribute, determined since birth. Even with the aid of some of the world’s rarest treasures revered for fructifying a spirit root, the improvement in quality could be considered miniscule. Thus, having a spirit root which possessed the capability for a complete makeover was a phenomenon that was totally unheard of.

Ye Qingtang knew about the origin of her new spirit root and assumed there to be certain differences in its characteristics, but never did she expect such a mind-blowing difference. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Are there any other areas of interest?” Ye Qingtang was so fascinated by this new discovery that she totally let her guard down.

Since she could never put up a fight or escape if her secret was found out anyway.

Han Cangming replied stoically: “No.”

Mu Su was driven to the edge. It’s already a miracle for the girl to keep up with your conversation, why did your highness cut her off!

Please show some interest dammit!

“Your Highness, in order for Miss Ye to better nurture her new spirit root, what augments might you recommend?” Mu Su clearly gave his all to maintain their conversation.

Ye Qingtang was all ears for his answer.

“Jade Ganoderma, Exquisite Emeralds and Sky Dew. These three augments should work well.” Han Cangming articulated in a stoic tone. As concise as it is, the word count in his reply had increased nonetheless….

Mu Su was flabbergasted. Han Cangming had recommended three of the world’s rarest treasures. Other than their names, no common man could hope to come across them physically in a lifetime.

Your highness, may I beseech you to recommend something normal?

I know your highness always set your sights high, but can you please come down to earth this moment?

However, Ye Qingtang’s eyes sparkled with anticipation. She had not even heard of the two other names, but she did know a source for Sky Dew!

In her past, she came across it during her time at Xuan Ling’s Clan!
