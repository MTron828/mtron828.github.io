Chapter 2117: Sea Soul Chess (2)

The Sea King could tell that Ye Qingtang wasn’t a clone, neither was she a disguised Holy Lord. There was no way he couldn’t spot any of those antics.

Could it be that...

The Paragon Holy Lord really had been in seclusion?

Everyone was shocked when they overheard the conversation between the Sea King and Ye Qingtang. From what the Sea King just said, the Sea Clan’s divine item was still in the Temple of Paragon?

What was going on?!

Many leaders exchanged glances. They didn’t dare say anything in the Sea King’s presence. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Since you’re so concerned about the divine item, why don’t you go take a look at it?” Ye Qingtang said.

The Sea King didn’t answer right away. Ye Qingtang was calm and collected, no one could tell what was on her mind.

The Fox Demon and the other elders of the Temple of Paragon watched as Ye Qingtang reacted to the Sea King. They were originally worried that Ye Qingtang would perform poorly in front of everyone but they were relieved.

If one didn’t know the truth and just witnessed the scene, they would really think that Ye Qingtang was the Holy Lord.

“She’s formidable... She’s just an ordinary young lady from the First Domain and yet she’s able to deal with the Sea King of both domains. She’s doing well. If I hadn’t brought her here myself, I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.” Elder Bai watched everything using the water mirror. He somehow felt that Ye Qingtang was the Holy Lord herself.

Elder Hua smiled. “Elder Bai, you’re still suspecting she’s not our Holy Lord? You’ve said it yourself. She’s from the First Domain. Let’s not mention the Sea King, someone from the First Domain wouldn’t be able to handle just any guest in the main hall. Don’t you think that her demeanor and aura are exactly the same as our Holy Lord?”

Elder Bai’s brows furrowed. “We need to explore that possibility when we have a few more Guardians around.”

Elder Hua didn’t say anything more.

The atmosphere within the main hall seemed worrying.

Ye Qingtang didn’t say a word, and the Sea King remained quiet and everyone else in the main hall was waiting for them to speak. The entire main hall fell into a dead silence.

After a while, the Sea King spoke with raised brows. “We don’t have to rush things. It’s your birthday today, I must convey my well wishes first.”

Right after the Sea King said that huge waves suddenly appeared outside the palace. A huge chest rode on the waves and landed in the main hall.

“There is no need for you to do that. It’s the thought that counts,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Sea King replied, “I’m sure you’ll be satisfied with this gift.”

The Sea King then lifted one arm and the chest burst open. When the chest opened, there was a bestial roar coming from inside, as mist enshrouded the main hall. As the mist moved around, it formed into illusionary beasts that filled the main hall.

Everyone was shocked to see the illusionary beasts. Their gazes riveted to the chest. But the chest had already disappeared and a chessboard replaced it. It floated in mid-air.

The chessboard was a piece of art. The mist surrounding the chessboard continued evolving, as though there were countless beasts hidden among the mist. They could hear the groans of the beasts clearly.
