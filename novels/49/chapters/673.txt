Chapter 674: Nine Nights Dynasty (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After making all the preparations, Ye Qingtang changed into a male outfit and brought the dyed little white tiger and the Blood Moon Elder out. They bought a carriage in a small town on their way and were on their journey to the Nine Nights Dynasty.

The Nine Nights Dynasty had a vast territory. As one of the two big dynasties in this mainland, its territory was especially large.

The Ouyang family clan was the number one family clan of the Nine Nights Dynasty and was situated in the monarch city. The land in the monarch city of Nine Nights Dynasty was the largest city in the dynasty; it stretched a full hundred miles, and the spirit energy in that land was rich. Setting this land apart to build this city was initially intended by the first Emperor of Nine Nights Dynasty.

Apart from the royals of Nine Nights Dynasty, most of the various dominant forces were built up in the monarch city.

This included Ye Qingtang’s destination, Falling Sky Valley.

The dominant forces counter-balanced each other in the monarch city, and the Nine Nights Dynasty royal family did not dare to interfere too much.

Sitting in the carriage, Ye Qingtang looked out of the window while holding onto the jade pendant in her hands. The scene outside became increasingly familiar to her. She still vividly remembered this scene she saw when she fled into the Nine Nights Dynasty in her previous life. Afterward, she was accepted by Perfected Xuanchen as a disciple and entered Falling Sky Valley.

Although it was the same road, the situations in this life and the previous were completely different.

In this life, she would definitely not be as miserable!

“Holy Lady, we are reaching the Nine Night Dynasty’s monarch city very soon.” The Blood Moon Elder saw the boundless city wall not far away from the carriage window and turned around to inform Ye Qingtang.

“When we enter the monarch city, don’t call me Holy Lady anymore.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Uh… Then I’ll call you… Darling Ye?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang “endearingly.”

“…” Ye Qingtang’s lips froze. She was just this close to throwing the Blood Moon Elder out of the carriage.

“Call me Young Sir Ye. Remember, I am called Ye Chen now,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Oh oh… Young Sir Ye.” The Blood Moon Elder followed after Ye Qingtang’s words.

Ye Qingtang turned around and looked at little white tiger which had a lifeless expression. Ever since it was dyed another color, its eyes were filled with nothing but misery.

“Little White, don’t be so anxious. Your dyed color is only temporary.”

“…” The little white tiger quivered at the address of “little white.”

“F*ck you! Who allowed you to anyhow name me!” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“You’re little white! Your whole family is little white!” The little white tiger shouted in fury.

Ye Qingtang rubbed her chin as she looked at the orange fur that stood all over the little white tiger’s body. “Then I’ll call you Little Orange?”

“You’re little! Your whole family is little!”

The Blood Moon Elder took a glance of the little white tiger and curled his lips secretly.

Does it still think it is very big?

Ye Qingtang did not know whether to laugh or cry as she looked at the rebelling little white tiger. “Little White, you must not open your mouth so casually anymore once we enter the monarch city. Otherwise, if people find out that you’re not an ordinary tiger, I dare not guarantee anything.”

The little white tiger froze for a moment, and a serious expression appeared on its face. “Don’t worry. I said that I would guarantee your safety.”

“…” Why did it become that it was protecting her? A laugh escaped her lips as she shook her head.

Just as Ye Qingtang chuckled, the carriage had already arrived at the city gates of the monarch city. As the monarch city of the Nine Nights Dynasty, which was also a territory of the dominant forces, the guards at the city gates were extremely strict with the entry and exit of people. Non-citizens of the monarch city and ordinary people were not allowed to enter or leave the city as they wished…

Immediately, the soldiers at the city gate stopped the carriage that Ye Qingtang and the rest were in.
