Chapter 157: Affection (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After a night of packing, Ye Qingtang did not prepare too many things.

She only packed some food and clothes to change in. As for the elixirs and whatnot, she still had some in her space ring, and adding on the antidotes that Qin Huan sent, it was enough to use.

This morning, Ye Qingtang was done packing and ready to head to the gathering point.

When she just left the door, she suddenly saw a complicated-looking Yun Shu standing below a tree not far away who was looking down with a frown as though he was troubled.

“Senior Brother Yun?” Ye Qingtang walked up curiously.

Upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s voice, Yun Shu suddenly returned to his senses, and a trace of fluster could be seen on his face.

“Junior… Junior Sister Ye, good morning,” Yun Shu sounded rather stiff.

“Is Senior Brother Yun waiting for me to head to the warden’s lesson together?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Yun Shu stunned for a moment then finally muttered a stiff-sounding “yes”.

“I’m afraid that won’t be possible. I am going to do a rewarded mission with other senior brothers and sisters and will not be back until about half a month later. You don’t have to wait for me in this half a month,” Ye Qingtang said with a laugh as she forgot to tell Yun Shu about it yesterday.

Yun Shu could not help but look surprised when he heard that Ye Qingtang was going on a rewarded mission.

“Rewarded mission? You really went there to take on a mission that day, and you still tried to sweet-talk me.” Yun Shu frowned as he recalled how Ye Qingtang said she was going to the Rewards Pavilion the other day. Though there was blame in his tone, it was more of worry.

“Rest assured, Senior Brother Yun. I’m only there to experience it this time. There are still a few other senior brothers together with me. Don’t worry,” Ye Qingtang chuckled. In both her previous and current life, Yun Shu was like her brother, and his nagging made her feel exceptionally warm.

“Forget it, I can’t control you anyway. You should be more careful. If there are any problems, don’t rush into it so hurriedly. Listen to the guidance from other senior brothers,” Yun Shu sighed as he understood that based on Ye Qingtang’s character, she was not someone who would change her mind just because of his nagging.

“Okay! I will remember Senior Brother Yun’s words by heart.” Ye Qingtang laughed in reply.

Yun Shu took a look at her, and all his emotions that he gathered were completely gone after hearing Ye Qingtang’s sudden news. Considering that Ye Qingtang was right about to go on a mission and that some things were inconvenient to be said in case she becomes distracted during the mission, he suppressed everything in his heart.

Without saying anything more, Yun Shu took out a few bottles of elixirs from his arms and stuffed them into Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“These are elixirs that I brought from my family clan. Perhaps, there will be a use for them.” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang looked at her hand full of elixirs, and a warm smile surged in her eyes.

“It is still Senior Brother Yun who dotes on me,” Ye Qingtang chuckled. Sparing with the corny affection, she kept the bottles swiftly. Anyway, whatever good things that she obtained in the future, there would always be a share for Yun Shu, and there was no need to regard him as an outsider.

Yun Shu really did not know how to react to her teasing and hurried her to get moving after nagging a few more times.

Watching Ye Qingtang’s disappearing further away, Yun Shu shook his head with a bitter smile. However, he did not notice that not far away, Su Wan stood outside the door from some time ago and witnessed everything between Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu. Jealousy and hatred filled that pair of gentle-looking eyes.

“Senior Brother Yun,” Su Wan said gently after hiding away all her emotion.

Yun Shu, who was preparing to leave, suddenly turned around and looked confusedly at a rather foreign-looking Su Wan upon hearing a voice.

“This junior sister?”

Su Wan quietly took a deep breath. Stepping forward, she greeted gently, “Senior Brother Yun, my name is Su Wan.”

“So it’s Junior Sister Su,” Yun Shu replied kindly.

“Is Senior Brother Yun going to listen to class?”

“Yes.”

“I am heading there as well. If you don’t mind, can we go together?” Su Wan looked up with endless affection in her soft eyes.

Ye Qingtang, what right do you have to fight with me!
