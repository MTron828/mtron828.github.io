Chapter 1950: Betrayal (3)

Although Ming Di had completely defeated those first two Ancient You Clan youths, they were now in the enemy’s territory and Ye Qingtang was not confident in winning. It was likely that the Ancient You Clan might have some hidden trump card.

The Ancient You Clan warden was stunned.

What was going on?

Why did the Holy Lord suddenly arrive to rescue the Jiang family members?

“Don’t let them flee!” The warden roared.

Although the elders had instructed them not to engage the Temple of Shadows for the moment, the Holy Lord had come all this way just to snatch their target. How could they endure such an insult?

At the warden’s command, the youth gave chase.

“Yo, that punk dares to chase after us?” Ming Di noted the youth pursuing them. He immediately put Ye Qingtang and the others down before turning around to battle him.

The Domain Monarch was astounded. He stared at Ye Qingtang, who was still wearing the golden mask.

He did not remember any connections between the Jiang family and the Temple of Shadows. Why would the Holy Lord...

But there was no time for the Domain Monarch to ask further questions. He gazed worriedly at Ming Di, who was getting ready to face their enemy.

Ming Di landed right in front of the youth, blocking his way. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“You are just a stupid demon dragon. Get out of my way or I will skin you alive.” The youth snorted impatiently.

Narrowing its eyes, Ming Di swung its tail into that arrogant youth, turning him into a mass of pulverized flesh.

“Skin me alive? So scary...” Ming Di grinned at the messy remains of the youth.

Domain Monarch was dumbfounded by the entire scene.

Uh... This Ming Di was indeed as powerful as the legends described!

Before the Domain Monarch could fully comprehend it all, the hidden ancient clan members all rushed out—they were full of confidence after witnessing Ming Di’s kill.

The Domain Monarch stared at the sudden appearance of those ancient clan members, all of whom looked so familiar.

“...”

When did this bunch of people ally themselves with the Temple of Shadows?

“The Holy Lord is great. It was right of you to teach that Ancient You Clan a lesson.” The ancient clan folks happily praised Ye Qingtang’s wonderful accomplishment.

Ye You never expected there to be so many people hidden on the outside. All the hairs at the back of her neck stood up when she saw that massive demon dragon smash the Ancient You Clan youth to certain death.

It must be pointed out that Ye You had personally witnessed just how powerful that youth was. He could wipe out an entire ancient clan all by himself.

But...

He had been turned into meat paste with just the swing of a tail?

Ye You shuddered. Together, she and Jiang Qin hurried back to the Ancient You Clan camp.

But Ye Qingtang immediately noticed their attempt to flee. Reaching out, she grabbed those two and hauled them back, tossing them by the feet of the Domain Monarch.

However, no one had the time to think of how to deal with them now.

The warden remained impassive as he watched that youth die. He just narrowed his eyes.

“The Temple of Shadows is indeed powerful. But since you guys insisted on coming to meet your deaths, don’t blame us for being merciless.”

Right after the warden spoke, several youths appeared before him.

Ye Qingtang scanned those youths and realized that all of them possessed an aura even stronger than those first three killed by Ming Di. As expected, the Ancient You Clan still possessed quite a number of such formidable youths.

“Ming Di,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Ha, understood.” The battle-hungry blood in Ming Di’s body started to churn and rage. It turned toward those youths and taunted, “Oi, don’t come one by one. All of you can attack me at the same time.”
