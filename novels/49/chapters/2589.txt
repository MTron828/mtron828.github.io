Gradually, Ye Qingtang could sense that her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was resisting her. It wanted to tum back the way it came and did not want to waste time here.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Could it be that even the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline could not devour the power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao

Ye Qingtang did not think too much and let the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline radiate an extremely overbearing engulfing power.

As this power erupted near her heart, Ye Qingtang’s Heart of Heavenly Dao finally moved.

The Heart of Heavenly Dao, which was still sealed, was awakened by the engulfing power radiated by the Heavenly Demon Bloodline. It seemed to instinctively burst out with a rich Dao power.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang’s face turned pale and a stream of blood trickled down the corner of her lips.

In her current state, Ye Qingtang could not withstand too much of the dao power emitted by the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

It was unlike the power of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline, which was originally a part of Ye Qingtang’s body. Therefore, no matter how domineering and powerful the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was, it would not harm Ye Qingtang. However, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was different. The

great dao power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was not part of Ye Qingtang. Therefore, Ye Qingtang could not endure it too much.

However, Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth and endured it. She must not give up at this critical juncture or all her efforts would be for naught.

“Attack!”

Acold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she gave the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline an order.

However, what surprised Ye Qingtang was that this time, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline did not comply. Instead, it paced around the Heart of the Heavenly Dao very cautiously. It did not attack nor retreat.

In the next second, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline near her heart increased and became more intense. As the intensity of the Heavenly Demon Bloodlines increased, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao also had a defensive reaction, wanting to isolate the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

At this moment, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had completely surrounded the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. It was like a beast lying dormant, waiting for its prey to make a mistake and deliver a fatal blow.

“Don’t disappoint me…”

Ye Qingtang muttered as she observed the situation in her body.

As long as the Heavenly Demon Bloodline swallowed all the dao power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline would undergo a qualitative leap again and might even produce an even greater mutation. Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang could completely transform the great dao

power into her own. It would be like killing two birds with one stone.

In the next second, the power of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline erupted with a covetous and overbearing engulfing energy, instantly swallowing the entire core of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

Fortunately, the Heavenly Demon Bloodline knew its limits. It only devoured the defensive dao power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao, all the while remaining conscious of Ye Qingtang’s heart, and did not injure it at all. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

After about half an hour later, Ye Qingtang saw that the Heavenly Demon Bloodline had completely devoured a portion of the dao power.

However, the actions of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline seemed to have completely enraged the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

Ye Qingtang’s body seemed to have become a huge battlefield, with the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline and the Heart of the Heavenly Dao as the two main opposing forces.

Dumbstruck, Ye Qingtang could only watch on as the battle raged inside her body between the two sides. This was a battle between two mighty kings.

‘The power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was too domineering, The second wave of power released by the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was absorbed by the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline once more..
