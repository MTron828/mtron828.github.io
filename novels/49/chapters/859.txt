Chapter 860 I Will Not Let You Off Even If I Become A Ghost

Ye Qingtang, once again, swore to the heavens that she did not want to put on an act with this person ever again in her life.

If Ling Yan personally came to act with her, the effect… should not be like what it was right now.

“Even if it’s an imitation, it’s already very scary. I never thought that the Supreme Academy would actually have such a figure like you. I made an error of judgment… Ye Qingtang, you can strike! It’s useless to talk so much!” The midget shouted sternly.

Useless to talk so much? From the start to now, she only said a total of four words: “It’s me” and “An imitation”.

“Full of bullsh*t!” She shouted.

Ye Qingtang frowned immediately and swept her sword across horizontally.

In a flash, a frightening sword gleam slashed towards the midget.

The midget had a confused expression. There should not be “full of bullshit” in Ye Qingtang’s lines… Could it be that she improvised it…

As the sword gleam was slashed, the midget pointed a finger out and wanted to block it instinctively. However, he suddenly recalled his current role.

“Ah…”

Before the sword gleam attacked the midget, he was already flung out.

In the Shun Tian Formation, the three Arcane Supremacies in the Supreme Academy exchanged a look. What exactly happened?

Very quickly, the midget jumped up from the ground and glared at Ye Qingtang furiously. “Good… I admit that I am not your opponent, but don’t be too excited just yet. I cultivated an extremely frightening evil cultivation technique, and I will slay you right here today!”

Ye Qingtang could not hold herself back from rolling her eyes at the midget. Even if it was a demonic cult from the unorthodox, they would not call the techniques they cultivated as evil cultivation techniques would they…

Almost instantly, the midget turned into black fog, and a berserk laugh sounded from it.

The black fog’s speed was extremely fast, and it enveloped Ye Qingtang in it instantly. In a split second, endless spirit energy escaped into the surroundings.

Noticing the situation, the three Arcane Supremacies in the Shun Tian Formation had solemn expressions. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“That is… the Deceased Soul Technique?!”

“It’s said that the Deceased Soul Technique can absorb the spirit energy of others by force and turn it to be used by the user!”

“Looking at the method he executed the technique, it seems to really be similar to that of the Deceased Soul Technique…”

Wild laughter erupted from the black fog. “Hahaha, you three are pretty observant. You all actually know the Deceased Soul Technique that I cultivated!”

In the black fog, Ye Qingtang’s brows were tightly furrowed, and she wore a pained expression.

“Senior sister, the Deceased Soul Technique can be restrained with fire!” A lady looked at Ye Qingtang and said hurriedly.

The moment she said that, golden flames started burning around Ye Qingtang.

As the flames appeared, the three Arcane Supremacies in the Shun Tian Formation were astonished. The flames on Ye Qingtang’s body were actually full of the aura of destruction like an Extraordinary Flame!

“It’s an Extraordinary Flame…”

“And looking at this Extraordinary Flame’s grade, it does not seem low…”

“Could it be that she really is a senior sister from our Supreme Academy from a few batches earlier?”

The three Arcane Supremacies in the Shun Tian Formation were bridled with confusion.

However, before they could ponder anymore, a torturous scream rang from the black fog.

“You… You… are really powerful… I will not… let you off… even if I become a ghost…”

After saying that, the black fog turned into black sand and scattered all over the ground. Subsequently, the black sand sunk into the ground without a sound and disappeared completely.

Ye Qingtang shook her head and kept her sword back into the sheath with a sharp sound. She looked at the three Arcane Supremacies in the Shun Tian Formation and walked towards it with great strides.
