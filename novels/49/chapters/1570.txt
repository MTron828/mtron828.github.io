1571 Oh My 4

Xie Wushang’s gaze sharpened immediately when she noticed Ye Qingtang’s beautiful face.

“You didn’t accept me last time because of your wife. Now, is it because of this little lover beside you? Great... Since that’s the case, I will kill her and see if there’s still anyone who can stand between you and me!” Xie Wushang had a murderous glare, and she directly aimed a blow at Ye Qingtang!

“...” Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded.

How did she become Jiang Yu’s little lover?

Ye Qingtang’s face was ash-white as she looked at the murderous air surrounding Xie Wushang and the powerful aura that filled the air.

“Madam Founder, you’re mistaken! I am not the Domain Monarch Founder’s lover. I am just a clan member of the Jiang Family!” Ye Qingtang said hurriedly, seeing that she was about to be struck dead by the jealous Xie Wushang.

The words ‘Madam Founder’ extinguished the murderous air around Xie Wushang immediately. She retracted her hand abruptly and smiled at Ye Qingtang whom she wanted to kill just a while ago.

“...” Jiang Yu’s face darkened further.

Ye Qingtang broke out in cold sweat out of fear.

Sorry, Domain Monarch Founder.

She could not be blamed. It was really because Xie Wushang was too powerful.

He who understood the times was a wise man...

“Little girl, you are a good talker. Are you really his descendant?” Xie Wushang spoke.

“Yes, I am indeed a descendant of the Jiang Family.” Ye Qingtang immediately disassociated herself from Jiang Yu.

She would die really wrongfully if she was killed for being viewed as Jiang Yu’s lover. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xie Wushang was still a little doubtful, and she looked at Jiang Yu.

She knew that Jiang Yu would never lie about such matters. Otherwise, he would not have rejected her repeatedly over these years.

“That’s right,” Jiang Yu said.

Xie Wushang chuckled immediately and looked at Ye Qingtang with a friendlier attitude. Perhaps the address of ‘Madam Founder’ was really too much to her liking.

“There will only be one person as my wife in my life. Xie Wushang, there is no possibility between us,” Jiang Yu said coldly.

Xie Wushang’s expression darkened in just a moment.

“Jiang Yu, I’ve pursued you for so many years, but you hugged your dead wife and kneeled in the Land of Infinite Demons for so many years. Am I not better than a dead woman?!” Xie Wushang’s expression was dark to the extreme.

Xie Wushang was endowed with great talents and was a known figure in the Second Domain. She had a beautiful appearance, and plenty of people did all they could to gain her favor. She was a delicate treasure cherished by the masses, but she compromised in every possible way when it came to Jiang Yu. She had pursued him for ten thousand years, yet he wasn’t even willing to spare her an eye?

“Jiang Yu, my patience is limited. I’ll give you one more chance. Are you willing to be with me?” Xie Wushang narrowed her eyes as a trace of murderous intent emerged in her eyes. The spirit energy around her gradually intensified, and an invisible pressure diffused in the air.

The surrounding elders and disciples who followed over were truly dumbfounded. Why didn’t they expect this Xie Wushang and their Domain Monarch Founder to have such a relationship?

Watching the formidable Xie Wushang release her pressure gradually, everyone in the Jiang Family could not help but break out in a cold sweat.

Jiang Yu’s complexion did not seem well either, but he showed no signs of giving in.

“Jiang Yu, I’m asking you one last time. Are you willing to be with me? If you reject me again, I won’t let you be with anyone else in the future even if that means killing you,” Xie Wushang said.
