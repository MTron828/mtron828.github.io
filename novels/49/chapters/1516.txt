Chapter 1517 Absolute Death 2

After walking for about ten meters, Ye Qingtang suddenly stopped and turned back. The three monsters also stopped. They lifted up their heads and opened their round eyes to stare at her in a silly way.“...” Ye Qingtang suddenly felt that they really treated her as the same kind of creature.

The three monsters shook their heads to look at Ye Qingtang. They used their noses to sniff her. The smell of blood was strong and familiar, but beneath the blood, they smelled something that was even more familiar; the smell belonged to the same type of creature as them.

“Oink...” The largest monster used its giant nose to push Ye Qingtang’s back as she did not walk forward anymore.

Though it did not use much strength, the force from a ten-meter tall monster almost pushed Ye Qingtang to the ground.

The monster was asking her to walk forward...

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly. She had complicated emotions as she stared at the monsters who stood in a line behind her.

Ye Qingtang was content with her situation when she saw the disciples of the Jiang Family with their stomachs ripped open. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Ye Qingtang could not help but choose to carry on walking. She felt lucky that her body was stained with the big demon’s blood and that she did not have time to wash it away. Otherwise, she would end up in the same situation as the disciples of the Jiang Family.

After walking forward for a while, Ye Qingtang saw many bones around her. These people were dead for more than a thousand years. She could see mountain ridges in front of her, but they looked dim now.

Though Ye Qingtang did not see other living creatures, she could sense many pairs of eyes staring at her in the dark.

Is it because of the three monsters?

That’s why those creatures in the dark didn’t come out?

Ye Qingtang was confused as she glanced at the three monsters following behind her.

The little white tiger in her arms also glanced around. It suddenly seemed to recall something and said, “These three are the demonic bears...”

“Demonic Bear?” Ye Qingtang was slightly shocked when she heard the name.

The Demonic Bear was a type of demon. Ye Qingtang heard about them in her previous life that they were malicious and liked to consume all types of creatures. However, they only ate their prey when they were still alive. Once the prey died, the Demonic Bears would abandon them.

According to the legends, the Demonic Bear was the most loyal servant of the Demons. They had huge strength and thick skin, and they would become big demons after living for a hundred thousand years.

They were extremely ferocious but had low intelligence. They were always loyal servants.

Ye Qingtang looked at the three Demonic Bears behind her. Based on their sizes, they were still young—maybe only about ten thousand years old. The youngest might only be a few thousand years old.

The Demonic Bear would undergo a huge change when it reached thirty thousand years. Its body would increase by ten times in size. This change would happen again at fifty, eighty, and a hundred thousand years. Eventually, it would become a big demon that could smash half of a mainland with one paw.

Ye Qingtang looked at the three “silly and honest” Demonic Bears. There were some differences between them and the drawings, but she could not tell exactly.

Ye Qingtang was still at the border of the forbidden land. It was definitely not the most dangerous place, but the bones that were scattered on the ground revealed how many people had died here.

The strange black strings in the fog terrified Ye Qingtang. She could not even tell what the origin of the black strings was. She could only remember the human skin that was filled up by the black strings...
