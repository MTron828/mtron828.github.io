Chapter 2729: Returning To Her Era (7)

That day, the lady in green had made a deal with Ye Qingtang that she could extract all the Heavenly Dao energy from Ye Qingtang’s heart.

But now, Ye Qingtang did not need such a deal.

“I really did not expect you to improve to such an extent in just a few days… Could it be that you absorbed the power in your heart yourself?” The lady in green was not afraid of Ye Qingtang at all.

“You don’t need to know the details,” Ye Qingtang said expressionlessly.

“Ha, things are indeed different now. However, how can it be so easy for you to kill me?” The lady in green stared at Ye Qingtang. As she spoke, a lotus flower pattern appeared on her forehead.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when she saw the lotus flower design on the woman’s forehead.

“High Monk?!”

Ye Qingtang was extremely shocked.

When she was in a memory in the Fourth Domain’s legacy realm, Ye Qingtang had witnessed how the High Monk chose to die so that he would have the chance to reincarnate. His body dissipated but his soul turned into a lotus flower seed and fled somewhere.

All along, Ye Qingtang had been extremely puzzled. Who did the High Monk reincarnate into…

Ye Qingtang did not expect that this woman in green was the reincarnation of the High Monk!

“Oh right…”

Ye Qingtang stared at the lady in green and frowned. Actually, Ye Qingtang knew from the beginning that this lady in green was the reincarnation of a True God…

However, this woman in green had such a vicious character and was also a woman. Therefore, Ye Qingtang never considered the possibility that she might be the reincarnation of the High Monk.

“What High Monk?”

The lady in green asked Ye Qingtang.

“Leave.”

Ye Qingtang’s aura dissipated.

“Oh?”

The woman in green had a strange expression. “Didn’t you want to kill me?”

“I’ve changed my mind,” Ye Qingtang said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ye Qingtang was full of admiration for an existence like the High Monk. He spent a lot of effort to revive all the living beings in the Fourth Domain capital and even fought till the last moment. He was also the best friend of the Silver Star Holy Lord. How could Ye Qingtang attack the High Monk’s reincarnation?

“Tell me why.” The woman in green was puzzled.

Ye Qingtang stared at the lady in green and said expressionlessly, “You should know that you are the reincarnation of a True God.”

“Heh, it’s because of that… So you’re afraid?” The corners of the woman’s lips curled up slightly.

“It’s not that I’m afraid. I just hope that you won’t disgrace your previous self,” Ye Qingtang said.

“What are you saying?” The woman in green frowned. Although she had been awakened, she did not know much about her previous life. Why did Ye Qingtang talk about her previous life?

“You want to know the truth?!” Ye Qingtang disappeared from where she was and came to the woman in green’s side. Without giving the woman any chance to move, Ye Qingtang grabbed her shoulders and locked eyes with her.

Looking at the scene in Ye Qingtang’s eyes, the green-robed woman’s initial disdain and chilliness turned into shock and disbelief.

“This… I am…” The lady in green stared at Ye Qingtang in shock.

In the Fourth Domain, the lotus flower formed by the fallen High Monk was identical to her divine mark…

The woman in green never expected that in her previous life, she would be the Fourth Domain’s High Monk.
