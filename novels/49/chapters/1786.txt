Ye Qingtang’s eyes widened as she saw the approaching Hu. She could feel that the thing Hu had in his arms was actually the Deity Ocean!

Ye Qingtang felt like her head was about to explode. The three elite tribes were so powerful. Wasn’t the eastern camp being too stubborn? How did they dare steal the Deity Ocean from right under their noses?

Even if that were the case, Ye Qingtang knew that all the demons were obsessed with the Deity Ocean. All the tribes, regardless of their strength, were swarming into battle. But as far as Ye Qingtang was concerned, this gamble was too risky.

She had no intention of participating in this battle. With her skill, she would be pretty decent among the youth in the First Mainland but among these Emperor level demons, she was nothing.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. She was about to stick her head back in and avoid this deathly situation when Hu who was running away frantically spotted her.

Hu, who was being chased all the way by the Great General of the three elite tribes, was running for his life, but the distance between him and the Great Generals were closing and his heart was full of panic.

But the moment he spotted Ye Qingtang, his eyes lit up slightly and a hint of a smile appeared at the corner of his lips.

It was impossible for him to shake off the demons chasing him but now that he had the Deity Ocean with him, he wasn’t going to give it up so easily.

Ye Qingtang’s appearance gave him a chance to turn the tables.

When she saw his smile, Ye Qingtang felt a sense of foreboding. Before she could even respond, Hu was flying straight toward her hiding place.

As Hu flew past her, he sneakily slung the Deity Ocean towards Ye Qingtang.

He moved extremely quickly and this went undetected. After throwing the Deity Ocean to her, he used his energy to create a trial of blue light mimicking the Deity Ocean and continued flying.

In an instant, countless demons chasing Hu flew by Ye Qingtang. These demons had no idea that Hu had thrown it to Ye Qingtang, who was hiding in the dark, and continued chasing after Hu, thinking that he still had the Deity Ocean.

Ye Qingtang looked on as Hu’s sleight of hand fooled the other demons. She turned pale as she looked at the roaring Great Generals.

Once the demons’ footsteps had faded, she lowered her head. Wasn’t the thing in her arms the Deity Ocean all the tribes were fighting tooth-and-nail for?

What the hell!

How had it gotten into her arms?! Ye Qingtang cursed Hu silently in her heart.

All she wanted to do was to survive this battle silently. Why did this darned thing have to land in her hands?

Recalling Hu’s cautious expression before he flew off, he must have meant for her to hide the Deity Ocean well.

Ye Qingtang wanted to cry.

This Deity Ocean was going to be the death of her. She understood how badly the demons wanted the Deity Ocean, but...

Hu! You gave this to the wrong person!

Ye Qingtang’s strength was less than peanuts in the eyes of these demons. She would get caught the moment she left the cave. She could forget about even escaping.

At this moment, the Deity Ocean was like a hot potato. She could neither throw it away nor keep it with her. She wanted to try stuffing the Deity Ocean into her space ring but...
