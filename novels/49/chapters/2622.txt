Chapter 2623 Fighting the Skies (4)

“Sister Ye Yue, I don’t see anything either,” Feng Wuyin said as well. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Ye Qingtang’s expression became puzzled as she heard this.

“What on earth is happening…” she muttered.

How was it possible that she was the only one who could see such a huge figure and no one else could see it?

The huge figure soon opened its eyes. Its eyes were blood red and seemed to hold the universe in them as it looked down gravely at the Heavenly Emperor.

In an instant, the shadowy figure raised its eyes and the Calamity of Wrath fell all around them. A bolt of blood-red lightning as thick as a hundred-year-old tree shot straight towards the Heavenly Emperor.

“Boom, boom, boom!!!”

Explosive sounds shook the skies as the bolt of lightning landed squarely on the Heavenly Emperor. The bright light around the Heavenly Emperor faded a little.

The Heavenly Emperor’s lips curled into a smile as he said, “Fighting with the skies… how fun.”

Back in the Feng Family arena, Ye Qingtang’s expression was getting stranger and stranger. She could clearly see the shadowy figure using its eyes to control the Calamity of Wrath as it attacked the Heavenly Emperor!

“What’s happening?” She could no longer understand what was happening.

Even as she observed the people around her carefully, she realized that none of them seemed to be able to see the shadowy figure in the sky. Their eyes were all fixated on the Heavenly Emperor.

“Could it be that…”

She had a sudden thought.

Originally she hadn’t noticed the shadowy figure. It was only after the great dao power filled her with strength that she was able to see

it.

So she put away the power within her.

Her snow-white hair reverted to normal and her eyes went back to normal as well.

She looked up at the skies again after putting the great dao power away.

What she saw stunned her.

The huge shadowy figure had disappeared and the only thing left in her sight was the Calamity of Wrath. There was no one there at

all!

Without thinking any further, she quickly let the great dao power wash over her again and looked up at the sky again.

“This…”

Her brows furrowed deeply.

The shadowy figure with blood-red eyes had reappeared once again!

She finally understood what was happening.

As long as she had the great dao power within her, she would be able to see things that she couldn’t normally see, like the shadowy figure.

She had no idea if the Heavenly Emperor could see the shadowy figure but she was certain that the Feng Family members and the other strong practitioners around them could not see the shadowy figure.

If the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline had not devoured the Heart of the Heavenly Dao, she wouldn’t have been able to tell if anything was strange at all and wouldn’t be able to see the huge shadowy figure with its blood-red eye containing the universe.

As Ye Qingtang looked at the huge figure, the blood-red eyes seemed to notice something was amiss and it slowly moved to look at Ye Qingtang. As soon as the eyes fell on her, her pupils suddenly shrank as every part of her body started shaking. A primal fear gripped her heart and she almost fell from the air.
