Zhou Xuan looked at Ye Qingtang with a smile. There seemed to not be any evil intentions on his face, but there was a vicious look in his smiling eyes. He leaned forward slightly and whispered into Ye Qingtang’s ears.

“Previously, Junior Sister Ye received three moves from my brother, Zhou Qu, on the arena, and I thought that you must be very skilled. Wouldn’t it be a pity if you went on normal missions? Thus, this time… I hope that Junior Sister Ye will really put your best performance in the mission.” Zhou Xuan smiled very kindly, but every word he said emitted a frightening sense of danger.

Ye Qingtang scoffed in her heard, though she did not show any expressions on her face. “Please take care of me, Senior Brother Zhou.”

Zhou Xuan laughed. “Of course.” Then he stood straight and said, “I still have some matters to settle. I will take a leave first.”

Then, Zhou Xuan turned around and left after bidding the warden goodbye. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

From the start to the end, Zhou Xuan did not mention anything regarding the mission to Ye Qingtang.

All the missions were fixed, and each team needed to discuss the contents of the mission by themselves. Yun Shu was originally worried about Ye Qingtang and wanted to check on her but was held back by Su Wan, who used the reason that they had to discuss the mission.

Ye Qingtang smiled faintly as she looked at how everyone was gathered together. Then, she left and mentally prepared for Zhou Xuan’s ‘accident.’

But before Ye Qingtang returned to her room, she saw Qin Huan standing outside the dorm with an anxious expression.

The moment Qin Huan saw Ye Qingtang, he hurriedly ran up to her.

“Junior Sister Ye, there’s something I need to tell you. Be careful these few days, someone wants to harm you…” Qin Huan said hurriedly.

Ye Qingtang replied, “Are you talking about Zhou Xuan?”

Qin Huan was taken aback. “How do you know? That Zhou Xuan is Zhou Qu’s older brother. He might already know that you injured Zhou Qu the other time. When I was taking on a mission earlier, I heard that Zhou Xuan seemed to have looked for your teaching warden to add you into his sect mission. You must be careful. Zhou Xuan is not like Zhou Qu. He is extremely insidious.”

Ye Qingtang laughed. “He has already looked for me, and the warden had placed me in his team as well. In a few days, I will have to go on a mission together with him.”

Qin Huan was stunned when he heard Ye Qingtang. His expression changed, and he muttered a curse.

“I knew that bastard Zhou Xuan was sinister. I didn’t think that he would take action so quickly. You must be more careful. Zhou Xuan has many means and tricks. He does not dare to do anything to you in the sect, but using this mission, he will definitely not let you off easily. I think… how about you find an excuse to reject this mission?” Qin Huan could not help but be worried about Ye Qingtang. In the outer sect, Zhou Xuan’s abilities were not considered weak. Although Qin Huan knew that Ye Qingtang was skilled, it was still too much danger for Ye Qingtang to go on a mission together with such an insidious person like Zhou Xuan.

“How can a sect mission be rejected?” Ye Qingtang replied.

Qin Huan’s shoulders slumped down immediately.

Sect missions were missions that must be done. After being appointed a sect mission, one must proceed to complete it, and there was simply no way of rejecting it.

“How about… I’ll ask Senior Brother Gu to talk to Zhou Xuan?” Qin Huan suggested. Gu Yanqiu had some status amongst the outer sect disciples, and, perhaps, he might be able to restrain Zhou Xuan.

“I’ll go look for Senior Brother Gu now. Don’t worry, Junior Sister Ye.” Then, he immediately turned around and sprinted away without waiting for Ye Qingtang’s reply.
