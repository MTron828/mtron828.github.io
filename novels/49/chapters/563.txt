Chapter 564 As Beautiful As A Flower (3)

In Ye Qingtang’s previous life when she just met Ouyang Qian, she did not find anything bad about her. Moreover, Ouyang Qian cared for her, giving her a sense of warmth despite having been chased for her life by everyone. In return, she treated Ouyang Qian as her best friend.

But Ye Qingtang never expected that Ouyang Qian had already discovered her Heart of the Demon God from a long time ago, and all her kindness was merely feigned civility while she harbored evil intentions.

Ouyang Qian drugged her eventually, and if not for her Eldest Senior Brother who rushed over in time, Ye Qingtang would have definitely died without a doubt!

“Ouyang Qian… I never thought that we would meet again.” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up and formed into an evil smile.

Seeing Ye Qingtang, a chill ran down the Blood Moon Elder’s spine. Could it be that she wanted to do something again…

“Miss, this is only an owner-less mystic realm of a small sect. There’s no need for us to risk rushing from the Nine Nights Dynasty to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty, right?” A male from the Ouyang family looked at Ouyang Qian in confusion.

After hearing that, a sneer appeared on Ouyang Qian’s petite face. “There’s originally no need, but… I don’t know who let out news that there is an infant fiendcelestial beast in this mystic realm, and I saw Falling Sky Valley disciples here as well. The news definitely is not fake.”

“Miss, I also know about this news, but… a fiendcelestial beast is reproduced from the ancient era and possesses both the bloodline of celestial beasts as well as fiend beasts. Moreover, it is said to be an infant. I think it is not very possible.”

“That may not be true. There’s no smoke without fire. If the Ouyang family can obtain the fiendcelestial beast…”

The people from the Ouyang family had their own opinions over the matter of the fiendcelestial beast.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder exchanged a look, and a strange expression emerged in both their eyes.

The supposed ‘fiendcelestial beast’ was merely a general term. It referred to the descendant of a fiend beast and a celestial beast from the ancient generation. Its bloodline was half celestial beast and half fiend beast, thus the name fiendcelestial beast. People from older generations called it a slaughter weapon as its skills were extraordinary since birth.

However, on this mainland where spirit energy was so thin, how would a fiendcelestial beast exist and even appear in Xuanling Sect’s mystic realm?

Ye Qingtang was in deep thought. She had never heard of anyone who obtained a fiendcelestial beast in her previous life…

“Holy Lady, there’s actually a fiendcelestial beast in this mystic realm? Why do I not believe it?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang.

Not mentioning the Blood Moon Elder, even Ye Qingtang did not believe it as well.

“Regardless of whether a fiendcelestial beast exists in the mystic realm, I will still enter the mystic realm.” Ye Qingtang mumbled as she committed herself to her goal for this trip.

Whether or not this mystic realm really had a fiendcelestial beast had nothing to do with Ye Qingtang. Her goal of entering the mystic realm was only to obtain the Black Heaven Water.

“Look.”

Suddenly, a male from the Ouyang family pointed at the Blood Moon Elder not far away. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

After hearing that, everyone from the Ouyang family including Ouyang Qian looked at the Blood Moon Elder who was “dressed gorgeously.”

“The girls from this Formidable Heavens Dynasty are really ugly,” that male from the Ouyang family said with a frown, clearly shocked by the Blood Moon Elder’s face that was “as fair as a flower.”

The fact there was actually such a hideous girl on this world completely shook up his outlooks.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder: …

Then you are ugly! All your ancestors are ugly!

The other people from the Ouyang family snickered as well. Even though they did not say anything further, the sarcasm and laughter in their eyes evidently expressed their feelings.

Before long, the Ouyang family members looked away and walked into the mountain forest directly.
