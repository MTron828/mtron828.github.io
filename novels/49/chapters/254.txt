Qin Huan was really a headache now.

Both Zhou Qu and Zhou Xuan were stingy people. Zhou Xuan always made things difficult for Ye Qingtang as he tried to take revenge for Zhou Qu. Now that Zhou Xuan died, Zhou Qu definitely resented Ye Qingtang.

Zhou Qu stared cruelly at Ye Qingtang. He blamed Ye Qingtang for Zhou Xuan’s death after knowing Zhou Xuan died in a mission. Fighting between disciples was prohibited by the sect. If not because of that, he would have found trouble with Ye Qingtang much earlier.

“Senior Brother Dai, she is the new disciple this year, not the top one thousand in the outer sect.” Zhou Qu hid his malice and explained to Dai Changming.

Dai Changming frowned and gave a fierce look to Ye Qingtang. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Qin Huan, what do you want?” Dai Changming asked Qin Huan directly as he did not even bother to question Ye Qingtang.

Qin Huan was still figuring out how to convince Dai Changming, but Ye Qingtang spoke first. “The sect Elders said that the elites of the outer sect must join this mission. It’s true that the top one thousand disciples can’t escape from it, but no one said that others can’t join, right?”

Ye Qingtang’s voice was clear, and her eyes were bright. She stared at Dai Changming, who had an unpleasant expression.

Dai Changming’s face darkened.

Zhou Qu was about to mock at Ye Qingtang, but he then realized that it was a good chance for Ye Qingtang to leave the sect. He would then be able to take revenge for his brother!

Zhou Qu did not say anything.

Dai Changming was silent for a while and glanced at Ye Qingtang.

“It’s up to you if you want to follow, but do not expect anyone to take care of you during the mission,” he said and turned.

Dai Changming’s words were not very pleasant, but he allowed Ye Qingtang to join the team.

Qin Huan sighed in relief. The rest of the disciples did not object since Dai Changming agreed. They did not care whether Ye Qingtang would follow them, as either way, none of them would help this new disciple.

The mission this time was extremely difficult. They also need to be fully prepared.

No one would bother if Ye Qingtang wanted to bring about her own death.

The group of people then immediately walked down the Path to Heaven.

Zhou Qu took a glimpse at Ye Qingtang before he turned away. His eyes were gloomy and cold.

Qin Huan and Ye Qingtang walked at the back.

“I did not expect Zhou Qu to be in this team as well. Be more careful, Junior Sister Ye. Zhou Qu is very cunning. He definitely blamed Zhou Xuan’s death on you.”

Ye Qingtang smiled gently.

Blamed on her?

She had not yet finished the business with the brothers of the Zhou family. She would satisfy his desires if Zhou Qu wanted to die.

“Senior Brother Qin, what’s special about Senior Brother Dai?” Ye Qingtang asked as she did not meet Dai Changming in her previous life.

Qin Huan said softly, “He is the number ten on the Honor Roll List. He will be the leader of our team this time.”

Honor Roll List?

Ye Qingtang was a little stunned. The Honor Roll List that Qin Huan mentioned was the top ranking in the outer sect. There were only ten people on the list. They were the strongest disciples in the outer sect. The top three could be compared with inner sect disciples for their abilities. No one dared to challenge them in the outer sect.

This was the first time that Ye Qingtang had an encounter with a disciple on the Honor Roll List.
