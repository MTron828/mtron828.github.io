Though Ni Shang was still young, she was almost a fully-grown girl with a pretty face. She was quite attractive among the attendant girls.

Before Ni Shang was assigned to Ye Qingtang, some inner sect disciples would flirt with her. She did not dare to resist, and she was still young.

The situation was better after she was assigned to Ye Qingtang.

However, after Ye Qingtang left, the three disciples who liked to flirt with her came again with Song Junqiu.

The four inner sect disciples broke into Ye Qingtang’s yard and kidnapped Ni Shang. Fei Ying wanted to stop them, but he was not strong enough to fight against them. He was beaten heavily until he fainted but still could not stop them.

“Young Lady, I’m aware that we are just servants and that our lives worth nothing. But Ni Shang is always loyal. Please save her…” Fei Ying begged Ye Qingtang constantly and kneeled onto the floor again. He ignored his injuries and knocked his head heavily onto the ground. The blood on his forehead was transferred onto the stone ground.

Ye Qingtang took a heavy breath and asked, “Besides Song Junqiu, who are the other three people?”

Fei Ying then said the names of the other three people.

Ye Qingtang felt her brain almost explode after hearing the names.

The names that Fei Ying said were the three inner sect disciples that he killed in her previous life.

That was the reason why she did not hear of Ni Shang’s name in her previous life. Ni Shang in her previous life most likely did not survive the incident and was tortured to death by the three disciples. Fei Ying was stimulated by Ni Shang’s death, and his potential was discovered. He worked hard and became an inner sect disciple. He then tortured the three disciples to death.

Everything now overlapped with the information from her previous life. Just this time, there was a Song Junqiu.

“Young Lady, please… please save her. As long as you are willing to save her, I will serve you for the rest of my life.” Fei Ying continued begging. He was slightly younger than Ni Shang, and she always took care of him. He always treated Ni Shang as his sister.

He hated himself the most when Ni Shang was humiliated. He hated his weakness and inability. He hated that he did not have the ability to protect her.

He also knew that they were inferior compared to the disciples. Even though Ye Qingtang was their Young Lady, she did not have the duty to provoke other disciples for them. However…

He had no other way.

“I understand now,” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and said slowly. She frowned heavily as her sight landed on Fei Ying who was kneeling in front of her.

“Follow me.” Ye Qingtang then walked out of the yard.

Fei Ying was stunned and raised his head. His face was full of confusion.

“You better hurry up if you want to save her.” Ye Qingtang’s voice was cold but anxious.

She did not know when Ni Shang was killed in her previous life. According to Fei Ying, Ni Shang was kidnapped three days ago. If they did not save her on time, she might…

Fei Ying then realized what Ye Qingtang was going to do. He wiped off his tears and got up from the floor and caught up with Ye Qingtang.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder who just left his yard suddenly saw Ye Qingtang. He wanted to escape instinctively, but…

Ye Qingtang was covered by a murderous look.
