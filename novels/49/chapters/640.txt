They were suddenly awoken by Ye Qingtang’s words.

Running away because of fear would only lead them to death.

If they tried their best to fight, there might be a chance to survive!

They wiped off the blood on their faces immediately and tried to calm down as they held their swords tightly.

Ye Qingtang had killed a few flying ants at the same time. She took a glimpse at the Blood Moon Elder who froze on the ground. She frowned and landed beside the Blood Moon Elder.

“What are you doing? Do you really want to be their food?”

The Blood Moon Elder then realized what was going on. His eyes were filled with astonishment.

“Holy Lady… why did you save them just now…”

“…” Ye Qingtang stared at him.

Is this guy really an idiot…

“When did I save them? I was saving myself.” She explained.

“Arh?” The Blood Moon Elder was confused.

“The ferocious beasts here will kill all humans here. If they died just now, we would be the next one they besiege. It adds a chance for us if they can kill one more beast.”

She was not kind enough to save others under such a situation.

“Holy Lady, that’s brilliant.” The Blood Moon Elder then understood the situation. He pulled his sword out to join the fight immediately without any hesitation.

More and more ferocious beasts gathered at the cliff. Numerous giant ants covered up the sky like the dark clouds.

Ye Qingtang’s shadow flicked around on the cliff. She waved her Demonic Blood Sword constantly and, together with the Blood Moon Elder, killed many giant ants dashing towards them.

As more and more corpses of giant ants dropped onto the cliff…

The white tiger who was left alone at the side stared at the corpses of the giant ants. “Creatures like you also dream to eat my flesh!”

Ye Qingtang was busy fighting the ferocious beasts when she heard the white tiger’s “shameless” clamor. Her lips shivered, and she glanced at the white tiger. However, the scene that she saw next stunned her.

The white tiger who was standing on top of the corpses of the giant ants suddenly roared softly towards the sky, and at the next second…

It opened its little mouth towards the corpses under its feet and showed its little sharp teeth.

The moment it opened its mouth, the corpse of the giant ant under its claws seemed to be attracted by a strong force and turned into a black shadow, traveling into the white tiger’s mouth!

The giant ant which was a few meters long was swallowed by the little white tiger entirely!

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder witnessed the shocking scene. If they did not see it with their own eyes, they would never believe that this little white tiger would be able to swallow the giant ant at one shot!

However, that did not bother the white tiger at all. It smacked its lips, and it did not seem to be satisfied.

“F*ck you! I will eat all of you here!”

The white tiger opened its mouth again and absorbed the corpses of the giant ants…
