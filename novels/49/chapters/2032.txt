Chapter 2033: Chaos (1)

Elder Cong didn’t dare hide anything and spilled all the information. “The Crimson League demanded that we hand over all our Spirit of Chaos fragments...”

“What?” The Clan Master’s frown deepened.

“So the Crimson League is interested in the fragments as well?” an Elder asked in surprise.

One of the Elders spoke up. “The Spirit of Chaos fragments are extremely rare. Since they are from the Second Domain, it makes sense that they are interested in it and would explain why they are suddenly attacking us.”

“It seems like Elder Mo was right.”

The Elders started discussing among themselves. They had already decided among themselves that the Crimson League was there for the Spirit of Chaos fragments and that the Netherworld Ring had just been an excuse.

Little did they know that...

The instigator of all this was Ye Qingtang.

“Elder Mo, you were right about all of this but the only reason it has blown up so much is because you were incompetent in the first place,” an Elder who disliked Elder Mo said.

Elder Mo’s face darkened instantly and he looked at You Qiong standing by his side. You Qiong’s heart trembled as he looked to the ground.

The Clan Master looked at everyone in the main hall and spoke after a while. “I want everyone to increase the speed of catching the demon cubs and ask the youths that are still out to move. This is not the time to go against the Crimson League.”

The Elders’ all looked dissatisfied at the Clan Master’s orders for them to avoid battle.

It was an important time for the rise of the Ancient You Clan and running away from the battle now would mean huge losses for them.

“I will be leaving for a few days. If you have matters you wish to discuss, it can wait until I return.” With that order made, the Clan Master turned and left.

With that said and decided, the Elders all turned and left as well. You Qiong seized this opportunity to hide in an area without anyone and contact Ye Qingtang. He then told her everything that had happened. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“You’re saying that the Ancient You Clan is starting to shift their forces?”

“That seems to be the case based on what the Clan Master said.”

“Do you know where they are going?” Ye Qingtang knew that the place they were moving to would definitely be hiding something important.

Perhaps...

Little You Yun was there.

“I’m not sure... the Clan Master was vague about it and the other Elders have never mentioned it before either....” He suddenly sensed someone approaching and quickly hid the voice transmission stone, turning around as though nothing was happening.

Elder Mo was staring at You Qiong with a dark expression. You Qiong could feel that something was amiss.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang was waiting for You Qiong to continue his sentence when his voice was suddenly cut off.

She suddenly heard a shrill scream from the voice transmission stone.

“Elder Mo, what are you doing?” You Qiong’s terrified voice floated over from the stone.

Ye Qingtang’s heart gave a heavy jolt.

There was a sudden loud noise before all the sounds were completely cut off, as though the stone had been broken in two.

This was bad.

You Qiong was in danger!

Her brows furrowed together. Even though she had forced You Qiong to be a spy, she wouldn’t just leave him to die since she had already made use of him.

Not only that, she was even able to find out the Ancient You Clan’s next move based on the information that he had provided.
