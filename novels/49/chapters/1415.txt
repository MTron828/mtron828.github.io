“Little girl, I have to leave now. I am quite happy to know you. If there’s a chance in the future, I will treat you to frozen bananas again,” Beidou Demon Lord said with a smile.

Looking at the young Beidou Demon Lord before her, memories from her previous life rushed into Ye Qingtang’s head, and she immediately took out the Bone of the Dragon Breath from her space ring and stuffed it into Beidou Demon Lord’s hand.

“Little girl, what do you mean by this?” Beidou Demon Lord’s eyes popped wide when he saw the Bone of the Dragon Breath in his hand.

“I could not stand those two and fought with them on purpose. This item is not much use to me. It’s yours now,” Ye Qingtang said plainly.

Beidou Demon Lord gasped and hurriedly stuffed the Bone of the Dragon Breath back into Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“Little girl. I can’t take it. You spent three hundred thousand spirit coins on this Bone of the Dragon Breath. How could I take it? You are still young and don’t know how precious this Bone of the Dragon Breath is. There’s a lot of benefits if you use it to cultivate in the future. I cannot take this item.”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with smiles as she looked at the frank and upright Beidou Demon Lord.

In her previous life, she owed him a piece of the Bone of the Dragon Breath, and she must return it to him this time.

If Beidou Demon Lord could obtain this Bone of the Dragon Breath earlier in her previous life, perhaps his skills would have advanced to another stage. He could become the most formidable of the demon clan, and he could rescue his father.

And would not die with regrets…

“You have misunderstood. I am not giving this Bone of the Dragon Breath to you. You still have to return the equivalent amount of spirit coins to me in the future.” Ye Qingtang knew that he definitely would not accept it if she gave it to Beidou Demon Lord for free; thus, she changed her reason.

“Are you… not afraid that I will renege on the debt?” Beidou Demon Lord was taken aback.

“I am afraid.” Ye Qingtang nodded with a smile.

“…” Beidou Demon Lord was utterly dumbfounded. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“So we can first become sworn siblings. If you become my brother, you will not renege on your sister’s debt, right?” Ye Qingtang smiled while tricking the straightforward Beidou Demon Lord.

Beidou Demon Lord was in a daze as he looked at the Bone of the Dragon Breath in his hand and then at Ye Qingtang.

He needed the Bone of the Dragon Breath desperately.

“Alright. Let’s do it.” He liked this little girl the moment he saw her, and he gained such huge help from her now. Thus, he was naturally happy to be sworn siblings with her.

“I will call you sworn brother in the future then?” Ye Qingtang smiled and asked.

“Alright, alright. You are my little sister then.” Beidou Demon Lord grinned happily. He did not have any brothers or sisters.

Ye Qingtang smiled. It was an earnest smile this time.

Great.

Her sworn brother had returned.

She would never let him die with resentment this time.

After Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord became sworn siblings, a few figures suddenly flew toward them from Burnt City.

The smile on Ye Qingtang’s face vanished instantly.

They still chased after, didn’t they?

In the next second, Ye You, Ye Xun, an elderly with a white mustache, and a few middle-aged men flew toward Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord.

Ye Qingtang knew that Ye You would not give up on the Bone of the Dragon Breath easily; thus, she left immediately after obtaining the Bone of the Dragon Breath. Yet, unexpectedly… they still chased after them.

“Great. You two are in the same gang. How dare you two think of fleeing after snatching Sister You’s item?” Ye Xun had not reached them, but her voice had already traveled over.

Beidou Demon Lord was startled, and he instinctively guarded Ye Qingtang behind him.

“Little sister, leave first. I will stall them.”

Before Beidou Demon Lord could finish his sentence, Ye You and the rest appeared before them and blocked their way.
