Chapter 2073: Counter (2)

“Elder Yuan.” The Clan Master lifted his eyes to look at Elder Yuan, who was standing silently to one side.

“Yes?” he said.

“Those two kids are under your control. Can you tell where they are?” the Clan Master asked.

He had to get Little You Yun. The Spirit of Chaos could be let go of but the Spiritual Abode couldn’t belong to anyone else.

“I can vaguely sense that they’re in the direction of the Temple of Shadows, but I’ll need to get closer to narrow down the actual location.”

The Clan Master nodded slightly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Alright, we’ll attack the Temple of Shadows directly. You’ll be in charge of finding the children after that.”

He paused for a moment before continuing,

“Elder Yuan, you had better not disappoint me this time.”

A bead of cold sweat ran down Elder Yuan’s forehead as he nodded.

...

The Temple of Shadows and the Central Mainland had sent more people to the Central Mainland to look for the Ancient You Clan. But it was as though they had vanished from the entire Mainland. There was no trace of them at all.

Ye Qingtang continued to keep the information about the Spirit of Chaos to herself, which only made the Crimson League search for the Ancient You Clan even more frantically.

“From what I can see, the Ancient You Clan are already too scared to even show their face, so Holy Lord, you don’t have to be too worried.” The eight tribe leaders were gathered in the main hall.

They didn’t think that the Ancient You Clan could cause any more trouble. As long as the Crimson League was still on the Central Mainland, the Ancient You Clan wouldn’t show their faces.

The eight tribe leaders were more worried about rejoining the Crimson League.

“Holy Lord, since we’ve already rejoined the Crimson League, should we consider returning to the Second Domain after all of this is over?” the Demon Tribe leader said eagerly.

The eight tribe leaders’ strength was based on the amount of faith people had in them. When they were in the Second Domain, their powers made them have a huge following, which made them even stronger.

But the faith they received had faded when they went to the First Domain.

The Temple of Shadows had been strong in the Central Mainland and they had received a lot of faith, which had sustained their power. But with the disappearance of the Holy Lord of Shadows and the desolation of the Temple of Shadows, they had lost much of their power and were now not even one-tenth of their previous strength.

In their heyday when they were still in the Second Domain, just one stomp of their foot would be enough to make the First Domain shake three times. How far they had fallen.

Ye Qingtang knew their intentions well and had several thoughts about going to the Second Domain as well.

She had found some hints of her mother’s identity in the mystic realm and knew that she was from the Second Domain. The only way she could find out more about her was to go there.

Just as she was about to speak her mind, a sudden pain bloomed in her chest.

The pain seared through her bones and brain and was so painful it felt as though her lungs and heart were being ripped apart. It was so bad that her vision turned black and she almost fell off the Black Bone throne.

Fortunately, it only lasted for a little while. She swayed for a moment but stabilized herself almost immediately.
