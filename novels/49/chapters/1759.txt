Chapter 1760: False Bravado (1)

The pit was further down from the fiendish demon cave. Those little fiendish demons walked in front and Ye Qingtang followed behind them.

There was no telling how deep the cave was. Ye Qingtang saw many broken bones, as well as some rotting bits of flesh. A strong evil stench permeated the entire cave, the smell so intense that the sensitive Little White Tiger was nearly fainting from it. It kept gagging from the smell.

It was then that several little fiendish demons walking beside Ye Qingtang noticed the two things nestled inside her arms. One of them was pitch black and looked like a baby dragon, while the other was white and furry.

“You are truly the Great Sage. We seldom see such exotic food here. We have only heard other Great Sages mention about dragons. We heard that they are very rare and very delicious. And Great Sage managed to obtain the sweetest and most tender of them all, a baby dragon. You are indeed formidable...” One of the little fiendish demons was full of respect and adoration.

A Great Sage who was able to obtain a rare baby dragon must be very powerful indeed!

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly as she gazed at the sleeping Little Heavenly Demon. Ye Qingtang wouldn’t be caught in this state if Little Heavenly Demon was awake now.

Soon enough, they arrived at the pit.

Ye Qingtang could feel an intense heat emanating from somewhere deep within. Gazing into the darkness, she saw many huge creatures chained to the floor, unable to move. Those huge eyes stared back at her through the shadows.

They were giant earth fire lizards. Covered in deep red scales, their tremendous bodies were like mountains. Even from where she was standing, Ye Qingtang could already feel the powerful heat radiating from the bodies.

According to legend, the baby earth fire lizard in the Central Mainland was over a dozen meters tall. Meanwhile, these earth fire lizards in front of Ye Qingtang were hundreds of meters in height. It was clear just how big these creatures could become.

The appearance of an adult earth fire lizard on Central Mainland would only spell a major disaster.

But now, these powerful and destructive earth fire lizards had been chained to the ground. Those little fiendish demons displayed no fear at all toward the creatures. To them, the earth fire lizards were like a flock of sheep waiting to be slaughtered.

Ye Qingtang was the only one who was shaken.

“Great Sage, please wait a moment. we will settle this minor matter. We won’t trouble the Great Sage over this,” the group of little fiendish demons said respectfully. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

It would be easy for an Emperor-level adult fiendish demon to handle these ferocious earth fire lizards. Meanwhile, the Fourth Heaven level Ye Qingtang could barely hold back her tears when faced with these massive creatures.

But now...

Wasn’t she supposed to be an all-powerful adult fiendish demon in the eyes of these little demons?

Ye Qingtang immediately put on an imperious facade and nodded. “Hurry up. Don’t waste my time.”

As long as they didn’t ask her to take action!

At Ye Qingtang’s command, those little fiendish demons rallied and pounced toward those earth fire lizards. Those little demons had behaved so timidly in front of Ye Qingtang, but they now displayed the ferocity of their kind when dealing with the earth fire lizards.

They were just skinny little things but were able to crack open the skulls of the earth fire lizards with just one punch. Those lizards did not even have the strength to resist, but just died on the spot.
