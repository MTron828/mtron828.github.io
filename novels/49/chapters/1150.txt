Chapter 1151: Ultimate Elder (3)

The golden-robed man had assumed that the black flames Ye Qingtang displayed were merely ordinary fire-elemental cultivation techniques. He had not imagined that they were actually Extraordinary Flames…

“What kind of Extraordinary Flame is this…”

The golden-robed man frowned with a rather puzzled expression.

In this world, there were a total of three thousand types of Extraordinary Flames. Besides the dozen Divine Extraordinary Flames that, according to legends, only the gods possessed, he knew all the other Extraordinary Flames. But he could not recognize the Extraordinary Flame that Ye Qingtang displayed.

Even Ye Qingtang herself did not know the name of this Extraordinary Flame, much less the golden-robed man.

When Ye Qingtang had understood the Ultimate Origin Skill, this Extraordinary Flame already existed. Later, when Ye Qingtang inherited the Divine Phoenix’s Bloodline, the Extraordinary Flame in her body had perfectly integrated with the Divine Phoenix’s Bloodline. After that, Ye Qingtang had coincidentally obtained the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline, and then her Extraordinary Flame had transformed into a deep black color, and its power had become even more aggressive.

To be honest, Ye Qingtang’s Extraordinary Flame could not be considered as an orthodox Extraordinary Flame but was a mutated Extraordinary Flame. With the Ultimate Origin Skill as its basis, it integrated with the Divine Phoenix’s Bloodline and the Heavenly Demon Bloodline to form an entirely new type of Extraordinary Flame.

“Little girl, this Extraordinary Flame of yours is really something.” The Ultimate Elder stared at the black flames that had surfaced around Ye Qingtang as he spoke.

“How many types of Extraordinary Flames are you familiar with?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Oh… I know about burning firewood but not too much about Extraordinary Flames.” The Ultimate Elder thought for a while before replying.

This reply rendered Ye Qingtang speechless. She had thought the Ultimate Elder was an expert and wanted to ask him about the reason behind mutated Extraordinary Flames…

“You have a death wish!”

The golden-robed man suddenly bellowed in rage. His entire person transformed into an after-image, and he swiftly arrived at Ye Qingtang’s side. He raised his right hand and struck at her with a terrifying force.

“Hmph, you aren’t showing me any respect!” When he saw what was going on, the Ultimate Elder grunted coldly. He crooked his fingers, and the void next to Ye Qingtang suddenly twisted and swallowed Ye Qingtang up.

Boom!

With a deafening sound, the golden-robed man’s blow missed its mark. Ye Qingtang, who had been right in front of him, suddenly vanished completely.

At the same time, the space next to the Ultimate Elder suddenly started to ripple, and Ye Qingtang’s figure appeared.

“Hahaha, little girl, isn’t this fun.” The Ultimate Elder laughed and said to Ye Qingtang.

“Thank you for your help.” Ye Qingtang cupped her fists and thanked the Ultimate Elder.

This Ultimate Elder’s Space Technique was truly extraordinary. Even at Ye Qingtang’s peak, she had seldom seen the Space Technique being displayed.

However, the Ultimate Elder’s Space Technique had been cultivated to a very high level. He could exchange spaces and move them across a distance of a thousand miles. It was truly unparalleled.

Before the Ultimate Elder could say anything, Ye Qingtang’s expression suddenly changed, and she involuntarily looked behind her.

Swoosh!

…

Whiz!

Many ear-splitting noises could be heard, and a few moments later, more and more after-images surfaced in the void above.

Two middle-aged men arrived in the nearby void.

One of them was wearing a long black robe. He looked aged and wrinkled, and his left eye was blind.

The other was wearing a long green robe. He was extraordinarily handsome, with waist-length bright red hair. A heavy sword was tied to his back with a white cloth.

“General You Tong… General You Ming, you’re too late,” said the golden-robed man. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When he heard that, the green-robed man, who was called You Tong, laughed remotely and said, “General You Jin, can’t you deal with the ants in this inferior mainland yourself?”
