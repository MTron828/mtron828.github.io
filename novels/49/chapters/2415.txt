Chapter 2416: Desperate Straits (4)

The teacher had been crushed into two parts and one arm was covering a dead teenage girl. Although the teenage girl was already dead, it was clear that even at the final moment, this teacher had been trying to protect his student…

Ye Qingtang took off the space ring from the teacher’s hand and opened it. She glanced inside, her face instantly darkened.

“I am afraid that my suspicions are proving true.”

“Teacher Ye? Your suspicions? What do you mean?” Lu Yuanxiang looked at Ye Qing in confusion. He had no idea what the latter had been suspecting.

Lei Yan and the others were also very curious. They were planning to step forward to take a look but Ye Qing commanded, “Go and take care of the others. See if there are any lucky survivors around.”

Lei Yan and his group were taken aback.

Lucky survivors?

Was Teacher Ye joking?

Even the trees had been turned to mush. Anyone here would definitely be dead meat. But even though they felt that Boss’ task for them was a fool’s errand, Lei Yan and the others obediently went and did as asked.

Ye Qingtang led Lu Yuanxiang to the side and opened the space ring for him to see.

When Lu Yuanxiang glanced inside, he saw that there was only a tripod and some demon crystals. For a moment there, he still had no idea what was going on. He looked at Ye Qingtang in confusion.

“Teacher Ye, what’s wrong?”

Ye Qingtang replied in a soft voice, “The Maple Night Academy’s teleportation talisman is gone.”

Lu Yuanxiang was taken aback.

“I already suspected that your teleportation talisman’s failure to work might not have been an accident. So when I saw the Maple Night Academy team, I wanted to confirm my suspicions…” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Maple Night Academy had clearly also encountered some indomitable monster. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have died so wretchedly. No teacher would be so stubborn as to refuse to use the teleportation talisman under such circumstances.

And the absence of the teleportation talisman in the space ring confirmed Ye Qingtang’s conjecture.

“The Maple Night Academy people must have used the teleportation talisman at the crucial moment, wanting to escape from this place. But in the end, their talisman also failed to work, just like yours. They were not teleported out and all died here.”

Lu Yuanxiang was stunned.

Before he could react, he saw Ye Qing take out her space ring and the teleportation talisman from inside it. Without any hesitation, she crushed it.

“Teacher Ye…” Lu Yuanxiang wanted to stop him but it was too late. After it was crushed, Ye Qing remained standing there. Lei Yan and the others did not disappear either.

All that had happened in front of his eyes…

…Completely stunned Lu Yuanxiang.

Ye Qingtang was not surprised at the outcome.

“These teleportation talismans are useless. We have been tricked.”

“By whom? Who would dare to tamper with the teleportation talismans? Do they want to make enemies out of the various academies?” Lu Yuanxiang asked.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. There were too few clues and she could not make an accurate conjecture at this point. Something suddenly came to mind but she remained silent.

Things were probably even more complicated than what they could imagine now.

Mu Ziying suddenly ran over.

“Boss, there are some people heading this way!”

With a slight frown, Ye Qingtang summoned Lei Yan and the others to immediately leave this wretched place.

But just as they were about to flee into the dense forest, several figures emerged!
