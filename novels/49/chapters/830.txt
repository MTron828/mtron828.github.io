Chapter 831 Assembly Of The Prodigies

After a long while, the youth looked at the elderly with a seeming smile.

There were several guards with unfathomable martial auras standing beside the youth.

“Your Highness, your chess skills became more exquisite again,” said the elderly with a nod. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Subsequently, the youth rose and took a glance across his surroundings. Lifting a finger gently, the chessboard vanished.

“Is this place the mainland whose Dimension Wall is broken… The spirit energy is so thin.” The youth’s lips tugged up slightly.

“Your Highness, may I know why you came to this inferior mainland?”

A midget who was less than a meter tall asked the youth curiously.

“Nothing much. I just came to gain knowledge and experience.” The youth replied.

“Your Highness, the spirit energy on this mainland is extremely thin. Even our skills are being suppressed. It’s better for us to leave as soon as possible.” Another guard spoke up.

After hearing that, the youth smiled faintly. “Since I came here, I naturally have my objectives. Do I still need you all to teach me when to leave?”

The guard’s expression changed instantly, and he bowed with cupped fists. “Please forgive me, Your Highness!”

The youth waved his hand and said, “Rise.”

“Noted…”

The guard relaxed.

A while later, the youth turned around and gazed at the sky while mumbling. “I never thought that the current talents would eventually compete together on this mainland. Interesting, really interesting…”

“Does Your Highness mean that the Yin Yang Boy, Black and White Holy Son, and those superhuman people on the Honor Roll List will all come here?” The midget asked curiously.

“There is a Dragon Vein here with a Wintry Yin aura. If not for the long-term protection of the Dimension Wall…” The youth scoffed before continuing. “This mainland would have been conquered a long time ago.”

Everyone at the scene believed the youth’s words fully.

“Teacher, let’s go and take a look.” The youth spoke to the elderly with a smile.

The elderly stood up and said, “Alright. Since Your Highness is so interested, I will accompany you.”

However, as the elderly spoke, the youth had already walked ahead.

The elderly frowned slightly upon witnessing the sight but did not mention anything.

“True Dragon and Divine Phoenix in the eternal Dragon Vein… Thousands of talents on a small plot of land, yet it’s still unfathomable.” The youth’s lips curled up, and his eyes shone like a bright moon.

As the guards followed the youth, they sized up the elderly every now and then.

“Your Highness, you clearly know that Perfected Gu Yun has already relied on the Crown Prince, but why… do you still want to let Perfected Gu Yun stay beside you on this trip?”

One of the guards asked softly with a weird expression.

“Don’t speak nonsense. How can we guess His Highness’s thoughts?” The midget rolled his eyes at the person who spoke immediately.

At the same time, several figures appeared successively in the air extremely far away.

A skinny figure arrived in the air, and a glint shone in his eyes.

Right on the heels of that, a few other figures appeared again.

If Ye Qingtang was present, she would definitely recognize these people with outstanding appearances.

The exceptional prodigies of the Central Mainland actually broke through the Dimension Wall and appeared on this mainland at the same time.

“Interesting. This mainland’s Dimension Wall actually broke during my lifetime. It seems that the Dragon Vein must have some fate with me.”

A muscular middle-aged man who was about three meters tall laughed loudly.

“You also wish to snatch the Dragon Vein with me?” The thin youth looked at the middle-aged man and snickered.

“Yin Yang Boy…”

The muscular middle-aged man’s eyes flickered, but he did not dare to attack.
