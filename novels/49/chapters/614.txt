Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“F*ck all of you despicable and lowly humans!” The white tiger towered over and looked down on everyone.

“What exactly do you want!” A super sect figure shouted coldly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What do I want?” The white tiger glanced over everyone. “I want all of you to die here.”

Ye Qingtang looked around her surroundings. There were at least dozens of corpses nearby, which were probably all killed by this Fiendcelestial Beast.

“This is an infant Fiendcelestial Beast?” Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly furrowed as she looked at this Fiendcelestial Beast. Although it could not be compared to an adult beast, it was at least more mature than an infant one. Otherwise, that king-level giant crocodile would not have been beaten up.

“When have we ever chased after your life? All this while, it has been you who chased after our lives. However, in your mouth, it became us chasing after your life instead…” A super sect figure gritted his teeth. He had never seen such a shameless beast!

Over the past few days, they encountered this Fiendcelestial Beast a while after entering the Hell of Avicinaraka.

Initially, everyone came for the Fiendcelestial Beast, but it was too powerful, and looking at its body, it was definitely not an infant. After taking a look at it, they dropped the idea of capturing the Fiendcelestial Beast. However, this Fiendcelestial Beast was crazy and chased after them for days. Helpless, they could only fight the Fiendcelestial Beast, but dozens of people died in its hands in just half a day. As a result, their combat ability was halved.

“How dare you despicable, lowly humans quibble!”

The white tiger hollered furiously and spouted black flames from its mouth.

The charcoal-black fiend fire was as dark as the abyss. Caught off-guard, a few super sect figures were possessed by the black flame.

In just a few seconds, those people turned into ashes completely.

Everyone gasped at the sight.

The Fiendcelestial Beast was too powerful and frightening. The combat ability that it displayed was at least above the Fourth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Even if everyone combined forces, they would definitely be unable to defeat it, and there was no probability of achieving victory.

Looking back now, their desire of entering the mystic realm to tame the Fiendcelestial Beast was truly ridiculous.

“It’s fortunate that this Fiendcelestial Beast has not grown to an adult; otherwise… even if a hegemon-level beast is here, it would also be slain.”

A few super sects figures were terrified as they looked at the Fiendcelestial Beast.

It was said that once a Fiendcelestial Beast reached its adult form, its body could extend to several miles. Other stories said that it could swallow a city with millions of people with just one bite.

In ancient times, quite a number of Fiendcelestial Beasts once did evil. Areas with millions of people were almost swallowed in one go once they met an adult Fiendcelestial Beast.

“Run now!” A certain super sect figure shouted loudly.

Immediately, the ten or so people dispersed and fled in all directions, unwilling to remain there to wait for death.

“Holy Lady, this Fiendcelestial Beast is too strong. It’s better for us to be far from it.” The Blood Moon Elder told Ye Qingtang.

After hearing the Blood Moon Elder’s words, Ye Qingtang nodded. That was her original intention as well. If they stayed there and were targeted by the Fiendcelestial Beast, the consequences would be dire.

Ye Qingtang’s very first objective of entering the mystic realm was to obtain the Black Heaven Water, and she never hoped to tame the Fiendcelestial Beast.

“Still wish to escape?” Suddenly, the white tiger jumped up.

With a loud “boom,” the ground shattered.

As the white tiger’s huge body landed, it blocked the way of Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

“Despicable, lowly humans. You all have been chasing me for so long, but now you all wish to leave without giving me an explanation?” The white tiger bellowed loudly while staring at Ye Qingtang.
