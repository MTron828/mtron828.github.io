Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The blood fog that initially enveloped Deer City began to disappear slowly. It was then that everyone faintly felt that there was a way out. Without daring to delay at all, they quickly seized this time to rush out to the city gate.

Qin Huan wiped the cold sweat on his face away. Glancing at the Blood Moon Sect who was following behind Ye Qingtang, he uttered in annoyance. “Why did this rascal Zhou Qu return as well? Wasn’t he dragged away by the zombies just now? I thought he would definitely be slaughtered by the Blood Moon Sect Elder.”

Honestly speaking, Qin Huan really wished for such a lousy person like Zhou Qu to just die early. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder, whose face was as black as the base of a pot, and laughed in her heart, though she maintained a calm expression on her face.

“He was able to survive only because the Blood Moon Sect Elder left hurriedly.”

Qin Huan did not think much to it as well.

Everyone dashed towards the city gate of Deer City, but before they reached the city gate, they suddenly saw a group of people rushing into the city loudly.

Almost instantly, everyone’s hair stood on ends. Could it be that the Blood Moon Sect Elder returned with his underlings?

Swiftly, the group of people entered Deer City, and everyone sighed in relief when they had a clear look of the incoming people!

There were over ten people wearing different sect uniforms, and the people in the lead were six elderlies with gray hair.

And among the six elderlies, two of them were wearing Xuanling Sect clothes that represented the status of an Elder!

“It’s the inner sect elders!” Happiness filled Dai Changming when he saw the group of people.

Elders from different sects were rushing over with wardens and disciples.

“Xuanling Sect disciples greet two elders!” Dai Changming immediately led his junior brothers and sisters in greeting the elders.

It should be known that outer sect disciples like them did not have any chance of meeting the inner sect elders. These two elders were probably investigating in the area and rushed over because of the signal that Ye Qingtang sent out previously.

The elders who came along with the others were Elder Lin of the inner sect’s Sword Faction and Elder Qin of the inner sect’s Array Faction. Other than them, elders from Wind Moon Sect and other sects hurried there as well. When the impressive group of people entered Deer City, they felt an aura that had not completely dissipated.

“What exactly happened?” Elder Lin frowned slightly at the disciples who knelt before him. Elder Qin and he brought a team to investigate in the vicinity, suddenly sensed the signal, and thus hurried over with sect elders who were searching in the same area.

“Elder, we encountered a Blood Moon Sect Elder in Deer City,” Dai Changming said.

Blood Moon Sect Elder?

Everyone had a shocked look on their faces after hearing him.

Recently, disciples from various sects disappeared unknowingly. The elders have investigated for a long time but never found a clue. The places they went to were all deserted, yet unexpectedly… Dai Changming and the rest were actually able to find a clue. However, what surprised them even more was that… it had to do with the Blood Moon Sect.

“What is the situation?” Elder Qin asked.

Dai Changming immediately recounted everything that happened in Deer City. Right after, a few elders brought some people and headed to the square. The elders’ faces turned white instantly when greeted with the bloody scene.

They were afraid that the recent disappearances of the various sects’ disciples were all related to the Blood Moon Sect!

Countless corpses of sect disciples laid in the entire square. When the Wind Moon Sect elder saw the corpse of that inner sect disciple, his face paled, and he shut his eyes in pain.

“Master…” The young teen from Wind Moon Sect looked at his Master with red, puffy eyes.
