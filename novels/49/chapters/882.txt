Chapter 883 How Dare You Trick Me (1)

Ling Yan closed his eyes. There was a karmic imprint which he left on Ye Qingtang’s karmic natal chart.

That was sufficient to prove that Ye Qingtang’s rebirth was completely his doing.

However, Ling Yan still had not figured out why he wanted to let Ye Qingtang be reborn. Because he did not have any memories from his previous lifetime he could only work through the weak information slowly.

A long time later, a faint smile broke out on his almost-flawless face, and he took out a voice transmission stone from somewhere.

“Miss Ye,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang’s voice sounded from Ling Yan’s voice transmission stone. “What is it?”

“There’s nothing. It’s just that I haven’t heard your voice for a long time and am missing it,” replied Ling Yan.

There was silence in the spirit stone. A long while later, Ye Qingtang’s voice gradually sounded. “We have only met each other for a few days, but you’re missing my voice already?”

“If I can meet Miss Ye, that will naturally be the best,” Ling Yan said.

“Where are you? I happen to have something to ask you.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“If you wish to meet me, you just need to ask Master Du to lead the way.” The smile remained hanging on his lips.

Before Ling Yan could continue speaking, Ye Qingtang had already switched off the voice transmission stone.

At this instant, Ling Yan was playing with a blue stone which exuded a Wintry Yin Aura and his entire body was enveloped in the Wintry Aura.

This blue stone was formed by the Dragon Bone of the True Dragon. To obtain the inheritance of the True Dragon, one had to be guided by this item. Otherwise, it was not realistic to find the True Dragon’s inheritance in a short time.

However, at the same time, an elderly’s eyes were burning after sensing this blue stone from mid-air.

Yet, he automatically shuddered when he noticed Ling Yan’s face.

“How hateful… This treasure actually fell in his hands…” The elderly gritted his teeth.

There was a youth who followed behind the elderly. “Master, he is merely martial trash. Let’s just snatch it.”

“Snatch?!” The elderly scoffed. “Disciple, do you know who that man is?”.

“I don’t…” The youth shook his head.

“Eternal Dynasty’s Third Prince, Ling Yan,” the elderly said.

A shiver ran down the youth’s spine immediately when he heard the elderly, and he hurriedly said, “Master, let’s leave quickly… I heard that even an Arcane Supremacy at his peak was toyed to death by Ling Yan…”

“Humph. Ling Yan is alone but dares to hold the Dragon Bone so openly… He must have made full preparations. Forget it, let’s go.”

While the elderly was not resigned to take it lying down, he did not dare to really strike and snatch it either.

Some time after the elderly brought the youth away, another figure appeared there again.

The person had above-average looks, and there was an indifferent expression on her face. If Ye Qingtang was here, she would definitely be able to tell that this person was none other than Ye You with a look.

“The bone of the True Dragon?!”

Ye You looked at Ling Yan below and saw the blue stone in his hand.

It had already been some time since Ye You arrived in this Dragon Vein. She originally wanted to search for the inheritance of the True Dragon and Divine Phoenix, but there was no progress at all until now. She was attracted over by the Wintry Yin Aura at this place.

If she could obtain the bone of the True Dragon, she would be able to locate the inheritance of the True Dragon in the shortest time! 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Almost without hesitation, Ye You gradually descended and was already standing beside Ling Yan a few breaths later.
