Chapter 2302: Selection Trials (5)

It was fortunate that Qin Xuan was not like Qin Feng. Although his innate talent was slightly inferior, he was suitable to be groomed and had now achieved good results.

“Faculty Head Gu is too anxious. With Qin Xuan’s current powers, what’s there to worry about? He will definitely enter the Inter-Academy Competition, he doesn’t even need to attend the selection trials.” One of the other teachers smiled.

There were only a handful of students at the Divine Lord stage, there was no need to think too much. Qin Xuan would definitely be selected for the Inter-Academy Competition. There wasn’t even any real need for him to come today. Even if some students wished to challenge the top 50, they would never choose a genius like Qin Xuan.

“You are too kind. It is all thanks to my Master’s teachings that I achieved what I have today. Master said before that a martial arts practitioner needs to remain modest and calm. By coming here and watching the battles today, I will be able to further my learning.” Qin Xuan spoke modestly.

Gu Wei was very pleased with his student’s words.

The other teacher smiled.

“Faculty Head Gu, you have gotten yourself a good disciple. Qin Xuan is so willing to learn and possesses pretty good innate talent. I also hope that in the upcoming Inter-Academy Competition, Qin Xuan can bring glory to our Netherworld Academy.”

Qin Xuan gave a humble smile.

The teacher continued. “Qin Xuan, I heard that Qin Feng is under a new teacher now. Do you know much about it?”

Qin Xuan replied, “I have heard of it.”

The teacher sighed. “It is such a pity regarding Qin Feng. He wasted your master’s efforts and was unable to achieve anything. And now, he is under such a wayward teacher. I heard that if Qin Feng doesn’t get selected for the Inter-Academy Competition, he will be kicked out of the academy.”

The hint of a smile flashed across Qin Xuan’s eyes when he heard that.

The last he saw him, Qin Feng’s powers had already deteriorated to the Paragon Eighth Heaven level. Now, his powers had probably deteriorated even further. At his current level, there was no way he could enter the Inter-Academy Competition.

Qin Feng would soon be kicked out of the Netherworld Academy. From being the hope of the Qin family, he would fall to become their biggest disgrace.

“There’s no need to talk about inconsequential people.” Gu Wei spoke in a chilly voice.

The teacher shut his mouth.

Another smile flashed across Qin Xuan’s eyes.

Qin Feng’s existence was a thorn in Gu Wei’s side. He was a blemish on Gu Wei’s teaching career. It was natural that Gu Wei did not wish to hear him mentioned.

Soon after, the selection trials commenced. The top 50 had already been chosen early on and today was for students who had not been selected to step forward and challenge those 50.

Many teenagers with rather good skills had already chosen their intended competitor and were ready to do battle.

And nearly all of those from the top 50 who had been challenged was in the bottom 20. Few people would dare to challenge those in the top 30. As for the top 10…no one would even dare to utter their names.

Intense battles filled the entire arena.

Di Nuo stood on the high stage, scanning the crowd. Nearly everyone was present. It had already been half a day since the trials started, but he was still waiting in vain for the person he wanted to see.

“Teacher Luo Sheng, has Ye Qing given up? I have yet to see him today.” Di Nuo looked at Luo Sheng.

Luo Sheng frowned slightly. He also had no idea what Ye Qing was thinking. He had always believed that Ye Qing was just asking for trouble by making that bet. If so, why did he have to do it?

Now that things had come to this stage, if he didn’t make an appearance, it would be an automatic loss for him.
