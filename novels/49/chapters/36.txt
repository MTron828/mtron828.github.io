Chapter 37: Rite of the Sabbath (2)

“Miss Ye You or Ye Xun had always been their representative for the past years. If Miss Ye You is not around this time, Ye Xun will most likely be the one to go on stage then.”

“Although Ye Xun’s adopted, she fared quite well. Being graceful and with that pretty face, I’ll say she’s a suitable representative.”

Amongst the hushed whispers and crowd’s chatters, the time to commence the rite was fast approaching. Members from the three noble families had already arrived at the altar.

A thunderous drum roll, rumbling atop the altar’s stage, marked the official commencement for the Rite of the Sabbath.

Si Ye was the first to go on stage. Standing in front of the Sky Wheel, he proclaimed a prayer of blessing, before he put his arms around the wheel. Exerting his strength, he turned the wheel, weighing several thousand pounds, with all his might.

The gigantic Sky Wheel revolved with a tumultuous rumble, resembling the roar of a dragon. The common folk surrounding the stage, whilst deep in their prayers, had their sight locked onto the revolving wheel.

The Sky Wheel, after revolving for two rounds, came to a rest.

Other than its immense weight, there was so much backlash between the wheel’s meshing gears that for centuries, turning the wheel was deemed a great feat. To turn just a round would have taken its toll on a common cultivator. Si Ye had managed two, that obviously earned the crowd’s applause.

“As the eldest young lord from the Si household, his strength is truly impressive.”

Duan Tianrao was near the altar as he watched Si Ye walked down the stage. He maintained a straight face, that was in contrast to his brother, Duan Tianrui, who was clearly amused, as he spoke to Duan Tianrao in a hushed whisper:

“Bro, he ain’t that impressive. From what I see, he’s at most an innate stage five, while bro, you’ve already exceeded stage six the last month. Thrashing him is a piece of cake.”

A smirk played along Duan Tianrao’s lips while he ran his eyes over Si Ye but focused his attention on the dashing Si Bai, who stood beneath the stage instead.

Si Bai was the real genius among the Si household. Although he had never showcased his strength, but judging from his talents, Si Ye could never hold a candle to him. The real person whom Duan Tianrao wished to surpass was Si Bai all along.

Unfortunately, Si Bai had never participated.

After Si Ye came down from stage, it would be the Duan household’s turn. As their representative, Duan Tianrao leapt onto the stage instantly with a single jump.

When his stalwart figure appeared on stage, plenty of girls amongst the crowd of audience feasted their eyes on him.

Out of all the noble men in the city, Si Bai could be considered the most attractive in terms of looks. But regrettably, due to his weak constitution, he had rarely left his residence. Duan Tianrao, on the hand, caught the eyes of many girls in the city because of his strapping build and charismatic face.

Duan Tianrao stood beside the Sky Wheel, and as he focused his eyes on it, he built up his might in an instant, and exploded into action to turn the wheel.

The wheel started revolving the next moment and with that rapid rotation, the crowd of audience stared in awe.

Under Duan Tianrao’s might, the Sky Wheel completed three full rotations!

He had clearly surpassed Si Ye by achieving a further round!

That was the highest record in these recent years.

“He has improved again!”

“With such strength, no wonder he’s chosen to be the next head of the household. No common man’s able to exceed him at that.”

Duan Tianrao had his usual demeanor even as he basked in the exhilarating cheers and praises from the crowd, though his eyes twinkled with an inkling of satisfaction. As he turned around to face the crowd, he paid homage to the audience and voiced his appreciation, “Today, it’s an honor for me to stand here before everyone. I’ll like to take this opportunity to announce a couple of important news.”T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
