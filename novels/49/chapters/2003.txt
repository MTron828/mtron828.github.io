Chapter 2004: Good Show (5)

“What’s going on?” Bai Zhi was confused when she saw the Netherworld Ring shatter into pieces. The Fox Demon and the others’ expressions also changed.

The person in black robes didn’t say anything. He merely spread his fingers and absorbed the shattered pieces into his palm.

Then he suddenly smashed the shattered pieces into the ice table.

“Bai Zhi, you’ve been fooled.” A dark voice came from the black robe.

“What?” Bai Zhi was stunned.

“This is not the Netherworld Ring. It’s just a fake.” The person in black robes’ voice was filled with displeasure.

Hearing the words, Bai Zhi collected herself and she looked at the shattered pieces that were smashed into the ice table. Though it just seemed like black, the corners of the broken pieces were obviously dark gray.

“Fake? How could that be? I brought it back personally, it was with me the entire time,” Bai Zhi said.

The person in black robes just scoffed. “Nothing went wrong during the process of you bringing it back, this thing was a fake from the beginning.”

Bai Zhi’s face blanched.

“How dare the Ancient You Clan use a fake to fool me!”

No one would have thought that the Netherworld Ring would be a fake. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“So... the Holy Lord of Shadows was speaking the truth?” The Fox Demon’s brows furrowed.

They didn’t think that the Ancient You Clan would have the guts to act against the Crimson League, but things turned out to be different from what they thought.

“The Ancient You Clan is too brazen! How dare they attempt to fool the Crimson League!” Bai Zhi gnashed her teeth angrily. She wanted to ruin the Ancient You Clan when she learned that she had been fooled by the humans of the First Domain.

“Could this be the Holy Lord of Shadows’ plan? Could the Netherworld Ring have been a fake in the first place?” the Fox Demon asked.

The person in black robes shook his head.

“If it wasn’t for the Ancient You Clan’ sudden interception, the Netherworld Ring would have landed in our hands.”

The Temple of Shadows would be courting their own death if they were to hand the fake ring to the Crimson League. The person in black robes’ guess wasn’t wrong, but he hadn’t figured out Ye Qingtang was behind the Ancient You Clan’s interception.

“So Mo Yao’s words are reliable? The Ancient You Clan is this ambitious and the Crimson League is nothing to them now. They started by snatching something belonging to us and now they fooled us with a fake...” The Fox Demon’s expression darkened.

The person in black robes didn’t say anything. He got up all of a sudden and flew out of the cave. Bai Zhi and the other alien race followed behind.

Outside the Ancient You Clan’s valley.

Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan remained in the forest for quite some time. She lifted her eyes to look at the skies now and then, waiting for the arrival of the three people from the Crimson League.

She was determined to see it with her own eyes.

They didn’t make Ye Qingtang wait that long.

In just a while, the mutant Wind Snake appeared in the skies.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes lit up.

They’re here!

There were a few guards from the Ancient You Clan guarding at the entrance of the valley. The two wardens hadn’t left yet, but You Qiong was already nowhere to be seen.

The two wardens were still troubling over the mess they’ve gotten themselves into. When they heard some sounds, they immediately turned back and saw the huge mutant Wind Snake in the sky. It was charging towards the valley!

“What is that?”
