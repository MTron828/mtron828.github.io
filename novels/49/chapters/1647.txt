Chapter 1648: Island of Immortal Footsteps (3)

With a glance, the Jiang Family youths noticed many other extraordinary talents in the other ancient clans. They were about the same age as them, but many of them had already established a name for themselves.

“Yiran, you don’t seem to be very fond of Qiu Chen.” Someone sensed the change in Jiang Yiran’s expression after seeing Qiu Chen

Jiang Yiran tugged his lips and replied. “No. I like him to death.”

Qiu Chen seemed to have sensed Jiang Yiran’s gaze as well, and he smirked nonchalantly when he looked over.

Jiang Yiran almost flared up. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“This fellow seriously deserves a beating. If I could defeat him, I would have beaten him to a pulp,” Jiang Yiran said with gritted teeth. He met Qiu Chen once and was completely thrashed by Qiu Chen. As Jiang Yiran had always been a prideful person, he was extremely infuriated upon meeting his enemy now.

Jiang Yanyun cast a glance at the furious Jiang Yiran and subsequently looked away.

The Qiu Clan and Baili Clan echoed after each other, and although their words seemed very courteous on the surface, they were filled with mockery.

Elder Qian and the rest were very displeased, but it was not the right place to act up.

On the other hand, the talented youths of the Jiang Family were shooting lasers with their eyes at the other two ancient clans as they were young and had never experienced such ridicule before.

“That Qiu Clan elder is so annoying. He has the audacity to bark here, but if he meets the Domain Monarch, I think he can’t even laugh then.” Jiang Yisheng was extremely irritated with the other two ancient clans.

Although there were many talented people in the younger generation of the Jiang Family, there were only a rare few who were outstanding, and the numerous defeats that the Jiang Family suffered only served to fuel the arrogance of the other top ancient clans.

Ye Qingtang maintained an indifferent expression as she watched the situation before her. She was very clear that unless the Jiang Family had enough numbers of powerful talents to suppress the other clans in the Martial Arts Championship, the other ancient clans would just become increasingly arrogant.

“It’s late already, and they still need to rest. Elder Qian, we will not disturb you anymore. Please take care of us if we meet in the Martial Arts Championship in the next few days.” Elder Qiu laughed heartily and chatted with the Baili Clan elder for a while before leaving.

Elder Qian only managed to suppress his fury after exerting tremendous willpower. Then, he immediately led the youths of the Jiang Family deeper into the Island of Immortal Footsteps for the island servants to arrange their lodging.

There were still a few days before the Martial Arts Championship began, and a few ancient clans still had not arrived.

Not long after they were allowed to rest, Jiang Shaobai immediately looked for Ye Qingtang to explore the island. Two other familiar-looking youths came along.

Just like that, a group of four strolled around the island.

“I heard that the owner of this Island of Immortal Footsteps is extremely mysterious. Apart from the Martial Arts Championship where it is opened to the public for a period of time, this place cannot be found in the rest of the year even if one knows where this island is located.”

“I heard from those who came here before that there were many mysterious Cave Abodes on this island. I wonder what exactly is inside though? The owner does not seem to encourage us to walk around the island either. Why don’t we look for treasures during this period of time instead?” The two youths began mumbling about the rumors surrounding this island.

Only the top ten contestants of the Martial Arts Championship could enter the mystic realm, and these ten people would definitely be the top talents of various ancient clans.
