“So what if I am impudent! Putting aside the matter of whether my daughter really broke the family rules, even if she did, I would like to see who dares to touch a hair on her head while I am present!” Mo Yi’s half-hooded eyes swept across everyone present. Her arrogance was intimidating.

“You!” Elder Meng’s face darkened, and the spirit energy around him suddenly started to ripple.

Jiang Liu, who was standing nearby, saw that Elder Meng and Mo Yi were about to fight. He advanced and said, “Second Sister-in-law, Tang Tang was really in the wrong in this matter. Tang Tang has just returned to the Jiang Family. Second Sister-in-law. Surely, you do not wish Tang Tang to suffer in the Jiang Family in the future?”

“What a joke. How can my daughter remain in the Jiang Family?” Mo Yi laughed coldly.

Jiang Liu’s head started to ache. He really could not deal with his second brother and sister-in-law.

“Second Sister-in-law, this was just a joke among the children, and there is no need to take it too seriously. Elder Meng only spoke in a fit of anger just now. Tang Tang only needs to apologize, and the matter will be resolved. It’s rare for you to pay a visit to the Jiang Family. There is no need to do this.”

“Tell me, who did Tang Tang injure?” Mo Yi suddenly asked.

Jiang Liu said, “She injured our Elder Brother’s son, Yiming.” As he spoke, Jiang Liu pointed at Jiang Yiming, who was still pale.

Mo Yi glanced at Jiang Yiming.

When Jiang Yiming’s gaze met Mo Yi’s eyes, he subconsciously shrank back.

Mo Yi curled her lip mockingly.

“Third Brother, do you think I’m stupid? This fellow is already in the Heavenly Venerate realm, but my daughter is just in the Eight Heaven of the Arcane Supremacy realm.”

Even an idiot could tell who would win when oppressed by someone nearly a realm apart.

Jiang Liu had also thought that this matter was unbelievable, but Jiang Yiming’s haggard look was certainly not put on. Just now, Elder Meng had not questioned them closely before pronouncing judgment, so he did not know what had actually happened.

Jiang Liu asked, “Tell us what happened just now.”

The youths who had been so aggressive were all terrified by Mo Yi’s intimidating stance. Jiang Yiming subconsciously glanced at Ye Xun, and Ye Xun knew that Jiang Yiming wanted her to speak, so she braced himself and spoke.

“We were going to visit Elder Sister You together, but on the way, we met Ye Qingtang. It was the first time Brother Yiming and the others were meeting Ye Qingtang, so they wanted to greet her. But she not only did not appreciate our kindness, but she even mocked us. Brother Yiming and the others tried to reason with her, but she suddenly struck him.”

When Jiang Liu heard that, he looked at Mo Yi. He was just about to say something when Ye Qingtang, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke.

“Third Uncle, why don’t you ask me what happened just now?”

Jiang Liu was taken aback. He had subconsciously chosen to believe Jiang Yiming and the others, so he had deliberately overlooked Ye Qingtang.

Mo Yi laughed softly. “Tang Tang, you tell us.”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Ye Xun, you stay in the east garden, as does Ye You. You said that you met me along the way, but I stay in the west garden. Since you were looking for Ye You, why were you passing by my place?”

The statement from Ye Xun and the others was full of loopholes. Ye Qingtang had not pointed them out previously because she knew that even if she did, Elder Meng and Jiang Liu would still side with Jiang Yiming and the others. No one would believe her.

But now, the circumstances were different.

Her “mother” was back. She had someone to back her up!
