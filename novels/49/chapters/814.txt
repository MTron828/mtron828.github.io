Chapter 815 Master (1)

However, Ye Qingtang could still vividly remember what Perfected Xuanchen told her before he died: she had no spirit root, and her martial gift was too weak. As such, only by working one hundred or even one thousand times harder than others and becoming even more powerful than others would there not be anyone who would dare to bully her again…

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang cultivated by Perfected Xuanchen’s side. Her foster father had already died then, and in that homeless and miserable situation, she was accepted as a disciple under Perfected Xuanchen, and she treated him as her father over the years.

The tired-looking Perfected Xuanchen before her eyes no longer seemed to be the mighty person from before and was instead a worn senior who only wanted to protect Falling Sky Valley’s safety.

A long time later, Ye Qingtang could not stop herself from calling Perfected Xuanchen.

Perfected Xuanchen was fully concentrated on reviewing the files and did not even notice that Ye Qingtang entered the hall.

It was only after Ye Qingtang called him did he look up in her direction instinctively.

“You’re here.” Perfected Xuanchen rubbed his tired eyes and said.

Then, Ye Qingtang headed into the hall and looked at the files on the table. “Master, have you been reviewing the files for the whole night?”

Perfected Xuanchen smiled faintly. “Your Eldest Senior Brother, Gu Yihan, is still not experienced enough, and I can only settle these urgent files myself.”

“Master, you should pay attention to your health and rest more. Do not over-exhaust yourself. You can let Eldest Senior Brother shadow you so as to learn and be able to handle all these miscellaneous matters in the valley,” Ye Qingtang said with a frown.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words and looking at her expression, Perfected Xuanchen was slightly taken aback. For some reason, perhaps a wrong impression, Ye Qingtang cared for him like a son would for his father.

At that instant, Perfected Xuanchen suddenly thought of his daughter who died ten years ago…

“Ye Chen, there’s no harm. I am still very young, aren’t I?” Perfected Xuanchen placed the documents down and chuckled.

Ye Qingtang walked to his side as he spoke and took the initiative to grind ink while handing a brush to him.

Noticing it, Perfected Xuanchen shook his head with a smile.

Although this disciple of his became his disciple not long ago, he always felt that there was an inexplicable intimacy for some reason, as though the two of them had known each other for a long time.

Ye Qingtang was grinding ink for Perfected Xuanchen while Perfected Xuanchen was focused on reviewing the files, and he chatted with Ye Qingtang from time to time.

“Chen, where are your parents?” Perfected Xuanchen asked suddenly. This was the first time he called her this name, which perhaps was an involuntary reaction due to that trace of intimacy.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed after hearing that.

On this mainland, Ye Qingtang only had one foster father, and she was unaware of her birth parents.

She only had a brief clue that her mother was perhaps that lady who once appeared in Nine Nights Dynasty…

As for why she appeared in the Ye family, the origins of her mother, and name of her father, Ye Qingtang did not know anything about them.

“I only have one foster father.” Ye Qingtang replied honestly after a long time.

“Foster father?” Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang meaningfully.

“Master, actually, ‘sea of clouds at Mount Qin’ is merely an excuse,” Ye Qingtang said.

To Perfected Xuanchen, Ye Qingtang did not wish to utter a single lie.
