1326 Force Him to Revolt 1

Ling Yan could not help but chuckle at Ye Qingtang’s reply.

“Holy Son Ming Wang should have reached the capital by now. You need to do your best in playing the role of the Holy Lord, Miss Ye.”

“…” Upon hearing of Ming Wang’s arrival, Ye Qingtang’s lofty ambitions fell apart.

In the entire Temple of Shadows, Ming Wang was her largest source of pressure.

He had never trusted her from the start and even sent Lady Ghost to monitor her.

And now, he actually came personally. Just great.

“You’ll have to be careful then. As the Holy Lord of Shadows, I will definitely support the Eldest Prince to ascend as the Crown Prince.” Ye Qingtang sighed. The Temple of Shadows was a double-edged sword, and it would not be so easy for her to wield it to her advantage.

“Just bring it on, Miss Ye. I can still handle it.” Ling Yan replied with a light-hearted laugh.

Sighing, Ye Qingtang did not say anything much and kept the voice transmission stone.

The conversation with Ling Yan today changed her mindset.

Previously, all she wanted was to escape from the Temple of Shadows, but now…

She must become the Holy Lord of Shadows.

…

As expected, the Eldest Prince and the rest did not abandon the thought of ruining Ling Yan after their foiled scheme. They had tried different ways over the past few days. However, not only were they unable to touch Ling Yan at all, but they were even counter-attacked by him.

In half a month, Ling Yan’s position as the Crown Prince was rather secure thanks to the “assistance” of the Eldest Prince and Second Princess.

“Elder Ye… Ling Yan’s position is increasingly secure in my father’s heart. Ah…” The Eldest Prince wore an ugly expression in the hall.

Despite joining forces with the Second Princess, the Eldest Prince’s schemes had no effect at all and, helpless, he could only look for Ye Qingtang again to request for her help.

Ye Qingtang was very speechless as she looked at the gloomy faces of the people in the hall.

She finally realized what an incompetent teammate was like…

Only people with their brains could come up with those pointless plots. She really doubted if they were truly Ling Yan’s siblings.

Why was there such a great difference in their intelligence despite being born from the same parents?

“Stop all the plans on your hands. Otherwise, Ling Yan’s position as the Crown Prince will only be more and more stable.” Although Ye Qingtang had a smile on her face, there was a certain strictness in her tone.

Noticing Ye Qingtang’s actions, Lady Ghost discreetly looked over to a corner.

Nonetheless, this casual action of hers did not escape Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Ye Qingtang did not move, but the side of her eyes glanced over to the direction which Lady Ghost looked at. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A hardly-detectable aura of death lurked in the dark.

It’s Ming Wang?

Ye Qingtang pondered in her heart and recalled her conversation with Ling Yan the other day. She secretly took a deep breath and looked at the Eldest Prince as though she did not notice Ming Wang’s presence.

“Given Ling Yan’s current position, the only way you all can defeat him is to force him to revolt.”

“Revolt?” The Eldest Prince and Second Princess were taken aback.

“But… Ling Yan is not a fool, and father dotes on him so much now. Additionally, his position as the Crown Prince is so stable right now, and he will become the next Emperor once father is old. Why would he take such a risk?” The Second Princess asked with a frown.
