1389 Difficult to Refuse Such Kindness 3

Everyone felt that this was an excellent suggestion. Worshiping an immortal was already a deep-rooted mindset, and if they could find a true immortal to worship, they would be more than willing… However…

It was all up to the Immortal.

The Immortal just exposed the Dragon Court Sect and was evidently an immortal who did not care about fame or fortune, unlike the avaricious and insatiable Dragon Court Sect. Had the Dragon Court Sect not courted death and offended the Immortal, she would not have cared about these matters.

Looking at everyone’s nervous expressions, Ye Qingtang was about to tear up from laughter on the inside.

Was this not her objective of coming to Floating Island?

She exposed the Dragon Court Sect previously to lay a foundation for this.

As long as she got rid of the Dragon Court Sect, her identity as an immortal would be solidified. Given the customs of the citizens on this mainland, wouldn’t they worship her?

However…

In order to display her immortal demeanor, Ye Qingtang still had to keep up with her act.

Everyone did not receive Ye Qingtang’s reply and could not help but be a little worried.

“Immortal Su, what Emperor Qi said makes sense. We understand that you’re unwilling to interfere with the mortal affairs, but on the account of all humans in the world, please show some benevolence…” The Yuan Kingdom Emperor did not object Emperor Qi and supported him unusually.

After all…

It would definitely be beneficial for the Yuan Kingdom if Immortal Su built a sect!

“Don’t worry, Immortal. We will not interfere with anything you do and will definitely go to all lengths to fulfill your orders.”

“Right, right, right. We will listen to all of your arrangements.”

“Even if you don’t have the time to teach us, you only need to allow us to occasionally listen to a few words that you say.”

The Emperor also hurriedly pleaded for the Immortal to stay in order to save their reputation.

Ye Qingtang thought that it was about enough and immediately replied with reluctance. “Forget it. Since you all are so sincere, I will just build a sect. However… I have no intention to manage the minor matters of the sect…”

Hearing that Ye Qingtang finally caved in, everyone was delighted and did not dare to trouble Ye Qingtang.

“It’s alright! There’s no need. You just need to keep your mind on cultivating. We will handle the rest.”

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

“You must be exhausted after everything today, immortal. Please get some rest and let us handle the things here.” The Emperors were truly content this time. So what if they lost a quack? They nabbed a true immortal this time round!

Seeing that things were settled, Ye Qingtang did not decline and immediately rode the white tiger to her rest place.

Everyone was filled with reverence as they looked at the huge white tiger beneath Ye Qingtang and felt the tremor from its footsteps. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“The Immortal’s mount… is indeed extraordinary. I only saw the Immortal carrying a little white tiger in her arms, but unexpectedly… this little white tiger can transform into such a gigantic creature in an instant…” An Emperor lamented as he had never seen such a ferocious mount like the white tiger before.

“How can the Immortal’s mount be an ordinary animal? It must definitely be a divine animal!”

The white tiger who was not far away heard the discussion, and its ears twitched silently.

“F*ck. I am a Fiendcelestial Beast! A bunch of ignorant people…”

Ye Qingtang chuckled lightly. According to the current situation, she would accomplish the third mission in no time once her sect was formed.

After all…

In order to recover their reputation, those Emperors and powerful figures would definitely promote the new sect enthusiastically.
