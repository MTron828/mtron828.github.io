Ming Wang had his suspicions regarding the Nine Souls Ring incident, so he ordered the Master of the Hall of Justice to go to the dungeons to interrogate Mu Shi.

“Reporting to the Holy Son, the human says that he did not swap the Nine Souls Ring. I also searched his space ring and found no trace of the Nine Souls Ring,” The Master of the Hall of Justice reported. It was just a simple sentence, but anyone who had suffered his torture would not be able to hide any secrets.

Ming Wang frowned slightly. The suspicions in his heart were not yet dispelled.

“There’s one more thing…”

“Speak.”

“The Luo Family sent an invitation to tomorrow’s birthday banquet for their Grand Elder.” As he spoke, the Master of the Hall of Justice placed the invitation in Ming Wang’s hand. “I am informing the Holy Son because the Holy Lord is resting, and I am afraid to disturb her.”

Ming Wang took the invitation. A strange look flashed across his black eyes.

“The Luo Family… Luo Qufeng must be more than a thousand years old now?” Ming Wang suddenly asked.

The Luo Family was one of the ancient clans in Central Mainland. Their foundations were solid, and their Grand Elder, Luo Qufeng, was outstandingly powerful. His position in this mainland was a lofty one.

The Luo Family had nothing to do with the Temple of Shadows. Although their bases of power were close to each other, they usually minded their own business.

“Yes,” the Master of the Hall of Justice said.

Ming Wang narrowed his eyes slightly, as if he suddenly thought of something. “Since that is the case and since the Holy Lord has just returned to the Temple, she might as well take the opportunity to let the outside world know that she has returned. Send this invitation to the Holy Lord.”

The Master of the Hall of Justice was somewhat taken aback. He took the invitation and brought it to Ye Qingtang’s sleeping chambers.

In her sleeping chambers, Ye Qingtang was familiarizing herself with the Holy Lord’s behavioral patterns. Fortunately, there were many portraits of the Holy Lord in the sleeping chamber. Together with Ling Yan’s description, Ye Qingtang began to grasp some of the Holy Lord’s expressions.

Ye Qingtang opened the room door in response to a knock and took the Luo Family’s invitation from the Master of the Hall of Justice.

Ye Qingtang could not help but frown slightly when she saw Luo Qufeng’s name on the invitation.

Ye Qingtang had known this Luo Qufeng in her previous life.

He was an extremely talented and powerful figure in Central Mainland. Now, he must be about a thousand years old. In her previous life, he had been a powerful tyrant in this mainland.

In her previous life, the truth about Ye Qingtang’s Heart of the Demon God had been revealed sometime after she had arrived in Central Mainland. This Luo Qufeng had ordered the Luo Family to pursue her in an attempt to rob her of the Heart of the Demon God.

Ye Qingtang had narrowly escaped death a few times, but they had all been close calls.

But it turned out that…

In this life, she was going to attend Luo Qufeng’s birthday banquet in the capacity of the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang was not stupid. She guessed that this invitation was another test. In the Temple of Shadows, she could use the excuse of remaining in her sleeping chambers to escape observation.

But if she went out…

Sure enough, the next afternoon, Ye Qingtang saw a group of Undead standing in the main hall of the Temple of Shadows. There were about a dozen of them, and one of them was the Hall Master.

These Undead were chosen to accompany Ye Qingtang to the Luo Family to present her good wishes.

On the surface, they were accompanying her, but Ye Qingtang knew that Ming Wang had sent these Undead to secretly observe her.
