“Am I…. seeing things? Did Ye Qingtang actually spin the wheel four rounds?!”

“Four rounds…. Doesn’t this mean she’s at least innate stage seven? But… I thought her spirit root shattered?”

A frenzy of speculations exploded among the crowd like the tumultuous chaos of a thunderstorm.

No one expected Ye Qingtang to be able to turn the Sky Wheel initially. However, she actually managed four full revolutions right in front of their eyes!

That had even exceeded Duan Tianrao’s results by a whole round!

Everyone was completely stunned by what they had witnessed.

This included Ye Ling, who stood astounded beneath the stage with his eyes wide opened. This was all beyond him. Not only was his daughter capable of turning the wheel… she was able to achieve four full revolutions!

Ye Xun, who had sat back and watched with her eyes rolling initially, anticipated Ye Qingtang failing and become a laughing stock, but after witnessing her display, the gentle smile she put on earlier went rigid.

How could this be?

How did Ye Qingtang possess such strength?

Wasn’t she without a spirit root?

Her shock stirred up her penchant to turn to Duan Tianrao who was standing beside her. But as expected, he had a face filled with astonishment like the others.

Duan Tianrao could never imagine Ye Qingtang would surpass him by an entire level in strength.

Duan Tianrui was stupefied as well. But, when he saw the crowd standing in awe of Ye Qingtang, who remained nonchalant on stage, a look of contempt flashed across his face. While everyone was confounded by her performance, Duan Tianrui voiced his opinion suddenly:

“Miss Ye, today’s the Day of the Sabbath. The purpose of our noble families here is to present our blessings to the people of the City of Lin. But you’re still wearing that face veil without any intention to reveal your appearance. Isn’t that kind of disrespectful?”

Once Duan Tianrui’s words were spoken, the crowd seemed to regain their senses and realized Ye Qingtang had been wearing a face veil all along.

At that moment, everyone began to raise a questioning eyebrow.

“Her strength’s a shocker indeed.”

“Strength’s not everything. Haven’t you heard, she’s notorious for her hideous appearance? Otherwise, why do you think Duan Tianrao would break up with her?”

“True. Strength’s secondary for a girl. Looks are of primary importance. Regardless of a girl’s strength, if no one could bear to look at her, she’s unsuitable to be a First Lady. Ye Xun, on the other hand, is pretty and possesses considerable strength. A girl like her is then worthy of the people’s affection.”

With Duan Tianrui’s digression, everyone’s attention was quickly diverted from Ye Qingtang’s display of strength to her appearance. Their curiosity was well-founded because she had always worn a face veil in public. As a young lady of the Ye household, if she was not hideous, why would she need to hide her face?

As the crowd changed their subject of speculation, Duan Tianrao had recovered considerably from his astonishment. He turned instinctively to look at Ye Xun, his beautiful wife-to-be standing beside him, and only then did the shock he had finally recede.

Duan Tianrui was trying to hide his growing smirk after his diversionary tactic managed to succeed. He believed he had driven Ye Qingtang into a corner when she remained speechless over all the ensuing provocations. He became elated and added to the pressure instead.

“And Miss Ye, you are presenting a blessing on behalf of your household. Removing that veil from your face is only proper, if your household honors the rite, that is.”

Ye Qingtang gave the belligerent Duan Tianrui a cold-eyed glare, with a condescending sneer on her lips.
