Chapter 551 Blood Moon Holy Lady (3) RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Suddenly, the Blood Moon Sect did not appear to be so frightening as to how it was described in the rumors. Today, if the Blood Moon Sect did not offer help, the Xuanling Sect might have been exterminated.

The Blood Moon Sect was exterminated by a few hundred super sects together a thousand years ago just because it was too powerful. It ruled the world, and every sect had to pay tribute to the Blood Moon Sect every month.

The young geniuses in the world all worshiped the Blood Moon Sect. They wanted to join the Blood Moon Sect to follow the Blood Moon Holy Lord. It was a huge honor to have a look at the Blood Moon Lord…

That was the reason why the Martial culture of the sects declined slowly. More and more geniuses refused to join sects, and the sects would fall eventually in the long run…

In the end, a few hundred sects combined forces and decided to exterminate the Blood Moon Sect.

To this day, no one could say whether it was the Blood Moon Sect that messed up the rules or the few hundreds of sects that messed up the orders of the world.

The Blood Moon Sect was called the Heretic Sect for hundreds of years after it was exterminated. As the descendants who did not participate in the incident, no one knew the exact details.

However, when everyone was still in shock…

A thunder-like voice reverberated in the surroundings.

“Blood Moon Holy Lord, where are you going to run to now?!”

As the voice was heard, a white-haired elder in a cloth gown appeared.

Ye Qingtang was stunned as she saw the elder. She had met the elder a few days ago as well…

When the Blood Moon Division Head Jiang Chen and Shuo Tianzang witnessed the elder clearly, they seemed to be facing their greatest enemy.

“The Ultimate Elder?!”

Even the Blood Moon Holy Lord frowned.

The Ultimate Elder waved his arm, and a ray of white light appeared in the sky, dashing towards the blood barrier.

People of Yunxiao Sect and Lingyun Sect suddenly returned to normal at the same time.

However, their memories seemed to remain at the moment when the Blood Moon Holy Lord appeared.

“Run!”

One of the Yunxiao Sect elders shouted in fear.

Ye You’s face was cold, and she took a glimpse at Ye Qingtang unwillingly. She withdrew her sight when she saw the Blood Moon Holy Lord beside her.

Hundreds of figures swiped through the sky and disappeared in the next second.

“What’s the point of running away?!” The Ultimate Elder frowned and shouted.

People of the three super sects had disappeared, and no one saw the appearance of the Ultimate Elder.

“A batch of cowards.” The Ultimate Elder humphed.

“Are you done with chasing?” The Blood Moon Holy Lord finally said something.

“Are you done with running?” The Ultimate Elder smiled coldly.

People of the Blood Moon Sect stared at each other. No one dared to take a move without the words from the Holy Lord.

“Blood Moon Holy Lord, I stopped you from killing innocent people back then, and you wanted to kill me. You chased me for five hundred years… You shouldn’t forget about that, right,” the Ultimate Elder said.

“Same for you,” the Blood Moon Holy Lord said indifferently.

“Hehe, it’s lucky that I ran fast enough. If not, I would be killed by you. You mis-entered the Qi Deviation five hundred years ago as you cultivated the fiend skills. You were not able to beat me anymore, and the wheel turned. From then on, I also chased you for five hundred years. To be fair, you run faster than me back then!” the Ultimate Elder said.

Ye Qingtang was shocked by what she just heard.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord and the Ultimate Elder disappeared for a thousand years… And that was the reason…

The two legends on this piece of land chased each other for five hundred years respectively. This was… another kind of romance…
