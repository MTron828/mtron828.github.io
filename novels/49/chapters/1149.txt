Chapter 1150: Ultimate Elder (2)

“Enough nonsense. Let’s fight to the death.”

Ultimate Elder etched out a symbol with his hand, and the twisted space started to press towards golden-robed man.

A strange lotus-shaped demonic flame suddenly surfaced around the golden-robed man and burned the surrounding space.

“Extraordinary Flame…”

When he saw that, the Ultimate Elder frowned slightly.

Before the Ultimate Elder had time to think, the golden-robed man had already escaped the twisted space. He pointed at the Ultimate Elder.

When he saw that, the Ultimate Elder grunted coldly and also reached out with his finger.

When the two fingers met, an earth-shattering explosion rang out.

As she watched the fight between the Ultimate Elder and the golden-robed man, Ye Qingtang swiftly concluded that the Ultimate Elder and golden-robed man were both powerful cultivators at the same level.

Like the golden-robed man, the Ultimate Elder possessed the power of a Heavenly Venerate. Apart from that, he had also cultivated the extremely mysterious Space Technique.

This Ultimate Elder had lived for many years in this mainland. If not for the lack of spirit energy in this mainland, he would have already become a powerful cultivator in the realm of a Holy Venerate. It was already a miracle that he had forcibly cultivated the power of a Holy Venerate while in the realm of Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang could see that the Ultimate Elder was not losing to the golden-robed man. As he raised his hands, space ripped and poured out wildly like rain, forcing the golden-robed man to retreat. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Not bad. Carry on.” A burning luster surfaced in the golden-robed man’s eyes. He laughed wildly as his entire person immediately shot skywards.

“Chaotic Fury!”

At that instant, an Extraordinary Flame in the shape of a lotus flower surfaced around the golden-robed man. He pointed at the sky and laughed coldly.

As the golden-robed man spoke, endless flames rapidly fell from the void above.

“Devour Space!”

When he saw that, the Ultimate Elder right hand forcefully grabbed at the void.

The next second, the space within a radius of a hundred meters was torn, and black holes appeared. All the flames were absorbed into them.

“Space Return!”

The Ultimate Elder’s finger dabbed lightly in front of him, and the lotus-shaped Extraordinary Flame that had been absorbed by the twisted space now rushed towards the golden-robed man.

“Good, good, good… this is interesting.” The golden-robed man’s lips arched upwards. The lotus-shaped Extraordinary Flames that had surfaced around him absorbed the Extraordinary Flames that were heading for him in all directions.

“You are truly powerful. If you were not limited by the spirit energy in this realm, you would probably be powerful enough to fight me. A pity that you will die here today.” The golden-robed man laughed coldly.

Swoosh!

Before the Ultimate Elder could speak, Ye Qingtang flicked numerous crimson flames towards him.

In the void, the crimson flames soon transformed into the color of black ink.

“You think too highly of yourself.”

When he saw that, a trace of disdain surfaced in the golden-robed man’s eyes. Compared to his lotus-shaped Extraordinary Flame, the power of all flames were futile.

The golden-robed man waved his right arm, and a tongue of lotus-shaped Extraordinary Flame rushed forth.

But to the shock of the golden-robed man, the black flames instantly devoured his lotus-shaped Extraordinary Flame.

Boom, boom!!

There was a loud crash as the black flames that were filled with the aura of extermination exploded.

The golden-robed man was too close and was caught off-guard. The aftershock of the black flames’ explosion forced him to retreat by dozens of meters.

“Extraordinary Flame?!”

The golden-robed man looked at Ye Qingtang in some surprise.
