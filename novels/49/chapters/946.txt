“I will not let such a thing happen,” Ye Qingtang said as determination filled her eyes.

Ye Qingtang had an extremely special attachment to this mainland, regardless of whether she was a citizen here.

In this mainland, there was the Ye family who raised her, the sects where she learned her skills from; there were too many sentiments as well as feelings attached.

Ye Qingtang lived two times, and if she could not even protect this mainland, what was the meaning of her rebirth?

Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang, whose attention was successfully diverted away, and a smile fleeted across his eyes. Then, he said calmly, “I originally wanted to destroy this mainland directly, but since you’re unwilling to, then forget about it. Currently, two out of the three great inheritances in this Dragon Vein belong to you. This trip can be considered to be successful and completed.”

Ye Qingtang was thankful for Ling Yan about this. Without Ling Yan’s assistance, she would definitely be unable to obtain such destinies on this trip. Not only did she gain the original Phoenix Bloodline inheritance and the Heavenly Demon inheritance, she even seized the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline from that girl in green.

Ling Yan’s words truly faded Ye Qingtang’s intention to slap him by a large amount.

She faintly sensed that whatever Ling Yan said a while ago seemed to be diverting her attention, but what was speechless was…

What he said was really not simple.

Furthermore…

As the saying went…

To receive a gift was to sell one’s liberty.

Moreover, with Ling Yan’s skills, her slap might just kill him.

“Let’s go quickly. With the three great inheritances in the Dragon Vein all gone, the three major forces on this mainland will definitely be alarmed. There’s no need to continue creating more problems.” The little azure dragon advised.

Ye Qingtang fully agreed with what it said. The Peerless School, Phantom Valley, and Beiming Manor were the most powerful forces of this mainland. Even with Ye Qingtang’s current cultivation base, she might not be able to stand any bargain if she fought all three of them head-on.

Half a day later, Ye Qingtang and Ling Yan left the Dragon Vein and reached a deserted land before they entered the Dragon Vein.

“Ling Yan, did you come to this mainland just for the Dragon Vein?” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan and asked.

“My goals…” Smiles filled Ling Yan’s eyes as though nothing happened at all before, and he replied slowly. “There are too many goals but almost all are achieved… Naturally, destroying this mainland was one of my original objectives, but it was rejected by you. That is also my only unaccomplished goal.”

“Of course, the greatest goal for coming to this mainland is still you, Miss Ye.” Then, Ling Yan’s eyes naturally landed on Ye Qingtang as a seeming smile formed on his face.

Regarding Ling Yan’s shocking remarks from time to time, Ye Qingtang had already chosen to consciously ignore them.

In this Dragon Vein, Ye Qingtang once saw her past in the Puti Tree, where she ultimately learned that the person who helped her to be reborn was not anyone else but Ling Yan.

In this entire world, Ling Yan was probably the only one who could achieve such a remarkable feat with his Karma Bloodline.

Although Ye Qingtang was curious and wished to know why Ling Yan helped her to be reborn, she was unable to ask such a thing currently.

After all, the person who allowed her rebirth was the Ling Yan from her previous life and not the current one. Even if she questioned him now, Ling Yan might not know anything either, and there would be no point in asking then.
