“What is your name?” The Array Faction elder asked.

“Zhou Qu,” replied the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

The Array Faction elder frowned slightly. There were some disciples in the outer sect who were learning about the profound meaning behind array formations, but Zhou Qu’s name was not in the list.

“You want to challenge the Thunder Formation? Are you aware that this array formation is dangerous and that you may lose your life in the array if you’re not careful?”

Although the Thunder Array was provided for the sect disciples to challenge, those who dared to attempt it had learned about array formations. Moreover, the Thunder Array was lethal, and if the disciple had not grasped the main points, he or she would definitely be either killed or severely injured.

Forget about Zhou Qu, a disciple whose name was not recorded in the Array Faction at all, only a few of the disciples who studied array formations dared to attempt it.

“I am aware. Please give me a chance, Elder.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder felt extremely aggrieved.

He was a dignified Blood Moon Sect Elder yet had to be so subservient and speak humbly to two useless sect elders!!

If this was in the past, he could kill them with just the wave of a finger.

If not for that goddamn Ye Qingtang’s threat, he would only attempt the whatsoever Thunder Array if he had nothing better to do.

In terms of skills, the Blood Moon Sect Elder was simply unable to enter the top ten on the Excellence Roll, and even if he did, he had already missed the assessment this year. To prevent Ye Qingtang from sending people to beat him up daily, he could only use this method.

Was it not just an inner sect of a sect!

As a Blood Moon Sect Elder, would he need to use brute force if he wanted to go in?

Elder Huang and the Array Faction elder exchanged a look. Although they thought that Zhou Qu was a little weird, they eventually agreed after considering for a while.

After all, the Thunder Array was originally for disciples to challenge.

After obtaining the permission from the two elders, the Blood Moon Sect Elder finally attempted the Thunder Array.

Watching the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s “brave and heroic” back view, Elder Huang and the Array Faction Elder could only shake their heads.

They only felt that Zhou Qu was seeking death and was not too bothered with him.

The two elders returned to the topic that they were previously talking about.

However…

Before they talked for long, a warden rushed over with a weird expression. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Reporting elders, that Zhou Qu…”

“What happened? Is he injured in the Thunder Array? Just order a physician to take a look. That will do,” said the Array Faction elder calmly.

However, the warden shook his head hurriedly. “No, Zhou Qu is not injured, and he… already solved the Thunder Array.”

“What?” The Array Faction elder was alarmed!

Zhou Qu actually really solved the Thunder Array?

How much time had passed since he left?

Then, the Array Faction elder’s expression changed slightly. Looking at Elder Huang who was similarly surprised, he said, “Elder Huang, I did not expect Zhou Qu to solve the array. Moreover, he solved it in such a short amount of time. I need to report this to Elder Qin of the inner sect immediately. I’ll take my leave first.”

Then, the elder from the outer sect Array Faction left.

Elder Huang was a little dazed.

Solving the Thunder Array was something that only elite inner sect disciples who specialized in array formations had a possibility of accomplishing!

Unexpectedly… Zhou Qu actually had such amazing talent in array formations.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder solved the Thunder Array within an extremely short span of time, displaying his high attainment in array formations. This traveled into the ears of Elder Qin, the inner sect’s Array Faction elder, and on that afternoon, the Blood Moon Sect Elder was given an exception to be accepted as a disciple under Elder Qin.

There was a burst of discussions in the outer sect the moment the news was passed out.

The very first moment the Blood Moon Sect Elder was brought into the inner sect, he saw Ye Qingtang, who was staring at him with a devious smile.

“We meet again, Senior Brother Zhou.” Ye Qingtang smiled devilishly. She did not think that the Blood Moon Sect Elder would enter the inner sect so quickly. It seemed that Senior Brother Qin and the rest did “take care” of him relatively “thoroughly.”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder whom Ye Qingtang did dirty to could only clench his teeth secretly.

Only ghosts would want to meet you! How I wish I do not need to see you again for the rest of my life!
