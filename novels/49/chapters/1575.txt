1576 Cultivation 4

“I wish to go to the sacred ground,” Ye Qingtang said.

The moment she spouted those words, the youths who ignored her focused their eyes on her for the first time and looked at her with odd expressions.

“You have honor points?” One of the youths asked doubtfully.

Ye Qingtang could tell his disbelief but did not take it to heart.

“The sacred ground? Which sacred ground do you wish to go to? The Taiyuan Valley’s sacred ground is split into five canyons, and each of them has a different cultivation effect. The better the effect, the more honor points required.” Jiang Shaobai explained.

“I haven’t thought about it yet. I’ll take a look then.” Ye Qingtang only had ten thousand honor points and still did not know how many honor points were required for each of the five valleys, so she still needed to take a look before deciding.

Biting the ends of the chopstick, Jiang Shaobai took a look at Ye Qingtang and did not say anything else.

Ye Qingtang left first after finishing her meal. Although she originally wanted to rest for a day, she abandoned that idea and headed to the sacred cultivation grounds at once.

She did not have any more time.

Once Ye Qingtang was out of everyone’s sight, those youths finally spoke.

“Shaobai, this Ye Qingtang’s endowment is mediocre and is the bottom among all the youths in the bottom. Why are you always with her?” A youth frowned rather unhappily.

If not for Jiang Shaobai, they would never interact with someone with mediocre talent like Ye Qingtang.

Jiang Shaobai did not rush to reply. Rather, she took a sip of water at her own pace, wiped her mouth slowly, and finally replied. “I’ll hang out with whoever I want. Since when was it up to you all to tell me what to do?”

Her tone was calm but devoid of the usual clarity and more loaded with gloom.

Those youths sharply sensed Jiang Shaobai’s unhappiness and immediately changed their words.

“Shaobai, we did not mean to tell you what to do. You also know that Jiang Yanyun and those bunch of people are up to something recently. The Martial Arts Championship is in five months, and I heard that the people on Jiang Yanyun’s side are working extremely hard for it. We don’t wish for Jiang Yanyun to obtain a spot in the Martial Arts Championship. In terms of endowments and innate talent, no one else is better than you in the entire Taiyuan Valley...”

“That’s right. If you were the same age as Jiang Yanyun, that fellow would already have been crushed by you. He is so arrogant now only because of the fact that he has been in the valley since young.”

“Why waste time on that Ye Qingtang? If you like her, the few of us can just give her some advice. You can just set your mind at rest and prepare for the Martial Arts Championship.”

To these youths, they simply had no idea why Jiang Shaoba treated Ye Qingtang so differently, and neither could they understand what she was thinking. They only treated it as though Jiang Shaobai was interested in Ye Qingtang.

There was truly no need for Jiang Shaobai to waste time interacting with a teenage girl that just entered the valley with low skills and endowment.

“That’s right. If you think highly of her, we can just train with her.” Everyone else agreed.

Given Ye Qingtang’s realm, she would benefit greatly when any one of them provided a few tips.

“I know what I’m doing. Instead of nagging over here, why don’t you all scram back to cultivate? I heard that you all fought with Jiang Yanyun’s people and that the outcome was not too good.” Jiang Shaobai cast them a look.

Everyone laughed awkwardly.
