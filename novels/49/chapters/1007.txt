Chapter 1008 Reform (2)

However, Ye Qingtang was clearly aware that given her father’s personality, he still required some training to control the powerful figures of the Ye Family.

Nonetheless, Ye Qingtang was not overly worried either. After all, Ye Ling’s daughter was a Yang Lord, and even if those Yin Yang Perfected Lords pledged allegiance to the Ye Family, they definitely had to obey Ye Ling.

“Good… Very Good!!” Delight filled Ye Ling’s eyes. His dream of several decades was actually about to be fulfilled…

Ye Ling had a warm disposition, and his daughter and family clan were his only priorities. His dream was to bring the Ye Family to greater heights under his leadership. Today, thanks to his daughter, the Ye Family was about to rise greatly and become a super family clan!!

However, Ye Ling could not help but worry. He could become the Clan Master of the Ye Family partly due to luck, but this time, he was unable to control those senior members who were chased out by Ye Qingtang. Would he be able to control the powerful figures who were to pledge allegiance to the Ye Family in the future then…

Yet, thinking about it carefully, even a Yin Yang Perfected Lord would probably not harbor any evil designs should they know that his daughter was a Yang Lord.

The only reason why those powerful figures would be willing to join the Ye Family would be because of the fact that Ye Qingtang was a Yang Lord. Since that was the case, who would be so insensible to offend a Yang Lord’s father?!

At this thought, Ye Ling was completely at ease.

“Great Elder.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Great Elder who was still dumbfounded and called him softly.

“Huh… Huh?!”

The Great Elder only returned to his senses when he saw Ye Qingtang walking towards him.

To the Great Elder, the lady before him was not just Young Lady Ye but also an unrivaled Yang Lord of this mainland!

A while ago, the death of that Qinglin Sect Grand Elder completely stunned the Grand Elder. To cultivators of their level, a Yin Lord of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm was already considered a supreme God, yet Ye Qingtang killed the Grand Elder in a second. Even more so, this lady was the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family. It was truly a massive shock.

“What are you thinking about, Great Elder?” Ye Qingtang looked at the elderly beside her and asked.

“Eldest Young Lady… It’s nothing…” The Great Elder shook his head repeatedly.

Ye Qingtang had a pretty good impression of this Great Elder. When the Long Family came, the Great Elder still placed the family clan’s honor as the first priority. Although his own grandson was severely injured by the Duan Family, he still had a heart.

“This spirit pill is for treating a Yin Yang Perfected Lord body. Dan Yifan was heavily injured from competing for the Ye Family previously. An ordinary spirit pill would take several months for him to recover. This spirit pill will allow him to recover fully in just a few hours and will not damage any of his martial foundations.” Ye Qingtang smiled. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“This…”

The Great Elder looked at Ye Qingtang, astounded and overwhelmed by her favor. The lady before him was a Yang Lord, and she actually gave him a spirit pill on her own initiative and was so friendly to him. All of this seemed like a dream…

“Thank… Thank you Eldest Young Lady!” Agitation was written all over the Great Elder’s face as he accepted the spirit pill with trembling hands.

“Bring it to Dan Yifan to treat his injuries first,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Alright! I’ll go take a look at Yifan first then!” The Great Elder was worried about Dan Yifan’s injuries at the mention of his name.

After gaining Ye Qingtang’s permission, the Great Elder turned and left.
