Chapter 895 Take Advantage of Others (1)

The man who was called Feng Wuya produced a fake smile and said, “That’s her blessing.”

“Feng Wuya!!”

Gu Tianhe clenched his teeth and stared at Feng Wuya in rage. How he wished that he could tear him to pieces right now!

Li Bingxue was on the same mission as them, and later, they encountered others from the Supreme Academy. Soon afterward, Li Bingxue left the group for some personal things. However, no one expected that she would meet Feng Wuya of the Divine Virtual Academy halfway.

Feng Wuya was not just a normal disciple of the Divine Virtual Academy. He was the grandson of the Grand Elder, who belonged to the reclusive ancient Feng clan of the Central Mainland. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The ancient Feng clan was highly ranked in the Central Mainland. Very few forces in the entire Central Mainland dared to provoke them, not mentioning the mediocre students of the normal academy.

Among the reclusive clans, there were at least a few Heavenly Venerates that were above the Arcane Supremacy to preside over the clans. Their martial abilities were unpredictable.

As the grandson of the Grand Elder, Feng Wuya’s position in the ancient Feng clan was easy to predict. He was not willing to learn anything, but he was very arrogant and abusive in the Divine Virtual Academy due to his identity. No one dared to say anything to him.

Gu Tianhe would never talk to such an arrogant heir under normal circumstances. However, no one expected that…

Li Bingxue would encounter Feng Wuya on her way.

What was even more unimaginable that Feng Wuya had a wicked idea after noticing Li Bingxue’s beauty. He raped her under violence and murdered her ruthlessly afterward!

“Junior Brother Gu.” The first man of the Supreme Academy shook his head seriously as he looked at Gu Tianhe.

“Senior Brother Li Xiu… Feng Wuya is just a bastard. He raped Junior Sister Li and murdered her mercilessly… We…” Feng Wuya clenched his fist and said. The veins on his forward clearly showed his anger and resentment.

Li Xiu’s face was very serious, but he could not do anything

If the person was just a normal disciple of the Divine Virtual Academy, they would definitely take revenge for Li Bingxue.

However…

Feng Wuya was not a normal person.

Feng Wuya had the Feng Clan’s bloodline. If they hurt him today, everyone who was present would be dead in the near future. Even the entire Supreme Academy would not dare to provoke the Feng clan.

They would use their lives to repay if they hurt him. They could not do anything to him.

Feng Wuya sneered as he saw the reactions of the Supreme Academy students. He wandered towards Feng Wuya.

Feng Wuya arrived in front of Feng Wudang in a few breaths’ time.

Disdain filled Feng Wuya’s eyes as he raised his arm slowly.

Pow!

Feng Wuya raised his hand and slapped Feng Wudang’s face.

“You…”

Feng Wudang glared at Feng Wuya and intended to say something.

Pow!

Before Feng Wudang could say another word, another slap landed on his face. Feng Wuya’s face was expressionless, but his eyes were filled with scorn.

“How dare you clowns confront Senior Brother Feng here! Do you still want to be alive in this world?”

A few young disciples of the Divine Virtual Academy mocked the Supreme Academy disciples, who did not dare to talk or move.
