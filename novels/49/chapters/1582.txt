1583 Black Witch 1

An eerie, dead silence instantly fell on the noisy bar. Everyone’s eyes were fixed on Ye Qingtang.

The mouth of the embarrassed and angry burly man was filled with blood after his fall. He raised his head and was about to curse at her.

Then, he saw the beautiful young girl standing under the lamplight. Her long black hair was loose, and her black eyes were slightly narrowed.

With just one glance.

The burly man grew extraordinarily frightened. He quivered as he kneeled on the floor as if he had seen something terrifying.

A strange mood hung over the bar, and there was an unprecedented dead silence. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“...” Had she been too rough? Ye Qingtang could not help but feel puzzled as she looked at the frozen crowd.

She could not see any spirit energy moving around these people. The spirit energy in this world was average. From the way the men in this bar fought, Ye Qingtang could only describe their fighting abilities as barbaric.

The God of Nature was having fun. When he saw that the place had come to a standstill, he landed on Ye Qingtang with laughing eyes.

Ye Qingtang had a feeling that this fellow was up to no good.

A few slender men sneaked out of the back door of the bar when they saw that no one was paying attention to them.

Ye Qingtang had no intention of making a scene here. When she saw the crowd’s strange reaction, she thought that she had better leave.

In any case, she now had a basic understanding of this world.

But before Ye Qingtang could take a single step, the surrounding people shrank back in terror. They looked at her as if they had seen a ghost.

Did they have to look so terrified even if her appearance was somewhat different from them?

For the second time in her life, Ye Qingtang doubted her looks.

Am I so terrifying?

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to find out why they were so afraid of her. She turned and made her way to leave this foul place.

Ye Qingtang had just walked to the door, but had not yet stepped across the threshold, when she suddenly saw a hunchbacked old woman wearing tattered old clothes. The old woman suddenly rushed in front of Ye Qingtang, and her wrinkled face was filled with terror and anger. She took out a silver hexagram and squeezed a shrill scream from her throat:

“You detestable servant of the devil! You are surrounded by holy light. Don’t you dare spread disaster to our city!”

Devil? Servant? Disaster?

Ye Qingtang did not understand what the old woman was talking about, but she could clearly see that the old woman was glaring at her with the same expression that some self-righteous people in the First Mainland used when attacking a heretic sect.

“We must not allow this evil black witch to leave. She has succumbed to the wiles of the devil and has abandoned God’s guidance. Her appearance here will destroy our little town!” The old woman screeched in self-righteous tones as if she was prepared to fight the devil to death.

“Since she is already here, she has planted the seeds of a curse. The plague will come soon. We can only break the devil’s curse by burning this black witch. We must not allow her to leave!” The old woman roared with all her might.

What black witch, what curse... Ye Qingtang was completely confused by the old woman.

As the old woman bellowed, the terrified people in the bar recovered their wits. It was as if the words “the plague will come soon” had caused even greater terror.
