Chapter 1067 Mirror of Illusions (3)

The Beiming Manor elderly was extremely pale from the blow and spat out blood as he fell from the sky to the ground.

Realizing the situation, the other Beiming Manor elderly was alarmed and did not dare to stop for a second. He sped up and flew with all his might, disappearing in the blink of an eye.

Ye Qingtang did not continue to pursue that Yang Lord who fled away and instead landed from the sky and stood before the heavily-injured Beiming Manor elderly.

It was this person who spoke cleverly to make her put down her guard and then targeted her with a lethal strike.

“You…”

The Beiming Manor elderly was as pale as a dead person as he watched Ye Qingtang warily. Never had he expected that this lady’s combat power would be this large and powerful. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The previous plan was for him and the other Yang Lord to join forces. If they could convince Ye Qingtang to join Beiming Manor, then they would leave it, but if they were unable to convince her, they had to kill her right there and then.

Nonetheless, no one had expected that even when he joined forces with another Yang Lord, in the end, they were also not Ye Qingtang’s opponents and were defeated by her…

“One should not harbor any murderous thoughts. If careless, the one who dies will be yourself,” Ye Qingtang looked at the heavily injured Beiming Manor elderly and scoffed.

“You dare to kill me?!” The Beiming Manor elderly’s expression darkened. “You and Beiming Manor have not reached the irrevocable stage. If you kill me, Beiming Manor will definitely be after your life in the future… Can you take on Beiming Manor on your own?!”

“I don’t want to have any relations with Beiming Manor at all, but you all will not leave me alone. Since that’s the case, don’t blame me for putting up a strong resistance.”

As she spoke, she did not even give the Beiming Manor elderly any reaction time and waved her Regicide Sky Blade.

In an instant, the Regicide Sky Blade chopped the Beiming Manor elderly’s head, and a Yang Lord of the Beiming Manor died like that.

Beiming Manor’s loss of a Yang Lord was not as simple as just the death of a powerful figure.The three mighty forces of this mainland had four Yang Lords each, and this resulted in a counterbalancing effect where no party could do anything to another.

Nonetheless, now that Beiming Manor lost a Yang Lord and only had three Yang Lords remaining, it would no longer be on the same level as Phantom Valley and Peerless School, and they were, at the very least, weaker than the other two great forces.

If Phantom Valley and Peerless School learned of the death of this Yang Lord, the consequences would be disastrous. Once one of the three mighty forces were weakened, it would definitely face the invasion of others. This was the law of the jungle and also an unchangeable fact of the struggle between forces.

Ye Qingtang believed that Beiming Manor would not have any time to deal with Phantom Valley and Peerless School, much less herself.

She searched through the Beiming Manor elderly’s body and kept his space ring. Subsequently, she shot up into the sky and flew towards the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Given Ye Qingtang’s current speed of a Yang Lord, it merely took half a day for her to fly from the Formidable Heavens Dynasty to the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Apart from resolving the internal and external crisis of Falling Sky Valley, Ye Qingtang could perhaps spread the news that Beiming Manor lost a Yang Lord to Phantom Valley and Peerless School…

However, once Ye Qingtang returned to the Nine Nights Dynasty, she would probably have some conflict with Peerless School to help Falling Sky Valley.
