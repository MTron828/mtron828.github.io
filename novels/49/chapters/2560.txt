Long Yun looked at the black-robed elder and pondered for a moment before saying, “The woman I brought back is identical to the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon.”

“Identical…” Surprise flashed across the black-robed elder’s eyes.

“So what do you intend to do?” The black-robed elder asked.

Since Long Yun brought that woman back, he must have his reasons.

“That’s hard to say.” Long Yun shook his head. “From what I know, that Paragon doesn’t seem to have a partner. Of course, it’s impossible for outsiders like us to know so much.”

“Do you think that the woman you brought back might be the daughter of that Paragon?” The black-robed elder seemed to be in deep thought. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“There are many possibilities. Being the daughter is only one of them. There might be another possibility,” Long Yun continued.

“For example?” The black-robed elder asked Long Yun.

“Is it possible that Paragon died and was reincarnated into a human? And this woman I just encountered happened to be the reincarnation of that Paragon,” Long Yun said.

The black-robed elder looked at Long Yun with a faint smile. “Of course it’s possible, but I don’t think it would be the case. If the Paragon died, I believe that her reincarnation won’t end up in our hands. Do you think those people from the Temple of Paragon are fools? Furthermore, the Temple of Paragon has some connections with the Sea Clan. The Sea King’s divine artifact is in the hands of the Temple of Paragon. Every once in a while, the Sea King will personally visit the temple to maintain the divine artifact. If that Paragon really died, how could the Sea King’s treasure remain in the temple? Also, quite recently, the Sea King personally visited the Temple of Paragon for the Paragon’s birthday celebration. It’s said that they even played a game of Sea Soul Chess together.”

Long Yun pondered for a moment after hearing the black-robed elder’s words. He nodded slightly and said, “You have a point, I was careless. In that case, that woman might just be a coincidence.”

However, the black-robed elder shook his head. “That might not be the case. We don’t have a lot of connections with the Temple of Paragon. There might be a lot of things we do not know.”

“Indeed, our Dragon Emperor Clan doesn’t have much of a relationship with the Temple of Paragon. We don’t know each other very well,” Long Yun said. “Actually, compared to their Paragon, I think that the woman is more similar to Jiuyuan in terms of words, actions and mannerisms. They are exactly the same as Jiuyuan’s back then. Even though her appearance is identical to the Paragon… If Jiuyuan’s children had not already returned to the Dragon Emperor Clan, I might have thought that she was Jiuyuan’s child.”

“Then what do you plan to do now?” The black-robed elder asked.

Long Yun pondered for a moment before saying, “Initially, I wanted to inform the Evil Deity of this matter. However, I feel that there’s no need now. I will allow her to leave in two days.”

“There’s no rush.” The black-robed elder stared at Long Yun and said softly, “Keep this woman here for the time being. We’ll talk about it when the Evil Deity comes out of seclusion. Even if that woman has nothing to do with that Paragon, she might be useful in the future if she stays in the Dragon Emperor Clan.”

“Well… we will have this woman stay here as a disciple then,” said Long Yun.
