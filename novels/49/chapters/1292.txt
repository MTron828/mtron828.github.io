Chapter 1293: Engagement (1)

Engagement?

When Ye Qingtang heard the Eternal Emperor’s words, her heart somehow skipped a beat. A strange feeling suddenly arose in her heart, and she involuntarily looked at Ling Yan.

Only to see Ling Yan smile at the Emperor.

The Emperor gestured, and a moment later, a tall, extremely beautiful girl walked slowly into the hall from a side room. The girl was exquisite-looking, and under the lamplight, her delicate skin looked especially flawless.

“Elder Brother Yan.” The girl looked straight at the handsome Ling Yan, her eyes filled with emotion.

Ye Qingtang involuntarily looked at the girl and received a mild shock.

Mo Yunxian. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang had met this girl in her previous life.

Mo Yunxian was the daughter of General Mo of the Eternal Dynasty.

General Mo was one of the top generals in the Eternal Dynasty. He commanded a million valiant troops and was one of the Eternal Emperor’s most favored subordinates.

Mo Yunxian was extremely beautiful. In fact, she was known to be the most beautiful woman in the Eternal Dynasty.

Mo Yunxian was also incredibly confident of her looks. In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had met Mo Yunxian once in the Central Mainland academy. At that time, Ye Qingtang had regained her looks, and her great beauty had irritated Mo Yunxian.

Mo Yunxian had ordered someone to destroy Ye Qingtang’s looks. Fortunately, Ye Qingtang had fled in time to avoid Mo Yunxian’s destruction.

But it turned out that…

Ye Qingtang and Mo Yunxian would meet again in this life, under completely different circumstances.

What was even more surprising was that…

Mo Yunxian is actually Ling Yan’s fiancée?

She had not even known that Ling Yan had a fiancée. But then, she realized… Ling Yan had no need to report to her…

For some reason, Ye Qingtang felt as if she was choking. She subconsciously swallowed some wine to try to remove this feeling.

“Ah Yao… no need to force yourself to eat these things. I’ll find some Black Flame Worms for you later…” Ming Gu watched as Ye Qingtang gulped her wine and looked at her rather worriedly.

Ye Qingtang’s gut wrenched at the mention of Black Flame Worms. The choking feeling in her heart instantly vanished.

“I’m alright.” Ye Qingtang smiled at Ming Gu. She secretly broke out in a cold sweat.

No matter what she thought, Lady Ghost was still next to her. Fortunately, Lady Ghost had not noticed anything. If not, she would have given the game away.

She could barely save herself now, so she had no time for wild thoughts.

Ye Qingtang immediately cleared her mind of these messy emotions and prepared to look on with composure.

So what if she is his fiancée!

While Ye Qingtang’s emotions were running amok, Mo Yunxian had walked over to Ling Yan and gently sat down next to him.

Ling Yan looked at his fiancée but continued to secretly observe Ye Qingtang’s every move from the corner of his eye. When he saw Ye Qingtang gulp down her wine, an amused look involuntarily surfaced in his eyes.

But the amusement was too deeply hidden, and no one noticed it.

When the Eldest Prince and Second Princess saw that the Eternal Emperor’s good news referred to Mo Yunxian’s return, they relaxed.

After all.

Both the Advisor and the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows were present today. Ling Yan certainly would not be made Crown Prince.
