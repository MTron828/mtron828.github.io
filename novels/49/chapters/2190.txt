Chapter 2191: Stop Joking (3)

Feeling Ye Qing’s gaze, Yun Chen suddenly snapped out of his trance. He lowered his eyelids with a hint of awkwardness.

Damn.

He had been too impulsive. He didn’t realize it would embarrass Teacher Ye.

Ye Qingtang continued to look at Yun Chen and the sudden changes in his expressions. She had no idea what this kid was thinking and just continued to go about her task. “You don’t have enough medicinal herbs here. I could only gather what was here and only managed to cultivate one cypress elixir.”

Yun Chen suddenly lifted his eyes and stared at Ye Qing incredulously.

At this moment, Yun Chen finally realized that the medicinal herbs which had been scattered on the floor had all been gathered up and arranged on the table.

Yun Chen always had a good idea of just how many herbs he had on hand. With one glance, he could tell that he was missing the exact proportion of ingredients to make a cypress elixir.

Yun Chen gaped. For a long while, he remained in a speechless daze.

Teacher Ye had cultivated this cypress elixir?

How was that possible...

Yun Chen was filled with doubts. But it wouldn’t be appropriate for him to voice them out to Ye Qing. And so he just nodded and let it pass.

Never mind. If Teacher Ye wanted to keep up this facade, he would not expose him.

“Your bloodline affects your cultivation of medicines. But you should have no problem preparing the ingredients right?” Ye Qing suddenly asked.

Yun Chen nodded.

Ye Qing took out a few medicinal herbs and passed them to Yun Chen.

“Prepare these.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Yun Chen accepted the herbs and couldn’t help giving a soft sigh. Teacher Ye probably didn’t even know how to prepare medicinal herbs. That was why he had found an excuse for him to do it.

The missing portions of ingredients for the cypress elixir... he had probably ruined them... He was probably worried about losing face and so placed a completed elixir on the tripod.

Nevertheless...

Even if Teacher Ye wanted to pretend, he shouldn’t have used a Grand Master-level cypress elixir...

Yun Chen sighed in resignation and started to prepare the herbs.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang stood by the side observing how Yun Chen prepared the herbs. It must be said that although his success rate at refining medicines was poor, Yun Chen had invested a lot of time and effort in trying.

As a result, he was extremely adept at preparing the medicinal ingredients. He was also very meticulous. Even Ye Qingtang was able to feel it in his actions.

Before long, Yun Chen had finished prepping all the herbs. He truly had no idea why Ye Qing would suddenly wish to refine elixirs. He just resigned himself to assisting him.

Ye Qingtang arranged the prepped ingredients.

Yun Chen cleared his throat softly. “Teacher Ye, is there anything else? If not, may I leave first? Yun Chen spoke up tentatively.

The words made Ye Qingtang frown.

“Leave? If you want to be an alchemist, you must stand by and observe when someone else is refining elixirs. It is how you will learn. You are not allowed to go anywhere. Stand there and observe carefully.”

Yun Chen: “...”

Was Teacher Ye sure about this?

Yun Chun was only doing this for Teacher Ye’s own good. With Yun Chen standing here, Teacher Ye wouldn’t get a chance to swap in an already-completed pill.

Yun Chen felt exasperated but since Ye Qing had instructed so, he could not just leave at will. He had no choice but to stand there with a sigh.

Ye Qingtang had no idea what Yun Chen was thinking. She was fully focused on the ingredients gathered before her. With a practiced hand, she picked up a few from each pile.

Yun Chen’s brow furrowed deeper as he watched.

The herbs which Ye Qingtang had picked possessed characteristics which clashed with each other. It would be impossible to refine them together.

If these herbs were forcibly refined together, not only would it fail to become an elixir, it might probably end up being a lethal poison...
