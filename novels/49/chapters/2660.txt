Chapter 2661 I’m Here To Kill You (6)

Even Ye Qingtang, who was standing afar, could feel the destructive power in Han Cangming’s eyes. She could not help feeling a chill run down her spine.

This terrifying destructive power was probably enough to instantly destroy an Immortal Emperor’s physical body.

Ye Qingtang could not help feeling anxious.

She did not know how powerful Demon God Han Cangming was, but he was an existence who was on par with the Heavenly Emperor…

Two beams of destructive light shot out from Han Cangming’s eyes, shooting directly towards the Paragon.

However, the Paragon looked extremely calm as if she did not take those light beams seriously at all.

The Paragon’s right palm moved slightly and the destructive light beams suddenly disappeared into the void. No one knew where they went.

“Space Transfer…”

Ye Qingtang was surprised.

The Paragon had already cultivated her terrifying Space Technique to a level that ordinary people could not even comprehend.

Just like the Mirror of Illusions, which could turn all magical powers into matter. However, one had to have precise control when using it. Furthermore, it could only be used once in a while.

However, the Paragon’s Space Transfer was different. It could render all divine abilities and techniques useless. All abilities would be instantly teleported into space. No matter how terrifying a divine ability was, it was useless against the Paragon.

“I see how it is,” Han Cangming muttered as he witnessed the disappearance of his light beams.

“All energy attacks and divine abilities in this world are meaningless to me.” The Paragon was expressionless as she waved his right hand. “The power of your divine ability is not bad. I didn’t do anything to deserve it, so I’ll return it to you.”

Swoosh!

As the Paragon spoke, the void in front of her shattered and a piercing sound swept in all directions.

Ye Qingtang saw the destructive light beams, which had been transported away by the void, appear again. This time, the direction of the light beams’ attack was no longer towards the Paragon but toward Han Cangming.

At this moment, there was no way to avoid the destructive light beams.

Han Cangming pointed his finger and collided with the destructive beams.

“Boom!”

Multiple explosions rang out incessantly as dust flew up into the air from the ground. The nearby mountain ranges were shattered and huge rocks tumbled everywhere. It was a terrifying sight.

After the dust settled, Han Cangming stood rooted to the ground as he sized up the Paragon. “To be able to cultivate to such a level in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, you have truly reached an unprecedented level. I must admit I’m impressed,” said Han Cangming.

The Paragon sneered. “You have a way with words. Should I thank you for your compliment?”

“You’re too polite.” Han Cangming shook his head. He continued with a smile, “The Space Technique is already at the acme of perfection in your hands. I agree with what you said just now. All forms of energy attacks in this world are already meaningless to you.”

“So?’ The Paragon asked indifferently Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“So, how will you respond if I don’t use any energy-type divine power?” Han Cangming smirked.

Without giving the Paragon a chance to think or speak, Han Cangming’s body suddenly disappeared from where he stood. At the same time, a terrifying palm wind surged towards the Paragon.
