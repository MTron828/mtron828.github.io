Chapter 1896: Massacre (2)

“Where did everyone go?” Little White Tiger also found it very strange.

As Ye Qingtang pondered the situation, the faint scent of blood suddenly drifted into her nostrils. That scent had originated from the nearby practice hall. Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang walked over to the hall.

The main doors to the practice hall were closed. Standing outside, Ye Qingtang could not hear any sound at all.

Stepping forward, Ye Qingtang pushed open the door. Her fingers made contact with something sticky on the handle. She pulled back her hand and saw that her fingers were stained a deep brown.

That sticky stain gave off an intense smell of blood.

“Is this... blood?” Ye Qingtang was stunned.

The door handles of the practice hall were deep brown and any bloodstains on the surface were not immediately noticeable.

A sense of unease suddenly arose in Ye Qingtang’s heart. She pushed open the door and was completely thunderstruck by what she saw inside.

Nearly a hundred rotting corpses were piled inside the large practice hall...

Dried blood had pooled beneath those corpses and the smell of blood and rotting flesh permeated the entire space.

“What happened?” Wide eyes took in the hellish scene before her. Those corpses were garbed in the uniform of the Jiang family disciples.

Ye Qingtang surveyed the debris left behind in the practice hall. She gasped when her gaze landed on a familiar face.

“Jiang Yisheng...”

Jiang Yisheng had collapsed in a corner of the practice hall. A huge splatter of blood stained the wall behind him. He laid limply against the wall, that handsome face completely drained of all color. One arm was visibly broken while white maggots feasted upon his open flesh wounds. Meanwhile... he remained completely still, as if in a coma or dead.

No...

Jiang Yisheng was dead.

And he had been dead for quite some time.

Ye Qingtang felt like a huge rock was pressing down on her chest. It was so heavy that she couldn’t breathe.

Nearby, Jiang Yiran and Jiang Yanyun’s bodies were piled together. The cheeky Jiang Yiran had his entire lower jaw ripped off. Left with only half a face, his eyes remained wide open in a vicious expression.

One of Jiang Yanyun’s hand was under Jiang Yiran’s body. He had collapsed face down and a gaping hole could be seen on his upper back. The hole penetrated all the way through to the front of his chest. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

It looked like he was trying to lead Jiang Yiran away but failed to escape the nightmarish scene.

What the hell happened?

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with shock. Everywhere she looked, the morbid scene of death met her eyes. All of these Taiyuan Valley youths were talented and gifted practitioners.

Especially Jiang Yanyun. His abilities were on par with the most powerful practitioners of his generation in Central Mainland.

What kind of people... could kill all of them in such a terrible manner?

Even Jiang Yanyun didn’t manage to escape?

“What... happened here? How did all these people end up dead?” Little White Tiger was also stunned by the scene.

They had gone to the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm, only to return and find everyone in Taiyuan Valley dead?

Ye Qingtang looked extremely grim. A startling thought suddenly entered her mind.

“Sh*t, Shaobai!”

Ye Qingtang didn’t know who killed everyone here. She also didn’t know if those people were still in Taiyuan Valley.
