Chapter 2052: Pagoda (3)

Although Ye Qingtang couldn’t hear what he was saying, there was no way she could get closer.

But she had personally seen Ming Di and Little Luo Xue battling to the death before. He was powerful enough to fight Ming Di as an equal, which meant that his strength was tremendous.

Little Luo Xue stood tall. Whether it was due to Elder Yuan’s words or not, he blinked and started walking towards a pagoda some distance away.

Seeing that he was walking off on his own, her heart jolted. She quickly gathered Ning Luo and they started following him in the dark.

Little Luo Xue stopped in front of a pagoda. He opened the door and walked in.

The pagoda was strange. Even though it looked just like the others, there were no guards outside of it.

Exchanging knowing glances, Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo moved slowly towards the pagoda. They entered it easily since there were no guards around.

The moment she entered, she could feel a strong power surrounding the entire pagoda. It was a familiar yet strange feeling.

This feeling...

She had felt it before.

It was when she had accidentally stepped into the Hell of Avicinaraka...

She couldn’t understand this feeling.

“There is a strong force in this pagoda.” Ning Luo looked at the floating lights in the pagoda.

The entire inside of the pagoda seemed to be infused with some sort of energy. Ning Luo felt an extreme sense of familiarity with the power...

It was from her Spiritual Abode.

Just as they were about to ascend the pagoda to take a better look, Ning Luo suddenly felt some movement in the power within the pagoda.

He quickly grabbed Ye Qingtang and flew out of the pagoda.

Little Luo Xue descended from the top of the pagoda just as they left. His gaze swept over the pagoda but he didn’t notice anything amiss.

He looked blankly at the entrance of the pagoda and raised his hand, about to open the door and head outside for a look.

But just as he was about to open the door, a loud, crazed shriek came from above.

His expression tightened for an instant as he heard the shriek. Without a care for anything else, he quickly flew up and rushed towards the top of the pagoda.

Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo could hear the screams despite having left the pagoda. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“What’s that sound?” Goosebumps appeared all over her skin as she heard the cries. They couldn’t make out the gender of the person screaming at all. If anything, the scream did not even sound human.

The shriek seemed to be able to pierce a person’s soul and make them tremble.

“Look at the pagoda,” Ning Luo said as he narrowed his eyes.

As the shrieks echoed through the air, there was a change in the pagoda, and this soon spread to the other pagodas.

The white glow slowly became red.

Strong surges of power came from the pagodas.

The red light was accompanied by immense power, which gradually spread from the top of the pagodas to the underground world.

Soon enough, the top of the underground world was soon covered in red light, enshrouding the entire underground world in a crimson red glow.
