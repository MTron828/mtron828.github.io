Chapter 1458 Extermination 3

Jiang Qin would not let Mo Yi have any chance to harm Ye You.

Jiang Shun did not say anything, which implied silent consent to Jiang Qin’s suggestion.

The Domain Monarch would come out of seclusion three days later, and even if Jiang Lang came back, the Domain Monarch would not allow him to mess around.

“Eldest brother, you all…” Jiang Liu wanted to say something when he saw that the situation was off.

But Jiang Qin cut him and said, “Third brother, you watched Yiming grow up. Can you bear to see him in this state now?”

“This…” Jiang Liu was in a daze.

“Mo Yi already said that she will dig You’er’s spirit root three days later. In the past, she and Jiang Lang killed Elder Meng’s son as well. Are you not clear about these, third brother? Mo Yi ultimately does not share our family name, but she harmed our clan members repeatedly. Are you really going to stand up for someone with a different family name?” Jiang Lang snickered.

Jiang Liu was speechless.

After discussions, they headed straight to the west garden immediately.

Ye You planned to follow them as well, but Ye Xun pulled Ye You fearfully.

“Sister You, it’s better for us to not go. That Mo Yi…”

Seeing that others had left, all the remorse and guilt left Ye You’s face.

“What are you afraid of? No matter how powerful that Mo Yi is, how can she win against Aunt Qin and so many of them? Once Mo Yi dies, Ye Qingtang will no longer have a backing. I must see how she dies tragically today.”

Ye Xun thought that it made sense as well and did not say anything much. Then, she followed Ye You and headed there as well in hopes of seeing Ye Qingtang die.

In the west garden, Mo Yi asked Ye Qingtang about her childhood after consuming the medicine. The two of them laughed and sighed from time to time and seemed to have a close mother-and-daughter relationship. Even Beidou Demon Lord was envious of them.

But at this time, Mo Yi’s gaze suddenly changed.

The two demon fox servants at the door tightened their grip on their weapons vigilantly at this instant as well.

“Mother?” Ye Qingtang vaguely sensed that there was something wrong when she saw that Mo Yi’s expression changed.

Mo Yi patted Ye Qingtang’s hand. “I’m here.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Afterward, Mo Yi rose immediately, and the tightly-shut door was unlocked instantly with the flick of her sleeves.

Outside the door were Jiang Shun and the rest.

The warmth in Ye Qingtang’s eyes faded immediately when she saw the ill-intentioned people, and she stood beside Mo Yi.

“F*ck! They’re here to stir up trouble!” The little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arm knew that the situation was bad when it saw these people appearing together.

A smile flashed across Mo Yi’s pale face as she glanced at the speaking little white tiger. She then looked up at the people outside the door.“Why? Are you all unwilling to wait for three days? Are you all returning Ye You’s spirit root to my daughter?”

Jiang Shun squinted his eyes and glared at Mo Yi with malice.

Jiang Qin scoffed. “Mo Yi, you’re still so muddleheaded with death at hand. This is the Jiang Residence. You behaved recklessly however you wanted, ruined the descendants of the Jiang Family, and violated the family rules repeatedly. Today is the day where you will repay for all your sins.”

“Ha…” Mo Yi chuckled as she looked at the gloomy Jiang Shun. “Is Jiang Yiming killed by a single move from me? Did you all hurry here for his funeral?”

Jiang Shun’s expression became increasingly contorted.

“Mo Yi, I always refused to haggle with people like you on the account of my second younger brother. However, you injured my son severely today, and I must settle this score.”

“So he’s not dead…” Mo Yi shook her head faintly and smiled. “Your son bullied my daughter. It’s truly a pity that I could not kill him.”
