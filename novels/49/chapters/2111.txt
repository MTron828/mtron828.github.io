Chapter 2112: Congratulations (3)

Ye Qingtang had seen with her own eyes people from the Temple of Paragon decorating the place as well. She had also seen from the water mirror many Clans coming to participate.

A sudden sense of foreboding struck her.

Could it be what she was thinking?

Elder Hua didn’t seem to have any intention of saying anything further. The image in the water mirror suddenly changed to focus on the inside of the Sky Temple.

There were already many powers gathered in the huge temple, and she spotted someone familiar in the sea of faces.

There were a few men dressed in red robes with the wind totem embroidered on their sleeves.

“The Wind Sect?” She narrowed her eyes as she looked at them.

She remembered that in her first life, Ye You had worshiped the Wind Sect and had become a strong empress under their guidance.

The Wind Sect was one of the top powers of the Second Domain. Even the Crimson League would have to step back when confronted with them.

Elder Hua heard her murmur and her eyes immediately fell on the people from the Wind Sect. In the main hall, they were looking extremely humble and cautious as they saw the other powers.

Elder Hua’s eyebrows furrowed slightly. “The Wind Sect?” She tapped gently on the water mirror.

The Head of the Wind Sect was standing with a few Elders by his side in the main hall, all traces of his former arrogance gone. He smiled as he nodded at a few other powers.

However...

No one seemed to care about them and treated them like they weren’t even there.

“Sect Master... Is that the Buddha of the East Buddha Temple? He... came over personally to celebrate the birthday of the Holy Lord of the Temple of Paragon?” one of the Elders from the Wind Sect whispered to another big-bellied Elder as he spotted someone in a cassock.

“It’s not just the East Buddha Temple. The North Darkness Pavilion, the Shadow Moon Sect... aren’t they all here?” The Wind Sect Elder forced himself to keep calm as he said this but his words were still laced with emotion.

It was the Temple of Paragon after all. Just the Holy Lord’s birthday was enough to draw out the most mysterious and powerful forces of the Second Domain. It was difficult to even see them usually but here they were, gathered together.

This only demonstrated the esteemed position of the Temple of Paragon.

“We’re just missing those from the Dragon Emperor Clan,” another Elder said.

“The mainland that the Dragon Emperor Clan is on is too far away and the Temple of Paragon only released this news seven days ago. Furthermore, the Dragon Emperor Clan’s position is about the same as the Temple of Paragon, so there’s no need for them to be here personally...”

The Wind Sect Elders’ emotions were in turmoil. They thought that they had just been listed as one of the top powers of the Second Domain but this made them realize that any power there could easily oppress them.

Just as the Wind Sect had determined to forge a good relationship with the Temple of Paragon, a few Temple of Paragon attendants suddenly walked out of the temple and walked over to them. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Please leave at once. You are not on the guest list,” the attendant said with a cold face, eyes devoid of emotion.
