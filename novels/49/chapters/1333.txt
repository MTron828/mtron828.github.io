1334 First Move 3

At that moment, the Eternal Emperor was grimly looking at the letters that the Eldest Prince, the Eldest Princess, and the Second Princess had handed him.

These letters were private correspondence between Ling Yan and General Wu Hu. Their contents were treasonous and heinous.

The Eternal Emperor studied the documents over and over. The seals on the documents did belong to General Wu Hu, and the handwriting matched Ling Yan’s handwriting.

Ling Yan’s faction had recently reached the peak of its powers…

“Summon the Crown Prince!”

The Eternal Emperor was raging in the palace.

Half a day later, Ling Yan arrived in court.

The Eternal Emperor immediately flung the letters in Ling Yan’s face. “Look at this!”

When he heard that, Ling Yan opened the letters and studied them for a moment.

“Ling Yan, what explanation can you give!” The Eternal Emperor glared at Ling Yan and roared at him in rage. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Royal Father, please don’t be angry.” Ling Yan’s lips curved upwards slightly in a mysterious smile as he looked at the Eternal Emperor. “I think that someone might have forged these letters.”

“Oh?” The Eternal Emperor grunted coldly. “In that case, I give you three days to get to the bottom of the matter!”

“I will take my leave.”

Ling Yan turned to leave.

“Royal Father, do you… really believe that these letters were forged?” The Eldest Prince saw that the situation was going against them and spoke hurriedly.

Even they had not been able to tell that these letters were forged. But just based on a few words from Ling Yan…

The Eternal Emperor looked at the Eldest Prince and Second Princess and said, “Keep a close eye on Ling Yan. If he shows any sign of treason, kill him!”

The Eldest Prince immediately looked delighted at the Eternal Emperor’s words. He hurriedly cupped his fists and said, “Don’t worry, Royal Father, I will certainly play my part!”

With that, the Eldest Prince and Second Princess turned to leave.

The Eldest Prince and Second Princess were overjoyed. This Elder Ye from the Temple of Shadows had really come up with a good scheme!

Since their Royal Father had ordered them to keep an eye on Ling Yan… would it not be up to them to say whether Ling Yan had any treasonous intentions?

“Summon all our troops… contain Ling Yan!”

At that moment, the Eldest Prince was speaking coldly with a stern expression.

“Even if we kill Ling Yan within the capital, we can explain it to our Royal Father by saying that Ling Yan was prepared to raise troops and rebel…” The Second Princess smiled slightly.

This time, they would not need the Advisor or the Temple of Shadows to kill Ling Yan… They could easily finish the job themselves.

A moment later, two generals were leading hundreds of soldiers clad in black armor to surround the city gates.

“Here he comes…”

The Eldest Princess’s gaze fell on Ling Yan, who was walking by himself, in front of them.

“Royal Brother and Sister, what are you doing?” Ling Yan had arrived at the city gate and looked at the Eldest Prince and Second Princess with some surprise.

“Humph!”

The Eldest Prince scoffed coldly and said, “Ling Yan, you deceived and defied the Emperor. You planned a revolt to kill the Emperor and seize the throne. Do you admit to your guilt?!”

“What…” Ling Yan frowned slightly.

“Ah… Third Royal Brother, you have been writing to traitors. The evidence is irrefutable. There is no way that you can deny it,” the Second Princess said with a cold laugh. She looked at the troops clad in black armor that were standing behind her. “Kill!”

“Just a moment.” At that moment, Ling Yan smiled faintly and spoke softly.

“What’s the matter? Are you regretting it now?” The Eldest Princess looked disdainful. “Since you dared to rebel, you better be prepared to lose your head.”

“My Elder Royal Sister makes sense.” Ling Yan nodded. “But… I haven’t denied the charges yet.”

When they heard that, the Eldest Prince and Second Princess were taken aback. What did Ling Yan mean?

“My Royal Elder Brother and Sisters are incomparably intelligent… so… I shall just speak plainly…” Ling Yan looked at them, and his lips curved slightly. His expression was incredibly sinister. “Seal the capital!”
