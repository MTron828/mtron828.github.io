“Ye Qingtang… the girl who obtained the Fiendcelestial Beast cub… in the Hell of Avicinaraka?” Perfected Xuanchen was shocked.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“In that case, I understand…” Perfected Xuanchen nodded.

Ye Qingtang had obtained a young Fiendcelestial Beast in the Hell of Avicinaraka. This news had spread throughout this mainland. If Ye Qingtang had not disguised herself and completely changed her appearance, she would not have lived until today.

However, before Perfected Xuanchen could continue speaking, exclamations could be heard from outside the great hall.

Ye Qingtang and Perfected Xuanchen immediately walked out of the great hall together.

Outside the great hall stood a white-robed old man. On the ground lay dozens of corpses.

One of the corpses was the Peerless School warden. The Peak Masters of Cut Water Peak and Blue Cloud Peak were also there.

Perfected Xuanchen looked in surprise at the white-robed old man who was standing nearby. “Old Valley Master… you…”

“Old Valley Master?”

Ye Qingtang looked thoughtful when she heard Perfected Xuanchen’s words.

Previously, in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty, it seemed that Ji Yixuan was looking for the Regeneration Stone to allow the Old Valley Master to continue living… and the Old Valley Master had been seriously injured by the Peerless School Warden.

Perfected Xuanchen looked in shock at the old man who was standing nearby. Although the Old Valley Master had obtained the Regeneration Stone and managed to survive, he had not been able to recover from his severe injuries and had been recuperating behind closed doors. What had caused him to leave his seclusion to return to the Falling Sky Valley?

“Old Valley Master, are you injuries better?” Perfected Xuanchen asked the old man.

When she saw that Perfected Xuanchen was about to walk over to the old man, Ye Qingtang caught hold of him.

This old man’s aura was rather peculiar, and the bodies on the ground were inexplicable.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Old Valley Master pointedly and said, “Old Valley Master… did you kill the Peerless School warden and these other people?”

“Old Valley Master killed them!” One of the Falling Sky Valley disciples hurriedly nodded.

The Old Valley Master looked at Ye Qingtang and studied her for a moment before a strange smile lit his face. “Peak of the Seventh Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord… Not bad, not bad at all.”

After he had spoken, the old man ignored Ye Qingtang and the others. A pitch-black pearl surfaced on his brow.

Under the glow from the black pearl on the old man’s brow, the Peerless School warden and the dozens of other corpses transformed into black mist and instantly rushed into the black

pearl.

“This…”

When Perfected Xuanchen saw the Old Valley Master’s appearance, he was shocked and was somewhat disbelieving.The Old Valley Master looked like he had suffered from Qi Deviation during his recuperation or had cultivated some kind of sinister power…

However, the Old Valley Master ignored Perfected Xuanchen. He looked towards the void and sighed softly. “Um… time is running out…”

“Time is running out?” Perfected Xuanchen was taken aback when he heard that. He involuntarily asked, “In what way are you short of time?”

Ye Qingtang followed the Old Valley Master’s gaze, and after a moment, she also frowned slightly.

The Old Valley Master was studying the area in which the Dimension Wall had been smashed… as if the Old Valley Master knew something.

“You, come here.”

The Old Valley Master gestured slightly with his right arm. The Peak Masters of the other twelve peaks instantly had their necks broken by the Old Valley Master.

The next moment, the ground was littered with numerous corpses.
