Chapter 1144: Giving One’s All In Acting (3)

After Blood Moon Elder finished his sentence, he threw a heavy punch at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Shifting her gaze a little, she saw that the golden-robed man was already floating above them and observing them.

This fellow actually came over?!

Ye Qingtang lamented deep down, but she knew that the show that she and Blood Moon Elder put up would not end soon.

Boom… Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

A deafening sound echoed in the mountain valley. Blood Moon Elder’s fist missed the target and caused a huge dent in the ground.

“Humph!”

Suddenly, a loud scoff could be heard from above.

“General… I…”

Blood Moon Elder immediately kneeled with one knee on the ground and looked up into the sky.

“Elder Yin Fo, are you unable to defeat a Yang Lord from this low-level mainland?” The golden-robe man stared at Blood Moon Elder and questioned coldly.

“General… this lady’s skills… are exceptional… Please give me some more time. I will definitely be able to capture her alive…” Blood Moon Elder said with cupped fists.

“Capture her alive?”

The gold-robed man said coldly, “What would I want you to capture her alive for!”

“Then… Then please wait a moment, General. I will definitely present her head to you!” Blood Moon Elder said hurriedly.

“Good-for-nothing!”

The golden-robed man waved his hand. “You can’t even settle such a small matter properly… Get lost. I will do it myself.”

“Noted…”

Blood Moon Elder retreated backward immediately and made a path for the golden-robed man.

Almost instantly, the gold-robed man landed on the ground slowly, and his cold eyes sized up Ye Qingtang. “Oh… I never expected that you are already in Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven at such a young age in this low-level mainland. It’s indeed considered a miracle.”

“So?” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

“Haha.” The gold-robed man chuckled. “I cherish talents. You are pretty gifted in martial cultivation. If you are willing to join and serve the You Ancient Clan for life, I can consider giving you a way out and spare your life. What do you think?”

Ye Qingtang sneered in her heart after hearing what the golden-robed man said.

While what he said sounded nice, putting it plainly, he was merely telling her to become a slave of the You Ancient Clan.

However… Ye Qingtang had never thought of turning her back against this mainland that she grew up in and joining the so-called You Ancient Clan just to keep her own life.

“What happens if I refuse?” A cold glint flashed across her eyes as Ye Qingtang looked at the gold-robed man.

“Refuse…”

Ye Qingtang’s reply caught the gold-robed man by surprise.

In the past, their Ancient You Clan annexed low-level mainlands, and the powerful talents from these mainlands fought to become a slave for the Ancient You Clan to protect their lives. Yet, this lady from a low-level mainland actually wanted to refuse this offer?!

“Haha… Of course, the Ancient You Clan will not force you for such matters… However, if you’re unwilling to join, then you are an enemy, and since you’re an enemy, the only route is to die!” Afterward, an overpowering force appeared and enveloped Ye Qingtang in it.

Ye Qingtang pondered after feeling the golden-robed man’s aura.

His martial skills were at least in the Heavenly Venerate realm, and he possessed the power of a Heavenly Venerate. Furthermore, even though coming to this mainland would reduce his cultivation realm, he was still at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven while she was merely an ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven.
