The sturdiness of the small wooden box far exceeded Ye Qingtang’s imagination. Even her own great dao power could not damage the small wooden box at all.

“This thing...” Ye Qingtang tilted her head and stared at the small wooden box on the table before muttering, ” If I use it to create a weapon, the quality should not be inferior to a Heaven-level divine weapon, right...”

However, she then immediately discarded this thought.

Inall of history, no one had ever heard or seen a weapon forged from wood. Even if a divine weapon could be forged from this small wooden box, it probably wouldn’t be fatal to your opponent... it would at most cause some serious injury.

Moreover, one would have to disassemble the wooden box to use it to forge a weapon. However, this small wooden box was impervious to everything. Even Ye Qingtang’s great dao power could not do anything to it. It was probably just wishful thinking to take this small wooden box apart.

Ye Qingtang felt a headache coming on as she stared at the small wooden box. This thing was heavy and useless, and occupied space in her space ring.

However, Ye Qingtang thought about it carefully and felt that she did not lose out. Anyway, she used an ordinary elixir to exchange for it. Although elixirs had just been invented and were very rare in this era, to Ye Qingtang, they were just common everyday items.

Also, it was just that Ye Qingtang had yet to figure out the use of this small wooden box. Even though it seemed useless now, there should be something special about it such that it resonated with the Heavenly Demon Pear! in her body. It was just that she had not discovered it yet.

Picking up the small wooden box, Ye Qingtang shook it casually. Soon enough, she lost interest and stored the box back into her space ring.

Ye Qingtang then sat cross-legged on the edge of the bed, wanting to break through to the sub-Emperor stage in one go. However, Ye Qingtang had just entered into meditation when fighting sounds came from the outside.

Opening her eyes again, Ye Qingtang was silent for a moment before standing up. She pushed open the door and walked towards the Feng family’s training grounds.

Several dozen powerful practitioners had surrounded the Feng family. Meanwhile, the entire Feng family had been mobilized. The Feng family’s patriarch and others were also present.

“Feng Yun family... What is the meaning of this?”

The Feng family patriarch frowned at an elder in white. The white-robed elder swept his gaze across the crowd, and he stood with his hands behind his back and said indifferently, “Hand over Feng Wuyin and I can guarantee your Feng family’s safety.”

Feng Wuyin, who was standing behind, trembled slightly. His little face was rather pale. He didn’t know what he had done, nor did he know what trouble he had provoked.

“What’s going on? Did Wuyin offend the Feng Yun family? If that’s the case, I’ll apologize on behalf of Wuyin. He’s still young and doesn’t know the ways of the world. Please don’t blame him!” The Feng family’s patriarch frowned.

However, the elder in white shook his head and said in a mild tone, “He didn’t offend anyone, it’s just that someone took a liking to Feng Wuyin. He satisfies the conditions for being a blood sacrifice to the Heavenly Demons.”

“What?!”

The Feng family patriarch was shocked.. The Feng Yun Family was planning to use Feng Wuyin as a blood sacrifice!
