The powerful figures in the carriage landed into Falling Sky Valley instantly.

“Yun… It’s been ten thousand years… Seeing you today… you are still so beautiful… But I am old and feeble…” Divine King Luo Xue’s eyes landed on the lady before him, and a sorrowful smile was seen on his face. He did not bother about those few hidden ancient clan members.

“It’s a pity that you cannot hear me anymore now…” Divine King Luo Xue smiled gently and slowly picked up the Regicide Sky Blade beside him.

“Actually… I have always been avoiding… seeing you again… I have betrayed you… I always did not have the courage to face you again… Perhaps it is not a bad thing now that you can’t hear me… Yun, I will avenge you.”

Divine King Luo Xue stood up, and his martial willpower was like a strong wave that swept through the entire place and completely enshrouded it.

“Divine King Luo Xue, you’re already severely injured by the Heavenly Tribulation. What threat can the current you still deal to us?” One ancient clan elderly sneered.

However, just as he finished his sentence, a strange black mist appeared around Divine King Luo Xue.

“From now on… In this world…” At this point, Divine King Luo Xue looked longingly at You Yun, who was not far away. Ultimately, determination filled his eyes as he said, “In this world, there will not be Divine King Luo Xue anymore…”

In a flash, the black mist turned into demonic air and combined with his martial willpower. An enormous pair of pitch-black wings tore Divine King Luo Xue’s back apart.

At this moment, there was no emotion in his eyes, which seemed like a freezing abyss.

Like a supreme Demon Lord, he was to bring calamity to the entire world.

From now on… the dark night engulfed the air. There no longer was any white light or Luo

Xue.

It was at this moment when the ancient clan members’ expression changed drastically.

They finally recalled that ten thousand years ago before the name ‘Divine King Luo Xue’ was known, he was the first-generation Demon Lord…

“Divine King Luo Xue, are you insane! Turning into a demon forcefully will drain your body’s vitality. From now on, you will lose yourself and eventually die too!!” That elderly immediately said in a frenzied rage.

Back then, Divine King Luo Xue was the first-generation Demon Lord and was known as the everlasting Degeneration Demon Lord. Afterward, Divine King Luo Xue realized that the path of the demons was not the right path and not what he was searching for. He then turned his demon breath into vitality and became the leader of the orthodox, Divine King Luo Xue.

However, as Divine King Luo Xue was demonized once again, he would drown in his mental demons forever, and everything that belonged to him would turn into evil spirits. Once his vitality was completely burned away, he would die!

At this instant, a black pearl in the air returned to Divine King Luo Xue’s glabella once again. It was his third demon eye.

The appearance of the demon eye spelled the resurrection of the demon body; Divine King Luo Xue turned into a demon once again.Black mist surged out from Demon Lord Luo Xue’s demon eye.

It seemed as though there was a recovery of the traces of divinity at this instant.

All the people of Falling Sky Valley and even the Peerless School wardens and disciples, who were previously killed by Demon Lord Luo Xue, actually reappeared in Falling Sky Valley. The dead actually came back alive…

“I… I am… sorry…”

Demon Lord Luo Xue’s ice-cold demon eye looked at the lady.

Swoosh!

In the next second, a frightening demonic air erupted instantly.

Demon Lord Luo Xue turned into a black shadow and appeared before the ancient clan figures in a few breaths’ time.
