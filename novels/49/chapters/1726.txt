Chapter 1727: Being Watched (1)

Ye Qingtang didn’t know how long she had slept. She kept instinctively snuggling towards Little White Tiger to enjoy its warmth.

The intense pain continuously radiating from the wound hurt so much it made her scalp tingle. The massive loss of blood caused her body to feel extremely weak and tired.

Luckily, before entering mystic realm, she had prepared a good quantity of elixirs and food rations and Elder Qian had also given her a number of items. Although those Dharma treasures were useless here, the healing elixirs were what she most needed now.

For the first time in her life, Ye Qingtang realized what it felt like to have elixirs as her meals.

“The monsters here are very strange. Although your wound has mostly healed... it just looks weird.” Little White Tiger gazed at the groggy Ye Qingtang. Although her wound had gradually healed after she ingested a large quantity of elixirs, the newly-grown skin and flesh was not soft and pink. Instead it had a greenish-grey hue.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she studied her wound.

She had already detected that wounds incurred over here continued to emit waves of bone-piercing chills even after healing. The surrounding flesh also experienced bouts of phantom aches she could not explain. It was like having an ice spike embedded within the flesh.

“Do you feel anything strange about this place?” Little White Tiger gazed outside the cave. As Ye Qingtang’s injuries had been too grievous, they had been hiding out in this cave over the past few days.

Luckily this cave was rather remote and no other monsters discovered them. Otherwise, it would be a one-way road to hell in Ye Qingtang’s condition.

Nevertheless, although the past few days had been peaceful, Little White Tiger couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched. It just felt like something was watching them in the darkness.

Whenever it expanded its awareness to probe the area, it could not detect anything at all. But the moment it retracted its senses, the tingling feeling of being watched appeared once again.

Little White Tiger told Ye Qingtang of its suspicions.

Ye Qingtang’s perceptiveness was not as good as Little White Tiger’s. In addition, she was very weak and didn’t have much awareness of her surroundings. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

While Little White Tiger tried to probe several times, it was to no avail. It couldn’t help doubting whether it was being overly suspicious because the mystic realm was just too strange.

More time passed and Ye Qingtang had recovered almost back to her normal state, so it was not feasible to continue hanging around this place like this. They would have to continue their way toward the Cemetery of the True Gods as quickly as possible to destroy the bones of the Cursed True God. Only then could they truly escape this god-forsaken place.

Little White Tiger noticed Ye Qingtang’s pale face and bravely decided to head out alone first to scout out their route. It was still strong enough to run if it encountered any monsters.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang remained in the cave to await news.

She watched Little White Tiger leave the cave. Without its body heat, she once again felt the bone-piercing chill. Curling up instinctively, she circulated her spirit energy to maintain her body temperature.

Perhaps she had expended too much energy before, Ye Qingtang’s stomach started to rumble. She opened her space ring and took out some food to eat, then washed it down with some water from melted snow. While she swallowed the rations mechanically, she thought about how she could safely escape this mystic realm.

As Ye Qingtang pondered what to do next, she suddenly heard footsteps outside. That noise was very light and different from Little White Tiger’s usual padded footsteps.
