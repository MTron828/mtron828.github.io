Chapter 2649 Black Tower (2)

“It’s her…”

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when she saw the woman standing behind her, her hand still on her left shoulder.

The Temple of Paragon Holy Lord who looked exactly like her…

The woman in white looked away from the black tower and her bright eyes landed on Ye Qingtang. When the woman saw Ye Qingtang’s appearance, surprise surfaced in her eyes. They were completely identical.

At that moment, the woman’s right hand was on Ye Qingtang’s left shoulder. Ye Qingtang did not dare to make any movements. If she accidentally angered this Immortal Emperor, it would be very easy for her to kill her. Ye Qingtang did not want the yellow dog’s prediction to come true…

“Why do you look like me?” The woman asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was at a loss for words. How should she explain? That they were not from the same era? That she was her reincarnation? Or… this was purely a coincidence? The world was wide and filled with all sorts of strange mysteries?

“I would like to know too,” Ye Qingtang replied helplessly.

In fact, Ye Qingtang was speaking the truth. She did not know why she looked identical to the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon. She also wanted to know the reason.

As for the reincarnation theory, Ye Qingtang had no idea if it was true. She did not have any evidence.

“It really is a boundless world, there are all sorts of strange things,” the woman in white commented after sizing up Ye Qingtang for a long time.

Ye Qingtang, “…” “I created a clone a few days ago. If not for the difference in auras, I would have thought you were my clone,” the woman in white continued when she saw that Ye Qingtang did not speak.

“Clone?”

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback. If she was not wrong, that should be the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows…

Ye Qingtang could still remember that when she first arrived in the Central Mainland, she was mistaken by the Temple of Shadows as the Holy Lord. After that, she was taken to the Temple of Shadows, filled with worry and fear.

“Miss, which faction are you from?” The woman in white continued to probe. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Great Immortal Temple,” Ye Qingtang replied honestly.

“Oh… rumor has it that there are thousands of fiendish demons suppressed under a Great Immortal Temple in the Divine Venerate Domain. Are you referring to that same temple?” The woman in white asked.

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded. “There is only one Great Immortal Temple in the Divine Venerate Domain.”

It had to be said that Ye Qingtang’s impression of this Temple of Paragon’s Paragon was all from hearsay in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. By the time of her original era, the Paragon had already passed away and only lived on in rumors.

Now that Ye Qingtang was personally meeting the Paragon, she realized that this Immortal Emperor did not match the rumors. She seemed to be… much more amiable.

“Miss, I am from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and not a native to your Divine Venerate Domain,” the woman in white continued.

Seeing Ye Qingtang’s strange expression, the woman smiled. “I don’t know why, but after seeing you, I just want to be closer to you. It’s as if there’s some kind of magic power in you that attracts me. Perhaps it is because of our appearances.”

“My name is Ye… Ye Yue. I wonder…” Ye Qingtang stared at the woman in white. Seeing that she was quite amiable and gentle, she decided to chat more.
