Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Qingtang, I will not die along with you in the Xuanling Sect. Don’t even think about it…” The Blood Moon Elder sneered as he sized her up.

However…

He was totally shocked as he looked at her. His face was filled with astonishment.

“You…” The Blood Moon Elder pointed at her, and his body shivered slightly.

Ye Qingtang planned to use some effort to convince him, but she was stunned when she saw his reaction.

“This is impossible…” The Blood Moon Elder shook his head. He opened his eyes wide as he stared at her in disbelief. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

He saw clearly that there was… a blood moon sparkling at her glabella just now…

“You have the… Blood Moon Aura?!”

“Blood Moon Aura? Me?” Ye Qingtang frowned and pointed to herself.

“That’s right.” The Blood Moon Elder was very sure.

The Blood Moon Aura that she had and the blood moon at her glabella represented a very high position in the registration system of the Blood Moon Sect.

Pow!

Before the Blood Moon Elder could say anything else, Ye Qingtang slapped his forehead and said, “Are you joking with me?”

“I’m joking with you?” The Blood Moon Elder was speechless.

As the Blood Moon Sect Elder, how could he sense wrongly when he was so sensitive towards the Blood Moon Aura?

“Follow me!” The Blood Moon Elder turned and walked towards the back of the mountain.

Ye Qingtang did not know what he was playing but still decided to follow him.

They reached a river at the back of the mountain soon.

A streak of Blood Moon Aura flowed out of the Blood Moon Elder’s finger and swiped through Ye Qingtang’s glabella.

A blood moon appeared at the glabella immediately.

“You check for yourself,” The Blood Moon Elder said.

Ye Qingtang lowered her head and looked into the river.

“This…”

She was shocked instantly and could not believe what she saw.

There was really a blood moon at her glabella.

“Ye Qingtang, how did you get the Blood Moon Aura, and where did this blood moon come from?” The Blood Moon Elder asked hurriedly.

The Blood Moon Elder was confused, and Ye Qingtang was totally bewildered. The blood moon slowly disappeared.

She was stained with the Blood Moon Aura out of nowhere and even had a blood moon.

“The Blood Moon Aura on you is different from the normal members. Even the blood moon is different from normal elders… Even the Blood Moon Sect Elders may not notice that if they do not pay attention to. Only the Blood Moon Aura can reveal the blood moon.” The Blood Moon Elder murmured to himself.

Based on the things written in the book of sect history, such situations would never happen unless it was the Blood Moon Lord from thousands of years ago who gave the blood moon using special methods.

Such a blood moon could only be given by the Blood Moon Lord. Even the Blood Moon Sect master did not have the qualifications to do so.

People who were given the power of the Blood Moon by the Blood Moon Lord thousands of years ago were called the Blood Moon Guardians. Their positions were above the elders and just below the sect masters.

The Blood Moon Elder would never believe that Ye Qingtang was one of the Blood Moon Guardians.

None of the sect masters had revived now, and the Lord had also disappeared for thousands of years, so the Blood Moon Elder suspected that the Blood Moon Aura and the blood moon that Ye Qingtang had were forged by a special potion.

Such a situation was seen before. Thousands of years ago, a few hundred of super sects combined their power to terminate the Blood Moon Sect. Before that, these super sects had invented a certain potion that could forge the Blood Moon Aura.
