Chapter 2081: Heavenly Wolf Sect (3)

The deathly aura surrounding Mi was intensifying. The move was merely a warning, but Lu Zhiyao clearly demonstrated his great powers.

Even Mi wouldn’t be confident when faced with Lu Zhiyao’s one move.

Lu Zhiyao was indeed someone to be reckoned with. No wonder the various clans from the Second Domain gathered together to fight him. He overpowered everyone from the Crimson League.

“Mo Yao,” Mi suddenly called out.

“Return to the Temple of Shadows now and take the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos as well as the vessel with you.” Mi took a deep breath.

He previously thought that Mo Yao and Ming Di could at least try to fight the sect custodians.

Now, Mi planned to just give up and stop struggling. With Lu Zhiyao’s capabilities, there was no way they could overpower him.

Even if victory was nowhere near, they would never hand over the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos to the Heavenly Wolf Sect.

The Spirit of Chaos must return to the Crimson League!

Ye Qingtang could sense Mi’s intentions and she lowered her eyes.

The exact moment Mi finished speaking, Shui Mou made a move, unlike the patient Lu Zhiyao. She leaped and huge waves formed underneath her body. A huge water dragon appeared just like that.

“Zhiyao, don’t be so impatient. Since we’re already here in the First Domain, why don’t we have some fun first?” A devious smile appeared on Shui Mou’s face. “Not only do I want the Spirit of Chaos, but I also want their lives too...”

The moment she finished her sentence, the water dragon started charging towards the Crimson League’s army.

When the water dragon charged over, vines as thick as human arms suddenly started bursting out of the ground and formed a huge protective net in front of the Crimson League’s army.

Boom!

The water dragon collided into the huge protective net. Though the protective barrier appeared to be as tough as steel, it instantly shattered upon the impact of the water dragon.

“Pss!” The moment the protective net shattered, Bai Zhi suffered a counter effect. She spat out a mouthful of blood.

Mi acted quickly, lifting his arm to create gusts of black wind to entrap the water dragon.

Even so, the water dragon moved about quickly without being affected and it formed counter effects on him, causing havoc in his breath. The other Crimson League members quickly moved in to help and barely managed to put the water dragon under control.

The satisfaction Shui Mou felt was apparent when she saw Crimson League mobilizing almost everyone just to handle a water dragon. The other ancient clans from the Central Mainland witnessed that too and they were all flabbergasted.

So that was the real capabilities of the top powers from the Second Domain.

They recalled that when the supposed strong powers from the Second Domain first came to the First Domain, they just had to join forces to fight them and not suffer huge injuries. Now, they finally realized that those supposed strong powers from the Second Domain weren’t even that powerful...

When faced with real powers, they were just like ants that could be easily crushed.

They didn’t need anyone more. Just the two sect custodians from the Heavenly Wolf Sect were enough to wipe them all out.

Everyone was consumed in fear. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The Ancient You Clan was in high spirits.

Once they handed over the Spirit of Chaos to the Heavenly Wolf Sect, they could secretly take Little You Yun away. The Crimson League and Holy Lord of Shadows would be defeated and suffer a miserable loss. From then on, the Central Mainland would belong to them.

The Ancient You Clan could eventually use Little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode to cultivate and attack the Second Domain when the time came. Then it would only be a matter of time before they became the most powerful clan!
