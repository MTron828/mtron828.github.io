Chapter 592: The Palace (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Ouyang clan men were stunned after hearing their Young Miss’s words.

“Young Miss, you really like…”

Before the man could finish his words, the Blood Moon Elder gave him a stare. He had to keep his mouth shut.

“What’s the point of saying all the nonsense when Young Miss does not care? You are only looking for trouble.” Another man of the Ouyang clan smiled and sighed after the first man returned to the crowd.

“I just feel that based on Young Miss’s nature, how would she give her true heart to someone so easily…”

“Maybe… she fell for the guy? To be honest, he has quite a good appearance…”

People of the Ouyang clan all shook their head but did not seem to suspect anything.

Feng Cong and the rest walked forward. He stared at Ye Qingtang and said, “Brother Ye, Lady Ouyang, do you think we should take a look at the mysterious palace…”

A majestic palace suddenly appeared out of nowhere in the desert. There were only two possible outcomes: either there were destinies inside, or… it might be the horrifying hell. Feng Cong did not dare to make the decision as it would affect everyone’s safety.

“I’ll listen to him…” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang in a ‘genuine’ way.

Ye Qingtang ignored the loving eyes of the Blood Moon Elder. She frowned and immersed herself in her thoughts. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After a short while, Ye Qingtang said, “It is more dangerous for us to wander around in the Hell of Avicinaraka. The palace can be seen from anywhere within a few kilometers. I guess that there are others from the Nine Nights Dynasty and the Formidable Heavens Dynasty who will go over to the palace since it is so obvious.”

“That’s what I think as well.” The Blood Moon Elder nodded.

The Blood Moon Elder’s identity now was the Young Miss of the Ouyang clan. People of the Ouyang clan could only comply since their Young Miss agreed.

Eventually, Feng Cong led the rest towards the mysterious palace.

The sandstorm in the desert was huge. Sand was curled up by the typhoon and created a sandstorm. It was extremely difficult to walk under such a storm. One would be curled up into the storm and tore into pieces if he was incautious.

It took them a couple of hours to walk just a few kilometers.

Under the palace.

Feng Cong was amazed by the palace in front of him.

The palace was very magnificent. Even the super sects’ infrastructure could not be compared with the palace. The ancient style did not seem to be a product of this century.

“Hahahahahaha…”

Suddenly, a burst of crazy laughter came out of the palace.

A huge head flew out of the palace the moment the laughter was heard. The head landed in front of Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Everyone’s face changed when they saw the head. Even Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered.

The head belonged to an elder. From the wound, it seemed to be chopped off by a sharp weapon. However, the elder’s face had a strange smile.

“He is…” One of the super sect disciples shouted after seeing the head clearly. “The Great Elder of the Yuehua Sect!”

“WHAT?!”

Feng Cong and a few others were totally shocked after hearing that.

The Great Elder’s Martial ability was just below the Yuehua Sect Master, yet his head was chopped off by someone at this place!

“Arh!”

“Don’t… don’t kill me!”

“Why… why did you do this?!”
