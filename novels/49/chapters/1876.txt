Chapter 1877: Chasing (2)

This was the first time she had seen fear in the young girl’s face. She let the guards bring her brother into the Crystal Palace quickly, with Fu Qiu’s expression looking extremely ugly.

But the bodyguards seemed aware of the rules of the Crystal Palace. Even with their heavy injuries, he had already prepared enough spirit stones beforehand, which he put into Fu Qiu’s hands.

Satisfied with the amount, Fu Qiu remained silent.

The bodyguards brought the unconscious man to one side as the young girl knelt down beside him with a face full of worry.

“What happened? How did my brother get this injured?” the young girl said fearfully.

The bodyguard began to explain everything.

From the side, Ye Qingtang listened in as well.

It turned out that this young girl had entered this mystic realm with Long Yi and her brother. The way they had entered the mystic realm was different from Ye Qingtang and the rest, who had entered via the entrance of the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm. They had used a special method to force another entrance into the mystic realm and broken into it.

It was because of this that Long Yi and her had been separated from her brother when they entered the mystic realm.

The young girl had managed to find the Crystal Palace with the help of Long Yi but her brother had not been as lucky. Not only had he lost his way, but he also seemed to have met his enemies as well.

Completely unprepared, they had suffered great losses.

“How did they know that we had entered the mystic realm? Who was the one who leaked the information?” The young girl’s expression turned dark after she had heard everything.

Only a few people from their clan knew that they were entering the mystic realm to look for Aunt Jiu, so how did their enemies find out about it?

“I’m not sure, but they were already in the mystic realm when Young Master found them. Young Master said that they must have followed us and entered the mystic realm when we did,” the bodyguard said with an awkward expression.

The young girl’s hands balled into fists. “That damned Ten Thousand Poison Valley! I won’t rest until they die if anything happens to my brother!” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Ye Qingtang froze when she heard those words being mentioned. The Ten Thousand Poison Valley was an influential faction in the Second Domain and the person who led it was known as the Poison Emperor...

Ye Qingtang had no idea how this girl was related to the Ten Thousand Poison Valley but she didn’t know much about it in the first place.

From what she knew, the Ten Thousand Poison Valley was made up of a group of crazy people who specialized in lethal poisons. Their poisons were often without an antidote and they were extremely tough opponents to deal with.

There weren’t many in the Second Domain who would dare to provoke the Ten Thousand Poison Valley. It was easy to deal with someone who only had strength but poison was harder to protect yourself against.

It was rumored that one of the factions in the Second Domain had dared oppose the Ten Thousand Poison Valley and within a night, everyone in the faction had been poisoned to death, with not a single life spared. No one was able to find out how and when the Ten Thousand Poison Valley had poisoned them.

I’ve finished with your ointment, you can have it back.” Ye Qingtang looked at Long Yao’s worried face and returned the medication they had given her.

Long Yao looked at Ye Qingtang without saying anything and quickly put the medication on her brother’s wounds.

Sometime after this, Baili Xi and the others who had woken up, eager to tell Ye Qingtang they were going out to earn spirit stones. However, they were then informed by Fu Qiu that Ye Qingtang had already paid for the day and they did not have to go out for the day anymore.
