Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang looked up at the Feng Yun family patriarch. This Emperor-level power was indeed extraordinary. If it were before, Ye Qingtang would have no way of resisting

such a power.

However, the current Ye Qingtang was no longer the same as before. She was fearless even when facing such a powerful Emperor-level practitioner from the Feng Yun

family.

“Child’s play.”

As Ye Qingtang faced the bloody mist swirling around, her lips curled into a cold smile and she waved her hand.

With everyone watching in disbelief, Ye Qingtang caught the blood-colored fog that was originally suppressing her.

“This... how is this possible?!”

The Feng family looked at each other in disbelief and shock. Ye Qingtang subdued the attack of an Emperor level practitioner of the Feng Yun Family with one move?

The smiles on the faces of the Feng Yun family members gradually froze. In their opinion, the Feng Yun family patriarch was nearly invincible. However, he was unable to

instantly kill that woman from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. Instead, he seemed to be at a disadvantage.

With that, Ye Qingtang raised her arm and threw the blood-colored fog back at the patriarch.

“Humph!”

The Feng Yun family patriarch let out a cold snort and the blood-colored fog immediately dissipated.

“Little girl, I really underestimated you.” The Feng Yun family patriarch’s expression turned grave. Initially, he did not take Ye Qingtang seriously. However, the martial arts

skills that Ye Qingtang displayed were indeed not to be underestimated.

Nevertheless, the Feng Yun family patriarch still did not treat Ye Qingtang as an opponent of the same level.

“Come down. You don’t have the right to make me look up to you.” Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the Feng Yun family patriarch, who was floating in the air.

The patriarch was slightly taken aback before a cold smile appeared on his face. “Little girl, you really have some ability. Can you fight against an Emperor level?”

“You are full of nonsense.” Ye Qingtang frowned.

Under everyone’s gazes, Ye Qingtang raised her right arm and grabbed at the air.

No one knew exactly what happened. However, the body of the Feng Yun family patriarch trembled and he staggered. Ye Qingtang grabbed him down from the air.

Under everyone’s shocked gazes, the Feng Yun family patriarch’s face turned pale. His feet remained inches off the ground and his body seemed to be controlled by some

unknown force as he slowly moved towards Ye Qingtang.

“What... what’s going on?!”

The people from the Feng family were dumbstruck. The mighty Emperor-level practitioner of the Feng Yun family seemed to have become a weak and ordinary person in Ye

Qingtang’s hands...

Just how much unfathomable energy did this woman from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain contain in her body?!

At that instant, the Feng Yun family patriarch’s expression changed drastically. He struggled crazily and astonishing energy erupted from his body, wanting to escape Ye

Qingtang’s unparalleled restraint.

However, no matter how much he struggled, he was unable to resist this indescribable force.

“How... how is this possible!”

At this moment, the Feng Yun Family patriarch was filled with fear as he looked at the calm Ye Qingtang in front of him. The confident and amused look on his face had long

disappeared.

All that was left in his eyes now was fear..
