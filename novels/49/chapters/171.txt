Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As Gu Yanqiu watched Qin Huan’s happy and bright face, he did not know whether to laugh or cry, and he felt a sense of regret. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang gave Qin Huan this fire-resistant soft armor most likely because Qin Huan defended her previously. Rather, it was Gu Yanqiu who had too many concerns and hesitated. Otherwise, he might have had a share of the armor too.

This little junior sister really distinguished between kindness and hatred clearly.

Qin Huan’s character was also a blessing in disguise.

Ye Qingtang’s actions changed the opinions of the nine people who were all guilty of looking down on her previously.

These disciples were not bad by nature. Although they somewhat thought of themselves highly, they were still able to distinguish between good and bad.

After treating Qin Huan’s injury, Gu Yanqiu led some to remove the Giant Lizard’s poison gall and carefully kept it. This poison gall symbolized the completion of this mission, and if it were lost, the group of them would have wasted their efforts.

“Junior Sister Ye, where did you get that Destructive Heart Pill from? Spare me some.” Qin Huan’s arm was bandaged as he snacked on some food with a cheeky grin.

“What Destructive Heart Pill?” Ye Qingtang tilted her head a little.

Qin Huan replied, “That elixir that you forced down on that Qinglin Sect fella.”

Ye Qingtang was a little surprised and immediately burst out laughing.

“I lied to them.”

“What?” Qin Huan was a little confused.

“The Destructive Heart Pill is so expensive, how would I have it? And even if I have it, why would I be willing to feed him a bottle? The elixir I forced down on him was the bottle of antidote that you gave me the other time.” Then, Ye Qingtang stuffed the empty bottle into Qin Huan’s hand.

Qin Huan’s jaw dropped to the floor while Meng Sheng and the rest had an unbelievable look on their faces.

“You… you didn’t feed him the Destructive Heart Pill? You’re not scared of them finding out?” Qin Huan’s had a mixed expression.

Given Qinglin Sect’s situation just now, Qinglin Sect was still a huge threat to them even without Du Qiang, yet Ye Qingtang actually used an antidote to pass off as the Destructive Heart Pill and bluffed them away? How bold she was!

Ye Qingtang shrugged casually. “Regardless of whether the Destructive Heart Pill was real or not, they still do not dare to take any chances. If it was fake, then that’s it, but if it was real, do you think they won’t be scared?”

Qinglin Sect did not dare to joke around with Du Qiang’s life, and even if they had their suspicions, they could only leave obediently.

After hearing her words, everyone could not help but admire Ye Qingtang.

Do not look at how young this little junior sister was; she was brave and astute and could get people into a fix without any means of escape.

When Qinglin Sect finally realized what that elixir was and wanted to return to seek revenge, it would be too late, and they could only swallow down their loss.

Everyone was overcome with emotions but made a mental warning.

In the future…

They must definitely not offend this little junior sister who was as beautiful as a flower. Otherwise, the taste of this flower-like poison… they could not bear it.

“Junior Sister Ye, you’re really smart. I didn’t have time to ask you this previously: didn’t you go to direct those small Giant Lizards away? Why did you suddenly return? I don’t see them following back either.” Gu Yanqiu wiped off the Giant Lizard’s blood on his hand and handed her a small bottle of the Giant Lizard’s poison that Ye Qingtang wanted him to obtain.

He was unclear what Ye Qingtang want the Giant Lizard’s poison for.

Ye Qingtang replied, “I don’t know where they went either. When I saw the Qinglin Sect people just now, I wanted to come back and inform you all; thus, I decided to direct those little Giant Lizards to somewhere farther and then return. But as I directed halfway, those small Giant Lizards suddenly dispersed. I originally thought they would return here, but now it seems that they ran off to somewhere else.”
