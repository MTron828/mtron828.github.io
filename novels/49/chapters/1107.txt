Chapter 1108 Two Little Monsters (1)

The Central Mainland people were sullen. They originally came here to obtain the Divine Phoenix inheritance, but now, they failed to obtain it and were embroiled into such a huge crisis instead.

This was clearly forcing them to go through life and death with the people on this mainland!! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

At this instant, they ever-so-dearly wanted to catch the person who laid the Forbidden Formation and trapped them in this place.

If they did not give that person a beating, their resentment would not be resolved!

The Central Mainland people looked at each other and saw despair in each other’s eyes.

Even if they wanted to leave now, it was impossible.

If they wanted to keep their lives, they could only fight together with this mainland.

The reaction of the masses fell into Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

A smile emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes discreetly, and she said, “Please rest in the valley for a period of time. You may also take time to think things through as it is not a small matter after all.”

She was not in a hurry at all; the ones who should be panicking were the powerful figures from the Central Mainland who were entrapped by the Forbidden Formation.

Yin Yang Child could only nod helplessly.

Subsequently, Perfected Xuanchen walked forward and personally brought Absolute Monarch of Heaven and the rest into the guest rooms of Falling Sky Valley. Afterward, he settled down the people from Ye Family and Si Family. On the other hand, Ye Qingtang brought the two little kids into the room she used when she was a disciple in Falling Sky Valley.

In the room, Ye Qingtang sat on the edge of her bed cross-legged and fully consolidated her Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven realm.

It was a pity that the attack of the Eye of Extermination had come to an end temporarily. Otherwise, if she could continuously absorb the energy of the arrows of extermination with her Devouring Bloodline… “Mo… ther…”

At this moment, the little boy walked to the bedside, and his big eyes blinked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang immediately hugged the boy and pinched his nose as she chuckled. “What is it?”

“Mo… ther… Name…” The little boy pointed at himself expectantly. Did this little fellow wish to know his name?

Ye Qingtang looked at the little fellow, not knowing whether to laugh to cry. She had never thought of this before, but since this little fellow was so expectant…

Ye Qingtang propped her chin on her hand and pondered for a moment. A smile emerged in her eyes subsequently, and she looked at the little boy. “From now on, you’ll be called Little Luo Xue, alright?”

“Alright…”

Little Luo Xue nodded obediently.

Without waiting for Ye Qingtang to say anything else, the girl walked over as well and looked at Ye Qingtang expectantly.“You’ll be called Little You Yun…” Ye Qingtang looked at the girl and said.

Little You Yun was delighted and nodded repeatedly.

Although Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun were born not long ago, they were extremely intelligent and understood human language without any teaching. Although their articulation was muffled, there was not much impediment when Ye Qingtang conversed with them.

“Mother…” Little Luo Xue suddenly crawled to Ye Qingtang’s side and patted Ye Qingtang’s calves with his hands. “… Amazing.” A laugh escaped Ye Qingtang’s mouth. Before she understood what this little fellow was doing, Little Luo Xue suddenly pointed at Ye Qingtang “uprightly” and then patted his own chest.

“I… I…”

Ye Qingtang looked at Little Luo Xue’s strange behavior and faintly threw a guess. “Could it be that you wish to be as powerful as me?”

Upon hearing that, Little Luo Xue nodded immediately, and his eyes shone brightly as though Ye Qingtang guessed what he wanted to say correctly. He clumsily grabbed Ye Qingtang’s skirt with on hand and Little You Yun’s hand in the other.

“Pro… Prosect…”
