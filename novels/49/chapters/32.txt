Chapter 33: Fire Venom (3)

Si Bai chuckled and said: “Relax bro . Didn’t I get better over the past few days?”

Si Ye sized him up from head to toe . Although Si Bai’s pallor was still quite apparent, his breathing had become less constricted than before . “Grandpa mentioned, Ye Qingtang’s the one who provided the prescriptions?”

“Yup . ”

Si Ye gave a condescending sneer despite Si Bai’s assurance .

“That could only mean she just happened to know the right prescription, but medical expertise’s not all about being affluent in prescriptions and theories . ”

Si Bai could tell that his brother’s judgment was clouded by his entrenched hatred towards the Ye household and decided to rest his case .

After the two watched the doors for some time and perceived no commotion from within, they proceeded over to Si Qiong’s room .

When Si Qiong was wounded by an Ifrit, Si Ye could only watch in vain

as he bore witness to him being poisoned by its venom . One could only imagine the remorse and rage Si Ye had to endure over his own incompetence in protecting his brother .

“Dr . Xu, how much longer can he hold out?” Si Ye was clearly distressed at Si Qiong’s critical condition, once he saw him bedridden, with a pain-stricken and sunburned face .

Dr . Xu looked rather despondent as he broke the news: “To be frank, three days at the most . Without any suppressants however, I’m afraid… . It won’t be much longer . ”

The news. .hit both Si Ye and Si Bai like a ton of bricks .

“Dr . Xu, will Irift’s scales be effective if they are used as the suppressants?” Si Bai asked, in hope of clearing any doubt .

Dr . Xu wore a bitter smile as he nodded, “That might be effective but

but unfortunately, I’ve yet to see anyone succeed . To accomplish that would require the scales to be broken down into powder suitable as additives . No amount of effort will be enough to grind those scales as hard as boulders . ”

When Si Ye heard the explanation, he threw a reproachful glance at Si Bai .

Si Bai could definitely figure out his brother’s intended message, but he would rather not make any further comments . Whether Ye Qingtang was capable of achieving that remained to be seen .

“Lord Si Bai, is there a reason behind that question?” Dr Xu asked .

Before Si Bai could answer his query, Si Ye, who had obviously tolerated for too long, spoke contemptuously: “Some lady from the Ye household just claimed she’s able to use those scales as suppressants . ”

Dr . Xu was stunned for a moment once he heard that claim, and just when Si Ye was

Ye was expecting him to criticize Ye Qingtang for her arrogance, Dr . Xu heaved a sigh of relief instead .

“Well, if it’s Miss Ye, she might know a way . ” Dr . Xu clearly expressed his trust in Ye Qingtang’s abilities .

“… . ” Si Ye could never expect a prestigious physician like him to agree with Ye Qingtang’s outlandish ways .

Si Bai could only watch without a word, and sigh at his brother sulking over his unexpected defeat .

Ye Qingtang had dropped by the Si household these few days and the times when Dr . Xu consulted her on medical practices could be considered aplenty . Anyone could tell that Dr . Xu was completely enamored by her medical expertise . Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

While everyone waited anxiously, Ye Qingtang finally showed up at the door to Si Qiong’s room under the guidance of an attendant . She held a small porcelain bottle small porcelain bottle in her hands .

“Miss Ye, it’s a pleasure to see you again . ” Dr . Xu greeted her in an amicable manner once she stepped into the room .

Ye Qingtang gave a subtle nod and while avoiding Si Ye’s piercing gaze almost instinctively, she approached the bedridden Si Qiong directly .

Si Qiong had fallen unconscious after desperately enduring the sweltering pain induced by the Fire Venom afflicting his body .

“How’s he faring so far?” Ye Qingtang inquired from Dr Xu .

Dr . Xu could only shake his head at the threatening situation .

Ye Qingtang examined Si Qiong’s condition and noticed fresh blood oozing from the bandages around his wound on the left side of his chest . She adjusted her sleeves in the next instant and made a request to Dr . Xu, who stood by the side: “I’ll require your assistance, Dr Xu, in removing these bandages . ”
