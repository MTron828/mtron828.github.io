Ye Qingtang continued to add ice cubes, and a strange scene played out before everyone’s eyes.

The temperature of the frost condensate dropped rapidly, and this heat loss was directly conducted to the Remnant Ice Sword. As Ye Qingtang added ice cubes continuously, the redness of the Remnant Ice Sword gradually faded.

“This is…” The incharge widened his eyes.

There’s still such a move?

Frost condensate was easily affected by the surrounding temperature but would not melt under high heat due to its special texture. When glued tightly on the Remnant Ice Sword, it stably took the shape of the Remnant Ice Sword while the continuous addition of ice cubes would cause the temperature of the frost condensate to become extremely low. Then, this was directly used to cool the Remnant Ice Sword!

The few blacksmiths who looked down on Ye Qingtang previously were dumbfounded.

Never had they expected there to be such a use for the frost condensate.

Not only could this ensure that the Remnant Ice Sword was not deformed, but it could also cool it gradually without breaking it. It was truly a flawless and perfect method!

The few buckets of ice cubes were completely used up, and the Remnant Ice Sword was completely cooled.

Ye Qingtang touched the sword handle carefully. After realizing that it was icy cold, she stopped her actions and removed the Remnant Ice Sword from the frozen condensate.

“It seems that it should be fine now.” Ye Qingtang beamed as she looked at the Remnant Ice Sword in her hand. She had to say that this sword was pretty good. After looking at it for a while, she handed it to the incharge. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The incharge looked at the Remnant Ice Sword in his hands with shock written in his eyes. He only lifted his head up quite some time later as he looked at Ye Qingtang with eyes full of praises.

This girl did not just have amazing forging techniques, but even her skills were so dynamic. She was indeed so promising.

The blacksmiths who grumbled about Ye Qingtang previously became mutes completely. Thinking back about their prior suspicions now, it was a burn on their faces.

“Thank you,” The incharge came back to his senses and said earnestly. “If there’s a need in the future, you can proceed according to my promise earlier in the Sword Spirit Workshop.”

Ye Qingtang nodded. This was what she wanted.

The incharge was speaking to Ye Qingtang, but in the secret chamber in the Sword Spirit Workshop, there were two figures standing quietly.

Through a small window in the secret chamber, the elderly who witnessed Ye Qingtang forging a dagger watched Ye Qingtang and then turned slightly to look at the person beside him.

“Elder Mo, what do you think of this girl?” There were traces of a smile in the elderly’s tone.

The person in the secret chamber with the elderly was the Internal Affairs Elder, Elder Mo.

He was here for the Remnant Ice Sword today but was dragged into the secret chamber by the elderly before the incharge brought Ye Qingtang into the Sword Spirit Workshop.

The entire process where Ye Qingtang used the frost condensate to forge the item fell into his eyes.

“This is the Ye Qingtang whom you mentioned about previously?” Elder Mo said respectfully.

The elderly nodded as he touched his mustache. There was a smile in his eyes. “That’s right. This girl is young, but her forging skills are amazing. Even old Duan is full of praises towards her. Accepting such a pupil will not be a loss to you.”

The ‘old Duan’ whom the elderly said was the incharge of the Sword Spirit Workshop.

There was hesitation on Elder Mo’s face.

The elderly chuckled after noting the hesitation on Elder Mo’s face. “You’re so devoted in cultivation, and naturally, you know the importance of weapons. If I don’t remember wrongly, there are quite a few damaged weapons in your weapon chamber, aren’t there?”
