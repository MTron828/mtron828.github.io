Chapter 1637: I Won’t Pay (3)

The moment he stepped back, the pressure that surrounded Jiang Yiran instantly vanished, and Ye Qingtang also stopped moving.

“...” Jiang Yiran was stunned.

Jiang Yisheng and the others, who had been so worried, were also shocked.

What is going on?

Jiang Yiran actually retreated?

They had merely seen Ye Qingtang casually point her finger, and very slowly at that.

No one had expected this finger to force Jiang Yiran to suddenly retreat.

“I’ve won,” Ye Qingtang said as she looked at Jiang Yiran’s glazed expression.

Jiang Yiran came to his senses and looked at Ye Qingtang in surprise.

Jiang Yisheng and the others, who were standing nearby, also looked baffled. They had no idea what had just transpired.

Could it be that Jiang Yiran gave her a chance?

Jiang Yiran blinked. He only realized at that moment that he had actually lost...

Jiang Yiran’s handsome face instantly turned livid. He saw that Jiang Yisheng and the others whom he had defeated were looking at him in surprise. Jiang Yiran immediately forced himself to look calm and spoke with a deliberate, arrogant laugh.

“You’re pretty lucky. I’ve been cultivating for the past few days, and the Elder told me I am not allowed to spar for the next few days. I’ve already broken the Elder’s rules by fighting with Jiang Yisheng just now. I’ve only just remembered.”

Jiang Yiran would rather die than admit that Ye Qingtang’s finger technique had really forced him to retreat.

He found an excuse and pretended to be gracious. “You’ve just entered the valley, and I don’t want to earn the reputation of being a bully. You’re lucky I’m letting you off this time. I’ll waive your allowance.”

Jiang Yiran’s excuse seemed rather bald, but to Jiang Yisheng and the others, it was perfectly logical.

That’s right.

How could Ye Qingtang really have defeated Jiang Yiran? So it’s because Jiang Yiran was afraid of the Elder’s strictures. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

After all, in the eyes of Jiang Yisheng and the others, the gap between Ye Qingtang and Jiang Yiran’s abilities was so great, it was like a gulf. They would be baffled if she had really won.

“Not just me, but all of us,” Ye Qingtang said suddenly as she looked at Jiang Yiran, who was pretending to stay calm.

Jiang Yiran was taken aback. Only then did he recall what he said when he was boasting, and his expression immediately darkened.

Who knew that this girl’s finger technique would be so strange? If he had known earlier, he would not have competed with her.

But he had already put out the terms and could not take them back, so he could only suppress his gloom and say with a smile. “Of course.”

As he spoke, Jiang Yiran fought back the urge to vomit blood. He now returned the allowance he had just obtained to Jiang Yisheng and the others. At that moment, he was incredibly relieved that his companions had left with Jiang Yanyun. If they saw this, his reputation would be in tatters.

He hurriedly returned the allowance and left immediately, unwilling to linger.

Jiang Yisheng and the others, who thought they were in for a bloodletting, looked at the allowance that they had lost and regained. All of them were beaming. They previously had no respect for Ye Qingtang, but now they beamed at her.

“Qingtang, many thanks for what you did today.”

No matter whether Ye Qingtang had won by luck or not, she had gotten their allowances back. They were naturally grateful.

The youths who had been unhappy about Ye Qingtang joining their clique now warmed towards her. They cleared their throats and said, “Shaobai is not here right now, but we’re free. We can teach you before the Martial Arts Championship begins.”
