Chapter 2736: Return to the Blue Sky Domain (1)

Ye Qingtang remained silent.

Now that the upper realm was gone, there was no one left for it to seek revenge on now.

“By the way, why didn’t Shi Tian counterattack?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Little girl, Tian is only responsible for enforcing the rules. As long as you don’t break the rules, Tian won’t interfere,” said the yellow dog.

“Alright, I understand. I will try my best to absorb the Heavenly Dao power from my heart during this period of time.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

...

The same day, the woman in green came to the Dragon Emperor Clan.

“I have news about Di Jiuyuan and your father.” The lady in green looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback.

A blue lotus pattern flashed across the woman’s glabella. It rotated crazily as endless energy filled the hall.

“Your father is Di Feng, the genius of the Dragon Emperor Clan in the Third Domain. Back then, he met your mother in the Third Domain. But now, the Dragon Emperor Clan in the Third Domain has been wiped out, leaving behind only a deserted lair. It requires a special jade pendant to enter. I used my divine power to detect that there is a very strong sealing force inside. I can’t enter it,” said the woman in green.

“Jade pendant…” Ye Qingtang instinctively took out the jade pendant that Di Jiuyuan had left for her.

The woman in green sized it up for a long time before nodding. “That’s it. You can try and see if you can open it.”

......

“Thank you,” Ye Qingtang said to the lady in green.

After the lady in green left, Ye Qingtang looked at the jade pendant in her hand and fell into deep thought.

She had a nagging feeling that something was gradually creeping towards her.

However, she still had some things to do before heading to the Third Domain.

...

Blue Sky Domain.

Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up as she looked at the Temple of Shadows.

She entered the Temple of Shadows.

“Holy Lord!”

A commotion erupted in the Temple of Shadows when they saw Ye Qingtang.

“Ah Yao… you… you’re back?”

Ming Gu stared at Ye Qingtang and his body trembled. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Did you miss me?” Ye Qingtang patted Ming Gu’s head.

Ming Gu nodded frantically, tears welling up in his eyes. “Ah Yao!”

“Ming Gu, control yourself!”

Ming Wang frowned deeply.

As she looked at the Temple of Shadows, everything that happened in the past surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s mind. It seemed a long time ago but also as if everything had just happened yesterday.

“Damn. Where have you been?!”

The little white tiger suddenly rushed out of the room. It had grown a lot, but its general appearance did not change.

“Long time no see.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Damn. I thought you were dead!” The little white tiger said angrily, “You didn’t die but you didn’t come back to find me!”

“Aren’t I here now?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Damn…” The little white tiger rubbed its head against Ye Qingtang.

During this period of time in the First Domain, Ye Qingtang felt much more relaxed. She did not think too much and just wanted to hang out with old friends.

Apart from the Temple of Shadows, Ye Qingtang went to take a look at the Jiang family again. But she only watched from afar and did not approach.

After that, Ye Qingtang headed to Falling Sky Valley.

“You… are, are you Qingtang?!”

Ye Ling, the head of the Ye family stared at Ye Qingtang in shock and disbelief.

“Father… I’m unfilial… I haven’t returned to see you for a long time.” Ye Qingtang stared at Ye Ling and trembled.

The Ye family now lived in Falling Sky Valley. However, the moment Ye Ling saw Ye Qingtang, he realized that she was no longer on the same level as the rest of them.
