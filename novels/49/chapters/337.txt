However, Ye Qingtang just shook her head. She certainly knew what Song Junqiu’s intentions were.

“Fei Ying, clean the floor now.”

Fei Ying was stunned, but he could only hold his fist tightly. He swept the broken bottles and crushed Soul Condensation Pills. He could feel his heart bleeding.

Song Junqiu felt satisfied as he stared at Ye Qingtang.

She would not dare to argue with them since she was just a new inner sect disciple.

The silver wolf that was standing beside Ye Qingtang witnessed everything coldly. Its sight was fierce, but the look disappeared when it looked at Ye Qingtang.

There was no trace of anger on her face. Instead, a faint smile could be seen from her eyes.

She took a glance at the clean floor and then looked outside.

How could she not know about Song Junqiu’s intentions? However…

If she remembered correctly…

The tyrant of the inner sect should be here by now.

A figure appeared at her gate just when she was thinking about that.

That was a tall and arrogant young man. His face was fierce and rebellious. He walked into the room directly.

He saw Song Junqiu and the rest squeezing in the room once he entered. He frowned and asked unpleasantly, “Where is the new disciple?”

Song Junqiu’s attention was captured by the voice.

He looked over, and the whole group was stunned when they saw the young man.

Feng Moli?!

Why did he suddenly come over?

“Junior Brother Feng? How come you are here?” Song Junqiu tensed up as he stared at Feng Moli.

Feng Moli was very impatient. He took a glance at Song Junqiu. “Do I need to report to you wherever I go? It’s none of your business.”

“…” Song Junqiu’s face clouded, but he felt awkward as Feng Moli challenged him.

Feng Moli was the famous tyrant of the inner sect. His grandfather was the internal Elder of the Xuanling Inner Sect. The young man was very talented, and his abilities were one of the strongest in the inner sect. His behavior in the inner sect was rude and unreasonable, which was the reason why he was called the tyrant.

Even Song Junqiu, who had some connections with the inner sect warden, tried to avoid Feng Moli.

Feng Moli was totally not interested to talk to Song Junqiu. He scanned through the room and noticed his target. He raised his chin as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Are you the new one here?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Feng Moli sized up Ye Qingtang and asked, “Do you know the rules of the inner sect?”

“Roughly. Please advise me on the areas that I do not know.” Ye Qingtang responded nicely.

“Hmm.” Feng Moli was quite satisfied with Ye Qingtang’s answer.

“The wardens and the Elders should have taught you the rules of the inner sect, but today, I’m here to tell you my rules.”
