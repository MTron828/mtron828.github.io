After hearing the Grand Elder’s words, Ye Qingtang shook her head. Venerable Wu was still too obstinate to be awakened up now.

“Qingtang, some things have already been decided a long time ago. My ancestors pledged loyalty to that lady, and it is still the same way for me. This mainland is filled with sin… It must be destroyed. As for the central ancient clan that you said, we also have a plan,” the Grand Elder said calmly.

“We?” Ye Qingtang scanned Venerable Wu in thought. “In the ‘we’ that you said… one of them should be Ning Luo, right?”

“Oh?” The Grand Elder was slightly taken aback but did not deny it either. “How did you tell?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I did not suspect him much previously, but connecting the dots now, it must definitely be related to Ning Luo,” Ye Qingtang said. “Fu Lingtian was a spy and was brought back to Xuanling Sect while Ning Luo was also a Yunxiao Sect spy. According to logic, there should not be any conflict between intruding into the Hall of Justice to kill Fu Lingtian and leaving the sect. However, since he had already silenced Fu Lingtian, why must he flee Xuanling Sect… Ultimately, it is to aggravate the conflict between the two sects.”

Thinking about it now, there were too many clues. For example, when Ning Luo’s senior brother and senior sister rescued him, the Grand Elder completely had the ability to stop the three of them from leaving yet did not choose to do so…

“So, Ning Luo is also a follower of that extraordinary lady, or is he your one of your descendants?” Ye Qingtang asked.

However, Venerable Wu shook his head. “It is not a lie that Ning Luo calls me ‘grandfather.’ However, there are no blood ties between me and Ning Luo, and he is not the descendant of a follower either.”

“Since that’s the case, what is Ning Luo’s objective?” Ye Qingtang pursued.

If the Grand Elder was the descendant of a follower and schemed this for so long, she still could understand. But what was Ning Luo doing it for?

The Grand Elder shook his head and said, “Qingtang, there’s no meaning in knowing all of this.”

With things as such, Ye Qingtang did not utter a word further.

She had never thought that she would actually fight with Venerable Wu, even to the point of fighting to their last breaths.

“Since that’s the case, let’s fight then.”

Wielding the Ice Frost Divine Sword, Ye Qingtang looked at Venerable Wu.

Clank!

Venerable Wu unsheathed a sword.

Swoosh!

In the next second, both of them rose into the sky.

Venerable Wu’s skills were at the First Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Although he was half a state higher than Ye Qingtang, it was extremely difficult for him to defeat Ye Qingtang without the Ice Frost Divine Sword. Furthermore, the current Ye Qingtang held the Ice Frost Divine Sword, and thus, Venerable Wu was not Ye Qingtang’s opponent.

In just ten or so moves, Venerable Wu was already injured by Ye Qingtang with the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

A layer of icy frost extended on Venerable Wu’s wound.

“Venerable Wu, if you repent in time, I will treat it as though I’ve never seen you!” Ye Qingtang said with a frown as she looked at Venerable Wu, who was frozen by the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

In Xuanling Sect, Venerable Wu indeed cared a lot for her.

Even in this Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, he turned into the black-robed person and still saved her using other methods.

Ye Qingtang did not wish to do anything to the Grand Elder, but the pretext was that he could let go of the grudge and stop thinking of destroying this mainland.

The icy frost on Venerable Wu’s wound continued to spread. In just a short while, half of his body was already sealed in the frost.

“Qingtang…” Venerable Wu said and looked at Ye Qingtang. “There is a good saying… Legitimacy belongs to the victor.”
