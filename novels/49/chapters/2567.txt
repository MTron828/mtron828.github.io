The big yellow dog looked at the Blood Moon Elder and wagged its tail. It then

gazed at Ye Qingtang’s back profile. “This little girl is very tough. Don’t worry,

she might not die even if you died a few more times.”

The Blood Moon Elder was speechless. Could he not die? Was it so difficult for

him to just continue living?

The big yellow dog said softly, “This might be the most important turning

point in her life. If she can persevere and overcome this, perhaps in the

future

The Blood Moon Elder was curious. “Perhaps what?”

The big yellow dog glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. “Get lost.”

Ye Qingtang had already arrived at the red beam. In the next second, Ye

Qingtang’s body flew into the air and towards the center of the red beam. This

Was exactly as the big yellow dog had described.

If she didn’t have the right to enter the Ancient God Karma Tunnel, she would

have been ejected immediately. If she was worthy, she would enter the tunnel

in one piece.

Just as Ye Qingtang flew into the red beam, an extremely strong resistance

surged out, as if it wanted to push Ye Qingtang away.

This is bad.”

Sensing this resistance, Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as an ominous feeling

arose in her heart.

It was obvious that this tunnel rejected her and didn’t want her to get close to

it.

However, a red light shot out of her shattered voice transmission stone, which

fused with the red beam.

Before Ye Qjngtang could make sense of it, the resistance inexplicably

disappeared.

The huge resistance turned into a suction force and in the blink of an eye, Ye ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Qingtang was sucked into the center of the red beam, disappearing from the

world.

“The Holy Lady is gone!” The Blood Moon Elder said anxiously.

The big yellow dog wagged its tail and looked at the flash of red light that had

fused with the red beam. “Interesting”

An unknown period of time passed. It felt like millions of years, but also like

just the blink of an eye.

Ye Qingtang regained consciousness and slowly opened her eyes.

This is?

Ye Qingtang saw herself floating in a huge tunnel. Around the tunnel was

chaotic space-time storm.

The destructive power contained in these stormms could not be described in

words. Even if an ancient true god was to personally come here, he would

probably be shattered into pieces if engulfed by these space-time storms.

Even the purest power of nature could not compare to these terrifying storms.

“Is this the Ancient God Karma Tunnel? It’s so dangerous here.” Ye Qingtang

curled up her body and did not dare to move.

It was just a tunnel, but it was already so dangerous and terrifying. If one was

unlucky and entered thhe doomed hells that the big yellow dog had described,

the consequences would be unimaginable.

But now, even the tunnel itself was overwhelming for her.

There were no rules in the formation of a space-time storm. Chaotic

turbulence filled the tunnel. Ye Qingtang could not control her body and was

unable to move of free will.

In just a few breaths’ time, the space-time storms ahead deviated from the

center and gradually merged with her position.

This is bad

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when she saw what was happening

In such a situation, even an Immortal Emperor would find it difficult to escape.

And she was just a mere Fifth Heaven level Divine Lord.

Without thinking much, Ye Qingtang immediately communicated with the

power of the Deity Ocean in her body. If she did not escape quickly, she would

be completely engulfed by the space-time storm within ten seconds.
