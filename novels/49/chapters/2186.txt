Chapter 2187: Alchemy (2)

“Teacher Ye, you don’t need to do that for me. My success rate is indeed not high, I guess I’m not suitable to become an alchemist after all.” Yun Chen thought that Ye Qing mentioned he knew how to refine elixirs all because of him.

After all, no one would believe that Ye Qing knew how to refine elixirs.

“It has nothing to do with you. I want to refine elixirs.” Ye Qingtang didn’t know how to react. Why didn’t they believe her?

Originally Ye Qingtang had planned to repay the medicine faculty with some high-quality elixirs if they let her use an alchemy lab. But now, it seemed like there was no need for her to do that.

Although Ye Qingtang wasn’t a true alchemist, with 300 years of experience from her past lifetime, she learned almost everything, including things that she shouldn’t have learned.

Back then when she was chased after by Ye You and the others, how could she possibly afford to purchase elixirs?

The only solution was for her to refine elixirs herself.

She could safely say that she was better than most alchemists in this century. After all, her 300 years’ worth of experience was to be reckoned with.

However...

Yun Chen and the others didn’t feel too good about it even when Ye Qingtang was filled with confidence.

But they didn’t dare say anything to ruin their teacher’s confidence.

“Brother, why is Boss being crazy again? I’m not worried about the herbs, since I can buy them if Boss can’t afford them. I’m more worried about those processes. I just got a headache from looking at it once. If he’s going to just do it and ruin everything, what’s going to happen to Yun Chen...” Lei Yan started whispering to Nangong Lie.

The alchemy lab belonged to Yun Chen and his success rate wasn’t that high to begin with. If Ye Qing were to join and further create a mess, Yun Chen would be expelled from the academy when he doesn’t pass the medicine faculty’s assessment next month.

Nangong Lie had no idea what was going on and he could only whisper to Yun Chen,

“Have you thought it through?”

Yun Chen smiled.

“Since Teacher Ye wants to do it, I’ll just let him be. Anyway, I won’t be able to stay here any longer regardless.”

Yun Chen was clear that his body made it impossible for him to achieve higher heights in martial arts, while the Drifting Cloud Bloodline made it impossible for him to be a true alchemist.

The only reason he stayed on was because he thought that Ye Qing was different from other teachers and he wanted to have it easier during his remaining time at the academy.

Nangong Lie’s lips twitched but he ended up not saying anything. He just patted Yun Chen on the shoulder.

“Senior Sister... Do you want to help and persuade Boss? Don’t do this to Yun Chen.” Lei Yan made his way to Mu Ziying, calling her Senior Sister even when she was only at his chest level. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Everyone knew that Ye Qing doted on Mu Ziying the most, and favored girls much more than boys.

Mu Ziying lifted her head, looking at Lei Yan without any emotions.

“You’re doubting Boss.” Mu Ziying suddenly frowned.

Lei Yan, “...”.

Mu Ziying moved her fingers and her puppet suddenly jumped onto Lei Yan’s shoulder and its hands were on Lei Yan’s neck.

“If you continue doubting Boss, I’ll strangle you to death.” Mu Ziying’s eyes crinkled and the puppet suddenly tightened its grip over Lei Yan’s neck.

Lei Yan was stunned and he quickly put his hands over his neck to protect himself.

“W-When did you become so good at controlling the puppet?”

The puppet moved so quickly, not even sparing him any time to react!
