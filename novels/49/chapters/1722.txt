Chapter 1723: Frozen Ice Fields (3)

That black figure charged straight at Ye Qingtang and she quickly dodged. But the black figure still managed to scratch her shoulder, leaving behind a garish wound so deep that the bone could be seen!

The black figure then fell down to the ground and stepped upon those pursuing ice vines.

It was then that Ye Qingtang finally saw clearly what that black figure was.

Monster. It looked like some kind of leopard, yet it’s body was double that of a rhinoceros. A necklace made up of human heads hung around its neck. Those human heads had already turned into skulls, but one was still fresh and new...

“Qin Mo...” Ye Qingtang’s head was instantly filled by a buzzing noise when she saw that fresh human head.

Qin Mo was one of the top ten in the previous Martial Arts Championship. He had also entered the mystic realm together with the rest. But as he was a quiet loner with an insignificant presence, people often forgot about him.

But now...

Qin Mo’s head was hanging from that monster’s neck. Those bloodshot eyes were still swiveling about as he stared straight at Ye Qingtang...

“It hurts so much... Ye Qingtang... please stay behind and accompany me...” Qin Mo’s twisted lips spewed out a continuous stream of bitter words. “Why, why did I end up meeting such a monster... why am I not dead yet... Ye Qingtang, I am in such pain, such great great pain... why me... Why wasn’t it you the one who ended up like this instead...”

Qin Mo’s bloodshot eyes were filled with a poisonous grievance. But before he could finish his words, the monster suddenly reached up one paw and tore off Qin Mo’s lower jaw.

Qin Mo’s eyes bulged out in pain.

“Roar!!” The monster seemed to hate Qin Mo’s whining. Its accessories should just quietly hang upon its neck.

Taking advantage of the monster’s rage, Ye Qingtang fled with Little White Tiger in her arms. She could not even be bothered about her injury for now.

There was no time to stop. That monster and those ice vines were constantly trying to think of ways to take her life.

Under the freezing cold and endless snow, Ye Qingtang poured in all her energy to escape. She was drenched in sweat from her efforts, and her sweat immediately froze the moment they seeped out of her pores.

That monster and the icy vines had no intention of letting Ye Qingtang escape. They continued to chase after her, persistent and unyielding. Ye Qingtang concentrated all her strength into flying as quickly as she could. Only then did she manage to put in some distance between them.

The roars and howls finally faded away after Ye Qingtang flew on for a long time. That deadly ice forest was also no longer beneath her feet. She felt like she was nearly drained of all energy but she continued to feel the urgent need to put a little more distance between herself and that deadly place. The wound on her shoulder radiated endless waves of intense pain, but she couldn’t stop. Not yet, not now.

Only when her energy was nearly depleted did she start to plummet to the ground.

Ye Qingtang would be fatally injured if she continued to plummet at this speed!

Little White Tiger’s feline eyes widened at the high speed that Ye Qingtang was falling. It suddenly leaped out of her arms and its tiny body suddenly expanded several times. It gripped Ye Qingtang’s clothes between its jaws and tried to pull her back. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But her clothing had frozen over and was crushed to bits under the pressure of his jaws. Like a broken kite, Ye Qingtang continued to freefall.

“Dammit!” Little White Tiger cursed before pouncing straight towards Ye Qingtang. It reached out and pulled her into its soft fur before flipping over and landing heavily upon the icy grounds.
