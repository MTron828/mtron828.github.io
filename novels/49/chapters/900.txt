Chapter 901 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (3)

Before everyone returned to their senses.

Boom!

An eruption sounded.

Subsequently, Feng Wuya was flung out like a kite with a snapped string.

“Ow!”

Feng Wuya spat a mouthful of blood in midair.

“Junior Brother Feng!”

Noticing the situation, everyone from the Divine Virtual Academy could no longer care about Gu Tianhe and surged forward to catch Feng Wuya. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I heard that you’re looking for me?”

Standing beside Gu Tianhe, Ye Qingtang remarked flatly. Her long, jet-black hair swayed in the wind while her eyes were filled with nothing but indifference.

After finishing her sentence, she looked at Feng Wuya coldly. A cold glint shone in her eyes.

The lives of the people from the Supreme Academy had nothing to do with her originally, but no matter what, she somewhat had some relations with Gu Tianhe and Feng Wudang.

In reality, Ye Qingtang had not planned to poke her nose into this matter initially. However, she had some grudges with the Feng ancient clan.

In the Central Mainland in her previous life, after the news that Ye Qingtang possessed the Heart of the Demon God was exposed, she faced assassination attempts from many forces. The Feng ancient clan which Feng Wuya was in also participated in seizing her heart and used lethal attacks several times.

If it was anyone else, perhaps Ye Qingtang would not enter this saga. However… since it was an enemy from her previous life, she naturally did not mind settling the scores with him.

Others were afraid of the Feng ancient clan but not Ye Qingtang. Even if she offended the Feng ancient clan, she could just let Ling Yan help her think of a way out.

“Ha… hahaha…”

Feng Wuya stood up with the support of the Divine Virtual Academy disciples. Although he was in a rather miserable state, his burning eyes sized up Ye Qingtang at this moment.

Once he saw Ye Qingtang’s exquisite beauty, he nodded repeatedly and said, “Not bad… Truly not bad. Such a beauty is truly uncommon already…”

Feng Wuya self-professed that he had seen countless beauties before, but there were few who could compare to this young lady before him.

The young man in the lead of the Divine Virtual Academy disciples was a little helpless upon hearing Feng Wuya’s comment.

This fellow is already beaten up until like that, but his brain is still thinking about that kind of thing?!

Is this the legendary “unable to move upon seeing a beauty”…

“Little beauty, do you know who I am? I am the grandson of the Feng ancient clan’s Grand Elder! You have already committed a death crime by hitting me today. Your… your friends, including everyone in your clan, will lose their lives because of your disrespect today!” Feng Wuya’s avaricious eyes swept across Ye Qingtang’s body, and he laughed subsequently.

“However… you should be glad that you were born with such a good face… Since Heaven gave you such a good face, I will give you a chance.”

Then, Feng Wuya looked at Ye Qingtang increasingly frivolously.

“From now on, you will follow me and please me well. I can consider pardoning your clan from death and will only let them be slaves for eternity. How about that?” Feng Wuya asked.

A Supreme Academy disciple, Li Xiu, was surprised and had a confused look when he saw Ye Qingtang, who suddenly appeared.

This lady was indeed wearing the uniform of a Supreme Academy disciple, but he had no memory of her. Could it be that he missed her out during the roll call just now?

While Li Xiu had his confusions, it was not the time to think about this issue right now.
