Chapter 1530 At Ease 3

Everyone cursed Jiang Yu for taking advantage of them, but they could only bear with it.

Jiang Yu passed all the treasures he extorted to Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang suddenly felt she was rich now...

Jiang Yu was indeed the Domain Monarch Founder. He really had some skills in extortion.

“You Qiong...” Jiang Yu’s sight landed on cunning You Qiong after extorting everyone else.

“I heard that you were fully prepared when you came to the Land of Infinite Demons and even brought one out of the seven Guarding Treasures of the Ancient You Clan. I haven’t seen you use it before. Don’t bother hiding it anymore...”

You Qiong could feel the cold sweat on his body from Jiang Yu’s words. After everyone “offered” their treasures, he could only follow. He then took out a transparent bottle from his space ring that contained a sleepy, colorful worm.

“Souleater worm?” Jiang Yu was also stunned after he saw the colorful worm.

You Qiong twitched his lips slightly.

Jiang Yu smiled and grabbed the bottle. He immediately passed it over to Ye Qingtang and said, “Tang Tang, keep this safe. This is a Paragon treasure of the Ancient You Clan.”

Ye Qingtang was curious as she stared at the Souleater Worm. She heard that the Ancient You Clan had lost one of their Guarding Treasures in her previous life. So it was taken by You Qiong and was brought over to the Land of Infinite Demons...

Ye Qingtang did not know what the Souleater Worm did.

However, it must be something special if Jiang Yu was so satisfied with it.

Jiang Yu felt content now after extorting everyone. Ye Qingtang had a fruitful gain.

The rest looked hopeless.

After getting the treasures, Jiang Yu did not hesitate. He asked Ye Qingtang to bring everyone and head towards the collapsed shrine.

In the forbidden land, a group of children followed a skinny girl. They walked in order and looked around cautiously. At the end of the line, the three silly Demonic Bears also followed. They did not attack; instead, they were like three guards that protected the rest from the eyes in the darkness.

“Old Jiang, your descendant really has some skill. The three Demonic Bears seem to be obeying her.” You Qiong asked as he felt there was something weird with the three Demonic Bear earlier on.

Jiang Yu humphed, “Of course. Whose descendant is she?”

You Qiong almost could not control his urge to strangle Jiang Yu anymore.

Actually, besides You Qiong, Ye Qingtang also felt that it was strange. The big demon’s aura on her body faded, but the three Demonic Bears still followed her and did not attack.

It seemed that Jiang Yu could see Ye Qingtang’s confusion. When there was no one around, he said softly to Ye Qingtang, “You’re wondering why the three Demonic Bears do not attack you?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Has your Heavenly Demon Bloodline awakened?” Jiang Yu smiled.

“Yes.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Jiang Yu nodded slightly, “The Demonic Bear is the servant of the Heavenly Demon. Some disciples in our Jiang Family are born with the Heavenly Demon Bloodline. They can sense the Heavenly Demon Bloodline and treat us as one of their own kind. However, only silly creatures like the Demonic Bears will recognize wrongly. If it were other demons, they would tell the difference easily.”
