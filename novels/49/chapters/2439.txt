Chapter 2440: Big Yellow Dog

Ye Qingtang immediately used her hands to scoop up some water to drink.

The spring water was crisp and sweet.

After several days of strong winds, Ye Qingtang was covered in dirt and dust. Looking at the clear spring waters, Ye Qingtang couldn’t resist. She shed her “fake male identity”, letting down her waist-length, black hair.

The wind was harsh and cold. But it was nothing to Ye Qingtang.

Feeling relaxed, she washed away the dirt on her body.

…

Ye Qingtang soaked inside the spring. It had been a long time since she felt so relaxed.

Since the Central Mainland and even while she was in the Second Domain, she had been on her guard, fighting with her wits or fists every minute of the day.

It was way too long since she enjoyed this level of relaxation.

Just as Ye Qingtang was enjoying this rare treat, she suddenly stiffened when she caught sight of something from the corner of her eye. She dragged her clothes, which she had placed by the side of the spring, into the water and put them back on.

A pair of black eyes were staring at her about half a foot away. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. But after she got a clear look, she gradually relaxed.

It was a dog, also soaking in the spring. Its head was above the surface, two ears standing straight up and staring at Ye Qingtang.

Human and dog exchanged looks, sizing each other up.

Ye Qingtang was feeling rather puzzled. How did a dog appear in a dangerous place like the Wailing Well…

And Ye Qingtang was sure that it was a dog and not some demon. It was an ordinary dog like those kept by families to guard the house. Although it was very strange for a dog to appear like this, Ye Qingtang didn’t think too much of it. After all, dogs were a common creature.

“Why are you inside the spring?” Ye Qingtang smiled at the dog. “Aren’t you cold?”

What happened next went completely beyond Ye Qingtang’s expectations.

“It’s still alright. The temperature is fine but the waters are a bit too deep. It’s an effort for me to keep paddling,” the dog replied candidly in human language.

Ye Qingtang was dazed by the fact that this dog could speak. Her smile froze on her face.

This little dog… did it just speak??

Normal animals were different from demons. Especially for a common creature like this dog, she had never heard of a dog who could speak!

“What kind of thing are you?!”

Ye Qingtang snapped out of her trance. In the blink of an eye, she leaped out of the spring onto the shore, all the while staring guardedly at the dog.

Having lived so many years, Ye Qingtang never expected that she would ever be so guarded against a common dog…

The dog looked rather annoyed at Ye Qingtang’s comments. “So rude. What do you mean by “thing”? Am I a thing? I am not just a thing. Can’t you see with your eyes what am I?”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Are you… really a dog?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Ye Qingtang swore that this thing inside the spring was no demon. It was clearly a common dog, the type used to guard houses.

“Dog? Did you just call me a dog?” The dog stared at Ye Qingtang. “Are you joking?”

“Aren’t you a dog?” Ye Qingtang was confused.

“Of course not.”
