“Hm… It does not matter,” the Flying Star Academy teacher said after a long pause.

“I wonder which Celestial world you have been to. Rumors are that you’ve been there,” the man said.

“We shall not speak of that,” the Flying Star Academy teacher said as he looked at the man.

How would he know whether the Yongle Demon Emperor had been to the Celestial world or not? It would be wiser for him to speak less.

“This is bad…”

Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed. The general was too powerful and it was difficult for the Flying Star Academy teacher to work his magic. They would expose themselves if this went on.

“Alright, since you are not willing to tell me, I shall not ask.” The man nodded then paused before continuing, “But the return of the Yongle Demon Emperor to this world is extremely shocking. I hope that you will not blame the younger generation for not giving you a proper welcome.”

Lu Yuanxiang and Ye Qingtang’s expressions changed as they heard that.

How could this general be this cautious!

His willpower was extremely strong.

“Hm, I am interested. What do you think?” The Flying Star Academy teacher smiled as interest sparked in his eyes. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang subconsciously looked at the Flying Star Academy teacher. Unexpectedly, his mental strength was rather strong as well and he could still pretend to be nonchalant even in such a situation.

“You once commanded all sides to battle the world, forcing everyone else to surrender to you. If I were to be so bold as to seek some advice from you… if I have offended you, please punish me as you like. Of course, if you do not do so, I will make sure to punish my subordinates harshly. They will not protest,” the Yongle Tribe General said loudly as he fixed his soul-piercing eyes on the Flying Star Academy teacher.

The Flying Star Academy teacher steadied himself for his death. He already said that he had no intention of playing the role of this damned Yongle Demon Emperor. Now he was stuck in this position with no way out!

The Flying Star Academy teacher instinctively wanted to look at Ye Qing but the Yongle Tribe General was staring at him. He couldn’t look away, and more importantly, could not show any fear in his eyes.

“You want me to fight you, insolent brat? How dare you…”

Before the Flying Star Academy teacher could finish speaking, the edges of the Yongle Tribe General’s lips curled into a chilling smile. Without giving the Flying Star Academy teacher a chance to speak at all, a cold light flashed in his eyes.

The cold light was like the light of death. It seemed like it could disintegrate anything within a second.

In the face of that gleam of frostiness, the Flying Star Academy teacher couldn’t think of anything at all. His mind went blank and he could only wait for the arrival of his death without speaking another word.

But before the light could reach him, Ye Qingtang quickly reacted.

Jumping in front of the Flying Star Academy teacher, with a wave of her sleeve, the light of death turned into a vast ocean and spilled onto the ground.

This sudden event shocked everyone. Lu Yuanxiang, Qin Feng and the rest of them stared at Ye Qingtang like she was a ghost.

What had just happened?

Ye Qing had turned the Yongle Tribe General’s light of death into water with just a wave of his hand?

How did he do that?

The Yongle Tribe General was taken aback.

The attack had once injured the Great General of the Xihai Tribe. Even he himself had taken some damage…
