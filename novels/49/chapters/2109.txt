Chapter 2110: Congratulations (1)

Several powers in the Second Domain started paying attention to the news of the Holy Lord’s birthday celebration.

However, many knew that with their current abilities, they were not fit to attend and likely wouldn’t even receive an invitation to the Temple of Paragon’s celebrations.

“Wasn’t the Holy Lord in seclusion?”

“Perhaps she is out this year?”

“She has been in seclusion for so long, does that mean that her capabilities have also...”

“I wonder if the Water Cut Sect will be attending the celebration.” Everyone joined the discussion. The Water Cut Sect had a strong sphere of influence in the Second Domain, almost comparable to the Heavenly Wolf Sect.

“Water Cut Sect? I think you should stop joking. The Water Cut Sect is powerful in our eyes, but when it comes to the Temple of Paragon... Do they even know about the Water Cut Sect’s existence? Do you not remember when the Master of the Water Cut Sect tried to act familiar with the Deputy Division Head of the Temple of Paragon? They didn’t even end up meeting each other and the Deputy Division Head was so annoyed that he almost destroyed the entire Water Cut Sect.”

“That’s scary, but I can’t say that it surprises me. The Temple of Paragon has been secretive all along. Those who are able to establish relationships with them are naturally as powerful as them. Powers like the Water Cut Sect wouldn’t even be considered by the Temple of Paragon...”

They had a good time gossiping about the Water Cut Sect but once they saw some members of the Water Cut Sect walk past, they didn’t dare say a single word.

It would be a great honor for those in the Second Domain to just perform a simple act of sending a gift to the Temple of Paragon. Only the best of the best could attend the celebration, others wouldn’t even be able to get close to the entrance of the Temple of Paragon.

The Temple of Paragon’s Holy Lord’s birthday celebration was discussed by almost everyone in the Second Domain. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Meanwhile, everyone from the Temple of Paragon began preparing for the celebration.

Ye Qingtang didn’t know of the happenings at all. Although Elder Hua told her that she could come to the Temple of Paragon to walk around anytime, she didn’t dare to do that. She wanted to have nothing to do with them so that they wouldn’t destroy her once they realized she wasn’t the reincarnated Holy Lord.

Apart from resting every day, she regularly visited the Floating Island to spend time with the little children there.

They were extremely talented and it was only because they were young that their foundation wasn’t strong enough yet. Ye Qingtang guided them along with her martial arts knowledge from 300 years later.

It was no surprise that the children on the Floating Island were ecstatic whenever they saw Ye Qingtang.

The elders saw everything that happened. They watched as the children improved their foundational skills quickly by adopting unique cultivation methods under Ye Qingtang’s guidance.

The elders were planning to groom their reincarnated “Holy Lord” after resolving the Sea King’s incident.

Days went by and Ye Qingtang was preparing to head to the Floating Island when she was suddenly intercepted by Elder Hua.

“Is there anything I can help you with?” Ye Qingtang looked at Elder Hua. She wasn’t sure whether it was just her, but Elder Hua seemed to be dressed for an important occasion today.

“Are you going to the Floating Island today?” Elder Hua smiled.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

She knew that her every move was being watched by the Temple of Paragon so there was no need to try and hide it.

“I don’t think you can go to the Floating Island today, but there’s someone else I can take you to. Do you have any time now?” Elder Hua asked politely.
