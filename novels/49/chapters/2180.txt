Chapter 2181: Medicine Faculty (1)

Ye Qingtang left first after settling Lei Yan and the rest.

The others were easy to manage. They would be fine as long as she could find suitable cultivation methods for them. Yun Chen was the exception.

Yun Chen was from the medicine faculty and specialized in refining medicine and elixirs.

Ye Qingtang had always been a loner in her previous life. She was being hunted and she didn’t have much money on her. As a result, she didn’t dare to venture into crowded areas and she would refine most of the elixirs she needed.

On top of that, she had always wanted to restore her spirit root, and so spent a lot of time and effort on medicine cultivation. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

If it was just about giving pointers on cultivating medicines, Ye Qingtang would not have any problems with that.

But Yun Chen’s case was more special. As a result of his bloodline, his success rate at cultivating medicines was extremely low. Ye Qingtang had to find other ways to resolve this.

The cultivation of medicines was also one of the categories in the Inter-Academy Competition. Ye Qingtang only had six students. To get that Wind-Calming Pearl, she would not give up on either one of them.

Half a day later, Ye Qingtang finally came up with a solution.

Yun Chen’s problem lay in his bloodline. They just had to make his bloodline go temporarily dormant when he was cultivating medicines.

This method sounded fantastical. But Ye Qingtang knew of the existence of such an elixir from her previous life.

However, the process to refine that elixir was rather complicated and Ye Qingtang didn’t have an elixir-refining tripod. She set her sights on the medicine faculty.

The medicine faculty had many tools for refining elixirs. As a teacher of the Netherworld Academy, it should not be difficult for Ye Qingtang to borrow an alchemy lab.

At this thought, Ye Qingtang hurried over to the medicine faculty.

Just as Ye Qingtang was prepared to find a medicine faculty teacher to negotiate the use of a lab, she inadvertently discovered a few familiar figures there.

“What do you mean by that? Can’t we come to the medicine faculty?” Lei Yan’s loud shouts drifted over to Ye Qingtang’s ears.

Ye Qingtang glanced over and saw that Lei Yan and the rest, who were supposed to be practicing in the classroom, had all appeared in the medicine faculty. Apart from Qin Feng, who was diligently planting seeds, all the other five students were present and accounted for.

At this moment, Lei Yan and the rest were arguing over something with a few teenagers from the medicine faculty.

“Brother, don’t be so distant. We just want to make friends. Look, our academy has always encouraged students from the other faculties to establish good ties with the medicine faculty, right? Give us the elixirs you have refined and we will return the favor in the future.” Nangong Lie smiled.

The medicine faculty students all specialized in medicine cultivation. Although they were only students now, they would become full-fledged alchemists after leaving the Netherworld Academy.

Alchemists were highly respected positions in all domains. They might not be very powerful, but they could refine all sorts of highly sought-after elixirs. The more skilled an alchemist was, the more powerful practitioners he would have on his side.

To obtain high-quality elixirs, those powerful practitioners were more than happy to protect those alchemists.

This unspoken rule was also present in the Netherworld Academy. Most of the students here would try their best to establish good relations with the medicine faculty students. Although those teenagers were just students now, to be able to enter a prestigious school like the Netherworld Academy, every single one of them was exceptionally talented in medicine cultivation.
