Chapter 1179: Victory

Sensing the force of the sword intent radiating out from You Tianhe, Ye Qingtang’s mind, qi, and spirit escalated to the peak instantly.

Ye Qingtang was not under too much pressure to face these young powerful figures of You Ancient Clan, and there should be no issue as long as she fought carefully.

At this instant, You Tianhe gripped the sword handle at his waist, and his eyes were cold. The power of the sword intent intensified. Strong winds raked up in the surroundings and kicked up dust everywhere, resembling the arrival of a natural disaster that struck terror in one’s heart.

The masses at the top of the city walls of Heaven City frowned deeply, and many were worried for Ye Qingtang.

Even the youngest ancient clan Young Lord, Mo Feng, almost could not resist the force of You Tianhe’s sword intent, which seemed to be much more powerful and frightening than that time!

Ye Qingtang did not dare to be careless in the face of such a powerful sword intent willpower.

“You may die from this blow,” You Tianhe looked at Ye Qingtang expressionlessly and said.

Ye Qingtang scoffed. “I look forward to it.”

As Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, You Tianhe raised his right shoulder, and a slashing sound pierced the air. In a flash, a terrifying sword gleam seemed to befall from the heavens and aimed towards Ye Qingtang.

This sword intent was extremely horrifying and was loaded with an inexplicable destructive force.

Many powerful figures at the top of the city walls were stunned. The force of this sword intent was a large upgrade when compared to before…

The corner of Gu Yu’s lips tugged up slightly into an undetectable sneer. He had two motives for sending Ye Qingtang to accept the battle. One was to deplete You Tianhe’s combat capability as his combat capability would diminish greatly for a short period of time after using the sword intent.

The second was to let Ye Qingtang die on the battlefield to help the Beiming Manor Chief vent his anger. A mere Yang Lord Eighth Heaven cultivator was not indispensable to Heaven City…

Gu Yu’s smile deepened as he watched a streak of sword intent slash out. He was extremely clear of You Tianhe’s combat capability, and Ye Qingtang would definitely be unable to block his full-blown sword intent attack no matter what she did.

Nevertheless, almost instantly, Gu Yu’s smile froze on his face utterly.

Ye Qingtang actually turned into a pitch-black flame before everyone’s eyes. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The force of the flame surged into the sky as though it was the very first spark of flame since the dawn of history.

Under everyone’s shocked gaze, the black flame crashed into You Tianhe’s sword intent violently.

At that moment, the sound of explosions rang incessantly. It was as though the sky had shattered and the end of the world had arrived.

The searing heat waves produced from the harsh crash of the sword intent and the flame flooded the surroundings. Some less-skilled You Ancient Clan figures who were nearby were instantly swept hundreds of meters away by the impact.

In the next second, You Tianhe’s face paled, and blood seeped out from the corner of his lips as he staggered backward continuously.

Once the force of the sword intent completely dispersed, the black flame condensed rapidly, and Ye Qingtang appeared before everyone again.

“Good fight,” Ye Qingtang said coldly as she looked at You Tianhe.

You Tianhe was silent for some time before finally speaking. “I lost…”
