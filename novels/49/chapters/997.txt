Chapter 998 Three Steps (1)

There seemed to be a treasure with extremely powerful offensive abilities on Ye Qingtang, and Clan Master Long did not underestimate her. All he wished was to kill Ye Qingtang with a strike and retrieve her treasure and space ring once she died.

“Tang Tang!”

Clan Master Ye Ling shouted and handed a top yellow-grade sword to Ye Qingtang immediately.

With things as such, it was already impossible to achieve a thaw with the Long Family. Ye Ling was, of course, aware of Long Family’s thoughts and plans. However, in the entire Ye Family, there was simply no one who could oppose Clan Master Long except perhaps Ye Qingtang…

However, Ye Qingtang did not even have any intention to receive the sword. She looked at Ye Qingtang and chuckled softly. “Father, take not a musket to kill a butterfly.”

After hearing what Ye Qingtang said, Ye Ling was completely dumbfounded. Going against a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, yet… take not a musket to kill a butterfly?!

“Young one, die!”

In an instant, the superior yellow-grade sword in Clan Master Long’s hand slashed down at Ye Qingtang.

The speed of this blow was extremely fast, and everyone could barely see it with their naked eyes. All they saw was a cold sword shadow flashing by.

Boom!

A loud sound erupted.

Before everyone’s eyes, Clan Master Long’s sword slashed down at Ye Qingtang’s left shoulder…

Before everyone could react…

“You… only have this much power?”

Ye Qingtang looked at Clan Master Long, who was inches away from her, and her lips curled into an unknown smile. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Not mentioning a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, in Ye Qingtang’s eyes, anyone below a Yang Lord was no different from an ant. Even if she remained at the same spot for him to kill her, a Yin Lord could barely injure her at all, much less a so-called half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

“You…”

At this instant, Clan Master Long’s expression changed slightly. His sword struck Ye Qingtang accurately, but it was as though he hit diamond. How could this be?!

“You have a death wish!”

Clan Master Long shouted coldly, and without thinking further, the superior yellow-grade weapon slashed down at Ye Qingtang once again.

This time, Clan Master Long used almost all his primordial qi, and a frightening primordial qi covered the superior yellow-grade sword. An extensive sword gleam that looked like it could destroy the world slashed down at Ye Qingtang’s crown.

Boom… Boom, boom!! Right after, an alarming explosion erupted, causing one to shudder and eardrums to hurt.

At the very moment when everyone returned to their senses, they could not help but be completely dumbfounded.

The senior members and disciples of the Ye Family were dumbstruck and seemed to have forgotten to breathe. Duan Tianrao was all the more horrified while Clan Master Duan and the Duan Family members looked as though they just saw a ghost.

Clan Master Long, a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, waved a superior yellow-grade sword and slashed it down at Ye Qingtang’s crown with all his might, but Ye Qingtang did not even blink an eye.

Ye Qingtang stared at Clan Master Long and said without emotions, “Too weak.”

Clan Master Long was in disbelief.

“Do you know… you messed up my hair?” Ye Qingtang’s brows were slightly furrowed.

“What did you say…?!” Clan Master Long reddened. As a dignified half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, he attacked Ye Qingtang with all his might, yet she said that his sword messed up her hair?!

In the next second, with the flick of a wrist, Ye Qingtang had already held Clan Master Long’s superior yellow-grade sword in her hands.
