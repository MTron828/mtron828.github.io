Chapter 2444: Big Yellow Dog (5)

The big yellow dog sprawled beside Ye Qingtang, peering at her from the corner of its eyes. It looked like it was considering something but then shook its head. “I think there’s no need. From your earlier punch, I can already tell your power level. You are even weaker than an infant.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Do you think I won’t throw you down this tree if you don’t stop spouting nonsense?” Ye Qingtang warned.

“I am not speaking nonsense but the truth. You are the weakest human I have ever met,” the big yellow dog continued unabashedly.

“Do you believe that I will kill with one punch?” Ye Qingtang threatened.

Before the big yellow dog could say anything further, Ye Qingtang scooped it up.

“Another earthquake is coming.” The big yellow dog’s ears perked up.

Immediately after that, the ground started to shake violently. Ye Qingtang’s tall tree was sent flying into the air, as if something was burrowing out of the ground beneath.

Hugging the big yellow dog, Ye Qingtang leaped nimbly across the air and landed safely on the ground. But her face turned grim the moment she landed and saw what was before her.

“This is bad…”

Ye Qingtang frowned as she watched the above-Emperor level monster crawl out from the ground.

Even Ye Qingtang never expected there to be an above-Emperor level monster under this area.

This above-Emperor level monster’s body was not as big as the previous ones. But its aura was even more terrifying, just like a condensed version of the earlier monsters.

“Damn it!”

Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth. Those above-Emperor level monsters she encountered earlier were already way beyond her level. And this one was even more terrifying…

Seeing Ye Qingtang’s grave expression, the big yellow dog just wagged its tail. “Why are you so scared? There’s nothing scary about this type of monster, it’s merely a pipsqueak at the bottom of the food chain.”

Bottom of… the food chain??

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. Who the hell gave it so many guts as to spout such shameless nonsense?

It couldn’t even endure a single light punch from her, but now it was claiming that this above-Emperor level monster was at the bottom of the food chain? Damn, did it even know what a food chain was?

Bottom? They were the ones who were at the bottom!

Of course, this big yellow dog belonged to an even lower level than Ye Qingtang.

“Roar!!”

Pain shot through Ye Qingtang’s eardrums. She felt like her soul was going to split into pieces from that thunderous roar.

“Run!”

Without any hesitation, Ye Qingtang poured all her energy into sprinting forward as fast as possible.

But the above-Emperor level monster had already detected Ye Qingtang and the big yellow dog. Seeing a human fleeing with a dog in her arms, the monster immediately gave chase.

It had no intention of letting Ye Qingtang escape.

…

The big yellow dog was annoyed. It harrumphed. “You weakling, why are you running? Fight it off. That monster is nothing. Why should we run? Stop running and beat it up!”

Ye Qingtang had no time or energy to deal with the dog.

“Shut up!” Ye Qingtang felt very irritated by the big yellow dog’s incessant nagging.

“You are really useless. You are the most useless human I have ever met. To think you’re even scared of a monster who exists at the bottom of the food chain. How embarrassing. Don’t you feel ashamed? You are a disgrace to Shi Tian!”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Who the hell was Shi Tian? She had never heard of this person before!

Boom!

An ear-splitting rumble shook the earth. The above-Emperor level monster leaped and landed right in front of Ye Qingtang’s path.
