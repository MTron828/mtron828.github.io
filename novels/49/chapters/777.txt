Chapter 778 Putting On A Complete Show (1)

Thinking of Ye Qingtang’s skills, the two disciples deliberated.

The rumored hidden clan was ancient and mysterious, and even a force like the Peerless School could not compare to them.

If he was really from the hidden clan, the two ordinary Peerless School disciples were truly not influential enough to offend him.

Then, the two of them exchanged a look and put on an arrogant front. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“We will let you off today, fellow.”

The two Peerless School disciples left directly after throwing that sentence.

As Ye Qingtang watched them leave, an undetectable smile passed her eyes.

Without thinking, she also knew what those two Peerless School disciples were deliberating about.

Hidden clans?

God knows where those hidden clans were living in seclusion at now.

However, Ye Qingtang could take advantage of this and put on an act.

Xuanyuan Lie stared blankly at the back view of the two Peerless School disciples. He did not know about the legend of the hidden clans and thus could not understand why those two disciples would suddenly stop and leave.

“Ye Chen, how bold of you! How dare you offend the Peerless School!” A trace of viciousness flashed across Xuanyuan Lie’s eyes as he turned around and headed to the main hall of Falling Sky Valley.

“Junior Brother Ye, what do we do now?” Yin Qingluo walked to Ye Qingtang’s side in a hurry. Although it was a good thing that those two Peerless School disciples suddenly left, Ye Qingtang did offend them, and this was anything but reassuring.

Ye Qingtang said, “Different situations call for different actions.”

In her previous life, the Peerless School was extremely rude to Falling Sky Valley. It collected Falling Sky Valley’s tributes and said it would protect Falling Sky Valley’s safety, but when Falling Sky Valley encountered a calamity, the Peerless School did not even provide any help.

If not for the fact that Ye Qingtang’s current skills could not win against the Peerless School, she would not need to make use of the hidden clan’s name to scare them and would have torn the entire Peerless School down.

After experiencing the Peerless School’s arrogance and witnessing Ye Qingtang helping them to vent their anger, the other Falling Sky Valley disciples were truly delighted.

However…

Before the disciples could gather around Ye Qingtang and talk to her, a warden rushed over and looked at Ye Qingtang with a stern expression.

“Ye Chen, the Valley Master ordered you to head to the main hall immediately.”

In the main hall, Perfected Xuanchen was solemn.

The Peak Masters and Elders in the main hall, similarly, had dark expressions.

Xuanyuan Lie was standing beside the Full Moon Peak Peak Master presently after notifying everyone of Ye Qingtang’s strife with the Peerless School envoys.

Offending the Peerless School was absolutely not what the Falling Sky Valley wanted to see.

In just a while, Ye Qingtang and Yin Qingluo entered the main hall with the warden from before.

“Disciple greets Master.” Ye Qingtang greeted with a bow.

Perfected Xuanchen looked at the disciple before him with a slight frown and a heavy head.

Before waiting for Perfected Xuanchen to speak, the Full Moon Peak Peak Master from aside shouted coldly. “Ye Chen, you committed a heinous crime. Kneel down now!”

Ye Qingtang looked up with a flat expression.

“I did not do anything wrong. Why do I need to kneel?”

“You’re still reluctant to admit your mistakes?” The Full Moon Peak Peak Master narrowed his eyes and looked at Ye Qingtang coldly. “You entered the valley for less than half a month, but you have already caused troubles in the valley continuously. Now, you even dare to be disrespectful to the Peerless School envoys? You did not just do something wrong. You clearly committed a crime worthy of death!”
