Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“What about me... I can’t control the energy inside my body.” A little kid from the Fire Tribe with flames all over his body jumped out. “If I set the Floating Island on fire one more time, the elders will kick me out!”

Ye Qingtang was surrounded by the little kids in an instant. They were all of young age and most of their problems were foundational. As they hadn’t become part of the Temple of Paragon, they naturally didn’t know what the Holy Lord looked like.

They saw Ye Qingtang come with Elder Hua and they also saw that she was kind enough to guide the little winged child along. So it was no surprise that they thought that Ye Qingtang was sent by Elder Hua to teach them how to cultivate.

Ye Qingtang wasn’t planning to get involved. She wanted to reject them but these adorable kids started surrounding them.

“...”

This was too unfair, they weren’t playing by the rules!

Ye Qingtang never liked being a busybody but when it came to children, she had a soft spot for them.

Moreover...

They were simply adorable.

“Come on, one at a time.”

In the end, Ye Qingtang could only give in.

They only faced problems with foundational skills. After 300 years, solutions to these problems have been developed. It wasn’t difficult for Ye Qingtang to just guide them along.

After getting an answer from Ye Qingtang, their hearts were lifted. The children started queuing up, waiting for Ye Qingtang to answer their concerns.

Everything was witnessed by the elders in the Temple of Paragon. They could take the previous incident of teaching the winged person how to gather his energy as a mere coincidence, but this time, they were completely stupefied.

Ye Qingtang started offering advice for every little alien race. Though it was just foundational problems, her solutions made the elders in the Temple of Paragon completely stunned.

“The Fire Tribe can control themselves like that?” The corners of Elder Bai’s mouth twitched.

Elder Hua was filled with admiration as she watched Ye Qingtang teach a little girl from the Ice Clan how to gather the icy air.

Though it wasn’t profound martial arts knowledge, her methods were a novelty for the various alien races.

The results were flawless!

Quite a number of elders who were convinced that Ye Qingtang wasn’t a reincarnation of the Holy Lord couldn’t say a single word when they witnessed the scene.

If she wasn’t a reincarnated Holy Lord...

She would be a rare superhuman that would only appear once in ten thousand years.

She was able to easily dispel the problems of the alien races and provide creative cultivation methods that had never been heard of at such a young age.

“Our Holy Lord is great! Even when she has reincarnated as a human, she still impresses us with her powers.” Elder Hua was filled with admiration for Ye Qingtang.

“Though our Holy Lord has lost her memories, she still has retained pieces of her memories from 300 years ago. We just need to help her piece these memories together and she could perhaps recall everything from her past lifetime. Even if our Holy Lord can’t remember anything, we can groom her to become even more powerful than what she was in her past lifetime. She is our Holy Lord, no matter what she has become this lifetime, she’s still worthy of my respect.”

Many elders agreed with Elder Hua, except a small portion of elders who remained quiet. They were wary and though they were impressed by Ye Qingtang’s martial arts knowledge, they still couldn’t easily attest to her identity.

But they were nonetheless in favor of helping Ye Qingtang recover her memories and grooming her.
