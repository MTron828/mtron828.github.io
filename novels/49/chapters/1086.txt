Chapter 1087 Is It A Pity? (2)

“Ancient clan…”

Ye Qingtang stared at the gold carriages that were being pulled by a few demons in the air, and her expression changed.

She never expected that the historical records were actually real and not a hoax.

No one knew how powerful the hidden ancient clan was, and the initial Blood Moon Sect probably could not be compared to it.

The development of the issue had way surpassed Ye Qingtang’s expectations.

All of this was a chain reaction after the Dimension Wall broke.

Once the Dimension Wall broke, powerful figures from the outside world would come to snatch the Spiritual Abode. As such, Divine King Luo Xue made up his mind to destroy the world, and his determination activated the Heavenly Tribulation array formation that had been laid on him ten thousand years ago.

Ye Qingtang guessed that the hidden ancient clan was probably from the same generation as Divine King Luo Xue and was closely related to Divine King Luo Xue and the extraordinary lady…

The blood-colored lightning continued on, but the sky darkened. A small drizzle rained down in no time.

The virtual image of the lady remained beside Divine King Luo Xue, and her face was as calm still water.

Ten thousand years later, it was as though it was their first meeting ten thousand years ago.

Divine King Luo Xue stood up slowly and looked at the familiar yet foreign lady before him. After ten thousand years of longing, he could no longer hold himself back.

Divine King Luo Xue stretched a hand out towards the lady. His fingers trembled as he desperately wanted to hold onto something.

However, his five fingers passed through that lady’s body. There was nothing other than air. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yun… It’s me… Have you forgotten? In the Nine Lives Palace under the bodhi tree, you said that in this life… you will marry no one but me…” There was a trace of anticipation in Divine King Luo Xue’s eyes as though he was hoping for You Yun to react.

Nonetheless, it was as if the lady did not hear anything as she merely guarded in front of Divine King Luo Xue to dispel the blood-colored streaks of lightning.

He clearly remembered what happened ten thousand years ago.

After You Yun died, Divine King Luo Xue came to a little tree with You Yun’s heart. With that one sit, no one knew how many times the grass on the ground withered and the skies changed.

Day after day. Year after year.

Over the years… The little tree grew into a towering tree with fertile soil in the surroundings.

That day, Divine King Luo Xue’s black hair turned into snow-white.

It was also that day where he buried all his love under the soil. From then on, he changed his appearance and concealed his identity. There no longer was a Divine King Luo Xue in the world anymore.

Now, ten thousand years later, Divine King Luo Xue finally met You Yun once again.

That lady who dared to love and hate and always told him that she would not marry anyone else but him.

That lady who exhausted all his divine power and scattered her love all over this mainland.That lady whose temple was destroyed and flesh was distributed out to be eaten, who left the world with intense resentment.

In these ten thousand years, he tried his best to forget himself and You Yun and almost went insane.

At this moment, ten thousand years of hard work was so fragile.

Even for a lady who died from misery, her obsession at the very last moment was still Divine King Luo Xue.

Ten thousand years ago, Divine King Luo Xue faced a huge calamity, and You Yun’s obsession appeared once again.

“You can’t hear my voice… You can’t hear my voice…”

As Divine King Luo Xue looked at You Yun, it was as though his heart was being ripped apart.

Luo Xue was already old, but You Yun was still like back then. Her face had never changed… It was so familiar… and so foreign.
