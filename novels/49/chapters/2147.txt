Chapter 2148: Teaching (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The puppets used by the puppet masters had to be personally crafted by them. The further the range of control, the higher the skill level required. Although puppet masters then were very powerful, they had rather weak physical bodies. Most puppet masters would hide out in a dark corner and use their puppets to perform tasks. As a result, no one really knew what the most famous puppet masters looked like.

Ye Qingtang did not focus much on puppet skills as she preferred to strengthen her own body, or rather... she was unable to carve such exquisite puppets.

“Can... Can I?” Mu Ziying’s eyes brightened.

“In the future, come to my classroom and I will teach you.” Ye Qingtang disabled the Spirit Control Line and returned the puppet to Mu Ziying. She had only practiced up to level one of the Spirit Control Line technique, and could only control a puppet within a range of three meters.

Mu Ziying nodded solemnly before breaking out into a smile for the first time. Her grim little face was instantly transformed into a radiant one.

Seeing the small girl’s hopeful expression, Ye Qingtang smiled and patted Mu Ziying’s shoulder before turning to leave.

She had managed to settle another brat, but...

As Ye Qingtang turned, the Spirit Control Line which she had just released seemed to have detected something strange about that puppet.

It was the bloody aura of decay...

It seemed like that puppet was not as simple as it appeared.

...

Ye Qingtang had settled Mu Ziying. Meanwhile, Meng Yao, who had endured fifteen strokes of the cane, was full of rage and humiliation.

“Damn scoundrel. If not for the fact that he is a teacher, I would never let him humiliate me like this!” Meng Yao gritted her teeth. She felt a strong urge to skin Ye Qing alive. That Ye Qing had a lower cultivation level than her but managed to one-up her just because she was a teacher.

Meng Yao could not disobey and had no choice but to comply.

“Where did that Teacher Ye come from? When did our academy hire such a lousy teacher? Could he be a fake?” One of the teenage girls found it very suspicious.

“I don’t think so... I heard that the academy arranged for a new teacher for Mu Ziying and a few other students. And Mu Ziying addressed him as Teacher earlier. He can’t be a fake...” Another teenage girl piped up.

“But I also heard that the new teacher is not an official teacher. He seems to be on probation...”

“Probation?” Meng Yao became even more incensed at this information.

“That lousy scum. He’s not even an official teacher but dared to use the academy regulations to bully me... we are not going back anymore. Come with me to find Teacher Di Nuo!” Meng Yao gritted her teeth. Di Nuo was her direct teacher. As he was on good terms with Meng Yao’s family, Di Nuo usually took extra care of Meng Yao on campus.

This was also one of the reasons why Meng Yao dared to bully others on campus.

...

When Jing Ze returned to the classroom the next day, he saw that there was a petite figure already inside.

Mu Ziying was sitting quietly in the corner, her head lowered as she played with her puppet. She appeared not to have noticed Jing Ze’s arrival at all.

Jing Ze was still feeling surprised when Ye Qingtang entered.

Hearing Ye Qingtang’s footsteps, Mu Ziying immediately lifted her head and stared at her with sparkling eyes.

What was going on?

“Teacher Ye.” Mu Ziying hurriedly stood up and bowed respectfully toward Ye Qingtang.
