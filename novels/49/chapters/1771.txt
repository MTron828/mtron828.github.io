Chapter 1772: Great General (1)

All living creatures swallowed by the Soul-Devouring Beast would instantly melt into a bloody liquid and become part of the beast itself.

In the blink of an eye, all the monsters outside the camp were engulfed by the Soul-Devouring Beast. Within the opaque black swirls, one could see those huge monsters instantly dissolve into mush, leaving behind bare bones.

This was a nearly full-grown Soul-Devouring Beast...

Its powers had already surpassed that of an Emperor level. Like this, the fiendish demon camp was suddenly faced with a great enemy.

Since the Soul-Devouring Beast’s body was formless and the sharp claws of the fiendish demons were useless against it. This was the most challenging type of monster for the fiendish demons.

“There shouldn’t be any Soul-Devouring Beasts in this area. When did this beast come over here?” The demons couldn’t help panicking.

They seldom encountered Soul-Devouring Beasts in this area and tried their best to stay out its way. How did this thing suddenly appear over here?

“All fiendish demons are to immediately evacuate from the entrance. The little fiendish demons are to go back into the cave.” Hu’s face was very grim. It was a huge challenge to handle a Soul-Devouring Beast.

Some of the more powerful fiendish demons had already started attacking the Soul-Devouring Beast, but their sharp claws were totally ineffective against that mighty beast.

Part of the Soul-Devouring Beast had already drifted into the camp and some demons who didn’t manage to get out of the way in time were engulfed and instantly dissolved.

This was the first time Ye Qingtang was seeing a Soul-Devouring Beast up close. It was also the first time she had seen such a huge one. This Soul-Devouring Beast was powerful enough to engulf all the fiendish demons here!

Hu had assigned some of the demons to go over and stop the Soul-Devouring Beast from advancing further. But the results were negligible. Although the fiendish demons were able to disperse the formless body of the Soul-Devouring Beast with their demon aura, the monster’s body would instantly coagulate back again.

Just as the body of the Soul-Devouring Beast coagulated once again and it was prepared to move toward a group of demons, a black figure suddenly scurried out from a hill behind the beast.

The black figure moved very fast and was impossible to capture.

Hovering in mid-air, the black figure suddenly unleashed a tremendous demon aura. It enveloped the Soul-Devouring Beast, causing it to freeze on the spot and go into spasms.

The demon aura covering the Soul-Devouring Beast kept compressing. With a loud roar, the beast made a sound like the loud crashing of ocean waves slamming against the cliffs.

But no matter how hard the Soul-Devouring Beast struggled or roared, it was unable to escape the constraints of the demon aura. Its body was slowly being condensed and pulled upward into mid-air. Suddenly, the huge beast was being sucked right into the black figure!

A strong wind gushed by and Ye Qingtang watched on as the massive Soul-Devouring Beast was quickly being absorbed! If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, she would have found it hard to believe that there could be anything in this world that could swallow that huge Soul-Devouring Beast!

“Great General!” Cheers erupted from the fiendish demons. Following those cheers, all the demons in the camp immediately fell to their knees. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The Great General was the top leader of all of the fiendish demons!
