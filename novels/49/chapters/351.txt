Chapter 352: Sword Spirit Workshop (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Demonic Blood Sword itself was already powerful, but to Ye Qingtang, it was not enough.

Ye Qingtang still had over ten Spirit Crystals in her hands!

Using a special method to embed the Spirit Crystals in a weapon could directly raise its combat effectiveness by an entire grade!

When Ye Qingtang bought that batch of Spirit Crystals from Tong Hua, she already had a plan in mind. However, her sword was too inferior that time, and there would not have been any huge combat power increases even if she were to embed Spirit Crystals in it.

However, the Demonic Blood Sword she had currently was different.

As long as Spirit Crystals were embedded in it, Ye Qingtang was confident that she could make the Demonic Blood Sword as powerful as those supposed divine weapons!

After making up her mind, Ye Qingtang brought the Demonic Blood Sword and headed towards the Sword Spirit Workshop.

The Sword Spirit Workshop was a place to forge weapons in exchange for Xuanming points and was, however, only opened to inner sect disciples. If any disciples wanted to make a weapon, they could head to the Sword Spirit Workshop directly and request the blacksmiths to help them as long as they had enough Xuanming points to pay.

In her previous life, although Ye Qingtang did hear of the Sword Spirit Workshop, she had never been there herself. After all…

The fee for the Sword Spirit Workshop was not what she could afford previously.

When Ye Qingtang was about to reach the Sword Spirit Workshop, she saw two disciples walking out from the workshop with rather ugly expressions.

“I told you not to go to the Sword Spirit Workshop, but you didn’t believe me. Now that you’ve been met with a flat refusal, do you believe me now?” a disciple said impolitely.

The other disciple wailed. “I only heard that the blacksmiths in the Sword Spirit Workshop have a huge temper but did not expect them to be so arrogant. Forging a dagger actually required tens of thousands of Xuanming points… How can this be? Isn’t this the same as snatching money?”

“Quickly shut up! If those blacksmiths hear this, you will have a hard time in the future.”

“Clearly, they are the ones who are arrogant. They’re just a group of blacksmiths but behave more haughtily than the inner sect wardens. Why can’t I talk about them?”

“Why do you think they can be so haughty? Isn’t it all because the Grand Elder is supporting them? If they reported what you said, do you still wish to stay in the inner sect? It’s not like you don’t know that our Grand Elder loves blacksmithing. The Sword Spirit Workshop is said to be for disciples to forge a weapon, but doesn’t it serve the Grand Elder in reality? Otherwise, do you think that a blacksmith’s position would be higher than a warden’s?”

“It is said that way, but no one has seen the Grand Elder in the Sword Spirit Workshop before.”

“Do you think the Grand Elder is free on normal days? Why would he be in the Sword Spirit Workshop for nothing?”

The two disciples chatted for quite a while, and their expressions turned uglier.

Ye Qingtang brushed past those two people, and her eyes narrowed when she heard their conversation.

She had also heard some rumors regarding the Sword Spirit Workshop in her previous life. Although this place had high mastery in sword-making, there were not many disciples who dared to go. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Not because of anything else, but the very fact that the blacksmiths in the Sword Spirit Workshop were extremely haughty.

The Sword Spirit Workshop was initially opened because of the interest of the previous Sect Master, who was also the current Grand Elder.

The Grand Elder’s position in the sect was way higher than the Sect Master’s, and he was the highest skilled figure in all sects. He would not appear in the sect on usual days and only struck when the sect faced a crisis.

He could be said to be extremely mysterious.
