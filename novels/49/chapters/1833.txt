Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

But as though they had sensed something amiss, the tentacles dragged Zhan Rao straight into the depths of the huge mouth.

“Go now!”

Zhan Rao only had time to roar out one last time before being swallowed whole. He didn’t want to drag Ye Qingtang down and shouted at her to let him go!

In the blink of an eye, he vanished.

Ye Qingtang looked at the shut lips, which were quickly covered by the other undead. The only thing left in her mind was his last screams.

The undead began reaching for her again.

Pent up emotions welled up, bursting to the surface as Ye Qingtang watched her comrade being swallowed whole. A huge wave of black flames surrounded her, and the undead drew back, crawling silently on the floor, afraid of the flames.

“You need to think of a way to destroy the Cursed True God’s bones soon, or we’re going to die here,” said Little White Tiger.

This entire place was strange.

Zhan Rao’s last words conveyed very clearly the terrifying nature underlying this place. Under their feet were countless huge mouths waiting to devour them. If one wasn’t careful, they would be dragged into those gaping teeth by an army of tentacles.

Ye Qingtang breathed in deeply and jumped onto Little White Tiger’s back. Then they rushed towards the Cursed True God.

But just as they were nearing the Cursed True God, the sea of undead below them shook and a huge hill suddenly erupted in front of it.

“What’s happening?” Little White Tiger was forced to a stop. The moment it stopped, a wave of demonic aura shot out from the hill towards the sky.

The undead on the hill were turned to dust in an instant.

From the surge of the demonic aura, a tall, black shadow appeared in front of them. The black shadow was at least 10 meters tall and was covered in dark red flames with black armor around it. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It stood quietly in front of the bones of the Cursed True God, holding the Blazing Flame Sword. Just like a guardian preventing them from approaching the Cursed True God.

“What is that... what strong demonic aura.” The Little White Tiger’s eyes widened. The black-armored shadow was completed enshrouded with an intense, demonic aura.

But what shocked Little White Tiger most was that the demonic aura on this shadow was in no way inferior to that on Little Heavenly Demon.

“Don’t tell me... is this a Heavenly Demon?”

What kind of joke was this!

Little White Tiger was about to go mad!

Why would there be a Heavenly Demon in the Cemetery of the True Gods?

“Did you just say it’s a Heavenly Demon?” Ye Qingtang was shocked as well.

What was going on?

“Look carefully at the black armor on it.”

Ye Qingtang looked closer and realized that there were red totems on the black armor surrounded by dark red flames. They looked really familiar...

“Is that the totem of the Heavenly Demons?”

Little White Tiger nodded. ” This is an armor that only the Heavenly Demons can use. But... why would there be one here?”

Ye Qingtang was confused as well. There was no change at all to the bones of the Cursed True God even when the Heavenly Demon appeared.

Why on earth had a Heavenly Demon appeared here? It was standing protectively in front of the Cursed True God’s bones, seemingly ready to guard it with its life.
