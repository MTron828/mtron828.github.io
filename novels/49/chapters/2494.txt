The Blood Moon Elder did not want anything to do with his main body and was unwilling to have any contact with it. After all, he knew that his main body was in the Second Domain. If he followed Ye Qingtang to the Second Domain, he might meet his main body.

“You’re so afraid of your main body.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder and said with a faint smile.

Actually, the Blood Moon Elder’s main body was not that terrifying. In fact, if the people from the Temple of Paragon did not think that she was the reincarnation of the Holy Lord, she would definitely be executed as a clone.

“Holy Lady, of course I’m afraid. My main body will definitely kill me. When we were in the First Domain, you said that even if my main body wanted to kill me, he would not waste that time and effort. Now that we are in the Second Domain, the situation will be different. If we meet one day, my main body will be able to kill me easily. It’s no different from killing an ant.” The Blood Moon Elder sighed helplessly.

Moreover, even with his appearance changed, even if he had changed into a completely new body, it would be useless. Regardless of how he looked, his main body would be able to recognize him at a glance.

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, the Blood Moon Elder continued, “Holy Lady… I have a small suggestion.”

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and said to the Blood Moon Elder, “Alright, speak. I will listen.”

“Holy Lady, why did we come to the Second Domain? Have you never heard of a saying that one would rather be a chicken’s tail than a phoenix’s head…”

Immediately, the big yellow dog glanced at the Blood Moon Elder and wagged its tail. “I seem to remember the saying as one would rather be a phoenix’s tail than a chicken’s head?”

“None of your business, dog.” The Blood Moon Elder looked at the big yellow dog unhappily.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. This man and dog could be brothers…

“Are you trying to say that you would rather be a chicken’s head than a phoenix’s tail?” Ye Qingtang asked the Blood Moon Elder.

“Something like that… who cares, the meaning is the same anyway,” the Blood Moon Elder said.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

How were they the same?

“Holy Lady, regardless, it’s fine as long as you understand what I mean. Now that the Ancient You Clan has been defeated by the Holy Lady, we will definitely be invincible if we stay in the First Mainland. We will not have any opponents!” The Blood Moon Elder was rather agitated. “Holy Lady, just imagine the scenario.”

“What scenario?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

“Invincibility!” The Blood Moon Elder closed his eyes as if he had already imagined the scene. He said excitedly, “Imagine… a sea of people and tens of thousands of dynasties coming to pay their respects. We will be the gods of the First Mainland… no, Holy Lady, you are a god and I am the messenger of the gods. We can do whatever we want and all the resources of the First Mainland will be ours!”

Ye Qingtang was about to say something when the big yellow dog spoke first, “Your personality and face are really similar.”

“Dog, what do you mean?” The Blood Moon Elder glanced at the big yellow dog.

“Sigh, what a good-for-nothing… I’ve heard of it before. People reach for higher grounds, while water sinks to the bottom,” said the yellow dog. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Holy Lady, is this your pet?” The Blood Moon Elder asked Ye Qingtang after a long while.

In response, Ye Qingtang only shook her head.. She wanted it to be but she did not have the ability.
