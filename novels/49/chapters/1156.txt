Chapter 1157: The Spirit Energy Crisis (3)

Just the thought of this gave the Blood Moon Elder goosebumps all over. He hollered immediately.

“Stop fighting, everyone!”

The voice of Blood Moon Elder’s new body was shocking, and his shout was like a thunderous roar that pierced everyone’s eardrums.

As expected, both parties looked at the Blood Moon Elder after the shout.

Noticing that everyone finally stopped fighting, the Blood Moon Elder hurriedly pointed to the sky.

“Look for yourselves…”

Everyone looked up, and what laid before them stunned them utterly.

The clouds in the sky above them seemed to be burnt as a result of the maximum compression and outward expansion of spirit energy.

“Burnt clouds…” Ultimate Elder was astonished.

The Ultimate Elder and the Pagoda Sword Master were high-level figures and knew what was going on roughly after a slight inspection.

If they continued the fight with You Ancient Clan, the spirit energy would be expanded to the maximum in no time, and the massive pressure released was sufficient to destroy this mainland.

Given the scale of the explosion produced by the spirit energy, this mainland would completely disappear from the Earth’s surface in at most three to five breaths’ time.

Moreover, in this extremely short span of time, even a Holy Venerate level figure who came here might not be able to escape this place alive…

Similarly, people from the You Ancient Clan noticed the unusual phenomenon in the sky.

“Everyone, stop!”

The green-robed You Tong, one of the three Generals of Ancient You Clan, shouted with a deep frown.

Their martial skills had exceeded the limit that this low-level mainland could bear, and if they continued to fight, they would be unable to obtain the Spiritual Abode or even leave this place alive.

Both parties did not dare to make a move recklessly.

The main force of both parties had ordered to stop the fight, and the burnt clouds in the sky caused uneasiness. No one dared to take any rash and unconsidered actions. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Everyone, you all have seen the situation.” Pagoda Sword Master looked at the three Generals of the Ancient You Clan and said.

Their powers had already exceeded the limit that this mainland could bear, and they were even gathered together. The originally perilous spirit energy of this mainland could no longer withstand the powers unleashed in the intense mass battle. If they continued the battle, the spirit energy of this mainland and, subsequently, the entire mainland would explode ultimately…

All of them would die here.

A one-eyed elderly of You Ancient Clan coldly said, “It is simple. Since we can’t battle in the same place, we can split up the battlefield.”

Their objective for coming to this mainland was to obtain You Yun’s Spiritual Abode and would definitely not put an end to their plan. On the other hand, the powerful figures of this mainland, with Ultimate Elder and Pagoda Sword Master in the lead, would not sit idly and wait for death.

This war was unavoidable yet also could not continue in this way.

Otherwise, both sides would be over.

The only strategy now was to disperse the powers of the masses to prevent the suicidal act of an aggressive battle at one spot.

The other two Generals’ eyes brightened at that suggestion. As long as the battlefield was spread out, the pressure from the war would naturally be dispersed… By then, such a circumstance would not happen.

You Yun’s Spiritual Abode must be obtained and had to be brought back to You Ancient Clan’s headquarters no matter what. This was the do-or-die order given by the senior executives of the headquarters.
