Chapter 873 Gap

No one could see clearly how Perfected Gu Yun attacked, and even Ye Qingtang merely saw the track of his punch.

Nonetheless, in the next second, a loud thunderous boom erupted. Feng Wudang, pale, was hurled away before crashing at a far place like a kite with a snapped string.

Puff!

Feng Wudang spat a mouthful of blood after landing on the ground.

Very quickly, Perfected Gu Yun placed the Dharma treasure back in his space ring before sweeping a glance at everyone as though he was looking at ants. He said coldly, “Do I still need to use the Heaven Tremor Seal the second time to deal with you all?”

“You!” As though she was facing a strong enemy, Li Bingxue immediately unsheathed her sword with a sharp sound.

“Junior Sister Ye, Senior Sister Ye, let’s join forces and fight it out with Perfected Gu Yun!” Gu Tianhe looked at Ye Qingtang and Li Bingxue individually.

Even if Perfected Gu Yun’s skills were repressed to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm in this mainland, they could not be compared to Perfected Gu Yun in any aspect even though they were all at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm as well.

In these past few days, Ye Qingtang’s body had completely used up the spirit energy in the Glazed Cup, and her martial realm was stabilized at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven, yet it was still too far away compared to Perfected Gu Yun.

For Li Bingxue and Gu Tianhe, they currently only had the combat power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Fourth Heaven.

Meanwhile, Perfected Gu Yun was at the Divine Arcane Supremacy realm in the Central Mainland, and although his martial skills were severely repressed, he still had the combat power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven!

Currently, even if Ye Qingtang, Li Bingxue, and Gu Tianhe joined forces, there was no possibility of winning given the overly-huge gap between them and Perfected Gu Yun.

Ye Qingtang could not help but find it a pity. If Perfected Gu Yun did not have the Heaven Tremor Seal, a Divine Arcane Supremacy Dharma treasure, it was impossible for him to break the Sealed Sky Formation, which was equivalent to a definite death…

That way, Ye Qingtang’s Spirit Ring could be saved. However, the current circumstances were completely beyond control, and the Spirit Ring was Ye Qingtang’s last hidden card.

Ye Qingtang had an extremely solemn expression. According to what Ling Yan had said, the Spirit Ring could only be used once, and she had to achieve a kill within a shot. Otherwise… she, Li Bingxue, and Gu Tianhe would definitely die today!

“Lowly dog, I want your life!”

An extremely frightening martial aura exploded from Li Bingxue. She turned into a passing shadow, and she slashed her sword towards Perfected Gu Yun.

Noticing the situation, Gu Tianhe launched a killing move as well and fought Perfected Gu Yun with his life.

The two people were not foolish and naturally understood that if they did not fight it out with Perfected Gu Yun today, they probably would not have any more chance to do it again.

Perfected Gu Yun’s skills were much more powerful than theirs, and even if they fled, it was simply impossible for them to escape from Perfected Gu Yun’s hands.

If they did not go all out, they would definitely die, but if they did, perhaps there was still a possibility of survival!

However, Ye Qingtang remained far away and did not join forces with Li Bingxue and Gu Tianhe. Instead, she continuously changed her angle and position in search of the best opportunity. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ye Qingtang was aware that she only had one chance and that the outcome would be disastrous if she failed this time!

Boom!

Pow!

Before long, Perfected Gu Yun struck a fist and a palm out at the same time. Li Bingxue and Gu Tianhe, who were no match for Perfected Gu Yun, were flung far away from the impact successively.

“Die!”

With a stern shout, Perfected Gu Yun grabbed Gu Tianhe’s body and wanted to tear Gu Tianhe into pieces with unparalleled brute force.

A miserable cry escaped Gu Tianhe’s mouth.
