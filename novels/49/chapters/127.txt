Chapter 128: Outer Sect Disciple (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The middle-aged man brought the selected candidates into the outer sect.

Everything in the sect amazed the young boys and girls who just entered the sect. However, they were all very smart to suppress their emotions and listened to the middle-aged man’s orders detailedly.

The outer sect disciples stayed at the same location with three people in a room, males and females separated.

Ye Qingtang was assigned to a room. Apart from her, Su Wan, who entered as the same batch as her, was assigned to that room as well.

In the room, other than the two new disciples, there was another person.

The moment she opened the door and entered the room, Ye Qingtang saw an aloof figure sitting at a table alone. Even when she and Su Wan entered the room, that girl had not looked up at all.

“Su Wan greets Senior Sister.” The gentle Su Wan was very sensible and stepped forward to greet the girl obediently when she saw the girl sitting there.

That girl was tall and had sharp features but exuded detachment and indifference. When she heard Su Wan’s voice, she merely took a look perfunctorily without replying a single word. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Su Wan’s expression turned a little ugly, but she smartly did not show anything on her face. She walked to an empty bed at a side and unpacked her luggage a little.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept over that aloof girl, but a yearning expression emerged in her eyes.

In her previous life, she was also allocated into this room, and there was not a change in the people in the room.

Su Wan was still Su Wan, and this aloof girl still remained there.

She was Lin Long. She had a green spirit root and was pretty talented. However, she was usually very silent and did not bother others at all. That time, Ye Qingtang stayed in this room for many years and only heard Lin Long say a few words in total.

Ye Qingtang originally did not have anything to do with Lin Long, but because Lin Long once stepped up to resolve Ye Qingtang’s predicament, Ye Qingtang remembered this favor.

“Ye Qingtang greets Senior Sister Lin,” Ye Qingtang stepped forward slowly and said with gratitude.

A word “Senior Sister Lin” made Lin Long, who was looking down, look up slightly at the stunning-looking girl in front of her.

“How do you know my name?” Lin Long’s cold voice rang.

“There is a ‘Lin’ sewed on Senior Sister Lin’s sleeve, so I took a bold guess.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

Lin Long looked down at the barely legible “Lin” word on the bamboo leaves image sewed on her sleeves. Her eyes glistened as she raised her head and took a look at Ye Qingtang, though her expression remained the same.

“Ye Qingtang? I’ll remember.”

Afterward, she continued looking at the book in her hand without wanting to say anymore.

Ye Qingtang had been used to Lin Long’s aloofness long ago and did not think much about it as she went to settle her own matters.

The rooms of Xuanling Sect’s disciples were relatively wide. Even if there were three people in a room, each person had their own individual space, and it did not seem crowded.

Ye Qingtang laid her bedsheets and sat by her bed, carrying the little lightning dragon which had been nested in her arms for a long time. The little figure seemed a little tired and laid in Ye Qingtang’s arms listlessly with its tiny head in Ye Qingtang’s palm.

Ye Qingtang realized that once the little lightning dragon turned into human form, it would become unusually frail. It was also the first time Ye Qingtang raised a lightning dragon, and she really could not understand what was going on with it.

Luckily, it did not have any other special reaction apart from being tired.

Only then was she put at ease.

After feeding the little lightning dragon a few spirit stones, Ye Qingtang started thinking about how to walk down the route in the sect.
