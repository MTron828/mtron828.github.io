Chapter 223: Blood Plague (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even Lin Long, who always appeared to be indifferent, felt enraged towards Zhou Xuan. Apparently, he tried to make things difficult on purpose.

Ye Qingtang smiled at Zhou Xuan who was full of cunning.

She was still contemplating why Zhou Xuan became so kind, but actually, he left this inhumane task for her.

If she accomplished the task, Zhou Xuan would definitely take the credit from her. If she failed, he would not have to touch the corpses and did not have the chance to get infected. He would not lose anything.

He would gain all the credits eventually and suppress the rest with the sect’s honor. The few people who were infected with the blood plague might not be able to leave this place anymore.

Such a perfect plan.

Zhou Xuan squinted his eyes as he did not receive any reaction from Ye Qingtang.

“Junior Sister Ye, we had never looked down on you as a new disciple during this mission. And we did not create any troubles for you deliberately just because you possess the red spirit root. We took care for you the whole time, and now that Junior Sister Lin and the rest are infected with the blood plague, are you willing to let them investigate when they are ill? As a human being… you need to learn how to be gracious… Do not be so selfish…”

The beautiful words Zhou Xuan said to Ye Qingtang sounded so pleasant.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes darkened. However, she laughed after a short while. She glanced at Zhou Xuan’s hypocritic face.

“Senior Brother Zhou is correct. I will be in charge of the investigation. Rest assured.” Ye Qingtang replied.

It was out of everyone’s expectation that Ye Qingtang compromised. Lin Long frowned and wanted to pull Ye Qingtang to stop her decision. She withdrew her hand when she realized that she could not touch Ye Qingtang when she was infected with the blood plague.

“I shall say thank you first then.” Zhou Xuan smiled and gave a few orders to the Apothecary before he left.

The shocked disciple immediately asked the Apothecary to check his situation.

Lin Long threw a glance towards Ye Qingtang and left the room.

Ye Qingtang followed.

“You should not have agreed to that,” Lin Long said and frowned to Ye Qingtang when they were outside the room.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes softened. “We have to accomplish the mission. Senior Sister Lin, you just rest for these few days, and I will find out the truth.”

Lin Long shook her head and sighed.

“I saw the competition between you and Zhou Qu the other day. Zhou Qu was injured mysteriously afterward, but I knew it was because of you. Zhou Xuan is not a generous person, and he will not let go so easily. You are lucky that you are not infected with the blood plague. You are killing yourself if you go back to the Spirit Condensation Mountain Village.”

Lin Long did not know why she said those words to Ye Qingtang, but she always felt that Ye Qingtang was different from the rest. Though they did not talk much in the past, she took extra care for her.

Ye Qingtang lowered her eyes to hide the smile she had. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Senior Sister Lin is still a cold-outside-but-warm-inside person as in the previous life.

“Senior Sister Lin, you don’t need to worry for me. I will take care of myself.” Ye Qingtang then took out a bottle of elixir and handed it over to Lin Long.

“The elixir can’t cure the blood plague, but it can nourish the breath and blood in your body. You should keep it for now.” The Si family Master asked Si Bai to give her the elixirs for emergency purposes when she left the Lin town.

Lin Long took over the elixirs and sighed softly.

“Thank you, if you insist. Then, be more cautious.”

“Sure.” Ye Qingtang smiled and replied, but she promised to herself that she would not allow Lin Long to suffer from the blood plague.
