Chapter 959 Ye Family (3)

Ye Qingtang quietly listened to what her father said.

Considering the Ye Family’s present circumstances, her father and Second Uncle’s strategy was correct.

The Ye Family was one of the three major aristocratic families in Lin Town. It certainly could not depend solely on Ye Ling, who had recently recovered from his injuries, and Second Elder to prop it up.

In her previous life, Ye You’s grandfather had harmed her father and Second Uncle, and the Ye Family had fallen into their enemies’ hands. In this life, everything had changed. However, Ye Qingtang was unfamiliar with the two new Elders.

After some small talk with Ye Qingtang, Ye Ling stood up.

“Perhaps the Great Elder has something to discuss. I’ll go have a look.”

“I’ll go with you, Father,” said Ye Qingtang.

Ye Ling looked a little hesitant, but when he met Ye Qingtang’s bright eyes, he could only nod calmly. After they left the study, Ye Ling said to Ye Qingtang earnestly,

“Tang Tang, it was really not easy for you to enter the Xuanling Sect. As your father, my only wish is for you to peacefully cultivate within the sect. If you have the opportunity one day to enter the inner sect, that would be the best, but if that is not possible, then I hope you will be safe and at peace.”

Ye Ling had not expected Ye Qingtang to suddenly return in the midst of trouble. However, he was truly unwilling for his own daughter to be dragged into this matter.

“I understand, Father.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Ye Ling did not say anything more and immediately led Ye Qingtang away from the study, towards the main hall of the Ye house.

Second Elder was sitting in the main hall of the Ye house with a solemn expression. By his side sat two old men, both over fifty years of age.

“The Duan Family has become increasingly daring of late,” the old man sitting at the head of the table said with a frown. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

His name was Dan Haoqing. He had extremely good martial skills and talent, and he was Second Elder’s fellow disciple under the same master. However, after Second Elder had completed his studies, he had returned to the Ye Family to take up the position of Elder while Dan Haoqing had continued his cultivation.

A year ago, Second Elder had personally invited this Senior Brother to the Ye family to take up the position of Great Elder of the Ye Family.

“What about the Duan Family? Aren’t they just depending on the Long Family for support? If not for that, we have nothing to fear from the Duan Family,” another old man said gravely.

This old man was called Feng Qingyun. He was on good terms with Dan Haoqing and was also very powerful. When Second Elder had invited Dan Haoqing to join the Ye Family, he had also invited Feng Qingyun along. Now, he was the Third Elder of the Ye Family.

The two of them were very powerful. Even Second Elder, who used to have the best martial skill in the Ye Family, was no match for them.

“Just as Third Elder said, there was nothing to fear from the Duan Family in the past. However, the Duan Family of today has the support of the Long Family. From what I know, the Long Family has given the Duan Family much help. Even the Duan Family’s oldest son has broken through to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One with their help.” Second Elder was frowning deeply and looked uneasy.

Second Elder spent half his life immersed in martial skills and had gone through many hardships in his cultivation. But until today, he had only reached the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. However, the eldest son of the Duan Family was only in his early twenties and had already reached the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One!

One must know that a year ago, the Duan Family’s eldest son, Duan Tianyun, was merely a Connate Level Eight. Now, with the Long Family’s help, he had risen to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One within a year!

Except for the Long Family, in the entire Lin Town, few elders among the three greatest family clans were currently a match for Duan Tianyun, much less the younger generation.
