Chapter 1242: Luo Family (1)

One must know that the battle between the Central Mainland and the Second Domain was earth-shattering. Although it had happened thousands of years ago, it continued to be spoken of.

The winged man laughed and shook his head. “At that time, your uncle was not powerful enough and did not actually enter the main battlefield. I only participated in other battles.”

The winged youth seemed rather puzzled. However, he was clearly curious about this historical battle.

“Uncle, I heard that the battle was extremely intense and that Central Mainland suffered terrible losses.”

“That’s right.” The winged man nodded slightly. “If the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows had not led the senior members of the temple in an attempt to turn the tide, the battle might have been lost.”

“The Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows? Hasn’t she been missing for a long time?”

Before the winged man could answer, the current Master of the Luo Family, Luo Feng, slowly walked over. He immediately stopped talking and advanced.

“Master of the Luo Family.”

“Brother Lan, how have you been?” Luo Feng looked to be about middle-aged, but he was more than a hundred years old. Even so, he looked much younger than the winged man, who looked like he was in his twenties. So, it was not strange for Luo Feng to call him Brother Lan.

“I am sorry that I am unable to personally congratulate Old Master Luo on his birthday. I hope the Master of the Luo Family will convey my good wishes,” the winged man, who was called Lan Yu, said with a smile.

“You are too kind. The Luo Family and the Palace of Wings have always been on good terms. There is no need to stand on ceremony,” said Luo Feng with a smile.

Luo Feng chatted with Lan Yu for a while before he went to greet his other guests.

Numerous guests had come to congratulate Luo Qufeng at his birthday banquet, many of which were powerful and influential.

Lan Yu was just about to continue his previous conversation with his nephew when a petite little fellow with a huge wine gourd on its back dashed over.

This little fellow looked somewhat like a cat with a pair of large, furry ears. Its entire body was covered with fluffy hairs, and it wore an intricately-worked set of leather armor. It jumped about gaily, its large, fluffy tail swaying lazily behind it. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Lan Yu laughed when he saw this little fellow, who stood only as high as his knee, approach.

“Mi Qiu, the birthday banquet has not even officially started. Why are you already drunk?”

The furry little fellow swept a glance at Lan Yu and simply sat down, leaning on Lan Yu’s leg. Its large fluffy tail curled up and took down the huge wine gourd on its back. It held the gourd firmly with four small claws and used its sharp teeth to open the lid of the gourd. The fragrance of wine spread from the gourd. It held the gourd full of good wine and gulped it down.

“Burp… The Master doesn’t like what you’re saying. Since when has the Master been sober?” The small and adorable Mi Qiu actually spoke in the careless tones of a man.

Although Mi Qiu looked adorable and harmless, it was actually part of the Qiu Clan and was vicious by nature.

The Qiu Clan was actually an animal clan. Although they looked like animals, they acted like humans. No matter how adorable they looked, they were usually very aggressive.

Besides that, the Qiu Clan was known for their love of wine.

Which was why members of the Qiu Clan were often seen carrying large wine gourds on their backs.

The Qiu Clan was often in a half-drunken stupor.

But their capacity for liquor was shocking.
