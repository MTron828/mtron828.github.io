Chapter 1621: Mission Countdown (2)

Dark clouds gathered in the sky, and sand swept in along with the wind.

The armies were like a strong tide that slowly advanced into the fortress of the Supreme League Kingdom.

The galloping of horses and hurried footsteps caused tremors in the ground.

At the sight of the escalating frenzy at the horizon, the defending guards at the top of the fortress wall were shocked.

The bugle call rang suddenly, and a restless stir broke out inside the fortress.

The Supreme League Kingdom soldiers climbed to the city walls successively and were alarmed when they saw the boundless majestic troops.

“Those are... the allied forces.” Joseph and the other Kingdom Knights had an unpleasant look when they saw the massive troops before them.

“What’s happening? Have the allied forces launched a total offensive?”

In the previous battle, the allied forces mobilized 500,000 soldiers, which was already extremely frightening, but that did not hold a candle to the present situation. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“How many soldiers are there? One million? Two million? Or...”

The King and Ye Qingtang scaled the city walls as well, and the King narrowed his eyes as he looked at the densely-packed allied forces swarming in like a tide.

“Over sixty million or so.” Ye Qingtang gave an estimate after a glance.

“Six... sixty... million?!” The Kingdom Knights’ eyes popped wide open in disbelief when they heard this unbelievable figure.

Over sixty million. Were the allied forces insane?

This was a life and death struggle!

The Supreme League Kingdom only had about seven million soldiers in the prime of its military strength, and after all the battles it went through, it only had less than three million soldiers left.

Yet now, they were about to be attacked by almost all the kingdoms on this entire mainland.

Over sixty million people...

Even if each person contributed a small effort, they had enough soldiers to destroy the entire fortress.

A serious look emerged on the King’s face, and a grim air hung in the entire fortress as anxiety overwhelmed them.

Only Ye Qingtang had a calm and indifferent look. “Sixty million people. Is this all the armies of the other kingdoms?”

“It should be the majority of their forces,” said the King. Apart from the garrison troops, all the kingdoms probably dispatched many soldiers, and it seemed that they intended to have a decisive battle.

Ye Qingtang nodded thoughtfully.

She should be very close to completing her mission.

“Supreme League Kingdom, you openly violated the mainland convention and dispatched a Kingdom Protector to enter the battlefield without authorization. Today, you will pay a tragic price for your actions. Get your Kingdom Protector out here or else we will destroy your entire fortress immediately!” An armored male suddenly moved to the front of the troops and shouted loudly on his suave horse.

He was clearly several hundred meters away from the fortress, but his voice was sonorous like thunder that rumbled in their ears.

“That is the Glory Kingdom’s protector.” The Supreme League King recognized that male at once and narrowed his eyes.

Previously, the 500,000 soldiers of the allied forces that Ye Qingtang annihilated were dispatched by the Glory Kingdom.

As a Supreme League Kingdom protector, Ye Qingtang participated in the battle and wiped out 500,000 soldiers of the Glory Kingdom. She violated the mainland convention first, and it was reasonable for the Glory Kingdom protector to join this war now.

The pressure of sixty million soldiers was not a joking matter.

The other party was forcing Ye Qingtang to come out to face them; otherwise, the troops would launch an attack immediately.
