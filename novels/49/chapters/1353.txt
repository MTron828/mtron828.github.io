Chapter 1354 Su Qiao 2

“Your first mission is to become the ruler of the General’s residence. Everyone should pay respect to you.” The God of Nature released the first mission after Ye Qingtang absorbed all the information.

“…” Ye Qingtang felt speechless as she stared at the God of Nature. Was he joking?

“So… I’m Su Qiao now?” Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly.

The God of Nature nodded.

“After you enter a world in the constellation, you might replace a person here or become an outsider. Everything is decided by Nature.”

“…” Ye Qingtang looked at the God of Nature and did not say anything.

What Nature… Everything was based on his opinion…

Based on her understanding of the world, this should be a ‘kind’ place with intense spirit energy for her cultivation. The God of Nature must find it too easy for her here and therefore created some trouble for her.

Ye Qingtang felt more relieved as she would get nebula points after completing the mission, and the points could be exchanged for treasures.

“As long as everyone here pays respect to me and I’ll be the in-charge here?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow and took a glimpse at the God of Nature.

The God of Nature nodded.

A smile appeared by Ye Qingtang’s lips. She carried the little white tiger and walked towards the door. She raised her leg and kicked the door…

The locked door was kicked open with a loud bang. The few servants who were chatting outside were knocked down by the force as well.

“Su… Su Qiao?” The servants were shocked as they looked at Ye Qingtang, who walked out of the door. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

In their eyes, Ye Qingtang was Su Qiao now.

“How dare you call my name?” Ye Qingtang smiled. She raised her hand suddenly and slapped the servant who spoke with an invisible force.

The servant did not realize what had happened and was slapped by someone on the face. His entire body was thrown out by the force.

The rest of the servants were shocked by what they just witnessed. They did not see anyone or anything near the guy, and he just flew out by himself?

“She’s crazy… The Eldest Young Lady is crazy again… Master!”

They stared at Ye Qingtang, whose eyes appeared to be different today, and their bodies were full of cold sweat. They ran away immediately and thought that their Eldest Young Lady went crazy again.

Ye Qingtang did not stop them and let those servants run away in panic. She glanced at the servant who fainted on the ground and did not feel any guilt.

All of them were loyal to the General’s wife. Su Qiao was not respected in the family, and these servants disrespected her after taking the order from the General’s wife.

Though Ye Qingtang was only here to complete her mission, she wanted to help the owner fight back.

The God of Nature drifted behind Ye Qingtang. He felt slightly interested as he witnessed how simple and violent Ye Qingtang’s actions were.

“Let’s go. We shall see what’s fun in this world.” Ye Qingtang carried the little white tiger again and walked towards the yard of the general’s residence.

General Qiao was in the front hall. A gorgeous and elegant lady sat beside him as he frowned.

“Dear husband… Su Qiao is getting crazier now. She threw away all the food we sent to her. Others will treat the entire general’s residence as a joke if we continue to allow such behaviors from her.” The lady frowned slightly and said. Her voice was mixed with hatred.
