“Changge, you are my junior brother. Could it be that even you don’t believe me?” Ning Luo asked in surprise as he looked at Zhu Changge.

“Senior Brother Ning Luo… It is not that I don’t believe you, but… it is true that you sneaked into the Hall of Justice yesterday night to kill Fu Lingtian, and you even fled the sect afterward… The Sect Master is extremely infuriated right now and has sent hundreds of inner sect disciples out to bring you back to the sect. It is difficult for me to defy a sect order. Please do not resist and return to the sect with us to explain this matter clearly, Senior Brother Ning!”

Zhu Changge did not wish to attack Ning Luo, whose skills were way above his. Moreover, they were disciples of the same master.

However, sect orders could not be defied. If Ning Luo stubbornly resisted, he could only strike.

“Senior Brother Zhu, you don’t need to talk any more crap with him. With things as such, can’t you tell yet? This Ning Luo is the spy in Xuanling Sect that Fu Lingtian was talking about!” Qin Huan said sternly.

“That’s right!” Another inner sect disciple nodded. “Junior Brother Qin Huan did not say anything wrong. Fu Lingtian knows that Ning Luo is the spy, and Ning Luo was afraid that Fu Lingtian would divulge his identity. Thus, he took the risk to infiltrate the Hall of Justice and silenced Fu Lingtian while the wardens were not prepared. Afterward, he was afraid that things would be revealed, so he fled Xuanling Sect!”

The other inner sect disciples arrived at the same conclusion after thinking through it carefully.

“Ning Luo, either you return to the sect with us or don’t blame us for ignoring the sect ties and burying you here!” Qin Huan shouted, enraged.

At that moment, Ning Luo’s lips tugged up into an icy cold smile. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In his eyes, these few Xuanling Sect inner sect disciples were merely ants.

“You overestimated your capabilities.”

Immediately, Ning Luo raised a hand, and a frightening martial aura filled the air. The Xuanling Sect disciples, including Qin Huan and Zhu Changge, had astounded expressions and were in disbelief.

Under Ning Luo’s shocking martial oppression, the Xuanling Sect disciples broke out in cold sweat which fell like raindrops.

Some even had difficulties breathing, and their faces were flushed.

In at most a few breaths’ time, blood seeped out from the corners of their lips while their complexions were ghastly white.

“Martial Qi… Level Three… First Heaven!”

Zhu Changge’s heart raced wildly. Never had he expected Ning Luo to be hiding his cultivation realm and that his true skills had already entered Martial Qi Level Three!

Martial Qi Level Three was almost on par with the inner sect elders, and inner sect disciples like them simply would not be able to withstand the overbearing oppression of someone at Martial Qi Level Three!

Boom!

One of the disciples spat out a mouthful of blood, and no longer able to bear this frightening martial oppression, he was flung several hundred meters away.

Whiz!

Ye Qingtang was still on the horse but noticed an unknown shadow crashing towards here.

Another victim of natural and man-made calamities?

Ye Qingtang grabbed that shadow almost instinctively.

When Ye Qingtang returned to her senses, she realized that she was holding onto a person in her hands.

“Where did you fly here from?” Ye Qingtang was curious. She had already witnessed two such cases over the past few days, and it was good that she was agile this time and reacted swiftly.

“Ye… Ye Qingtang?!” The Xuanling Sect disciple who was lifted by Ye Qingtang had a surprised expression.

Fortunately, Ye Qingtang who appeared from nowhere caught him. Otherwise, he would definitely be severely injured.
