Chapter 852 How Did I Die

Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan meaningfully. The rumored Ling Yan would definitely not do anything he had no confidence in.

“I believe you led Yin Yang Child to where his enemy is, but I don’t believe it when you said that you did not steal the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book from Yin Yang Child’s father,” Ye Qingtang said.

Ling Yan smiled faintly and sized up Ye Qingtang. “That’s right. I have some conflicts with Yin Yang Child as well, and I’ve already stolen the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book before I came to this mainland.”

Ye Qingtang could not help but gasp. This man was truly too scary.

If Ling Yan was a friend, he could provide an endless sense of security, but if he was an enemy, the enemy’s outcome would probably be eternal damnation.

If Ling Yan was an enemy and not a friend, she would kill him regardless of the price she had

to pay.

“What is your name?” Ling Yan asked Ye Qingtang a moment later.

“Don’t you know how to figure things out? Do I still need to tell you such a small thing like my name?” Ye Qingtang said.

Ling Yan laughed upon hearing that. “Anything that can be figured out requires certain details. In this world, no one can produce things out of nothing. Since that’s the case, how would I know your name for no reason?”

“Ye Chen.” Ye Qingtang replied perfunctorily. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“It seems that you still have not treated me as a friend. Otherwise, you would not have told me your fake name.” Ling Yan shook his head.

“How do you know that it’s a fake name?” Ye Qingtang was a little curious.

“Ye Chen is clearly a male’s name, but you are a female.” Ling Yan answered.

“Ye Qingtang.” With no other way out, Ye Qingtang said her name straightforwardly.

“Miss Ye, it’s our first time meeting. I am Ling Yan, the third son of Eternal Dynasty’s Emperor,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, Ling Yan continued on. “Actually, I really wish to ask if you know how I died?”

Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed instantly when Ling Yan said that, and she looked at Ling Yan questioningly. “Ling Yan, what do you mean? I don’t understand.”

Ling Yan said casually. “Although it’s said that the karma of the latter half of my life has not formed… to play it safe, I wish to ask you, someone who is reborn, what exactly is my outcome?”

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought.

Ling Yan was not considered foreign to Ye Qingtang

Back then, Ling Yan destroyed the Central Dynasty by himself and ruled the entire First Domain. Sometime later, a war broke out between the First Domain and the Second Domain. Ling Yan, who was only at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm then, laid a calamity of definite death, and he wanted to destroy the Second Domain completely…

Nonetheless, some unforeseen events happened. More than half of the super figures died in Ling Yan’s scheme, but eventually, those unforeseen events caused Ling Yan’s scheme to fail. He disappeared, and it was unknown whether he was still alive or not.

However, many people in this world believed that Ling Yan died, and the war between the First Domain and the Second Domain came to an end.

Actually, Ye Qingtang admired Ling Yan greatly.

The martial culture and skills of the Second Domain were completely above those of the First Domain, but relying just on a Ling Yan, the entire Second Domain was almost extinguished.

It was to the point that the Second Domain eventually invited the Heaven Mysteries Old Man to resolve the calamity which Ling Yan laid. Otherwise, before the unforeseen events happened, the Second Domain would have already suffered defeat.
