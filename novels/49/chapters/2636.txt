Chapter 2637 Shocking Change (3)

“Ling Yan?!” Ye Qingtang asked in surprise as she stared at Han Cangming. She was all-too-familiar with Ling Yan. His every move, mannerism and tone were almost identical to the Ling Yan whom Ye Qingtang knew. At that moment, Ye Qingtang finally understood that the Karma Bloodline that flew out from her body was indeed Ling Yan’s.

Ye Qingtang was surprised. When did Ling Yan enter the Ancient God’s Karma Tunnel with her? Furthermore, what was Ling Yan doing now? Was he possessing the body of Demon God Han Cangming?!

Everything had completely surpassed Ye Qingtang’s understanding. There were two questions that Ye Qingtang could not understand.

Firstly, she had no idea how Ling Yan entered the Ancient God Karma Tunnel with her.

Moreover, Ye Qingtang was certain that Ling Yan had appeared several times in the Ancient God Karma Tunnel and the doomed hell. Each time he appeared, it was because she was in a daze. During that time, Ye Qingtang thought that it was just her hallucination.

But now, it seemed that it was no hallucination. Ling Yan had indeed appeared...

Secondly, even if Ling Yan entered the Ancient God Karma Tunnel with her, with Ling Yan’s ability, would he dare to possess the body of the Immortal Emperor Han Cangming? Was he courting death?!

Looking at the overall situation, the heavily injured and unconscious Heavenly Emperor who was now lying in the deep pit should be easier to possess, right? Even if Ling Yan had the terrifying ambition to possess an Immortal Emperor, why didn’t he choose the Heavenly Emperor but instead targeted the Demon God Han Cangming?! Ye Qingtang could not understand all of this. She had never expected such a thing to happen after coming to this era. She never expected Ling Yan to enter this distant era with her...

“Ling Yan, is that you...”

Ye Qingtang looked at Han Cangming with a frown.

An indescribable emotion surfaced in Han Cangming’s blood-colored left eye but he did not reply.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, her body was already pushed to Han Cangming’s side. In the next second, Han Cangming’s right hand grabbed Ye Qingtang’s throat. He stared at Ye Qingtang with a complicated expression. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I... will bring you away from this world... to avoid pain!” Han Cangming’s right eye regained its coldness and madness. As Han Cangming exerted force with his right hand, Ye Qingtang’s body was lifted off the ground. “She wants to kill him, I want to kill me... how laughable is that!” Han Cangming’s crazy voice sounded again.

However, before Han Cangming could continue, his left hand grabbed his neck.

“Yes, that’s it... let our bodies perish together. I can easily destroy your divine soul. You shouldn’t exist in this era, Future me!” Han Cangming laughed maniacally. “After my body is destroyed, I will destroy your soul and undergo rebirth to create a new body... Ye Qingtang, in the future... let me protect you!” Han Cangming continued to shout coldly.

“Heh... can you do it?

This time, it was Ling Yan’s voice.

Han Cangming’s body seemed to be out of control and he suddenly released Ye Qingtang’s hand. She immediately retreated into the distance to ensure her safety.
