Chapter 1786: Deity Ocean (3)

The blue light formed a protective screen around him and the attack from the two Great Generals did absolutely no damage to it.

All the attacks were absorbed by the blue screen.

“Haha... the Deity Ocean is really amazing. Don’t worry, once I’ve absorbed all the power, I’ll send you to hell immediately!” The Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General looked at the screen surrounding him as his eagerness in obtaining the Deity Ocean rose.

Just the light from the Deity Ocean was already giving him so much power. Once he absorbed all of its power, he would be their absolute king

The expressions of the Great Generals of the Earth Demon Tribe and the Earth Demon Tribe were extremely dark. Under the protection of the Deity Ocean, they couldn’t do anything to the Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General!

On the mountain peak, the demons from the Heavenly Demon Tribe all roared as they saw that their Great General was about to merge with the Deity Ocean.

The demons from the other tribes panicked as they saw this.

They were a step too late again!

But just as the Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General was about to absorb the Deity Ocean proudly, the Deity Ocean pressed against his chest emanated a powerful wave.

The Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General was pushed back by the wave. All of the strands of power he had absorbed from the Deity Ocean dissipated as well.

“What...” The Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General looked down at the Deity Ocean in his hands in disbelief.

He couldn’t absorb the power of the Deity Ocean?

He couldn’t believe it and tried again, but the rejection was even stronger this time and the Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General spat out a mouthful of blood. The protective screen around him vanished.

How could this be?

“The Deity Ocean doesn’t want to be used by you. Haha, don’t even dream of using its power!” The Great General laughed coldly as he hit the Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General on the shoulder. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Enraged, the Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General returned blows, swift and hard. Caught up in the scuffle, the Deity Ocean in his hand fell towards the mountain peak!

Seeing the Deity Ocean belong to no one again, the demons under the mountain peak all surged towards it frantically.

“Get that Deity Ocean back!” the Earth Demon Tribe Great General roared as he flew towards the Deity Ocean.

The Great General of the Heavenly Demon Tribe and Emperor Demon Tribe didn’t want to lose this opportunity as well and rushed towards the Deity Ocean.

Once again, the mountain fell into chaos as all the demons coveted the Deity Ocean. The battle which had stopped temporarily restarted even bloodier and crazier.

As the Deity Ocean fell towards the chaos, Hu jumped nimbly over the crowd of demons, grabbed the Deity Ocean from midair and quickly flew off.

“The Deity Ocean is with him! Catch him!” The Heavenly Demon Tribe roared loudly after having lost the Deity Ocean so painfully.

When the demons from the eastern camp saw that someone on their side had obtained the Deity Ocean, they fought every demon that wanted to get it to the death!

The Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General and other demons flung the resistance aside and chased right after them!

Ye Qingtang was hiding safely on the side of the mountain peak. Hearing someone cursing and hollering loudly, she peeked out and saw Hu flying towards her quickly with something in his arms...
