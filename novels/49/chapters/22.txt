Chapter 23: Pavilion of Treasures (2)

Ye Qingtang laid her eyes on one of the gems which was pinkish-white, roughly the size of the nail on a pinkie.

It was stunning to behold, with its white and translucent luster tinged with pink.

“A Flora Moonstone…” Ye Qingtang squinted slightly at its presence.

The Flora Moonstone is a precious gemstone which is saturated with nature’s aura. Wearing it as an accessory enhances the training efficiency for a cultivator. For the ladies, the Flora Moonstone is also revered for its effective anti-aging property.

While Ye Qingtang was admiring the moonstone, a few men of a lofty stature approached her side abruptly. One of them pounded on the counter.

“I didn’t expect to find a Flora Moonstone here.” Amongst the group, a dashing young man pointed out the moonstone.

Ye Qingtang raised her eyes from the counter as she heard the man’s voice. Her eyes flashed a chilling gaze when she recognized him.

“And I wasn’t expecting to see you here either, Miss Ye. Or should I address you as my Ex-sister-in-law?” The young man had also acknowledged her presence, though his greetings was full of scorn.

“Duan Tianrui.” Ye Qingtang looked impassively at the young man before her, who was obviously a belligerent.

Duan Tianrui was the third young master of the Duan household, and also Duan Tianrao’s younger brother. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was two days ago when Duan Tianrao called off their engagement. Everyone in the Duan household would have known that by now, thus Duan Tianrui was openly contemptuous of her.

“What? Have you taken a fancy to this moonstone as well?” Duan Tianrui sized her up from head to toe with a smirk on his face, “Not bad. A Flora Moonstone is truly a rare gem. You’ve good taste.”

Duan Tianrui paused for a moment before he resumed: “But, as a member of the Ye household, don’t you reckon, such a precious gem should only belong to someone befitting it?”

Ye Qingtang chuckled and asked: “Who’s that?”

Duan Tianrui smirked and stated as a matter of fact: “Funny you should ask. That will be my new sister-in-law of course. Miss Ye, I’m afraid you are still unaware. My elder bro will be renouncing your engagement during the Sabbath. Other than that, he will be introducing his new fiancé as well. This moonstone was chosen by her. You wouldn’t want to be a spoilsport now, would you?”

Others might not know who Duan Tianrui’s new sister-in-law was, but there was no way Ye Qingtang would be unaware.

Obviously, that would be Ye Xun.

Ye Qingtang was not really enthusiastic about this moonstone at first, but since it was something that Ye Xun wanted, she would be more than happy to be a hindrance.

“Is that so?” Ye Qingtang put on a faint smile, “But despite all that, I still like it.”

Duan Tianrui narrowed his eyes as a hint of displeasure, “Miss Ye, the moonstone is known for its anti-aging property, that is essential for a lady to retain her beauty. However, someone like you…. ”

With that said, Duan Tianrui glanced at the veil on Ye Qingtang’s face, “Its better not to let all that go to waste.”

Though he did not mention it explicitly, his words were a blatant discrimination against her hideous appearance.

Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows and retorted:” But I want this so badly.”

Duan Tianrui’s face clouded over, “Miss Ye, our families may be considered an alliance. You had neither a spirit root to cultivate, nor an appearance to maintain. To be fighting over an item which you clearly had no use for. Are you for real?”

Ye Qingtang wanted to laugh.

“Duan Tianrui, if you’re so determined to buy this for Ye Xun. Let’s compete with our own assets.”

Duan Tianrui sneered and waved over an assistant straight away.
