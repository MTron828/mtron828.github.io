Chapter 1679: Amazing (2)

The more the Jiang family elders thought about it, the more depressed they felt. They could not help but feel despondent.

At the moment, the Mu family Elder’s expression was extremely ugly. When he saw that Mu Ruxue had fled with such severe injuries, he hurriedly arranged for someone to look into it.

Before this fight, no one had paid any attention to Ye Qingtang. But after this fight, some people began to notice her.

“The Jiang family has been hiding this girl. They’ve managed to keep this secret quite well,” Qiu Heyang said smilingly.

Qiu Chen, who was nearby, gave a mocking look. “Is there any need to hide this kind of ability? She only beat Mu Ruxue, not like it’s a big deal. That Mu Ruxue was only at the mid-stage of the Third Heaven. Even if she won the match, it would be impossible to enter the top ten without reaching the Fourth Heaven.”

Qiu Heyang laughed softly. “I heard there was some conflict between Mu Ruxue and a few of the Jiang family members...”

“Who cares about their conflicts. Both the Jiang family and the Mu family are beneath us. Although Ye Qingtang beat Mu Ruxue, she has not yet entered the Fourth Heaven. In the Jiang family, only two people have ascended into the realm of the Fourth Heaven.” Qiu Chen had no interest in opponents who had not yet reached the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm.

His goal was to become one of the top ten in the Martial Arts Championship. The Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm could be said to be the most basic requirement for becoming one of the top ten in the Martial Arts Championship. Without attaining this realm, one need not even dream of achieving it.

Today’s victors would challenge the top ten from the past Martial Arts Championship tomorrow. All of them were outstanding, and although the outcome of Ye Qingtang’s match had surprised many, it did not create much of a stir among the many victors.

...

After winning the match, Ye Qingtang did not linger in the square. Instead, she immediately went with Jiang Yisheng and Jiang Shaobai to Jiang Yiran’s room.

At that moment, Jiang Yiran was partly conscious. Jiang Yanyun had brought him back and arranged for his treatment before returning to the square to prepare for his own match.

At the moment, only two youths who knew Jiang Yiran were sitting with him in his room.

Jiang Yiran bared his teeth in agony. He had numerous injuries all over and his handsome face had been reduced to a bloody pulp. One eye was injured and he could only open it partially. He was startled when his other eye saw Ye Qingtang and the others enter the room.

“Little girl, surely you didn’t enter the arena?” When Jiang Yiran saw Ye Qingtang, he immediately asked about his greatest concern.

Ye Qingtang was shocked to see Jiang Yiran’s numerous injuries. But when she saw that Jiang Yiran was still clear-headed, she secretly breathed a sigh of relief.

“Who says Qingtang didn’t enter the arena. Her match is over,” Jiang Yisheng said.

“What?” Jiang Yiran was shocked. He involuntarily tried to sit up, but the moment he moved, he groaned in agony.

“You stupid girl. I told you not to go and just admit defeat. Why didn’t you listen? Did that lunatic make things difficult for you?” Jiang Yiran gritted his teeth against the pain as he asked.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. She was about to reply when Jiang Yisheng cut in. “How can scum like Mu Ruxue make things difficult for Qingtang? She can just dream on. You didn’t see how Qingtang punched the daylights out of Mu Ruxue just now. Wow the feeling was great...”

From then, Jiang Yisheng proceeded to give an animated description of how Ye Qingtang had decimated Mu Ruxue. He could not help but exaggerate a little, painting a vivid portrait of Mu Ruxue’s fitting disgrace. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
