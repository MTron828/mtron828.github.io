Chapter 118: With All of One’s Fist (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The candidate who landed the punch was dumbfounded.

As he looked at the faint and almost invisible dent, his face which was full of confidence a moment ago turned a little stiff.

How could this be?!

The candidate widened his eyes as he looked at the dent, which was at most the thickness of a leaf, repair itself bit by bit. The whole slate returned to its initial state before his eyes as though he had not touched it at all before.

“This… this slate…”

“Next,” the middle-aged man directly ended the candidate’s assessment without giving him any time to struggle.

The stiff-faced candidate was instantly like a defeated rooster as he left dejectedly.

“It shouldn’t be? No matter how bad, a punch from a person with an orange spirit root should be able to break such a thin piece of stone. How can it be?” Discussions over the strangeness of the stone slate started amongst the candidates.

This seemingly simple third segment appeared to be completely different from what they thought.

Yun Shu’s eyes swept over that stone slate, and a bright light glistened in his eyes suddenly after thinking for a while.

“This is the Invasive Stone!”

The Invasive Stone was an extremely rare mineral. Although it looked like there was no difference from normal stones, this type of stone possessed ductility that normal ores did not. It was completely different from the other stones that could be broken easily and was, instead, extremely ductile. If one used only their strength to hit it, all the strength would be resolved by the Invasive Stone, and there would not be a single bit of damage on it.

The candidates, who thought it was merely an easily broken stone slate, felt dark clouds looming over them upon hearing “Invasive Stone”.

If one had no understanding of the fist intent for a long period of time, it would be difficult to punch a hole in this thing even if one were to punch it for ten days and night straight.

The group of people was about to cry.

It was all because they were too naive to see Xuanling Sect’s trap!

After knowing that it was the Invasive Stone, the subsequent candidates did not dare to use pure force to hit it.

However, they were all quite young, and even if they practiced martial arts from young, they still had a very limited understanding with regards to the fist intent. Moreover, Xuanling Sect was famous for its Sword Faction, and most of the candidates were talented in swordsmanship.

As for fist intent… they really did not know much.

Candidates went forward one after another. Most only managed to make a faint dent on the Invasive Stone like the first candidate, while others who were slightly better were able to make a dent as deep as half a finger.

Lu Xiuwen was relatively outstanding in this segment.

With a punch, he almost broke the Invasive Stone and even spread his strength, shattering dents all over. Streaks of tiny cracks appeared on the ever-ductile Invasive Stone for the first time! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The Fist Faction Elder saw the scene through the Water Moon Mirror, and praise could be seen in his eyes.

“This Lu Xiuwen may have come into contact with boxing before.”

“The Formidable Heavens Royals have always spent time on training martial arts,” Elder Lin said.

At the location of assessment, Lu Xiuwen was satisfied as he looked at the result of his punch and retreated to a side.

As this segment was the last assessment, all the candidates had not left and only retreated to a side. They would leave once all candidates finished their assessment.

Lu Xiuwen stood at aside with his eyes fixed on Yun Shu who went up after him.

After Yun Shu hit the Invasive Stone, a deep dent was formed, but not a single crack appeared. Lu Xiuwen saw this, and a proud expression finally appeared in his eyes.
