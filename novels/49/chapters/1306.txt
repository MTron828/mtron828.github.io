Chapter 1307: Giving Advice (3)

Lady Ghost paused, then continued. “If you can find suitable men to trap them into fighting, then you can turn the situation around and say that Ling Yan’s subordinates took advantage of their position to bully others. This will also implicate Ling Yan.”

“Ling Yan has only just been made Crown Prince, but his trusted subordinates have begun throwing their weight around and acting wickedly. If news of this reaches the Emperor’s ears, I’m afraid that the Emperor will doubt Ling Yan’s worth.” Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Lady Ghost’s speech allowed the Eldest Prince and the others to understand Ye Qingtang’s intentions.

When they had first received these dossiers, they had fretted over fabricating charges against Ling Yan. Who would have expected…

That Elder Ye could checkmate Ling Yan with a few simple words!

It did not matter whether Ling Yan or his subordinates had really done anything wrong.

“A single consultation with you is more profitable than ten years of study. Elder Ye, I greatly admire your wisdom.” The Eldest Prince made a slight obeisance to Ye Qingtang with heartfelt admiration.

But the Second Princess’s expression grew odd.

This Elder Ye’s intelligence was truly formidable. At the moment, she was a great help in dealing with Ling Yan. However, once Ling Yan was removed, her alliance with the Eldest Prince would dissolve. Then, this formidable person would be her enemy…

At that moment, the Second Princess’s emotions were in turmoil—she was both glad and worried.

As Ye Qingtang looked at the admiration on the faces of the Eldest Prince and the others, she felt no inward joy.

Ling Yan had allowed her to do her best to advise them…

If he could not avoid the trap… then it really was not her fault.

The Eldest Prince and the other two truly wanted to kill Ling Yan. The moment they understood Ye Qingtang’s plan, they began their preparations.

They clearly wished to get rid of Ling Yan before he consolidated his power.

They ordered men to ride swiftly through the night to the border cities. They also began to choose suitable men to deliberately provoke the loyal followers of Ling Yan that Ye Qingtang had highlighted.

Ye Qingtang intended to tell Ling Yan about all these plans, but there was no sound from the voice transmission stone. She did not know if Ling Yan had left it in his room.

Mo You was Ling Yan’s personal bodyguard and also Mo Yunxian’s cousin. He was fairly talented and an upright man.

Because he had grown up together with Mo Yunxian, the two of them were on good terms. Mo Yo doted on Mo Yunxian as if she were his own sister.

“Xian’er, bear with it. Injuries like yours will not heal so soon, so you should stay at home.” That day, Mo You had heard that Mo Yunxian had been injured by the Holy Son of the Temple of Shadows during the banquet in the palace and had hurried over.

However…

The moment he arrived, Mo Yunxian begged him to bring her to see Ling Yan.

“Cousin, did Elder Brother Yan really not give you a message for me?” Mo Yunxian had been severely injured by Ming Gu. If she had not been carrying her Master’s Dharma treasure, she would have died. Even so, Mo Yunxian’s thoughts were with Ling Yan after resting for a few days.

She had finally returned to the capital but had sustained such severe injuries. Ever since that night, Elder Brother Yan had not been to see her even once.

Mo You looked at his adored cousin, his emotions in turmoil.

For the past few days, Ling Yan had not mentioned Mo Yunxian at all. But when he looked at the misery and hope written on Mo Yunxian’s little face, Mo You could not bear to tell her the truth.

He was afraid that the truth would wound Mo Yunxian deeply.
