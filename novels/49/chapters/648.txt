Chapter 649: Crazy Loot of the Meteoric Iron

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Whether they could leave the Hell of Avicinaraka alive all depended on the Fiendcelestial Beast. That was the reason why the Blood Moon Elder was so concerned about it.

“F*ck, if she did not snatch three-quarters of the demonic energy, I would be able to last for at least ten to twelve hours… Now, maybe two hours.” The white tiger puffed.

“Yes yes yes, it’s all her fault. Dear Master Fiendcelestial Beast, don’t be angry.” The Blood Moon Elder smiled.

Ye Qingtang shot a look at the Blood Moon Elder. His sucking-up skills had reached the peak level.

“Master Fiendcelestial Beast, don’t be bothered by a young lady when we are all men…”

“All men…?” The white tiger sized up the Blood Moon Elder.

“…”

Before the Blood Moon Elder could say anything, Ye Qingtang went forward and kicked him. “What did you say just now?”

“Haha. Holy Lady, don’t be bothered by an animal…” the Blood Moon Elder said softly. He tapped his butt and went forward immediately.

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at him.

The Blood Moon Elder was really skilled. No wonder he could take up the position as a Blood Moon Elder. She really looked down on him previously.

Ye Qingtang did not bother to talk to the Blood Moon Elder. She looked up into the sky.

As more and more cultivators died, more blood was rushing towards the third level.

She stared at the staircase in mid-air and said, “We shall go to the third level to take a look.”

She disappeared from the place she was at in the next second.

Ye Qingtang was on the staircase and climbing upwards after a short while.

There were others from the super sects who wanted to climb up the staircase to reach the second or the third level previously. However, before they could take a few steps, they were attacked by the mutated flying beasts. They either fell off from the staircase or were torn into pieces.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder who were climbing on the staircase also were not able to avoid the attacks.

The ferocious flying beasts rushed towards the staircase from all directions.

Ye Qingtang curled her lips and showed a cold smile.

Though the number of these ferocious flying beasts was large, their abilities could only match with someone at the First Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Three, though some could reach the early stage of the Second Heaven.

However, Ye Qingtang’s martial ability had entered the peak stage of the Third Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Three, which was known as a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. How could she be afraid of the mutated ferocious flying beasts?

“How dare you, weak bustards!” Ye Qingtang shouted coldly as the numerous ferocious flying beasts rushing towards her. She flicked her palm, and rays of golden flames rose towards the sky.

Any flying beast who was in contact with the golden flame was burned into ashes. Even those whose abilities matched with people at early-stage of the Second Heaven of the Martial Qi Level Three standard did not dare to approach anymore. It seemed that the lady was a ferocious god from Hell.

Ye Qingtang hugged the white tiger and led the Blood Moon Elder on the staircase. It took them only a short while to arrive at the second level.

Ye Qingtang overlooked the entire landscape of the second level on the staircase.

The second level of the land of inheritance was formed by iron mountains.

“Millennium Meteoric Iron?!”

Ye Qingtang was shocked by the scene.

The Millennium Meteoric Iron was an extremely rare material. It was hard to find it on this land. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

When she was cultivating at the Falling Sky Valley in her previous life, her Master always told her that his biggest wish was to find five kilograms of meteorite iron to forge a black-level divine weapon!
