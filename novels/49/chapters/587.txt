“Oh?”

The Blood Moon Elder laughed coldly. “What you’re saying doesn’t seem to be false. However… from now on, I am the Young… Young…, whatever it’s called, of the Nine Nights Dynasty’s Ouyang clan and will completely replace you!”

Ouyang Qian was appalled as she retreated backward in a struggle. Nonetheless, her entire body was weak, and there was no way of resisting.

However, the Blood Moon Elder would not let Ouyang Qian escape either.

In just fifteen minutes, the Blood Moon Elder’s body collapsed on the ground while “Ouyang Qian” rose slowly. The horror on that stunning face had completely disappeared, and what replaced it was an evil smile.

“Holy Lady…” The “Ouyang Qian” who stood up smiled at Ye Qingtang immediately.

“Very good.” Ye Qingtang was extremely satisfied as she stared at the “unrivaled beauty” that was the Blood Moon Elder. This appearance was much more pleasing to the eye than Zhou Qu’s face.

The Blood Moon Elder waved his right arm immediately, and black smoke floated in his palms, turning Zhou Qu’s body to dust.

“It’s not bad. This body is indeed full of power…” The Blood Moon Elder flashed his teeth. Although he was initially resistant, he was relieved when he thought that he could still possess an even stronger male body in the future.

“Miss Ouyang!”

As the Blood Moon Elder was familiarizing with his new body, a male in white suddenly barged in.

This man in white was the Yuehua Sect disciple from that day who adored Ouyang Qian and even hated Ye Qingtang to the core because of that.

When the Yuehua Sect disciple saw a disheveled “Ouyang Qian” in a rather messy situation, his face changed immediately, and he looked at Ye Qingtang insidiously.

“What are you doing here?” “Ouyang Qian” said coldly and stared at the Yuehua Sect disciple.

“Miss Ouyang, I heard some strange noises here just now… I seemed to have heard your voice, and I was worried, so I came over to take a look…” As the Yuehua Sect disciple looked at Ouyang Qian, his manner softened immediately while his tone became gentler as well.

Ye Qingtang stood aside, calm and unruffled. A seeming laugh hung on her lips as she looked at that Yuehua Sect disciple.

She remembered that this Yuehua Sect disciple seemed to be interested in Ouyang Qian.

“Miss Ouyang, you don’t have to worry about anything with me here. If this person dares to bully you, I will definitely tear him into pieces!” The Yuehua Sect disciple declared coldly as he looked at “Ouyang Qian.”

“Ouyang Qian”‘s mouth twitched unconsciously. Glaring at the Yuehua Sect disciple with a frown, she shouted. “Get lost!”

The Yuehua Sect disciple was shocked and thought he heard wrong.

“Didn’t you hear that? As a sect disciple, you don’t even have the slightest ability to make discerning judgments, and you even dared to interrupt Miss Ouyang and me?” Ye Qingtang suddenly took a step forward and snickered coldly.

“You…!”

The Yuehua Sect disciple’s expression changed and darkened.

“You what you! Quickly get lost!” “Ouyang Qian” came forward immediately and kicked that Yuehua Sect disciple out. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Outside the tent, the Yuehua Sect disciple was sorrowful as he looked at the cold “Ouyang Qian.” “Qian… you promised me before that if I devote myself wholly to you…”

A shudder ran through the Blood Moon Elder’s body immediately.?To hell with “devoting myself wholly to you!”
