Chapter 2317: Their Best Hope (1)

Ye Qingtang shot Qin Feng a look, also indicating that he should stop.

She had let Qin Feng carry out his actions not because she wanted an apology from Qin Xuan but because she was well aware of how much Qin Feng had suffered under the bullying tactics of Qin Xuan.

Qin Feng had always been reserved and Ye Qingtang wanted him to have the opportunity to vent out all the suppressed pain and grievances he had suffered inside.

Finally he let go of Qin Xuan, who was already unconscious by that stage. As predicted, he had to be carried off the platform. Hang Wenwei and the others couldn’t resist sighing as they watched Qin Xuan being carried off the platform.

Qin Feng had been successful in his challenge against a highly-ranked opponent. In everyone’s eyes, Ye Qing’s students were the stars of today’s selection trials.

Just as the crowd felt that there had been enough excitement for today and those killing machines were finally ready to leave, they noticed that Qin Feng remained on the platform.

“Qin Feng? The match is over. You can come down now.” The teacher in charge of the matches called out.

But Qin Feng just walked to the center of the platform. “Student Qin Feng. I have not issued my challenge yet.”

“…”

The crowd was stunned.

They suddenly understood Qin Feng’s meaning.

Qin Xuan had ascended the platform himself and initiated the fight. Qin Feng had yet to announce his chosen opponent. Strictly speaking, Qin Feng had indeed not carried out his challenge.

But the lips of the teacher-in-charge twitched upon hearing his words.

He had already thrashed the number five student into such a wretched state. Who else did he wish to challenge?

Didn’t he know the meaning of “stopping while you were ahead”?!

It was clear that Qin Feng had no intention of stopping. Not only did he want to be selected for the Inter-Academy Competition, but he also wanted everyone to know that his Boss was the best teacher in the Netherworld Academy.

No one else could compare.

“Qin Feng, who do you wish to challenge?”

“The number one student, Ran Mo,” Qin Feng stated.

Everyone was thunderstruck by his words.

Ran Mo was the current top talent in the Netherworld Academy and possessed the highest potential. Qin Feng had created a furor when he first entered the Netherworld Academy, but Ran Mo’s appearance had completely shaken the entire Netherworld Academy to the core.

Ran Mo had just turned 15 this year but he was a rare martial arts prodigy. When he was first admitted into the Netherworld Academy, he was already at the Divine Lord First Heaven early stage and had become the Netherworld Academy President’s direct disciple. Now, he was already at the Second Heaven early stage, one level higher than Qin Feng.

Although Qin Feng was strong, Ran Mo was even stronger!

“Madness, madness. Qin Feng has really gone insane.” Gong Jinyun clutched his head. He felt that Ye Qing’s students were as wild as a pack of wolf pups.

Meanwhile, Hang Wenwei was smiling brightly.

“That’s good. There’s someone who wants to drag that Ran Mo down too. This will be an exciting match.”

The student ranked eighth looked at Hang Wenwei and felt that this fellow was rather wicked. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Everyone else felt that Qin Feng’s actions were too impetuous.

The teacher-in-charge asked a few more times to confirm that Qin Feng would not be changing his mind. He then sent someone to summon Ran Mo.

When Ran Mo arrived, he looked as if he had just woken up. He rubbed his eyes groggily. Young with a naturally boyish face, Ran Mo only looked like he was about 13 or 14 years old.

“Mmm? Someone wants to challenge me?” Ran Mo was still groggy from sleep.

Hang Wenwei was acquainted with Ran Mo and he went up to pat Ran Mo on the shoulder.

“Brother, the dignity of the top 10 all rests on you now.”

Ran Mo, “???”
