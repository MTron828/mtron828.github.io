Chapter 1274: Let Me Go Free (3)

The Eternal Dynasty was thousands of miles away from the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang sat in a gray bone sedan. She finally relaxed when she saw the Temple of Shadows disappear into the distance.

“Don’t rejoice too early. Don’t you see that Ming Wang has sent Lady Ghost with us? And those Branch Masters are no weaklings. If you’re not careful, you might expose yourself and die without even reaching the Eternal Dynasty.” The little white tiger poured cold water on Ye Qingtang when it saw the smile in her eyes.

Ye Qingtang’s good mood was immediately dampened.

Of course, she knew all that.

Every day she failed to escape was another day with the sword of the Temple of Shadows suspended over her head.

They could pick anyone from the Undead Clan, and they could kill her.

Ye Qingtang was very careful during the journey.

The Undead did not need to sleep, drink, or eat, so they seldom stopped to rest.

After traveling for a few days, they were more than halfway there. The group from the Temple of Shadows stopped and rested for a while.

“Ah Yao, shall we look around?” Ming Gu took the opportunity to sneak into Ye Qingtang’s sedan and asked her hopefully.

Ye Qingtang was unable to refuse when she looked at the puppy-like face.

She would also take the opportunity to stretch her limbs. Heaven knew her bones were shattered from squatting in that bone sedan all day.

The group from the Temple of Shadows had stopped at the foot of a tall mountain. Now and then, thunderous explosions could be heard from the top of the mountain, and debris also fell from it.

The Ghost Lady walked over and said smilingly, “Is the Holy Son Ming Gu and the Holy Lord going over there?”

Ming Gu said, “Ah Yao and I will look around, the rest of you can stay here and rest.”

Lady Ghost laughed and said, “I was just feeling bored. Why don’t I go with you?”

Ming Gu pouted and looked somewhat reluctant. However, Lady Ghost was Ming Wang’s trusted subordinate, so he did not dare to say anything. He only lifted his eyes to look pleadingly at Ye Qingtang.

Of course, Ye Qingtang knew why Lady Ghost wanted to follow them, but she did not mind, so she nodded.

Lady Ghost followed them smilingly.

It was nearing evening, and the mountain was littered with huge boulders.

The occasional explosions hurt their eardrums. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang, Lady Ghost, and Ming Gu walked for a while before they saw a few shabby figures on the desolate mountainside.

They looked emaciated and skinny. Their appearance was rather odd—their skin was gray without the slightest hint of color. They only wore some shabby clothes. Their eyes were hollow, and their legs were heavily shackled. They were barefoot and were pulling a cart of ore with some difficulty.

The Undead Clan…

With one glance, Ye Qingtang could tell that these drab-looking figures were part of the Undead Clan. However, these Undead were pitiable compared to the Undead Clan in the Temple of Shadows.

A harsh-looking foreman stood nearby. His back was bare, and he held a metal whip that he cracked from time to time, viciously whipping the Undead with a clear cracking noise.

“A bunch of lazy bones. If you don’t drag fifty carts of ore today, I will flay you.” The foreman shouted as he brutally whipped a skinny Undead.

The force of the metal whip was so great that the bones of the Undead seemed like they were about to break at any moment. The Undead’s face twisted in pain. It looked as if it was still quite young…
