Chapter 1862: The Crystal Palace (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Most of them had already earned enough spirit stones to last them through a day, and Ye Qingtang had already figured out how to win. But looking at how Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were doing, she felt she had to bring them to the Crystal Palace to collect themselves first.

Furthermore, they had just escaped from the cursed mystic realm and hadn’t had much time to rest yet. It was better to reconvene for now.

With that, Ye Qingtang led them all towards the Crystal Palace. Baili Xi and the others willingly allowed themselves to be led by Ye Qingtang.

The Crystal Palace was beautiful. Under the light, it sparkled and shimmered, reflecting the light that hit it.

But on closer inspection, even though the palace was made from something similar to crystal, they couldn’t see into the palace at all.

The palace was hemispherical like a huge pot lid stuck on the ground. And while it was called a palace, it looked too rough and crude to be one. But it was already heaven compared to the stumps all around them.

Walking over to the entrance of the Crystal Palace, Ye Qingtang raised her hand and knocked.

Silence.

The Crystal Palace was quiet, but Ye Qingtang waited patiently outside.

After a long while, the doors slowly opened.

As the door opened, a round stomach poked out from the inside!

“What a huge belly!” Jiang Shaobai blinked and looked at the huge, rounded belly in front of him. The Crystal Palace was at least two meters high but all they could see was a huge belly. They couldn’t even see a head.

“Who goes there?” A low voice rumbled from within the Crystal Palace as plumes of smoke floated out from the palace. It smelled extremely potent and with its sensitive sense of smell, Little White Tiger immediately started coughing.

“Are you Fu Qiu?” Ye Qingtang asked calmly. “Would it be alright if we stayed a night in your Crystal Palace?”

“You want to stay here?” Fu Qiu’s voice was impatient. How many of you are there?

“Four.” Ye Qingtang naturally excluded Little White Tiger.

“Five thousand spirit stones.” Fu Qiu threw out a number.

All of them froze as they heard the amount. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Five thousand?” But they said we would only need five hundred each...”

The Fu Qiu rubbed his belly impatiently from within the Crystal Palace, his face still hidden from them. “I set the price however I want. Get lost if you don’t have enough spirit stones.”

With that, Fu Qiu lifted his hands to shut the door.

It was the first time any of them were meeting a fat catfish with such a foul temper. It had neither shown them its face nor taken a good look at them before chasing them away.

Ye Qingtang hadn’t expected the fat catfish’s temper to be this bad. Not only that, the price was a far cry from what they had expected.

The extra thousands were nothing to Ye Qingtang since she could just gamble for it but... she wanted to let Mu Feiruo and the rest go in and rest first. Who knew what the fat catfishes would do to these people who only knew how to cultivate themselves.

“Wait! We’ll stay!” Ye Qingtang quickly said.

“Miss Ye!” Mu Feiruo and Baili Xi exclaimed.

Fu Qiu paused as it heard this. Without lowering its head, it reached out with its fat claws.

“Give me the spirit stones as payment first.”
