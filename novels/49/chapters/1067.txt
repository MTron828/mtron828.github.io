Chapter 1068 Falling Sky Valley (1)

Several Peerless School disciples returned to Falling Sky Valley again. Apart from demanding Falling Sky Valley to hand over Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple, Ye Chen, they also requested an increment in the offerings to Peerless School.

The Full Moon Peak Master, Xuanyuan Yi, told the Peerless School disciples with a smile. “That Ye Chen is indeed not in Falling Sky Valley right now…”

“Humph! We have already investigated it clearly. That fellow isn’t even from the ancient clan and has an unknown origin. Injuring a Peerless School disciple is a crime punishable by death. We don’t care where that fellow is right now. He is the disciple of your Falling Sky Valley Valley Master, and we will only ask Falling Sky Valley for him,” one of the Peerless School disciples said.

Upon hearing that, Full Moon Peak Master Xuanyuan Yi sized up Perfected Xuanchen and snickered. Ye Chen was Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple, and Perfected Xuanchen had to be the one who gave an explanation.

“What you all said is very true.” Xuanyuan Yi nodded and said. “However, that Ye Chen is Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple. Valley Master will definitely give Peerless School an explanation for this matter. Please rest assured.”

Everyone’s eyes landed on Perfected Xuanchen successively.

“Perfected Xuanchen, that Ye Chen is your disciple. You must hand over Ye Chen today, or you will bear the consequences yourself.”

The Peerless School warden looked at Perfected Xuanchen and scoffed.

Perfected Xuanchen frowned deeply upon hearing that. Ye Chen had left Falling Sky Valley for a long time and never appeared since then. While Perfected Xuanchen was unaware of Ye Chen’s location, he would definitely not tell anyone Ye Chen’s location even if he knew that Ye Chen was his disciple.

“To be honest, I don’t know where my disrespectful disciple is at either… Thus, I am afraid I cannot do anything to help. However, the issue of increasing Falling Sky Valley’s offerings to Peerless School can be considered,” Perfected Xuanchen looked at the Peerless School people and said.

“Increasing the offerings is a must. However, Ye Chen must be handed over as well. This is Peerless School’s orders and not a negotiation with your Falling Sky Valley!” A Peerless School warden shouted coldly.

Perfected Xuanchen was extremely helpless but could not do anything either.

At this instant, a Falling Sky Valley disciple came and greeted Perfected Xuanchen with cupped fists. “Valley Master…”

Full Moon Peak Master furrowed his brows and yelled furiously. “Insolent! Don’t you know how to look at the occasion!”

“Peak Master… It’s not…” The Falling Sky Valley disciple said hurriedly. “A powerful figure is here to pay Falling Sky Valley a visit!”

“Powerful figure?!”

Everyone was stunned to hear what this Falling Sky Valley disciple had said.

“What kind of powerful figure is it for you to rush in here without permission so insolently!” The Full Moon Peak Master questioned coldly.“It’s… It’s a Yang Lord!” The Falling Sky Valley disciple replied hastily.

Everyone was taken by surprise. A Yang Lord was visiting Falling Sky Valley?!

“Yang Lord?”

Even Perfected Xuanchen was filled with astonishment, much less Full Moon Peak Master.

“That’s right,” the Falling Sky Valley disciple said as he nodded repeatedly.

“The Yang Lord… is from Peerless School?” The Peerless School warden asked after some thinking

A Yang Lord in the Nine Nights Dynasty could only be from Peerless School.

“Uh… I don’t know about that.” The Falling Sky Valley disciple shook his head. It was the first time in his life seeing a Yang Lord; God knows if that Yang Lord was from Peerless School.
