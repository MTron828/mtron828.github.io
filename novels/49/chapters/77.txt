Chapter 78: A Little Dragonoid (1)

The shadow’s speed was far beyond a person’s reaction time.

The Great Elder was about to grab Ye Qingtang before the shadow crashed straight into him. A thunderous rumble exploded right in the Great Elder’s ears as the tremendous force from the head-on collision sent him flying head over heels!

However, it did not stop at that. Before the Great Elder could even hit the ground, the shadow had already caught up to him in midair, unleashing a flurry of blows onto him. Like a mayhem of fireworks, its lightning movements were dazzling.

Everyone was shocked by the spectacle before them, even Ye Ling and the Second Elder, who had rushed to aid Ye Qingtang, froze in their tracks.

Ye Qingtang was stunned as well. She watched the shadow that emerged from the egg, continue its thrashing on the Great Elder.

What is that?

Ye Qingtang was quite disturbed as she reflexively turned her attention towards the fallen egg, which were now, pieces of broken empty eggshells.

It’s empty… don’t tell me….

Ye Qingtang reverted her attention to the shadow, that happened to slow down its movements and it was during then could she finally make out what the shadow was.

It’s …. or in fact, he or she’s… a toddler…

The toddler looked, at most, two or three years old, with a rosy complexion. However, a pair of dark bluish horns protruded from the head, and from the buttocks… grew a tail covered in reptilian scales, swaying along with the toddler’s movements…

What….

The hell is that?!

Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded. The hatchling from the egg was supposed to be a lightning drake, but ‘the little dragonoid’ that emerged instead totally stupefied her. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Even in her past, she had never heard of a drake that could transform into a humanoid!

The chubby little fellow looked so adorable at first glance, its small rounded face and rosy cheeks seemed to be stuffed like a meat bun. However, its dark green eyes squinted dangerously, whilst its cuddly fists were pounding fractures into the Great Elder’s bones.

For the first time since her rebirth, Ye Qingtang began to wonder if she had overlooked some vital information in her past.

While she was still pondering over its nature, the Great Elder was nearly beaten to death.

The little fellow, whose height could not even reach the Great Elder’s thighs, was exceedingly brutal. Its strength was capable of pinning a grown man on the ground, whilst raining punches, each devastating enough to inflict jaw clenching pain. No one could imagine a grown man would be unable to hold up against a toddler’s strength!

Thus, even the Second Elder froze in his tracks at the sight of this ‘brutality’.

The Great Elder, lauded for his impenetrable resilience, was beaten senseless by now. He had struggled numerous times to break free, but once he lifted his head, he was knocked back into the ground by its punches, and the impacts resounded like a percussion instrument.

When all the Great Elder’s bones were seemingly fractured, ‘the little dragonoid’ suddenly jumped high into the air, and curling the tail that swayed behind, it lashed mercilessly, like a whip, onto the Great Elder’s head. The lashing impact came down on the Great Elder like a ton of bricks literally and he was knocked out cold in an instant.

“…..” Ye Qingtang was shocked beyond words.

Such monstrosity was unheard of!

After ensuring its victim was beaten to a pulp, the little fellow finally dusted off its hands, seemingly satisfied with its accomplishment. It turned around in a sudden, with its dark green eyes focused on Ye Qingtang, who was still standing dumbstruck at a side.
