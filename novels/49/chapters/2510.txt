If she did not know the Blood Moon Elder well enough, Ye Qingtang would have suspected that the Blood Moon Elder was a spy planted by someone beside her.

“Holy…”

The Blood Moon Elder crawled to his feet and looked at Ye Qingtang. He was about to say something when Ye Qingtang glared at him fiercely.

Seeming to have realized, the Blood Moon Elder’s mouth snapped shut again. He did not dare to say another word. It was probably because of him that the man had accurately found his position and attacked them.

Fortunately, the Holy Lady reacted quickly. Otherwise, they would have been killed by the man’s punch.

Right now, the man was surveying the surroundings impassively. Without sound to direct him, he could only sense that there were people nearby, but he could not detect their exact location.

The man glanced up at the sky.

Soon, an elder holding the golden book descended and stood beside the man.

“Great Lord!”

The old man holding the golden book knelt at the man’s feet. His expression was pious and reverent as if he was in the presence of his god.

“Divine Concealment Spell.”

After a long while, the man spoke in a hoarse voice.

Ye Qingtang was surprised. This man knew about the Divine Concealment Spell?

“Origins.”

The man looked down at the old man with the golden book as if he was looking at an ant.

“Great Lord, they should be from some academy. We don’t know their exact origins yet, we need to investigate further,” the golden book elder said respectfully.

The man fell into deep thought and looked towards where Ye Qingtang was standing.

Finally, the man’s lips curled into a devilish smile. If it was any other time, a man with such an appearance would be extremely good-looking with such a smile.

However, Ye Qingtang felt a chill run down her spine. It was as though there was an unparalleled aura that froze her in place and she could not escape. In the next second, the man looked away as though he had completely given up on killing Ye Qingtang and the rest.

The man’s gaze was extremely profound as he looked into the distance. His jet-black hair flowed with the wind, making him look like a peerless demon god standing between heaven and earth.

He uttered slowly in his hoarse voice. “I… am back.”

The man then slowly walked forward.

“Boom”!

“Boom”!

With every step the man took, the ground beneath his feet crumbled into nothing. The ground split open and spread in all directions like countless snakes.

Ye Qingtang could not help but gasp at this scene. Just one step was enough to cause the sky to collapse and the earth to crack. What kind of insane power was this!

Who could tell her what kind of monster she had inadvertently provoked?!

Ye Qingtang wanted to cry but no tears came. What could she even do? Could it be that she offended that man just because she resisted becoming his nourishment? The scariest thing was that this man had just woken up and was still in an extremely weak state. Yet, he was already so terrifying. If he was at his peak…

Ye Qingtang did not even dare to think about it.

...

The elders approached the man.

“Let’s go.” The man’s hoarse voice rang out.

Following this, the man casually threw a punch and shattered the void beside him with a loud bang. In the next second, the man stepped into the broken void.

The elders looked at each other before following the man and disappearing.
