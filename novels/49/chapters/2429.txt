Chapter 2430: Death (4)

“Bo… Boss…” Mu Ziying collapsed to the ground, tears streaming down her face.

“Imposs… impossible. Boss cannot possibly die…” Lei Yan shook his head in disbelief. No matter what, he could not accept what he had just witnessed.

Their Boss was omnipotent. How could he possibly be dead?

Qin Feng clenched his fists as blood dripped down from his palms.

“I don’t believe it!” Nangong Lie snapped out of his pain. He charged toward the huge black hole.

In the next second, Yun Chen, Qin Feng, Lei Yan, Mu Ziying and Jing Ze also flew over.

Like crazed people, they searched the black hole for traces of Ye Qing. It was as if they wouldn’t admit that Ye Qing had died.

Lu Yuanxiang stood by the side, watching the scene with a pained expression. Only someone who had personally encountered an above-Emperor level monster would understand just how terrifying its power was.

Ye Qing was very strong and could be considered an above-average practitioner among his peers. But… an above-Emperor-level monster. How could one defend against that?

In fact, Lu Yuanxiang found himself tearing up. He had realized too late that Ye Qing was a very promising youth. But now, this kind of talent had died in a team competition that had spiraled out of control.

Song Yanhan gaped. Looking at the crazed actions of Lei Yan and his group, his own eyes turned red. Without a word, he also went forward. As little hope as there was, he kept his thoughts to himself and helped Lei Yan’s group search for traces of Ye Qing.

It would be good even if all they could find was a corpse.

It would offer some closure.

Outside the Wailing Well, Wen Qi collapsed in his chair when he saw Ye Qing engulfed by the black shadows. His face was pale and he looked as if he had aged ten years in a second.

Ye Qing had died?

How could this be…

The other academy leaders also couldn’t help sighing. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

From what they saw earlier, this young Netherworld Academy teacher was the most clear-headed person inside. And he seemed to have discovered some clues. If he had more time… he might have been able to get closer to the truth.

A pity…

The crowd could see that Ye Qing was the backbone of the two Netherworld Academy teams. It was because of him that these two teams managed to escape countless dangers.

With Ye Qing’s death, his team was like a flock of sheep without their shepherd, completely immersed in intense sorrow. Meanwhile, Lu Yuanxiang was grievously injured and unable to hold the fort. Trapped in such a dangerous environment, the chances of survival for these two teams had become increasingly small…

“Vice-President…” A Netherworld Academy teacher standing beside Wen Qi tried to comfort him when he saw his pain.

Wen Qi felt like his chest had been ripped apart. He had allowed Ye Qing to join the Netherworld Academy and he had eagerly looked forward to the youth’s future progress. But now, this promising youth had died, just like that…

“Is there any news from President Wu?” Wen Qi gritted his teeth before asking.

…

Ye Qingtang had already been prepared to receive death, but she didn’t feel the expected pain.

The darkness before her eyes suddenly swirled and in the next second, a ray of light floated in front of her.

When Ye Qingtang opened her eyes, she was stunned by what she saw…
