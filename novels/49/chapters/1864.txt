Chapter 1865: Fu Qiu (2)

So it was thanks to that person’s intelligence that the Crystal Palace was built and existed until now.

Luckily, Ye Qingtang and the others weren’t forced to experience danger from the very first day they arrived in this mystic realm.

Aa Ye Qingtang spoke to Jiang Shaobai, Jiang Shaobai was already feeling a little sleepy. He wanted to stay over but Ye Qingtang chased him out without any hesitation.

On the other hand, Ye Qingtang wasn’t sleepy at all. They had arrived for one day but she hadn’t felt any danger yet. But since the fat catfishes were all extremely afraid of the day, she couldn’t help but feel curious.

Even Little White Tiger was already asleep but Ye Qingtang was still wide awake. She went up the stairs, standing on top of the Crystal Palace.

From her vantage point, she could see the gradually rising sun. The fat catfishes quickly gathered and went underground after having a whole night’s worth of fun.

No one stayed behind, the bustling activity from last night burst like a bubble.

“What are you doing?” A deep voice came from behind Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang turned around, seeing Fu Qiu right behind her.

“You’re not to come up during the day, stay underground if you don’t want to invite trouble for yourself.” Fu Qiu sounded displeased.

“What kind of scary monster appears in the day?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Keep your curiosity to yourself, if not, you can get out.” Fu Qiu was completely cold and unfeeling, as though she was an overly curious burden.

Since she was seeking shelter in its abode, Ye Qingtang naturally didn’t want to come into a conflict with Fu Qiu. She merely bowed respectfully before taking her leave.

Right when Ye Qingtang bowed, the jade pendant she wore around her neck fell out from her collar.

The moment the jade pendant slid out, Fu Qiu froze on the spot, as though it had been struck by lightning. Only after Ye Qingtang left did Fu Qiu slowly collect itself.

It turned around, taking big steps as it walked into the Crystal Palace.

Fu Qiu finally arrived at a massive chamber. Inside, an abundant number of Dharma artifacts and treasures were displayed. These treasures had all been exchanged from the humans who came into the mystic realm.

But somehow, the treasures that humans would fight so hard for was akin to trash here.

Fu Qiu didn’t even spare a glance at them and walked past it, coming to a corner of the chamber.

Hanging on the wall was an old portrait that was in a poor condition.

The portrait seemed to have been hung there for a very long time, its colors had faded but it was of a charming young girl. A delicate jade pendant hung right in front of the young girl’s chest.

If Ye Qingtang were to be there, she could see that the jade pendant the young girl wore was exactly the same as the one Ye Qingtang had. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Fu Qiu looked at the young girl in the portrait, all the astuteness and greed in his eyes dissipated and his eyes were filled with reminiscence.

“Jiu’er...”

Fu Qiu’s voice was miserable. It knew that Jiu’er would never be able to come back here. But...

Now it had actually met a young girl that resembled Jiu’er. The girl even wore the same jade pendant that Jiu’er used to wear.

“Who is she? Jiu’er... did you send her here to look for me?”
