Chapter 1616: Kingdom Protector (1)

The King frowned slightly, and his suspicions deepened when he saw that the ten thousand soldiers were perfectly fine.

“What happened? Did they not leave the fortress to fight the war?” The King asked in a deep voice.

The soldiers beside him were dumbfounded for a moment and replied immediately. “The allied forces were defeated, so they returned...”

Strange. They clearly won, yet why does His Majesty have such a weird expression?

But was there any way for the King to not have a strange expression?

They only sent 10,000 people to fight the war and even appointed Ye Qingtang, who had no experience, to lead the troops. No matter what angle this incident was perceived from, it was a hopeless situation given that the allied forces had 500,000 soldiers.

But a few soldiers came to report their victory.

Uh...

How could they have won?

How could they possibly have won?

“Tang.” the King called immediately when he noticed Ye Qingtang in the crowd.

Ye Qingtang took a step forward and bowed to the King. “Your Majesty.”

“You won?” The King asked.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Where are the allied forces?”

Ye Qingtang nodded to the soldiers guarding at the city gates, and those soldiers immediately understood and opened the city gates.

Seeing that the soldiers actually opened the fortress gates so easily during a war, the commander of the reinforcements had a serious expression and wanted to stop them, but it was already too late.

As the fortress gates opened slowly, the boundless plain entered everyone’s sight. There was no trace of the allied forces.

“The allied forces withdrew their troops?” The commander of the reinforcements asked in confusion.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “They’re right here.”

“What?” The commander was at a loss, and a look of dissatisfaction emerged in his eyes as he sized up the girl before him.

Where did this brat come from to cause trouble here?

Ye Qingtang smiled without saying anything.

Joseph and the other Kingdom Knights rushed down from the city wall and to the King, whom they kneeled to pay respects.

“Your Majesty, Tang... is saying the truth. The allied forces are right here.”

The King frowned slightly. There was not a single person outside the fortress. Where were the allied forces?

“Your Majesty, the 500,000 soldiers of the allied forces are burned into ashes and are blown... everywhere...” Joseph mustered his courage to report as he secretly took a look at Ye Qingtang when he spoke.

He prayed that Tang could forgive their past ignorance.

As calm as the King was, he could not help but widen his eyes at this moment.

Then, Joseph and the rest vividly reported to the King the entire process about how Ye Qingtang killed 500,000 soldiers of the allied forces in a second by herself.

The King’s expression changed drastically, and he looked at Ye Qingtang in astonishment in great contrast to his past half-hearted attitude.

The commander of the reinforcements felt his eyes almost popping out.

A single person annihilated 500,000 soldiers?

Including the Glorious Lion Knights’ trump card and numerous black witches?

What kind of joke is this?!

The King and the others did not dare to believe it easily, but they had incredibly amusing expressions when they saw the “ashes” of the allied forces, which the soldiers brought back.

500,000 soldiers were really burned into a pile of ashes by Tang herself?! Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Currently, the commander of the reinforcements no longer looked down on Ye Qingtang. He swallowed his saliva secretly as he looked at the petite girl and mumbled.

“Your Majesty... Could it be that she is the Kingdom Protector we have been waiting for years?”
