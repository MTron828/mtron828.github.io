Chapter 2295: A Gamble (2)

If it were other students, there might be a small possibility. But what kind of students were under Ye Qing?

They were all problem students from the bottom pile of the various faculties. If not for Ye Qing’s appearance, the academy would have already kicked them out a month ago.

Those people had been in the Netherworld Academy for several years but showed no progress at all. It was near impossible for them to have improved in two months.

With a piece of trash like Ye Qing, and those equally useless students, what sort of results could they hope to achieve?

Ye Qing replied, “Teacher Di Nuo, is it you that has the final say here?”

Di Nuo’s face stiffened before he spoke directly to the Vice-President. “Vice-President, I am not trying to make things especially difficult for Ye Qing. I am just looking out for the interest of the Netherworld Academy. If Ye Qing is that capable and was able to improve the skills of Lei Yan and the others, even if it was by just a single Heaven level, I will acknowledge that he has the right to be a teacher here. I wonder what the Vice-President thinks regarding this?”

Wen Qi had always held Ye Qing in high regard, but it was true that Ye Qing had indeed flouted the academy rules this time.

And now…

Wen Qi felt that Ye Qing was taking too big of a gamble.

As the Vice-President, he naturally knew what Lei Yan and the other students were like. Even if a proper Netherworld Academy teacher spent half a year on those kids, it was impossible to raise any one of their cultivation levels.

And there was Qin Feng, who was the most problematic of them all…

Wen Qi glanced at Ye Qing with regret. He knew this would be a complete setback for Ye Qing.

“Someone who is able to improve the cultivation level of a student in just over two months, such a person would definitely have the right to become an official Netherworld Academy teacher, and to lead students out for external training.”

“Ye Qing, did you hear that?” Di Nuo sneered at Ye Qing.

Ye Qing nodded again.

In fact, she was just waiting for Wen Qi to say that!

“In that case, I will have someone summon Lei Yan and the rest…” Di Nuo spoke up. He wanted to get rid of Ye Qing as soon as possible. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But Ye Qing suddenly cut in. “No need to be so anxious.”

“What? Ye Qing, are you regretting it now?” Di Nuo narrowed his eyes.

Ye Qing ignored Di Nuo but only looked at Wen Qi. “Vice-President, is the selection for the Inter-Academy Competition about to begin?”

Wen Qi was taken aback. He had no idea why Ye Qing was suddenly talking about the Inter-Academy Competition.

“It will begin in three days.”

Ye Qing nodded before slowly turning to Di Nuo.

“Teacher Di Nuo, you feel that I have no right to bring them out for training, so why don’t we have a bet?”

Di Nuo’s brows furrowed slightly.

“Ye Qing, what are you trying to do now?”

Ye Qing continued, “There are still three days until the selection of candidates for the Inter-Academy Competition. Since you want to see if they have improved, wouldn’t it be best to test them in real battles? It would be a more realistic test.

“So let me make a bet with you. My six students will all represent the Netherworld Academy in the Inter-Academy Competition. How about that?”

“What?!”

Everyone was dumbstruck by Ye Qing’s audacity. Even Luo Sheng, who had remained silent the entire time, was utterly shocked.

All of her six students would be able to represent the Netherworld Academy in the Inter-Academy Competition?

Had Ye Qing gone mad?

Did he know what he was saying?!

All of those who represented the Netherworld Academy in the competition were elite students at the very top of the rankings.

No teacher in the Netherworld Academy would dare to claim that they could produce not only one, but six representatives!
