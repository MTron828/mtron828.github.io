Chapter 1548 The Situation Changes 1

But everyone quickly understood.

They wondered how Ye Qingtang, with her abilities, had managed to get out of the forbidden place alive. But now that they heard Jiang Yu’s words, everything seemed to make sense.

The Domain Monarch Founder was so powerful. He must have met Ye Qingtang by chance in the forbidden land. After learning that Ye Qingtang was a member of the Jiang Family, he had brought her out.

So it seemed that Ye Qingtang had been fortunate enough to meet the Domain Monarch Founder.

With Jiang Yu as a witness, no one dared to accuse Ye Qingtang of anything.

Everyone naturally wanted to celebrate the return of the Domain Monarch Founder. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Jiang Lang and his wife, who had been deeply worried, finally relaxed now that their daughter had returned safely and had even forged some kind of connection with the Domain Monarch Founder.

Jiang Yu ordered Ye Qingtang to rest while he familiarized himself with the Jiang Family’s current situation.

Ye Qingtang’s luck had changed. With Jiang Yu behind her, her life in the Jiang Family would be much better.

Some were glad while others were worried. Ye Qingtang had found safety, but Ye You’s side was in turmoil.

Ye You was panicking, but she forced herself to remain calm. When she returned to her room, her expression was extremely ugly. Ye Xun, who had been waiting for good news, was puzzled when she saw this.

In the end, Ye Xun learned from Ye You that not only had Ye Qingtang survived, but she had even returned with the Jiang Family’s Domain Monarch Founder. In addition, Jiang Qin had a run-in with the Domain Monarch Founder, and had been punished and thrown into the Cliff of Reflection. Ye Xun’s face turned completely white.

Jiang Qin was Ye You’s greatest source of support in the Jiang Family. Now that Jiang Qin was imprisoned in the Cliff of Reflection, Ye You’s standing in the Jiang Family would probably...

“Elder Sister You’er, now that Aunt Qin has been shut into the Cliff of Reflection, we...” Ye Xun could not help but panic. She enjoyed a comfortable life in the Jiang Family because of Ye You, who had relied on Jiang Qin.

Ye You looked grim but remained silent. She clenched her fists, which were placed before her on the table. A malicious look flashed across her eyes.

She did not expect Ye Qingtang to turn the situation around...

“Leave the residence immediately.” Ye You raised her head and looked at Ye Xun.

Ye Xun looked bewildered.

“Leave the residence?”

“Uncle returned to his clan to deal with some matters. Now that Aunt Qin has been imprisoned, only Uncle can help. You must immediately leave for the Tuoba house and tell Uncle what happened to Aunt Qin.” Ye You’s eyes flashed.

Jiang Qin’s husband, Tuoba Yao, came from a powerful clan, and the couple got along well. Jiang Qin would not have fallen so low if Tuoba Yao had been present.

When Ye Xun heard Ye You’s words, she immediately grasped what Ye You meant.

Ye You was a child of the Jiang Family, but no one cared for her. The Jiang Family had so many descendants, so who would pay any attention to her?

Ye You’s only hope of retaining her place within the Jiang Family was to save Jiang Qin.

Ye Xun hurriedly packed her belongings and hastily left the residence in search of Tuoba Yao.

Meanwhile, the Inner Sect Elder and the Domain Monarch were discussing the Jiang Family’s current situation with the Domain Monarch Founder. The two of them held high positions in the Jiang Family, but they treated Jiang Yu with great respect.

When Jiang Yu heard about the Jiang Family’s current situation and that the Ancient You Clan seemed to be on the rise, he looked grim but did not say anything.

“The great Martial Arts Championship will occur in half a year. All the major clans will send the best of their younger generation to fight. Did you finish making preparations?” Jiang Yu had been shut away for ten thousand years, but he had learned from the Domain Monarch that some rules in Central Mainland had remained the same.
