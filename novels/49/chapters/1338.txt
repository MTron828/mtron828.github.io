1339 Flood 2

Numerous black shadows gradually arrived from the sky afar. There were eight enormous demonic beasts that were armed with golden mail and reigned by golden chains. Each demonic beast pulled a golden carriage of which had the engraving of an ancient totem.

Nearly a hundred people who were mounted on vultures surrounded the golden carriages, creating a huge bravado. Looking at the sight, no one could tell their numbers.

Wu Hu was shocked to see the totem on the golden carriage.

“That is… Ancient You Clan?”

What was going on? Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Everyone in the Central Mainland knew about the Ancient You Clan.

In the entire Central Mainland, there were barely any forces who dared to offend the Ancient You Clan. The Eternal Dynasty had always been extremely respectful toward the Ancient You Clan and never offended it, but…

Why did the Ancient You Clan people suddenly come today?

Ling Yan looked up slightly, and a trace of a smile emerged in his eyes as he looked at the golden carriages that were pulled by the eight demonic beasts.

“Ling Yan, today is your day of ascension to the throne. The Ancient You Clan is specially here to congratulate you.” A deep and distant voice suddenly rang from a golden carriage.

“Today’s flood is the Ancient You Clan’s congratulatory gift to you.”

Wu Hu was astonished.

This flood was actually the Ancient You Clan’s doing?

How could this be?!

They had never incurred the hatred of the Ancient You Clan though?!

“How does it feel to watch your own Imperial City being submerged in a flood? When you boldly poisoned the water that the Ancient You Clan drank from back then, you should have expected this outcome.”

Ling Yan, however, smiled faintly and cupped his fists courteously. “Then I really have to thank the Ancient You Clan for bringing this flood to engulf the entire Imperial City.”

“Ling Yan, are you still able to pretend to be calm at this point in time?” The person in the gold carriage snickered.

“Pretend?” Ling Yan chuckled. “I’m afraid you are mistaken. I am thanking you from the bottom of my heart.”

Ling Yan paused for a while and continued.

“I just ascended to the throne not long ago, and there are many people who have not submitted to me. It’s inconvenient for me to deal with them, but unexpectedly, you all helped me to get rid of them completely.”

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang and the rest initially intended to return to the Temple of Shadows. After all, Ye Qingtang had to eliminate Ming Wang’s suspicions of her as soon as possible since she wanted to use the Temple of Shadows to her advantage.

But before Ye Qingtang left, she saw the rippling waves engulfing the entire Imperial City.

At this instant, Ye Qingtang, Ming Wang, and the rest were floating in the air as they watched the waves beneath them.

The waves rushed in like a torrent and emitted a faint corrosive smell.

“What is this?” Lady Ghost was overwhelmed with confusion as she looked at the outpour of waves underneath her feet.

“Torrential Wave of the Ocean.” Ming Wang took a look, and his expression turned cold. “It’s a technique of the Ancient You Clan.”

“Ancient You Clan?” Lady Ghost was surprised. Why did the Ancient You Clan suddenly execute such a technique out of nowhere? Moreover, it seemed to be directed at the Eternal Dynasty.

Ming Wang did not say anything and merely looked up. Then, an illusionary gray butterfly flapped its wings in the air and landed on Ming Wang’s fingertips.

That was a Ming Butterfly that Ming Wang formed using the aura of death, which could be used to find out the nearby situation.

Aside, Ye Qingtang’s heart skipped a beat when she heard Ming Wang.

Ancient You Clan…
