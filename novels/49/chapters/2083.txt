Chapter 2084: Instant Kill (3)

With their appearance, Ye Qingtang was saved. Were they sent by the Crimson League?

Lu Zhiyao and Shui Mou instantly exchanged glances.

They acted at the same time. Two powerful beams of light struck in the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix’s direction.

Right before it struck the two figures riding on the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix’s back, a middle-aged man in his 40s looked over.

With a wave of an arm, the two beams of light just vanished into nothing...

Lu Zhiyao and Shui Mou’s faces darkened.

“What a hindrance,” the man said. He looked at Lu Zhiyao and Shui Mou with displeasure, as though they were merely ashes that had landed on his sleeves.

The next moment, he lifted his arm and a glimmering beam of golden light came out from his palm.

It shot towards Lu Zhiyao and Shui Mou.

Within seconds, the light penetrated through Lu Zhiyao and Shui Mou. They didn’t even have a chance to retaliate and were burned into ashes in an instant.

Even then the light didn’t disappear. After shooting Lu Zhiyao and Shui Mou, it landed on the Heavenly Wolf Sect and Ancient You Clan’s army.

Shining on them all.

Every living creature that was shone by the light started turning into ashes.

Everyone was stupefied.

The Crimson League and members of the Central Mainland looked at the burnt piece of land I’m disbelief. Just a while ago, the Heavenly Wolf Sect and Ancient You Clan’s army stood there.

But now...

All that was left behind was ashes...

“What... What kind of insanity is this...” An ancient clan elder was almost breathless.

There were hundreds of thousands of living creatures and this man just made one move to burn all of them into ashes?!

That made everyone’s hair stand on end.

If the light just slightly shone over, wouldn’t they also die?

Thump!

Mi went down on his knees and bowed his head respectfully at the two figures riding on the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix, in front of everyone.

“We welcome the Supremacy.”

The entire Crimson League went down on their knees and bowed. The others from the Central Mainland didn’t know who they were, but after witnessing their prowess, they knelt too.

Ye Qingtang was completely taken aback.

She was only certain that they didn’t belong to the Crimson League. Judging from Mi’s attitude, they certainly were much more powerful than the Crimson League.

Ye Qingtang was still guessing their identities when the holy light started forcing her towards the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Elder, that’s her.” It was the young man that challenged her that day. He pointed Ye Qingtang out to the elder after he saw her.

The middle-aged man’s gaze riveted on Ye Qingtang’s face. Once he saw her face, he couldn’t help but furrow his brows, seemingly trying to recall something.

“May I know–” Ye Qingtang hadn’t finished speaking.

The holy light that surrounded her suddenly became gold chains that held her captive.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

What on earth was going on?
