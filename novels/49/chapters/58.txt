Chapter 59: Retaliation (2)

Ye Qingtang swept her eyes over the Great Elder and stated with a sneer: “I’m the heir to the Head of the Household. I believe you’re not in the position to dictate how I address others.”

The Great Elder’s face turned grim in an instant. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Tang Tang…. Please don’t misunderstand. We’re just helping father to deal with the traitor in our household.” Ye Xun tried her best at putting on a kind and sympathetic look.

Ye Qingtang regarded Ye Xun’s obnoxious front with disdain: “Ye Xun, I’m surprised you’ve yet to understand your own place. Allow me to enlighten you. Who’re you to address the Head of the Household as father? Furthermore, our household affairs have nothing to do with you.”

“….” Ye Qingtang’s words were like daggers that pierced deeply into Ye Xun’s esteem, exposing her duplicitous nature as even with her prudent temperament, she failed to maintain her sweet fa?ade.

“Qingtang, you’ve gone overboard with your remarks. Xun-er grew up in your household. So naturally, she’d want the best for your family. You’ve misconstrued her gesture of goodwill.” Duan Tianrao spoke up for Ye Xun once he came to his senses.

“For your information, she didn’t ‘grow up’ in our household, but was raised out of pity, as merely an adopted orphan. Should you feel we’ve mistreated her in any sense, feel free to bring her home. We don’t require her goodwill.” Ye Qingtang disregarded all courtesy when she addressed Duan Tianrao.

Even without her disgust for the man, Ye Qingtang hated him down to the marrow of her bones, just from the fact that he had raised a hand against her father.

Her mocking but critical rebukes had rendered Duan Tianrao and Ye Xun speechless, totally damaging their esteem, including those Elders from the Duan Household whose faces had turned sour.

“What goes on here is solely the internal affairs of our Ye Household. Members of the Duan Household, should you have no further business with us, please leave our premises now.” Ye Qingtang spared no reservations in chasing her unwanted guests away.

With her blatant condemnation of their presence, no one in the right mind would wish to remain around. Moreover, since the Second Elder was already wounded, the Great Elder should not face any more difficulties in dealing with him. Thus, leaving immediately would be the best course of action to prevent further complications.

“Great Elder, we’ll take our leave then.” One of the Elders represented the Duan Household in bidding their valediction.

The Great Elder nodded at the gesture, though his expression remained grim. He did not object to them leaving as he too had anticipated that he could deal with the Second Elder by himself, given the current conditions.

While the other members of the Duan household made a quick exit, Duan Tianrao feasted his eyes on Ye Qingtang’s pretty face again, before voicing his concern: “Qingtang, regardless of what you think, all we’ve done today was for your family’s best interest. Your Second Elder’s treason should not go unpunished or he would remain a plague on your family’s life.”

Ye Qingtang ignored him completely, without giving him a single glance and Duan Tianrao could only turn around and walk away.

When they were finally gone, Ye Qingtang then approached the Second Elder, while breaking into a smile: “Welcome back.”

After watching his niece’s daring feats to overturn the situation, the Second Elder was pleased and relieved to see her character matured beyond his expectations.

But the Great Elder who stood at a side warned: “The Second Elder had plotted an assassination on us. His crime’s too grave to be pardoned and he should be executed in accordance to our rules.”

Ye Qingtang turned to face the Great Elder and asked: “Is there any evidence?”

“Evidence?” The Great Elder sneered: “With our demise, he’ll be the sole beneficiary. Is there a need for further evidence?”

Ye Qingtang snickered and stated matter-of-factly: “That’s just speculation and not evidence. Yesterday night when those assassins intruded my father’s quarters, I happened to be around and crossed swords with them. Though their prowess was certainly beyond my capabilities, I managed to catch a glimpse of the word ‘Qin’ embroidered under the collar of their sleeves. If memory serves, would that be the insignia belonging to that infamous assassins’ guild in our city, the Qin Luo Pavilion?”
