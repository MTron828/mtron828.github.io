Chapter 1960: Ye You (2)

The sorrowful expression on Jiang Lang’s face matched the broken feeling in Jiang Xun’s heart broke as she held down the grief that threatened to swallow her whole.

“Holy Lord, what about Ye You and Jiang Qin...”

Jiang Xun’s mind wandered over to them as she thought of Ye You and Jiang Qin. At this point, she wanted nothing more than to kill them!

Ye Qingtang said, “They’ve already joined the Ancient You Clan and definitely know more than we do.”

Jiang Xun nodded.

“But don’t worry, Holy Lord. They are no longer part of the Jiang family. The Holy Lord can do with them as she sees fit.”

Giving a slight nod, Ye Qingtang left without saying anything more. She arranged for someone to welcome the Jiang family and the rest and walked alone towards the prison of the Temple of Shadows.

Cold light shone faintly through the darkness of the prison as the shadows shifted under the flickering light.

Before even stepping into the prison, Ye Qingtang heard the pained wails of a woman.

Ye Qingtang found the voice extremely familiar.

It was Jiang Qin.

Continuing to proceed forward, she walked down into the prison and saw Lady Ghost standing with a whip in her hand. Her beautiful face was splattered with droplets of blood, which made for a morbid, yet ethereal sight.

A pathetic figure was strung up and hung in the air by her shoulder blades as fresh blood pooled at her feet.

“Holy Lord.” Lady Ghost bowed as she saw Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang looked at Jiang Qin being hung in the air, her skin and flesh torn as streams of blood dripped onto the ground.

There was no sympathy in her eyes.

“What have you found out?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“She doesn’t know much, more or less the same as what we have already investigated. But...” Lady Ghost paused before continuing, “she knows some forces which have already joined the side of the Ancient You Clan. One of them is the Sacred Ground of Reflection...”

The Sacred Ground of Reflection?

To be honest, Ye Qingtang had almost forgotten about them already. Lady Ghost’s questioning was messy and she was going to report back to Ye Qingtang after gathering everything. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. Just as she was about to walk away, a cry of plea rang out.

“Holy Lord, I was forced. everything was Jiang Qin’s idea!” Another familiar female voice rang out from the side of the prison.

Turning around slowly, Ye Qingtang saw Ye You chained in a metal cage.

Ye You was nothing like her previous beautiful self now. The once-proud woman had now been reduced to a prisoner covered in scars. It was obvious that Lady Ghost had not spared her at all.

Ye You’s eye flashed as she saw the “Holy Lord of Shadows” approach her in a golden mask.

“Holy Lord,” Ye You said in a clear voice as she stood up, shifting the chains behind her.

Ye Qingtang looked at the pathetic Ye You with a cold expression.

“Holy Lord, you won’t be able to get any clues from Jiang Qin even if you punish her so cruelly. She may have joined the Ancient You Clan but had no ability to truly work with them. She knows nothing,” Ye You said.

“Oh really?” Ye Qingtang said as she raised an eyebrow slightly and looked at the proud Ye You.

“So who does?” she asked, her expression unchanging.

Ye You smiled slightly and answered, “Me.”

“You?” Ye Qingtang said as she looked at her.

“That’s right. I’m the one who has been contacting the Ancient You Clan all this time and I was the one who helped them attack the Jiang family. Even the plan to lure the Domain Monarch out this time was planned entirely by me.” Ye You confessed smugly without holding anything back.

Lady Ghost’s brows furrowed slightly.
