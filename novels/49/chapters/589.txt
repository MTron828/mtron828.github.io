Ye Qingtang stared at Lin Cong and scoffed coldly. “Fellow, you don’t have the qualifications to compete with me.”

“What did you say…” A fierce glint flickered in Lin Cong’s eyes, and it seemed as though he would behead Ye Qingtang any time.

“I said that it’s you who don’t have any abilities. How could Miss Ouyang fancy such trash like you?” Ye Qingtang said indifferently.

Lin Cong’s heart boiled with fury, and he clenched his teeth. “Bullshit! You have used that Illusion Stone to bewitch Miss Ouyang! You’re just a Martial Qi Level Two piece of trash. Today, I want you to die an ignominious death!”

“Oh… You can come and try.” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up slightly and formed into a sinister smile.

Lin Cong was even more enraged after seeing Ye Qingtang’s attitude. He was a dignified Yuehua Sect disciple and was at Martial Qi Level Three, yet a Martial Qi Level Two piece of trash dared to be so arrogant to him!

However, before Lin Cong could make a move, a beautiful lady in a white dress slowly arrived.

A few males from the Ouyang family clan followed behind the girl.

“Qian!”

Lin Cong’s expression changed, and he immediately called Ouyang Qian after seeing her.

After hearing this loving call, the Blood Moon Elder who possessed Ouyang Qian’s body felt feelings of disgust rile up within him. He frowned and said coldly, “Who allowed you to call me that way?”

“Qian, are you really under the influence of this bastard’s Illusion Stone!” Lin Cong gritted his teeth in indignation. “A few days ago, you clearly told me that… you have some feelings for me too… But why… yesterday…”

“I already said that you don’t have the abilities, but you don’t believe me.” With a smile, Ye Qingtang walked to the Blood Moon Elder and held onto the Blood Moon Elder’s waist with a casual stance.

The Blood Moon Elder froze immediately.

Without giving Lin Cong any time to react, Ye Qingtang caressed “Ouyang Qian”‘s delicate face and said gently with a smile, “Qian, do you think that I’m much more powerful than that piece of trash, Lin Cong?”

The Blood Moon Elder shuddered. Although he knew that his Holy Lady was a female, Ye Qingtang’s disguise skills were really good. No matter how he looked, he could only see a delicately-handsome young man. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

If it were other girls, their hearts would have long been melted should they be treated like this by such a beautiful boy.

However…

All he wanted now was to die!

Obviously, Lin Cong could not guess “Ouyang Qian”‘s feeling right now and could only watch the intimate action between Ye Qingtang and “Ouyang Qian.” Grief and indignation filled him, but he could only contain the fury in his heart and look at “Ouyang Qian” pressingly.

“Qian, this cannot be true!!”

“Hmph!” “Ouyang Qian” scoffed coldly. “I’m Ouyang clan’s Young… Young… Young Miss! How would I take a liking to a piece of trash like you… The person I like… like is naturally this handsome… Young Sir in front of me.”

The Blood Moon Elder was aggrieved. What sin had he committed exactly…

At that instant, the males from Ouyang clan exchanged a look and were slightly surprised.?It can’t be that Young Miss is really interested in that pretty boy, can it? This does not seem to be consistent with Young Miss’s personality…

“No! You must have been deceived by his Illusion Stone!” Lin Cong immediately looked at Ye Qingtang. “I want you to die!”

Then, Lin Cong’s body moved instantly and charged towards Ye Qingtang rapidly.

Noticing the situation, Ouyang Qian immediately waved at the Ouyang clan people. “Beat him to death!”
