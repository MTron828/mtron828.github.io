Witnessing Ye Qingtang’s reckless act, the elderly shook his head in disappointment and walked aside. When the other blacksmiths saw the elderly, they clearly had reverent expressions in their eyes but did not reveal it on their faces as they continued to focus on their work on hand.

Ye Qingtang watched the Demonic Blood Sword burn red and focused all her attention on it. Once a yellow glimmer emerged in the sea of red, she immediately removed the Demonic Blood Sword and placed it on the anvil.

Grasping the correct timing, she immediately gripped the few Spirit Crystals that she had prepared earlier and embedded them into the burning red Demonic Blood Sword!

Those Spirit Crystals were carefully selected by her as the spirit energy in them completely aligned with the properties of the Demonic Blood Sword.

The elderly from not far away cast a cold look and frowned immediately.

After he identified that the materials that Ye Qingtang was embedding into the sword were Spirit Crystals, his frown could not help but deepen.

“Ridiculous”

Spirit Crystals were of little value, and the sword she had was considered pretty good. Yet, this girl had no idea of the gravity and casually embedded something in it, which would probably ruin the air of that sword.

“What a waste of that good sword” The elderly shook his head.

At that instant, the incharge of the Sword Spirit Workshop noticed the elderly’s presence and hurried over. He frantically bowed in respect but was stopped by the elderly, who lifted a hand slightly.

The incharge heaved a sigh of relief secretly. Following the elderly’s eyes, he spotted Ye Qingtang and could not help but frown after noticing what she was doing.

“Wouldn’t embedding Spirit Crystals into a sword damage the sword itself? This disciple is too reckless,” said the incharge.

“That girl appears to be pretty young. She is going to ruin a good sword. Go tell her to stop,” uttered the elderly with a frown.

The incharge nodded slightly and walked towards Ye Qingtang.

However, Ye Qingtang happened to have finished embedding, and she threw the scarlet sword into the water to cold.

Sizzles could be heard instantly.

Mist gently filled the air.

The elderly shook his head silently at that sight.

The sword was done forging, and it was already too late to stop her. There was no way of saving it now.

The incharge was rather speechless as well.

But when Ye Qingtang took the Demonic Blood Sword out of the water, there was actually a red glimmer that wrapped around the sword body!

“What’s going on?” The elderly was slightly taken aback, and the expression in his eyes changed when he saw the floating red glimmer on the blade.

If that sword was only considered ‘not bad’ before, then now… it could completely be worthy of the ‘divine weapon’ title!

The incharge was stunned as well. He had never seen such a situation after years of forging.

Their gazes were frozen instantly, but Ye Qingtang did not realize their stares at all. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

As she looked at the completely new Demonic Blood Sword, a smile broke out on her tiny, sweat-beaded face.

Success!

She did not have a spirit root in her previous life and had difficulties in improving her cultivation. Thus, she spent a lot of effort and energy on other aspects. Regardless of whether it was refining pills or forging items, as long as it could increase her combat power, she would invest a lot of energy to learn and practice them.

She spent near a hundred years on forging in her previous life.

Not mentioning about anything else, just based on her current forging skills, she was already better than quite a number of renowned blacksmiths.

Thirty thousand Xuanming points?

If not for the fact that she did not have a place to forge her weapon, she could not even be bothered to pay that one thousand Xuanming points.
