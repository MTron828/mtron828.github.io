At that moment, Ye Qingtang tilted her head and pondered. What method could she use to keep the big yellow dog by her side? This dog was a great protective talisman!

“I’m done eating. I’m going out for a walk to digest my food and find a convenient spot to…”

With that, the big yellow dog ran out of the house.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Previously, Ye Qingtang was still wondering if this dog was some great god who made use of some mystical transformation technique to become a dog. But it looked like it was definitely not… it was really a dog.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. Why were her skills not even comparable to a dog now? Was there still justice in this world? After all, she had lived two lives and was still inferior to a dog…

...

After midnight, Ye Qingtang slowly opened her eyes.

The power of the Deity Ocean was nearly replenished. Soon enough she would be able to bring everyone out of her Deity Ocean and return to the Wailing Well.

However, before this, Ye Qingtang still wanted to understand something.

Ignoring the big yellow dog who was sleeping soundly nearby, Ye Qingtang stood up and walked towards the door.

About half an hour later, Ye Qingtang arrived at the main hall. The Yongle Tribe General had not yet retired for the night and was cultivating in the main hall. He opened his eyes when he heard the sound.

“Greetings, Ancestor Qing!”

Seeing that it was Ye Qingtang, the Yongle Tribe General hurriedly stood up and cupped his fists at Ye Qingtang.

“At ease. Have a seat,” Ye Qingtang said.

“I wouldn’t dare.” The Yongle Tribe General had no intention of sitting down.

“Zang, what is your divine ability?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Revival of the dead.” The Yongle Tribe General replied.

“What do you mean?” Ye Qingtang asked again.

During the day, the Yongle Tribe General had said that every Demon General had different divine powers so it was normal that Ye Qingtang did not know every single one of them. This was not something that she could not ask.

“Ancestors, in simple terms, I can bring the dead back to life,” the Yongle Tribe General explained. “I can transfer dead souls into new vessels.”

“Oh?”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered when she heard what the Yongle Tribe General said. This Yongle Tribe General actually had such a heaven-defying ability to revive the dead?

“However, there are a lot of restrictions. It requires the soul of the deceased. If the soul cannot be retained right at the moment of death, I cannot do anything. Even if there is a soul, if the soul is stronger than my own, I am also helpless,” the Yongle Tribe General added.

Ye Qingtang held back her emotions and said expressionlessly, “Hmm, a very good ability. Can you demonstrate it once for me?”

“Demonstrate?” The Yongle Tribe General was taken aback. He did not understand what Ye Qingtang meant.

“Ancestor… Do you mean demonstrate like what Ancestor Feng did today? I don’t think I can demonstrate this skill of mine…” The Yongle Tribe General looked troubled.

He had to have a soul if he wanted to perform a demonstration. Without a soul, how could he demonstrate it? He could not possibly kill a demon just for a demonstration.

“Ha, I had the clone of a powerful human previously but the clone had an independent soul. After this clone died, I kept his soul. I need to ask him some questions. Can you help me?” Ye Qingtang stared at the Yongle Tribe General and smiled.

“A clone…” The Yongle Tribe General looked confused. “What do you mean, Ancestor Qing?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The corner of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. She almost forgot that clones were also a kind of divine power.. How would this Yongle Tribe General know what clones were? He probably had never even heard of them in his life.
