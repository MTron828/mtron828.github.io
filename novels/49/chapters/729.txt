Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If Feng Moli of the Xuanling Sect could be called as the tyrant, Qian Ze would be the devil in the Falling Sky Valley.

When Ye Qingtang just entered the Falling Sky Valley in her previous life, she suffered under Qian Ze. She always wanted to make a detour whenever she saw Qian Ze. However, the Senior Brother who always bullied her in the past was the one who stood up for her and shielded her against everything.

“Ye Chen, this is Qian Ze, Senior Brother Qian. This is Ji Yixuan, Senior Brother Ji.” Ye Chen introduced expressionlessly.

“Senior Brother Qian, Senior Brother Ji,” Ye Qingtang said.

The two of them nodded. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Senior Brothers, if you do not have other matters, I’ll show Junior Brother around.”

“Go ahead, I need to take a nap.” Qian Ze yawned and waved his hand.

Yan Shu then led Ye Qingtang out.

Ji Yixuan was about to leave with Qian Ze after they left. Qian Ze stared at Ye Qingtang’s figure and smiled. “Senior Brother Ji, I heard something interesting on my way here just now, and that is related to our new Junior Brother. Are you interested?”

“No interest.” Ji Yixuan did not care about that at all.

Qian Ze murmured to himself. “Our Master has not taken in any disciple for a long time. I heard from a disciple who followed Warden Xiong that the reason why Junior Brother Ye could be apprenticed was not due to her talent but… she invited Master Du to forge a sword for Master with the Millennium Meteoric Iron.”

Ji Yixuan was slightly stunned. As Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple, how could they not know their Master’s preferences?

“I think Junior Brother Ye only possesses a yellow spirit root. This is interesting. If the information leaks to other peaks, there will be much more trouble,” Qian Ze said enthusiastically.

Ji Yixuan frowned. Ever since Perfected Xuanchen took over the position as the Valley Master, the situations in the peaks were more complicated. If that was true…

Qian Ze was not interested to say anything else. He yawned and wandered back to his room.

…

On the other hand, Yan Shu led Ye Qingtang around in the Falling Sky Valley.

The Falling Sky Valley was huge. It would take more than a day to go to every corner.

“Normal peak disciples will cultivate in their respective peaks. If they have some missions that require them to go out…” Yan Shu said expressionlessly. Though he mentioned everything, his tone was warm, and his face was serious.

Ye Qingtang was not bothered by that. She just listened quietly to Yan Shu explaining everything about the Falling Sky Valley.

Ye Qingtang’s knowledge towards the Falling Sky Valley was scarcer than Yan Shu. Ye Qingtang was familiar with everything she saw on the way.

When Yan Shu was about to lead her to the Martial Cultivation Hall, he suddenly heard quarreling sounds. Yan Shu stopped and looked towards the direction of the sound.

There was a group of Falling Sky Valley disciples gathered not far away. Unpleasant quarreling sounds could be heard faintly in the crowd.

“Senior Brother Yan, what’s going on?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Let’s take a look first.” Yan Shu frowned slightly.

The two of them then walked towards the origin of the sounds.

There was a skinny pale young man standing in the crowd of disciples.
