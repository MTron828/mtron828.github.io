Chapter 2101: Floating Island (1)

Elder Hua brought Ye Qingtang out of the palace and flew up to the sky.

Ye Qingtang looked at Elder Hua, not sure where she was taking her. Even though the space they were in was vast, she mentally calculated the difference in their powers and gave up on escaping.

She wouldn’t even be able to get a meter away before Elder Hua caught her.

As they flew into the sky and into the clouds, a floating island appeared suddenly in her sight. It was a floating island high in the sky, hidden in the clouds. No one would be able to find it without flying past the clouds.

The mysterious Temple of Paragon was only becoming more and more impressive in her eyes.

“We’re here,” Elder Hua said as she landed on the floating island.

This island wasn’t big, but it was beautiful, with great mountains and clear waters.

Ye Qingtang didn’t make a move after landing. She wanted to see why Elder Hua had brought her here.

“Elder Hua~” A voice suddenly came from their side.

Elder Hua’s mouth rose into a slight smile. In the next second, many small figures were running towards her.

They were a bunch of... extremely cheerful kids.

When she looked around, she saw that everyone on the island was extremely young. The oldest was not even over 10 years old.

And there were many alien race children.

“Elder Hua, you’re here to see us?” A little winged child with pure white wings looked wide-eyed in reverence at Elder Hua.

Elder Hua smiled gently and patted his head.

“Have you been slacking off these few days?”

“We didn’t, we didn’t,” the little winged child shook his head hard as the other alien race children shook their heads as well.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes softened as she gazed at the children. There was no way she could keep her guard up against them. She couldn’t help but think of Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue.

“Elder Hua, who is she?” An alien race child looked curiously at Ye Qingtang.

Elder Hua smiled and said, “Someone extremely important to me.”

The little children all gave an expression of understanding.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little. She was merely an innocent bystander. How was she Elder Hua’s important person? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Could she not spout nonsense?

The little kids surrounded Elder Hua warmly for a while before gradually leaving to train.

Elder Hua saw the curiosity in her eyes and said, “These kids may become members of the Temple of Paragon one day.”

Ye Qingtang instantly understood everything.

These were kids recruited by the Temple of Paragon from the Second Domain. They were young but must have outstanding talent.

After all, the Temple of Paragon only recruited the strong, and so they would pay great attention to the talents of these young children.

“They will stay on this floating island until they come of age. When they are of age, if they pass the examination, they will be able to join the Temple of Paragon. If they fail, we wipe their memory and send them back to where they came from,” Elder Hua said lightly.

There were hundreds to thousands of similar floating islands outside of the Temple of Paragon.
