Chapter 2311: Come Up For A Beating (3)

Whatever Hang Wenwei and Gong Jinyun experienced happened once again. The number eight student was defeated and the crowd sank into a stupefied daze.

Who was he?

Where did he come from?!

Once might be an accident. Twice a coincidence. But what did three and four times mean? 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

All of a sudden, four Divine Lord level students were standing beside Ye Qing. Only Yun Chen from the medicine faculty and Qin Feng were left. As the medicine faculty’s selection trials would only begin tomorrow, Yun Chen didn’t need to go on stage today.

At this point, everyone was looking at Qin Feng.

After experiencing wave after wave of shock, no one dared to try and predict Qin Feng’s powers now.

Just as Qin Feng was about to ascend the platform, Ye Qing suddenly called out to him. “There’s something I have been meaning to give to you. Now is the perfect time.” Ye Qingtang smiled before taking out a sharp sword from her space ring.

The moment the sword emerged, a look of disbelief spread across Qin Feng’s calm face.

Qin Feng had seen this sword countless times in the Qin family’s weaponry records. This was a divine weapon that was the Qin family’s legacy heirloom…

It had once belonged to that elite practitioner in the Qin family. It was that practitioner’s companion as he brought the Qin family to their peak.

The Sword of Destruction was the companion sword to the Sword of Destruction Deity Qin Zhuo. Since Qin Zhuo had gone missing, the Sword of Destruction had also disappeared.

Over the years, the Qin family had invested much effort but failed to find it.

Qin Feng thought that he would never get the chance to see the Sword of Destruction in person. But now, this divine weapon had appeared before him.

“Boss?” Qin Feng looked at Ye Qing in amazement.

“This belongs to the Qin family. Some time ago, someone asked me to pass this to the descendants of the Qin family. Now, I am returning this sword to its rightful owner.”

With that, Ye Qingtang placed the Sword of Destruction in Qin Feng’s hands.

Qin Feng looked at the Sword of Destruction with a very agitated expression. He seemed to want to say something to Ye Qing but his teacher shook his head at him.

“I will tell you everything after the selection trials.”

Qin Feng nodded solemnly.

On the high stage, Qin Xuan was standing beside Gu Wei. The previous few matches had far surpassed Qin Xuan’s expectations, but the only person who he truly cared about was Qin Feng. That was why his eyes never left Qin Feng.

When he saw Ye Qing place a sword in Qin Feng’s hands, a crack finally appeared on Qin Xuan’s calm facade. His eyes widened as he instinctively took a step forward, trying to see if the sword in Qin Feng’s hands was what he thought it was.

“Qin Xuan.” Gu Wei suddenly spoke up.

Qin Xuan snapped out of his trance.

“Master…” Qin Xuan realized he had overstepped. Qin Feng was just a challenger and he had not yet announced who he wanted to challenge. There was no need for him to react in any way.

Any kind of reaction now would cramp his style.

“Who do you think Qin Feng will challenge?” Gu Wei asked.

Qin Xuan replied without even the need to think. “Brother Feng will probably challenge me.”

Gu Wei remained silent.

Qin Xuan hesitated before continuing. “Brother Feng has always been jealous of me because you took me under your wing. Brother Feng’s powers have deteriorated and his temperament has also changed as a result. But since we are both from the same family clan, I don’t wish to make Brother Feng look bad. Master, should I go down and try to dissuade him?”
