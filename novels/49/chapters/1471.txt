1472 Land of Infinite Demons 1

Ye Qingtang gained three public apologies from Ye You at least.

However, Jiang Yiming was crippled.

Mo Yi was a senior after all, and Jiang Yiming provoked Ye Qingtang first; thus, being beaten up was reasonable.

Jiang Qin and the rest thought that they would definitely be at the advantage when the Domain Monarch came out from seclusion, but eventually, they were at a great disadvantage.

However, at this instant, no one dared to say anything and could only disperse.

“Since you’re back, stay for some time then. Don’t cause any more trouble,” the Domain Monarch said before leaving. Although he spoke with a dignified tone, there were a few hints of fatherly care.

Jiang Lang nodded silently.

Seeing that everyone left, Jiang Xun followed Jiang Lang and his family back to the room.

Mo Yi’s injuries were not light, and it was extremely strenuous for her to hold up until now. Jiang Lang’s eyes turned red and were filled with worry when he saw it.

“Yi…”

Mo Yi shook her head at Jiang Lang. “I’m fine. You haven’t seen our daughter properly yet.”

Jiang Lang started a massacre the moment he returned and really had not seen his long-lost daughter. He could not help but smile now that he saw Ye Qingtang. Furthermore, when he returned, he saw how Ye Qingtang protected Mo Yi and liked her even more.

“Back then, we said that if we had a boy, we father and son would protect you. Now that our daughter has grown up, she can also protect her mother.”

Mo Yi chuckled as she wiped off the traces of blood on her husband’s face.

Jiang Lang sighed. “I returned late and let both of you suffer such great injustice. If I had returned earlier, I would definitely have dug out Ye You’s spirit root before father comes out from seclusion.”

A sinister look flashed across Jiang Lang’s eyes. Although the Domain Monarch stood up, Jiang Lang would not forget this score.

Sooner or later, he would demand back whatever people owed his daughter.

“Calm down already. Your father has already stated his position today as he doesn’t want you all to continue fighting on. Even if you really have any thoughts, you have to find a suitable opportunity,” Jiang Xun said leisurely. She was very clear of the way that the Domain Monarch handled matters.

He took an impartial approach without being biased to either party. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Don’t worry about my matters already. I will personally take this revenge in the future.” Ye Qingtang liked these “parents” greatly as she felt the kinship that she had not felt in a long time.

After the first mainland was devoured by Little You Yun, her foster father and Masters disappeared as well, and she seemed to have parted from familial warmth for a long time.

Jiang Lang looked at Ye Qingtang with smiles in his eyes before looking at Jiang Xun. “Aunt, why are you back today?”

Jiang Xun opened a wine gourd hung on her waist and replied after taking a mouthful of wine. “The Ancient You Clan has been up to quite some things recently. Furthermore, isn’t that day coming soon? That’s why I’m back.”

That day?

Ye Qingtang was confused, but Jiang Lang seemed to have thought about something.

“It’s time to go to the Land of Infinite Demons?” Jiang Lang asked.

Jiang Xun nodded lightly.

Land of Infinite Demons?

Ye Qingtang was taken aback when she heard the four words.

The Land of Infinite Demons was a forbidden area in the Central Mainland and was exceptionally dangerous.

It was rumored that the Land of Infinite Demons was the cemetery of various great demons where they gathered before they died.

There was an unfathomable number of great demons buried in the Land of Infinite Demons, and their names would strike terror amongst people. Before those great demons died, they would be able to sense that their life was coming to an end and would head to the Land of Infinite Demons before they died. Furthermore, they would do all they could to plunder precious treasures to be buried with them.

Over the accumulation of millions of years, the amount of treasure inside was unimaginable.
