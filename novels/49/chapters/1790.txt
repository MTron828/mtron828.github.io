Chapter 1791: It Is All A Misunderstanding (5)

“Do you think that I will let you go just because you refuse to tell me?” The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General snorted. He was the first fiendish demon to obtain the Deity Ocean, and was also the first fiendish demon to have tried merging with the Deity Ocean. As a result, he was exceptionally attuned to the scent of the Deity Ocean.

Otherwise, he would not have detected the presence of the Deity Ocean despite Hu’s tricks.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General scanned Ye Qingtang with sharp eyes. His gaze was so sharp that it was like he wanted to slice off her flesh inch by inch.

“Do you think you can deceive me by hiding the Deity Ocean in your own body? Ha... do you think I won’t be able to find the Deity Ocean after I peel off your skin and carve out your flesh?”

“...” Ye Qingtang felt very maligned. When did she hide the Deity Ocean in her own body? Could this Great General of the Heavenly Demon Race not make such false accusations?

“How did the Great General know I hid the Deity Ocean inside of me? If I hid the Deity Ocean in the space within the chasm earlier, you will never find the Deity Ocean if you kill me.” Ye Qingtang continued to put on a brave front.

“Ha, you are still trying to deceive me...” The Great General narrowed his eyes and suddenly reached out toward Ye Qingtang.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General was very fast and Ye Qingtang didn’t have time to react.

But just as this was happening, Ye Qingtang suddenly felt vibrations from the Deity Ocean. The source of those vibrations came from within her.

In the face of danger, Ye Qingtang had no time to ponder what had happened. She just remembered the power of the Deity Ocean’s vibrations earlier and immediately tried to make use of the power of these vibrations.

In the next second, a beam of light shot out from Ye Qingtang’s body.

Within seconds, Ye Qingtang felt the earth spin again and she disappeared.

Ye Qingtang was panting when she finally recovered from her dizziness. Scanning her surroundings, she realized that she had returned to that dark place from before.

The ferocious, evil Great General from the Heavenly Demon Race was nowhere to be seen.

Taking a deep breath to steady her pounding heart, Ye Qingtang stilled for a moment. But she remained very confused over what had happened.

She had already found it very strange when that Great General claimed the Deity Ocean was hidden inside her. When she had returned earlier, she had no idea where the Deity Ocean had disappeared to. Why was the Great General so certain?

But right at the brink of death, Ye Qingtang could feel the power of the Deity Ocean radiating from her own body. She couldn’t help feeling very shocked. Moreover, when she utilized that power, she had returned to this place again.

An inconceivable idea popped into Ye Qingtang’s head.

“Don’t tell me... the Deity Ocean... has merged with me??” Ye Qingtang murmured. This speculation was too scary to even consider!

Why did the Deity Ocean merge with her?!

Ye Qingtang took this opportunity to carefully analyze all that happened earlier.

“Could this Deity Ocean... be the power of a high-level Spiritual Abode?” Ye Qingtang mulled over the whole incident before coming to a startling conclusion. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Comparing the capabilities of the Deity Ocean with what Ye Qingtang understood about Spiritual Abodes, it seemed like the two were very similar.

Previously, Ye Qingtang overhead Hu saying that the Deity Ocean had existed for tens of thousands of years but had never landed on that altar. No fiendish demon had ever obtained it either.
