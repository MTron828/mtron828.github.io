Chapter 1303: A Conspiracy (2)

“Did my Royal Brother and Sister sleep well last night?” The Second Princess sat primly. She had rather narrow eyes that were set in a cold face, and her eyes now swept over the Eldest Prince and Princess.

“Of course we slept well.” Although the Eldest Prince had already guessed the Second Princess’s thoughts, he continued to maintain his posture of a kindly elder brother.

Rather, it was the Eldest Princess whose eyes glittered with disdain when she looked at the Second Princess.

The Second Princess laughed coldly and ignored the Eldest Prince’s calm reply.

“Eldest Royal Brother must be in a good mood to be able to sleep so well. But I… could not sleep at all last night.”

“Oh? Is our Second Royal Sister worried about something?” The Eldest Prince pretended not to understand.

The Second Princess grunted coldly and smoothed out a small wrinkle in her sleeve. “Eldest Royal Brother, why bother with this pretense at stupidity? You probably didn’t sleep a wink either.”

As she spoke, the Second Princess did not wait for the Eldest Prince to reply and said bluntly, “I am not here for this. Our Royal Father made Ling Yan the Crown Prince yesterday. Eldest Royal Brother, that must have been unpleasant for you. After all, you had just invited the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows, but the position of Crown Prince fell to someone else.”

“Second Royal Sister, I don’t understand what you are saying. It is our Royal Father’s will for our Third Royal Brother to be the Crown Prince. I have no complaints,” the Eldest Prince said with a smile.

The Second Princess detested the Eldest Prince’s hypocrisy. Although he always acted like a gentleman, he was actually more like a beast.

“Eldest Royal Brother, I shall just be direct. Ling Yan, you, and I have fought for the position of Crown Prince for a long time. Eldest Royal Brother and Sister previously worked together to imprison Ling Yan. Ling Yan will not easily overlook this wrong. If he really becomes the Emperor one day, what kind of life with my Eldest Royal Brother and Sister have?”

The Second Princess’s words caused the Eldest Prince’s expression to change slightly.

“Today, I have personally come here to form an alliance with my Eldest Royal Brother. We should set our quarrels aside. Our immediate problem is Ling Yan, who is currently the Crown Prince. He is our true enemy…” The Second Princess continued.

The Eldest Prince’s expression grew more solemn, and the smile on his face vanished. He took a small breath, and the warmth in his eyes was replaced with a sharp look.

“Second Royal Sister, you are here at just the right time. I was just discussing the matter with the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows.”

When the Second Princess saw that the Eldest Prince was finally speaking the truth, a trace of amusement appeared in her eyes. She looked over at Ye Qingtang and the others, who were sitting nearby.

“I wonder if the ambassadors from the Temple of Shadows have any good suggestions?”

The Second Princess and the Eldest Prince had been enemies. But now, they had a common enemy, and so they secretly formed a temporary alliance.

Lady Ghost laughed softly, but her gaze naturally fell on Ye Qingtang, and everyone else in the hall also looked at her. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang really had nothing to say.

Lady Ghost was clearly testing her to see how she reacted.

What sin had she committed!

Ye Qingtang secretly took a deep breath but continued to smile faintly. She slowly reached out and lifted her teacup from the table, then took a leisurely sip. “The Emperor makes the final decision on who will be the Crown Prince. If the Emperor likes you, he can make you the Crown Prince. But if he doesn’t… he can just as easily strip the Crown Prince of his title.”
