Chapter 928 Trade-Offs (4)

Yin Yang Child glanced disdainfully at the ordinary-looking ancient mirror.

“Lousy mirror?” The man in black armor looked at Yin Yang Child and laughed coldly. “Little fellow, you don’t know anything. Why don’t we give it a try?”.

“Ah… I’m afraid you’ll die under my sword,” Yin Yang Child said coldly.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, may I test it?” The man in black armor looked at the Divine Phoenix.

“You may.” The Divine Phoenix agreed immediately.

When they heard that, everyone turned their attention in that direction.

Everyone was aware of the Mirror of Illusions’s reputation. Of course, they knew about its extraordinary powers, but no one had been fortunate enough to see it.

At that moment, the desire to enrich their experiences naturally arose in all of them.

The man in black armor picked up the Mirror of Illusions and raised his brows slightly. He said to Yin Yang Child, “Draw your sword.”

Clank!

The long sword was unsheathed with a crisp ringing sound. It truly suited Yin Yang Child.

“Strike me,” the man in black armor said fearlessly.

“This is the first time I’ve heard such an unreasonable request.”

When he heard the man in black armor’s words, Yin Yang Child laughed coldly, and a cold light flashed across his eyes!

Since the Divine Phoenix had already agreed that they could act, he had no restraint.

As he spoke, Yin Yang Child flicked his wrist. The long sword glittered with cold light as it swept towards the man in black armor.

Swoosh!

A frightening howl emerged. A visible sword gleam swept towards the man in black armor with great speed.

However, the man in black armor did not panic. He raised the Mirror of Illusions in his hand slightly.

In the next second, a strange luster appeared on the Mirror of Illusions under everyone’s disbelieving gaze.

The sword gleam from Yin Yang Child’s stroke was immediately transformed into blocks of wood.

Clank! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Clank!

Clank!

The wooden blocks fell heavily to the ground. The man in black armor stood at the same spot, untouched.

The formless sword gleam had actually been transformed by the Mirror of Illusions into blocks of wood!

If they had not seen it with their own eyes, no one in this world would believe that such a thing could happen.

“This…”

“To think that such a treasure exists!”

“Truly frightening!”

Everyone was stunned when they witnessed the power of the Mirror of Illusions.

If they had the Mirror of Illusions, even the most terrifying strike could be defused easily!

“Yin Yang Child, did you see that? That was what you called a lousy mirror.” The man in black armor laughed.

“It’s still a lousy mirror.” Yin Yang Child shrugged.” It can block my sword gleam, but can it block my fists?”

Without waiting for the man in black armor to respond, Yin Yang Child stepped forward and punched the man in the face.

The man in black armor was completely unprepared, and Yin Yang Child’s fist smashed viciously into his face.

“You see, it can’t block my fists, ” Yin Yang Child said.

“You have a death wish!” The man in black armor roared in rage. He instantly kicked out and struck Yin Yang Child squarely in the stomach. The force of the kick sent Yin Yang Child flying

“You wanted to give it a try… how dare you retaliate?!” Yin Yang Child clambered up and shouted in rage.

“I allowed you to unsheathe your sword and strike me, but I didn’t allow you to hit me with your fists,” the man in black armor said.

“I’ll kill you!” Yin Yang Child was enraged. He struck a pose, ready to fight to the death with the man in black armor.

“How dare you!”

The Divine Phoenix suddenly shouted coldly.

When the Divine Phoenix spoke, Yin Yang Child and the man in black armor fell silent. They immediately retreated and did not dare to make a false move.
