Chapter 333: Sword Boy and Attendant Girl (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If the flair of the sword boy and attendant girl was great enough, they could be accepted as a disciple as an exception once they matured. However, these situations were very rare.

After entering the inner sect in her previous life, Ye Qingtang heard of such a prodigy where the sword boy was promoted to an inner sect disciple, and the name of that boy was Fei Ying!

Ye Qingtang only heard some rumors regarding Fei Ying in her previous life and knew that his endowment was even greater than some of the inner sect disciples. It was just that he was from a humble family. Despite that, his endowment freed him from the limitation of his family background, and he was highly regarded by the elders.

However…

A while after Fei Ying became an inner sect disciple, he committed murder in the inner sect.

After killing three inner sect disciples, he fled out of Xuanling Sect.

Xuanling Sect once ordered an arrest warrant on Fei Ying. A number of disciples had gone to catch him, but all of them died in Fei Ying’s hands. As the number of people Fei Ying murdered increased constantly, his name was even listed in the Assassination Roll!

It could be said that a few years later in the previous life, Fei Ying became malefic and betrayed and fled the sect.

Ye Qingtang never expected that she would actually meet Fei Ying who just became a sword boy when she entered the inner sect a few years earlier.

And this malefic who killed inner sect disciples in the future was actually her sword boy?!

“Is there anything wrong?” Fei Ying looked at Ye Qingtang anxiously. He had entered Xuanling Sect for about two years where he had been receiving lessons. Ye Qingtang was the first inner sect disciple he served, and he was very worried that she would be dissatisfied with his actions and words.

After all…

Sword boys like them did not have any place before the inner sect disciples.

If they caused the inner sect disciples to be unhappy, their future days would be extremely tough.

“Nothing.” Ye Qingtang sensed the nervousness on Fei Ying’s face and immediately shook her head with a smile. No matter what the rumors about Fei Ying were in the previous life, the young boy before her did not bring any sense of danger and was instead innocent and pure.

Exactly because there was a possibility of sword boys and attendant girls becoming inner sect disciples, many disciples deliberately guarded against them and even treated them extremely harshly.

Although Fei Ying heard Ye Qingtang, he was still unable to fully relax.

Once Ye Qingtang reached the door of her room, a pretty young girl with hair tied in two buns stood outside the door in a perfectly straight position. Once she saw Ye Qingtang, she immediately knelt and bowed. “Ni Shang greets Miss.”

Compared to Fei Ying who carried rumors of a malefic in the previous life, Ni Shang was fair and delicate, looking at most twelve or thirteen. Although she was still young, her facial features were already very developed. It seemed that in a few years time, she would become a stunning little beauty.

“The room is already prepared for you. Quickly go in and take a look, Miss.”

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly and entered her room. The room was rather wide with an elegant and unique furnish. There was a silver table cloth draped on the table near the door, and the pale pink lotus embroidery on it was exceptionally attractive.

Ye Qingtang took a glance of the room and turned to face Fei Ying and Ni Shang, who were standing outside the door. “It is very nicely decorated. You’ve worked hard, thank you.”

“It’s good that you like it. You don’t need to be so polite to us. It is our job to serve you,” Ni Shang said in a fluster.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com
