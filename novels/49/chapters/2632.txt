Chapter 2633 Han Cangming’s Ambush (4)

Ye Qingtang was also very helpless about this. Fortunately, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was not completely uncontrollable. Otherwise, Ye Qingtang would probably have to give up this forbidden bloodline.

It was not without reason that the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was classified as an emergency bloodline. Even Ye Qingtang was a little afraid of it. It was too overwhelming.

“Ha….”

Before Ye Qingtang could think further, an unexpected chuckle echoed across the air.

Ye Qingtang immediately stood up and surveyed her surroundings. However, it was all empty and Ye Qingtang did not see anyone.

“As expected, so it’s the forbidden bloodline, the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline,” the voice rang out again.

“Don’t play tricks. Show yourself.” Ye Qingtang was expressionless as she spoke coldly.

“As you wish.” In the next second, the void beside Ye Qingtang shattered and a silver wolf covered in black fog walked out.

Ye Qingtang stared at the huge silver wolf and frowned. It looked rather familiar…

Soon, the huge silver wolf transformed into a human. When she saw that person’s appearance, Ye Qingtang was surprised. “Demon God… Han Cangming?!”

Han Cangming was slightly taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words. His lips curled up as he stared at Ye Qingtang in confusion. “Demon God… this title is not bad.”

Han Cangming’s gaze landed on the Heavenly Emperor. He chuckled softly. “Is this what you call… endless joy by battling the heavens? How pitiful.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Han Cangming, not knowing what to say.

In this distant era, she did not have any connections to Han Cangming at all. Now that she was facing an Immortal Emperor at the same level as the Heavenly Emperor, Ye Qingtang felt quite pressured. Furthermore, Ye Qingtang did not know what Han Cangming wanted at this time.

Han Cangming walked around the Heavenly Emperor, looking like he was sizing him up. After a long while, his gaze suddenly landed on Ye Qingtang. “That’s right. You absorbed all the destructive force that injured him.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Han Cangming, not knowing what he meant.

“One of the ancient forbidden bloodlines. Legend has it that the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline can devour everything in the world and convert the energy into itself. It is definitely a formidable bloodline. Have you ever thought of the dire consequences of keeping such a bloodline on you?” Han Cangming suddenly smiled at Ye Qingtang. To her eyes, Han Cangming’s smile was so familiar and yet also so foreign. This smile was similar to Ling Yan’s. However, Ye Qingtang had never felt such terror from Ling Yan. There was a sharpness hidden in this smile. One wrong move and her throat would be sliced apart. This was the foremost feeling that Han Cangming was giving Ye Qingtang at that moment. It made her fearful and want to stay away from him.

“I’m very curious about your relationship with the Heavenly Emperor. Why are you helping him?” Han Cangming asked Ye Qingtang

“I don’t know him at all. I just can’t bear to see an Immortal Emperor die like this. That’s all,” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Can’t bear to see an Immortal Emperor die like this. Is that truly all?” Again the eerie smile was on Han Cangming’s face. “That’s all,” Ye Qingtang repeated firmly.VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔
