Chapter 973 The Match (5)

Duan Tianrao had regretted it when Ye Qingtang had restored her spirit root and entered the Xuanling Sect.

However, after obtaining the Long Family’s help, Duan Tianrao had rejoiced that his earlier engagement with Ye Qingtang had been broken.

So what if Ye Qingtang had entered the Xuanling Sect?

In the end, with her spirit root, she was destined to be only an outer sect disciple all her life. After he had obtained the Long Family’s help, she was no longer worthy of him.

“So what if she returned? It’s not a big deal.” Duan Tianrao dropped his gaze. Ye Qingtang was of no concern to him at all.

His engagement with Ye Qingtang had been dissolved. Ye Xun, whom he had been engaged to later, had vanished. Now, he was on good terms with the Young Lady of the Long Family. In Duan Tianrao’s eyes, only a powerful girl like her was worthy to stand by his side.

When Duan Tianrui saw that his second brother was so unconcerned, he did not pay any more attention to Ye Qingtang.

After all, the Ye Family today could not compare with their Duan Family. The Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family was, naturally, beneath them.

On the other side, Duan Tianyun had slowly ascended the dais. He looked at Dan Yifan, who was standing on the dais, and said, “Since it is a match between the younger generation of the two families, I don’t mind giving it a try. You can spout your nonsense after you have beaten me.”

Dan Yifan narrowed his eyes slightly.

“What’s the matter? Are you afraid? Or can it be…” A mocking smile flashed across Duan Tianyun’s eyes. “The members of the Ye Family are cowards?”

“Let’s have a match then.” Dan Yifan frowned with displeasure. Every word this Duan Tianyun uttered was grating.

A smile flashed across Duan Tianyun’s eyes. He unbuckled his sword in front of the audience and threw it to Duan Tianrui, who was standing below the dais.

“What do you mean by this?” Dan Yifan asked coldly when he saw what Duan Tianyun had done.

Duan Tianyun lifted his chin, looked at Dan Yifan, and said, “Do I need a sword to deal with you? My fists will do.”

“What arrogance!” A cold look flashed across Dan Yifan’s eyes. With that, he raised his sword and slashed at Duan Tianyun!

Duan Tianyun eyes were cold when he saw Dan Yifan charging at him with burning flames. The next second, he suddenly directed all his energy and aimed a mighty blow at Dan Yifan!

Ye Qingtang was standing below the dais, watching the two men on the dais. When she saw Dan Yifan’s move, she said blandly, “Dan Yifan is no match for Duan Tianyun.”

“What did you say?” The Ye Family disciples standing nearby frowned with displeasure when they heard Ye Qingtang’s words.

They had all followed the Great Elder and the Third Elder into the Ye Family and were not close to the Eldest Young Lady, Ye Qingtang.

“Eldest Young Lady, Young Master Dan is fighting for our Ye Family. You may not be contributing, but you need not run off your mouth here either.”

“That’s right. Young Master Dan is an inner sect disciple of the Leiting Sect. How can he lose to that Duan Tianyun?”

Many of the Ye Family disciples did not like Ye Qingtang. Besides her numerous rejections of Dan Yifan’s good intentions, Dan Yifan was currently fighting for the Ye Family, and it was very annoying for her to speak like that before the fight had even started.

Ye Qingtang swept a glance at the unhappy youths and refrained from further speech.

But at that moment, there was chaos on the dais. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Dan Yifan, shrouded in layers of burning flames, was sent flying by Duan Tianyun’s blow!

Dan Yifan fell heavily off the dais with a loud crash. The burning flames around him seemed to be covered by a layer of frost. The baking heat was being consumed by the blasts of cold air.
