Chapter 574 Immortals and Buddhas (1)

Ye Qingtang brought the Blood Moon Elder and rapidly fled to a corner of a street. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

There was absolutely no life in the blood-colored city. The air of death lingered at every inch of the place as though the tragic torture of the underworld once existed, and it seemed as if everyone was dyed with blood and as if resentment filled the sky.

While this was a land of evil spirits, even the Blood Moon Elder was unwilling to stay any longer.

Ye Qingtang scanned the surroundings with a deep frown.

Without a doubt, the place was a completely dead city with no presence of life and only an utter coldness.

The Hell of Avicinaraka here was said to simulate the ancient battlefield back then. Tens of thousands of years ago, the Fourth Domain still existed in this world.

However, that mysterious fourth domain disappeared in a night. The Fourth Domain included hundreds of mainlands without any living beings

There were once rumors that Perfected Immortals and Buddhas appeared on the vanished fourth domain before. Their teachings once disseminated to every corner of the world. But as the Fourth Domain mysteriously disappeared, all the legends regarding Immortals and Buddhas subsequently vanished like smoke in the air as well.

“Could there… really be Immortals and Buddhas… in this world…” Ye Qingtang was shaken.

After hearing Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Elder was in deep thought. “My Holy Lord once brought back a piece of an ancient stone tablet which was said to be left behind by the powerful figure whom the Xuanling Patriarch saved back then… The contents on the stone tablet… are a little similar to the scene today where the Buddha consumed people alive and chewed on flesh…”

“Could it be that the person whom the Xuanling Patriarch saved back then knows about the secret of the Fourth Domain that disappeared years ago… She ultimately sealed everything she saw and heard in her own Spiritual Abode… After that powerful figure died, the Spiritual Abode turned into a mystic realm while everything she sealed back then became the Hell of Avicinaraka today…” Ye Qingtang said.

“Holy Lady, I think there is a high possibility for that. When a Spiritual Abode becomes a mystic realm or a dangerous land, most of them were related to the things they heard and saw or their obsession and resentment. The Spiritual Abode of those with deep resentment would turn into a dangerous land while the Spiritual Abode of loyal and righteous people would turn into a blessed Grotto-heaven to benefit others. On the other hand, when some powerful figures died, their Spiritual Abodes would turn into the scene that they once imagined during their lifetime… just like this Hell of Avicinaraka.” The Blood Moon Elder seemed to be in thought.

Speaking in another way, the powerful figure whom the Xuanling Patriarch rescued should know some secrets behind the disappearance of the Fourth Domain and stored whatever she saw and thought in her Spiritual Abode. When that powerful figure died, the Spiritual Abode turned into a mystic realm which was the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka…

True gods indeed existed in this world. Everyone knew that the supposed Perfected Immortals and ancient Buddhas only appeared in the Fourth Domain that mysteriously disappeared tens of thousands of years ago…

Hence, Ye Qingtang was certain that the evil

monsters and demonic spirits here should be what that dead powerful figure saw and heard in the Fourth Domain.

“So Perfected Immortals and ancient Buddhas were not only legends and truly existed tens of thousands of years ago… But why is it that all of them have completely vanished today despite being so powerful… How did that mysterious and powerful Fourth Domain disappear… Its said that the ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals were extraordinary existences and that their teachings delivered all living creatures from suffering and was full of compassion… However, in this Hell of Avicinaraka, the Buddha became a monster that consumed living things

What exactly…”

Ye Qingtang mumbled as puzzlement filled her eyes.
