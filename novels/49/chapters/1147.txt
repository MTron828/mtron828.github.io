Chapter 1148: You Are Thinking Too Much (3)

“This…”

At that moment, the Blood Moon Elder looked frightened. The power of his new body was unable to withstand the oppressive force of the golden-robed man’s aura!

“Do you still want to be general?”

The golden-robed man stood in the void. His bland gaze fell on the Blood Moon Elder, and he spoke coldly.

However, before the Blood Moon Elder could speak, Ye Qingtang drew her sword.

The crimson sword glow seemed to pierce the horizon as it slashed straight at the golden-robed man.

Although the golden-robed man was powerful, the strength of his body could not be compared with that of the Blood Moon Elder.

When Ye Qingtang’s sword struck the Blood Moon Elder’s body, it had no effect. But if it struck the golden-robed man’s body, even with the protection of his Heavenly Venerate powers, he would probably be uncomfortable.

Swoosh!

An ear-splitting noise rang out, and in the next instant, the golden-robed man transformed into a shadow and vanished.

Boom!

The crimson sword glow struck by Ye Qingtang extended for a distance of ten meters, and its aftershock completely destroyed a mountain peak.

“A meaningless struggle.”

The golden-robed man’s figure appeared again. His inky black hair blew in the wind. He looked down on Ye Qingtang like a supreme master.

“Kneel!”

The golden-robed man’s Heavenly Venerate power rushed forth again and crushed Ye Qingtang.

Boom!

At that moment, Ye Qingtang was trying to withstand enormous pressure. Her body felt as if it weighed a ton, and it instantly crushed the ground under her feet.

At that moment, a black mist shrouded Ye Qingtang’s body, and the power of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline rushed forth. It frantically devoured the golden-robed man’s Heavenly Venerate power.

A pity that Ye Qingtang’s Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was not of sufficiently high level, or it could instantly and completely devour the golden-robed man’s ultimate source of strength and convert it for her own use.

“Oh…”

When the golden-robed man saw the black mist that surfaced around Ye Qingtang’s body, he could not help but frown. “Heavenly Demon Bloodline… Are you a member of the Jiang Family?”

The power of the Heavenly Demon Bloodline was unique to the family of Central Mainland’s Domain Monarch. Only members of the Jiang Family had the Heavenly Demon Bloodline. When he recognized the Heavenly Demon Bloodline in Ye Qingtang’s body, the golden-robed man assumed that she was a member of the Jiang Family.

When she heard that, Ye Qingtang rolled her eyes. It looked as if the golden-robed man of the Ancient You Clan had assumed she was part of the Central Mainland Domain Monarch’s family after seeing that she possessed the Heavenly Demon’s bloodline.

Ye Qingtang did not correct his mistake but laughed coldly and said, “Since you know I am part of Central Mainland’s Domain Monarch’s family, how dare you act so impetuously!”

When he heard that, the golden-robed man said expressionlessly, “The Ancient You Clan has never had anything to do with the Jiang Family. It was you who was too impolite. Even the Domain Monarch himself might not dare to act like that… Since you have violated the terms of peace between the two tribes, I will kill you and send your head to the Domain Monarch.”

Before Ye Qingtang could continue speaking, the golden-robed man’s expression suddenly changed, and he swiftly hid himself somewhere in the distance.

Thud!

The place where the golden-robed man was standing suddenly contracted. At the peak of its contraction, it violently exploded.

If the golden-robed man had fled a little slower, he would have been crushed by the force of the distorted space. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Who is it? Since you are here, why not show yourself?” The golden-robed man spoke coldly with a stern expression.

Just as the golden-robed man finished speaking, a white-robed old man suddenly appeared in the void.

“Space Technique…”

The golden-robed man frowned deeply as he looked at the old man standing casually nearby.
