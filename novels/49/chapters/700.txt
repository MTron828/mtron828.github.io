At the moment, a well-dressed young man suddenly stepped forward and walked in front towards Master Du.

“Master Du, I’m Chu Yi from the Tiangang Sect. Today, I’m here to meet you in the name of my master.” The young man explained slowly.

Master Du’s sight then landed on Chu Yi.

The rest in the forging workshop looked at Chu Yi in awe when they heard that he was a Tiangang Sect disciple.

Tiangang Sect was a super sect of the Nine Nights Dynasty. Its ability could be compared to that of the Falling Sky Valley. People who were able to enter the Tiangang Sect were extremely talented.

“My Master has sent a letter previously. May I know whether Master Du has received that?” Chu Yi smiled and asked.

Master Du nodded his head slightly.

Seeing the Tiangang Sect disciple Chu Yi, others interpreted Master Du’s response differently. Previously, they thought that Master Du was invited out by the dagger of the unknown young man. Now, it seemed that they were thinking too much.

When Du Sheng was introducing Ye Qingtang to Master Du, his voice was soft. Thus, no one else heard that besides the two of them.

Now, as they saw Tiangang Sect disciple Chu Yi go forward, they all credited Chu Yi for inviting Master Du out.

Chu Yi also thought that way.

“It’s my pleasure to be able to meet Master Du today. My Master wants you to help him to forge a sword. My Master said that as long as you are willing to do so, he will offer a few hundred kilograms of black gold meteoric iron,” Chu Yi said respectfully.

The moment Chu Yi finished his words, gasps sounded throughout the forging workshop.

How precious was black gold meteoric iron?

It was almost impossible to find any weapon forged using black gold meteoric iron in normal forging workshops.

A few kilograms of black gold meteoric iron could not be calculated by money. Only a super sect like the Tiangang Sect would be able to offer a few kilograms of black gold meteoric iron at one shot.

Everyone’s eyes were filled with joy. How lucky they would be if they could get a weapon forged using black gold meteoric iron?

No wonder Master Du came out personally! The price that the Tiangang Sect offered was too tempting!

“Black gold meteoric iron?” Master Du’s face was expressionless.

“Yes.” Chu Yi nodded.

“I’m not short of black gold meteoric iron, and I’m not interested in forging any weapon for your master. If you do not have other things, please leave.” Master Du waved his hand impatiently.

His words shocked Chu Yi and everyone else.

“Master Du, what… what do you mean? Did you not agree to forge a weapon for my Master?” Chu Yi panicked as he did not imagine that he would receive such an answer.

“When did I agree to that?” Master Du frowned.

“You received my Master’s letter, and the letter also explains my Master’s intention. Did you not agree to my Master’s request since you came out personally today?” Chu Yi said.

Chu Yi was stunned. The letter clearly explained his Master’s request and said that he would be here at this time. He thought that Master Du must have agreed since he came out personally. However, he did not expect Master Du to reject his request!

Master Du frowned and took a glimpse at Chu Yi. “How does coming out here have anything to do with your master? Who said that I walked out because of your Master?”
