Chapter 1139: Shell (1)

Ultimately, Ye Qingtang gave in and allowed the Blood Moon Elder to do as he wanted.

…

At the same time, dozens of miles away.

Two immensely good-looking men stood in the air silently.

A blood-colored long robe swayed in the wind as a pair of cold eyes landed on Han Cangming.

“Han Cangming, you could have stayed out of this,” the Blood Moon Holy Lord said without emotions after a while.

Han Cangming was silent.

“I’m very curious. Are you really the Demon God, Han Cangming?” A long time later, Blood Moon Holy Lord asked once again though he looked at Han Cangming with suspicion and confusion.

Han Cangming was known as the Demon God, but everyone knew that he was not a demon. It was just that his intellect was demon-like; thus, people named him as the Demon God.

Although Han Cangming’s martial skills were Emperor-level, it was slightly inferior when compared to other Emperor-level figures.

What people were afraid of in Han Cangming was not his cultivation base but his intellect. Compared to his intelligence, his Emperor-level skills were nothing at all.

However, the current Han Cangming was not the one in the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s memory.

The Han Cangming before seemed to be a completely different person. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Han Cangming… Ye Qingtang’s death is also greatly beneficial to you,” the Blood Moon Holy Lord said coldly when he saw that Han Cangming had yet to respond.

“No.” Han Cangming narrowed his eyes and ultimately spoke. “My heart is in her body.”

“Heart…” Blood Moon Holy Lord’s eyes flickered. “So you believe that the heart in Ye Qingtang’s body is yours?”

Han Cangming did not reply, but his silence seemed to verify the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s question.

“As a Demon God who has a demon intellect… since when did you become an idiot?” The Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at the silent Han Cangming, and his suspicions intensified.

“You don’t have any ability to think independently. Are you really Han Cangming?”

Han Cangming’s brows furrowed slightly.

Swoosh!

All of a sudden, without any warning at all, the Blood Moon Holy Lord formed a strange print with his palm. A blood-colored bolt of lightning appeared in the sky and struck down at Han Cangming.

Han Cangming reacted swiftly and immediately descended to the ground, avoiding the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s fatal blow.

However, when Han Cangming landed on the ground, two blood-colored metal chains shot out from the ground and trapped Han Cangming tightly.

“As expected…”

The Blood Moon Holy Lord landed on the ground with his hands behind him a while later.

“I formed two remarkable skills just now. The first was a seal that activated from the ground while the second was a small Heavenly Tribulation that activated from the sky. You only saw the small Heavenly Tribulation but was unable to think of the sealed boundary on the ground…” The Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at Han Cangming and said.

Han Cangming was emotionless and did not understand what the Blood Moon Holy Lord was saying.

“So… you’re only a shell that acts instinctively… without any thinking ability at all.” Blood Moon Holy Lord’s eyes glistened. “What a joke. I fought with a shell for so long.”

Only an Emperor-level figure could slip away by withdrawing his soul to be reborn and leave his shell behind to trick the world…

The so-called shell only had the Emperor-level figure’s instinctive thinking and did not possess any consciousness or emotions, including independent thinking. It was merely a power storehouse.
