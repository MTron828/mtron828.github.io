Chapter 2737: Return to the Blue Sky Domain (2)

Every single move she made inadvertently revealed a terrifying aura that was sufficient to destroy the heavens and the earth. How shocking was that?

Having reached this level, Ye Ling naturally understood that Ye Qingtang had more important things to do.

Memories of the past swirled around Falling Sky Valley.

After staying with Ye Ling and her master for a few days, Ye Qingtang returned to the Temple of Shadows.

...

The demon dragon was sleeping outside the Temple of Shadows. She could not help recalling the scene when she fought alongside the demon dragon against the Ancient You Clan.

Without waking the demon dragon, Ye Qingtang entered the temple.

“What are we doing here?” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang with a strange expression.

The little white tiger stared at the big yellow dog. For some reason, it instinctively felt fear. Although it was a Fiendcelestial Beast, it did not dare to approach this mere dog.

“You are so powerful now…” The little white tiger stared at Ye Qingtang.” Can you… do me a favor? ”

“Finish off the Heaven-Devouring Beast?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“How did you know?” The little white tiger was surprised. After all, its clan people were trapped in their hometown because of the Heaven-Devouring Beast.

“Of course I can.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

......

“Sigh, your top priority now is the power of the Heavenly Dao.” The big yellow dog shook its tail and stared at Ye Qingtang.

“Yes… but you have some free time.” Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the big yellow dog. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The big yellow dog, “…”

“No, no, I’m afraid of my enemies…” The yellow dog shook its head.

“The upper realm is gone. How do you have any enemies?” Ye Qingtang was confused.

“This…” The yellow dog’s face was filled with reluctance.

“With your skills, it’s just a quick trip. Otherwise, I will go myself.” Ye Qingtang said.

“That won’t do. You have to quickly absorb the power of the Heavenly Dao. That mastermind will definitely come looking for us… If we don’t deal with him, you won’t be able to become a Perfected Immortal no matter how many times you visit the upper realm…” The yellow dog said.” Forget it, I’ll go. ”

...

After the yellow dog and little white tiger left, Ye Qingtang wanted to use the relic to absorb the Heavenly Dao energy in her heart, but she realized that there was also a trace of Heavenly Dao energy in the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang immediately entered the forbidden room and stepped into the constellation again.

“Lucky explorer, welcome to the Illusory Void again… I am the God of Nature.” A star spirit drifted in the void.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Huh…” When the star spirit saw Ye Qingtang clearly, it sounded shocked.” A divine body…”

“There’s a very powerful Heavenly Dao force here,” Ye Qingtang muttered.

“As long as you can pass all 10 star doors, I can give you all the Heavenly Dao energy left behind by the God of Nature,” the star spirit said.

“Really…”

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought before a “clang” rang out.

Swoosh!

A pitch-black sword beam shot into the sky.

“Boom!”

A loud bang shook the sky and the 10 star doors were instantly shattered by Ye Qingtang.

“Is this good enough?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“You, this won’t do. You have a divine body… and a divine weapon… I haven’t adjusted the difficulty level properly!” The star spirit said hurriedly.

“But you didn’t say so earlier. Are you going back on your word?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Going back on my word? I am the essence of the God of Nature. How can I go back on my word?” the star spirit said.

After a short pause, the star spirit snorted. “Forget it, take it.”

As it spoke, the star spirit scattered, filling the void with the power of the Heavenly Dao.
