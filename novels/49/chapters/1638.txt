Chapter 1639: Insane Luck (1)

Ye Qingtang smiled and blamed herself for thinking too much. She gave Jiang Yisheng’s stuff to Jiang Shaobai. Jiang Shaobai asked a few questions, and Ye Qingtang replied accordingly.

However, on the second day, Ye Qingtang was stunned when she saw Jiang Yisheng and the rest being beaten by someone.

“Traitor...” Jiang Yisheng’s entire face was swollen. He stared at Ye Qingtang miserably.

“Sister Qing, try this. It’s delicious.” Jiang Shaobai seemed like she did not see them at all. She passed all the good food to Ye Qingtang.

“...” Ye Qingtang was confused.

Did Jiang Shaobai beat them?

Ye Qingtang suddenly understood why Jiang Yisheng and the rest looked like they saw a ghost when they knew Jiang Shaobai was coming back.

It is really...

Miserable.

...

As time passed, the Martial Arts Championship was about to be held. Ye Qingtang cultivated every day, but she was stuck at the peak of Third Heaven and could not progress further.

The selection of descendants for the Martial Arts Championship also began in the Taiyuan Valley.

The Martial Arts Championship was significant to all ancient clans. Every descendant in the Taiyuan Valley would participate in the selection. Participants would be paired based on drawn lots, and the top twenty would join the Martial Arts Championship.

Jiang Yisheng and the rest were all prepared, but Jiang Shaobai did not seem to care. She did not cultivate either.

On the day of the selection, Jiang Yisheng and the rest were ready early in the morning. They came to look for Ye Qingtang to head to the parade square, but Jiang Shaobai was still sleeping. When she saw that Ye Qingtang and the rest were ready to leave, she just stood by the door and waved her hands towards them.

“All the best, Sister Qing!”

Ye Qingtang looked at how sleepy Jiang Shaobai was, but she could not say anything as she was dragged away by Jiang Yisheng.

“Don’t waste time here. We may get better lots if we go earlier.” Jiang Yisheng dragged Ye Qingtang away. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Is Shaobai going?” Ye Qingtang was curious.

“Why does she need to go? Jiang Yanyun and she do not need to attend the selection. They are pre-selected candidates,” Jiang Yisheng said.

“...” Ye Qingtang turned back and looked at Jiang Shaobai, who was waving at her. She was more curious.

She had never seen Jiang Shaobai revealing her true abilities, but Jiang Yisheng and the rest seemed to be afraid of her. With the exception of the elite few, all candidates for the Martial Arts Championship had to be selected; even Jiang Yiran and Jiang Yisheng were not exempt from this rule.

Jiang Yanyun was the top in the Taiyuan Valley, so it was normal that he did not need to attend.

However, Jiang Shaobai...

Ye Qingtang usually did not walk around in the valley as she spent most of the time cultivating. She was not aware of that.

They arrived at the parade square of Taiyuan Valley soon. The Elders had been waiting for a while, and Jiang Family disciples were all prepared. They were all waiting for the result of lots and could not wait to start their fight.

Elder Qian glanced at the crowd and nodded in satisfaction, but he did not pay extra attention to Ye Qingtang when he saw her.

Though he had high hopes for her, she was not talented enough. Elder Qian gave her some tips but did not spend much time with her.

The lots would be drawn when everyone arrived.
