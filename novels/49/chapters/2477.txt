Chapter 2478: Chasing Them (2)

“I was thinking of the Yongle Tribe this time when I came back. But I can see that the Yongle Tribe isn’t as good as it was in the past and seeing this, I cannot rest assured.”

The Yongle Tribe General fell silent as he heard this. With the Yongle Tribe’s current might, they couldn’t compete with the more powerful tribes in this space. They couldn’t even deal with the Xihai Tribe.

Lu Yuanxiang was speaking the truth and the Yongle Tribe General had no explanation for it.

“We are nothing compared to your great ancestors,” the Yongle Tribe General finally said.

“Don’t worry, I don’t plan on letting the Yongle Tribe fall any further. You can leave for now. I will inform you if I need anything.” The Flying Star Academy teacher waved his hand.

“Understood.”

The Yongle Tribe General got up and left.

Now, all they had to do was stay in this room until Ye Qing regained his strength and brought them out of this space.

As they were in the Yongle Tribe, which meant that even if the Xihai Tribe were to follow their tracking marks here, it wouldn’t be easy to get to them.

After two days, Ye Qingtang’s control over the Deity Ocean had more or less recovered. She just needed two more days before she could bring them out of there. But her eyes darted around as she thought of a few problems.

She could bring people inside the Deity Ocean, so could she bring those inside out of this space?

Of course, it was just a passing thought and she had no intention of actually doing so.

This space was filled with demons after all, and even though there were still many unknown areas, she had not found her footing yet and there was no way she could capture a demon to try it out.

Before she could continue on her train of thoughts, a knock came from the door.

“Yes,” Ye Qingtang replied.

The Great General pushed open the door.

“Ancestor Qing, there are urgent matters that we need to discuss. Kindly head to the main hall,” the Yongle Tribe General said.

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head in agreement. She quickly followed the Yongle Tribe General to the main hall.

The Flying Star Academy teacher, Lu Yuanxiang and the rest were already there. With the arrival of Ye Qingtang, everyone was present.

“Speak. What is it?” Lu Yuanxiang asked.

“Ancestors… It’s the Xihai Tribe.” The Great General spoke frankly.

“The Xihai Tribe…”

Everyone fell into thought as they heard this.

Did that mean that the Xihai Tribe was coming straight for the Yongle Tribe?

“The Xihai Tribe General’s only son was murdered. He has already surrounded us, insisting that the murderer is within our ranks. I remembered that Ancestor Qing mentioned something about killing the Xihai Tribe… so…” The Yongle Tribe General looked at Ye Qingtang.

“That’s right,” Ye Qingtang said expressionlessly. “I killed him.”

With that, the Yongle Tribe General fell silent. No one knew what he was thinking.

“What, so you are saying that the current Xihai Tribe dares to lead its entire army to surround my Yongle Tribe?” the Flying Star Academy teacher said as he glanced at the Yongle Tribe General.

“I apologize for my incompetence… in the past few years, the difference in power between the Yongle Tribe and the Xihai Tribe meant that we’ve never been able to make them retreat…” the Yongle Tribe General said.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Yongle Tribe General. So this was the final test for them. The Yongle Tribe was definitely not weak, or they would have been swallowed by the Xihai Tribe a long time ago, given their proximity.

The Yongle Tribe General had only said this to test their strength.

If the Yongle Tribe General really believed their identity, there was no way he would let the Xihai Tribe surround the Yongle Tribe..
