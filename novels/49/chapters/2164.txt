Chapter 2165: Failing To Recognize A Formidable Person (3)

“Boss?”

Ye Qingtang sighed and waved at Lei Yan and Nangong Lie.

The two of them bustled over.

With one hand on each of their shoulders, Ye Qingtang said gravely, “I have an important task for you two.”

“Whatever you need!”

“Boss, we await your instructions!”

“Lei Yan.”

“Yes!”

“Go and get Qin Feng back here,” Ye Qingtang said.

Lei Yan: “...”

“Nangong Lie, go and get Yun Chen.” Ye Qingtang continued her instructions.

“No problem. I will go and find Yun Chen immediately!” Nangong Lie patted his chest and shot off. But Lei Yan’s face was filled with a conflicted expression...

Qin Feng...

Could he request to change his target with Nangong Lie?

...

Soon after, Lei Yan and Nangong Lie went forth to find their intended targets. Ye Qingtang remained behind to continue observing Jing Ze’s condition.

The awakening of a bloodline would bring about certain side effects. Jing Ze was still unconscious and Ye Qingtang asked Mu Ziying to go back and take a rest first. After all, the little girl also endured quite a bit of trauma today. But Mu Ziying only shook her head stubbornly.

“You are able to defeat Meng Yao. Why didn’t you resist?” Ye Qingtang looked at Mu Ziying, who was sitting in front of her.

The cultivation levels of Mu Ziying and Meng Yao were similar. And after Ye Qingtang’s teaching, Ye Qingtang knew very well that Mu Ziying would definitely beat Meng Yao in a fight.

Mu Ziying lowered her head and kept silent. She just continued to hug her puppet tightly.

Ye Qingtang felt that there was some hidden compartment inside Mu Ziying’s heart, locking up all her thoughts inside.

Since Mu Ziying was unwilling to explain, Ye Qingtang decided not to force her. She just let her be. But after keeping silent for a long time, Mu Ziying suddenly spoke up.

“Teacher Ye... I don’t want to cause any trouble.”

More importantly, she didn’t want to cause trouble for Teacher Ye.

Ye Qingtang gave a gentle sigh. Mu Ziying was extremely introverted but she was also exceptionally soft-hearted.

Mu Ziying also heaved a secret sigh of relief on seeing that Ye Qingtang didn’t continue to interrogate her. But after looking at the unconscious Jing Ze, a conflicted expression crossed Mu Ziying’s face.

If she continued in this way, all those around her would eventually be implicated...

...

Jing Ze’s temperature finally returned to normal after a long time.

At this moment, Nangong Lie was leading the good-natured Yun Chen back to the classroom. Although Yun Chen had decided to leave then, he behaved very respectfully toward Ye Qingtang.

“Teacher Ye.” Yun Chen greeted her politely. He appeared to be very respectful but in reality, he exuded a hint of aloofness.

This was a teenager who looked exceptionally gentle on the outside, but Ye Qingtang could feel a hint of arrogance in his bearing.

Yun Chen had a naturally weak body and it was very difficult for him to improve his martial arts. Nevertheless, he was talented in refining elixirs. He used to be a student at the spiritual cultivation faculty, but because of his physical condition, he was transferred to the medical faculty. Everything had been going well but Yun Chen’s bloodline made it difficult for him to refine elixirs. He had the Drifting Cloud Bloodline, which was actually a good bloodline. It was a pity that the Drifting Cloud Bloodline made one’s aura to surge and ebb. When this happened during the refinement of elixirs, it would make the elixir very unstable.

For elixirs which could usually be refined after three tries, Yun Chen would need at least 10 attempts before succeeding.

As a result, Yun Chen had also fallen into the Netherworld Academy’s blacklist, with subtle signs that he would soon be kicked out.

Ye Qingtang nodded at Yun Chen. Qin Feng had yet to arrive and she was in no hurry to speak first.
