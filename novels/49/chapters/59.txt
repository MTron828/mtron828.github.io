Chapter 60: Retaliation (3)

Once Ye Qingtang had spoken those words, the Great Elder was shocked stiff for a moment.

“If you’re intent on investigating, you ought to start with Qin Luo’s Pavilion then. Most likely, you can uncover the mastermind there, you reckon?” Ye Qingtang looked straight at the Great Elder with a smirk on her face.

At the moment, the Great Elder’s face was stricken grim.

Never did he expect Ye Qingtang to discover a clue about those assassins. Even if they had turned against him out of the blue, the Great Elder could not confront them directly.

After all….

He was the one who had hired their services to begin with.

Though the assassination was a failure, if a rumor of him hiring assassins was to spread around, his reputation would plummet and all his machinations would easily raise suspicions from the public.

The Great Elder’s face became contorted with anxiety when he realized the risk. To dwell on the case would be most unwise and therefore, though he was still disturbed by Ye Qingtang’s findings, he could only put on a composed front, saying: “Since you’ve witnessed that, I’ll send the men to investigate. If it’s really their doing, I’ll make sure they cough up the mastermind.”

The Great Elder heaved a deep breath before he committed to follow up on the investigations personally.

Since he could never allow Ye Ling or the Second Elder to make the investigations otherwise.

“In that case, before you discern the truth, the Second Elder will be innocent.” Ye Qingtang had a beaming smile on her face as she thwarted the Great Elder’s plan directly to his face.

The Great Elder now looked like someone who had eaten dirt.

Failing to get rid of Ye Ling yesterday was already a blunder. Allowing Ye Qingtang to discover the identity of those assassins; inadvertently thwarting his plan to frame the Second Elder today, was akin to rubbing salt into his wound….

The Great Elder no longer wished to debate on the matter and just nodded slightly to her statement.

“Since you’ve no objections, let’s return for now.” Ye Qingtang maintained her smile as she indulged in the Great Elder’s anguish with a mischievous gleam in her eyes.

The Great Elder snorted in return and without another word, he turned around to board his carriage.

With the Great Elder’s departure, the Second Elder whom had remained silent all this while finally spoke up.

“Tang Tang, long time no see. You’ve completely changed, and for the better. Now, your father and I can finally stop worrying about you.” The Second Elder regarded Ye Qingtang amicably. He and Ye Ling had always been concerned over Ye Qingtang’s timorous nature, as it would certainly hinder her duties as the future head of the household.

But now, it seemed they had been overprotective instead.

“Father had arranged the finest liquors, prepared to celebrate your return. Let’s go home and we can drink and chat on our way back.” Ye Qingtang suggested as she looked upon the Second Elder with warmth in her eyes. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

In her past, regardless of her meek and timid nature, the Second Elder had always stood by and protected her. He could be considered a close relative, and now that his life was saved, Ye Qingtang could finally absolve one of her deepest regrets.

“Good. It’s been too long. I can finally drink to my heart’s content.” The Second Elder laughed merrily as he voiced his enthusiasm.

With that decided, Ye Qingtang, Ye Ling and the Second Elder boarded the same carriage and returned home.

While the carriage rolled swiftly along the roads, they shared the recent happenings in the household and though the Second Elder was injured, his wound did not stop him from indulging in his drinks.

But when he learned that Duan Tianrao had called off his engagement with Ye Qingtang to be with Ye Xun, his face clouded over in an instant.
