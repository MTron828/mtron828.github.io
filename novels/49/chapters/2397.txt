Chapter 2398: Slow And Steady (4)

“So it’s you guys.” The person commented when he saw Ye Qing’s team.

Ye Qingtang also saw who it was.

It was Qiu Nan’s teacher.

“Teacher, are you alright?” Anxious voices rang out as a bunch of wretched-looking teenagers rushed over.

Qiu Nan was amongst them.

But he was in a rather pathetic state. His arms were covered in cuts and bruises, large patches of blood staining his sleeves. Some of his wounds were even turning black around the edges.

Qiu Nan slowed down significantly when he saw Ye Qingtang’s team in front. Their teacher had his students crack open the demon’s skull and retrieve a demon crystal.

“Teacher Ye, I wonder how many demons have you killed?” The teacher gazed coldly at Ye Qing with the demon crystal in hand.

Compared to his team, Ye Qing and his students looked too clean. It was like they had not fought at all.

“None,” Ye Qingtang replied in all honesty.

The teacher gave a cold laugh. He glanced at Ran Mo, Qin Feng and the rest.

“Teacher Ye, let me give you a piece of advice. Even if you don’t care about your own reputation, you need to consider the honor of the Netherworld Academy. Never mind that you were too afraid to participate in the earlier sparring matches, now you are still too cowardly to take any action? Do you know that everyone on the outside can see everything that we do in here? Go ahead and embarrass yourself if you want, but don’t drag the name of the Netherworld Academy into the mud with you!”

It was well known that Ye Qing had two exceptional students, Ran Mo and Qin Feng, under him, but he didn’t seem to have any intention of fighting. The teacher was very annoyed by that. That teacher looked at Ran Mo, Qin Feng and the rest.

“You kids will amount to nothing under a teacher like this.”

Qin Feng and the others remained impassive. Song Yanhan was the only one who lowered his head sheepishly, unable to hide the anxiety simmering inside.

That teacher was not the only one. Song Yanhan also felt that Ye Qing was too cowardly. They had already spent a full day inside the Wailing Well but had not taken any action. It should be pointed out that their team was the strongest one from the Netherworld Academy.

In the end…

They didn’t even have the courage to fight any demons.

It was a massive loss of face to the Netherworld Academy.

“Ye Qing, I don’t care that you lack courage, but you cannot be a burden to these kids. I don’t like your cowardly antics but for the sake of the Netherworld Academy, I can consider joining forces with you. But your students will have to follow my instructions.” The teacher grew increasingly frustrated on seeing Ye Qing’s attitude. If not for how powerful Ran Mo and the others were, he would not even bother wasting words on these cowards.

The teams from the various schools were all scattered inside the Wailing Well and it was not easy to meet another team from the same academy. If they had the good fortune to meet their other schoolmates, they would usually join forces and fight together, for the sake of winning.

“Teacher Ye, I think that this teacher’s suggestion…” Song Yanhan felt that this teacher was being very reasonable.

But Ye Qing replied, “No need to trouble yourself. We will fight our own battles.”

The teacher and Song Yanhan were taken aback by Ye Qing’s words. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The brusque dismissal made that teacher feel infuriated. But Ye Qing was the leader. Without his agreement, he could not force the latter’s team to cooperate.

“Ye Qing, they will end up in a dismal state because of you.” The teacher snorted before leading his own team away.
