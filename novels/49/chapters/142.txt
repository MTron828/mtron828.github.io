Chapter 143: Another Three Moves (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

There was indeed such a rule in all the sects.

Should new disciples ask senior brothers and sisters for guidance, they could set a certain remuneration in exchange for a little teaching.

However…

How was Zhou Qu giving guidance?

It was clearly an arena he set up, yet he shamelessly worded it so nicely now.

Ultimately, he found such an excuse only because he was frustrated over losing the Xi Spirit Pills to Ye Qingtang.

At that point, there were significantly fewer people in the Rewards Pavilion. In the wide first floor, only Ye Qingtang and Zhou Qu remained. With the warden in charge of the missions currently on the third floor, no one could say anything even if Zhou Qu were to act arrogantly.

“Junior Sister Ye, I gave you guidance so kindly. It cannot be that you don’t even know about such manners?”

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes, and a smile extended on her lips. Lifting her chin slightly, she swept a look across Zhou Qu’s greedy face and said, “I wonder what kind of remuneration does Senior Brother Zhou want?’

Zhou Qu was rather satisfied at Ye Qingtang’s sensibility and said immediately, “You are a new disciple and don’t have anything else. I showed you the directions for three moves, and according to our initial betting chip on the arena, each move is worth four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills. I gave you guidance for three moves, so logically, you should give me twelve bottles of Xi Spirit Pills.”

Twelve bottles of Xi Spirit Pills?

Zhou Qu really had a large appetite!

Ye Qingtang scoffed, “Twelve bottles of Xi Spirit Pills. Are you joking, Senior Brother Zhou? How would I have twelve bottles of Xi Spirit Pills?”

Zhou Qu replied, “With the four bottles that you took out previously plus the ones I gave you, that will be eight bottles. I am also not a heartless person. You just need to return me seven bottles first, and you can return the remaining five bottles over five months with one bottle per month. Rest assured, I will leave one bottle for you to use yourself every month.”

Zhou Qu feigned magnanimous as though leaving one bottle for Ye Qingtang every month was already the greatest favor.

The smile on Ye Qingtang’s lips deepened, though the smile never reached her eyes. An evil expression faintly radiated in her eyes.

“Senior Brother Zhou, I am not an insensible person. However… if you want remuneration, you should show me some real abilities at the bare minimum. With just that little skill where I received the three moves on the arena, I’m afraid I’m unwilling to give you any.”

Zhou Qu initially thought that Ye Qingtang would obey wisely and did not think that she would twist her words. The smile on his face stiffened, and his sinister eyes narrowed.

“Know what is good for you, Ye Qingtang. I can’t even be bothered when others want me to give them guidance for even a move. Now that you made such a huge gain, you still want to deny it?” As he said, he clenched his fists which were hanging by his side, making a crisp sound which seemed like a threaten.

Ye Qingtang glanced over Zhou Qu’s fist, and her eyes turned cold.

“Senior Brother Zhou, courtesy demands reciprocity. If you can receive three moves from me, I’ll acknowledge your previous guidance. Not only will I pay you the remuneration for the previous three moves, but I’ll also add on another twelve bottles. How about it?” Ye Qingtang said smilingly.

Zhou Qu was taken aback instantly. The initial dissatisfaction was replaced by shock at this instant.

Was Ye Qingtang a fool?

At that instant, Zhou Qu really wanted to laugh. He merely wanted to get back what was his with interest and asked for twelve bottles of Xi Spirit Pills. How would he have thought that Ye Qingtang actually sought death herself and doubled the number of Xi Spirit Pills!
