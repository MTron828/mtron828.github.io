Chapter 363: Mission (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

This time, Ye Qingtang’s mission location was at the Floating Light Canyon, which was some distance away from Xuanling Sect. Traveling to and fro would take at least one month.

After making some preparations, the two of them set off immediately.

…

In the Floating Light Canyon, a few figures shuffled through the dense forest in a panic. They were dressed in the Xuanling Sect’s outer sect uniform, but at that instant, these sect disciples no longer had the arrogance and distinguished air around them as before, with dirt and wounds covering their bodies.

“The Wind Sword Sect people probably would not be able to catch up so quickly. Let’s take a rest for now.” A Xuanling Sect disciple panted. The dirt on his face could not cover his pale complexion.

The other people slowly stopped after hearing that, and they panted with an ugly expression. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The seven people were all Xuanling Sect’s outer sect disciples and had received a sect mission a month before. After heading to the Floating Light Canyon, the entire mission was completed relatively successfully. However, no one had expected that…

They would actually encounter an accident when they were about to return.

A pale Su Wan was in the team as well. She pursed her lips lightly and looked towards Lu Xiuwen, who was frowning and breathing unsteadily.

“Senior Brother Lu… will the people from the Wind Sword Sect still chase after us?”

Lu Xiuwen’s expression was very ugly at that moment. This was the first sect mission he accepted after recovering from the injury, yet unexpectedly… he was met with such a setback.

Then, Lu Xiuwen did not reply to Su Wan and rather looked at another disciple in the team.

That disciple was tall and handsome, but his expression was extremely ugly at that instant with wounds all over his body. It could be said that his injuries were the most severe amongst the seven of them.

“Qiao Mo, this incident started because of you. With things as such, shouldn’t you give us an explanation?” Lu Xiuwen threw his words coldly.

His voice attracted the attention of other people in the team.

The reason for having to go in hiding in the Floating Light Canyon so miserably was something done by that disciple called Qiao Mo.

“Junior Brother Lu, this was just an accident. Junior Brother Qiao did not wish for this either. Don’t say anymore already. What is most important right now is to flee from this place,” a disciple mediated.

Lu Xiuwen scoffed as he looked at the pale Qiao Mo. “Accident? If he did not offend the Wind Sword Sect disciples for nothing, why would they attack us? Furthermore, it was originally their own business, but he did not know what was good for him and had to join in. Now that he stirred up such a huge matter, why do we have to suffer together with him?”

Lu Xiuwen’s words were relatively harsh, and Qiao Mo’s expression turned even uglier.

The Wind Sword Sect and they usually stayed out of each other’s way. Nothing happened initially when they met, but Qiao Mo happened to see his fiancée in the group of Wind Sword Sect disciples. As the two groups passed by each other, he caught sight of the young lady joking with a Wind Sword Sect disciple flirtatiously, which infuriated him immediately. He reasoned with them, but both parties were angered as they argued and ended up in a physical brawl.

The number of Wind Sword Sect disciples was double of theirs, and when they fought, the seven people from Xuanling Sect naturally were not the Wind Sword Sect’s opponents. In the end, the Xuanling Sect disciples… were still unable to escape after being cornered in the Floating Light Canyon by the Wind Sword Sect disciples for days.
