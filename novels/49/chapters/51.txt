Chapter 52: The Second Elder (1)

Ye Qingtang was at a loss for a brief moment when she learned the news. Nonetheless, she rushed over to the stables the next instant and galloped headlong towards the training grounds on horseback.

In her past, Ye Ling lost his life on the night before the Second Elder’s return and while Ye Qingtang was still mourning her father’s death, the Great Elder took her to the training grounds against her will. Though she was still hopeful then, that the kind Second Elder would help her in tracking down her father’s murderer….

Once the Second Elder set foot outside his training chamber, the Great Elder had him arrested and executed for the murder of the head of the household.

Why….

The past Ye Qingtang was still wet behind the ears and totally oblivious to the situation. In her feebleness, the Great Elder’s ironclad verdict stupefied her. Even if she had intended to speak up for the Second Elder, the Great Elder would turn a blind eye. In the end, while being restrained at a side, the Second Elder was executed before her very eyes….

To this day, Ye Qingtang could still vividly remember the moment the Second Elder was killed.

After heaving a deep breath, Ye Qingtang cast away this recollection, whilst she galloped the horse at full speed.

She did not expect the Great Elder to bring his plans forward instead.

If memory serves, the Great Elder not only offered to receive the Second Elder personally, Ye Xun had even invited a few elders from the Duan household along at his behest. All that fanfare for the purpose of exterminating the Second Elder!

Ye Qingtang remained steadfast as she galloped away like the wind.

Quite a number of people had gathered at the training grounds of the Ye household, located beyond the City of Lin.

With hands behind his back and a cold glint in his eyes, the Great Elder kept his gaze on the stone door of the training chamber which remained firmly shut.

“Great Elder, the Second Elder should be coming out soon.” Ye Xun, who stood beside him, smiled as she spoke.

With a slight nod, the Great Elder turned his gaze towards Duan Tianrao, standing next to Ye Xun. As her fiancé, he and a few other Elders from the Duan household were invited to the trial where he would impeach the Second Elder for treachery against the Ye household.

The Second Elder was so formidable that even the Great Elder lacked the confidence to restrain him on his own. The presence of the other Elders from the Duan household served as a deterrent to reign him in and also, as an official jury to witness his indictment and subsequent execution, in order to appear righteous in the public eye.

However, the truth behind the crime was not important at all to the Duan household.

Ye You, after becoming a disciple of the Cloud-breakers’ sovereign, elevated the Great Elder’s status amongst the nobles and being on friendly terms with Ye Xun, their future First Lady, they were all willing to do him a favor.

“My apologies for having to impose upon you all and thank you again for accepting my invitation.” The Great Elder pronounced his gratitude to the Elders from the Duan household.

The Elders’ faces lit up with glee and one of them replied: “No worries. We stand by the same honor as one of City of Lin’s noble families. It’s our pleasure and obligation to extend a helping hand in times of need. Especially over matters like this for it’s for our own good as well. Hopefully, our actions today can help to deter any treachery amongst our families.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Great Elder broke into a smile as he lamented: “To think such a thing could happen in our household. Guess this is the price I’ve to pay for being complacent in my duties as the Great Elder.”

“Pardon me, but you’re too harsh on yourself, I reckon. Even as Great Elder, there are limits on the things you can control. You’re one of the victims who’ve nearly lost a life, thus clearly, you’re not in the wrong. Though you’re not in a rough shape, but those injuries are pretty apparent. I hope its not too serious?” One of the Elders asked out of concern.

“No worries, it’s just a scratch.” The Great Elder answered nonchalantly while he threw a glance at a carriage parked at the side. When he saw Ye Ling alighting from the carriage, he fixed his gaze on the stone door again without another word.
