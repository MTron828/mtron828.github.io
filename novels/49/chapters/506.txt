Chapter 507 Hunt Down (1)

Ye Qingtang did not use the Feather Formation Technique as the Yunxiao Sect disciples chased tightly behind her. If she flew right now, she would be too large of a target, and it would be very difficult for her to escape once they targeted her. Thus, she chose to travel by feet.

About an hour later, over ten young males appeared from nowhere and blocked Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder. “It is them!”

The leader was a girl in a loose white skirt, who scanned the portrait in her hand and compared it to Ye Qingtang.

“Hahaha! I didn’t think that my luck would be so good. We were just trying our luck randomly but really met Yunxiao Sect’s wanted person.”

The other young males looked at Ye Qingtang with burning eyes and guffawed loudly.

Yunxiao Sect had already promised the family clans in the surrounding cities that whoever captured or killed Ye Qingtang could head to Yunxiao Sect to receive a generous reward!

“We are from the Zhou family clan of Du City. You offended Yunxiao Sect and better go to Yunxiao Sect with us obediently to receive your punishment. If you dare to resist, I’ll behead you today!”

The girl in the lead declared with a sharp voice as she looked at Ye Qingtang.

“You have a death wish!” A glint flickered in Ye Qingtang’s eyes immediately.

The situation evoked memories of her past life. She had been cornered into an endless hunt for her life for a whole three hundred years and encountered such a circumstance like today’s countless times, and she barely escaped alive every time. The severe injuries that she sustained were innumerable…

“How dare you resist?!” The female leader shouted angrily. “I originally wanted to let you live, but since you don’t know how to appreciate my kindness, don’t blame us for being merciless!”

Afterward, the girl gave a look at the people surrounding her. Howevet…

Before these supposed family clan disciples from Du City could take any action, Ye Qingtang unsheathed the Demonic Blood Sword with a sharp “clang.”

The moment the Demonic Blood Sword left its sheath, a demonic air emerged. Immediately right after, a blood-colored sword shadow shot across perpendicularly and crosswise.

Puff! Poof!

Those family clan disciples from Du City did not even know what happened, but their heads had already parted from their bodies.

Then, numerous skulls were uniformly slain and strewn in the air by the Demonic Blood Sword. Large gushes of blood spouted out and dyed the ground crimson in an instant. “WHAT?!”

The leading girl and the few remaining young males were dumbfounded by the scene. The lingering warmth of their comrades’ blood still remained on their body.

“Run… Quickly run!” One of the males looked at Ye Qingtang as though she was a demon from hell. Astounded, terror filled his face.

They initially thought that they were extremely lucky and could head to Yunxiao Sect to receive their reward after capturing or killing her. Never had they expected that they actually provoked such a monster!

She already slaughtered so many people just by unsheathing her sword. How were family clan disciples like them able to compete with this level of skill?!

“Impossible!” The female leader no longer acted as imposing as before. She staggered backward, and her voice quivered. “Impossible! Yunxiao Sect said that the person to catch… is a Xuanling Sect disciple… How can a… mere Xuanling Sect disciple… have such scary skills!”

The female leader could brag that the people she brought today were not worse than disciples of ordinary sects and thus dared to block Ye Qingtang’s path. However, she never would have thought that Ye Qingtang’s skills were not those of ordinary sect disciples!

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang did not say anything as the Demonic Blood Sword landed.

Boom!

A blood-colored sword aura rushed into the sky like a fleeting shadow.

The bodies of those young disciples were chopped into pieces instantly.
