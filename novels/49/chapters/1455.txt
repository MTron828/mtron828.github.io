1456 Extermination 1

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang did not have any interactions with Jiang Lang and his wife in the Central Mainland and only knew that they slaughtered people mercilessly.

However, not long after Ye Qingtang reached the Central Mainland, the couple suddenly disappeared. She only happened to hear that the couple’s corpses were found in a desert mountain when she was about to leave the Central Mainland.

They had already died for many years when they were found, but their corpses were dried, and all their cultivation was completely devoured.

Jiang Lang and his wife committed many sins when they were alive, and no one collected their corpses even after they died. It was the Jiang Family that learned of the news a very long time later and hastily sent people to collect their corpses.

Ye Qingtang did not pay much attention then, but it was a little strange thinking about it now.

Given Mo Yi’s and Jiang Lang’s skills, how could they die without a sound?

Moreover, according to what the person who discovered the corpses said, there were no scars found, and there did not seem to be any fights before they died.

What kind of person could suck dry all of the couple’s cultivation without them laying a hand on the person…

A shocking guess flashed across Ye Qingtang’s mind suddenly.

Could it be that…

Their powers were devoured by the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline?!

Ye Qingtang was shocked by her own guess.

She did not meet the lady in green in her previous life, and the devouring bloodline was still on that lady while that lady was the biological daughter of Mo Yi and Jiang Lang. If not for the sudden change in this lifetime’s trajectory, perhaps that lady in green would return to the Jiang Family in the future and to the couple’s side.

If it was their biological daughter, Jiang Lang and his wife probably would not have their guard up against her…

Returning to her family, devouring her parents’ skills, and killing them…

Ye Qingtang increasingly found that these clues seem to corroborate with the couple’s death.

However, this was only her guess, and she did not know what exactly happened in her previous life.

Ye Qingtang did not have many feelings toward Jiang Lang and his wife in her previous life, but Mo Yi protected her so much today; Ye Qingtang had a heart as well, so how could she not be grateful? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Mo Yi was unaware of Ye Qingtang’s guesses and only let go of her reluctantly after hugging for a long time. Her motherly gaze scanned Ye Qingtang closely, and however she looked at her did not seem to be enough.

“Your father will like you as well if he sees you.”

“Father? Did he not return with you?” Ye Qingtang was a little curious as the couple was rumored to always be by each other’s side.

Mo Yi said with a smile, “Some tactless people annoyed your father, and he has to spend some time to massacre all of them. He told me to return first to look at you, and so I left first.”

Massacre all of them…

Ye Qingtang was silent.

Alright. A caring mother she was, but this kindness was only shown to her daughter.

This couple was still as heartless to others.

Mo Yi wanted to say something more, but she suddenly started coughing.

The demon fox servant hurriedly retrieved a medicine gourd from her space ring and handed it to Mo Yi.

Mo Yi received it and drank it. Ye Qingtang smelled a bitter medicinal scent that had a faint smell of blood.

“Mother, are you unwell?” Ye Qingtang noticed that Mo Yi’s complexion was very pale and that her breathing was much weaker than others. Mo Yi was unusually valiant when fighting Jiang Qin, and Ye Qingtang thought it was just a front, but now, it seemed that there really was a problem.
