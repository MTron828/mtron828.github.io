Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What’s going on? Ye Qingtang’s attack completely changed?” The onlooking disciples who were still in a state of shock finally returned to their senses, but what they saw caused their jaws to drop in astonishment again.

On the ring, Song Junqiu was forced to retreat with every move by Ye Qingtang. Protecting himself was already a problem, much less fighting back.

“Impossible! Song Junqiu is at stage three of the First Heaven and is only a step away from the Second Heaven. To win him, one must reach the realm of the Second Heaven…”

“Could it be that… Ye Qingtang is already at Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level One?!!”

Exclamations erupted in the crowd.

Is this a joke?

How long did Ye Qingtang enter the inner sect for?

Ten days ago, she was only at stage one of the First Heaven. On what basis could she advance three realms and reach the Second Heaven in such a short span of time?

She can’t be supernatural, can she!

While the disciples found these guesses hard to believe, the scene of Song Junqiu being overpowered fell into their eyes clearly, and they could only acknowledge their guesses however unwilling they were.

On the ring, Song Junqiu completely panicked. The three disciples had already died, and the smell of blood that diffused in the air provoked his nerves. Ye Qingtang was like a demon that crawled out from hell, and her every move was nothing but violent and simply not what he could block.

How could this be…

How could Ye Qingtang’s skills improve so greatly in such a short span of time!

Song Junqiu was truly flustered. At that instant, his previous insolence and arrogance were long gone. Large drops of sweat trickled down from his forehead continuously, and a chill ran through his body.

He was not Ye Qingtang’s opponent.

When this thought appeared in Song Junqiu’s mind, he was engulfed by an invisible fear. Goosebumps rose as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who was smiling sinisterly.

Ye Qingtang wanted to kill him!

Song Junqiu was so terrified that cold sweat trickled down profusely. He clearly felt Ye Qingtang’s intention to kill him.

Song Junqiu, who realized he was not Ye Qingtang’s opponent, was alarmed. He forced Ye Qingtang back two steps with difficulty with all his might, and using the time she was pushed back, he turned around and leaped down from the edge of the ring.

On the Life and Death Ring, death was determined by destiny.

To live, the only way was to flee from the ring. As long as he was off the ring, Ye Qingtang could no longer murder him!

Song Junqiu’s mind was madly filled with the thought of escaping for his life. At that very instant, he could no longer care about his reputation and dashed down the ring like a berserk dog. In the flurry, he suddenly saw the warden with whom he had friendly relations coincidentally passing by the ring and screamed shamelessly, “Warden Song, save me!”

Warden Song turned around at the sound and was astonished to see Song Junqiu fleeing from the ring in a panic. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

What was going on?

Previously, he did hear Song Junqiu mention that he was going to enter the ring with a disciple who just entered the inner sect. Since the opponent was only at stage one of the First Heaven, he was not concerned, yet unexpectedly…

Such a scene would actually play out before him.

As Song Junqiu called Warden Song for help, a glint shot straight towards him!

Song Junqiu was only one step away from leaving the ring, yet this one step could not be crossed no matter how!

The Demonic Blood Sword already pierced through his shoulder and locked him right on the pillar at the edge of the ring.
