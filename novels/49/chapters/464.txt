Immediately, Ye Qingtang opened her palms and revealed her spirit root in front of Yue Tiancheng cooperatively.

“Not bad… The aura of the spirit root indeed is that of one that has just upgraded.” Yue Tiancheng nodded.

Before waiting for Ye Qingtang to say anything, Yue Tiancheng frowned slightly. “That’s not right! The spirit root is only a yellow spirit root after an upgrade, which means that your previous spirit root is an orange spirit root?”

“Senior Brother Yue is right. I was an orange spirit root previously,” Ye Qingtang said honestly and naturally.

A cold glint flashed across Yue Tiancheng’s eyes when he heard her. “Then, do you know that Yunxiao Sect’s criteria for accepting disciples… is that they must at least be a green spirit root?”

“So Senior Brother Yue is suspecting me.” Ye Qingtang could not help but laugh. “You’re really overthinking, Senior Brother Yue. Who dares to pretend as a Yunxiao Sect disciple in the Formidable Heavens Dynasty? Moreover, I was able to enter Yunxiao Sect as an exception.”

“Exception? You’re talking rather big. Tell me what kind of exception that was then.” Yue Tiancheng’s interest was stirred. A harmless smile hung on his lips, though a deep murderous expression hid in the abyss of his eyes.

“Alright. Since you don’t believe me, take a good look then.” Ye Qingtang raised her arm and opened her palms.

Swoosh!

In a flash, a golden flame was dancing in Ye Qingtang’s palm as though it was the spirit of fire.

Looking at the golden flame in the palms of the stunning girl before him, Yue Tiancheng showed a surprised look on his face. “Paragon Skill?!”

The Ultimate Origin Skill had not appeared on this mainland for too long of a time, and there was not much difference between the Ultimate Origin Skill and the Paragon Skill. As a result, Yue Tiancheng mistook it, and Ye Qingtang was naturally confident of this.

“Understanding the Paragon Skill as a yellow spirit root… is pretty good but not enough for the sect to make an exception…” Yue Tiancheng mumbled.

“Senior Brother Yue, are you sure… I understood the Paragon Skill as a yellow spirit root?” Ye Qingtang’s face was full of smiles.

“Oh? So you mean…” Then, there was a change in Yue Tiancheng’s expression. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Yue Tiancheng suddenly recalled that Ye Qingtang already revealed the aura of her spirit root earlier on, and although it was a yellow spirit root, it did upgrade not long ago…

It was simply impossible for someone who had just upgraded to a yellow spirit root to understand the Paragon Skill in an instant!

“You… you understood the Paragon Skill as an orange spirit root?!” Yue Tiancheng returned to his senses and looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

This girl had just upgraded to a yellow spirit root, and there was no way she understood the Paragon Skill as a yellow spirit root. This meant that she understood it as an orange spirit root…

“Senior Brother Yue is intelligent. Exactly because of this, I was accepted into the sect as an exception,” Ye Qingtang said with a chuckle.

Yue Tiancheng finally returned to his senses after a long while. “Understanding the Paragon Skill as an orange spirit root… I’ve really not heard of it before. If that was the case, it is explainable why the sect made an exception.”

“You should believe me already, right?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“No hurry.” Yue Tiancheng continued. “Take out your Yunxiao Token.”

“Yunxiao token?” Ye Qingtang was stunned.

“Why? As a Yunxiao Sect disciple, did you not bring the Yunxiao token when you were out of the sect?” Yue Tiancheng asked.

“Why are you so distrustful, Senior Brother Yue? Why would I pretend to be a Yunxiao Sect disciple for nothing?” Ye Qingtang shook her head helplessly as she took out a token from her space ring.

This token was made from a special material, and a mystical cloud was carved on it. It definitely would not be an imitation.

“It indeed is the Yunxiao token…” After inspecting Ye Qingtang’s token carefully, Yue Tiancheng finally let down his guard completely.
