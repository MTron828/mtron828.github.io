“How did I know this? I should be asking you why you don’t even know something as basic as this?” The big yellow dog seemed to be even more confused.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched as if she wanted to say something, but she kept silent in the end. Should she know about this?

“This energy body is formed from resentment, fear, and death. The more energy there is, the more obvious the condensed energy body will be. This moon is nothing. If the energy body is a little bigger, it can even form the sun.”

“What is this energy body for?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

The big yellow dog stared at the energy body that resembled the moon in the sky and pondered for a long time. In the end, it said, “How would I know? This thing has many uses, and most of them are used by evil immortals.”

Evil immortals?

Ye Qingtang realized that she seemed to have no way to continue conversing with this big yellow dog. What were evil immortals?

“However, it’s so strange. This energy body is too weak. If it’s an evil immortal, I think it should be at least a hundred energy bodies in the form of the sun… Who knows what this is? It has nothing to do with me anyway,” the yellow dog continued. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Alright, let’s continue to find my students,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Continue to find? They’re all here.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

“We’re here?” Ye Qingtang was stunned. This place was barren and there was no one around.

“Where are they?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“They are in the palace up front,” the big yellow dog explained.

Palace?

Ye Qingtang scanned her surroundings. She did not even see a brick, much less a palace.

Almost subconsciously, Ye Qingtang took two steps back and kept a distance from the big yellow dog. If it became rabid, would it bite her again?

“What are you doing? Why are you moving away? Come here.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail when it saw Ye Qingtang stepping back.

“No need. Here is just fine,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“Let’s go into the palace to take a look.” The big yellow dog ignored Ye Qingtang and walked straight ahead. She saw the big yellow dog walk toward a patch of yellow sand and use its head to push hard at empty air. It looked like it was straining against something.

“Come on, why are you still standing there? Help me push open the palace door. I can’t move it,” the big yellow dog turned around and shouted at Ye Qingtang.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang forced a smile and could only agree as she walked forward carefully to the yellow dog.

“Come, I’ll give the signal and we’ll push at the same time,” the big yellow dog said.

Ye Qingtang, “Alright…”

“Chicken leg, beef bone!” As it spoke, the yellow dog pushed against the air with all its might.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. What kind of signal was that?

Touching the air in front of her, Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but feel doubtful. Indeed… it was air. It was not some palace that was invisible. How was there a palace here? Wasn’t it just empty air?!

“Strange… Why isn’t it moving at all…” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang.” Are you pushing at all?! That’s why it can’t be opened!”

“Alright, I’m doing it now.” Ye Qingtang smiled awkwardly and pushed forward.

Ye Qingtang seemed to be pushing with all her strength. She then said to the dog, “This door is so sturdy. I can’t push it either. Why don’t… we find another palace? Look, there’s another palace in front. Let’s push the one over there..”
