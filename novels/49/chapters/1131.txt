Chapter 1132: This Is Impossible (1)

Since that was the case, Ye Qingtang stopped thinking about it and took out a pill from her space ring to consume. In a few breaths’ time, her complexion was finally better.

Currently, Han Cangming and Blood Moon Holy Lord were fighting outside the city, and she was pretty safe in the meantime. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ye Qingtang first looked at the demonic creature and then at the Blood Moon Elder…

When Blood Moon Elder refused to carry out the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s orders earlier on, Ye Qingtang was a little touched.

Ye Qingtang immediately looked at the Blood Moon Elder and spoke.

“Oh right… Didn’t you want to possess a male powerful figure… There is one here… Time is limited. You must hurry.”

Blood Moon Elder was stunned after hearing Ye Qingtang, and he followed Ye Qingtang’s gaze.

His lips twitched when he saw that the person that Ye Qingtang was pointing to was actually the demonic creature on the ground.

Was she freaking kidding?!

Although he was a woman currently, he was at least a human… Now, he could not even be a human anymore?!

What the hell is this thing? Can it be possessed?!

“Holy Lady… this place is not safe to stay for long. Let’s retreat quickly!” Blood Moon Elder held onto Ye Qingtang and wanted to leave without uttering a word about the possession, acting as though he did not hear Ye Qingtang at all.

“If this demonic creature… returned back to the outside world… It is at least in the Arcane Supremacy realm… It may even be in the Heavenly Venerate realm… In addition, it has perfect defense and strength…” Ye Qingtang mumbled as though she was talking to herself.

Blood Moon Elder immediately stopped in his tracks, and he looked at Ye Qingtang after thinking for a while. “Holy Lady, it’s not important whether it is powerful or not. The main thing is that I like this body as it is very manly and domineering. I like it.”

However, before Ye Qingtang could continue to speak, a blood-colored shadow suddenly leaped towards them and appeared beside Ye Qingtang in a flash.

“Younger brother…”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply as she looked at the Blood Moon Holy Lord, who was inches away.

Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at Ye Qingtang coldly as though he had no emotion.

In the next second, Blood Moon Holy Lord’s overpowering aura instantly enshrouded Ye Qingtang.

“What… are you doing this for?” Ye Qingtang asked under the pressure of the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s overwhelming aura.

Ye Qingtang believed things should not be as such between her and the Blood Moon Holy Lord and was all the more unclear why he wanted to kill her.

“Instead of facing suffering and misery in the future, why not just die earlier?” The Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at Ye Qingtang and said coldly.

Ye Qingtang was slightly shaken. What was the meaning behind those words…

“Holy Lord, please pardon Holy Lady!”

Suddenly, Blood Moon Elder kneeled beside Blood Moon Holy Lord.

However, Blood Moon Holy Lord did not spare him an eye.

“Don’t blame me.”

Blood Moon Holy Lord raised his right arm, and a blood-colored bolt of lightning emerged in his palm.

However, before the Blood Moon Holy Lord could take any action, the Blood Moon Elder suddenly grabbed the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s legs.

“Holy Lady… quickly run!”

The Blood Moon Elder turned to look at Ye Qingtang and shouted loudly.

Then, the Blood Moon Holy Lord looked askance at the Blood Moon Elder and enshrouded him in his boundless aura.

“Quick… Holy Lady… Quickly escape!” Blood Moon Elder saw that Ye Qingtang did not react and shouted again.
