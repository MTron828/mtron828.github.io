Chapter 161: Giant Lizard (1)

Gu Yanqiu initially thought it was unsuitable, but he could not say anything after Meng Sheng’s words. As the initiator of the mission, he could not be biased. If he was suspected of protecting Ye Qingtang in the battle, then Ye Qingtang would really be like what Meng Sheng said—not only could she not help, she would become the burden of the entire team.

Hesitating, Gu Yanqiu looked at Ye Qingtang and asked, “Junior Sister Ye, are you sure?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

Gu Yanqiu had no choice and could only change Qin Huan’s position and place Ye Qingtang along with two other disciples in charge of directing the other Giant Lizards away.

Confirming the plan, the team immediately entered the Giant Rock Canyon.

Once they entered, everyone began directing their energy to isolate the heat.

Between the crimson stones, one could faintly see that bones were scattered everywhere, and small beasts passed by their eyes from time to time.

Under the high temperature and the intense heat waves, it was still impossible to completely isolate the heat from their body even with the circulating energy in them. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Everyone was already soaked in sweat after just a while.

Only Ye Qingtang and Qin Huan were fine as before. While their faces were a little red, they did not break out in sweat.

In the Giant Rock Canyon, there were demonic beasts other than the Giant Lizard hidden. Everyone’s footsteps were light in order to reduce the sound of their movement to the lowest possible. According to the map given, they slowly neared the lair of the Giant Lizard.

The Giant Lizard’s lair was a cave made from a messy mound of rocks. Tiny corpse fragments and some decomposed flesh could be faintly seen above the surrounding crushed rocks.

“It should be here,” said Gu Yanqiu as he narrowed his eyes while checking the decomposed flesh and crushed bones with tooth marks on the ground.

A pungent rotting odor traveled out from the cave.

Gu Yanqiu gave a hand sign, instructing everyone to go to their respective places.

He stood outside the cave and threw in a lighted matchstick that he prepared long ago into the lair.

The glowing matchstick flew into the pitch-black lair. When it flew past, one could see bones and decomposing carcasses strewn all over the place. The rotting flesh was being roasted by the hot rocks, releasing a pungent odor.

A crisp sound traveled out from the cave.

Everyone held their breaths and focused.

In the next second, swishing sounds could be heard.

“Retreat!” Gu Yanqiu ordered sternly and immediately pulled a distance.

The moment he retreated, a dense black shadow suddenly swarmed out from the cave!

Suddenly, dozens of Giant Lizards of varying sizes gushed out from the cave at once. The smallest one amongst them was about the size of a wolf while larger ones were that of an old bull. Every Giant Lizard had a thick and heavy armor on them, and while they had short limbs, their speed was abnormally fast on these rocks.

“So many of them!” Everyone was shocked upon seeing the number of Giant Lizards.

The group of them, which originally thought there were only around ten Giant Lizards in the lair, had an ugly expression at that moment.

Before they could take the next move, the ground beneath them suddenly trembled.

An enormous figure slowly came out of the lair.

It was a Giant Lizard of unparalleled size. Standing at almost four to five meters tall, its huge and bloody mouth was half open. Between the rows of sharp teeth, its split tongue drooped halfway down. As it breathed out, everyone’s faces were greeted with an awfully pungent odor.
