Ye Qingtang smiled and brought the silver wolf into her room after the servant left. She introduced Fei Ying and Ni Shang to the silver wolf.

Fei Ying was obsessed with the appearance of the silver wolf, but Ni Shang was a little intimidated. However, the silver wolf did not seem to be aggressive. Instead… it seemed to be ignoring them and stood beside Ye Qingtang.

“Young Lady, what’s the name of your silver wolf?” Fei Ying blinked his eyes and asked.

Ye Qingtang was stunned by Fei Ying’s question and then realized…

She did not even remember to name the silver wolf after so long.

She touched her chin and stared at the silver wolf. “Hmm, I did not think of that. How about… Snow?”

“…”

“Wang Cai?”

“…”

“Xiao Guai?”

“…”

Ye Qingtang ignored how stiff the silver wolf was. She slapped her leg and said, “Xiao Guai will do!”

“…”

Fei Ying and Ni Shang were stunned as they witnessed their young lady’s ability of naming…

However, at least Xiao Guai was slightly better than Wang Cai…

Both of them were glad that their names were given by the sect. If their young lady were to name them… it would be…

Horrible!

Ye Qingtang was satisfied with the name “Xiao Guai.” She completely ignored the reaction of the silver wolf and called the name repeatedly.

Fei Ying and Ni Shang thought that if the silver wolf could talk, it would be totally speechless by the name “Xiao Guai.”

Fei Ying removed the dressing table according to Ye Qingtang’s request and moved in the soft mattress.

Ni Shang placed a box on the table. There were ten bottles of elixirs in the box.

“Young Lady, these are your assigned Soul Condensation Pills.”

Ye Qingtang released her hand from the silver wolf slowly. She raised her brows as she stared at the ten bottles of Soul Condensation Pills.

The usage of the Soul Condensation Pills was the same as the Xiling Elixirs given by the outer sect, but it was much more effective. One bottle of the Soul Condensation Pills was worth three hundred Xuanming points. Even if the outer sect disciples wanted to purchase that, they did not have the ability to do so.

However, every inner sect disciple could receive ten bottles every month.

From the perspective of elixirs, the inner sect disciples received three thousand Xuanming points more than the outer sect disciples.

Ye Qingtang stared at the Soul Condensation Pills to figure out how long they could sustain her. However, the gate of the yard was kicked open violently. The loud sound exploded beside her eyes.

Ye Qingtang raised her head and saw…

A few disciples with inner sect clothes wandered into her yard.

The first disciple was Song Junqiu who had an argument with her on the center of the spring at Lingxi River the other day.

Fei Ying and Ni Shang were shocked by the few inner sect disciples. They panicked and looked towards Ye Qingtang. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

“Junior Sister Ye, how are you doing recently? How fortunate it is that we meet again.” Song Junqiu walked into her room, and his mouth tilted.
