Chapter 295: Qualification (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Qingtang, you played quite a huge role in the Deer City incident, and handing in the Revolving Soul Orb is also a big contribution to the sect. Thus, the sect has decided to award you with fifty thousand Xuanming points,” Elder Qin said with a smile.

Fifty thousand Xuanming points?!

Delight filled her when she heard this number.

The hundreds of Xuanming points she had on hand was already a huge asset in the outer sect. Thousands of Xuanming points… was simply a massive amount in the outer sect!

Although Ye Qingtang was elated, she still did not forget her goal for heading to Deer City. She immediately suppressed her happiness and said, “I am very happy to receive a reward from the sect. However, I have a request to make, and I am unsure whether you will approve of it.”

“Oh? What is it?” Elder Qin asked curiously.

Ye Qingtang replied. “I wish to participate in the inner sect assessment which takes place half a month from now.”

After Elder Qin heard Ye Qingtang’s words, the smile on his face vanished in shock.

“You want to participate in the inner sect assessment which takes place half a month from now?”

Astonishment was written all over Elder Qin’s face. Although he felt that Ye Qingtang had a good nature, she was ultimately only a new disciple with a red spirit root. She had only entered Xuanling Sect for a few months and probably did not have a solid foundation in the outer sect, yet she wanted to take part in Xuanling Sect’s inner sect assessment?

Was she insane?

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied firmly.

There was a huge difference between the inner and outer sect, and only by entering the inner sect would she be able to narrow her distance with Ye You.

Right before Zhou Qu died, he already pointed out that Ye You colluded with Xuanling Sect’s inner sect disciple, Ning Luo, to kill her. If she wasted any more time with the outer sect disciples, she would never be able to exact revenge on Ye You!

Elder frowned slightly and had a look of disapproval.

“Ye Qingtang, although your spirit root is inferior, you are rather intelligent. With your nature, you would still need to practice for years to enter the inner sect. Even if I make an exception and allow you to participate in the inner sect assessment now, there is probably not much meaning. Why don’t you think about it again?”

Elder Qin really thought highly of Ye Qingtang, but he still thought it was risky to take such rash actions.

However, Ye Qingtang shook her head insistently.

“I don’t have any other requests. I only wish for a chance to participate in the assessment.”

Elder Qin never expected Ye Qingtang to be this stubborn and sighed helplessly. “As a new disciple in the outer sect, you basically have no qualifications to take part in this year’s inner sect assessment. If you really want to, there is also a way as well. However, you must use thirty thousand Xuanming points to exchange for a qualification to participate. You must think carefully. If you really want to enter the inner sect, you can wait another year, and you will not need to spend this thirty thousand Xuanming points.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Elder Qin tried to persuade her kindly. Thirty thousand Xuanming points was not a small amount. If Ye Qingtang was willing to give up on the inner sect assessment this time, she could save thirty thousand Xuanming points and use them to exchange for other items, as well as make great improvements in this one year.

“I have thought about it clearly. Please exchange it for me, Elder Qin.”

Elder Qin’s lips twitched slightly. He had seen a stubborn person before but never one this stubborn.?This girl is too willful!

“Forget it. Since you’re so insistent on this, I will not persuade you anymore. However, since you wish to participate in this year’s assessment, you must start preparing as quickly as possible. There is a Spirit Consonance River in the sect. If you really want to stake everything on this attempt, you can exchange some points for a few hours of usage rights in the Spirit Consonance River. It is rich in spirit energy, which can accelerate your cultivation, and will be suitable for you.”
