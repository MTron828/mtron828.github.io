Chapter 828 Miss… Ye Chen?

The little white tiger could not hold itself back and interrupted Master Du. “She is Ye Chen. This is how she looks like in the first place.”

“This lady is Brother Ye Chen?!”

Master Du sized up the lady before him in disbelief. No matter how he looked, the two of them were definitely not the same person.

“You said you are Brother Ye Chen?”

Master Du stared at Ye Qingtang and asked.

“Master Du, indeed, it is me.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Nonetheless, Master Du shook his head and said, “I don’t believe you.”

Ye Chen was male, but the person before him was female, and even their appearances were completely different. How would Master Du believe it easily?

“Since that’s the case, may I know what I should do for you to believe me?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“That’s not difficult. As long as you recover Brother Ye Chen’s appearance, I will believe you,” Master Du said.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. There seemed to be no difference between saying that and not.

“There’s no need to go through such trouble.” Ye Qingtang raised her arm slowly. When she turned her palm over, a golden flame appeared in her palms like a dancing fairy.

Master Du was astonished when he saw the golden flame. Wasn’t this Ye Chen’s Extraordinary Flame…

When he saw Ye Qingtang’s Extraordinary Flame, he finally believed the lady before his eyes was Ye Chen.

All Extraordinary Flames had their own differences. In this world, each Extraordinary Flame was unique, and even if there were two similar types, there would still be a slight difference. However, the Extraordinary Flame that Ye Qingtang displayed was exactly the same as Ye Chen’s.

“Brother Ye Chen, why did you become a girl?” Master Du asked, flabbergasted.

“To tell you the truth, I was originally a female but became Ye Chen because of some needs.” Ye Qingtang explained.

Master Du nodded. “So do I call you Brother Ye Chen or Miss Ye Chen from now on?”

“Uh…” Ye Qingtang did not know what to say for the moment. Ultimately, she could only reply helplessly. “You can call me whatever you like, Master Du.”

“Alright,” Master Du said. “Brother Ye Chen, let’s head to the Dragon Vein right now.”

Ye Qingtang had no objections to that. According to their initial agreement, they were supposed to head to the Dragon Vein yesterday. However, Xuanyuan Yi appeared midway, and they were already late by half a day.

Very quickly, Master Du went back to the inner hall to make his preparations and briefed Du Sheng on some things before returning to the outer hall again.

“Xiao Guai.”

Ye Qingtang called when she saw that the silver wolf was still sleeping.

The silver wolf opened its eyes instantly after hearing that. It scanned its surroundings with a fierce gaze and bared its fangs, only keeping it once it saw Ye Qingtang.

“Let’s not bring this burden,” the little white tiger said.

“That’s right. Brother Ye Chen, the Dragon Vein is extremely dangerous. From what I see, it’s better for your pet wolf to stay at my place,” Master Du said.

However, under Ye Qingtang’s persistent requests, the silver wolf still followed Ye Qingtang and was on the road together with the rest.

Master Du and Ye Qingtang walked out of the Bliss Forging Workshop with the silver wolf and little white tiger, and they headed out of Nine Nights Dynasty’s monarch city.

The Dragon Vein was very far away from the Nine Nights Dynasty monarch city, and with the speed of the two people, they still required a few days to reach. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Half a day later, they were already far from Nine Nights Dynasty. They passed a post house, where Master Du bought two horses to use as their means of transportation.

However, before Ye Qingtang got on the horse, the silver wolf tugged on her clothes with its claws.

“What is it, Xiao Guai?” Ye Qingtang looked at the silver wolf and asked.

The silver wolf howled and crouched on the ground immediately.

“It wants you to ride on it,” the little white tiger said.
