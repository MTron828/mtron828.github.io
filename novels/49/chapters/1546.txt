Chapter 1547 A Great Support 3

Tuoba Yao was currently away from the Jiang house. Everyone present was a member of the Jiang Family, and no one dared to stop Jiang Yu after he had spoken.Jiang Qin had fallen into a dead faint before the hundred strokes were over. The men meting out the punishment did not dare to stop. They continued until they had given the full one hundred strokes.

After the punishment was over, Jiang Qin was barely breathing, and it seemed as if she was about to die.

Ye You and Jiang Shun, who were watching from the sidelines, were horrified. Jiang Shun was secretly rejoicing that he had not spoken just now; otherwise, he would be the one that was being beaten half to death.

“Throw her into the Cliff of Reflection.” Jiang Yu’s expression did not flicker. He simply ordered the men to bring Jiang Qin to the Cliff of Reflection.

Everyone obeyed.

Ye You watched as the men carried Jiang Qin away, still dripping with blood. She was so frightened, her legs were shaking.

She had thought that Ye Qingtang would certainly die this time. She did not expect this turn of events.

Not only had Ye Qingtang survived, but Ye You’s biggest source of support, Jiang Qin, had been heavily injured and thrown into the Cliff of Reflection for an indeterminate length of time.

“Everyone can get up,” Jiang Yu said sternly, and his gaze swept over them.

Only then did everyone arise.

“Did you say that this girl tried to kill her family members?” Jiang Yu changed the subject now that the evil-mouthed person had been dealt with.

Although he had not returned to the Jiang Family for a long time, he was very pleased with Ye Qingtang, whom he had met recently.

If not for Ye Qingtang, he would still be trapped in the forbidden place, waiting for many years until the Age Reversal Curse wore out.

“... I only suspect...” Everyone had just seen Jiang Qin suffer a terrible beating and did not dare to be too adamant.

They had heard Jiang Qi say that Jiang Yu had returned with Ye Qingtang, so those who had been accusing Ye Qingtang did not dare to spout nonsense any longer.

“Ah, of the people who went to the Land of Infinite Demons with you, who entered the forbidden land and saw her kill someone?” Jiang Yu asked with a cold smile.

“No one.” Jiang Shun and Jiang Shangyu gathered up their courage to reply.

“I don’t know why my Jiang Family members currently enjoy maligning people. All of you are truly becoming more and more capable...” Although Jiang Yu was smiling as he spoke, his cold tone sent chills down everyone’s spines.

Jiang Shun and the others broke out in a cold sweat. They felt a vague sense of unease.

“None of you entered the forbidden land, but I did. I met this girl in the forbidden land. As for those Jiang Family members, I saw their bodies with my own eyes. The injuries on their bodies were clearly caused by bites from the Demonic Bears. What does it have to do with her?”

Ye Qingtang had saved Jiang Yu. He naturally wanted to repay her.

Also, every word he spoke was absolutely true.

How could he watch them malign and frame Ye Qingtang?

The moment Jiang Yu spoke, Jiang Shun’s and the others’ expressions turned ugly.

No wonder Jiang Yu had said that he was the proof when he appeared!

But Jiang Shun quickly recovered and said, “Since the Domain Monarch Founder witnessed it personally, of course, Ye Qingtang will be cleared of all charges. I felt that Jiang Qin’s speculations were too nebulous. Fortunately, the Domain Monarch Founder was present, so we will not have any misunderstandings with Ye Qingtang.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

A wise man knew which way the wind was blowing. Jiang Shun had no wish to follow Jiang Qin’s footsteps.

Everyone nodded eagerly. After all, considering the Domain Monarch’s status, he had no reason to shield a junior. Of course, no one would doubt his word.

Jiang Lang and his wife were delighted that Jiang Yu had provided evidence. However, they were curious as to how Ye Qingtang had met the Domain Monarch Founder.
