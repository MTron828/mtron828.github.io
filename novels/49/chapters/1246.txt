Chapter 1247: Birthday Celebration (3)

Luo Feng spoke coldly.

“After today, our Luo Family will reach its peak. The Temple of Shadows was the supreme power in Central Mainland, but starting from tomorrow, our Luo Family will rewrite history.”

Luo Qi nodded hard. Then, he put a smile on his face and went to entertain the guests.

No one noticed the conversation between the two brothers.

Ye Qingtang was sitting on a chair, maintaining a “Holy Lord-like smile” on her face. No one came over to chat with her, perhaps because of her status as the Holy Lord, and Ye Qingtang relaxed a little.

But before she could relax completely, she suddenly felt a piercing gaze fall on her.

Before Ye Qingtang could determine the source of that gaze, a figure suddenly appeared in front of her.

“Holy Lord of Shadows, it’s been a long time since we last met.” A suave old man was looking at Ye Qingtang through hooded eyes.

Although the old man’s words seemed courteous, his tone was filled with hatred. He looked at Ye Qingtang as if he would like to flay her alive.

More than twenty people followed behind the old man. Some were old, and some were young, but all of them were dressed alike, with a soaring eagle embroidered on their chests.

Ye Qingtang took one look and received a jolt.

This old man was the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect, and Ye Qingtang had known him in her previous life. The Yunying Sect was one of the super sects in Central Mainland and was extremely powerful. This Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect was a force to be reckoned with. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang had merely heard rumors of the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect in her previous life but had not met him in person. However, she knew how powerful he was.

At any other time, Ye Qingtang would not think much of meeting the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect.

But now…

She was meeting the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect in her capacity as the Holy Lord of Shadows.

One must know that…

Thousands of years ago, when the Temple of Shadows was at its peak, the Holy Lord of Shadows had killed the Yunying Sect Grand Elder’s entire clan. Only the young Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect had survived.

After that, the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect had sworn vengeance on the Holy Lord of Shadows. He had entered the Yunying Sect, and with his immense natural talent, his capabilities had advanced rapidly.

However…

Before the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect could return from his studies and seek vengeance on the Holy Lord of Shadows, the latter had vanished…

Ye Qingtang had not expected that her luck would be so bad as to run into the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect here!!

However…

Although Ye Qingtang’s heart was racing, she had no choice but to keep her cool in front of the Undead. She maintained her faint smile, calmly swept a look at the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect, and spoke.

“Who are you?”

Her casual tone seemed to completely ignore the hatred in the eyes of the Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect.

At that moment, the Branch Master of the Temple of Shadows was secretly observing Ye Qingtang’s reaction.

“I’m not surprised that the Holy Lord of Shadows does not recognize me. When you personally slaughtered the thousand-plus members in my Yun Clan, I doubt you expected anyone to survive… For thousands of years, I have spent every moment longing for vengeance. And now, you have finally appeared!” The Grand Elder of the Yunying Sect’s eyes were filled with contempt. He was so filled with rage that he smiled instead.
