Chapter 2092: Soul-Absorbing Stage (2)

Elder Bai shook his head. “Even if she’s not powerful, she’s a clone of our Holy Lord. Our Holy Lord already instructed us to send her to the Soul-Absorbing Stage once we found her. This is an order, we have to abide by it.”

Once he said that, with a light wave of an arm, Ye Qingtang was pushed into the Soul-Absorbing Stage.

The moment she entered the Soul-Absorbing Stage, the light balls started moving. They started surrounding the Soul-Absorbing Stage, forming lightning bolts to strike Ye Qingtang.

She was doomed...

After all she had been through, Ye Qingtang had never expected herself to just die like that after a rebirth.

Elder Bai stood beside the Soul-Absorbing Stage and he just watched as the lightning surrounded Ye Qingtang. He was waiting for this clone to disappear. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang thought that it would hurt badly once the lightning struck her.

But...

She quickly noticed that...

It didn’t seem to hurt.

Although the lightning seemed terrifying as it struck at her, it was strange. She thought that it would hurt terribly but she didn’t feel a thing. In fact, the breeze brushing across her would be even more noticeable than this lightning.

“...” Ye Qingtang had a complicated expression.

From what they said earlier, they seemed to not have utilized the Soul-Absorbing Stage for a very long time.

Was it faulty?

Elder Bai hadn’t noticed yet. He just thought that Ye Qingtang wasn’t struggling because she was restricted by the gold chains.

But...

Time passed.

Ye Qingtang stood in the middle of the Soul-Absorbing Stage and nothing seemed to be happening, different from what they had expected. It appeared that she wasn’t the least bit tortured.

“Elder Bai... why is there no reaction?” the young man was puzzled.

Elder Bai’s brows knitted and he didn’t say a word.

After some time, even after the lightning stuck multiple times, she remained unfazed. Seeing this, Elder Bai’s expression darkened.

“Why is it like that? The Soul-Absorbing Stage would never go faulty.”

The Soul-Absorbing Stage was personally built by the Holy Lord. It had never had issues ever since the Temple of Paragon was built.

But now, the unthinkable had happened.

Elder Bai could somehow sense that something went wrong. Noticing that Ye Qingtang wasn’t affected by the Soul-Absorbing Stage at all, he lifted his arm and dragged Ye Qingtang out from the Soul-Absorbing Stage.

“Return to the main hall.” Elder Bai’s voice was cold and the next moment, white light appeared beside his feet.

Ye Qingtang only saw some white light flash and when she opened her eyes, she was back in the main hall again. Elder Bai stood beside her, with a solemn expression on his face.

“Elder Bai, why haven’t you killed this clone yet?” the same voices rang in the empty hall.

They seemed to be puzzled when they realized that Ye Qingtang hadn’t been disposed of.

Their voices were filled with displeasure.

“I put her on the Soul-Absorbing Stage and she stood there for an entire hour without even losing a strand of hair,” Elder Bai reported with a cold expression on his face.

Once he said that the entire main hall fell silent.

After some time, a ray of red light appeared on the wall of the main hall. A tall figure suddenly came out of one of the portraits hanging on the wall.
