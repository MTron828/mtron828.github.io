Chapter 573 Hell of Avicinaraka (4)

Seeing the two people escape, the Buddha statue finally moved its legs.

Boom!

Boom, boom!!

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM!!

The entire city rocked with every step the Buddha statue took as it chased after Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Those tall, strange buildings crumbled into nothingness in succession under the heartless trampling of the Buddha statue. Shattering sounds rang repeatedly.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder had already fled to thousands of meters away.

However, that Buddha statue was very fast as well. In just a while, the distance between it and Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder was already less than a hundred meters.

The sinister laughs behind caused one’s blood to run cold.

An extremely intense smell of death filled this small city that was enshrouded by the blood-colored moonlight.

Even Ye Qingtang was completely drenched in cold sweat.

The Buddha statue at the back was already probably consumed with desire. Perhaps, the monsters produced in this Hell of Avicinaraka devoured any living things.

At this moment, the vajra in the Buddha statue’s hand was thrown at Ye Qingtang.

Swoosh!

A piercing sound resounded throughout the entire place.

The vajra was extremely fast and had a powerful force.

Ye Qingtang’s brows were tightly furrowed as she felt the evil force surging towards her like a flood from a burst dam.

“Holy Lady… Careful!”

The Blood Moon Elder shouted, alarmed.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang unsheathed the Demonic Blood Sword without thinking.

All the Blood Moon Elder saw was the Demonic Blood Sword in Ye Qingtang’s hand slashing at the huge vajra.

Boom!

There was a deafening rumble!

The Demonic Blood Sword and the vajra clashed for a second and separated.

Ye Qingtang’s complexion paled from that one clash, and the qi and blood in her body surged. She

retreated back multiple steps. Thankfully, the Blood Moon Elder’s eyes and hands were quick, and he caught Ye Qingtang, which finally steadied her body.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were cold while the arm that wielded the sword trembled slightly. Fresh blood dripped down from where she held the sword.

“Holy Lady, you’re injured!”

The Blood Moon Elder was rather frantic to see Ye Qingtang’s injury.

After all, this mystic realm was of Hundred Level Peril. Not mentioning Ye Qingtang, even the powerful elder of Lingyun Sect died, having his skull completely consumed by that Buddha statue.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was injured, the Buddha statue’s angry eyes landed on her as the statue let out an extremely sinister laugh.

The Buddha statue’s right arm slowly reached into its chest and took out another head.

“That is…”

Ye Qingtang was appalled.

“Li Chenfeng!” The Blood Moon Elder yelled in fear. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Didn’t the head that the Buddha statue held onto right now belong to the youngest internal affairs elder of Yunxiao Sect, Li Chenfeng…

The pair of furious eyes met with Ye Qingtang’s eyes. The Buddha statue slowly placed Li Chenfeng’s skull into its mouth and gently chewed on it. Strange sounds could be heard as fresh blood and minced flesh flowed out of its lips.

“Run!”

Suddenly awoken, Ye Qingtang grabbed the Blood Moon Elder who was still rooted to the ground, dumbstruck, and fled out of the city.

The scariness of that Buddha statue was already beyond logical; so powerful was it that it raised one’s heckles.

Every corner of this blood-colored city was creepy and ghastly. The acrid smell of blood in the air intensified gradually.
