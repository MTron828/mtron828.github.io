Chapter 2377: Desperate From His Losses (2)

Xing Rong quietly took a deep breath. His face was very dark and malevolent.

The thought of losing had never crossed his mind. All he knew now was that he could not afford to lose his spirit jades.

How could he let those Netherworld Academy folks take away his spirit jades!

Xing Rong composed himself and put up a calm front. “What? Don’t you know the rules of the Inter-Academy Competition?”

Lei Yan and the others frowned. This was their first time here and had no idea of the rules.

Xing Rong narrowed his eyes before smiling. “Inside Universe City, chess gambling is tolerated between students, but academy teachers, wardens and other such personnel are not allowed to participate. If I tell those in charge of the Inter-Academy Competition about this teacher participating in chess gambling, he will probably be kicked out of Universe City.”

Xing Rong was speaking the truth. The various academies turned a blind eye toward those chess matches between students with spirit jades. After all, everyone wished their own students would win more spirit jades.

But apart from students, no one else was allowed to participate.

However, rules were rigid, while people were flexible. In reality, quite a number of teachers also took part in chess gambling in Universe City. As long as both parties came to an agreement, everyone would turn a blind eye.

No one would be foolish enough to report a match which both parties agreed to.

But now, Xing Rong was going to be the first person to tattle.

The spectators realized that Xing Rong must be desperate from his losses. Those teenagers who used to respect Xing Rong now started to look at him with disdain.

It was clear that Xing Rong had agreed to the match. Now that he had lost so terribly, he was suddenly going back on his word. But as disgusted as the crowd was, no one wanted to get involved in this messy situation.

“Xing Rong, you are purposely trying to stir up trouble, right?! Why didn’t you say so earlier if you knew of this rule?” Hang Wenwei retorted with a frown. He couldn’t stand this anymore.

Xing Rong was clearly a sore loser.

After seeing Ye Qingtang take out the Grand Master-level elixir, he had immediately assented. But now that he had lost, he was dragging out rules to hinder them.

Xing Rong knew how the crowd was looking at him now. But he did not care anymore.

He sneered. “Rules are rules. If you don’t wish to have your teacher kicked out of Universe City and miss out on the competition, hand over my two spirit jades. I can see that you are very close to him. I guess that he is the teacher who will lead your team in the team competition? If he is kicked out of Universe City at this crucial point, I am afraid your team will lose even more terribly than anticipated.”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flashed after hearing Xing Rong’s words, but her face remained impassive. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Xing Rong, you are so shameless!” Lei Yan was enraged.

Even a fool could see that Xing Rong was just being a sore loser and purposely trying to stir trouble.

Just as Lei Yan and the others were getting ready to fight it out with Xing Rong, a low voice rang out in a chiding tone.

“Xing Rong, shut up.”

Xing Rong stiffened at that voice. His blustering arrogance was instantly dispelled. Lifting his head, he looked toward the source of the voice.

A middle-aged man and a handsome youth weaved their way through the crowd.

“T-Teacher…” Xing Rong was petrified by the sight of the middle-aged man.
