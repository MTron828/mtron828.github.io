Chapter 1356 So Weak 1

The world here was totally different from the one Ye Qingtang was in previously. Though it was full of spirit energy, people here did not know how to make use of it besides knowing how to perform some basic fighting moves. Ye Qingtang changed her identity, but her capability and strength remained the same. She was not sure how much difference there was between her and the people in this world. It was lucky that she could test it out in the General’s residence today.

However…

Ye Qingtang really felt that… they were as weak as the ants when she stared at the servants lying on the ground.

The cultivators in this world are all so weak?

They could not even compare with the most inferior Connate Level Five people in her world…

Everyone else in the hall froze as they saw the servants falling onto the ground.

They could not understand how these people fell onto the ground as no one seemed to have done anything. Of course, they would not know that it was the result of Ye Qingtang’s power.

“Get up, pieces of craps!” General Qiao shouted impatiently. He was always obsessed with martial arts and was very experienced in that. The reason why he disliked Su Qiao was that she had no talent to learn martial arts at all. His abilities must be one of the best in the world; if not, he could not be the general here.

However…

He could not figure out how these people fell and just thought they were trying to be lazy.

“All lazy bastards! Can’t you even restrain a mad girl?!” The General’s wife did not expect that the useless “Su Qiao” did this, and she shouted in rage.

However, those servants groaned on the floor and could not get up no matter how the General and his wife tried to command them. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

General Qiao frowned when he saw the servants rolling on the ground. His eyes were filled with impatience. He walked forward directly and was going to restrain his crazy daughter in order to send her to another residence.

Ye Qingtang was slightly curious when General Qiao walked towards her. Based on the clues she knew about this world, General Qiao should be one of the most powerful people in this world. There should be no one who was more powerful than him here.

Ye Qingtang was waiting to see how much difference there was between her ability and the General’s.

General Qiao lifted his hand and was about to grab Ye Qingtang’s shoulder. Based on his ability, it should be as easy as lifting up a chicken to grab “Su Qiao”.

The moment General Qiao stretched his hand out, Ye Qingtang did not move but released one trace of her force within her body.

Boom!

A loud sound was heard in the hall. General Qiao, whose face was filled with unpleasantness, was thrown out by the force. His giant body landed heavily on the ground.

“…” Ye Qingtang stared at General Qiao with perplexed feelings. He was thrown out by that little amount of force from her.

Powerful figure of the world?

The most powerful General?

… How could he be so weak?!

As Ye Qingtang was amazed at how weak the “most powerful’ person in this world, it was chaos in the hall.

“Master! Master… What happened to you?” The General’s wife witnessed how General Qiao flew out and rushed forward nervously, trying to get him up.

General Qiao felt that he was just trodden by numerous horses. The pain was unbearable, and his head buzzed.
