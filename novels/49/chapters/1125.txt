Chapter 1126: A Fight Between Formidable Opponents (1)

But for some reason, that Buddha statue easily resolved all the attacks of that human-looking demonic creature.

The human-looking demonic creature found it strange. Logically speaking, this Buddha statue was so powerful and could clearly kill it with the flick of a finger, but this Buddha statue’s moves were not threatening.

Before the demonic creature could think further, a cloud of blood appeared in the sky.

A cold man in a long blood-colored robe was standing in the air. His white hair swayed in the wind, resembling a True God of this generation.

The Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at the demonic creature coldly. “Blockhead.”

Upon hearing that, the demonic creature looked above and was stunned when it saw the Blood Moon Holy Lord.

Although this person was a Yang Lord, his manner was extremely imposing and could even cause it to instinctively shift to self-defense mode.

Blood Moon Holy Lord clenched his fist gently, and a boundless might enshrouded that Buddha statue.

In the next second, the Buddha statue was shattered by the impact of the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s overbearing aura and vanished.

“Can’t you even tell that it’s an Illusory Spell?” Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at the demonic creature apathetically.

“Who… are you!” The demonic creature’s malicious eyes met Blood Moon Holy Lord’s indifferent eyes and roared sternly.

“My identity is not important.” Blood Moon Holy Lord was emotionless, but his eyes suddenly looked at the direction where Ye Qingtang went to.

“Find that lady from before… and kill her is what you should do.”

“Oh? You two… have a feud?” The demonic creature stared at Blood Moon Holy Lord and asked inquisitively.

“You talk too much.” A cold glint flashed across Blood Moon Holy Lord’s eyes.

Almost instantly, the demonic creature was repressed by Blood Moon Holy Lord’s imposing manner.

Boom, boom!!

With an explosive sound, the demonic creature could not withstand the overbearing aura and lost its balance. Its knees fell onto the ground.

“How… hateful!!” The demonic creature glared at Blood Moon Holy Lord furiously. This person’s aura did not seem ordinary, but how could he only be at the Yang Lord realm?!

“You… are so powerful… Why don’t… you kill that… woman… yourself!” The demonic creature looked at Blood Moon Holy Lord and shouted angrily.

“It’s none of your business.” After saying that, Blood Moon Holy Lord retracted his aura.

As the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s aura dissipated, the demonic creature finally regained control of its own body and stood up slowly.

“Where is… that lady!” The demonic creature asked.

“So foolish.” Blood Moon Holy Lord looked at the demonic creature and said coldly. “After you left Wind Cloud City, she headed there. Hurry up and get the hell back.”

Then, Blood Moon Holy Lord disappeared in the air instantly.

“Humph!” The demonic creature scoffed and rushed towards Wind Cloud City.

Sky Stars City had already lost one team, and if Wind Cloud City was also lost, the general would probably… kill him!

At that thought, the demonic creature roared furiously and ran at its fastest speed, disappearing in the blink of an eye. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

On a mountain in Central Mainland, Ling Yan opened his eyes immediately.

“Broke my Illusory Spell…” Ling Yan mumbled thoughtfully.

“Ha… Interesting. Are you still unwilling to give up…” Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly. “What a pity though. Two can play at that game.”
