Chapter 1044 Skill (1)

The Great Elder stared at the number of people in Bai Kui’s team and frowned heavily.

There were at least seven Yin Yang Perfected Lords including Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin. Furthermore, both of their abilities had passed the third Heaven of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

Though their force was extremely strong, there were guests from the Beiming Manor in the Yunxiao Sect today besides the Grand Elders from the Yuehua Sect and the Lingyun Sect. If Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin dared to attack them, they would definitely provoke the Beiming Manor.

Yunxiao Sect belonged to the Beiming Manor.

“Bai Kui, Daoist Zijin, the Yunxiao Sect has nothing to do with you! If you still want to challenge us, we will not hold back anymore!” The Great Elder of Yunxiao Sect stared at the few Yin Yang Perfected Lords and shouted coldly.

Daoist Zijin scoffed and said, “Zhou Tian, what’s the point of holding back when it has come to this situation… Furthermore, how will Yunxiao Sect care for us anyway?”

“You…”

The Great Elder of the Yunxiao Sect clenched his teeth tightly and wished that he could tear Daoist Zijin’s skin.

Boom!

Suddenly, a few shadows rushed towards the crowds of wardens. Within a few breaths, a few wardens’ heads were chopped off by branch masters of the Ye Family.

The Great Elder of the Yunxiao Sect was very strong but was weaker than Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin. He was about to run when he realized that the situation was not good for him.

“Where do you want to go?!” Bai Kui scoffed and followed the Great Elder immediately.

However, a few Elders of the Yunxiao Sect immediately rushed forward to block Bai Kui’s way.

“Get lost!”

Bai Kui shouted. Before anyone could realize what was going on, the few Elders who were at half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord level were thrown out by Bai Kui’s aura,

The Great Elder of the Yunxiao Sect fled into the Yunxiao Sect at the same time.

Bai Kui exchanged a glance with Daoist Zijin. There were many powerful people in the Yunxiao Sect. It was too risky for the two of them to break into Yunxiao Sect unless Ye Qingtang took the lead.

However, Ye Qingtang was the strongest force of the Ye Family. She could not just attack impulsively without the appearance of the main opponent.

When Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin were discussing what they should do next, around ten people walked out of the Yunxiao Sect under the Great Elder’s lead.

The two Elders in white robe were the Grand Elders of the Yuehua Sect and the Lingyun Sect.

They came to the Yunxiao Sect as they heard that guests from the Beiming Manor were here. However, the Great Elder of the Yunxiao Sect said that there were people here to find trouble with them.

There was a middle-aged man in a purple robe standing there with prestige. A golden cloud was sewed on his chest area. The man was the Sect Master of the Yunxiao Sect.

“Bai Kui, Daoist Zijin, are there any misunderstandings between the Yunxiao Sect and you? Why would you come here to find trouble with us?” The Sect Master of the Yunxiao Sect looked at Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin and said indifferently.

There were seven Yin Yang Perfected Lords in the crowd. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“You offended someone that you should never even try to provoke. The punishment will be the extermination of the Yunxiao Sect.” Daoist Zijin scoffed and said.
