Chapter 933 Inheritance Of The Bloodline 4

At that moment, it was as if Ye Qingtang was wrapped in a small sun. Her entire body radiated with a startling glow.

“This is the purest power of my inheritance. You will need time to break it down and integrate it. You cannot leave until you have absorbed the entire power of the inheritance,” said the Divine Phoenix as it looked at Ye Qingtang.

When she heard that, Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. However, she could help but be shocked. The power of the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix was so great that it was frightening.

“Having obtained my inheritance, I hope that you will agree to a condition.” The Divine Phoenix thought for a long time before it spoke.

“Condition?” Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback by the Divine Phoenix’s words but immediately asked, “What does the Lord Divine Phoenix require of me?”

“My clan.” The Divine Phoenix finally spoke after a long pause.

“The Phoenix Clan of the four Fiendcelestial Beasts…” Ye Qingtang looked thoughtful.

“That’s right, the Phoenix Clan.” The Divine Phoenix nodded. “I died too long ago. Today, only a trace of my remaining spirit is speaking to you. However, when I was dying, I could sense that something changed in my clan. Their aura dissipated slowly, as if they were under some kind of indescribable oppression.”

“Oppression?!”

Ye Qingtang looked shocked and was even a little disbelieving.

As one of the four Fiendcelestial Beasts, the Phoenix Clan was incredibly powerful. They did not lack mature phoenixes. Even those of the initial grade would still exist within the clan. Who in this world could oppress the Phoenix Clan?! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Even the legendary true god would not be able to easily achieve that…

Ye Qingtang suddenly remembered that it was not just the Phoenix Clan. She had heard little white tiger mention that its clan and parents, the White Tiger Clan, were also one of the four Fiendcelestial Beasts. However, from the bits and pieces that little white tiger had told her, Ye Qingtang had discerned that the White Tiger Clan seemed to have encountered some kind of startling change.

Now, Ye Qingtang heard from the Divine Phoenix that the Phoenix Clan might have encountered some kind of oppression. Further, the Phoenix Clan and the White Tiger Clan both belonged to the four Fiendcelestial Beasts. Perhaps there was some kind of connection between the two of them?

“Lord Divine Phoenix, I will do my best to investigate and find out the truth.” Ye Qingtang spoke after a long pause.

“No need to force the matter. Your life is more important,” said the Divine Phoenix.

To repress the Phoenix Clan of the four Fiendcelestial Beasts, the entity must possess supernatural martial power. It was a pity that the Divine Phoenix had died millions of years ago and was unable to leave this place to return to the habitat of the Phoenix Clan. It was also unsure what had actually happened to the Phoenix Clan.

“I will remember,” promised Ye Qingtang.

“In the future, when you have grown, you must remember where your inheritance is from. You must do your utmost to help me find out the truth. After that, return here and tell me the truth,” said the Divine Phoenix.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, please don’t worry. I understand.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Ye Qingtang was very respectful of the Divine Phoenix.

Even though it had died millions of years, it still had a deep longing for the Phoenix Clan. In this world, few could do as the Divine Phoenix had done.

To Ye Qingtang, whether it was the Phoenix Clan or the White Tiger Clan, they all held special meaning in her heart.
