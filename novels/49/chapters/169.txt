Ye Qingtang looked at Qinglin Sect’s cowardice in satisfaction. Even if no one mentioned it, she could guess from their reactions that the idiot she caught in her hands had some high-up position in Qinglin Sect.

However…

So what.

Today, he is the meat, and I am the butcher!

What bullshit Qinglin Sect!

“Your junior brothers are pretty nice to you,” Ye Qingtang said with a seeming smile as she looked down at Du Qiang, who was drenched in cold sweat from the pain.

Du Qiang had a face full of blood, and his body could not stop trembling due to the pain. A deep sense of hatred filled his eyes as he glared at Ye Qingtang.

“Looks like you’re not willing to submit… But don’t worry, I will not kill you.” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly, and she suddenly released Du Qiang’s hair that she grabbed in her hands. Then, she took out a bottle of elixir from her space ring. Opening the bottle with one hand and using two fingers from the other to tug on Du Qiang’s lower jaw, she dislocated his jaw and poured an entire bottle of elixir directly into his mouth!

Ye Qingtang poured a full bottle of elixir cleanly. Raising her leg, she kicked Du Qiang’s chest and forced him to swallow down a mouthful of elixir.

After Du Qiang was kicked on the chest by Ye Qingtang, the tendons on both his hands were broken, and his jaw was dislocated. As such, he was in so much pain that his body convulsed immediately.

Looking at Du Qiang’s misery, Ye Qingtang raised another leg and kicked him away directly.

The Qinglin Sect disciples instantly rushed forward and held the bruised Du Qiang up. A few of them wanted to find Ye Qingtang to settle the score.

However…

“The elixir I fed him just now was the Destructive Heart Pill,” Ye Qingtang said carelessly when she saw that the Qinglin Sect disciples had dashed up to a few steps away from her.

In an instant, the disciples froze on the ground.

“He swallowed down such a huge amount of it. If you all still don’t think of a way, I guarantee that he will be at most a dimwit for the rest of his life from tomorrow onwards.” Ye Qingtang smiled brightly.

The Destructive Heart Pill was a poison that crept people. Although it would not take one’s life immediately, it could destroy their mind. No matter how smart someone was, the person would still become dumb, and all his martial skills and talent would be rendered useless by the pill.

The Qinglin Sect disciples felt a chill rising from their feet and enveloping their entire body.

That was an entire bottle of Destructive Heart Pill!

With just a short delay, Du Qiang would really end up worse than dead!

The Qinglin Sect disciples who initially wanted to fight their reputation back completely dropped the idea at this moment and helped Du Qiang up frantically. With an angry glare at the Xuanling Sect disciples, they fled in a flurry.

Watching the back view of the Qinglin Sect disciples fleeing, Gu Yanqiu and the rest finally heaved a huge sigh of relief.

A close shave. Really a close shave!

“Junior Sister Ye, it is really lucky that you’re here this time,” Gu Yanqiu said sincerely with a sigh. He had never felt that he would be this lucky to recruit someone into the team.

At this instant, the other Xuanling Sect disciples completely put down all their prejudice against Ye Qingtang.

What red spirit root or not. They personally saw Ye Qingtang’s abilities and were utterly convinced!

They were extremely glad that Qin Huan made Ye Qingtang remain in the team. Otherwise, not only would they lose the result of their labor today, but they would also be the ones to suffer humiliation.

Meng Sheng panted lightly from a side, and he could not help but feel a deep sense of shame. The moment he thought of the many suspicions he had of Ye Qingtang previously, he wished he could give himself two huge slaps!
