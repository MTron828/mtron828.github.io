Chapter 2348: Next (2)

“Boss! You’re so formidable!” Lei Yan was the first to recover from the shock. Leaping ecstatically into the air, he nearly jumped onto the platform to raise his Boss onto his shoulders.

What was the definition of awesome?

Their Boss was the definition of awesome!

Di Nuo was only at what cultivation level, and he was already strutting around all day, thinking so highly of himself.

Look at their Boss! So low profile and humble.

This was how a truly powerful practitioner should behave!

By this stage, Qin Feng and the others had also recovered from their shock. They gazed at Ye Qing with sparkling eyes. An undisguised look of admiration and worship filled the eyes of Nangong Lie and the others.

“I am feeling rather faint now. I say, brother. This is truly a massive stroke of luck for us…” Hang Wenwei still looked a little shaken. He placed one hand on Gong Jinyun’s shoulder.

This was just too exciting.

He never expected that he had actually stumbled upon a Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level teacher.

Damn, he would have to give offerings at the temple tomorrow to show his gratitude.

Gong Jinyun and Qiu Nan were still in shock. But Hang Wenwei’s words echoed their own thoughts.

This was really a major stroke of luck for them!!

Compared to the joy of those brats, the other medicine faculty students looked rather conflicted. They had been very stunned but managed to recompose themselves. Only to realize that Ye Qing’s students had been even more astonished.

Still pretending?!

How could they possibly not know the standard of their own teacher?

Ye Qingtang didn’t waste any time. She shot Lei Yan and the others a look to calm down, before turning to Zhu Ning.

“Next.”

Ye Qing did not ask to rest before continuing the next challenge. The crowd was electrified.

Nevertheless, there was quite a number who felt that as powerful as Ye Qing was…

Could he really also be that good at alchemy?

But wasn’t he only a few years older than them!

“I don’t believe that Ye Qing’s alchemy skills can surpass Teacher Zhu’s. If he can win, I will eat this whole platform.” One of the medicine faculty students was very sure.

The match between Di Nuo and Ye Qing had been between two martial arts teachers. The medicine faculty students only watched it for entertainment purposes. But Zhu Ning was the backbone of their medicine faculty. They didn’t believe Ye Qing would defeat Zhu Ning.

Meanwhile, Lei Yan and the others were much calmer. They stared at the medicine faculty student who claimed that he would “eat the whole platform” with a “you are just asking for it” look.

Elixir-refining skills? Their Boss feared no one in this aspect!

As everyone watched, Zhu Ning walked over. He looked at Ye Qing with a complicated expression.

“How do you wish to compete?” Zhu Ning asked.

He acknowledged that Ye Qing was indeed powerful, but now, they were competing in elixir refinement which had nothing to do with cultivation level.

Even if he was facing an Emperor level practitioner, Zhu Ning would not lose in the field of alchemy.

Ye Qing simply replied, “You can choose.”

“Damn! So pompous!” Ye Qing’s words incited the medicine faculty students. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Arrogant.

Too arrogant.

Zhu Ning didn’t expect Ye Qing to be so audacious and he gave a slight frown before continuing. “In that case, shall we compete on the Green Asteroid Elixir?”

All the medicine faculty students gasped.

Lei Yan and the others had not heard of this elixir before. Unabashed, they asked, “Yun Chen, what is this Green Asteroid Elixir? Is it very formidable?”

Yun Chen replied, “It’s a Master-level elixir.”

Lei Yan, “…”

Well, excuse me!

This was an elixir which he could never afford.
