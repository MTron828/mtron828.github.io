Chapter 1932: Battle My Steed First (2)

The face of the effeminate-looking youth turned extremely surly. It was obvious that the Holy Lord of Shadows was mocking him for being scared off earlier.

“You!”

Ye Qingtang didn’t wait for him to complete his sentence and only continued calmly, “If you can win against my steed, I will give you another chance to challenge me.”

The moment Ye Qingtang uttered those words, Ming Di, who had been suppressing his rage the whole time, finally emitted an earth-shattering roar.

“Our Holy Lord has no time to play with a little brat like you. Let me test your abilities first.” Ming Di’s eyes burned with an aggressive fire. He had been waiting for Ye Qingtang to give him the go-ahead all this time. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Are you insulting me?” The effeminate-looking youth glanced at Ming Di before sneering.

The Undead Clan and members of the ancient clans were completely dumbstruck by the youth’s words.

“He’s just a mere steed and he wants to be my opponent? Holy Lord of Shadows, you are really belittling me, aren’t you?” the effeminate-looking youth stated coldly.

“A meresteed?” Ming Di narrowed his eyes.

The people in the ancient clans all swallowed hard. Even the arrogant eight tribe leaders stole discreet glimpses at the dangerous glint in Ming Di’s gaze.

They had seen people with a death wish before, but none as foolhardy as this youth.

In the entire Central Mainland, this youth was the first person who dared to disregard Ming Di in such a bold manner.

They saluted his bravery.

Ming Di spoke, “The Holy Lord has spoken. If you believe you can defeat me, then you will definitely be able to challenge the Holy Lord. If you are that confident, the Holy Lord will step up.”

The effeminate-looking youth was clearly still very doubtful of this mere steed, but he did not say anything further. He only turned toward the silent, grim-faced youth standing behind him.

The grim-faced youth studied Ming Di.

The two of them were still young while Ming Di had been locked up for over 10,000 years. As a result, unlike the other ancient clan folks, they had not heard of Ming Di’s fearsome reputation.

In their eyes, Ming Di was just the steed of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

The grim-faced youth sized up Ming Di and a strange light flashed across his eyes. But he didn’t say anything and just nodded at the effeminate-looking youth.

Having gotten his senior brother’s assent, the effeminate-looking youth spoke again, “Alright then. I will honor the Holy Lord’s wishes and play with your steed. But Holy Lord, let me make one thing clear, don’t blame me if I accidentally kill your steed.”

The effeminate-looking youth’s tone was full of arrogance. The eight tribe leaders couldn’t help breaking out in cold sweat for him. They secretly glanced at Ming Di, who was already narrowing his eyes once again.

Punk, you are truly gifted at seeking death.

Ye Qingtang had no idea how powerful Ming Di was. She just hoped he would be able to stop this youth. But now, it was the cold and grim-faced youth who was worrying her. He was clearly of a higher ranked than the effeminate-looking youth. Otherwise, why would he seek the permission of that person?

Ming Di lunged forward with a roar. His massive black wings covered the sky but the effeminate-looking youth remained unmoved. He just stood there, waiting for the opportunity to quickly finish off this steed, and force the Holy Lord of Shadows to step in.

“Brat, seeing that you have some abilities, I will let you make the first move,” Ming Di offered grandly.

A look of disdain crossed the effeminate-looking youth’s face as he snorted.

“I am afraid you cannot even withstand my move.”
