Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As the Blood Moon Elder looked at his Holy Lady talking to the Fiendcelestial Beast, a shudder ran through him.?This Fiendcelestial Beast would probably be unable to escape from Holy Lady’s hands. With such intelligence, how dare it be crowned as a Fiendcelestial Beast…

“Forget it, I’m still unwilling to kill… I’ll let you say then. What must I do for you to let me go?” The little white tiger scoffed coldly.

“You’re so adorable. Naturally, you should be my spirit pet,” Ye Qingtang said it as if it was a matter of course. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Adorable?” The little white tiger was stupefied as it shot a strange look at Ye Qingtang. “You said I’m adorable?”

“Very adorable.” Ye Qingtang continued to pinch the little white tiger’s nose.

“Ow… Don’t touch my nose!” The little white tiger shouted. It opened its baby mouth and pointed at its sharp small tooth. “Do you know what this is? It’s a fang. Even that king-level demonic beast whose body was impenetrable was pierced by my sharp fang. Aren’t you afraid!”

“So cute…” Ye Qingtang stroked the little white tiger’s tiny sharp tooth and even took the opportunity to touch its small pink tongue.

“… F*ck you…”

“You will follow me from now on. I can provide you elixirs and let you become an adult Fiendcelestial Beast as quickly as possible… There’s even a possibility for you to become a full-form beast. How about that?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Fiendcelestial Beast in her arms and appealed to its emotions.

After hearing Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Elder wanted to cry. Why was this sentence so familiar? It seemed that his Holy Lady once promised him something similar and said the exact same thing!

But… where were his elixirs? Or his peak skills? They were all a trap!

“Pfft!” The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang in disdain. “You were born on this mainland. What capabilities can you have? Full-form my *ss… Do you know that a full-form Fiendcelestial Beast can easily destroy ordinary Perfected Gods and Heavenly Demons? Do you think I’m a fool!”

“You don’t believe me?” Ye Qingtang curled her lips.

“I don’t!” The little white tiger was very firm.

“Then how did your demonic aura get sucked away by me?” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

“…”

“And how were you defeated in my hands?” Ye Qingtang asked again.

“:… F*ck you…”

“As a Fiendcelestial Beast, you should know what this is.” Ye Qingtang carried the little white tiger in one hand while a golden flame floated in the other palm.

The flame leaped in Ye Qingtang’s palm and subsequently condensed into a phoenix of flames.

“This… Could this be… Ultimate Origin…”

After feeling the aura of the golden flame in Ye Qingtang’s hand, the little white tiger was a little shocked.

“That’s right. This is the … Ultimate Origin Skill…

Ye Qingtang leaned down to the little white tiger’s ear and chuckled softly.

“Hmph. So what? I am a Fiendcelestial Beast…” The little white tiger seemed to not be bought over by Ye Qingtang’s act.

“Holy Lady, this thing does not know how to appreciate your kindness and does not have any combat ability. How about we tear it apart? The blood of a Fiendcelestial Beast is fiend blood, and its flesh is celestial flesh… After we consume it, our skills will definitely increase a lot!” the Blood Moon Elder said with a face full of smiles.

After hearing the Blood Moon Elder’s words, the Fiendcelestial Beast shuddered. “You all… lowly humans. How dare you think of eating me!”

“Pfft! So what if I eat you, fool?” The Blood Moon Elder retorted.

Seeing that the lady who spoke was so fierce and malicious, the little white tiger scoffed. “I will not argue with a human lady with long hair and short insight.”

“…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder stared at the little tiger.
