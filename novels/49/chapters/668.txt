Chapter 669 Leaving the Mystic Realm (3)

Only a small number of people were lucky enough to obtain some inheritances and treasures as they ran for their lives. Only Ye You obtained a destiny of a land of inheritance, but when compared to Ye Qingtang, Ye You’s gains still paled greatly in comparison.

Even Ye Qingtang did not think that she would be the one to obtain the Fiendcelestial Beast after entering the Hell of Avicinaraka.

She still remembered how when they just entered the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, she only thought of leaving this place alive and never expected to obtain any destinies or treasures.

Currently, there was still some time for Ye Qingtang’s spirit root to advance a grade. Thus, it was not appropriate to use the Black Heaven Water to cleanse it in this period of time, and Ye Qingtang was not in a hurry either.

In the next few days, there was not a moment that Ye Qingtang rested as she consolidated her cultivation at her hiding place.

On the other hand, the little white tiger slept soundly while the Blood Moon Elder patrolled the surroundings.

The past few days were rather calm and quiet, and nothing special happened.

Most of the remaining survivors in the Hell of Avicinaraka seemed to be hidden as well. No one was clear whether that Ice Frost Divine Sword left or hid somewhere. If he returned again like before, he would probably slay anyone he saw.

Dawn.

The Blood Moon Elder entered the cave that Ye Qingtang was hiding in and spoke. “Holy Lady, not much happened in the past few days. It seems that everyone is waiting for the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm to close.”

Ye Qingtang nodded. It was the same as what she expected. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The interior of the giant tower was not as dangerous as the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm. As long as they did not leave the giant tower or risk their lives and head to the dangerous areas, they would not encounter any danger.

Several hours later, the Hell of Avicinaraka dimmed. Heaven and earth seemed to suddenly reverse.

When Ye Qingtang opened her eyes again, she was already out of the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm.

The wind caressed her cheeks as she stepped on the flat land. It was only then when Ye Qingtang returned to her senses.

At this instant, she had finally left that dangerous Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm.

Although she had gained many things, she was unwilling to come to this place another time.

“Holy Lady, are we out?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at the dense forest that surrounded them.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

They were finally out.

Once the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm closed, the remaining survivors were subsequently released at various areas. There were no other survivors nearby where Ye Qingtang was released.

“Where do we go now?” The Blood Moon Elder fixed his thoughts. God knew how torturous that Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm was.

“F*ck! Why am I out?!” The little white tiger crawled up. When it saw the beautiful forest around it, it was utterly stupefied.

It had been in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm for a long time. Even if the mystic realm opened or closed, it did not have any influence on it. But… why was it out this time?

Ye Qingtang looked at the dumbstruck little white tiger. “Did you forget that you signed an equality contract with me?”

Once the mystic realm closed, all people would be removed from the mystic realm. The little white tiger was originally not in the scope of being removed, but… she and the little white tiger signed a contract. Hence, when she was being sent out, the miserable Fiendcelestial Beast was also sent out as well.

The little white tiger glared at the calm Ye Qingtang, and all of its hair stood up. “F*ck you! I’m not leaving. If you all want to leave, you all can leave by yourselves.”
