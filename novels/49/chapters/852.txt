Chapter 853 Breakthrough

If Ling Yan had ambition, it was extremely great, but if it was said that he had no ambition, he really did not have any at all.

Whether it be snatching the Emperor’s position or destroying the Central Dynasty to rule it later on, they were all out of passivity.

From what Ye Qingtang knew, Ling Yan did not have any grand aspiration to rule the world, nor did he have any desire for power.

Ling Yan’s life could be summarized in eight words: fighting with the heavens was a boundless joy!

What Ling Yan wanted to fight against and trample under his foot was destiny, the Heavenly Dao, and the heavens.

“You have been thinking for a while… It seems that my ending is indeed not very pleasant.” Ling Yan smiled.

“Aren’t you afraid?” Ye Qingtang was rather surprised.

Ling Yan analyzed from her expression that he did not have any good ending but could still face it with a smile…

“Afraid?” Ling Yan shook his head. “I said that there is no predestined fate and karma. If my ending will be what you know from your previous life and that it is already predestined in this life… that is only interesting to me then. I will personally crush this weak and vulnerable destiny.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“I really admired you then,” Ye Qingtang said.

While Ye Qingtang had a rebirth, if she had to experience the tragedies from her previous life again, it would be impossible for her to achieve it.

Moreover, Ling Yan never experienced it but knew of his miserable ending from others and even treated it as a form of joy.

“Ha… I’m lying.” Ling Yan laughed suddenly. “If I’m not afraid, I would not figure out the karma and look for you. I wish to personally break the predestined fate, and only you… are able to help me.”

“Me?” Ye Qingtang frowned immediately.

While there was a great disparity in the skills of the First Domain and the Second Domain in that war, the many deaths in both domains was an agonizing sight, and Ye Qingtang did not wish to be involved in it.

“Miss Ye, you and I don’t have any good ending… You wish to crush your destiny, and only I can help you. Similarly, I… only have you.” Ling Yan’s lips tugged up slightly.

“Oh… By saying that, you are out to get me,” Ye Qingtang said meaningfully while looking at Ling Yan.

“Miss Ye, from the karma natal chart, it seems… your ending is more miserable. If we have to say it clearly, why not say that it’s you who is out to get me,” Ling Yan said.

Then, Ye Qingtang could not be bothered with talking to Ling Yan anymore and walked ahead with great strides while Ling Yan followed right after Ye Qingtang.

“Why are you following me?” Ye Qingtang turned around and found Ling Yan following behind her.

“Protecting you.” Ling Yan smiled.

“You protect me…” Ye Qingtang laughed from the anger. With his Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven skills, who was protecting who exactly?

“Miss Ye, I’ve already saved you twice.” Ling Yan reminded.

For a moment, Ye Qingtang had nothing to say.

Regardless of how Ling Yan’s martial skills were, he did save her twice.

A while later, Ye Qingtang entered a cave and placed the Glazed Cup before her.

Ling Yan remained outside the cave understandingly and did not follow Ye Qingtang into the cave.

Half a day later, a frightening surge of spirit energy seeped out of the cave.

At the same time, Ye Qingtang’s eyes widened immediately, and she absorbed all the spirit energy which seeped out back into her body in a flash.

Outside the cave, Ling Yan looked into the cave with interest. “Breaking through to Yin Yang Perfected Lord Second Heaven… from a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.. Interesting.”
