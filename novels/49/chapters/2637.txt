Chapter 2638 Shocking Change (4)

However, before long, Han Cangming gradually lost control and flew away.

Ye Qingtang did not know what had happened and wanted to chase after him. However, Ye Qingtang’s speed could not match up to Han Cangming’s. Having no other voice, Ye Qingtang returned to her original position.

Although Ye Qingtang was extremely puzzled, Ling Yan was not around and her queries could not be answered.

…

In the distance.

The red light had already covered Han Cangming’s entire body.

“Heh…” Han Cangming chuckled. “The me in this era has yet to fully establish his powers.”

After Han Cangming finished speaking, the other half of his body seemed to be struggling crazily, wanting to break free from Ling Yan’s control. However, it was all in vain.

After about an hour, Han Cangming’s right eye turned blood-red. An indescribable luster appeared in his blood-red eyes. After a moment, they returned to their normal color.

“In this era… although my strength is not at its peak, it is enough.” The corners of Han Cangming’s lips curled up slightly. “Unfortunately, I don’t like my former appearance.”

Han Cangming’s face changed drastically. If Ye Qingtang were here, she would definitely recognize that Han Cangming’s face was Ling Yan’s.

Soon enough, Ling Yan raised his hand and Han Cangming’s soul appeared. “Past Me, I have to trouble you to continue being the Demon God in this era.” As Ling Yan finished speaking, a blood-colored light appeared and turned into a silver wolf.

A few seconds later, the silver wolf turned into a human body. This blood-colored light was Ling Yan’s former body. In the next second, Ling Yan placed Han Cangming’s soul into that body.

“Past Me, I will seal you off for fifty years. After that, Miss Ye and I should have long left this era. Using you to deceive fate is the most suitable choice.” The corners of Ling Yan’s lips curled up slightly. He then waved his arm and sealed this body in the void.

Ling Yan’s plan was very successful. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

First, he used his own life as the price to open the Ancient God Karma Tunnel. The final traces of Ling Yan’s Karma Bloodline then entered this era with Ye Qingtang. In this distant era, not only did Ye Qingtang obtain a huge fortuitous opportunity, but Ling Yan also got his wish and possessed his former self.

Although the two Han Cangmings, past and future, were the same person, their souls were completely independent. It was impossible for Ling Yan to remain forever in this era. Once he left, his disappearance from history would definitely arouse the suspicion of the fates. Therefore, Ling Yan had to leave his body, and after possessing the soul of the past-era Han Cangming, he placed that soul into that empty body. Identical bodies, identical souls. A flawless plan.

However, Ling Yan could not predict what would happen in the future. Nevertheless, he had already prepared for the worst. Perhaps, after returning to his own era, the Han Cangming whom he had sealed off would appear again…

At that moment, Ye Qingtang walked into the deep pit and started to check on the injuries of the Heavenly Emperor. After she had absorbed the destructive energy from the Heavenly Emperor’s body, his injuries were improving and he was rapidly healing.
