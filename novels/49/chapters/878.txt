Chapter 879 The Azure Dragon (1)

The little azure dragon was in thought. It then looked towards Ling Yan and asked in disbelief, “You’re really willing to share half of the Inheritance of the True Dragon with me just for her?”

The little azure dragon was clearly aware of how precious the inheritance of the Dragon Vein was to Ling Yan. However…

“It’ll just be a possession in my life that I can’t take away with me if I’m dead. It doesn’t matter if I share half of it with you.” Ling Yan smiled and said.

“That’s not what you said previously. I’m curious. If you were the Demon God, what kind of death calamity would make you leave your body and be reborn with your soul and memories… It’s not the Heavenly Emperor who caused the death calamity right…” The little azure dragon asked meaningfully.

Thirty thousand people and the Heavenly Emperor could not do anything to the Demon God. The Demon God left under everyone’s gaze. Thus, based on its assumption, the Demon God was definitely not afraid of the Heavenly Emperor. However, if it was not the Heavenly Emperor, who else could force the intelligent Demon God to the standard that he needed to come out with such a plan?! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The azure dragons possessed demonic intelligence. However, he had no clue about that.

“I think you are less smart than the white tiger beside Miss Ye.” Ling Yan smiled and shook his head as he stared at how confused t azure dragon was.

“What did you say?!” The azure dragon shouted in a rage after hearing Ling Yan’s words.

“It just has thicker skin than me. It’s not smart! I guess that it’s guided by someone else, but I presume everything by myself. It’s a totally different case!”

Ling Yan just smiled gently but did not say anything

“Let’s leave. I get irritated whenever I see it.” The little azure dragon stared at the silver wolf beside Ling Yan and said.

“ARH-W000000!”

However, the silver wolf suddenly gained courage and gnashed its teeth at the little azure dragon.

“Oh… that’s interesting. The silver wolf that was formed from the demonic air seems to be very close to you, Ling Yan…” The little azure dragon said and stared at Ling Yan meaningfully.

“Aren’t you very close to me as well?” Ling Yan said.

“Pfft!” the little azure dragon scoffed and was about to grab the tail of the silver wolf and leave.

“ARH-W000000!”

However, the silver wolf was getting fiercer and was not willing to leave.

“You… Is this a dog’s nature when it sees its master?! Forget about it. You can wait for your death here!” The little azure dragon scoffed.

The little azure dragon then put on its human skin, disguising itself as Master Du, and left.

In the Dragon Vein at the same time, Li Bingxue and the rest left earlier as they had something else to deal with. After the three people left, the little white tiger suddenly probed its head out and looked towards the distant place. “F*ck! No wonder I could sense the breath of the Fiendcelestial Beast on that old man… I did not expect that it would be an azure dragon.”

“What azure dragon?!”

Ye Qingtang, who was observing the space ring, suddenly asked.

“Nothing, I was just saying that there’s an azure dragon in the Dragon Vein,” the little white tiger said.

“A dead one?” Ye Qingtang was curious.

“Alive…” The little white tiger explained.

“How old is the azure dragon?” Ye Qingtang asked again.

“Also at its infant stage,” the little white tiger said.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes suddenly sparkled, and she said, “Little azure dragon… Little white, do you think we should…”

“Are you going to ask me to catch the azure dragon… and sign a contract with it as well?!” The little white tiger’s face was filled with astonishment.

Ye Qingtang nodded immediately. Though she had a little lightning dragon, the lightning dragon was totally incomparable with an azure dragon. The lightning dragon belonged to a normal dragon clan, but the azure dragon was one of the four Fiendcelestial Beasts!

If she could get the azure dragon, she would possess one more Fiendcelestial Beast!
