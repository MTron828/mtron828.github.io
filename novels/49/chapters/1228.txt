Chapter 1229 Holy Son 3

Mu Shi had vanished many years before Ye Qingtang arrived at the Central Mainland in her previous life. It was only then that people discovered Mu Shi’s other identity.

Besides being a teacher in the Eternal Academy, Mu Shi had another identity. He was a famous thief in Central Mainland. Legend had it that there was nothing that he could not steal.

Ye Qingtang had not intended to concern herself with this fellow who had tried to get her into trouble, but now she changed her mind.

“Hold on.” Just as the child was about to crush Mu Shi’s skull, Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke.

“Ah Yao?” The vicious look on the child’s face disappeared, and he looked at Ye Qingtang with delight.

“Ah Yao, are you finally willing to speak to me?” The child’s face was filled with joy. He immediately flung Mu Shi aside and flew into Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“Ah Yao, next time you must not ignore me. I know I should not have broken your rules previously. In the future, I will definitely obey you. If you forbid me to kill wantonly, I won’t kill anymore. Look… I don’t use human blood anymore. All this… is deer blood.” The child crouched on Ye Qingtang’s knee and raised his head. He looked at Ye Qingtang as if he was about to cry. He seemed desperately afraid that Ye Qingtang would not believe him, so he waved his small, blood-stained hands under Ye Qingtang’s nose.

“…” Ye Qingtang looked at this mercurial little child. She did not know what to say. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At that moment, a figure slowly walked over.

It was a handsome man dressed in white. He leisurely walked over to the throne and bowed to Ye Qingtang. “Your servant, Xue Fu, was too late to receive you. Holy Lord, please forgive me.”

Then Xue Fu said, “Holy Lord, Holy Son is speaking the truth. The Holy Lord was previously displeased because the Holy Son slaughtered humans and refused to speak to the Holy Son. However, after the Holy Lord left, the Holy Son became more restrained. Holy Son had not left the Temple in all these years and has quietly guarded your treasure trove. He has not killed anyone.”

“Ah Yao, did you hear what Xue Fu said? I’ve really been very good…” The child looked at Ye Qingtang pleadingly.

Ye Qingtang finally understood. Before the Holy Lord left earlier, she had not spoken to the Holy Son. That was why the Holy Son had reacted so violently to her refusal to speak just now.

But Ye Qingtang had heard of this Undead named Xue Fu in her previous life. He was one of the two guardians of the Temple of Shadows.

The Undead were naturally fleshless. But if their cultivation reached a high level, they could create an illusion of a body of flesh. Then, they looked just like a human.

“Um.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

Just one word was sufficient to make the child’s eyes shine brightly.

“I still need this person. Let him live for a while.” Ye Qingtang changed the subject and pointed out why she had spoken just now.

“Let him live?” The child was taken aback. When he looked at Mu Shi, his eyes were filled with murderous intent. “But, Ah Yao, he besmirched your things. He is not fit to live in this world…”

Ye Qingtang secretly took a deep breath. Her face became a little colder.

“So you are still unwilling to listen to me. Forget it… since that is the case, I’ll go.”

With that, Ye Qingtang made it as she was to arise.

When the child saw that Ye Qingtang was about to leave again, he panicked. He burst into tears and clung onto Ye Qingtang’s leg.
