Chapter 814 Shameless (3)

The next morning, Master Du looked at the torn Bliss Forging Workshop in surprise. What happened?

Ye Qingtang notified Master Du of the incident apologetically.

Master Du chuckled and was not too bothered.

“Brother Ye Chen, the Dharma artifact that I forged for Perfected Xuanchen still requires the blessing of your Extraordinary Flame.”

Master Du told Ye Qingtang as they walked into the inner hall of the workshop.

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang nodded. She naturally knew that Master Du was forging a weapon for Perfected Xuanchen. However, it was made with Millennium Meteoric Iron, which needed to be refined with Extraordinary Flame; otherwise, it would be hard to be forged.

Ye Qingtang flicked her wrist immediately, and a streak of golden flames flew into the workshop

About two hours later, Master Du retrieved the item and cooled it with ice water.

Looking at the finished good, Master Du beamed and said, “Brother Ye Chen’s extraordinary flame is indeed special. If it’s any other ordinary flame, I’m afraid it’ll need at least three days’ time for it to form.”

Using Ye Qingtang’s Extraordinary Flame, the time was shortened to two hours, which showed the uniqueness of the golden flame evidently. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Brother Ye Chen, you can stay in the Bliss Forging Workshop for another half a day. I’ll make a trip to Falling Sky Valley and hand this item to Perfected Xuanchen,” Master Du said.

Master Du originally wanted Du Sheng to deliver the item, but this Dharma artifact was too valuable. Apart from the large amounts of Millennium Meteoric Iron from Ye Qingtang, there were other extremely precious materials. For safety reasons, Master Du eventually decided to deliver it personally.

Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment and replied. “There’s no trouble. You can hand this item to me. I can bid farewell to Master as well.”

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, Master Du nodded and placed the Dharma artifact into a wooden box, which he handed to Ye Qingtang afterward.

Ye Qingtang received the Dharma artifact and left the Bliss Forging Workshop.

In no time, Ye Qingtang was back in Falling Sky Valley.

In the main hall of Falling Sky Valley, Perfected Xuanchen was seated in the central position as he reviewed a stack of files on the table, seeming to be settling some matters in the valley.

Looking at Perfected Xuanchen’s ever-familiar figure, Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up involuntarily.

In her previous life, before Perfected Xuanchen became the acting Valley Master, he was even more powerful than other Peak Masters and feared nothing. More than that, he was known for being protective, and almost no one was willing to offend the Admirable Sky Peak which Perfected Xuanchen was in charge of.

However, after the Valley Master was severely injured by the Peerless School wardens and Perfected Xuanchen took over the Valley Master position temporarily, he was much more restrained.

With harmony as a priority, all he thought of was to fulfill the responsibilities of this position and ensure the safety of the entire valley.

Currently, Perfected Xuanchen was no longer the Peak Master of a Falling Sky Valley peak but the Valley Master of the entire valley, and his responsibilities were no longer limited to a peak.

Looking at Perfected Xuanchen’s haggard expression, Ye Qingtang felt upset for some reason.

In her previous life, Perfected Xuanchen rescued her from her misery and never fussed over her spirit root or natural gift. He allowed her to be apprenticed to him to cultivate diligently and even took care of her as though she was his daughter.

At the start, Perfected Xuanchen was stricter with Ye Qingtang than with other disciples, causing her to think that he had never put his heart on her.
