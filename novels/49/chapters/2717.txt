Chapter 2718: Becoming An Immortal Immediately (3)

Actually, Ye Qingtang and the disciples of the Great Immortal Temple did not know much about Destruction-level divine weapons. Even the experienced and knowledgeable Zhang Chi had never heard of Destruction-level weapons.

But if they were to consider things from the price point of view, Destruction-level divine weapons sold in high-tier ancient cities should be much higher than Heaven-level divine weapons.

Ye Qingtang was very curious about the owner of these soul bones. The cultivation level of this owner was probably on par with that of mighty figures like the High Monk and Heaven Ascension Sect Master.

After the death of the soul bone owner, his Deity Ocean turned into this legacy. All the rare treasures sold in the ancient cities were probably his possessions.

Earlier on, Ye Qingtang even saw a Fiendcelestial Beast-level spirit animal in the shop.

However, Ye Qingtang was not interested in spirit animals now, so she did not buy any.

“Shopkeeper, what’s so special about Destruction-level divine weapons… How do they compare to Heaven-level divine weapons?” One of the Great Immortal Temple disciples asked the skeleton shopkeeper.

“Destruction-grade divine weapons are not forged. They are divine items formed from the spirit energy of Heaven and Earth. Heaven-grade divine weapons are forged by humans and are not comparable at all,” the shopkeeper explained.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on a crimson black stone sword.

This sword was the same size as a normal weapon. It did not look extraordinary, but it radiated with a faint but astonishing aura.

“How many cursed points is this?”

Lan Shan looked at one of the Destruction-level divine weapons.

“2,000.”

“Can it be cheaper… We’re your long-time customers. Look at all the Heaven-level divine weapons and Dharma treasures we have already bought here… Are you sure you cannot lower the price,” Lan Shan bargained with a smile.

Everyone looked at Lan Shan with strange expressions. They could bargain here?

“2,000,” the skeletal shopkeeper repeated.

“There’s no room for negotiation?” Lan Shan looked a little reluctant.

“2,000.”

“I want it.” In the end, Lan Shan sighed and used his cursed points to purchase the Destruction-level divine weapon.

The price of each Destruction-level divine weapon was different. However, they were all about 2,000 cursed points.

“Shopkeeper, what is the name of this sword?” Ye Qingtang pointed at the red-black divine weapon.

“I don’t know, it doesn’t have a name. This sword was obtained from a nameless place where the Heaven Ascension Sect Master once cultivated. It has no origin and no name.”

“I want it.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“100,000,” the shopkeeper said. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The smile on Ye Qingtang’s face froze. Did she hear wrongly?

“How much?” Ye Qingtang asked dubiously.

“100,000 cursed points,” the shopkeeper said. “The divine power of this weapon has already surpassed the limits of Destruction-level divine weapons. All Destruction-level divine weapons have an artifact spirit inside, but this weapon does not have any. Even so, its power is thousands of times that of any divine weapon. It is also this shop’s ultimate treasure.”

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. Was this skeleton serious? Was it trying to cheat her? It even claimed that it was the most valuable item in the entire store… How exaggerated.

“Cultivator, you have enough cursed points, so I can demonstrate its power for you.” The skeleton looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Demonstrate then. If it’s really as you say, I’ll buy it.” Ye Qingtang nodded.
