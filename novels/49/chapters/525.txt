Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What do we do when our friends come?”

Elder Huang of the outer sect shouted.

“We welcome them with the best wine!”

“What do we do when our enemies come?”

…

“We use our blood to soak Xuanling’s flag!”

…

“We use our heart to light Xuanling’s anger!”

…

“We use our hands to hit Xuanling’s drums!”

…

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

“Kill!”

Thousands of disciples shouted together. The fighting spirit was so intense in their eyes that death was not something that they were afraid of.

“Kill everyone of the Xuanling Sect!”

Li Chenfeng’s eyes were full of disdain. He sat on the divine beast and commanded.

Few hundreds of Yunxiao Sect disciples immediately dashed towards Xuanling Sect.

Boom!

Weapons were waving in the sky and landed on the protection array of Xuanling Sect. The golden rays of lights did not go out but were getting more intense.

Even the smallest sect contained huge power and backups. If not, why would they establish the sect!

The golden array formation was the protection formation of the Xuanling Sect. It would not be easy even if a Yin Yang True Lord wanted to break it.

The hitting sound of the weapons was heard above the void. Hundreds of Yunxiao Sect disciples combined their power, trying to break the protection golden array.

However…

Only small ripples appeared on the golden formation.

“Xuanling Sect… has some power,” one of the Yunxiao Sect elders said coldly.

Swoosh!

The elder flew downward and concentrated all his primordial qi at the golden formation.

“Oh…?!”

The elder was shocked as the golden formation was still intact.

“Please let the divine beast attack!”

The elder looked towards Li Chenfeng.

Clank!

The divine beast attacked with its beak instantly. It seemed to be the most terrifying weapon in the world and pecked towards the golden array formation.

Boom!

Boom!

Ripples appeared constantly on the golden formation as the divine beast attacked. After a dozen attacks, the golden rays of lights seemed to be dimmer.

The golden array formation was broken under the attack from the divine beast’s beak after ten minutes. Golden rays of lights filled the sky and dropped like golden rain.

“Kill!”

Few hundred Yunxiao Sect disciples rushed into the Xuanling Sect the moment the golden array formation was broken.

“Turn on the Heaven Elimination Formation!” The Xuanling Sect Master shouted.

A ray of illusory light appeared suddenly and formed into a net when he finished his words. It wrapped towards the Yunxiao Sect disciples. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The few hundreds of Yunxiao Sect disciples sensed the terrifying power of the illusory light. Their faces suddenly changed, and they backed off.

However…

A few elite inner sect disciples of the Yunxiao Sect could not escape on time and were surrounded by the net.

The illusory light chopped those elite disciples of the Yunxiao Sect into pieces at a speed that could be witnessed by the naked eye. Blood spurted everywhere.

“Heaven Elimination Formation?”

One of the Yunxiao Sect elders frowned.

“Turn on the Earth Killing Formation!” The Xuanling Sect Master commanded again suddenly.

The ground at the Xuanling Sect suddenly turned into a pool of blood at the next second. Hundreds of hands of blood condensed from the pool of blood.

Before the Yunxiao Sect wardens and the elite disciples could figure out what was happening, they were caught by the hands of blood and dragged into the pool of blood.

The pool of blood was like a swamp. Once someone sank into it, struggling would accelerate their death.

Apparently, the few Yunxiao Sect disciples and wardens were not clear about that. They struggled to get rid of the pool of blood but eventually were submerged.

One of the Yunxiao Sect elders tried to suppress the power of the formations after witness their terrifying ability.

However, the Yunxiao Sect elder looked down on the power of the two formations. One of his arms was chopped off by the Heaven Elimination Formation.
