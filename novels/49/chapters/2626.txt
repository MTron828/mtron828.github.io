Chapter 2627 That Unparalleled Strike (4)

Everyone was stunned at the sight of this. It was the first time they had seen the Heavenly Emperor turn into a golden dragon.

“Is the Heavenly Emperor not human?”

One of the practitioners stared at the Heavenly Emperor who had transformed into a golden dragon above the void. He was dumbfounded.

No one knew much about the Heavenly Emperor and there had never been rumors that the Heavenly Emperor was related to the golden dragon before. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Ye Qingtang looked slightly doubtful as she looked at the golden dragon that the Heavenly Emperor had turned into but didn’t seem to be his body. It seemed to be some sort of blood magic but Ye Qingtang had no idea what it actually was.

The golden dragon looked huge within the void. It roared loudly and the earth seemed to shake. The shadowy figure behind the clouds stared at the golden dragon that the Heavenly Emperor had morphed into with a glint in its eye.

Even though the tenth bolt was extremely powerful, for now, it had nothing to do with the golden dragon, Light reflected off the dragon’s scales as though it was trying to devour everything. “Boom!”

A loud noise surrounded the entire arena as the tenth bolt from the Calamity of Wrath struck the back of the golden dragon directly.

The golden dragon roared in fury and the breath of destruction surrounded the tenth bolt, trapping it within a sealed space. Yet after a few breaths, the tenth bolt broke free and shot towards the golden dragon.

“That is the last bolt of Heavenly Tribulation from the Calamity of Wrath… Will the Heavenly Emperor be able to withstand it?”

The practitioners from afar were all utterly dumbfounded. They had never heard of an Immortal Emperor being able to withstand all ten bolts before.

“Don’t tell me, the Heavenly Emperor is really going to be able to withstand the tenth bolt… has he already successfully ascended to the heavens?” Once the elders swallowed. Judging by the current situation, the golden dragon that the Heavenly Emperor had morphed into had extraordinary might. Be it defensive or offensive power, it had already reached a height unimaginable to most people.

It was amazing that the golden dragon could float in the void without being destroyed after being struck by the tenth bolt.

“Look at that… the light from the tenth bolt is slowly dimming!” One of the younger martial arts practitioners pointed at the sky and said.

As soon as the words were out of his mouth, everyone turned to look at where he was pointing.

Just as he said, the color from the Calamity of Wrath was slowly fading and the power it was emanating seemed to be diminishing as well. But they could see that the golden dragon was also riddled with wounds. The only unchanging thing was its eyes, which were still glinting coldly and indifferently.

He was… fighting the skies.

Ye Qingtang assessed the situation in the Feng family arena and wasn’t as worried as before. Judging from the current situation, after the Heavenly Emperor had morphed into the golden dragon, if nothing went wrong, he should be able to withstand the tenth bolt.

But what made her curious was what was going to happen after he withstood the last bolt.

Any Immortal Emperor was qualified to ascend to heaven as long as they could withstand all ten bolts from the Calamity of Wrath
