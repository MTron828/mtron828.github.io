Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Blood Moon Elder was disgusted from being patted by Ouyang Jian but could only force himself to lean on his “father”‘s arm frailly in search for comfort.

Ouyang Jian looked at his daughter in his arms with a frown. Then, he looked up at the beautiful young man who followed the Blood Moon Elder into the Ouyang family clan. However, at this instant, there was less affection and more sharpness in his eyes.

“This is?”

“I am Ye Chen,” Ye Qingtang said in a dignified manner.

“May I know who your Master is?” Ouyang Jian asked cautiously. Although the Blood Moon Elder said that this young man was his benefactor, Ouyang Jian did not believe it easily. Given the Ouyang family clan’s position, many people schemed to cling to them. Ye Chen was of dubious background, and no one knew what his motive of saving Ouyang Qian was.

Ye Qingtang obviously knew what Ouyang Jian was thinking of. Ouyang Jian was a cautious and ruthless person. He only displayed a kind father’s appearance to Ouyang Qian but was exceptionally fierce to others.

“I’m just an itinerant cultivator.”

Itinerant cultivator?

Ouyang Jian’s eyes sharpened. He had heard a thing or two about the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka before. The people whom the Ouyang family clan sent out this time were all at Martial Qi Level Three and above, and even Ouyang Qian was at Martial Qi Level Three herself.

So many aces lost their lives in the Hell of Avicinaraka, but how capable was this Ye Chen to be able to escape safely and even save his daughter?

“I’ve troubled you this time, Young Sir Ye. Since you saved Qian, the Ouyang family will naturally not treat you badly.” Afterward, Ouyang Jian turned around and spoke to the Blood Moon Elder, “Qian, you were shocked and will need to recuperate. Someone retrieve the Lingyue Elixir for Young Miss.”

The Blood Moon Elder’s eyes brightened immediately upon hearing those two words.

The Lingyue Pill was a miracle pill that could replenish one’s qi and blood and nourish one’s muscles and veins. It was a treasure that normal people could not even buy with money.

Before the Blood Moon Elder returned to his senses, the housekeeper had already brought a bottle of Lingyue Elixir and handed it to the Blood Moon Elder.

“Qian, if you need anything, just tell me. I will not let you suffer ever again,” Ouyang Jian said dearly.

This time, the Blood Moon Elder did not find it disgusting at all. Looking at the bottle that was filled to the brim with Lingyue Elixir and hearing Ouyang Jian’s promise, his heart bloomed… Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

How was Ouyang family clan’s heritage?

How plentiful were their treasures?

Just by how Ouyang Jian pampered Ouyang Qian, he would thrive in the Ouyang family from now on!

“Thank you, father,” the Blood Moon Elder said with a smile, saying “father” smoothly and cleanly this time.

“Qian, I didn’t think that this trip would be so alarmingly dangerous. Just nice I have some Imperial Spirit Pills. Do accept it too.” Qin Chen, who had been silent throughout, suddenly stood up. He took out a few bottles of pills from his space ring and handed them to the Blood Moon Elder.

Although the Imperial Spirit Pill was not as precious as the Lingyue Pill, it was extremely rare as well.

With Ye Qingtang’s earlier reminder, the Blood Moon Elder naturally recognized the man before him. However, to him, there was no such logic as rejecting a treasure that was sent right to his doorstep.

“I’ll accept it then.” The Blood Moon Elder took those bottles of Imperial Spirit Pill over from Qin Chen.

In just a moment, he gained several bottles of precious elixirs and pills successively without even doing anything. The Blood Moon Elder was more than delighted.
