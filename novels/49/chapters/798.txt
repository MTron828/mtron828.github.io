Chapter 799 Grand Imperial Sire (4)

“I am relieved to see that you’re well today.” The Grand Imperial Sire smiled. He had been suppressing this matter in his heart for a long time.

He had sent people countless times and even personally went to search many times, but he still did not have any news.

“Don’t worry, Grand Imperial Sire. Young Lord… is very powerful now, and even Long Jiang is not her opponent,” Qu Xiangyang said with a beam.

“Oh? That’s the best.” The Grand Imperial Sire smiled in gratification.

“Since you’re back now, just remain in Nine Nights Dynasty… Although my illness is beyond hope, I still can provide what you need. You can treat it as repayment to your mother,” the Grand Imperial Sire said.

However, Ye Qingtang shook her head. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“I appreciate your kindness. I will let you know if I need anything.”

Nine Nights Dynasty was ultimately not where she belonged.

“May I know how your illness is? Can you let me take a look?” Ye Qingtang asked. Since the Grand Imperial Sire was someone her mother once helped, she did not wish to see the Grand Imperial Sire being bedridden with a lingering sickness.

The Grand Imperial Sire nodded.

As Ye Qingtang checked the Grand Imperial Sire’s pulse, her brows furrowed slightly.

“This is poison.”

The Grand Imperial Sire was stunned.

“If there’s no accident, it should be that someone added a chronic poison in your food.” Ye Qingtang explained.

Both Long Jiang and Qu Xiangyang were shocked.

“How can it be? Many highly-skilled physicians attended to the Grand Imperial Sire before, but no one knew the reason. How can it be poison?” Long Jiang questioned.

“The perpetrator is very careful.” Then, Ye Qingtang retrieved a bottle of pills from her space ring and continued. “Consume this pill every day. You must pay attention to the food in the palace. If possible, change all the people and allow only your trusted subordinates to prepare your food.”

With three hundred years of experience in her previous life, she had seen many varieties of poison, and this poison was not a problem for her.

Knowing Ye Qingtang’s identity, Long Jiang and the rest naturally believed her words fully and immediately fed the Grand Imperial Sire a

pili.

Soon after the Grand Imperial Sire consumed it, his complexion recovered. Although he was still weak, he was already more vigorous.

“Exactly who dares to lace poison in the Grand Imperial Sire’s food?” Long Jiang narrowed his eyes.

“You all will have to investigate this yourselves,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Grand Imperial Sire nodded. Since he knew that he was poisoned, he would naturally take care of the matter carefully.

As he was able to become Nine Nights Dynasty’s Emperor, he was not a useless person either.

“Father…” The little Emperor was overjoyed when he saw that the Grand Imperial Sire’s complexion had improved.

“Release him.” Ye Qingtang told the Blood Moon Elder, who was still carrying the little Emperor.

The Blood Moon Elder released his grip immediately.

The little Emperor ran to the Grand Imperial Sire’s bedside hurriedly and pointed to Ye Qingtang with a furious expression. “Father! It’s her! She humiliated me in public! Hurry up and kill her!”

The Grand Imperial Sire was shocked. Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, he lifted his hands strenuously and slapped his son.

“Insolent! You are not to be rude to her!”

The little Emperor fell on the ground from the slap and looked at his father in shock.

“Fa… Father… You… You have never hit me…”

“Forget it that you’re usually unruly, but I’m telling you that if you’re rude to this lady, I will break your legs! If not for her mother’s assistance back then, I would have died long ago, and you wouldn’t even be here! I have warned you today. If you dare to be insolent to her again, you’ll get out of Nine Nights Dynasty, and I’ll treat it as though you are not my son.” It was the first time the Grand Imperial Sire was this strict to his only son.
