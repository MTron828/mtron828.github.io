Chapter 1121 Kill 2

Shenchao Sect Grand Elder’s eyes were filled with respect.

“What do we do next?” Ye Qingtang suddenly asked softly.

“Uh… Yang Lord, we don’t know what to do either…” The Shenchao Sect Grand Elder was stunned.

Ye Qingtang rubbed her temples and said helplessly, “I was not asking you…”

Before the Shenchao Sect Grand Elder spoke again, Ling Yan’s soft chuckle sounded from the voice transmission stone. “Miss Ye, you can let all these people leave.”

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang nodded and had an idea in mind.

“This place is not safe to stay for long. All of you should set off for Falling Sky Valley in the Nine Nights Dynasty immediately.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Shenchao Sect Grand Elder and Sect Master and said.

Shenchao Sect Grand Elder did not have any objections to a Yang Lord’s words and immediately agreed without asking for the reason.

“Now… we can completely destroy this city.” Ling Yan’s chuckle came from the voice transmission stone.

Ye Qingtang nodded and stored her voice transmission stone. She first removed the space rings from the You Ancient Clan people before leaving.

Given Ye Qingtang’s current skills, it was impossible for her to open the space rings of those black-robed men. However, those disciples’ space rings stored many black-grade weapons and rare treasures.

As Ye Qingtang walked around Sky Stars City, the huge city was lifeless as though it had become a dead city.

Swoosh!

At this instant, more than ten You Ancient Clan senior executives flew in all directions and surrounded Ye Qingtang.

“Scumbag, how dare you kill a You Ancient Clan member!”

The leading black-robed elderly looked at Ye Qingtang and hollered furiously.

“I did not look for you all, but you all came to court your death on your own accord.” Ye Qingtang swept across the people and snickered.

“Yang… Lord…”

After sensing Ye Qingtang’s aura, the black-robed elderlies looked at each other with shocked expressions.

How could Sky Stars City of this low-level mainland have a Yang Lord… They had already checked that the northern region of this low-level mainland had no Yang Lords. This was also why they chose to invade this low-level mainland from the north and then swallow the entire piece of land once their skills increased to the peak of Yang Lord…“F*ck you. Let me have some exercise.”

The little white tiger shuttled out from Ye Qingtang’s embrace and instantly leaped out like a white bolt of lightning. Before everyone realized what had happened, the neck of one of the black-robed elderlies was already bitten apart by the little white tiger.

Ye Qingtang was uncertain about the exact combat power of the little white tiger after waking up, but she could be sure that if she fought all-out with the little white tiger, she might not win against the little white tiger steadily. Of course, these You Ancient Clan senior executives were no match for the little white tiger as well.

In no time, at least seven people were killed by the little white tiger tragically.

“Quick! Call Elder Yin Fo!!”

A black-robed elderly exclaimed immediately. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Elder Yin Fo of You Ancient Clan was guarding a city nearby Sky Stars City. As long as Elder Yin Fo came over, everyone would die regardless of Yang Lord or not!

“Miss Ye… it’s about time.” Ling Yan’s voice could be heard.
