Chapter 2536: Deal (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“What do you mean by kind-hearted? In this world, one only looks for what benefits oneself.” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang.

“It’s impossible for me to make such a deal with her. This woman is not a good person. She must be plotting something,” Ye Qingtang said a moment later.

“Of course there’s a ploy behind it. However, it’s not a bad thing for you. From a certain perspective, you will also be a beneficiary of this deal.” The big yellow dog pondered for a moment before explaining to Ye Qingtang.

“What do you know? Just say it clearly,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Just now, she said that your heart has bad luck. That’s indeed the case, but this bad luck is only directed at yourself. Your heart is filled with an extremely thick Heavenly Dao energy. She wants to completely absorb the Heavenly Dao energy,” the big yellow dog said.

“I see.” Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. It was true that she had wondered why the woman in green was so kind-hearted. It turned out that the Heart of Heavenly Dao contained a large amount of Heavenly Dao energy. If the woman absorbed all the Heavenly Dao energy, it would be difficult to determine how far she would grow.

“To you, it’s actually very worth it. That woman would obtain the power of the Heavenly Dao, while you can eliminate your bad luck.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought. What the big yellow dog said did make sense, but Ye Qingtang was unwilling to give up all the Heavenly Dao energy in her heart just like that, even if it was very beneficial for her. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Then, is it possible that I can absorb all the Heavenly Dao energy in my heart myself?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered.

If she could absorb the power within her Heart of the Heavenly Dao, not only would she be able to eliminate her bad luck, she would also be able to obtain all the power of the Heavenly Dao.

“Well…” The big yellow dog glanced at Ye Qingtang.” Little girl, you’re really greedy. You have the usual characteristics of a human. ”

Hearing this, Ye Qingtang was rather displeased and sneered. “This is something that already belongs to me from the start. How is that being greedy?”

The yellow dog was speechless. It was unable to retort.

“Logically speaking, it doesn’t make sense for you to absorb your own power. However, your heart is rather special. It might be possible, but I’m not sure how to activate the process. I’m not a human and have never studied you humans before,” the yellow dog said.

For now, Ye Qingtang decided to stall the lady in green first. If she really did not have a solution by then and the Heart of Heavenly Dao was seriously threatening her, perhaps she could consider it. But for now, she should try to see if she could find a way to absorb the power of the Heavenly Dao herself.

“Holy Lady!”

Just as Ye Qingtang was deep in thought, the Blood Moon Elder rushed over from outside with a panicked expression and stared at Ye Qingtang. “Holy Lady, there seem to be many powerful figures around this relay station!”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. Wasn’t this too belated? By the time he realized it, he would have probably died more than 800 times.

...

Outside the relay station.

“My Lord, we can already confirm that existence with the ability of an Immortal Emperor is inside the relay station. It’s just that the Immortal Emperor aura dispelled a long time ago. Furthermore, there were some recent natural law distortions nearby…”

A white-haired elder seemed to be in deep thought as he said, “Natural law distortions… could it be that he failed to break through to the Immortal Emperor level… if that’s the case, he should be very weak now.. There is no need for strange Immortal Emperors to exist in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.”
