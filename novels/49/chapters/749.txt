Seeing that there was something wrong with the situation, Yan Shu instinctively pulled Ye Qingtang back.

He originally thought that she was here to apologize and did not think that this fellow would be so hot-tempered. She was clearly here to start a fight!

However, before Yan Shu could pull Ye Qingtang, a snicker suddenly sounded.

“Everyone, stop.”

When the Blue Cloud Peak disciples heard that, they stopped whatever they were doing immediately and looked in the direction of the sound.

Li Jingwen was actually standing there since some time ago. With hands behind him, his lips curled into a scoff as he looked straight at Ye Qingtang, who was standing not far away.

“I was wondering which reckless person dared to come to the Blue Cloud Peak to cause a ruckus.” Li Jingwen scoffed coldly.

Yan Shu’s heart sank immediately when he saw Li Jingwen.

He originally wanted to bring Ye Qingtang away quickly. He did not think that he was still one step late as Li Jingwen was already here.

Yan Shu knew that there was trouble when he saw Li Jingwen.

When Li Jingwen was in Admirable Sky Peak, his attacks were already ruthless. Now, they were on Blue Cloud Peak’s turf, and Ye Qingtang was impudent. He was afraid that…

“Senior Brother Li.” Yan Shu suppressed his worry and hurriedly greeted before Ye Qingtang said anything.

Li Jingwen cast a nonchalant look at Yan Shu. When he caught sight of the bruise on Yan Shu’s face, he smiled faintly. “What is it? Junior Brother Yan, was our inter-disciple learning not enough? So you brought people here to continue seeking torture?”

Yan Shu’s expression darkened. Based on skills, he was indeed not Li Jingwen’s opponent, but no one would feel good to be publicly ridiculed by Li Jingwen.

Yan Shu took a deep breath, straining himself to calm down the anger in him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Senior Brother Li, you’ve misunderstood. Ye Chen just returned and knew that what he did previously was wrong. Thus, he is here to give you an explanation.”

“He is Ye Chen?” Li Jingwen raised a brow as he swept a look at the handsome young man behind Yan Shu. A trace of mockery flashed across his eyes as he said, “Explanation? No matter how I see, he doesn’t seem to be here to give me an explanation?”

A few Blue Cloud Peak disciples immediately gathered to Li Jingwen’s side.

“Eldest Senior Brother. This Ye Chen is not here to apologize and is clearly here to cause trouble. He still shouted for you to get the hell out here.”

“For me to get the hell out?” Li Jingwen’s expression darkened immediately, and he shot a sharp look straight at Ye Qingtang.

Yan Shu hurriedly explained. “Junior Brother Ye is young. If he offended you, please don’t take offense, Senior Brother Li.”

“Junior Brother Yan, I know that this Ye Chen is the disciple who your Master just accepted. Since he has become a Falling Sky Valley disciple, he is no longer a kid. Does he not know how to say a single word? Do you have to take the trouble on his behalf? If he is this useless, what did Perfected Xuanchen accept him for?” Li Jingwen chuckled and said right after. “Oh. It was a slip of the tongue. This fellow could be apprenticed to Perfected Xuanchen not because of his mouth or his skills but because he offered a gift that satisfied Perfected Xuanchen…”

Yan Shu’s expression turned ugly immediately. He could tolerate anything but not any slander towards Perfected Xuanchen.

“Senior Brother Li…”

Li Jingwen suddenly raised a hand and cut Yan Shu’s sentence. “Ye Chen, is it? You injured several Blue Cloud Peak disciples previously. If you publicly kowtow to them, admit your mistakes, and compensate them with some elixirs, this matter can be considered to be over. If you’re unwilling, as a senior brother, I will not mind to teach you since Admirable Sky Peak does not know how to teach their disciples.”
