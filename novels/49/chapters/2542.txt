Ye Qingtang already had a plan. Judging from the current situation, she had no choice but to use the power of the Deity Ocean again to escape with the Blood Moon Elder. Otherwise, the Blood Moon Elder would definitely die in this wretched place if left alone again. It would be difficult to say if she could successfully collect the Blood Moon Elder’s soul this time.

Just as the old man from the Sky Vault Sect was about to attack the Blood Moon Elder and before Ye Qingtang could make a move, a soft shout came from afar.

The middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan suddenly said, “Stop.”

The old man from the Sky Vault Sect was startled. What did this have to do with the Dragon Emperor Clan?

“Hehe, what can I do for you, Mr. Dragon Emperor Clan?” The old man from the Sky Vault Sect looked at the middle-aged man with a smile.

The middle-aged man had a cold expression. He first glanced at Ye Qingtang before sizing up the Blood Moon Elder.

“Miss, what’s your name?” The middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan asked Ye Qingtang, ignoring the Sky Vault Sect member.

“Ye Qingtang,” Ye Qingtang replied truthfully after some thought.

“Miss Ye, is he with you?” The middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan pointed at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. We are together. We went through thick and thin together. We traveled together wherever we went!” The Blood Moon Elder interjected hurriedly, not giving Ye Qingtang a chance to speak.

“I am not asking you.” The middle-aged man of the Dragon Emperor Clan said in a displeased tone.

The Blood Moon Elder immediately shut his mouth and did not say anything else.

“Yes, we are together.” Ye Qingtang nodded in acknowledgment.

“Alright.” The middle-aged man of the Dragon Emperor Clan nodded slightly before saying to the First Prince of the Sky Vault Sect, “We will be taking this lady, her dog and this person away with us.”

Everyone was shocked, including Ye Qingtang.

“The Dragon Emperor Clan is taking them away?” The old man of the Sky Vault Sect frowned.

“That’s right. Does the Sky Vault Sect have any objections?” said the middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan.

“Heh, I’m afraid that’s not appropriate. Both this woman and this dog are wanted criminals of the Sky Vault Sect. Your Dragon Emperor Clan wants to take them away?” The old man from the Sky Vault Sect was firm.

“Miss, let me ask you. Do you know these people from the Sky Vault Sect? Have you offended them?” The middle-aged man asked Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “No… I’ve never seen them before, much less offended them.”

“You heard her. She doesn’t know you.” The middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan said.

“It doesn’t matter whether she knows us or not. I already said that she and her dog are wanted criminals of the Sky Vault Sect. How can the Dragon Emperor Clan take them away just like that? That’s unreasonable and against the rules.” The old man of the Sky Vault Sect said in a cold tone.

“What… What did you just say?” The middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan looked at the old man from the Sky Vault Sect in surprise. The middle-aged man laughed. “Unreasonable… rules?”

The eyes of the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince turned cold.

The middle-aged man of the Dragon Emperor Clan said with a hollow laugh, “What’s wrong with you today, making so many jokes? You are trying to talk about reason and rules with my Dragon Emperor Clan?”

Before the old man from the Sky Vault Sect could say anything, the middle-aged man shouted, “Since when does the Dragon Emperor Clan have to adhere to any rules? When have we ever been reasonable? If you want to talk about reason and rules, speak to the Evil Deity yourself!”
