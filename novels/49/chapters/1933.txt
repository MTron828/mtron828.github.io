Chapter 1934: A Crushing Defeat (1)

Panic flashed past Ming Di’s eyes the moment the icicles penetrated his body. He appeared to be in great pain.

A venomous smile appeared on the face of the effeminate-looking youth. He stared fixedly at Ming Di, who was in apparent agony.

Ming Di widened his eyes. With a sudden shift in his gaze, he opened his massive jaws slightly.

“Aiya, so painful.”

Ming Di’s voice was completely devoid of any pain. As his jaws moved, the layer of ice encasing him suddenly cracked.

Before the effeminate-looking youth could react, the layer of ice shattered and fell to the ground in pieces. The icicles failed to penetrate even half an inch into Ming Di’s dragon scales. All the icicles looked like they had been grounded down, leaving only half the original length behind.

The effeminate-looking youth’s smile also broke along with the remnants of ice. As understanding slowly dawned upon him, he widened his eyes and stared at the completely-unharmed Ming Di.

“How is that possible...”

“Really... so painful...” Ming Di shrugged and the remaining ice shards on its body fell to the ground. Those blood-red eyes were half-closed in a lazy manner filled with indolence.

Although the effeminate-looking youth was a fool, it was only now that he finally understood what had happened.

“You tricked me!” He gritted his teeth as he glared at Ming Di.

“So what?”

“I’m going to kill you!” The effeminate-looking youth hollered in rage. With that, he burst into raging flames and his eyes were now completely silver in color. He looked like a demon incarnate.

As Ye Qingtang observed the changes, she could clearly feel the aura of the youth increase over two times.

“Holy Lord, this youngster’s aura feels off.” The Demon Tribe leader had acute senses and felt the changes too.

Powerful practitioners had their secret ultimate move. They would break through their own boundaries when forced into a desperate corner. But this effeminate-looking youth gave off a completely different vibe. The energy felt incompatible with his body, as if he was not using his own power.

Ye Qingtang was also able to detect the striking change. But her attention was not on that effeminate-looking youth. Instead, she was discreetly observing the grim-faced youth behind.

That youth had maintained a neutral expression the whole time while Ming Di was playing a trick on his partner. He had remained impassive even when he saw that Ming Di was unharmed. It was like... he already realized Ming Di was just fooling his partner.

Meanwhile, the skin of the effeminate-looking youth had turned a sickly shade of white. The blood vessels under his skin could be clearly seen, making it look like a dense network of black lines had spread throughout his body.

With a bellow of rage, the effeminate-looking youth charged toward Ming Di. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Ming Di stood there calmly, before spreading his black wings slightly. Two black tornados spun out from his wings toward the youth.

The moment the tornados appeared, the grim-faced youth shifted.

A beam of cold light shot out before the eyes of the crowd.

Boom!

The beam of light collided with the tornados. The surrounding earth felt like it would be shattered by the resulting energy.

“Senior Brother, you didn’t have to help me. I can deal with this!” The effeminate-looking youth didn’t expect his senior brother to make a move. For a moment, he felt somewhat humiliated.

After all, he had invited his senior brother to deal with the Holy Lord of Shadows. How could he have his senior brother step in against a mere steed?
