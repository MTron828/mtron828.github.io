However, no one dared to move even though they felt that the Yunxiao Sect Elder was deceiving them.

After all, he was an elder of Yunxiao Sect. If they entered into a conflict here, people were afraid that it would result in a conflict between sects should they leave this place alive. However, everyone was unwilling to let the Yunxiao Sect Elder keep the Black Heaven Water for himself.

As everyone was forcing the Yunxiao Sect Elder to hand the Black Heaven Water over, a black fog suddenly floated above everyone.

The black fog suddenly formed into a male who was completely wrapped in a black robe.

“How interesting.”

The black-robed man’s sinister laughter echoed throughout the entire hall.

Upon hearing that voice, everyone immediately looked toward that black-robed man.

“Who are you!” A super sect warden shouted at the black-robed man angrily.

The black-robed man remained silent. The pair of eyes that were only revealed looked at Ye Qingtang quietly but looked away very quickly.

“Who exactly are you!” The Yunxiao Sect Elder sized up the black-robed man.

However, the black robe was wrapped around the person securely, and it was impossible to see the person’s face.

“Who I am is not important.” The black-robed man laughed apathetically. “The original plan is for you all to die here… It’s truly weird. I placed the Ghost Wood Root in the Black Heaven Water, and according to logic, the effect of the Ghost Wood Root should be strengthened multiple folds. All of you should have been trapped in your mental demons, making you all kill each other…”

The black-robed man mumbled, seeming to be speaking to himself yet also seeming to be telling everyone.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were fixed on that black-robed man, and puzzlement filled her eyes.

Although this black-robed man deliberately spoke with a soft voice, Ye Qingtang somehow felt that it was rather familiar.

As the black-robed man finished his sentence, everyone was astounded.

“Being trapped in our mental demons was actually your doing?!”

“Who exactly are you? Why do you want to harm us!”

Everyone in the hall was enraged immediately. They almost died in this palace, and the main culprit was actually this black-robed man before them!

“Haha. Who I am is actually not important.” The black-robed man shook his head and laughed. “You all were sinners the moment you are born. Starting this Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka was merely to use your blood to cleanse these sins in the world.”

“Nonsense! How could someone be able to control the danger level of a mystic realm? If you don’t speak the truth, I will slaughter you today!” The Yunxiao Sect Elder shouted furiously.

“Ignorant.” The black-robed man scoffed. “I originally wanted to use the Ghost Wood Root to kill all of you, but it seems that this plan has failed… Since that’s the case, let me personally release you sinners.”

Afterward, the black-robed man formed a print with his palms.

BOOM BOOM!!

In the next second, the entire palace rocked crazily and emitted loud rumbles. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Very quickly, a blood-colored light enshrouded the entire palace. An endless sea of blood condensed from the red light and surged into the hall instantly.

“Extermination Of Life Formation?!”

After noticing the situation, the expressions of the Yunxiao Sect Elder and other powerful figures changed drastically.

The Extermination Of Life Formation was an extremely high-level and dangerous formation. In less than fifteen minutes, any living beings in it would turn into blood water!

“This hall actually has the Extermination of Life Formation!”

“How… can it be!”

For a moment, everyone in the palace was utterly frantic and could not believe it.

“In this case, the Hell of Avicinaraka realm is simply a huge scheme. Even the supposed fiendcelestial beast is also a big lie that was let out for this scheme!” One of the super sect elders shouted.
