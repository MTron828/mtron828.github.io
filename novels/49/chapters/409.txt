Chapter 410: Drifting Cloud Island (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Yunxiao Sect… That is one of the super sects… I didn’t think that Qinglin Sect would have the luck to earn the favor of a super sect.”

Envy filled the disciples.

There were numerous treasures in a sect, and the Yunxiao Sect was all the more so one of the super sects, which were above normal sects. Many of the mighty figures on earth were from Yunxiao Sect.

As everyone was engaged in the discussion, Ye Qingtang’s expression sharpened slightly.

To others, Yunxiao Sect shone with boundless radiance, but to her, it was a bottomless chasm.

Currently, Ye You was the official disciple of the Yunxiao Sect’s Sect Master.

Ye Qingtang was clearly aware of the gap between Xuanling Sect and Yunxiao Sect. She had been cultivating desperately merely to close the gap between Ye You and her, and entering Xuanling Sect was to obtain the Black Heaven Water. However, to truly possess the strength to fight Ye You, it was impossible to simply rely on the Xuanling Sect only.

Ye Qingtang already had a plan in mind, and now, she only needed to gradually walk down this path of revenge.

“You seem to be a little interested in that Yunxiao Sect?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder beside Ye Qingtang sharply sensed the change in Ye Qingtang’s expression. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Why did this girl’s eyes become this sharp after hearing the words ‘Yunxiao Sect’?

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder and said, “You are the one who is interested, aren’t you? Wasn’t Blood Moon Sect annihilated by the combined effort of many super sects that year? If I remember correctly, wasn’t Yunxiao Sect also one of the forces who wiped out your Blood Moon Sect?”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder originally wanted to fish some answers out from Ye Qingtang, yet his face froze because of Ye Qingtang’s words.

“The elder who led the troops in the battle against Yunxiao Sect back then was not me. Furthermore, if the super sects had not shamelessly attacked with combined forces, which of them is the Blood Moon Sect’s opponent if they fought alone? A group of despicable and lowly people. So much for calling themselves righteous sects.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder clearly disliked the super sects who were at the tip of the pyramid as he spoke of them disdainfully.

Ye Qingtang supported her chin with an arm without continuing the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s words.

The Blood Moon Sect was annihilated back then because of the combined forces of the first class super sects, which included Yunxiao Sect, where mighty figures in the world were recruited to encircle and suppress the Blood Moon Sect. Regarding his past enemy, it would be weird if the Blood Moon Sect Elder had a good attitude.

Passing by layers of clouds, an emerald island gradually appeared before everyone’s eyes.

The chattering disciples noticed the Drifting Cloud Island not far away, and their eyes twinkled.

“Rumor has it that the Drifting Cloud Island is covered with holy light, and I initially thought it was fake. I never thought that there really would be holy light.”

Drifting Cloud Island was surrounded with holy light and surging with spirit energy, attracting all the disciples’ attention.

“The elders said it already. If we can achieve good results for Xuanling Sect this year, we will have a chance to cultivate on the island.”

“If I could cultivate on the island for about a year, how good would it be…”

As everyone wished enviously, the cloud boat had already reached the island and slowly descended at the designated location.

It was only when they reached the island did they realize that the supposed Drifting Cloud Island was not sitting on water. The island was actually a hundred meters away from the surface of the ocean. Looking down from the island, one could see the waves of the sea slowly passing by from a hundred meters below.

All the disciples’ eyes shone as the sight before them was a novelty. Just standing on the Drifting Cloud Island, they already sensed rich spirit energy embracing them as though their entire body was nourished in the immense spirit energy.
