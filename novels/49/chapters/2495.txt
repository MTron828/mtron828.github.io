“Then, Holy Lady, can I kill it? If not, I can throw it out too.” The Blood Moon Elder was serious. He had had enough of this dog and he hated the color yellow.

Did this yellow dog really think that it was that precious just because it could speak?

“It’s not an ordinary being. It can speak human language.” Ye Qingtang smiled at the Blood Moon Elder.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, the Blood Moon Elder was stunned and said indignantly, “So what if it knows how to speak human language? What’s so strange about that? It’s like who doesn’t know how to bark like a dog. It can speak the human language while I can also bark like a dog. We are even then, right?”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Had the Blood Moon Elder lost his mind after he was resurrected? However, thinking about it carefully, the Blood Moon Elder did seem to have such a personality in her memory.

“Bark a couple of times for me,” the big yellow dog said while wagging its tail.

“Holy Lady, I want to kill it,” the Blood Moon Elder said. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Do as you wish. However, I cannot guarantee that the Demon Emperor can revive the soul of the same person a second time.” Ye Qingtang replied after pondering for a moment.

The Blood Moon Elder was stunned by Ye Qingtang’s words.

What did his Holy Lady mean by that?

Was she mocking him or doubting him? Even though he had lost his previous cultivation foundation and needed to start anew, surely his new body shouldn’t be unable to defeat a dog, right?

Did the Holy Lady mean that he might be bitten to death by this big yellow dog?

“Let me remind you first. I personally witnessed it killing an above-Emperor level being in one strike.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Above-Emperor… what?” The Blood Moon Elder’s mind went blank. What did the Holy Lady say just now?

“Above-Emperor level,” Ye Qingtang repeated.

In fact, it was not the Blood Moon Elder’s fault for being stunned. The Divine Lord stage was already beyond the Blood Moon Elder’s reach now. As for the above-Emperor level… the Blood Moon Elder probably did not even dare to think about it.

After a long while, the Blood Moon Elder pointed at the big yellow dog. “Holy Lady, look at the color of its fur.”

“What about it?” Ye Qingtang was baffled. Was there a problem with this yellow fur?

“Holy Lady… this is my favorite color. Have you forgotten… no wonder I felt so close to it the moment I saw it!” The Blood Moon Elder said hurriedly.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

This was indeed the Blood Moon Elder she remembered. There was no mistake.

“Look at this fur. It’s so thick, soft and smooth. With this appearance, it’s simply a dog… no, a canine god. A divine canine god!” The Blood Moon Elder clicked his tongue.

Ye Qingtang wanted to agree but after taking a look at the big yellow dog, she really could not speak against her conscience.

“What are you afraid of? If we really fight, I might not be able to defeat you.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Fight?” The Blood Moon Elder was shocked. “Oh my god, what are you talking about? I love dogs. I have a well-known nickname in the First Domain…”

“Bootlicker?” Ye Qingtang instinctively piped up.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder, “…”

“No, eh, more or less. As long as you’re happy, Holy Lady.” The Blood Moon Elder looked a little awkward. The Holy Lady really liked to undermine him.

“Brother Canine, if you don’t mind, we can be sworn brothers from now on. I am your human brother and you are my canine brother. I can also be your Little Human Brother while you are my Elder Canine Brother. How about that?”

The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

“No thanks..”
