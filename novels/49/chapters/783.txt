Chapter 784 Uninterested (1)

“It’s Young Sir Ye. I didn’t think that I would meet you here today,” Qin Chen said generously with a smile.

“I didn’t have a chance to talk to you the other time we met. What a coincidence today. How about having a drink with me?” Qin Chen asked.

The Blood Moon Elder looked at Qin Chen unbelievably.

If he remembered correctly, Qin Chen was not so polite when he saw Ye Qingtang the other time. Why was he so solicitous today?

Ye Qingtang looked at Qin Chen and said, “What crime did Qu Xiangyang commit?”

This person very likely knew her mother’s whereabouts.

Qin Chen smiled. “Qu Xiangyang is the City Lord of Fuling City but abused his power to seek personal gains and was disrespectful to the Emperor. These are capital offenses.” Qin Chen’s voice was not soft, and Qu Xiangyang, who was able to hear it from the jail wagon, scoffed. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Abused my power to seek personal gains? Fuling City is remote and barren. I served the royal family in the monarch city back then and personally requested to be sent to Fuling City. If I wanted to abuse my power to seek personal gains, would I have gone to that place?”

Qin Chen cast a cold glance at Qu Xiangyang and said, “Since you’re being punished, it naturally means you have committed a crime.”

“If you are out to condemn someone, you can always trump up a charge. In this Nine Nights Dynasty, is it a crime if one doesn’t obey your Qin family clan’s orders? Is it a crime if one does not respect your father? Haha…” Qu Xiangyang cackled sarcastically.

The surrounding citizens felt indignant but did not dare to speak out. Qu Xiangyang had a good reputation in Nine Nights Dynasty: he was upright, outspoken, impartial, and could be said to be a rare, good official. But so what if he was good?

Currently, the young Emperor was blinded by the Qin family, and the Qin family held all power.

All it needed was a sentence from Qin Long if he wanted to kill Qu Xiangyang.

“Qu Xiangyang, the Emperor has already sentenced you to death. It is useless no matter how you struggle.” Qin Chen scorned, completely unbothered that Qu Xiangyang publicly exposed the Qin family of wielding all power.

He looked at Ye Qingtang from the corner of his eyes discreetly.

His arrogance was also to display to Ye Qingtang the Qin family’s position in the Nine Nights Dynasty.

If he could rope in a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, it would naturally double the might of the Qin family.

“Young Sir Ye, there’s no need to listen to a criminal’s nonsense. Seeing that we met today, how about having a drink together?” Qin Chen brought the topic back.

As Ye Qingtang looked at Qin Chen’s favorable manner, she understood what he wanted.

“I like people who get straight to the point.”

Qin Chen chuckled. “Young Sir Ye is indeed a direct person.”

“Truth to be told, my father and I have heard about your actions in the black market that day. We know that you aren’t an ordinary person and that your skills are deeply admired. If you’re willing to, my Qin family clan would be very pleased to befriend you.”

“You want to befriend me?” Ye Qingtang said indifferently.

“Yes.” Qin Chen continued without concealing anything. “In Nine Nights Dynasty, there is no one above the Qin family other than the Emperor. If Young Sir Ye is willing, we can provide you everything you need in Nine Nights Dynasty, and you just need to be an associate of the Qin family.”

“I believe that you will not find an even more suitable friend than the Qin family in Nine Nights Dynasty.” Qin Chen looked at Ye Qingtang meaningfully.

Any cultivator who wanted to advance in skills required sufficient conditions for cultivation, and the Qin family could completely prepare all of these for Ye Qingtang
