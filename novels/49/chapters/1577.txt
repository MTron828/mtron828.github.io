“Jiang Shaobai has always been like that. But Jiang Yulang and the others still follow her lead. I think they’re all fools.”The two youths conversed for a while before leaving together.

Ye Qingtang slowly walked into Gong Valley. A cool breeze blew from the valley, brushing past her cheeks.

The entire valley was filled with rich spirit energy. There were many air vents in the ground, and from time to time, steam would shoot out of them, filling the entire valley with hot steam.

Ye Qingtang walked within the valley for a while and noticed that the spirit energy was mostly evenly distributed throughout the valley. However, there was a little more spirit energy in the areas where there were more air vents.

“There’s probably something peculiar beneath the ground of this valley.” Ye Qingtang’s gaze fell on the air vents that were continually shooting out steam. She felt curious but did not waste time analyzing it.

She could only stay in the valley for five days. She must make the best of this short time.

Now, her cultivation realm was just a step away from the Heavenly Venerate realm. Otherwise, she would not have used up all her honor points here.

Arcane Supremacy and Heavenly Venerate were just a realm apart, but between them was a gulf that was almost impossible to cross. Once crossed, one would realize that the realms were completely different.

Ye Qingtang calmed herself down and sat cross-legged at a spot with the most air vents. Although steam surrounded her and it was as hot and suffocating as an oven, she slowly closed her eyes and allowed herself to sink completely into the spirit energy. She slowly guided her spirit energy around her body and through her meridian points.

She cultivated for five days and five nights.

During these five days and nights, Ye Qingtang did not drink a drop of water or move an inch. She continually guided her spirit energy around her body and sensed that the invisible door to the next realm, which had been blocking her, was being slowly pushed aside.

The surrounding steam reddened Ye Qingtang’s pale face.

The little white tiger, who had been cuddled in her arms, could not stand the damp heat of the steam. It shook its fur and crawled down to look for a cooler place.

But at that moment, the little white tiger saw that Ye Qingtang’s expression lacked its usual willfulness, so it kept quiet and did not make any noise.

On the fifth night, in the quiet of the night, a golden ray of light suddenly burst forth from Ye Qingtang. The golden ray rushed towards the heavens, lighting up the entire dark valley.

But the sacred ground was deep within Taiyuan Valley, and it was late at night, so no one noticed these signs of a breakthrough.

When the golden light shot back into Ye Qingtang’s body, Ye Qingtang suddenly opened her eyes. The golden glow that floated around her meant she had successfully broken through the first door of the Heavenly Venerate realm within these five days.

She had finally entered the Heavenly Venerate realm!

She puffed out a hot breath, and a smile surfaced on her face. She lifted her hand and casually wiped away the sweat on her cheeks. Then, she looked at the time. She still had half a day before she had to leave the valley.

Although she had received a breakthrough, Ye Qingtang did not dare to waste time. These ten thousand honor points had been hard to come by. She intended to fully grasp every minute and every second and continue cultivating.

Ye Qingtang only walked out of Gong Valley the next afternoon. Her entire aura had changed subtly.

“It’s a pity that I’ve used up all my honor points.” Ye Qingtang returned to her room to wash herself up. She sensed the new strength within her body. She might have entered the Heavenly Venerate realm, but she still had quite some way to go before she could enter the Martial Arts Championship. There were still five months left. Within these five months, she had to do her best to narrow the gap between her and others.
