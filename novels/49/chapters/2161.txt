Chapter 2162: Awakened Bloodline (3)

The awakening of a bloodline was a serious matter. Ye Qingtang would have to activate the Deity Ocean in her body to guide the gradual awakening of Jing Ze’s bloodline. This was to prevent his body from exploding from the sudden power surge of an awakened bloodline.

But as Ye Qingtang guided the boy, she realized that something was not quite right.

She discovered two types of bloodlines in Jing Ze’s body.

One of them was Zhang Qiqiu’s Sky Rage Bloodline!

However, the Sky Rage Bloodline’s power was quite weak and was gradually being absorbed by the other bloodline.

The discovery left Ye Qingtang extremely shocked.

She had the Devouring Bloodline with its trademark ability to devour.

However, Jing Ze’s second bloodline was different from the Devouring Bloodline. The Devouring Bloodline had the ability to absorb and refine another person’s energy to become its own. But Jing Ze’s second bloodline had absorbed his opponent’s energy to replicate a counterfeit bloodline. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang had heard of this kind of bloodline before. This was a high-level bloodline called the Divine Hidden Bloodline...

The Divine Hidden Bloodline could replicate an opponent’s power during a fight and make use of it. The counterfeit bloodline could even display up to 80 percent of the original’s power.

The Divine Hidden Bloodline was very rare. In her past life, Ye Qingtang had only heard of one person who had this Divine Hidden Bloodline...

And it had been that evil man with the same name as Jing Ze... the Yun Mian Palace Master...

Previously, Ye Qingtang thought that Jing Ze just happened to have the same name as that evil man. But the appearance of his Divine Hidden Bloodline had Ye Qingtang re-evaluating her initial opinion.

Could it be... Jing Ze would become the Yun Mian Palace Master 300 years later?

Ye Qingtang: “...”

She was really unable to picture this timid Jing Ze as the malicious murderer 300 years into the future. But the same bloodline, the same name, as well as the same age...

Surely all of this was too much to be a coincidence, right?

Ye Qingtang mulled over it before arriving at a surmisation.

During this period of her previous life, the world had yet to discover any bloodline-awakening methods. As a result, Jing Ze was kicked out of the Netherworld Academy because of his poor abilities.

And after Jing Ze had to leave the Netherworld Academy, he must have encountered some major event that changed his character. Thereafter, his bloodline was awakened and the Second Domain was introduced to the malevolent Yun Mian Palace Master.

Ye Qingtang seemed to recall someone mentioning then that the Yun Mian Palace Master’s family had been butchered by enemies in his early years. His beloved little sister had her torso sliced apart right in front of him...

The gruesome image made Ye Qingtang frown at the thought.

How many cruel things must have happened to Jing Ze to change this kind, obedient boy into such an evil person 300 years later...

“Teacher Ye...” Mu Ziying noticed that Ye Qingtang had remained silent and had a grave expression on her face. The rims of Mu Ziying’s eyes turned red as she believed that something must be very wrong with Jing Ze.

Finally, Ye Qingtang snapped out of her reverie and looked at the red-eyed Mu Ziying. She immediately consoled her. “Jing Ze is not injured. His bloodline is awakening.”

Mu Ziying was delighted at the news.

“Senior Brother’s bloodline is awakening?!”

Ye Qingtang was just about to nod when she suddenly heard two muffled voices from outside the classroom. She turned to see Lei Yan and Nangong Lie, their faces filled with shock and their eyes bulging from disbelief.

What did they hear?

Didn’t Jing Ze have no bloodline?

What was this about his bloodline awakening?!
