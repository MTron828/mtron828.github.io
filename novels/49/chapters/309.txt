Liu Yue continued talking. “This was originally a great thing, but someone just had to overestimate her own abilities. She did not use those Xuanming points to cultivate honestly and insisted on exchanging for the qualifications to participate in the inner sect assessment. She even excitedly exchanged for the Spirit Consonance River’s usage rights for a few hours.”

Liu Yue said, “Won’t that someone just look at what spirit root she has.”

While Liu Yue did not mention the name, all the disciples present knew who she was talking about.

The news of Ye Qingtang exchanging for the inner sect assessment’s participation qualification and the Spirit Consonance River’s usage rights had already circulated in the outer sect over the past two days. All the outer sect disciples who heard of the news thought that Ye Qingtang was crazy. Otherwise, why would she do such a wild thing?

“Senior Sister Liu, don’t talk about it anymore. Let’s leave first.” Su Wan mumbled as she tugged on Liu Yue’s sleeves.

Liu Yue frowned and said softly, “Are you really easy to be bullied? Are you still not clear what kind of person Ye Qingtang is? If not for her, why would Senior Brother Lu be flogged so many strokes? Senior Brother Lu is still laying on bed to recuperate now!”

A bitter expression was seen on Su Wan’s face as though she suffered a huge wrong.

Yun Shu’s face darkened immediately when they heard the cutting remarks. He instinctively wanted to walk up to them but was held back by Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang shook her head at Yun Shu slightly with a seeming smile.

“Senior Brother Yun, why bother arguing with the likes of them?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Are you not angry?” Yun Shu was surprised.

Ye Qingtang chuckled. “If a dog bites me, should I bite it back?”

It was not for them to comment on whether she had the ability. On the day of the assessment, everything would be apparent.

Yun Shu was a little shocked and could not help but laugh.

“Forget it. It is good to ignore them as well. However, what you did this time was indeed rash. I know that your natural endowment is good, but recklessly participating in this year’s inner sect assessment…” Yun Shu spoke with a serious expression.

Ye Qingtang said, “Don’t worry, Senior Brother Yun. Since I did it, I must have a certain level of confidence.”

Seeing her confidence, Yun Shu did not say anything more. Perhaps even Yun Shu himself did not notice that after the Shangyue Fire Tripod incident, he was no longer as gentle as before, and there was a fierce expression in his eyes.

After sorting their thoughts, the two of them entered the Martial Arts Hall to cultivate without wasting any more time.

Su Wan watched Yun Shu and Ye Qingtang leave and bit her finger secretly.

She had never expected that Yun Shu still had a chance for recovery while Lu Xiuwen…

Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu had just entered the Martial Arts Hall, but a disciple notified them that Elder Huang from the outer sect’s Sword Faction summoned Shen Qianshu.

Ye Qingtang immediately headed over.

In the big hall, Elder Huang had a dignified expression, and an unusual expression passed by in his eyes when he saw Ye Qingtang walking in.

“Disciple greets Elder Huang,” Ye Qingtang said with a kneel.

“Raise.” Elder Huang scanned Ye Qingtang. He naturally did have some impression of Ye Qingtang. After all, she was the only red spirit root whom Xuanling Sect accepted in the past hundred years.

But because of that, Elder Huang did not pay too much attention to this disciple as it was difficult for there to be any improvements since her spirit root was too poor.

Yet, unexpectedly…

“Ye Qingtang, I heard that you exchanged for qualification to participate in the inner sect assessment this year?” Elder Huang asked straight to the point.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied.
