Chapter 2100: Try and I’ll Lose

“The seal of the Divine Phoenix is about to disappear...” Ye Qingtang clutched her chest as her breathing turned heavy.

She could feel the power that the Divine Phoenix had left and the Heart of the Heavenly Dao slowly vanishing. It wouldn’t be too long before the seal completely disappeared.

This was not good.

She frowned. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The Heart of the Heavenly Dao was a ticking time bomb. Even though it had been within her all this while, she had forgotten about it due to the Divine Phoenix Seal and because her thoughts were occupied with saving Little You Yun.

But now...

There would be great trouble if the seal completely disintegrated. She couldn’t understand why the Heart of the Heavenly Dao had appeared within her.

Somehow, her thoughts drifted to her mother.

Perhaps the only way to understand why the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was there was to find her mother.

“The Dragon Emperor Clan...” she murmured the name of her mother’s clan to herself. She had found a clue regarding her mother that day at the mystic realm when she had come into contact with someone from the Dragon Emperor Clan.

The Dragon Emperor Clan was in the Second Domain!

Her thoughts were racing. She had to find a way to leave the Temple of Paragon, to leave this mainland so that she could head towards the Dragon Emperor Clan to find out more about her mother.

However...

She was rendered speechless by the four walls around her.

What made the Temple of Paragon so sure that she was the reincarnation of their Holy Lord?

Just because of her face and bone structure?

No. It had to be because of her extra three hundred years of memories that made them suspect that she was their Holy Lord. But what they didn’t know was that her memories were from her previous life.

How would she dare tell this to those in the Temple of Paragon?

As for the Temple of Paragon’s Holy Lord, she was a mystery in the Second Domain as well. Other than the fact that she was extremely powerful, no one else knew much about her.

Ye Qingtang felt like...

For someone so powerful that she could make the Second Domain tremble, her reincarnation would likely be planned.

Not like Ye Qingtang’s previous life.

She didn’t want to let this misunderstanding go on. The Temple of Paragon was going to smash her into smithereens if they found out about the truth one day.

A knock came from her door as she was thinking of all this. She opened the door only to be greeted with a smiling Elder Hua.

She kept silent.

“Are you bored in the temple? Why not let me take you around?” Elder Hua said as she smiled charmingly.

But her smile just made Ye Qingtang’s hair stand on end.

Since when were they this courteous?

What a joke.

To someone of their standing, accidentally capturing someone from the First Domain was akin to accidentally killing an ant.

How would someone from the First Domain ever be important to them?

She didn’t have to think at all to know that her special treatment was only due to their suspicions of her identity.

“Thank you.” Ye Qingtang had thought things through as well. They weren’t going to believe her no matter how much she denied it, so she would just pretend that she had lost her memory. They would have their methods of determining the truth anyway, so all she had to do was cooperate with them.

She would be able to leave after they confirmed that she wasn’t the reincarnation of their Holy Lord.

This oppressive feeling... was terrible.
