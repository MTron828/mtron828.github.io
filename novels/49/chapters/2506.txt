Ye Qingtang could feel the power of the Divine Concealment Spell slowly fading, probably due to the issue of her making contact with the Deity Ocean. Even though it wasn’t fading fast, the spell was going to fade soon if she continued concealing the big yellow dog as well as the Blood Moon Elder.

If that happened, there was only death waiting for them.

Of course, she had no idea if the demon palm would even kill a dog, but she knew that the big yellow dog would not be able to deal with the demon palm.

Moreover, the entity underground had yet to show itself. Just its hand had managed to demonstrate such terrible might, even forcing Ye Qingtang to use the Deity Ocean. This was enough to show how powerful it was.

“Holy Lady… is the hand unable to see us now?” the Blood Moon Elder said as he looked at her.

Hearing that, the big yellow dog threw him a look and said, “Does that hand look like it has eyes? Even without the Divine Concealment Spell, it wouldn’t be able to see us. It exists underground and is using our aura to find us.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“So this means that not only do we have to hide ourselves, we have to conceal our auras as well?” the Blood Moon Elder said in surprise.

How was it possible to have powers that could even conceal one’s aura in this world? Wouldn’t that make the person invincible?

If someone was able to completely hide their presence and aura, wouldn’t this mean that they would be completely invincible? They could escape easily and never be assassinated as well.

The big yellow dog nodded slightly and said, “You can see it that way, but the reality is different. There exists the perfect concealment spell but not someone who can control it perfectly.”

Just like what the big yellow dog had said, the Divine Concealment Spell was perfect, but the prerequisite to executing it perfectly was that the user had to be flawless. Up till the present day, there were only three people who had been able to use it perfectly. But even these three had not been able to achieve a state of invincibility.

To be truly invincible required great power. How would anyone dare to declare themselves invincible just because of the concealment spell? The Divine Concealment Spell was only an adjunct.

“How long can you hold on for?” the big yellow dog asked Ye Qingtang.

Hearing that, she shook her head and said, “I’m not sure, but not for too long.”

As soon as she had used up the power of the Deity Ocean, the Divine Concealment Spell would vanish as well.

“Holy Lady, the demon palm seems to know where we are!” The Blood Moon Elder saw that the demon palm showed no intentions of distraction and quickly told Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang could see this clearly even without a reminder from him. She had not even mastered the Divine Concealment Spell properly. Furthermore, the entity hiding underground was no ordinary person. To escape it completely was impossible.

The entity could sense where they were but couldn’t pinpoint their exact location and capture them, so they were safe for now.

“So those two were able to completely conceal their aura…”

In the space above them, the elder holding the gold book seemed to be in deep thought.

“Haha, our Lord seems to have fully awoken and seems to have taken an interest in the two of them,” another elder said with a laugh.
