Chapter 2694: Customer, Do You Want To Buy Something? (2)

At that moment, all the Great Immortal Temple disciples were staring at the skeleton with shocked expressions. This skeleton could actually communicate with them via mental voice transmission. It was unimaginable.

“This skeleton can actually talk!” Wan Rong exclaimed.

“Wait, did you hear what it just said? It said that it’s the shopkeeper of this shop!”

“Indeed, it did say that. I heard it.”

Everyone thought that this dilapidated ancient city was a dead place and no living creature would appear. Who would have expected that such a creature would appear in this shop filled with Heaven-level divine weapons? And it even claimed to be the shopkeeper.

However, after careful consideration, the skeleton could not be considered a living thing. How could a skeleton be considered alive?

“Let me ask you, what is this place and what are you?”

Lan Shan shouted coldly at the skeleton.

“Customer... Do you require a weapon...”

The skeleton in the shop kept repeating the same words, as if it would not answer any question not regarding the weapons in the shop.

“Strange...” Lan Shan was deep in thought. This place was too strange.

“Can we take away the Heaven-level divine weapons?” Ye Qingtang suddenly asked the skeleton.

The skeleton opened its mouth after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words. “This is a low-tier ancient city and only sells Heaven-level divine weapons. If you want to obtain a higher-level weapon, please head to a middle-tier or high-tier ancient city... A low-tier ancient city’s Heaven-level divine weapon is priced between 10 to 50 cursed points. After the required cursed points are successfully deducted, you can bring a Heaven-level divine weapon away from here.”

The Great Immortal Temple disciples looked at each other. The skeleton had offered so much information just now. They needed time to slowly digest everything.

“Low-tier, mid-tier... and high-tier ancient cities. What does that mean?” The purple-haired youth looked somewhat surprised.

“Congratulations, lucky cultivators. There are many magical ancient cities here. If you find an ancient city, you will be able to obtain a large number of supplies. Even if you lose your limbs, as long as you have enough cursed points, you can quickly recover after paying up the corresponding points. However, no matter how many cursed points you obtain, if you cannot find an ancient city, you will not be able to spend your points,” the skeleton explained to everyone.

“Cursed points?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lan Shan and the rest were stunned. They did not know what cursed points were at all.

“It probably can be understood as currency,” Ye Qingtang said to Lan Shan and the rest after pondering for a moment.

“Interesting...” One of the youths smiled. ” I roughly understand what this skeleton is talking about. In this realm, there should be many similar ancient cities. And every ancient city has different treasures. For example, this ancient city has Heaven-level divine weapons as well as other enchanted treasures. Perhaps another ancient city has other things. We can use cursed points to buy them... ”

“Yes, your analysis is right. It makes sense... You said exactly what I was thinking.” Lan Shan nodded at the young man.

The young man looked awkward when he heard that. He turned to Lan Shan and said, “Senior Brother Lan Shan is truly intelligent...”
