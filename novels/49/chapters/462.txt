Chapter 463: Demon Subduing Pagoda (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ji Yixuan frowned deeply without saying anything to Yue Tiancheng.

The force of destruction was slowly beginning to condense in the Kingdom of God. If he still did not think of a way to escape, he would probably lose his life here.

Yue Tiancheng sneered as though he had seen through Ji Yixuan’s thoughts. “Ji Yixuan, this array formation can only be broken from the outside. It is already considered a miracle that you could create a crack in the Kingdom of God from the inside with the sword intent earlier on. Now, your weapon is already broken, and there is no way you can condense the force of the sword intent anymore, much less escape from here. Just kill that thought.”

Then, Yue Tiancheng walked to another side. The corners of his lips tugged up slightly as he looked at the Demon Subduing Pagoda in the golden light. He waved his right arm over it, and the golden light faded away.

He placed the Demon Subduing Pagoda which had returned to its original size into his palm.

“Not bad… The dharma treasure of Falling Sky Valley’s division valley master, Perfected Xuanchen, is indeed not bad. However, it belongs to us, Yunxiao Sect now.” Yue Tiancheng laughed.

“Don’t you dare!” Fury emerged in Ji Yixuan’s eyes.

The Demon Subduing Pagoda was given to him by his Master, Perfected Xuanchen, to protect his life. How could it end up in the hands of their mortal enemy, Yunxiao Sect!

“Hahaha.” Yue Tiancheng could not help but scoff. “The Demon Subduing Pagoda is already in my hands now. Do you think I dare or not?”

Before waiting for Ji Yixuan to say anything, Yue Tiancheng waved a hand and intercepted him. “Ji Yixuan, instead of wasting saliva like this, why not think of how to escape from there?”

As Yue Tiancheng finished his sentence, the pressure of the spirit energy in the Kingdom of God skyrocketed and materialized into an inexplicable breath of destruction.

The force of it was like the descent of countless mountains which suppressed Ji Yixuan tightly, causing his breaths to quicken and face to flush. Before long, Ji Yixuan could no longer hold it in and fell on the floor with a “thump” as cold sweat dripped down his forehead like a broken pearl necklace.

On a slope several hundred meters away, Ye Qingtang was looking ahead at that instant.

“Yue Tiancheng…”

After she saw that small disciple of the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master, her fists were tightly clenched, and she strongly desired to skin him alive!

In her previous lifetime, she was wounded by Yue Tiancheng a few times and almost lost her life in all encounters.

After Nine Nights Dynasty was wiped out, Yunxiao Sect combined forces with other super sects of Formidable Heavens Dynasty to attack Falling Sky Valley. Yue Tiancheng’s hands were stained with the blood of all her senior and junior brothers!

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang calmed her heart down and looked at Ji Yixuan.

She never thought that she would meet Ji Yixuan, the disciple of her Master who had already passed on in her previous life, of Falling Sky Valley today.

Back then, Ye Qingtang entered Falling Sky Valley and cultivated beside Perfected Xuanchen. Thus, she naturally had heard of these past events.

Ji Yixuan came to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty to obtain the Regeneration Stone.

The Regeneration Stone possessed the powers of renewing the bones of a dying person. The Valley Master of Falling Sky Valley was heavily injured from a battle a decade ago. He was already of old age now and had a sudden illness. He could only keep his life with that Regeneration Stone.

In her previous life, the Regeneration Stone that Ji Yixuan obtained along with the Demon Subduing Pagoda fell into Yunxiao Sect’s hands together. Because the Regeneration Stone was too rare, Perfected Xuanchen could not find another one even when he personally searched for it, which resulted in the eventual death of Falling Sky Valley’s Valley Master.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ji Yixuan who was over a hundred meters away. He was sealed in the array formation, and the force of destruction in it had already caused him to gasp for air. She was afraid that Ji Yixuan would die in the array in no time.

Based on skills, Ji Yixuan was one of Falling Sky Valley’s geniuses and had comprehended the sword intent as well as the Worldly Self-Illusion. Under normal circumstances, Yue Tiancheng of Yunxiao Sect was definitely not his opponent.
