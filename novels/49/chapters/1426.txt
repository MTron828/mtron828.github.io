1427 Domain Monarch Jiang Family 2

Jiang Liu led Ye You and Ye Xun out of the hall and passed through the luxurious courtyard. Very quickly, Elder Xu came into sight.

Behind Elder Xu was a huge ape that was badly battered and appeared very weak while a stunning girl with a slender frame was beside him.

That girl had a pale complexion, and her clothes were stained with a lot of blood.

Elder Xu wanted to tell them something.

Jiang Liu turned around to look at Ye You and said, “Is it her?”

Seeing the miserable-looking Ye Qingtang, Ye You was pleased but had an obedient expression.

“Yes, uncle.”

Jiang Liu nodded slightly and stepped forward subsequently. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Elder Xu.”

Elder Xu could not stop himself from smiling when he saw Jiang Liu.

“You’re here just in time. I have something to tell you. This girl…”

Jiang Liu sized up Ye Qingtang and chuckled. “We have troubled you today, Elder Xu. It is thoughtful of you to bring the people who offended You back for her to deal with them. Leave the rest to me.”

Jiang Liu said and wanted to seize Ye Qingtang.

Elder Xu was taken aback.

Beidou Demon Lord, who had been doubtful throughout the journey, heard what Jiang Liu said, and his expression changed immediately. He protected Ye Qingtang hurriedly.

“Great. You humans are indeed despicable! You all clearly deceived my little sister here to torture her to death!”

“No…” Elder Xu attempted to explain instantly.

But at this instant, Jiang Liu appeared to Ye Qingtang’s front in a flash and held her shoulder forcefully.

“Look clearly, You. I will break the neck of this person who offended you right now,” Jiang Liu said with a smile.

Ye You’s lips curled up into a smile as she looked at Ye Qingtang arrogantly.

The only thing to blame was that Ye Qingtang did not know what was good for her. How dare she appear before her?

But just when Jiang Liu was about to twist Ye Qingtang’s neck, Elder Xu suddenly attacked and forced Jiang Liu to retreat, saving Ye Qingtang.

“Elder Xu, what are you doing?” Jiang Liu did not expect Elder Xu to suddenly attack and frowned immediately.

Elder Xu was about to speak, but Ye Qingtang held onto her own neck and looked at Elder Xu with indignation. “You all… indeed lied to me. You said that I’m part of the Jiang Family because you wanted to deceive me into coming to the Jiang Residence to kill me in front of Ye You.”

“You? Part of the Jiang Family? Ye Qingtang, you really think too highly of yourself. Who are you to dare to cling to the Jiang Family?” Ye Xun looked at the miserable Ye Qingtang and said sarcastically,

“What are you? A bastard born from a piece of garbage. The likes of you to cling to the Jiang Family.”

“Shut up!” Elder Xu growled suddenly.

Ye Xun shuddered from Elder Xu’s growl.

Elder Xu glared at Ye Xun. If Ye Xun was not a person who Ye You kept by her side, everything she said earlier was sufficient for him to crush her to death.

“Elder… Elder Xu…” Ye Xun trembled slightly, and she hid behind Ye You out of instinct.

She did not know what thing she said was wrong enough to infuriate Elder Xu.

Elder Xu could not be bothered with Ye Xun, an outsider. If Ye You did not bring her along, how would Ye Xun have the qualifications to enter the door of their Jiang Family?

“Don’t be afraid, girl. I am here. Jiang Liu scared you because he does not know the situation. Don’t worry. Everything will be fine once I explain the situation to him.” Elder Xu turned around to look at Ye Qingtang and comforted her gently. His tone was exactly like that of a compassionate senior, and it was utterly different from his imposing manner toward Ye Xun.
