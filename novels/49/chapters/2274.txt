Chapter 2275: Black Snake (2)

It could be said that those two never really got the chance to meet.

This was the first time the Night Soul Beast saw the real form of the black snake.

Once the black snake attacked, it would be a senseless killing machine. It only knew to keep attacking. So it was natural the Night Soul Beasts would never go provoking this kind of dangerous being.

But now…

The Night Soul Beast was despondent.

Ye Qingtang dived straight into the herd of Night Soul Beasts, closely followed by that black snake, who pounced with its jaws wide open.

As she was petite, she managed to squeeze into a gap right between a few Night Soul Beasts. But that black snake was massive and one snap of its jaws slashed the bodies of those Night Soul Beasts into halves.

Night Soul Beasts were not made of flesh and blood. They consumed souls for food and their bodies were only part-matter.

Attacked in the middle of their hibernation, those Night Soul Beasts immediately woke up. When they came to their senses, they realized that it was the black snake, the guardian of the next-door treasure trove, that was attacking them!

“Roar!!” Those Night Soul Beasts who were injured gave warning roars.

The Night Soul Beasts and black snake were two different races and they had always stayed out of each other’s way. Who would have thought that the black snake would suddenly attack them!

Those Night Soul Beasts were very big and after being enraged by the attack, they were completely oblivious to the guilty party hidden amongst them.

The black snake was still focused on Ye Qingtang. It would only pursue those who took a treasure. It had no interest in those Night Soul Beasts at all.

The black snake opened its jaws again and attacked the spot where Ye Qingtang was hidden.

Those Night Soul Beasts saw that the black snake was attacking once more and immediately roared again. Their roars were like thunder, echoing throughout the entire cave.

The other slumbering Night Soul Beasts were awakened by those roars. In the blink of an eye, countless Night Soul Beasts were awakened.

The Night Soul Beasts had no idea what was happening. They just knew that right after waking up, they saw the black snake attacking their own kind.

The Night Soul Beasts all roared in unison.

One-on-one, they were no match for the black snake but they had an advantage in numbers now. They would never actively provoke the black snake but now that it was madly attacking them, they would not just lay down and wait for death.

In the blink of an eye, countless Night Soul Beasts pounced toward the “mad” black snake.

Soon enough, the colossal body of the black snake was engulfed by countless Night Soul Beasts.

The black snake was powerful but those Night Soul Beasts were no weaklings either. And they had numbers on their side. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

In addition, the Night Soul Beasts’ bodies were only half-solid and they could not be completely eradicated. For a moment there, the black snake was trapped by all those beasts, unable to shake them off.

Ye Qingtang saw that her plan had worked. Not daring to delay a second longer, she grabbed her Night Soul Beast and fled out of the cave.

She did not dare to leave her Night Soul Beast, who knew what had really happened, behind in the cave. If it ratted her out to its friends, wouldn’t both the black snake and Night Soul Beasts chase her to the ends of the earth?

Ye Qingtang understood now.

The black snake and Night Soul Beasts were both guardians of the tomb. But the two of them did not interact at all.

It was because of this that such a fortuitous misunderstanding had arisen.
