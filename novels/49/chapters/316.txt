Chapter 317: Ranking Chart (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Since I am in the ring, I also have a target whom I wish to challenge,” Lin Feng suddenly said with a smile. Then, he raised his sword and pointed its tip at the first person in the outer sect, Ji Xianyuan!

“Senior Brother Ji, are you willing to come up and exchange a few moves as a teaching?”

With that said, everyone below the ring cheered immediately.

Lin Feng defeated Yuan Wei with only four moves, and this shocked everyone. Now that he actually wanted to challenge Ji Xianyuan, the number one on the ranking chart, it would really be a highlight match in the outer sect!

In the observation tower, there was no expression on Elder Lin’s face and only a hint of satisfaction in his eyes as he watched Lin Feng’s arrogance.

How could his grandson be satisfied with a third place?

Ji Xianyuan was called out by Lin Feng before everyone. This was the first time someone dared to challenge him since the first day of the inner sect assessment. With everyone’s cheers, Ji Xianyuan slowly walked up to the ring with a calm expression.

Lin Feng’s lips curled into a smile as he watched Ji Xianyuan walk up the arena.

“Please offer me some teachings, Senior Brother Ji!” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Ji Xianyuan cast Lin Feng a cold look and said calmly, “You may attack first, Junior Brother Lin.”

Ever since Ji Xianyuan first entered the ranking chart, he had never been defeated in any match. His position on the ranking chart only moved up and never fell. After he topped the ranking chart, no one could shake his position regardless of who challenged him.

Lin Feng was really the only person in this past year who dared to challenge Ji Xianyuan’s number one position!

However, everyone witnessed Lin Feng’s improvements this year. Everyone was stirred by this fierce struggle between two equally-matched opponents as they watched the intense battle that was about to happen soon without blinking an eye.

Lin Feng narrowed his eyes. A sharp expression passed by his eyes briefly as he looked at the composed and steady Ji Xianyuan. However, he was not anxious to attack. He was not Yuan Wei, who only knew to act rashly. Just as Lin Feng was quietly observing Ji Xianyuan, he suddenly grabbed an opportunity and leaped forward with his sword pointing at Ji Xianyuan’s skull!

There was no emotion in Ji Xianyuan’s eyes. Looking at the sword that was in close proximity, he did not dodge at all. Right when the crowd was nervous, he suddenly threw out a punch at the last second when the sword was about to touch him!

This punch accurately landed on the hand which Lin Feng held the sword in. What seemed like a light punch, however, snapped the sword out of Lin Feng’s hand!

The sword that left Lin Feng’s hand gleamed in the midair. Before Lin Feng could react, Ji Xianyuan’s upper body was bent forward slightly, and he landed a fierce punch on Ji Xianyuan’s stomach!

With just a punch, Lin Feng was forced backward. His face turned white in an instant, and cold sweat trickled down from his forehead.

There was dead silence below the ring. No one expected that Ji Xianyuan could cause Lin Feng to pale in just two moves. Just looking at Lin Feng’s contorted expression, it was easy to know how heavy that punch was!

These were the skills of the number one on the ranking chart.

A powerful combat ability that could be comparable to that of an inner sect disciple’s!

Lin Feng panted faintly. Forcefully straightening himself, he looked at the emotionless Ji Xianyuan opposite of him.

“Senior Brother Ji is indeed powerful. I admit defeat.” No matter how unwilling he was, he clearly saw how frightening the gap between him and Ji Xianyuan was. Even if he continued fighting, he would only be embarrassing himself.

After hearing Lin Feng’s words, Ji Xianyuan turned around and walked down the ring silently as though nothing ever happened just now.
