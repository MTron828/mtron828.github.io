Chapter 2179: Gathered (3)

As usual, Ye Qingtang had Qin Feng and Yun Chen tell her about the cultivation techniques which they had practiced before.

Yun Chen’s cultivation techniques were more or less normal. When Qin Feng spouted out a whole list of high-level techniques, all the other teenagers were completely stunned.

“Damn, is Qin Feng some kind of freak? He is still so young but has already practiced those techniques?” Just hearing the list of Qin Feng’s techniques was enough to make Lei Yan feel like kneeling on the floor and kowtowing. Those techniques were extremely profound and he had tried a couple before. But he was unable to comprehend a single thing and ended up giving up.

But Qin Feng had practiced those techniques to at least the fifth level.

Nangong Lie crossed his hands behind his head. “You are right. Qin Feng was already famous before entering the Netherworld Academy. If not for the fact that his powers suddenly regressed, he would probably be at least at the Divine Lord stage.”

Those at the Divine Lord level were all famously powerful practitioners. And Qin Feng was still in his teens.

In the entire Netherworld Academy, the number of people who could reach the Divine Lord level before the age of 20 could be counted on one hand. Apart from those freaks ranked in the top 10, no one else would even dare to dream of such an achievement.

Lei Yan gasped at Nangong Lie’s words. But on second thought, he asked quietly, “Why did Qin Feng’s powers suddenly regress?”

Nangong Lie shrugged. “No one knows. The President personally checked him over but didn’t find anything strange. His powers just kept declining, he is only at the Paragon Eight Heaven level now. I think that it is still regressing.”

The continuous decline of a person’s powers was a very strange problem.

Ye Qingtang did not discover anything weird in Qin Feng’s practice methods. So it appeared that the problem lay with himself. She called Qin Feng over to her side and made use of her Deity Ocean to probe his body condition.

Qin Feng’s physical condition looked rather normal but when Ye Qingtang used the power of her Deity Ocean to analyze his body, she discovered that he had hidden chaotic energy inside him, which was constantly diluting his own spirit energy.

“Chaotic mental demon...” Ye Qingtang was stunned.

Qin Feng looked at Ye Qingtang with confusion.

Ye Qingtang furrowed her brows slightly. There were countless young talented prodigies in the world. But few of those who became famous when they were young, would eventually develop to become truly elite powerful practitioners.

The reason was because many of those talented teenagers would develop a terrifying type of mental demon after reaching a certain stage.

These mental demons were undetectable. It was only 200 years later that a certain mighty practitioner discovered the existence of these deeply hidden mental demons.

The symptoms of chaotic mental demons varied from person to person. Some went completely mad, some ended up destroying their energy channels and becoming paralyzed...

Qin Feng’s situation appeared to be the second type. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

And all practitioners who developed chaotic mental demons had a common point...

Their bloodlines were very aggressive and ferocious.

For example, the Jiang family’s Heavenly Demon Bloodline also had a certain chance of developing chaotic mental demons. If Ye Qingtang remembered correctly, the Qin family’s bloodline was called the Killer Bloodline...

The Killer Bloodline had a very high ferocity. There were already a number of prodigies in the Qin family who during their prime, suddenly lost their senses and went into a murderous rampage, attacking even their own kin.
