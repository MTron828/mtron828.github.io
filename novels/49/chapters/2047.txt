Chapter 2048: Underground World (2)

You Qiong had requested to come with them because of that.

No one knew the Ancient You Clan better than him.

Feeling that You Qiong’s idea was a good one, Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo disguised their appearances. Ye Qingtang disguised as Elder Mo since she had already taken Elder Mo’s space ring previously. On the other hand, Ning Luo disguised as one of the wardens under Elder Mo.

“Holy Lord, the Ancient You Clan has a strict grade system. Though Elder Mo is one of Ancient You Clan’s elders, from what I know, he’s not highly ranked. Most of the inner sect elders had already moved here long ago...” You Qiong briefly explained in case Ye Qingtang didn’t know about the Ancient You Clan’s structure.

The Ancient You Clan’s elders had different grades. The inner sect elders were of higher rank, followed by elders in charge of legislative matters and martial arts.

Ye Qingtang previously met those elders who were promoted at a later stage and were of lower rank.

They would only have the opportunity to come into contact with the core members of the Ancient You Clan once they enter the west region. Ever since they had gained control of the Spiritual Abode, they had been cultivating and absorbing energy from the Spiritual Abode. Even You Qiong had no idea how powerful they had gotten.

Above the elders were the Clan Elder and Grand Elder...

The Ancient You Clan’s Grand Elder and the Domain Monarch Founder were equally powerful and still remained powerful up until now.

Now, the Clan Master was merely holding a temporary position in the Ancient You Clan. The ones truly controlling the Ancient You Clan were the Clan Elder and Grand Elder.

“Holy Lord, you have to be careful once we enter the Ancient You Clan.” You Qiong looked at Ye Qingtang with a serious expression.

Ye Qingtang nodded, she certainly knew she had to keep her guard up.

After making sure everything was clear for them, You Qiong took Ye Qingtang and Ning Luo to the entrance of the Ancient You Clan. Right beneath the barely noticeable summit was a discreet cave.

They walked into the cave and weren’t able to find anything even after walking for a long time. However, Ye Qingtang noticed the ground beneath them was a slope.

Which meant that they were walking downwards, going underground.

After a long journey, You Qiong noticed a huge stone door hidden deep inside the cave. The stone door was covered in moss, with Ye Qingtang noticing that the corners of the stone door were missing some moss.

Looking at Ye Qingtang, You Qiong whispered, “Give me a minute.”

With that, You Qiong walked in front and studied the totem on the door. He lifted his arm, pressing the door with a pattern. Right after he did that, the stone door opened, just like that.

The Ancient You Clan’s guards appeared fully armed behind the stone door. When they noticed the door was ajar, they looked at You Qiong and the others warily.

They only put away their weapons when they saw Ye Qingtang, who was disguised as Elder Mo. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Elder Mo.”

With a domineering demeanor, Ye Qingtang nodded and walked through the stone door with You Qiong and Ning Luo.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes widened when she saw what was behind the stone door.
