Chapter 1986: The Arrival of the Crimson League (2)

Busy admiring her craft, annoyance flashed across the face of the alien race lady as she was interrupted. She merely glanced at Xue Fu and uttered two words.

“Get lost.”

Still, Xue Fu steeled himself and refused to leave.

He didn’t care whether the Ancient Clan people lived or died but now that they were under the care of the Holy Lord of Shadows, it would cast doubt on the Holy Lord of Shadows’s reputation if they died.

“Lady Bai Zhi, please have some mercy on us.”

“You recognize me?” the alien race lady said as she raised her brows.

Xue Fu said, “I had the honor of meeting your grace many years ago in the Crimson League.”

“Hm. To think that you dare interrupt my joy even when you know who I am? I see that Mo Yao hasn’t been taking good care of this place, seeing as she is mixing with humans now. I’ll help her out then.” Murderous intent flashed across Bai Zhi’s eyes.

Xue Fu’s expression turned ugly.

At that moment, the person in the black robes spoke up.

“Let’s get down to business.”

The voice that came out of the figure was otherworldly, as though it was coming from a dream. Just hearing it was enough to make their hair stand on end.

Bai Zhi narrowed her eyes but did not rebut this. With a wave of her hand, she dispersed the mist, sparing the lives of the Ancient Clan people.

Xue Fu sighed in relief and looked at the person in black robes. “I was not informed that ambassadors from the Crimson League would be arriving. Let us move into the main hall and I will inform the Holy Lord.”

The person in black robes nodded slightly and without another word, moved the three of them into the Temple of Shadows with the black mist. Xue Fu instructed Lady Ghost to take care of the Ancient Clan people and quickly headed over to inform Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was still waiting for Lady Ghost to report back to her and was surprised to see Xue Fu instead.

“Holy Lord, ambassadors from the Crimson League are waiting for you in the main hall,” Xue Fu informed her with a difficult expression.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

They were already here?

Although she was extremely surprised, she maintained a calm expression on the surface.

“Who’s here?”

“There are three of them. I don’t recognize two but one of them... is Lady Bai Zhi.” Xue Fu couldn’t help but look at Ye Qingtang’s expression as he mentioned Bai Zhi’s name.

But what expression could she even show?

She didn’t know any of them.

Her face remained expressionless.

Xue Fu gritted his teeth and said, “The Ancient Clan people walked out to take a look when the three of them arrived but this angered Lady Bai Zhi and she killed a few of them...” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang was truly in despair now.

This really was a double-edged sword.

They had slaughtered people under her watch even before making a move against the Ancient You Clan?

Seeing Ye Qingtang frown, Xue Fu quickly spoke. “Please do not be angry, Holy Lord. Lady Bai Zhi and the Holy Lord have not seen eye to eye for a long time but we do not know her intention for coming forward this time. Holy Lord, please take this into consideration.”

So the Holy Lord of Shadows and Lady Ba Zhi had discord between them?

Ye Qingtang was stunned. She had no idea where this Bai Zhi was from but was surprised that she could go up against the Holy Lord of Shadows. Of course, the Crimson League would send some powerful people over.

After taking some time to think things through, Ye Qingtang started walking towards the main hall.

The eight tribe leaders and other important people of the Temple of Shadows were all gathered in the main hall by the time she arrived. Even Ming Gu who rarely showed himself was in the main hall, his eyes submissive as he looked at Bai Zhi.

Bai Zhi smiled as she saw Ming Wang and Ming Gu and said jokingly, “Hm? The two of you haven’t been killed by Mo Yao yet?”

Gritting his teeth, Ming Gu was held back as Ming Wang grabbed his arm.
