Although Yun Shu did regain consciousness after the emergency treatment, he was still in a very bad condition. His body was so weak that he could not even stand still, and his hands were impaired from using them to crawl back to the sect such that it would be extremely strenuous for him to wield a sword in the future.

The physician treated Yun Shu while sighing in pity at the same time.

“Physician, how are Senior Brother Yun’s injuries?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown.

The Physician sighed. “The wound on his chest is very deep, but it is fortunate that his heart was not affected, and his life is not in danger. However…” The Physician held his words back and only continued after a while. “His injuries have been dragged on for too long. He probably crawled all the way back to the sect, and there are too many wounds all over. His knee joints and hands are severely wounded and too much blood was lost. This would implicate his spirit root is damaged, and in the future…”

The Physician did not finish his sentence and merely shook his head regretfully.

Yun Shu was born with good natural endowments, and if he had not met with this accident, he definitely would have achieved many things in the future.

However, there were numerous injuries this time. There might be many effects even after he recovered. Thus, he might not progress much in the future.

It was really a pity.

Ye Qingtang clenched her fists tightly and frowned.

This was how the Senior Brother Yun in her previous life fell into a slump.

The once talented youth who had a bright future ahead of him was now… destroyed by Lu Xiuwen!

“Junior Sister Ye… I want to go… I want to unveil… Lu Xiuwen’s disgusting face… in front of everyone,” Yun Shu said with difficulty as he clenched his teeth. For the first time, there was hatred in his warm eyes.

He would never forget the moment when Lu Xiuwen attacked him.

They were clearly brothers from the same sect, yet Lu Xiuwen wanted to kill Yun Shu just to snatch the Shangyue Fire Tripod from Yun Shu!

Ye Qingtang frowned even more deeply as she looked at Yun Shu’s current state. In her previous life, Yun Shu must have been through this as well. Otherwise, he would not have ended up like that.

However…

A few years later, Lu Xiuwen was still doing well in the outer sect and even became the best outer sect disciple. Evidently, Yun Shu’s report failed.

Lu Xiuwen definitely must have made full preparations long ago, and even if Yun Shu reported the case to the warden, there was no way he could ensure Lu Xiuwen to be convicted.

“Please help me to bring my senior brother to the Disciplinary Hall. I will head there soon,” Ye Qingtang said to the Physician slowly and quietly took a piece of Yun Shu’s blood-stained clothes from behind her. There was a flicker in the eyes of the Blood Moon Sect Elder, who had been following beside Ye Qingtang, when he saw Ye Qingtang’s actions.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang took her leave, the Blood Moon Sect Elder followed after her immediately. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang did not go to the Disciplinary Hall straight but instead headed for the dormitory that the new disciples were staying in!

…

Many disciples were surrounded in the Disciplinary Hall, and the outer sect elder in charge of discipline frowned at the two disciples before him.

“Yun Shu, you said that Lu Xiuwen secretly attacked you and stole your Shangyue Fire Tripod when you were severely injured after you all finished your mission. Is this true?”

In the big hall of the Disciplinary Hall, the pale Yun Shu was standing with difficulty while being supported by another disciple. Blood seeped out from the bandage around his chest. His lips were so pale that there was no color at all, and his legs were trembling uncontrollably as his body was overly weak.

“Elder, everything I said is true. It was Lu Xiuwen who led me to a deserted area and suddenly attacked me. After severely injuring me, he snatched the Shangyue Fire Tripod away.”
