Chapter 1604: Parasite (1)

Toby and the others led Ye Qingtang to the square. Shooting a knowing look to his friends nearby, he subsequently turned to look at Ye Qingtang and spoke.

“This is our training grounds.”

Just as Ye Qingtang looked up, a bolt of light suddenly shot toward her. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With a clang, an arrow narrowly grazed past Ye Qingtang’s cheek and stuck into a pillar behind her.

“Ah! Sorry, you’re too small. I didn’t see you just now. I’m really sorry.” A tall and well-built male who wielded a bow seemed to be apologetic toward Ye Qingtang.

Although he seemed to be apologizing, there was absolutely no sign of remorse or regret. Instead, his face was full of smiles.

“Did you see that? That parasite is stunned. She’s not even moving an inch.”

“That was really nasty of Joseph. But I like it. Hahaha...”

All the Kingdom Knights guffawed at the scene before them, clearly treating Ye Qingtang as a clown they could make fun of.

Toby added on as well. “Everyone is focused on their training in the training grounds. Tang, your head’s too small, and it’ll be very easy for someone to lose sight of you. You must be careful. Otherwise, you have no one to blame if you are accidentally injured.”

Accidentally injured?

The little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms gritted its sharp fangs.

That arrow was clearly aimed at Ye Qingtang.

This group of people simply had ill intentions when they called Ye Qingtang to the square.

“Tang really hasn’t grown up. She’s carrying a little animal wherever she goes.” Toby and the others laid their eyes on the little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms. In this world where white tigers did not exist, they instinctively assumed it to be a strange-looking big cat.

A petite girl carried a big cat around wherever she went—how was this what a Kingdom Knight should look like?

If more people saw Ye Qingtang, the Kingdom Knight title would be tarnished by her.

As that thought surfaced in everyone’s minds, their dissatisfaction toward Ye Qingtang intensified.

Ye Qingtang was utterly expressionless as she watched the scene before her.

Toby and the rest thought that Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck and were very pleased with this outcome. They wanted to let her know how powerful the Kingdom Knights were and that she was not worthy of having such a title.

“Tang, you haven’t been to training these few days. Why don’t I spar with you as a warm-up?” Toby asked while harboring evil intentions.

The Kingdom Knights in the surrounding cheered.

“Toby, you must go easy on her. Otherwise, this little fellow’s bones will be crushed by your punch.”

“Haha, Toby, why must you make things difficult for Tang? Didn’t you see that she’s about to cry from the shock?”

Ye Qingtang, who was about to “cry from the shock”, looked at the sarcastic faces around her. Without a word, she placed the little white tiger down and turned to look at Toby. “How do you want to spar?”

“Toby, Tang has already agreed to it. You must guide her well.”

Everyone erupted into laughter as in their eyes, Ye Qingtang was just courting death.

They could make use of this opportunity to teach this parasite a lesson.

Toby’s smile was exceptionally mean as he looked at Ye Qingtang. “Anything. However, Tang, you know that we use real weapons and are very serious when we train. Having some accidental injuries will be unavoidable.”
