Chapter 2044: Spiritual Abode

You Qiong looked calmly at the seething Elder Mo.

Elder Mo shivered when You Qiong looked at him, as everything that didn’t add up previously flooded into his mind.

Hadn’t they robbed the Temple of Shadows based on his information?

And after that...

He was the one who had volunteered to go to the Temple of Shadows to beg the Crimson League for mercy as well...

So the Holy Lord of Shadows had been orchestrating this from behind the shadows all this time!

“You Qiong, you!” Elder Mo yelled. He hadn’t expected a dog he had kept by his side to bite him.

But he was stomped to the ground by Ye Qingtang before he could keep cursing at him. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What’s wrong with him being loyal to me?” She looked coldly at Elder Mo on the ground, who was sweating coldly.

After all, his life was in her hands right now and he didn’t dare complain anymore. He could only lower his head silently.

She ignored him. He was only being left alive so that she could question him.

She broke the lock with her hands and handed several healing elixirs to You Qiong. Taking the elixirs, he was finally able to calm himself slightly.

Ye Qingtang looked at the terrified demon cubs. Even though she had already heard of their plight from You Qiong, it was still difficult for her to see it herself.

Without saying a word, she freed them all from their cell.

The demon cubs were all scared out of their wits. During this time, they had seen the human race kill their parents, eat their friends and skin them alive. Their fear towards the human race had reached a peak.

They couldn’t suppress the fear in their hearts even though they were facing Ye Qingtang. But they were rather dependent on You Qiong, who had shared some of his food with them out of pity.

“Stay here and take care of them,” Ye Qingtang said as she handed more medicine to him.

He took the medication from her.

She looked at his battered face, which was barely recognizable. She had originally planned to make him a mask after bringing him back to the temple so that Mi would not recognize him.

After all, she had killed him right in front of Mi.

But it seemed that that wouldn’t be necessary anymore.

Ming Di and the rest had already completely wiped out the Ancient You Clan youths when she left the camp, so she threw Elder Mo over to him to monitor. She then asked them to take away their space rings and look for other items they could take.

Soon enough, there were people reporting to her about a unique item in one of the tents. They wanted her to look at it as they were unsure of what it was.

She noticed that Elder Mo’s expression changed when they pointed to the tent.

Was it something important?

She immediately headed over.

In the tent was a huge Fire Tripod.

Rays of light were shining through it. It felt extremely familiar to her but she couldn’t quite place it.

“What is this?” she asked Elder Mo frostily.
