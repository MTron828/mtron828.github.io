Chapter 1101 I Will Certainly Protect You (3)

This turn of events gave Ye Qingtang a sense of relief.

The hidden ancient clan had too many Yang Lords. If just one of them refused to let her go, she would be unable to escape, and they could kill the two children. Now, with the protection of a heaven-level divine weapon, Ye Qingtang could stop worrying.

However, Ye Qingtang also knew that ever since the fall of the Divine King Luo Xue, the Regicide Sky Blade’s divine sense had been sealed again. Right now, the Regicide Sky Blade did not have much power left and might not be able to last for long.

“You have a death wish.”

A cold light glittered in the eyes of the golden-robed middle-aged man. He stepped forward. The entire Falling Sky Valley seemed to shudder violently.

The golden-robed man struck at Ye Qingtang. His sword stroke was one of incomparable martial willpower.

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply at the strength of this willpower.

The powerful cultivators from the ancient hidden clan did not have the power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven, but their martial arts foundation was very strong. Even Ye Qingtang did not dare to underestimate them.

In a moment, Ye Qingtang and the golden-robed man were embroiled in a sword duel.

In an instant, the two had exchanged a dozen blows.

As the long swords clashed, the ringing noise reverberated continually. The swords flashed repeatedly through the air as if it had become a country of swords.

The golden-robed man looked at Ye Qingtang with a trace of shock.

This young girl was only a Yin Yang Perfected Lord at the peak of the Seventh Heaven, but her true ability was on par with that of an Eighth Heaven Yin Yang Perfected Lord… Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Wow… the young geniuses in this mainland…” The golden-robed man looked thoughtful.

Considering Ye Qingtang’s age, she was already incredibly talented to attain the Seventh Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord…

To the golden-robed man, an ordinary Yang Lord was not even worth mentioning. But this girl was different.

“Heavenly Tyrant Technique!”

The golden-robed man suddenly bellowed in rage. A blinding golden glow surfaced on his body. His entire person seemed to explode with the light of a small sun.

At the same time, the golden-robed man once again raised the sword in his hand and struck at Ye Qingtang.

Clang!

A crisp ringing sound resounded in the void.

At that moment, a crimson glow surfaced all around Ye Qingtang. The figure of a Phoenix appeared behind her.

A pair of clear eyes that seemed to pierce through heaven and earth and a breath of ancient air rushed towards him.

As he felt a force pressing against his bloodline, the golden-robed man’s expression changed slightly, and he retreated.

However, Ye Qingtang did not give the golden-robed man any breathing space. She forced the power of her Phoenix Bloodline to its peak and used her person to oppress the golden-robed man.

“Humph!”

The golden-robed man grunted coldly. As Ye Qingtang drew near, he did not dodge but advanced instead.

“Haha… if you let me come near you, you will certainly die.”

The golden-robed man transformed into an illusion. When he reappeared, he had already caught hold of Ye Qingtang’s right arm.

When she heard that, Ye Qingtang’s lips curved upwards slightly and arched into a sly smile. “If I did not deliberately make a mistake, you couldn’t possibly touch me.”

The golden-robed man laughed coldly. “You are at death’s door and you still want to have the last word?! Now that I have caught you, you’re dead.” As he spoke, a trace of a black glow surfaced on the golden-robed man’s right palm. It was filled with a startling corrosive force.

This corrosive force could corrode a mountain, much less a body.
