Chapter 1255: Ambush (2)

At this instant, there was no emotion on Ye Qingtang’s face though she had already groaned numerous times on the inside.

She had felt that there was something strange when Ming Wang gave her the invitation. After all, given the Luo Family’s influence, it was still insufficient for the Holy Lord of Shadows to personally attend a birthday celebration.

She originally thought that Ming Wang intended to use this trip to let the Undead Clan following her observe her actions.

But looking at the situation now…

That was not the case at all!

This little rascal must have bluffed her here because he knew the Luo Family’s scheme from the start.

If she was truly the Holy Lord of Shadows, she would naturally be able to leave the Luo Residence safely given her skills. If she was fake, she would probably die without a doubt.

At this moment, Ye Qingtang gave her hats off to Ming Wang’s method to tell the authenticity of her identity.

She had long known that the Temple of Shadows was not so easy to trick.

Ye Qingtang did not reveal any emotions, but she secretly observed the situation on the battlefield.

Suo Mu and Hong Zhong of the twelve Saints were present, and their skills were comparable to that of Luo Qufeng’s. Logically speaking, they should be able to stop the Luo Family’s schemes. However…

Ye Qingtang did not think that things were so simple.

Luo Qufeng planned this from the start but still invited Suo Mu and Hong Zhong. Unless he was an idiot, he definitely would not involve people he could not defeat into his scheme.

Before this, Luo Qufeng’s aura was evidently different from rumors when he attacked while his evil cultivation technique to absorb other people’s powers was probably hidden for a long time. Most likely, he had greatly concealed his skills in the past thousand years.

Just as Ye Qingtang was worrying, there was a new situation on the battlefield.

Suo Mu and Hong Zhong joined forces against Luo Qufeng and thought that they would definitely be victorious. Yet, unexpectedly, Luo Qufeng’s skills soared suddenly and completely overthrew the both of them.

The two men increasingly felt a strain, and Luo Qufeng gained the upper hand after a hundred moves. He waved his hand suddenly, and a scarlet glow resembling a red sun smashed into the two men.

Boom, boom!!

Boom, boom!!

With two loud rumbles, Suo Mu and Hong Zhong crashed onto the ground by the overpowering force and spat out large mouthfuls of blood. They were clearly severely wounded by Luo Qufeng!

When the Luo Family members saw that Luo Qufeng triumphed over the two powerful figures, their arrogance soared!

“Luo Qufeng, you indeed hid your true skills!” Hong Zhong clutched onto his excruciatingly painful chest while frowning at the uninjured Luo Qufeng.

Flicking his sleeves, Luo Qufeng kept both hands behind him and towered over the two men whom he had known for years. “Hong Zhong, Suo Mu, we have thousands of years of friendship, and I will not forget it. Thus, how can today’s big event miss the two of you?”

Luo Qufeng laughed sinisterly right after. “Rest assured. I will not let you two feel too much pain. You all cultivated for thousands of years, but your skills have already come to a standstill, and it’s hard to have any greater progress. Why not give me your powers and let me use it instead? I will bring you all along with me to the true peak of powerful figures.”

“Pfft. Luo Qufeng, you are truly shameless. To think that I still treated you as a friend. I never thought that you were this sickening.” Suo Mu retorted coldly.

A cold look flashed across Luo Qufeng’s eyes, and he kicked Suo Mu on the chest violently. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Don’t disregard my kindness. It is your honor to be a part of me. Since you all are so stupid and stubborn, there’s no need for me to be polite with you all then.”
