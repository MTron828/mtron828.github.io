Chapter 2728: Returning To Her Era (6)

Han Cangming was possessed by Ling Yan.

Ling Yan brought back his body from this era and sealed Han Cangming’s soul for another 50 years.

According to the Blood Moon Elder, Han Cangming appeared once 50 years after Saint Ye Yue went missing. It must have been Han Cangming from that era who broke the seal and reappeared.

It had to be said that Ling Yan was really ruthless to himself.

The Han Cangming of that era was completely innocent. First, he was plotted against by his future self, then he was sealed and had to take the blame for Ling Yan’s actions... and was charged with the crime of kidnapping Saint Ye Yue...

“By the way, did you say that the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon... Is she... Is she still alive...” Ye Qingtang asked the Blood Moon Elder. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang knew that she was asking the obvious... but she could not forget about Ah Yao.

“She died a long time ago,” the Blood Moon Elder said.

A ripple appeared in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Indeed, if Sister Ah Yao was not dead, she would not exist.

“By the way, Holy Lady, why did you suddenly mention Saint Ye Yue?” The Blood Moon Elder asked curiously.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “It’s nothing. I was just asking.”

Before the Blood Moon Elder could say anything, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered and she looked into the distance.

About a dozen people slowly descended from the sky.

Ye Qingtang was no stranger to the leader, the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince.

Back then, when she came to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, she made enemies with the Sky Vault Sect because of the woman in green.

If the Dragon Emperor Clan had not appeared that night, she would have ended up in the Sky Vault Sect’s hands. The consequences would have been dire.

“Miss, I wonder if you are free to come with us to the Sky Vault Sect?” The First Prince smiled at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang said coldly, “Get lost.”

The expressions of everyone from the Sky Vault Sect changed.

“Ha, that’s not up to you.”

Within seconds, over 10 Sky Vault Sect practitioners surrounded Ye Qingtang.

“Holy Lady, you leave first!”

The Blood Moon Elder shouted angrily.

Ye Qingtang first glanced at the Blood Moon Elder before turning to survey the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince and his men. She said indifferently, “You are courting death.”

After Ye Qingtang finished speaking, the Blood Moon Elder saw a sword beam shoot into the sky as the last ray of light before the apocalypse.

“Boom!”

With a loud boom, over 10 Sky Vault Sect members were instantly struck by the sword beam and turned to dust.

The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince and the Blood Moon Elder were stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“You... Are you... that person who ascended to the Immortal Emperor Realm a few days ago...” The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince was the first to recover from his shock.

Swoosh!

Without giving the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince the chance to finish speaking, Ye Qingtang waved her hand and the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince’s body was burned to ashes by black flames.

The Blood Moon Elder stared at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

“Your turn.”

Seeing that the lady in green was trying to escape, Ye Qingtang appeared beside her in a flash.

“Ha, the deal between you and me is now void.” Ye Qingtang stared at the lady in green and her lips curled up into a sneer.
