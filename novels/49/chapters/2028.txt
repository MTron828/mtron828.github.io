Chapter 2029: Battle (3)

Elder Cong’s face darkened as soon as those words were out of his mouth.

So the Crimson League wanted the Spirit of Chaos fragments as well!

Looking at them from the side, Ye Qingtang was not worried at all. The Ancient You Clan wouldn’t be the Ancient You Clan if they were handed the fragments over willingly.

And just as she had predicted, Elder Cong’s face darkened when he heard Mi’s demands.

“What? You don’t want to? If you’re not going to hand it over, we’ll have to take it ourselves!” Bai Zhi was already filled with murderous intent towards the Ancient You Clan which had made a fool of them many times now. Seeing Elder Cong’s reluctance, her eyes flashed dangerously.

Wasting no time, Bai Zhi swiftly attacked the Ancient You Clan in the blink of an eye. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Since the Crimson League had made the first move, Elder Cong realized that they had nothing to discuss. He ordered the Ancient You Clan youths and soldiers to attack as well.

Both sides quickly meshed together.

The most lethal part of the Ancient You Clan was its youths. But now that the Crimson League was dealing with them, it took a huge burden off the alliance’s shoulders as they just had to deal with the troops.

Even though the Ancient You Clan had gotten stronger, the power of their troops was nothing compared to the youths. But they were still considered extremely powerful on the Central Mainland.

The Ancient Clans finally lost their cool as their suppressed emotions welled up and overpowered them. They attacked the Ancient You Clan troops with every ounce of their being.

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang stood on top of Ming Di as they swept the battlefield. Ming Di opened his mouth wide and his burning breath was hot enough to burn down their enemies.

Ye Qingtang leaped up from his back and entered the battle. She turned into a ray of cold light which destroyed everything in her path.

Even though she was no match for the youths, she could handle the other Ancient You Clan troops easily. Ye Qingtang had continued cultivating herself all this time and had already entered the Second Heaven state.

Amid the battle, her eye swept over the battlefield, and the sight she saw left her tongue-tied.

Those youths who could single-handedly wipe out entire Ancient Clans were not shown any mercy at all from Bai Zhi and the others from the Crimson League.

Even though she had been to the Second Domain before, she had never interacted with the forces of the Crimson League. She could now see with her own eyes that the fact that the Crimson League’s prominence in the Second Domain was not a lie at all.

As soon as she confirmed that the Crimson League could indeed take on the youths, Ye Qingtang began looking for Ning Luo.

Before she came, she had asked Ning Luo to hide within the army. She quickly spotted Ning Luo’s figure sweeping past the battlefield, flying by many people as he took advantage of the chaos to infiltrate the Ancient You Clan.

Heart trembling, she quickly smashed the head of an Ancient You Clan soldier and flew after him.

The fight was shaking the ground and the skies and everyone who had fighting capability from the Ancient You Clan had joined the battle.

Ye Qingtang quickly caught up with Ning Luo. She quickly sneaked in after seeing that the Ancient You Clan abode was empty.

“What do you sense?” she asked him.

Ning Luo shook his head slightly.

“The place is so vast that I can’t sense things well.”

“Continue inwards then,” she said.

Ning Luo nodded.
