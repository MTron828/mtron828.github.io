“If you know what is good for you, get lost quickly. Don’t taint my spot,” Song Junqiu said rudely with a clear hint of annoyance.

“This senior brother is really funny. The Spirit Consonance River is provided for all Xuanling Sect disciples to use, and since when was any spot set out for a disciple? If you want this area in the spring, you can come earlier.” Ye Qingtang was not affected by Song Junqiu’s threats at all.

Song Junqiu’s face darkened instantly, and his eyes turned shockingly cold. He had never seen such an ignorant outer sect disciple before. This person was really heedless of consequences!

“Don’t be shameless! Senior Brother Song said all this to give you face. Do you believe we will just throw you straight out! You, a mere outer sect disciple, dare to hog the best spot in the Spirit Consonance River? What a joke!” Another disciple shouted in intimidation.

The other onlooking inner sect disciples quietly shook their heads at that sight.

It was simply overreaching one’s ability for an outer sect disciple to contend with an inner sect disciple. Any one of those three people could easily kill Ye Qingtang. Where did she find the boldness to fight with Song Junqiu head on?

“Throw me out?” Ye Qingtang suddenly laughed. With narrowed eyes, she swept a glance across the three people, and her curled lips formed a scoff. “Why? Do you all wish to fight in the Spirit Consonance River?”

Ye Qingtang’s tone turned colder. “You all spent Xuanming points to enter the Spirit Consonance River, and so did I. Plus, I spent five times what you all paid! What gives you the right to shout at me here? I want to ask the Spirit Consonance River warden whether there is such a rule in Xuanling Sect where inner sect disciples can disregard the sect rules, do whatever they want, and oppress fellow disciples!”

Ye Qingtang’s forceful voice crushed the silent Spirit Consonance River.

The surrounding inner sect disciples were dumbfounded. Never had they expected this outer sect disciple to be so bold. Not only was she was not fearful when facing three inner sect disciples, she even brought up the sect rules so rationally.

And they were very clear that there was no error in what Ye Qingtang said.

The Spirit Consonance River was originally opened for all disciples to use. Although inner sect disciples use it more frequently, outer sect disciples had to pay five times the number of Xuanming points should they want to use it. They, themselves, were pressed for Xuanming points to use the Spirit Consonance River. How much did this outer sect disciple go through to be able to exchange for the usage rights…

Song Junqiu’s face turned red. He never expected this outer sect disciple to actually be so daring. However…

In consideration of what Ye Qingtang said about notifying the warden, he did not dare to mess with her.

The Spirit Consonance River’s rules were not his to decide.

If Ye Qingtang really lodged a complaint, he would definitely be the one in trouble.

Song Junqiu sneered. “I’ll let the spring to you today. Let’s see what a mere outer sect disciple can achieve after obtaining the best spot!” Then, Song Junqiu immediately turned around and headed to another area with his people.

Song Junqiu suddenly stopped halfway and turned over to look at Ye Qingtang, who was at the spring.

“Junior Sister Ye, I wish you success in passing the inner sect assessment as soon as possible. I will definitely return today’s gift back to you!”FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com
