Chapter 2210: Invitation (3)

Teacher Luo spoke again, “Teacher Ye, I don’t know how you did it but you have been a great help to Yun Chen’s elixir-refinement progress. I heard that you also have some interest in refining elixirs.”

Teacher Luo had no idea how Ye Qing managed to stabilize Yun Chen’s elixir-refinement quality level, but just this point alone was enough to make him feel that he just had to invite Ye Qing to join the medicine faculty.

After all, there were all sorts of bloodlines in this world. And many bloodlines had a negative impact on refining elixirs. If Ye Qing had some solution to manage this issue, it would definitely be a boon to the medicine faculty.

“Teacher Luo wants me to be a teacher in the medicine faculty?” Ye Qingtang was calm as she asked in a mild tone.

Teacher Luo smiled. “Not exactly. Teacher Ye, you seem adept at controlling the negative effects that some bloodlines have on elixir refinement. I wish to have you join the medicine faculty as a warden.

The Netherworld Academy also had wardens but they were on a completely different level than teachers. They only had a slightly higher status than students and were only in charge of miscellaneous duties around the academy.

The faces of Lei Yan and the rest, who were initially shocked by the fact that their Boss was going to be poached by the medicine faculty, immediately shifted. They appeared rather conflicted now.

Asking their Boss to be a warden at the medicine faculty?

Teacher Luo must be mad!

Teacher Luo appeared oblivious to the looks on the faces of Lei Yan and the rest as he continued. “Teacher Ye knows that the teachers in our medicine faculty have to be at least high-level alchemists. Moreover... I heard that Teacher Ye is not an official teacher in the Netherworld Academy. If you accept my invitation and become a warden of the medicine faculty, you can become an official member of the Netherworld Academy. Also... since Teacher Ye is interested in refining elixirs, we can guide you along in your efforts. If Teacher Ye is talented enough, you might even become a real teacher in the future.”

Teacher Luo’s words held no malicious intentions. He was just speaking according to what he understood about Ye Qing’s situation.

Teacher Luo thought that Ye Qing was interested in refining elixirs because he heard of her request to borrow an alchemy lab. This was why he was offering this olive branch.

If she could resolve the bloodline problem, the medicine faculty would naturally give her a place here.

But Yun Chen and the rest nearly spat out blood in anger at his words.

Give Boss guidance in refining elixirs?

You must be joking!

What was the current standard of those teachers at the medicine faculty? Which one of them had the right to guide their Boss?!

Even Yun Chen, who was from the medicine faculty himself, looked as grim as if he had just eaten a pile of shit. Teacher Luo’s words were like a joke to their ears.

A person who could refine Grand Master-level elixirs becoming a warden at the medicine faculty? No other academy would dare to put on such airs in the entire Second Domain.

Ye Qingtang did not give too much reaction on hearing Teacher Luo’s words. She just shook her head. “Thank you Teacher Luo for your kind intentions, but let’s just forget about it.”

Teacher Luo didn’t expect Ye Qing to reject him.

It should be pointed out that although Ye Qing was called a teacher now, he was not an official teacher of the Netherworld Academy. The academy could kick him out the door at any time.

“Why?” Teacher Luo looked at Ye Qing in confusion.
