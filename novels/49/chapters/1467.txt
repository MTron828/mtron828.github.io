1468 The Familial Tradition of Protection 1

The Domain Monarch was obsessed with martial arts and did not have much time to discipline his children. Jiang Xun looked after Jiang Lang when he was young, and given her perverse nature, she indulged his behavior greatly.

“Why? Can I not spoil my own nephew? Eldest brother, aren’t you caring too much?” Jiang Xun chuckled.

Jiang Kai and Jiang Xun were two extremes. One stuck by conventions strictly while the other was indulgent. Even when they were young, they had not seen eye to eye with each other.

“I can’t be bothered to bullsh*t with you. The three of them must be punished today.” Jiang Kai was unwilling to waste time talking to Jiang Xun.

Jiang Xun snickered. “I want to see who dares to touch Lang and his family in front of me.”

“Are you protecting them?” Jiang Kai’s expression darkened.

“That’s right.” Jiang Xun raised a brow.

Looking at the arrogant Jiang Xun, Ye Qingtang vaguely understood why the Jiang Family would produce such a madman like Jiang Lang.

“Lang, come over you all.” Jiang Xun completely ignored Jiang Kai’s increasingly-ugly expression and waved at Jiang Lang.

Jiang Lang walked to Jiang Xun’s back immediately with Mo Yi and the rest.

“I heard that your child is found?” Jiang Xun asked with a smile.

“Yes, aunt.” Jiang Lang nodded.

Jiang Xun looked back and was slightly dazed as she stared at Beidou Demon Lord. “Eh? She’s so big already. Although she is much bulkier, she does have a very beautiful face.”

The tall and mighty Beidou Demon Lord was dumbfounded from the praise.

Ye Qingtang, who was blocked by Beidou Demon Lord, stared blankly. “…”

“Aunt, this is then our daughter.” Mo Yi seemed to be used to it and simply pulled Ye Qingtang to Jiang Xun’s side.

Jiang Xun was obsessed with cultivation when she was young and almost blinded her eyes. Although her eyes were safe now, her vision was extremely blurry, and she could only faintly see light. She relied on her perception to identify people most of the time.

“Haha. So this is her. What a beautiful little fellow.” Jiang Xun laughed.

Ye Qingtang was silent.

In her grandaunt’s eyes, her beauty was no different from Beidou Demon Lord’s…

As Jiang Kai looked at the harmonious and joyful scene with Jiang Xun and Ye Qingtang’s family, his expression darkened to the extreme.

Jiang Qin was, of course, unwilling to see Jiang Xun protecting Jiang Lang and the rest.

“Aunt, it’s not that we wanted to do anything to Second Brother. It’s just that Second Sister-in-law injured Yiming so we…”

Jiang Xun tugged her lips impatiently.

“Injured means injured. Is there anything wrong with a senior teaching a junior?” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Jiang Qin opened her mouth but could not say anything.

“Mo Yi is Lang’s wife and is naturally Yiming’s senior. If a junior is disobedient, it is a common thing to teach him. Yet, the few of you made such a ruckus over this. Aren’t you all the ones who disobeyed the rules?” Jiang Xun said coldly.

Jiang Qin’s expression froze.

Jiang Kai said, “It is a fact that Jiang Lang attempted to kill his siblings.”

“Although I came late, I still heard some parts of the conversation. If the few of you did not cause trouble to Mo Yi and her daughter, why would Lang be this furious? In my opinion, they were the ones who violated the family rules as they wanted to harm someone else’s wife and daughter over a small matter. Which loving man in this world will not be angry? I think that Lang is not wrong at all. They are the ones who are wrong instead.” Jiang Xun had an expression that implied that ‘Jiang Lang was right’, which made Jiang Kai’s blood boil.

Ye Qingtang finally saw a reasonable person in the Jiang Family.

Although Jiang Xun was brash, everything she said was reasonable.

“I’m not going to bullsh*t with you. You better move aside and not be nosy,” Jiang Kai said in a low voice immediately after failing to outspeak Jiang Xun.
