Chapter 2702: Destruction (1)

“To defy the heavens…”

Everyone looked at each other.

What did the Fourth Domain encounter in that distant era? Why would this Daoist say such heaven-defying words?

As Ye Qingtang’s gaze landed on the Silver Star Holy Lord, a frown crossed her face, and she did not pay much attention to the others. All she could think of was why this Silver Star Holy Lord looked exactly like Ling Yan…

“I am the reincarnation of the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon. Could Ling Yan be the reincarnation of this Daoist?” Ye Qingtang continued staring at the Silver Star Holy Lord as she pondered.

It had to be said that although Ling Yan and the Silver Star Holy Lord looked the same, their auras were different.

However, before Ye Qingtang could think further, the Silver Star Holy Lord raised his head slightly and looked into the sky with a profound gaze. He said in a mild voice, “You’re here.”

The High Monk also looked up into the sky.

Meanwhile, the Great Immortal Temple disciples looked a little puzzled. They did not know what had happened, nor did they know what the Silver Star Holy Lord meant.

However, in the next second, a thunderous voice spread throughout the entire place. It was like the sound of thunder from the netherworld, causing one’s heart to tremble.

After that, a red light engulfed heaven and earth. At the end of the horizon, it was as if a pair of hands had parted the clouds in the night. Blood-colored eyes were staring downwards.

“What happened?”

Lan Shan’s expression changed slightly.

“Look, it seems like a pair of hands are parting the clouds over there…” One of the disciples exclaimed.

Everyone looked at each other.

A pair of hands were… parting the clouds?

“No… it doesn’t just look like it…” A sweet-looking female disciple shook her head in shock.” There really is a pair of hands parting the clouds! ”

The expressions of the Silver Star Holy Lord and High Monk finally changed.

“Since you have come, you might as well show yourself.”

The High Monk pressed his palms together as he spoke in a soft voice.

Everyone looked up again. The phenomenon from before had already disappeared. Now, a black shadow was descending from the sky. It was just standing quietly in the sky without moving, but the aura from the black shadow was overwhelming. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Engulfed by this suppressive force, even Ye Qingtang and the rest felt that they could not breathe. It was as if they were suppressed by thousands of huge mountains.

“Is this really an illusion… Why do I feel that we will die?”

Sensing the indescribable pressure of the divine power, Lan Shan’s expression changed and cold sweat broke out on his forehead. Under the suppression of this power, it seemed like they would die on the spot.

“It is still an illusory realm. There’s no need to worry.” Zhang Chi spoke softly. “These exist only in the memories of the owner of the soul bones. However, if that black shadow is already so terrifying in a mere memory, what kind of level will it be at if it really exists in reality…?”

“Did that black shadow destroy the Fourth Domain?” Zhou Yun frowned.

“Impossible. The Fourth Domain is such a powerful existence. Ten or even a hundred Divine Venerate Domains cannot compare to the Fourth Domain. How could it be destroyed by a single existence?” Another disciple disagreed.
