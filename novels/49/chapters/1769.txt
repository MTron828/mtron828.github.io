Chapter 1770: Sealed Space (2)

Ye Qingtang looked at the demon flesh in her hands. That unforgettable taste she had experienced that day once again surged into her mouth, making her turn pale.

Ingesting fiendish demon flesh was very good for enhancing the powers of another demon. After a battle, most of the demon flesh would be divided out and given to the demons who had participated in the fight. The best parts would be set aside and offered to the big shots in the camp.

For a weakling ‘adult fiendish demon’ like Ye Qingtang, she didn’t even have the right to participate in a battle, and would never get the chance to ingest any demon flesh.

Ye Qingtang was very grateful for this fact, but today... someone had been “kind-hearted” enough to offer her some.

“Hu, didn’t you promise that piece of meat to me?” One of the demons standing beside the first demon murmured.

The demon called Hu glanced at his comrade. “Are you that desperate for that one bite?”

“...” The demon was truly desperate. No one would reject another bite of demon flesh.

Hu turned away and looked at Ye Qingtang with disdain. “What is your mark?”

‘Mark’ referred to a fiendish demon’s name.

“Qing.” Ye Qingtang randomly threw out the first syllabus of her own name.

A demon’s mark contained only one character. It was just for ease of calling and didn’t hold any other significance. If a fiendish demon died in battle, his mark could also be assumed by the other little fiendish demons.

“What kind of mark is that? Sounds weak.” Hu frowned.

As Hu was wearing a human skin, he could display the same expressions as a normal human. If not for the demon aura he exuded, everyone would have thought he was a noble aristocrat just by the looks of him.

Ye Qingtang had been in the camp for some time and understood how some things worked here. The big shots of the eastern camp usually remained in the deep recesses of the cave, seldom venturing out. Ye Qingtang had yet to even catch a glimpse of any of the elite fiendish demons. Meanwhile, Hu was one of the higher-ranking demons in this camp.

In fact, he was the highest-ranking demon Ye Qingtang had met and was very powerful. Otherwise, he would not have ventured alone into the western territories to scout out the area. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As Hu was such a high-ranking demon, Ye Qingtang had no choice but to quietly bear his insults. But just the sight of that fresh demon meat made her feel like vomiting.

Ye Qingtang didn’t want it but there was another demon who desired it.

“I say, Qing. Hu promised that meat to me. But I can’t object now since he gave it to you. Nevertheless... can you let me wear your skin for a while? I have one too, we can do an exchange.” The other demon stared greedily at Ye Qingtang’s tender skin.

There have been fewer and fewer humans around to obtain fresh skins, and it was troublesome to maintain their old ones. As a result, those old skins had become very wrinkled and looked rather ugly. On the contrary, Ye Qingtang’s skin was still smooth and tender, and looked very lovely.

This demon had already asked to borrow Ye Qingtang’s skin the very first day she arrived. Now, his desire had only intensified.

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

How could she exchange skins with him?!

Before Ye Qingtang could refuse, that demon was already reaching out to pull off her skin.

Ye Qingtang’s scalp went numb. Her identity would be revealed!

But before Ye Qingtang could react, Hu suddenly reached out and dragged that demon away with him.
