“Senior Brother… aren’t you a little too fast in your actions? That little junior sister just now looks very foreign and feels like a new disciple,” Qin Huan said.

Gu Yanqiu nodded.

“That’s right, she just entered the sect.”

Qin Huan’s jaw nearly dropped onto the floor. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Senior brother, you know that she is a new disciple, yet you still want to add her into the team? You are…”

Qin Huan really did not know what to say Gu Yanqiu at a moment’s time.

Since when did Gu Yanqiu become someone who did whatever he pleased?

“You saw her exchanging blows with Zhou Qu just now as well. What do you think of her skills?” Gu Yanqiu asked instead of replying.

Qin Huan was taken aback, and he instinctively recalled Ye Qingtang’s fierce throw over the shoulder. He really could not draw a connection between that clean and sharp technique with the exquisitely-beautiful face.

“Uh… she has some skill it seems,” Qin Huan replied straight to the point.

Gu Yanqiu laughed.

“It is so, then. Our team has never looked at credentials but at abilities. Since she has the ability, why should we be afraid of the so-called difference between new and old disciples?”

Qin Huan scratched his head and was speechless over how Gu Yanqiu twisted his words. “Do whatever you want. Anyway, the Giant Rock Canyon mission is taken on by you. Since you are the leader, then you’ll naturally decide on the members.” Then, his gaze fell on Zhou Qu, who was half dead on the floor, again.

“Serves Zhou Qu right. All he knows is to bully the new disciples. Meeting a skilled one this time is a lesson for him.”

Gu Yanqiu frowned slightly and said, “Zhou Qu is fearless, but don’t forget the reason why he dares to be so arrogant in the outer sect.”

Qin Huan was taken aback. An image of a person suddenly flashed across his mind.

“If Zhou Xuan hears of this incident…”

Gu Yanqiu shook his head. These were not what they could control.

…

Ye Qingtang returned from the Rewards Pavilion and made a mental note of the Giant Rock Canyon mission. Just when she returned to her room, she heard a clear laugh.

When she pushed open the door, she saw Su Wan chatting with another young girl. Upon seeing Ye Qingtang’s return, both of them stopped laughing, and their eyes seemed to intentionally avoid Ye Qingtang as though they completely did not see her.

Ye Qingtang had a little memory of that girl whom Su Wan was chatting with; she was also one of the new disciples.

“Junior Sister Su, I didn’t expect that you were actually allocated to stay with her. There is still another empty spot at my place. How about we ask the warden if you could be changed to stay over there someday?” That young girl said smilingly. Although her voice was not loud, Ye Qingtang could still hear it.

Su Wan glanced over at Ye Qingtang, who just walked past, and an unusual emotion flashed across her eyes, though she quickly looked down to restrain her expression.

“There’s no need to trouble. Fortunately, entering the sect is also all for the sake of cultivation. I’m not bothered with other things,” Su Wan said gently.

“Junior Sister Su is still so good-natured. But, this is not a way as well. Isn’t Yun…” The girl still wanted to say something, but Su Wan hurriedly shook her head without allowing her to continue on.

The girl peeked at Ye Qingtang and frowned, speaking quietly, “Junior Sister Su, if you really like Senior Brother Yun, you must take more initiative. Otherwise, you’ll just give others a chance, and it would really be too late then.”
