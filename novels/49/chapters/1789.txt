Chapter 1790: It Is All A Misunderstanding (4)

But before Ye Qingtang could ponder further what kind of place this was, the Deity Ocean in her hand suddenly emitted a strong light. Ye Qingtang felt the world spin and her line of sight become blurry. She could once again feel that familiar chilly air!

In the next second, Ye Qingtang opened her eyes. After she managed to regain her bearings, she was stunned by what she saw.

She had returned to the place where she was facing off with the Great General of the Heavenly Demon Race. The Great General, whom she had angered earlier, was now just five meters away, glaring at her with a malevolent expression...

What the hell!!

Why was she back?!

“Damned trash!” The Great General of the Heavenly Demon Race’s voice was cold and full of bloodlust.

Ye Qingtang was frozen to the ground. The cheeky words she had shouted at the Great General now came back to haunt her...

Haha..

Was the Deity Ocean playing a trick on her?!

“Mis... misunderstanding... this is all a misunderstanding.” Ye Qingtang was no longer able to smile.

The Great General snorted and walked toward Ye Qingtang with narrowed eyes.

“You were very happy insulting me earlier, right? Let’s see if you can still hurl insults when I crush your bones and smash your brains in.”

Ye Qingtang broke out in cold sweat all over. The Deity Ocean had really done her in this time.

“Who? Who dared to insult the Great General? You must have truly misunderstood,” Ye Qingtang said very sincerely.

“Didn’t you say earlier that I will never have the Deity Ocean? And you asked me to dream on?” the Great General repeated her earlier words in a harsh voice.

“No, I said that even in my dreams, I also wish that the Great General will obtain the Deity Ocean.” Ye Qingtang was openly lying without any remorse.

“Ha...” The Great General clearly did not believe Ye Qingtang’s cunning change of words. He narrowed his eyes and exuded waves of demonic aura.

“Didn’t you say earlier that you didn’t feel any pain at all when I attacked you? Let’s see if you will feel any pain now.”

“Of course I feel the pain. Just the sight of you is painful to me.” Ye Qingtang gave a bitter smile. She was going to try her earlier trick of tossing the Deity Ocean away, so that she could make her escape.

But when Ye Qingtang glanced down, she saw that her hands were completely empty. There was no sign of the Deity Ocean at all.

“...”

Where did the Deity Ocean go?!!

Ye Qingtang clearly remembered that she still had the Deity Ocean in her hands just before she was sent back to the Great General.

Why...

Why had the Deity Ocean vanished now?

Ye Qingtang was totally confused. It was her final chance at survival. How did it disappear just like that? It felt like her world was crashing down on her as she watched the demonic aura gathering in the hands of the Great General.

She was doomed!

But the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General noticed that Ye Qingtang had glanced down at her hands. He followed her line of sight and saw that the Deity Ocean was missing. Then his face instantly turned dark.

“Where did you hide the Deity Ocean?”

Ye Qingtang, “...”

She really wanted to cry now. She also wished to know where the Deity Ocean was.

If she told the Great General that she had misplaced the Deity Ocean...

Ha... there was no doubt that she would be dismembered.

Even as she was on the brink of a mental collapse, Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to speak the truth. She put on a calm face and told the Great General.

“Won’t the Great General just immediately kill me if I told you where I hid the Deity Ocean?”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m
