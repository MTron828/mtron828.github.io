Chapter 807 A Kind Act (2)

Long Jiang had a complicated expression.

Back then, he knew of Her Lordship’s heart to assist the Grand Imperial Sire and thought of helping her to fulfill her wish since she was going to leave.

Hence, he requested Her Lordship to mark the Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven before she left.

Yet, unexpectedly…

Ye Qingtang helped Long Jiang to remove the venomous insect. In her previous life, Perfected Xuanchen’s skills decreased drastically after he was poisoned with Gu by Ye You, and he eventually died. As a result, Ye Qingtang studied a lot on the Gu from then on.

The Gu in Long Jiang’s body was considered pretty powerful, but it was not a problem for her now.

The sky was already dark when everything was settled. Ye Qingtang originally decided to look for Master Du today but decided to postpone it to the next day since it was late.

The Grand Imperial Sire was more than glad and ordered some men to arrange a room for Ye Qingtang.

There were too many things involved in the Empress Dowager’s incident.

The information delivered to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty was already a headache itself, but it was fortunate that some confidential secrets were still unexposed.

As there was a slight improvement in the Grand Imperial Sire’s health, he gathered all his trusted subordinates in the court that night and the old troops left behind by Ye Qingtang’s mother in preparation to reorganize the boundaries and areas of strategic importance.

Looking at the Grand Imperial Sire’s spirit and enthusiasm, Ye Qingtang knew that he should be able to help Nine Nights Dynasty attempt a comeback and remodel this decadent dynasty, given his capability and the elimination of the concealed danger.

The tragic war between the two dynasties in her previous life could perhaps be avoided.

Even if there was a war again in this life, Nine Nights Dynasty would probably be able to retaliate unlike in her previous life.

Although she was delayed by a day, it was nothing much if it could allow Nine Nights Dynasty to avoid this calamity.

Although Ye Qingtang did not like being nosy, Nine Nights Dynasty was a place where her mother once stayed in after all. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The sky was dark, and Ye Qingtang fell into a slumber in the living quarters that the Grand Imperial Sire arranged for her.

The moonlight shone through the window and scattered on the wide bed that Ye Qingtang was sleeping peacefully on.

In the dark, the silver shadow transformed into a human figure without a sound.

Han Cangming stepped in the moonlight and slowly walked to Ye Qingtang’s bedside. A trace of oddity emerged in his cold eyes as he looked at the girl who was asleep on the bed.

The little white tiger opened its eyes secretly, and its eyes flickered when he saw Han Cangming in his human form.

Han Cangming’s eyes passed by Ye Qingtang’s tightly-shut eyes and eventually landed on the jade pendant which she wore on her neck today.

There was a subtle change in his expression. Suddenly, he lifted his hand, and a black aura floated out from his palm. It gradually gathered on the ground and shaped into the form of a wolf.

Waving his hand, the black mist faded away, and a silver wolf that was exactly the same as Han Cangming’s wolf form laid at where he was at originally.

However, that silver wolf’s eyes were dull without the slightest bit of intelligence as it lay on the ground motionless.

Han Cangming made a tiny cut on his finger, and a drop of blood flew towards that silver wolf’s glabella.

Then, the silver wolf’s eyes brightened, and it rose from the ground. An intense murderous aura was entrenched on its body as it bared its fangs fiercely at all the living beings in the living quarters.

A trace of coldness flashed across Han Cangming’s eyes, and killing intent surged out of him. The invisible killing intent was like a monster which swallowed the sun and moon, enveloping that ferocious silver wolf in it.

In just a moment, the silver wolf felt that boundless killing intent and instantly trembled in fear. Tucking its tail, it crouched down on the ground and let out a frightened whimper.
