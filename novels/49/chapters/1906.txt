Chapter 1907: Paragon Level (1)

This was not the first time Ye Qingtang encountered something like this.

Ye Qingtang didn’t dare to overthink it. She quickly sat down cross-legged and started to control the circulation of the chaotic energy inside her. She would explode and die if she just allowed it to run amok within her!

That energy within Ye Qingtang turned increasingly strange. Although it clearly came from an external source, it wasn’t volatile and she managed to absorb it very smoothly. It felt like the energy was naturally immersing itself into her, there was no need for her to force it.

It was the first time Ye Qingtang experienced something like this.

After a very long time, the chilly air surrounding Ye Qingtang gradually faded. A silver-grey glow covered her entire body, the sight of which caused Little White Tiger’s eyes to widen in amazement.

Why could it feel a faint aura of death from Ye Qingtang?

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes and a strong beam of light suddenly burst out of her body. Little White Tiger was sent flying away by the force. It knocked into the gold-gilded black box which fell on top of Little White Tiger.

“Damn!!”

Ye Qingtang was stunned by the sight of that strong beam and the powerful energy surging within her.

“Paragon... Paragon level?” Ye Qingtang was in complete disbelief as she felt the power within her.

This was her peak level in her previous life!

Ye Qingtang had never imagined that she could once again attain the Paragon level under such random circumstances.

After coming out from the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm, she was already close to the Eight Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate. Even others were astounded by her lightning-fast progress.

Likewise, she was already very satisfied with her advancement and believed that she had already nearly finished absorbing all the energy from the spirit stones within her. She thought that it would take another few years for her to try and attain the Paragon level.

But...

It had only been how long?

How was she already at the Paragon level now?

Ye Qingtang could feel a wondrous change had been triggered within her. She now exuded a faint aura of death. That death aura was very mild and it was nearly undetectable if she didn’t try and focus on it.

Even more astonishing was the fact that...

This death aura felt exactly the same as the one exuded by the finger bone of the Holy Lord of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang stared at her own hands. Had she somehow merged with the power stored inside that finger bone?

She had always known that the Holy Lord of Shadows was very powerful. Otherwise, she would not have become the most powerful figure on this mainland.

But...

She never dreamed that just one finger bone from the Holy Lord would be enough to push her into the Paragon level!

Was the power of the Holy Lord of Shadows really that formidable?

Ye Qingtang had no idea.

Recalling her past life in the Second Mainland, she had heard some commoners guessing that the Holy Lord of Shadows was at the Paragon level. Ye Qingtang wanted to tell them... DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Their imaginations had been limited by ignorance. Just a single finger bone from the Holy Lord was enough to attain the Paragon level!

Ye Qingtang was feeling very gleeful but then she heard a groan coming from the side.

When she turned, she saw Little White Tiger trapped under the upturned gold-gilded black box. It was trying its best to scramble out but was failing miserably.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help laughing out loud.

“Damn you, how dare you laugh at me! Get me out now!” Little White Tiger was very annoyed. The box didn’t look that heavy but it felt like a huge mountain on Little White Tiger. No matter how it struggled, it just couldn’t escape.
