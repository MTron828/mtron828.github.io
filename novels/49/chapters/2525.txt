Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Blood Moon Elder broke out in cold sweat when he saw the golden-robed middle-aged man stomp on the big yellow dog. This guy was so cruel that he did not show mercy to a mere dog?

Ye Qingtang was not worried about the big yellow dog. Although the big yellow dog had always kept a low profile and was afraid of trouble, with its skills, even if it could not defeat the Sky Vault Sect’s Branch Master, it would not be killed by him without any retaliation.

Others might not have seen the ferocity of the big yellow dog but Ye Qingtang had witnessed it with her own eyes.

“Brother Canine… Are you still alive?”

The Blood Moon Elder looked at the big yellow dog with brows slightly furrowed. He called out softly to the dog, who was still beneath the golden-robed man’s foot.

However, the yellow dog did not speak for a long time.

“Holy Lady… do you think Brother Canine is dead?” The Blood Moon Elder was a little worried. No matter what, they had experienced life and death together. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

However, before Ye Qingtang could speak, the big yellow dog’s tail swayed gently. “Little human… You have gone too far.”

The expressions of the Sky Vault Sect people changed slightly. The big yellow dog could still speak after being hit twice by the Branch Master…

“Oh?”

A hint of interest surfaced in the golden-robed man’s eyes. Previously, when he sized it up, there wasn’t anything special about this big yellow dog. But now, it seemed like that wasn’t the case. Even a high-level demon beast would not be able to withstand these two attacks, not to mention a common dog.

“I’ve underestimated you.” The golden-robed man’s lips curled up slightly. “Forget it. Since you aren’t an ordinary animal and a rare spiritual beast, I’ll bring you back to the palace. It’s not bad to be a mascot.”

“Mascot…” The big yellow dog slowly crawled out from the collapsed ground and shook off the dust on its body. Its eyes were chilled to the extreme. “You are asking me to be a mascot.”

“What? You’re not willing?” The golden-robed man sneered. “It’s a pity that you’re just a dog. Otherwise, any other beast who can survive two blows by me is worthy enough to be my mount.”

“Mount?” The big yellow dog raised its head and looked at the golden-robed man. “Little human, have you never heard of… those who fly in the sky, swim in the sea, or run on the ground can all become mounts… But in this world, only canines are off-limits.”

“Huh? Is there such a saying?” The golden-robed man was intrigued.

“Do you know why canines can’t be used as mounts?” The big yellow dog asked.

“I am indeed interested to hear your explanation.” The golden-robed man stood with his hands behind his back.

“Because… This is a rule I set during the Ancient Era!”

The golden-robed man’s smile suddenly froze.

In that instant, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder saw a terrifying red glow in the big yellow dog’s eyes. It opened its mouth and a hurricane formed between its jaws.

Within the hurricane, purple-red lightning flashed non-stop. It was as if the hurricane in the big yellow dog’s mouth encompassed the tens of thousands of great dao laws across the entire Buddhist universe.

Before Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder could return to their senses, the golden-robed middle-aged man’s face was already filled with defeat. What kind of monster was this dog!

Under this torrential force, the golden-robed man even lost the strength to move his fingers. He could not move at all.. His body instinctively wanted to escape this place, but his limbs refused to listen to his commands.
