Chapter 357: Blinding Forging Skills (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The incharge and the elderly thought Ye Qingtang was going to embed Spirit Crystals into the new weapon again and were instantly on alert. They found the effect of embedding the Spirit Crystals into the Demonic Blood Sword fascinating and were going to look carefully this time.

However…

Ye Qingtang suddenly took out a thick cloth and wrapped the Spirit Crystals. Afterward, she picked up the hammer on the anvil and pounded on the bag of Spirit Crystals heavily.

A sharp, crisp sound pierced the ears of the incharge and the elderly.

“What is she doing?” The elderly watched in astonishment as Ye Qingtang continuously smashed the Spirit Crystals into pieces with a hammer.

“Could it be that the Spirit Crystals are too huge? The black gold meteorite iron she chose just now is not able to embed many Spirit Crystals, but crushing them and selecting a few small ones is possible,” said the incharge seriously while casting his belittlement away.

As the two were caught in curiosity, Ye Qingtang had already hammered numerous times, and the entire bag was pounded relatively flat.

Seeing that it was about done, she finally unwrapped the bag.

The Spirit Crystals that were initially about the size of a fingernail were already crushed into tiny pieces which twinkled brightly under the glow of the fire.

The elderly looked at the Spirit Crystals that were almost in powder form and cast a look at the incharge who was speaking seriously.

There was a slightly awkward expression on the incharge’s face.

It was already crushed to this state. How could it be used to embed a weapon?

“I was ignorant… I really cannot tell… what this disciple wants to do,” the incharge said rather embarrassedly.

The elderly did not say anything much. His curiosity was piqued by every action Ye Qingtang took. She was clearly forging a weapon, and the processes were similar, but he was still unsure exactly what Ye Qingtang wanted to do.

The black gold meteorite iron that was thrown into the fire was already burned red, and its edges already softened under the high temperature.

“Why is she still not removing it? If she still doesn’t remove it, the black gold meteorite iron is really going to turn into molten iron.” The elderly furrowed his brows slightly. The liquid molten iron could be poured into a mold to fix the shape. Although it could be formed into the shape of a weapon directly, it was missing countless hammerings. Without repeated hammering, the ductility of the black gold meteorite iron would be greatly reduced.

“This girl is quite young. I reckon she does not have enough arm strength. It doesn’t seem possible for her to hammer a complete piece of black gold meteorite iron into shape,” the incharge said as a matter of fact.

Apart from the forging techniques, blacksmiths were more particular about their arm strength. After all, the iron hammers they used were as heavy as one hundred jin. To slowly hammer a slab of metal into shape, the minimum number of hammerings required would already reach tens of thousands of strokes, and each stroke had to be fully supported with the arm strength.

While this little girl may have some skills, arm strength was not something that could be trained in a day.

The elderly thought that he had a point as well but did not say anything and continued observing.

Ye Qingtang watched the red iron turn into molten iron, and her lips curled into a smile. Swiftly holding onto the bag of Spirit Crystal powder, she poured them into the molten iron in the high temperature.

As the glistening powders were poured into the molten iron, the blazing red flames engulfed them in an instant.

The eyes of the elderly and incharge almost popped out at the sight.

She actually mixed the Spirit Crystal powder into the black gold meteorite iron?!
