Chapter 1246: Birthday Celebration (2)

“Burp… this Luo Family is so interesting. They’ve actually seated the Blaze Clan and the Ice Clan together.” Mi Qiu looked over at the disturbance and waved its tail lazily.

When they saw that all the guests were seated, the Luo Family ordered servants to serve the delicacies and wine that had been prepared in advance.

As he looked at all the guests gathered under the lamplight, Luo Qi’s gaze secretly fell on Ye Qingtang. He frowned slightly and as he looked as everyone enjoying themselves, he walked over to his older brother, Luo Feng and spoke softly.

“Elder Brother, why is the Holy Lord of Shadows here?”

“Don’t know.” Luo Feng shook his head slightly, his gaze also secretly moving towards Ye Qingtang.

“Today is very important to Great Grandfather. The Holy Lord of Shadows has been missing for thousands of years. Now, she has suddenly reappeared and is even in our house. What does that mean? Does she mean to act against us?” Luo Qi asked softly.

The appearance of the Holy Lord of Shadows was completely beyond their expectations.

Who would have thought that the Holy Lord of Shadows, who had vanished for thousands of years, would now appear at the Luo Family Grand Elder’s birthday banquet?

“Don’t worry. It’s not yet certain whether this Holy Lord of Shadows is real or an impostor,” said Luo Feng suddenly.

Luo Qi was shocked.

“Elder Brother, are you saying… that this Holy Lord of Shadows is fake?”

“I can’t be certain,” Luo Feng said. “The Holy Lord of Shadows vanished for thousands of years, and the Temple of Shadows has declined. If the Holy Lord of Shadows did not disappear, then where has she been all these years? Why didn’t she appear when the Temple of Shadows declined? Also… many of the Undead in this mainland are currently enslaved. Considering the Holy Lord of Shadows’ temperament, do you think she would have ignored this if she was still in the Temple of Shadows?”

Luo Qi thought that what Luo Feng said made a lot of sense.

“Then… does Elder Brother mean that this Holy Lord of Shadows is an impostor from the Temple of Shadows? They are using this as an excuse to intimidate us?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“That may not be the case.” Luo Feng shook his head. “When I saw her chatting with the Great Grandfather just now, I could not tell that anything was wrong. I felt that she was just like the Holy Lord the Grand Elder talked about previously.”

“In that case…” Luo Qi’s brow furrowed slightly.

“Even if she really is the Holy Lord of Shadows, why does it matter? As I said, the Temple of Shadows and the Clan of the Undead’s situation has been unfavorable for thousands of years. If this Holy Lord of Shadows still retains her former power, then she would have already acted to cow the mainland. Now, she has emerged after secluding herself for thousands of years. I think… she won’t create any trouble,” Luo Feng said.

Realization suddenly dawned on Luo Qi. “Perhaps she was severely injured in the battle with the powerful cultivators from the Second Domain?”

“That’s possible.” Luo Feng nodded. The Holy Lord of Shadows’ disappearance had coincided with the conclusion of the battle with the powerful cultivators from the Second Domain.

“That makes sense. Perhaps, she was seriously injured and afraid that others would find out, so she deliberately started the rumor that she had disappeared and secretly went into seclusion to recover,” said Luo Qi.

Luo Feng nodded slightly and looked away. He spoke to Luo Qi.

“The arrival of the Holy Lord of Shadows is unexpected, but why does it matter? Great Grandfather’s plan for today will certainly succeed. The arrival of the Holy Lord of Shadows will even enhance the effect of Great Grandfather’s scheme.”

Luo Qi nodded.

“Elder Brother you are right. Nothing will go wrong for Great Grandfather.”

Luo Feng patted Luo Qi’s shoulder in satisfaction as his gaze swept over the hall full of guests.
