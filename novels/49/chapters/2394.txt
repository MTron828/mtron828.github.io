Chapter 2395: Slow And Steady (1)

Now that they knew of Ye Qing’s strategy to refine elixirs first, the teenagers all started moving. They soon collected quite a good amount of herbs from their surroundings and handed them over to Ye Qing.

Without another word, Ye Qingtang sorted through the herbs and arranged them, before giving two portions to Yun Chen and Song Yanhan.

Song Yanhan looked at the herbs, “…”

“Do you know how to refine Reversal Elixirs?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Reversal Elixirs were a type of healing medicine. They were not rare but were very effective.

Song Yanhan nodded.

“Refine.” Ye Qing’s instructions were simple and straight to the point.

With that, Song Yanhan resigned himself to the task. Seeing Yun Chen refine the elixirs using his palm flame, he quietly carried his tripod to a corner, although the sight made him feel somewhat abashed.

Yun Chen and Song Yanhan were both top talents in the medicine faculty, and the Reversal Elixir was not complicated. As a result, they were able to produce them very quickly.

Ye Qingtang didn’t join in the refining. She continued to search for useful herbs in the surroundings, leading Lei Yan and the rest as they collected more plants.

Half a day passed in the blink of an eye. Song Yanhan had been refining non-stop and his hands were stained in plant juices. By that point, he had worked so hard that he felt his head spin.

And he was shocked to discover that half a day had passed.

And they were still at the same spot. They had not advanced at all.

Apart from foraging for useful herbs, Ye Qing didn’t look like he intended to venture further into the Wailing Well.

Song Yanhan couldn’t understand this at all.

But Song Yanhan thought that perhaps Teacher Ye was just a more cautious person. Perhaps he would only make a move after refining enough elixirs.

It was dark and gloomy across the Wailing Well, and there was no sense of day or night inside here.

Song Yanhan had no idea exactly how long he had been refining. The elixirs in his tripod were taken out and Ye Qing allocated a portion to everyone in the team. Only after all the nearby useful herbs were collected did Song Yanhan stop.

He felt like his arms were going to break in two.

He didn’t have any other elixir-refining tools, only his tripod.

Even more tragic was that Song Yanhan realized his elixir-refining speed was far slower than that of Yun Chen’s. Not to mention Ye Qing’s.

As much as Song Yanhan didn’t want to admit it, he had personally witnessed Ye Qing produce 17 to 18 elixirs simultaneously with a single palm flame. The sight made him concede to the teacher’s skills in full.

Despite his skill and reputation, he still had to produce the elixirs one by one…

“Boss, are we going to hunt some demons now?” Lei Yan finally asked in a timid voice. He had spent half a day digging for herbs.

Ye Qing only replied, “You all wait here for me.”

Lei Yan and the others nodded obediently.

Boss was finally going to make a move!

Ye Qing soon disappeared. After a long time, she returned, bearing the faint smell of blood. The teenagers were excited.

Indeed!

Their Boss went hunting for demons!

But before they could ask Ye Qing about the demons, she tossed several strange-looking creatures at them.

“Eat.”

There was silence.

“Boss, didn’t you go and hunt for demons?” Jing Ze looked at those creatures which were about as big as rabbits.

“No, I didn’t. I went to hunt for food,” Ye Qing replied.

The team, “…”

Song Yanhan was dismayed. They had spent the first afternoon inside the Wailing Well refining a bunch of elixirs and hunting for food. Meanwhile, they had not gotten a single glimpse of any demons at all!

Did this Teacher Ye even want to win the competition?
