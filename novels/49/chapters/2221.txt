Chapter 2222: Nothing Much (1)

Apart from the Night Soul Beast, there were several other demons inside the Evil Soul Forest. Lei Yan and the others could practice on them.

“Pffft... this Night Soul Beast is so persistent.” Nangong Lie still felt a lingering fear in his heart. Then he suddenly realized that Ye Qing was holding a strange-looking cat.

And that grey cat seemed to have rolled its eyes at his words.

“Boss, what is this...”

“I saw it at the side just now and picked it up. In case we need it later,” Ye Qing replied.

“In case we need it later?” Nangong Lie was puzzled.

“We don’t know how long we might have to stay here. We need to prepare more food.” Ye Qing lied in all seriousness.

The Night Soul Beast: “...”

Damn you and all your ancestors!

Food? Your whole family is food! Before the enraged Night Soul Beast could lash out, Ye Qingtang lowered her head and smiled at it.

That smile completely stunned the Night Soul Beast, and it huddled inside Ye Qingtang’s arms, not daring to move.

“But it’s so skinny. That’s not enough meat...” Lei Yan pondered.

“Better than nothing,” Ye Qing replied.

The others didn’t think much of this matter. They were just very curious over the sudden disappearance of that Night Soul Beast. On the side, the Spy Cloud man was still fearful. He had just escaped certain death after all.

Just as everyone was still feeling doubtful, a sudden movement could be seen in the undergrowth.

Turning to look, a team of men riding on horses was approaching. The Spy Cloud man’s eyes lit up on seeing the team.

“Division Head Shi!”

Hearing the man’s cries, the man leading the group halted. He finally saw the man.

“Peng Ji?” Shi Shangfei noticed that the man was gravely injured and his face stiffened. He had his men lift him up. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Ye Qingtang noticed that these men all bore the emblem of Spy Cloud. They must all belong to Spy Cloud.

But...

Few people dared to venture into the Evil Soul Forest. Why did Spy Cloud suddenly dispatch so many men here?

Peng Ji finally shed his fear upon seeing his companions. He hurriedly told Shi Shangfei and his men about his encounter with the Night Soul Beast and how over a hundred Spy Cloud men died.

Spy Cloud had dispatched several teams into the Evil Soul Forest, who entered the place via different entrances. Peng Ji’s team had been unlucky and was attacked by a Night Soul Beast soon after entering the Evil Soul Forest. He was the only one who survived, albeit with grievous injuries.

“You encountered a Night Soul Beast? Where is it?” Shi Shangfei had heard of the Night Soul Beast and he instinctively frowned.

“It was planning to attack me and these guys. But somehow, it suddenly left... I had found it very strange but on second thought, perhaps it sensed that you and your team were approaching and so escaped first.” Peng Ji came up with this surmisation after linking the two occurences.

Of all the teams dispatched by Spy Cloud this time, Shi Shangfei’s powers were the most formidable. He was already a Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level practitioner. On top of that, his team included 10 other Divine Lord practitioners.

It could be said that they were the most powerful team in Spy Cloud and the main combat force.

“The Night Soul Beast is nothing much after all.” Shi Shangfei smirked. With his powers, he completely disregarded the Night Soul Beast. The dismal state of Peng Ji and the rest just proved that they had been too weak.
