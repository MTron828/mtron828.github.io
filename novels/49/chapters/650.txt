Ye Qingtang disappeared and flew towards the palace instantly.

…

The temperature in the palace was extremely low. There was a divine sword formed by frost floating in mid-air.

The mysterious black-robed man was sitting under the divine sword.

Countless drops of blood were traveling into the palace, they were all absorbed by the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

Every time it absorbed blood, its energy was restored slightly.

Ye Qingtang hid in the corner and stared at the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

“That’s a… Heaven-level divine weapon?!”

Ye Qingtang was appalled and could not believe what she saw.

The Heaven-level divine weapon only existed in tales and legends. There were almost no appearances of Heaven-level divine weapons in the First Domain.

Even in her previous life when she became the Holy Venerate after three hundred years, the divine weapon she had was just an Earth-level divine weapon, which was below the Heaven level.

“That’s not right…”

Ye Qingtang shook her head secretly.

Though the Ice Frost Divine Sword was of the Heaven level, it did not seem to be in its complete form. Now, the most power it could show was similar to that of an Earth-level divine weapon.

However, despite that, it was astonishing!

“Hehe… Young one, show yourself.”

Suddenly, the black-robed elderly who sat under the Ice Frost Divine Sword smiled and said.

Ye Qingtang frowned as she heard the voice. She had hidden her martial aura, but she was still discovered.

“Your perception is really amazing,” Ye Qingtang said.

There was no point hiding anymore since she was discovered. Ye Qingtang walked out from the shadows immediately.

“Young one, you’re indeed fascinating.” The black-robed man stood up slowly and looked at Ye Qingtang, who was walking out from the dark. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Senior, since we’re here now, we should not hide anything. I guess it’s you who is manipulating the Hell of Avicinaraka. May I know what your intentions are?” Ye Qingtang said and stared at the black-robed man.

The black-robed man smiled coldly. “That’s right. I am controlling the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avincinaraka… As for my intention, can’t you see it?”

“You want to resurrect the Ice Frost Divine Sword… However, this will require everyone’s life here. Is that inappropriate?” Ye Qingtang said.

Actually, it did not bother Ye Qingtang at all when the black-robed man wanted to use others’ blood to resurrect the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

However, she was in the Hell of Avicinaraka as well. She did not want to die for the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

“Everyone here has sinned. It’s your honor to use your sinned blood to resurrect my Ice Frost Divine Sword. It’s my mercy as well.”

“You… you’re crazy.” A glint flickered in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

The black-robed man smiled softly. “Ye Qingtang, you were able to survive till now in the Hell of Avicinaraka… and be the only one who’s able to step into my palace on the third level. I’m very pleased.”

“That’s part of your effort as well. If you did not tell me about the Space-transfer Talisman, I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to last till now. So… senior, I doubt that we know each other right,” Ye Qingtang said and looked at the black-robed man.

“Ye Qingtang, you’re brave and smart. I liked you all this time. However, you shouldn’t have entered the Hell of Avicinaraka.” The black-robed man shook his head and sighed softly.

“Who are you? Can you reveal your true identity?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Who I am… That’s not important. Ye Qingtang, I’ll give you a chance. Leave the Fiendcelestial Beast and leave this piece of land alone,” the black-robed man said.
