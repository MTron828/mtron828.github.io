“Greetings, Great General.” Ye Qingtang was about to bow when the Great General dismissed the need for such niceties.

“No need for all that. Qing, did any demons from the other camps discover your tracks when you returned?” The Great General asked.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

She was not lying. She was afraid of being discovered by the other demons and so had made the return journey in invisible mode. It was only just before reaching the eastern camp that she revealed her form. In addition, she had made sure that there were no other demons around her when she lifted her invisibility.

“Has my return been made known?” Ye Qingtang observed the Great General’s serious expression.

The Great General shook his head. “No such news yet. But the three top races seemed to have detected your presence. They have mobilized their troops and are heading our way.

Ye Qingtang was shocked.

How did they know which camp I am from?”

Although demons could usually discern each other’s camp by their scent, the eastern camp was so insignificant to the big three that they wouldn’t have recognized the scent.

“It’s probably because of me...” Hu clenched his fists in frustration. “They injured me while I was under pursuit and I probably left some blood stains on them. They would only need to do a bit of digging to easily find out my camp. So...”

Hu didn’t finish his sentence but all the fiendish demons at present already knew what he was going to say.

Apart from a demon from his own camp, there was no way Hu would hand the Deity Ocean to another person.

“But they might not know that Qing is back. We can...” Ba tried to speak up but was interrupted by Hu.

“Does it matter whether Qing is back? We are now the number one enemy in the eyes of the big three. When their troops attack, it will be a one-way road to hell for us whether or not Qing is here.”

The moment Hu snatched that Deity Ocean, they had already become the number one enemy to the big three. Not only did they want to take back the Deity Ocean, they wanted to slaughter every eastern fiendish demon and destroy the whole camp.

“Then... what should we do? Should we go and get the Deity Ocean now?” Ba suggested.

“We don’t have time for that now,” the Great General said slowly. “The fiendish demons from the big three are arriving very soon.”

With that, the Great General suddenly turned to Ye Qingtang. “Qing, you are the only one who knows where the Deity Ocean is. I am very glad now that I didn’t try to ask you about its location. Since you are the only one who knows, you need to leave this cave from the back and escape as far away as possible.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Ye Qingtang was taken aback by Great General’s words.

Although Ye Qingtang couldn’t wait to leave this god-forsaken place, she had gotten close to the demons here. Now that the eastern camp had fallen into dire straits, she really couldn’t bear to just leave them and flee on her own.

“Qing, listen to me. The Deity Ocean is the only hope for our camp. Now that we are the number one enemy of the big three, I will evacuate all the fiendish demons from this camp right after you leave. We will have to abandon this place,” the Great General said very solemnly.

Against the big three tribes, they were completely defenceless. How would they have the slightest chance of winning?

It would be total annihilation if they remained here.

They were not foolish enough to bang their heads against hard, solid rock. The only thing they could do now was to flee and delay their potential demise as much as possible.
