Chapter 2240: Acting Is A Skill (2)

As such they did not send forth their top practitioners, so most of them here were Divine Lord Sixth Heaven level and below.

It could be said that this demon child was the most powerful amongst them.

Everyone knew that this meant the Black Moon Palace was exceptionally determined to get the treasure inside the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

It was not hard to ascertain the Black Moon Palace’s intentions. They quietly cursed in their hearts. But for now, it wouldn’t be any major issue if this demon child could open the fiendcelestial’s tomb door.

The demon child narrowed his eyes as he observed the stone door, which had been sealed for a long time. A dark red mist swirled around him. Suddenly, an intense menacing aura surged out of his body.

Pah! He struck his palm straight against the fiendcelestial’s tomb door..

A beam of red light flashed on the door the moment the palm landed.

Powerful energy was reflected from the surface of the door.

The demon child’s eyes shifted before immediately taking one step back, diverting the reflected energy away.

Boom!!

A thunderous boom rang out.

The energy diverted away by the demon child had completely flattened everything in that direction.

“This door is strange.” The demon child narrowed his eyes.

“We cannot use brute force on this door, otherwise it will just reflect the energy back at you.” The demon child rubbed his palm, which had gone numb. A streak of blood had appeared at the corner of his lips.

To think that even the demon child was unable to open the fiendcelestial’s tomb door. This was something completely unexpected by the crowd at present.

After all, the fiendcelestial’s tomb was there in front of their eyes, but they didn’t even have any idea how to enter. For a moment there, everyone sank into a deep silence.

“If we cannot open this door, let us just destroy this entire mountain. The fiendcelestial’s tomb will be exposed then,’ an elder suggested

“You can try if you dare.” The demon child smirked as he turned to return to his carriage.

The elder’s face stiffened but he didn’t do anything. Even a simple door possessed the power to reflect energy. If they tried to destroy this mountain, who knew what kind of consequences there would be.

The fiendcelestial might be dead but the lingering remnants of his divine consciousness were not something they could fend against.

“Don’t tell me only an Emperor-level practitioner can open it?” Someone guessed.

“Emperor-level practitioner...”

“Even an Emperor-level practitioner would probably be unable to open this door,” the demon child stated in a cold voice.

Everyone was stunned.

“The Temple of Paragon knew of the fiendcelestial’s tomb location a long time ago and there is something they need inside. Can you guess why they didn’t come forth to take it themselves? Why did they only just release news of this to let us fight over it?” The demon child narrowed its eyes.

It was probably because even the Temple of Paragon didn’t know how to open this door.

“But if even the Temple of Paragon is unable to open this door, what can the rest of us do?”

The people here were well aware of the wide disparity between them and the Temple of Paragon. If even the Temple of Paragon could not enter the fiendcelestial’s tomb, how could the rest of them hope to do so?

“Regardless, we have to try. Since you guys don’t want to, then let us destroy this mountain!” The people from Falling Water Pavilion leaped into the air.

“Fools.” The demon child smirked as he leaned back lazily in his carriage.

Everyone quietened down to see how those Falling Water Pavilion people would try to flatten this mountain.FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Just as they were prepared to attack, an ethereal voice rang out.

“This is the first time I have seen people so eager to die.”
