“Mo Yi, you must pay for my son’s life!”

Elder Meng roared.

No one expected Elder Meng to suddenly appear. Jiang Shun and the others were delighted to see Elder Meng.

Mo Yi stumbled, and blood shot from her mouth. She narrowed her eyes as she looked at Elder Meng, who had attacked her from behind.

“Your son deserved to die,” Mo Yi said with a cold laugh as she wiped away the blood.

Jiang Shun and the others had reached an impasse in their fight with Mo Yi. In fact, after Mo Yi’s powers surged, they had slowly started to lose. No one expected Elder Meng to suddenly attack at this moment, breaking Mo Yi’s momentum.

“Elder Meng.” Jiang Shun looked at Elder Meng and slowly raised his hand.

Elder Meng had appeared at this moment because he also wanted to kill Mo Yi.

Mo Yi would certainly die today!

“Mo Yi, I would like to see what other tricks you can pull out of your bag today. You have nothing to blame but your many evil deeds,” Jiang Shun said with a cold laugh.

Mo Yi’s eyes narrowed. Her chest rose and fell as she breathed erratically.

The demon fox servants, who were still embroiled in battle, were startled by Mo Yi’s appearance. Jiang Qin and Tuoba Yao immediately seized on their slight distraction and sent them flying with heavy injuries.

“Don’t waste time. Kill Mo Yi first,” Elder Meng said cautiously.

Tuoba Yao and Jiang Qin did not waver anymore. They leaped upwards into the void, and the four of them joined forces to surround Mo Yi.

When Ye Qingtang saw this, she also soared upwards and stood before Mo Yi, brandishing her sword.

“Tang Tang…” A faint smile grew on Mo Yi’s pale face when she saw that her daughter was protecting her.

“Mother, you leave first.” Ye Qingtang fixed her eyes on Jiang Shun and the others. If not for Elder Meng’s sneak attack, it would have been difficult to determine the outcome of today’s fight. But now Mo Yi seemed to be injured, perhaps…

“None of you will escape today! All of you will die here!” Jiang Qin laughed coldly.

“With your abilities…” Mo Yi laughed softly. She was about to say something else when she was racked with a fit of violent coughing. Ye Qingtang was frightened to see her cough out a large amount of blood.

Mo Yi frowned slightly and looked at Ye Qingtang, who was standing in front of her. Something flashed across her eyes. Then, she suddenly reached out and pulled Ye Qingtang into her arms. She flicked her wide sleeves, and flames shot from them. The flames were interspersed with cold gleams of light, which shot towards Jiang Qin and the others.

The gleams of light shot forth as flames filled the air.

While Jiang Qin and the others dodged, Mo Yi held on to Ye Qingtang and flew off, landing inside the room. Then, she curled her fingers and pulled the severely injured demon fox servants, Beidou Demon Lord, and the little white tiger into the room together.

The door slammed shut.

The flames in the courtyard immediately disappeared.

“Damn it, it was an illusion!” Jiang Qin only realized the truth when she saw the flames disappear suddenly. She prepared to break down the door and charge in.

But as Jiang Qin was about to break down the door, Jiang Shun pulled her back.

“Elder Brother?” Jiang Qin looked surprised.

Jiang Shun kicked a stone towards the tightly locked door.

The moment the stone collided with the room door, it exploded into bits.

“It’s a barrier.” Elder Meng narrowed his eyes as he looked at the door. He could faintly see that the doors and windows of the room were enmeshed in lines of light that were as fine as cobwebs.
