Chapter 782 Birth Mystery (2)

As the Blood Moon Elder spoke, he seemed to recall something suddenly and retrieved a brocade box from a shelf aside. It contained a monotype with some words.

“This is an inscription that the lady engraved when she was still in the Nine Nights Dynasty. No one can understand the inscription at all. After that lady left, the former Emperor secretly made copies of that inscription for the Ouyang family clan’s elders to help to grasp its meaning. Take a look, Holy Lady.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the item in detail.

When she took a glance, her eyes were focused on the three words “Forgotten River Cliff” on the inscription.

“Forgotten River Cliff…” Surprise flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

“Holy Lady, you know about the Forgotten River Cliff? I lived for a thousand years but have never heard about this place.” The Blood Moon Elder saw the words as well, but he completely had no idea what that place was. Apart from “Forgotten River Cliff”, there was nothing else he could understand from the inscription.

“Have you left this mainland before?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The Blood Moon Elder shook his head immediately.

“It would be creepy if you knew then.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder and said. “This Forgotten River Cliff is at another mainland.”

“Huh?” The Blood Moon Elder was completely stupefied.

Ye Qingtang had been to the Forgotten River Cliff in her previous life; it was in another mainland and within the Central Dynasty’s boundary. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

If one had not been to that mainland, it was simply impossible for them to know about the Forgotten River Cliff.

Ye Qingtang frowned lightly. As she thought of how the mysterious lady had powerful skills and odd martial skills, a thought suddenly occupied her mind.

Even if mighty figures from other mainlands came to this mainland, their skills would be suppressed to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state.

“Could she… be from the Central Dynasty?” Ye Qingtang was in deep thought as she looked at the words “Forgotten River Cliff” on the inscription.

If there was no accident, that mysterious lady was her birth mother.

Ye Qingtang never thought that her mother would actually not be from this mainland.

She originally thought that she would get to the bottom of the mystery of her birth after coming to the Nine Nights Dynasty.

Yet, unexpectedly…

It was actually such a huge puzzle.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. The confusion in her heart increased.

This mainland was already isolated, and it was simply impossible for outsiders to enter. How did her mother arrive on this mainland then? Why did she come here when she was pregnant and then disappear suddenly? Why did she leave the infant her behind?

Was her mother still in this mainland or had she already left?

The more Ye Qingtang thought, the more she could not figure out everything.

There was a possibility of resolving all these secrets only by entering the mainland where the Central Dynasty was.

Then, Ye Qingtang suppressed all the complicated and confusing thoughts.

Now was not the time for her to think about these.

“You did very well for this matter. If you find out any more news about that lady in the future, notify me immediately.”

“Rest assured, Holy Lady. I will definitely do my best. Holy Lady… that lady and you…” The Blood Moon Elder spoke a little hesitantly.

“She should be my mother,” Ye Qingtang said with a soft sigh.

The Blood Moon Elder nodded.

However, Ye Qingtang did not notice that their conversation had fallen into the ears of the silver wolf from aside. Its eyes glanced at Ye Qingtang’s deeply-frowned eyebrows, and a strange expression flashed across his eyes.
