Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Master Du stared at Ye Qingtang coldly but did not say anything. From his perspective, Ye Qingtang was just bluffing. Even Master Ao himself might not own a few grams of Millennium Meteoric Iron, not mentioning Master Ao’s disciple.

“Master…” Du Sheng looked towards Master Du.

Master Du sneered. “Du Sheng, do you believe that he has Millennium Meteoric Iron?”

Du Sheng shook his head.

Du Sheng had followed Master Du since he was young. He learned many forging skills, and he was very clear what Millennium Meteoric Iron was.

“How dare you to continue bluffing here?! Since you say that you have Millennium Meteoric Iron, I’ll give you a chance. Take out your Millennium Meteoric Iron now. If you don’t have any, I will not go easy on you!” Chu Yi shouted in anger.

Ye Qingtang sized up Chu Yi and uttered coldly. “Who are you? You don’t even deserve to have a look at the Millennium Meteoric Iron.”

“You are seeking death!”

Chu Yi suddenly raged after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words. With a clang, his sword was pulled out by his waist.

“How dare you! Do you know what place this is! If you want to fight, go outside!” Before Chu Yi made the next move, Du Sheng rebuked.

Chu Yi kept his sword back into the scabbard when he realized that he lost control. He folded his fists and said towards Master Du, “Please forgive me, Master Du. I just could not tolerate him bluffing in front of you.”

Master Du did not say anything.

“Master Du, is this enough?” Ye Qingtang did not bother to confront Chu Yi. Instead, she took out 250 grams of pure black Millennium Meteoric Iron from her space ring.

The moment when the Millennium Meteoric Iron was taken out, the temperature in the Bliss Forging Workshop suddenly dropped. It seemed that winter arrived as the surrounding was freezing.

Everyone’s eyes were fixed on the meteoric iron in Ye Qingtangs’s hands. They all frowned as they did not know what kind of meteoric iron that was.

The Millennium Meteoric Iron was too rare. They had all heard about it, but no one had seen it before. Even Du Sheng, as Master Du’s disciple, also had not seen Millennium Meteoric Iron before.

At the same time Ye Qingtang took out the meteoric iron, the indifference in Master Du’s eyes was replaced by astonishment.

Based on Master Du’s experience, he was certain that Ye Qingtang was holding Millennium Meteoric Iron!

The Millennium Meteoric Iron was cold in property. Around 250 grams of them would be enough to lower the temperature in the surroundings.

“Millennium Meteoric Iron… You really have Millennium Meteoric Iron!” Master Du said surprisingly.

Chu Yi and the rest of the people were stunned as they heard Master Du’s words.

This guy really has Millennium Meteoric Iron?!

If others told them that was Millennium Meteoric Iron, they would not believe them. However, Master Du confirmed that, and he was definitely correct.

“Master Du, this is the down payment. If you’re willing to help me to forge a weapon, I will offer another 250 grams,” Ye Qingtang said and smiled.

The way everyone looked at Ye Qingtang changed.

He can offer 500 grams of Millennium Meteoric Iron as payment?! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Chu Yi stared at the Millennium Meteoric Iron in Ye Qingtang’s hand closely. If he could…

“Du Sheng, send the guests off,” Master Du Sheng suddenly said.

“Oh… Leave now. Master will not help you even if you have five kilograms, not to mention the 500 grams you offered.” Du Sheng nodded and spoke to Ye Qingtang.

Before Ye Qingtang said anything, Master Du frowned and said, “I mean this young man can stay. Send off the rest.”
