Chapter 162: Giant Lizard (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The level 6 Giant Lizard was a high-level demonic beast, and its ferocity induced fear.

Surrounding that huge frame were dozens of Giant Lizards of varied sizes clustered together. Looking across, it was like a patch of rugged, yellowish gray rocks gathered together! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Target locked. Find a suitable place to direct the small Giant Lizards away immediately!” Gu Yanqiu fixed his eyes on the mission’s target and immediately gave an order for everyone to get into action. When he finished his sentence, he instinctively looked at Ye Qingtang and was very worried that she could not react in time since it was her first mission.

Moreover, there were too many small Giant Lizards that had to be directed away, and there would be some difficulty with just only three people.

However…

Just when Gu Yanqiu turned to look at Ye Qingtang, he suddenly realized that the moment he spoke, Ye Qingtang had already sprinted from her hiding place to stand above a huge rock. Her sleeves were rolled up, revealing a hidden blade in them.

Almost around the time when Gu Yanqiu looked at her, Ye Qingtang suddenly shot out a few arrows from her hidden blade successively, and every arrow landed on the most fatal points of the small Giant Lizards. That hidden blade was a secret weapon she used in her previous life, and she specially made it before she left Lin Town. It was small and very convenient when armed on her arms and hidden in her sleeves.

The sudden attack caused the harassed Giant Lizards to growl in fury and look towards the direction of the attacker where they saw Ye Qingtang standing at a very obvious position.

“Psst!” The level 6 Giant Lizard let out an angry growl, and the entire ground trembled.

“What is Ye Qingtang doing!” Meng Sheng looked in shock at Ye Qingtang who suddenly jumped out.

“She… she is attracting the small Giant Lizards’ attention?” Another disciple who was hiding with Meng Sheng was shocked.

Meng Sheng’s face darkened.

“Is she crazy? Why is she standing at that kind of position to attract the Giant Lizards’ attention? Does she think she can run faster than the Giant Lizards? I think she just wants to seek death! This is the good junior sister that Gu Yanqiu found? I think she is simply tired of living!”

Ye Qingtang’s action indeed caught everyone off-guard. Gu Yanqiu was shocked and mentally noted that things were going bad.

The number of Giant Lizards was already beyond their expectation, and this would only multiply the burden of those in charge of attracting the Giant Lizards’ attention. The other two disciples in charge of directing the small Giant Lizards away had not even got to action, and Ye Qingtang actually rushed out alone—this was simply seeking death.

“Quick, the both of you go up immediately to distract them!” Gu Yanqiu anxiously instructed the other two disciples.

But the timing was ultimately a little too late. All the Giant Lizards’ attention was focused on Ye Qingtang. With an angry growl from the Level 6 Giant Lizard, the small beasts immediately sprinted towards the rock that Ye Qingtang was standing on!

The army of Giant Lizards was like a huge wave, paralyzing onlookers. Qin Huan and the rest who were in hiding were burning with anxiety.

But just when everyone was breaking out in cold sweat for Ye Qingtang, she took a clear look at the direction the Giant Lizards were moving in and directly leaped onto another piece of rock that was a few meters away. When her heels touched the ground, she shot out a few more arrows which landed in the army of Giant Lizards and killed a few small-sized ones straight away.

This move utterly angered the other Giant Lizards, and they sped up crazily, dashing towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was not in a hurry. As she focused on the Giant Lizards’ movements, she searched for locations in her surrounding that she could relocate to from the corner of her eyes at the same time. With a few jumps, she single-handedly led the army of Giant Lizards out of the cave’s entrance!
