What laid before them was a huge black crocodile crazily chasing after a handsome gentleman and a stunning lady. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“Isn’t that… Young Miss Ouyang Qian of the Ouyang family clan from the Nine Nights Dynasty…”

Many super sects disciples recognized Ouyang Qian, who was possessed by the Blood Moon Elder, at one eye.

“That demonic beast… is a king-level demonic beast?”

After seeing the black crocodile that was chasing after two people, many super sects disciples were stunned.

King-level demonic beasts rarely appeared in the outer world and were usually active in the deepest areas of dangerous mountain ranges. They were extremely powerful, with their combat power being at least at the peak of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. Many king-level demonic beasts at the level of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord existed as well.

For example, the combat power of Yunxiao Sect’s sect protector divine beast was as good as the early-stage of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

There was a wide division between the Martial Qi realm and Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm.

The Martial Qi realm was divided into three Heavens. For example, the most powerful stage at Martial Qi Level Three was only the Third Heaven. However, the standards for Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm were completely different.

Yin Yang Perfected Lord was divided into nine Heavens, with the First Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord being the early-stage and Ninth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord as the peak. In a cultivator’s journey, entering the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm opened a new world for the cultivators. The Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm was divided into nine Heavens.

Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm was also divided into Yin Lord and Yang Lord. People at the First to Sixth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord were called a Yin Lord.

People at the Seventh to Ninth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord were known as a Yang Lord.

However, the number of Yang Lords on this mainland could be counted with one hand as most were Yin Lords.

At that instant, everyone’s eyes landed on that king-level demonic beast. A murderous air lingered around its body, and one could not tell how profound its skills were.

“It can’t be a king-level demonic beast that has reached the Yin Lord level, right…”

Everyone sized up the huge black crocodile in astonishment.

A Fiendcelestial Beast before them had been chasing after their lives for many days, and now, another king-level demonic beast appeared…

“F*ck you!” After seeing the king-level demonic beast, the huge white tiger that initially had a majestic presence was enraged and scolded loudly.

Everyone did not know what happened.

All they saw was the white tiger leaping towards the king-level demonic beast in an instant.

“Holy Lady… Careful!”

The Blood Moon Elder could not help but shout after seeing the Fiendcelestial Beast jumping towards them.

However…

The white tiger completely ignored Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder and landed on the body of the huge black crocodile.

“F*ck you!”

The white tiger met the king-level demonic beast’s eyes and swore furiously.

As the huge crocodile looked at the white tiger before it, it was a little confused. It seemed to have never offended this white tiger before.

“I’ve been chased after for my life by humans and demonic beasts in the outside world… I hid in this Hell of Avicinaraka with much difficulty, but humans came here to kill me. Even you wish to eat my flesh and drink my blood!” The white tiger shouted as it glared at the giant crocodile which barged into his line of sight.

The giant crocodile was dumbfounded by the tiger’s roars. As a king-level demonic beast, its spiritual wisdom was already activated, and thus, it naturally could understand what this white tiger was saying.

However, it was clearly chasing after the lives of those two humans who ruined its blessed Grotto-heaven. When had it ever offended this white tiger before its eyes?

They had never seen each other before…

When did it wish to eat the white tiger’s flesh and drink its blood…
