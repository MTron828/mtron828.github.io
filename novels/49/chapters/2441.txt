Chapter 2442: Big Yellow Dog (3)

Ye Qingtang was amused by the big yellow dog’s claim. This was the biggest joke she had ever heard. A dog was saying it had powerful people backing it and that she could not afford to offend it?

Seeing Ye Qingtang remain silent, the big yellow dog thought she was frightened off by its claim. “Young lady, it doesn’t matter who I am. You just need to know that you cannot afford to offend a famous canine like me.”

“How famous?” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“How famous?” The big yellow dog gave a very human-like snort. “No one in this world dares to disrespect me. I have butchered deities in the sky and caught dragons in the sea. With a single swipe of my paw, I can cause the earth to shake and tear apart.”

“So formidable?” Ye Qingtang was still holding onto its leg.

“I am not in the habit of boasting. If I was as bad-tempered as before, you would have already been dead. Let go of my leg first and let us talk things out,” said the big yellow dog.

Ye Qingtang remained silent but scooped up the dog and flew back to a tall tree.

“Let me down! Get your hands off me!” The big yellow dog hollered.

Pointedly ignoring the big yellow dog’s cries, Ye Qingtang brought it to the top of the tree.

“Are you going to let me go? I won’t hold back anymore if you don’t!” The big yellow dog was anxious now.

“I want to see what you can do.” Ye Qingtang smiled again. As Ye Qingtang watched, the big yellow dog bared its teeth and bit her arm.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. It was truly just a common dog…

“How about that? Are you scared now?” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang smugly.

Ye Qingtang was still speechless.

Yes… She was?so?terrified.

The big yellow dog prattled non-stop about how dangerous he was until Ye Qingtang frowned. “Lower your voice. You’ll attract those monsters and then you will be doomed.”

“Monsters?” The big yellow dog looked thoughtful. “Do you mean those above-Emperor level monsters?”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flashed. It appeared like this dog was really extraordinary. It even knew about the above-Emperor levels.

But the big yellow dog did not look scared at all. It only gave a wolfish smirk. “Those pesky little things? What’s there to be afraid of? I already told you that I have gone up to the skies to butcher deities, and into the sea to capture…”

Ye Qingtang, “Turtles?”

“Dragons!” The big yellow dog harrumphed. Don’t touch me, stay away from me.” Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“You are the most boastful dog I have ever met.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Boast?” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang. “I never boast, I only speak the truth. Do you really take me for a dog?”

“If not, then what are you?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“A canine!” The big yellow dog huffed.

Although Ye Qingtang wanted to say something, she just kept silent. Why was she always encountering such weird things?

“I am not boasting. Even those above-Emperor level minions have to respect me. They would give way if they encountered me,” the big yellow dog claimed.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. She had no idea if those above-Emperor level monsters would give way to it, but there was one thing she could be sure of. Those monsters probably couldn’t even see it.

“How long have you been in the Wailing Well?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Wailing Well?” The big yellow dog looked puzzled as if it had no idea what a Wailing Well was. “What Wailing Well?”

“Why are you acting all puzzled? We are in the Wailing Well now, aren’t we?”
