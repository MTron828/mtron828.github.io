When Ye Qingtang saw Jiang Shaobai being dragged into the ground by those hands, she panicked and quickly shot her black flames towards it.

The undead were all fearful of the black flames and retreated quickly.

Without hesitating for another second, Ye Qingtang flew straight to Jiang Shaobai and scooped him up as she shot black flames at Little White Tiger to help it out of its predicament. She threw Jiang Shaobai onto its back.

“Take care of them.”

Ye Qingtang breathed a sigh of relief when she saw Jiang Shaobai land safely on Little White Tiger’s back. She quickly darted to Mu Feiruo and Baili Xi, saving them as well.

“Hot!”

“I’m going to die to this heat!”

The undead burnt by the black flames wailed in pain. Tears of blood flowed from their once-empty eyes.

Under the curse of the Cursed True God, the people trapped here would never die. They would never find peace even though they were already in bits and pieces.

As she looked at the sea of crying faces, Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but feel a strong sense of revulsion at all the evil in this mystic realm.

The True God had hated the primordial humans for their betrayal and cursed them with this immortality, turning this entire place into a living hell.

It was at this moment that Ye Qingtang understood why those powerful men with only their head left had refused to lead her to the Cemetery of the True Gods.

They had probably already seen all of this...

This was a nightmare no one would want to experience twice. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

But she had no time for second thoughts as the undead covering the ground reached out at them relentlessly, wanting to drag them into the ground. Ye Qingtang could only keep shooting her flames at them, making them retreat.

The only one who was spared was Little Heavenly Demon. The undead seemed to fear its presence and all shrank away from it whenever it passed by.

Noticing this, Ye Qingtang immediately scooped Little Heavenly Demon into her arms before leaping and landing on Little White Tiger’s back.

The undead didn’t dare reach out towards them as Little Heavenly Demon breathed down at them. They could only glare at them with their glowing red eyes.

“How many bodies are there exactly?” Little White Tiger said as it looked at the crowded sea of undead below them. Some of their heads had already been twisted by the arms of the other people, leaving only a thin layer of skin hanging on the bones.

But even in this state, they were unable to die. Even as their heads were smashed by the other undead and their brain matter was smattered all over the ground, their eyes remained open as they howled miserably. It was a perversely morbid scene that gave them the chills.

They were better off dead than alive and stuck in this limbo between the two realms. As long as the bones of the Cursed True God were still around, they ever be able to escape their state of being neither alive nor dead.

“Ye... Qingtang...”

Ye Qingtang suddenly heard a familiar sound.

Her head snapped towards it, scanning the bodies for something familiar. Finally she noticed someone familiar among the sea of faces.

“Zhan Rao?”

Zhan Rao, who had gone missing earlier, was now buried in the sea of undead. Compared to the other undead, his face didn’t look as gray, but it was pale and bloodless.

However, his eyes were surrounded by a red glow as the light from his eyes slowly faded. One of his arms was missing as well and he seemed to be in a trance.
