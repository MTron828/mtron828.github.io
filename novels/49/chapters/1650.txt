Chapter 1651: See You In the Arena (3)

“You!” Jiang Yisheng was quivering with rage, but another Jiang Family youth held him back.

In the Qiu Family, Qiu Chen was the most powerful member of his generation. Jiang Yisheng was certainly no match for him.

“What’s the matter? Are you afraid?” Qiu Chen laughed softly. “If you can’t beat us, you should just admit it. There’s no need for all this bluff and bluster. Your Jiang Family has not beaten the Qiu Family in the Martial Arts Championship for many years.”

Jiang Yisheng wished he could go and punch Qiu Chen in the mouth. Jiang Shaobai suddenly stepped forward and stood smilingly in front of Qiu Chen.

“If you want to fight, I can play with you.”

“Shaobai.” Jiang Yisheng was startled.

Qiu Chen could not help but frown when he saw Jiang Shaobai. He was about to say something when he suddenly heard a mocking laugh.

“Hey, what is the Qiu Family up to? Are they planning to spar with the Jiang Family before the Martial Arts Championship? Sure... I happen to be free right now. Let’s play together.” At some point, Jiang Yiran had appeared in the vicinity. With him were Jiang Yanyun and a dozen other Jiang Family youths.

Qiu Chen narrowed his eyes. The spirit energy around him began to ripple. Next to him, Qiu Heyang’s expression also flickered. He secretly caught hold of Qiu Chen’s wrist and shook his head.

“Jiang Shaobai and Jiang Yanyun are both here. The Jiang Family greatly outnumbers us. If we really fight, neither side will be at an advantage. If the Elder finds out...” Qiu Heyang said softly.

“Do you think I’m afraid of them? So what if Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai are here?” Qiu Chen said coldly.

Qiu Heyang whispered in Qiu Chen’s ear. Qiu Chen’s gaze swept over the crowd, and he spotted a shy figure on a nearby beach.

This was the young girl who had hid behind the Qiu Family elder. At that moment, the girl was walking towards them. She had a nervous expression and did not dare to look at the Jiang Family. She only lowered her head and sneaked a glance at Qiu Chen and the others. “Elder said... we are not... not to get into fights...”

A sharp look flashed across Qiu Chen’s eyes, but he suppressed his rage and raised his head to look at Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai.

“I’m not interested in sparring with you. If you aren’t reconciled to your defeat, you can beat me in the Martial Arts Championship arena. As long as someone in the Jiang Family can beat me, I will publicly admit that I was at fault. If you can’t, then if we ever encounter each other on the Island of Immortal Footsteps, you must keep far away from me.”

“Don’t worry. Elder Brother Yun certainly won’t kill you in the arena. He’ll leave you with at least one last breath,” Jiang Yiran said with a cold laugh.

Qiu Chen grunted coldly. Then, he led the rest of the Qiu Family group and turned to leave.

The shy girl from the Qiu Family silently bowed her head and followed them. As she was leaving, she cast a quick glance at the little white tiger, who was in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“How infuriating! Those bastards from the Qiu Family are asking for it!” Jiang Yisheng glared at the departing figures of the Qiu Family. He gritted his teeth in rage.

“Forget it. Look, your face is all swollen from your beating. If you could really beat them, would you have been beaten up so badly?” Jiang Yiran glanced at the bruises on Jiang Yisheng’s face and spoke bluntly. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“They relied on their superior numbers to bully us. If it was a one-on-one fight, I would not be afraid of them.”

“Hmph. You go challenge Qiu Chen or Qiu Heyang and see what happens then.” Jiang Yiran crossed his arms.

“You!”

“Shut up.” Jiang Yanyun looked frosty. “Are you done? If you are, you better go back and cultivate.”
