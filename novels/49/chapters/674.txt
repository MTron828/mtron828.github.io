The Blood Moon Elder peeked his head out without waiting for Ye Qingtang say anything. Once Ouyang Qian’s face appeared, the few guards immediately let them pass.

The Ouyang family clan’s influence in Nine Nights Dynasty was extraordinary, and the guards at the monarch city naturally recognized the Young Miss of the Ouyang family clan. It was, however, that they found it strange: since when would Ouyang family clan’s Young Miss sit in such a plain carriage?

As the carriage entered the monarch city successfully, Ye Qingtang glanced at the scenery in the city. Seeing that they were about to reach the main door of the Ouyang family clan, she suddenly turned to look at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Do you remember everything I said about Ouyang Qian and the Ouyang family clan?”

“Rest assured, Holy Lady. I remember them clearly.” The Blood Moon Elder nodded, knowing the seriousness of the matter.

The Ouyang family clan was the number one family clan in Nine Nights Dynasty, and its heritage was not what original family clans could compare to.

The Blood Moon Elder stole Ouyang Qian’s body currently, and if he accidentally let slip anything, the Ouyang family clan would skin him alive.

“Ouyang Qian behaves bossily, and the only person she is slightly obedient to is her father, who is Ouyang family clan’s Family Clan Master, Ouyang Jian. As long as you remember what I said previously clearly, there should not be any problems.” Ye Qingtang warned.

“Noted,” the Blood Moon Elder said and nodded. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Wasn’t it just a bossy Young Miss?

How difficult was that?

As they spoke, the carriage had already reached the main door of Ouyang family clan.

When the few guards standing at the Ouyang family clan door saw a simple carriage stopping before them, they frowned immediately and walked up.

“This is Ouyang family clan’s territory. Miscellaneous people are not to stay…”

Before waiting for the guard to finish speaking, a loud shout suddenly traveled out from the carriage.

“How dare you! Who gave you the audacity to stop my carriage?”

The moment that sound came out, the Ouyang family clan guards were stunned. They were more than familiar with this voice. Didn’t it belong to their Young Miss, Ouyang Qian?

As the guards were taken aback, the Blood Moon Elder who was in Ouyang Qian’s skin walked out of the carriage with arrogance and impatience written all over her exquisite face.

“A group of good-for-nothings. Don’t you all recognize me already!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted coldly with a frown.

“Greetings, Young Miss!” The group of guards bowed hurriedly as they broke out in a cold sweat. How would they have thought that their distinguished Young Miss would actually sit in such an old carriage?

Ye Qingtang secretly raised her brows as she watched the Blood Moon Elder’s arrogant attitude.

It seems that the Blood Moon Elder had adapted to his new identity pretty well… That bossiness is quite on point.

“Hmph.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder lifted his chin arrogantly. At least he was an elder of Blood Moon Sect a thousand years ago. This mighty stance was at his fingertips. If he was not thrown into this pit, he would not have gotten into so much trouble. Now that he saw how fearful the Ouyang family clan’s guards behaved, it was really…

Great!

“Make way quickly.” Without looking at those guards, the Blood Moon Elder walked in himself. Ye Qingtang subsequently brought the little white tiger down the carriage and followed behind the Blood Moon Elder into the Ouyang family clan residence.

The guards at the door could only watch that beautiful young man beside their Young Miss in surprise.

Where did this beautiful young man jump out from?
