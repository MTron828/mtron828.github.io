Chapter 2482: Kneel (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Nearby, the West Sea Tribe General was sweating profusely. As he knelt on the beast’s back, he did not dare to move. The Yongle Tribe General also retreated a few steps and lowered his head to await orders.

Ye Qingtang still could not completely adapt to this sudden change. She did not know what the big yellow dog did but she was certain of one thing. The West Sea Tribe General was scared out of his wits and the Yongle Tribe General seemed to have complete faith in her identity.

“Ancestor Qing, how should we deal with the West Sea Tribe?” The Yongle Tribe General asked after a long while.

Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment before replying, “West Sea Tribe General.”

“Ancestor, I await your orders…”

The West Sea Tribe General’s body trembled as he immediately responded.

“Take your troops and leave. As for whether the West Sea Tribe will be punished for offending me, my words carry no weight. Everything will be decided by the Demon Emperor,” Ye Qingtang said expressionlessly.

“Demon Emperor…”

The West Sea Tribe General was astonished. Could it be that the Ancestor before him was not Demon Emperor Yongle?!

Originally, the West Sea Tribe General had thought that Demon Emperor Yongle had once again appeared. Who else but Demon Emperor Yongle could possess such a terrifying aura?

However, the West Sea Tribe General realized that he was wrong. This Ancestor was not Demon Emperor Yongle, but one of his followers.

It was hard to imagine. A mere follower of the Demon Emperor Yongle already possessed such unparalleled, almost invincible power. What level was the true Demon Emperor Yongle at then?

...

Meanwhile, inside the Yongle Tribe…

The Flying Star Academy teacher had a pained expression. He was burning with anxiety and did not know what to do. It was clear that the Yongle Tribe General did not fully trust them. Now that the West Sea Tribe had come knocking on their door, they were going to force them to their deaths…

If they did not manage this properly, their identities would definitely be exposed by the Yongle Tribe General. By then, there would be no need for the West Sea Tribe to seek revenge on them. The Yongle Tribe would not let them leave this place alive either.

Not far away, Lu Yuanxiang and the other students were also worried, but they pretended to be calm on the surface.

Before they had more time to think, Ye Qingtang and the big yellow dog returned. The Yongle Tribe General followed behind Ye Qingtang respectfully.

“Demon Emperor, the West Sea Tribe has been subdued by me and no longer dares to act rashly. I wonder how the Demon Emperor is going to deal with the West Sea Tribe and their General.” Ye Qingtang walked to the Flying Star Academy teacher and cupped her fists in respect. At the same time, Ye Qingtang winked at the tutor of the Flying Star Academy teacher.

“The West Sea Tribe General has been subdued?”

Everyone, including the teacher, was astonished. How did Ye Qing manage to deceive the West Sea Tribe General?

Nevertheless, as puzzled as they were, they could not show it.

The Flying Star Academy teacher said casually, “It’s just a small West Sea Tribe. To think you spent so much time on them.”

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched. “It is indeed my fault for not doing my job well and wasting time.”

“Forget it. Let’s not talk about it. How do you think the West Sea Tribe should be dealt with?” asked the Flying Star Academy teacher.

“I think that those who are ignorant are not guilty. Although the West Sea Tribe was disrespectful, it was not intentional. The Demon Emperor has always been benevolent. How about we let them off this once?” Ye Qingtang said.

“Yes, Qing. What you said is exactly what I had in mind. Considering the ignorance of the West Sea Tribe, I will not pursue the matter today.. If it happens again, I will eliminate one of their bloodlines,” The Flying Star Academy teacher nodded as he spoke.
