Chapter 966 Another Incident (1)

Ye Qingtang looked at the sword that was being placed before her. Her eyes did not even flicker.

“How could we accept such an item?” said Ye Ling

“Master, please don’t stand on ceremony with me. My Grandfather is currently an elder in the Ye Family, and I am also a member of the Ye Family. Also… if I can help the Eldest Young Lady in any way, I am happy to do so.” Dan Yifan spoke smilingly. Then, he raised his eyes and looked at Ye Qingtang, who still had not reached out to accept the sword.

“Eldest Young Lady, please don’t stand on ceremony.”

“I acknowledge your good intentions.” Ye Qingtang looked at the sword that had been handed to her. She did not know whether to laugh or to cry, but her face showed no sign of her thoughts.

“I also have a sword which I obtained recently, and I’m used to it.”

When Dan Yifan heard this, his gaze involuntarily fell on the sword at Ye Qingtang’s waist.

He could not tell the origins of the sword, but it looked very ordinary.

However, since Ye Qingtang had said so, Dan Yifan could not force her to take the sword. Everything he did was only a formality, and he only did it because Ye Qingtang was the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family.

“In that case, I won’t force you.” Dan Yifan spoke laughingly. However, before he could store the sword away, another youth from the Ye Family stepped forward.

“Elder Brother Dan… could you give the sword you had to me?” This youth was the Great Elder’s disciple. Since young, he had been an ardent admirer of the talented Dan Yifan.

“Why not? Take it then, but remember not to neglect your cultivation.” Dan Yifan responded frankly and handed the sword over to the youth.

The youth took the sword, and his eyes filled with joy and surprise. He reverently held the sword in his arms.

When the other youths saw this, they could not help but feel chagrined that they had not taken the initiative to ask for the sword first.

Although this sword could not compare to a yellow-grade weapon, it was also a top-quality ordinary weapon! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Ling looked at the youth who had obtained the sword. He turned to look at Ye Qingtang with a complicated expression in his eyes.

He was rather puzzled as to why his daughter had repeatedly refused Dan Yifan’s help. One must know that with Dan Yifan’s ability, Ye Qingtang would greatly benefit if he could give her one or two pointers.

However, Ye Ling did not say anything. He was afraid that Ye Qingtang had refused out of pride.

After all, Ye Qingtang was the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family.

Ye Qingtang sensed Ye Ling’s gaze, but she only smiled and gave her father a peaceful look.

Although Ye Ling had not said much about the Ye Family’s situation, what Ye Qingtang had witnessed showed that the Ye Family was currently in turmoil.

“Great Elder, you really have an excellent grandson.” Third Elder smiled and said to the Great Elder as he looked at Dan Yifan, who was surrounded by an admiring crowd.

The Great Elder smiled. Although he did not say anything, the pride that shone in his eyes showed how pleased he was with his grandson.

Just as everyone was talking and laughing, the main gate of the Ye House suddenly burst open.

The people from the Duan Family who had just left had suddenly returned. This time, besides the youth that Dan Yifan had injured, there was another man with a cold and arrogant countenance.

“Elder Brother Duan, it was this fellow! He injured me just now!” The person that Dan Yifan had injured was bandaged. He lifted his finger and pointed to Dan Yifan, who was surrounded by an admiring crowd.

The cold and arrogant man’s gaze fell on Dan Yifan. It was as if his face was covered by a layer of frost.
