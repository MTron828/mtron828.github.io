Elder Mo frowned immediately, and his gaze shifted away from Ye Qingtang without giving any reply.

Ye Qingtang was only a reserve disciple. How was she able to battle with Fu Lingtian?

Everyone was still waiting for someone to say something, but the Qinglin Sect elders were beaming as they looked at Fu Lingtian in satisfaction.

Apart from the usage rights of Drifting Cloud Island, the three sects still had other wagers in the Three Sect Competition every year.

In this competition, most of the wagers of the sects were similar to those in previous years. Other than Spirit Pills and elixirs, each sect even added a Dharma treasure as wagers.

With Fu Lingtian claiming the champion position, Qinglin Sect would become the biggest winner once again.

“Haha. Qinglin Sect really trained an amazing disciple…” the Wind Moon Sect elder looked at the Qinglin Sect elders and said with a laugh.

All of the elders witnessed Fu Lingtian’s abilities. He had an extremely strong comprehension of martial skills, and almost no one in the same level as him could be his opponent.

While Wind Moon Sect’s wagers were not little, their loss would not be too large with at least a second place.

“You flatter us. Shen Qingyu from your Wind Moon Sect is extraordinarily gifted. He is merely young now and does not have enough experience. In a few years’ time, he will definitely be able to yield brilliant results and claim the champion position.” The Qinglin Sect elder laughed.

At that moment, the expressions of everyone from Xuanling Sect were extremely ugly.

The conversation between Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect seemed to have completely ignored the presence of Xuanling Sect.

If Wind Moon Sect could place first years later, didn’t that mean that they, Xuanling Sect, would always be at the bottom?

If that was the case, what was the point of competing?

In these few years, Xuanling Sect did not have any fate with the usage rights of Drifting Cloud Island. Xuanling Sect’s wagers were similar to the other two sects every year, and the losses that they sustained over the years were already extremely horrifying.

Yet, Xuanling Sect could not refuse to participate. The Three Sect Competition traced back to hundreds of years ago and had already become a tradition. If they were unwilling to participate, it would mean that they were afraid of the other two sects, and should this be circulated, their reputation would drop drastically.

Elder Qin, who had already sent the Blood Moon Sect Elder for the array formation competition, arrived at the moment and happened to see the situation. His brows were slightly furrowed as he sighed.

“Ah…”

If they had to blame, they could only blame the fact that Xuanling Sect did not have any better disciples. Being last in the Three Sect Competition every year, they could not blame Qinglin Sect disciples for being too powerful.

Zhu Changge’s fists clenched as he looked at the expressions of the elders. Although he wanted to fight for the sect’s glory, Fu Lingtian’s skills were too frightening, and especially after sparring with him, he realized he had no chance of winning.

Elder Mo shook his head. The Three Sect Competition had already ended, and he naturally did not think much of Ye Qingtang’s request. Xuanling Sect was to be the last again this year, and this was a definite fact.

“I declare this year’s competition over. The first place goes to Qinglin Sect, the second place goes to Wind Moon Sect, and the third place goes to Xuanling Sect…”

A Qinglin Sect elder walked up and announced rather proudly.

“Hold on!”

Right when the Three Sect Competition was about to come to an end, a voice was heard.

Elders from the three sects frowned slightly at the voice, and they looked at Ye Qingtang, displeased.

“Xuanling Sect disciple, do you have any objections?” The elder who announced the results was impatient.

“Elder, the competition hasn’t ended. I haven’t entered the ring for a match,” Ye Qingtang said slowly with a calm expression.

The moment Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, everyone from Qinglin Sect and Wind Moon Sect was stunned.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
