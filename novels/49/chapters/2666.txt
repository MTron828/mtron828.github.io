This meant that Ling Yan had really succeeded in possessing the body of the Demon God Han Cangming!

But how did Ling Yan do it?! This matter had completely exceeded Ye Qingtang’s understanding. Ling Yan’s martial arts skills were not even close to that of the Heavenly Venerate level, but he managed to successfully possess the body of an Immortal Emperor… no one would believe this if they heard it.

“Ling Yan… since it’s you, why did you lie to me just now!” Ye Qingtang walked to Ling Yan’s side and raised her hand, wishing she could slap him. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Ling Yan smiled at Ye Qingtang. “Miss Ye has yet to answer me how important your friend is to you.”

“Go and die.” Ye Qingtang frowned.

For the past few years, she had worried about him every day, but he was fine. He had clearly succeeded in possessing the body, but not only did he look for her, he even pretended to be Han Cangming to scare her and said that Ling Yan was already dead.

“Miss Ye... Don’t be angry.” Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang and pointed his slender finger at the tip of her nose. “I was just joking with you.”

Ye Qingtang casually flicked Ling Yan’s hand away. “Why do you want to kill Sister Ah Yao?”

A cold glint flashed across Ling Yan’s eyes when he heard Ye Qingtang’s words. He said softly, “Miss Ye has just reminded me that the Paragon is not dead yet..

If not for Miss Ye stopping me earlier, she should be dead already.”

“Do you have a grudge against her?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown.

Ling Yan shook his head and said, “No.”

Ye Qingtang, “...”

“Since there’s no grudge, why do you want to kill her?” Ye Qingtang could not understand.

Although Ye Qingtang knew that Ling Yan had his own reasons for everything he did, she still wanted to clarify things. After all, she was already Ah Yao’s sworn sister and Ah Yao sincerely treated her well. Ye Qingtang was certain of this.

“Miss Ye, do you know that you are the reincarnation of the Paragon?” Ling Yan suddenly asked.

Ye Qingtang was even more surprised. “I had my suspicions but I was unable to confirm it. Since you are certain that I am her reincarnation, why do you want to kill her?”

So she was the reincarnation of the Paragon. Ye Qingtang had guessed that. However, Ye Qingtang could not understand why Ling Yan wanted to kill Ah Yao, who treated her so well.

“It’s precisely because Miss Ye is the reincarnation of the Paragon that I want to kill her,” Ling Yan said.

“Please explain.” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“If things progress according to history, the Paragon will only die 10,000 years later. You will only be born after she dies,” Ling Yan said slowly.

“But if the Paragon dies in this era, Miss Ye will reincarnate in advance... in that case, after you reincarnate, you will face the calamity again in this era. You will bear the responsibility of the Heart of Heavenly Dao in this era...” Ling Yan explained.

Ye Qingtang’s heart skipped a beat. Although she did not fully understand what Ling Yan was saying, she had a general grasp of his meaning.

According to Ling Yan’s intentions, he wanted the Paragon to die now.. Once the Paragon died, Ye Qingtang would be born...
