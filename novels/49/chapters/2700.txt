Chapter 2701: Silver Star Holy Lord (2)

The eyes of that Silver Star Holy Lord suddenly turned silver. Two terrifying silver beams shot out from his eyes like starlight as they swept towards the deep pit.

“Strong auras, but nothing there...”

The Silver Star Holy Lord muttered.

Ye Qingtang, Wan Rong and the rest looked at each other.

This guy could actually sense their aura?! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang and the others did not exist at all in this era and in this memory, and these people were just memory fragments.

Even so...

The Great Immortal Temple disciples could not imagine just how powerful these people would be if they really existed.

“Don’t be so loud... I’m afraid they might hear you.” One of the Great Immortal Temple disciple’s expressions changed slightly.

“Don’t worry. They would have discovered us long ago if they could see us. To them, we are transparent and do not exist at all. After all, as Junior Sister Ye Yue said, these existences are just memories of the owner of the soul bone.”

/

No one refuted these words. Even if they were really discovered, they would still be safe. Memories could not harm or reverse reality.

Ye Qingtang ignored their discussions. Her gaze landed on the Silver Star Holy Lord and surprise flashed across her eyes. This Silver Star Holy Lord... looked exactly like Ling Yan. Moreover, his silver eyes were filled with the extremely terrifying power of the Heavenly Dao.

Ye Qingtang stared at the Silver Star Holy Lord with a slight frown. Why was it that this existence in front of her looked exactly like Ling Yan, but his aura and mannerisms were different... Moreover, this Heavenly Dao power was too terrifying and could not be compared to the trace of Heavenly Dao power that Ye Qingtang absorbed.

“The prophecy might be true...”

The Silver Star Holy Lord muttered after a long time. An imperceptible ripple appeared in his calm eyes.

“Holy Lord, are you saying... a thousand years ago...” One of the monks asked with a frown.

“Correct.” Silver Star Holy Lord nodded, recovering his cold attitude. “In the upper realm, the Perfected Immortal from the Karma Bloodline Clan previously said that a thousand years from now, my domain will suffer an apocalypse.”

“Apocalypse...”

One of the Daoists looked pensive.

“Holy Lord, do not worry yourself. We are in charge of this domain. There’s no need to worry about the so-called apocalypse.”

“High Monk, I heard that you have some grand-disciples who have gone to the Divine Venerate Domain.” The Silver Star Holy Lord’s gaze landed on the eldest monk who had yet to speak.

The monk he was referring to was dressed in thin clothes. His hands were clasped together and there was a golden Buddha totem on his glabella. He floated in midair and was motionless, but his body inadvertently emitted a monstrous aura, as if nothing in this world could invade him.

“The High Monk’s grand-disciples have indeed entered the mortal world and gone to the Divine Venerate Domain... to suppress the evil in that world.” Another one of the monks nodded.

“At least some juniors had stayed behind.” The Silver Star Holy Lord said indifferently.

“Holy Lord, what do you mean by that? You can stop our domain from being destroyed just because you said so?”

“There’s nothing wrong with what the Holy Lord said. But the mandate of heaven... cannot be violated.” The High Monk, who had been silent the entire time, finally spoke up.

“Even if it’s mandated by heaven, I want to try,” said the Silver Star Holy Lord.

“Try what?”

“To defy the heavens,” the Silver Star Holy Maiden stated, his eyes erupting with a terrifying light.
