Chapter 1663: Careless Words Cause Trouble (1)

Mu Ruxue glanced at the girl plucking her delicate fingers over the zither. Although she was unusually beautiful, her looks were far inferior. Mu Ruxue’s lips curled and she took a jade flute from her space ring and began to play it. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The beautiful sound of the flute mingled with that of the zither, and everyone looked at Mu Ruxue. All the youths youths were amazed when they saw her extraordinary beauty.

Given that the matches during the Martial Arts Championship were so intense, no one would go out of their way to notice someone’s looks. Only now could they relax and admire them.

The girl playing the zither soon realized that everyone’s gaze was fixed on Mu Ruxue. When she saw Mu Ruxue’s beauty, and that she was from the Mu family, she decided to retreat and her zither slowly trailed away.

“This Martial Arts Championship is so interesting. Do the girls of the various ancient clans all pursue such leisurely activities? They must be so carefree.” Jiang Yiran propped his chin on one hand and muttered to himself as he looked at this strange competition.

“But Mu Ruxue is exceptionally beautiful.”

“She’s still not as good looking as my goddess.” Jiang Yisheng was adamant and would not be swayed.

Jiang Shaobai glanced at Jiang Yisheng with a strange expression.

Ye Qingtang was not at all interested in who was the most beautiful, or the beauty ranking. She was completely focused on the Martial Arts Championship. With her skills, she should be able to manage the next few matches.

But if she wanted to be one of the top ten, she had to enter the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm.

But now, her abilities seemed to have stopped advancing. This troubled Ye Qingtang greatly.

The beauty rankings were created by a secret ballot. If anyone felt that a girl was particularly beautiful, he could write her name down and put it in a wooden box in the restaurant. On the last day, the box would be opened and the votes counted.

Under the influence of Mu Ruxue’s flute, many of them intended to write down her name.

“I thought that Mu Feiruo was already an exceptional beauty. I did not realize that this Mu Ruxue would be even more exquisite.”

“I think that Mu Ruxue will certainly claim the title of the most beautiful girl this year.”

“I heard that Mu Ruxue is extremely talented, no less so than Mu Feiruo.”

The youths had nothing better to do, so they started to murmur among themselves. Mu Ruxue contentedly watched the crowd’s reaction. Her lips curved in a satisfied smile.

By now, Jiang Shaobai had lost interest in his food when he saw Mu Ruxue’s attitude. He suddenly got up, dragging Ye Qingtang with him. “Elder Sister Qing, let’s go back.”

Ye Qingtang also wanted to leave early to cultivate, so she immediately rose and left with Jiang Shaobai.

When Ye Qingtang first arrived, the youths from the various ancient clans who were in the restaurant were busy chatting, and no one had noticed her in the crowd.

But at that moment, everyone’s attention was focused on Mu Ruxue. Ye Qingtang and the others were seated near her and when Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang rose to leave, they appeared in everyone’s line of sight.

“Ah, who is that? So irritating. Don’t block our view,” a youth could not help but shout.

But just as his words left his mouth, he did a double take.

He saw a gorgeous young girl slowly walking towards the stairs. The girl was absolutely expressionless. In fact, her elegant brow was slightly furrowed. It wrung their hearts to see the cares that she bore on her brow.

If Mu Ruxue’s looks could be compared to the bright sun, radiant and dazzling, then this girl’s looks were like a lonely orchid in a deserted valley. Her appearance caused everything around her to vanish, leaving only the unforgettable image of her beauty.
