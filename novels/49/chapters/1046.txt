Chapter 1047 Skill (4)

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little as she witnessed the situation inside the gourd. This… might be the most special fight she had seen between Yin Yang Perfected Lords.

It was almost impossible to find others who fought like Daoist Zijin and Bai Kui in the world.

They were no different from gangsters. There were no tricks. All their punches landed heavily on the Grand Elder.

The Grand Elder cursed in rage inside the gourd as he wished to tear them into pieces. However, he could not defend himself at all. Occasionally, he managed to kick Daoist Zijin, but the kick seemed to have no effect.

Buzz!

Around half an hour later, a weird sound came out of the ruling gourd. The three of them were thrown out by the gourd as it returned to its original size.

“What happened?” Bai Kui asked.

“There is a time limitation to the ruling gourd. Apparently time’s up… What a pity that we didn’t manage to beat him to death,” Daoist Zijin said.

Though the Grand Elder was a piece of junk inside the ruling gourd, it was easy for the two of them to fight against him, but it was hard to kill him.

The Grand Elder’s injuries were all recovered without any traces after leaving the ruling gourd.

As his martial ability was regained, the injuries from the punches would definitely be gone.

“It seems you have a death wish!”

After regaining his martial ability, the Grand Elder stared at Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin. As he shouted, the aura of the peak level of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven exploded and surrounded the two of them.

The Grand Elder turned into a shadow in the next second. He was so fast that he landed beside Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin within a split second.

The three of them were engaged in the fight again. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, within a few breaths, Daoist Zijin and Bai Kui were thrown out.

“Hehe, how much hatred do you have towards me, Bai Kui… I made you feel the greatest humiliation as a man. However, you cannot do anything to me… So heartbreaking!” The Grand Elder scorned as he stared at Bai Kui.

A cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes at that.

She wished that Bai Kui could settle this thing by himself previously. However, based on the current situation, Bai Kui was not able to fight against the Grand Elder.

“Really?” Ye Qingtang scorned.

Ye Qingtang lifted her right arm slightly. Without realizing what was happening, the Grand Elder lost control of his body under a strong and irresistible force.

The Sect Master of Yunxiao Sect was enraged. He did not feel the intense force from Ye Qingtang. He thought that it was just a junior brought by Bai Kui.

“How dare you to speak up as a junior! You’re seeking your own death!”

Before the Grand Elder was pulled to Ye Qingtang, the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master flew and smashed his palm towards her.

“How dare you!” A few branch masters immediately surrounded Ye Qingtang and fought off the YunXiao Sect Sect Master.

The two Grand Elders of Yuehua Sect and Lingyun Sect frowned heavily as they witnessed the scene.
