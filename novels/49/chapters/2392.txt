Chapter 2393: Wailing Well (2)

“How did you end up provoking those Heaven Dome Academy people?” Song Yanhan couldn’t resist asking.

“Who provoked them? They came looking for trouble themselves.” Lei Yan snorted in annoyance. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Song Yanhan looked increasingly grim. Ye Qing’s students were really all so ignorant. Couldn’t they see the disparity between their skill levels and that of the Heaven Dome Academy folks?

“Eh, isn’t that Qiu Nan?” Gong Jinyun caught a glimpse of Qiu Nan standing with another team.

The others turned to look.

As if sensing their gaze, Qiu Nan instinctively averted his eyes and pretended to chat with his teammates. Upon realizing that Qiu Nan was purposely avoiding them, the teenagers couldn’t help feeling rather upset.

“We trained together for so many weeks. This fellow… how can he be so heartless…” Lei Yan sighed in resignation.

Song Yanhan glanced at Lei Yan but remained silent.

Actually, Song Yanhan was able to see the situation more clearly than Lei Yan and the rest.

Apart from Wen Qi and Luo Sheng, the other Netherworld Academy teachers and students in Universe City were all very angry with Ye Qing and his team. Even for him, he had endured quite a number of sarcastic insults over the past couple of days.

The drawing of the lots soon concluded. Ye Qing had drawn a number somewhere in the middle.

The first team to enter the Wailing Well was from the Sky Martial Academy. Just before they entered, a yellow bean-sized ball appeared and floated above their heads. The ball followed them in.

This ball would record everything which happened to the team so that all the academy leaders would be able to watch the entire proceedings. This was also a measure to prevent someone from secretly bringing in a restricted item. In addition, it could show the performance of every single student.

One by one, the teams entered the Wailing Well, until it was finally Ye Qingtang’s turn.

Ye Qingtang led Lei Yan and the others to the entrance. After giving them a steady look, she stepped in first.

Lei Yan and the rest followed suit.

Like that, eleven figures disappeared into the darkness.

Almost immediately, she was hit with a wave of all-encompassing darkness. But soon, Ye Qingtang’s line of sight recovered a little.

At this point, she was immersed in gloomy darkness, her surroundings covered in a faint black fog. The air was bone-chillingly cold. Before she could fully observe her surroundings, Lei Yan and the others appeared behind her, and the nondescript little ball also appeared with them.

…

Wen Qi and the other academy leaders were sitting in a large hall. Multiple floating screens were strewn across the hall in a rather haphazard manner. Each screen showed a team who had entered the Wailing Well such that the actions of every single team member were displayed for everyone to see.

“This is the team which the Netherworld Academy had been hiding from the rest of us?” An elder from one of the academies turned to look at Wen Qi when he saw the image of Ye Qingtang’s team enter the Wailing Well.

Wen Qi maintained a poker face.

“I heard that a number of talented Netherworld Academy students didn’t participate in the individual martial arts competition. Even Wu Fengling’s disciple didn’t participate. Vice-President Wen, don’t tell me this is your Netherworld Academy’s trump card? So you have placed all your bets on winning this team competition?” the person asked.
