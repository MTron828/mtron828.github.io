Chapter 932 Inheritance Of The Bloodline 3

Now, only Ye Qingtang and the Divine Phoenix were left in the empty palace.

“You have Ultimate Origin Skill and are related to the phoenix. You are best suited to be my successor and follow in my footsteps,” said the Divine Phoenix.

“Thank you, Lord Divine Phoenix.” Ye Qingtang thanked the Divine Phoenix and could not help but heave a sigh of relief.

Ling Yan’s judgment was truly startling in its accuracy.

“I will also give you the Mirror of Illusions.”

With that, the Mirror of Illusions that had been abandoned by the others drifted by itself to Ye Qingtang’s hand.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes brightened slightly. She had thought that after she had chosen the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, she was no longer destined to have the Mirror of Illusions. Who knew…

Ye Qingtang immediately accepted the Mirror of Illusions. She was extremely grateful to the Divine Phoenix.

“Come with me,” said the Divine Phoenix.

…

After a short while, Ye Qingtang had followed the Divine Phoenix into the depths of the palace.

In front of them was a gigantic skeleton which gave off an indescribable, terrible majesty.

This skeleton had died many moons ago. Even so, the moment one went near, its terrible power burst forth. The powerful majesty transformed into a frightening might that seemed to shroud the entire world.

“This is…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Divine Phoenix in shock.

“As you can see, these are my bones,” said the Divine Phoenix.

The Divine Phoenix had died millions of years ago. The scarlet image today was just a remnant of its Divine Sense.

“I see.”

Ye Qingtang studied the skeleton with a shocked expression. In her two lives, this was the first time she was seeing the existence of such a frightening thing.

This must be a mature Fiendcelestial Beast at the initial grade. It contained more power than even Ye Qingtang could imagine. Even after the little white tiger reached maturity, it would not be as powerful!

“Greetings, Senior!”

Little white tiger suddenly popped its head out of Ye Qingtang’s arms and spoke to the scarlet image.

“Oh…”

The Divine Phoenix studied little white tiger and said thoughtfully, “Are you from the White Tiger Clan of the four Fiendcelestial Beasts?”

“Yes, Senior Divine Phoenix.” Little white tiger nodded obediently.

When the Divine Phoenix was nearing the peak of its initial grade, little white tiger’s father had probably not been born.

“Yes, not bad. You are unusual to be able to tame a young Fiendcelestial Beast from the White Tiger Clan.” The Divine Phoenix looked at Ye Qingtang and spoke in relief.

“Kneel.” The Divine Phoenix suddenly spoke, without waiting for Ye Qingtang to reply.

When she heard that, Ye Qingtang knelt without hesitation and bowed to the Divine Phoenix. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“From now on, you are my successor. In the future, if you meet the Divine Phoenix Clan, you must treat them well. Do you understand?” asked the Divine Phoenix.

“I understand!” said Ye Qingtang.

“Very well, arise,” said the Divine Phoenix.

With that, Ye Qingtang rose slowly.

“Leave us for a while. I have something I need to say to her,” said the Divine Phoenix as it looked at the little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

“Yes, Senior.” Little white tiger jumped from Ye Qingtang’s arms to the ground. It also dragged out the little lightning dragon and vanished without a trace.

“What is your name?” The Divine Phoenix looked at Ye Qingtang.

“My surname is Ye, my name is Qingtang.” Ye Qingtang answered truthfully.

“Qingtang, you are my successor. I will transfer the true bloodline of the Divine Phoenix to you.” As the Divine Phoenix spoke, the scarlet glow transformed into a scarlet roaring flame that immediately engulfed Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang was not harmed by this indescribable flame. Instead, the golden flame in her body seemed to resonate with it and leaped forth.
