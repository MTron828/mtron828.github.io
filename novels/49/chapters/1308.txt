Chapter 1309: Deliberate Provocation (2)

Mo Yunxian had been indulged from young and was born to a martial family. She was used to seeing dead people.

“Xian’er, wait a moment. This incident must be…” Mo You wanted to say that it was just an inconvenience.

But the sounds of wailing suddenly rang out.

He saw two white-haired old people squeezing their way through the crowd to fling themselves on the dead youth’s body.

“Fu’er! What happened to you?! Wake up! Don’t scare your father…”

“Fu’er, my Fu’er…”

These two old people burst into tears as they looked at their grandson, who had stopped breathing. Their voices were mournful and heart-rending.

“It’s all your fault! You, you killed my grandson! Give my grandson back to me!” The weeping old woman looked with bloodshot eyes at Mo You, who was astride his tall horse. She reached out to claw at him.

Under the circumstances, Mo You did not dare to retaliate. He had no choice but to dismount and try to calm the old people down.

He himself was still in a daze. Even though the young man had suddenly rushed out, his horse had not been moving too fast, and the youth should not have died.

“Old lady, please listen to me. This matter…” Mo You reached out to support the old woman who had tottered forward to make a scene. But the moment his hand brushed against the old woman’s arm.

The old woman’s eyes bulged slightly, and fresh blood spurted from her mouth, spraying Mo You’s face.

There was a loud crash.

The old lady toppled to the ground, dead.

“…” Mo You stared in disbelief at the old woman, who had collapsed before his eyes.

What is going on?

“Old lady… old lady, what’s the matter…” The old man who was left looked at his elderly wife lying in a pool of blood. Grief welled up within him as he lifted a shaking hand and pointed at Mo You.

“You… you’re so vicious. It’s not enough that you killed my grandson, but you won’t even let my old lady off… you… I’ll kill you.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Calm down, old man. Things are not what you imagine them to be. I didn’t do anything just now.” Mo You was frightened by the situation. Two people had died before his eyes in an instant, and both deaths were related to him. He was completely befuddled.

The citizens on the street could not help but stare as they saw all this unfold.

Mo You was a well-known figure in the capital, and many people knew who he was.

At that moment, the crowd was abuzz.

At that moment, Mo You was really hard-pressed to defend himself. The old man raised his walking stick and rushed towards him. The walking stick was about to smash into him when a black leather whip suddenly snaked out from the sedan behind him.

“What’s the fuss about? What do your grandson’s and your wife’s deaths have to do with my cousin? I think you’re looking for trouble! Who are you that you dare to hit my cousin?” Mo Yunxian wielded the leather whip with one hand to restrain the old man by his wrist. Her eyes were filled with impatience.

“Xian’er, stop.” Mo You was shocked to see that Mo Yunxian had acted.

Mo Yunxian frowned slightly, then impatiently flicked the whip aside.

She had not used much force, but when she withdrew the whip, the old man was flung in the direction of a nearby stall.

The stall was instantly smashed with a loud crash. The old man collapsed amongst the debris, spitting copious amounts of blood. His body quivered. Then, he died…

Three lives were gone in an instant.
