Gu Yihan nodded his head silently.

The Admirable Sky Peak disciples were originally boiling with anger because of Li Jingwen, but now, they felt powerless after hearing what Yan Shu said.

“Li Jingwen is simply relying on the fact that Water Cut Peak and Full Moon Peak are backing Blue Cloud Peak. They are merely emboldened by the support.”

“Valley Master has just taken up the post and has his own worries.”

“In the end, it’s all Ye Chen’s fault. Although other peaks stirred trouble occasionally, it didn’t blow up so big like this.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Who said it isn’t? It was already an exception for him to be apprenticed to the Valley Master. He has only entered the valley for a while, yet he has already caused such huge trouble for our Admirable Sky Peak and implicated so many fellow disciples. It would be better for such an ill-mannered person to be kicked out of the valley as soon as possible.”

The disciples did not dare to make any dissent about the Valley Master and thus vented their unhappiness on Ye Qingtang.

Those who were already displeased with Ye Qingtang using other means to be apprenticed to Perfected Xuanchen were even more irritated with her now.

“Stop talking already. Hurry up and treat your injuries if you have to. For the others, continue on with your cultivation,” Yan Shu said with a headache. He also sustained plenty of injuries earlier on and was also very vexed currently.

…

Ye Qingtang went to the Bliss Forging Workshop to talk with Master Du about the Dragon Vein, but he was not present today. Then, she asked Du Sheng to relay the message to Master Du and returned to Falling Sky Valley.

However…

The moment she stepped into Admirable Sky Peak, she sensed that there was something off with the atmosphere.

While the peak’s disciples were not friendly to her previously, they still forced a greeting on account that she was Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple. Yet, currently…

As Ye Qingtang walked in Admirable Sky Peak, she saw that all the disciples did not utter a word to her and that they looked at her with intense repulsion and resentment.

What happened?

She only went out for half a day, yet why do the Admirable Sky Peak disciples look at her as though they wanted to devour her?

When she arrived at the cultivation field, she smelled a faint smell of blood. The instant some injured disciples saw her, their eyes shot her a sharp look.

“Junior Brother Ye, you’re back.” Yan Shu, who was guiding the disciples in their cultivation, saw that Ye Qingtang returned and immediately walked to her.

“Senior Brother Yan, what happened… to you?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with shock when she saw Yan Shu, who had bruises on his face and a bandaged arm.

What happened to Yan Shu?

Why is he injured all over?

Yan Shu’s expression stiffened a little. Taking a deep breath, he said, “Li Jingwen from the Blue Cloud Peak came here just now.”

“Li Jingwen?” Ye Qingtang arched a brow. She knew of Li Jingwen from her previous life. He was the top disciple of Blue Cloud Peak’s Peak Master and had a frivolous and arrogant nature. A few years later, Li Jingwen’s skills advanced by leaps and bounds to the point that he even showed signs of surpassing Gu Yihan.

“That’s right. He came to Admirable Sky Peak to find you for you to give him an explanation.” Yan Shu nodded.

“What explanation should I give him?” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

Perhaps, it was this chuckle that ignited the Admirable Sky Peak disciples’ displeasure. A disciple with bruises on his face immediately stopped cultivating and darted to Ye Qingtang’s front.

“Why are you still acting innocent here? If you didn’t injure those Blue Cloud Peak disciples that day, why would Li Jingwen come today?”
