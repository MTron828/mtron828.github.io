When Ye Qingtang confirmed that there was no issue with the stone statue, she leaped up and retrieved the Black Heaven Water in the stone statue’s hand.

However!

The moment when Ye Qingtang obtained it, her vision suddenly blurred when her eyes swept over the stone statue again. Her mind was in a whirl, and it was as though she did not even have the strength to stand up.

Time passed. It seemed like the blink of an eye yet also like an entire century.

Ye Qingtang finally regained strength.

But the moment she opened her eyes, Ye Qingtang was stunned, and her eyes suddenly dilated.

There was no mysterious palace nor Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka…

At this instant, Ye Qingtang shockingly found out that she was no longer in that strange palace or even at any corner in the Hell of Avicinaraka but at a stable and prosperous imperial city. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Standing rooted to the ground, Ye Qingtang scanned her surroundings with a strange expression. Every place that her eyes landed on felt extremely familiar.

A figure suddenly appeared before Ye Qingtang. It was a lady with extraordinary beauty, but at that instant, that lady’s face was filled with fluster, and her steps were hurried as though she was escaping.

“That is… me?!”

Shock flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at that frantic lady.

That lady clearly had the same exact face as her!

Just as Ye Qingtang was shocked, angry cries suddenly traveled to her ears!

“The Heart of the Demon God appeared. Capture that woman!”

“As long as we catch her, the Heart of the Demon God is ours!”

Ye Qingtang looked in the direction of the voice and saw a group of people crazily chasing after her.

However, the faces of those people were very familiar to Ye Qingtang…

“This is… the second mainland’s… Central Dynasty!”

Ye Qingtang mumbled as disbelief filled her eyes.

Everything here was more than familiar. The memories that she tried hard to forget actually… replayed before her eyes again.

In her previous life, she came to the second mainland by chance ten years later, and the place she was standing right now was the largest Central Dynasty of the second mainland!

The Central Dynasty had one of the most powerful forces in the second mainland, and even the super sects on the second mainland could not be compared to it.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang entered an academy and continued to cultivate after entering the second mainland.

However, it was on this day in her previous life when the Sacred Martial Academy which she entered discovered her Heart of the Demon God…

When her Heart of the Demon God was discovered, the entire Sacred Martial Academy was deployed to obtain the Heart of the Demon God in her body.

After Ye Qingtang escaped, this news traveled to the ears of the royal family in the Central Dynasty. Thus, it sent many powerful royals to encircle and kill Ye Qingtang.

And it was on this day in her previous life where her best friend… died at the scene in order to protect her.

“Could this be… my mental demons…” Ye Qingtang shook her head. She clearly remembered that she was in the Hell of Avicinaraka…

However, as the piercing sound rang, Ye Qingtang ran forward without having time to think deeply.

Some time later, Ye Qingtang followed those powerful figures who chased after her life and arrived at a deserted land.

“Hand the Demon God over!”

“Ha. Ye Qingtang, it is a waste for the Heart of the Demon God to be in your body…”
