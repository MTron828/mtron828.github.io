Chapter 1160: Splitting The Battlefield (3)

“Qingtang… come with me.”

Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang and spoke suddenly.

Ye Qingtang immediately handed little Luo Xue over to her father, Ye Ling, and followed Perfected Xuanchen. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Qingtang and Perfected Xuanchen soon came to a desolate place.

“Qingtang, I have discovered something…” Perfected Xuanchen checked to ensure that there was no one about before speaking.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback when she saw Perfected Xuanchen’s expression. She did not know what had happened to cause Perfected Xuanchen to act so mysteriously.

“Master, may I ask what has happened?” Ye Qingtang vaguely sensed that Perfected Xuanchen had something important to tell her.

Perfected Xuanchen pondered for a moment before saying, “Qingtang, I suppose you know about little You Yun’s background?”

Although she did not know why Perfected Xuanchen had suddenly mentioned little You Yun, Ye Qingtang was naturally aware of her background.

Little You Yun was created from the power of the extraordinary lady’s spiritual abode. The source of her power was the spiritual abode. Of course, this was merely Ye Qingtang’s guess. But no matter what, little You Yun had some close connection with the extraordinary lady. Ye Qingtang even suspected that little You Yun was the extraordinary lady’s reincarnation…

“Qingtang, I’ll just speak bluntly… you may not believe me, because even I find it hard to believe it myself.” Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang mysteriously.

When she saw the serious Perfected Xuanchen looking so mysterious, Ye Qingtang could not help but laugh softly. “Master, what’s the big secret? Stop being mysterious.”

“Qingtang… yesterday I discovered by chance that… little You Yun… can control the spirit energy in this mainland!” Perfected Xuanchen finally blurted out what he had seen and heard.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when she heard Perfected Xuanchen’s words.

To be able to control the spirit energy in this mainland… what kind of concept was that?! It was akin to being a true god!

“Master, is that true?” Ye Qingtang was somewhat skeptical.

“Absolutely!” Perfected Xuanchen nodded repeatedly. “Qingtang, you should know that we martial cultivators basically rely on spirit energy. The difference between powerful and weak cultivators is the ability to control and absorb spirit energy. To become a powerful cultivator, one must be situated in a place rich in spirit energy and physically absorb this spirit energy to achieve breakthroughs to the next level… if… little You Yun can control spirit energy… then she can…”

As Perfected Xuanchen spoke, a trace of shock surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Of course, Ye Qingtang understood this principle.

If little You Yun could really control spirit energy, then in some sense, she could create gods!

“I understand…” Ye Qingtang muttered softly to herself.

Little You Yun and the extraordinary lady had some intimate connection, and this mainland was created from the extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode. It made sense that little You Yun could control the spirit energy in this mainland… It was as if the extraordinary lady herself was present!

A moment later, Ye Qingtang followed Perfected Xuanchen to the pavilion. Little You Yun was in her room.

Little You Yun’s eyes brightened the moment she saw Ye Qingtang. However, she seemed unwilling to acknowledge Perfected Xuanchen and pouted.

When he saw that, Perfected Xuanchen looked rather embarrassed. “Little You Yun, are you still angry with grandfather?”

When Perfected Xuanchen saw that little You Yun could control spirit energy, he had deliberately asked little You Yun to repeatedly perform her actions. In the end, little You Yun had grown impatient and refused to respond to Perfected Xuanchen.

“Haha, little You Yun, don’t be angry. Grandfather has brought you a treat!” Perfected Xuanchen laughed happily and strode forward. He took out a stick of candy from somewhere.
