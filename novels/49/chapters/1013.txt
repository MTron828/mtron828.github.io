Chapter 1014 Prosperity (4)

Yet, no matter what, the two people would not question a Yang Lord’s words currently, though the ambitious statements satisfied Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui.

“Since that’s the case, this process will definitely be very tough. I hope that I can play a part to strive for this goal. I am willing to become a member of the Ye Family,” Bai Kui said with a smile.

With this Yang Lord of the Ye Family, it was not too difficult to make Ye Family the number one family clan of this mainland. However, to expand out from this mainland and advance into the Central Mainland, it was almost impossible.

Of course, no matter what, the first step must be taken.

Their batch of people would be the pioneers of this route.

Under Ye Qingtang’s signal, Ye Ling and the other elders slowly entered the hall in no time.

Ye Qingtang immediately introduced everyone to Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin.

The two elderlies cooperated. Before joining the Ye Family, they had already learned of its situation from the Third Elder.

The Ye Family was just an extremely ordinary small family clan in Lin Town; except, it produced a Yang Lord.

After knowing that Ye Ling was Ye Qingtang’s father, Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin hurriedly stood up and introduced themselves.

Normally, to the two of them, a cultivator like Ye Ling could not even be compared to an ant. However, Ye Ling’s daughter was a Yang Lord with combat power of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven peak; thus, the situation naturally was different.

“Seniors, it is really my honor and our Ye Family’s honor to have you all join us. The Ye Family will require your great support in the future…” Ye Ling’s expression was rather agitated at this instant. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Regardless of the Daoist Zijin or Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire, they seemed to exist in legends. Yet today, these two people appeared before him and even became a member of the Ye Family.

With the skills of Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin, there was no question at all, and they immediately became the distinguished elders of the Ye Family, whose authority in the Ye Family was only beneath the Clan Master.

Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin were extremely satisfied with this outcome.

“Oh right, Clan Master, Eldest Young Lady, does the Ye Family not have many disciples?” Daoist Zijin looked at Ye Ling and Ye Qingtang and asked.

Currently, Daoist Zijin and Bai Kui were already the distinguished elders of the Ye Family and were considered a family member and thus could speak freely.

Previously, Daoist Zijin realized that the Ye Family did not have many disciples and that the remaining disciples were not particularly gifted in martial skills and talent.

To Daoist Zijin and Bai Kui, since Ye Family had a scary Yang Lord like Ye Qingtang, its disciples should at least have a green spirit root and superior martial talent. Otherwise, they did not have the qualification to share the same surname as Ye Qingtang.

“Uh…”

The Second Elder appeared a little awkward.

Most of the previous Ye Family disciples were already expelled by Ye Qingtang, and while there were many talented youngsters who wanted to join the Ye Family recently, the Great Elder and the rest were unable to pick. As a result, the current Ye Family was still empty and had extremely few disciples. Compared to the current Si Family which was bursting with popularity, the Ye Family was worlds apart.
