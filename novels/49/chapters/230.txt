But when Zhou Xuan chased to the hall on the first floor, he was taken aback.

Ye Qingtang and Lin Long were still in the hall and had not left.

At the entrance stood the Apothecary with many citizens behind him, blocking all the exits.

Zhou Xuan watched the scene before him and faintly sensed that something was off.

“Apothecary… you all are…” Zhou Xuan said hesitantly.

However, that elderly in the hall had lost all previous humility at that time. He stood upright, and a frightening smile hung on his face while the citizens behind him were devoid of emotions. The initial respect and uneasiness were no longer present on the masses’ faces, and a violent cold expression similar to that of a wild beast glistened in their eyes.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. Looking at the group of people that was blocking her way, she tightened her grip on Lin Long’s wrist instinctively.

The Apothecary’s eyes were less humble as before and a few shades darker. He sized up Ye Qingtang and the rest with a bloodcurdling smile.

“Lords, it is so late already. Where are you all going? If there is anything to settle, how about you do it tomorrow?” The Apothecary said in a rather unyielding tone.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Apothecary coldly, and her lips tugged up into a smile. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Village Master Wu, you should tell us the reason for bringing so many people here late at night instead.”

With that said, the Apothecary, Lin Long, and even Zhou Xuan, who was behind Ye Qingtang, were instantly shocked to the core!

Village Master Wu?

Wu Chengze?

What was Ye Qingtang saying!

The smile on the Apothecary’s face vanished by that way of address. He narrowed his eyes and looked at the stunning young girl before him.

“Lord Ye, what are you saying? Why don’t I understand?”

Ye Qingtang laughed and tilted her head a little. “Village Master Wu, I have to hand it to you for your acting skills. However, you forgot that even if you changed your face, some things would never be changed.”

As she spoke, her eyes fell on the Apothecary’s hand that fell by his side. “As an Apothecary, the purlicue of your hand, however, has such a thick callus. To accumulate such a thick and old callus, one would need at least ten years of sword practice… Village Master Wu, you’re really too careless.”

Once Ye Qingtang finished her sentence, the Apothecary looked at his hands immediately, and there indeed was an old callus which did not fit his identity as an apothecary. His eyes narrowed, though there was no hint of panic on his face. He looked up and said helplessly, “Although I do not have good enough endowments, I like to practice swordplay to cultivate my character. Lord Ye, you may have misunderstood.”

“Misunderstood?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly and smiled. “Then… can you tell me why your grandson’s body in Spirit Condensation Mountain Village is so small? He was a small Village Master who led a comfortable life but was only skin and bones as though he was from a poor family. He was clearly babied, but why was it that his hands are as rough as that of a servant’s?”

The Apothecary’s face darkened immediately.

Ye Qingtang sneered in her heart, and her eyes sharpened!

“Village Master Wu, because of your personal greed, you disregarded the lives of the citizens outside Spirit Condensation Mountain Village and used the Duanyuan Grass to drug them unconscious to kill them. Then, you pretended to be a person from Spirit Condensation Mountain Village and moved into the village while you all replaced their identities and continued living on. This ‘switching the crown prince with a raccoon’ slinking move of yours is really… cruel and merciless!”
