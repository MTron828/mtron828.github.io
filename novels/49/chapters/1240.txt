Chapter 1241: Authentic Or Fake (3)

“Ah Yao…” The moment Ming Gu saw Ye Qingtang, he scuttled over and pressed his little face against her. He clutched Ye Qingtang’s leg and hugged it.

Meanwhile, Ming Wang looked at Ye Qingtang expressionlessly. Although his expression was civil, he was clearly secretly observing her.

Ye Qingtang secretly took a deep breath. A trace of a smile suddenly appeared in the corner of her mouth. She reached out and picked up Ming Gu.

“Be good and wait here for me.”

Ming Gu was shocked by such tenderness. His eyes opened wide in agitation.

When he saw that familiar smile, Ming Gu hugged Ye Qingtang around the neck.

“Ah Yao, I will certainly wait obediently in the temple for you.”

Ah Yao had finally smiled.

When Ming Wang, who was standing nearby, saw the smile on Ye Qingtang’s face, a surge of emotion involuntarily flashed across his eyes. But he quickly forced it down.

As Ye Qingtang teased Ming Gu, she secretly observed Ming Wang from the corner of her eye.

It looked like Ling Yan was accurate.

Ye Qingtang had been too constrained previously because of her uneasiness. This had aroused even more suspicions. Now, she only needed to properly act the role of Holy Lord and slowly dispel these suspicions in order to preserve her life.

Ling Yan had said that there were two Holy Lords in the Temple of Shadows—one was capricious, and the other was gloomy.

In the presence of the Holy Lord, Ming Gu acted like an immature child. The Holy Lord also treated him like a child, doting on him and guiding him. As a result, Ming Gu had become very attached to the Holy Lord.

“Alright, I have to go.” Ye Qingtang saw that she was having an effect and put Ming Gu down. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Ming Gu seemed to be in a trance of delight over the hug. He held his little fists in front of his chest and gazed blissfully at Ye Qingtang.

This time, Ye Qingtang did not bring the little white tiger along. After the preparations were complete, she led the dozen Undead to the Luo House.

The Luo Family had a great influence in the area.

All the powerful figures in the neighboring area had come to present their good wishes at the Grand Elder’s birthday banquet.

It was evening, and rays from the setting sun were scattered over the ground. The enormous Luo House stood proudly in the dying light of the evening.

An endless stream of guests arrived at the Luo House. Dozens of Luo Family guards stood at attention outside the main door. It was a magnificent sight.

The Luo House was gaily decorated and brightly lit with numerous lamps.

A white-robed youth slowly walked among the guests. A pair of pure white wings grew from his back. In the light of the lamps, they looked exceptionally pristine and beautiful.

“Uncle, who exactly is Luo Qufeng? I saw many alien clans here too.” The youth with the white wings widened his blue eyes and looked at a tall, handsome man.

This man also had a pair of white wings growing from his back. They were similar to the youth’s wings except that his feathers were slightly gray and seemed to be stronger.

They were from the Clan of Winged People. Their Palace of Wings had received an invitation to Luo Qufeng’s birthday banquet, and they had made a special trip to offer their good wishes.

“Luo Qufeng is the Grand Elder of the Luo Family. He participated in the battle between the Central Mainland and the Second Domain. He is extremely powerful but has seldom appeared in recent years. However, he still maintains his former status,” the winged man said with a smile.

“The battle with the Second Domain? Uncle, didn’t you participate in it too?” The winged youth asked curiously.
