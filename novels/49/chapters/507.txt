Chapter 508 Hunt Down (2)

“Have mercy… We were cheated by Yunxiao Sect!”

At that moment, only the female leader remained. When she saw Ye Qingtang walking towards her slowly, she fell on her knees and kneeled before Ye Qingtang as regret consumed her. “Greed and the desire to plunder are your sins.” Ye Qingtang towered above the girl and looked down at her coldly.

“I beg you. Please let me off…” The girl had a pale complexion as she pleaded desperately.

“Before you want to kill someone, you should already have been prepared to be killed by others.”

As Ye Qingtang’s lips parted, the Demonic Blood Sword never stopped and chopped off the girl’s head instantly.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang experienced many pleads like this, and her heart softened too many times.

However, most of those people whom she mercifully let off returned even stronger. Not only did they reveal her whereabouts, they even combined forces with others and brought more disasters for her.

Facts had proven that being merciful to enemies was being merciless to herself.

This time, Ye Qingtang would never be soft-hearted anymore. Since others wanted to kill her, she would not be lenient! “Little girl, you’re ruthless, and it somewhat models my Blood Moon Sect’s manner.” The Blood Moon Elder nodded, feeling gratified, and felt Ye Qingtang was a little more pleasing to his eye. The Blood Moon Sect was completely sick of the hypocrisy and clemency of the so-called orthodox. “Not bad, not bad.”

Pow!

Ye Qingtang walked forward and slapped the Blood Moon Elder’s head.

“Why did you hit me again!” The Blood Moon Elder was suddenly mad. Was this damn girl addicted to beating him up! “So full of bIlsht! Hurry up and leave!” Ye Qingtang shot the Blood Moon Elder a look. They were in this situation already, yet he was still so emotional?

How exactly did he become a Blood Moon Sect Elder in his previous life? Could it be that he got in through the back door? After the whole saga with the family clan disciples of Du City, the distance between Yunxiao Sect disciples and them was shortened. Ye Qingtang’s expression was grim.

“How far is this place from the Blood Moon Sect Division?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“After leaving this forest, there is a wilderness, and our Division is situated there,” replied the Blood Moon Elder.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything more and continued to hit the road.

Around half a day later, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder finally left the forest.

At that time, over ten people flashed across them uniformly. The fifteen Yunxiao Sect disciples finally caught up to Ye Qingtang.

The Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed when he saw those fifteen people. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

If he were at his peak, he could easily wave a hand and kill the Yunxiao Sect Elder while talking, much less these Yunxiao Sect disciples.

However, returning to reality, he might not be able to defeat even a Martial Qi Level Two Yunxiao Sect outer sect disciple. “Are you Xuanling Sect’s Ye Qingtang!” The leader of the group was donned in a snow-white long robe which had embroidery of a golden cloud on his chest, the special symbol of Yunxiao Sect’s inner sect elite disciple.

“Xuanling Sect? Ye Qingtang?” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang who had put on a disguise on their journey and pondered for a moment. “I’m afraid you all are mistaken. She is my granddaughter. I brought my granddaughter here to train, and I don’t know anything about Ye Qingtang or Xuanling Sect that you’re talking about.”

“She is your granddaughter?”

After hearing the Blood Moon Elder’s words, the Yunxiao Sect disciples had strange expressions.

“Rubbish!” The elite disciple shouted furiously. “How old are you? You’re about the same age as her. How did she become your granddaughter?!”
