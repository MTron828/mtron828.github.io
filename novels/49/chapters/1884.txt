“Stop joking around. Those people outside are here for you, and we don’t want any part of it. If you want someone to impersonate your aunt, use her. She’s one of you anyway.” Jiang Shaobai’s face darkened at Long Xiao’s plan and he raised his hand to point at Long Yao.

“Yao’er won’t do. Not only is her figure different from my aunt, but the people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley have also seen her before and know what her aura feels like. They have never seen this young lady before, and her figure looks a lot like my aunt’s. If you are willing to help...” Long Yao said.

“She’s not. Don’t even think about it.” Jiang Shaobai refused to listen to Long Xiao’s plan at all and dragged Ye Qingtang away.

But Long Xiao continued, “The people outside may be here for me, but you really don’t understand them. Even though you’re not part of this, they will never let you go now that you’ve seen them chasing after us.”

“What?” On the side, Mu Feiruo’s face was filled with shock.

“The Ten Thousand Poison Valley have been at odds with my family clan for a long time, even if they’ve never shown it. If they manage to assassinate us today and the news of this gets out, our family clan will declare a battle to the death with them, which is why they will never let this information leak.” Long Xiao sighed.

It was then that Ye Qingtang finally understood. From the moment Long Xiao had stepped into the Crystal Palace, they had already been drawn into this matter.

They could either pray that the Ten Thousand Poison Valley wasn’t going to make it into the Crystal Palace, or pray that their Supreme God wouldn’t kill them off.

Whatever happened to Long Xiao’s group would also affect them...

Jiang Shaobai’s face was already as dark as it could be. He narrowed his eyes at Long Xiao and said, “You tricked us.”

Long Yi smiled wryly and shook his head. “How could we have done that? We had no idea that there would be other people in the Crystal Palace. But at this point, there is nothing we can do about the situation, so would you please lend us your strength, for now, to get through this? You would have my eternal gratitude.”

“You make it sound so easy, but Elder Sister Qing has never even seen your aunt. How is she going to impersonate her? Furthermore, the people outside aren’t stupid. Would they really retreat just because of your aunt?” Jiang Shaobai asked coldly.

Long Xiao replied, “It’s fine if she doesn’t know what to do. I will instruct her. And I don’t expect them to retreat, I just want to buy some time. Come morning, something will be there to deal with the Ten Thousand Poison Valley.”

In fact, Long Xiao already had a plan in mind, just no one who could play the part. The people he had brought with him were all poisoned and the Ten Thousand Poison Valley were very familiar with Long Yi and Long Yao, so none of them could impersonate their aunt. Furthermore, the Ten Thousand Poison Valley was already aware of their numbers and the missing person playing their aunt would reveal their plan.

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised after hearing Long Xiao’s plan. She knew more or less what Long Xiao was thinking.

Once morning fell, the fat catfishes in the gambling town would all become demonized. The tens of thousands of fat catfishes in their bestial states would definitely be too much for the Ten Thousand Poison Valley to handle.

Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept over Long Xiao. The fact that he was able to use the mystic realm against his enemies showed how intelligent he truly was.
