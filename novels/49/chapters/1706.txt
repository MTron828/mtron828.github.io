Chapter 1707: Tasting the Consequences (2)

Even though there were many clans that were backed by the Mu family and the Baili family, there were other clans who were not indebted to them. It was an anonymous vote anyway, so they voted for whoever they thought was more beautiful.

“Cheating! Ye Qingtang is cheating! The votes vanished yesterday only to reappear in the hands of the Jiang family. You must have stolen the votes and destroyed those that did not bear Ye Qingtang’s name.” Mu Ruxue’s entire body was stiff as she complained unfairly.

“Qingtang was already the winner, so why would we steal the votes unless we were stupid? Wouldn’t that just make more trouble for us? And look for yourself, Mu Ruxue. Don’t the number of votes here tally with the number of people attending the event?” Jiang Yisheng cut through Mu Ruxue’s slander mercilessly.

Even without Jiang Yisheng’s word, the people there could already sense Mu Ruxue’s foolishness. Ye Qingtang’s victory had already more or less been secured, so why would she steal the votes?

“Mu Ruxue, stop grasping at straws. The top beauty for this Martial Arts Championship is none other than Qingtang. Anyone with eyes can see who is more beautiful between the two of you. I have no idea who gave you the courage to compete with the looks of our Qingtang.” Jiang Yisheng spoke harshly and truthfully. He had no pity for shameless and arrogant women like Mu Ruxue.

Jiang Yisheng’s words stripped away the last of Mu Ruxue’s facade, revealing her pale, blue face. The people around her were staring at her with disdain as well. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Even though Mu Ruxue had dressed her best for today, now that she stood next to Ye Qingtang, she just looked unnecessarily garish.

Ye Qingtang didn’t need anything else. Her beauty was proof enough of everything.

Mu Ruxue gritted her teeth as she glared at Ye Qingtang. The gazes of the people around her pricked her like a thousand needles. She knew that her plan had been ruined and there was no way to collect herself from this mess. She lowered her face and was about to leave.

However...

“Wait.” Jiang Shaobai raised his hands slowly and grabbed the wrist of the flustered Mu Ruxue, who was looking to escape after the situation had turned on her.

“What do you want?” Mu Ruxue asked darkly as she shook his hand off.

“Since we have the results, you should fulfill your side of the bet as well.” Jiang Shaobai smiled, revealing his white teeth.

“What bet are you talking about? What nonsense are you spouting? I’m not going to be civil anymore if you keep blocking my way.” Mu Ruxue retorted with a face full of panic. She was subconsciously standing beside Mu Feiruo, to use her aura to refuse to reciprocate the bet.

Jiang Shaobai narrowed his eyes as he looked at Mu Feiruo, who was standing beside Mu Ruxue. He shrugged his shoulders.

“I knew you wouldn’t keep up your end of the bet. Forget it. I don’t have anything to say to someone who doesn’t keep their word.” With that, Jiang Shaobai pulled Ye Qingtang out of the restaurant.

The entire time, Ye Qingtang hadn’t said a single word. She had no interest in the beauty rankings or Mu Ruxue, and let herself be dragged off by Jiang Shaobai.

Jiang Yisheng followed behind them.

Once they were out of the restaurant, Jiang Yisheng couldn’t hold it back anymore and whispered, “Mu Ruxue really is shameless. I can’t believe she is the sister of my goddess. It’s really a pity we couldn’t get her to hold up the end of her bet this time.”

“Who said she’s not going to?” Jiang Shaobai smiled slightly.

Jiang Yisheng was taken aback.

“Just wait a little. There’s going to be a good show tonight,” Jiang Shaobai said mysteriously.

Ye Qingtang looked at the wicked smile on Jiang Shaobai’s face. She had a feeling that Mu Ruxue was about to meet with great misfortune.
