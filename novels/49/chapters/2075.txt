Chapter 2076: Powerful Enemies (1)

Before she could figure out whether there was anything wrong with the Divine Phoenix seal, someone knocked on her door.

“Holy Lord, Mi has something to discuss with you. He’s waiting in the main hall.” Xue Fu’s voice drifted in from the outside.

Mi was looking for her?

Her heart jolted. It was probably something important if it made Mi so worried.

Putting on her clothes, she picked up the plump, little white tiger and carried it outside with her. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

In the main hall, the Crimson League alien race people who were with Mi were already standing inside.

They all glanced at her as she entered. The eight tribe leaders and Ming Wang were inside as well.

“Mo Yao, I have something to discuss with you.” Mi’s surreal voice was heavy.

From his tone, she could tell that something bad had happened when she was sleeping.

“What happened?” she asked.

Mi didn’t speak up immediately and handed over a letter with the Crimson League’s seal on it to her.

She opened it and read the contents.

A strange look flashed past her eyes.

“The Heavenly Wolf Sect?” Ye Qingtang looked at the contents of the letter and read out the familiar yet foreign words.

“The Heavenly Wolf Sect is one of the powers of the Second Domain. Even though they’re not on the same mainland as us, they’re nothing to scoff at. This letter was delivered to me today...” Mi slowly said.

The Heavenly Wolf Sect and the Crimson League were on par with each other. In the past, they did not interact with each other but got into a fight due to some conflict thousands of years ago. They fought many small and big battles but in the end, it was still hard to determine the winner.

The Crimson League had already sent people to infiltrate the Heavenly Wolf Sect and gather information. Even though the spies had been unable to enter the inner circle, they had still been able to find out some information.

A few days prior, the Heavenly Wolf Sect had sent a small troop to the First Domain.

“Are you worried that the Heavenly Wolf Sect might go to the Central Mainland?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Mi nodded. “It’s not impossible. We had to be so secretive about coming to the First Domain this time because letting the other powers know about the Spirit of Chaos would only make them flock here...”

The Crimson League had to obtain the Spirit of Chaos but the Heavenly Wolf Sect had nothing to do with the First Domain. It was extremely suspicious that they had suddenly sent people to the First Domain at such a sensitive time.

“Your worries might be true,” she said.

Mi froze. It had only been a nagging suspicion in his mind without any evidence, but Ye Qingtang’s words seemed to suggest that she knew something more.

“What do you mean?”

She said, “When we were attacking the Ancient You Clan’s underground world, I was informed that the City Lord wasn’t present. From what I know, he has not returned and seems to have vanished from the Central Mainland.”

She had many theories with regards to his disappearance but now it seemed that it had coincided nicely with the actions of the Heavenly Wolf Sect...
