Chapter 607: The Extermination Of Life Formation (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Hehe… the Hell of Avicinaraka is indeed a conspiracy… However, the fiendcelestial beast is not a lie. There was a fiendcelestial beast that ran into the Hell of Avicinaraka a few hundred years ago. Actually, it has nothing to do with the fiendcelestial beast… Ultimately, your sin stems from desire and greed.”

The black-robed man turned into a ball of black fog and disappeared.

As the black-robed man disappeared, the palace was in total chaos.

“Run! The Extermination Of Life Formation is turned on!”

“We shall open the door together!”

The huge door of the hall was closed, and all exits were sealed off as the black-robed man left.

Everyone took out their Dharma treasures and weapons and initiated strong attacks towards the huge door that determined their survival.

However, though everyone combined their forces, the huge door remained intact.

Ye Qingtang frowned. She looked at the Blood Moon Elder beside her and said, “Do you have any method to break the Extermination Of Life Formation?” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Blood Moon Elder contemplated for a while and said, “It shouldn’t be a problem if I’m given enough time. However, under the current situation, before I can break the Extermination Of Life Formation, we will die here.”

Ye Qingtang did not say anything and took out the remaining talismans from her space ring.

There were three talismans remained. Two of them were from the little disciple of the Yunxiao Sect Master that she killed. The last one was from the drained well in the blood-colored city.

“Hehe… Ye Qingtang, I did not expect you to have the Space-transfer Talisman.”

Suddenly, the black-robed man’s deep voice came out of nowhere.

The rest in the hall were busy attacking the huge door, and no one noticed the black-robed man’s voice.

However, Ye Qingtang was slightly shocked after hearing his words.

Her disguise was considered rather successful; even her parents might not recognize her. However, the black-robed man could see through her disguise?!

“May I know what you are?”

Ye Qingtang scanned through her surroundings, but there was no trace of the black-robed man. There was no reply as well. It seemed that the black-robed man had left.

“Holy Lady, did the black-robed man mention the Space-transfer talisman?” The Blood Moon Elder stared at the talisman in Ye Qingtang’s hands and asked.

“Yes…” Ye Qingtang nodded. “That was what the black-robed man referred to just now.”

The two talismans that Ye Qingtang got from the Yunxiao Sect disciple were not Space-transfer Talismans. The only one left would be the mysterious talisman that she obtained from the city…

The talisman was black in color and was engraved with mysterious words. It seemed that there was really turbulence of space energy within.

“Holy Lady, I did sense that there was some space energy turbulence in the black talisman… However, the black-robed man was odd. Why would he tell you that this is the Space-transfer Talisman? I am scared that it’s a conspiracy!” the Blood Moon Elder said seriously.

The black-robed man’s intention was to let everyone here die in the hall.

It seemed that the black-robed man accidentally told Ye Qingtang that she had a Space-transfer Talisman, but it was apparent that he said it on purpose.

“We can only give it a try now. Otherwise, we will die in the Extermination Of Life Formation and turn into a pool of blood.” Ye Qingtang frowned heavily. They could only try the talisman as there was no other option.
