In the hall, there was no change in emotion on Perfected Xuanchen’s face as he looked at the young man who entered with Xiong Feng.

“Valley master, this is the Young Sir Ye who asked to meet you,” Xiong Feng said respectfully.

Ye Qingtang looked at Perfected Xuanchen’s familiar face, bringing back memories from her past life. When she fled away from Xuanling Sect, she was in dire straits for a long time. In a heavy downpour, Perfected Xuanchen stood under the pouring rain and stretched his hand out towards her.

Ye Qingtang stored all the memories in her heart and held back all her emotions. Taking a step forward, she bowed to him sincerely. “Ye Chen greets Perfected Xuanchen.”

Perfected Xuanchen glanced at the young man before him. This young man appeared extremely modest and respectful, and it was just that he had a rather slim frame.

Yan Shu frowned at Ye Qingtang and subsequently looked at Perfected Xuanchen, who nodded slightly at him.

“Ye Chen, what are you meeting my Master for?”

When Ye Qingtang saw the cold-looking Yan Shu, there was no annoyance but rather a trace of a smile in her heart.

Senior Brother Yan was indeed the same as back then.

In her previous life, when Ye Qingtang just entered Falling Sky Valley, Perfected Xuanchen ordered Yan Shu to help Ye Qingtang familiarize with everything in the valley. When they first met, Yan Shu was cold, but people who knew him were aware that he had an extremely good character. Not only was he deeply respectful towards Perfected Xuanchen, but he was also very protective of the fellow disciples under his Master.

When Ye Qingtang entered the valley, Yan Shu often took care of her.

He was the epitome of a “cold face but warm heart”.

Ye Qingtang said, “I’ve looked up to you for a long time and wish to be apprenticed to you as I cultivate.”

Perfected Xuanchen and Yan Shu were both taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words.

She was actually here to become apprenticed?!

Yan Shu clearly did not think that the young man would actually have such a request and was dumbfounded for quite a while before responding. “You wish to become a disciple of my Master?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Yan Shu’s frown deepened immediately.

“My Master has not been accepting any disciples in recent years.”

Yan Shu did not have a favorable impression of this young man before him. The reason that this person could see his Master was probably because he bribed Xiong Feng. Although Yan Shu knew that bribery was common among powerful forces, he was extremely repelled from it due to his nature.

Where exactly did this fellow jump out from? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Did he really think that he could become a disciple of his Master after bribing a Falling Sky Valley warden with some random things?

God knows how many people in Nine Nights Dynasty wanted to be apprenticed to his master, but all of them were rejected no matter how outstanding they were. Where did this person get his courage from?

Ye Qingtang did not reply to Yan Shu as her eyes were locked right on Perfected Xuanchen, who had not spoken a word.

Perfected Xuanchen remained silent for a moment and said, “I’m not accepting any disciples anymore. Please return, Young Sir Ye.” Although he said it briefly, one could faintly hear a trace of impatience in his tone.

Upon hearing Perfected Xuanchen’s words, Xiong Feng had an expression which read “indeed so”. Although he accepted quite a number of benefits from Ye Qingtang, he did not help to say anything at this moment. Anyway, he had already told Ye Qingtang about it, and it was she who persisted in becoming apprenticed to Perfected Xuanchen.

Ye Qingtang did not back down and spoke. “There’s no need to reject me so quickly. I prepared an apprenticeship gift for this meeting today.”
