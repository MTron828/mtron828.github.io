Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Immediately, Ji Yixuan fell on his knees and bowed in the southern direction where Falling Sky Valley was. He blamed himself fully, and even death was not enough to pay for his offense.

Pride filled Yue Tiancheng’s eyes as he watched Ji Yixuan. After a while, he told Ye Qingtang. “Junior sister, I will be here to watch Ji Yixuan die. You can return to the sect to submit your mission first.”

“Alright. Be careful, Senior Brother Yue. Don’t let this scumbag of Falling Sky Valley escape.” Ye Qingtang agreed without hesitation and walked out the valley.

However, Ye Qingtang suddenly stopped in her tracks halfway and looked at Yue Tiancheng with a frown. “Senior Brother Yue, I forgot about something. Earlier on in the valley, I saw Yi Tianchou who is ranked nine on the Assassination Roll.”

“Yi Tianchou?” Yue Tiancheng was surprised.

Yi Tianchou was rather skilled. He was already at the peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three five years ago and was ranked nine on the Assassination Roll.

“What was he doing here?” Yue Tiancheng was a little confused.

“I don’t know about that.” Ye Qingtang shook her head as she continued with a slight frown. “Yi Tianchou’s nasty reputation is widely known, and he is too skilled, so I did not dare to get close to him. However, I seem to have heard him mumbling something about the Spirit Life Flower…”

“Spirit Life Flower?!” Yue Tiancheng’s expression changed immediately.

Senior Sister Ye You discovered the Spirit Life Flower in this valley a long time ago, but it was not ripe yet at that time. Thus, Ye You sent a junior brother to guard it. Once it matured, it was to be plucked and brought back to the sect for her.

However, it had been days since the agreed timing for his return to the sect, and there was still no news of that junior brother.

Before he came to the valley this time, Ye You had specially ordered him to head into the valley and investigate what happened after settling the issue with the Falling Sky Valley disciple.

“Spirit Life Flower… Yi Tianchou… Could it be?” A glint flashed in Yue Tiancheng’s eyes.

“Junior sister, are you sure that he was Yi Tianchou, and he mentioned the Spirit Life Flower?” Yue Tiancheng asked hurriedly.

Ye Qingtang nodded extremely certainly. “I’ve seen Yi Tianchou’s portrait. I definitely will not identify him wrongly, and I did hear him talking about the Spirit Life Flower.” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“This is bad!” Yue Tiancheng knew that there was trouble. The junior brother had not brought the Spirit Life Flower back to the sect after a long time, and it must have been closely related to Yi Tianchou!

Yue Tiancheng was frantic at that moment, but the force of destruction had not completely exploded to kill Ji Yixuan, and he could not move away.

“Senior Brother Yue, what happened?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Yue Tiancheng glimpsed at Ye Qingtang and said immediately, “Junior Sister, this is an urgent matter. I’ll tell you the exact location of the Spirit Life Flower, and you are to go there to check. If you encounter Yi Tianchou, kill him!”

“Huh?” Ye Qingtang was surprised and shook her head hurriedly after hearing Yue Tiancheng. “Senior Brother Yue, I’m afraid… I can’t. You should be aware of Yi Tianchou’s reputation.”

“What is so scary about that!” Yue Tiancheng frowned, displeased.

“Senior Brother Yue, Yi Tianchou’s nickname is the great flower thief… No one knows how many ladies he has insulted… Not mentioning how I can’t defeat him with my skills, even if I’m more powerful than him, I’m a girl, and I don’t have the courage to…” Ye Qingtang had an aggrieved expression.

“Humph! How can you have so many excuses as a Yunxiao Sect disciple?” Yue Tiancheng was a little impatient. While he spoke disdainfully, deep down, he also felt that Ye Qingtang was not Yi Tianchou’s opponent. If they acted rashly, alarmed the enemy, and let Yi Tianchou escape instead, things would even be more troublesome.
