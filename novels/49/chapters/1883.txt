Chapter 1884: A Lunatic’s Plan (1)

Most of them had sustained serious injuries. If Liu Jiangran was to continue fighting them, they would lose without a doubt.

Revenge was a certainty, however, they mustn’t act rashly.

“Even if we don’t go out, the Crystal Palace wouldn’t be able to sustain us for much longer. They won’t let us go that easily,” Long Yao said.

“Let me think.” Long Xiao’s brows furrowed.

Long Xiao had a plan in mind, but it wasn’t easy to carry out at that moment.

“Sister Qing, I’m sleepy. Let’s go back downstairs.” Amid the chaotic scene in front of them, Jiang Shaobai tugged on Ye Qingtang’s sleeve while looking at them.

Jiang Shaobai had just awoken and Ye Qingtang looked at him speechlessly.

Couldn’t he find a better excuse?

If this were to happen earlier, Ye Qingtang probably wouldn’t bother with Long Xiao and the others. However... Now that she had learned that they were from the same clan as her mother...

They had sustained heavy injuries and if they were to continue fighting, they would most likely die.

Long Xiao heard Jiang Shaobai’s voice, lifting his head to look over. It was only then that he realized there were other people in the Crystal Palace.

“They are?”

“They should be from the First Domain,” Long Yao surmised.

Long Xiao scanned their faces with an inconspicuous gaze. When his eyes landed on Ye Qingtang, he had a visible reaction when he saw her disguised appearance.

How could a young lady with such a great figure have such an ugly face?

“Please hold on.” Long Xiao didn’t care too much about Ye Qingtang’s face. He took a step forward, calling them as they prepared to leave.

“Apologies, we don’t intend to interfere in your matters. Also, you’re... from the Second Domain, right? We’re from the First Domain. You’re already formidable and yet you can’t handle the people outside, so we definitely can’t do anything for you. If you want us to help, I can only say sorry.” Jiang Shaobai said all of that without waiting for Ye Qingtang to say anything.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

“Sister Qing, let’s go back now.” Jiang Shaobai wanted to drag Ye Qingtang away.

Long Xiao hadn’t anticipated Jiang Shaobai to have such a sharp tongue despite his appearance. He was stunned and instantly replied, “Little Brother, you must have misunderstood me.”

“We’re not that close. It’s our first time meeting each other, why are you calling me ‘Little Brother’?” Jiang Shaobai wasn’t reserved at all.

How much poison did this fellow take to be this mean?

The blunt response made Long Xiao feel incredibly awkward. But with their current situation, Long Xiao could only put it aside and said, “I’m Long Xiao. I know that this is sudden, but we’re facing a crisis now and I would like this lady to pass off as my Aunt to tide us over.”

Once Long Xiao said that not only was Ye Qingtang stunned, even Long Yao’s eyes widened in shock.

What was going on?

Was her brother crazy?

Long Yao scanned Ye Qingtang from head to toe with widened eyes. Though she had a great figure, her face... Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Which part of it even resembled her beautiful aunt?

“Brother! Are you crazy?”

As for Ye Qingtang, she also felt that Long Xiao had probably hurt his head during the battle.

What kind of ludicrous plan was going through his mind?
