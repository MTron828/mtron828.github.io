Chapter 1962: So Filthy (1)

“You know the reason?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Of course.” Ye You smiled and continued, “The Ancient You Clan isn’t this powerful for no reason...”

To prove her worth, Ye You told her how the Ancient You Clan had used the other ancient clans to test the power of those young men.

The truth was basically what Ye Qingtang had surmised.

Ye You felt joy in her heart as she studied Ye Qingtang’s reaction.

“If the Holy Lord gives me a chance, I promise to be of use to you.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Ye You and spoke lightly. “Alright, I’ll give you a chance.”

Ye You heart leaped with joy.

Ye Qingtang continued, “But you have to show your sincerity first to prove your loyalty.”

Originally Ye You wanted to reveal more information about the Ancient You Clan to prove her sincerity, but before she could speak, Ye Qingtang raised a hand to interrupt.

“What I want is very simple,” Ye Qingtang’s eyes looked indifferently at Ye You from behind the mask.

“I want you to dig your spirit root out.”

“What?” Ye You was startled.

Dig out her spirit root? What did that mean?

“What, you are unwilling?” Ye Qingtang spoke coldly.

The words of the Holy Lord left Ye You in utter shock. She lowered her eyes as internal turmoil overtook her. When she was in the First Mainland, she had thought that the spirit root was everything, that it symbolized one’s power.

It was only after she had come to the Central Mainland that she realized that the spirit root wasn’t the most important thing about power. She had seen so many people with ordinary spirit roots possess insane amounts of strength. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

In this mainland with a greater martial culture, the spirit root was not that important.

But...

Even now she still had her doubts. After all, she had spent a lot of effort getting this spirit root, and now...

She couldn’t help but sigh internally as she looked at the “Holy Lord of Shadows” in front of her.

With the Holy Lord of Shadow’s power, she could easily crush her. She understood clearly that in front of such a powerful individual, her power meant nothing.

After taking a deep breath, Ye You finally decided that gaining the Holy Lord of Shadows’s trust was more important. She knew how strong she was and had heard of how frightening her powers were.

As long as she had the Holy Lord of Shadows’s trust, she had faith that she could one day gain more strength and power from the Holy Lord. This was what she was actually aiming for.

“Alright, as long as it makes the Holy Lord happy.” Ye You gritted her teeth, lifted her hand, and pierced it straight through her stomach. The pain of stabbing her stomach made her break out in a cold sweat and Ye You knelt onto the floor with a thud.

She had once used the very same hands to rip open Ye Qingtang’s stomach and dig out the spirit root she had been dreaming about.

And now she was ripping open her own stomach to take out the spirit root that didn’t belong to her in the first place!

Fresh blood flowed from Ye You’s wound, splashing onto the floor. The murky prison filled with the sickly stench of blood.

Ye You slowly dug out a small spirit root. She held the spirit root in her blood-stained hands and presented it to Ye Qingtang.

The spirit root was soaked in Ye You’s blood and was glowing brightly.

“So filthy.”

Ye Qingtang looked coldly at the spirit root presented to her. Before Ye You could react, she reached out and crushed it.
