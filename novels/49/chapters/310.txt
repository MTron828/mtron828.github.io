“Ridiculous!” Elder Huang’s face darkened. “Do you know how dangerous the inner sect assessment is? The opponents that you’ll be facing are the elite disciples on the ranking chart. As a new disciple who just entered the sect, where did your guts to spar with them come from?”

Elder Huang had a strict expression, and there was no warmth in his tone.

When he heard of this shocking move that Ye Qingtang took a few days ago, he was astonished.

Although he did not pay much attention to Ye Qingtang, she was, after all, still an outer sect disciple. Given her abilities, would there not be a spectacle if she went into the ring? Where was he going to place his face as the outer sect elder at then?!

“I know.” Ye Qingtang replied calmly.

Elder Huang’s expression was still foul. “You know? If you knew, why would you still do such a thing? In the top ten disciples of the outer sect, the poorest-skilled one is already at the early-stage of Connate Level 9. If you battle them, do you know how severely injured you will be? There is even a possibility of dying on the ring. You’re simply taking your life as a joke!”

So be it if it were other disciples; while they might be embarrassed should they enter the arena, they would not be seriously injured. But Ye Qingtang, as a new disciple, probably had not mastered the foundations and was only a red spirit root. How would she be able to withstand those top ten elites’ attacks?

If she entered the ring, the best outcome was to be severely injured while the worst… The more Elder Huang thought about it, the more he found it too dangerous. Thus, he summoned Ye Qingtang to persuade her.

Ye Qingtang watched Elder Huang persuade her, but her heart did not waver at all as she stood there without any expression.

Elder Huang was helpless when saw how stubborn she was. Thinking of how she spent such a large sum of Xuanming points to exchange for this qualification to participate in the assessment, she must be determined.

“I’ll not say anything else. If things really reach that stage, you should admit defeat before it’s too late. Don’t fight head-on. If you injure yourself, any opportunity in the future will have to be given up,” Elder Huang said helplessly.

A smile passed Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

While Elder Huang was stern and his words were mostly concerned about his face, she could feel from that last sentence that Elder Huang was really afraid she would die on the ring.

“I understand. Thank you for your reminder, Elder Huang,” Ye Qingtang said.

Elder Huang sighed and allowed her to retreat. However, as he watched Ye Qingtang leave, there was a worried look on his face.

If Ye Qingtang’s natural endowment was as brilliant as Yuan Wei’s, he would not have persuaded her.

Elder Huang was slightly comforted only when he thought of Yuan Wei.

Yuan Wei’s skills were above average, and he was personally accepted as a disciple by him. If he could enter the top ten on the ranking charts in this assessment, he would really gain a lot of face!

…

Half a month flew by, and the outer sect finally welcomed the most serious assessment. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

All the outer sect disciples gathered at the square on that day. Watching the Eight Trigrams Ring in the middle of the square, everyone’s hearts fluttered.

“I wonder how murderous this year’s inner sect assessment will be.”

“What else can it be? Do you think everyone has the opportunity to enter the inner sect? Just look at the conditions of those people on the ranking chart. Ji Xianyuan has already reached the peak of Connate Level 9 this year and is only one stage away from Martial Qi.”
