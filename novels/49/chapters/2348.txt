Chapter 2349: Next (3)

This kind of Master-level elixir was very rare. In the first place, there were few Master-level alchemists in the entire Second Domain. On top of that, they were all under the various factions and their elixirs never entered the public market.

Since Zhu Ning had chosen a Master-level elixir, it was clear he was serious.

“I say… Isn’t Teacher Zhu a bit too merciless? He wants to compete on a Master-level elixir?” Gong Jinyun frowned slightly. He felt that this was not fair to Ye Qing.

Meanwhile, the medicine faculty students retorted. “This competition is about refining elixirs, right? What? You want our Teacher Zhu to go easy? Compete on an elementary-level elixir? What a joke.”

“Don’t make bold claims if you don’t have the ability to back it up. Don’t think that just because your cultivation level is high that you can refine elixirs. Those are two entirely separate matters.”

Just as the crowd continued their discussion, Ye Qingtang agreed to the terms. All the ingredients were delivered by the other medicine faculty teachers, and each person received a set.

There was only one chance to refine. The first sign of failure would mean defeat.

Those in the medicine faculty could not hide their anticipation. It was not often they got to see Zhu Ning refine elixirs. They couldn’t even be bothered to look at Ye Qing. Instead, they all focused on Zhu Ning.

Zhu Ning’s knowledge of herbs far surpassed that of Song Yanhan. His preparation of the ingredients was so precise that all the students sighed in admiration at the sight.

It was a pleasure to watch.

Lei Yan didn’t know anything about elixir-refinement so he had to ask Yun Chen.

“Tell me, who is more highly skilled? Our Boss or Zhu Ning?”

Yun Chen replied without any hesitation. “Our Boss, of course.”

“That’s right!” Lei Yan chuckled.

He loved hearing others praise his Boss.

Their conversation attracted the attention of several other medicine faculty students. They stared at those two like they were looking at two fools.

Ye Qing was better than Zhu Ning?

Dream on!

At this moment, even the other medicine faculty teachers were all carefully observing Zhu Ning’s elixir-refinement process. They could not detect any flaw in his movements. Everything was perfect Even the teachers were benefiting a lot from watching.

“Every time I watch Teacher Zhu refine elixirs, I get a sense of desolation. I wonder when I will ever reach his standard,” one of the teachers lamented.

“I am afraid that both you and I will never reach his standard in this lifetime.”

“Look!” Just as the teachers were admiring Zhu Ning, they suddenly saw a flame light up in Ye Qing’s hand.

It was the same as Yun Chen’s earlier display. But Ye Qing’s flame was black.

What?! The teachers were all shocked. They never expected Ye Qing to know the palm flame technique as well!

Could it be that he was really the one who taught Yun Chen the technique?

Ye Qing was focused on the herbs in her hands and looked like he was completely immersed in her own world.

Zhu Ning, who had just placed his ingredients into his tripod, also noticed what Ye Qing was doing. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was stunned by the sight.

As that black flame refined those herbs, a medicinal aroma wafted over in waves.

Shock flashed across Zhu Ning’s eyes. He knew that he should be focusing on his own elixir-refinement, but after watching Ye Qing’s process, he appeared unable to carry on.
