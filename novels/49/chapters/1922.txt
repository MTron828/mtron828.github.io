Chapter 1923: Unleash The Demon Dragon (2)

Yes, yes, yes. Whatever you say.

Ye Qingtang was grumbling on the inside, but she maintained her genial expression on the outside.

Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang was rather surprised that Ming Di was able to let go of his 10,000-year grudge so quickly. It looked like the relationship between Ming Di and the Holy Lord of Shadows went deeper than she thought. If it was anyone else who had locked Ming Di up, the dragon would have instantly swallowed the person up, no matter how much he tried to beg for mercy. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Of course, this was what Ye Qingtang thought inwardly.

But how could she have known the long history between Ming Di and the Holy Lord of Shadows? The many bloody battles they had fought alongside each other and the many years they had shared together.

So much that as angry as Ming Di was about the Holy Lord imprisoning it, it never really hated him. It only begrudged the Holy Lord for not understanding its intentions.

At the end of the day, Ming Di still possessed a pure and simple mind. Ten thousand years might be a long time for most people, but it was not that unbearable to a demon dragon with a lengthy lifespan.

Now that the “Holy Lord of Shadows” had finally seen the light and given in, it was natural for Ming Di to feel pleased that its partner had finally returned to its side.

“Just wait until I get out. I will reduce him to ashes.” Ming Di snorted coldly.

Looking at Ming Di’s arrogant demeanor, Ye Qingtang couldn’t help feeling a deep sense of respect for the Holy Lord of Shadows. How formidable she must be to have this demon dragon remain so loyal to her.

...

Inside the Temple of Shadows, the leaders of the ancient clans were discussing how to convince Ye Qingtang to join in the battle.

Meanwhile, Ming Wang was quietly observing everything.

Suddenly, a huge tremor shook the entire Temple of Shadows.

“What’s happening?” The leaders were all shocked.

“Could it be that person is attacking us again?” The leaders exchanged looks before immediately running out of the temple to see what the hell was happening.

Ming Wang’s expression turned grim. He could feel a familiar aura spreading rapidly through the earth beneath his feet.

“Holy Son Ming Wang, what’s happening?” One of the clan leaders asked again.

Ming Wang did not respond and only frowned in silence.

Just as everyone was still feeling bewildered, a massive black figure suddenly burst out of the ground in front of the Temple of Shadows!

With a sudden boom, a gigantic hole exploded from the ground in front of the Temple of Shadows. A huge black figure flew straight up into the air. It possessed a tremendously oppressive aura and everyone stared after it in a daze.

In front of their eyes was a massive dragon spiraling up into the sky. The dragon was exceptionally large and covered the sun, casting the entire Temple of Shadows in the shadows.

“That is...” The leader of the Mu Clan stared in shock at the gigantic dragon. His eyes were nearly popping out of their sockets.

The black dragon had blood-red eyes and massive wings with glossy black scales...

Wasn’t this the demon dragon of the Temple of Shadows, Ming Di?!

Previously, Ming Di had gone on a killing spree in Central Mainland, bringing catastrophic destruction down on countless ancient clans. But in the past ten thousand years, the fearsome demon dragon had suddenly disappeared without a trace.

They never expected to once again meet this demon dragon.

Upon seeing Ming Di, the frown on Ming Wang’s face deepened, but then he was startled when he spotted the dashing figure riding upon Ming Di’s back.

“Ah Yao...”
