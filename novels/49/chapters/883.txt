Chapter 884 How Dare You Trick Me (2)

In no time, Ye You slowly landed beside Ling Yan. Her eyes were extremely cold as she sized up the Bone of the True Dragon in Ling Yan’s hand.

At this instant, Ling Yan looked at Ye You expressionlessly as he sat cross-legged on the ground

“Do you wish to live or die?” Ye You threw the question coldly.

However, Ling Yan smiled faintly after hearing Ye You. His lips curled up slightly, forming a devilishly charming smile. “May I know what enmity you and I have? This is our first meeting, but you’re asking about my life or

death.”

“I don’t know who you are, but I recognize the bone of the True Dragon in your hand,” Ye You said coldly.

“Oh?” Ling Yan immediately raised the bone of the True Dragon. “You’re talking about this.”

“Hand it to me, and I can spare your life,” Ye You said.

Once she obtained the Bone of the True Dragon, she could follow the Wintry Yin Aura on the bone of the True Dragon and find the inheritance in this Dragon Vein…

“So this stone is called the Bone of the True Dragon…” Ling Yan smiled. “Since you like this stone, you can have it then.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Then, Ling Yan tossed the Bone of the True Dragon to Ye You instantly without hesitation.

Once the Bone of the True Dragon was in her hand, she felt a penetrative Wintry Yin Aura that was extremely chilly, making it seem as though she had fallen into an ice cave.

“It indeed is the Bone of the True Dragon…”

Ye You muttered as she inspected the blue stone in her hand.

However, she was increasingly confused. The man before her clearly knew that this item was the Bone of the True Dragon. Why would he still give it to her so easily such that there was not a slight change in the expression his eyes?

“You have already gotten what you want. Why are you still here? Could it be that you still want to kill me?” Ling Yan asked.

“You are very sensible.”

Ye You studied Ling Yan, and it was then she realized that this man was extraordinarily good-looking. He was seated on the floor and seemed as though he had walked out of a painting

It was a pity that his martial cultivation was a sorry sight as he was only at the Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven realm.

Ever since Ye You was acknowledged by the Jiangs of the Central Mainland, she headed to the Central Mainland where the Jiang family was in, and her martial cultivation base had long advanced.

Currently, even an ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lord was nothing to Ye You, much less someone who was at Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven.

Swoosh!

In the next second, Ye You’s figure ascended into the sky and disappeared without a trace in an instant. Secretly, she hid in the cloud layers.

After Ye You completely disappeared, Ling Yan stood up slowly as his eyes mindlessly glanced at the sky. An unknowing smile was hung on his lips as he walked towards a cave not too quickly nor slowly.

About a few breaths later, Ling Yan finally entered the cave.

There was a spring in this massive cave, and in the spring visibly laid a fiery-red long feather.

The long feather was about the length of an arm and exuded an extremely hot aura.

This searing aura was completely covered by the spring, and there was simply no way for others to sense it.

Ling Yan took a few steps forward and stretched his hand into the spring, wanting to retrieve the fire feather.

However…

A figure arrived swiftly. Before Ling Yan could make a move, the figure had already taken the fire feather out from the spring.

Ye You looked at the fire feather in her hands and said coldly, “No wonder you were still so calm and composed even after handing the Bone of the True Dragon out. It turns out that you still have the Feather of the Divine Phoenix.”

“Ha… Miss, have you heard that if one is too greedy, there will definitely not be any good outcome?” Ling Yan looked at Ye You with an inexplicable smile.
