Chapter 1668: A Bet (3)

Even though Ye Qingtang had spoken, Mu Ruxue had no intention of letting her off.

“Why? Are you scared now that you’ve seen Elder Brother Xuanyun and my elder sister? Where’s your pride? Ye Qingtang, let me tell you, I, Mu Ruxue, have already agreed to this bet. So you have to bet as well, whether you want to or not!”

“Sorry, please excuse me,” Ye Qingtang said.

Mu Ruxue was even more angry, but Baili Xuanyun pulled her back. “Younger Sister Ruxue, since she has some self-awareness, there is no need to force her.”

“But...” Mu Ruxue refused to concede.

Baili Xuanyun smiled and looked at Ye Qingtang dismissively. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Miss, since you don’t want to bet, we won’t force you. But just now, all of you bullied Ruxue with your careless words, so we can’t just let the matter drop. We’re not unreasonable people. If you are unwilling to gamble, then just admit that you’ve lost and disfigure yourself now. Then we won’t make things difficult for you anymore.” Baili Xuanyun sounded polite, but his words were infuriating.

“What did you say? Who are you to make Qingtang disfigure herself?!” Jiang Yisheng immediately lost his temper.

Baili Xuanyun smiled, but was indifferent to Jiang Yisheng’s rage.

“It’s alright if you don’t want to disfigure yourself. If you can beat me, we will drop the matter.” Baili Xuanyun deliberately pretended to be generous.

By now, the faces of Jiang Yisheng and the others immediately darkened to a pitch black. In contrast, Mu Ruxue looked incredibly smug.

Beat Baili Xuanyun?

What kind of joke was this!

Baili Xuanyun had been one of the top ten in the last Martial Arts Championship. Over the past few years, he had grown from strength to strength. Now in the entire Jiang family, probably only Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai could match him. The rest did not even dare to think about it.

Ye Qingtang had only come to the valley half a year ago, and was the last of the Jiang family’s top twenty. Fighting Baili Xuanyun would be akin to seeking her own death.

“That’s as good as not saying anything. You’re just forcing Qingtang to disfigure herself.” Jiang Yisheng had never met anyone as shameless as Baili Xuanyun.

How dare he make such a request!

“I’ve already said that I don’t want to make things difficult for her. I’ve already given you two choices, you can make your own decision. Or can it be that... your Jiang family’s younger generation has declined to the point that you don’t even have the courage to fight someone?” Baili Xuanyun said mockingly.

No one had anticipated this turn of events.

Jiang Yiran was also taken aback. He just wanted to annoy Mu Ruxue, but had forgotten that he was also getting Ye Qingtang into deep trouble.

Put on the spot like this, Jiang Yiran was embarrassed. Although he was always needling Ye Qingtang, he was really innocent this time. His sole purpose had been to annoy Mu Ruxue, and he had forgotten that the crucial person in this bet was Ye Qingtang and not himself.

And then Baili Xuanyun had appeared and blown up the incident even further.

“I was the one who spoke carelessly, and I was also the one who made the bet. I caused this incident. If you’re displeased, I’ll apologize to you now.” Jiang Yiran gritted his teeth as he suddenly stood up and spoke up.

Although he was proud and rather perverse, he was no coward. Now that he had created trouble, he would not allow Ye Qingtang to take the blame.
