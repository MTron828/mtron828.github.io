Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Senior Brother Song, the Life and Death Ring hasn’t ended. Where do you wish to go?” There was a hint of laughter in Ye Qingtang’s voice, which sounded behind Song Junqiu.

He only heard it, but it was enough for him to almost break down in fear.

“Warden Song… Save me… Save me…” Song Junqiu pleaded for help to Warden Song, who was walking over with great strides.

Warden Song looked just over forty, and there were some similarities between his face and Song Junqiu’s. He was related to Song Junqiu’s family clan by blood and was ordered by the family clan to look after Song Junqiu in Xuanling Sect. Song Junqiu relied on Warden Song’s care and committed many wrongdoings in the inner sect.

Ye Qingtang walked to the back of Song Junqiu. She grabbed his hair with a hand, forcing him to lift his head, while her other hand held on the black dagger and pressed it on his neck.

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to slit Song Junqiu’s neck, Warden Song had already walked to the ring.

“Stop!” Upon seeing Song Junqiu’s wretched state, Warden Song was startled and shouted immediately.

Ye Qingtang’s hand that held the dagger paused as she looked at Warden Song.

“Do you have any instructions, warden?”

Warden Song’s brows furrowed slightly. “What are you all doing?”

“Life and Death Ring. Don’t you know it, warden? Senior Brother Song and I entered the Life and Death Ring, where death is determined by destiny, isn’t it?” Ye Qingtang said with a laugh. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In Ye Qingtang’s hands, Song Junqiu’s face was ash-white as he trembled in fear and continuously pleaded for help from Warden Song.

Warden Song’s expression was rather ugly. Song Junqiu was the eldest son of the Song family, and the family master had ordered him to look after Song Junqiu. If Song Junqiu died right before his eyes, he would be in a difficult position.

“You’ve already won the Life and Death Ring. You are all disciples of the same sect and should be lenient wherever possible,” Warden Song said coldly.

The group of disciples who were exhilarated from spectating was shocked when they heard Warden Song.

The rules of the Life and Death Ring were rules, but the relationship between Song Junqiu and Warden Song had long circulated in the inner sect. Now that Warden Song told Ye Qingtang to release Song Junqiu, if Ye Qingtang was still bent on taking Song Junqiu’s life, wouldn’t it be a slap to Warden Song’s face in public?

Song Junqiu was already completely frightened anyway, so why not give Warden Song face instead? Perhaps she would have some benefits in the future.

Moreover, it was believed that no disciple in the inner sect was willing to offend a warden.

Ye Qingtang was not hurried to reply. With a smile, she looked at Warden Song’s stern face and then at Song Junqiu, who was quivering in fear. Then, she released her grasp on Song Junqiu’s hair and kept the dagger.

Song Junqiu heaved a huge sigh of relief. With Warden Song here now as his backing, he was not that terrified anymore, and his hatred towards Ye Qingtang arose again.

This hatred would never be appeased if he did not kill Ye Qingtang!

The disciples understood Ye Qingtang’s “wise” action. If it were them, they would naturally not offend a warden over the grievance of an attendant girl.

However…

Just as everyone thought Song Junqiu was safe and sound, Ye Qingtang’s eyes suddenly sharpened, and the dagger that she just kept was violently stabbed into the left side of his back!

The dagger penetrated through the flesh in an instant and pierced right into his heart!

Never had Song Junqiu expected that Ye Qingtang would actually attack him again. He widened his terror-filled eyes under the excruciating pain, and before he could struggle, his breathing stopped.
