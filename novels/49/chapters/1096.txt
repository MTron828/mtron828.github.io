Chapter 1097 Plunder (2)

They would never hand over the boy and the girl even if they had to die here today!

The few ancient clan people were a little surprised after hearing that.

Apparently, they did not expect that the people below dared to resist their orders!

Their faces immediately clouded.

They had never put people of the Falling Sky Valley in their eyes.

It was extremely easy to kill everyone in the valley.

However, the girl was very fragile.

They could kill everyone in the valley instantly. However, the force might hurt the girl as well. They could not afford the loss if the girl died here.

“You overestimated your capabilities.” A few ancient clan people landed and walked straight towards the huge tree.

“What do you want!” A few Peak Masters walked forward, trying to block them.

However, before they could get to the ancient clan people, they had to retreat under their aura. All the ancient clan people were Yang Lords. Normal people could never be able to fight them.

Perfected Xuanchen and the rest could not do anything in front of the ancient clan people even though they wanted to protect the two babies.

The boy seemed to feel the greedy sight of the ancient clan people. He suddenly landed onto the ground from the tree after staying on the tree for the past few days. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When he was falling, he hugged the girl’s feet and dragged her down as well.

The moment the two of them landed, the boy pulled the confused girl towards somewhere safe.

“Oh…”

The few ancient clan people’s lips tugged up into an unknown smile, and their interest seemed to be aroused.

However, one of them stepped out and blocked the boy’s way.

The boy fell to the ground and moved back a few steps back.

The girl stared at the ancient clan figure with fear.

The boy rushed forward again. He stretched his hands and pulled the girl behind her.

“Hahaha, Luo Xue Demon King, how did you end up like this now… Interesting, this is very interesting.” The middle-aged man in the golden robe stared at the boy with interest and laughed.“However, Luo Xue Demon King… you don’t need to rush… After getting the woman’s Spiritual Abode, we will nurture you… You will be the most powerful killer of the hidden ancient clan. In the future, you’ll act according to our order and be a puppet… You’ll have no sorrow and anxiety…” The middle-aged man in the golden robe laughed again.

The boy was the reincarnation of Luo Xue Demon King and might even possess martial talent beyond the Luo Xue Demon King. If he could grow up, he would be a renowned supreme chief. The ancient clan would dare to attack the third domain with his help.

The girl shivered and hid behind the boy. Her eyes were filled with fear and anxiety.

“Listen to me and move now.”

The middle-aged man in the golden robe stared at the boy and smiled coldly.

However, the boy did not seem to hear his words as he had no intention to move.

“Humph, it seems like you don’t know what the right thing to do is!”

The smile on the middle-aged man in golden robe faded. His face was cold and expressionless.
