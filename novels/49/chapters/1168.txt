Chapter 1169: A Collective Battle (2)

However, in the eyes of Peerless School, the Peerless School was superior and represented absolute authority in the Nine Nights Dynasty’s land. As such, the Peerless School Sect Master did not care about it and had never respected Falling Sky Valley.

But today, Falling Sky Valley was not like before…

“Let’s not talk about him today. How does Peerless School intend to give Falling Sky Valley an explanation?” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

“I understand.” Peerless School Sect Master looked behind.

Two Peerless School senior executives dragged a young man who was about thirty years old into the main hall.

“Valley Master Xuanchen, this is the murderer of your daughter. He was only a disciple in Peerless School back then. He has passed the age for disciples, and his performance is pretty good, so he became a warden in Peerless School. I brought him here to Falling Sky Valley today for you to punish him however you want,” Peerless School Sect Master said.

The Peerless School did not care for a mere warden; what the Peerless School minded was just their face. Handing this warden to Falling Sky Valley was equivalent to telling the world that the Peerless School yielded to the Falling Sky Valley.

However, the current situation was very unique. The South battlefield had fallen into an extremely disadvantageous position. Should this continue on, Peerless School would definitely be annihilated. Moreover, the You Ancient Clan had already begun invading the Nine Nights Dynasty’s land.

Furthermore, the Peerless School was at fault for this incident from the start. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang sized up that young warden and then looked at Perfected Xuanchen.

She was very clear that regardless of the conflicts and grudges between Falling Sky Valley and Peerless School, neither party should blow up at the other in such a special period.

Perfected Xuanchen was naturally aware of the current circumstance as well. Since Peerless School was willing to hand over that disciple, it was considered their act of sincerity, and Perfected Xuanchen would not hold onto the past matter.

Immediately, Perfected Xuanchen walked forward and arrived beside that young male.

The young male trembled slightly and looked at Perfected Xuanchen in fear.

Swoosh!

Without uttering a word, Perfected Xuanchen struck his palm out and crushed the young male’s skull with his palm force.

Looking at the young man who tragically died before him, the rage that Perfected Xuanchen had been repressing for years seemed to dissipate at this moment.

No matter what, he personally avenged his daughter…

“Valley Master Xuanchen, we are extremely regretful of the incident back then. If this mainland can be safe and the enemies are chased away, my Peerless School will definitely give you a satisfying compensation.” The Peerless School Sect Master looked at Perfected Xuanchen and said.

Perfected Xuanchen shook his head. “Forget about the compensation.”

His daughter had already died, and however much compensation was unable to retrieve the situation. Now, his daughter’s murderer was personally killed by him, and he did not wish to continue pursuing or mentioning this matter.

After seeing that Perfected Xuanchen had completely calmed down, Daoist Zijin told the Peerless School Sect Master. “Tell us about the situation in the South battlefield.”

“The South battlefield is guarded by the Master of the obscure ancient clan, but the You Ancient Clan increased the deployment of powerful figures into the South battlefield… It is difficult for us to resist them. The Formidable Heavens Dynasty is currently lost. Peerless School, Phantom Valley, and Beiming Manor suffered heavy losses, and it is the same for the ancient clan, causing parts of the Nine Nights Dynasty to be seized as well.” The Peerless School Sect Master could not help but sigh after informing them of the situation.
