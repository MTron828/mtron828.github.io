Initially, Elder Mo wanted to reproach Ye Qingtang for playing around.

Without enough cultivation background, forcefully charging towards Martial Qi Level Two from the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One would result in one being swallowed by their mental demons and have dire consequences should they fail.

Once, a disciple whom Elder Mo doted on the most wanted to break through to Martial Qi Level Two but forcefully charged towards the realm without enough cultivation. Ultimately, the disciple’s inner qi reversed, and he died on the spot.

To now, Elder Mo was unable to forget how his disciple died tragically.

However…

Looking at how Ye Qingtang’s breathing was controlled, Elder Mo was deeply astonished, and the words that he wanted to lash out at her were no longer able to leave his mouth.

“Martial Qi Level Two… Second Heaven…”

Elder Mo was utterly dumbfounded on the spot in disbelief.

When normal cultivators succeeded in charging towards a higher realm, they would at most advance from the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One to the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two.

However, Ye Qingtang surpassed his purview: not only was she successful in charging towards a new realm, she even advanced to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two!

Then, Elder Lin walked out of his room as well, and an expression of shock filled his face as he saw Ye Qingtang from not far away.

Rapidly, Elder Lin’s eyes were slightly gloomy. Ye Qingtang had already entered the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two currently, and she could even be able to have a battle with… the chief disciple of Xuanling Sect!

“Qingtang, come over here.” Elder Mo waved at Ye Qingtang.

After hearing that, Ye Qingtang nodded and walked to Elder Mo’s side.

“It really is the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two…” Elder Mo’s eyes twinkled, and the disbelief on his face turned into an inexplicable delight.

“Qingtang, it is really my blessing to have such a disciple like you.” Elder Mo finally uttered with a sigh after a long while.

“What are you saying about, Master? If you hadn’t fought for a Mind and Heart Pill for me, I would not be able to break through so easily.” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

Elder Mo shook his head with a laugh. While the Mind and Heart Pill was precious, it was not like what Ye Qingtang said. If there could be such a miracle by relying on just one Mind and Heart Pill, Qinglin Sect’s current skills would probably have exceeded that of Yunxiao Sect’s long ago.

“Qingtang, you just made a breakthrough. Do rest well and consolidate your cultivation.” After a long while, Elder Mo looked at Ye Qingtang with eyes full of adoration.

…

In the room, Ye Qingtang sat on the floor. The inner qi in her body gradually turned into primordial qi.

The body of a cultivator at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level One had inner qi of which nature would change into primordial qi once the cultivator reached Martial Qi Level Two.

While there was only a difference in one word between inner qi and primordial qi, there was a world of differences.

Inner qi could only be used to kill enemies while primordial qi could be transformed into armies and even form a primordial qi wing for the cultivator travel in the air. All of this was unable to be done with inner qi.

“Since I’ve entered Martial Qi Level Two, I can use the Feather Formation Technique already…” Ye Qingtang mumbled.

Feather Formation Technique was a remarkable skill Ye Qingtang learned in her previous life, which used the primordial qi to create a pair of wings.

Swiftly, the power of the primordial qi flowed out of her body, and a huge pair of wings instantly appeared on her back.

The wings flapped slightly, and a hurricane ensued in the room.

At the same time, Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered. She flapped her primordial qi wings and extinguished the oil lamp in the room.

About a few breaths later, the door of the room opened with a squeak.

“It’s him…”

Ye Qingtang hid in a secret corner and observed the uninvited guest.

Ye Qingtang did not expect Fu Lingtian to have such audacity to take her life without hesitating to intrude into Xuanling Sect’s area.

“Ha….”

A sinister laugh broke out in the darkness. “Do you think you’ll be fine as long as you hide?”
