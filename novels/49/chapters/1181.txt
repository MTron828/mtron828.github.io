Chapter 1182: Defend (3)

Since Ye Qingtang believed Ling Yan’s calculation, she would die if she stayed.

She naturally also believed his calculation that this mainland would be completely wiped out once she left.

If she left, her loved ones whom she tried so hard to protect until now…

Ye Qingtang closed her eyes and took a deep breath. The next time she opened her eyes, they were filled with determination.

“If that’s the case, I will not leave then,” Ye Qingtang said resolutely.

In her previous life, she lost everything at a young age and had no one to care for. She had tasted such qualms and regret for three hundred years.

In this life, even if she knew she would die, she still wished to protect the people whom she cared about.

Ling Yan remained silent for a moment after hearing Ye Qingtang’s reply. Sometime later, his voice could be heard again, though the usual trace of laughter in his tone was absent this time.

“Miss Ye, other people’s life or death have nothing to do with me. I only wish to protect you and ensure that you are safe.”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback by Ling Yan, and her lips tugged up into a smile uncontrollably.

“Thank you…”

Ye Qingtang looked at the wide sky through the window of the pavilion.

“Ling Yan, my family and friends are in this mainland… If I get lucky and don’t die, I will definitely go to the Eternal Dynasty to rescue you.”

Without waiting for Ling Yan to say anything more, Ye Qingtang switched off her voice transmission stone. She looked at the little white tiger that was sleeping soundly beside her and then kept the voice transmission stone.

Ye Qingtang believed that humans could control their destiny. Her life should be controlled by herself and should not be left to destiny.

Even if she was really going to die in this great war, she would crawl out from hell once again.

Having lived two lives, she had too many ties and people she cared for in this mainland. No matter how dangerous the road ahead was, she would not abandon her friends and family and leave alone.

In this life, she must protect them to the very end.

The wind blew in the dark night. Ye Qingtang remained awake the entire night.

In the early hours of the next day, a young teen knocked on Ye Qingtang’s door and informed her that Gu Yu called her to the main hall.

Ye Qingtang immediately left her room and followed the young teen to Heaven City’s meeting hall.

Many powerful figures in Heaven City were already there, and Gu Yu was seated at the host seat.

Noticing that Ye Qingtang had arrived, many powerful figures looked at Ye Qingtang amiably.

Ye Qingtang’s victory over You Tianhe of the Ancient You Clan yesterday had won a small chance of survival for Heaven City and helped them vent their anger.

“Haha. Miss Ye is here. Quickly take a seat,” Gu Yu said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang nodded and sat on an empty seat at the left.

“Alright, since everyone is here, let’s discuss how to counter the Ancient You Clan’s attack on Heaven City today.” Gu Yu swept a glance across everyone and said.

Upon hearing that, many powerful figures looked at each other and had nothing to say for a moment. How would they know how to tackle the Ancient You Clan’s strategy of surrounding the city?

“Miss Ye, do you have any good ideas?” Gu Yu’s eyes landed on Ye Qingtang when he saw that everyone was silent.

“Senior Gu Yu is the overall General. Our opinions and ideas are not important. Since you assembled us together to discuss the matter, I believe you should have thought of a sound plan,” Ye Qingtang said without hesitation.
