Chapter 666: Who Are You To Do That

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang sighed after hearing Ning Luo.

This sigh was not because of this mainland nor the Dimension Wall but because she felt rather pitiful towards this Ice Frost Divine Sword.

Every since its spiritual wisdom was activated and it turned into a sword spirit, it had been in a world of misery and seeking revenge…

Currently, two-thirds of the Dimension Wall was destroyed, which was considered a huge blessing in the misfortune to Ye Qingtang.

If the Dimension Wall were completely destroyed, people from that ancient clan in the Central Mainland would definitely be able to find this place in less than ten days. However, there was still one-third of the Dimension Wall remaining, which could buy them some time.

“Ye Qingtang, I hate those who are all talk and no action the most in my life. Since you think that the living beings on this mainland are innocent, do something then. If you’re afraid, you can choose to leave this mainland anytime… I hope that we can still meet one day.”

After the Ice Frost Divine Sword finished speaking, it turned into a sword shadow immediately and rushed into the end of the sky, vanishing from this mystic realm without a trace.

Along with Ning Luo’s disappearance, the demonized Buddha statue which was fighting with the white tiger turned silent immediately and no longer moved.

The white tiger roared angrily and slammed its paws down, crushing the demonized Buddha statue into powder.

As the truth of Ning Luo’s identity was revealed, Ye Qingtang finally understood why Ning Luo could influence and even control the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm.

As the Ice Frost Divine Sword, Ning Luo’s body had long been stained with the extraordinary lady’s aura. On the other hand, this mystic realm was transformed by the extraordinary lady’s Soul Formation. It was thus reasonable to think that Ning Luo could control this mystic realm.

However, before Ye Qingtang could continue to think deeply, cold laughter rang in the air.

“Fiendcelestial Beast, are you willing to follow me?”

Afterward, Ye You, who was seated on a huge, white spirit fox arrived slowly.

“F*ck you. Another one coveting after my blood and flesh!”

The energy in the white tiger’s body was already completely depleted, and it had turned into a little white tiger.

“Ye You?”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered when she saw the lady on the spirit fox.

Ye You probably obtained a pretty large inheritance from that illusory palace in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm. The spirit fox beneath her was a king-level demonic beast, yet it was also willing to acknowledge her as its master.

Many Yunxiao Sect disciples finally dared to appear after seeing Ye You.

“Congratulations Senior Sister Ye You for having advanced your skills!”

“Congratulations Senior Sister Ye You for obtaining a king-level demonic beast!”

“Senior Sister Ye You, that white tiger is the Fiendcelestial Beast in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm. If our Yunxiao Sect can obtain it, we will definitely become the number one super sect!” Apart from the compliments of the disciples, the only remaining Yunxiao Sect warden chimed in hurriedly.

“This Fiendcelestial Beast is destined to belong to me,” Ye You said without emotions.

Ye Qingtang sized up Ye You with interest.

Currently, Ye You was merely at the peak of Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven, which was not far from her, a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Even if Ye You had her blue spirit root, Ye Qingtang possessed the Ultimate Origin Skill.

Ye You wanted to snatch the Fiendcelestial Beast away from her. Who was she to do that?!

Before Ye Qingtang spoke, an icy laugh sounded above them. “Yours… In this mystic realm, everything is mine!”

“Who is that?!”

Ye You was alarmed.

In the next second, that Ice Frost Divine Sword that had initially disappeared suddenly returned.

Swoosh! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

An icy sword gleam flashed across and pierced into the king-level demonic beast beneath Ye You.

The king-level spirit fox let out a miserable cry. Unable to hold out any longer, it collapsed on the ground and died.

Even after, the sword force never decreased, and it threw Ye You several meters away from the point of impact.

Puff…

Ye You’s face was ash-white as she spat out a mouthful of blood.
