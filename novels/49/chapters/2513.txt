Chapter 2514: Not A God, But An Immortal (1)

Ye Qingtang did not intend to hide what had happened in the Wailing Well from the Academy Alliance Elder.

In fact, the Academy Alliance Elder had already learned everything about the Wailing Well from the Flying Star Academy teacher and Lu Yuanxiang. However, he had no idea what happened after they left.

“Teacher Ye, are you saying that a certain mysterious figure was resurrected in the Wailing Well?” The elder leaned on his walking stick and looked at Ye Qingtang thoughtfully.

Ye Qingtang nodded. “That’s right.”

“Teacher Ye, can you tell me the details?” The elder asked.

“Sure.” Ye Qingtang organized her thoughts before telling the elder everything she saw and heard in the Wailing Well, including the approximate abilities of the resurrected person.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s narration, the elder fell into silence as though he was searching for something in his mind. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After a long time, the elder said, “Alright… I roughly understand. How about this? I’ll record down what happened here and report it to our alliance headquarters. All of you don’t have to be too worried about anything.”

“Senior, how should we explain the nature of this matter? The people of Universe City have all disappeared, and the students of our academy have suffered heavy losses. If we don’t do anything about it, we won’t be able to account for the situation.” One of the Vice-Presidents said to the elder.

The old man replied, “At this stage, I can’t offer an explanation. As for how to deal with it, it has to be decided by our headquarters. As for the people of Universe City, the academies can continue searching for them.”

After saying that, the elder turned around and disappeared into the void. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared without a trace.

After the elder left, Wen Qi looked at Ye Qingtang with a smile. “Ye Qing, it’s been hard on you this whole time. Without you, the consequences would be unimaginable.”

Ye Qingtang did not say much. Things had gone as bad as they could get. Most of them had died in the Wailing Well. She did not have the ability to prevent all of it from happening. It was already the best outcome for Ye Qingtang that she and a few students survived.

“Vice-President, Boss is truly too formidable. If it wasn’t for Boss utilizing the Space Technique to bring us out of the palace, we would surely have ended up dead by now,” Lei Yan spoke up hastily.

When Lei Yan mentioned the Space Technique, the eyes of the Vice-Presidents flickered slightly and looked towards Ye Qingtang.

When Lu Yuanxiang, the Flying Star Academy teacher and the rest came out, they had already asked whether Ye Qing really used the Space Technique.

Lu Yuanxiang and the others naturally gave an affirmative answer. If Ye Qing did not know the Space Technique, how else could he explain his escape from the above-Emperor level monster previously? He might be suspected of conspiring with Universe City.

Keeping that in mind, everyone decided to tell the truth.

Of course, if it was just Lu Yuanxiang alone, it might be hard to believe. But everyone said the same thing, including the Flying Star Academy teacher and the few students who survived. At this point, no matter how unacceptable it was, they could only accept it.

“Haha, I really did not expect this. Teacher Ye is truly unfathomable.” The Vice Principal of Sky Martial Academy looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled..
