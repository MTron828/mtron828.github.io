Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang knew that she might be able to change history, but only for that point in time. Whatever happened next would not be within her control.

Even if Feng Wuyin’s previous fate did not happen because of Ye Qingtang, who knew what would happen in the future? Perhaps nothing else would happen to him or perhaps he would encounter an even greater calamity in the future. All of this no longer had anything to do with Ye Qingtang and was not something she could decide. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

As Ye Qingtang stared at Feng Wuyin, she inwardly wished him a safe life.

“Miss… Ye…” The Feng family patriarch came to Ye Qingtangs side.

“Patriarch, please speak freely,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Miss Ye… I did not know about Miss Ye’s prowess previously. Perhaps some of the Feng family’s younger generation may have offended you. I hope that Miss Ye will not take issue with them…” At that moment, the Feng family’s patriarch gazed respectfully at Ye Qingtang.

This woman in front of him had casually killed an Emperor-level powerhouse from the Feng Yun family. It had been a massive shock.

In response, Ye Qingtang only smiled faintly. “What do you mean,Patriarch? Of course I would not.”Ye Qingtang did not even know who the Feng family patriarch was referring to. She was not interested in knowing either.

“Thank you, Miss Ye. There’s one thing. Miss Ye, as you killed theFeng Yun family patriarch, it’s equivalent to destroying the Heavenly Demon Tribe Branch. I’m afraid that…” The Feng family’s patriarch hesitated to speak.

Without needing the Feng Family patriarch to say anything, Ye Qingtang knew what he meant.

There were probably two points. On the surface, the Feng family patriarch meant that she had killed the Feng Yun family patriarch so the Heavenly Demon Tribe Branch would definitely not let this go. They probably would not let her off. Another point was that the Heavenly Demon Tribe Branch would still target Feng Wuyin and probably also not let the Feng family off.

“Patriarch, you can rest assured.” Ye Qingtang said to the Feng Family patriarch, “You don’t have to worry about my safety. Also, if the Heavenly Demon Tribe Branch attacks the Feng family, I will not stand by and watch. However, with my skills, I might not be able to fight against the Heavenly Demon Tribe. Therefore, it’s best for you to make plans to escape as soon as possible.”Ye Qingtang did not think much of the branch itself. However, it was still the Heavenly Demon Tribe who was the force behind the branch.

Logically speaking, the Heavenly Demon Tribe was very far away from here. It was impossible for them to rush here to destroy an insignificant small faction just for a small branch. Nevertheless, they had to be prepared for the worst.

Actually, the Feng family patriarch knew this very well, even if Ye Qingtang didn’t mention it.

Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, violent explosions came from the sky.

Ye Qingtang was shocked and her breathing quickened. The faces of the Feng family members turned pale.

“So fast?”Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. One of her thoughts was that the Heavenly Demon Tribe Branch people must have come.

“Look!”The young Feng Jiuyou pointed upwards.

“That… that is…”The Feng family patriarch looked up at the two figures in the air, his pupils constricting.

“Unparalleled… Heavenly Emperor!””There’s one more. Isn’t that… Han Cangming, who is soon to become the Third Emperor!” The young Feng Jiuyou shouted.
