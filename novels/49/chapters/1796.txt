Chapter 1797: Escape (2)

There was no way the void energy could’ve recovered so fast after being destabilized. She mustn’t have run far!

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General immediately scanned his surroundings. But for some reason, there was no trace of her at all.

“Damn it!” The Heavenly Demon Race cursed out loud. Just as he was going to follow the flickering aura, a few familiar figures appeared in front of him.

“I knew it. There was no way you would hang around here without any reason. Is the Deity Ocean with that little fiendish demon?” The Earth Demon Race’s and Emperor Demon Race’s troops which had been leaving, appeared once again.

The face of the Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General darkened as he saw them.

“You two didn’t leave.”

“Leave? We’re not that stupid. You were the first one to touch the Deity Ocean and even tried to merge with it. It’s obvious that you’re most familiar with the aura of the Deity Ocean. And even when we told you that the sealed space was about to close just now, you showed no signs of leaving. I had my suspicions then, and it turns out I was right...” The Earth Demon Race’s Great General gave a low laugh.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General knew that he could no longer hide the truth and admitted everything. “So what if that’s the case? You two are the idiots. You didn’t even realize that the Deity Ocean had been taken.”

“Ha, is it in your hands then?” the Earth Demon Race’s Great General retorted savagely.

The Heavenly Demon Race’s Great General’s face blackened. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Forget it. This is not the time to be arguing. I just saw the little demon flash by and she might have slipped away. The most important thing right now is to find and catch her. As for who the Deity Ocean belongs to, we can settle that once we get our hands on it,” the Emperor Demon Race’s Great General said coldly.

...

Ye Qingtang had taken advantage of the chaos to escape using her invisibility. She originally planned to use this time to find the demons from the eastern race but realized once she had gotten to the mountain that there were only a few demons left in the sealed space which had once been swarmed by demons. All the other demons had already left.

She didn’t dare stay any longer and ran out of the sealed space as fast as she could, still invisible.

Once she had escaped from the sealed space, she decided to leave the deadly valley once and for all when she realized that she had left the Little White Tiger and Little Heavenly Demon back at the eastern camp.

Ye Qingtang was speechless. Things just got worse!

If she were to leave the two of them behind, Little Heavenly Demon would do just fine since it was a glutton and was strong. The demons wouldn’t hurt it. Little White Tiger on the other hand...

Ye Qingtang could already see the Little White Tiger going to meet her ancestors if she left him behind.

With a sigh, she backtracked towards the eastern camp.

Her life was really full of hardships.

At this moment, the air in the eastern camp was a little stifling. Hu, who had been heavily wounded, was looking better after devouring a few demon bodies.

“I’ve got to say, you’re pretty hard to kill, You scared me to death though.” Ba sigh in relief. In this battle, the eastern camp had not had many casualties so most of the demons were still out looking for the Deity Ocean.

“Is Qing back?” Hu gasped. His once-perfect skin had been ripped mercilessly, revealing his demon skin. He looked dejected.
