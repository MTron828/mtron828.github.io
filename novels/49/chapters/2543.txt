Chapter 2544: Dragon Emperor Clan (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The First Prince of the Sky Vault Sect cast a sweeping gaze at the people from the Dragon Emperor Clan. Indeed, the Dragon Emperor Clan was considered an evil cult in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and had never abided by the rules and principles. He heard from the Sky Vault Sect Paragon that many years ago, the Dragon Emperor Clan even started a plan to overthrow the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and eradicate all the factions that refused to submit. They wanted to completely disintegrate the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and take control of it.

During this period of time, the Dragon Emperor Clan captured many prodigious disciples of the various factions and sacrificed their blood for their destruction array. If not for the factions working together to resist them and the fact that there was a traitor in the Dragon Emperor Clan, the Clan would have succeeded long ago.

Now, it was indeed laughable to talk about rules and reason with these sinister devils.

“Heh, Elder. The Paragon has instructed us to bring this woman and her dog back. Why don’t we compromise? You can take this man with you? How about that?” The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince pointed at the Blood Moon Elder beside him.

“What a joke.” The middle-aged man’s face turned cold as he spat out,” I. Want. Them. All!”

“You…!” A cold glint appeared in the eyes of the Sky Vault Sect old man. Did the Dragon Emperor Clan really think that the Sky Vault Sect was afraid of them? How dare they be so arrogant?!

“What if I don’t give them to you?!” The old man from the Sky Vault Sect shouted.

The middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan suddenly made a move. However, his movements were so fast that no one from the Sky Vault Sect saw it other than their First Prince. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The next second, the middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan grabbed the old man’s neck and lifted him into the air.

The old man’s face flushed red. He did not expect the middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan to suddenly make a move. Caught off guard, e his life was now in the middle-aged man’s hands. It was too late for him to resist.

“Then die!” The middle-aged man of the Dragon Emperor Clan clenched his fists.

The sound of bones breaking rang out as the old man’s neck was crushed by the middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan. In the next second, a red light surged out of the old man’s head and escaped without a trace.

“Trying to run?!”

The middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan hollered when he saw that the old man’s soul was trying to escape from his body. With a wave of his right hand, a black light shot into the sky and instantly enveloped the red light.

In the next second, heart-wrenching cries rang out. It was the heart-wrenching cry of a divine soul in its last moments. It sounded as if it was enduring excruciating pain.

In the blink of an eye, the old man’s soul was burnt into nothingness, his soul and body both destroyed.

“No one can escape from the slaughter of my Dragon Emperor Clan.” The middle-aged man sneered. He then glanced at the First Prince of the Sky Vault Sect with a smile. “Your Highness, your subordinate was ignorant of etiquette. My Dragon Emperor Clan has eliminated him for you. I believe that you are smart enough not to blame me, correct?”

The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince narrowed his eyes. A harsh glint appeared in them before disappearing. A faint smile appeared on his face. “Of course. I wouldn’t forgive such an unruly subordinate even if the Dragon Emperor Clan didn’t interfere.. I feel sorry to have even troubled you.”
