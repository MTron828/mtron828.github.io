Chapter 949 Price (4)

Ling Yan did not seem to be concerned with what the little azure dragon said. “To me, the body is not important. So be it if it exists or is destroyed.”

“What did you say…” The little azure dragon was taken aback as astonishment filled its eyes.

“Ling Yan… could it be that you don’t intend to recover all of the body’s powers in the future?”

The little azure dragon looked at Ling Yan with a complicated expression and continued,

“Although you already have your current body… your powers are all in your previous body. Even if you’re unconcerned, at least recover your powers. That is where all of the Demon God’s martial powers are!”

The powers of that empty shell were not what Ling Yan’s current skill of Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven could compare to!

Was he really going to forgo it?!

Ling Yan merely flashed a tiny smile upon listening to what the little azure dragon said. “If I really viewed powers so importantly, I would not have handed the Heavenly Demon Pearl to Miss Ye.”

Ling Yan continued,

“In no more than three years, my skills can surpass my previous peak.”

“Why exactly is that so?” The little azure dragon could not comprehend Ling Yan’s thinking.

“Firstly, if I recovered the body’s powers, the Heavenly Dao destiny will sense it. Secondly, I don’t fancy that body’s powers.” Ling Yan smiled.

“The real reason is that you don’t fancy it, isn’t it?” The little azure dragon remarked meaningfully

“You can interpret it that way too.” Ling Yan laughed.

“Even if you don’t care about the body… don’t forget that the Heavenly Emperor should be on this mainland… Furthermore, he has already appeared.” The little azure dragon sighed softly.

Not only would the Heavenly Emperor destroy that body of Ling Yan’s, but he would also destroy Ye Qingtang.

“You don’t need to worry about such things,” Ling Yan said.

“ARH-W000000!”

Before the little azure dragon could say anything, a silver shadow suddenly flashed by from far away.

The silver wolf that should have left with Ye Qingtang suddenly chased after them. The silver wolf looked at Ling Yan with an irritated expression as it sprinted over wildly. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

However, only the silver wolf was in sight.

“This silver wolf was transformed by the killing intent of your body and has instincts. It seems that it has already identified who the true Demon God is.” The little azure dragon commented with a smile when it saw the silver wolf running over.

“Mhm.” Ling Yan looked at the silver wolf and said. “Given its skills, it will only be a hindrance if it remains beside Miss Ye. Let’s leave with it.”

Then, Ling Yan brought the silver wolf and the little azure dragon and walked northward where a few guards had already been waiting for a long time.

“Your Highness!”

The midget looked at Ling Yan and greeted respectfully.

“Seal off this mainland. Only entries are allowed. Exits are prohibited.” A trace of iciness silently flashed across Ling Yan’s eyes.

“Seal?”

The guards were slightly stunned and flabbergasted.

“Ling Yan… you’re thinking of blocking all the cultivators who came to this mainland from leaving… By the time when that ancient clan invades here, those powerful cultivators from the Central Mainland can only resist with their lives… In this case, it would reduce the pressure on Ye Qingtang…” The little azure dragon analyzed thoughtfully.

Ling Yan smiled and did not give any reply.

After receiving Ling Yan’s orders, the midget and other guards could only join hands to start the sealing formation.

Once the formation was activated, it would be difficult for even a Divine Arcane Supremacy to leave this mainland, although it was easy to enter.

“Your Highness, this formation can only persist for two months.”

After setting up the sealing formation, the midget reported.

“Two months, is it… That’s enough.” Ling Yan nodded.
