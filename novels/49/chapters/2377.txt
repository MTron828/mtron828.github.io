Respect and fear also flashed across the eyes of the crowd when they saw the middle-aged man.

“That is… Heaven Dome Academy’s Teacher Jin Qianyang? I heard news that he had come this time, but I didn’t expect that the rumors were true…”

“Hasn’t Jin Qianyang been in seclusion for a long time? How did Heaven Dome Academy manage to invite him over? Heaven Dome Academy must be going all out for this year’s Inter-Academy Competition.”

“Who is that beside him?”

“That is Yin Kongluo. A powerful freak who nearly killed Sky Martial Academy’s Xiao Yihan previously. He is Jin Qianyang’s direct disciple.

“Woah!! He was able to defeat someone like Xiao Yihan? What kind of freak is that?!”

The crowd was quietly shocked. In the blink of an eye, Jin Qianyang was already standing before Xing Rong.

Xing Rong stood trembling before Jin Qianyang. He exuded fear from every pore of his skin, completely unable to utter a single sound. His lips were pale and turning purple.

“What happened?” Jin Qianyang asked impassively. He was a strapping man, towering half a head over Xing Rong, who was already quite tall himself.

“T-Teacher… It’s… it’s them…” Xing Rong stammered. Faced with Jin Qianyang’s dominant aura, he was scared to death and could barely speak. He no longer had the mind to spin any lies but just narrated the entire incident. But because of his anxiety, his narration was rather convoluted and confusing.

Observing the scene before her, Ye Qingtang found it rather strange.

Jin Qianyang was a teacher from Heaven Dome Academy and therefore Xing Rong was likely his student. But Ye Qingtang had never seen a student who was that fearful of his own teacher.

This was not like the usual relationship between a student and teacher.

Xing Rong stammered for a long while before finally finishing his narration. He did not even dare to glance at Jin Qianyang and his hands were trembling uncontrollably.

This kind of fear which originated from the core was impossible to conceal.

“You were the one who borrowed Kongluo’s spirit jade?” Jin Qianyang’s voice was even.

But Xing Rong nearly fell to his knees in fright when he heard the question.

“Tea… Teacher. It was an accident. I was in the wrong. I shouldn’t have borrowed Senior Brother Yin’s spirit jade. P-Please forgive me…”

Realization dawned on everyone at Xing Rong’s words.

Xing Rong’s spirit jade didn’t even belong to him. He had borrowed it from Yin Kongluo.

No wonder Xing Rong had behaved so desperately after losing it. He was willing to shed aside his dignity to force Ye Qingtang to return it to him. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Teacher, it’s… it’s the Netherworld Academy teacher who flouted the rules. They should return the spirit jade…” Xing Rong was well aware of Yin Kongluo’s status. He did not dare to assume the responsibility of losing the spirit jade. He immediately pointed the finger at Ye Qingtang, hoping to divert Jin Qianyang’s attention from himself.

But before Xing Rong could finish his accusation, he was sent flying across the air as if he had been hit by a massive force, his body finally coming to a stop after crashing into a wall.

Jin Qianyang watched Xing Rong with a cold eye before suddenly speaking to Yin Kongluo, “Kongluo.”

Yin Kongluo immediately knew what Jin Qianyang was asking. He replied, “Master, one spirit jade is nothing to me. Moreover… the Inter-Academy Competition will be starting soon. By then, we will naturally get more spirit jades.. Others need that spirit jade more than me.”
