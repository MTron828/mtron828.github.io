Chapter 1890: Di Jiuyuan (3)

The veiled malevolence in Liu Rusu’s eyes was not hard to notice. Ye Qingtang had seen much of such hidden spite in the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang remained calm. She cast a sweeping glance at Long Xiao and the rest before saying, “Liu Ruofeng asked you all to seek me out in this manner? The Ten Thousand Poison Valley has become too bold. How dare you attack the people of my Dragon Emperor Clan.”

A powerful aura radiated from Ye Qingtang as she spoke those words.

The overwhelming aura momentarily startled Liu Rusu and the entourage around her. That intense, powerful aura was an immediate signal of how this woman was so much more formidable than them!

A drop of cold sweat dripped down Liu Rusu’s forehead.

Ye Qingtang heaved a secret sigh of relief on seeing Liu Rusu and her men’s reactions.

Before coming out, Long Xiao had specially given her a special elixir cultivated by the Dragon Emperor Clan. This elixir could imitate the aura of a powerful practitioner. While it could be used for intimidation purposes, her ruse would be exposed if they were to really engage in a fight.

Long Xiao also heaved a secret sigh of relief on seeing how well Ye Qingtang was acting.

This young lady from the First Domain was more steady than he had expected.

Liu Rusu and her men had initially suspected Ye Qingtang’s identity. But after experiencing her powerful aura, they were all feeling very fretful.

It must be said that no one in Long Xiao’s gang could exude such a powerful aura.

“Senior, please don’t be angry. We were following orders and had no choice. Master has been single-mindedly trying to find you for so many years. Every action we committed was only because we cared.” Liu Jiangran braced himself against the powerful aura as he spoke up.

“What a joke. Liu Ruofeng and I have nothing more to do with each other. If he really wanted to see me, he should have come himself. Otherwise...” Ye Qingtang secretly unleashed an extra modicum of the elixir inside her, exuding an even more oppressive aura.

During the debrief, Long Xiao hadn’t elaborated on what had happened between Di Jiuyuan and Liu Ruofeng. He had only given some brief points about it to Ye Qingtang.

Liu Jiangran didn’t speak but just exchanged looks with Liu Rusu.

The aura of this “Di Jiuyuan” was indeed powerful. But something just didn’t feel quite right.

They had harmed the people of the Dragon Emperor Clan and with Di Jiuyuan’s powers, there was no need for her to waste words with them. She could have just killed them all in the blink of an eye. But this “Di Jiuyuan” didn’t seem to have any intention of attacking them.

Why?

Their earlier suspicions surfaced once again.

“Senior...” Liu Jiangran wanted to probe again. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

But a cold glint suddenly flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she lifted her palm. A black, palm-sized metal globe floated upon her palm.

The faces of Liu Jiangran and the rest all turned ashen at the sight of the black globe!

The Absolute Ten Thousand Poison!

As Liu Ruofeng’s disciples, they naturally knew what that black ball in Ye Qingtang’s hand was.

That year, before Liu Ruofeng and Di Jiuyuan had parted ways, Liu Ruofeng had managed to cultivate the ultimate poison of the Second Domain. That poison was colorless, tasteless and odorless. It could kill without detection. Once poisoned, even Liu Ruofeng would not be able to neutralize the effects.

Liu Ruofeng had spent 10 years and was able to cultivate just one unit of that poison, and he had given it to Di Jiuyuan.

After their parting, Liu Ruofeng spent another decade cultivating another unit. That unit was now stored in the grand hall of the Ten Thousand Poison Valley.
