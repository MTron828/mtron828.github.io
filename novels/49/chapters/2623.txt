Chapter 2624 That Unparalleled Strike (1)

At that moment, she quickly retracted her gaze. She dared not look into those blood-red eyes.

Reigning in the mounting anxiety in her heart, she acted as though nothing was wrong, as though she had not noticed the figure at all.

Meanwhile, the blood-red eyes stared at her, evaluating her for a long time. After noticing that nothing was wrong, it turned its gaze away from her and back to the Heavenly Emperor.

It was only then that she allowed herself to breathe a sigh of relief as she noticed that the shadowy figure was no longer looking at her.

When their eyes met just now, she felt an immense sense of oppression, which seemed to have carved itself into her bones. It was like nothing she had ever experienced before.

She had no idea what the shadowy figure was but could confirm one thing. The Calamity of Wrath was being controlled by that shadowy figure. Not only that, the figure did not belong to this world and was from some otherworldly area.

She thanked her lucky stars that the shadowy figure was no longer fixated on her. Otherwise, there was no telling what might happen.

Furthermore, she needed the great dao power to see the figure. Without it, she was just like the people around her, with no idea about the shadowy figure’s existence.

“How strange…”

What was the shadowy figure after? It could control the Calamity of Wrath and had brought down countless Immortal Emperor level practitioners.

Was the shadowy figure there to prevent the Immortal Emperor level practitioners from ascending the Path to Heaven?

Of course, this was merely her guess and might not be true. It was hard for her to truly understand what was going on. “BOOM BOOM!!”

Before she could ponder this further, thunderous booms filled the sky. Every time the lightning from the Calamity of Wrath struck, the light around the Heavenly Emperor would dim.

“It’s the seventh bolt from Calamity of Wrath already!” One of the practitioners observing the situation shouted in agitation.

The number of Immortal Emperors who could withstand seven bolts of lightning from the Calamity of Wrath could be counted on one hand.

Many Immortal Emperors were already on the verge of being destroyed after the third or fourth bolt of lightning. They were usually unable to withstand the fifth to sixth bolt and would be turned to ashes. Yet this Heavenly Emperor had already withstood seven bolts.

But before long, Ye Qingtang looked up above the void only to see the shadowy figure controlling the thunder clouds. The eighth bolt of lightning seemed to be imminent. And indeed, soon after that another martial arts practitioner pointed at the thunder clouds above the void and said in shock, “Quick, look! The eighth bolt!”

There were ten bolts of Heavenly Tribulation in total from the Calamity of Wrath.

But up till today, they had never heard of any Immortal Emperors being able to withstand all ten bolts from the Calamity of Wrath before. Most of them had fallen before the seventh bolt.

Today, the Heavenly Emperor was facing his eighth bolt from the Calamity of Wrath. The eighth blood-colored lightning bolt from the Calamity of Wrath was immensely stronger than the seventh bolt and was much more concentrated in intensity.

Even Ye Qingtang who was standing within the Feng Family’s arena could feel the destructive power contained in the eighth bolt.

The power felt strong enough to destroy anything standing in its way.

At that moment, the deafening noise of the thunder shook the void endlessly. Yet the Heavenly Emperor stood facing the eighth bolt of lightning about to fall with no fear in his eyes.
