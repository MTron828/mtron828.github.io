Chapter 1691: Breakthrough (2)

As Jiang Yanyun’s injuries were very grave, Jiang Yiran quickly carried him off to seek treatment. Meanwhile, Baili Xuanyun strolled away from the arena. His lips were curled up in a sardonic smile as he watched the injured Jiang Yanyun being carried off.

The entire time, Jiang Yiran glared at Baili Xuanyun. If not for Jiang Yanyun stopping him, he would probably have impulsively charged at Baili Xuanyun.

Baili Xuanyun had clearly meant to cause such grievous injury to Jiang Yanyun!

But even though Jiang Yiran knew of Baili Xuanyun’s evil intentions, there really wasn’t anything he could do now.

The clans had all witnessed Jiang Yanyun’s defeat. To date, he was the most exceptional descendant of the Domain Monarch’s bloodline, but he was not fated to break into the Martial Arts Championship’s top ten.

Even though he was one of Jiang family’s two biggest hopes this year, he had already been defeated by Baili Xuanyun.

“Baili Xuanyun’s powers have indeed improved by quite a bit. The Baili Clan really knows how to teach its disciples.” The Qiu family’s elder was all smiles as he congratulated Elder Baili, who was also grinning from ear to ear.

“You are too kind, Elder Qiu. It’s just that the opponent was too weak.” Elder Baili was smiling but his words were full of mockery towards the Jiang family.

As he spoke, Elder Baili was standing not far off from the Jiang family members, plus he had purposely raised his voice, so that everyone from the Jiang family could hear him. His scornful tone cut into the hearts of the Jiang Family members like sharp blades.

They were descended from the Domain Monarch. How could they be subjected to such ridicule?

However...

Jiang Yanyun had really been defeated by Baili Xuanyun. No matter how angry they were, they had no choice but to swallow their rage.

The Baili Clan could be so arrogant because their descendants were so powerful. Not only the vastly-improved Baili Xuanyun—that insurmountable Baili Xi alone was like an enormous mountain weighing down upon the heads of the current generation of the Jiang family.

“The faces of those Baili family people, f*ck, it makes me want to puke just to look at them...” One of the Jiang family youths couldn’t resist cursing them in a low voice.

“What can we do? Even Brother Yun has been defeated by Baili Xuanyun. I am afraid our Jiang family will once again fall flat on our faces in this year’s Martial Arts Championship.” Another youth sighed glumly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

There was still a chance for Jiang Shaobai, who had chosen the elimination format. But the Jiang family’s most powerful candidate had already failed. This had utterly disrupted the Jiang family’s plans.

How would they make a comeback? Even if Jiang Shaobai could win and enter the top ten, it would be like trying to put out a raging fire with a cup of water. It was far from enough.

Like that, the Jiang family youths all felt immense pressure. Even the remaining Jiang family elders all looked extremely grim.

Several other challengers from the other clans went on to choose their opponent. After a few rounds of battles, they were all annihilated. This only served to demonstrate to the crowd just how terrifyingly powerful the top ten were.

After the people of the Island of Immortal Footsteps witnessed the defeat of all the challengers, they took a headcount and suddenly found that one was missing.

“Where is the Jiang family’s Ye Qingtang?” Someone in the crowd piped up. At that moment, most of the other clans realized that there was indeed one person missing from the Jiang family.

Although fighters could choose either the elimination or the challenge format, they could not choose the elimination format once the elimination rounds started.

“That Ye Qingtang must have been too scared to turn up. She has already missed the start of the elimination rounds. Even if she comes now, she has no choice but to challenge the incumbent top ten. With her current abilities, it’s just as well that she doesn’t show up. What an embarrassment for the Jiang family!”
