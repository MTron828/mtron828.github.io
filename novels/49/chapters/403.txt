Chapter 404: Three Sect Competition (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang stood up immediately at that thought.

The people participating in the Three Sect Competition were recommended by inner sect elders. If she wanted to go, she had to look for Elder Mo.

In this one month, Elder Mo did summon Ye Qingtang twice, but it was for her to repair some weapons for him, though he did provide her some martial arts guidance as well.

However, Ye Qingtang was already aware of whatever advice Elder Mo gave, and listening to it was not much help.

At that time, Elder Mo was discussing the upcoming Three Sect Competition with Elder Lin and other inner sect elders.

“In the past ten years, we were always at a disadvantageous position in the competition with Qinglin Sect and Wind Moon Sect. This has affected the sect’s glory. We must not be stuck in the same circumstance this year,” an elder said in a serious tone.

All the elders’ faces were rather ugly after hearing that.

Although the Three Sect Competition was for the disciples to learn from each other on the surface, it was actually very violent in reality.

Whether it was victory or defeat, it was extremely important to a sect’s glory.

Xuanling Sect had been in the last place for ten consecutive years, much to the dissatisfaction to the Sect Master and Grand Elder. If there was no improvement in their results this year, it would affect their reputation.

“The rules of the Three Sect Competition is not advantageous to our sect. If our top disciples went for the battle, our Xuanling Sect would naturally have the confidence to achieve victory,” another elder said with a frown.

“The rules were already laid down hundreds of years ago. Only outstanding inner sect disciples were allowed to battle, and all elite disciples were not allowed to participate. Even though we know it’s not advantageous to our sect, these rules cannot be broken,” Elder Mo said seriously. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xuanling Sect’s elite disciples were not inferior to Qinglin Sect’s and Wind Moon Sect’s, and they could even defeat them by a margin. However, the rules of the Three Sect Competition placed them in a perplexing situation.

“Elder Lin, do you have any suitable people in mind this year?” An elder looked at Elder Lin.

Elder Lin had accepted many talented disciples as his official disciple, and Ning Luo, a disciple under him, placed in the top three of Xuanling Sect. Ning Luo was still young and had brilliant endowments; his future was limitless. However, it was a pity that Ning Luo had already become an elite disciple and was unable to participate in the Three Sect Competition.

“Zhu Changge’s condition is pretty good this year. I intend to promote him to an elite disciple this year. Before that, he will represent us in the Three Sect Competition. There shouldn’t be a problem,” Elder Lin said. He was quite satisfied with his disciple, Zhu Changge.

“Zhu Changge? He isn’t bad indeed. However, just to be sure, may the elders put more thought into choosing a suitable candidate to participate in the Three Sect Competition this time? We must recover the sect’s reputation.”

“Of course.”

“Oh right. Apart from the official disciples who will be battling, the Sect Master wants us to select some disciples who are worth training as reserves to head to the competition as well. Although they will not take part, they could also broaden their horizons.”

After a long discussion, the elders finally dispersed.

Elder Mo returned to the Elders’ Hall after the discussion. The moment he stepped in, he suddenly saw a tiny figure in the hall.

Ye Qingtang?

“Greetings, Master.” Ye Qingtang had waited in the Elders’ Hall for a long time and immediately bowed to Elder Mo when she saw him.

“Is there any matter?” Elder Mo’s mind was still on the Three Sect Competition. As the Internal Affairs Elder and the elder with the highest skills in the inner sect, he had to set an example. However, it was just that he was focused on cultivation and did not accept many disciples under him. More than that, most of his disciples were inner sect elites who could not participate in the Three Sect Competition.
