Chapter 1997: Sowing Discord (1)

The main hall fell into a deathly silence.

Bai Zhi suddenly laughed as she looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Mo Yao, you’re really surprising me more and more with your audacity. You actually put up such an elaborate show just to keep the Netherworld Ring for yourself.”

Ye Qingtang looked back at her.

It’s a show alright, just not the way you’re thinking.

Retracting her gaze, she turned her sights on Xue Fu.

“What happened?”

Xue Fu didn’t dare keep anything to himself and spilled all of the details about the Ancient You Clan’s theft. He had no idea that the Ancient You Clan would attack them.

The Ancient You Clan and the Temple of Shadows had been at odds for the longest time. They rarely crossed paths with each other apart from this encounter. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Which was why Xue Fu had never expected them to be attacked. Yet he had no idea how many times his master and Ming Di had provoked the Ancient You Clan.

Meanwhile, Bai Zhi looked on coldly from the side, not taking into account Xue Fu’s words at all. “This is coming from your mouth and you’re on the same side. Of course you can say anything you want.”

Without speaking, Ye Qingtang walked over to Xue Fu. Under Xue Fu’s guilty gaze, she raised her hand and took off the earring on his ear, then passed it to Bai Zhi.

“You can take a look yourself if you don’t believe him.”

“What’s that?” Bai Zhi asked as she looked at the earring in her hand.

Xue Fu was confused as well. Ye Qingtang had given him that earring before he left and he had thought that it was her reward to him.

“I knew that you wouldn’t believe that I would hand over the Netherworld Ring. I was also worried that the Crimson League would deny it after I handed over the Netherworld Ring, so I used the Drawing Spirit Stone to make this and gave it to Xue Fu,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Drawing Spirit Stone was one which could record everything it saw. But it was extremely rare, and she had only heard of and had never seen it before in her previous life.

Ling Yan had given her this Drawing Spirit Stone. She suspected that he had already foresaw all of this and knew that the Drawing Spirit Stone would be useful here.

That damn sly demon...

Bai Zhi had obviously heard of the Drawing Spirit Stone. It could only be used one and would become useless after that.

The doubt was evident on her face as she opened the Spirit Stone. In the next second, an image suddenly appeared in the main hall of the Temple of Shadows.

In the floating scene, Ye Qingtang put the Netherworld Ring into the beautiful box and personally handed it to Xue Fu. But after leaving the Temple of Shadows, Xue Fu and the group were indeed ambushed by the Ancient You Clan...

Everything that happened next was as Xue Fu had said.

Bai Zhi’s face got darker and darker as she heard the Ancient You Clan Warden proclaiming that there was no one they dared not rob in the world.

“How daring of them to steal something from the Crimson League!”

Bai Zhi smiled as a steely glint flashed in her eyes.

How dare someone from the First Domain steal from the Crimson League. They were asking for death!

Ye Qingtang felt relieved as she looked at Bai Zhi’s reaction.

But she remained calm on the surface.

“I never knew that the Ancient You Clan had such guts. But thinking back about it, I don’t think they knew that this was for the Crimson League.”

After all, Xue Fu hadn’t at any point disclosed who the items were for. And Ye Qingtang didn’t want to accuse the Ancient You Clan at this point in time yet.
