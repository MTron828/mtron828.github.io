Chapter 2641 Saint Ye Yue (2)

Over the past few years, Ye Qingtang had gone into seclusion to cultivate and rarely went out. She rarely appeared even within the Great Immortal Temple. Everyone knew that the Nine Heavens Saint of the Great Immortal Temple had accepted a disciple but no one knew who it was.

Ye Qingtang had been in seclusion for several years and her martial art skills had already entered the Emperor stage.

The Emperor stage was completely different from the Divine Lord stage. There were a total of nine levels to the Divine Lord realm, but there were only three different levels for the Emperor realm. They were the Worldly Emperor level, the Illusory Emperor level and the Heaven Emperor level.

Even so, most Emperor level practitioners would spend their entire lives wandering around the Worldly Emperor level, never coming close to the Illusionary level.

After being in seclusion for several years, Ye Qingtang’s cultivation level had already entered the Illusionary Emperor stage. and was fast charging towards the Heaven Emperor level.

As for how to return to her own era, Ye Qingtang did not know but she never gave up trying to find opportunities. During this period of time, apart from finding a way to return to her own era, Ye Qingtang did not forget the power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. However, she still made no progress in that area. “Madam.”

A moment later, an Emperor-level figure entered the back mountain and looked at Ye Qingtang respectfully.

“Speak.” Ye Qingtang looked at the person.

“Madam, the Nine Heavens Saint is looking for you. He wants you to go to the Saint’s residence,” the Emperor-level person reported.

Ye Qingtang nodded and said to Feng Wuyin and Feng Jiuyou, “The two of you cultivate well. Don’t be lazy.”

“Sister Ye Yue, don’t worry!” Feng Jiuyou said.

“We’ll work hard!” Feng Wuyin chimed in.

Ye Qingtang smiled and turned to leave.

Inside the Saint’s residence.

An elder with white hair and beard sat in the main seat of the hall.

“Master.”

Ye Qingtang said with cupped fists when she saw the elder.

“Yue’er, I heard that you came out of seclusion, so I asked you to come over.” The white-haired elder sized up Ye Qingtang. This elder with white hair and beard sat in the distance, but he gave off an endless suppressive aura. His entire being was like an immovable mountain range. This aura was even more terrifying than the Heavenly Emperor and Han Cangming from several years ago.

The Nine Heavens Saint was one of the Saints of this era and also one of the founders of the Great Immortal Temple. He was an old supreme being who had lived for countless years.

When Ye Qingtang first met the Nine Heavens Saint. The Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline stirred inside her body, and this was detected by the Nine Heavens Saint. However, the Nine Heavens Saint still accepted Ye Qingtang as his disciple. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After that, the Nine Heavens Saint actually discovered that there was still a rare Great Dao power in Ye Qingtang’s body. He was extremely surprised and Ye Qingtang became the Nine Heavens Saint’s most favored disciple. Everyone knew that the Nine Heavens Saint had accepted a female disciple called Ye Yue and was prepared to groom this disciple to become the next Saint. Therefore, everyone called Ye Qingtang, Saint Ye Yue.

“I’ve let Master worry about me all these years,” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Yue’er, you’ve already broken through from the Worldly Emperor level to the Illusionary Emperor level…” The Nine Heavens Saint narrowed his eyes. “Master, I broke through about a year after I went into seclusion. Unfortunately, I encountered a bottleneck when breaking through to the Heaven Emperor level. My cultivation level has been increasing very slowly since then.” Ye Qingtang sighed.

If the strength of her martial art managed to increase at a steady pace, she would have broken through to the Heaven Emperor level a long time ago. Perhaps, she would even be on the threshold of the Immortal Emperor stage now.
