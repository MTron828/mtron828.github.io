Chapter 198: Speculation (3)

And because of this, the blacksmith’s reputation skyrocketed, and weapons forged with Spirit Crystals were crowned as ‘Spirit Weapons.’

Ye Qingtang lost her spirit root in her previous life and once thought of using the power of a spirit weapon to counter enemies.

Thus, she took a blacksmith as a teacher that time as well where she hid from people and learned the craft at the same time.

She was very clear that the current weapons were simply not on the same level as the future spirit weapons. If she could collect more Spirit Crystals before that mighty figure took out the first spirit weapon, it would definitely be of great help to her in the future.

One must know that once spirit weapons exploded in popularity, all the Spirit Crystals on earth were almost snatched away immediately by all the forces, and every crystal in the future could be sold at sky-high prices!

Ye Qingtang did not expect that she would see so many Spirit Crystals in the Dragon Court, and since she saw them, she would definitely not pass them by and got them all decisively! VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

However, Ye Qingtang was rather curious as to why Tong Hua had so many Spirit Crystals.

When she mentioned this, Qin Huan could not help but tug his lips upwards.

“Isn’t it all because that nincompoop is foolish! Half a year ago, he went out on a rewarded mission with a few senior brothers in the outer sect. Don’t look at how upright Senior Brother Tong is, he could even crumble a huge boulder into pieces if he threw out a punch. He put in a lot of effort in missions, and it could be said that he was highly connected to the completion of missions. Logically, he would be distributed the most basic amount of Xuanming points. However, those disciples on the mission with him took advantage of his good-nature.

“All of them said they badly needed Xuanming points and found an excuse to swallow the share that Senior Brother Tong should have. They even made it sound nice that they were not taking his share for nothing and auctioned these Spirit Crystals for him in an auction house near their mission location as a compensation…” Qin Huan became increasingly angry as he spoke. He had known Tong Hua for a long time already, and when he knew about this incident that time, he almost got into a fight with those bastards to help Tong Hua.

Ye Qingtang could not believe what she heard.

She did feel that Tong Hua was very honest but… this was too “innocent”.

Suddenly, Ye Qingtang felt that Senior Brother Yun’s good-man image was not that hard to accept after comparing him to Tong Hua.

“If you really want Spirit Crystals, you can take a look at the auction houses nearby,” Qin Huan said casually, though he did not know what Ye Qingtang wanted Spirit Crystals for.

Ye Qingtang had a plan as well and sympathized with the overly-honest Tong Hua a little.

Qin Huan followed Ye Qingtang and brought the bag of Spirit Crystals back to her room. Just when they returned to the room, they saw Su Wan, who was about to leave the room. Su Wan’s expression changed a little when she saw Ye Qingtang, but when she saw Qin Huan behind her, she could not help but narrow her eyes, though she left without saying anything.

“Where do I place this?” Qin Huan asked while carrying the Spirit Crystals when he entered the room.

But when he said this, he suddenly realized that he seemed to be glared at by a pair of sharp eyes. His eyes followed the direction of that feeling and suddenly saw…

That silver wolf which was lying on Ye Qingtang’s bed was staring at him with an extremely dangerous expression.

“…”

Qin Huan had goosebumps all over from the silver wolf’s glare, and he did not know why but he felt that if he stayed any longer, something ominous would happen. Right after he placed down the bag, he quickly found an excuse and escaped!
