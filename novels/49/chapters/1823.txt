Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As they made their way through, Ye Qingtang tried her best to remember all that she saw in the illusion.

She had seen the death of the Cursed True God in the illusion. If she was right, that place should be the Cemetery of the True Gods. So it was likely that the body of the Cursed True God should be there. As long as she followed the route she saw in the illusion, she should be able to find it.

The key not only protected her from the flames and lava, it also relieved Ye Qingtang from the scorching heat. In comparison to before, her journey was much more comfortable now.

But after traveling for half a day, Ye Qingtang suddenly noticed something strange about the flames raging above the ground.

The blazing fires were suddenly swaying intensely, as if strong winds were rushing through and sucking in the flames and lava into numerous spiralling fire dragons.

“What’s going on?” Little White Tiger watched the strange scene with incredulous eyes.

Ye Qingtang was also shocked.

In the blink of an eye, the strong winds died down and those flames and lava had been merged together into several three-meter tall fire monsters!

“Are those... fire demons?” Little White Tiger widened its eyes in disbelief at the fire demons. It felt like its mind was exploding.

“How can there be Fire Demons here?” Ye Qingtang was stunned.

Fire Demons were the servants of the Heavenly Demons and created by their power. In moments, Hundreds of Fire Demons had emerged from the intense flames.

The Fire Demons howled like wild beasts the moment they were formed. In the next second, they seemed to detect the presence of life around them, heading straight in the direction of Ye Qingtang and Little White Tiger.

“Fire Demons are the servants of Heavenly Demons. Get little Heavenly Demon to control them.” Even under such dire circumstances, Little White Tiger managed to keep its wits about it.

Ye Qingtang immediately looked down at Little Heavenly Demon in her arms. The little fellow was munching contentedly on a piece of meat. Ye Qingtang quickly snatched the piece of meat away from it.

Little Heavenly Demon was stunned. Its eyes immediately filled with tears as it stared after its beloved meat. It looked as if it was being bullied.

Ye Qingtang’s heart softened. But looking at the large number of Fire Demons, she steeled her resolve. “Make them stop and I will give you back this meat.”

Little Heavenly Demon gazed at Ye Qingtang in confusion. Anguished, it stared at the piece of meat with tear-filled eyes, before turning to look at the group of Fire Demons. Pouting, it suddenly roared at the bunch of Fire Demons.

Hearing that roar, those charging Fire Demons came to a sudden stop. They looked like they had been nailed to the ground, swaying side to side.

Thank goodness. Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief. Just as she was about to hand the meat back to Little Heavenly Demon, she suddenly saw that there were three exceptionally large Fire Demons who were not under little Heavenly Demon’s control. They continued to charge toward them from the back of the group, trampling over the rest of the immobile Fire Demons.

“What’s happening?!” Ye Qingtang was bewildered.

Weren’t they the servants of the Heavenly Demons?

Could it because Little Heavenly Demon was too young and so they refused to obey?!

“Run! Those three are mutant Fire Demons. Little Heavenly Demon is too young and can’t control them!” When he saw those three gigantic Fire Demons, Little White Tiger’s scalp went numb and its entire body tensed. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Not daring to hesitate any longer, Ye Qingtang picked up Little Heavenly Demon and Little White Tiger, escaping as quickly as she could.
