Chapter 2184: Medicine Faculty (4)

That alchemist was not very powerful but no one in the Second Domain would dare to offend him. The Grand Master-level elixirs that he could refine were the most sought-after treasures by all practitioners.

Many factions and powerful practitioners spent a lot of effort to draw this alchemist to their side. It was said that countless practitioners in the Second Domain would be more than willing to do his bidding. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Yun Chen explained the situation of the alchemy labs, providing Ye Qingtang with a general idea. As she was now a teacher, she wondered if she could get a high-grade alchemy lab.

With Ye Qingtang’s medicine cultivation skills, the boost offered by a higher grade lab would be insignificant. Nevertheless, the higher the better.

Yun Chen soon led Ye Qing and the rest to the teacher in charge of the alchemy labs.

The man was an elder in his sixties. He had a snow-white beard and a face full of wrinkles. He looked very stern. There were a bunch of medicine faculty students standing beside him.

Every month, the medicine faculty students would bring their best elixirs over here to be graded by this teacher. If the elixir was good enough, they could apply for a better-grade alchemy lab.

The teenagers whom Lei Yan and the others were speaking to earlier were also in the group.

“Teacher Feng.” Yun Chen made his way through the crowd and bowed politely.

Teacher Feng lifted his head slightly and glanced at Yun Chen. After realizing it was Yun Chen, he gave a slight frown and said, “Yun Chen, you should know your situation.”

Teacher Feng’s tone was mild but the meaning behind his words was clear. With Yun Chen’s medicine cultivation abilities, he really shouldn’t be here. It was already a charity to let him have the use of a low-grade alchemy lab.

Bitter amusement flashed across Yun Chen’s eyes, but he put on a politely genial smile. “Teacher Feng, I am here today because of my teacher. Teacher Ye wishes to see you.”

All the medicine faculty teenagers instinctively glanced over.

Teacher Feng also raised his eyes again and looked past Yun Chen to see the ordinary-looking, skinny youth.

“Teacher Ye?” Teacher Feng’s voice was low.

Ye Qingtang stepped forward. “I am Ye Qing. I wish to apply for a teacher alchemy lab.”

Yun Chen was stunned by Ye Qing’s words.

He thought that Ye Qing would just try to help him get a mid-grade alchemy lab. But... he never expected Ye Qing to immediately ask for a high-grade alchemy lab meant for teachers.

Lei Yan and the rest were also shocked.

Lei Yan tugged at Nangong Lie’s sleeve. “Our Boss is so open-handed. He is requesting a high-grade alchemy lab for Yun Chen right from the get-go.”

Nangong Lie was not as optimistic as Lei Yan.

Teacher Feng frowned slightly. He sized up Ye Qingtang and said, “Only teachers from the medicine faculty can use teacher alchemy labs. Teacher Ye looks very unfamiliar to me. You don’t look like one of the medicine faculty members.”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

Was that the case?

From what she had heard, she only knew that high-grade alchemy labs were meant for teachers. She didn’t know that there was a distinction between the teachers of the different faculties.
