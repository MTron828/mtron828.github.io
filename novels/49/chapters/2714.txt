Chapter 2715: High-Tier Ancient City (2)

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, you must not attack. You already have enough cursed points. Leave them to us…”

“They must have a lot of cursed points on them too. We must not let them off!”

Now, the Heavenly Saint Cult had become akin to a fat, juicy lamb. This was completely unexpected. They were like helpless lambs wandering into the tiger’s den!

The Heavenly Saint Cult was practically powerless against the Great Immortal Temple disciples. Within half an hour, the 20-plus people from the Heavenly Saint Cult were annihilated.

“My pagoda is really powerful,” Lan Shan muttered as he looked at the Soul-destroying Pagoda in his hand.

After the 20-plus people from Heavenly Saint Cult were wiped out, the disciples of the Great Immortal Temple gained nearly 20,000 cursed points in total.

After dealing with the Heavenly Saint Cult, everyone got Xie Jun to lead the way towards the high-tier ancient city. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

After about half a day, the Great Immortal Temple disciples arrived outside the high-tier ancient city.

However, the high-tier ancient city was already occupied by the disciples of various major factions. The Great Immortal Temple had the most cursed points and if they entered now, they would attract too much unwanted attention. Therefore, Ye Qingtang suggested that they quietly observe the situation first.

Over the next three days, multiple conflicts broke out between the major factions, who all flew out of the city to fight. Only then did Ye Qingtang and the rest quietly infiltrate the ancient city.

Ignoring everything else, this high-tier ancient city was much bigger than the previous low-tier city. However, because this ancient city was too big, it was not easy to find a shop.

“Are we going to the palace to exchange for the Paragon relic first?” One of the Great Immortal Temple disciples asked.

Zhang Chi shook his head. “There’s no rush to exchange for the Paragon Relic. High-tier ancient cities have even better divine weapons. We should arm ourselves better before getting Senior Sister Ye Yue to exchange for the Paragon Relic. This way, even if others discover us, we will have the ability to deal with them.”

Ye Qingtang agreed with Zhang Chi.

No one could guarantee that the other supreme factions would not eventually gather sufficient cursed points and exchange them for more divine weapons. Anyway, the Paragon relic only required 100,000 cursed points, so she was in no hurry to exchange it.

“Let’s take a look in the city,” said Ye Qingtang.

Everyone nodded.

A moment later, Zhang Chi found a shop. However, there was nothing inside the shop.

“Shopkeeper, is there a shopkeeper here?”

Lan Shan shouted as he slammed the table.

A moment later, a skeleton in luxurious clothes walked out of the back.

“You’re finally here.” One of the disciples smiled.

“Dear cultivators, this is a high-tier ancient city. The quality and price of the items sold here are very high.” The shopkeeper went straight to the point.

“Bring us to see the treasures first. Cursed points are not an issue!” Lan Shan said hurriedly.

The shopkeeper replied, “There are no treasures in this shop. There are only rare and precious spirit animals. Please follow me.”

The shopkeeper immediately turned and entered the back hall.

Ye Qingtang and the rest followed him. Everyone was quite interested in the rare spirit animals that the shopkeeper was talking about.

After passing through the back hall, everyone realized that there was another world there.

There was an open gorge where numerous strange beasts were being reared.

“Heavenly Cica…”

Zhang Chi’s gaze landed on an inconspicuous cicada and his expression changed slightly.
