Chapter 1099 I Will Certainly Protect You (1)

One of the ancient clan figures looked up at Ye Qingtang and scoffed. “It’s not easy for you to become a Yang Lord. Leave right now. You do not want to be involved in this.”

However, Ye Qingtang had no intention to leave at all. She stepped forward, and her eyes swept through everyone coldly.

Both the Luo Xue Divine King and the extraordinary lady had nothing to do with her previously.

However…

After witnessing everything that happened between the Luo Xue Divine King and You Ruo, she could not just stand at the side.

Ye Qingtang was reborn and went through two lives. She understood the kindness and hopelessness in the world. She only acted according to her heart.

She would definitely protect the two children!

“They’re my son and daughter. What kind of relationship do I have with them?” Ye Qingtang showed no sense of fear even though she was facing a few Yang Lords alone.

“Your son and daughter?”

The few ancient clan figures looked at each other and laughed.

“The boy and the girl grew from the tree, and you’re saying that they’re your son and daughter?!” The man in the golden robe scorned.

Ye Qingtang’s sight swept through the two children beside her. The boy called her ‘mother’ a few days ago.

She did not know how to react back then, but today…

She accepted that.

From today onwards, she would be their mother.

She would definitely protect them no matter what was going to happen ahead.

“Now I am,” Ye Qingtang said indifferently.

“Oh…”

The eyes of the man in the golden robe darkened. “You’re saying that you purposely want to go against the ancient clan now?”

Ye Qingtang did not want to find any trouble, but…

She was not afraid of anything!

At the same time in the Blood Moon Palace…

A blood-red robe was swaying along with the wind. The blood moon at the man’s glabella spread its heretic power as the man opened his eyes slowly.

“Is it time for the decision?” The man mumbled softly.

“Lord… what are you going to do?” A young man’s figure appeared.

“I have my decision.” The Blood Moon Holy Lord waved his right arm and disappeared.

In the Falling Sky Valley…

Ye Qingtang was more determined against the few ancient clan figures. She showed no intention to retreat.

“Today, I’ll certainly protect these two children,” Ye Qingtang said coldly towards the golden-robed man.

His face darkened upon hearing her words.

The ancient clan was the ruler of the mainland. Though they remained hidden, their power was insurmountable.

“You’re looking for your death here!”

The man in golden robe shouted. His martial power spread towards all directions instantly and surrounded the Falling Sky Valley.

Ye Qingtang did not even frown after sensing the power of the Yang Lord.She had nothing to be afraid of as long as they were not the Tenth Heaven Elders of the ancient clan.

Swoosh! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The golden-robed man pulled his sword out and slashed towards Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang grabbed the boy and the girl immediately and stepped backward swiftly

A deafening sound exploded. As the sword glint flashed, the palace behind Ye Qingtang collapsed.

“All retreat first!”

Ye Qingtang glanced at everyone of the Falling Sky Valley and said.

The Falling Sky Valley’s power was incomparable with the hidden ancient clan. The fight between Yang Lords could kill everyone of the Falling Sky Valley with just the aftershocks.
