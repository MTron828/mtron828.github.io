Chapter 2363: Universe City (3)

Ran Mo blinked before revealing his eye teeth. “What?”

Lei Yan and the others turned away, shaking their heads quietly.

Look at Xiao Yihan’s formidable presence, and then at this silly kid…

Why was there such a great disparity?

“Never mind. Our Little Mo Mo is still young. He still has time to grow up.” Nangong Lie chuckled as if he was trying to assure himself.

Ran Mo, “…”

Stop calling me Little Mo Mo!

“Boss, your cultivation level is so high. Help us see what stage Xiao Yihan is at now.” Lei Yan scurried over to Ye Qing’s side.

“Divine Lord Fourth Heaven peak level.”

“…”

The brats all gasped.

What the hell.

What a beast!

A teenager at the Divine Lord Fourth Heaven peak level?

Was this guy a monster?

“We’re doomed. I was still full of confidence for this Inter-Academy Competition, but now, I feel very inferior.” Lei Yan felt like he had endured a major bow.

Ye Qingtang shook her head with a small smile. She was also not that optimistic about the Netherworld Academy’s chances.

The Netherworld Academy was a top school but somehow, over the past few years, apart from that Grand Master alchemist, they had not produced any truly elite practitioners.

Although the standard of the Netherworld Academy students was all pretty good, the various academies had sent their best students for this competition. Faced with those exceptionally talented teenagers, Lei Yan and the others felt rather deflated.

Even their strongest, Qin Feng and Ran Mo, lagged when compared to someone like Xiao Yihan. And who knew how many more freakishly talented youths like Xiao Yihan were there in the whole Inter-Academy Competition?

The Netherworld Academy’s situation was not optimistic at all.

“Stop thinking about such pointless things. I will give you half a day to explore the city. From tomorrow onwards, you are all to stay in this building. You are not to run outside.” Ye Qingtang instructed.

“Yes!”

The brats had been worried that Ye Qing would not allow them to explore the city. But he was now giving them a whole half day to do so. They immediately perked up and after setting down their luggage, they went out as a group.

The other Netherworld Academy teenagers looked rather conflicted as they watched Lei Yan and the rest charge out of the North Hall in excitement.

After coming here, they finally realized what the word “elite” meant.

The genius freaks from the various academies had come in full force. They had been so confident while at the Netherworld Academy, but now in the North Hall, they were surrounded by Divine Lord stage practitioners. Their hearts felt very heavy.

Even their own teachers were looking rather grave.

But Lei Yan and the others appeared nonchalant?

To think that they still had the mood to go explore the city?

“Ye Qing, is it really appropriate to let them out at this point in time?” One of the other Netherworld Academy teachers asked. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Rather than restricting them all the time, it is better to give them some freedom.”

Ye Qingtang had considered this matter very carefully. They could only do their best and leave the rest to fate. She had some initial plans but was not entirely sure of them yet.

Moreover, she didn’t want to see her brats looking all despondent. It would be a depressing sight.

Putting down her luggage, Ye Qingtang was about to take a rest when Luo Sheng knocked on her door.

“Ye Qing, come with me. The Vice-President wants to see you.”

Wen Qi was looking for Ye Qing because of the Inter-Academy Competition rules. The regulations would be announced to the various academies tonight. As Ye Qing was in charge of the team competition, Wen Qi wanted him to come along to listen to the announcement.
