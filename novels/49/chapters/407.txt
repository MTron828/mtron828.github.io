Ye Qingtang found it pretty strange as well. A casual Xuanyuan Pill that this elderly took out was already a master-grade pill. However, since she could gain a bargain, obviously, she would be easier to talk to.

“Alright, I’ll promise you. However, you must give me the Xuanyuan Pill first.”

“You’re still pretty smart,” The elderly looked at Ye Qingtang and said. “I will give it to you. I won’t lie to you. I’ll send someone to bring the Xuanyuan Pill over. Come look at the Daybreak Crossbow with me first.”

The elderly returned back to the topic of forging after just a few sentences.

“Sure, senior.” Ye Qingtang immediately became obedient.

“Stop calling me senior already. It’s annoying to hear. My surname is Wu. You can just call me Venerable Wu from now on,” the elderly said.

“Yes, Venerable Wu.” Ye QingTang replied very obediently.

Venerable Wu nodded in satisfaction then and dragged Ye Qingtang into the forging room without wasting any time.

After witnessing everything, the incharge became extremely amused as he watched Venerable Wu drag Ye Qingtang away.

“Incharge, is it really suitable for His Excellency to do this?” The blacksmith aside swallowed his saliva. Xuanyuan Pill was a treasure, but it was to be exchanged for four hours of this girl’s time every day?

The incharge returned to his senses and was a little helpless.

“Don’t worry. If you want it, then increase your own forging skills. If you had that girl’s abilities, perhaps even you would have a share of the Xuanyuan Pill.”

The blacksmith scurried back to his position immediately after being stifled by the incharge’s words. After watching Ye Qingtang repair the Tower Sky Sword, he clearly recognized the difference in forging skills between him and Ye Qingtang no matter how unwilling he was. How was there any comparability?

According to the agreement, Venerable Wu sent someone to deliver the Xuanyuan Pill before Ye Qingtang left.

Ye Qingtang was in an uplifted mood after obtaining the Xuanyuan Pill. This pill was a treasure that others would not be able to buy with money. With this, she was more confident in the Three Sect Competition half a month later.

She was at stage two of the Second Heaven right now. Relying on this Xuanyuan Pill, she should be able to break through to stage three of the Second Heaven in the coming half a month.

Everything was very successful, but only the silver wolf was missing. Ye Qingtang ordered Ni Shang and Fei Ying to search for a long time, but their search was to no avail. No matter how regretful she was, she could only suppress it temporarily and hope that the silver wolf would return someday.

Ye Qingtang cultivated diligently every day, and her diligence influenced Ni Shang and Fei Ying.

This two little fellows cultivated with all their might, afraid that the previous incident would repeat once again.

Days passed. In the blink of an eye, it was the Three Sect Competition.

On the day to leave, Ye Qingtang arrived as scheduled and unexpectedly saw the Blood Moon Sect Elder in the team.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder stood in the team with an impatient expression. When he saw Ye Qingtang walking to his side, a chill ran down his spine.

“Why are you here?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder curiously. She was occupied with cultivation in the past few days and had no time to control him. Unexpectedly, he was actually on the team as well.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder fixed his emotions.

“Why am I here? Isn’t it all because that Elder Qin wants me to participate in the Three Sect Competition?”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was accepted into the inner sect as an exception because of his competence on arrays. Elder Qin valued him and provided him much guidance on usual days. The Blood Moon Sect Elder could not be bothered to b*llsh*t with Elder Qin and thus answered him eloquently, wanting to end it as early as possible.

Yet, unexpectedly…

His performance won Elder Qin’s favor even more and directly submitted his name for the Three Sect Competition!
