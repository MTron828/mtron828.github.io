1325 Had A Lot of Fun 3

“…”

So he has been playing dead these few days?

“I am here to thank you today, Miss Ye,” Ling Yan said.

“What are you thanking me for?” Ye Qingtang was perplexed.

“I had a lot of fun thanks to you, Miss Ye.” Ling Yan replied with a laugh.

“…” Why did this sentence sound so strange?

She suddenly had a strong urge to beat him up. What should she do?

“Don’t get complacent so early. Your siblings have not given up the thought to kill you. They were overjoyed when you accused the Mo Family. Ling Yan… you’re really merciless to accuse even your fiancée. I wonder how hard she is crying right now.” Ye Qingtang commented with a sigh.

Ling Yan’s laughter could be heard from the voice transmission stone. “There is no need for anyone who is disrespectful to you to exist.”

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback.

What Ling Yan said…

Why did it seem like he only accused the Mo Family for her?

Uncontrollably, she recalled the day of the banquet when Mo Yunxian was disrespectful to her.

Could it be that…

Ye Qingtang shook her head out of a sudden.

Wait, wait, wait.

She could not be deceived by this darn fox. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Anyway, did you predict how the Eldest Prince and the rest wanted to ruin you and planned your moves a long time ago?” Ye Qingtang divulged her guesses.

“There’s no need to predict or plan anything with regard to them.”

“…”

Had he belittled their intelligence to such a state?

“I’ve said before that it would be very boring without your assistance,” Ling Yan said gently.

“Forget it. I don’t wish to be involved in these matters anymore.” Ye Qingtang deeply believed that if this continued on, she would be thoroughly defeated by a certain someone. Although she had no choice but to help the Eldest Prince, she was still the one devising all the schemes…

This was equivalent to her having a battle of wits with Ling Yan.

God knows how tormenting this was.

“I’m afraid that you will still be involved even if you don’t wish to.” Ling Yan added on softly. “The Temple of Shadows sent you here with the intention of testing you. If you don’t wish to be involved, you will definitely expose yourself.”

“…” She wished to die right now.

“Didn’t you come to the Central Mainland to snatch back everything that belongs to you? Being in the Temple of Shadows may bring some hardships, but it is the most suitable option for you,” Ling Yan said slowly as though he guessed Ye Qingtang’s thoughts.

“The Ancient You Clan is formidable, and it is extremely difficult if you were to fight them alone. However, if you fight them as the Holy Lord of Shadows, how do you think it will turn out?”

“I am not the Holy Lord of Shadows.” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

“Is it important whether you are the Holy Lord of Shadows or not? As long as the Temple of Shadows believes that you are their Holy Lord, then you are it. Leaving aside the fact that the Temple of Shadows is formidable enough to confront the Ancient You Clan, just those cultivation techniques that are only available in the Temple of Shadows are extremely helpful to you. They are way more effective than laborious cultivation elsewhere.” Ling Yan persuaded softly.

Ye Qingtang was in deep thought. She had been treading on thin ice ever since she entered the Temple of Shadows as slight carelessness would mean death.

However…

Her purpose for coming to the Central Mainland was to snatch Little You Yun back from the Ancient You Clan.

Her family, Masters, and martial brothers had already disappeared. She had no inhibitions anymore.

“Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Miss Ye, why not take a gamble?”

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath.

Ling Yan was right. If she was all by herself, it would take extremely long for her to confront the Ancient You Clan no matter how hard she cultivated, and success was not even guaranteed.

But if she had the Temple of Shadows…

This was an opportunity.

If successful, she would snatch back everything. Otherwise, she would die.

“I’ll take the gamble.”
