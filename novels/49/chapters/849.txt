Chapter 850 Vomit Blood From The Anger

Yin Yang Child scanned the surroundings upon hearing that. “Who called me child? Hurry out and receive your death.”

After Yin Yang Child said that, a male with an almost perfect face walked out from the dark slowly. “I hate it the most when people tell me to receive my death, especially little children like you.”

A harmless smile played on Ling Yan’s lips. He first took a look at Ye Qingtang and subsequently fixed his eyes on Yin Yang Child.

“Ling Yan…”

After seeing the male, there was a hint of a ripple in Yin Yang Child’s ever-icy eyes, and his brows were furrowed deeply.

While Ling Yan was utterly useless in terms of martial skill… Yin Yang Child regarded him highly.

“Ling Yan, I don’t wish to see you. Leave. Otherwise, I’ll kill you,” Yin Yang Child said coldly.

However, Ling Yan sat on the ground cross-legged casually as though he did not hear anything and smiled innocently. “Since you don’t wish to see me, you can get lost then.”

“Ling Yan, are you really not afraid of dying?” Yin Yang Child asked with a frown.

“I am afraid of dying but not you.” Ling Yan replied with a smile. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Good. I’ll kill you then.” Yin Yang Child unsheathed his sword immediately and walked towards Ling Yan.

“Yin Yang Little Child, let’s play a game… I believe that you don’t dare to kill me.” Ling Yan saw a murderous look in Yin Yang Child’s eyes but was not at all frightened.

“Oh, I want to know why.” Yin Yang Child looked at Ling Yan and replied without emotions.

“Before I came to this mainland, I stole your father’s precious treasure, the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book, and hid it in a place that only I know of. If you kill me, your father will never find the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book, and you will be beaten by your father then.” Ling Yan replied with a smile.

“What… You stole the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book?!”

As Ling Yan spoke, Yin Yang Child’s expression changed drastically, and he shook his head. “That’s not right. Why do I not know that the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book is missing?”

Ling Yan looked at Yin Yang Child as though he was an idiot. “You mean that I still need to inform you or your father after I stole the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book? If you’re still unaware, it only shows that you all have not realized that the Nine Sons Seized Souls Book is stolen and that you cannot prove that the item is still there, isn’t it?”

Yin Yang Child frowned in thought and did not know whether he should believe him or not.

“It’s better for you to go home, good baby,” Ling Yan said.

“Alright. Since you want to save her, you two must have a good relationship. I will kill her then!” Yin Yang Child pointed at Ye Qingtang and said.

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at Yin Yang Child.

Was this Yin Yang Child’s brain spoiled from the anger? What had this got to do with her!

“What has you killing her got to do with me?” Ling Yan shook his head and said. “This idiot. Why did your father give birth to such a stupid son like you?”

“What did you say!” Anger filled Yin Yang Child’s face.

“There are many reasons for saving a person, and what you said is only one of them. There’s another reason, which is that you’re very unpleasant to my eye. Isn’t it hitting two birds with one stone since I can save her and deride you?” Ling Yan chuckled.

“Alright. I will definitely kill her today. You wish to save her, but I just will not let you fulfill your wish!” Yin Yang Child yelled furiously.

“Don’t repeat yourself already. Quickly kill then,” Ling Yan said. “I’m already very impatient from waiting. However, given your father’s reputation… if I return and say that his son killed someone to snatch a treasure and that someone was even a defenseless lady… don’t you think that your father will vomit blood from the anger?”
