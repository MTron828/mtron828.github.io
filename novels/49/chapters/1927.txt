Chapter 1928: The Return (1)

The reactions of the eight tribe leaders were not exactly positive.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but think that everyone in the Temple of Shadows had probably been celebrating after Ming Di was sealed.

“What is it?” Ye Qingtang suppressed the curiosity in her heart and asked lightly.

The eight tribe leaders were all extremely respectful now, with no intention of testing her again.

“Holy Lord, there has been a lot of activity in the Sacred Ground of Reflection today. We are not sure of the Holy Lord’s intentions and wanted to ask for advice,” the Demon Tribe Leader said cautiously.

The Sacred Ground of Reflection?

Ye Qingtang was stunned for a little while before remembering it.

Ling Yan’s problem had dragged both the Temple of Shadows and the Sacred Ground of Reflection in previously but Ye Qingtang hadn’t paid much attention to it.

After all...

To her, the most important thing to deal with right now was that youth.

“Do you really need me to tell you how to deal with something so small?” Ye Qingtang said as she lifted her eyes lightly.

The eight tribe leaders stood in stunned silence as their expression became awkward.

They had originally wanted to use this to test Ye Qingtang’s identity, but now that Ming Di had been released, what else was left for them to determine?

Seeking guidance on this matter would only show how limited their abilities were.

“We seek your forgiveness, Holy Lord. We are the ones who are weak.”

Ye Qingtang waved her hand dismissively. She had already achieved her goal of alleviating the eight tribe leaders’ suspicions.

Just as Ye Qingtang was thinking about whether Ming Di would be powerful enough, news came from the ancient clans. In the time since they had last seen that youth, he had wiped out a few other ancient clans. They had all been slaughtered when the news had reached the ancient clans, with no trace of the boy left.

The clan leaders were all worried sick when they heard this, afraid that they would be his next target. Those who had been sent out were all finding all sorts of excuses and trying their best to stay in the Temple of Shadows.

This was the first time Ye Qingtang was witnessing the ancient clan’s shamelessness and she was honestly impressed by it.

As more and more ancient clans in the mainland were attacked, the ancient clans who had heard the news had all come running to the Temple of Shadows to hide.

It was not surprising since the Temple of Shadows was the only place the youth had suffered a setback and was their last hope.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched as she saw how many ancient clans were running to them for shelter.

Where was their pride? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Where was the strong foundation that they had built?

Were they not embarrassed by themselves?

Now that they had confirmed her identity, the eight tribe leaders were willing to follow all of Ye Qingtang’s orders. However, their expressions were ugly as they looked at the hoard of ancient clans flocking to the Temple of Shadows.

The ancient clans had already laid down their pride and would not leave no matter how much they were chased away.

Because of all the trouble the youth was causing, the Temple of Shadows was gradually regaining its top position from over ten thousand years ago. It was turning into a symbol of power in the eyes of the people again.

Their attitude was just like when the Second Domain had attacked them over ten thousand years ago. Once again, the ancient clans were looking to the Temple of Shadows to lead them.

The peace that they had was suddenly shattered with the arrival of two people.

Two figures landed outside the Temple of Shadows.

They were two young men of approximately the same age. One of them was the effeminate-looking youth that Ye Qingtang had previously scared off with her Mirror of Illusions. Beside him was a tall and coldly-handsome young man.
