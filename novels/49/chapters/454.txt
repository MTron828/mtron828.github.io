“This girl… How deep and vicious you are!” Yi Tianchou felt torn apart as he watched Ye Qingtang keep the Spirit Life Flower away.

He fought for the Spirit Life Flower with his life, but it was ultimately a dowry for others!

Vicious?

Ye Qingtang could not help but laugh. If it were other girls who were not skilled enough and did not set such a trap for Yi Tianchou, their ending would have been miserably tragic.

“Hah.” Ye Qingtang scoffed coldly. “If I didn’t act like I’m weak and dumb, how could I lead you to snatch the Spirit Life Flower and defeat both you and that Yunxiao Sect disciple?”

Given Ye Qingtang’s cultivation, she was not able to defeat either Yi Tianchou or the Yunxiao Sect disciple who was guarding here. Obtaining the Spirit Life Flower from the Yunxiao Sect disciple was nothing but a pipe dream.

Yi Tianchou came knocking on the door himself and jumped into the hole. He could only be blamed for being innocently foolish.

Now, the Yunxiao Sect disciple was killed by Yi Tianchou while Yi Tianchou was severely injured by the Yunxiao Sect disciple before he died.

As such, Ye Qingtang had absolute control now.

All this while, Yi Tianchou did not think much of her and thus was not on his guard against her, especially when she attacked him earlier on when he was already injured.

Facing someone at the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three who was full of weak points and even heavily injured, Ye Qingtang naturally had no fears.

Everything was in Ye Qingtang’s control. From the very start when Yi Tianchou appeared, he was destined to be a dead man.

Before she had any absolutely powerful martial skills, the brain was also a good asset which even surpassed martial skills at certain times.

“To repay you for helping me to snatch this Spirit Life Flower… I’ve decided to lay you to rest in this mountain valley. What do you think?” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged up. As she spoke, there was a crisp clang, and the Demonic Blood Sword appeared, filling the air with a frightening demonic aura.

“You…”

Sensing Ye Qingtang’s murderous intent, Yi Tianchou was filled with horror.

His combat capability decreased greatly when he was heavily injured by the Yunxiao Sect disciple before he died. Moreover, this girl launched a sneak attack on him earlier. With those injuries, the primordial qi in his body was erratic, and his blood flow was disorderly, causing his entire body to wobble.

Not mentioning about fighting back, he was almost losing the strength to even stand straight!

Puff!

The moment the Demonic Blood Sword was drawn out, the blood-colored sword aura seeped out like a mighty torrent.

Before Yi Tianchou knew what happened, his right arm was already chopped off by the Demonic Blood Sword.

“AHHHH!” Shrill cries escaped Yi Tianchou’s mouth as anger and unwillingness were evident on his face.

He, Yi Tianchou, had trampled around Formidable Heavens Dynasty freely for over a decade, and he had never respected the most skilled and powerful Formidable Heavens Royal. A living legend, he even dared to offend the Yunxiao Sect yet never expected that he would lose his life in the hands of a female disciple of Xuanling Sect!

Yi Tianchou looked at Ye Qingtang as though he wanted to say something.

However, Ye Qingtang did not give Yi Tianchou any chance to speak, and a cold glint shone as she waved the Demonic Blood Sword lightly!

With a “swoosh,” a blood ripple was seen in the midair.

In the next second, Yi Tianchou’s skull was flung into the sky, and large gushes of blood spouted out from his neck area like the spattering of rain which stained the entire ground red.

Yi Tianchou’s head fell somewhere far away and rolled away like a ball, leaving a trace of blood on the ground.

A headless body collapsed on the ground and gradually turned cold.
