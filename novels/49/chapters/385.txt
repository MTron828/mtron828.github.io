Ye Qingtang’s eyes were narrowed as an evil smile played on her lips. She glanced at the four people and clasped on the handle of the sword quietly with her right hand but did not draw it out.

Song Junqiu saw that Ye Qingtang did not draw her sword out and smiled. “I’ve heard that Junior Sister Ye achieved a victory in the inner sect assessment just by the motion of drawing out a sword. It seems I can personally witness it today.”

The motion of drawing a sword required extreme speed and using all of one’s strength in the instant when the sword was unsheathed. The very essence laid in the moment the sword left its sheath.

That day, Ye Qingtang broke Ji Xianyuan’s defense with this move.

However…

There was a look of sarcasm in Song Junqiu’s eyes.

The sword in his hand was not an ordinary sword. Frozen iron was extremely strong, and ordinary weapons would definitely not be able to break it. Even if Ye Qingtang really knew how to use the motion of drawing a sword, there was no way it could break his Glacial Frost Sword!

Then, the four people exchanged a look and attacked almost at the same time. Four sharp swords aimed straight at Ye Qingtang, who was right in the center!

But when the four of them struck, Ye Qingtang did not react in the way one would usually do and instead closed her eyes and lowered her head slightly.

“What is she doing?” The disciples below the ring were shocked to see Ye Qingtang’s actions.

In face of four people striking at the same time, she did not hide or avoid and even displayed such composed posture. Wasn’t she heading for doom!

Ni Shang and Fei Ying were astounded as well. Seeing that the four swords were already right above Ye Qingtang’s head, their hearts raced furiously.

“Miss! Be careful!”

As Ni Shang cried in horror, Ye Qingtang suddenly opened her eyes. Her tiny frame moved slightly, and it was as though she turned into a stagger of countless shadows.

A glint flashed across her waist and became a whirlwind that swept all four sides!

Immediately, clanks rang in the air!

Song Junqiu and the other three disciples could not see Ye Qingtang’s movement at all and could only feel pain in the palm where they held the sword. They instinctively withdrew backward. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

A clattering of swords sounded subsequently.

What appeared before their eyes was…

Three broken swords laid on the wide ring!

“What happened?” The other three disciples were slightly startled, and it was only then they realized that their swords had actually broken. The tip of the swords fell near Ye Qingtang’s legs.

How could this be!

Although their swords were not as impressive as the Glacial Frost Sword in Song Junqiu’s hand, each one of them was priced above ten thousand Xuanming points.

They were clearly hard-earned swords, yet how could they actually be broken just like that!

In the center of the ring, an insolent and evil smile appeared on Ye Qingtang’s exquisite face. She lifted her chin up and glanced at the broken swords in the three disciples’ hands and then at the broken blades near her leg. “Senior brothers, your swords don’t seem to be so good.”

The three disciples’ faces darkened, and they wanted to go forward instinctively, but this movement caused them to realize the piercing pain in their palm. They looked down at their palms and realized…

There was already a deep cut in their purlicue where their swords were held against. Gushes of blood dripped along the handle of the sword and onto the ground.

How could it be?
