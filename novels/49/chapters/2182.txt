Chapter 2183: Medicine Faculty (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Boss!!” Lei Yan stared in shock at Ye Qing, who suddenly popped up behind them.

When did Boss arrive?

Nangong Lie and the rest were also startled by the sight of Ye Qing. They had no idea when he had appeared and whether he heard the cold mockery of those two teenagers.

Having been caught in this independent mission, they couldn’t help shifting their gaze guiltily.

Ye Qingtang gazed at Lei Yan and his gang without any expression.

Having been forcibly dragged over, Jing Ze and Mu Ziying also lowered their heads the moment they saw Ye Qing.

“What are you all doing here?” Ye Qingtang surveyed her surroundings.

The group exchanged looks but none of them dared to answer.

If Boss knew that they had made the independent decision to come here and try to form an alliance with the medicine faculty students, and ended up being sneered at, they would probably be dead-meat.

“Bo... Boss, nothing much. Yun Chen wanted to get something from the medicine faculty and so we came along with him.” Nangong Lie had the quickest mind and he didn’t know how much Ye Qing overheard, so he made up an excuse on the spot.

Would Ye Qing not know what they were actually doing?

Nevertheless...

Inwardly, Ye Qingtang felt like laughing at the sight of those nervous-looking teenagers.

Apart from Mu Ziying, the other teenagers were actually older than Ye Qingtang. She felt rather amused by how fearful they were of her.

If this bunch of brats knew that they were slightly older than her...

Would they still be willing to call her Boss?

“Boss, why are you at the medicine faculty?” Nangong Lie hastily asked. He saw that Ye Qing didn’t respond and thought that they had managed to squirm their way through.

“I want to borrow the use of an alchemy lab,” Ye Qingtang answered.

Everyone was shocked at Ye Qing’s words. The teenagers immediately thought of the only medicine faculty student in their group: Yun Chen.

Ye Qing had made arrangements for all of them except for Yun Chen. They thought that he had forgotten about him.

They didn’t realize that he hadn’t.

Otherwise, he wouldn’t have so quickly come here to help Yun Chen borrow a lab.

Ye Qingtang ignored the curious gazes of those teenagers and looked straight at Yun Chen. “Bring me to the teacher in charge of the alchemy labs.”

Yun Chen glanced at Ye Qing as if he wanted to say something. But in the end, he just nodded in silence and led the way.

Originally Yun Chen wanted to tell Ye Qing that he had his own alchemy lab, albeit the lowest grade one. Nevertheless, he did not have to do all this for him. After all... with his situation, even the best lab would be useless in enhancing the success rate of his medicine cultivation.

But looking at Ye Qing’s serious expression, Yun Chen ended up swallowing his words.

Alchemy labs could be categorized into different grades. The higher the grade, the better one’s medicine cultivation would be. Most students used low-grade student labs. If one had sufficient talent, they could apply to have a mid-grade alchemy lab.

Teachers typically had the use of the rare high-grade alchemy labs. Most students were not allowed to set a single foot inside.

It was rumored that there was a Grand Master-level lab inside the medicine faculty. It was prepared for an Alchemist Grand Master as the Netherworld Academy had once produced an Alchemist Grand Master.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m
