Chapter 926 Trade-Offs (2)

At the entrance of the palace was a huge altar.

Next to the altar were scattered many long-lost Dharma treasures!

“Divine Virtual Pagoda?!”

“Is that the legendary Oracle Bell?!”

Everyone widened their eyes in disbelief. As they looked at legendary lost Dharma treasures, they were almost unable to believe their eyes.

Some even secretly pinched their thighs, trying to prove that what they saw was reality and not something created by the Divine Phoenix’s enchantment skills.

“What is this…”

“Lord Divine Phoenix, this is…”

Black and White Holy Son asked the scarlet figure in the void.

“All this is part of the inheritance,” the Divine Phoenix said slowly.

The Divine Phoenix’s words immediately stunned everyone.

Every item present was extremely valuable. They would be content to obtain any one of them.

“As everyone can see,” the Divine Phoenix said, “the fourth stage involves gains and losses.”

“Gains and losses?”

Absolute Monarch of Heaven pondered this for a moment but still did not understand the meaning behind the Divine Phoenix’s words.

“That’s right,” the Divine Phoenix said. “Loss means to lose the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. Gain means to gain these Dharma treasures. Every trial-taker is free to equally share out all the treasure here. But the price of this is the loss of the true inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.”

Il This…”

Everyone present was stunned. They had not expected the fourth stage to be like this.

“Similarly, if anyone persists in obtaining the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, then… they are not destined to have these Dharma treasures. However, ultimately, only one person who can obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.”

“That is also to say, even if we give up these Dharma treasures, we may not obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix…” one of the cultivators said with a frown.

“That’s right.” The Divine Phoenix looked at the cultivator who had spoken. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

For a moment, everyone was in a dilemma and did not know what to do.

Of course, they were aware of the incredible value of the Dharma treasures before them. If they missed this opportunity, they might never be destined to encounter them again.

However, their goal in coming here was the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.

This trade-off truly vexed everyone.

Both outcomes were greatly alluring.

Just as everyone was pondering the matter, a figure was the first to emerge from the group.

Ye Qingtang lifted her eyes and saw that the figure who had gone forward was Absolute Monarch of Heaven.

Absolute Monarch of Heaven’s expression was completely natural. He walked straight towards the golden Divine Virtual Pagoda.

As everyone watched, Absolute Monarch of Heaven decisively took the Divine Virtual Pagoda.

“My thanks to Lord Divine Phoenix.” Absolute Monarch of Heaven placed the Divine Virtual Pagoda in his space ring, then cupped his fist, and looked at the Divine Phoenix.

“If you choose this Dharma treasure, it is equivalent to giving up your rights to be the successor of the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix,” the Divine Phoenix said.

Absolute Monarch of Heaven was expressionless when he heard that. He nodded slightly and said, “It’s alright. To me, the value of the Divine Virtual Pagoda is sufficient.”

“That’s right, legend has it that the Divine Virtual Pagoda contains a very unusual space. If a cultivator enters the Divine Virtual Pagoda to cultivate, he will achieve twice the results with half the effort. It is as if a day within the pagoda is equivalent to just an hour in the external world!”

“Just think, even if the value of the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix is greater, only one person can be so lucky…. if we give up the treasures here and fail to obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, won’t we wish we had died?” When he finished speaking, one of the cultivators immediately went forward and chose one of the Dharma treasures.

“Herb of Heavenly Life!”
