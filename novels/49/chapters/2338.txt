Chapter 2339: Doubt (2)

Di Nuo found Zhu Ning’s tone rather strange.

“I think so, but… some time ago, Ye Qing brought Yun Chen and the others out for a period of time. I don’t know if anyone else intervened during that period…”

Zhu Ning took a deep breath. “Teacher Di Nuo, do you know what technique Yun Chen used to refine his elixir?”

Di Nuo shook his head.

“He used a palm flame,” Zhu Ning said.

The confused expression on Di Nuo’s face showed that he had not heard of it before.

Zhu Ning continued. “Teacher Di Nuo, you should know that the palm flame is a technique which all alchemists dream of. Even my most accomplished disciple, he spent many years and made use of countless connections to try and find it, but to no avail.”

Di Nuo’s face stiffened.

The disciple mentioned by Zhu Ning was naturally that Grand Master alchemist.

How high was his status in the Second Domain? How many great factions wished to get on his good side?

Something which even he could not get… It must be priceless.

“Teacher Di Nuo, how much do you know about Ye Qing? Does he have any special talent regarding elixirs?”

The palm flame was extremely precious. Zhu Ning had to clarify things properly.

A conflicted glint flashed across Di Nuo’s eyes. He knew Zhu Ning very well.

Zhu Ning was obsessed with alchemy and maintained his status and reputation up until now as one whose obsession with elixir-refinement was more intense and crazed than any normal person. As a result, he would detest a person like Ye Qing to the core. Someone whom he believed treated alchemy like a hobby.

All of Zhu Ning’s likes and dislikes were linked to alchemy.

Di Nuo mulled over this for a while before continuing. “I don’t know much about alchemy and I have not heard any news about Ye Qing having any special elixir-refinement skills. More over… the palm flame is so rare and precious. If Ye Qing really is that capable, why would he apply to be a teacher in the martial arts faculty? With that palm flame technique alone, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to join the medicine faculty, right?”

Zhu Ning frowned at Di Nuo’s words.

Things were just as Di Nuo had said.

If someone came to apply to be a medicine faculty teacher with that palm flame technique, no medicine faculty in the entire world would reject him. In fact, there was a higher likelihood that they would fight over him.

“If not Ye Qing, perhaps he found someone when they were outside?” Di Nuo asked.

He could not let Ye Qing win this bet.

How could he believe that Ye Qing was really that good?

Di Nuo had nearly vomited blood at the results of yesterday’s martial arts selection trials. He just could not understand how a Paragon Sixth Heaven level person managed to produce five Divine Lord stage students.

And Zhu Ning’s query offered Di Nuo an alternative theory that was much more plausible.

Even if he was a martial arts genius, how old was he? How could he possibly also be good at alchemy? Not only that, he somehow managed to find the long-lost palm flame?

This was not something a person as young as Ye Qing could achieve!

Unless he sought out some high-level practitioner from the outside. Otherwise, how else could one explain the rapid advancement of Qin Feng and the rest over just a short few months? Even if Wu Fengling personally mentored them, he wouldn’t be able to produce such results.

Moreover, it was not just martial arts. Even Yun Chen’s elixir was better than Song Yanhan’s. This was just ridiculous. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Could a youth in his 20s be even more formidable than two highly-respected elders like Wu Fengling and Zhu Ning?

Preposterous!
