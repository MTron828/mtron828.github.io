Chapter 2118: Sea Soul Chess (3)

“Sea Soul Chess!” The North Darkness Pavilion Master uttered in shock when he saw the mysterious chessboard.

“North Darkness Pavilion Master, what is that?”

The North Darkness Pavilion Master’s eyes were still filled with admiration but he said slowly, “Legend has said that the Sea Soul Chess Board was created by a god and contains everything in the world. No one has ever seen it before and I’ve only seen it in a tattered book before...”

“I heard that to play Sea Soul Chess, one not only has to have great skills at chess but also enough power to control the entire game.”

“But there are no pieces on the board,” another master said.

“The Sea Soul Chess is a collection of many souls and is a legend. I’ve only seen it illustrated once only and have never seen the real thing, so I’m not sure,” the North Darkness Pavilion Master said with a sigh.

The Sea Soul Chess Board was a divine item and had faded into the stuff of legends when the god had vanished. He had not expected to see the real thing at the Paragon Holy Lord’s birthday celebration.

He hadn’t made this trip in vain after all.

Apart from the North Darkness Pavilion Master, many other people recognized the Sea Soul Chess Board as well, and their expressions mirrored his.

The Sea King was probably the only person within the two domains who would dare to take it out. Anyone was lucky to have witnessed this.

However...

Everyone was wondering why the Sea King was giving such a precious item to someone else.

This was too generous of him!

But the Fox Demon’s eyes flashed and he frowned slightly when he saw the Sea Soul Chess Board. He hadn’t expected the Sea King to make such a move!

Ye Qingtang had never seen or heard of the Sea Soul Chess Board before but she could tell that it was important from everyone else’s reactions.

Regardless...

She didn’t know much about the relationship between the Sea King and the Paragon Holy Lord. Was their relationship this good?

She remained still. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Gazing at the Sea Soul Chess Board, a look of belligerence flashed past his face and he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“All those years ago, you and I played this in the sea and I lost by just one move, so I had to give you a divine item from the Sea Clan as per our agreement. Do you remember?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“I destroyed that board in anger. For the past few years, I’ve sent thousands of Sea Clan members off to find a second set, and was lucky to finally find one a year ago.”

With that, he suddenly raised his hand and swept it gently across the chessboard. Beautiful crystal chess pieces appeared on the empty board.

There were 36 pieces each on both sides. Each piece was unique and modeled after ancient creatures, and was extremely life-like.

But as his arm came down, the chess pieces shifted into different positions on the board, making it look like a half-played game.

“That year, you trapped me with a certain move. I agonized over it for many years before I finally found a way out of it. I brought this set today to ask if you have any interest in finishing this match with me?” The Sea King raised his eyes, which were filled with provocation.
