Chapter 2285: Moving Up (6)

Ye Qingtang surveyed the teenagers who were still immersed in their cultivation. Astonishment flashed across her eyes.

Lei Yan and the others had already spent more than a month training in the Evil Soul Forest. Everyone’s powers had increased significantly.

Even the weakest of them had already reached the Paragon Eighth Heaven level.

And now, after cultivating in this secret room for over a month…

Lei Yan and the rest had all surged up to the Divine Lord stage!

Ye Qingtang was shocked by this development.

It should be pointed out that although the Divine Lord stage was the next major stage after Paragon, it was very difficult to ascend from one stage to the next.

Many people ended up stuck at the Paragon Ninth Heaven level forever, unable to progress any further.

But now…

Ye Qingtang had brought six students up to the Divine Lord stage in one hit. She hadn’t expected this at all.

Even in a high-level academy like the Netherworld Academy, students at the Divine Lord stage would be considered elite in status.

But Lei Yan and the others had just ascended the Divine Lord stage. They would need a period of time to stabilize their powers before they could become true Divine Lord stage practitioners.

Even so…

It was still astounding.

Amongst them, Qin Feng’s progress was the most apparent. Previously, he was already a prodigy who had been just one step away from ascending to the Divine Lord stage. It was only because of his mental demons that his powers started to decline.

Now that his mental demons had been dispelled, his powers were improving at a rapid pace. Currently, he was already at the peak Divine Lord First Heaven level. Just a little more and he would be able to reach the Second Heaven level.

It should be pointed out that at the Divine Lord stages and above, the disparity between the different Heaven levels was immense.

Lei Yan and the others might also be at the Divine Lord First Heaven level, but the gap between an early-stage and a peak First Heaven level was very wide. Qin Feng alone could annihilate Lei Yan and the other five without too much effort.

This result was better than Ye Qingtang’s expectations.

But she noticed that the rate of progress was different amongst the teenagers. Perhaps it was related to their individual innate potential, or perhaps different people could absorb different amounts of energy from the array formation.

Nonetheless, the result had still far surpassed Ye Qingtang’s expectations.

She woke the teenagers up from their cultivation.

Having been woken up by Ye Qingtang in the middle of their cultivation, they were all still bleary-eyed. They felt like they had been suddenly pulled out of a limitless world. Everyone was still in a daze.

Ye Qingtang was in no hurry. She patiently waited for them to recover their senses.

Lei Yan shook his head and recovered some of his clarity. He then widened his eyes in shock.

“Damn! I’m at the Divine Lord stage already?!!”

His shout immediately snapped the rest out of their trance.

After recovering their senses, they soon realized that they had all ascended to the long-desired Divine Lord stage!

What the heck?!

They exchanged looks, feeling very surreal.

If they hadn’t come to this secret room, even if they gained enlightenment and cultivated extra hard, apart from Qin Feng, the others would need at least five years to ascend to the Divine Lord stage. But…

How long had they been cultivating?

They were now at the Divine Lord stage?

“Bo… Boss… don’t tell me that we… have been cultivating here for more than five years…” Jing Ze widened his eyes in a daze, staring at his hands.

This feeling… he really suspected that he was dreaming.

“No… no way! Did we really cultivate for that long?” Nangong Lie swallowed hard. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Feeling the surge of powerful energy in his body, even the usually calm Yun Chen was feeling rather shaken.
