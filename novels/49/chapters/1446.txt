Chapter 1447 Protecting One“s Child 1

Ye Xun opened her mouth to explain, but Ye Qingtang continued. “If Third Uncle does not believe me, he can send someone to look in the yard outside my room. We just left. I believe the footprints can still be seen clearly.”

Ye Xun wanted to accuse Ye Qingtang of lying, but Ye Qingtang’s words prevented her from making his plea.

Ye Xun’s expression was extremely ugly.

Jiang Yiming could see that things were not going well. He was about to ask a companion to go and secretly tamper with the evidence, but Mo Yi noticed. She nodded slightly, and the serving women with the demon fox masks, who were standing behind her, immediately arose and caught hold of the youth who was planning to sneak away and destroy the evidence.

“Third Brother, hadn’t you better send someone to take a look?” Mo Yi said with a soft laugh.

Jiang Liu’s expression darkened. He had no choice but to send someone to investigate.

Just as Ye Qingtang had said, Jiang Yiming and the others had left hurriedly, thinking only of capturing Ye Qingtang. As a result, they had left a large patch of messy footprints in the yard, outside Ye Qingtang’s door.

And they ascertained that these footprints belonged to Jiang Yiming and the others.

This proved that the excuse of meeting her on the way was false.

Jiang Yiming and the others’ expressions grew ugly.

“It’s true we were looking for Younger Sister You’er, but we recalled that the flowers in the west garden flower beds were blooming nicely, so we went to pick some to give to her. That’s all.” Jiang Yiming had a quick mind and found an excuse.

“That’s right. We didn’t say we met her on a direct route there.” Another youth came forward to corroborate.

But at that moment, Jiang Liu and the others looked even grimmer.

“The flowerbeds were moved from the west garden to the east garden long ago,” Jiang Liu said frostily.

Jiang Yiming was startled. Only then did he recall this, and his expression grew ugly. The other youths turned pale.

Their clumsy excuses had been exposed. Now, their reason for appearing outside Ye Qingtang’s room grew increasingly evident.

A group of people like that had run over to Ye Qingtang’s room en masse, and blows were exchanged. Anyone could see that they had been targeting Ye Qingtang and that it was no coincidence.

Jiang Yiming gritted his teeth. “We heard that someone new has arrived in the Jiang house, so what’s wrong with going over to take a look? You clearly injured someone. The injuries on my body are proof.”

Elder Meng, who was standing nearby, nodded. “No matter how you encountered each other, Yiming was definitely injured by you. This cannot be faked.”

She had seen shameless people before but not someone as shameless as this.Jiang Yiming and the others said that she had deliberately provoked them and created trouble. Now, it had been proven that they were the first to provoke her, but they changed the pretext to this.

“Elder Meng, why don’t you ask how I injured him?” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly.

Elder Meng frowned slightly.

Ye Qingtang continued. “So many of them came looking for me. How capable do you think I am that I can injure someone in the Heavenly Venerate realm in front of a bunch of people in the Arcane Supremacy realm? Or perhaps…”

Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept over everyone present. “They are really blind?”

Elder Meng’s face grew grimmer. There was something strange about all this, but he had chosen to overlook it.

“We did not expect you to suddenly attack. That’s why you managed to succeed.” Jiang Yiming immediately spoke up. Since there was no proof, Ye Qingtang would be unable to disclaim responsibility.
