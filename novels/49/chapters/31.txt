Chapter 32: Fire Venom (2)

Si Ye’s grim expression turned to wariness once he knew Ye Qingtang’s identity.

“Si Bai, when did you get acquainted with them?” Si Ye’s tone of voice became forbidding as well.

Being the eldest amongst the brothers, he had certainly experienced the grief of their mother’s unnatural death and despised the Ye household, rumored to be the perpetrators.

“We don’t welcome members of the Ye household.” Si Ye asserted.

Si Bai was just about to make an explanation when Old Master Si interrupted: “Si Ye, don’t be rude. She’s our guest, here to provide treatment for Si Bai.”

Si Ye was stunned for a moment before he looked once more, at Ye Qingtang’s petite figure.

“Providing treatment? At her age?”

Old Master Si furrowed his brows. In fact, he still finds it hard to believe she was indeed capable of providing treatment for Si Bai.

“Don’t bother yourself with that. We had more pressing matters at hand.” With that said, Old Master Si turned his attention towards Ye Qingtang. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Miss Ye, you were saying, you know how to suppress that Fire Venom?”

Si Ye grimaced at Old Master Si’s attitude. He could not stomach the fact that his grandfather, who had despised the Ye household all along, would allow one of their ladies to provide treatment for Si Bai, granting her free access to their premises.

Ye Qingtang gave a nod and reiterated: “Yes. One of the things I’ve brought today happens to come in handy.”

“Are you referring to those Ifrit’s scales?” Si Bai caught onto her words quickly when he was reminded of her purchases from the Pavilion of Treasures.

“Yup.” Ye Qingtang confirmed his conjecture.

Everyone from the Si household had a weird look on their faces once she made that claim.

Si Ye frowned deeply whilst he tried his best to curb his displeasure: “Miss Ye, I’ve no idea how you’ve managed to convince my grandfather into allowing you to provide treatment. But, if you’re thinking of suppressing the venom with an Ifrit’s scales, I’m afraid anyone would know that’s impossible.”

Though Ifrit’s scales did possess a high degree of fire resistance, but unless the scales could be ground as an additive for medications, they would be meaningless against the Fire Venom which ran rampant within a victim’s body.

Moreover, hardly anyone could lay a scratch on the scales, which stood as a testament to its almost indestructible composition. Therefore, grinding them to powder would be nigh impossible.

Si Ye’s statement, more or less, represented everyone’s thoughts. Even Old Master Si had a look of skepticism at the moment.

Ye Qingtang watched their reactions and giggled to herself.

“Since there’s no other way, why not give it a try?”

Si Ye knitted his brows as he could not refute her words.

Old Master Si drew a deep breath before he conveyed his decision: “We’ll let Miss Ye give it a go.”

“Grandpa! Are you sure that’s wise?” Si Ye clearly voiced his objection.

“Bro, Miss Ye’s right. Other than that Flame Suppressant pill, there’s no other way. We should try out any possible alternatives, for Si Qiong’s sake.” Si Bai tried to persuade him as well.

Si Ye’s countenance clouded over as he gave Ye Qingtang a perplexed and imposing look.

“Miss Ye, it’s up to you now.” Old Master Si declared in a heavy tone.

Ye Qingtang nodded with conviction, “I’d appreciate if I can get a private room, for my preparations.”

“Sure.” Old Master Si agreed to her request without any hesitation, and a room was ready for her in a jiffy.

Ye Qingtang locked herself in the room as she began her preparations.

Si Ye and Si Bai stood watch outside the room. While Si Ye peered at the tightly shut doors, with his brows remaining knitted throughout, he voiced his dissent: “This is all too ridiculous.”
