Chapter 1700: Top Ten (1)

In all of his wildest dreams, Elder Qian had never expected that Ye Qingtang would win the challenge. Somehow, she had managed to secure a spot on the top ten!

The Jiang family had the initial goal of having two members enter the top ten. Only then could they recover the humiliation of losing in the previous few Martial Arts Championships. Jiang Yanyun’s defeat had completely destroyed the elders’ hopes. But Ye Qingtang had surpassed all expectations and entered the top ten.

“Elder Qian, it was a good decision to hand Ye Qingtang over to you. She has become so outstanding with your guidance.” The other Jiang family elders all turned to congratulate Elder Qian. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It was the Domain Monarch Founder who had brought Ye Qingtang to Taiyuan Valley. But after the Domain Monarch Founder left, the elders in the valley were all reluctant to mentor this mediocre teenage girl who hadn’t started training from a young age.

Like that, Elder Qian had been given the impossible task of mentoring Ye Qingtang. Her current victory was exceptionally shocking to everyone.

Words of gratitude spewed out from the other elders, but Elder Qian felt rather ashamed. “I had nothing to do with her current abilities, she attained them all by herself. I just taught her some basics, that’s all.”

“Elder Qian is too modest.”

Elder Qian shook his head with a rueful smile. It was true that he had been neutral toward the task of mentoring Ye Qingtang. He didn’t completely neglect her, but he also didn’t go out of his way to guide her. He never expected her to perform so well and end up boosting his own name too.

Up in her searing area, Mu Ruxue was dumbstruck as she stared at the bloodied Baili Xuanyun. She remained in a trance for a long time.

Never had she imagined that things would end up in this way...

Baili Xuanyun had lost?

Impossible!

Mu Ruxue was not the only one in shock. Those who had never noticed Ye Qingtang before now realized that the Jiang family had been hiding such a talented and powerful young lady. She could defeat an opponent of a higher level than her!

After Ye Qingtang descended from the arena, Jiang Yisheng was all smiles as he rushed toward her.

“Qingtang, how naughty of you! You’ve been concealing your vast powers from us.”

Ye Qingtang didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as she stared at Jiang Yisheng. She had never tried to conceal anything. She just didn’t like to show off.

Nearby, Jiang Yiran was also smiling at Ye Qingtang. But he was mindful of Jiang Yanyun’s earlier defeat, and kept his elation to a minimum.

“Brother Yun, shall I help you back to rest?” Jiang Yiran asked Jiang Yanyun.

At this point, Jiang Yiran’s inner mind was in turmoil.

He thought Brother Yun was already the most powerful Jiang family member from the current generation. But he had lost to Baili Xuanyun. Meanwhile, the overlooked Ye Qingtang had killed Baili Xuanyun in such a manner...

In that case...

Didn’t that mean this little girl was even more powerful than Brother Yun?

Jiang Yiran felt increasingly shocked as he pondered the situation. Although he was happy for Ye Qingtang, he was also worried about Jiang Yanyun being upset.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yanyun didn’t say anything. He just left to receive treatment for his injuries.

The elimination battles soon progressed to the final stages, with four fighters emerging victorious.

Amongst these four, two were from the Qiu family. The well-known Qiu Chen and a teenage girl Qiu Ci, had exceeded everyone’s expectations to enter the top ten. Before the results of the elimination round, no one had even noticed her presence.
