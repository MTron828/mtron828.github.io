Chapter 1909: Paragon Level (3)

Ye Qingtang’s space ring was now a little treasure trove. If anyone from the other clans were to take a peek at it, they would definitely be shocked at all the precious artifacts inside.

Having gone up yet another level and obtained so many goodies—Ye Qingtang was in a wonderful mood... To the point that she remained grinning even when her room was filled with those blood-drenched Skull Flowers the next day.

However, she still nearly puked at the smell of those Black Flame Worms.

Perhaps it was the result of a good night’s rest, Jiang Shaobai appeared much calmer the next morning. He didn’t hide behind Ye Qingtang the whole time like when they first arrived at the temple. Instead, he sat by the window in a daze.

Ye Qingtang sighed inwardly. She would just have to wait for Ming Wang to report on his investigative efforts.

Luckily Ming Wang didn’t let Ye Qingtang wait too long. He reported back to Ye Qingtang after just a few days.

“Holy Lord, something did happen to the ancient clans from the mainland recently.” Ming Wang reported.

Ye Qingtang’s heart quivered but she maintained her calm facade. “Oh? Tell me about it.”

“Recently, several Central Mainland clans were attacked, including the Nanlin Clan, the Jiang Clan, the Ouyang Clan...” Ming Wang reported with an impassive expression.

According to the investigative efforts of the Temple of Shadows, several ancient clans in Central Mainland suffered major attacks during the recent period. The attacks were devastating and the clans were nearly wiped out.

The Nanlin clan suffered the worst. Every single member of the clan was dead, with their bodies strewn across the family compound.

The Jiang Clan endured a similar fate. The Taiyuan Valley, which was used to cultivate the best of the clan, had been utterly destroyed. The main family residence had also been attacked and suffered numerous fatalities. The whereabouts of the Domain Monarch and key family members were unknown. No one knew if they were dead or alive...

Ye Qingtang’s heart pounded heavily as she heard about the Jiang family. Her heart was nearly leaping out of her throat.

Luckily, Ming Wang reported that they hadn’t discovered the bodies of the Domain Monarch, Jiang Lang, and his wife. It seemed like they might have fled before the enemy attacked.

“Did you find out who the attacker was?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The various ancient clans in the mainland were all powerful forces to be reckoned with. What kind of person or power was able to decimate those clans in such a short period of time?

Ming Wang shook his head.

“Most of the victims have died, and the whereabouts of the remaining Jiang family members are unknown. As a result, we were unable to find out. The attacker’s methods are rather swift and precise. He didn’t leave behind any clues...

“We brought back the body of one of the Nanlin Clan members. The person died in a wretched state and his injuries were very strange. We could not tell what kind of skill was used on the body.”

Due to the fight over the Eternal Dynasty crown, trouble continued to brew at the Sacred Ground of Reflection. As a result, Ming Wang had been concentrating his efforts on the Sacred Ground of Reflection. He didn’t notice anything happening with the other ancient clans. If not for Ye Qingtang’s instructions, he would never have thought to investigate the matter.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. It looked like they had once again reached a dead end regarding the Jiang family massacre. The only piece of good news was that they did not confirm the deaths of Jiang Lang and his wife.

Even so, Ye Qingtang was full of doubts and queries.

Who was behind it all?

The balance between the major ancient clans in First Mainland had been maintained for so many years.

Who would suddenly slaughter so many clans at a time like this? And what were their intentions?
