“Being alert around her will only result in her raising her guards against us, and we will not be able to find out any suspicious things about her. However, if she relaxes a little, she will definitely give something away.”

Lady Ghost immediately understood Ming Wang’s intentions after hearing what he said.

“You are wise.”

“You may leave,” Ming Wang said.

Lady Ghost disappeared into the darkness subsequently.

Once there was no one in the room, Ming Wang stood up slowly and opened a secret compartment. In it was a lifelike portrait of a half-skeleton, half-human figure who was none other than the Holy Lord of Shadows.

“Ah Yao…” Looking at that portrait that he had kept for a long time, he frowned in misery.

Ye Qingtang enjoyed a rare idle in the Temple of Shadows in the next two days.

She was extremely thankful for the current rarity of the Black Flame Worm. Otherwise, given Ming Gu’s character, he would send some over daily.

She never wanted to touch that thing for the second time in this life.

Perhaps it was her misperception, but she felt that Ming Gu was in high spirits these two days.

But before she figured out why Ming Gu was suddenly in such a good mood, she received a shocking piece of news.

“Eternal Dynasty?” Ye Qingtang was seated on the Black Bone Throne as she put on a reserved front that concealed her internal surprise.

“The cooperation with the Eternal Dynasty back then was your intention. Although you disappeared for thousands of years, the cooperation is still continuing to date. However, something happened at Eternal Dynasty’s side presently; thus, we can only request you to take a look there,” Ming Wang said expressionlessly, though his black orbs observed Ye Qingtang’s each and every movement.

Ye Qingtang’s face was emotionless, but she was overwhelmed with a mix of emotions on the inside.

Eternal Dynasty?

Wasn’t that Ling Yan’s territory?!

Go!

She would definitely go!

“What happened?” While Ye Qingtang really wished to leave this hell of a Temple of Shadows immediately, she still had to feign a calm front.

“It is still unclear. Thus, we need you to go there to take a look.” Ming Wang answered flawlessly.

“Ming Gu and Lady Ghost will go on this trip with you. They will bring you to meet with Eternal Dynasty’s Third Prince, Ling Yan/” Ming Wang added.

Bring her to meet Ling Yan?

Ye Qingtang was excited, but she faintly felt that things were not that simple.

Although the Temple of Shadows did not test her further over the past few days, she was very clear that they would not believe her identity so easily.

Logically speaking, the test would not stop.

However, Ming Wang suddenly wanted her to go to the Eternal Dynasty and interact with Ling Yan…

Ye Qingtang was not a fool, and she could easily guess Ming Wang’s intentions after deliberating about it carefully.

Most likely…

Ming Wang wished to use the highly intelligent Ling Yan to test her identity…

Ye Qingtang really wanted to applaud Ming Wang’s wit.

Good job! Holy Son Ming Wang!

“I got it. When do we set off?” Ye Qingtang asked while keeping her composure.

“The preparations are all made. You may set off anytime.” Ming Wang replied.

There were indeed preparations from the start. It was no wonder Ming Gu was so spirited these few days.

Ye Qingtang kept a faint smile on her face, though she was extremely elated that she was about to leave the Temple of Shadows.

Once she headed to the Eternal Dynasty, with Ling Yan on her side, perhaps she could find the chance to escape the damn Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang was on cloud nine just at the thought of it.

Very quickly, Ye Qingtang, Ming Gu, and Lady Ghost, along with a group of Undead Clan, set off for the Eternal Dynasty. Naturally, Ye Qingtang brought the little white tiger along with her as well.
