1204 Blood Battle 6

She could still remember that it contained the Blood Moon Elder’s favorite alcohol.

The Blood Moon Elder had asked Ye Qingtang to drink together a few times. However, Ye Qingtang did not agree as she was not a drinker.

She opened the bottle and turned her wrist down to pour the alcohol onto the floor.

One glass to the immortal soul.

One glass to the smile that she could still remember.

“Friend… rest… in peace…”

Ye Qingtang’s face was pale, and a mouthful of blood spurted from her mouth.

Ye Qingtang then poured the alcohol into her mouth.

She could feel that the familiar figure of the Blood Moon Elder also raised his glass and smiled. He clinked his glass with her and drank everything at one shot.

One glass to the soil. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

One glass to us.

Farewell, my friend.

The alcohol was poured into her throat. She put the gourd in her pocket and stared at the increasing number of people from the Ancient You Clan. She stood at the spot like an icy mountain.

Screams and wails were heard constantly in the valley. Perfected Xuanchen had lost one of his arms. His whole body was covered by blood. He pierced the sword into the ground with his left hand. Though he had used all his strength, he was not willing to give up.

Everyone had used all their strength in the battle, but they all failed.

Though many people of the Ancient You Clan died as well and only a small number of people still remained, their main source of power was still alive.

You Tong stared at Ye Qingtang and said, “I did not expect that you would be so stubborn…”

You Tong thought that it would be easy to win the war in the South. However, there was no sign of ending the war even though the headquarters were taken down long ago. The resistance and stubbornness of the team were getting stronger, and that exceeded the Ancient You Clan’s imagination.

Though the people of the Southern mainland lost greatly, the Ancient You Clan’s victory was built on many lives sacrificed.

Swoosh!

Ye Qingtang scanned through the figures of the Ancient You Clan. She turned into a black flame, and the aura of destruction spread throughout the area.

You Tong frowned slightly. As he moved his eyes, the indescribable aura of the Heavenly Venerate surrounded the black flame.

After being suppressed by the aura of the Heavenly Venerate, the black flame faded gradually and turned back into Ye Qingtang’s original self.

Though Ye Qingtang’s martial ability was at the same level as General You Tong on this piece of land, their sources of energy were totally different. One was the power of the primordial qi, but the other was the power of a Heavenly Venerate. The difference was huge.

“Hehe… General of Heaven city. You and your army are stubborn and more powerful than I had thought… However, you have no chance of survival when your enemy is me.” You Tong looked at Ye Qingtang, and his lips curved upwards slightly. His eyes turned into a green color and rotated at an even higher speed.

A cold glint flashed across her eyes as if she was about to sacrifice everything to fight against the Ancient You Clan.

However, the sky and the ground seemed to turn upside down at the instant without any sign. There was no Heaven city, no war zone or the valley.

What Ye Qingtang was seeing now was a sea of flame. The burning magma concentrated towards her and was about to engulf her.

“Illusion?!”

Ye Qingtang frowned heavily. She could see through the illusion based on her experience. The fire was an illusion created by You Tong’s power of the Heavenly Venerate.

“This is bad!”

Ye Qingtang condensed the primordial qi in her body to the limit, and countless black flames appeared beside her body. The flames then rushed into the sky, trying to break the world of illusions created by You Tong.
