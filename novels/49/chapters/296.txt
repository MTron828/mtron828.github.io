Chapter 297: Xuanming Pavilion (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After leaving the Elders’ Hall, Ye Qingtang had a plan for the future.

Although over forty thousand Xuanming points were spent, her heart did not ache. She made a plan for the inner sect assessment happening half a month later.

There were still over five thousand Xuanming points, and perhaps, it was enough for her to choose some weapons she liked in the Xuanming Pavilion.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang could not help but recall the sword that the young Wind Moon Sect disciple dropped. Although she only used it for a while, the feel of it really amazed her. If she could obtain a similar weapon, she would have a higher chance of passing the upcoming inner sect assessment.

After making up her mind, Ye Qingtang headed to the Xuanming Pavilion straight away.

There were countless rare and valuable items in the Xuanming Pavilion. Anything one could think of could be obtained in this pavilion, and as long as one had enough Xuanming points to pay, they could acquire the items they liked.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang never went to the Xuanming Pavilion. Most of the Xuanming points that she accumulated with great difficulty were used to exchange for Xi Spirit Pills, and she did not have any extra Xuanming points to spend in the Xuanming Pavilion.

There were quite a few disciples in the Xuanming Pavilion at that time, and everyone was searching for a treasure they were attracted to.

The moment Ye Qingtang entered the Xuanming Pavilion, she saw a familiar figure.

“Junior Sister Ye.” Dai Changming was in the pavilion with a handsome youth and came up to greet Ye Qingtang when he suddenly saw her walking in.

“Senior Brother Dai.” Ye Qingtang nodded as she took a casual glance at the youth beside Dai Changming.

The youth had thick eyebrows and beautiful eyes. He was extremely good-looking and had a remarkable disposition. While he was standing aside silently, his extraordinary charisma was unable to be concealed.

Ji Xianyuan?

Ye Qingtang raised a brow slightly. The man beside Dai Changming was called Ji Xianyuan. When Ye Qingtang entered Xuanling Sect in her previous lifetime, Ji Xianyuan was already an inner sect disciple. Moreover, he had superb endowments and was thought highly of by the elders.

“Are you here to exchange for treasures as well? What a coincidence, I’m here today with Senior Brother Ji to collect a spirit animal,” Dai Changming said with a smile. Because of the Deer City incident previously, Dai Changming felt a sense of gratitude towards Ye Qingtang.

Ji Xianyuan, from aside, scanned Ye Qingtang without any emotions.

The Xuanming Pavilion was divided into nine areas, and the items that could be exchanged in each area were different. Some areas had spirit pills and miraculous herbs while others had rare treasures and spirit animals. Divine weapons were all the more in great quantities, and even some mystic techniques scriptures could be found here. However, it was just that the number of Xuanming points required was huge, and there were few outer sect disciples who had the ability to exchange for these treasures.

The sight could not help but pique the curiosity of other disciples in the pavilion.

Dai Changming was the tenth elite disciple on the ranking charts, while Ji Xianyuan, whom everyone knew, was ranked first in the outer sect and topped the ranking chart. These two people could be said to have a certain influence in the outer sect, and they rarely interacted with other disciples.

Yet, unexpectedly…

One of them actually initiated a conversation with this young new disciple today. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“It is a coincidence indeed.” Ye Qingtang chuckled.

As they were speaking, the warden of Xuanming Pavilion walked over with a huge metal cage being pushed out by two workers behind him. Once everyone saw that metal cage, gasps erupted.
