“Young Master Yun, how is one able to walk on the Path to Heaven?” Lu Xiuwen took a deep breath and suddenly asked Yun Shu.

It was absolutely impossible for him to ask Ye Qingtang.

Yun Shu flashed a faint smile as he turned around kindly and replied, “A heart like still water, with calmness and patience.”

Yun Shu’s words surprised Lu Xiuwen.

Calmness and patience? A heart like still water?

Lu Xiuwen took another look at the Path to Heaven and stepped on it after making slight adjustments.

This time, he put down all the restlessness in his heart, and the lotus under his feet never disappeared.

With a calm mind, Lu Xiuwen immediately chased up.

While Ye Qingtang’s speed was faster than everyone else, she still heard the conversation between Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu previously. She paused for a while and looked at Lu Xiuwen, who was already walking up the Path to Heaven under Yun Shu’s directions, and a faint smile played on her lips.

Senior Brother Yun was still so kind-hearted as in her previous life.

The Path to Heaven was the first segment of the sect assessment, and only people with a heart as calm as still water would be able to have a lotus with every step and step on the clouds. Any distracted person would definitely fall. Moreover, the Path to Heaven was extremely long, and one would still fall if they were slightly doubtful halfway through.

In the previous years, many fell from a great height and died while walking on the Path to Heaven.

Ye Qingtang knew that with Yun Shu’s character, he would definitely be able to guess the secret behind the path. Rather, it was Lu Xiuwen who got a bargain; she did not mind to let Lu Xiuwen fall a few more times.

After stopping for a while, Ye Qingtang continued heading forward.

With Yun Shu’s directions, many started to adjust their mentality, and the people on the Path to Heaven increased gradually. Nonetheless, there were also overly-anxious people who could not step on it no matter how.

This was an assessment.

Filter good-for-nothings away and only those who remained had the qualifications to proceed.

Even if you came from a prestigious family, it was merely a fleeting cloud before sects.

Candidates were already on the Path to Heaven, and most of the people who accompanied the candidates were aware that those who could not step on the path were either too weak in the mind or trying to fake their way through.

The Path to Heaven was only opened for qualified candidates. Every candidate would have on them an item such as a letter or accessory from the powerful person who recommended them. Those items were stained with the powerful person’s aura, and only with the presence of the aura would one be qualified to step on the Path to Heaven. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Otherwise, no matter how badly they fell, they would still not be able to enter.

“I made a misjudgment,” someone from the Liu Yun family clan muttered suddenly while looking at the increasing number of people on the Path to Heaven.

“I didn’t think that Ye Qingtang would capable enough to become the first person walking up the Path to Heaven. Yun Shu even benefited from her.”

“I’ve never heard of the Ye family clan from Lin Town. If her spirit root is alright, perhaps, she will be able to become something,” said a sharp-eyed person as he saw Ye Qingtang’s specialness.

The Path to Heaven was way too easy for her, and this was unexpected for others.

One had to be careful with every step they took on the Path to Heaven. The higher they walked up, the calmer their emotions should be. Being more than a hundred meters away from the ground, one would definitely die if they fell.

Everyone was on alert, and many were already soaked in sweat before they even got far.

Only Ye Qingtang was walking leisurely as though she was singing and dancing merrily. From time to time, she looked at the birds that were flying past nearby her. Her cheerful and contented posture earned the exasperation of the candidates behind as they gritted their teeth.

Who knew where that little girl was from to walk up the Path to Heaven so leisurely as though she was strolling in her own courtyard.
