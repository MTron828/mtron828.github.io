Chapter 516 Doubts (2)

Ye Qingtang remained seated at where she was. Aloofness remained on her face, and there was not the slightest change in her eyes.

“You wish to prove my identity with the Demonic Water?” Ye Qingtang questioned.

“Haha… You’re right.” The elderly nodded with coldness filling his eyes.

The Blood Moon Elder frowned slightly as he looked at Ye Qingtang beside him.

The Blood Moon Aura and the blood moon symbol on her glabella were completely forged, and the Blood Moon Elder was extremely clear of this.

However, he never expected that this Blood Moon Sect Division still had remaining Demonic Water. He originally assumed that all the Demonic Water was destroyed along with Blood Moon Sect’s annihilation back then. Yet…

That year, hundreds of sects combined forces and fought Blood Moon Sect together. To obtain information of the internal situation and topography of the Blood Moon Sect, they sent many disciples as well as high-ranking elders and used a special chemical to forge the Blood Moon Aura, allowing them to hide in the Blood Moon Sect successfully.

When the sects attacked, those elders and disciples who hid in Blood Moon Sect coordinated with the attacks, catching the Blood Moon Sect unprepared.

Even though it had been a thousand years since the incident, it was, however, a vivid memory to the Blood Moon Sect members, and they never forgot it.

Then, the Blood Moon Elder could only sigh. No matter what, the matter had already reached to this extent, and it was all up to Ye Qingtang’s luck. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

It was not to say that the Blood Moon Elder was worried about Ye Qingtang’s safety.

Currently, he was already tied together with Ye Qingtang. If Ye Qingtang’s identity as a Guardian was discovered to be fake, he, who was with Ye Qingtang, would be nowhere better. At that instant, there was simply no way for the Blood Moon Sect Elder to prove his identity and would probably be shredded into pieces by the Blood Moon Sect members. In that case, his death despite being a Blood Moon Elder would truly be a wronged one.

Ye Qingtang looked at the elderly in the lead, and her lips curled into a cold smile. “You’re really bold. How dare a mere Division Head make me prove my identity using the Demonic Water?”

Blood Demon and Soul Severing Troll exchanged a look, and suspicions arose. Could it really be that the Blood Moon Guardian before them was fake as what the Division Head said? If that was really the case, both of them actually brought an impostor back into the Blood Moon Sect Division… “Guardian, why would you be afraid to prove yourself if you’re real?” Blood Demon’s tone turned cold, and a ruthless expression could be seen in his eyes.

Although there was no change in Ye Qingtang’s expression, she was aware that things were not too encouraging.

This Blood Moon Division Head was extremely cautious and shrewd that he never believed she was a Blood Moon Guardian. Ye Qingtang was also aware that her Blood Moon Aura and the blood-colored crescent moon on her glabella were definitely created by her cheap brother. Once she came into contact with the Demonic Water, the Blood Moon Aura and crescent would fade. She was in Blood Moon Sect’s territory currently, and should her identity be exposed, the consequences were dire. This was a Blood Moon Sect Division. Apart from the Branch Masters, there was another Division Head whose combat powers were frightening. If the self-certification failed, she and even the Blood Moon Elder would probably be unable to leave this place alive.

“Shuo Tianzang, bring the Demonic Water.” Seeing that Ye Qingtang did not say anything after a long time, the elderly in the lead immediately ordered a detached-looking male who wielded a sword.

The male turned around and left without saying anything.

Not long later, he returned to the main hall again and handed a golden bottle in his hand to the elderly.
