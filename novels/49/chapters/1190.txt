Chapter 1191: Battle (2)

After a few hours, in the middle of the battle, You Tianhe, who had lost an arm, came over to the old man. With a frown, he said, “The battle is lost… We’re outnumbered. The number of powerful cultivators they have is terrifying… We already sustained heavy losses when we first occupied Heaven City. If we continue this battle, the entire army will be lost…”

As the overall commander, the old man was fully aware of all this without You Tianhe reminding him. However, he could not bear to retreat now!

The Ancient You Clan had desolated the entire southern battlefield wherever it went so that nothing was left alive. They had easily captured the various major cities and would have shortly exterminated all the powerful cultivators in the southern battlefield of this mainland. Instead, he had successively lost two cities!

The first was Dragon Elephant City, which was lost in a surprise attack. The second was Heaven City, which was lost when it was forcibly invaded… if they just left like that, how could he face the Lord General?!

“As long as the city stands… we will stay. If we lose the city… we will all die!” The old man clenched his fists and said through gritted teeth.

As a commander, it was a strange concept to have over the loss of just one city. How many mainlands had he conquered for the Ancient You Clan in his life?! When had he ever suffered such humiliation?!

Today, even if he died, he would never… flee!

“Very well.” You Tianhe glanced at the old man and did not speak further. All he could do was to obey the orders he received.

Day turned to night. After a long time, the ground was covered with blood…

You Tianhe and the old man were surrounded by Daoist Zijin and Perfected Xuanchen.

Within Heaven City, only You Tianhe and the old man were left for the Ancient You Clan. The rest had all died in battle.

“You’ve lost.”

Ye Qingtang said blandly as she looked at You Tianhe and the old man.

“Lost…”

When he heard Ye Qingtang’s words, the old man laughed coldly. “Indeed… we’ve lost… but we have only lost a city. We have won the entire southern region… and the entire mainland!”

“Hmph, are you still disputing with us now that matters have reached this state?!” Daoist Zijin laughed coldly. “If you surrender, we will spare you. Otherwise, you will die!”

“Surrender…”

The old man laughed wildly. “I am an upright man. If I win, I win. If I lose, I lose. But I have never known what it means to surrender… There is no need for you to humiliate me today. I will account for myself!”

As he finished speaking, the old man flourished his right arm. As everyone watched, he used his palm to smash his own glabella.

Boom!

The next second, the old man’s body collapsed to the ground. He had killed himself.

Clank!

The next moment, You Tianhe drew his long sword. With the speed of lightning, he swept his sword across his own throat.

You Tianhe and the overall commander of this troop from the Ancient You Clan had committed suicide. This surprised everyone.

“Bury them.” Elder Bai Kui spoke slowly as he stared at the bodies of the two men who had killed themselves. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

He felt neither pity nor any kind of emotion. This was a battlefield, a fundamentally cruel place.

However, to Elder Bai Kui, these two men were simply opponents worthy of his respect.

The feelings of a commander and leader whose city had been invaded truly could not be expressed to others. Suicide was just death. However, their hearts were probably filled with regret.

To Elder Bai Kui, these two men were truly great generals. A pity that they were on opposing sides.

“Bury them both.”

Daoist Zijin walked forward, shaking his head, and issued orders to the Ye Family disciples.
