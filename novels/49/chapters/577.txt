Roar!!!

Standing at the boundary of the city gates, the Buddha statue glared at Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder as a terrifying roar erupted from its mouth.

“Eh…” The Blood Moon Elder looked at the roaring Buddha statue in the city and was in a slight daze. “This demonic creature seems to be unable to leave the small city.”

Ye Qingtang turned over to take a look as well. This small city seemed to have a certain barrier that did not allow demonic creatures within the city to leave.

“It seems like it.” Ye Qingtang spoke.

“Hahahaha!” All of a sudden, the Blood Moon Elder laughed loudly and pointed at the Buddha statue at the boundary of the city gates. “You must thank your own luck. If not for the fact that my skills are not at when I was at my peak back then, I would have long crushed you into pieces with a punch!”

After he gained knowledge that the Buddha statue was unable to leave the small city, arrogance filled the Blood Moon Elder’s face as though he was the unparalleled ruler of the world who looked down upon everyone with haughtiness!

“Do you need me to send you in and tell it that?” Ye Qingtang looked away from the Buddha statue and at the Blood Moon Elder.

After he heard Ye Qingtang, the Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed immediately.

If he was kicked back into the city by Ye Qingtang, wouldn’t that Buddha statue tear him apart alive…

“Coughs… Holy Lady, I think there’s no need for that…” The Blood Moon Elder muttered.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. This Blood Moon Elder was simply bound too deeply to the past as he spoke about how he was thousands of years ago every now and then.

Ye Qingtang was not interested in how the Blood Moon Elder was a thousand years ago. She was only interested in his current state.

“Holy Lady… This place has a strong smell of death. It’s not good to stay here for long. It’s safer for us to leave right now…” Flattery filled the Blood Moon Elder’s face.

“…” Ye Qingtang stared at the Blood Moon Elder.

He was still talking about killing and had airs of authority, but after hearing that he was to return back to the city, he was immediately frightened. His shamelessness might just be even greater than his martial skills when he was at his peak a thousand years ago…

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to say anything more to the Blood Moon Elder and simply headed forward.

…

This place was an extremely huge mountain valley. At this moment, both of them were walking on a certain hill.

It had already been a day since they entered this mystic realm while the powerful figures from Formidable Heavens Dynasty and Nine Nights Dynasty had entered for a way longer time than they have.

Presently, Ye Qingtang’s heart was filled with puzzlement.

After entering the mystic realm, she had not seen traces of anyone from either dynasty apart from the skulls of Li Chenfeng and a Lingyun Sect elder. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Thinking about it carefully, Li Chenfeng and that Lingyun Sect elder probably unintentionally intruded into the blood-colored city and alarmed the scary Buddha statue, ultimately causing them to be slaughtered.

Currently, Ye Qingtang only wanted to understand what exactly happened to the forces who entered the mystic realm as quickly as possible.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder had already walked for hours on this hill. It was only until dusk when they saw a dilapidated temple.

The temple was extremely simple and unsophisticated. It was not too big and had a square shape, appearing to be very ordinary.

However, there were seven to eight sect disciples outside the temple.

Ye Qingtang looked carefully and realized that two of those disciples were from Falling Sky Valley while the remaining people were from Nine Nights Dynasty.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang originally wanted to ask them about the situation but suddenly recalled that she was currently wearing a Yunxiao Sect disciple uniform.

Yunxiao Sect was a super sect of Formidable Heavens Dynasty while multiple people near the temple were from Nine Nights Dynasty. The dynasties were enemies with each other. Especially, members from Yunxiao Sect were irreconcilable archenemies with Falling Sky Valley.
