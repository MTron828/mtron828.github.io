Very quickly, Ye Qingtang placed the disciple down and asked, “What happened?”

This Xuanling Sect did not hide anything and recounted the incident in the fastest speed possible.

“Ning Luo?” Ye Qingtang was in thought.

From what he said, Ning Luo had already silenced Fu Lingtian yesterday night.

Perhaps others were not aware, but Ye Qingtang was certain that Ning Luo was definitely a Yunxiao Sect disciple.

Back then, Ye Qingtang learned from the Zhou brothers that Ning Luo, whom she had never seen before, wanted to take her life.

Ye Qingtang was very certain that she had never met Ning Luo nor offended Ning Luo before.

If Ning Luo, a Yunxiao Sect disciple, wanted to get rid of her in Xuanling Sect, it would definitely be Ye You’s orders, and everything made sense then.

“Go. Bring me there.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Xuanling Sect disciple beside her.

She had to kill Ning Luo in the shortest time possible. Then, Yunxiao Sect would not know that Xuanling Sect had found out their secret, and perhaps Xuanling Sect could be saved.

“Junior Sister Ye, it’s better for us to leave!” The Xuanling Sect disciple was panic-stricken. “Let’s hurry back to the sect and get reinforcements. If the two of us go back now, it is simply courting death. Did you know that Ning Luo has been concealing his cultivation skills all this time in Xuanling Sect? He has already entered the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three!”

At this instant, fear was written all over the Xuanling Sect disciple’s face.

Ning Luo had only used the martial aura, and the several inner sect disciples already could not fight back. Ning Luo’s skills were definitely not weaker than the sect elders and had surpassed inner sect disciples like them.

After hearing that, Ye Qingtang was completely sure that Ning Luo was a Yunxiao Sect disciple.

Martial Qi Level Three was the level of a Yunxiao Sect inner sect disciple but that of an elder in Xuanling Sect.

“You’re scared?” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“Scared… Who said I’m scared?” The Xuanling Sect disciple continued. “I only wanted to return to the sect to call for reinforcement. Otherwise, it will really be too late. The other senior and junior brothers would definitely die in his hands!”

“Since that’s the case, let’s leave then. I am the reinforcement,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Junior Sister Ye… Don’t force yourself at this critical juncture… Did I not say it clearly enough? Ning Luo is at Martial Qi Level Three!”

This Xuanling Sect disciple thought that he had not explained Ning Luo’s skills clearly and was afraid that Ye Qingtang misunderstood.

“Long-winded!” Ye Qingtang leaped up her horse, grabbed the Xuanling Sect disciple, and headed forward.

In at most a few breaths’ time, Ye Qingtang arrived at the forest.

The moment she entered the forest, Ye Qingtang saw a few shadows being flung out.

Ye Qingtang swiftly moved and caught those figures at the speed of lightning.

“Junior Sister Ye?!”

When the few people stood properly and saw that it was Ye Qingtang, Zhu Changge had a surprised expression.

A few days ago, they searched for Ye Qingtang on Drifting Cloud Island for two days but still could not find her, and helplessly, Elder Qin could only return to the sect in the end.

He never expected that Ye Qingtang, who had been missing for days, would actually appear here.

“Junior Sister Ye, why are you here!” Qin Huan had an astonished look.

It was already hard for them to protect themselves against Ning Luo, yet where did Ye Qingtang appear from to join in? Was she not afraid of dying? Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Ha…” Ning Luo looked at Ye Qingtang who was not far away, and his lips curled up. “Earlier on, I still found it a pity that I could not complete Senior Sister Ye You’s orders… Ye Qingtang, you’re really thoughtful to send yourself here because you’re afraid I would have regrets.”
