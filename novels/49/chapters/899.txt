Chapter 900 It’s You Whom I Am Hitting (2)

Feng Wuya was in pain. He clutched his stomach and stumbled backward while breathing heavily.

“Who hit me?!”

Feng Wuya roared and looked around with his eyes glittering with a cold light.

Feng Wuya looked around him, but there was no one in sight. It was as if he was hallucinating. No one had appeared, and no one had hit him.

But Feng Wuya clearly had just been viciously punched.

“This…”

The disciples from the Divine Virtual Academy exchanged glances.

Feng Wuya was just too weak. It was normal that he had not clearly seen what had happened. However, the Divine Virtual Academy disciples had clearly seen what had happened.

A beautiful girl had appeared, swiftly struck a heavy blow at Feng Wuya, and then left.

But the girl had moved too quickly. With Feng Wuya’s abilities, he could not clearly see what had happened.

“Junior Brother Feng, no one hit you. You are thinking too much.”

The leader of the disciples from the Divine Virtual Academy hurriedly smiled and said.

If he told the truth, Feng Wuya would definitely make them capture the girl. They could not defy Feng Wuya’s order, but if they obeyed and sent half their forces out to look for the girl, they would be shorthanded.

Just now, Feng Wuya had made a show of his authority in front of everyone from the Supreme Academy and then cruelly killed one of their people.

If the Supreme Academy became enraged and flung caution aside to pit themselves against Feng Wuya… and if Feng Wuya was injured because of this, they would all be held accountable.

“No one hit me?” Feng Wuya frowned deeply with a suspicious look.

“That’s right, no one hit you.” A few disciples of the Divine Virtual Academy nodded rapidly.

“Hahaha!”

But before Feng Wuya could speak again, Gu Tianhe, who was being pressed to the ground burst out in wild laughter. He said excitedly, “Feng Wuya, you’re doomed. Our Senior Sister Ye is here!”

Although Feng Wuya had not seen the person clearly, Gu Tianhe had clearly seen that the figure who had flashed past was their Senior Sister Ye, Ye Qingtang!

“What are you saying?”

Feng Wuya walked over to Gu Tianhe and punched his face. “What Senior Sister Ye? Where is she? Ask her to come out!”

At that moment, everyone from the Supreme Academy looked more and more puzzled. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The disciples from Supreme Academy that had come were all present. There was no Senior Sister Ye.

“Didn’t you say that no one hit me!”

Feng Wuya turned to look at the people from the Divine Virtual Academy.

When the leader of the Divine Virtual Academy’s disciples saw that he could not conceal the truth anymore, he had no choice but to tell the truth.

“Oh… a dazzling beauty?”

When he heard what the leader said, Feng Wuya’s lips curved into a smile. “No wonder… no wonder I sensed a mesmerizing scent…”

“If you won’t come out…”

Feng Wuya laughed coldly and clutched Gu Tianhe’s throat. He looked about. “I’ll count to three. If you don’t come out, I’ll kill him. After that, I will kill one person from the Supreme Academy every fifteen minutes!”

Gu Tianhe gritted his teeth and glared at Feng Wuya.

If not for the fact that the people from the Divine Virtual Academy were restricting his movements, he would disregard his own life and fight Feng Wuya to death.

“Three!”

Feng Wuya started the countdown.

“Two!”

“One and a half!”

“One!”

With that, Feng Wuya tightened his grip. He clutched Gu Tianhe’s throat and lifted him into the air.

But at that moment.

A snow-white figure flew over!
