Chapter 124: Assessment Results (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

To them, Xuanling Sect was just an extravagant desire.

Lu Xiuwen stood in line with those selected, but his gaze fell on Ye Qingtang, who was amongst those who did not make it. He did not conceal the sarcasm and arrogance on his face as he looked at Ye Qingtang as though he was looking at a lowly ant.

Ye Qingtang, look closely. This is the gap between you and me. The moment you leave Xuanling Sect, the Formidable Heavens Royals will prepare a large enough “surprise” for you.

Just when everyone thought that the assessment had come to an end and was about to leave dishearteningly, the middle-aged man who had been silent for quite some time suddenly opened his mouth once again.

“Ye Qingtang.”

Three simple syllables without any fluctuation.

But when that name fell into everyone’s ears, disbelief appeared on everyone’s faces.

Ye Qingtang?

That Ye Qingtang with only a red spirit root?

How could this be?!

Everyone could not believe their ears and suspected if the middle-aged man read the wrong name.

But when they saw Ye Qingtang walking out from the crowd with no emotion on her face, and stood on the side of the selected candidates, everyone went crazy.

“How could this be? How did Ye Qingtang pass the assessment?”

“This is impossible. How can she enter Xuanling Sect with that kind of result in the third segment?”

The group of people, who were initially sorrowful over not being selected into Xuanling Sect, completely boiled over at that moment.

Previously, those people whose names were read out were pretty skilled and had good spirit roots. They knew that they could not be compared to them; thus, even if they were not content, they could only accept it.

However… Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang was selected?

On what basis!

So many people with yellow and orange spirit roots were rejected by the sect. What right does someone with a tiny, red spirit root have to be selected into Xuanling Sect?

As everyone was in a flurry, Ye Qingtang had already stood upright.

She was not at all affected by this result.

Upon seeing Ye Qingtang walking to the side, the arrogant smile on Lu Xiuwen’s face completely fell. Shock filled his eyes. He was simply unable to believe that Ye Qingtang actually passed the assessment.

What kind of joke was this!

Everyone started discussing gradually, turning the place extremely noisy.

Seeing the sight, the middle-aged man who finished reading all the candidates’ name frowned slightly with an ugly expression on his face.

“Today’s assessment has all ended, and those selected are confirmed. Non-disciples of Xuanling Sect will be sent away immediately. If anyone dares to make noise outside Xuanling Sect, he or she will be punished according to the sect’s rules.

The stern scolding was like a shocking thunder that suddenly struck all those discussion sounds into broken pieces.

Everyone kept their mouth shut at that moment.

Now, they were no longer candidates but a group of sad people who had no fate with the sect.

How could a noble sect allow them to scream and shout here?

Everyone remained silent as dissatisfaction and despair overwhelmed them.

The middle-aged man was simply unwilling to waste any more time on the group of people and turned to face the selected candidates including Ye Qingtang. “From now on, you all are outer sect disciples of Xuanling Sect. Follow me into the sect.”

“Yes,” everyone replied simultaneously.

Without saying anything more, the middle-aged man turned around and stepped into the sect’s entrance.

Behind him were over ten young boys and girls in high spirits. At that moment, they could not care about how Ye Qingtang entered the sect. As long as they ensured that they could enter the sect, it was already very fortunate!

From the start to the end, only Lu Xiuwen’s shocked eyes never left Ye Qingtang.
