Chapter 969 The Match (1)

“Haven’t you heard? A formidable young member of the Ye Family has returned.”

“Does the Ye Family have a formidable young member? Could it be that Ye You has returned?”

Everyone was shocked.

If the Ye Family could be said to have a formidable young member, then it was Ye You, who had entered the Yunxiao Sect.

Ye You’s grandfather had been the Great Elder of the Ye Family. However, her grandfather had foolishly tried to grasp all the power in the Ye Family, vanishing in the end. This had happened more than a year ago, but no one knew whether Ye You’s grandfather was dead or alive. The Ye Family avoided all mention of this matter.

Instead, they invited a new powerful figure to take up the position of Great Elder in the Ye Family.

And in that period, Ye You had not returned to Lin Town.

Everyone guessed that the Ye Family’s dissatisfaction towards Ye You’s grandfather had caused Ye You to abandon the Ye Family. She had probably deliberately cut off all contact with the Ye Family.

Indeed, Ye You now held the lofty status of the disciple of the Yunxiao Sect’s sect master. Considering her status, without her grandfather, the Ye Family was beneath her.

“It’s not Ye You, it’s Dan Yifan, the grandson of the Ye Family’s new Great Elder.”

“Dan Yifan? Where is he from? I haven’t heard of him before.”

“I’ve heard that this Dan Yifan is only in his teens but is already an inner sect disciple of the Leiting Sect. He has great natural ability. He has probably returned this time to helm the Ye Family.”

“An inner sect disciple of the Leiting Sect?!”

As they discussed it, they could not help but be shocked by Dan Yifan’s background.

Very few people in the entire Lin Town could enter a sect, much less become an inner sect disciple.

Ye You had been the exception. She had managed to enter the YunXiao Sect because of her spirit root. However, this Dan Yifan must be quite formidable to have become an inner sect disciple at such a young age, just based on his natural ability.

Just as everyone was fervently discussing the matter, the numerous members of the Ye Family, led by Dan Yifan, arrived at the martial arts arena. Everyone’s gaze was concentrated on the young man in the lead, who carried himself with extraordinary poise.

Just after the Ye Family arrived, the Duan Family also walked into the martial arts arena. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The crowd which had gathered to watch the show immediately quieted down when they saw the members of the Duan Family arrive.

Today, more than ten younger members of the Duan Family had arrived.

In the lead was Duan Luoning, who had gone to the Ye House to issue the challenge.

“Who does the Ye Family intend to send for today’s match?” A youth from the Duan Family advanced and spoke mockingly to the group from the Ye Family.

Dan Yifan raised his brows slightly and stepped forward.

“Since you want to play, I shall play with you for a while.”

“What arrogance!” The youth from the Duan Family glared at Dan Yifan, who had stepped forward. A cold light flashed across his eyes. “You only have the advantage of words now. Wait until you get up on the dais. You will probably wet your pants in terror.”

“I’m afraid that you will be the ones to wet your pants…” Dan Yifan said blandly. He took no notice of the Duan Family’s provocation.

“You!” The youth from the Duan Family narrowed his eyes and stepped forward swiftly. However, he was suddenly pulled back by Duan Luoning, who was standing behind him.

Duan Luoning raised his eyes to look at Dan Yifan and said, “Sparring with words is meaningless. We have already clearly set out the terms of today’s fight. There is no need to say anymore. Let’s begin the fight.”

Dan Yifan said, “Very well.” With that, Dan Yifan swiftly leaped onto the dais, and Duan Luoning followed.

“Young Master Dan, give it to the Duan Family!” The group from the Ye Family shouted when they saw Dan Yifan enter the arena.
