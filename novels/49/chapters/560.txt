Chapter 561 A Story (2)

Ignoring Senior Brother Zhuo’s struggles, Ning Luo said as he played chess with the black-robed man, “A long long time ago, a true god descended from the heavens to the mortal realm. When she saw the infertile land, sympathy arose within her, and thus, she scattered her divine power to every corner of the world, letting those pitiful people see a trace of hope and a ray of light.”

Senior Brother Zhuo was shocked. He neither knew what Ning Luo was talking about nor did he want to listen to his crazy words. All he wanted to do was to escape this bind and leave this place.

However…

Ning Luo’s hand was as firm as a steel cage and barely moved an inch.

At that moment, Ning Luo’s story did not end. “As the true god arrived, those once pitiful humans worshipped her and constructed a shrine where they viewed her as a faith. From then on, the power of faith was born in this world…

However… as time passed, what the true god could offer to them was less and less…”

When he reached there, Ning Luo’s eyes were completely cold, and his talking speed increased. “Humans began to resent the true god. They began to think that she was no longer compassionate and no longer deserved to have a shrine…. Ultimately, selfishness and greed bred in their hearts. They destroyed the shrine and the faith. Then, they combined forces to kill the true god and dissected her body to greedily suck the last trace of divine power in her body…”

Suddenly, the chessboard under the black-robed man crumbled, and the chess pieces scattered all over the floor.

Ning Luo’s expression returned to normal, and his eyes were indifferent as he looked at Senior Brother Zhuo. “Senior Brother Zhuo…. The true god offered her everything selflessly and exhausted all her divine power to bless the mortal world. Humans were not grateful and even sucked dry the last bit of divine power in the true god’s body by cutting her up and consuming her flesh… In your opinion, is it cruel? Since that’s the case, why must the true god be compassionate to these humans? They must ultimately pay a terrible price for their ugly actions.”

“You… are a …. lunatic… What exactly… are… are you… talking… about… Let me… go!” Senior Brother Zhuo felt like he was almost suffocated under Ning Luo’s strangle.

“What… true god… I don’t know…. Ning Luo… This place is… Yunxiao Sect. You… better… let me go…. On account that… you are my… junior brother, I will definitely… not spread this out…” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ning Luo did not have any reaction at all. Fearful, Senior Brother Zhuo could not help but be submissive.

Clack!

In the next second, the sound of crushed bones rang.

Thud!

Ning Luo released his hands, and Senior Brother Zhuo collapsed on the ground powerlessly. His neck was already snapped, and he was no longer breathing.

Very quickly, Senior Brother Zhuo’s body was covered with a layer of ice which subsequently cracked and turned broken shards. It was as though Senior Brother Zhuo never existed in this world.

“When is the mystic realm opening?” Ning Luo looked at the black-robed man.

“In half a month.” A deep voice sounded from the black robe.

“I’m really looking forward…. to the arrival of that day.” Ning Luo walked to the window with his hands behind him. The smile on his lips never disappeared.

“I’ll take a leave first.” The black-robed man rose slowly and turned into a ball of black fog in the pavilion before eventually vanishing without a trace.

At that moment, only Ning Luo’s lonely back view remained.

He lifted his head slightly and gazed at the full moon outside the window.

Under the moonlight, Ning Luo stood by the window in a white top, and a faint smile hung on his lips. However, tears of blood streaked across the rim of his eyes.
