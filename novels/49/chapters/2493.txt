Chapter 2494: Underground Demon God (4)

The Blood Moon Elder found it hard to accept the fact that he had died long ago. He was so powerful, how could he be killed so easily by the Ancient You Clan? Shouldn’t he be the one who killed them instead… that was more his style!

However, reality did not allow for the slightest bit of imagination. If he died, that meant he died. There was nothing more to say on the matter.

“Holy Lady, even so, my current body is a little…” The Blood Moon Elder did not dare to continue looking at the middle-aged man in the ancient bronze mirror and could only avert his gaze.

“I feel that it suits your temperament. Why? Are you not satisfied?” Ye Qingtang was surprised. According to her understanding of the Blood Moon Elder, he should be very satisfied with the vessel she chose.

“I…” The Blood Moon Elder stared at Ye Qingtang, his lips twitching. In the end, he said,” It’s still alright… there’s still room for improvement.”

“Yes, as long as you like it.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

The Blood Moon Elder, “…” He did not like it! But he did not dare to say it.

“Oh, so it’s your old flame. I was just wondering,” the big yellow dog said thoughtfully as it listened to the conversation between Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

“Old flame?” Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog.

“Old acquaintance, I misspoke. No matter how bad your taste is, it’s impossible to be that bad. Although I’m just a dog, I still have some understanding of the human race. The women of the human race are all like those extremely intelligent and handsome men. This thing here is definitely not something that the women of the human race would fancy,” the big yellow dog said while wagging its tail.

The Blood Moon Elder was enraged when he heard the big yellow dog. He wanted to refute but felt that he was unable to dispute the dog’s words.

Indeed his current body was very ugly. Even he felt that way.

The Blood Moon Elder simply ignored the problem of appearance and looked at Ye Qingtang. “Holy Lady, that battle…”

“We won,” Ye Qingtang said bluntly.

After hearing what Ye Qingtang said, the Blood Moon Elder was completely relieved. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Haha, Holy Lady, I knew it would be like this. Who do the Ancient You Clan think they are? Since they dared to come, they should know it was a one-way trip. It’s just a pity that I was already dead at that time. It’s such a pity that I did not see them kneeling and begging for mercy.” The Blood Moon Elder first laughed before sighing. He had really died at the wrong time.

“Holy Lady… the spirit energy here is extremely dense. It shouldn’t be the First Mainland, right?” The Blood Moon Elder asked after a moment.

Ye Qingtang did not deny it but did not reveal the fact about her Deity Ocean. She just told the Blood Moon Elder about the general situation.

“Demon Realm? Wait, Holy Lady, you’ve already arrived in the Second Domain!”

The Blood Moon Elder was dumbfounded by the slew of information that Ye Qingtang had just told him. Especially after knowing that Ye Qingtang was in the Second Domain, the Blood Moon Elder was shocked and even a little fearful.

The Second Domain… wasn’t that where his main body was?

The Blood Moon Elder was obviously very afraid of his main body and was unwilling to come into contact with it.

“We can go back sometime tomorrow.” Ye Qingtang smiled at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady, the spirit energy here is so abundant. Why don’t… we go back later?” The Blood Moon Elder was a little hesitant. He did not want to go to the Second Domain. Once he entered the Second Domain, it meant that he might encounter his main body..
