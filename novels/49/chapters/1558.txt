Chapter 1559 Display of Remarkable Prowess 3

With a faint smile, Jiang Xinyue walked forward slowly and raised her sword with her fair hand. In Cao Xu’s eyes, this action seemed weak and lacking in strength, and he increasingly found the situation to be a joke.But just as Cao Xu was prepared to receive the strike casually...

The sword in Jiang Xinyue’s hand was enveloped with a faint sword aura right before the attack landed. She slashed at her own pace, but the seemingly casual set of motions, however, stirred an overwhelming sensation of pressure in the surroundings the moment the sword aura landed!

A look of astonishment flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes the moment she saw the sword aura that appeared dull and ordinary at first glance.

Cao Xu, who was initially absentminded, suddenly felt a suffocating amount of pressure coming from the sky. His eyes widened slightly, and cold sweat beaded on his forehead as he looked at the sword aura Jiang Xinyue produced.

The sword aura seemed to be able to pierce the air, and it was as though time had come to a standstill at this instant.

An ominous feeling crept into Cao Xu’s heart.

Never had he thought that Jiang Xinyue’s casual slash would carry such immense sword aura!

In just a moment, Cao Xu did not dare to be nonchalant any longer and immediately took it seriously. He gathered all his strength in his body and instantly released all the powers of the Impenetrable Golden Armor. The ground beneath his feet shattered into countless pieces from the massive impact!

Even his feet, which were firmly rooted to the ground, retreated backward immediately.

But this was still too late!

Jiang Xinyue’s slash seemed to be slow, but it was, almost unrealistically, as swift as a lightning bolt.

In a flash, the bolt of sword aura struck Cao Xu’s body. Although he tried to dodge the strike in the last second, it was too late, and it landed right on his shoulder!

Boom!

Jiang Xinyue opened a huge cut on Cao Xu’s shoulder. Under the massive impact, he let out a yell as the ground beneath his feet shattered into pieces!

A mouthful of blood splattered out of his mouth. He retreated in a ruffle as he glared at the smiling Jiang Xinyue in disbelief.

‘How... How can it be...” Cao Xu’s eyes were filled with shock. He never expected the physical strength of his Impenetrable Golden Armor fourth level to be slashed apart by Jiang Xinyue so easily!

Jiang Lin’s lips curled into a sneer at the sight of the pale Cao Xu.

Jiang Lin could boast that he was rather talented in swordplay, but he could only be ranked close to the front few among the disciples of his generation in Taiyuan Valley; he was far from entering the top three.

However, Jiang Xinyue was ranked third on the swordplay ranking of their generation.

Even the confident Jiang Lin did not dare to compare with Jiang Xinyue in swordplay.

Cao Xu was simply embarrassing himself! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“What a pity. You could not receive my strike. I’m afraid you can’t see him.” Jiang Xinyue chuckled as she glanced at Cao Xu mockingly.

All Cao Xu felt was acute pain in his shoulder, which almost tore him apart internally. If he did not use all his strength just now, he would have been split into two by Jiang Xinyue.

“Just you wait!” Cao Xu swore before miserably leaving Taiyuan Valley with his people.

“Useless.” Jiang Xinyue scoffed. Then, she turned around and was about to leave when she suddenly noticed Jiang Shaobai beside Ye Qingtang. A look of surprise flashed across her eyes.

“Why are you...”

Without waiting for Jiang Xinyue to finish her sentence, Jiang Shaobai beamed. “Sister Yue, your swordplay has become more and more exquisite.”

Jiang Xinyue’s lips twitched slightly before she glanced at Ye Qingtang, who was beside Jiang Shaobai. Something seemed to flash across her eyes, but she did not say anything.
