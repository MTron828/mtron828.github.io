Chapter 2074: The Disintegrating Seal (1)

The eight tribe leaders had not noticed anything wrong with Ye Qingtang and were still encouraging her to return to the Second Domain.

It was Ming Wang beside her who noticed her pale face.

Brows furrowing, he looked at the chattering eight tribe leaders and said coldly, “The Holy Lord has her own plans. This issue with the Ancient You Clan is more important right now. If you have nothing else to say, please leave.”

The eight tribe leaders were speechless.

This little rascal! How dare he make use of the Holy Lord’s affections towards him! But they knew they couldn’t be too hasty or risk Ye Qingtang’s dissatisfaction, so they left.

Ming Wang waited for all of them to leave before turning to her.

“Holy Lord, you should take a rest first.” His expression was unchanged by the worry in his eyes, revealing his true thoughts.

The pain in her chest was constant and unbearable but in order not to let Ming Wang know, she could only keep a straight face and drag herself back into her room.

Ming Wang frowned as he looked at her retreating figure.

What was wrong with Ah Yao?

Why... had he sensed a dangerous aura on her just now...

Ye Qingtang forced herself back into her room before collapsing on her bed. The pain was getting more apparent and cold sweat broke out on her forehead.

The little white tiger, which was sleeping soundly at the side, was startled awake by her sudden movements. It rubbed its half-open eyes with its paws and was about to mutter something when it noticed her collapsed on the bed, pale and covered in a cold sweat as she clutched her chest.

The little white tiger jumped up in an instant.

“D*mn, what’s happening to you?”

She had been fine when she left just now, so what was happening...

It was still puzzling over her condition when it sensed an aura that it hadn’t sensed for a long time on her.

This was...

The little white tiger jumped onto her and looked at her chest with its eyes narrowed.

The Divine Phoenix Seal... was weakening...

D*mn it, there had been so many things happening recently that it had completely forgotten that there was such a dangerous thing on her.

Ye Qingtang could feel the pain seeping into her heart and bones as her consciousness gradually faded.

“Mother... Mother... do you not want me anymore...”

A soft, familiar voice filled her ears as she faded in and out of consciousness. She soon completely blacked out.

The little white tiger narrowed its eyes as it looked at the dangerous aura surrounding her.

The door suddenly opened just as he was worrying about what to do.

Ling Yan rushed straight to her. As he saw the black fog surrounding her body, his gentle eyes turned sharp. He suddenly opened his karmic natal chart, summoned a strange force, and forced it into her body.

The black fog around her dissipated in an instant and the pain on her face cleared.

“You...” the little white tiger looked at him strangely.

“The Divine Phoenix Seal won’t be able to suppress it much longer,” he looked at the sleeping Ye Qingtang and lifted his hand to wipe the sweat off her face.

The little azure dragon’s eyes were complicated as it looked at the situation unfolding in front of him.

Ling Yan, how many lives did you think you have, to do something like this!
