Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After leaving the Blue Cloud Peak, Ye Qingtang headed back to her room, and Yan Shu returned to the Admirable Sky Peak.

Many disciples were curious about whether Ye Qingtang apologized. However, Yan Shu did not have the mood to talk about that at all.

Ye Qingtang went to apologize?

She almost beat Li Jingwen to death!

Yan Shu felt that his anger was relieved when Ye Qingtang beat Li Jingwen up, but he was very worried.

He then wanted to tell the Perfected Xuanchen about that.

However, before Yan Shu reported to the Perfected Xuanchen…

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master came over.

The Admirable Sky Peak disciples were shocked when they saw the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master appear at the Admirable Sky Peak.

The chief disciple of the Blue Cloud Peak, Li Jingwen, just came to find trouble in the morning. How come the Peak Master of the Blue Cloud Peak came over personally as well in the afternoon?

How serious was the trouble that Ye Qingtang made?

Did she not apologize to the Blue Cloud Peak?

How come the Peak Master of the Blue Cloud Peak was here as well?

Yan Shu felt his head was going to explode when he saw the Peak Master of the Blue Cloud Peak.

Perfected Xuanchen came over as he heard the news. He saw the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master’s face was clouded. The Peak Master was standing in the crowd of Admirable Sky Peak disciples along with a few Blue Cloud Peak disciples.

“Valley Master.” The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master was above fifty years old with gray temples. His level of cultivation made him appear mighty. When he saw the Perfected Xuanchen, he just addressed him without any emotion. There was no trace of respect at all.

Perfected Xuanchen did not know what had happened, and he felt curious.

When he was still the Admirable Sky Peak Peak Master, he was not in good terms with the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master. It was rare for them to meet after he became the Valley Master. How come today he would come to the Admirable Sky Peak personally?

“May I know what requires you to come here personally today?” Perfected Xuanchen asked.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master sneered. “I came not for other things but your new disciple, Valley Master.”

“You’re talking about Ye Chen?” Perfected Xuanchen was slightly stunned. He took Ye Qingtang in by exception, but he did not have time to guide him on his cultivation as he was occupied for the past few days. He planned to take some time to guide him.

Yet, unexpectedly…

How come Ye Qingtang was connected to the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master?

“That’s him.” The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master scoffed.

“What did he do?” Perfected Xuanchen’s face was calm.

“What did he do? Why don’t you ask himself?” The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master’s face was more unpleasant as he mentioned Ye Qingtang. If his disciples did not report to him today, he would not even know that Perfected Xuanchen’s new disciple dared to bully his disciples.

Perfected Xuanchen was confused.

Yan Shu was anxious but did not say anything due to the presence of the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master took a glimpse at his disciples and said, “Tell the Valley Master, what did Ye Chen do?”

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples bowed to Perfected Xuanchen and said, “Valley Master, Ye Chen injured a few of our disciples a few days ago. He came to the Blue Cloud Peak with Yan Shu just now and tried to provoke conflicts. Our Senior Brother tried to ask him to stop, but he did not listen and injured our Senior Brother.”
