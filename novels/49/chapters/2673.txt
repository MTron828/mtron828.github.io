Once they were alone, the Paragon said softly to Ye Qingtang, “Sister Ye Yue, this person’s aura is very similar to that of the previous Immortal Emperor. It’s very similar... and... very dangerous. You have to be careful.”

Ye Qingtang chuckled inwardly. If the Paragon knew about Ling Yan’s past, she would definitely not say such words.

Any random cultivator on the streets could easily kill Ling Yan. Ye Qingtang was actually very surprised that Ling Yan could possess the body of Demon God Han Cangmmg.

Actually, Ye Qingtang understood the worries of the Paragon. If she was the Paragon, she would have the same concerns. It was hard to believe and accept such a matter.

“I am just afraid that he is pretending to be your friend. If Sister Ye Yue can confirm his intention, then just take it that I’m overthinking things,” said the

Paragon.

“Sister Ah Yao, don’t worry. I can guarantee his intentions.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“Alright, there is no problem then.” Seeing Ye Qingtang’s confident expression, the Paragon nodded and finally dispelled the last doubts in her heart.

“By the way, Sister Ye Yue, who is this man who possessed the body of an Immortal Emperor?” The Paragon asked Ye Qingtang.

From what she saw previously, she felt that the relationship between the two of them was a little special.

“A.. good friend.” Ye Qingtang thought for a moment before replying.

“I see.” The Paragon nodded. “However, the way he looks at you seems to imply he doesn’t treat you as a normal friend.”

“The way he looks at me?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback, not understanding the meaning of the Paragon’s words.

“There are certain feelings between a man and a woman. It’s the kind of feeling which ends up with them becoming husband and wife...” The Paragon thought for a moment before explaining.

“Become husband and wife?” Ye Qingtang was stunned.

The Paragon had a strange expression. “It’s just that... never mind. I don’t really know much about these things. I have never experienced them before.”

Ye Qingtang, ” Before Ye Qingtang could say anything, the Paragon continued, “That demon dog... It is looking at him in a strange way too.’ Just as she finished speaking, Ling Yan strode over.

“Have you two finished whispering?

“How should I address you?” The Paragon looked at Ling Yan. “Just call me Han Cangming,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang cast a strange look at Ling Yan.

“Miss Ye, as long as I am in this era, I need to take the place of the Demon God

Han Cangmmg,” Ling Yan said.

Ye Qingtang nodded and did not say anything more. Although somewhat strange, she could understand Ling Yan’s actions. He was doing this because he did not want to cause any trouble for himself in the future. He would take over for Han Cangmmg for as long as he could.

“You are Miss Ah Yao, correct?” Ling Yan smiled at the Paragon.

“Yes?” The Paragon asked.

“Are you interested in traveling with us?” Ling Yan asked with a smile.

“I’m not interested.” The Paragon shook his head. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“That’s a pity,” Ling Yan said.

“Sister Ye Yue, I still have some things to settle. Since you have such a powerful friend, I can rest assured that you will be fine. I’ll look for you again after I am done,” the Paragon said to Ye Qingtang.

After the Paragon finished speaking, she stepped into the void and disappeared without a trace..
