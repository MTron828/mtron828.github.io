Chapter 1658: A Little Nervous (2)

“Oh wow, you’re so fierce. I only meant well.” Jiang Yiran pursed his lips in the direction of Elder Qian and the others. “Right now, the Qiu Family elder is waiting for a good show. If the girl loses terribly, she will find it hard to give an account when she returns. It might be better for her to leave the arena early.”

Jiang Yisheng glanced over and sure enough, he saw the smiling Elder Qiu and the Jiang family elders, who were all looking worried. He could not help but panic inwardly. On the other hand, Jiang Shaobai was completely composed. She looked at Ye Qingtang with shining eyes.

Opposite Ye Qingtang stood a slender, but rather ugly youth. “Lin Weiyuan of the Ancient Lin Lan Clan.” The youth cupped his fists and introduced himself.

In response, Ye Qingtang raised her hands and said, “Ye Qingtang from the Jiang family.”

“Ye...” Lin Weiyuan was startled. He wondered why Ye Qingtang had a different surname, but did not pay much attention to it.

“Go Qingtang!!” Jiang Yisheng, who was standing outside the arena was particularly anxious, possibly because of what Jiang Yiran had said. His cheers got louder and louder.

Lin Weiyuan was at the Second Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm. How could Ye Qingtang compete with him?!

As Lin Weiyuan swept a glance at Jiang Yisheng, who was whole-heartedly cheering Ye Qingtang on, he could not help but sneer. “Miss Ye certainly has many admirers.”

Lin Weiyuan had been born ugly, and many people in his family had excluded him and mocked him because of his appearance. He had trained hard to become one of the top twenty, and used his skills to prove himself. He despised those who only looked good, but who were otherwise useless.

In contrast, Ye Qingtang had been born beautiful. Now many of the youths from her clan were cheering her when she entered the arena, which aroused Lin Weiyuan’s contempt.

Another pretty face, whose popularity was due to her looks.

Of course Ye Qingtang could discern Lin Weiyuan’s sarcasm. But when she glanced at Jiang Yisheng, who was cheering her on, her eyes were smiling.

To Ye Qingtang, the good wishes of her family were always precious.

With that, Ye Qingtang looked away, then raised her gaze towards the disdainful Lin Weiyuan.

A cold laugh came out from Lin Weiyuan. “What a pity that in the arena, we are judged based on our skills and not our looks. If I accidentally disfigure your beautiful face, I hope you won’t cry.”

Ye Qingtang smiled and replied, “I’m actually not worried about that.”

“Oh?”

Ye Qingtang glanced at Lin Weiyuan’s face. “Whether you disfigure me or not makes no difference.”

Lin Weiyuan’s expression immediately turned sinister.

She dared to call him ugly!

Ye Qingtang did not care about looks. Three hundred years of experience had allowed her to see through the empty shell of beauty. In her previous life, she had lived a long time with a plain face, but she had never allowed it to bother her. Instead, she felt that Lin Weiyuan’s heart was even uglier than his face.

Of course Ye Qingtang would not allow him to have his way.

“You have a sharp tongue. Let’s see whether you’re still so quick with a retort after you’ve lost!” A cold, vicious light flashed across Lin Weiyuan’s eyes. He drew his sword and rushed forward.

Whoosh! Lin Weiyuan charged with his sword. A wild wind blew around his legs. Elder Qian and the others on the dais were shocked. They could not help but look worried.

She was finished. Who knew what that Ye Qingtang had said to Lin Weiyuan? Why was Lin Weiyuan rushing forward so aggressively?T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m
