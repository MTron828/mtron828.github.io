Chapter 2376: Desperate From His Losses (1)

The spectators were all silent now. No one expected such a shocking and unexpected outcome.

To think that Xing Rong had lost five consecutive rounds!

In reality, the spectators had already seen through Ye Qingtang’s baiting technique right from the start. But Xing Rong had been too focused on the game to realize it at all.

It was a universal truth that a bystander could always see the overall situation more clearly than a party within the situation.

“Boss! Why is your Illusion Beast Chess so formidable?” Lei Yan was gazing adoringly at Ye Qing.

Does one know the meaning of formidable?

This was exactly what formidable looked like!

Their Boss was skilled at martial arts, elixir refinement, and even chess play. Apart from bearing children, there was probably nothing in this world their Boss couldn’t do!

Lei Yan was full of pep and enthusiasm now. He no longer bore the wretched manner of someone who lost consecutive rounds. Qin Feng and the others were also full of smiles.

This youth who looked weaker than most of them was like a pillar of strength. No matter where and when, nothing could shake him.

Ye Qingtang glanced at Lei Yan. She couldn’t help feeling speechless.

This kid was able to recover from a defeat so easily. There were no hidden motives or intentions. It was a good thing, she mused.

Ye Qingtang had learned Illusion Beast Chess in the Second Domain during her previous life, but she had come into contact with this game under different circumstances from Lei Yan and the others. Ye Qingtang did not learn Illusion Beast Chess in the usual manner of family clans, academies, or sects. She had learned it in the kind of shady place where all sorts of dubious characters mixed and mingled.

Betting on chess matches was quite common in the Second Domain. In Universe City, the stakes were spirit jades. In the places where Ye Qingtang played, the stakes were your life.

Chess skills trained from games where the stakes were life and death were naturally not something which these spoilt brats could match up to.

“Boss, you truly have unfathomable depths. If I had known your Illusion Beast Chess was so good, I would have begged you to teach me a couple of moves. I might have been able to defeat that little punk then,” Lei Yan exclaimed excitedly. He had always loved chess and now that he knew of Ye Qing’s chess standards, he naturally wanted to learn from him.

“Boss, what other kinds of chess do you know? Teach us.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the naive Lei Yan. At the mention of chess, she couldn’t help thinking of that day in the Temple of Paragon when she played that game of Sea Soul Chess with the Sea King…

After that incident, Ye Qingtang really didn’t wish to see any chess pieces at all.

Although she had won by a stroke of luck, the tremendous stress when facing off the Sea King was still fresh in her mind. She would be able to leave in peace after this group of brats got through the Inter-Academy Competition.

Just as Ye Qingtang, Lei Yan and the rest were preparing to leave, a glum-faced Xing Rong suddenly stood up and violently flipped over the chessboard on the stone table.

“Stay right where you are!” Xing Rong’s eyes were malevolent as he thundered out in a cold voice.

Lei Yan and his group paused. They frowned when they saw Xing Rong’s dark expression.

“What? Is someone a sore loser?” Nangong Lie sneered.

Xing Rong had been so arrogant when he was winning. As many rounds as the rest of them had lost, they had never gone back on their bets.

The vein on Xing Rong’s forehead was popping out. His eyes were filled with venom as he glared at Ye Qingtang.

“A Netherworld Academy teacher leading her students to flout the rules of Universe City. Do you think you can leave just like that?”

Lei Yan and his gang were completely stunned by Xing Rong’s accusation.

“Xing Rong, what other tricks do you have up your sleeves? Who flouted the rules?” Nangong Lie furrowed his brows.
