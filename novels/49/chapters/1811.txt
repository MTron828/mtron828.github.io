Chapter 1812: God And Demon (2)

The Heavenly Demons and True Gods were at direct odds with each other. Why would a Heavenly Demon appear near the temple?

Ye Qingtang still couldn’t understand what was going on.

Suddenly the Heavenly Demon stood up, its towering body casting a huge shadow across the gorgeous woman. The unexpected action gave Ye Qingtang a fright, nearly forgetting that this was just an illusion.

But the shock on that woman’s face quickly faded to be replaced by a faint smile.

Those lovely eyes curved up pleasantly.

“You have startled me again. If the Shining God knows you are nearby, he will send you flying off with one punch,” the woman teased. Even under the shadow of the huge Heavenly Demon, there was no sign of fear or hatred in her face. Those lovely eyes were full of cheer.

Her voice held hints of mischief.

The Heavenly Demon stood before the woman and he seemed to be replying. But Ye Qingtang couldn’t hear his voice.

Apart from the female True God, Ye Qingtang could not hear any other sound. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Mmm, I know you are not afraid of him. But are you not afraid of me too? Mmm?” The woman appeared to be tickled by the Heavenly Demon’s words. She pretended to glare at him sternly, but her serious posture was immediately dispelled when the Heavenly Demon placed his large palm gently on her head, stroking her softly.

It was a sudden movement but the woman didn’t appear unhappy. Her stern expression instantly dissolved into a warm smile. She raised her hand and held the Heavenly Demon’s palm against her own cheek.

“Don’t worry. I already made a deal with them. I will guard the temple for ten thousand years. You must be a good boy. I will punish you if you create any trouble.”

It was clearly a warning but her tone was sweet and teasing.

Ye Qingtang was completely stunned by the scene.

What was going on?

This female True God and the Heavenly Demon... what was their relationship?

Since the ancient times, the Heavenly Demons and True Gods had been in conflict and would duel to the death whenever they encountered each other. Ye Qingtang never dreamed that she would ever witness a Heavenly Demon and True God behaving so amicably with each other.

So amicably that there were hints of a secret amorous affair happening.

Was she overthinking things? A Heavenly Demon and True God getting along was already a rare sight. It was completely impossible for these two to be having some kind of affair.

Ye Qingtang was not experienced in matters of romance, so she decided not to jump to her own conclusions.

Perhaps this female True God was just feeling sympathetic toward this trapped Heavenly Demon. Meanwhile, maybe this particular Heavenly Demon was not that evil...

No matter which race, there were bound to be ones who differed from the ‘norm’.

Weren’t there legends that described how the True Gods tried to change the Heavenly Demons for the better when they first encountered each other? In the end, they realized the demons were evil to the core and never going to change. The True Gods finally gave up the notion and imprisoned them.

However, this was just a legend and not completely verified...

As Ye Qingtang told herself to stop overthinking things, the Heavenly Demon and woman were already holding hands and strolling across the field of flowers.

It was as if those flowers were affected by the woman’s power. They swayed gently in the breeze and scattered their petals all over her body.
