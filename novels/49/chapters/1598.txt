1599 Kingdom Fortress 2

The stern-looking Supreme League King was sitting on his throne in the huge palace. The hall was flanked with dozens of tall armored men wearing cloaks.Ye Qingtang followed the vice-general, who immediately handed General Mark’s letter to the king.

The king swiftly read through it before slowly raising his eyes to look at the unusually petite young girl standing in the middle of the hall.

“You’re Tang?”

“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Ye Qingtang.

The king nodded slightly. “Mark’s letter says that you displayed extraordinary skill when the allied forces suddenly attacked. You helped to force the allied troops to retreat...”

The Supreme League Kingdom had not received news of the allied force’s sudden attack. Mark’s city was remote, but was one of Supreme League Kingdom’s crucial passes.

The King had personally sent Mark to hold the pass. If the allied forces’ scheme had succeeded, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

Fortunately, the danger had been averted; otherwise, the Supreme League Kingdom would be hard-pressed on all sides.

As the King spoke, the dozens of armored men flanking the hall glanced blankly at Ye Qingtang. They did not think much of Mark’s praises of Ye Qingtang.

After the King finished speaking, he beckoned to a nearby servant.

A moment later, the servant respectfully walked over with a tray.

The group of men, who had not paid much attention to Ye Qingtang’s arrival, now looked surprised when they saw what was on the tray.

A gray badge carved with the emblem of an eagle lay quietly on the tray.

Their expressions stiffened when they saw the emblem, but they could not express any other emotions in front of the king.

“You have lent your strength to the Supreme League Kingdom. As the King of the Supreme League Kingdom, I will now make you a Kingdom Knight. I hope that you will contribute greatly to the kingdom in the future.” The King spoke slowly as he glanced at the badge on the tray.

In his letter, Mark had highly commended Ye Qingtang for her role in the battle. But the King only saw a young girl before him; she did not seem like a valiant and powerful figure.

Even so, her contributions alone justified Ye Qingtang receiving some kind of title.

Gifting the title of a Kingdom Knight was the way in which the Supreme League Kingdom recognized powerful knights. It represented strength and loyalty and, more importantly, was a status symbol. A person who became a Kingdom Knight could remain by the King’s side to guard him. A Kingdom Knight was the highest status symbol among the knights.

The eagle badge in the tray was the emblem of the Kingdom Knights.

The dozens of armored men in the hall all wore identical eagle badges on their chests. It was an honor they were proud of. Yet now, the King was giving it to this skinny young girl. The moment the King presented her with the badge, the faces of the Kingdom Knights contorted. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Kingdom Knight?

Ye Qingtang was not familiar with this world’s terms. However, as long as she was allowed to participate in battles, she was happy to accept it.

“Thank you, Your Majesty.” Ye Qingtang bowed slowly.

The King nodded, satisfied. The Supreme League Kingdom was currently in a precarious situation. They needed powerful figures who could boost morale.
