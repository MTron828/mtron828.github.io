Chapter 2415: Desperate Straits (3)

Ye Qingtang did not hurry them but just went along with the slow pace of Lu Yuanxiang’s team. As per Ye Qing’s instructions, Mu Ziying spent all night crafting over a dozen wooden birds.

Those birds were rather small, only the size of a palm, and did not have any attacking abilities. But their simple design made them perfect for scouting.

Ye Qingtang would have Mu Ziying release those birds to scout their surroundings first to ensure that it was safe. Only then would they continue forward.

Every step was made with extra caution.

Lu Yuanxiang’s team was very curious when they saw Mu Ziying controlling those birds to scout the route ahead.

At first, they saw faint strands shooting out of Mu Ziying’s fingers and joining those wooden birds. As the birds flew farther away, those lines disappeared without a trace.

Lu Yuanxiang had met several famous puppet masters before but had never seen this kind of puppetry.

To think that it was being performed by such a young girl. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He had never heard of there being a puppet master in the Netherworld Academy.

After traveling for half a day, Lu Yuanxiang increasingly discovered that Ye Qing’s steadiness and wisdom were far beyond that of someone his young age. There were many aspects of Ye Qing which Lu Yuanxiang couldn’t help being pleasantly surprised at.

Recalling those early rumors surrounding Ye Qing in the Netherworld Academy, Lu Yuanxiang’s opinion of the youth had now completely changed.

He was not all strange or arrogant as claimed in those rumors. Instead, he was exceptionally calm and patient.

Not only that, he possessed alchemy skills even better than Zhu Ning’s, and was able to produce several Divine Lord stage students in just a few months. If this young teacher was very arrogant and if not for Di Nuo’s incident, he would have instantly become highly respected by all the teachers.

And now, after interacting with Ye Qing for some time, Lu Yuanxiang couldn’t help suspecting the true story behind Di Nuo’s departure, and why the matter had been so overblown. After all, Ye Qing didn’t look like the aggressive and pushy sort of person.

But at this point in time, Lu Yuanxiang didn’t have the mental energy to analyze this matter. All he wanted was to get through these last few days smoothly. Perhaps when the competition ended, there would be an exit from the Wailing Well.

“Boss.” Mu Ziying suddenly stopped.

“What’s wrong?” Ye Qingtang asked cautiously.

Mu Ziying moved her finger.

“Southeast direction. 800 meters away. Seems like there’s something there.”

“What is it?”

Mu Ziying did not rush to answer. She seemed to be manipulating those wooden birds to take a closer look at the situation.

“I am not sure. I crafted these birds too hastily and I can only have a vague sense so I cannot see anything. But it should not be a demon. The wooden birds are not transmitting any sense of danger.”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

As long as it was not a demon or monster.

She led her team forward to take a look, but they were all stunned when they arrived at the location.

In the middle of a dense forest was a huge crater. It looked like it had been created by a giant’s foot. Collapsed trees were strewn all around and there were large patches of blood between them… as well as remnants of pulverized bodies.

These corpses were destroyed beyond recognition and the air was thick with the putrid stench of blood.

“These are people from Maple Night Academy…” Qin Feng frowned slightly as he looked at a school badge fallen on the ground.

“What happened to them?”

Ye Qingtang surveyed the surroundings as if trying to look for something. Finally, she discovered a body beneath a fallen tree. It appeared to be the gruesome bodily remains of a teacher.
