1601 Kingdom Knights 1

The vice-general was displeased when he heard the Kingdom Knights mocking her. However, with his lowly status, he could not quarrel with the Kingdom Knights, so he had no choice but to respond humbly.“Say, Toby, don’t you think she looks rather weird? She doesn’t look like us and has black hair and those black eyes... um... Why do I feel she looks like the black witches in stories?” Another Kingdom Knight said jeeringly as he sized up Ye Qingtang.

“Ah... If she’s really a black witch, then she might be useful. But not every black-haired and dark-eyed girl is a black witch. As far as I know, black witches are all very tall, not like... this short and skinny fellow,” Toby said mockingly.

When the King was talking to Ye Qingtang in the great hall, they had heard some of what Ye Qingtang had done in the border town. However, they felt that she had not done anything to deserve such a great reward.

Ye Qingtang being made a Kingdom Knight would lower the status of the Kingdom Knights in the hearts of the people. If word got out, they would all be associated with Ye Qingtang, and the title of Kingdom Knights would become a laughing stock among the people.

At that moment, the bugle call signaling a battle suddenly sounded. The group of discontented Kingdom Knight heard the bugle call, and their expressions changed. They immediately put on their helmets and dashed towards the battlefield.

Ye Qingtang was about to follow them, but before she had advanced a few steps, the brown-haired knight blocked her way.

“You have no right to enter the battlefield if you do not receive an appointment from the King.”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

The knight laughed coldly. “There’s no need to pretend to be brave. You must be inwardly rejoicing that you don’t need to enter the blood-soaked battlefield. You should be happily hiding under your blankets and laughing to yourself.”

“Be a good girl and go prepare some food for us. Leave the battle to the real knights on the battlefield. It’s not a place for a little girl like you to play house.”

“Ha, I guess if she really entered the battlefield, she’d be so frightened she’d burst into tears.”

The knights roared with laughter as they left. They made no attempt to hide their disdain for Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang remained in the same spot. She coldly watched the knights stride away. The vice-general, who was watching from the sidelines, was very worried. He anxiously watched Ye Qingtang’s profile and was afraid that she would be offended by the snide remarks. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Ye Qingtang had just been made a Kingdom Knight, but these Kingdom Knights had been fighting for many years and were extremely skilled. The vice-general felt that if Ye Qingtang had any disagreement with them, she would probably be at a severe disadvantage.

“Knight Tang?” The vice-general asked tentatively.

Ye Qingtang calmly looked at him and said, “I cannot enter the battlefield without the King’s order?”

“Yes, yes...” The vice-general nodded.

But the explosion of rage that the vice-general anticipated never appeared. Ye Qingtang had noted the direction of the fortress exit, and now, she turned and walked towards it by herself.

The vice-general was stunned when he saw that Ye Qingtang was not angry. He immediately followed her.

“F*ck, those people are really annoying.” The little white tiger, who was cuddled in Ye Qingtang’s arms, could not help but mutter.

“Ignore them,” Ye Qingtang said calmly. She was here to complete the mission that the God of Nature had given to her, not to bluster and swagger around with the others. If they could make her angry with just a few words, then the three hundred years she lived in her past life were all in vain.
