Chapter 824 Give You A Big Present

Ye Qingtang slashed from an extremely tricky angle and used the pure sword aura to slant the force from Xuanyuan Yi’s attack.

After that move, Ye Qingtang did not stagnate and instead put away her golden wings immediately before rushing downward.

Boom!!

A loud explosion echoed.

After the angle of the force from Xuanyuan Yi’s attack slightly deviated, the force crashed into a mountain behind.

“Oh…”

Standing in the air, Xuanyuan Yi was a little surprised to see Ye Qingtang escaping into a canyon.

Her earlier attack was extremely precise. As long as there was a slight deviation, the force of his smash would erupt immediately, and Ye Qingtang would be injured by it. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

What surprised Xuanyuan Yi was not Ye Qingtang’s martial cultivation but purely her Sword Dao attainments and the ability to grasp the chance.

Very quickly, Xuanyuan Yi reorganized his mind and chased after Ye Qingtang immediately.

No matter what, Xuanyuan Yi must capture Ye Qingtang back to Falling Sky Valley today.

“Ye Chen, you cannot escape.”

Xuanyuan Yi’s voice reverberated throughout the canyon. His Yin Yang Perfected Lord aura had already locked onto Ye Qingtang, and even if she fled to the ends of the earth, she would never flee from his hands.

Whiz!

A penetrating sound rang, and Xuanyuan Yi vanished in the blink of an eye.

In the canyon, a glint emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

If she was not assertive and took a risk to deviate the force of Xuanyuan Yi’s attack using the sword aura, she would have been severely injured right now.

Xuanyuan Yi… It’s a small world. I will definitely take revenge in the future!

Ye Qingtang decided in her mind.

Behind, Xuanyuan Yi’s aura closed in rapidly. While Ye Qingtang’s speed was fast, she was only a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord after all while Xuanyuan Yi had already entered the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven, and the difference between the two of them was like heaven and earth.

If Xuanyuan Yi went all out, there was simply no chance of winning for her.

Then, Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up. Burning the golden primordial gi in her body, her speed suddenly multiplied, and she vanished from sight instantly.

Sensing that Ye Qingtang’s speed increased all of a sudden, Xuanyuan Yi was slightly taken aback, but he snickered subsequently. “Ye Chen, my aura has already locked onto you. How can you escape from me?”

At this instant, Ye Qingtang was already a few kilometers away, and there was a huge mountain peak above.

Before long, Xuanyuan Yi chased to this place.

“Why? You’re not running anymore?” Xuanyuan Yi looked at Ye Qingtang as though he was looking at his prey.

“I have a big present to give you.” Afterward, Ye Qingtang waved her sword at the mountain peak above.

In the next second, the entire mountain peak crumbled from the power of Ye Qingtang’s move. Before Xuanyuan Yi could return to his senses, he was already smashed and buried under the countless boulders.

In at most ten breaths, numerous boulders exploded, and Xuanyuan Yi gradually rose into the air, where he scanned the surroundings grimly.

A trace of astonishment emerged on his face very soon. At this moment, he could no longer sense Ye Qingtang’s aura anymore…

In a certain corner of the canyon, the sound of flowing water could be heard continuously.

There was a turbid river at the bottom, and Ye Qingtang was hidden in this river.

Given Ye Qingtang’s experience, she knew that water could sever one’s martial aura. Thus, by hiding in this river, Xuanyuan Yi would no longer be able to sense her location.
