Chapter 2204: Accusations (4)

“I will be in the Netherworld Academy, so you can direct any questions to me. If Zhang Qiqiu comes, you can hand me over to them. I’m saying this because I’m confident in myself,” Ye Qing said steadily.

As she had prepared the dark yin for Jing Ze but hadn’t expected it to be used here.

Di Nuo hadn’t expected Ye Qing to be this bold and his expression was ugly. Since he had already said all this, he would have to pay with his life if anything went wrong.

The Vice-President’s gaze turned complicated.

“Ye Qing, what elixir is this?”

“The dark yin elixir,” she said.

The Vice-President frowned. He had never heard of this elixir before.

“Since I’ll still be here, if the elixir doesn’t work, I’ll let go of all my skill and Zhang Qiqiu’s Shi family can do whatever they want with me. How about that?” she said without hesitation.

Di Nuo frowned, not believing what Ye Qing was saying.

“Di Nuo, give the dark yin elixir to Zhang Qiqiu,” the Vice-President said suddenly.

Di Nuo was stunned.

“Vice-President, don’t listen to his words. He is just trying to buy time so that he can take this opportunity to...”

The Vice-President raised one hand to interrupt him before he could finish and told Ye Qing, “Ye Qing, you will stay with me for the next few days.”

That would allow him to watch the youth for the time being.

Di Nuo gritted his teeth but quickly relaxed.

How was it possible for anyone to heal the bloodline? Ye Qing was doomed even if he used the elixir.

Without saying another word, Di Nuo took the elixir and walked off.

Ye Qingtang felt relaxed seeing that the matter had been settled for now. She already knew what the outcome would be.

Nevertheless...

“Vice-President, I have no issues with staying here but please send someone to look after my students,” she said.

The Vice-President nodded and said, “Don’t worry, no harm will come to you if you have done nothing wrong. I will arrange for them to come here so that you can teach them over the next few days.”

The Vice-President instinctively liked Ye Qing. He wouldn’t have chosen him as a Netherworld Academy teacher otherwise.

But the words of the two other teachers had made him doubt him slightly. He wanted to keep him here for two reasons. One was to ensure there was justice and two was to take this opportunity to see how the youth taught his students.

Ye Qingtang breathed a sigh of relief when she heard his words. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Vice-President sent someone to inform Lei Yan and the other students of their current situation. They had just witnessed Yun Chen being called away and were extremely taken aback.

What was going on?

“That... we’re going over to the Vice-President’s place from today?” Lei Yan scratched his head with a complicated expression on his face.

“Since it’s the Vice-President, there must be a reason for it. But we should still send Qin Feng’s medication over,” Jing Ze said kindly. Yun Chen had handed them a bottle of elixir before they left the day before and told them that Ye Qing had left it behind for Qin Feng.

“Alright, we’ll go give the medication to Qin Feng. When Yun Chen is back, we’ll tell him the news and head over to find Boss in the afternoon,” Lei Yan agreed with a nod.

They didn’t think much about it and merely treated it as a change in the place they would be studying at. Soon after, they headed to the front of the academy, ready to hand the elixir over to Qin Feng.
