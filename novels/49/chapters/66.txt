Chapter 67: The Birthday Banquet (4)

The admiring guests were all the more green with envy.

Sure enough, Mu Su was invited by Ye You to celebrate the Great Elder’s birthday!

On the other hand, Ye Ling and the Second Elder were disheartened. Whatever the reason behind Ye You going to such lengths to invite Mu Su, that was a cause for concern.

“Thank you, your Lordship. No amount of words can express my delight in making your acquaintance. On behalf of Xiao-You, let me serve as your host for this evening.” The Great Elder was overjoyed and could not help but to crack a beaming smile on his face.

“Xiao-You?” When Mu Su heard the name, he realized there might be a mis-communication. He furrowed his brow and said: “I don’t know anyone by the name of Xiao-You.”

“What?” The Great Elder’s smile completely froze on his face once those words were spoken.

“Your Lordship…. With all due respect, did you not acknowledge you were invited by my granddaughter Ye You?”

Mu Su clarified: “I guess that’s a misunderstanding. I was invited by the young lady of the house, Miss Ye Qingtang.”

One could witness the effect of Mu Su’s jaw-dropping words literally. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

The Great Elder nearly had his eyes popping out of his head, and he actually thought that his ears were playing tricks on him.

Even Ye Ling and the Second Elder echoed his sentiments.

His Lordship came all the way here looking for Tang Tang?

Ye Xun’s face was frozen in a rictus smile as well.

“Where is Ye Qingtang?” Mu Su totally ignored the Great Elder whose face had turned sour. No one else present mattered to him, except Ye Qingtang.

The Great Elder started twitching his lips, but no words came out of it.

Ye Ling came to his senses in an instant and began looking for Ye Qingtang amongst the crowd.

And with this impeccable timing, Ye Qingtang revealed herself amidst the commotion.

“I’m here, your Lordship.” Ye Qingtang remained composed even under the daunting eyes of the Great Elder.

Mu Su felt relieved once she had shown up, but his features remained impassive.

“I’ve heard you wanted to meet up?” Mu Su mentioned her purpose in a casual tone.

Ye Qingtang nodded explicitly.

The expressions on the people’s faces only turned more complicated at this point.

Mu Su came all the way here just because Ye Qingtang wished to meet up with him?

What sort of blasphemy is this?!

The people were shocked.

Ye Ling and the Second Elder were more bewildered by Ye Qingtang’s composure even before a dignitary like Mu Su.

How did Tang Tang get acquainted with him?

The Great Elder’s face clouded over, the thrill and satisfaction from having assumed that his visit was a surprise from Ye You, were all washed away, having been replaced by this dreadful reality!

Who the hell does Ye Qingtang think she is?!

“So, Miss Ye, why do you wish to see me?” Mu Su finally showed a faint smile on his perpetually enigmatic face.

Though it was a just a smile, that was enough to shock all the guests present.

Everyone realized the fact that his Lordship had shown Ye Qingtang a smile, but acted all indifferent when the Great Elder addressed him.

Ye Qingtang swept her gaze across the confounded crowd, and over the Great Elder’s sour face, before meeting Mu Su’s eyes and said: “This young lady will like to request for your Lordship’s referral to Xuan Ling’s clan.”

Once her words were spoken, gasps of surprise filled the entire hall.

Xuan Ling’s clan was one of the prestigious exalted clans. Given its tremendous sphere of influence, to be accepted into the clan would be deemed an incredible feat.

The entry requirements to an Exalted clan not only depended on the applicant’s personal status, but also entailed a referral from a powerful personage. However, the applicant would only be granted the right to participate in its entry examination upon meeting all those requirements.
