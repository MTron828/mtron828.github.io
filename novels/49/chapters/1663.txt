Chapter 1664: Careless Words Cause Trouble (2)

Many noticed Ye Qingtang. A single glance was sufficient for them to exclaim over her beauty.

For a moment, a strange silence blanketed the entire restaurant.

Ye Qingtang did not notice. Her eyes were lowered as she considered how to pass through the threshold of the next stage. Instead, it was Jiang Shaobai who noticed that everyone’s focus had fallen on Ye Qingtang. Jiang Shaobai immediately frowned and he quickened his steps as he dragged Ye Qingtang along, before they swiftly disappeared from sight.

A beautiful girl had left, leaving behind only images of her loveliness. The youths could not help but continue gazing in her direction.

When Mu Ruxue saw this, she almost snapped the jade flute in her hand.

“Younger Sister Ruxue?” Baili Xuanyun had been observing Mu Ruxue closely, and had not seen the others leave.

Mu Ruxue bit her lips. She angrily turned her face, looking annoyed.

Who was she?

That girl only had to walk past the crowd to attract their attention. Was she any less beautiful than that girl?

Baili Xuanyun was completely befuddled by Mu Ruxue’s apparent irritation. He subconsciously looked around and saw everyone’s reaction, and the disappearing figure. His eyes flickered as comprehension dawned.

“Younger Sister Ruxue, if anyone has annoyed you, I will make her unhappy too,” Baili Xuanyun suddenly said with a smile.

Mu Ruxue frowned slightly and glanced at Baili Xuanyun. “What do you mean?”

“Younger Sister Ruxue, why compare yourself with commoners? They may be good looking, but what use is that to them? They probably won’t last more than a few more rounds. Younger Sister Ruxue, you are not only gorgeous, but also much more talented than most girls. Why compare yourself with others?” Baili Xuanyun assured her with a smile.

Baili Xuanyun word’s caused Mu Ruxue’s brow to smoothen out.

Nearby, Mu Feiruo looking on coldly, and did not say a word.

Early the next day, they drew lots as usual. Ye Qingtang drew an opponent whose abilities were similar to Lin Weiyuan, and was one of the bottom few in the Martial Arts Championship. With yesterday’s battle behind them, the worried Elder Qian and his companions were slightly more relaxed. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Jiang Yisheng drew a person whose abilities were on par with his. He glanced at Jiang Yiran’s opponent and burst out laughing.

“Haha, you’re actually fighting Mu Ruxue? Your luck is just ‘too good’!” Jiang Yisheng did not even try to hide his amusement.

With the exception of Mu Feiruo, Mu Ruxue was the most powerful person in the Mu family. Rumor had it that Mu Ruxue was as talented as Mu Feiruo. If she were not a few years younger, with her talent, she would certainly be one of the top ten, or even the top five in the Martial Arts Championship.

Even so, Mu Ruxue’s current abilities were already terrifying.

While Jiang Yisheng was in a good mood, but Jiang Yiran looked gloomy. He had not expected to draw Mu Ruxue’s lot.

Although he was confident in his own abilities, Jiang Yiran was well aware of the disparity between himself and Mu Ruxue. With Mu Ruxue’s abilities, she was probably on par with Jiang Yanyun or Jiang Shaobai.

How unlucky! Jiang Yiran felt he had been extremely unfortunate to get Mu Ruxue in the second round.

Ye Qingtang’s batch was one of the first ones, and it was soon her turn to enter the arena. Her opponent this time was similar to her previous opponent, so it was easy to beat him. Elder Qian and the others had some idea of her abilities now and were not too surprised. They felt that Ye Qingtang’s luck was pretty good, as both her opponents were not too powerful. This allowed her to have more practice as she competed in the Martial Arts Championship.
