“Wow! Look at that! Are they selling spirit animals? I have always wanted one. I must go and take a look later!” Lei Yan was a young master of a family clan. Even so, his eyes lit up as he chatted with Nangong Lie, his movements becoming clumsy with excitement at the thought of going on a shopping spree.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help feeling exasperated at those two lively brats. The others were quieter. Only those two chatted non-stop.

“Ye Qing, we will be heading to one of the residence halls later. That’s the assembly point for the various academies. Apart from us, there will be people from the other schools…” Wen Qi glanced at the teenagers behind him before speaking to Ye Qing.

The Netherworld Academy had sent quite a big team this time. This was also Ye Qing’s first time here and it was only natural for Wen Qi to offer more advice.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Universe City had four residence halls, each located on the four corners of the city. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Netherworld Academy had been assigned to the North Hall. When they arrived, several teenagers from the other academies were already coming in and out of the place.

Ye Qingtang instructed Lei Yan and the others to stay close to her. The brats followed behind her, their eyes filled with curiosity.

Males and females were separated in the building. Mu Ziying and the other teenage girls from the Netherworld Academy were sent to another section. Ye Qingtang led the remaining nine bumbling boys to another part of the building.

Lei Yan and Nangong Lie were still whispering to each other. At some point in time, Gong Jinyun and Hang Wenwei had also been dragged into their conversation, and the four of them huddled together, talking quietly.

“Damn, are those guys from the Sky Martial Academy?” Lei Yan acted like he had just discovered a new mainland. He gazed at a team of white-clad teenagers with shining eyes.

Those teenagers were only in their late teens. Making their way through the crowd of students, their white outfits made them look exceptionally striking.

“Where where?!” Nangong Lie also became very excited, sticking his head up to look.

“Is that Xiao Yihan?” Lei Yan’s eyes landed on the male leading the group.

The mention of the name Xiao Yihan made Ye Qingtang pause. She looked up to see the handsome face of the boy and saw that his eyes were cold and he exuded an aloof aura.

Ye Qingtang knew the name Xiao Yihan as she had heard of him in her previous life when she came to the Second Domain. But that would be many years later. By then, Xiao Yihan would become the top practitioner in the Second Domain and was very famous.

In her previous life, Jing Ze, whose bloodline remained sealed, would clash with Xiao Yihan many years later. The two of them once battled for three days and three nights. In the end, Jing Ze would flee in defeat.

Ye Qingtang looked in turn at Xiao Yihan, then at Jing Ze. The Jing Ze of now had awakened his bloodline under Ye Qingtang’s guidance. The tragedy that happened in her previous life would not occur.

“How high do you think Xiao Yihan’s cultivation level is now? I heard that he already reached the Divine Lord stage when he was just 12 years old. He’s a real freak. He should be about 18 or 19 now, right? Tsk tsk… how high must his cultivation level be now.” Lei Yan gaped at Xiao Yihan. He knew of Xiao Yihan because his father always talked about that genius teenager to torment him…

A Divine Lord stage at 12 years old…

The expressions of Qin Feng and the others shifted slightly at Lei Yan’s words. Everyone subconsciously turned their attention to Ran Mo.

Also a genius teenager…
