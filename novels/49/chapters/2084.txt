Chapter 2085: Temple of Paragon (1)

Before the people from the Temple of Shadows had time to process what had just happened, the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix burst through the clouds and disappeared.

“Ah Yao!” Ming Gu watched as Ye Qingtang disappeared right in front of his eyes and took off after them.

But only after a few meters, Ming Di suddenly spread open his wings and stopped him as well as Ming Wang, who had chased after him.

“Ming Di?” Ming Wang frowned at him.

“I don’t care if you die but... Mo Yao is going to be upset if you die in front of her.” Ming Di sprayed fire from his mouth as he pinned Ming Wang and Ming Wang onto the ground with his claws.

“Ming Di, let go of me!” Ming Gu said agitatedly.

Ming Di flapped his wings but showed no signs of letting them go.

“You can’t even escape from me, and you want to chase after them? Do you want to die?” Ming Di said coldly.

“Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Even I am no match for the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix, let alone the two people on its back.”

Ming Gu and Ming Di were stunned.

They had the impression all along that Ming Di was wildly arrogant, killing as he pleased in the Second Domain, with the only person he feared being the Holy Lord of Shadows.

But...

He had just admitted that he was no match for the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix.

“Ming Di is right. They’re not opponents you can take on. We don’t know yet whether it’s a good or bad thing that Mo Yao has been taken, but you will both die if you chase after them,” Mi said as he got up.

“Who are they?” Ming Wang’s eyes were helpless as he lay pinned to the ground.

Mi lifted his head slightly to look into the distance.

“The Temple of Paragon.”

The four words flowed out of Mi’s mouth.

Making Ming Wang freeze in an instant.

Ming Di sensed the change in him and quickly let him go.

However, Ming Gu had no idea who they were. Once he was free, he quickly grabbed Ming Wang and flew after Ye Qingtang. But this time, it was Ming Wang who grabbed his wrist and held him back.

“Brother?” Ming Gu looked at Ming Wang with a strange expression.

Ming Wang didn’t say anything, only holding his brother’s wrist tightly and not letting him leave.

“Are you sure?” Ming Wang looked at Mi before his searching eyes landed on Ming Di.

Ming Di spoke. “I don’t recognize the two people on its back but I remember the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix. I fought three days and three nights with it and came out defeated in the end. After that, I heard that it had moved to the Temple of Paragon. It seems like Mi is telling the truth.”

There was no way Ming Di would’ve talked about his defeat if he wasn’t afraid that Ming Wang was going to die if he went after them. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

All those years ago, Ming Di had been wreaking havoc all over the place, not holding any regard for any other creatures. But he had accidentally disturbed the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix’s rest.

He had made it sound nicer, saying that they had battled for three days and three nights.

But in reality...

He was the one who had been hunted by the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix for three days and three nights and almost died under the Six-Winged Fire Phoenix’s fire.

“The Temple of Paragon? What’s that? Brother, why aren’t you going after Ah Yao?” Ming Gu tried to get free but it was useless.

Ming Wang’s expression was extremely grim.

“The Temple of Paragon is the top power in the Second Domain. Any single one of them can destroy the entire First Domain.” Ming Wang’s voice was helpless.
