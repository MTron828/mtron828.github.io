It wasn’t that Elder Qian lacked confidence in Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai, but that this Martial Arts Championship was extremely important to the Jiang family. If they fell flat on their faces again, they would end up the laughingstock of all the other clans.

The only way to help the Jiang family regain their status was to have at least two members in the top ten.

By his side, Jiang Shaobai and Jiang Yanyun listened quietly and impassively.

“Oh yes, where is Ye Qingtang?” Elder Qian surveyed the surroundings after instructing the two of them.

Although he had no expectations of Ye Qingtang breaking into the top ten, it was still a highly-coveted opportunity to be able to compete against the top fighters of all the clans. It was not an opportunity that Ye Qingtang could afford to miss.

Jiang Shaobai yawned and shook his head.

“Never mind. Take care of yourselves. I will scope out the situation.” With that, Elder Qian turned and left.

Meanwhile, Jiang Yiran, Jiang Yisheng and the rest of the Jiang family youths were already gathered at one side. Several of the youths frowned when they noticed that Ye Qingtang was nowhere to be seen.

“Don’t tell me Ye Qingtang is planning to back out?”

“It’s probably that she doesn’t dare to show up. Her words that day were all just false bravado. She must be scared witless on the inside. Didn’t you notice that she hasn’t even stepped out of the house the past few days?”

“What the hell. Baili Xuanyun would never let things go if she reneges on her word. There are still some days to go after this. Don’t tell me she is really going to betray us to the Baili Clan and Mu family just to save her own skin?”

The Jiang family youths grumbled on unhappily. Since that day when Ye Qingtang had promised to challenge Baili Xuanyun, she had gained a modicum of respect from them. But the day of the challenge had arrived and Ye Qingtang had yet to show her face. Was she going to play them out?

“You bunch of cowards. You dare to call yourselves members of the Jiang family? Just a few threats from Baili Xuanyun and you are so scared that you are willing to betray your own clan. You guys are the real selfish ones.” Jiang Yiran stared coldly at those youths.

“Yiran, you can’t say that. This matter has nothing to do with us. Why should we be targeted by the two major clans just because of Ye Qingtang?”

“Stop your bullsh*t. The elders already made it very clear to you. I was the cause of this entire matter and Ye Qingtang was implicated by me. If you want someone to blame, blame it on me,” Jiang Yiran said.

“Yiran, now is not the time to split hairs. Baili Xuanyun clearly wants to vent his anger on Ye Qingtang. Even if the whole thing started because of you, Ye Qingtang was the one who injured Mu Ruxue...” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jiang Yiran could no longer endure listening to the excuses spouted by those youths. He felt a wave of disgust as he looked at the so-called brothers of his clan.

No wonder outsiders claimed that the latest generation of the Jiang family were all weaklings. They were all-too-willing to betray friends for their own benefit. They were utterly heartless.

Jiang Yiran was about to continue arguing with them when Jiang Yanyun held his shoulder to stop him.

“Brother Yun...”

“I will challenge Baili Xuanyun as agreed. Baili Xuanyun might not have the energy to fight Ye Qingtang after our battle, so there’s no need to argue over this now.” This was one of the rare times that Jiang Yanyun had spoken.

In reality, Jiang Yanyun already knew that Baili Xuanyun had led members from the two clans to stir up trouble with the Jiang family. This act had touched a nerve with Jiang Yanyun.

“Brother Yun, it’s all my fault for bringing so much trouble to you.” Jiang Yiran felt very guilty.
