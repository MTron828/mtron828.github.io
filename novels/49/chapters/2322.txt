Chapter 2323: New Students Report (1)

After Ye Qingtang left, Wu Fengling looked at Wen Qi, who could not conceal his own wide smile.

“How about that? I have brought you a real treasure this time, right?”

Wu Fengling smiled. “Indeed, you have good judgment.”

Wen Qi raised his brows smugly.

And he had every right to feel smug. To be able to produce five Divine Lord stage students within just a few months. Who could claim to have that ability? Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After today’s selection trials, news of Ye Qing, Qin Feng and the others spread across the entire Netherworld Academy. Everyone was discussing them, even those who had not gone to watch the matches.

After knowing that even students like Lei Yan and Jing Ze had become Divine Lord stage practitioners, quite a few students clenched their fists with such intense envy that they nearly crushed the edges of the table.

Why didn’t they have the good fortune to meet such a teacher!

But very soon, someone spread the news that the President had decided to pick a few more students to be under Ye Qing, to undergo special training for the Inter-Academy Competition.

Naturally, only the top 50 would have that honor.

Another wave of jealousy washed over the student body. They felt angry at themselves for not working harder to squeeze into the top 50. Meanwhile, those top 50 students were on cloud nine, all waiting to see if they would be one of the lucky ones.

Five Divine Lord stage practitioners. What kind of effective rate was that? If they could train under Ye Qing, wouldn’t they soon ascend to the Divine Lord level too?

That night, Ye Qingtang was celebrating with Lei Yan and the rest, drinking wine and eating roast meat when Luo Sheng hurried over with a few teenagers.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“Greetings, Teacher Ye.” Ran Mo grinned as he bowed respectfully at Ye Qing. His neck was still bandaged.

Qin Feng, “…”

“Greetings, Teacher Ye.” The student formerly ranked number eight, Qiu Nan, also bowed shyly.

Jing Ze, “…”

“Greetings, Teacher Ye.” Gong Jinyun couldn’t conceal his smile. He gave a deep bow.

Nangong Lie, “…”

“Greetings, Teacher Ye.” Hang Wenwei was smiling radiantly. Before even finishing his greeting, he was already bowing down low.

Lei Yan exclaimed. “Damn! What’s going on? Have you all come for revenge?”

“No, no, no. Brother, you misunderstand. We have come to pay respects to our new teacher. From today onwards until the end of the Inter-Academy Competition, we will be brothers under the same teacher. In future, we will all be under Teacher Ye.” Hang Wenwei explained with a smile.

Lei Yan was stunned.

Qin Feng and the rest were also stupefied.

Apart from Meng Yao, who was not qualified, and Qin Xuan, who had been beaten to a pulp, all the other teenagers who had sparred with Ye Qingtang’s brats today had been sent over by Luo Sheng.

“Teacher Luo Sheng, they…” Ye Qingtang looked at Luo Sheng.

Was this what she thought it was?

“As Hang Wenwei said, we will have to trouble you to teach them during this period.” Luo Sheng smiled.

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Luo Sheng added. “Of course, if you are not satisfied, you can decline to teach them. We will choose others.”

Wu Fengling had selected these few because they had sparred with Ye Qing’s students. Ye Qing must have watched the matches and would have a good understanding of their skills.

Ye Qing remained silent. Hang Wenwei and the others knew that their fate lay entirely in Ye Qing’s hands, and they immediately begged to be accepted.

“Teacher Ye, I have always admired your teaching. Please accept me. I will be hardworking and will not let you down!” Gong Jinyun put on a pleading look.

Hang Wenwei was even more ingratiating. He poured a cup of tea and kneeled in front of Ye Qing.

“Master, please have this tea.”
