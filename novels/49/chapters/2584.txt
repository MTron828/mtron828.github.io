Translator: Atlas StudiosEditor: Atlas Studios

Compared to the Divine Venerate Domain, the level of the martial arts culture in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain was indeed inferior. Although there were many Emperor-level experts and Immortal Emperors in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, their numbers were still much fewer compared to the

Divine Venerate Domain. Their skills quality was also inferior.

“Divine Lord level.” Ye Qingtang answered truthfully.

“Oh.”

Father Feng’s eyes lit up.

Ye Qingtang found Father Feng’s expression rather strange. A Divine Lord should be considered only an ordinary cultivator to the Divine Venerate Domain.

For example, Feng Jiuyou and the rest had already entered the Divine Lord stage at such a young age. If they were in the Second Domain, they would be considered extremely formidable. There were probably only a handful of 12-13-year-old Divine Lords in the entire Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

Of course, there had been an Eight Heaven level Divine Lord in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain who was only about 10 years old. But that was an exception and not the norm.

Ye Qingtang followed Feng Jiuyou to the guest room.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang had been in the Feng family residence for two days.

During those two days, Ye Qingtang did not remain idle. She had already scouted everything that needed to be investigated.

Ye Qingtang was at the bottom of the mountain called Mt. Zhong. This place belonged to the north of the Divine Venerate Domain and there were many small factions within a radius of hundreds of kilometers. The Feng family was one of them.

Furthermore, in Mt. Zhong, the other races were the most powerful. Although the Feng family had many Divine Lords, the family’s strength and status were at the bottom of the hierarchy in Mt. Zhong.

Over the past two days, Ye Qingtang managed to gather only this bit of information. As for how she could leave this era and obtain the energy of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao, she did not have a clue. All in all, this made Ye Qingtang feel rather helpless.

In the current situation, Ye Qingtang could only take things one step at a time. In this strange era where martial arts flourished and demons thrived, with Ye Qingtang’s skill level, there was not much that she could not do. She was like a lonely boat in the sea, drifting along with the waves.

At noon.

In the guest room, Ye Qingtang slowly opened her eyes and a red light flashed across her brows.

“Seventh Heaven level Divine Lord…”

Ye Qingtang was amazed. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

It had only been two days since she came to this strange era but Ye Qingtang’s cultivation level had already broken through from the Fifth Heaven level to the Seventh!

This speed was unbelievable to Ye Qingtang.

According to the norm, if she was in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, it would take at least half a year for her to break through from the Fifth to the Sixth Heaven level. If she was unlucky, it might even take several years or decades.

However, in just two days after arriving at this era… Ye Qingtang actually advanced two consecutive levels to the Seventh Heaven level Divine Lord.

Even Ye Qingtang found it hard to believe. No one would believe her if she told them. It was just too ridiculous.

“What’s going on?”

Ye Qingtang sat on the couch with a strange expression.

Ye Qingtang lowered her head and looked at her heart.

The seal that the Divine Phoenix had placed on the Heart of Heavenly Dao was already very loose. Even if the Heart of Heavenly Dao was not absorbing her cultivation and limiting her growth, it would still be impossible for her to reach the Seventh Heaven level so quickly.

Ye Qingtang closed her eyes and examined herself. Something must have gone wrong..
