After a long time, the corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly. She looked at Long Yun and said with a smile, “Senior, of course I’m willing. I am from the Blue Sky Domain which has a low-grade martial arts culture. I’m already very satisfied to be able to see the martial arts scene in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. If the Dragon Emperor Clan is willing to have me, I am willing to do anything…”

Long Yun nodded and said, “That’s good. Don’t worry, Ye Qingtang. The Fifth Heaven level Divine Lord will definitely not be your peak now that you are here at the Dragon Emperor Clan.”

“Senior… I am naturally aware of the Dragon Emperor Clan’s capabilities. However, I have a private matter to attend to. If possible, I will return to the Dragon Emperor Clan after settling my private affairs. Is that okay?” Ye Qingtang’s expression was natural.

“Oh, you have something private to settle?” Long Yun seemed to be deep in thought. “Why don’t you tell me what it is? If you have any requests, the Dragon Emperor Clan will take care of it.”

“Senior, this is my personal matter. Moreover, I have not joined the Dragon Emperor Clan yet, so it’s not convenient for me to trouble you. I will be able to settle my personal matters in about half a month.” Ye Qingtang immediately rejected Long Yun’s suggestion. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

The more Long Yun behaved in such a manner, the more Ye Qingtang would not want to join the Dragon Emperor Clan. At the very least, she would not want to stay here before her cultivation level had risen enough so that she could protect herself.

Furthermore, the Ancient God Karma Tunnel had already opened. Even though the big yellow dog said the karma power was too intense now, no major force had discovered the tunnel yet. Even if she had to take some risks, Ye Qingtang wanted to try it out first.

Ye Qingtang had already made up her mind that no matter what, it was not convenient for her to stay in the Dragon Emperor Clan now. If things did not work out for her, she would have no choice but to use the power of the Deity Ocean to escape.

However, the elder unexpectedly nodded after pondering for a moment. “Forget it, Miss Ye is right. You are not yet a disciple of the Dragon Emperor Clan. Since Miss Ye has a private matter to see to, we’ll discuss this matter after you settle it.”

“Thank you, Senior…” Surprise flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at Long Yun. She thought that the white-haired elder would definitely not let her leave. Who knew that he would actually agree.

“Also.” Long Yun reached into his pocket and took out a token. He handed it to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang instinctively accepted the token and examined it. The token was made of pure gold and it was cold to the touch. The word “clan” was carved on both sides of the token.

“Miss Ye, this is a token of Dragon Emperor Clan disciples. If you encounter any trouble, you can present this token,” Long Yun explained.

“Thank you, Senior.” Ye Qingtang kept the token.

Ye Qingtang thought that the white-haired elder was afraid that the Sky Vault Sect would continue to find trouble with her, so he gave her this token that only the disciples of the Dragon Emperor Clan could possess.

“Miss Ye, it’s still daylight. If you’re in a hurry, you can leave the mountain now,” Long Yun said.

After Long Yun left, Ye Qingtang finally heaved a sigh of relief. Regardless of whether the Dragon Emperor Clan had ulterior motives for keeping her, they had treated her quite well so far. It was surprising that they had even given her a token.

“Little girl, have you thought it through? Are you going to enter the Ancient God Karma Tunnel now?” The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang.
