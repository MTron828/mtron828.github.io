The exit had never disappeared before.

Zhan Rao punched the ice mountain in disbelief, creating a seemingly endless tunnel in front of them. But enshrouded in the frosty darkness, the exit remained nowhere to be seen.

“The exit is really gone. What’s happening with the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm this time?” Sang Feiyu could feel that something was amiss with the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm this time as well.

The relentless cold and vanishing exit didn’t bode well for them.

“I can’t stand this anymore. It’s too cold here.” Wu Xiao’s face was already purple from the cold. He was ranked the lowest among the ten of them, though he was already at the mid-stage of the Fourth Heaven. Even so, it wasn’t enough to stave off the cruel, biting chill.

“If any of you have any Dharma treasures, please use it now. This cold is too extreme and we’re going to freeze to death if we don’t have a Dharma treasure to protect ourselves!” Sang Feiyu said darkly.

They had all already ascended to the highly respected Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate Realm. No one was going to believe it if they froze to death here.

With Sang Feiyu’s reminder, they quickly took out the various Dharma treasures they had with them.

But they were all stunned as they reached for their treasures.

“My Flame Cloak... it’s gone?” Wu Xiao’s expression turned ugly as he held out a dull red cloak.

The once-blazingly hot cloak froze immediately as he took it out. There wasn’t a bit of warmth left in it.

It wasn’t the only item subjected to this phenomenon. They soon realized that their treasures were useless here, mere pieces of jewelry.

With the inescapable cold, and now their useless Dharma treasures, these things were raining blow after blow on their gradually-declining morale. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Even the self-assured Zhan Rao, along with everyone else who had entered the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm before, now all had ugly expression on their faces.

They had all thought that their experience would help them gain an edge over Ye Qingtang and the rest, but now they all looked like fools.

“You’re cold?” The little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms shook his ears and lifted his eyes to look at Ye Qingtang, whose lashes were already frozen.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Why don’t I feel cold then?” the little white tiger asked.

Rather than just not being cold, the little white tiger had not felt that the temperature was any different from when it was outside at all.

How could Ye Qingtang and the rest of them look like they were freezing to death in such warm temperatures?

Listening to the little white tiger, Ye Qingtang realized that it was unusually warm in her arms, as though it had completely not been affected by the temperatures of the place. She wrapped it closer to her subconsciously to warm herself up.

“Hmph, now you know how amazing I am right? Forget it, the mighty me shall yield to you and let you warm yourself.” As he declared that, the little white tiger shook his whiskers proudly. His entire demeanor was extremely annoying and deserving of a thrashing.

“Ye Qingtang, “...”

“Elder Sister Qing, if you feel cold, you can try circulating spirit energy within yourself,” Jiang Shaobai said.

Jiang Shaobai’s reminder gave Ye Qingtang a sudden realization.

She would be able to raise her temperature rapidly if she circulated the spirit energy within herself, but this method meant that she would have to do it constantly and it would also slow her down.
