Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In at most ten breaths’ time, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder were encircled by the blood-colored giant rats.

The Blood Moon Elder could not help but shudder at the sight. Looking at the blood-red rats in their surroundings, he counted at least dozens of them.

It would be fine if there were merely fierce beasts on the land. However, there were still numerous, densely-packed flying ants in the sky. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

At this instant, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder had no means of escaping. Apart from thinking of a way to kill the blood rat and flying ants, there was no other way out.

“Holy Lady, I’ll cover you. You can escape first!” After killing a blood mouse, the Blood Moon Elder told Ye Qingtang.

However, there was no reaction from Ye Qingtang.

After a moment, Ye Qingtang finally spoke. “Leave with me!”

Then, Ye Qingtang grabbed the little white tiger which was still chewing happily and raced towards the cave ahead.

The Blood Moon Elder was stunned seeing that Ye Qingtang actually had run back into the cave they were previously hiding in.

There was only one exit for that cave, and it did not lead to anywhere. Why did Ye Qingtang not go to make a run for it instead of searching for a dead end?

However, the current Blood Moon Elder did not have time to overthink and followed behind Ye Qingtang instinctively.

“Holy Lady, if we hide in this cave, won’t we be like turtles in a jar that will certainly be caught? This is a dead end!” the Blood Moon Elder said immediately as he looked at the unhurried Ye Qingtang.

“Why are you so anxious?” Ye Qingtang asked calmly.

“Why am I so anxious?” The Blood Moon Elder looked out from the cave.

Currently, those blood mice had already swarmed up, which meant that they were trapped in the cave. Wasn’t this courting death…

“Holy Lady, those fierce beasts are here!” After a moment, the Blood Moon Elder was on guard for all possible dangers. Although he wanted to leave this cave, Ye Qingtang had not said anything, and he did not dare to leave.

As he saw that the blood rats closed in on them like the tide, the Blood Moon Elder’s forehead was dripping with cold sweat.

However, at this instant.

Boom, boom!!

A loud sound erupted.

All they saw was a blood rat charging into the cave instantly.

It was, however, that the size of the cave entrance was limited, and the blood rat’s body was too huge. Thus, only its upper body was able to fit through the entrance while its lower body was stuck outside the cave.

Although dozens of blood rats and flying ants surged toward them, they were all stuck outside the cave as they let out frightening cries.

Roar!

The blood rat which had its upper body stuck in the cave glared at Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder with eyes that invoked fear.

“This can also work…” The Blood Moon Elder was shocked.

The situation earlier on was urgent, and he could not think calmly. Yet, Ye Qingtang could still remain calm at this stage and even analyze that the beasts were too big to fit inside the cave.

“F*ck you… How dare you pieces of trash think of killing me?!”

Wagging its tail, the little white tiger strutted to the front of the blood rat and sized it up.

Roar!

The blood rat glared at the little white tiger fiercely while shouting. Its tiny paws scratched on the ground continuously, seeming to want to tear the little white tiger into pieces.

“Someone kill it. I have not eaten my fill!”

The little white tiger turned around to look at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Get lost!” The Blood Moon Elder scoffed.

“F*ck you! I signed an equality contract with your Holy Lady. You listen to her but dare not to listen to mine? Do you wish to die?” The little white tiger laughed coldly.

“You…”

The Blood Moon Elder pointed at the little white tiger. Before he could say anything though, a blood-colored sword shadow appeared behind him.
