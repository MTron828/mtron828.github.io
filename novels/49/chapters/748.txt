Chapter 749: Get The Hell Out (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The disciples who followed Li Jingwen to Admirable Sky Peak today recounted Li Jingwen’s impressive manner to their fellow disciples, who listened with great interest.

“Luckily, that Ye Chen is not in the valley today. Otherwise, if Eldest Senior Brother shot a look at him, he would probably pee in his pants from fear.”

“Haha… It really is like what Eldest Senior Brother said. Admirable Sky Peak disciples are merely like that…”

Just as the Blue Cloud Peak disciples were gathered together, a figure suddenly arrived at Blue Cloud Peak.

Those disciples who were still chatting immediately stopped talking when they saw the elegant figure in front of them.

“Ye Chen!” A Blue Cloud Peak disciple who was beaten up by Ye Qingtang before recognized Ye Qingtang with a look.

Then, the Blue Cloud Peak disciples looked at Ye Qingtang with daggers in their eyes.

“Ye Chen, what are you doing here at Blue Cloud Peak?”

“Why? Have you thought it through? Do you know that you’re in the wrong already? So you came here to apologize?”

“Haha… You’re sensible. If you still don’t know what’s good for you, our Eldest Senior Brother will ‘take good care’ of you.”

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples were extremely arrogant. Looking at Ye Qingtang who came to them herself, they immediately thought that she was frightened out of her wits by their Eldest Senior Brother’s actions and that she rushed over frantically to apologize.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blue Cloud Peak disciples coldly, and a slight sneer seemed to play on her lips.

“Where’s Li Jingwen?”

“Fellow, you wish to meet our Eldest Senior Brother? Do you have the qualifications to?”

“Since you’re here to apologize, you should have an apologetic attitude. Where do you think this is? This is Blue Cloud Peak. We don’t care whose disciple you are. In our Blue Cloud Peak, who do you think you are? How dare you call our Eldest Senior Brother’s name!”

A few Blue Cloud Peak disciples remarked cynically.

Hearing the Blue Cloud Peak disciples’ scorns from afar, Yan Shu picked up his pace and hurried to Ye Qingtang’s side.

“Junior Brother Ye.”

He originally intended for Ye Qingtang to apologize to Li Jingwen and those Blue Cloud Peak disciples symbolically, but he did not expect Ye Qingtang to go to Blue Cloud Peak personally. The scornful comments of those Blue Cloud Peak disciples were especially jarring, and he only hoped that Ye Qingtang could put an end to this matter quickly. This matter would be over if she just endured it for a moment.

However…

Ye Qingtang swept a cold glance at those incessant Blue Cloud Peak disciples, and a glint passed her eyes. “Tell Li Jingwen to get the hell out.”

The Blue Cloud Peak disciples were stunned to hear what Ye Qingtang said.

Even Yan Shu’s face froze for a moment as well.

She…

What did she say? Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Tell Li Jingwen to get the hell out?

Is she not here to apologize?

Yan Shu sensed that there seemed to be something wrong, but before he could say anything, the Blue Cloud Peak disciples exploded in anger.

“What a great Ye Chen! How dare you speak so wildly in our Blue Cloud Peak! Your skin must be really itching!”

“Why? Your Admirable Sky Peak disciples are not beaten up enough by our Eldest Senior Brother? You’re here to ask for a beating?”

They had seen people who did not want their lives anymore, but not one who was so hurried to court death.

This Ye Chen was actually so bold to provoke them on their Blue Cloud Peak turf!

Then, the Blue Cloud Peak disciples’ expression darkened immediately, and they immediately charged at Ye Qingtang with swords wielded in their hands.
