Chapter 2663 I’m Here To Kill You (8)

“This...”

Ye Qingtang frowned deeply. As the power of the Great Dao circulated, the restraint this domain had on her inexplicably loosened and her senses gradually recovered.

“Can the power of the Great Dao cushion this domain’s restraints...” Ye Qingtang pondered. Ye Qingtang at Han Cangming and the Paragon. The destructive power in Han Cangming’s eyes had already condensed to extreme limits. It could pierce through the body of the Paragon at any moment. Such terrifying destructive power was enough to destroy the body of the Paragon. “Sister Ah Yao!”

Ye Qingtang called out to the Paragon.

However, in this domain space, the Paragon had lost her senses and could not move her body. Ye Qingtang’s warning was useless.

Seeing that the Paragon was in imminent danger, Ye Qingtang could not just sit back and do nothing. Raising her hand, a long whip formed by the power of the Great Dao materialized. The long whip was covered in a snow-white luster.

Without any hesitation, Ye Qingtang swung the long whip at Han Cangming.

Swoosh!

With the support of the power of the Great Dao, the whip’s speed was extremely fast, especially in this domain. It appeared as a white flash.

Smack!

The long whip formed by the power of the Great Dao ruthlessly whipped Han Cangming’s face. This sudden change seemed to catch Han Cangming off guard. Blood trickled down his face.

Crash!

The sound of glass shattering.

The domain shattered and collapsed. As the domain shattered, the Paragon returned to normal and she retreated immediately. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Sister Ye Yue... Well done!” The Paragon looked at Ye Qingtang and was stunned to see the change in her appearance.

However, before the Paragon could ponder any further, Han Cangming attacked her again.

Han Cangming’s attacks became increasingly fierce. The Paragon, who had yet to fully recover, found it increasingly difficult to deal with Han Cangming’s attacks.

Swoosh!

However, Ye Qingtang was not idle. Whenever she had the opportunity, she would use the power of the Great Dao to whip at Han Cangming from time to time.

“Sister Ye Yue, don’t attack!”

The Paragon reminded Ye Qingtang.

If Han Cangming suddenly switched his target to Ye Qingtang, it would be difficult for Ye Qingtang to defend herself with her inferior martial art skills. The Paragon did not want Ye Qingtang to be implicated in this battle. The power of the domain had not completely dissipated and she could barely protect herself now. If Han Cangming suddenly attacked Ye Qingtang, she might not be able to provide timely support. “Can you stop?”

After a while, Han Cangming’s gaze suddenly landed on Ye Qingtang.

“Your opponent is me.”

The Paragon thought that Han Cangming was going to attack Ye Qingtang and immediately struck out with her palm.

In the next instant, the two of them started battling again.

“This can’t go on...” Ye Qingtang frowned deeply.

The effects of the domain just now were just too great on the Paragon. She probably would not be able to recover from it so soon. Even though she had increased the strength of her martial art greatly, it was still insignificant in the face of a battle between Immortal Emperors.

However, even if she were to leave now and find the Great Immortal Temple camp, the people of the Great Immortal Temple would definitely not become enemies with the Demon God Han Cangming just because of the Paragon, whom they did not even know...
