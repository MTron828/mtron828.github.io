Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

While Ye Qingtang was analyzing Jing Ze, her Devouring Bloodline was suddenly triggered. The moment her Devouring Bloodline was triggered, Ye Qingtang felt that some energy was gradually being awakened inside Jing Ze’s body.

It was the power of a bloodline. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang could feel that very clearly, and she was startled by this discovery.

“I thought you... don’t have a bloodline?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Huh?” Jing Ze was taken aback.

Ye Qingtang stared at Jing Ze. “Some bloodlines will not emerge right after birth. They need a certain external trigger to be awakened. I detected a very mysterious bloodline aura inside your body just now. I think that you might have a bloodline but that it is more special and needs to be activated.”

This kind of situation was quite rare. But 300 years into the future, there would be many different ways to awaken a bloodline.

“Do you wish to activate your bloodline?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Dazed, Jing Ze immediately nodded at her question.

“Yes!”

Ye Qingtang smiled. “It is not an easy task. At the very least, you will have to re-learn all your martial arts foundation techniques.”

Three hundred years into the future, many family clans would have their descendants practice a special kind of technique from a young age, to avoid having a bloodline remain dormant. This kind of technique was very complicated but as long as one practiced it properly, any kind of bloodline could be awakened.

This was common knowledge in the future. But at this present time, practitioners had yet to discover this technique.

Ye Qingtang told Jing Ze about the technique to activate his bloodline.

Jing Ze listened very attentively. He was worried about missing out on a single word.

Ye Qingtang observed Jing Ze’s studious manner and couldn’t help feeling rather satisfied. No matter what kind of bloodline this good boy had, as long as they awakened it, it would be a great help to his current situation.

In addition...

If Ye Qingtang told him about all those martial art techniques from 300 years into the future, she believed that he would improve even further.

What Ye Qingtang didn’t know was that her current actions had changed Jing Ze’s destiny completely. And after Jing Ze’s bloodline was awakened, she would be the one who would be the most shocked...

Teaching Jing Ze was like a revision exercise for Ye Qingtang herself. When she was in the First Domain, she had faced danger from all sides and could not concentrate on cultivating. Now that she was in the Netherworld Academy and teaching Jing Ze, she could also try all those cultivation techniques which she didn’t get the chance to try in her previous life...

Perhaps it might bring about a major boost to her abilities.

As Ye Qingtang and Jing Ze worked on the cultivation of their martial art, those teenagers who had left the classroom seemed oblivious to what was happening.

“Even if the Netherworld Academy wants to chase us out, they don’t have to stoop to such low tactics, right? What kind of teacher is that? A Paragon Sixth Heaven level? What a joke!” Lei Yan ranted angrily.

In reality, few of them were on the Netherworld Academy’s blacklist. If things went on as they were, this group would soon be kicked out of the academy.

“Why has Jing Ze not come out? Don’t tell me he is really going to listen to that punk?” Nangong Lie scanned the group and realized that Jing Ze had stayed behind.

“Jing Ze is a piece of trash himself. There’s nothing wrong with him being with another trash. The two of them complement each other.” Lei Yan yawned. A figure walked past him and his expression shifted.
