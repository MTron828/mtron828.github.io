Chapter 83: Flirting is a Skilled Task (2)

Highness?

Once Ye Qingtang heard Mu Su’s salutation, her heart sank.

Other than being the Marquis of the City of Luoxing, Mu Su was also renowned for his allegiance to the Temple of Ancient Splendor.

The Temple of Ancient Splendor, the world’s living metaphor for the untouchable realm, where supreme cultivators congregated.

Legend has it that for thousands of years, the Temple stood tall at the center of the entire continent. Its lineage of Imperators all possessed fearsome powers beyond imagination. Even Exalted Clans were poised to pay homage to the Temple.

The Temple manifested itself as the world’s apex, an unshakable fact acknowledged by the populace. But a more amazing fact was, throughout history, only its Imperator was recognized as a member. Even dignitaries such as Mu Su, were not accepted and could only serve as the Temple’s vassal.

Nonetheless, this one-man temple was still worshipped by the people.

The Imperator of the Temple, whose identity and prowess were both equally unfathomable, rarely made an appearance in public, but was still regarded as the most powerful cultivator in the world. Therefore, even Ye Qingtang, who had lived for three centuries in her past, never came across the Imperator.

But at the moment, what really weighed down on her, was the Heart of the Demon Emperor within her!

The turmoil brought about by the demon emperor’s heart was still fresh in her mind. Though she had a clear grasp on its method of concealment, but if the person before her was truly the Imperator, even she could not be certain it would not be detected.

If it was ever found out, given her current strength, death would be her only option! Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Her pleasant mood plummeted, turning into stress and anxiety that came crashing down on her. She initially expected Mu Su was only going to introduce her to one of his acquaintances, but to think…

If she knew that person was going to be the Imperator, she would never have agreed to come!

Han Cangming remained seated within the inner chambers. The mystic veil he had erected served as a tinted window, though shrouding himself from others, it did not impede his surveillance and allowed him to observe Ye Qingtang’s features vividly, even at a couple of meters away.

The candlelight accentuated the girl’s refined features, caressing the contours of her slightly lowered face and gleamed gently upon her glistening eyes that were seemingly devoid of any emotions.

Han Cangming swept his gaze across her, his lucid eyes hinted at his subtle contemplation of the inconceivable.

Mu Su, who stood by after giving his salutation, did not notice Ye Qingtang’s sudden anxiety and patiently awaited his Highness to make her acquaintance, however…

A few moments passed and not a word could be heard from him.

Mu Su became dumbfounded on the spot.

What’s going on?

He had gone through all the trouble of enticing Ye Qingtang to this meeting, why did his Highness act like a totally wound down clockwork?

Say something dammit!

Mu Su was like a cat on a hot tin roof, dying to reach out to his Highness and remind him fervently of this meeting’s purpose. But conferring that brazenly in front of any girl would certainly turn the girl off. Thus, he had no choice but to rein himself in.

He turned his attention to Ye Qingtang next and noticed her uneasiness, that ultimately added onto his own.

Your highness, at this rate, you’re going to scare the living daylights out of her! Can’t you see the poor girl has turned all pale!

Although Mu Su did figure out that his silence was nerve wrecking, however he could never guess that was mainly due to Ye Qingtang’s fear that the prolonged silence indicated that his Highness might have caught onto her secret.

Mu Su could not bear to watch the situation get anymore awkward, in order to keep the conversation going, he had no choice but to repeat what he had related previously: “Your highness, Miss Ye has quite an extraordinary spirit root, one that reemerged after shattering her original. I’m incapable of discerning its cause and effect, and to prevent her from heeding a wrong advice, I’ve brought her before your competent self, for your expertise on this matter.”
