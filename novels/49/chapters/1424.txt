1425 Misunderstanding 3

They were given for free anyways, and she might as well consume them. Thus, Ye Qingtang swiftly gulped down a few bottles.

Elder Xu heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that Ye Qingtang finally consumed the medicine.

“My sworn brother…” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly as she looked at Beidou Demon Lord, who was hit unconscious.

Elder Xu immediately took out some elixirs and medicines. “Thank god for this little fellow from the ape clan this time. Otherwise…”

If he realized that he accidentally killed a Jiang Family child who possessed the Heavenly Demon Bloodline variant, he would never forgive himself his whole life. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Elder Xu was more favorable of Beidou Demon Lord now and fed him some elixirs, treating his injuries.

The Jiang Family’s elixirs were extremely powerful, and Beidou Demon Lord’s complexion returned to normal in no time. He woke up drowsily and suddenly saw Elder Xu right before him. Startled, he hurriedly guarded in front of Ye Qingtang, seeming as though he was protecting a calf.

“Little brother from the ape clan, Ye Qingtang is a child of the Jiang Family. Everything just now was a misunderstanding.” On the account that Beidou Demon Lord saved Ye Qingtang’s life, Elder Xu spoke to him with rare patience.

“Misunderstanding? You clearly wanted to kill her just now!” The straightforward Beidou Demon Lord did not believe Elder Xu at all.

Elder Xu had a slight headache as well. Had he not experienced it for himself, he would not believe that the person he wanted to kill a second ago would become his own clan member in the next second either.

“It is child’s play to kill both of you with my skills. Why would I fabricate such a lie?”

“You humans are the most cunning. Who knows if you schemed anything else?” Beidou Demon Lord was more astute now.

Elder Xu responded in a low voice. “The Jiang Family is the Domain Monarch’s clan. Why would we scheme against you two? The Heavenly Demon Bloodline in this girl is evidence that she is a descendant of the Jiang Family.”

Beidou Demon Lord was slightly taken aback. He did hear of the Jiang Family’s Heavenly Demon Bloodline before but did not think that…

“Little sister, do you really have the Heavenly Demon Bloodline?” Beidou Demon Lord looked at Ye Qingtang doubtfully.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Beidou Demon Lord’s eyes popped wide.

It should be so if she really had the Heavenly Demon Bloodline.

“Girl, your sworn brother’s injuries will heal after some rest. I will bring you back to the Jiang Family first. That is where your house is. The Domain Monarch will be elated to see you.” Elder Xu looked at Ye Qingtang so compassionately that the past cold and murderous expression was completely absent.

“I can follow you back to the Jiang Family, but my sworn brother must come with me. He was injured in order to save me.” Ye Qingtang was very insistent on this.

Although she was misidentified by the Jiang Family, Beidou Demon Lord did not have any relations with the Jiang Family. Given Ye You’s character, she would probably trouble him in the future.

“Alright.” Elder Xu nodded slightly in admiration of Ye Qingtang’s loyalty.

When facing her as an enemy, she was simply an eyesore, but after knowing that she belonged to the Jiang Family, she was nothing but a pleasant child.

After discussions, Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord followed Elder Xu to the Jiang Family.

At this instant, Ye Qingtang was extremely looking forward to Ye You’s reaction after seeing her.

The Domain Monarch’s Jiang clan was renowned in the Central Mainland.

Ye You and Ye Xun returned earlier and were currently in the hall of the Jiang Residence.

In the hall, a middle-aged man was looking at them with slightly furrowed brows.
