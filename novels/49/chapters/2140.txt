Chapter 2141: Indignant (3)

“What about Mu Ziying?” Ye Qingtang suddenly remembered the little girl who sat in the corner in silence, clutching a tattered cloth doll.

Jing Ze looked rather grim and he was silent for a moment. “Mu Ziying, I... I don’t know much about her. She only came to the academy half a year ago.”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Inside the martial arts faculty compound, Lei Yan was sneaking a break in the practice arena. Several teenagers from the Leiting family glanced at him. They didn’t say anything but a flash of condescension appeared in their eyes.

“Lei Yan, we heard that you were assigned a new teacher a few days ago?” One of the teenagers who was often at odds with Lei Yan walked over with a group of seven to eight other guys.

Lei Yan lifted his eyes and his face darkened. Hearing those words, he immediately assumed an arrogant and indignant stance.

“The school specially assigned a teacher to me and I also find it rather tiresome. But it’s no one’s fault that my talents are too exceptional. Of course the academy needs to offer me special attention.”

“Oh, going by what you just said, this new teacher must be pretty good?” The teenager asked in a strange tone. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Ahem, of course. He is an expert specially hired by the academy, so of course normal students will not get the privilege of being taught by him. Only people with abilities like mine...” Lei Yan was unconvinced by Ye Qingtang’s powers but he would never let this rival of his know that.

But before Lei Yan could finish his sentence, the group of teenagers started laughing.

“An expert? Lei Yan, you really know how to bullshit. Senior Student Lin said that the new teacher is just a piece of trash who is only at the Paragon Sixth Heaven level. He is only able to enter the academy because of Vice-President’s benevolence. He isn’t even considered an official teacher here. Expert my ass...”

“You can’t say that. This new teacher might be trash to us, but he might truly be an ‘expert’ to Lei Yan. What was that phrase? Birds of a feather flock together? Who in the academy doesn’t know that he is a useless bum? That’s why he was assigned to such a lousy teacher.”

Those teenagers already knew who the new teacher was and had specially come to laugh at Lei Yan.

By now, Lei Yan’s face had gone extremely dark. His false front was being ripped to shreds.

“I say, Lei Yan, resign yourself to your fate. A person like you is just a disgrace to the name of the Netherworld Academy.”

“What did you say!” Lei Yan was enraged. He glared at the person and his eyes sparked in fury.

At Lei Yan’s holler, those Leiting family teenagers had no choice but to secretly roll their eyes and run over to Lei Yan’s side. Even the teenagers from the same family did not think much of Lei Yan. But because of his high status in the family, they had no choice but to protect him.

The two sides faced off each other but this commotion soon attracted the attention of the martial art faculty teacher. He immediately separated the two groups and scolded them.

Lei Yan in particular got an exceptionally fierce scolding. After all, with his current abilities, he was truly not fit to be in the Netherworld Academy. The teachers here naturally didn’t like this young master who only knew how to leverage off his status.

Those teenagers smirked as they watched Lei Yan being reprimanded. Those mocking faces incensed Lei Yan so much that his eyes turned bloodshot. A tremendous sense of shame filled his entire soul.

Not wishing to remain here a second longer, he turned and hurried off.

Those from the Leiting family were already used to such a scene. The other teenagers burst out in another fit of laughter.

“Stop all your nonsense. Go back and continue your practice. Unless you want to be as useless as him?” The teacher scolded with a chilly expression on his face.
