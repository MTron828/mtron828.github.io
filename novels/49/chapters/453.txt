Blood was flowing out of Yi Tianchou’s mouth then.

He avoided in time, fortunately. Otherwise, if he was attacked head-on, the breath of destruction would tear him into shreds in just one second!

“The sword with Senior Sister Ye You’s aura… Despicable!” The Yunxiao Sect disciple clenched his teeth.

Ye You had used the force of the blue spirit root to inject a breath of destruction in his long sword which was enough to save his life and counter-attack.

Yet, unexpectedly, Yi Tianchou luckily dodged it!

“Die!”

Yi Tianchou hollered in fury and darted to the front of the Yunxiao Sect disciple. Without giving him any time to react, Yi Tianchou slammed his palm directly on the Yunxiao Sect disciple’s crown.

Immediately, the crushing of bones could be heard, and blood gushed out from the Yunxiao Sect disciple’s eyes, ears, mouth, and nose.

Thump!

The Yunxiao Sect disciple collapsed on the ground like a pile of mud and lost his life on the spot after taking just two breaths.

After killing the Yunxiao Sect disciple, Yi Tianchou immediately leaped up and plucked the light cyan Spirit Life Flower on the huge rock away.

“You’ve obtained the Spirit Life Flower. You can release me already right…” Ye Qingtang looked at Yi Tianchou, who already gained the Spirit Life Flower.

At that moment, Yi Tianchou’s complexion was ghastly pale. After the battle with the Yunxiao Sect disciple, his injuries were not light, and he was especially severely injured from the breath of destruction that was injected using the force of Ye You’s spirit root.

Presently, Yi Tianchou naturally did not have the energy to do anything to Ye Qingtang, but he would not spare her life either.

“Tsk tsk… Little beauty, thank you for telling me about the Spirit Life Flower…” Yi Tianchou smiled sinisterly. “However, I never intended to let you go… It’s a pity that I’m injured and can’t do wonderful things with you… It truly is a pity.”

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang had a shocked expression on her face as she replied. “You… you actually lied!”

“Hahaha.” Yi Tianchou chortled loudly. “I’m going to recuperate in this mountain valley. If I let you go, you will definitely disclose this information… Furthermore, I don’t have the habit of setting anyone free.”

A hint of bloodthirst twinkled in his eyes as he walked towards Ye Qingtang.

“Little beauty…” Yi Tianchou eyes twinkled. “Goodbye!”

Seeing that Yi Tianchou was going to strike, Ye Qingtang seemed as though she was extremely petrified. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“No…” Fear was etched on Ye Qingtang’s face.

Yi Tianchou sneered even deeper after seeing Ye Qingtang’s reaction. He immediately accumulated a huge amount of force in his palm and slammed towards Ye Qingtang’s crown.

Swoosh!

However, as he was launching this quick attack, what he never expected was that this extremely frail-looking beauty would strike at this moment.

Almost instantly, Ye Qingtang struck with her palm in lightning speed.

Boom!

A deafening sound echoed the entire area when the two palms met.

In the next second, Yi Tianchou retreated over ten steps in disbelief as he spat a streak of blood.

“You…!”

Yi Tianchou looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief. “Martial Qi Level Two… Second Heaven!”

At the same time, the expression of fear on Ye Qingtang’s face vanished completely, and it was replaced with an evil smile.

Yi Tianchou’s face was awfully pallid like that of a dead corpse, as he stared at Ye Qingtang disbelievingly.

“You!” Yi Tianchou was astounded.

“Me?” An unknowing smile was hung on Ye Qingtang’s lips. “What about me?”

“Damn woman! You’re lying to me!”

Yi Tianchou was ranked nine on the Assassination Roll and was able to live in the world without being killed by the sects and Formidable Heavens Dynasty. How could he not be smart?

Yi Tianchou was not a fool. As long as he thought for a while, it was clear to him.

The girl before him was not injured at all. Even more so, she laid a trap for him from the very start!

“Lying to you?” Ye Qingtang raised her brows as she sneered. “How can you say that? Isn’t the Spirit Life Flower here?”

Yi Tianchou clenched his teeth tightly and wished he could shred Ye Qingtang into pieces.

“However, Yi Tianchou, you don’t have the ability to obtain this Spirit Life Flower. I still must thank you for handing this Spirit Life Flower to me.” Laughter filled Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she picked up the Spirit Life Flower that escaped Yi Tianchou’s hands previously.
