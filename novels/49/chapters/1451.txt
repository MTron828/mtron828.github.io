1452 Protecting One“s Child 6

Ye Qingtang glanced at Ye You and nodded.

A cold smile surfaced on Mo Yi’s pale face. Her half-hooded eyes passed over Ye You.

As Mo Yi’s gaze passed over Ye You, she felt as if a poisonous serpent was crawling over her. She shuddered and involuntarily ducked behind Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin had naturally noticed Mo Yi’s hostility. She advanced and hid Ye You behind her.

“Mo Yi, why are you here?”

“Jiang Qin, you should at least call me Second Sister-in-law.” Mo Yi raised her chin slightly and glanced coldly at Jiang Qin. Then she said frostily, “But right now, you’d better get lost.”

“Aunt Qin…” Ye You was no fool. She clearly sensed Mo Yi’s murderous intent that was directed at her. She frantically held on to Jiang Qin’s sleeve.

Jiang Qin frowned. When she saw Mo Yi and Ye Qingtang appear together, she knew that things had gone awry.

Her brother and his wife were unpredictable by nature. She wanted to get rid of Ye Qingtang before they returned but could not be certain of what they thought.

But now, Mo Yi was back, and her attitude was unmistakable.

“You’er, don’t be afraid. I’m here.” Jiang Qin consoled her.

With that, Jiang Qin stepped forward and looked at Mo Yi icily.

“Mo Yi, this is the Jiang Family. You are not allowed to just do whatever you like.”

Mo Yi covered her lips and smiled. “All of you are so funny. You know I’m used to doing whatever I like, but you’re still carping at me. Jiang Qin, since you are Jiang Lang’s younger sister, I won’t quibble with you. You just get lost. Today, I will make this Ye You return my daughter’s spirit root!”

When Jiang Qin heard that, her expression grew grim, and she tightened her defense around Ye You.

“Dream on. This spirit root has long belonged to You’er.”

“Then I will cut open her abdomen and dig it out with my own hands. I don’t mind getting dirty.” Mo Yi’s lips curled slightly as she reached out for Ye You.

Jiang Qin was startled and hurriedly intercepted her blow.

The instant the two of them exchanged blows, there was a huge explosion as the artificial mountain in the yard blew up.

Ye Qingtang was shocked as she watched Jiang Qin and Mo Yi fight.

Jiang Qin was extremely powerful. She only had to exert a little force, and Ye Qingtang would be rendered motionless.

But Mo Yi did not pale in comparison. As she exchanged blows with Jiang Qin, she slowly gained the upper hand.

In a moment, Mo Yi and Jiang Qin were embroiled in a fight.

The two serving women and the Beidou Demon Lord also hurried over.

“Young mistress, please stand back or you might be affected.” A demon fox servant blocked Ye Qingtang.

The Beidou Demon Lord was inwardly shocked by the scene before him. He had thought that his little sister’s mother was very eccentric but had not expected her to be so powerful.

“Little sister, your mother is… so powerful.”

Ye Qingtang herself had not expected this. In her previous life, she had only known that Mo Yi was notorious but had not paid attention to her abilities.

The demon fox servant said, “Our mistress is the princess of the Ancient Dynasty. Naturally, her cultivation techniques are different from others, and her powers are superior.”

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The princess of the Ancient Dynasty?

The Ancient Dynasty was the first dynasty to be established in Central Mainland ten thousand years ago. It had an illustrious history, and every member of its royal family was a top-notch cultivator. It was dominant for a time and governed the entire mainland. Even the major ancient clans had to submit to the Ancient Dynasty.

But ten thousand years ago, the Ancient Dynasty had declined for some reason, and the members of its royal family gradually vanished from sight.
