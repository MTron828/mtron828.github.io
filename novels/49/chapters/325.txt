The disciples in the square felt an overpowering force shrouding them from above, and they looked at the sky immediately.

Elder Qin looked up, and his lips curled into a smile when he saw the figure that resembled a shooting star.

“Elder Mo.”

When Elder Qin finished his sentence, the figure suddenly landed from the sky, and a tall figure appeared on the ring.

In just a moment, a strong overbearing force spread throughout the square when that person landed, even causing some disciples to have some difficulty breathing.

“Elder Qin.” The person who landed on the ring had a detached disposition. He looked sixty years old, but his straight back and deep set of eyes did not have any trace of his aging.

“Are you just returning to the sect, Elder Mo? What a coincidence. The inner sect assessment just ended, and we are about to return to the inner sect.” Elder Qin spoke to Elder Mo with a smile.

Elder Mo looked at the four people on the ring without any emotions on his face. “It ended already?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yes,” Elder Qin said.

The disciples in the square looked at Elder Mo whom Elder Qin was talking to on the ring and were a little out of breath from the overwhelming air around him.

“Who is this Elder Mo? How could he have such an overbearing force?!” A disciple took a deep breath quietly. They knew how powerful the inner sect elders were, and although Elder Mo controlled the movement of the air around him, the slight overbearing force he let out by accident was enough to cause them discomfort.

“Elder Mo is the inner sect’s Internal Affairs Elder. There is a total of ten elders in the inner sect. Elder Qin, Elder Lin, and the two other elders we saw previously are the Administrative Elders of the inner sect who not only manage the inner sect disciples but also handle some important affairs in the outer sect. On the other hand, the Internal Affairs Elder is only responsible for inner sect matters and is not bothered about any outer sect matters at all.”

“I heard that… the Internal Affairs Elder’s abilities are just right below the Sect Master’s…”

“It is our honor to be able to meet Elder Mo, the Internal Affairs Elder. If not for this coincidence, outer sect disciples like us would never get to see him unless we enter the inner sect.”

As the disciples lamented in their hearts, Elder Mo had already exchanged a few words with the other elders, and they returned to the inner sect together.

After the inner sect elders left, the disciples surrounded in the square finally dispersed gradually.

Ye Qingtang and Ji Xianyuan made eye contact, nodded slightly, and walked down the ring

The moment she just stepped down from the ring, Elder Huang who was in all smiles walked up.

“Ye Qingtang, you performed well today.” Elder Huang’s smile at that instant was exceptionally bright. First, Yuan Wei achieved fourth place in the Excellence Roll, which brought him honor, and afterward, Ye Qingtang took the number one position. His mood right now was relatively great.

“Thank you, elder.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

“However, you must not slack off in the future. Once you enter the inner sect, you must work a few times harder.” Elder Huang advised cheerily and then allowed Ye Qingtang to leave.

After bidding goodbye to Elder Huang, Ye Qingtang wanted to return to her room directly, but before she reached her room, she was suddenly blocked by someone.

Qin Huan, Gu Yanqiu, and others were actually standing outside Ye Qingtang’s room, and right when they saw her, they immediately stretched a hand out to stop her.
