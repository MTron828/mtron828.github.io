Chapter 1529 At Ease 2

Jiang Yu finally let out the anger that had accumulated inside him for all these years.

“Since you mentioned it, I’ll acknowledge the fact that we have spent the past ten thousand years together. But you’re all aware that this place is full of danger now. It will be more difficult for my descendant to bring you along. Take out whatever you have. They are not for her, okay? This is to ensure our safety. I don’t want your things.” Jiang Yu lifted his chin and said arrogantly. He seemed to be very kind and reasonable under his words.

Everyone cursed Jiang Yu millions of times in their mind.

His words sounded pleasant, but it was obvious that he wanted to extort them.

However, they had to agree with his terms. No one dared to show any discontentment even though they were unwilling to do so.

Who would know that the person who entered the forbidden place would be a descendant of the Jiang Family?

If it was one of their descendants, it would be their turn to be arrogant.

“Right, right. You’re right, Old Jiang. Sorry for troubling you.” Everyone smiled and said.

Jiang Yu nodded in satisfaction and glanced at Ye Qingtang. “What’s your name?”

“I’m Ye Qingtang.”

“Your surname is Ye?” Jiang Yu felt a little strange, but the totem on her clothes was the Jiang Family’s one. Furthermore, she admitted her identity as well. He did not ask anymore.

“It’s a little complicated. I’ll explain in detail when we leave this place,” Ye Qingtang said obediently.

The Domain Monarch Founder’s identity in the Jiang Family was impossible to surpass no matter how he looked now. Even if he was a little child now, the effect would be unimaginable when he returned to the Jiang Family.

Jiang Yu nodded slightly and then looked at the rest who he spent ten thousand years together.

“Emperor Yan, your Soul-burning Ring may be useful. Take out later and give it to Tang Tang. It can help to shield us from some danger.

Emperor Yan, whose name was mentioned, really wanted to beat Jiang Yu up.

The Soul-burning Ring was one of his most valuable Dharma treasures. He used it often to fight with Jiang Yu when they were first trapped here.

Who would have thought...

He remembered that!

He was using his power for his own desire!

The Soul-burning Ring only worked with someone who was above the Holy Venerate stage. It was going to be totally useless to Ye Qingtang now.

“What? You don’t want to give it to her? It’s okay... Since you don’t care about everyone’s safety, I think we shall forget...” Jiang Yu was impatient.

“Okay, stop! Just take it!” Emperor Yan gritted his teeth and threw his Soul-burning Ring in front of Jiang Yu.

He could feel his heart bleeding. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Jiang Yu looked at the Soul-burning Ring in his hand and laughed in satisfaction. He then handed over the ring to Ye Qingtang. “Take it.”

Ye Qingtang trembled as she stared at the Soul-burning Ring in her hand.

She heard about it before as it was one of the Emperor Yan’s Paragon Dharma treasures. Ye Qingtang thought she was good at extortion, but she did not expect that Jiang Yu would be even better.

Jiang Yu now felt relieved after getting the treasure from Emperor Yan. He used the opportunity and named everyone who fought with him before one by one. He did not miss any Dharma treasures from them.

If Ye Qingtang’s extortion was a piece of cake, everyone felt that they were skinned after giving out the treasures that Jiang Yu named.

They gnashed their teeth in anger, but they had no choice.

If Jiang Yu was not satisfied and asked Ye Qingtang to abandon them here, they could only wait for death.
