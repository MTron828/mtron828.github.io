Chapter 2152: Humiliation (2)

Meng Yao’s words were particularly vicious. If Jing Ze hadn’t heard it with his own ears, he could hardly imagine any student from the Netherworld Academy spouting such malevolent nonsense.

The words made Mu Ziying’s face turn pale. Meng Yao’s malicious words to her in such a public arena were like acid slowly eroding her dignity. They were clearly just a bunch of young teenage girls who should be ignorant of such adult matters. And this made her venomous accusations sound even more horrifying.

“I haven’t seen you much over these past few days. So it seems that you’ve been fooling around with this silly kid. So disgusting. How did our Netherworld Academy produce such a shameless hussy like you.” Meng Yao frowned disdainfully at Mu Ziying.

Mu Ziying had always been introverted and seldom interacted with the other students. So apart from Jing Ze, no one else was willing to help her. They all stood by the side smiling, enjoying the spectacle.

“Damn, this Meng Yao’s mouth is really foul. Mu Ziying is so young.” Lei Yan, who had been hanging out with teenagers from his family clan, was also attracted by the commotion. Hearing Meng Yao’s evil accusations, even a fiend like him couldn’t help frowning.

“Meng Yao, how can you make such slanderous accusations!” Jing Ze went pale with anger. He didn’t expect a lady to slander a young child in front of everyone.

“Humph, slander? Jing Ze, don’t be so shameless. I am definitely giving her a beating today. Get lost if you don’t want to die. Otherwise, I will gladly give you a beating too!” Meng Yao gave a cold smile.

Jing Ze stiffened but he didn’t move aside.

“Hurry up, leave now,” he whispered to Mu Ziying.

“No one is to leave.” Meng Yao stated coldly. Zhang Qiqiu and the rest had Jing Ze and Mu Ziying surrounded, not giving either of them any opportunity to escape.

The onlookers all secretly shook their heads at the sight. Meng Yao and Zhang Qiqiu’s powers were not that outstanding. But they had strength in numbers. Also... even if it was a one-on-one fight, with Jing Ze’s abilities, he would only end up receiving a sound thrashing.

As for Mu Ziying...

She was still too young.

At that moment, everyone realized that there was no way Jing Ze and Mu Ziying would escape a thrashing today.

“I say, Zhang Qiqiu, this is so unfair. A bunch of big fellows like you making trouble for a little girl. That can’t be right.” A voice suddenly rang out from the crowd.

Everyone turned and saw that it was Lei Yan who had spoken.

The teenagers from his family clan were all startled by Lei Yan’s words. Lei Yan didn’t wish to intervene but as roguish as he was, he did have a bottom line.

He would never hit a female...

Although he did not interact much with Mu Ziying, it went against his principles to see a little girl being surrounded by a bunch of people.

“Lei Yan, what business is this of yours? What? Do you also have something going on with this girl?” Meng Yao smirked.

Lei Yan’s face darkened. This woman’s mouth was truly filthy!

“Lei Yan, forget it. This has nothing to do with us. Just keep quiet.” One of the teenagers from his family clan tugged at Lei Yan. It was bad enough that Lei Yan often made trouble for himself. Now, he wanted to interfere with other people’s affairs. They did not wish to be dragged down together with him. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Although Lei Yan wanted to say something, Meng Yao and Zhang Qiqiu completely ignored him. Meng Yao nodded at Zhang Qiqiu who immediately led the gang toward Jing Ze and Mu Ziying.
