Chapter 663: Who Are You (5)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After the few Yunxiao Sect disciples died, they turned into bloody fog and were absorbed by Ning Luo’s sword.

At this moment, the Yunxiao Sect wardens and disciples who rushed over were all killed by the demonic Buddha statue.

Almost all the remaining forces were from the Nine Nights Dynasty. Once the remaining Yunxiao Sect forces saw Ning Luo’s actions, they did not dare to go near him and stayed clear of him.

Since they could become high-ranking executives and disciples of a super sect, they were no fools. They could analyze the situation before them very quickly, and many people from Yunxiao Sect began to suspect if Ning Luo was that mysterious black-robed person or if he was in the same gang as him.

“Run!”

Ye Qingtang reminded after glancing at the forces from Falling Sky Valley and other forces from the Nine Nights Dynasty behind her.

The more people Ning Luo killed, the faster the Ice Frost Divine Sword in his hand resurrected. Once the Ice Frost Divine Sword was completely awakened, the Dimension Wall protecting this mainland would probably be destroyed by the Ice Frost Divine Sword. By then, the consequences would be unthinkable!

“Run!”

A certain warden from Falling Sky Valley returned to his senses and shouted. Then, he fled in the other direction immediately.

“Since you’re here, how can you leave?”

Ning Luo laughed coldly and slashed the ice Frost Divine Sword across subsequently.

Swoosh!

An indescribable coldness was slashed out from Ning Luo’s Ice Frost Divine Sword.

In an instant, several powerful figures who were fleeing away turned into icy frost successively.

At the same time, the vajra in the demonized Buddha statue swept out and crushed those frosty figures.

The dead people turned into blood fog and surged into the Ice Frost Divine Sword.

Ye Qingtang was astonished to witness this sight.

Ning Luo could actually control the ice Frost Divine Sword so skillfully… How could this be!

To control such a divine weapon, one’s skills had to be compatible. Otherwise, there was no use at all.

Even if it was the Ye Qingtang who was at her peak in the previous lifetime, she might not be able to control a Heaven-grade divine weapon so perfectly with her Holy Venerate skills.

Speaking in another way, unless Ning Luo possessed skills of a Holy Venerate, there was no way this could happen at all!

However, Ye Qingtang would not believe that Ning Luo was a Holy Venerate figure.

If Ning Luo’s skills could rival a Holy Venerate’s, he did not need to go through such trouble to destroy this mainland as he could easily cause this mainland to vanish without a trace with the raise of a hand.

“F*ck. How dare a mere creature produced by the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm disregard me!” The white tiger hollered in fury and launched its body towards the demonized Buddha statue once again.

Almost at the same time, the demonized Buddha statue and the white tiger were entangled in a brawl while Ning Luo gently leaped down from the demonized Buddha statue.

While this demonized Buddha statue was powerful, it was unable to continue to be on a rampage without rival once it met a grown Fiendcelestial Beast. Although the demonized Buddha statue’s combat power was similar to the white tiger’s, its defense was weaker than the Fiendcelestial Beast. Thus, it was quickly forced to be in a defensive mode.

Ye Qingtang ignored the fight between the white tiger and the demonized statue and only looked at Ning Luo.

The man before her exuded an extremely mysterious air. He did not have the skills of a Holy Venerate yet could control a Heaven-grade divine weapon so perfectly. He was not that extraordinary lady’s follower but was obsessed with destroying this mainland… Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Who exactly was he, and why did he want to do this!

“Ning Luo, where are you from, and why do you wish to destroy this mainland?” Ye Qingtang stared at Ning Luo who stood not far away as though he was a powerful enemy.
