Chapter 1002 The Arrival of A Powerful Figure (2)

“Tang Tang… your life is most important…” At this moment, Ye Ling looked at Ye Qingtang and could not help but try to persuade her.

To Ye Ling, there was nothing more important than his own daughter’s life. Regardless of that Fiendcelestial Beast and the black-grade weapon, it was still so.

However, Ye Qingtang did not even turn around to look at Ye Ling or the Second Elder.

“Ye Qingtang, the Clan Master has already said it. Are you really going to refuse to admit your mistake? Forget it if you don’t want your life, but do you want the Ye Family to be buried together with you as well!”

“Ye Qingtang, quickly hand the Fiendcelestial Beast over. Otherwise, don’t blame us for punishing you in the name of justice!”

The senior members of the Ye Family looked at Ye Qingtang, enraged. Even if Ye Qingtang could suppress the half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord Clan Master Long using that god-knows-what Fiendcelestial Beast, the person she was facing currently was, however, the previous Grand Elder of Qinglin Sect, a true Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

A half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and Yin Yang Perfected Lord may seem close, but in reality, there was a world of difference between them! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Even if a hundred or thousand half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords faced a true Yin Yang Perfected Lord, they would only be slain!

“Any more bullsh*t and you’ll die.”

Ye Qingtang’s eyes swept across the senior members of the Ye Family who were rambling ceaselessly.

“You!”

One of the senior members pointed at Ye Qingtang in fury.

Swoosh!

Before that senior member could finish his sentence, there was a sound of a sword being unsheathed. Subsequently, that senior member’s arm which was instantly stretched out was chopped by the sword aura.

“Arh!!!”

A miserable cry escaped that senior member of the Ye Family. Never had he thought that Ye Qingtang would actually attack him, a senior member of the Ye Family!

Noticing the situation, all the senior members were shocked and did not dare to utter a word. Ye Qingtang had a black-grade weapon and a Fiendcelestial Beast which even the previous Grand Elder of Qinglin Sect cared very much about. It was nothing but courting death if they opposed Ye Qingtang right now!

“Ye Qingtang, this devil’s spawn…”

“Humph! What a scoundrel. She is only a member of the younger generation of the Ye Family. How dare she attack a senior member of the Ye Family? This is a wicked crime which is past forgiving!”

“Once the Qinglin Sect Grand Elder takes her Fiendcelestial Beast and black-grade weapon… I want to see if she still dares to be this arrogant in front of us!”

“By then, we must make her kneel and punish her by the clan’s rules!”

The senior members of the Ye Family gritted their teeth.

“Young one, what do you think of my suggestion?” Qinglin Sect’s previous Grand Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

Ye Qingtang stared at the elderly in the air and replied plainly. “Fiendcelestial Beasts have always only followed powerful figures. With your weak martial realm, where did you find the courage to believe that you are qualified enough to obtain the Fiendcelestial Beast?”

Everyone was surprised by what Ye Qingtang said. Was this Ye Qingtang really courting death?!

Previously, the Qinglin Sect Grand Elder had already clearly said that as long as she handed the Fiendcelestial Beast over, he would spare her life, but Ye Qingtang… actually said such things to the Qinglin Sect Grand Elder! Did she really not want her life anymore?!

“Ye Qingtang, this scoundrel. How dare you talk to the Grand Elder this way!”

“Ye Qingtang, if you wish to die then go ahead alone. Why must you drag us and the Ye Family along with you?!”
