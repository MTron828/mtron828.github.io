Chapter 1697: I Am Beating You (1)

Unaware of Ye Qingtang’s trump card, Baili Xuanyun assumed it was probably because he was still not at full power yet after his fight with Jiang Yanyun. If anything, he was even more enraged by Ye Qingtang’s arrogant statement.

“Ye Qingtang, be careful what you say. Let me give you a taste of my Thunderbolt Rage!” Baili Xuanyun scoffed and in the next second, a huge storm cloud covered the entirety of the Island of Immortal Footsteps. Bolts of lightning flashed within the dark cloud, while howling winds tunnelled wildly through the air!

The crowd was dumbstruck by the tremendous thunder clouds.

Was Baili Xuanyun really moving in for the kill this time?!

The Thunderbolt Rage was the Baili Clan’s most powerful attack. Of the current generation, only Baili Xi had mastered this technique. In the previous Martial Arts Championship, Baili Xi had used the Thunderbolt Rage to secure his top spot.

Who would have thought...

Baili Xuanyun had managed to learn this technique over the past few years.

Thunder boomed and lightning flashed ominously. It was like the entire island was going to be torn apart. Lit up by the lightning flashes, Baili Xuanyun’s face took on a malevolent expression.

Elder Qian immediately stood up when he saw the Thunderbolt Rage.

“Elder Baili, what does your Baili Xuanyun mean by doing this?!” Elder Qian glared at Elder Baili.

The Thunderbolt Rage was too powerful. Once launched, it was a one-way road to hell for the opponent.

After Baili Xi released his Thunderbolt Rage in the previous competition, his opponent had died on spot. There wasn’t even any time to try and save him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Although death was part and parcel of the Martial Arts Championship, Ye Qingtang was nearly one whole level below that of Baili Xuanyun. Yet, he was still going to make use of such a powerful move. Wasn’t he clearly trying to kill Ye Qingtang?

This was not just to win. It was to kill!

Elder Baili chuckled. “I really don’t know how to answer Elder Qian’s question. All is fair inside the arena. I am just waiting for the win. Don’t tell me the Jiang family wants to control the moves of the other fighters as well? Wouldn’t that be a bit too much?”

Anger flashed past Elder Qian’s eyes.

Waiting for the win? This was blatant slaughter, not a competition.

“You can only blame your own Jiang family members for not being powerful enough.” Elder Baili smirked. The faces of the Jiang family elders went red with anger. His words were equivalent to a slap in the face!

In the arena, Ye Qingtang’s eyes were sharp as she gazed up at the gathering storm clouds.

“Ye Qingtang, you brought this upon yourself!” Baili Xuanyun cried out viciously. The moment he spoke those words, countless lightning bolts descended from the sky. Streaks of lightning merged and morphed into the form of a dragon, charging straight at Ye Qingtang.

“Boom!”

Thunderous sounds engulfed the entire arena. Even the sturdy arena was now marked by jagged streaks by the lightning strikes. Dust and ash filled the air, as if the cloud had descended onto earth. All anyone could see was the brilliant dazzle of the lightning streaks, as well as Baili Xuanyun’s malevolent and venomous smile.

Ye Qingtang, let’s see if you can still make it out alive?!

The faces of Elder Qian and the rest were beyond grim. There was no way Ye Qingtang was strong enough to survive the Thunderbolt Rage...

Elder Qian couldn’t help feeling a tightness in his heart as he thought of Ye Qingtang’s recently discovered talent.

Right at that moment, a figure suddenly broke through the lightning and charged straight at the smug-faced Baili Xuanyun!
