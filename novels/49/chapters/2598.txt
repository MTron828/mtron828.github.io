“Let me consider it.” Ye Qingtang smiled at the middle-aged man. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Miss, listen to me. This is definitely a good item. Don’t listen to this kid’s nonsense. I didn’t just randomly pick it up from the streets!” the middle-aged man hurriedly urged.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang did not speak, the middle-aged man threw the small wooden box on the ground. Looking at the intact wooden box, he said, “How is it? I didn’t lie to you, right? It’s really a rare Dharma treasure. Miss, you are fated with it. You must have it!”

“Will you give it to me for free then?” Ye Qingtang asked the middle-aged man after a moment of silence.

‘The middle-aged man was stunned by Ye Qingtang’s words. He looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief. “I say, Miss, you are young, beautiful and wearing extraordinary clothes... How can you have the cheek to let a poor trader who lives on the edge of life and death... give you something for free?”

Ye Qingtang smiled and said, “I don’t have money.”

‘The burning gaze in the middle-aged man’s eyes dissipated instantly. “If you don’t have money... why are you talking so much to me then?”

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck. Didn’t she just ask a casual question? He was the one who kept blabbering on and on.

“although I don’t have money, I have goods. Do you want to exchange?” Ye Qingtang smiled at the middle-aged man.

Ye Qingtang was not lying. She indeed did not have money. Moreover, the currency of her era was completely different from that of this era. However, she had many other things besides money.

“Goods?” The middle-aged man glanced at Ye Qingtang. “What goods? Tell me.”

“Elixirs. How about that?” Ye Qingtang asked.

‘As she spoke, Ye Qingtang took out an elixir from her space ring.

Ye Qingtang had refined this elixir at the Wailing Well. It was more than enough for her to exchange for a lousy small box, even though this elixir was not considered very valuable.

“This...”

‘The middle-aged man and even Feng Jiuyou’s eyes widened at the sight of Ye Qingtang’s elixir.

Ye Qingtang was rather puzzled by their expressions. Her elixir was very ordinary, especially to a Divine Lord level practitioner. It should not be considered anything special. There was no need to look so surprised.

“This... this, this, this... Miss, can you let me take a look?” The middle-aged man looked very eager.

“Take it.” Ye Qingtang casually threw the elixir to the middle-aged man.

‘The middle-aged man was quick to react. He grabbed the elixir with caution.

After examining it for a long time, the middle-aged man could not help but look at Ye Qingtang in shock, “It’s... actually a real elixir...”

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck. Did he really have to say that? She was a powerful figure who was close to being a sub-Emperor. Why would she need to fake such an ordinary elixir?

“Miss, you, you are not a student of the Great Immortal Temple, right...” The middle-aged man’s body trembled slightly and his expression changed as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Great Immortal Temple?” Ye Qingtang fell into deep thought. She seemed to have read about this in the historical records before. It sounded a little familiar but she could not recall it at the moment.

“Tm not.” Ye Qingtang shook her head. “Why are you so shocked? It’s just an elixir.”

“Just an elixir?!” The middle-aged man widened his eyes in disbelief. “I say, young lady... you really know how to crack jokes.. Do you know what a completed elixir is? This is the second time in my life that I’ve seen a completed elixir!”
