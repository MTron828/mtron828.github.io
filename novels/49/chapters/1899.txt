Chapter 1900: Massacre (6)

But the moment he made contact with Ye Qingtang’s cheek, pain shot through his wounded arm and he quickly drew back his hand with a howl. He looked as frightened as an injured little animal.

Ye Qingtang’s face turned pale.

The strike to his skull had caused Jiang Shaobai to become mentally impaired...

Staring at the thick bandages on his head, Ye Qingtang was unwilling to accept this fact, but... that doltish expression on his face was similar to that of a two to three-year-old child.

Where had that cunning, sharp-tongued teenager gone to?

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and suppressed her rising anxiety. She carefully reapplied medicine to Jiang Shaobai’s hand. Left in this state, Jiang Shaobai was no longer lucid. No one would be able to tell her who had attacked him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

With a foolish expression on his face, Jiang Shaobai gazed on at Ye Qingtang as she applied medicine to his hand. “Pretty.”

Ye Qingtang was momentarily taken aback. Looking at the grinning Jiang Shaobai, she felt a dull ache in her heart.

“Good boy, be good, okay? I will bring you to a safe place. I will cure you.” Ye Qingtang lifted her hand to caress Jiang Shaobai’s head but halted when she saw the blood-soaked bandage. Her heart sank.

Jiang Shaobai had lost his memories and his intelligence level had dropped drastically.

Their only lead to understanding what happened was now broken.

But Ye Qingtang suddenly thought of a place where Jiang Shaobai could peacefully recuperate. She could also investigate the Jiang family’s situation from there...

The Temple of Shadows!

Only with the power of the Temple of Shadows could she investigate the person who destroyed the Jiang family. And only then would she be able to find out if Jiang Lang and his wife were still alive.

For the first time in her life, Ye Qingtang felt a pressing need to return to the Temple of Shadows.

“Are you going back?” Little White Tiger could already guess what she was thinking.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Although she was not biologically linked to the Jiang family, Jiang Lang and his wife, as well as Jiang Yisheng and the rest were like family to her.

“Shaobai said before that he wanted to avenge Yisheng. I must cure him. If not, I will seek revenge on his behalf,” Ye Qingtang said.

“I must tell you first that this person is very powerful. He is more powerful than anyone I have ever met in the First Mainland,” Little White Tiger cautioned.

Ye Qingtang didn’t reply. She only focused on taking care of Jiang Shaobai. Over this time, she patiently explained to him that his name was Jiang Shaobai and that she was his elder sister.

Two days later.

Since Jiang Shaobai’s injuries had more or less stabilized, Ye Qingtang started on the road back to the Temple of Shadows with Little White Tiger and Jiang Shaobai in tow.

Inside the Temple of Shadows, Ming Gu was glumly sitting in Ye Qingtang’s room. As usual, he was holding a small handkerchief and carefully polishing all the articles in her room.

“Holy Son Ming Gu.” One of the undead stood respectfully by the door. Ming Gu didn’t respond and the undead made to step into the room.

But the moment that undead touched the doorframe, his body exploded as a black shadow charged right into him.

Xue Fu was standing at the side, looking down at the remains of his subordinate. He rubbed his forehead in exasperation, with a ‘just as I expected’ expression on his face. He glanced up at the person who had killed that undead—Ming Gu himself.

Ming Gu’s face was brimming with cold malevolence.

Ming Gu’s temper had become increasingly short since the Holy Lord of Shadows left the Temple of Shadows. He refused to let any of the servants tidy up the Holy Lord’s room. Apart from himself, no one else was allowed to take even half a step into the room.
