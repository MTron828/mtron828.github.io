Chapter 2064: Possession (2)

Ming Di was as powerful as the Holy Lord of Shadows, which was what made the Grand Elder want to possess Little Luo Xue’s body so much.

In his current state... How could he be a match for the Holy Lord of Shadows?

“Holy Lord of Shadows, you must have infiltrated the Ancient You Clan for her?” The Grand Elder narrowed his eyes and pointed towards Little You Yun.

Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows gently without replying, silently confirming what he had said.

Her silent confirmation gave him some hope.

“This little girl’s Spiritual Abode is indeed very powerful. Holy Lord, you may have an interest in it, but won’t be able to understand how to use it fully in such a short while,” the Grand Elder said after weighing his options.

“The Ancient You Clan has been studying the Spiritual Abode for tens of thousands of years and we understand it well. If the Holy Lord is willing, we can cooperate. After all, the Central Mainland is just in the First Domain. You were originally from the Second Domain and must know how vast the place is. Why would you want to stay here?”

The Grand Elder spoke cautiously. He had been too overconfident previously, thinking that nothing would go wrong since no one would enter the underground world and Buddha statues were guarding him.

Who would have thought... that he would meet with someone unexpected. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Since he was alone here, he had to cooperate with Ye Qingtang if he wanted to live.

“Hm? You want to work with me?” She looked at the Grand Elder lightly.

“It’s only natural for the strong to form an alliance. Isn’t the same with the Temple of Shadows and the Crimson League? But...” the Grand Elder paused before continuing, “The Crimson League doesn’t seem to value the Temple of Shadows much. When you vanished, they removed the Temple of Shadows from their alliance. You probably won’t be able to regain your old standing even if you return to the Crimson League now.

“But I’m different,” the Grand Elder said as he looked at her.

“The Ancient You Clan and the Temple of Shadows are of about the same strength and we’re both from the First Domain. If we join hands, we would be able to defeat the Second Domain in a day. After all, we have the Spiritual Abode as well as the Spirit of Chaos...”

Half of the Spirit of Chaos fragments were with the Ancient You Clan while the other half was with the Temple of Shadows.

Ye Qingtang couldn’t help but admire how thick the Grand Elder’s skin was as she listened to him. He really was a sly fox that had lived for tens of thousands of years, to be able to play with someone’s heart so easily.

“Why would I want to work with you?” she said with a cold laugh as her gaze swept lightly over him. “You’re my enemy after all. As long as you’re dead, the girl and the Spirit of Chaos will fall into my hands.”

The Grand Elder’s face darkened as he grabbed Little You Yun’s neck and said, “You’re right. I’m no match for you, but I have more than enough strength to kill her. If I die, I’m taking her to the grave with me, and you will lose the Spiritual Abode.”

Ye Qingtang looked at him expressionlessly.

“Prove your sincerity if you want to work with me.”

The Grand Elder’s heart shook as he quickly said, “Can I use the Spirit of Chaos fragments to show my sincerity?”

He had heard from the Ancient You Clan members that the Crimson League was after the Spirit of Chaos fragments. If they managed to get the fragments, the Crimson League would not even be a match for them.
