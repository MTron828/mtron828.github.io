1434 Parents 3

“I want to teach this wild girl the rules of our Jiang Family.” Jiang Qin was not the least remorseful and still had an extremely haughty look. Even when she was talking to her own older brother, Jiang Liu, she did not curb her arrogance.

“What wild girl? Tang Tang is a child of our Jiang Family,” Jiang Liu said, displeased.

Jiang Qin scoffed without paying any regard to Jiang Liu. “I don’t care whether she is part of the Jiang Family or not. Anyone who bullies You must be punished.”

“Third brother, my sister died early. If I don’t help her to protect You, wouldn’t You be bullied by others? I don’t intend to make things difficult for this Ye Qingtang either. As long as she kneels down and kowtows as an apology to You, I will treat this incident as over.”

Jiang Liu frowned slightly and immediately looked at Ye You who was behind Jiang Qin.

“You, didn’t you say that everything that happened before was over?”

Ye You had an innocent expression and appeared as though she suffered an injustice.

Jiang Qin immediately protected Ye You behind her and said, “This has nothing to do with You. You are such a biased uncle. You don’t know who the parents of this wild girl are, but you’re already helping her to bully You? Since you are unwilling to interfere, I will.”

“Who says that we don’t know who Tang Tang’s parents are?” Elder Xu said coldly after helping Ye Qingtang regulate her breathing.

“We have already found out who Tang Tang’s parents are just now.”

Everyone at the scene was taken aback by what Elder Xu said.

Even Ye Qingtang was a little dumbfounded. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Elder Xu is too speedy, isn’t he?

He already found out who my parents are so quickly?

Jiang Qin had a nonchalant expression, however.

“Which division are they from?”

Elder Xu said in a deep voice, “What division? She is the child of your second brother and sister-in-law.”

“What?” Jiang Qin was in a slight daze.

Even Ye Qingtang was stunned as well.

Jiang Qin’s second brother?

Isn’t that the Domain Monarch’s second son?

Ye Qingtang had heard some rumors about the Jiang Family in her previous life.

In the Jiang Family, the Domain Monarch was the most skilled, but the person whom the Central Mainland feared the most was the Domain Monarch’s second son… Jiang Lang.

Jiang Lang was very gifted and was thought highly of by the Domain Monarch since young. He was nurtured carefully and was originally intended to be brought up as a candidate for the next Domain Monarch.

Yet, Jiang Lang was extremely malicious such that murder and doing evil were all considered child’s play. He had killed many people, and even he himself might not be able to keep up with the number of murders he committed. Meanwhile, the wife whom he married was all the more notorious. Before she was even of age, she burned thousands of people in a blazing flame just so she could admire their contorted expressions.

The couple left the Jiang Family a long time ago and paid no regard to the Domain Monarch’s dissatisfaction and reproach.

Even if people of the Jiang Family made them unhappy, they also killed them simply.

Blood ties were simply a joke to Jiang Lang. In this world, there was nothing dared not to do and no one he dared not kill.

Once, a person from a certain influential group merely looked at Jiang Lang a little longer, and Jiang Lang annihilated the entire group. In a night, he flooded the city with blood, and not a single person was spared.

Even Ye Qingtang was frantic to hear the name Jiang Lang.

But never would she have thought that Elder Xu actually said that the malicious and vicious couple was actually her parents!

Was Elder Xu really not lying?

Jiang Qin’s expression was a little dark now.

“Did you check correctly?”

“Of course. I have already sent people to inform your second brother and sister-in-law, and they may be back after some time,” Elder Xu said but did not dare to be too certain.

After all, Jiang Lang and his wife had never bothered about blood ties, and it was uncertain whether they would care about their biological daughter.

Jiang Qin squinted her eyes while Ye You’s expression stiffened as well.

She had returned to the Jiang Family for some time already and naturally heard of the rumors regarding Jiang Lang and his wife. Just the countless misdoings that the pair committed were enough for one’s blood to run cold.

Ye Qingtang is Jiang Lang’s daughter?

How could this be?

Ye You was very unwilling to believe that this was true, but since Elder Xu said so, it was more or less real.
