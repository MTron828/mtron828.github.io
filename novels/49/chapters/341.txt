Chapter 342: The Paragon Skill (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Fei Ying still wanted to say something, but then he remembered that the ten bottles of Soul Condensation Pills that Feng Moli took away belonged to Song Junqiu. He felt more relieved. He looked at Ye Qingtang and then the yard. He was curious about the red flames surrounding Feng Moli’s body previously.

“Young Lady, is Feng Moli very strong? I saw that Song Junqiu was afraid of him just now. Aren’t they all inner sect disciples? How come Song Junqiu who brought more people would be afraid of Feng Moli alone?”

Ye Qingtang replied. “There is a difference in the abilities of inner sect disciples. What could Song Junqiu do even though he had more people? Feng Moli understood the Paragon Skill. How would Song Junqiu dare to challenge him?”

“The Paragon Skill?” Fei Ying was stunned and said. “I heard this before from the wardens at the Spirit Pet Hall. It seems to be a very powerful skill. Only people with a yellow spirit root or above can understand the powerful skill that belongs to him only, right?”

Ye Qingtang nodded and said, “More accurately, the possibility is extremely small.”

Most people could only dream about the Paragon Skill and would never be able to understand that.

Feng Moli was the only disciple in the Xuanling Sect who understood the Paragon Skill.

That was the reason why Feng Moli could be so aggressive in the inner sect. He was the key focus of the Elders and the Sect Master based on his talent and the Paragon Skill.

It could be said that…

No one in the inner sect dared to provoke Feng Moli.

Ye Qingtang did not have a spirit root in her previous life, so she could not have learned the Paragon Skill. However, this time…

Though she only possessed an orange spirit root, she was confident that she could nurture her spirit root, and then… she might have the chance to understand the Paragon Skill that she did not have the chance to touch in her previous life.

Fei Ying’s eyes showed his eagerness for the Paragon Skill. He looked at his abdomen and said, “I’m not sure whether I will have the chance to understand the Paragon Skill.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang looked at Fei Ying in a complex way.

Even though Fei Ying was just a sword boy, he possessed a high-quality green spirit root. He was not born into a renowned family. If he was, he would have definitely been able to enter the sect as an official disciple based on his potential.

Ye Qingtang did not know much about Fei Ying’s story in her previous life. She only knew that he murdered his Senior and Junior Brothers.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. The Fei Ying in front of her now was totally different from the one in the rumor in her previous life. She did not know what happened to Fei Ying in her previous life that resulted in him killing other disciples.

Fei Ying did not notice Ye Qingtang’s gaze. He chatted with Ni Shang for a while and left for his duties.

Ye Qingtang sat in the hall and lowered her eyes.

Feng Moli just released a little breath of the Paragon Skill, and it had such great results. How powerful would it be if he revealed the entire Paragon Skill?

“The Paragon Skill…”

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes as she stared at the silver wolf beside her.

She hugged its neck and murmured. “Xiao Guai, do you think… I will understand the Paragon Skill in the future…”

The silver wolf did not have any reactions, but its eyes were cold when Ye Qingtang did not look at it.
