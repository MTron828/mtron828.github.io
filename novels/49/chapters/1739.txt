Chapter 1740: Looking For Food (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As she looked at the little fellow’s pitiful state and felt the rumbling of her own empty stomach, Ye Qingtang suddenly had an idea. She had Little White Tiger shrink back down in size, then carried the two creatures into a patch of ice forest in front of them.

Silence enveloped the ice forest. Ye Qingtang searched for a long while before finally spotting a slumbering ice beast beside a frozen lake. That ice beast was over a dozen meters tall and snored so loudly that the ground nearby trembled.

Ye Qingtang brought little Heavenly Demon and Little White Tiger over to the side. She continued to observe that ice beast.

“Don’t tell me... you want to...” Little White Tiger suddenly realized what Ye Qingtang was planning to do. It widened its eyes in shock.

Ye Qingtang must be mad!

“What else can we do? Just continue to starve?” Ye Qingtang was left with no choice either.

“When did you become such a daredevil?” Little White Tiger sighed and shook its head.

Previously, they tried their best to avoid the monsters in this mystic realm, but now, Ye Qingtang was planning to eat one of them?!

The desire for food was truly irrepressible.

Ye Qingtang pointed at the ice beast. “For eating.”

Having spent some time together, little Heavenly Demon could more or less understand what Ye Qingtang tried to say to it. Although it still didn’t understand most of her words, it understood certain key phrases.

Especially the word...

Eat!

This word.

The moment little Heavenly Demon heard the word “eat”, it immediately perked up and stared at the ice beast with sparkling eyes. Baring its sharp little teeth and making guttural noises, it immediately wanted to charge toward that ice beast.

But it was dragged back by the tail by Ye Qingtang.

Little Heavenly Demon looked very aggrieved at being dragged back. Wasn’t it for eating? Drool had already accumulated at the corners of its lips.

“You must bewitch it before you can eat it.” Ye Qingtang stared at the little Heavenly Demon in amusement.

That ice beast was no weakling. It was at least a Paragon level. In normal circumstances, Ye Qingtang would have immediately turned and left if she saw such a monster, but now... RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Both she and little Heavenly Demon were going crazy with hunger. If they didn’t find something to eat soon, she was worried that the little Heavenly Demon might swallow Little White Tiger and her whole.

In fact, after enduring several days of hunger, Little Heavenly Demon had already been observing Little White Tiger with glittery eyes.

Little Heavenly Demon stared at Ye Qingtang in confusion. It finally stopped struggling after some time.

Ye Qingtang saw that it seemed to understand. She had Little White Tiger wait by the side, while she brought the little Heavenly Demon over to hunt. In case the little Heavenly Demon didn’t understand her plan, Little White Tiger could immediately scurry over and carry them away.

After making all the proper preparations, Ye Qingtang carried the little Heavenly Demon over to that sleeping ice beast.

If not for the little Heavenly Demon beside her, Ye Qingtang would never dream of doing something so insane just for a bit of food.

A Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm human bold enough to provoke a Paragon level monster. Wasn’t she just seeking death?!

Slowly but surely, Ye Qingtang approached the slumbering monster. Then she placed little Heavenly Demon under a tree while she went nearer by herself.

Little Heavenly Demon didn’t know what Ye Qingtang wanted to do. All it could think about was how to swallow that huge creature in front of it.

The ice beast seemed to detect Ye Qingtang’s presence. It suddenly opened those big eyes which immediately locked upon her.

With an almighty roar, the ice beast scrambled to its feet and charged toward Ye Qingtang!
