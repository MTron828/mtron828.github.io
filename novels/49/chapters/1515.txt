Chapter 1516 Absolute Death 1

However, the moment he stepped into the fog, the white and black clouds of cotton suddenly rushed into his body from his mouth, nose, and ears. His body was filled out, and then he exploded in front of Ye Qingtang. His flesh and organs splashed onto the ground.

“...” Ye Qingtang, who wanted to retreat from the same path, now totally gave up on that thought.

She felt that the fog was peculiar, yet now...

It seemed normal when they first entered, but it would kill them if they tried to re-enter from the inside of the forbidden land.

Ye Qingtang was not sure whether her guess was correct, but she did not have a life to spare to confirm her thoughts.

The sky above her head was covered by the fog.

The voice transmission stone was not working, and there were three monsters consuming human organs. Ye Qingtang really felt that she was on the path to death. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Those disciples of the Jiang Family finished their last breath and lied flat on the ground. Death just helped them to break free from the torture.

However, the moment they died, the three monsters who were eating the organs suddenly seemed to lose interest in the dead food. They immediately threw away the unfinished organs in their hands and looked for new prey around.

They landed their sight on the only two alive creatures there.

Ye Qingtang and the little white tiger...

Ye Qingtang stared at the malicious monsters. Though she had not fought with them yet, she could feel that these monsters’ abilities were above the Holy Venerate stage...

Their abilities were definitely not questionable since they could survive in such a horrifying forbidden place.

Fighting against three Holy Venerate stage monsters?

Ye Qingtang was definitely not capable of that.

When Ye Qingtang thought she and the little white tiger might die here today, the three monsters seemed to be able to tell what she was thinking and walked slowly towards her.

Ye Qingtang felt a cold sweat on her forehead. She secretly stimulated all energy in her body to find a chance of survival.

A stream of hot air came out from the monsters’ noses. Ye Qingtang was about to use all her strength to fight them as they walked over. However, the three monsters surrounded her up and did not have any intention to attack her. They just sniffed around her body.

It seemed like they were trying to probe and sense.

“Did they treat us as kin because of the blood of the big demon on our body...” The little white tiger murmured after seeing that the three malicious monsters did not attack them immediately.

Ye Qingtang did not dare to let her guard down, but she had the same thought.

Previously, she felt strange when the black strings did not attack her; now, the three monsters also did not seem to want to attack her.

Ye Qingtang looked at the big demon’s blood on her and the little white tiger’s body. The little white tiger’s assumption might be true.

The big demon and the monsters should be of the same clan. They must be familiar with the big demon’s smell and have treated her as the same creature.

Ye Qingtang probed and took a step forward with the assumption in mind.

The three monsters did not intend to attack or stop her. They just followed her by her feet and continued to sniff.

Ye Qingtang sighed in relief secretly and tried to walk forward.

The three monsters just followed behind her slowly. They walked with four legs and lifted up their heads to sniff.
