Chapter 946 Price (1)

“This mainland was transformed by a Spiritual Abode, and a hidden ancient clan in the Central Mainland has already received the news. In no time, they will come here to destroy everything and obtain the Spiritual Abode. I want to destroy this mainland before them so they will not be able to obtain the Spiritual Abode,” said Ling Yan.

Ling Yan had some enmity with that ancient clan, and his ultimate objective of coming to this mainland was to destroy it. Otherwise, once that ancient clan obtains the Spiritual Abode, their powers would skyrocket such that they would be able to control the First Domain.

“Ling Yan, you can destroy this mainland…” Ye Qingtang took a deep breath before looking up to meet Ling Yan’s eyes. “Over my dead body.”

“You don’t wish for me to do that?” Ling Yan asked gently as he looked at her bright eyes.

“My loved ones and friends are in this mainland. It is where I am raised and nurtured until now.” Ye Qingtang replied.

Perhaps Ling Yan’s skills were not anything significant, but what was really scary about him was his intelligence. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

If he really wished to do that, no one would be able to guess how he would go about it.

After listening to what Ye Qingtang said, Ling Yan pondered for a moment and eventually said, “It’s possible to not destroy this mainland, but you must pay a certain price.”

“What price?” Ye Qingtang asked instinctively.

Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan, perplexed. To protect this mainland, she still had to pay a price…

However, it seemed that Ling Yan still had not understood the situation. Leaving aside the fact that Ye Qingtang was already at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven realm and possesses the Devouring Bloodline and original Phoenix Bloodline, given Ling Yan’s martial skills, it was child’s play to kill Ling Yan even if her skills had not improved.

However, Ye Qingtang did not wish for such a thing to happen. She did not want this mainland to be destroyed in Ling Yan’s hands, and neither did she wish to hurt Ling Yan.

She could not kill Ling Yan as he played a part in her rebirth, not to mention the several times he helped her before.

The so-called price, however, piqued Ye Qingtang’s curiosity.

Ling Yan walked forward slowly as his crescent-like eyes stared right into her eyes.

Before Ye Qingtang returned to her senses, Ling Yan’s lips touched Ye Qingtang’s lips gently like a dragonfly skimming the water surface and parted immediately after a touch.

The slight warmth that came with the contact disappeared instantly.

It seemed unreal.

Dumbfounded, Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan in surprise.

“This is the price that you have to pay.” Ling Yan stared at Ye Qingtang and said slowly as he flashed an unknowing smile.

The price… that she had to pay?!

Ye Qingtang recovered from her surprise. An unreal warmth seemed to still linger on her lips.

In just a moment, Ye Qingtang widened her eyes, and she glared at Ling Yan.

For some reason, she felt that this scene was familiar.

“You…” Ye Qingtang was about to slap this fellow, but before she could lash out, Ling Yan’s expression suddenly turned serious, and he said, “If I don’t destroy this mainland, I’m afraid it will still be taken away by the ancient clan. The miserable fate of this mainland is still unavoidable.”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback. The impulse to slap Ling Yan was all gone as all her attention was instantly attracted by what Ling Yan said.
