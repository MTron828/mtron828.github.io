Chapter 2687: Fourth Domain (7)

The disciples of the Great Immortal Temple were not as numerous as those from the other supreme factions. Every single one of them was an extremely rare and precious jewel. If they entered and lost a few disciples, the upper echelons would be in a furor.

Ye Qingtang once again felt immense pressure. As the leader, if one or two senior brothers and sisters died after entering the Fourth Domain, she would most likely have to bear the consequences. It was very stressful…

“Uncle-Master, may I ask when we can enter the void rift?” Ye Qingtang asked the Absolute Heaven Saint.

The Absolute Saint examined the void rift again before he said, “You should be able to enter in a few days.”

...

Over the next few days, Ye Qingtang and the disciples of the Great Immortal Temple gathered together every second to discuss their various strategies.

In short, their goal was to find the relic and keep it safe without provoking any supreme factions. But if anyone came to snatch it from them, well then, they wouldn’t hold back.

Of course, if the Paragon Relic were to appear and be snatched away by the disciples of other supreme factions, they would have no choice but to fight them for it.

The main goal was to get the Paragon relic. In addition, they could not let any one of the disciples of the Great Immortal Temple lose their lives. Finally, they also could not afford to offend the disciples of other supreme factions.

Apart from that, Ye Qingtang also scouted for information about the Temple of Paragon and Ling Yan. However, those two people seemed to have disappeared and there was no news of them at all.

Over the past few days, the various major factions had been living in harmony. They were conserving their energy and waiting for the void rift to widen so that their juniors could enter.

...

A few days later.

The Absolute Heaven Saint brought Ye Qingtang and the rest to the void rift. The current void rift was much bigger than what they had seen a few days ago, but the pressure it exuded had diminished somewhat.

“It’s about time.” The Absolute Heaven Saint looked at the disciples of the Great Immortal Temple. “You must remember that after entering the void rift, you must obey Ye Yue’s orders and not act rashly.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

The Absolute Heaven Saint had repeated the same thing countless times over the past few days. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Master, I believe all my senior brothers and sisters are already aware of this. Why doesn’t… Master just send us in first?” Xie Jun piped up from the side.

“Have you prepared your food and necessities? We don’t know what’s going on in the void rift. You must be fully prepared,” the Absolute Heaven Saint reminded them.

“Uncle-Master, don’t worry. Everything is ready,” said Ye Qingtang.

“Uncle-Master, we’re not children. You’re worrying too much,” Lan Shan said with a smile.

Ye Qingtang smiled faintly. Uncle Master Absolute Heaven Saint was behaving like a parent sending his children off on a long journey for the first time.

“Cut the crap,” the Absolute Heaven Saint chided unhappily.

Before anyone could respond, the Absolute Heaven Saint raised his hand.

In the next second, everyone’s vision turned dark, and their bodies seemed to have fallen into a bottomless abyss.

...

An unknown period passed. It felt like a blink of an eye, but also like hundreds of years.

Ye Qingtang slowly opened her eyes. What she saw shocked her and her pupils constricted.

“It’s so cold…”

At that moment, all the disciples of Great Immortal Temple had woken up and were looking around in confusion.
