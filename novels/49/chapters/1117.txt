Chapter 1118 Wrath 2

Shenchao Sect’s female disciples were extremely tragic. Some tough female disciples knew what kind of torture they would face in the future and suicided at the scene while more than half of the men were slaughtered in a flash.

At this instant, Blood Moon Elder personally witnessed the hell-like scene and was stunned. “This… this is the Central Mainland ancient clan’s style of work?!”

Blood Moon Elder simply could not understand how such a ruthless ancient clan could survive until now and even had an inheritance of ten thousand years. Were they still human? Even calling them beasts was an insult to beasts!

Even Blood Moon Sect, who was known by this mainland to be the heterodox evil cult, had never done such shameless and low-down things.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. Looking at the tragic sight, the miserable cries echoed in her ears, and all warmth had drained from her eyes.

It was not the first time Ye Qingtang witnessed such extreme bullying of the weak.

Wars between a high-level mainland and a low-level mainland had always been this way…

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang once participated in a war between mainlands before and had seen plenty of such incidents.

Just as that black-robed man from You Ancient Clan had said, kindness was for humans. If it was warfare between the forces of the Central Mainland, such things definitely would not happen. However, it was different when a high-level mainland warred against a low-level mainland…

The superiority complex of people at high-level mainlands… would make it so that they would never treat the cultivators of low-level mainlands as humans. In the eyes of these high-level mainlands’ cultivators, the low-level mainlands’ cultivators were no different from pigs or dogs. Slaughter or humiliate, they would not be guilt-ridden. This was the evil nature… of humans…

Despair enshrouded the entire Shenchao Sect. Looking at the devastating sight before his eyes, Shenchao Sect Grand Elder was pale as despair had almost drowned him completely.

In despair, the Shenchao Sect Grand Elder could only pray to the heavens for a miracle to befall.

However…

When Shenchao Sect Grand Elder looked at the sky, his eyes coincidentally spotted Ye Qingtang who was in the sky.

“Yang… Yang Lord?!”

Shenchao Sect Grand Elder was shaken for that moment.

He clearly sensed the aura around Ye Qingtang that she accidentally revealed. That overbearing energy caused the Shenchao Sect Grand Elder to wince, and a trace of hope appeared in his eyes…

“Please… I’m begging you… Yang Lord… Please do something… and save us!!”

In his despair, the Shenchao Sect Grand Elder seemed to have found a straw to clutch at and immediately kneeled to Ye Qingtang.

Although the Shenchao Sect Grand Elder did not think that a Yang Lord would be willing to interfere in this matter… this was his last hope!Even if… she could only protect these Shenchao Sect disciples, it was also fine!!

Swoosh!

Almost at the same time when the Shenchao Sect Grand Elder kneeled down, Ye Qingtang’s body turned into a flash of shadow and disappeared from the sky. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

When she appeared once again, she was already within Shenchao Sect.

Her cold eyes swept across the hell-like scene before her, and the coldness in her eyes seemed to be able to freeze the air in her surroundings.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang suddenly took a step forward, and her floating figure directly arrived beside a Shenchao Sect female disciple who was about to be humiliated.

That lady’s eyes were filled with fear. When she saw that the person who appeared before her was actually an exceedingly beautiful lady, she grabbed onto the edge of Ye Qingtang’s clothes tightly.

“Save… save me…”
