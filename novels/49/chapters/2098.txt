Chapter 2099: The Disintegrating Seal (3)

Without the control of Elder Yuan, Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue would be regaining their will soon.

“My dear, I’ve missed you so much.” Ye Qingtang was in a great mood. Scooping up the little lightning dragon into her hands, she gave it a light kiss.

The little lightning dragon opened its eyes sleepily. It looked at Ye Qingtang in confusion, as though it had just taken a nap instead of being devoured. It was confused as to why Ye Qingtang was acting so warmly towards it.

The little lightning dragon was back. Did that mean her master and father were back to normal?

She wanted nothing more than to check for herself right then but... the thought of where she was deflated right away.

“Do the people from the Temple of Paragon... actually think that I’m the reincarnation of their Holy Lord?” Her eyebrows furrowed slightly.

She had no choice but to impersonate the Holy Lord of Shadows previously and had almost lost her life a few times in the process.

There was no way she wanted to experience that again, and the Temple of Paragon was over a hundred times more powerful than the Temple of Shadows.

Even 10 lives wouldn’t be enough for her to mess with this giant.

Ye Qingtang was determined to not have anything to do with the Temple of Paragon. She was going to deny any connection with their Holy Lord to the end and leave as early as possible.

Just as she was thinking about this, a sudden pain shot through her chest.

The immense pain made her break into a cold sweat and she passed out.

A ball of light floated in front of her chest.

The light gradually faded as black mist covered it.

The little lightning dragon sensed the black mist and curled up.

Poof! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

A black orb emerged from the light and jumped in front of the little lightning dragon.

The little lightning dragon was trembling.

It was here again!

The little black orb shook itself. It seemed to be extremely weak now and looked at the little lightning dragon without having any intention to enter it.

“D*mned Divine Phoenix, why did it have to seal me!” The little black orb jumped up and down. It had been sealed by the Divine Phoenix in the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. It couldn’t move an inch and most of its time was spent in deep slumber.

Fortunately, the seal had slowly disintegrated during this period and it could start regaining its consciousness.

The black orb started panicking when it saw the unconscious Ye Qingtang.

“Mother... mother...”

It knew that Ye Qingtang had left the First Mainland, and probably even the First Domain. Han Cangming had already vanished for a long time and hadn’t shown himself since.

“What went wrong?”

The little black orb was extremely confused. It had no idea when things had started deviating from what it had thought would happen.

“Mother, you have to find father soon...” the little black orb murmured. It was so weak that it couldn’t even take over the little lightning dragon’s body. The light suddenly shone again.

In the next second, the little black orb was sucked back into the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

The Divine Phoenix’s seal had not completely disintegrated yet.

D*mned Divine Phoenix!

Ye Qingtang gradually woke up. She felt as though she had just been dragged out of the water. There was still an immense pressure on her chest which made her want to throw up.
