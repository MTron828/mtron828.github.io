Chapter 99: Sect Assessment (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

However, Yun Shu always had the same personality. This was the reason why he took care of Ye Qingtang in her previous life even though she had almost no endowment.

Ye Qingtang could not help but laugh when she thought about her previous life. However, when she remembered Yun Shu’s destiny in her previous life, her eyes suddenly appeared to be fierce.

Senior Brother Yun saved her once in the previous life. This time, she would ensure that he had nothing to worry about in his entire life.

Yun Shu did not know what Ye Qingtang was thinking about. He thanked her wholeheartedly.

However, a pair of fierce and evil eyes scanned Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu.

Lu Xiuwen squinted his eyes. He had a decent endowment. The only person he could treat as an opponent in this assessment was Yun Shu, born in the Liuyun family clan. However, he did not expect that Yun Shu would be so gentle towards Ye Qingtang.

Candidates who finished the Path to Heaven were waiting for further assessment. They were not aware that their behaviors were observed by the faction Elders from the shiny pearl on the sect door. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“What do you think of the candidates this year? Anyone suitable?” One of the faction Elders was observing through the Water Moon Mirror and asked the rest of the Elders.

“Not many stand out this year. But I think Yun Shu from the Liu Yun family and Lu Xiuwen from the Formidable Heavens Dynasty are not too bad. They should be able to pass the assessment.” One of the Elder touched his beard and said.

“Both Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen have a good background and endowment. As the Elder of the Sword Faction, Elder Lin, you have a sharp sight.”

Candidates who passed the assessment could enter Xuanling Sect and become outer sect disciples. After training, they then had the opportunity to enter the inner sect. Within Xuanling Sect, there were the Sword Faction, Herbal Faction, Array Faction, and Fist Faction. Among the four factions, the Sword Faction was the strongest. Xuanling Sect was famous for its Sword Sect. Elder Lin was the person in charge of the Sword Faction. He stood at quite a high position among the Elders.

Besides Elder Lin, the rest of the Elders of other factions also focused on Lu Xiuwen and Yun Shu.

While everyone fixed their eyesights on the two people, one small-figured Elder with an extremely sharp sight noticed the girl who was chatting with Yun Shu through the Water Moon Mirror.

“All of you think highly of Yun Shu and Lu Xiuwen, but I feel this girl is quite interesting.” The Elder smiled and said.

The rest of the Elders turned and stared at him.

“I think the girl was recommended by Mu Su. She is called Ye Qingtang with no special background. No one has heard of this name as well.” The Elder of the Herbal Faction said.

“Ye Qingtang? Is she from the Ye family of Lin Town?” The Elder of the Fist Faction raised his eyebrows slightly and said.

“The Ye family of Lin Town was not famous in the past. However, there was a genius with a green spirit root who became the disciple of Yunxiao Sect. I think Ye Qingtang is from the same family. However, it would be impossible for Ye Qingtang to stand out when there is Ye You.” Elder Lin took a glance and showed no more interest.

It was a miracle for a not-so-famous family clan to have a genius. It would be impossible to have two.

“Things are not predictable. I like this girl a lot. Just now on the Path to Heaven, she was much more stable than the two people from the Liu Yun family and the Formidable Heavens Dynasty.” The Elder who had a special preference for Ye Qingtang did not bother with what the rest said.

“The Path to Heaven only focuses on one’s state of mind and not their endowment. Even though the Array Faction that you are in charge of does not have high requirements for spirit root, you should not be so confident of that now, Elder Qin.” Elder Lin glanced at the Elder.

“We shall wait to see her spirit root then.” The Elder of the Herbal Faction suggested.
