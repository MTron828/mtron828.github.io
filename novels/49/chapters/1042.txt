Chapter 1043 Who is Afraid of Who (3)

Noticing the situation, the Yunxiao Sect Great Elder was stunned and was even in disbelief.

Originally, he thought that Bai Kui would definitely not dare to really take action, yet currently…

“You have a death wish!”

The Yunxiao Sect wardens hollered furiously and slashed their swords at the Yin Yang Perfected Lords charging towards them.

A warden’s eyes were filled with malice and evil as he attacked a Branch Master of the Ye Family.

That Branch Master joined the Ye Family not long ago, but he was extremely skilled. His energy and aura were overwhelming and even more powerful than ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lords, which was why Ye Qingtang specially appointed him as a Branch Master.

Boom, boom!!

In the next second, the Yunxiao Sect warden’s sword landed on the Branch Master’s left shoulder. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

However, at this instant, the Yunxiao Sect warden was appalled.

When his sword landed on this person, it was as though he was slashing extremely hard metal. The Ye Family Branch Master was unharmed, and the YunXiao Sect warden’s hand numbed instead.

“Do you… only have this little strength?” The Ye Family Branch Master looked at the Yunxiao Sect warden and immediately stretched his neck. “How disappointing.”

“You…” The Yunxiao Sect warden was infuriated. However, after sensing the aura of this middle-aged man before him, he was instantly dumbfounded, and his eyes widened.

“Yin Yang… Perfected Lord?!”

This Yunxiao Sect warden never thought that this plain-looking middle-aged man would actually be a Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

“Die!”

The Ye Family Branch master shouted coldly and gently slashed the Yunxiao Sect warden’s neck using his palm as a knife.

In an instant, the Yunxiao Sect warden’s skull flew to the sky while his headless body staggered a few steps before falling to the ground. He was breathless in no time and died.

“Yin Yang Perfected Lord…”

“Also a Yin Yang Perfected Lord…”

“How can it be!”

The ordinary elders and wardens of Yunxiao Sect paled after sensing the aura of the powerful figures of the Ye Family.

There were several Yin Yang Perfected Lords among the cultivators that Bai Kui brought over…!

There were only a few Yin Yang Perfected Lords in Yunxiao Sect…

“Get lost!”

The Yunxiao Sect Great Elder yelled angrily and focused power in his fingertip to force a Yin Yang Perfected Lord to retreat.

The Yunxiao Sect Great Elder had already reached the peak of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Second Heaven, and it was simply impossible for an ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lord to fight against him.

“Zhou Tian, let me play with you!”

Suddenly, Daoist Zijin leaped out and instantly turned into fast shadows that intersected and overlapped each other in the air so rapidly that one could not distinguish him with the naked eye.

“Daoist Zijin?!” The Yunxiao Sect Great Elder was astonished to see Daoist Zijin.

Daoist Zijin was renowned and had a reputation in this mainland.

However, why would he and the Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui come here to fight against Yunxiao Sect?!

“Humph!”

The Yunxiao Sect Great Elder sneered as his palm met Daoist Zijin’s.

Boom!

A loud sound erupted as though the sky exploded.

The Yunxiao Sect Great Elder retreated backward as blood seeped out from the corners of his mouth, clearly in the disadvantage from the one-palm confrontation with Daoist Zijin earlier.
