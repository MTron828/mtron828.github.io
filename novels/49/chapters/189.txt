“Thank you for your concern, elder. He is already fine,” Zhou Xuan said calmly, but a sharp look flashed across his eyes.

Elder Huang did not notice Zhou Xuan’s expression and merely nodded his head. “Although you and Zhou Qu are brothers, your brother’s natural talent is far from yours. You need to focus on cultivation instead and not let down this gift of yours.”

“Yes,” Zhou Xuan replied.

“There is nothing here already. You can go down first,” Elder Huang said and waved a hand.

Zhou Xuan left and directly headed to Zhou Qu’s room.

Zhou Qu was already much better now and was chatting with a group of disciples. When he saw Zhou Xuan, his face turned white, dispersed the group immediately, and then went up to him carefully.

“Big brother, you’re here.”

Zhou Xuan frowned slightly. He was very unhappy to see Zhou Qu’s cowardly behavior but could only bear with it because he was his brother.

“Who did you say was the person who injured you?”

Half a month ago, he suddenly heard that his brother, Zhou Qu, was severely beaten up by someone, and he had to lie in bed for a week because of this injury. Although Zhou Qu was not skilled, he was still his brother. Who did not know about his relationship with Zhou Qu in the outer sect?

Even though Zhou Qu took advantage of Zhou Xuan’s influence, no one dared to go against Zhou Xuan, and anyone would still give Zhou Qu some face.

But this time when Zhou Qu was beaten up, Zhou Xuan completely lost face.

Zhou Qu felt wronged immediately when he heard the question.

“Big brother, you must seek revenge for me. It was all done by Ye Qingtang, that little bitch. She is a new disciple but dared to injure me. I…”

“Shut up!” Zhou Xuan’s face turned cold and glared at Zhou Qu until he kept quiet. “That Ye Qingtang is only a new disciple. You have been in the outer sect for many years and barely obtained the thousandth rank, but you can’t even beat a newly entered disciple. How do you have the face to say it!”

Zhou Qu completely lost his face because of Zhou Xuan’s scolding but did not dare to resist as well; thus, he could only lower his head timidly without making a noise.

Zhou Xuan looked at his brother’s good-for-nothing behavior and was boiling with anger.

“I’ll remember this incident. I went to look for Ye Qingtang when you told me about it the other time. However, she was out on a mission and was not in the sect. Perhaps, she is back now already. You better behave yourself during this period of time and stop going around to embarrass me!” Zhou Xuan warned Zhou Qu with a glare.

Happiness filled his heart when Zhou Qu heard his brother’s words.

Zhou Xuan was way more skilled than him, and if Zhou Xuan was willing to take action, Ye Qingtang would definitely not be able to fight back regardless of her abilities.

“Thank you, big brother. I will definitely listen to you on every matter. Right, big brother, these are the bottles of Xi Spirit Pills that I got from this batch of new disciples.

Zhou Xuan looked over and kept them naturally. He asked with a slight frown, “Why are there only these few bottles this time?”

Not only did Zhou Xuan know about Zhou Qu’s arena, he silently consented to it as well. Every time, a portion of the Xi Spirit Pills that Zhou Qu obtained would be pocketed by Zhou Xuan, who was more than happy to do so.

Zhou Qu replied, “It’s all Ye Qingtang, who used some tricks and cheated a few bottles of Xi Spirit Pills from me.”

“Oh?” Zhou Xuan raised a brow, and his lips formed a sneer.

“Ye Qingtang, you’re good. You just entered the sect, yet you are so disobedient already. Previously, Senior Brother Ning from the inner sect already ordered me to “take good care” of her. Now, not only did she injure you, she even dares to snatch my Xi Spirit Pills? I will definitely settle all these new and old scores with her.”
