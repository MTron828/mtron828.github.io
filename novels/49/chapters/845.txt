Chapter 846 Cannot Defeat It

When Ye Qingtang walked to the end, she realized that the light was shining from ahead, and there was a massive, heaven-like mountain valley outside.

Standing at the end of the pathway, Ye Qingtang could even hear the sound of flowing water and chirping of birds.

“This… Is the Dragon Vein in the mountain valley?” The little white tiger sized up the mountain valley with curiosity etched on its face.

Ye Qingtang remained silent for a moment and replied. “It should be that the spirit energy in this place condensed into an independent Small World.”

This situation was not considered rare. Back when Ye Qingtang was at her peak, she saw many instances of spirit energy condensing into a Small World, and sometimes, there were even humans in a mystic realm in the Second Domain. Those humans who were condensed by the mystic realm had terrifying combat powers-almost that of an Emperor-level figure—and were even more intelligent. They possessed their independent consciousness and saw themselves as the real humans.

Associating it with the Dragon Vein’s situation, it seemed to be rather similar to those scary mystic realms that Ye Qingtang saw in the Second Domain back then.

“Diamond Boulder…”

In the next second, Ye Qingtang saw that the Diamond Boulder that hosted the Everlasting Flower actually appeared in a stream and was moving its body leisurely.

“F*ck. A rotten stone is actually bathing!” The little white tiger widened its eyes and could not refrain from swearing.

“Chase after it,” Ye Qingtang said with a frown.

However, the little white tiger shook its head. “Are you going to pluck its Everlasting Flower or courting death?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Of course to pluck the Everlasting Flower.” Ye Qingtang had an odd expression in her eyes as she did not know why would the little white tiger say that.

“So… you’re not afraid of being beaten to death by that rotten stone?” The little white tiger stared at Ye Qingtang even more strangely.

Immediately, Ye Qingtang sized up the Golden Boulder in the stream, but she could not tell what threat it would be to her.

“The speed that it ran away just now is at least that of a human Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven or Seventh Heaven. If you look for it, I’m afraid it’ll kill us both.” The little white tiger rolled its eyes at Ye Qingtang.

“That may not be so. Xiao Guai is extremely fast as well,” Ye Qingtang said.

“That’s true too. That rotten wolf’s speed is not ordinary.” The little white tiger nodded and subsequently looked around its surroundings. “Eh… Where’s the wolf?”

When the little white tiger said that, Ye Qingtang was alarmed and looked around hurriedly.

However, the silver wolf was already nowhere to be seen.

Ye Qingtang hit her forehead in frustration. Xiao Guai is lost!

“Where did that rotten wolf go to…” The little white tiger mumbled. After a moment, it seemed to recall something and said immediately, “F*ck. I remember already! When we encountered those scarecrows just now, the rotten wolf was the first to run. It was too fast and vanished in an instant!”

Ye Qingtang was a little relieved after hearing that. All was good as long as Xiao Guai was not in danger.

“Look. At such critical moments, whatever wolf and ball are all not reliable.” The little white tiger scoffed.

“Ball? What ball?” Ye Qingtang did not understand.

“Black ball,” the little white tiger said.

“Black ball?” Ye Qingtang was even more confused.

“Look, that rotten stone ran away!” The little white tiger looked at the bottom of the mountain valley.

Ye Qingtang looked over after hearing, and indeed, the Diamond Boulder had already left the stream.

“I can smell a dangerous air on that stone. I’m afraid that even if we joined forces, we may not be able to defeat it.” The little white tiger commented thoughtfully.
