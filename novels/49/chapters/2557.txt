Chapter 2558: Ancient God Karma Tunnel (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“How do you know so much about the Ancient God Karma Tunnel? Have you entered it before?”

Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog curiously.

Ye Qingtang had never even heard of this Ancient God Karma Tunnel over her two lifetimes. However, the big yellow dog knew so much about it as if it had entered before.

The big yellow dog did not answer Ye Qingtang’s question. It just fell into silence and said after a while, “That’s not important. What’s important is that an Ancient God Karma Tunnel has appeared in this place. If you want to absorb your heart’s Heavenly Dao energy, you can try it.”

“What is inside the Ancient God Karma Tunnel? Why can one absorb the power of the Heavenly Dao after entering this tunnel?” Ye Qingtang was unable to understand.

“Every time the Ancient God Karma Tunnel is opened, no one knows what’s inside. It might hold something so evil that even the deities cannot endure, or it might be a wonderland. If it’s a wonderland, you can succeed in whatever you want. If it’s something evil, you have no choice but to just wait for death,” the big yellow dog said.

“So there’s actually such a mysterious realm in this world…” Ye Qingtang had never heard of such a thing. Successfully achieve whatever she wanted?

If she wanted to become a god, could she really become one?

The big yellow dog thought for a moment and added, “Of course, the so-called achievement of one’s aspirations must remain within the rules. It’s impossible to transcend the rules. Actually, it’s not as simple as I made it out to be. Everything can only be known after one enters it.”

Ancient Gods existed in both the upper and lower realms. However, in the big yellow dog’s memory, the last time the Ancient God Karma Tunnel opened was a very long time ago.

Ye Qingtang was tempted by the yellow dog’s description of the Ancient God Karma Tunnel. She was not afraid of danger. As a person who had lived two lifetimes, she had experienced all kinds of dangers and extreme evil. What she always lacked was a huge opportunity.

Truly powerful practitioners all had obtained great opportunities, but she did not. Therefore, she was still unable to become a truly powerful practitioner.

If that Ancient God Karma Tunnel was really as the big yellow dog said, Ye Qingtang was willing to take a risk. Be it a doomed hell or a blessed paradise. Otherwise, her future road might be even more dangerous.

“I want to try.”

After a long time, Ye Qingtang made up her mind.

“Little girl, this isn’t something that you can enter as and when you want. Some people don’t have this opportunity. The unique laws of the ancient gods might not let you in. You can only depend on the will of the heavens. Furthermore, once the Ancient God Karma Tunnel opens, auspicious signs will descend from the heavens. Who knows how many factions will view the Ancient God Karma Tunnel as a huge opportunity? I’m afraid they will all fight for it. You have to satisfy two conditions first. The first is to avoid all the major factions and sneak in. The second is to obtain the recognition of the ancient gods. Without either one, you won’t stand a chance.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail. “Besides, the most terrifying thing is that even if you complete both conditions, you might not arrive at a wonderland, but instead land in hell. Not only will you be unable to accomplish your goal, but you might also even lose your little life. That would be so terrible.”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. “I already feel terrible just looking at you now.”

She had already made up her mind, and now this dog was giving her such a blow.

Wasn’t it the one that had just been promoting the Ancient God Karma Tunnel to her earlier? Now, it was making it sound like a worthless venture…
