The Flying Star Academy teacher, Lu Yuanxiang and the rest sized up the surroundings, before following Ye Qing.

A moment later, everyone arrived at the pile of corpses.

Lu Yuanxiang looked at Ye Qing and was about to say something when he saw that Ye Qing had smeared the dead demons’ blood on his body.

“Oh my god, Boss, what are you doing… so disgusting!” Nangong Lie stared at Ye Qing in shock. Was Boss using the blood of demons to bathe?!

Lei Yan was also dumbfounded. “Boss, didn’t know you have this kind of fetish. Um, Boss, let me ask you. You aren’t interested in human blood too, right?”

In the eyes of Lei Yan and Nangong Lie, Ye Qing’s actions could be described as perverted.

What kind of special fetish was this? Smearing blood on oneself?

After hearing what Nangong Lie and Lei Yan said, the Flying Star Academy teacher and Lu Yuanxiang also stared at Ye Qing with strange expressions.

Could it be Teacher Ye Qing really had some kind of strange fetish?

“Cut the crap. You guys put it on too.” Ye Qingtang glanced at Lei Yan and Nangong Lie.

Stunned, the two of them exchanged looks. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Erm, Boss, it’s not a problem for us to climb mountains of blades or dive into a sea of flames for you… however, I have a serious obsession with cleanliness, and I really can’t force myself to do this. I think I don’t need it. But Lei Yan should be able to.” As soon as he finished speaking, Nangong Lie’s gaze descended onto Lei Yan.

“Get lost! I can’t either!” Lei Yan hastily shook his head.

“Teacher Ye Qing, is there a reason why you smeared the demon blood on yourself?” Lu Yuanxiang asked curiously.

Lu Yuanxiang did not really believe that Ye Qing had any special fetish. Since Ye Qing asked them to do this, there should be some reason behind it. They did not know much about demons and Lu Yuanxiang himself lacked the knowledge.

“Demons rely on scent to distinguish between the different races and their own kind,” Ye Qingtang explained softly.

Before anyone could react, Lu Yuanxiang pushed the Flying Star Academy teacher aside and ran to the pile of corpses. Without a word, he immediately smeared a large amount of demon blood on himself.

“Ah! So that’s how it is!” Realization dawned upon the Flying Star Academy teacher. He ran to Lu Yuanxiang’s side and said, “Old man, you’re taking everything for yourself! Leave some for us!”

“Don’t snatch…. What’s wrong with you?” Nangong Lie glared fiercely at Lei Yan.

“Nangong Lie, aren’t you a clean freak?!” Lei Yan frowned.

“Clean freak?” Nangong Lie laughed coldly. “Bullshit! As an expert martial arts practitioner, I’m destined to become a great lord in the future. How could I possibly be a clean freak… don’t slander me.”

“Wait.”

Suddenly, Lu Yuanxiang’s expression changed. “Something is coming!”

As soon as Lu Yuanxiang finished speaking, everyone stopped smearing the demon blood and followed his gaze.

After a few breaths, a demon appeared in everyone’s sight.

“Which tribe are you from?!”

The demon shouted sternly when he saw Ye Qingtang, Lu Yuanxiang and the others with their strange garments.
