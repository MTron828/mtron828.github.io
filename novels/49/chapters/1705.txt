Chapter 1706: Tasting the Consequences (1)

Mu Ruxue’s face went completely pale when she saw those voting slips that had been “lost and found”.

How did those voting slips end up in Jiang Shaobai’s possession?!

Mu Ruxue instinctively looked at the youth who had been tasked to steal those votes. He was also looking very grim.

He clearly remembered taking those votes and burning them together with the box. How was it that those votes were not burnt?

“Could you please check to see if these are the missing votes?” Jiang Shaobai asked the restaurant servant, completely ignoring Mu Ruxue’s stoic expression.

The servant gave a start before nodding with a smile.

Although they were the organizers of the top beauty rankings, they were actually only in charge of storing the votes. Nevertheless, it looked bad on them that the votes went missing. They were naturally relieved that the votes had been recovered.

“Jiang Shaobai, where did you get these counterfeit votes? Even if you wish to help Ye Qingtang, you don’t have to stoop so low.” Mu Ruxue steadied her racing heart as she countered.

“We will know soon if the votes are real or fake.” Jiang Shaobai walked back to stand beside Ye Qingtang. He leaned lazily against Ye Qingtang and gave a big yawn.

“Each of these votes were written by a different person. Who can tell if they are real or fake? Apart from recognizing our own handwriting, no one else can ascertain the authenticity. We won’t know if you secretly added in votes of your own,” Mu Ruxue continued to argue.

“Mu Ruxue, it’s good to have brains. A pity that you don’t have any. Don’t you know that the Island of Immortal Footsteps people will make a mark on all votes which were handed over to them?” Jiang Shaobai chuckled. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Mu Ruxue’s face instantly turned even paler.

Worried that there might be people who would try to submit more than one vote, the Island of Immortal Footsteps folks recorded down everyone who had already voted. To make things fair, they also made a special mark on each vote. Apart from people from the Island of Immortal Footsteps, no one else could replicate that mark.

The restaurant servant soon checked all votes and ascertained that they were the missing votes. Since the missing votes were found, they would have to conduct a recount.

Mu Ruxue watched as her own name was steadily erased from the top.

This time, the restaurant servant opened each vote in front of everyone and read out the name.

Ye Qingtang’s numbers soared as the counting of the votes went on. Meanwhile, Mu Ruxue’s face had turned from fair to pitch black.

She never imagined that her flawless plan could be ruined by that Jiang Shaobai!

“Trying to gain an advantage only to end up worse off than before. This phrase describes Mu Ruxue perfectly,” Jiang Yisheng commented with satisfaction as he observed Mu Ruxue’s increasingly grim face.

Didn’t she try all means to be top?

Even the heavens couldn’t help her now.

After the last vote was read out, Ye Qingtang was leading by a wide margin. The number of votes for Ye Qingtang was nearly double that of Mu Ruxue!

It must be pointed out that Ye Qingtang’s astonishing abilities during the final battles had raised her profile significantly.

On the other hand, although Mu Ruxue was pretty, her reputation among the youths plummeted after they witnessed the sight of her swollen face after her fight with Ye Qingtang.
