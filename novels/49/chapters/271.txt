“What do you want?” The Elder’s face was stiff. He could never imagine that one day, as the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect, he would be defeated by a sect disciple.

“What do I want?” Ye Qingtang lifted her eyebrows and smiled at the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect, who appeared very insidious. She knocked her fingers on the handle of the sword. The subtle vibration was transmitted to the Elder’s body through the sword. Though he would not be dead as there was no blood loss, the pain was extremely sharp.

Ye Qingtang squinted her eyes and bent her body lower. She stared at the red eyes of the Elder and suddenly said.

“Submission or death?”

The Elder’s face immediately darkened. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

How familiar the sentence was to him. That was what he said to the disciples of the Xuanling Sect previously!

“You dare to ask me to succumb? I am the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect. You are nobody! How dare you to… Arhhh….”

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect was still cursing, but the next second, Ye Qingtang just turned the handle of the sword.

The moment the edge of the sword was spinning in the body, the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect screamed in pain as his flesh was cut through by the sword.

Ye Qingtang just continued smiling at the Elder who held his fist tightly.

“How? If you don’t want to choose, I can help you. If I chop your head off and bring it back to the sect, I think I will get quite a lot of rewards.”

Disciples from all sects were murdered by the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect. Now, every sect was investigating the truth. It would be an amazing achievement to kill an Elder of the Blood Moon Sect.

The Elder’s face was extremely dark. He could never imagine that a disciple of an orthodox sect would be so cruel as well.

The sinister look in her eyes made the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect suspect that this girl was an undercover of some evil sect!

His influence in the past terrified all sects. However, he was forced to succumb to a sect disciple who appeared to be so vulnerable. He had never imagined such shame before.

Ye Qingtang was not in a rush, but her hands turned the sword slowly. The Elder was full of cold sweat from the pain, and there was no single trace of cruelty on him from when he killed the disciples previously.

Actually, Ye Qingtang never intended to kill the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect.

Even if she wanted to, she could not break the evil ability he had that kept him immortal.

Handing over the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect to the sect? She did not even think of that at all.

The heretic spirits that were suppressed were coming back to life now. They would be alive soon. Which sect dared to lock up an Elder of the Blood Moon Sect when it was so strong now? This was like asking the Blood Moon Sect to eliminate all the other sects.

She could not kill him or hand him over. Thus, she had another thought.

Even though the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect was useless now, when his power was fully recovered, he would be a horrifying presence then.

If she could use that power for herself, would it not be a great advantage for her?

Ye Qingtang had quite a few thoughts as she waited for the Elder to take the bait. However, her face was still filled with the evil smile that made the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect panic as if she would kill him anytime according to her mood.

It took him so much effort to regain his consciousness. If he was severely injured again, it would take at least a thousand years to recover.
