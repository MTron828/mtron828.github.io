Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Brother… You aren’t a citizen here, are you?” The slave master could not help but have a headache when he saw another person here to court death. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head.

“Haha. Brother, do you know that this is Young Sir Shangguan Rui, the son of Nine Nights Dynasty’s Dragon-Tiger General…” the slave master said.

“What… Dragon-Tiger General?” Shock filled Ye Qingtang’s face after hearing the slave master.

Before everyone could mock Ye Qingtang after seeing her expression, she said disdainfully, “So what? This blue-haired girl is destined to belong to me.”

Ye Qingtang walked up and stood in front of the blue-haired girl. Ignoring everyone’s gaze, she smiled and asked, “Do you really have the Yuan Returning Stone?”

“I… have… have the Yuan Returning Stone!” The blue-haired girl nodded repeatedly.

“Good. Since that’s the case, you are mine.” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up into a smile.

The slave master waved a hand rather impatiently. “This slave is already confirmed by Young Sir Shangguan Rui.”

“Confirmed by him?” Ye Qingtang scoffed. “This black market has its rules. That fellow has not paid, so it does not count.”

“Young Sir Shangguan…” The slave master looked at Shangguan Rui.

“Haha. The black market, of course, has its rules.” A sinister smile played on Shangguan Rui’s lips. “Let’s see what his financial capability is then.”

After saying that, Ye Qingtang took out a yellow-grade longsword from her space ring and threw it on the ground directly. “Is this enough?”

“A yellow-grade weapon?”

Everyone at the scene exchanged a look.

A yellow-grade weapon was extremely precious. To ordinary sects, some elite disciples could not even obtain it after working hard for years.

Seeing that the slave master remained silent, Ye Qingtang took out a bundle of weapons from her space ring and tossed it on the ground nonchalantly. “Is this enough?”

There were ten weapons in that one bundle!

Too many sect disciples died in the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, and Ye Qingtang picked up dozens of weapons on her way.

Currently, Yellow-grade weapons were not very useful to her anymore.

“Eleven Yellow-grade weapons…” The slave master looked at Ye Qingtang in surprise. What was this fellow’s background for him to be able to throw eleven Yellow-grade weapons out so casually?

The onlookers were similarly astounded.

“Young Sir Shangguan, look…”

The slave master was extremely tempted after seeing Ye Qingtang’s eleven Yellow-grade weapons.

Not mentioning one slave, even one hundred slaves were not worth these eleven Yellow-grade weapons!

“I’ll give you one more. This slave is mine.”

Then, the corner of Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up slightly as she retrieved a supreme yellow-grade weapon from her space ring.

“Supreme-grade!”

The slave master’s heart palpitated wildly. A supreme yellow-grade weapon!! A weapon that could weigh against dozens of ordinary yellow-grade weapon!

Ye Qingtang also had quite a few weapons of similar grade in her space ring which were all obtained from the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm.

There was no reluctance in throwing a few swords out.

“Young Sir Shangguan… How about…” The slave master looked at Shangguan Rui and laughed.

“Haha, let her to him then,” Shangguan Rui said.

The slave master thanked him repeatedly and hurriedly kept all the weapons that Ye Qingtang threw on the ground.

“Brother, she is yours!” the slave master said to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded and was about to leave with the blue-haired girl.

However, right at that instant, Shangguan Rui suddenly blocked Ye Qingtang’s way with a menacing smile on his face.
