Chapter 1083 Divine King Luo Xue (1)

The old Valley Master did not have any signs of advancing, but why was there a blood-colored Heavenly Tribulation falling from the sky?!

“Haha… Hahahaha!!”

Although there were blood-colored streaks of lightning raining down, the old Valley Master was laughing heartily. With one hand controlling Heaven and Earth and the other controlling the sun and the moon, he received the streaks of lightning like a true god without any trace of fear.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback by the sight. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Who in this world could face the Heavenly Tribulation with smiles? It was most likely only Divine King Luo Xue!

Clank!

A black saber appeared in Divine King Luo Xue’s hand.

“Old friend… It’s been long…”

The old Valley Master looked at the black saber in his hand and chuckled.

Before everyone’s shocked eyes, a clear voice sounded from the black saber. “Divine King Luo Xue… I have been sealed by you for thousands of years… I never thought that you would actually bring me out today…”

“Hahaha. Meeting an old friend again. How great!” The old Valley Master laughed. The smile on his face completely contrasted that of a serious character.

“The Heavenly Tribulation is here. Fight!” The saber shouted.

In the next second, the old Valley Master rushed to the sky, and the saber swept across the blood-colored streaks of lightning.

Boom! Boom!

There was a loud eruption when the black saber faced the Heavenly Tribulation as though the sky was about to explode.

“Regicide Sky Blade?!”

Ye Qingtang stared at the sword in the old Valley Master’s hand, and her pupils dilated slightly.

The longsword in the old Valley Master’s hand was actually the genuine Regicide Sky Blade!

Although Ye Qingtang’s black-grade weapon was also named the Regicide Sky Blade, it was an imitation of the Heaven-level divine weapon, Regicide Sky Blade… The weapon in Divine King Luo Xue’s hand was the true Heaven-level divine weapon… Regicide Sky Blade!

At this instant, Ye Qingtang did not even have time to think. The Regicide Sky Blade smashed the blood-colored streaks of lightning violently, and the might of the Heavenly Tribulation swept throughout the place as though it wanted to extinguish every being in the world.

Very quickly, the first Heavenly Tribulation was broken through. Divine King Luo Xue’s Heaven-level divine weapon pointed to the sky proudly as though it had returned to millions of years ago-an era which it belonged to.

“Old friend…

The clear spirit from the Regicide Sky Blade sounded. “The road that you chose… Isn’t the price a little too huge…”

“Price…”

Divine King Luo Xue was expressionless, and he seemed to be in thought.

After so many years, he had almost forgotten his initial thinking and who he exactly was…

“I don’t wish to become eternal…” Divine King Luo Xue mumbled. “Eternity… is lonely…”

“This road… is too difficult. If you really swallowed her heart back then, would you still need to be afraid of the curse? You could have left this mainland a long time ago… and became a true legend… Yet, you chose the toughest road… After ten thousand years, do you… still love her…” A soft sigh emitted from the Regicide Sky Blade.

However, Divine King Luo Xue did not say anything and responded with silence.

“Initially, she remained in this mainland because of you, but you did not accept her feelings… and persuaded her to leave. It seems that you already knew the awful nature of those people. It’s just a pity that she was unwilling to leave… until when her temple was destroyed and faith was tarnished… You appeared and disguised yourself as those people to split her flesh. You brought her heart away and stored it in your body, bearing her curse of anger… but this ruined your entire life… Was this really worth it?” The Regicide Sky Blade said.
