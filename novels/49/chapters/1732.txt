Chapter 1733: Attack From Both Sides (1)

Ye Qingtang gazed at the sleeping little Heavenly Demon in wonder.

“I feel that this is a good thing. If this little Heavenly Demon thinks you are family, the rest of our journey will be much smoother.” Little White Tiger grinned. The horrors of the mystic realm they had seen so far were just the tip of the iceberg. No one knew for sure just how many more terrifying creatures and dangers awaited them.

But with little Heavenly Demon around, they need not be so afraid.

“Remember those giant ice wolves? They couldn’t even move after seeing this little fellow. Do you know what I mean?” Little White Tiger shot Ye Qingtang a meaningful look.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

Perhaps due to little Heavenly Demon’s presence, they had not encountered any monsters for some time. Ye Qingtang had been so tense for so long that her already-fatigued body was even more weak and frail now.

Anyway, since this little fellow wanted to stick to her, there was no need to think too much about the rest for now. Ye Qingtang leaned against Little White Tiger’s soft fur and soon fell asleep. It was the most peaceful sleep she had enjoyed since stepping onto the Frozen Ice Fields.

Ye Qingtang was sound asleep when sunlight shone across the icy lands. Even so, she could vaguely feel a moist warmth on her fingertips. She slowly opened her eyes and was momentarily taken aback by what she saw.

Little Heavenly Demon had awoken and was happily nestled in her arms, nibbling away at her finger with the space ring. It was also wagging its tail happily. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“...” Ye Qingtang kept silent.

Was the little Heavenly Demon hungry again?

She had taken out food from her space ring in front of the little Heavenly Demon yesterday. That little fellow seemed to have misunderstood something.

Worried that the greedy little Heavenly Demon might accidentally chew off her finger, Ye Qingtang immediately sat up and gently pushed the demon’s head aside.

Little Heavenly Demon looked very unhappy at being pushed aside. Its demonic eyes filled with crystal clear tears as it stroked its own belly sadly while hugging its tail. It gazed piteously at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s heart was instantly engulfed by a strong sense of guilt.

You are a Heavenly Demon. Why are you acting all cute and pitiful?

Aren’t you giving Heavenly Demons a bad name?

Despite all those thoughts, Ye Qingtang still obediently retrieved a large amount of food from her space ring and piled it in front of the little Heavenly Demon.

In a flash, little Heavenly Demon’s eyes sparkled as it flung its own tail aside and dived head first into the sea of food. Its two short paws were hard at work, shoving the food straight into its wide open mouth.

Looking at that behavior, Ye Qingtang really felt like it had a bottomless pit for an appetite.

It must be pointed out that the amount of food it was consuming was several times more than its own size.

As Little Heavenly Demon was happily eating away, Ye Qingtang was already surveying their surroundings. After all, she couldn’t hang around this area forever. She would have to move on if she wanted to leave.

Ye Qingtang tidied up and was prepared to continue her journey.

Little Heavenly Demon noticed Ye Qingtang had climbed onto Little White Tiger’s back again, ready to leave. With another sweep of its paw, it shoved the rest of the food into its mouth. Cheeks bulging with food, it trotted on its two short legs over to Little White Tiger’s side. Without further ado, the little Heavenly Demon then clambered onto Little White Tiger and settled down in Ye Qingtang’s arms.
