Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang’s disappearance was unforeseen, stunning everyone present.

The sinister smile was still frozen on the corner of Du Qiang’s lips, but in the next second, a cold light suddenly flew from behind him!

Du Qiang did not dodge in time. Although he barely avoided being hit in a fatal point, his shoulder was still shot, and blood trickled down from the triangular arrowhead.

“You’ve really eaten a bear’s heart and a leopard’s gall. How dare you talk dirty to me?” Ye Qingtang appeared in everyone’s line of sight once again, but this time, she appeared just a few steps away from Du Qiang.

Du Qiang’s face darkened, immediately taking his sword and pierced towards Ye Qingtang.

“Little thing, don’t disregard my kindness!”

An evil and murderous look flashed across her eyes. As she looked at the oncoming Du Qiang, she suddenly shifted her legs a little. It was a footstep that looked very casual, but the sword that Du Qiang stabbed towards her with all his might simply could not touch Ye Qingtang at all.

“Little thing, just you wait…” Du Qiang turned around to attack, but just when he turned his head, Ye Qingtang actually appeared behind him, and just at that time, her specially-made hidden blade was held right against on his glabella!

In just an instant, everyone stopped whatever they were doing as though time had stopped on the battle site.

A piercing pain came from Du Qiang’s glabella, and he could clearly feel the pain from his torn flesh. However, this time, he did not dare to move anymore.

“Scold! Why are you not scolding anymore?” Ye Qingtang beamed at Du Qiang, whose face started to turn as white as wax. They were clearly eyes that curved in a smile but there was not a trace of a smile in them.

“What… What do you want to do?” Du Qiang broke out in cold sweat. Ye Qingtang’s blade was just on his glabella, and at that point, he simply did not dare to move. At such a close distance, even if he avoided with all his might, his brain would instantly be pierced through as long as she released an arrow!

“What do I want to do?” The smile on Ye Qingtang’s lips deepened. She exerted a little force on the hand with the hidden blade, and blood flowed down furiously from the wound on Du Qiang’s forehead.

Warm blood stained his face, but Du Qiang was no longer as arrogant as before. He could only watch this sinister young girl in fear with a pale face.

“Order your senior and junior brothers to obediently abandon their weapons and scram off to a side. If there’s anyone who disobeys, I will stab through your brain.” Ye Qingtang laughed evilly. She obviously had an alluring face, but with that smile, it crept one out.

“I am a Qinglin Sect disciple. You dare to kill me?” Du Qiang did not agree to Ye Qingtang’s demands immediately. Although the two sects were not on good terms, no one openly killed anyone; otherwise, this matter would be directly brought up to the opposing higher-ups of the two sects.

Ye Qingtang tilted her head slightly and looked at Du Qiang who was acting composed. She leaned forward and whispered in his ears, “If you disobey, none of you will be able to leave the Giant Rock Canyon alive today. If all of you are dead, who would know… who was the one who killed you all?”

The voice with a hint of a smile traveled into Du Qiang’s ears. It was charming and seductive, but it only made Du Qiang feel an utter chill. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Somehow, Du Qiang actually felt that whatever this girl said was true.

She was definitely capable of committing such a massacre.
