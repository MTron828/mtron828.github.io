Chapter 232: Fierce Battle (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The citizens residing nearby Spirit Condensation Mountain Village had always treated Spirit Condensation Mountain Village as their protection. Never would they have thought that there would be bits of Duanyuan Grass mixed in the tea and snacks that the village sent over as part of the Village Master’s birthday celebration.

What the innocent people consumed out of trust was poison that sent them to the netherworld.

The moment they were unconscious, they were doomed to die.

“People said Village Master Wu is kind and compassionate, but unexpectedly… you also have a cruel and evil side to you.” Ye Qingtang scoffed.

Wu Chengze stared at Ye Qingtang. At that instant, he had no other inhibitions anymore as he lifted his chin slightly and scoffed. “Cruel and evil? If not for my Spirit Condensation Mountain Village’s protection, they would have died long ago. I raised them for so many years, and so what if I demanded some returns?”

Wu Chengze did not feel that his actions were cruel at all. He laughed. “Ye Qingtang, you’re very smart. But too bad, no matter how smart you are, there’s no use. Most of your senior brothers are infected with the Blood Plague already. I planted that Blood Plague on those bodies a long time ago. The moment you all stepped into Spirit Condensation Mountain Village, it was destined that you all will be unable to leave.”

The moment Wu Chengze finished his sentence, he suddenly raised a hand, and the group of people behind him drew out their weapons and pointed them straight at Ye Qingtang and the rest.

At this moment, Zhou Xuan truly realized how dangerous the situation he was in.

Spirit Condensation Mountain Village had already laid a trap from the start and planned to use the tragic extermination of the village to lead them over here and offer them to that evil spirit which escaped the suppression!

“Ye Qingtang, why did you not say earlier since you realized it long ago! Do you want to kill us!” Zhou Xuan glared furiously at Ye Qingtang, who clearly detected something strange long before then.

Ye Qingtang looked at Zhou Xuan coldly and sneered in her heart.

Even if she said it, would Zhou Xuan believe her?

“Senior Sister Lin, follow me closely.” Ye Qingtang simply could not be bothered with Zhou Xuan, the good-for-nothing. The only person she wanted to protect was Lin Long!

Lin Long looked at Ye Qingtang, who was fending her from the front, with a complicated expression. She did not think that the situation would be this dangerous and, even more so, did not expect that… Ye Qingtang, who had seen through everything, actually did not flee for her life alone but returned to escape together with her instead.

Clearly…

Ye Qingtang had the chance to leave by herself.

Lin Long took a deep breath and grasped the sword on her waist firmly.

“Thank you, Junior Sister Ye.”

Ye Qingtang’s lips tugged upwards into a smile and did not say anything. With heightened vigilance, she fixed her eyes on Wu Chengze and the rest who blocked the entrance and searched for a slim chance for survival.

And right when a battle was about to ensue, a miserable cry was suddenly heard from the second floor of the pavilion.

Zhou Xuan was alarmed when he heard that sound. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

That was Junior Brother Liu’s voice!

At the same time, a besotted smile broke out on Wu Chengze’s face. He looked at Ye Qingtang and the rest evilly and uttered in almost madness, “Your senior and junior brothers have already become a part of my Master. For the resurrection of my sect, all of you can dream on about leaving this place alive!”

With that said, Wu Chengze led the masses behind him and charged towards Ye Qingtang, Lin Long, and Zhou Xuan.

A huge battle with a great disparity in numbers between the two parties broke out there and then!

In a moment’s time, the entire hall of the pavilion was in chaos. Ye Qingtang drew out the sword on her waist and slashed at the oncoming enemies. Standing back to back, she and Lin Long fought against the army of people which swarmed towards them!
