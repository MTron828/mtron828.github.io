Chapter 1116 A Single Spark Can Start A Prairie Fire (6)

After a day, Ye Qingtang finally understood the basic situation of the You Ancient Clan.

From Ye Qingtang’s survey, the number of people from You Ancient Clan who came to this mainland was not a lot-only about a hundred people. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

However, they brought thousands of battleships over.

For every five battleships, there was one general who was in charge of attacking each sect.

The You Ancient Clan was split into ten teams, and each team had about twenty powerful figures who guarded ten cities respectively. The strongest general’s team conquered a city named Sky Stars City.

Simply put, to completely defeat the You Ancient Clan that came this time, they needed to destroy the ten great main cities of the north.

However, the ten great main cities were not far away from each other; thus, once something happened to a main city, the surrounding cities would immediately provide support.

After understanding all of these, Ye Qingtang could not help but frown.

You Ancient Clan’s attack and defense were perfect. As they possessed unparalleled combat power, they also had a flawless defense, sturdy like an iron plate.

“The city nearest to me is Moonlight City, and it’s already conquered by the You Ancient Clan with about twenty You Ancient Clan figures.” After a long while, Ye Qingtang informed Ling Yan about everything she found out.

“Miss Ye, I understand the general situation already. You can head to Moonlight City now.” Ling Yan chuckled.

“Head to Moonlight City…” Ye Qingtang was surprised by what Ling Yan said. “For what?”

“Start a massacre.” Ling Yan’s devilishly-charming laughter rang from the voice transmission stone.

Moonlight City had at least twenty You Ancient Clan powerful figures, but Ling Yan wanted her to head to Moonlight City and cause trouble for the You Ancient Clan?

“Holy Lady… What feud do you have with this fellow?” Blood Moon Elder stared at the voice transmission stone and could not help but ask.

The You Ancient Clan was an old clan from Central Mainland… With twenty powerful figures from the ancient clan guarding the city, how would Ye Qingtang start a massacre when she headed to Moonlight City? It was more like she would be massacred, wasn’t it?!

Blood Moon Elder had learned from Ye Qingtang of the recent events and even about the extraordinary lady and Divine King Luo Xue. He was extremely clear of the current situation, and even though Ye Qingtang was a Yang Lord, it was impossible for her to confront the You Ancient Clan…

“Don’t you trust me, Miss Ye?” Ling Yan asked softly.

“…” Ye Qingtang was silent.“Miss Ye…”

Before waiting for Ling Yan to speak again, Ye Qingtang said forthrightly, “Trusting you it is.”

Anyway, Ye Qingtang had witnessed Ling Yan’s intelligence for herself. If Ling Yan was set to make her trust him, she had to believe him even if she did not.

Ye Qingtang was completely uninterested in experiencing being tricked by Ling Yan; thus, she might as well agree quickly…

It seemed like he had heard Ye Qingtang’s speechlessness in her tone, and Ling Yan’s chuckle sounded from the voice transmission stone.

The clear chuckle tugged at her heartstrings. Almost instinctively, she kept the voice transmission stone and concealed that chuckle.

In the next second, she brought Blood Moon Elder with her and flew towards Moonlight City. About an hour later, in Moonlight City.

A deafening roar and combat sounds could be heard in a super sect. The Blood Moon Elder inspected the place for a moment and mumbled. “This sect should be Shenchao Sect… It is one of the super sects in the north…”
