Chapter 1016 Flourish (1)

On the third day, Daoist Zijin’s residence was densely covered with spirit energy, and he actually advanced to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven after being stuck at the peak of the Second Heaven realm for over ten years. This drew Bai Kui’s envy.

After Ye Ling and the other elders learned of this, they organized a banquet and invited the Si Family and their Yin Yang Perfected Lords.

Currently, apart from Ye Qingtang, the most powerful figures in Lin Town were Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin. It was not an exaggeration to proclaim them as the defenders of the town. At the same time, Lin Town rose up several levels and was completely different from its initial state.

For this banquet, Ye Qingtang was seated at the host seat, which gave Daoist Zijin face and boosted his ego.

His breakthrough was even celebrated by a Yang Lord. If this incident was spread, his other close friends at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm would simply find it unbelievable and hard to accept.

The next morning, Dan Yifan came to the study on his own to look for Ye Qingtang.

Dan Yifan sustained major injuries, and if he recuperated the normal way, he would require at least half a year’s time to recover, and even his martial realm would be affected.

However, the spirit pill which Ye Qingtang gave the Great Elder was a healing medicine normally for Yin Yang Perfected Lords to use. To treat a Martial Qi Level One cultivator, it was as good as a divine pill. In just a few hours, Dan Yifan was almost fully recovered, and after a few days of recuperation, his body absorbed the medicinal benefits of the spirit pill completely and became much stronger than before.

“Se… Senior…”

Dan Yifan appeared rather timid as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who held an antique book in her hand.

Seeing Dan Yifan, Ye Qingtang chuckled. “Take a seat.”

“Sit?”

Dan Yifan was stunned by Ye Qingtang’s words and shook his head repeatedly. How would he dare to sit down before Ye Qingtang? Was this a joke?! Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Previously, Dan Yifan always thought that Ye Qingtang was merely an outer sect disciple of Xuanling Sect. However, he heard from his grandfather that Ye Qingtang killed Qinglin Sect’s Grand Elder with a hand, wiped out the Long and Duan Family with the flick of a finger, and that she was at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Seventh Heaven.

Initially, Dan Yifan did not believe these words, but over the past few days, he realized that even the Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire and the legendary Daoist Zijin joined the Ye Family as elders and were even extremely deferential to Ye Qingtang…

Aside, Dan Yifan discovered that the current Ye Family could no longer be compared to the previous Ye Family. The new young recruits were more and more frightening: most of them were above Martial Qi Level Three, and one of them was a fourteen-year-old half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord!

If Ye Qingtang was not a Yang Lord as his grandfather had said, it was impossible for the Ye Family to change this much.

“Se… Senior, I’ll not sit… I am here today to thank you… If not for the spirit pill you bestowed, I would probably still be bedridden.” Dan Yifan looked at Ye Qingtang in awe.

“You can just call me Ye Qingtang. Given my age, I cannot be your senior. If you’re really not used to it, just call me Eldest Young Lady like before then.” Ye Qingtang looked at the overcautious Dan Yifan and replied.

“Eldest Young Lady…” Dan Yifan nodded, but shock filled him. It was truly unbelievable how this legendary Yang Lord was rather easy to get along with.
