Chapter 2548: Dragon Emperor Clan (8)

The scene made Ye Qingtang’s heart tremble slightly. She thought that she had come to the end of the world and that this huge black mountain was like a divine pillar that supported the heavens.

“Miss Ye, we’re here.” After a long time, the white-haired elder opened his eyes and said indifferently.

“Senior, is this the headquarters of the Dragon Emperor Clan?” Ye Qingtang asked in surprise. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“That’s right.” The white-haired elder nodded slightly. This mountain was called the Demon Mountain. It was located in the north and was considered the top of the Northern Region. Back when the Evil Deity killed an unparalleled demonic creature, that demonic creature had been suppressed at the foot of the mountain since. Demonic energy shrouded the mountain range, making it the best place for the Dragon Emperor Clan to cultivate.

Ye Qingtang nodded after hearing the white-haired elder’s narration.

While she did not know who the Evil Deity was, from the elder’s expression, he should be one of the Patriarchs of the Dragon Emperor Clan. Just as the white-haired elder said, there was demonic energy surrounding the place. People who cultivated in the evil arts would naturally prefer this kind of demonic aura surrounding them.

The Dragon Emperor Clan was the most powerful evil demonic clan in the entire Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. It was not surprising for their headquarters to be built here.

Although Ye Qingtang’s mother, Di Jiuyuan, was the successor of the Dragon Emperor Clan, Ye Qingtang had never seen her biological parents in both her lives nor had she come to the Dragon Emperor Clan before. It wasn’t surprising that she did not know much about the clan.

A moment later, the white-haired elder looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “Since Miss Ye is here, you should stay for a few days. The Dragon Emperor Clan treats their guests the best in the entire Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.”

Ye Qingtang was speechless. She hadn’t wanted to come here in the first place. Did she have the right to refuse?

Of course, before her identity was made known, Ye Qingtang knew how to behave in front of a behemoth like the Dragon Emperor Clan. The white-haired elder probably would not hurt her since he invited her over.

However, Ye Qingtang had her own worries as well. She could guess why this white-haired elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan brought her here. It must be because she looked similar to her mother, Di Jiuyuan.

However, not only did Ye Qingtang look like her mother, Di Jiuyuan, she also looked identical to that Paragon from the Temple of Paragon.

The reputation of the Temple of Paragon was well-known in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. Their Paragon had always been mysterious and very few people had seen her face. Based on what Ye Qingtang knew, apart from the core higher-ups of the Temple of Paragon, only the Sea King had also seen the Paragon.

However, Ye Qingtang did not know if the Evil Deity of the Dragon Emperor Clan had seen the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon. With the Dragon Emperor Clan’s influence and reputation in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, it would not be surprising if he had seen the Paragon. But then again, the Temple of Paragon and the Dragon Emperor Clan had never been on good terms.

If… the Dragon Emperor Clan discovered that she had the same appearance as that Paragon, who knew what consequences would await her.

However, it was useless for Ye Qingtang to think too much now. It was impossible to escape from the Dragon Emperor Clan given the situation. She could only take things one step at a time and she did not have a good solution for the time being.

After a long time, the avian demon gently flapped its wings and landed on the huge mountain steadily. It seemed that the entire mountain range was the headquarters of the Dragon Emperor Clan..
