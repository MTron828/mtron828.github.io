Chapter 758 So It’s My Fault? (2)

The Admirable Sky Peak disciples at the side finally understood what was going on.

They tried to control their laughter upon hearing Ye Qingtang’s words.

Li Jingwen was too weak?

He was the strongest disciple of the Blue Cloud Peak.

Everyone felt that Ye Qingtang did the right thing when they recalled how Li Jingwen showed off at the Admirable Sky Peak earlier. However, they did not dare to reveal their thoughts on their faces.

Perfected Xuanchen’s sight landed on Ye Qingtang as he noticed how unpleasant the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master’s expression was. His sight was complex.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master was speechless.

What could he say?

Was he going to say that he came here to stand up for his disciple as he was too weak and beaten during practice?

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master’s aggressiveness was all replaced by depression now.

He knew what Ye Qingtang was thinking about. However, the meaning changed in her words.

This…

She was totally unreasonable.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master frowned heavily.

The fight between Ye Qingtang and Li Jingwen had become a practice now. Even if Li Jingwen was heavily injured, as the Peak Master, he should not interfere with disciples’ practice.

Such practices were common in the Falling Sky Valley. No one would drag the elders and the wardens to ask for compensation if he lost.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master could not do anything to Ye Qingtang then.

Perfected Xuanchen stared at the Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master’s changing face and understood the situation. The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master should not have anything to say. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Mind the limits even if it’s a practice in the future,” Perfected Xuanchen said slowly.

“I understand. I will be cautious of the limits. If my opponent is too weak, I will not use my full strength in order to maintain peace,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master’s face clouded upon hearing Perfected Xuanchen and Ye Qingtang’s conversations.

Opponent is too weak?

Is she talking about Li Jingwen?!

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master took a deep breath and suppressed his unpleasantness. If he showed his anger now, he would be making a big fuss over a small issue.

“Valley Master, I still have things going on in the Blue Cloud Peak. I shall leave first,” The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master said with a dark face.

“Okay.” Perfected Xuanchen nodded slightly.

The Blue Cloud Peak Peak Master led his disciples, whose faces were unpleasant away.

Perfected Xuanchen did not say anything since the incident was ended. He glanced at Ye Qingtang with thoughts and left. After Perfected Xuanchen left, the Admirable Sky Peak disciples all surrounded Ye Qingtang and asked.

“Senior Brother Ye, you really beat Li Jingwen?”

Many Admirable Sky Peak disciples were triggered by Ye Qingtang offending the Blue Cloud Peak disciples and causing Li Jingwen to find troubles here. However, Ye Qingtang did not hide and beat him up instead.

Many disciples who had resentment all felt relieved now. Their aversion towards the new Valley Master’s disciple was slightly reduced.

Ye Qingtang did not know where to start as she was surrounded by Admirable Sky Peak disciples and questioned by them.

Yan Shu sighed slowly as Ye Qingtang was slightly accepted by the rest.
