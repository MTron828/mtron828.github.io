Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Before the king-level giant crocodile returned to its senses, the white tiger’s claws waved and crashed on the king-level giant crocodile’s head.

Roar!!

The giant crocodile roared furiously.

“F*ck you. You’re not conceding?” The white tiger’s sharp claws scratched several bloody cuts on the giant crocodile’s head.

Noticing that, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder exchanged a look. When they saw the white tiger, their hearts sank as they thought they were going to be attacked by enemies from both the front and back.

Yet, unexpectedly…

This Fiendcelestial Beast actually ignored both of them and directly jumped at the giant crocodile?!

The so-called Fiendcelestial Beast could not be a fool, could it…

That king-level demonic beast was clearly chasing after the two of them. What had it got to do with the Fiendcelestial beast?! RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

At that moment, the king-level giant crocodile’s head was flowing with blood, and it retreated backward successively in shock. Its malicious eyes had a trace of fear as it looked at the white tiger in front of it.

A Fiendcelestial Beast was the descendant of a Celestial Beast and a Fiend Beast. For a demonic beast with activated spiritual wisdom like the giant crocodile, it held a Fiendcelestial Beast in awe and veneration by instinct.

Naturally, this awe and veneration were built on the basis of their skills. If the Fiendcelestial Beast was at its infancy and had no combat ability, that awe would not exist. If a demonic beast could consume the flesh and blood of a Fiendcelestial Beast, there was a very high possibility that there would be a bloodline change, and this was extremely attractive to demonic beasts.

As Ye Qingtang looked at the enraged Fiendcelestial Beast, a guess formed in her heart.

When this Fiendcelestial Beast was in the outer world, it was probably frequently chased for its life by humans and demonic beasts alike, which resulted in its current persecutory delusional disorder. As long as it saw humans or demonic beasts, it would assume that they were here to kill it.

“You really think that I’m still an infant? Is that why you dare to be so impudent? Trash like you, how dare you think of eating me?” The white tiger got angrier as he spoke. He immediately moved forward and waved its paws, causing that king-level demonic beast to retreat continuously.

Roar!!

The giant crocodile’s evil eyes were locked on the white tiger as it roared angrily. It seemed to be warning the Fiendcelestial Beast.

“You are refusing to accept defeat, aren’t you!”

Then, the white tiger inched closer again and bit the king-level giant crocodile’s neck, causing it to shake its head wildly.

The defense of the giant crocodile was extremely strong, and weapons were unable to penetrate its skin. However, the white tiger’s fiendish teeth pierced into the giant crocodile’s skin in an instant. Blood flowed out of the king-level giant crocodile’s neck, dyeing its black body into a bright red.

The sight stupefied all the people present.

Although one could not tell how strong the king-level demonic beast was, its combat ability was at least that of humans’ Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, and there was even a possibility that it was at half-step of Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

But such a ferocious king-level giant crocodile did not have the slightest ability to retaliate when it encountered the Fiendcelestial Beast.

Roar!!

The king-level giant crocodile thrashed its body around crazily and roared non-stop after being bitten on the neck by the white tiger.

After struggling for a while, the giant crocodile finally escaped from the white tiger’s mouth.

The giant crocodile broke down internally at that instant. Its blessed Grotto-heaven was ruined by two humans, and before it could vent its anger, it met a Fiendcelestial Beast which unknowingly beat it up.

If it continued to be beaten, it did not know how much more torture it had to endure…

After the giant crocodile roared at the white tiger, it finally fled from the scene helplessly.

The Fiendcelestial Beast instinctively wanted to chase after, it but after glancing at the numerous people at the scene, it abandoned the decision to chase after the king-level demonic beast.
