Chapter 1767: This Taste Is To Die For (2)

Fiendish demon flesh was nutritious to their own kind but to a human like Ye Qingtang, it was a great challenge to her taste buds.

Ye Qingtang didn’t know how much demon flesh she had already forced down her own throat. Her stomach was churning and if not for the fear of exposing herself, she would have already vomited everything out.

Little White Tiger could only quietly sympathize with Ye Qingtang as it watched her go green with revulsion as she swallowed down the meat.

Even Little White Tiger would find fiendish demon flesh disgusting and hard to swallow, let alone Ye Qingtang.

“You don’t need to thank me. It’s all for the camp.” The tall, strapping fiendish demon thought that the tears streaming down Ye Qingtang’s face were tears of gratitude.

Lowering her head without a word, Ye Qingtang silently cursed that fiendish demon and all its ancestors. Granted it had good intentions but this was something she would rather not have!

Eight fiendish demon bodies were soon demolished, leaving only bits of broken bones which were given to those salivating little fiendish demons. Their faces were full of bliss and contentment just gnawing on those bones.

The strong smell of blood soon attracted several other eastern fiendish demons over. They were enraged to find out that demons from the other factions had been plotting to attack their main camp.

With her stomach still churning and an increasing number of demons gathering here, Ye Qingtang could feel the chances of her escape gradually narrowing.

“It’s all thanks to the Great Sage’s vigilance. She had us scout out the area again, otherwise we might not have discovered them.” One of the little fiendish demons was full of adoration and praise for Ye Qingtang.

They would not have discovered the situation if Ye Qingtang hadn’t insisted that they scout the area a few more times.

The other adult fiendish demons nodded and looked at Ye Qingtang less scornfully. Nevertheless, they were still inwardly shaking their heads at her weak powers.

Ye Qingtang was feeling very depressed. She finally got the chance to escape but it had been taken away from her. As for her vigilance... it was truly one big misunderstanding.

“It has been rather chaotic around here recently. You all hurry back to the cave. We will not have you do scouting work for the time being,” the fiendish demons instructed. After a discussion amongst themselves, they realized that there had been quite a bit of enemy activity near their camp. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Fiendish demons from an opposing faction had been able to sneak so close to their camp today. Who knew what would happen the next time? They would be sending the little fiendish demons to their death if they continued to make them do scouting work.

The little fiendish demons nodded obediently.

“And you. You can also stay inside the cave unless you are needed.” Several adult fiendish demons didn’t forget today’s ‘great benefactor’.

They were being kind. Although they scorned her for her weak abilities, she had indeed uncovered the enemy’s plot today. As a result, they were kind enough to let her hide in the cave rather than go out and risk her life.

But Ye Qingtang was thunderstruck by their words.

Didn’t this mean she would never get another chance to escape?

Still in a daze, Ye Qingtang and a bunch of fiendish demons returned to the camp. Thereafter, the demons all scurried off to perform the necessary tasks, while Ye Qingtang sat in a corner brooding.

She had been forced to eat so much demon flesh and was now ‘imprisoned’ in the camp. When in the world would she ever be able to leave?

Ye Qingtang was very despondent but she didn’t dare to show it. She just sat at the entrance of the cave, watching the comings and goings of the fiendish demons.
