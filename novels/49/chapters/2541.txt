In that instant, many memories flashed across the elder’s mind. That face was too similar.

Although they were not exactly the same, they were more than 80% similar. If he did not look carefully and had just taken a hasty glance, the white-haired elder might have really treated Ye Qingtang as the person from his memory.

“Alike… really too alike…” After a long while, the elder finally returned to his senses.

Actually, there were many people who looked similar in this world, but for some reason, he could instantly connect this girl to that person at a single glance.

Di Jiuyuan was a super genius of the Dragon Emperor Clan. She was also their Great Evil Deity’s favorite little princess. With her talent, she was bestowed her royal surname by the Great Evil Deity himself. Later on, she had disappeared without a trace.

“Little Jiu…”

The white-haired elder looked at Ye Qingtang’s extremely familiar and nostalgic face and blurted out.

“My Lord, they’re too alike. They’re really too alike. I remember that Princess Jiu was exactly like this back then. How could that girl be so similar to her?!” The middle-aged man exclaimed.

Some years ago, he had violated the rules of the Dragon Emperor Clan. According to the rules, he would have his arm chopped off. The middle-aged man still remembered it vividly. If it weren’t for Princess Jiu protecting him and pleading on his behalf, he would have lost his arm.

Although she was the favorite daughter of the Evil Deity, the middle-aged man’s impression of Princess Jiu was that she did not put on any airs at all. Instead, she was amiable and approachable. She would play with the servants and got along very well with everyone…

Looking at Ye Qingtang, the middle-aged man could not help but be reminded of all those memories from years ago.

“My Lord, look…” Seeing that Ye Qingtang was about to be taken away, the middle-aged man did not know what to do. Although the woman and Princess Jiu did look very similar, they were not the same person. The middle-aged man knew that very well.

...

“Why is there still someone alive?”

At that moment, the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince glanced at the Blood Moon Elder. The old man from the Sky Vault Sect stepped forward, looking like he wanted to get rid of the Blood Moon Elder.

“What are you doing? Have you never heard of me?” Seeing that he was about to die, the Blood Moon Elder suddenly shouted.

The Sky Vault Sect old man’s interest was piqued when he heard that. He stared at the Blood Moon Elder and his lips curled up slightly as he chuckled. “Oh, tell me who you are then.”

“My surname is He. I’m He Hongqing. Haven’t you heard of me?” The Blood Moon Elder asked coldly.

The Sky Vault Sect old man and the First Prince looked at each other.

He Hongqing?

However, in an instant, the old man from the Sky Vault Sect laughed. “What? You’re He Hongqing, that person under the Heavenly Emperor?”

“Yes,” the Blood Moon Elder confirmed. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He was not lying. He was indeed He Hongqing, even though he was just a clone…

Actually, the Blood Moon Elder did not know his own name. It was just that he possessed some memories in which he was called He Hongqing. It turned out that his main body’s name was He Hongqing.

“Ha, alright. In that case, I’ll kill you today and you can get the Heavenly Emperor to seek out our Sky Vault Sect for an explanation.” The old man from the Sky Vault Sect chuckled.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang glanced at the Blood Moon Elder and sighed quietly. Who would believe him in his current state?

Even Ye Qingtang herself would not have believed him.
