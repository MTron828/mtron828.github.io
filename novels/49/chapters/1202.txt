“You…”

The middle-aged man wanted to say something, but the Blood Moon Elder put all his force in his hand.

In a second, the middle-aged man’s body exploded in the Blood Moon Elder’s hand and was crushed into pieces.

Boom!

Puff… puff… puff…

Eventually, the Blood Moon Elder’s left arm fell weakly as he panted heavily.

“Holy… Holy Lady… I… Hong He… qing… succeeded in carrying out your order… and completed… completed… my mi… mission!” The Blood Moon Elder looked up at the sky and shouted.

Two streaks of tears flowed down Blood Moon Elder’s cheeks.

Very swiftly, the Blood Moon Elder struggled to stand up, but the current him did not have any energy left, and he was unable to walk after losing a leg.

“I… Hong… Heqing… am not any… anyone’s… split self…” Blood Moon Elder mumbled.

Many scenes played in the Blood Moon Elder’s head in a moment.

Back when he and Ye Qingtang first met, he had no other choice and was forced to sign a Heavenly Dao contract with her…

The days that followed were joyous and carefree…

In Xuanling Sect, he became an ordinary disciple and was bullied and oppressed by Ye Qingtang every day.

Afterward, the two of them were through thick and thin together…

The sudden change in Xuanling Sect, heading to the Blood Moon Sect together, putting up an act.

In the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm, they stuck through the dangers together and never abandoned one another…

In the war, they trusted each other fully without any suspicions.

Thinking about it carefully, in his entire life, he only had that one friend—that one precious friend…

“Sorry… My friend…” The Blood Moon Elder chuckled softly.

At this instant, Ye Qingtang from afar felt her heart tremble slightly after killing several Ancient You Clan figures.

Ye Qingtang clearly felt that her contract with the Blood Moon Elder suddenly disappeared at that very moment.

An inauspicious feeling filled her rapidly…

Immediately, Ye Qingtang turned into a shadow and flew towards the location she last sensed him at.

Ye Qingtang found the Blood Moon Elder very quickly.

However, upon seeing Blood Moon Elder, Ye Qingtang could not show any expression. Her eyes widened slightly in astonishment.

“Holy… Holy Lady… why… are you… here…” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and chuckled softly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Don’t talk…” Ye Qingtang shuttled to Blood Moon Elder’s side with great strides.

“Ha… Haha… Holy Lady… I… I completed… your mission… The kids… are safe!” The Blood Moon Elder laughed loudly.

“Don’t… say anything…” Ye Qingtang clenched her fists tightly. Unknowingly, her fingernails dug into her palm, and blood dripped down freely.

“I… can’t say anything… in the future anyway…” The Blood Moon Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “Thank… Thank you… my… friend… Please… live on!”

Along with his final cry, his huge body gradually turned into nothing and vanished completely.

“Heaven City’s General is here. Kill her!”

Some Ancient You Clan people rushed over and shouted loudly as they looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Get lost!”

In a flash, monstrous black flames burned around Ye Qingtang, and the flames shot out in all directions.

In a few breaths’ time, the dozens of people who chased over were completely devoured by the black flames.

Without looking back, Ye Qingtang gazed at the spot where the Blood Moon Elder disappeared and picked up a black wine gourd, which was the only thing the Blood Moon Elder left behind.
