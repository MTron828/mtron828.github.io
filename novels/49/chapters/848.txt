Chapter 849 Destined To Be Single

A while later, Ye Qingtang walked several hundred meters and arrived right beneath the Glazed Cup.

Ye Qingtang leaped and took the Glazed Cup easily.

The moment the Glazed Cup was in her hands, intense spirit energy enveloped Ye Qingtang entirely, which gave her the impulse of advancing to the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm…

The Glazed Cup was classified as an extremely precious treasure that could collect spirit energy. Leaving this mainland aside, it was also very rare in the Central Mainland. If it was placed in an auction in the Central Mainland, it could be auctioned off at a sky-high price.

Delight emerged in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at the Glazed Cup in her hands.

Regardless of Beiming Manor, Peerless School, or Phantom Valley, the current her was too weak compared to them and all the more could not be mentioned on equal terms with the powerful figures from the Central Mainland.

Only by increasing her own martial cultivation realm could she reduce the gap.

Nevertheless, Ye Qingtang knew that there was not much time left for her. The Xuanling Sect masses were not yet rescued; the crisis of extermination which Master Perfected Xuanchen and Falling Sky Valley would face was not yet resolved; sometime later, that ancient family clan from the Central Mainland would come to collect the extraordinary lady’s Spiritual Abode and completely destroy this mainland.

By then, everyone would be killed…

Yet, with the skills of only a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord currently, what could she do?!

Presently, Ye Qingtang had an inexplicable, urgent desire for power.

This desire for power was not for herself.

Ye Qingtang did not wish to be a so-called world savior; what she wanted and needed to do was to protect the lives of her family and friends, as well as ensure that they were safe as sound.

Swoosh!

Suddenly, a piercing sound was heard.

With brows deeply furrowed, Ye Qingtang looked behind her only to see an aloof-looking youth walking towards her with great strides.

“You are a citizen of this mainland,” said Yin Yang Child coldly after sizing up Ye Qingtang casually.

Yin Yang Child’s sudden appearance caught Ye Qingtang off guard.

Nonetheless, Yin Yang Child had already discovered her, and Ye Qingtang could only face him. After all, she had no grudges with Yin Yang Child.

“Yes, I am.” Ye Qingtang admitted straightforwardly.

“Very good.” Yin Yang Child stretched his hand out and said. “Hand me the item in your hands, and you can leave.”

“I found this item first, and it is already in my hands. Why must I hand it to you?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Why?” Yin Yang Child took a few more looks at Ye Qingtang. “You are pretty courageous. Since you wish to know why, I can tell you too. The reason is very simple: I can kill you easily.”

“So, because you are more powerful than me, I must offer you my things to you without complaints when you’re snatching it from me?” Ye Qingtang questioned in a cold tone. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Oh… Do all of the people from this mainland have such an unyielding character like you?” There were no emotions on Yin Yang Child’s face as he added on. “You can stay by your unyielding character and die—that is the first route. The second route is to hand the Glazed Cup to me. Although you would lose your backbone, you still can live.”

Ye Qingtang did not reply anything at this instant and was calculating how likely it was for her to survive when she battled with Yin Yang Child. If it was truly impossible, she needed to think of an escape plan.

However, before Ye Qingtang could think further, a laugh sounded from ahead. “Yin Yang Child, if you bully such a beautiful older sister like that, I’m afraid no ladies will ever like you given your character.”
