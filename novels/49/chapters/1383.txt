everyone was stunned when they saw what just happened. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“what… what the hell was that…” emperor qi stared at the flame on the ashes in shock. there was no more arrogance in his eyes.

how could such a burst of flame appear on her hand all of a sudden? and the flames spread when it touched people. people can’t even react to how quickly the flames spread!

the hundreds of powerful people just burned into ash?

they would never believe what had just happened if they did not witness that with their own eyes.

ye qingtang glanced at the ash on the ground. she then pushed herself above the ground and floated in the midair.

“flying in midair?” the believers’ faces were full of astonishment when they saw that.

ye qingtang bent her finger, and the flame that was burning on the ashes suddenly flew back to ye qingtang. the flames concentrated into a black fire phoenix.

the phoenix’s entire body was burning with fire. it extended its wings and stood beside ye qingtang. ye qingtang gently touched its head, but her white fingers were not hurt from the fire at all.

all the believers were shocked when they saw that.

they thought that ye qingtang was just another quack, but…

everything she just did served as a slap to their faces.

they witnessed how the flames burned a few hundred powerful people into ashes but also how kind ye qingtang appeared to be. they were almost trembling in fear.

uh…

the young lady here is really an immortal?!

no one dared to say anything else at that moment.

besides an immortal, who else could fly in the air or manipulate those terrifying flames?

“who else wants to challenge me?” ye qingtang floated in midair and glanced at everyone below coldly. though it was just a quick glance, everyone could feel the pressure of a thousand kilograms of weighing on them. they could not even breathe properly.

“please forgive our ignorance. we should have never offended an immortal. we are willing to accept any punishment!!” emperor qi kneeled down below ye qingtang immediately. his body was full of sweat, and there was no more arrogance seen on him.

the rest of the believers all kneeled down in fear.

how could they dare to challenge the dignity of an immortal?

they really wanted to slap themselves when they remembered how rude they were towards ye qingtang.

after witnessing ye qingtang’s immortal skills, the emperor of the yuan kingdom, who was terrified, finally sighed in relief. his anger was vented when he saw emperor qi and the rest kneeling on the ground in fear.

“emperor qi, i remembered that you were so sure that immortal su was a quack?” the emperor of the yuan kingdom scoffed.

emperor qi’s face was pale. he apologized immediately. “no no, i was foolish and ignorant. i could not recognize an immortal. how could you be a quack? i was too foolish… please forgive me, immortal…”

though emperor qi and the rest were believers of the dragon court sect, they knew how large of a gap there was between them and a real immortal.

even if there were believers, the dragon court sect would not defend them when they provoked ye qingtang, who was an immortal.
