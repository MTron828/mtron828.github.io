Chapter 113: Seven Stars on Moon (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Even Elder Lin’s eyes were full of shock.

As an elder from the Sword Faction, no one other than him knew more clearly of the force of the sword array. Although the sword array was only at the starting stage, it was already extremely fierce. He initially thought that Ye Qingtang would lose her life in the first wave of attacks, however…

Things were completely beyond his expectations.

“That is… the Seven Stars on Moon footstep?” An elder from the Fist Faction sharply noticed Ye Qingtang’s rapidly moving footsteps.

Her pair of legs were unusually nimble, and although its movements appeared messy, it actually followed a pattern.

“Seven Stars on Moon footstep? Isn’t that one of the must-learns from that person?” Elder Qin asked in surprise.

The Fist Faction elder frowned slightly and took a closer look.

“It seems like it, but it’s a little different. I saw fragments of the Seven Stars on Moon footstep scroll by chance only once and cannot verify it. Moreover, that Lord had already disappeared for a long time. Since that big battle, it is unknown whether he is still alive or not…”

“Now is not the time to consider these. The first wave of attack is ending soon. If the sword array still cannot be shut down, the second wave of attack in the absolute-kill sword array will directly shoot out millions of lightsabers. Even the Eight Trigrams Stage would be destroyed, much less Ye Qingtang.” Elder Qin took a deep breath and turned to look at Elder Lin beside him.

Elder Lin frowned deeply. Instantly, he turned around and headed outside.

On the Eight Trigrams Stage, Ye Qingtang’s alertness was raised to the extreme. As her quickly-turning wrists held on the sword to hit the flying lightsabers continuously, it was already numbed by the force of the impact.

At this instant, Ye Qingtang really could not laugh at all.

The sword array that she initially thought she could pass easily actually changed suddenly.

This change shocked Ye Qingtang extremely, and she could only use the footstep that she used to save her life in her previous life.

Ye Qingtang obtained this set of footsteps coincidentally in her previous life. Initially, she did not think that there was anything special about it, but after practicing and mastering it, she found out its secret. It could be said that this set of footsteps helped her escape in the many times she was surrounded by enemies in her previous life.

She had no intention of using it in the assessment, but now, she had to use it even if she did not want to.

As Ye Qingtang cautiously countered the attack of the lightsabers, her mind was constantly thinking about the sudden change in the sword array.

In her previous life when she entered Xuanling Sect, she had entered the sword array as well. Nothing abnormal happened to it then, and she had never heard of any accidents in the sword array assessment in the previous years before.

How…

Did everything detract from history’s track? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Could it be…

A shocking thought suddenly appeared in Ye Qingtang’s mind.

In her previous life, she had never used the power of the Heart of the Demon God; thus, there was nothing to worry about. However, now… the spirit root in her body was formed using the Heart of the Demon God.

Even if Ye Qingtang could hide the Heart of the Demon God and not let anyone else discover it, the sword array only sensed one’s aura and would not be misled by any other thing.

Could it be…

That the sword array suddenly became this violent because it sensed the Heart of the Demon God in her body?

At the thought, Ye Qingtang could not help but break out in a cold sweat.

Despite all her calculations, she missed out on the sensory ability of the sword in the stone!

It was really too careless!

Ye Qingtang was quietly vexed over her carelessness, but her limbs did not dare to relax a little. If she was slightly careless and got stabbed by the lightsaber, she might be buried here!
