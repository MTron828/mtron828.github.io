“Junior Sister Ye, is this a snack you prepared for this wolf?” Qin Huan said and pointed to that bloody cloth bag.

Ye Qingtang looked down and burst out laughing.

“No, this is Wu Qi’s head.”

“…” Everyone’s jaw dropped to the ground.

“Wu Qi? You’re not talking about that Wu Qi… on the Assassination Roll… right?” Qin Huan’s lips twitched and felt that this news was even more explosive than the wolf.

Ye Qingtang nodded obediently.

Gasps instantly filled the air.

The nine of them widened their eyes as they looked at the beautiful girl with a scared expression as though they were looking at a monster!

They were more or less aware of Wu Qi’s abilities. Although he was not the strongest, he was not someone that could be independently killed by an outer sect disciple like them.

In the end…

Not only did Ye Qingtang picked up a silver wolf, she even easily chopped off Wu Qi’s head?

Everyone’s feelings were extremely complicated for a moment. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Looking at everyone’s expression, Ye Qingtang realized that they might have misunderstood.

“I met him on the way, but he had some accident and already was dead, so I conveniently cut his head off.” It was unwise for Ye Qingtang to mention the Aura of the Evil. After all, the Aura of the Evil was too powerful. The less trouble, the better.

Hearing Ye Qingtang’s words, everyone slowly let out a sigh of relief.

A natural disaster hit this Giant Rock Canyon today, and it could be that Ye Qingtang had the opportunity to cut his Wu Qi’s head off because he encountered a high-level demonic beast that was escaping.

Although she did not kill him independently, there was really nothing to say about her luck…

“Ahem… We will look for a carriage first,” Gu Yanqiu cleared his throat and said. Then, he and Meng Sheng rode the horses that they left outside the canyon previously and headed nearby to look for a carriage.

On the other hand, Ye Qingtang and the rest rested outside the canyon.

Ye Qingtang sat on a large rock and looked at the silver wolf, which was still in a deep sleep in her arms. She could not help but worry whether the wolf was injured in other areas; thus, she carefully held the wolf’s paw and checked carefully. After inspecting, she did not find any other wounds and finally sighed in relief. However…

“It is so nice to touch…” Ye Qingtang became addicted to touching it. Her tiny hands caressed the wolf all over as though they were stuck onto the wolf’s body, and she looked extremely blissful.

This fur was more comfortable than any of the wolves she touched before!

The certain Demon God who pretended to faint was completely frozen because someone continuously took advantage of him.

Mu Su had chased up since a long time ago, but when he saw that Ye Qingtang met up with a group of Xuanling Sect disciples, it was inconvenient for him to appear. He could only quietly look at His Highness being carelessly touched all over in Ye Qingtang’s arms from a distance away.

He felt very complicated.

Extremely, extremely complicated.

Mu Su pondered if he should find a chance to “save” His Highness, but thinking from another angle, it was even more suitable for His Highness to remain beside Ye Qingtang given his current condition. After all, the Heart of the Demon God within Ye Qingtang was the key to controlling the Aura of the Evil. If His Highness could be near the Heart of the Demon God, the uncontrolled Aura of the Evil in his body would be eased.

At that thought, Mu Su quietly kept his leg back.

The moment Mu Su thought of His Highness’s unbearable technique in picking up girls, he instantly felt that letting his highness follow Ye Qingtang in this form was good as well.

Your Highness, you must make use of this opportunity and get along well with Lady Ye!

I can only help you up to here!
