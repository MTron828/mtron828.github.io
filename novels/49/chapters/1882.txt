Long Yao and Long Xiao had called her mother Aunt Jiu, which meant that they were probably related by blood.

But Ye Qingtang was in no hurry to reveal herself to Long Yao and the rest. After all, even though they were in the same clan, she had not completely figured out the circumstances behind her mother’s escape from the Second Domain yet.

Ye Qingtang had seen people of the same clan kill each other before, so it was better to be careful.

Why had her mother not returned if the Dragon Emperor Clan was truly safe?

There was no way she was going to expose herself to danger before figuring out as much as she could.

Her mind was still preoccupied with all these thoughts when a sudden loud noise shook the ground above them.

“What happened? It’s the middle of the night. Are the monsters above not done?” Little White Tiger was a little surprised.

Ye Qingtang looked at Fu Qiu, who looked confused as well. It walked up the Crystal Palace with Ye Qingtang and a white tiger following behind it.

There was a group of threatening men standing outside the Crystal Palace, smashing at the entrance repeatedly.

A man and a woman led the crowd. The woman was tall and slender, her long dress outlining her figure slightly. But her face was so cold no one would even dare approach her.

“Jiangran, you’re sure that Long Xiao and the rest are here?” The woman spoke slowly as she lifted her chin to look at the fifteen-year-old boy standing beside her.

The young man was as pale as white jade and was very good looking. He had a pair of shapely eyes which made him look as though he was constantly smiling, making people want to get close to him.

In response, he lifted his hands, showing a palm-sized poisonous spider on top. He looked at the reaction of the spider and nodded.

“Senior Sister, Long Xiao and the rest have our poison on them. There’s no way my spider would be mistaken about their whereabouts. They must be inside the Crystal Palace, and have probably been hiding here for a day or two as my spider can feel that the black mist inside is thick.”

“Hmph...” the woman scoffed coldly as she narrowed her eyes and stared at the entrance of the Crystal Palace with her arms crossed.”Since we’re already here, I want you to blast this Crystal Palace open. Let’s see how long they think they can hide for.”

Under the command of the woman, the black-clad men behind her rushed towards the Crystal Palace entrance and started smashing at it. Shards of crystal fell from the entrance with every attack.

Looking at the malicious people in front of them, Ye Qingtang and Fu Qiu could not help but think about the impending attack on Long Xiao and the others. The people outside were likely the ones who had injured Long Xiao and his guards so badly.

The Ten Thousand Poison Valley...

As the commotion outside grew louder and louder, Baili Xi and the others who had been sleeping in their rooms all walked out to take a look. They froze when they saw the people outside smashing at the Crystal Palace. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Long Yao and Long Xiao walked over and their faces were dark when they saw the people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley outside.

“They sure were fast,” Long Xiao said with narrowed eyes. His gaze fell on the poisonous spider on the young man’s palms.

“Liu Jiangran, you’re not bad after all...”

Long Xiao had estimated that the Ten Thousand Poison Valley would need a few days before finding them and had not expected them to be here so fast.

“Elder brother, we have to fight with all our might!” Long Yao seethed with anger. It was these people who had injured her brother!

“We can’t.” Long Xiao only shook his head.
