Chapter 1676: A Tooth For A Tooth (2)

Jiang Yisheng gaped. “Shaobai, that was Jiang Yiran deliberately giving her a chance. The two incidents are not comparable. I...”

“Shut up and watch.” Jiang Shaobai frowned at the ruckus he was making.

In the arena, Mu Ruxue had drawn her sword. The blade glittered coldly under the rays of the sun and ripples of spirit energy coursed through her. The spirit energy around her transformed into a glistening wave of light, like stars scattered around her.

“What’s going on? Mu Ruxue is actually using the Mu family’s Whirling Stars move?”

“Am I seeing things, or is Mu Ruxue crazy? She’s using the Whirling Stars move on that little girl from the Jiang family?”

“How has that Ye Qingtang offended Mu Ruxue? Why is Mu Ruxue using this move on her?”

The group of youths who were watching went berserk.

The Whirling Stars move was a sword technique unique to the Mu family. It was infinitely powerful. The moment it came into play, it would enclose everything within a given area. All the spirit energy could be transformed into sharp blades and an opponent in the vicinity of the Whirling Stars would be flayed, until only bare bones remained!

This was the Mu family’s most vicious move, although not its most powerful one.

Even Elder Qian, who was on the elevated platform, could not help but widen his eyes.

What was going on?

Could there be some enmity between Mu Ruxue and Ye Qingtang? Otherwise, why would Mu Ruxue use such a vicious move on Ye Qingtang?

Elder Qian had wanted Ye Qingtang to gain more experience, but now he could not help but feel worried. With Ye Qingtang’s abilities, she certainly could not survive Mu Ruxue’s Whirling Stars move. She would be killed!

In the arena, Mu Ruxue was feeling smug. If she had not wanted to utterly crush Ye Qingtang, she would not even bother to use a move like the Whirling Stars. Mu Ruxue felt that Ye Qingtang’s abilities were such that the latter could not even withstand a single stroke of her sword.

Tsch. What a bore. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Ye Qingtang, you should thank me for allowing you to enjoy such a nice view before you die. But how can someone as ugly as you bear the sight of such a beautiful move?” Mu Ruxue’s smile was filled with condescension.

As Ye Qingtang looked at the spirit energy that was slowly gathering and approaching her, her mind was filled with the image of Jiang Yiran’s bloody figure.

That idiot...

“The mid-stage of the Third Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm?” Ye Qingtang glanced at the cold gleam amidst the spirit energy.

“Afraid? A pity that it’s too late. You should have realized the disparity between us earlier and just kowtowed and admitted that you were at fault, or admitted defeat. Too bad that now... I won’t give you a second chance,” Mu Ruxue jeered.

But Ye Qingtang only calmly looked away.

“Empty vessels make a lot of noise.”

Ye Qingtang’s soft words took Mu Ruxue by surprise.

The next moment, Ye Qingtang’s figure simply vanished. Her speed shocked Mu Ruxue.

W-What was going on?

Where had Ye Qingtang gone?

While Mu Ruxue was in a state of shock, Ye Qingtang suddenly appeared behind her.

Mu Ruxue felt a cold blast attacking her from behind. She instinctively turned to see that Ye Qingtang had lifted her foot to viciously stamp on the beautiful face that she was so proud of!

One kick from Ye Qingtang sent Mu Ruxue flying forward with a crash. But she had flown less than a meter before Ye Qingtang reached out and grabbed her by her long hair, hauling her back.

“Ahhh!!!”

Mu Ruxue screamed piteously as her scalp was almost ripped apart. Ye Qingtang showed no signs of pity and only twisted around to stamp on Mu Ruxue’s stomach again!
