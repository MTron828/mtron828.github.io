This kick directly kicked everyone out of their senses.

Sheng Qianyu was shocked to see a pretty young man standing before him.

The Blue Cloud Peak disciple who was flung away rose hastily and glared at Ye Qingtang, who was defending Sheng Qianyu behind her.

No one expected Ye Qingtang to strike suddenly, and even Yan Shu, who was standing beside her before this, was stunned.

When did she attack?

Why did he not feel a thing?

“Who are you!” The Blue Cloud Peak disciples immediately glared at the pretty young man who appeared from nowhere when they saw their fellow disciple being beaten up.

A sneer hung on Ye Qingtang’s lips as she looked at the violent Blue Cloud Peak disciples, not bothering to respond to them. She immediately stretched her hand out and picked up the white sage that the Blue Cloud Peak disciple dropped on the floor.

“A while ago, you all said that the White Sage belongs to whoever has his hands on it. Now… it’s in my hands, and it belongs to me already.”

“Damn brat! You have a death wish!” The Blue Cloud Peak disciples’ expressions darkened, and they immediately charged towards Ye Qingtang.

A trace of coldness flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Raising a leg, her elegant frame sent a flying kick at those Blue Cloud Peak disciples who pounced on her!

Those disciples could not even see Ye Qingtang’s actions clearly and were directly sent flying away after being kicked on their heads by Ye Qingtang.

In just the blink of an eye, those Blue Cloud Peak disciples crashed on the ground heavily.

In the entire process, Ye Qingtang was as fast as lightning, and even the surrounding disciples did not react in time.

Yin Qingluo’s eyes were filled with astonishment as she looked at Ye Qingtang, who suddenly attacked.

In reality, the skills of those Blue Cloud Peak disciples were not considered high, and she could easily defeat them as well if she attacked.

However…

She did not dare to attack because of her Master.

Even if she was infuriated, she could only endure it.

Yet, unexpectedly…

This young man who just became her Master’s disciple would actually be so decisive and did what she did not have the courage to do.

Yan Shu was taken aback as well. He looked at Ye Qingtang in surprised, and the despise he held for her in his eyes reduced.

“Your White Sage.” Ye Qingtang stuffed the White Sage to the dazed Sheng Qianyu without hesitation.

Sheng Qianyu looked down at the White Sage in his hands that he regained and then looked at Ye Qingtang, who stood before him agitatedly.

“Thank you. Thank you.”

The White Sage was extremely important to him, and he could not lose it.

Ye Qingtang chuckled. The Blue Cloud Peak disciples behind her had already crawled up from the ground.

“Brat, who exactly are you? Report your name if you have the guts!” The Blue Cloud Peak disciples suffered. Even though they did not wish to admit it, this fellow was too fast, and they could not even see it clearly.

However, this fellow looked very foreign, and they did not know which peak this fellow was a disciple from.

Looking at him, it did not seem like he was in the valley as a guest. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Ye Chen, disciple of Perfected Xuanchen.” Ye Qingtang looked at those Blue Cloud Peak disciples coldly.

“You’re Perfected Xuanchen’s disciple?” Those Blue Cloud Peak disciples were evidently taken aback. They recognized all of Perfected Xuanchen’s disciples but had never seen this fellow before.
