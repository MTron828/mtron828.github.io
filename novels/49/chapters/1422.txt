In just an instant, it enveloped Ye Qingtang completely while Elder Xu’s scarlet glow was instantly devoured by the powers of the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.

“This is…” Elder Xu was astonished when he saw the energy that enveloped Ye Qingtang, and he retracted all his powers hurriedly in the next second.

The moment Elder Xu retracted his powers, Ye Qingtang was thrown off and crashed to the ground. Her entire body felt crushed as an excruciating pain spread throughout her body.

Elder Xu’s eyes were filled with surprise as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who laid on the ground panting. He suddenly landed on the ground, flew to Ye Qingtang’s side, and reached his hand out toward Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s brows were locked together as she lifted her sword shakily, wanting to continue the desperate fight.

Elder Xu saw that Ye Qingtang still wanted to attack and hurriedly stop in his tracks. The murderous expression on his face completely turned into worry and nervousness.

“I will not touch you. Your injuries are too serious. Do not be rash.”

There was immense nervousness in his tone.

Ye Qingtang’s head buzzed. Despite the sudden change in Elder Xu’s attitude, she did not let her guard down at all.

Elder Xu noticed that Ye Qingtang was guarded against him and immediately retreated. He took out a few bottles of supreme-grade elixirs from his space ring and tossed it to Ye Qingtang.

“Your injuries are too serious. Hurry, consume these elixirs to calm your body down.”

“Didn’t you… want to kill me?” Ye Qingtang frowned at Elder Xu who had a strange attitude.

Elder Xu’s brows furrowed slightly, seeming to be very worried about Ye Qingtang’s injuries. “I’m not killing you anymore. Little girl, this is all a misunderstanding. The Heavenly Demon Bloodline… that appeared on your body is unique to the Jiang Family. Who exactly are you? Why do you have the Heavenly Demon Bloodline? Who are your parents?”

The current Elder Xu had lost all his prior coolness in killing her, and his eyes were filled with worry like a compassionate elderly.

Just a while ago, he discovered that this girl actually possessed the Heavenly Demon Bloodline.

In this entire world, apart from the Heavenly Demon, only members of the Jiang Family had this bloodline. This girl must be a descendant of the Jiang Family that was stranded outside.

From whom of the Jiang Family did this girl inherit the bloodline was the question.

Ye Qingtang was slightly dumbfounded when she heard what Elder Xu said.

She was too nervous just now and forgot about this.

The Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her was from that lady at the exit of the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. That lady originally wanted to seize Ye Qingtang’s inheritance of the Divine Phoenix but had her Heavenly Demon Bloodline seized by Ye Qingtang instead.

However, Elder Xu did not know all of this.

All he knew was that anyone with the Heavenly Demon Bloodline was definitely a descendant of the Jiang Family, and moreover, this girl’s Heavenly Demon Bloodline was the rare variant—the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline!

It had been thousands of years since a Heavenly Demon Bloodline variant appeared in the Jiang Family.

Thousands of years ago, the Jiang Family once produced a talent who possessed the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline. He was extremely gifted and exceeded almost everyone. In a short span of time, he dashed out of the First Domain and burst into the Second Domain. It was rumored that he eventually entered the Third Domain and even the legendary Fourth Domain or perhaps even became an immortal.

If that talent was still present, how would the Jiang Family be the top force of only the Central Mainland?
