Chapter 1615: Monster (3)

They had allowed Ye Qingtang to fight because they wanted to embarrass her and hoped she would die on the battlefield.

But now...

As they looked at the allied forces that were reduced to a pile of ashes, all they could think of was how they could quickly think of a way to mend their relationship with Ye Qingtang. Otherwise... they might also become a heap of ashes.

It was not just Joseph and the other Kingdom Knights who were thinking like that. Even the other Supreme League Kingdom soldiers who stood on the city wall to watch the battle were now in inward turmoil.

When they saw the five-hundred-thousand-strong allied troops, they were prepared to defend the fortress to the death.

But no one expected that the allied forces would be completely exterminated without them even touching the fortress wall.

As they looked at Ye Qingtang’s figure, the morale of all the soldiers in the Supreme League Kingdom rose.

She was so powerful, and she came from their country and was a Kingdom Knight!

An unprecedented sense of security arose in their hearts.

At the same time, a door at the other end of the fortress slowly opened. Tens of thousands of Supreme League Kingdom reinforcements had marched through the night to get to the fortress. The commander-in-chief immediately brought them to see the king.

“Your Majesty!” The commander of the reinforcements bowed to the King.

When the King saw the commander of the reinforcements, his eyes flickered. A hint of a smile appeared in his eyes, which had been looking grim for a long time.

“You’re just in time. The five hundred thousand soldiers of the allied forces are outside the fortress. I have already sent men to buy you some time. You must immediately prepare for battle.”

The King had felt anxious when he sent Ye Qingtang out to fight and buy time. He was worried that Ye Qingtang would die in battle before she had bought enough time and that the Supreme League Kingdom’s fortress would face a devastating blow before the reinforcements arrived.

But now, there still was no news from the front that Ye Qingtang had lost the battle. This pleased the King.

Although he knew that Ye Qingtang and her group were doomed to die in this battle, as long as they could cause sufficient delay and buy the reinforcements enough time, then they would have accomplished their mission perfectly.

Of course, if they survived until the reinforcements joined them, the reinforcements might still be able to save some of them.

If possible, the King did not wish to sacrifice his troops like that. However, the circumstances forced his hand.

“I will go and make preparations. What is the situation at the front? I need to know so I can better prepare for the battle,” the commander of the reinforcements said.

The King nodded and summoned a soldier to question him about the fighting at the front.

“Your Majesty, Knight Tang has achieved a complete victory. She is about to lead her troops back to the fortress.” The soldier who arrived with the news looked delighted. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“What?” The King, who was about to re-organize his troops and strike back at the allied forces, was stunned.

“Knight Tang achieved a complete victory? What do you mean by that?”

“Knight Tang won. She defeated the allied forces!” The soldier said.

“...” For the first time, the King felt as if he did not understand what he heard.

The commander of the reinforcements was also bewildered. When he received the news, he knew that the Kingdom Fortress was in a precarious situation, which was why he had mustered his troops and hurried here as soon as possible.

One must know that with the Kingdom Fortress’s current military strength, they could not possibly hold out against the five hundred thousand soldiers of the allied forces.

But now they had won?

Was there some mistake in the dispatches?

The King and the commander of the reinforcements were somewhat puzzled. They emerged from the hall and walked towards the fortress entrance.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang led her troop of ten thousand soldiers back into the city.
