Chapter 716: The Silver Wolf (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

After hearing the little white tiger’s words, cold glints flashed in the silver wolf’s eyes. Its intense aura seemed to be able to enclose the entire world. Everything would tremble in fear under the aura.

However, the little white tiger was calm and did not seem to be affected at all.

“You are the Demon God, the supreme one in the demons. However, you evolved from demonic beasts. As for Fiendcelestial Beasts, we are the Paragon in the demonic beasts. My father was the Emperor of the Fiendcelestial Beast. There were four Paragon Fiendcelestial Beast: Primordial Divine Dragon, Savage Rosefinch, Nine Heaven Tortoise, and the Celestial White Tiger… My father, as the Celestial White Tiger, had conquered the celestial world with the Ancient Emperor and the Saint. I was born in the celestial world and came into the human world incidentally… My bloodline is purer. I’m the Paragon Fiendcelestial Beast which surpasses the bloodline of a normal Celestial White Tiger… Your threatening does not work on me.” The little white tiger stared at the silver wolf and said.

“However, you are the most outstanding Demon God in the human world when compared to the previous Demon Gods. As a Demon God, if you want to leave the human world and enter the Celestial world, you need to go through 81 calamities. I think the most you have gone through is around 70 calamities…”

However, before the little white tiger could finish its words, the silver wolf smashed the little white tiger with its paw.

The little white tiger shouted angrily. “F*ck you! How dare you to bully me just because I’m in my infant-form? Good! You’ll wait for my revenge!”

The little white tiger shook its butt and turned to walk backward, keeping a distance away from the silver wolf.

The silver wolf took a cold glance at the little white tiger and did not move anymore.

Ye Qingtang returned after a while.

“It beat me just now!” The little white tiger jumped into Ye Qingtang’s arms immediately. It stared at Ye Qingtang with its round eyes that were full of grievance.

“It beat you?” Ye Qingtang was stunned as she saw how pathetic the little white tiger appeared. She looked towards the silver wolf instinctively.

However, the silver wolf was indifferent.

“Why did it beat you?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Don’t you know that tigers do not go well with wolves?”

“That’s for water and fire.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“I don’t care. It slapped me with its paw! I need to take my revenge!” The little white tiger gnashed its teeth.

“Go ahead.” Ye Qingtang looked at the tiny white tiger and then the imposing silver wolf. She then wanted to let go of the little white tiger.

“Well, I’m a tiger. Why should I be bothered by a wolf?” The little white tiger suddenly shook its head and said rightfully.

“…”

It could not beat the silver wolf…

The little white tiger was still at its infant-form. All energy in its body was used up. Any cultivator would be able to beat it.

A Fiendcelestial Beast at its infant-form was almost useless.

“Let’s go.” Ye Qingtang hugged the little white tiger and waved towards the silver wolf.

The silver wolf stood up and shook its fur. It followed Ye Qingtang slowly and walked towards the Falling Sky Valley.

Ye Qingtang entered the Falling Sky Valley previously and explained her intention, hoping that she could enter the Falling Sky Valley for cultivation.

There would be a specialized warden that would be in charge of Ye Qingtang’s assessment. They allowed the spirit animals to follow.

Ye Qingtang arrived outside the Falling Sky Valley together with the little white tiger and the silver wolf after a short while.

There was a huge mountain valley in front of them.

Many disciples were patrolling outside the mountain valley.

“You’re here, Brother Ye.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The disciple at the front smiled as he saw Ye Qingtang.

Previously, when Ye Qingtang reached this place, she offered many things to these patrolling disciples in order to enter the Falling Sky Valley. She also asked them to introduce a warden for her.
