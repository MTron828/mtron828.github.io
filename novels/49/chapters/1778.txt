Chapter 1779: First Move (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If Ba had guessed correctly, the appearance of the three major tribes was connected to the Deity Ocean. The other demon camps must have also realized this, and so had all gathered here at the sound of their horn signals.

“So many have gathered here today...” The Great General of the Earth Demon Tribe crossed his arms behind his back. Those murky eyes swept across the sea of demons, a chilly glint surfacing in his pupils.

All the fiendish demons who caught his gaze couldn’t help shuddering.

“Greetings Great Generals. We have not seen you three for a long time. We specially came after hearing the horn signals.” One of the Great Generals from the other camps stepped forward with an amiable smile. He spoke very carefully.

“Hmph.” The Earth Demon Tribe’s Great General snorted before turning away. He had no regard at all for the other demons. He had been addressing the Heavenly Demon Tribe and the Emperor Demon Tribe only.

The Great General who spoke up broke out in cold sweat after being dismissed by the Earth Demon Tribe’s Great General.

In all other situations, they would be giving wide berth to these three top tribes if they happened to encounter them. But as the Deity Ocean was at stake, even those subpar camps couldn’t help feeling drawn to this place.

A legend passed down over tens of thousands of years, the desire to be the King of Demons—this was enough to trigger the ambitions of any fiendish demon.

The Great Generals from the three top tribes clearly had no regard for the other camps. They just stood there quietly, as if waiting for a particular time.

The demons from the other camps were naturally terrified. But seeing that the three main tribes appeared to be waiting for something, they also followed suit.

“What are they doing?” Ba was feeling uncertain.

Hu replied in a low voice, “The Great Generals of the three big tribes are all standing here without any movement—they must be waiting for something to happen. Didn’t you see all the demons who have gathered here? I am pretty sure the Deity Ocean will be making an appearance. The big three have a better understanding of the Deity Ocean than the rest of us.”

“Then... is the Great General preparing to make a move for the Deity Ocean?” Ba whispered discreetly. So many Great Generals were gathered here with no intention to leave. Could all of them be plotting to snatch the Deity Ocean right from under the noses of those three main tribes?

“Make a guess.” Hu shot Ba a look. “Anyone who manages to obtain the Deity Ocean will become King. Which Great General would let such an opportunity slip by?”

“Aren’t they afraid that the top three tribes will clear them out?” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Clear them out? Who is going to do it? The other two tribes will be the ones to benefit. Anyway... do you think they are bothered by us at all?” Hu sneered.

Ba quietened down and glanced at their own Great General. As expected, his sharp eyes were fixed upon the three top tribes.

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank on hearing the conversation between Ba and Hu.

Previously, she had already felt that something was not quite right. But now, her suspicions had been confirmed...

The eastern Great General was determined to snatch that Deity Ocean away.

But...

Could it be that simple to snatch the Deity Ocean?

Ye Qingtang surveyed the sea of demons. There were countless fiendish demons here and they all had the same goal...

To snatch that Deity Ocean for themselves!

The number of demons gathered here was already mind-boggling. On top of that, the power exuded by those top three tribes was enough to make one’s scalp go numb.

Wasn’t it a death wish to try and fight the big three for the Deity Ocean?
