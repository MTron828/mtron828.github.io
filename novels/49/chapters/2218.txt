“Close your eyes!” Ye Qing suddenly shouted.

Lei Yan and the rest, who were all hiding, were slightly taken aback. Although they had no idea why Ye Qing was ordering them to do so, they instinctively obeyed her instructions and immediately shut their eyes.

Observing Ye Qing’s actions and the mass of hands looking like one huge black net, the Spy Cloud man felt that Ye Qing must be crazy.

He could see that Ye Qing was the weakest person in that group. But not only did he not flee, he charged forward.

Close your eyes?

Close your eyes and wait for death?

Perhaps the Spy Cloud man had already witnessed too many companions die before him. It was like he had already foreseen Ye Qing’s imminent death. He shut his eyes in resignation.

This bunch of folks were mad. Not fleeing at the sight of the Night Soul Beast... he would probably also die here.

Everyone shut their eyes according to Ye Qing’s order. Ye Qingtang was the only one who continued staring coldly at the countless hands surging to her.

Her eyes were calm without even the slightest sliver of panic. The endless wails of those souls swallowed by the Night Soul Beast continuously assaulted her ears.

Ye Qingtang’s view of those hands was different from what the others saw.

As those hands approached her, Ye Qingtang remained unmoving on the spot. Just as those hands were about to make contact with her, they suddenly passed right through her...

She was completely unharmed.

Illusion!

Ye Qingtang gazed impassively at those illusory hands.

In her previous life, it was already 200-300 years later when Ye Qingtang heard of the Evil Soul Forest. By then, the mystery behind this forest had already been solved by people.

Those fearsome-looking Night Soul Beasts were a type of demon. A demon formed by the gathering of tens of thousands of grievances and resentment. The more one feared it, the more powerful they became.

A person’s fear and terror at seeing a Night Soul Beast would make the beast even more fearsome. The Night Soul Beast was born from the resentment of grievous souls and relied on their power. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The more afraid you were of it, the more it could sense the fear in your heart, the more powerful it would be.

If you were not afraid of it, it could not use your fear to support its form.

At this moment, everyone had shut their eyes and could not see the Night Soul Beast. Their fear and thoughts about the Night Soul Beast had been cut off.

Ye Qingtang was the only one who could see it and without any fear or regard. Like this, the massive Night Soul Beast was only seen by Ye Qingtang. Its huge, heinous form started to melt.

This human was not afraid of it?!

The Night Soul Beast could not feel Ye Qingtang’s fear. Her inner mind was exceptionally calm and this was not a pleasant sight for the Night Soul Beast.

Suddenly, the souls in the Night Soul Beast’s body emitted a fresh round of wails. Those wails, sounding as if they were coming from the depths of hell, drifted over to the ears of everyone.

Lei Yan and the others stiffened in fear at those wails. But they suddenly heard Ye Qing’s voice.

“Keep your eyes closed. Cover your eyes.”

The group did not understand Ye Qing’s orders but they followed her instructions and covered their ears, completely isolating themselves from the Evil Soul Forest.

See no evil, hear no evil. The fear inside their hearts transformed into worry instead.

The Night Soul Beast became increasingly furious. It realized that the fear it had been sensing was declining.. despite the constant wailing of those souls, its body started to shrink at a discernible pace.
