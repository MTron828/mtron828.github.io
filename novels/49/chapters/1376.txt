“If you know what’s good for you, you will voluntarily ask for forgiveness. Otherwise, the Dragon Court Sect’s Immortal will think that the Yuan Kingdom asked someone to pose as an immortal, thus insulting the dignity of immortals. Then, your Yuan Kingdom probably… will not exist anymore.”

The Qi Emperor coldly flung these words at them. He had no interest in talking nonsense with the Yuan Emperor. He turned to leave with his royal entourage.

The Yuan Emperor almost vomited blood when he heard the Qi Emperor’s mocking words.

But the Yuan Kingdom was no match for the Qi Kingdom, so he had no choice but to tolerate the insult.

“Immortal, you can just ignore them. The Dragon Court Sect must have recognized your immortal status. When the time comes, these rumors will naturally prove to be unfounded.” The Yuan Emperor looked at Ye Qingtang and suddenly felt fearless and high-hearted.

How could a common person like the Qi Emperor recognize an immortal?

Their Yuan Kingdom had an immortal!

Ye Qingtang felt conflicted when she saw the Yuan Emperor’s worshipful expression.

How successful was she as an impostor?

However…

If Ye Qingtang wanted to accomplish the God of Nature’s third mission, she would have to continue her act. Furthermore, she had to do so impeccably so that no one could spot any flaws.

The truth was that the Qi Emperor was not the only one with doubts. With Ye Qingtang’s superior sense of hearing, if she wanted to, she could clearly hear what everyone on the Floating Island’s shores was saying.

After the Yuan Emperor had shouted “immortal”, many believers had looked at them mockingly. When they whispered together, their taunting words were more unpleasant than what the Qi Emperor had said.

“The Yuan Kingdom is really daring. They dragged any Tom, Dick, and Harry here to pose as an immortal.”

“Someone like her is an immortal? She’s not fit to lick the bootstraps of an immortal.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“When the time comes, we’ll see how the Dragon Court Sect’s ambassadors punish this woman who offends the dignity of immortals.”

There were countless words like that, each more unpleasant than the next.

The Yuan Emperor could not hear as well as Ye Qingtang, so he did not hear these words.

Today was the Dragon Court Sect’s pilgrimage day. Many of the Dragon Court Sect’s servants led the believers towards the pilgrimage site.

These servants were the lowliest ones in the Dragon Court Sect and were not ambassadors. Even so, they approached the monarchs of the various kingdoms with arrogance. The usually lofty monarchs did not complain and continued to smile.

Anyone with the least connection with the Dragon Court Sect was not to be offended.

Ye Qingtang saw all this. She grew increasingly perplexed at this world’s reverence for immortals.

Ye Qingtang was also increasingly curious about this Dragon Court Sect.

Was the Dragon Court Sect’s immortal authentic?

The Qi Emperor had mentioned resurrecting the dead… Could this immortal really do that?

The Dragon Court Sect held the highest status in this mainland. The monthly and yearly offerings presented by the various kingdoms formed a small mountain. The pilgrimage site on Floating Island was incredibly luxurious. At a glance, she could tell that although it was not utterly resplendent, it was imbued with an air of nobility

Even the ground was paved with precious stones of various sizes instead of cobblestones.

Ye Qingtang really experienced the “wealth” of the Dragon Court Sect.

The pilgrimage had not officially started. Everyone took their seats. Although they talked softly among themselves, they did not create a great din.

“Why is there no wine in the wine decanter?” After the Yuan Emperor took his seat, he saw that an exquisite wine decanter was set on each table. This was his first time on pilgrimage, and he could not help but feel a little nervous. He wanted a drink but discovered that the wine decanters were empty, and he could not pour himself any wine.
