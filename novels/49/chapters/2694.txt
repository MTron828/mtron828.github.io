Chapter 2695: Customer, Do You Want To Buy Something? (3)

Lan Shan glanced at the young man and said, “But of course. Do I still need you to tell me that I’m intelligent? Everyone here knows that.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Then, Senior Brother Lan Shan, do you know how to obtain cursed points?” Wan Rong asked Lan Shan.

Lan Shan was slightly taken aback by Wan Rong’s question. His expression was stern as he pondered for a moment before saying, “As for cursed points... they’re actually currency that can be used in the ancient cities. As long as you have cursed points, you can buy anything you want.”

Wan Rong sneered. “Lan Shan, that skeleton explained all that just now. You don’t have to tell us, we all know. What I’m asking you is how to obtain cursed points.”

“That’s right. If we don’t have cursed points, even if we are in the ancient city and can see all these treasures, what’s the point? We can only look but not bring them away.” Another disciple pointed out.

“Cursed points can be obtained by killing any living being. The stronger the living being is, the more cursed points can be obtained. There are actually many other ways to obtain cursed points. Cultivators have to slowly explore the options on their own,” the skeleton continued its explanation.

“Gain cursed points by killing living creatures?”

Everyone’s expressions turned strange. Were there living creatures here?

“Eh... wait, are we considered living beings?” Lan Shan suddenly looked at everyone.

“I think... I think so.”

“We will get cursed points if we kill each other?”

“Kill each other? Is there something wrong with your brain?”

“No... that’s not what I mean. What I mean is that other than our Great Immortal Temple, many disciples from the supreme factions have entered this place. If we kill those disciples from the supreme factions, won’t we get a lot of cursed points?”

“Junior Brother Zhang has a point. I agree!” Lan Shan nodded.

“So, this is to encourage us to kill?” Wan Rong was deep in thought.

“Not necessarily.” Ye Qingtang shook her head and continued, “That skeleton was talking about living beings. Apart from the disciples of the supreme factions, there might be other living beings.”

“Junior Sister Ye Yue makes sense. That is also exactly what I wanted to say.” Lan Shan nodded hurriedly at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang, “...” She had never seen such a shameless person.

The skeleton suddenly said, “Cultivators, I’m not sure if you want to know the method to obtain cursed points at this place. You can choose to accept it or reject it.”

Before anyone could say anything, Lan Shan hurriedly said, “Everyone, don’t speak rashly. This thing is too strange... if we kill it, we might be able to bring out all the Heaven-level divine weapons in the shop!”

Without giving anyone a chance to speak, Lan Shan rushed into the shop.

Lan Shan and the skeleton faced each other.

“Are you considered a living being?!”

Lan Shan shouted as a thick and terrifying aura appeared around him. He slammed his palm onto the skeleton.

“Boom!”

With a loud bang, the skeleton shattered into pieces.

“Killed the shopkeeper of the ancient city. Reward: 50 cursed points.”

An ethereal voice suddenly echoed from all directions.
