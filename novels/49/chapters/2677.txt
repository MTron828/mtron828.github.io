Chapter 2678: Paragon Relic (2)

In that distant primordial era, there was a group of monks whose martial arts strength dominated the world. With their peerless strength, no one could match them.

Before this group of monks appeared, this world had been a battlefield belonging to the demons. Humans were being slaughtered like crazy, and all living beings were trampled under the feet of those demons.

Ye Qingtang still remembered that in her own era, she had read historical records that the Heavenly Demon Tribe appeared out of nowhere and caused misery and suffering to all living beings. Many powerful figures attacked in unison but were wiped out.

In addition, the Heavenly Demon Tribe was only one of the groups of demons. There were existences that were even stronger and more terrifying than the Heavenly Demon Tribe. There were very few historical records about it and they were all already faded. No one knew what happened in that era, nor did anyone know who created all of that. It was still a mystery where those demons came from.

After that, the history of this world was just a blank for 100,000 years. No one knew what happened during that period. However, 100 ,OOO years later, a group of monks appeared out of nowhere. They had the invincible power to dominate the world and worked together to suppress all the demons.

Although the group of monks had remarkable abilities and boundless power, they still paid an extremely tragic price to suppress the demons. Many monks were heavily injured by the battles and died not long after.

To prevent the demons from escaping from the depths of the temple, the remaining monks chose a group of youths with extremely high potential and trained them.

Over the next hundred years, the remaining monks also passed away one after another because they could not overcome their injuries. Nevertheless, those youths became supreme and invincible experts of the world.

With that power, they expanded the temple and created the Great Immortal

Temple over the next thousand years. The temple was responsible for

grooming disciples to suppress the demons. Disciples who obtained the legacies of those invincible experts would be hailed as saints.

In this day and age, countless eras had passed since that dark period. The Great Immortal Temple also underwent a gradual shift from its glorious past to being a steady presence now. Although it no longer had the strength to dominate the world, the mission of the Great Immortal Temple remained the same.

Suppress the demons!

“Ye Yue, the Paragon Relic used to suppress the demons will lose its effectiveness as time passes, ” the Absolute Heaven Saint explained.

“Paragon Relic?” Ye Qingtang looked puzzled. She had never heard of such a thing.

“That’s right.” The Absolute Heaven Saint nodded patiently. “This so-called unparalleled relic is formed from the bones of the ancestors after they passed away. Its function is to continue suppressing the demons underground.”

“I see...” Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

It had to be said that those temple monks really cherished the world. Even after they died, they offered their bodies to be turned into a supreme relic to continue fulfilling their duty. Ye Qingtang felt a deep respect for them.

“Uncle-Master, if the Paragon Relic fails... what will happen then?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown. She had a nagging feeling that something bad was about to happen.

Ye Qingtang always thought that the group of demons under the Great Immortal Temple had always been suppressed by the saints. She never expected that apart from the saints’ powers, they also needed the power of this Paragon Relic..
