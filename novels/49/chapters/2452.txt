Chapter 2453: Space Technique (2)

Ye Qingtang glanced at him. “Why are you still fooling around at a time like this?”

Tears and mucus streamed down Lei Yan’s face. “Indeed, Boss is talking to me too… It must be Boss’ ghost coming to fetch me. Boss, can you take someone else first…”

“Damn, Boss’ ghost is really here to pick me up. I see it too… The two of us are having the same hallucination!” Nangong Lie looked at Lei Yan with an expression filled with emotion.

“Seriously? Boss even brought a dog!” Lei Yan said to Nangong Lie.

“That’s right, it’s a big yellow dog…” Nangong Lie nodded.

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“Boss!”

Suddenly, Qin Feng stood up with excitement in his eyes and strode towards Ye Qingtang.

Seeing this, Nangong Lie pounced over and hugged Qin Feng’s leg. “Don’t! If you go over now, Boss will definitely take you away!”

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck. How did she end up producing such a bunch of foolish students?

“Ye Qing, you… you’re not?” Lu Yuanxiang was the first to come to his senses and stare at her in disbelief. After all, he had seen with his own eyes that Ye Qingtang was killed by that above-Emperor level monster. How could she be standing in front of them alive?!

Was it really as Nangong Lie and the rest had said? Had Ye Qingtang returned as a ghost?

“Stop making stupid guesses. I’m not dead,” Ye Qingtang said in exasperation.

“Boss, it’s really you!”

Mu Ziying hugged her. “I knew that Boss would definitely be fine!”

“Seriously? Am I dreaming?” Nangong Lie smacked his own face.

“That’s great, Teacher Ye Qing. I knew you would be fine!”

At that moment, the teacher from Flying Star Academy stepped forward.

The Flying Star Academy had also suffered heavy losses. More than half of the students in the team had been killed or injured, leaving only this teacher and a few students.

“Ye Qing, I clearly saw you being…” Lu Yuanxiang was confused as he looked at the living Ye Qing.

“I understand your doubts. However, this is not the time to discuss this. Let’s leave first,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Oh no!”

Lu Yuanxiang’s expression changed instantly. “Ye Qing, you shouldn’t have entered this palace!”

Qin Feng and the others instantly came to their senses as well. They had originally just wanted to find a random place to rest, and this palace appeared out of nowhere. Now, they were trapped inside.

The palace door could not be pushed open at all.

Ye Qingtang suddenly understood. If they were from the outside world, it was impossible for them to see this palace. But this palace could take the initiative to appear and capture its prey, imprisoning them in the palace. Noone could leave and they would eventually become a part of the body of energy.

“Boss, what should we do now?”

Yun Chen looked at her.

They had felt lost ever since Ye Qing was gone. But now that Ye Qing had reappeared in front of them, things were different. They believed that if their Boss could come back from the dead, she would definitely have a way to bring them out of here.

“No worries. Since I’m here, I will have a way to bring you all out.” Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog.

Everyone was stunned. Why was Ye Qing looking at the big yellow dog after saying he would bring them out?

“Don’t worry. With me by your side, it’s too easy to get out.” The yellow dog was confident..
