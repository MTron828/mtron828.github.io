Chapter 1640: Insane Luck (2)

Many people prayed that they could avoid the top disciples. There were only twenty positions available. Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai took two of the positions, and they could only fight for the remaining eighteen positions. If they encountered Jiang Yisheng or Jiang Yiran at the beginning, they would really cry out on the spot.

Ye Qingtang stood at the side after drawing her lots. The few young men who were quite close to her also drew their lots.

Soon, the elder announced the pairs. The young man beside Ye Qingtang’s expression changed when he heard that he was going to fight against Jiang Xinyue. He cried miserably as he stared at his lot. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Ye Qingtang had met Jiang Xinyue once. She was able to master advanced sword skills, and she could be ranked as one of the top ten in the Taiyuan Valley.

“Doomed... doomed... I’m doomed. Jiang Yisheng, is Jiang Xinyue sharpening the sword...” The young man said miserably.

“Even if your opponent was not Jiang Xinyue, you will not be able to enter the top twenty. Did you even cultivate every day?” Jiang Yisheng did not pity him at all. He tilted his head to look at Ye Qingtang’s lot.

“Your opponent is Jiang Lan?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Jiang Yisheng smiled and tapped Ye Qingtang’s shoulder, “You’re lucky. Jiang Lan is the weird guy in the Taiyuan Valley. He was very talented when he was born, but he wasted his talent as he grew up. Your cultivation in the past few months is good enough to fight him.”

The other few young men all congratulated her as Ye Qingtang’s opponent was the worst disciple in the valley.

Soon, the first round started.

Ye Qingtang went on the stage and was about to battle Jiang Lan. He was slightly overweight and did not look like someone who practiced martial arts. He was holding a giant hammer and looked clumsy.

The battle began. Jiang Lan shouted and smashed his hammer towards Ye Qingtang. His footsteps were messy. Ye Qingtang dodged and kicked his thick back at the next second.

With a loud boom, Jiang Lan fell down directly and rolled his eyes.

“Well done! Qing Tang!” Jiang Yisheng and the rest cheered for her.

Ye Qingtang won almost instantly. There were only a few people by the stage. She walked off the stage after her victory.

On the high stage, Elder Qian and the rest of the elders all paid attention to battles on every stage. He also took note of Ye Qingtang’s side.

Elder Qian nodded slightly as she beat Jiang Lan. However, Jiang Lan’s ability was extremely low, and the elders had already decided to expel him from the Taiyuan Valley after the selection. Thus, the elders did not care about the result of this battle.

The winners drew lots again after the first round. The second round would then begin, and the process would repeat until the top twenty was selected.

A few young men who were with Jiang Yisheng were unlucky as their opponents were those who were highly ranked in the valley. It was a hard battle for each one of them.

However, Ye Qingtang was very lucky. All her opponents were mainly ranked in the bottom in the valley. She did not face any challenges during the battles.

Initially, Jiang Yisheng and the rest congratulated her on her luck as she always battled the worst ones in the valley. However, after the fifth round, the way they looked at Ye Qingtang changed.

“Next round will be the round to top twenty. Isn’t Ye Qingtang way too lucky?! Yisheng, I heard that Ye Qingtang was brought back by the Domain Monarch Founder. Did the elders play some tricks in the lots?” One of the young men whispered. His previous opponent was Jiang Yiran, and he failed immediately.
