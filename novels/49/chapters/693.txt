Right at that instant, dozens of family clan cultivators arrived at the black market.

Zhou Fu’s eyes shone, and he immediately welcomed the people.

“Family Master, it is that spirit animal!” Zhou Fu walked to an elderly’s side and pointed at the little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

The elderly nodded. He happened to see the little white tiger’s imposing manner earlier on as well.

“Master Li…” The Clan Master of the Zhou family clan looked at a teenager in purple clothes.

The teenager in purple clothes was a Beast Tamer at a Master level and had some relations with the Zhou family. It was a coincidence that he had been staying in the Zhou residence as a guest for these past few days.

A Beast Tamer Master was extremely rare even in super sects and could control both demonic beasts or spirit animals.

“General, this person committed a serious crime but is protected by a spirit animal. How about we combine forces and eliminate him?” Clan Master Zhou walked to the Dragon-Tiger General and suggested with a smile.

The Dragon-Tiger General said, “Sure. There is a Beast Tamer Master in your Zhou family clan. You all can just control that bastard animal!”

The Dragon-Tiger General’s words were aligned with Clan Master Zhou’s thoughts. They only wanted to obtain that spirit animal and did not wish to care about anything else.

“Master Li, you…” Clan Master Zhou looked at the teenager in purple clothes and spoke slowly.

The teenager in purple clothes nodded slightly. When his eyes landed on the little white tiger, he laughed coldly. “That spirit animal is indeed extraordinary. The white flame that it spat out just now has a very powerful force of destruction. However…”

“Master Li, however what?” Clan Master Zhou asked anxiously.

“However, I can’t tell what breed that spirit animal is.” Master Li replied thoughtfully.

Clan Master Zhou probed. “Are you able to subdue that spirit animal…”

Master Li smiled faintly. “There’s no problem. For this type of spirit animal, it is not difficult to control a more grown form, much less an infant form.”

The crowd was suddenly in an uproar when they saw that the Zhou family clan brought the Beast Tamer Master here.

“That foreigner fellow thought he could keep his life by relying on a spirit animal… What a joke.”

“Haha. The Zhou family clan has a Beast Tamer Master here right now. It seems that the Zhou family clan heard the news and took a fancy on that fellow’s spirit animal. They even invited the Beast Tamer Master to help them. No matter how powerful that spirit animal is, it will end up in the Zhou family clan’s hands this time!”

“He is, after all, an outsider and does not know the danger of Nine Nights Dynasty’s monarch city. He is still too young and arrogant. He was not well-behaved and dared to kill Shangguan Rui. After the spirit animal is taken away by the Zhou family clan, this fellow will definitely land in the Dragon-Tiger General’s hands.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“He will definitely be tortured and be forced to divulge information of his family clan, who will all be killed by the Dragon-Tiger General in the end!”

Discussions erupted in the crowd.

The little white tiger glared at that Beast Tamer Master and scoffed coldly. “F*ck. How dare a bullsh*t Beast Tamer Master wish to control me!”

Then, the little white tiger opened its mouth and wanted to use the white flame to burn that Beast Tamer Master alive.

However, that Beast Tamer Master’s eyes flickered, and he placed his palms together. An abstruse aura immediately enveloped the little white tiger in it.

“Spirit Restriction Spell?!” The little white tiger was slightly taken aback. “What the f*ck… The energy in my body is all absorbed from the Hell of Avicinaraka mystic realm. This Spirit Restriction Spell indeed has some effect on me…”
