Chapter 2237: Puppet Emperor (3)

The Night Soul Beast immediately shook its head and put on an innocent look.

No way Ye Qingtang would trust it.

“Signing a contract is beneficial to both you and me. If you are unwilling, I will leave now with you.”

The Night Soul Beast turned as if it did not care about Ye Qingtang’s threat at all.

It knew that she wanted to save someone. After all, that human girl was still in the clutches of those men. The Night Soul Beast was sure that Ye Qingtang wouldn’t dare to leave just like that.

But before the Night Soul Beast could react further, Ye Qingtang picked it up and appeared as if she was really going to leave with it.

The Night Soul Beast was stunned.

At this moment, it suddenly recalled those men it had encountered earlier in the Evil Soul Forest.

Those humans were from the same group. But after meeting it, they had scattered, not caring about whether their companions were dead or alive. Some even injured their own companions in their bid to flee, trying to make use of them to slow down the beast’s pursuit.

Ye Qingtang said she wanted to save her friend. But it was clear to the beast that she cared more about her own life.

The Night Soul Beast was not sure about all this. Although Ye Qingtang might be willing to ditch her friend, the Night Soul Beast couldn’t let these people invade the fiendcelestial’s tomb!

“Woo!” The Night Soul Beast quickly grabbed Ye Qingtang’s arm.

“What? Regretting it now?” Ye Qingtang raised her eyebrows.

The Night Soul Beast gritted its teeth.

Damn this devious human!

“It seems that you are the one begging to sign a contract with me now,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Night Soul Beast gritted its teeth so hard that they nearly cracked. If not for the sake of protecting the tomb, would it sign a contract with a human?

And such a weak human!

In the past, it could squash a human of this level with a single foot. But now...

What an insult!

Ye Qingtang quietly steadied her own heart when she saw that the Night Soul Beast had taken the bait. She signed a contract with it.

Even with this contract, the Night Soul Beast was too powerful, and Ye Qingtang would not be able to make it do all her bidding. At the very most, she could only ensure that it would not do anything to harm her.

However, that was enough.

...

The major factions were gradually losing patience. They only knew that the Night Soul Beasts were now in hibernation but did not know when they would awaken.

Battling Night Soul Beasts was something that no one wanted.

Until now, no matter how powerful a practitioner was, no one had been a match for the Night Soul Beast. The best result was to drag one’s gravely injured body back home, lucky to be alive.

“Let’s not delay any longer. The fiendcelestial’s tomb is inside this mountain so the entrance should be located as soon as possible,” a Falling Water Pavilion elder spoke gravely.

The various powers had one common goal now. The fiendcelestial’s tomb was a major lure to them. Although everyone looked very harmonious now, the real bloodshed would occur once the fiendcelestial’s tomb was found.

Now, they were just trying to leverage off each other.

Everyone nodded and started to search for the tomb’s entrance.

After following Shi Shangfei, Peng Ji would glance at the captured Mu Ziying now and then. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“That’s the Rising Dragon Island’s own business. Don’t be nosy if you don’t wish to die.” Shi Shangfei could see what Peng Ji was thinking.

Peng Ji quietly shrank back and said hurriedly, “Division Head Shi, I don’t have other intentions. It’s just that I happened to have met her earlier. I just find it strange as to why the Rising Dragon Island would capture her. Is she really the one whom the Puppet Emperor is searching for? But... I remembered that the Puppet Emperor’s notice clearly stated that she was to be brought to him completely unharmed?”
