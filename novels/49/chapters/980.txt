Chapter 981 Death Wish (2)

Yet, who would have thought…

Dan Yifan would be so badly injured.

“What on earth has happened? Who injured him?” Ye Ling asked with a frown.

The youths from the Ye Family seemed rather dazed and only snapped out of their trance and replied at Ye Ling’s shout. “It was… the Eldest Young Master of the Duan Family, Duan Tianyun.”

“Duan Tianyun?” Ye Ling and the others were all taken aback.

One should know that Duan Tianyun was the most powerful among the younger members of the Duan Family. However, Duan Tianyun had not acted before, so they had subconsciously overlooked his existence and thought that Duan Tianyun would not participate in this match.

“How could it be Duan Tianyun? Wasn’t it Duan Luoning who sparred with Yifan?” The Great Elder asked hurriedly.

The youths from the Ye Family said, “It is true that Duan Luoning issued the challenge. At first, it was Duan Luoning who stepped onto the dais with Young Master Dan. Young Master Dan even beat Duan Luoning. But Duan Tianyun suddenly entered the arena and stepped up onto the dais in his capacity as a Duan Family member… Young Master Dan had no choice but to take him on… Who knew that Duan Tianyun would be so vicious and give no quarter.”

The youths from the Ye Family were enraged when they recalled Duan Tianyun’s viciousness during the match. Duan Tianyun had not just been interested in winning; he had been out to kill.

“That Duan Tianyun! He’s so vicious!” The Great Elder’s eyes were bloodshot with rage. He wished he could tear Duan Tianyun into pieces.

“Now is not the time for this. Yifan has been badly injured. We should quickly find someone to treat him,” said Ye Ling with a frown.

They had not expected Duan Tianyun to appear.

They had thought that the Ye Family would certainly win this round.

Yet, who would have imagined that an accident like that would happen?

Now, they could already guess the conclusion without asking for further details.

Among the younger members of the Ye Family, Dan Yifan was the most powerful.

Now, even Dan Yifan had been defeated by Duan Tianyun. The Ye Family had probably lost.

Since they already had an idea of what had happened, Ye Ling and the others did not ask any more questions. Since they could not change the outcome, they would try their best to cut their losses.

The Great Elder hurriedly ordered someone to send Dan Yifan for treatment while Ye Ling told the other youths from the Ye Family to rest for the time being.

The youths were all dazed, as if thinking of something. They glanced at Ye Qingtang from time to time, and their expressions were complicated.

“The Duan Family came prepared. Duan Luoning’s challenge was only meant to bait them out. They were probably prepared from the start for Duan Tianyun to act.” Ye Ling took a deep breath and involuntarily thought of their previous agreement with the Duan Family.

If they lost this fight, the Ye Family would have to pay tribute to the Duan Family. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“The Duan Family’s plan was truly malicious. No matter how we considered the matter, we overlooked this point. Come to think of it, they did not allow Duan Tianyun to act so that we would let down our guard, but we were careless to have fallen into their trap!” Second Elder thumped the table heavily.

“With this defeat, our Ye Family will suffer severe losses…” Third Elder sighed softly.

The Great Elder’s expression was extremely ugly. His grandson had been badly injured, and they had fallen into the Duan Family’s trap. How could he not hate them?

“Since this is the reality, then we had better be prepared. Otherwise, the Duan Family will use it as an excuse to create trouble, and who knows how far they will take matters,” Third Elder said helplessly. They had no choice but to admit that they had lost the bet.
