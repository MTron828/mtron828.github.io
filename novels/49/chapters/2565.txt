Chapter 2566: Entering the Ancient God Karma Tunnel (4)

It turned out that the big yellow dog was the sun-eating monster that the Blood Moon Elder was talking about…

Ye Qingtang suspected that those with the Karma Bloodline could largely control the direction of the Karma Tunnel. It could be a doomed hell or a blessed paradise. Otherwise, the big yellow dog would not have come to the lower realm.

“Hmph, when I finally return home, I will definitely kill everyone with the karma bloodline. I was too greedy back then and they joined forces to trick me. I didn’t even plan to enter. I was originally looking for food in a blessed land, but the Ancient God Karma Tunnel opened and sucked that blessed land in. Naturally, I followed it inside. I’ve never been to the lower realm and thought that the sun was edible energy from the blessed land.” The big yellow dog snorted coldly as if it was feeling very indignant.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. In the end, the dog didn’t manage to eat the sun but fell into a deep coma. However, Ye Qingtang did not expect that the Wailing Well was actually a product of the upper realm. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Then… Is the Demon God who was resurrected in the Wailing Well… also from the upper realm?” Ye Qingtang asked with a frown.

“How is that possible? That is all in the future. After it landed in the lower realm, it’s impossible that no one has ever entered the Wailing Well since. It has nothing to do with the upper realm.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

Ye Qingtang didn’t refute the big yellow dog. If it was really from the upper realm, the big yellow dog would definitely be able to tell at a glance.

“Holy Lady… Brother Canine, what are you talking about? Upper and lower realms?” The Blood Moon Elder was a little dazed.

“Why are you asking so many questions? Can you understand if I explain to you?” The big yellow dog glanced at the Blood Moon Elder.

“Brother Canine, what are you saying? How would I understand if you don’t explain? As long as you explain to me, I would definitely know what you mean. I’m not a fool,” the Blood Moon Elder said.

The big yellow dog looked at the Blood Moon Elder. “You need to remove the word ‘not’ from your last sentence.”

“I’m not a fool… If I remove the word ‘not’… I’m a fool,” the Blood Moon Elder said instinctively.

“Yup, that’s right.” The big yellow dog wagged its tail.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder, “…”

“Cut the crap, it’s already dark now. This place is close to the black mountain and the demonic aura is still thick here. I’m afraid there will be demonic beasts appearing late at night. We should try to arrive at the Ancient God Karma Tunnel as soon as possible,” Ye Qingtang said.

Unable to convince Ye Qingtang otherwise, the Blood Moon Elder finally gave in and followed her.

...

The next morning, the sky gradually lightened. A night had passed.

In front of them was an endless river. A faint red beam about a hundred meters long streaked across the sky.

“Ancient God Karma Tunnel…”

The big yellow dog looked at the hundred-meter red beam.

Ye Qingtang’s spirits were lifted when she heard that. They had finally arrived.

Just as she had predicted earlier, there were no auspicious signs from the heavens about the Ancient God Karma Tunnel yet. Therefore, no one had discovered it. Coupled with the fact that it was located in an extremely remote area, there was not a single person here.

Around the red beam were many giant skeletons. Judging from their appearance, they seemed to be the remains of extremely powerful demon beasts.

It appeared that the demon beasts here had discovered the red beam and approached it out of curiosity. However, they had been killed by the dense karma energy.

“Holy Lady, I’ll go forward and see if there’s any danger. Wait for me here. If there’s no danger, come over. If there’s danger, run.” With that, the Blood Moon Elder pretended to step forward.

But Ye Qingtang pulled him back.
