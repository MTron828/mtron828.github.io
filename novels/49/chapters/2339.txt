Chapter 2340: Doubts (3)

All those miraculous things happened after Ye Qing brought them out! As Di Nuo mulled over it, he became increasingly convinced that he had come upon the truth.

No wonder Ye Qing dared to make that bet with him.

He was a fake!

Ye Qing must have brought his students out and found someone who was not a Netherworld Academy teacher to teach them. He then brought them back to pass off their progress as his own hard work, gaining recognition for things he was undeserving of. With this kind of character, Wu Fengling would never keep him.

Since he was a fake, it would be taken that he had lost the bet.

Some color finally returned to Di Nuo’s ashen face.

Zhu Ning continued to look very solemn. He did not care whether it was Ye Qing who taught them. He also did not believe that a young person like him could be so formidable.

If anything, he was more intent on finding out who the real practitioner who taught Yun Chen that palm flame was.

Yun Chen’s perfect quality Sky Spirit Jade Elixir had shaken the hearts of everyone. Lei Yan and the others were about to drag him off for a proper celebration when they saw Zhu Ning and Di Nuo coming down from the high stage. They were heading toward Ye Qing and his students.

“Boss, do you think Teacher Zhu is going to apologize to you?” Nangong Lie smirked.

Previously, Zhu Ning believed that Yun Chen would never qualify for the Inter-Academy Competition. Now, he must be utterly shocked!

Not only did Yun Chen qualify, but the quality of his elixir was also even better than that loser, Song Yanhan’s.

Just the distressed look on Song Yanhan’s face sent a thrill down Nangong Lie’s spine.

Who did he think he was?

Did he know who their Boss was!

Ye Qing didn’t say anything.

Song Yanhan also noticed Zhu Ning. His face was pale and he looked very grim. He never expected to lose, and definitely not to someone as inconsequential as Yun Chen.

“Master, I…” Song Yanhan walked over with his pale face.

But Zhu Ning only ignored him, instead, he went over to Ye Qing.

Lei Yan and the others got all excited when they saw Zhu Ning come over. They were just waiting to see how that proud old head would bow down before their Boss. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

So he finally realized how formidable their Boss was, huh?

Ye Qingtang didn’t think too much. But after seeing Zhu Ning’s expression, she knew that things were not as simple as what her students believed.

“Ye Qing.” Zhu Ning looked at Ye Qingtang impassively.

“Tell me honestly. Who did you seek out to teach Yun Chen? If you tell me the truth, I will not pursue other matters.”

Lei Yan and the rest were stunned by Zhu Ning’s words.

What did he mean by that?

Seek out who to teach Yun Chen?

Pursue what other matters?

This old man was so shameless and a sore loser. Didn’t he say that he would seal off his tripod forever? Now, he wanted to pursue things with their Boss?

What kind of nonsense was Zhu Ning spouting?

Di Nuo spoke up. “Ye Qing, since Teacher Zhu has already promised you, just tell the truth. Otherwise things might get ugly.”

Their statements had attracted quite a bit of attention.

The students all knew that Yun Chen had been taught by Ye Qing during this period. Previously, they had been shocked that a martial arts teacher like Ye Qing could teach so well.

But Zhu Ning and Di Nuo’s words instantly solved the mystery.

It must be that…

Ye Qing didn’t teach him personally?

He had found someone else?

Yun Chen’s face darkened.

“Teacher Zhu, I don’t know why you are asking such a question. Teacher Ye taught me everything I know. No one else intervened.”
