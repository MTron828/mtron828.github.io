Chapter 587: Possession (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

She finally understood what Ye Qingtang meant by needing her body…

She actually wanted to let someone possess her body!

Ouyang Qian clenched her teeth. She originally wanted to get out of this situation, but she did not have any strength left in her body.

“Holy Lady, I feel that…”

The Blood Moon Elder originally wanted to use emotions and reason to persuade Ye Qingtang, but he was cut short by Ye Qingtang halfway. “This girl has a superb martial talent and cultivates demonic techniques. Her current skills have already entered the peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, and she will break through to the Second Heaven and even the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three very quickly. If you’re willing to possess her, everything she has would become yours.”

After hearing that, the Blood Moon Elder was suddenly quiet.

What Ye Qingtang said indeed attracted him. The peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three in addition to superb martial talent… With the support of Ye Qingtang’s elixirs, perhaps he would be able to return to his peak once again. Surpassing his peak might not be impossible.

“But…”

The Blood Moon Elder was still a little bothered. After all, he was to suddenly become a woman without any mental preparation…

“No buts.” Ye Qingtang waved a hand and cut his sentence short. “We are in the Hundred Level Peril Hell of Avicinaraka right now. Even I barely have the ability to protect myself. Have you ever thought of whether you can leave this place alive based on your skills?”

“This…” The Blood Moon Elder’s expression changed.

If Ye Qingtang had not knocked him unconscious at that temple previously, his ending would definitely be extremely tragic as well.

“Ah.” Ye Qingtang shook her head at the Blood Moon Elder and sighed. “Forget it. I see that you do not wish to do this as well, so I will not force you anymore. You can’t fancy the skills of a cultivator at the peak of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three with peerless demonic techniques anyways. I’m afraid that you don’t even care when you die in the mystic realm. Since that’s the case, why would I convince you? Whatever. Forget it. You can leave.”

After saying that, Ye Qingtang saw that the Blood Moon Elder was still standing at the same spot and said rather impatiently, “Leave quickly.”

The Blood Moon Elder’s heart was shaken. Almost in the next second, his face was full of smiles. “Holy Lady… I think that what you said is logical, and of course, I will listen to your arrangements.”

So be it if it was a woman. It was still better than dying in this Hell of Avicinaraka.

The Blood Moon Elder did not wish to die in this mystic realm. Even if his spirit would not be destroyed when he died, if he died in this mystic realm which started at irregular timings, there would probably be no hope of returning to his previous position in this lifetime.

“This is right,” Ye Qingtang said and patted the Blood Moon Elder’s left shoulder. “I’m not letting you be a female forever. If there is a better male body next time, wouldn’t it be great if you possessed it again then?”

The Blood Moon Elder nodded in full agreement. He was not going to be a woman for his entire lifetime, and what he was doing now was only a temporary expedient!

A great man knew when to yield and when to not!

Seeing that the Blood Moon Elder was finally enlightened, she did not say anything else and merely lifted her chin at Ouyang Qian.

Immediately understanding her gesture, the Blood Moon Elder walked towards Ouyang Qian with a sinister smile.

“You… You all!”

Currently, Ouyang Qian had already understood what the two people meant and paled in fear. “I am… the Young Miss of Nine Nights Dynasty’s Ouyang clan. If you all… dare to do anything, my Ouyang clan will definitely… assassinate you all by wrathful means!”
