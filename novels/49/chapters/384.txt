“There’s such an incident?”

“Of course. If I were to say, Ye Qingtang would probably just die without being able to make a second move.”

There was an eruption of messy discussions. Beside the ring, Fei Ying and Ni Shang’s palms were sweaty from the nervousness. Everything they heard was unfavorable to Ye Qingtang, and while Ye Qingtang was set on entering the ring, they felt their hearts suspending in the air at that moment.

“Dear lord… I’m begging you… Please bless and protect Miss.” Ni Shang clasped her hands near her lips and softly prayed to the heavens.

On the other hand, Fei Ying narrowed his eyes and glared at Song Junqiu and the other three on the ring. He clenched his fists quietly with an unusually baleful expression in his eyes.

If Miss was really defeated, he would definitely make the four of them pay with their blood!

On the ring, Song Junqiu and the other three wore a casual expression as they scanned Ye Qingtang quietly.

“Senior Brother Song, although Ye Qingtang overestimated her abilities, her looks… are really likable… It would really be a pity for her to die on the ring.” A disciple, who harbored evil designs on Ni Shang previously, had an evil thought after seeing Ye Qingtang’s stunning face.

“Even if it’s a pity, it can only be a pity. I don’t wish to see her stepping out of the ring alive today,” Song Junqiu said coldly.

Ye Qingtang damaged his reputation two consecutive times, and if he did not teach her a lesson, how was he to domineer the inner sect in the future?

With Song Junqiu’s words, the three disciples naturally knew how to act.

Song Junqiu looked up and straight at Ye Qingtang with a wicked gaze. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Junior Sister Ye, you’re so courageous today, and we will naturally not be wet blankets. On the Life and Death Ring, it is up to fate whether one lives or dies. Take care, Junior Sister Ye.”

He quietly shot the three people a look, and they understood his meaning immediately. The four people separated out and trapped Ye Qingtang in the center of the ring from four corners.

There was a person at all four corners, trapping Ye Qingtang who was positioned in the center. Once the battle started, one could imagine how dangerous it would be when the four people attacked together.

“Song Junqiu indeed does not intend to go easy. I think Ye Qingtang really will die here this time.”

“Song Junqiu even brought the Glacial Frost Sword today. He did not intend to let Ye Qingtang off from the start.” A disciple’s sharp eyes noticed the sword hung on Song Junqiu’s waist.

“Glacial Frost Sword?”

“Song Junqiu brought this Glacial Frost Sword from his family clan. It is said that the sword is very expensive, and if placed in the Xuanming Pavilion, it would require sixty to seventy thousand Xuanming points to exchange for it.”

“I heard that the Glacial Frost Sword is not only extremely sharp but was also made using frozen iron and thus very sturdy. As long as you’re injured by the Glacial Frost Sword, the wound would be infected with ice poison immediately. Ye Qingtang is really dead this time…”

Song Junqiu had a prestigious background where his family clan possessed a strong influence. The Glacial Frost Sword in his hands was famous as well. Although it was not a top-grade divine weapon, it was still very powerful. With the ice poison attribute, its name was recorded in the weapons register.

Song Junqiu drew out his Glacial Frost Sword immediately, and cold air was emitted from the blade. He glanced at Ye Qingtang’s sword with a belittling expression.

That sheath was old and simple without any color. After taking a look, Song Junqiu raised a brow scornfully.

“Junior Sister Ye, draw your sword out.”
