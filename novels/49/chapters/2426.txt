Chapter 2427: Death (1)

Just as Mu Ziying finished her warning, shocked cries could be heard from the Flying Star Academy team following behind them. In an instant, the Flying Star Academy team fled toward them like a bunch of lunatics.

“Monster! Monster!!” One of the Flying Star Academy teenagers was clearly terrified. His face was pale as he sprinted forward.

Ye Qingtang and the others turned to see a massive black shadow rapidly approaching them. Before they could get a good look, Lu Yuanxiang’s face paled as if he detected something.

“Yes… our monster looked something like that… Teacher Ye, we have to escape now!” Lu Yuanxiang was unable to see the monster clearly but that oppressive aura was very familiar. That black figure gave him a feeling that was very similar to the monster that first attacked them, yet somewhat different.

It was yet another above-Emperor level monster coming toward them.

No one expected the sudden appearance of this monster. Without any hesitation, Ye Qingtang led her group to escape.

Even she would not be able to handle an above-Emperor level monster.

Lu Yuanxiang’s team was seriously injured and could not move fast. Lei Yan and the others each carried one of them and fled together with the Flying Star Academy folks.

But even though they tried their best, the distance between the black figure and them narrowed continuously. The ground beneath their feet vibrated constantly as a fierce wind blasted their ears. They felt like their eardrums were going to burst.

“Did you have a clear look at that thing?” Ye Qingtang asked when she caught up with the Flying Star Academy teacher.

The teacher looked extremely grim as he instinctively nodded. But then he shook his head.

“No… I didn’t have a good look. That thing was too big. We couldn’t see its full body. I just remember… it was all black… and it looked like it was covered by multiple worms…”

The Flying Star Academy teacher shuddered at the memory. That thing looked like it was created by countless long, black worms entangled together. Those black worms were still wriggling and just the sight of it made one feel like throwing up.

Ye Qingtang furrowed her brows slightly. Going by what he described, it was a different monster from the one Lu Yuanxiang’s team encountered.

Ye Qingtang tried to make use of the dense forest to shake off the monster, but the monster was too large and its height far surpassed the tops of the trees in the Wailing Well. From its high vantage point, it could see the direction they were fleeing.

Even more startling to Ye Qingtang was the fact that…

That monster kept pursuing them without any intention of leaving.

Why?

Ye Qingtang found this very strange. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lu Yuanxiang’s team suffered grievous injuries because they happened to be at the spot where the monster burrowed out of the ground. Although the monster attacked them then, it did not pursue them after they fled.

But this monster behind them seemed to treat them as prey, chasing them relentlessly.

Furthermore…

Ye Qingtang realized that the Flying Star Academy team was the first to encounter this monster. Although they didn’t get a full look at it, the teacher still managed to see the worms on its body. It could be deduced how close they must have been.
