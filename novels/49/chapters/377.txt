“Exchange exchange exchange!” The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eyes flickered after seeing the Summoning Soul Pill.

Xuanming points were only a string of numbers to him without any use, but the Summoning Soul Pill was a baby.

Then, the Blood Moon Sect Elder slid all his Xuanming points to Ye Qingtang’s bracelet and hugged that bottle of Summoning Soul Pills with a blissful smile.

With the two thousand Xuanming points from the Blood Moon Sect Elder and the few thousands she had, Ye Qingtang had nearly six thousand Xuanming points. Subsequently, she sprinted to the Xuanming Pavilion with the curious Blood Moon Sect Elder following right after.

Ye Qingtang’s arrival in the pavilion immediately drew the attention of many disciples.

“Ye Qingtang? I heard that she issued a challenge on the Life and Death Ring to Song Junqiu and his three followers yesterday. Is it true?”

“Can it not be? The Life and Death Agreement was already signed. In my opinion, she is simply seeking death. She just entered the inner sect for a month yet dared to issue a challenge to four people. If that isn’t seeking death, then what is?”

“Why do I remember that Ye Qingtang is a red spirit root? It was already pretty strange when she entered the inner sect previously. Why is she stirring up trouble now?”

“She is the only red spirit root in the inner sect, which is rather amazing if I were to say. However, she is a little overboard on this matter. What is her skill level now? She’s at most stage one of the First Heaven in Martial Qi Level One, but she actually dared to challenge them?”

“Fighting against four people at one go. Is she really tired of living?”

“Just an inflated ego.”

There was a clamor of discussion amongst the disciples. The news of Ye Qingtang challenging Song Junqiu’s clique had already circulated widely in the inner sect, provoking much noise. It could be said to be the biggest joke in the inner sect recently.

Ye Qingtang walked into the Xuanming Pavilion without bothering about the discussions.

“I want to exchange for the Quenching Flame Pill,” Ye Qingtang said to the Xuanming Pavilion warden.

The Quenching Flame Pill was a type of pill that could stimulate spirit energy and allow the spirit energy in one’s body to reach a peak in a short span of time.

The disciples watched Ye Qingtang in curiosity and reckoned that the Quenching Flame Pill that she exchanged for was to be used on the Life and Death Ring.

However, while the Quenching Flame Pill could boost one’s skills in a short time, the duration of the peak state was extremely short. Moreover, it could stimulate the spirit energy to the maximum because it forcefully catalyzed the effect of the spirit energy in the body. Once the effect wore off, the user would fall into a frail condition very quickly.

Even if Ye Qingtang consumed the Quenching Flame Pill and displayed her peak abilities, it would still be difficult for her to deal with Song Junqiu and the rest on the Life and Death Ring. After all, she had not reached the realm of those four disciples, and the difference of a stage was enough to produce a landslide victory.

The warden looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “One hundred Xuanming points for one pill. How many pills do you want?”

After making an estimation, Ye Qingtang finally replied. “Twenty.”

“…”

Ye Qingtang words caused the onlooking disciples to be dumbfounded.

Twenty pills?

Is she treating the Quenching Flame Pill as a mud ball? Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Disciples would only prepare at most one pill on usual days. Who would buy twenty pills at once?

Is she insane?

If she swallowed all of them in a go, wouldn’t she explode and die?

The warden clearly did not expect Ye Qingtang to ask for so many as well and only returned to his senses after a while.

“You want twenty pills?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

The warden looked at Ye Qingtang strangely and really could not figure out what she wanted those for. However, since she wanted to exchange for the items, he naturally did not have any reason to stop her.
