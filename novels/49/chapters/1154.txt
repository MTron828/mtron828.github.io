Chapter 1155: The Spirit Energy Crisis (1)

As the golden-robed man had said, it was basically unrealistic to resist the You Ancient Clan even with ten more Yang Lords.

Swoosh!

At this instant, many figures flashed across the sky.

Ultimate Elder finally sighed in relief at the sight.

“Finally here.”

Several figures loomed from the sky and entered everyone’s vision. After the elderly in the lead landed on the ground, he immediately looked at Ultimate Elder and spoke.

“Ultimate Elder, it’s been long.”

Looking at those people who arrived suddenly, Ye Qingtang realized that there were many Yang Lords who came with the elderly, and the clothes that they were wearing were embroidered with a foreign and aged totem.

A guess struck Ye Qingtang almost instinctively.

Ye Qingtang seemed to have seen that totem in an ancient book in her previous life before.

It was just that the ancient book only had a few fragments left when Ye Qingtang obtained it, and this totem appeared in the remaining excerpts. Although there was no detailed description of the origin of this totem, it vaguely mentioned that this totem seemed to be related to the ancient clan of this mainland.

Although this mainland’s martial culture was backward, it still had a long history, and there were many hidden ancient clans.

Apart from the obscure ancient clan that attacked Falling Sky Valley, there were other ancient clans living in between the mountains and clouds.

Similarly, both the Ancient You Clan and the Domain Monarch’s Jiang Clan in Central Mainland were classified as ancient clans.

The totem seen on the group of people who came suddenly led Ye Qingtang to guess that they could be an ancient clan that had been concealed from the world for a long time, though she could not be certain.

However…

Looking at how that elderly in the lead and Ultimate Elder were talking, they seemed to know each other.

The golden-robed man from You Ancient Clan stared at those ancient clan figures who rushed over fearlessly, and a sneer hung on his lips. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You think too highly of yourselves.”

In reality, given the backward martial culture of this mainland, the obscure ancient clans of this mainland were no match for those of the Central Mainland even if they showed up.

However…

To a certain extent, if the obscure ancient clans of this mainland were willing to join the war, they could still resist the Ancient You Clan for a period of time even if they were unable to defeat the Ancient You Clan. After all, this mainland’s suppression of skills could slightly restrain the Ancient You Clan’s skills.

Had there not been such suppression, the Ancient You Clan would probably have destroyed this mainland a long time ago.

Ye Qingtang was even more somber when she saw the golden-robed man’s arrogant attitude.

If there were powerful figures at Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven like Divine King Luo Xue, the calamity of this mainland could be easily prevented.

Nonetheless, the Yin Yang Perfected Lord Tenth Heaven figure from the obscure ancient clan that attacked Falling Sky Valley had been killed by Divine King Luo Xue, and Divine King Luo Xue, himself, was dead too. This mainland most likely had no other figures at Yang Lord Tenth Heaven.

As the mainland’s catastrophe approached, an increasing number of itinerant cultivators rushed over to the battlefield.

It was just that this mainland’s spirit energy was too thin, and only a handful number of itinerant cultivators were powerful figures as almost all the true powerful figures were in ancient clans.

For example, one of the powerful figures from the ancient clan killed by Divine King Luo Xue was in the Yang Lord Tenth Heaven realm, and he was considered an ancient figure.
