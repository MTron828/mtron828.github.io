Chapter 2672: I Won’t Let It Hurt You (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ling Yan looked at the big yellow dog and said softly, “This demon dog’s gaze doesn’t seem to be very friendly.”

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched when she heard Ling Yan’s words. He had good eyesight… it was the Karma Bloodline clan from the upper realm who sent the dog to the lower realm. Now, Ling Yan was the only one in the lower realm who had the Karma Bloodline. How could the dog be friendly to him?

At that moment, Ye Qingtang could only pray that the dog would continue to eat the burning sun and not come down to cause trouble. Otherwise, she really did not know if she could stop it.

“This demon dog seems to have interacted with Miss Ye.” Ling Yan’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

“Yes, we did have some interactions in our era.” Ye Qingtang nodded. “I met it at the Wailing Well and it told me some information.”

“What was that information? Miss Ye, can you tell me?” Ling Yan asked.

“It’s about the upper and lower realms. However, it wasn’t clear in its description. There is a power that restrains it in this lower realm. It cannot reveal too much,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Understood.” Ling Yan nodded.

“Also, it hates you probably because of the Karma Bloodline.” Ye Qingtang pondered for a moment before continuing.

“Oh?” Ling Yan seemed to be interested. “Why?”

“In our era, it once told me that it ended up in the lower realm because it fell into a trap set by the Karma Bloodline Clan in the upper realm, so it is very hostile towards those with the Karma Bloodline,” Ye Qingtang said.

The big yellow dog had previously said very seriously that it wanted to kill all those with the Karma Bloodline. Ye Qingtang did not think that the big yellow dog was joking, so she was a little worried about Ling Yan.

“I see... the Karma Bloodline Clan in the upper realm?” Ling Yan was deep in thought after hearing Ye Qingtang’s explanation.

Ye Qingtang still wanted to say something when she suddenly saw ripples in the air around Ling Yan. In the next second, Ye Qingtang saw a cold light slashing out from the surrounding void.

“Be careful!”

Ye Qingtang instinctively shouted at Ling Yan.

However, the moment Ye Qingtang spoke, Ling Yan had already retreated quickly.

“Boom!”

A loud bang rang out.

A nearby mountain peak was shattered by this cold beam. In the next second, the Paragon walked slowly out of the void.

“Sister Ye Yue, I am here.”

The Paragon heaved a sigh of relief when she saw Ye Qingtang.

“Sister Ah Yao...”

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised to see the Paragon. She did not expect the Paragon to have continued searching for her.

Ling Yan glanced at the Paragon and walked over slowly.

The Paragon’s gaze landed on Ling Yan and she could not help being taken aback.

“Come, I’ll take you away.”

The Paragon grabbed Ye Qingtang and was about to cast her Space Technique to bring her into the void.

“Sister Ah Yao, wait a moment,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Sister Ye Yue, what’s wrong?” The Paragon stopped in her tracks and looked at Ye Qingtang in confusion.

“The Immortal Emperor who attacked us previously... is already dead.” Ye Qingtang did not know how to explain the truth to the Paragon. So she could only come up with this reason.

“Dead?”

Surprise surfaced in the Paragon’s eyes...
