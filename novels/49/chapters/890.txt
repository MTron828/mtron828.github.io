Chapter 891 The Guide

The little white tiger probed its head and extended its ears outside the cave to look over into the cave.

After a short while, the little azure dragon swaggered over and touched the little white tiger’s head with its paw. “Such a pity that you followed an idiot.”

Upon hearing the little azure dragon’s words, the little white tiger turned back and stared at the little azure dragon.

“F*ck you, thank you for pitying me. But I also pity that you followed a useless person.” The little white tiger sneered.

“Are you not convinced? I understand what does it mean by the promise of marriage, but she doesn’t. Isn’t she an idiot?” The little azure dragon smiled and said.

“Pfft! You don’t understand anything. She pretends that she does not understand the meaning so that others will feel anxious. This is called emotional intelligence,” the little white tiger said.

The little azure dragon’s lips twitched upon hearing that. It finally understood the ability of saying nonsense from the little white tiger.

“Look at how ugly you are. No female dragon will fall in love with you… Stop trying to figure out what love is. You will never need it in your life.” The little white tiger sat on the ground and stared at the little azure dragon and said.

“How dare you! I’m the top of the four Fiendcelestial Beasts! How dare you humiliate me.” The little azure dragon humphed.

“Pfft! The azure dragons are just slightly smarter. We are the best in fighting ability,” the little white tiger said proudly.

“Yes, you are a brainless idiot,” the little azure dragon said.

“You…” The little white tiger wanted to scold back, but it realized that it was a total waste of time to quarrel with the azure dragon.

“Yah, do you think… your master really likes my master?” the little white tiger asked.

The little azure dragon looked at the little white tiger as if it was staring at an idiot. “Based on Ling Yan’s personality, how could he say something like marriage if he did not like her? But I’m curious, do you think that Han Cangming likes her?”

“Han Cangming? He’s very peculiar. He can only act according to his instincts and act with strong intentions. He stays beside Ye Qingtang in order to acquire the Heart of the Demon God… I always feel that he can do anything to retrieve the heart, even if it will cost Ye Qingtang’s life…” The little white tiger scoffed.

The little azure dragon scoffed as well as it heard the little white tiger’s words.

Of course it’s like that.

Han Cangming did not have a soul or mind or feelings. He was only Ling Yan’s body that acted based on his instincts.As a body, instinct could drive him to do anything. He could use all means to achieve his goal.

However, the little azure dragon was curious about one thing: the body should have just retrieved the Heart of the Demon God from Ye Qingtang based on its instincts. He would not care about her death at all. Yet, Ye Qingtang was still alive now.

“Did anything happen to Ye Qingtang’s heart?” The little azure dragon looked at the little white tiger and asked.

“Yes, a life emerged out of the heart and wanted the two of them to be married,” the little white tiger said.

“No wonder… the guide… I think it’s the guide’s credit that Ye Qingtang’s heart was not taken away by him. That’s why she’s alive now.” The little azure dragon smiled coldly.

“You know about the guide?! Who told you about that?” The little white tiger was shocked. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I inferred that by myself,” the little azure dragon said.
