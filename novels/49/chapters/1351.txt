Chapter 1352 Traps 3

Ye Qingtang was confused as she heard the discussions from the people outside. She walked towards the door and peeped through it to take a look outside. She tried to figure out what those servant-looking people were talking about.

Ye Qingtang was more careful this time. She observed the aura on these few people secretly, trying to know their strength.

However, she was stunned as those servants had no spirit energy at all. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“That shouldn’t be the case… The spirit energy here is more intense than the Central Mainland. Unless they are born with no talent for cultivation, they should have some cultivation.” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. A radiant ball appeared behind her as she was confused with the situation.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were filled with surprise as she stared at the radiant ball.

What was going on?

How come the soul of the God of Nature also followed her here?

“I said, this world is boring.” The radiant object murmured unpleasantly. As it finished its words, the radiant object started to twist in front of Ye Qingtang.

It transformed into a three or four-year-old child after a few seconds and landed on the floor.

The child’s entire body was surrounded by halos. Though he appeared to be very innocent, his hair was totally white.

“Arh… This is really… too filthy. I really don’t even want to come to the world of the one-star constellation…” The little child scanned through everything in disgust. His expression darkened as he saw the rotten food he was stepping on. He immediately floated into midair.

“God of Nature?” Ye Qingtang stared at the corny child and asked carefully.

The God of Nature then raised his head and took a quick glance at Ye Qingtang. The disgust on his face was immediately replaced by profoundness.

“Lucky explorer, do not need to be surprised by what you see here. I am the God of Nature, and I can turn into anything I want.”

What a surprise!

Ye Qingtang stared at the profound child and could not help but want to give him a kick.

“Why are you here?” asked Ye Qingtang.

“Of course, I’m here to give you your mission,” the God of Nature said as if it was a matter of fact.

“…” Ye Qingtang was confused.

“Oh, I forgot to tell you earlier on. After you enter the world of any constellation, you need to finish the mission I give to you before you can leave the world. Of course, after you complete the mission, I will give you nebula points based on the difficulty of the mission. You can use the points to exchange for equivalent rewards in my Star Pavilion…” the God of Nature said.

Ye Qingtang was stunned by the amount of information.

“Wait…” Ye Qingtang stopped the God of Nature’s rattling.

“You said that I need to complete your mission in order to leave this world?” Ye Qingtang stared at the God of Nature and doubted what she just heard.

“Yes.” The God of Nature nodded.

“But… That’s not what you said earlier! You said that I can enter and leave any world of the constellation freely.” Ye Qingtang opened her eyes wide.

“Yes, I said that before.” The God of Nature did not find anything wrong. He lifted his hand and pointed towards the entrance of the constellation that had almost faded completely.

“Before the entrance disappears, you can enter and leave freely.”

After the God of Nature finished his words, the illusory entrance of the constellation totally disappeared.
