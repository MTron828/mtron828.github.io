Chapter 1463 Death Wish 2

No wonder…

No wonder Mo Yi gave off such a frail feeling.

Mo Yi could only repress Jiang Shun and the rest because she used the powers of the Netherworld Bloodline.

“After the Ancient Dynasty fell back then, the remaining clan members hid themselves, and only a few people remained after thousands of years. Almost the entire clan was wiped out. However, that Holy Lord of Shadows suddenly appeared in the Central Mainland back then. An elder from my clan pleaded for a life-prolonging medicine from the Holy Lord of Shadows, which prevented the complete extermination of my clan.”

The medicine contained in the medicine gourd was left behind by the Holy Lord of Shadows back then.

“When I was pregnant with you, I was worried that you would inherit the Netherworld Bloodline as well. But I can rest assured now.” Mo Yi raised her hand and touched Ye Qingtang’s head.

The Netherworld Bloodline had both advantages and disadvantages.

However, she did not hope for her own daughter to have this bloodline.

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback.

The Holy Lord of Shadows?

That medicine was given by the Holy Lord of Shadows?

The Holy Lord of Shadows came from the Second Domain and was an Undead. Perhaps, she knew many things regarding the Netherworld Bloodline, and perhaps the Holy Lord of Shadows knew about more things that could restrain the Netherworld Bloodline apart from that medicine.

If she returned to the Temple of Shadows, perhaps she could find other ways.

However, thinking about this stuff now was too early.

“Tang Tang, those people outside cannot do anything about me. If they really have the ability, I wouldn’t be able to live until this day. You can leave first.” Mo Yi persuaded. She was already elated to see her long-lost daughter.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. At such a time, she would not leave regardless of what Mo Yi said.

Mo Yi’s complexion became increasingly pale. She would not be able to sustain this barrier for long.

Then, Mo Yi coughed violently, and the defense barrier outside began to collapse.

Jiang Qin and the rest outside the door noticed the weakening of that barrier, and their eyes glistened.

The subtle sound made its way into everyone’s ears. As they watched the barrier surrounding the house disappear slowly, the smiles in their eyes deepened gradually.

“The barrier is broken! Let’s charge in!” Jiang Qin exclaimed eagerly.

Jiang Shun and the rest walked up immediately.

With a loud bang, the door suddenly burst open with a huge force. Mo Yi sat in the room and looked at these people coldly.

As long as she was still alive, she would not allow them to touch Ye Qingtang.

“Mo Yi, today is your death day!” Jiang Qin snickered as she looked at the increasingly frail Mo Yi.

Ye Qingtang suddenly moved forward and stood in front of Mo Yi.

Although she was not her biological daughter, she was very clear that Mo Yi wanted to protect her. Since she used this identity, Mo Yi was her mother.

Ye Qingtang analyzed the situation quickly. She was still unaware if her last card could protect Mo Yi.

Surprise flashed across Mo Yi’s eyes when she saw Ye Qingtang shielding her, and her eyes reddened slightly when the surprise faded.

Mo Yi had seen all the ugly sides of humans. In crises, even one’s own flesh and blood could flee for their life alone, yet her daughter was this nice…

Ye Qingtang lifted her chin slightly, and her gaze was as sharp as knives. Holding the sword across her body, she spoke coldly.

“Go over my dead body first if you want to hurt my mother.”

Since she enjoyed Mo Yi’s motherly love, she was Mo Yi’s daughter now, and she had to repay this kindness.

“Ha… Ye Qingtang, I think you have a death wish. Since you wish to die so eagerly, I will fulfill your wishes. Once I kill you, I will slay your mother.” Jiang Qin snickered as wickedness pervaded her eyes.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
