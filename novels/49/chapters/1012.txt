Chapter 1013 Prosperity (3)

“Alright.” Ye Qingtang nodded. Without giving Daoist Zijin a chance to continue speaking, a tremendous force surged to the sky and enveloped the entire hall.

Under this tremendous force, both Formidable Heavens Dynasty’s Grand Imperial Sire, Bai Kui, and Daoist Zijin shuddered as though they were being suppressed by a divine force above the heavens. Their faces paled and breathing hastened. While they were seated far away, they still lost control of their bodies and could barely blink their eyes even if they wanted to.

The gap between a Yang Lord and Yin Lord was too huge. Not mentioning a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Second Heaven and Third Heaven, even a Yin Yang Perfected Lord Sixth Heaven would not have any ability to retaliate.

“Yang… Lord…”

Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin broke out in cold sweat profusely. This was absolutely overwhelming power that they could not revolt against.

How would the two of them have thought that this young lady before them was actually the owner of the will energy released by the Third Elder, an authentic Yang Lord!

A Yang Lord who was less than twenty years old… How exactly did she do it?!

After a few breaths, Ye Qingtang finally absorbed all her Yang Lord force back.

Only then did the complexion of Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin return back to normal. They heaved a sigh of relief. Being trapped in the force of a Yang Lord was too daunting

“You are… that Yang Lord of Lin Town…” Daoist Zijin inspected Ye Qingtang with disbelief.

How old is this little girl only? She’s actually a Yang Lord?!

They had seen a Yang Lord after living so many years but had never heard of such a young one. What kind of monster was she?!

“Yes, that’s me,” Ye Qingtang said straightforwardly. “The Ye Family requires powerful figures currently. Do the two of you truly want to join the Ye Family and progress together?”

After hearing Ye Qingtang, Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin exchanged a look. How many blessings did this family clan of a small town receive to actually produce a Yang Lord!

“I am here to take a look at the Yang Lord. The Ye Family possesses a Yang Lord… It is my honor to be able to join the Ye Family.” Daoist Zijin rose and replied Ye Qingtang.

“There’s no problem with me as well. However… May I know what your plan for the future of the Ye Family is?” Grand Imperial Sire Bai Kui looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

“The first stage is to become the number one family clan of this mainland. The second stage is to leave this mainland, head to the Central Mainland, and become the first family clan there.” Ye Qingtang responded.

Now that the Dimension Wall was already broken, there was no obstruction for the powerful figures of the Central Mainland to enter this mainland. Under such an attack, the only way for the Ye Family to survive was to become stronger continuously.

Of course, Ye Qingtang did not innocently wish for the Ye Family to achieve this in such a short span of time. However, in light of the impending crisis, she had to tell her plan to these powerful figures who joined the Ye Family to let them know that the Ye Family was not merely restricted to this mainland.

Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin were stunned by Ye RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Qingtang’s words.

Make the Ye Family the number one family clan of the Central Mainland… How could this be possible…

It was said that there were legendary powerful figures of the Heavenly Venerate level in the Central Mainland…
