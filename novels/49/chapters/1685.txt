Chapter 1686: The Day Of The Challenge (3)

Jiang Yanyun glanced at Jiang Yiran. “It’s pointless to say such things now. It’s for the best if Ye Qingtang doesn’t show up today. Otherwise, with Baili Xuanyun’s character, I am afraid he won’t let her leave the arena alive.”

To be honest, Jiang Yanyun did not care much for Ye Qingtang. But after the past few days at the Island of Immortal Footsteps, and after listening to Jiang Yiran’s stories about Ye Qingtang, he felt that she was a pretty decent person.

Those Jiang family youths might be overly blunt in their statements but if one was to look at things objectively, they really didn’t know Ye Qingtang well at all. How could they feel protective toward a stranger?

“I know...” Jiang Yiran’s shoulders slumped.

“Well... shall I go to Qingtang’s room to take a look? I can stop her if she intends to come?” Jiang Yisheng hustled over.

“Okay.” Jiang Yanyun nodded.

It would be a rather big blow to the Jiang family if Ye Qingtang died in that arena.

Meanwhile, Jiang Shaobai remained silent the entire time. He just leaned against a stone pillar, with his head lowered drowsily.

Today was the first day of the challenge. The elites from the previous competition were seated high up, waiting to welcome the challengers.

Jiang Yanyun surveyed the six fighters. Apart from Baili Xuanyun, there were also the top dog Baili Xi, third-place Mu Feiruo, fourth-place Zhan Rao and seventh-place Sang Feiyu.

Amongst them, Mu Feiruo and Sang Feiyu were the only two females. Although they appeared slender and fragile, no one in the crowd underestimated them in the slightest.

“Brother Yun, who do you think will secure a spot on the top ten this year?” Jiang Yiran asked curiously.

“Baili Xi is totally peerless. No one here is his match.” Even the proud Jiang Yanyun did not dare to claim otherwise when he saw Baili Xi.

“Mu Feiruo is also very powerful. She was only slightly behind the second place candidate from the Ancient You Clan. As for Zhan Rao and Sang Feiyu, they both have very unorthodox moves. Neither of them will be easy to handle.” Jiang Yanyun held a very guarded attitude toward facing the top ten.

He wasn’t the only one. Everybody, including all the Elders from the various clans, were very vigilant toward them.

Meanwhile, the top fighters from the previous competition were already warming up and loosening up their limbs.

“My body feels all stiff after sitting down for so many days. It’s finally our turn now. Guess how many people will choose to challenge us?” The tall, strapping Zhan Rao was handsome and domineering. His thick, straight brows were set in an arrogant line.

Standing right at the end, Baili Xi’s own handsome face was expressionless. He was not looking at any one of the fighters, but was turned in the direction of the Baili Clan, focusing on that slender, pale figure. He appeared oblivious to his surroundings.

Mu Feiruo’s eyes were lowered the entire time. She also seemed indifferent to what was happening around them.

On the side, the petite and adorable Sang Feiyu beamed at Zhan Rao’s words. The two of them had always gotten on pretty well. “As much as Brother Zhan wants a bit of exercise, you still need someone to challenge you first. Don’t forget that with the change in rules this year, we have four empty spots for them to fight over this year. They may not choose to challenge us at all.”
