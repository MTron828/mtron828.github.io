Ye Qingtang’s words struck Lu Xiuwen’s mind like a bolt of lightning.

Lu Xiuwen looked up in disbelief and glared at Ye Qingtang. His eyes were full of hatred as though he wanted to swallow her down alive.

The Shangyue Fire Tripod was hidden in his room. If Ye Qingtang requested the Warden to conduct a search right now, would he not…

Lu Xiuwen broke out in a cold sweat instantly, and the luck he previously felt vanished into thin air.

Once the Shangyue Fire Tripod was found to be hidden in his room, things would not be as simple as being flogged fifty strokes. He might not even be able to enter Xuanling Sect for the rest of his life anymore!

At that instant, Lu Xiuwen finally realized what Ye Qingtang was plotting when she said those words previously. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

She was clearing his name on the surface, but in reality, she was making him pay back in his own coin by slowly leading him to limit the scope of the murderer to the disciples who participated in this mission.

He would not be able to keep the Shangyue Fire Tripod anymore, and he suffered this fifty strokes for nothing!

Lu Xiuwen had never hated someone this much. At that very instant, he really wished he could tear Ye Qingtang into pieces!

“I will send people to investigate immediately. This matter will end here for now. If the murderer is found, he will definitely be punished severely,” the Warden ordered.

After watching the drama and being shocked by the bloody fifty strokes of flogging, the disciples did not dare to speak further and quickly dispersed.

Lu Xiuwen was carried away by a few disciples, and before he left, he glared at Ye Qingtang resentfully as though his eyes were soaked in poison.

Ye Qingtang simply could not be bothered with Lu Xiuwen and immediately walked to Yun Shu’s side to support him.

“Junior Sister Ye…” Yun Shu grasped Ye Qingtang’s wrists tightly. Agitation filled his eyes. He was very aware that if not for Ye Qingtang’s timely appearance, not only would he not be able to punish Lu Xiuwen for his crime, he would even be accused of maligning a fellow disciple instead.

Ye Qingtang chuckled. Since others were present, she did not say anything and only helped Yun Shu out.

Once they exited the Disciplinary Hall, Yun Shu could not conceal his gratitude anymore.

“Junior Sister Ye, thank you for standing up for me today. If not for you, I’m afraid…”

Ye Qingtang shook her head. “Senior Brother Yun, there’s no need for formalities between us. I am clear of what Lu Xiuwen did, but it’s a pity that there is no concrete evidence for the Warden to convict him, and I could only use wits to resolve your hatred temporarily.”

Yun Shu laughed bitterly. “I really did not expect Lu Xiuwen to be so vicious and have such wild ambitions. I am to blame for not being able to see his true colors. But… where did you pick up the sword that you took out just now? I’ve never seen Lu Xiuwen use it before.”

Ye Qingtang scanned her surroundings, and after ensuring that there was no outsider present, she said softly, “I didn’t even pick up that sword. I went to Lu Xiuwen’s room to steal it before I went to the Disciplinary Hall.”

Yun Shu was stunned.

“S… steal?”

Ye Qingtang nodded. “Lu Xiuwen must have been certain enough to dare to attack you. I know that there’s no way you could win him in the Disciplinary Hall, so I made a trip to his room first. The blood on it was smeared using your blood-stained clothes as well.”

Yun Shu was completely dumbfounded. Never had he thought that Ye Qingtang would be so bold and detailed to set up this trap for Lu Xiuwen to fall in.
