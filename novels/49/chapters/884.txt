Chapter 885 How Dare You Trick Me (3)

A glint flashed across Ye You’s eyes when she heard Ling Yan.

Presently, the Bone of the True Dragon and the Feather of the Divine Phoenix had all fallen into her hands.

The Bone of the True Dragon represented the Wintry Yin Aura while the Feather of the Divine Phoenix possessed the Wintry Yang Aura, with both corresponding to the inheritance of the True Dragon and the Divine Phoenix respectively.

Now that she had obtained the Feather of the Divine Phoenix and the Bone of the True Dragon, the inheritance of the True Dragon and the Divine Phoenix would also be hers!

Then, apart from the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon which she had already obtained, she would be able to gather all three great inheritances and could become a true Domain Monarch of the First Domain just like her grandfather said…

“You have too many words.” Ye You glared at Ling Yan, and a murderous intent arose instantly.

However, before Ye You could do anything, Ling Yan slowly walked to the spring with his hands behind him as though he was taking a casual stroll in his courtyard.

“Calm down, Miss…” Ling Yan smiled faintly. “How about this? Let’s play a game.”

“Game?” Ye You stared at Ling Yan. “Oh? What game do you wish to play?”

“This game is simple.” Ling Yan replied slowly. “I will use this Feather of the Divine Phoenix and the Bone of the True Dragon to exchange for the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon you have obtained. How about that?”

Ye You’s expression changed instantly after hearing what Ling Yan said.

She did obtain the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon, but it had not even been a day since her feat. How could anyone else know about

it?!

“How do you know that I have the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon?!” As she spoke, a frightening murderous aura exuded around her. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The consequences would be dire if others knew about this. No matter what, this person had to

die!

“Miss, I don’t only know that you possess the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon… If I guessed correctly, you should be a descendant of the Jiang clan,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

“You… Who exactly are you?” Ye You’s voice was extremely cold.

“Who I am is not important.” Ling Yan shook his head and continued. “You only have two routes today. The first is to leave the inheritance of the Heavenly Demon behind… However, I’m afraid you don’t wish to know what the second route is.”

“I am curious what kind of route is the so-called second route.” Ye You stared at Ling Yan. In her eyes, this man was already a dead person.

“It is death.” Ling Yan smiled.

“You have a death wish!” Ye You hollered angrily. With the flick of her wrist, she immediately slammed a palm down at Ling Yan.

Ye You believed that given her cultivation realm, this man, who was only at Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven, would be crushed by her hit.

However, at this instant, a figure flashed by and stood before Ling Yan in an instant.

“Ye You?!”

Ye Qingtang just rushed over but saw someone wanting to kill Ling Yan. When she took a clear look of the attacker, she was taken aback that it was actually Ye You.

However, before Ye You could react, a frightening roar erupted from both the Bone of the True Dragon and the Feather of the Divine Phoenix in her hands at the same time.

In the next second, before Ye Qingtang’s surprised eyes, the left side of Ye You’s body was burning with raging flames while the right side of her body was covered in frost. At the same time, Ye You’s miserable cry reverberated in the cave.

“Ling Yan, what is going on?” Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan immediately.

Upon hearing that, Ling Yan flashed a faint smile. “Miss Ye, isn’t it very nice to watch the show here?”

“What… What is happening…” Pain filled Ye You’s face as she stimulated the primordial qi in her body. Nevertheless, the flames and frost on her body did not reduce at all.

“Miss, I clearly told you just now that from ancient times till now, almost all greedy people do not have any good outcome, but you did not listen.” Ling Yan’s lips were tugged up slightly.
