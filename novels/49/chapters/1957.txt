Chapter 1958: Pledging Allegiance (3)

As Ye Qingtang scanned the expressions on the Ancient Clan people’s faces, it wasn’t hard to make a guess.

They weren’t sure if their lives would be spared if they handed the fragments over to the Ancient You Clan, and even if they were spared, they would have to live as the Ancient You Clan’s slaves for the rest of their lives.

How were they supposed to face their ancestors and live up to the name of an “Ancient Clan”?

This was their bottom line.

In truth, the intentions of the Ancient You Clan was pretty obvious. They had sent the youths out secretly to kill off the Ancient Clans, firstly to obtain the Spirit of Chaos fragments and secondly to hone their skills.

After all, with their current strength, they could have just shown their power and gotten the Ancient Clans to hand over what they wanted. There was no need to send those youths out to massacre the Ancient Clans.

It was obvious that the other Ancient Clans meant nothing to the Ancient You Clan.

They wanted both the fragments and their lives.

“Holy Lord, my clan is willing to hand the Spirit of Chaos fragments over to the Holy Lord as well.” A person from another clan stepped forwards and declared.

It was useless for them to hold onto the fragments as it would only bring further disaster upon themselves. The only force that could oppose the Ancient You Clan now was the Temple of Shadows. Rather than surrender, it would be better for them to side with the Temple of Shadows and get themselves on the Holy Lord’s good side.

These sly old foxes had already calculated everything.

Ye Qingtang had never expected things to blow up like this.

After a short while, the Ancient Clans had all handed the fragments over to Ye Qingtang.

There were 20 to 30 people in the Temple of Shadows, and almost like clockwork, all of them handed their fragments over to Ye Qingtang.

She suddenly felt like she was holding a lot more of the fragments than the Ancient You Clan needed and was left at a loss for words.

There was nothing she could do now!

So many Ancient Clans were already pledging their allegiance before she had even thought of a plan to deal with the Ancient You Clan. With so many of them pleading with her so sincerely, she doubted that she could wriggle out of it easily now.

Besides...

After seeing little Luo Xue, she felt an even greater sense of urgency. She needed to retrieve the hearts of little You Yun and little Luo Xue.

In the end, Ye Qingtang took all of the proffered fragments. She was going to need more strength if she were to deal with the Ancient You Clan. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Once she had reassured the Ancient Clans, Ye Qingtang turned around to look at the Jiang family members she had saved.

The Domain Monarch had suffered heavy wounds. Even though he had escaped with his life, he seemed to have aged a lot and his wizened face was filled with wrinkles.

Jiang Lang and Jiang Xun’s wounds were light and they were already awake. They stood at the Domain Monarch’s bedside, looking at the worried Domain Monarch with dark expressions.

Jiang Xun was crying silently as Ye Qingtang pushed open the door in her mask.

Seeing Ye Qingtang enter, Jiang Xun and Jiang Xun stood up and looked at the “Holy Lord of Shadows” whose power they did not know.

“Greetings, Holy Lord. I will never forget your kindness!” Jiang Lang looked at Ye Qingtang and exclaimed gratefully.

Even though he had been unconscious, he had learned everything from the Domain Monarch when he woke up.

If not for the “Holy Lord of Shadows”, they would have died in the hands of the Ancient You Clan.

It was only when Ye Qingtang looked at the unharmed Jiang Lang that a weight lifted off her shoulders. She silently heaved a sigh of relief. A warm smile flashed past her eyes before she regained the cool composure of the Holy Lord of Shadows.
