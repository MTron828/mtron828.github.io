Chapter 1989: Netherworld Ring (2)

“Is there anything I can help you with, Guardian?” Ling Yan asked.

With a difficult expression on his face, Xue Fu frowned and hesitated for a moment before saying, “Now that the Central Mainland is in danger, we can only count on the Holy Lord to protect us. If Young Master Lin can make the Holy Lord happy, you have our thanks.”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang had been with Ling Yan a lot lately, he mistakenly thought that she needed him to vent her frustrations.

Ling Yan looked at Xue Fu’s sincere expression and the edges of his lips curled into a smile.

“I will be sure to service the Holy Lord as well as I can.”

Service?

Xue Fu nodded silently.

Ling Yan’s status as a ‘male pet’ was becoming more and more real.

Back in her room, Ye Qingtang had taken out all of the Holy Lord of Shadows’s Dharma artifacts and was inspecting them one at a time. She found seven to eight rings but had no idea which was the Netherworld Ring, if any at all.

Ling Yan pushed open the door. Before he could even step in, Ye Qingtang had rushed up to the door and pulled him in, shutting the door with a loud thud

Xue Fu, who was standing outside, was at a loss for words.

Holy Lord, make sure to take care of your body!

“You came at the right time. The people from the Crimson League just came and left...” She quickly summarized the events for him.

“So you’re looking for the Netherworld Ring?” Ling Yan looked at the rings laid out in front of her.

She nodded.

“Do you know what the Netherworld Ring looks like?” She felt that there was nothing in this world that Ling Yan didn’t know.

He spoke up. “Yes.”

Ye Qingtang’s heart leaped with joy.

“That’s great. Help me take a look then, and tell me which is the Netherworld Ring.”

Ling Yan glanced at the rings. “Congratulations, Miss Ye.”

“Yes?” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“The rings here are all extremely powerful.”

“I know. I’m asking you which is the Netherworld Ring.”

“It’s not here.”

“What?” Ye Qingtang was startled.

Ling Yan repeated, “The Netherworld Ring isn’t here.”

Ye Qingtang was speechless before she withered instantly in despair.

“You’re telling me that the Netherworld Ring isn’t here?”

Ling Yan nodded and said, “The aura of death around the Netherworld Ring is strong and just a light touch will make you feel extremely cold.”

With that, he placed the rings into her hands one by one to let her feel them.

None of them felt like the Netherworld Ring.

“So it’s not here...” Ye Qingtang’s head was starting to hurt.

“The Holy Lord of Shadows might have taken the Netherworld Ring,” Ling Yan suggested.

Resting her chin on one hand, Ye Qingtang could only sigh. She had wanted to stir up some trouble between the Crimson League and the Ancient You Clan so that they would deal with the threat but now...

Now that the Netherworld Ring was gone, the Crimson League was unlikely to help them.

Seeing her disappointed expression, Ling Yan was about to speak up when her eyes suddenly lit up and she quickly looked to him. He laughed as she fixed him with her bright eyes.

“Miss Ye, I won’t be able to restrain myself if you look at me like this.”

Ye Qingtang had no time to deal with his antics at the moment and quickly grabbed his hand, asking, “So you know what the Netherworld Ring looks like?”

Looking at his hand in hers, Ling Yan nodded silently.

“Draw it. Draw it right now.” Ye Qingtang dragged him over to a table and pushed him down, handing him a piece of paper.
