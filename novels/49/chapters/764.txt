Chapter 765 Inter-Disciples Learning (3)

Liu Mo’s skills were considered to tower above those of other disciples in Falling Sky Valley, and he had a detached and proud nature.

But in reality, Liu Mo was a beast in human skin.

While he had the appearance of a decent human, he was a complete lecher in reality. He made use of his title as Water Cut Peak’s top disciple to disrespect many female disciples in Falling Sky Valley, and they could only swallow their anger silently given Liu Mo’s position and skills.

In her previous life, Liu Mo once tried to make a move on Ye Qingtang, but her senior brothers and sisters happened to see it and joined forces against Liu Mo. Although Ye Qingtang was able to escape, her senior brothers and sisters were severely injured because of it.

Ye Qingtang looked at Liu Mo coldly.

She had not made time to find him, but he sent himself here instead.

“Ye Chen, we meet again.” Li Jingwen looked straight at Ye Qingtang maliciously as he exploited Liu Mo’s might to intimate others.

Ye Qingtang swept a cold glance at Li Jingwen’s twisted face without any emotions on her face. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Ye Chen, don’t you like inter-disciple learning? Senior Brother Liu happened to be free today. How about you all learn from each other?” Li Jingwen laughed.

Yin Qingluo and Ye Ningxi frowned immediately. A group of Admirable Sky Peak disciples came over asking for answers, and caution emerged in their eyes when they saw Li Jingwen and Liu Mo, who came to cause trouble.

“Li Jingwen, when did my Junior Brother Ye say that he wanted to have an inter-disciple learning session with Senior Brother Liu?” Ye Ningxi snickered coldly.

Li Jingwen said with a smile, “Junior Sister Ye, why are you so agitated? In Falling Sky Valley, it’s a normal thing for disciples to learn from each other. Senior Brother Liu rarely has time today and is willing to give you pointers. This is Junior Brother Ye’s blessing. In the entire Falling Sky Valley, how many disciples can match Senior Brother Liu’s skills? If Junior Brother Ye can gain a few pointers from Senior Brother Liu, it would naturally be a blessing he cultivated from his previous life.”

Li Jingwen spoke frankly and freely, implying that Ye Qingtang stood a huge bargain from learning with Liu Mo.

Liu Mo looked scornfully at Ye Qingtang, who was being blocked behind by Yin Qingluo and Ye Ningxi. “Junior Brother Ye, we are just having an inter-disciple learning session. Could it be that you don’t even have the guts to do so?”

“If you don’t have the guts, I will not force you either. However, since I’ve come to Admirable Sky Peak, I cannot return empty-handed. If you don’t agree to this match, you can invite your Eldest Senior Brother, Gu Yihan, out.” Liu Mo replied.

In the entire Admirable Sky Peak, the only disciple he could bother with was Gu Yihan.

Moreover, after Perfected Xuanchen became the Valley Master, Perfected Xuanchen had the intention of nurturing Gu Yihan as the next Peak Master of Admirable Sky Peak. If Liu Mo defeated Gu Yihan, all the disciples in Admirable Sky Peak would be trampled by him unquestionably.

Liu Mo’s purpose for coming today was to beat Ye Qingtang up and assert his dominance.

Yin Qingluo and Ye Ningxi had a serious expression as they were clearly of Liu Mo’s intention.

In terms of skills, Liu Mo was slightly stronger than Gu Yihan.

However, Gu Yihan obeyed his Master’s orders strictly, and even if he came today, he would probably not use all his force in consideration of the big picture.

Yet, when facing Liu Mo, Gu Yihan only had the option of suffering a tragic defeat as long as he restrained his strength.
