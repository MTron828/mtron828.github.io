That Demon Subduing Pagoda was over ten feet tall with an imposing aura that filled the air.

Ye Qingtang was taken aback by this look.

“That is… Master’s Demon Subduing Pagoda?!”

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang was once saved by Perfected Xuanchen of Nine Nights Dynasty and brought to cultivate in Falling Sky Valley. That Demon Subduing Pagoda was one of Perfected Xuanchen’s dharma treasures which could subdue all evil beings, and Ye Qingtang had once seen it before.

“This is strange. Master once said that his Demon Subduing Pagoda was handed to his favorite disciple… Afterward, that disciple was killed, and the Demon Subduing Pagoda ended up in Yunxiao Sect’s hands…” Ye Qingtang’s brows were furrowed as she pondered.

The Demon Subduing Pagoda was in Yunxiao Sect’s hands for very long, until a long time later when Perfected Xuanchen killed a Yunxiao Sect elder and got the Demon Subduing Pagoda back.

“Why would I see Master’s Demon Subduing Pagoda here…” Ye Qingtang’s expression was serious. After thinking for a long while, she ultimately decided to check.

Kilometers away.

Two young males were exuding a frightening air which stirred gusts of winds that swept the surrounding area.

One of the males was wearing a long black robe, and there was a golden embroidery of the word “valley” on the chest while the other person was a Yunxiao Sect disciple.

“Hah. Ji Yixuan, disciple of Perfected Xuanchen in Nine Nights Dynasty, I did not think that I would actually meet you here.” The Yunxiao Sect disciple sneered at the teen in the black robe.

At that instant, the youth in the black robe waved his right arm, and the tall Demon Subduing Pagoda shrank immediately and fell into his hand.

“You are the disciple of Yunxiao Sect Sect Master, Yue Tiancheng?” The male in the black robe had an aloof expression as he sized up the youth before him. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“That’s me.” Yue Tiancheng laughed. “Ji Yixuan, why are you not in Nine Nights Dynasty but here in Formidable Heavens Dynasty?”

“It has nothing to do with you.” Ji Yixuan replied.

Upon hearing that, a cold glint flashed across Yue Tiancheng’s eyes. “Hah. Ji Yixuan, Falling Sky Valley and Yunxiao Sect are mortal enemies. Now that you’ve stepped into the Formidable Heavens Dynasty, you are courting your own death.”

“Oh?” Ji Yixuan said with indifference. “Our skills are similar, and Master granted me the dharma treasure, Demon Subduing Pagoda, for this trip to the Formidable Heavens Dynasty. I wonder which one of us will die today.”

Then, the Demon Subduing Pagoda in his hands turned swiftly. It let out a horrifying sound, and thunder emerged around it.

Ji Yixuan waved his right arm, and a palm print was formed from his palms. Instantly, the Demon Subduing Pagoda elongated and turned to be over ten meters tall which suppressed Yue Tiancheng.

“This dharma treasure is indeed powerful.” After being forced backward ten or so steps by the Demon Subduing Pagoda, Yue Tiancheng suddenly stopped and took out a talisman.

“Go!”

Then, Yue Tiancheng threw the talisman out.

In a second, the talisman started burning and eventually turned into a golden light once it was completely burnt.

“Array formation in a talisman?!”

After noticing the situation, Ji Yixuan’s expression changed slightly.

The more powerful the array formation was, the longer it took to set the array, and top array formations needed at least months to finish setting up.

However, Yue Tiancheng sealed the array formation in the talisman in advance, which could achieve the effect immediately!

Golden light cast from the sky immediately and shrouded over the Demon Subduing Pagoda.

Boom!

Boom!

Boom, boom!!

The huge Demon Subduing Pagoda was wildly attacked in the golden light, where the sounds of contact were frightening.

Nonetheless, Yue Tiancheng’s array formation was extremely brilliant, and the Demon Subduing Pagoda could not escape it.

“Worldly Self-Illusion!”

With an indifferent expression, Ji Yixuan immediately manifested another him.

At that moment, there were two Ji Yixuans standing side by side.
