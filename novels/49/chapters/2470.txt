The demons looked at each other. One of them scratched its head. Was it seeing things?

But surely they couldn’t have possibly seen the same thing together.

“No, we have to report this matter!” one of the demons exclaimed.

...

Meanwhile, Ye Qingtang, Lu Yuanxiang and the rest had entered the ancestral temple and closed the door again.

Sculptures of demons were everywhere. The statues were huge and the workmanship was extremely meticulous and lifelike.

“Is this Demon Emperor Yongle?” Jing Ze stared at a demon statue in the middle and asked softly.

The big yellow dog wagged its tail and squatted beside Ye Qingtang. It seemed to have no interest in the sculptures of these demons.

“I think so.” The Flying Star Academy teacher observed the statue for a moment and nodded.

The demon sculpture in the center was extremely imposing. It stood with its hands behind its back, as if it was standing on the clouds and looking down on the common people.

“Yun Chen, place the powder of the elixir on the edge of the door and ensure that it will fall once the door is opened,” Ye Qingtang instructed Yun Chen.

Yun Chen immediately agreed and followed Ye Qing’s instructions. After everything was prepared, they hid behind the statue.

“Wait. The statue in front of me seems to be Demon Emperor Yongle!” The Flying Star Academy teacher was dazed. He did not want to pretend to be a Demonic Emperor Yongle. He would much rather be a quiet follower!

“Teacher Ye Qing, let’s swap. I’ll pretend to be a follower while you pretend to be Demon Emperor Yongle!” The Flying Star Academy teacher looked at Ye Qing anxiously.

Ye Qing was the one who thought of the plan. They were following Ye Qing’s instructions and so he should be the one to impersonate Demon Emperor Yongle.

“Don’t move… those demons may come in at any time,” Ye Qingtang said to the Flying Star Academy teacher.

“Teacher Lu, quick, let’s change. Your aura is more like Demon Emperor Yongle’s than mine!” Seeing that Ye Qing did not agree, the Flying Star Academy teacher looked at Lu Yuanxiang.

“No need. My aura is not as strong as yours. I will be your follower and the Demon Emperor will be yours.” Lu Yuanxiang rejected him without any hesitation.

Everyone knew that Demon Emperor Yongle was a hot potato. Noone was willing to step up to pretend to be Demon Emperor Yongle.

Still the Flying Star Academy teacher had yet to give up. His gaze fell onto Qin Feng and the others. However, Qin Feng and the others simply turned around and did not look at the Flying Star Academy teacher.

The Flying Star Academy teacher’s lips twitched. What was the meaning of this?

Meanwhile, outside the ancestral temple.

The high-level demons of the Yongle Tribe finally arrived. The Yongle Tribe’s flag fluttered in the wind, looking extraordinarily magnificent.

“Report!”

Seeing that the higher-ups had arrived, the three demons responsible for guarding the ancestral temple immediately rushed forward.

“What? Enemies are invading?”

Seeing the demons in front of it in a panic, one of the burly demons frowned and asked.

“No… No, Great Demon Han, the three of us just saw a miracle!” The first demon guard said excitedly.

“A miracle?”

All the demons bore strange expressions.

“We saw Demon Emperor Yongle just now. He stepped on a cloud… and disappeared in a flash!”

“What did you say!”

Han’s expression changed. They saw Demon Emperor Yongle!!

“That’s right. The three of us saw it together. It can’t be wrong. However, we don’t know where it went. It disappeared instantly.. It’s like a dream. Could it be that Demon Emperor Yongle is returning?”
