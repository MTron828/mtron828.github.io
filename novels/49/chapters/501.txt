Chapter 502 Stirring Things Up (3)

Helpless, the Blood Moon Sect Elder could only follow Ye

Qingtang.

About an hour later, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon

Sect Elder arrived near a valley.

Hundreds of meters away, a male teen had a pale complexion and appeared extremely frail. Sitting in front of that teen was the Yunxiao Sect elder.

“Li Jiwu!” A cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw the injured teen.

In her previous life, Li Jiwu was one of Ye You’s trusted subordinates. After Nine Nights Dynasty was destructed,

Li Jiwu followed Ye You into Falling Sky Valley and killed many of her senior and junior brothers and sisters!

Then, Ye Qingtang took out the black sword from her space ring.

This black sword belonged to Yunxiao Sect Sect Master’s disciple, Yue Tiancheng.

After killing Yue Tiancheng that day, this sword became her spoils of war.

Apart from the black sword, Ye Qingtang also took out a talisman from her space ring.

“Array Formation in a talisman?” The Blood Moon Sect

Elder looked askance at the talisman in Ye Qingtang’s hand. “From the level of this array formation in a talisman, it is at least from a Yunxiao Sect elder or Sect Master.

However, it is so much lousier than mine.”

As though she could no longer tolerate the Blood Moon

Sect Elder’s nagging, she stretched a hand out towards the Blood Moon Sect Elder with an annoyed expression.

“What are you doing?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder was

confused.

“Give me your higher level Array Formation in a talisman,’ Ye Qingtang said.

“How would I have it!” The Blood Moon Sect Elder shook his head.

“You don’t have it?” Ye Qingtang laughed in frustration towards the Blood Moon Sect Elder. “You don’t have it, yet you have been rattling away on and on?”

Ye Qingtang no longer bothered with him and combined the talisman and Yue Tiancheng’s black sword together.

Right after, Ye Qingtang condensed all her primordial qi.

Swoosh!

A sharp sound pierced the air as the black sword was tossed towards Li Jiwu.

At the same time, the Yunxiao Sect elder beside Li Jiwu opened his eyes suddenly. There was a cold glint in his eyes as he looked towards the black sword that was as fast as an arrow.

“Which impudent person is it!” The Yunxiao Sect elder hollered furiously, and it was as though the air came toa still.

Then, the Yunxiao Sect elder lifted his right arm and grabbed the black sword.

However…

The talisman on the sword suddenly burned on its own.

In an instant, the black sword seemed to hide in the void, disappearing right before his eyes.

The Yunxiao Sect elder’s expression changed immediately, and he was in disbelief. “Array Formation in a talisman… This is… the Concealed Breath Spell?!”

Apart from concealing one’s breath, the supposed Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Concealed Breath Spell could even allow one to achieve invisibility for a short time.

Poof!

Before the Yunxiao Sect elder could react, the black sword appeared once again, but it had already pierced through Li Jiwu’s chest.

Li Jiwu widened his eyes in disbelief as he looked at his chest in aghast.

There was a crimson hole in his chest at the place where his heart was pierced through together.

“Ow…”

Large gushes of blood were spat out from Li Jiwu’s mouth, dyeing the entire floor into a bright red.

“Jiwu!” The Yunxiao Sect elder clutched onto Li Jiwu, grief-stricken.

Li Jiwu’s was extremely talented in martial skills and had been the Yunxiao Sect Elder’s disciple since young when he cultivated beside him. Never had the Yunxiao Sect

Elder expected that…

Li Jiwu’s lips moved a little and parted, wanting to say something, but only blood surged out of his mouth.

Eventually, Li Jiwu moved for a moment and died.
