Chapter 1926: The Eight Tribe Leaders (2)

Ming Wang lifted his eyes and gazed at the tribe leaders.

The eight tribe leaders believed in the mighty powers of the Holy Lord of Shadows. Since the Holy Lord went missing ten thousand years ago, the interactions between tribe leaders and the Temple of Shadows dropped significantly. Without the Holy Lord around, the temple was unable to keep the eight tribe leaders in line.

Even though he was the Holy Son of Shadows, this status alone was still not enough to stand up to the eight tribe leaders.

“We will let you know if the Holy Lord of Shadows has any orders for you,” Ming Wang said in a low voice. He would not tolerate any doubt toward the Holy Lord.

Without waiting for a response from the eight tribe leaders, Ming Wang got up. “I will report your request to meet with the Holy Lord. Meanwhile, just await her orders.”

With that, Ming Wang turned and left.

The eight tribe leaders stared after Ming Wang’s departing figure with dark expressions.

“That Ming Wang is nothing without the Holy Lord.” The Demon Tribe Leader sneered.

“No need to care about him. With the trouble brewing in the Central Mainland now, the Holy Lord will make the necessary arrangements. If not... I’m afraid this is not in line with the Holy Lord’s character,” the Goblin Tribe Leader said pointedly.

It was not a coincidence that the eight tribe leaders had all gathered here today.

If the Holy Lord was genuine, they would naturally be satisfied and go along with everything. If not... they would never let off this imposter.

...

Upon hearing that the eight tribe leaders had come, Ye Qingtang gave an inward sigh.

It was really... one wave of trouble after another.

Although the eight tribe leaders appeared very humble and respectful, Ye Qingtang could feel that they were not completely convinced of her identity.

If they had openly shown their doubts, Ye Qingtang could have immediately taken offense and punished all of them.

But they were too politically correct and as much as Ye Qingtang wanted to pinpoint some flaws in their behavior, she could find no concrete basis to do so.

But now...

Ye Qingtang turned slightly toward the gigantic Ming Di behind her.

“Those kids are still alive?” Ming Di didn’t even bat an eyelid.

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

Kids?!

Did Ming Di not know the definition of the word “kid”?

“It’s been a long time since Ming Di and I have seen them. Just let them come,” Ye Qingtang immediately ordered.

Ming Wang glanced at Ming Di before turning to leave.

Meanwhile, Ming Di picked up a burly demon with its massive claws and popped it into its mouth. Loud crunching noises ensued. “If you hadn’t stopped me then, I would have already swallowed that fellow.”

“Who?” Ye Qingtang was momentarily confused. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lifting one gigantic claw, Ming Di pointed in the direction where Ming Wang had disappeared.

Ye Qingtang, “...”

Are you really that bloodthirsty that you would even swallow your own people?

“I heard that it is very rare for the Undead Clan to have twins. I have never tasted one before. I say... Mo Yao, you promised me that after this Central Mainland situation is resolved, you will return to the Second Domain with me and help me capture a pair of undead twins so that I can have a taste. I have waited for so long now. After I finish off everyone in Central Mainland... if you can’t find another pair of twins then... don’t blame me for helping myself here.” Ming Di smirked, revealing rows of sharp teeth.

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly.

No wonder she felt that Ming Wang was always looking at Ming Di with such a strange expression.

It must be that... Ming Di wanted to devour Ming Wang?

Ye Qingtang finally understood. No matter what Ming Di felt towards the Holy Lord, it placed the lives of others in complete disregard. Even with the other people in the Temple of Shadows, it felt no sense of kinship to any one of them at all.
