1200 Blood Battle 2

Several peak Yang Lords from the Ancient You Clan were turned into ash along with Elder Bai Kui.

Ye Qingtang was left in a trance at this moment.

The scene where Elder Bai Kui first came to Ye Family appeared in her mind…

Making use of Ye Qingtang’s daze, a few Yang Lords exchanged a look and immediately charged towards Ye Qingtang.

Nonetheless, in just a moment, Ye Qingtang turned into a black flame and devoured those Yang Lords instead.

…

In the dark night, there was the glow of fire in the valley.

The Ye Family masses screamed, roared, gritted their teeth, and were enraged.

In this hell-like battlefield, their life or death no longer seemed to matter.

Many of those Ye Family siblings, whom they spent much time with and went through thick and thin together, had lost their lives in their last resistance.

Every drop of blood drove the Ye Family masses even more insane. Anger and hatred blinded their rationality; the weapons in their hands never rested as they drank more blood greedily.

In Heaven City.

The Blood Moon Elder’s eyes were devoid of emotions when he saw the uninvited guest before him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The person was a middle-aged man. His long, jet-black hair swayed in the wind, and he had an antique long saber hung on his waist.

The middle-aged man looked at Blood Moon Elder with a seeming smile. “Elder Yin Fo, good job. Hand the kid with the reincarnation of the Spiritual Abode to me.”

“Hand her to you?”

The Blood Moon Elder snickered suddenly. “Are you dreaming?”

The devilish smile on that man’s face did not fade even upon hearing that. “Oh… In that case, have you really sided with this mainland already?”

Without waiting for Blood Moon Elder to speak, the middle-aged man shook his head and said, “Elder Yin Fo, as an alien race raised by Ancient You Clan, your mission is to stay loyal to Ancient You Clan until you die. However, you sided with the enemy and are fighting on the same front as the ants of this lowly mainland. How disappointing… The Ancient You Clan is so disappointed…”

“Hahaha, I think that you’re tired of living. I was still worried about not being able to enter the battlefield… but you came knocking on my door on your own accord…” Afterward, a glint flashed across the Blood Moon Elder’s eyes. He raised his right shoulder, and his mountain-like fist swung towards the middle-aged man violently.

The power of this punch raked up wild gusts of wind instantly, and even a mountain would completely crumble under this force.

The middle-aged man held the long saber on his waist gently. Subsequently, there was a sound of a sword being unsheathed, and a gleam flashed by.

In the next second, under the Blood Moon Elder’s stunned gaze, blood was spouting out of his fist like a fountain.

The Blood Moon Elder retreated backward as his right shoulder trembled violently.

“Haha.”

The middle-aged man looked at Blood Moon Elder and chuckled. “Elder Yin Fo, the one hundred elders in the Ancient You Clan are ranked according to their skills. You are only ranked sixty while I am ranked twenty. From where did you… find the courage to fight me?”

Before the Blood Moon Elder spoke, the middle-aged man continued speaking. “Come, hand those two kids to me. I can consider sparing your life. After all, our comradeship has not disappeared completely yet.”

“Hahaha, how delusional of you!” The Blood Moon Elder chortled loudly. Suddenly, he grabbed Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue and fled the city.
