Chapter 790 A Fierce Struggle (4)

Qin Long had holden control over the Nine Nights Dynasty’s military for a long time, and even if the city’s garrison was not enough, he had already moved the 100,000 troops stationed outside the monarch city!

Ye Qingtang slashed numerous people. Seeing that more and more garrison troops rushed over continuously, her eyes passed by everyone and looked straight at Qin Long, who commanded the troops at the back.

In an instant, Ye Qingtang leaped past everyone and headed straight to where Qin Long was at!

Qin Long was alarmed to see Ye Qingtang flying towards him.

The powerful figures near Qin Long charged forward immediately.

All of them were at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, and one of them was already at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three.

These people were roped in by Qin Long with great effort. In the battle earlier on, they did not attack and remained near Qin Long to protect his safety

Now that they saw Ye Qingtang flying towards them, they immediately joined forces and attacked directly.

However…

A glint flashed by Ye Qingtang’s eyes, and a soaring inner qi erupted around her. With the flick of her wrist, she slashed across her surroundings.

Before touching the corner of Ye Qingtang’s clothes, those Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three figures were beheaded by Ye Qingtang in a second.

The Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three figure was the only person remaining. His complexion was pale, and terror flashed across his eyes as he looked at Ye Qingtang, who resembled a fierce tiger that sprang down the mountain.

“Half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord…” That powerful figure retreated a step out of fear.

Qin Long never said that the enemy was a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord when he came just now!

Although this powerful figure was roped in by Qin Long, how did he dare to continue fighting a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?

How would a person focused on power and influence like Qin Long understand the true might of a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?

Then, that powerful figure immediately stopped and said respectfully to Ye Qingtang with cupped fists, “Please do not take offense for offending you today. Sorry for bothering you. I’ll take my leave first.” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Then, without daring to stay any longer, that powerful figure immediately left Qin Long behind and fled away.

Qin Long could just die on his own and not pull him along.

How could he fight a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?

A half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord could easily slaughter Qin Long from the crowd even if another 100,000 troops came.

Qin Long watched in disbelief as his strongest associate threw him behind and escaped by himself!

Before Qin Long could recover from his fury, Ye Qingtang had already arrived before him. The guards beside him simply could not bear a blow from Ye Qingtang, whose overbearing air caused them to fall to the ground and tremble.

Qin Long looked up and met Ye Qingtang’s cold eyes. Shaken, he instinctively took a step back.

“In… Insolent… I am Nine Nights Dynasty’s premier. Do you dare to hurt me! If you hurt me, the entire Nine Nights Dynasty will definitely not let you off!” Qin Long’s ruthless manner was already gone, and he could only put on a calm front.

Ye Qingtang looked at Qin Long indifferently with eyes devoid of emotions.

If she released Qin Long now, he would definitely use all the power he held in Nine Nights Dynasty to take her life, but if Qin Long died, the people in Nine Nights Dynasty would only make use of the opportunity to scramble for the power he left behind. Who would still look for her?

Qin Long had committed too much evil over these years, and no one would avenge him even if he died.
