Chapter 1894: Breakthrough (3)

What surprised Jiang Shaobai even more was...

The aura surrounding Ye Qingtang hadn’t dissipated even after her first breakthrough, she seemed to have another breakthrough coming!

...

Ye Qingtang was unconscious for quite some time and when she finally woke up, she opened her eyes to see Little White Tiger and Jiang Shaobai both asleep beside her.

The youth’s face was pale and though he was asleep, he seemed to be troubled by something, having furrowed brows even during his rest.

When Ye Qingtang wanted to sit up, she felt as though her bones had been broken and healed. She felt sore all over, even her clothes were soaking wet, as though she had just come out of a pool of water.

What happened?

It took her some effort to sit up. Though she was sore all over and the pain was quite unbearable, she felt strangely rejuvenated.

“Er...” Awakened by her movement, Jiang Shaobai slowly opened his eyes.

When he saw that Ye Qingtang could sit up, there was a glint of excitement in his eyes as he stood up in one swift movement.

“Sister Qing, you’re finally awake!”

Ye Qingtang nodded. “How long was I asleep?”

“Almost 2 weeks,” Jiang Shaobai replied.

“...” F*ck!

Was she a pig?

Ye Qingtang was dumbstruck.

Her last memories stopped when they left the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm with Baili Xi. She seemed to have no existing memories of anything after that. All she could remember was the gleaming spots as well as the warm blue lights that surrounded her.

“Sister Qing, I’ll get you something to eat.” When Jiang Shaobai saw that Ye Qingtang was finally awake, he was delighted. Without her even mentioning anything, he ran out to get some food for her.

Although it had been two weeks, Ye Qingtang didn’t feel hungry, nor was she thirsty. It felt as though she had just taken a nap and other than the soreness in her body, she didn’t feel any abnormalities.

She tried to get up from the bed but when she pulled the blanket, she woke Little White Tiger up.

Little White Tiger raised its eyes, looking at Ye Qingtang and the corners of its mouth twitched.

“...” What kind of expression is that?

“You’re finally awake. I thought that you weren’t going to wake up forever if you took any longer.” Little White Tiger stretched its body before jumping off the bed.

“I have no idea why I slept for so long either.”

Little White Tiger was stunned.

“You have no idea?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Little White Tiger looked at Ye Qingtang with a suspicious gaze. “Does your body feel different?”

Ye Qingtang couldn’t understand why Little White Tiger asked her that. She lowered her eyes, only noticing her soaking wet clothes and nothing else was different.

She hadn’t grown an extra hand.

The corners of the Little White Tiger’s mouth twitched again. “Check your powers.”

Ye Qingtang was perplexed, but she continued to check the powers within her body. She was completely astonished by the results.

What the hell!

What the heck happened?

Seeing Ye Qingtang’s shocked expression, Little White Tiger said, “You’re the first in the world to increase your level by just sleeping. This is strange. I only saw you absorbing the energy from the spirit stones in the mystic realm, you did nothing else and yet... you achieved breakthrough this quickly.”

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. “Actually... those spirit stones are composed of spirit energy from the fat catfishes...”

“...” Little White Tiger’s eyes almost popped out hearing that.

“What did you just say?!”
