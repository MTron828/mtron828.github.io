Chapter 2108: Sea Clan (2)

The Sea King controlled the sea clan of the two domains. If the Sea Clan were able to live on land, they would be one of the largest clans in the Second Domain.

The Temple of Paragon was situated on the peak of a mountain and did not have much to do with the Sea Clan. However, the Holy Lord came into contact with the Sea King due to various reasons.

One wielded immense power over the oceans of both domains while the other had control over the greatest forces in the Second Domain. They couldn’t give way to one another.

However, neither of them was keen on starting a fight. They suddenly came up with an idea to have a bet, and the outcome...

The Holy Lord of the Temple of Paragon won.

The Sea King stood by his promise and handed one divine item of the Sea Clan to the Holy Lord. After that, the Sea Clan and Temple of Paragon no longer had anything to do with one another.

“The divine item from the Sea Clan is still in the Temple of Paragon. The Sea King suddenly released the Sea King Token, could it have something to do with the divine item?” Elder Yu spoke up.

“Of course,” the Fox Demon answered.

“The Sea King took a wrong move and lost the bet. I believe that he must feel indignant about it.”

“Is there any news from the Sea King in the Sea King Token?” Elder Bai asked.

The Fox Demon nodded. “It’s the Holy Lord’s birthday in seven days. The Sea King claims that he wants to personally come and convey his well wishes.”

Everyone was taken aback by the Fox Demon’s words.

“What? The Sea King wants to come?”

“Yes, that is what is conveyed in the Sea King Token. Since he released the Sea King Token, I’m sure he will stand by it.” The Fox Demon nodded. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Their faces darkened.

When did the Sea King become this sociable? All this time he refused to have anything to do with the Temple of Paragon when he lost the bet back then.

Tens of thousands of years had passed and he suddenly wanted to convey his well wishes for the Holy Lord’s birthday?

His intentions were obvious.

“Only the seniors of the Temple of Paragon know about the Holy Lord’s death. All these years, we’ve kept mum and told everyone that the Holy Lord went into seclusion to cultivate. The Sea King might have realized something was off so he came up with his idea,” the Fox Demon explained with narrowed eyes.

The Holy Lord’s death was the greatest secret of the Temple of Paragon. Other than the Elders, only the Guardians and a few of their trusted ones knew about it.

Thankfully, the Temple of Paragon had been low-key all along so the Holy Lord’s seclusion wasn’t surprising and no one suspected a thing.

“How did the Sea King even realize? We haven’t been in touch with them in a very long time.” Elder Hua was puzzled.

“Have you forgotten that our Holy Lord had a promise with the Sea King?”

Elder Hua was stunned.

“The Sea King made himself clear when he handed the divine item to our Holy Lord that the highest authority of the Sea Clan would need to re-activate the divine item after a certain period of time passed. The Holy Lord agreed to his request and that she would invite the Sea King over when needed. If I’m not wrong, we’re six months over the agreed date,” the Fox Demon said with narrowed eyes.

The Holy Lord kept to all her promises, but this time, she had missed the agreed date.

And they were six months late...

The Sea King might have started suspecting them six months ago...

“You’re saying that the Sea King already started suspecting that our Holy Lord is no longer alive?” Elder Bai asked.
