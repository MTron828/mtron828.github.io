Chapter 968 Another Incident (3)

“Very well.” Ye Qingtang did not say much, but she guessed her father’s intentions.

After all, her father meant well.

“I think that Dan Yifan can handle the match alone tomorrow, but it would be good if the rest can go along and watch. Perhaps they can learn something.” Third Elder looked at the younger members of the Ye Family as he spoke.

Dan Yifan’s abilities were far superior to that of an ordinary person. It was a pity that he could not stay long with the Ye Family. If they could take the opportunity tomorrow to suppress the Duan Family and also allow others to pick up a move or two, that would be greatly beneficial.

“Yifan, you should rest since you just arrived,” said the Great Elder.

“Yes.” Dan Yifan bowed slightly.

However, the younger members of the Ye Family all looked eagerly at Dan Yifan, their expressions clearly expectant.

They longed to learn more from Dan Yifan, but since the Great Elder was present, they could not speak out.

“If there is anything you want to ask, you can come to my room after dinner.” Dan Yifan had noticed everyone’s expressions, and he spoke smilingly.

Everyone brightened at these words.

The Great Elder could not help but laugh and shake his head, but his eyes revealed his self-confidence.

Of course his grandson was outstanding.

Ye Qingtang did not react at all as she saw the admiring crowd cluster around the departing Dan Yifan.

“Tang Tang, you…” Ye Ling almost wanted to counsel Ye Qingtang to ask Dan Yifan for some pointers.

But Ye Qingtang said, “Father, I am rather tired. I’ll go and rest now.”

Ye Ling could think of nothing to say. He could only nod in concern.

Ye Qingtang immediately sneaked off.

The Great Elder and Third Elder silently shook their heads as they looked at Ye Qingtang’s departing figure. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Although martial arts practitioners had their pride, they should not be ashamed to ask for help.

Dan Yifan had repeatedly tried to help Ye Qingtang, but Ye Qingtang had rejected him again and again. They did not know if it was because she could not bear to lower herself from her status as Eldest Young Lady.

They were displeased with her attitude.

“Master, the Eldest Young Lady should change her attitude. Yifan will not be with the Ye Family for long. If she doesn’t grasp the opportunity to learn some pointers, it will be too late by the time she returns to the sect.” Third Elder counseled tactfully. Everyone knew that within the sects, there was a great divide between inner and outer sects.

Ye Ling was helpless, but he inwardly respected Ye Qingtang’s wishes and did not say anything

The moments slipped past, and before they knew it, it was the dawn of the next day.

This was the day of the match between the Duan Family and the Ye Family.

Dan Yifan was ready early in the morning. As the younger members of the Ye Family crowded admiringly around him, he walked out of the Ye House’s main gate and towards the location of the match.

Ye Qingtang followed behind at a moderate pace. After a short while, they arrived at the Lin Town arena.

Someone had leaked the news. Although it was early in the morning, the arena where the match was to take place was already crowded with many Lin Town citizens. Many people craned their necks and looked around them, as if waiting eagerly for a good show.

The accord between the three main families of Lin Town had been disrupted by the arrival of the Long Family.

The original three main families had declined under the Long Family’s oppression.

Only the Duan Family that had earlier sought refuge with the Long Family was still robust. Even their disciples had received many benefits.

“That’s strange. Why has the Ye Family dared to take up the Duan Family’s challenge?”

“Who knows? I heard recently that the Duan Family brought the fight to the Ye House, but none of the younger members of the Ye Family could compete with them. Who knows what has happened for the Ye Family to suddenly steel itself?”
