Chapter 1497 Big Demon 3

The moment the Dharma Blocking Barrier came into effect, everyone despaired.

The demon clearly wanted to trap and kill them all here!

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She had intended to flee for some distance, and then use the talisman that Mo Yi had left her to try escaping with Jiang Xun.

But the moment the Dharma Blocking Barrier was activated, the talisman became useless…

The others had realized this point as well. Everyone had an ugly expression as they looked at the fog that spanned across a hundred miles.

“It won’t let any of us off.” Jiang Shangyu frowned deeply. As he looked at the chaotic scene, he flew upwards and slowly drew closer to the big demon. The big demon had left a trail of flattened vegetation and mountains in its wake. Blood seeped out from beneath the mud. Who knew how many creatures had been trodden into the ground by the big demon?

At that moment, all the demon kings had terrible expressions. They had intended to enjoy the big demons’ treasures after battling the humans and alien races.

Who would have thought… that they would soon become mere pieces of food in the big demon’s stomach.

“We’ll all be dead if we continue fleeing like that. The big demon clearly does not intend to let us live. Why don’t we fight? Perhaps this will give us a chance of survival.” The person in the Ancient You Clan’s golden carriage spoke once more. However, his tone was now graver.

“Beast Master, now that the Cyclops Demon King is dead, you are the only one who understands demon language. Can I trouble you to speak to those demon kings?” Jiang Shangyu frowned slightly. Now, joining forces was their only hope of withstanding the big demon king.

At that moment, the Beast Master was in a sorry state. The big demon had crushed his steed with a single bite. He was fortunate enough to escape, but he had been affected by the big demon’s demonic aura, and he was still unsteady on his feet. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

However, at that moment, the Beast Master could not be bothered about his state, sorry or otherwise. He walked towards the demon kings, who stood there with their ugly expressions. Unintelligible demonic words emerged from his mouth as he tried his best to communicate with these demon kings.

The demon kings had clearly been frightened by the big demon. When they heard the Beast Master’s words, the demon kings’ expressions grew complicated.

Jiang Shangyu frowned deeply as he watched an elder from the Ancient You Clan walk over. The two exchanged glances and both understood the other’s intentions.

No matter how fraught relations were between the Jiang Family and the Ancient You Clan, at this moment, they would face the enemy together and fight for their lives.

“Friends from the Jiang Family.” The elder from the Ancient You Clan stepped forward.

Jiang Shangyu raised his hand slightly.

“We are now in grave danger. I don’t know if you have heard the news from the Temple of Shadows,” the elder from the Ancient You Clan said.

Jiang Shangyu was startled, and he raised his eyes to the void to look at the troops from the Temple of Shadows.

Everyone had been affected by the big demon’s roar of rage and were unable to remain in the void. However, the Undead from the Temple of Shadows seemed unaffected by the big demon’s sonic waves.

Even so, only one of the three Skeletal Dragons from the Temple of Shadows remained; the steeds of the eight tribe leaders had all met their end in the big demon’s mouth.

“What are you trying to say?” Jiang Shangyu turned to look at the elder from the Ancient You Clan, his brow furrowed.

Why was the elder from the Ancient You Clan asking him if he knew about what had happened in the Temple of Shadows at a time like this?

What did it have to do with their current situation?

“Did you know that the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows has returned?” The elder from the Ancient You Clan asked.
