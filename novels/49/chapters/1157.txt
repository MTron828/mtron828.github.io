Chapter 1158: Splitting The Battlefield (1)

“Just as you wish,” the Pagoda Sword Master said as he swiftly swept a gaze across the three generals.

Under the circumstances, it was unrealistic to expect the Ancient You Clan to abandon their invasion and choose to leave, so they had no choice but to fight on. However, they were unable to gather in one spot, so they were forced to split up the battlefield.

In the end, the land was divided into three zones: the eastern part of the mainland became the eastern battlefield; the northern part became the northern battlefield; the southern part became the southern battlefield.

The Ultimate Elder assumed command of the eastern battlefield, the Pagoda Sword Master of the northern battlefield, while the powerful cultivators of the ancient clan held the southern battlefield!

“Go.”

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder and said.

The three main battlefields had been formed, and there would be no fighting here. Ye Qingtang wanted to leave before the Ancient You Clan noticed herself and the Blood Moon Elder.

Although Blood Moon Elder had not yet been exposed, if he remained in the Ancient You Clan, he would die. He had no choice but to leave with Ye Qingtang.

When he heard that, the Blood Moon Elder nodded. He threw Ye Qingtang onto his left shoulder and stepped out. He instantly vanished on the spot.

The formation of the three main battlefields was not good news for the Ultimate Elder or Pagoda Sword Master.

Splitting the battlefield was equivalent to dividing their manpower and strength. The Ancient You Clan had no problem dividing their manpower and strength.

The Ancient You Clan had many more powerful cultivators than this mainland. The more the powerful cultivators from this mainland were split up, the better it was for the clan.

…

After half a day, the Blood Moon Elder’s huge body suddenly appeared in the Falling Sky Valley of the Nine Nights Dynasty. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Blood Moon Elder’s appearance caused an uproar in the entire Nine Nights Dynasty. They only relaxed when they finally realized that the Blood Moon Elder was a friend and not an enemy.

“Mo… ther…”

When he saw that Ye Qingtang had returned, little Luo Xue ran out of the valley. He hugged Ye Qingtang’s ankles and batted his eyelids at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang smiled when she saw little Luo Xue running towards her on his short legs. She picked him up and hugged him.

While he was in her embrace, little Luo Xue suddenly spotted the little white tiger in Ye Qingtang’s arms. It was as if he had discovered a new world. His small white hand immediately caught hold of the little white tiger’s ears.

“If you were not so small…” The little white tiger glared at little Luo Xue.

“Has little Luo Xue been good?”

Ye Qingtang put down Luo Xue and laughed softly.

When he heard that, little Luo Xue held onto the little white tiger’s ear while nodding at Ye Qingtang.

Before long, Perfected Xuanchen, the Ye Family and the Si Family all came out of the valley.

Everyone was shocked to see the Blood Moon Elder’s huge body.

Ye Qingtang had no choice but to explain the circumstances to them.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s explanation, everyone relaxed. Many Falling Sky Valley disciples surrounded the Blood Moon Elder and stared at him, as if studying his expression.

“Qingtang, what’s going on?”

Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

Ye Qingtang did not hide anything and explained all that had happened to them.

Perfected Xuanchen was very shocked to learn about the division of the battlefield.

The Nine Nights Dynasty was south of the mainland and was considered to be in the southern zone. Based on the division of the mainland’s battlefield, it would be under the command of the ancient clan…

“Qingtang, are these powerful cultivators from the ancient clan the same as the ancient clan that came to our Falling Sky Valley previously…” Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang with a somewhat worried expression.
