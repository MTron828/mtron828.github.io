Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher were completely stunned.

The big yellow dog… Did it speak just now?

“It’s a mutated beast,” Ye Qingtang explained hurriedly.

“Mutated beast? But I don’t detect anything…” Lu Yuanxiang was confused.

“Yes… it is more special and can hide its aura.” Ye Qingtang casually found an excuse.

Since Ye Qingtang said so, Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher did not think too much about it.

“Sigh… oh no…” the yellow dog suddenly said.

“What’s wrong?” Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog and frowned. Nothing could go wrong at this critical moment.

“My divine power malfunctioned!” The big yellow dog’s tone was anxious. “How is that possible… why can’t I sense any spatial fluctuations… This shouldn’t be happening. It doesn’t make sense!”

Ye Qingtang was flabbergasted. She shouldn’t have trusted the dog.

…

Meanwhile, in the outside world.

Wen Qi stared at the screen with a solemn expression. He had seen Ye Qing from the video-recording ball that Luo Sheng brought with him. Then, he disappeared before reappearing in this mysterious palace.

Although Wen Qi and the others couldn’t hear the conversations of the people on the screen, they could make a rough guess.

This palace was not a refuge. Instead, it was a land of death. It was probably impossible for Ye Qing to leave after entering this palace.

“How are they to leave that palace?” One of the Vice-Presidents asked with a frown.

Wen Qi shook his head. Even with his vast experience, he didn’t know either. He just felt that the palace was not that simple. It would be impossible for them to leave so easily. After all, Lu Yuanxiang and the Flying Star Academy teacher had been trapped for so long.

…

Inside the palace in the Wailing Well.

Everyone was at a loss at what to do, as the big yellow dog continued to mumble to itself.

“Spatial fluctuation…” Ye Qingtang was deep in thought.

In that case, would they be able to leave as long as they could activate the power of space?

Ye Qingtang focused her mind and communicated with her mysterious Spiritual Abode. Although no one else detected anything, the big yellow dog suddenly looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Oh… that’s a pretty good Spiritual Abode…” the big yellow dog muttered. However, the big yellow dog could tell that it was not realistic for Ye Qingtang to communicate with that Spiritual Abode at her current skill level.

“Alright, I’ll help you.” The big yellow dog swung its tail at Ye Qingtang.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang disappeared from the palace in front of everyone, leaving only the big yellow dog wagging its tail.

“What happened?!”

One of the Vice-Presidents stared at the screen. His pupils dilated in shock when he saw Ye Qing disappear from the palace.

“How is it possible?”

Even Wen Qi was shocked.

Ye Qing… disappeared from the palace just like that?

“How did he do it? It can’t be the Space Technique, right?!” The Vice-President of the Sky Martial Academy frowned.

Before the Sky Martial Academy Vice-President could say anything, Ye Qing reappeared on the screen again.

It was like he had never left at all.

If they had not seen Ye Qing disappear with their own eyes, it would have been as if nothing had happened.

“Could it be that Ye Qing has found another way out of the palace?” A Vice President suggested this possibility. He would never believe that Ye Qing really knew how to use the Space Technique..
