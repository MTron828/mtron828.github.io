Chapter 2671: I Won’t Let It Hurt You (1)

Ye Qingtang’s mind went blank as she was held by Ling Yan.

In the next second, a loud bang thundered.

Ye Qingtang saw that the peak of the mountain that she and Ling Yan were standing on had turned into dust after being hit by a huge fireball.

Ye Qingtang instinctively looked towards the horizon. The dog was still biting the sun!

Was it going against the sun? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Something else made Ye Qingtang feel that something was wrong with the big yellow dog. It was originally chewing on the scorching sun but was now slowly moving its head. Its terrifyingly malicious eyes landed on Ling Yan.

This was the first time Ye Qingtang saw such a terrifying and vicious gaze from the yellow dog. It was completely different from the adorable and silly dog in her memory...

“Karma Bloodline...”

Ye Qingtang seemed to realize something and an ominous premonition surged in her heart. From her memories, she vaguely remembered hearing from the yellow dog that it had a deep grudge with the Karma Bloodline Clan in the upper realm!

Now, Ling Yan was the only person in the lower realm who had the Karma Bloodline.

At that moment, Ling Yan seemed to have sensed the big yellow dog’s gaze and returned its look.

“Ha... is the curse of this era about to begin?” Ling Yan chuckled.

Ye Qingtang was stunned. “Curse?”

Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang in his arms and chuckled. “It’s not really a curse. We came to this era and are not bound by fate. We are beyond it and can change history as we please, but we have to pay the corresponding price. It’s impossible to calculate the price and it’s hard to say if it will be good or bad.”

“What do you mean?” Ye Qingtang realized that she and Ling Yan’s intelligence levels seemed to be completely different. It was a little difficult to communicate with him.

“It’s very simple.” Ling Yan thought for a while before explaming with a smile,

“For example, if Miss Ye happened to encounter an unfamiliar Immortal

Emperor in our era, nothing would happen as you two had never met. But if Miss Ye changes some history in this past era... perhaps develop a grudge with that Immortal Emperor, he will never forget you even after you return to your own era.”

Ye Qingtang felt a headache coming on as she listened to Ling Yan’s explanation. She did not want to offend any Immortal Emperor!

“This is the effect on the future brought about by changing the past. Now that we have come to this era, there will definitely be some changes. For example, I have no grudge against that demon dog, but it is showing undisguised hostility towards me. This is the price that I have to pay,” Ling Yan continued.

“I won’t let it hurt you,” Ye Qingtang suddenly said.

Ling Yan was stunned and a smile appeared on his face. However, Ye Qingtang felt that something was amiss.

This yellow dog did not recognize her at all..

The big yellow dog must have already fallen into the trap of those Karma Bloodline practitioners from the upper realm. It had entered the Ancient God Karma Tunnel and ended up in the lower realm.

At this early stage, the yellow dog’s strength was unfathomable. As much as Ye Qingtang’s cultivation level had improved, she was just like an ant in front of this big yellow dog.

If the big yellow dog really attacked Ling Yan, how could she stop it?

Thinking about it carefully, it was really as Ling Yan had said. There was a price to pay for everything.

In this era, Han Cangming did not have the power of the Karma Big yellow dog, so the big yellow dog would not bother with him.. But Han Cangming had been possessed by Ling Yan, and Ling Yan had the Karma Bloodline...
