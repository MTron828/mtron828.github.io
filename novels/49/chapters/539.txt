Chapter 540 Displaying One’s Remarkable Prowess (3)

A flaming red figure stepped out of the blood-colored carriage slowly.

In just an instant, it attracted the attention of everyone present. With a red veil covering her face, Ye Qingtang gradually walked into everyone’s line of sight. The eyes that were exposed out of the veil were like a treasury of stars, revealing specks of coldness as they glanced across the masses.

The Blood Moon Sect members immediately separated into two sides when they saw Ye Qingtang walking out of the blood carriage.

Everyone including Shuo Tianzang and Jiang Chen, a Blood Moon Division Head, successively bowed to the girl in a red veil with a reverent and respectful expression.

Li Chenfeng was surprised. Previously, he only guessed that the person in the carriage was at the level of a Blood Moon Sect Elder, but now, the girl’s appearance could actually make the Blood Moon Division Head bow in respect… 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The Division Head and Elder had an equal position in Blood Moon Sect. If that girl was a Blood Moon Sect Elder, the Blood Moon Division Head absolutely did not need to give her a full bow.

Below, the remaining Xuanling Sect disciples were extremely curious as they looked at the girl.

Although Blood Moon Sect had a well-known reputation, very few saw their true faces, and the curiosity of the sect disciples was inevitable.

From the reaction of the Blood Moon Sect masses, they could tell that the girl’s identity and position were definitely not that of an average disciple.

“Could that person be…” After the appearance of Blood Moon Sect, Elder Qin, who had not spoken all this while, had a change in expression, and he looked at Elder Mo in front of him.

Blood Moon Sect’s appearance pinned down Yunxiao Sect, allowing the Xuanling Sect masses to heal their injuries.

The condition of those heavily-injured disciples was mostly stabilized, and the Xuanling Sect Master and Grand Elder had recovered quite a fair bit as well.

Elder Mo was rather perplexed as he looked at the girl in a red face veil. For some reason, he felt that the pair of eyes and brows outside the veil were seemingly familiar.

“Could it be one of the three great Blood Moon Sect Guardians?” The Xuanling Sect Master asked, flabbergasted. “But… It is said that the three Guardians of Blood Moon Sect were extremely mysterious and never appeared before anyone…” Elder Mo was unconvinced that a Blood Moon Guardian would appear. After all, those three Guardians never appeared even when Blood Moon Sect was annihilated back then. How then would they appear here today?

Was it truly to protect their Xuanling Sect?

Just the thought of it was preposterous.

However!

As Elder Mo was guessing that…

“We pay respects to the Guardian!”

In midair, the Blood Moon Sect masses greeted uniformly in a loud and imposing manner.

Elder Mo and everyone else in Xuanling Sect were utterly dumbstruck.

Everyone in Yunxiao Sect was even more astonished.

The three Blood Moon Guardians had never appeared before anyone since the founding of the sect, including when the sect was annihilated back then. Yet, unexpectedly… they actually saw an alive Blood Moon Guardian today?!

“You are a Blood Moon Guardian?” Li Chenfeng’s body stiffened as he stared at the mysterious girl.

A Blood Moon Guardian was ranked just below the Blood Moon Sect Sect Master and Holy Lord in Blood Moon Sect! Their skills and rank were not one that a Blood Moon Division Head and Elder could be compared to.

Puzzlement emerged in Ye You’s cold eyes as she stared at the Blood Moon Guardian who was donned in a red robe that swayed elegantly in the wind.

Although the Blood Moon Guardian’s face was covered bya red face veil, the person’s eyes were faintly familiar to her, and she seemed to have seen them somewhere before.
