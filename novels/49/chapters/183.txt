Chapter 184: Returning to the Sect (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The journey back was safe and stable. On the way back, everyone regained their energy, and the condition of the wound on Qin Huan’s arm improved. In the blink of an eye, everyone returned to Xuanling Sect.

Ye Qingtang was very gloomy about one thing though.

That silver wolf was in deep sleep throughout the journey and did not show any signs of consciousness. But it did not have a single drop of water over the past few days, which really worried Ye Qingtang.

It was not easy to pick up such a handsome wolf, and if it was starved to death, who would she go to cry to?

Luckily, although the wolf did not ingest anything, it did not look weary at all, and its fur was as shiny as before. Ye Qingtang then finally sighed as emotions overcame her.

Indeed, animals like wolves should still be appropriately fat for them to be able to withstand a drain in energy.

When they reached Xuanling Sect, Ye Qingtang insisted on personally carrying the silver wolf into the sect. During that period of time, Qin Huan and the rest wanted to help as they saw her short limbs but were all rejected by Ye Qingtang as though she was protecting it from thieves, causing all the senior brothers’ to feel extremely complicated.

This little junior sister’s love for wolves was quite strong!

When Ye Qingtang returned to her room, Su Wan and Lin Long were not around. She nimbly laid the unconscious silver wolf on her bed and touched its fur without bearing to let go.

“After I submit the mission, I’ll find someone to take a look at you. Wait for me,” Ye Qingtang said to the silver wolf very earnestly.

The certain someone who continued pretending to be unconscious felt very complicated…

Ye Qingtang settled the silver wolf and immediately headed to the Rewards Pavilion with Wu Qi’s head.

The team mission with Gu Yanqiu’s team was to be submitted by Gu Yanqiu, and the obtained Xuanming points had to be divided amongst all the participants while this head that Ye Qingtang had in her hand was all hers.

Ye Qingtang walked towards the Rewards Pavilion in a good mood. She did not have any idea how many Xuanming points Wu Qi’s head was worth, but according to the Assassination Roll, the bare minimum amount would not be lower than a three digit number. If she could exchange the head for so many Xuanming points, Ye Qingtang’s subsequent efficiency in cultivation in the sect would really be doubled.

Just as Ye Qingtang hummed a song and walked through the outer sect, her agile figure fell into the eyes of someone from not far away.

“Senior Brother Yun, I am still not too familiar with the swordplay that the warden taught yesterday. Can you teach me one more time?” Su Wan lifted her exquisitely made-up face and looked at Yun Shu beside her but suddenly realized that Yun Shu’s eyes seemed to be attracted by something. She could not help but look up curiously in the direction of Yun Shu’s gaze, but this look completely caused the smile on her face to freeze.

Was that figure walking past from a distance away not Ye Qingtang, who left the outer sect for half a month?! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The moment Su Wan saw Ye Qingtang, her heart skipped a beat instinctively.

“Junior Sister Ye is back?” Yun Shu could not help but smile as he looked at Ye Qingtang’s back view.

But in Su Wan’s eyes, that thoughtless smile was more disturbing than ever.

Ever since Ye Qingtang left the outer sect, Su Wan abandoned all previous reservations and searched for an excuse to find Yun Shu every day. It was as though she completely replaced Ye Qingtang’s position as the person around Yun Shu.

Yun Shu was good-natured and not good at rejecting people’s requests. Su Wan succeeded time over time, and in just half a month’s time, rumors about the two of them started to spread within the outer sect. Yun Shu had never put it to heart and tried to explain a few times, but Su Wan told to him to brush it off using the excuse that as long as they had nothing going on between them, it would eventually be proven to others.

Little did anyone know that this outcome was exactly what Su Wan wanted.
