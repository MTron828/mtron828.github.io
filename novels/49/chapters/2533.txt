Just one of them was enough to crush Ye Qingtang to death with a single finger. And there were several of them out there now.

Ye Qingtang was very surprised. She knew about the Sky Vault Sect. They were powerful but they couldn’t possibly be that powerful… How many mighty figures were there in the Sky Vault Sect?

For a moment there, Ye Qingtang did not know what to do. There was no way to escape from this siege.

Ye Qingtang wanted to say something, but her gaze suddenly landed outside the house. In the next second, Ye Qingtang hugged the big yellow dog and leaped onto the beam.

After a few breaths, the door creaked open.

Through the moonlight, Ye Qingtang saw that the person was no stranger to her. It was the woman in green.

Ye Qingtang sneered. This lady in green was like a sticky plaster that could not be shaken off.

After the woman in green entered, she did not do anything but just stood by the door and scanned the house.

“Heh, little slut, why are you still hiding?” After a long time, the lady in green looked at the roof beam.

Seeing that she had been discovered by the woman in green, Ye Qingtang did not say anything. With no intention to continue hiding, she directly threw the big yellow dog at the woman.

The woman in green did not see the big yellow dog clearly and thought that Ye Qingtang was throwing some concealed projectile. She instinctively dodged.

There was a loud crash as the big yellow dog slammed into the ground.

Seeing that, Ye Qingtang could not help but sigh and smack her forehead. She originally wanted to have the yellow dog launch a sneak attack, but the result was different from what she expected.

“Little girl, are you still human? You used me as a projectile!” The big yellow dog stood up and shouted at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang jumped down from the beam.

The lady in green waved her fingers, and the candles in the room lit up.

“You managed to hide quite a distance away.” The woman in green’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang as she sized her up. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Ha, are you here to seek death?” Ye Qingtang was not afraid in the slightest when facing the lady in green. Her lips curled into a cold smile as she said, “Even your Branch Master’s body was destroyed. You are quite bold to dare to come looking for me.”

As Ye Qingtang spoke, she glanced at the big yellow dog not far away.

The meaning behind Ye Qingtang’s words was very clear. Even the Sky Vault Sect’s Branch Master was heavily injured by the big yellow dog in one strike. Even if this woman was the reincarnation of a True God, she was still not as strong as the Sky Vault Sect’s Branch Master at this current stage.

“Ha, Ye Qingtang, so you think I came to take revenge on you?” The lady in green smiled.

“If not, tell me why you are here then.” Ye Qingtang said.

“I came here today to make a deal with you.” The lady in green’s gaze landed inadvertently on Ye Qingtang’s chest.

“You want to make a deal with me?”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the lady in green and could not help feeling amused. There was a deep-seated grudge between the two of them. How could they strike a deal?

“That’s right.” The lady in green looked at Ye Qingtang and nodded.

“I’m curious as to what kind of deal you and I can make. Go on.” Ye Qingtang finally spoke after a long while.

“Ye Qingtang, I want your heart,” The lady in green uttered those shocking words.

A cold glint flickered in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.
