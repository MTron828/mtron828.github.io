Chapter 1050 Beiming Manor (1)

Neither the Yuehua Sect Grand Elder nor Lingyun Sect Grand Elder dared to be impetuous when they learned that Ye Qingtang was a Yang Lord.

Never would they have thought that Yunxiao Sect actually offended a Yang Lord…

If it was Bai Kui or Daoist Zijin, the Grand Elders could still stand on Yunxiao Sect’s side. However, it was impossible for them to go against a Yang Lord if they wanted to live a longer life.

The two super sects Grand Elders stood before Ye Qingtang in silence, deeply afraid that she would execute them when displeased.

Ye Qingtang swept a look at the two of them and subsequently said, “Get lost.”

After hearing Ye Qingtang, the Lingyun Sect Grand Elder nodded his head repeatedly and disappeared without a trace.

“Farewell, senior… Farewell, se… If there’s anything that you need my Yuehua Sect for in the future, you may just inform us…” The Yuehua Sect Grand Elder disappeared immediately after saying that.

Ye Qingtang did not have any enmity with Lingyun Sect and Yuehua Sect and did not wish to start another war; thus, letting these two Grand Elders leave was sufficient.

At this instant, the Yunxiao Sect masses were dumbfounded and even had goosebumps as they looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s martial skills were too frightening. On this mainland, a Yang Lord was almost unparalleled, and even a super sect was nothing to a Yang Lord.

Yunxiao Sect Sect Master and Grand Elder stared at Ye Qingtang in astonishment. They would have never thought that Ye Qingtang was actually a Yang Lord…

“Come here!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Then, Ye Qingtang raised her right arm, and a powerful force swept over. In at most two breaths’ time, Ye Qingtang had already clutched onto the Yunxiao Sect Grand Elder’s throat.

“You seemed to be very arrogant earlier on,” Ye Qingtang said coldly as she glared at the Yunxiao Sect Grand Elder.

The Yunxiao Sect Grand Elder shuddered, and his face paled after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words. He did not know what he should say, and everything that happened seemed to be an unbelievable dream.

One hour ago, they were still chatting with the Beiming Manor envoy within the sect, but a short while later, a Yang Lord came searching for them…

“Ye Qingtang… even if you are a Yang Lord… our Yunxiao Sect is affiliated to Beiming Manor. However powerful you are, do you dare to ignore the Beiming Manor?!” Yunxiao Sect Grand Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and shouted.

“Beiming Manor…”

The Ye Family members were in thought upon hearing that.

Beiming Manor was one of the extraordinary forces of this mainland and was on par with the Phantom Valley and Peerless School. They were known as the three mightiest sect forces.

It was said that the Beiming Manor Chief was a Yang Lord of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven, and his martial skills were unrivaled.

Ye Qingtang did not have any thoughts about Beiming Manor as she did not have any grudges against them. It would be best if they did not interfere with this matter, but if they insisted, Ye Qingtang would definitely not do nothing.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was silent, Yunxiao Sect Sect Master thought that Ye Qingtang was afraid of Beiming Manor, and he sneered. “So what if you are a Yang Lord? There are countless powerful figures in Beiming Manor, and the Manor Chief is an Eighth Heaven Yang Lord. If you dare to touch my Yunxiao Sect today, it is equivalent to opposing Beiming Manor!”
