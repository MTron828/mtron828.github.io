Chapter 1312: Everything Is Ready (2)

Ye Qingtang swept a bland look at the Eldest Prince but did not say anything.

Ling Yan, you better be careful!

The recent ascension of the Eternal Dynasty’s Crown Prince should have been a joyous occasion, but many calls for impeachment now arose in the Eternal Dynasty’s court.

According to the Eternal Dynasty’s custom, a morning court session was held every day, and all the princes and princesses had to attend, even those who had not been crowned.

The Eternal Emperor was presiding over the court when a minister suddenly stepped forward and kneeled to present a memorial.

“Your Majesty, I have a memorial to present!”

“What is it?” asked the Eternal Emperor.

“Your Majesty, I wish to impeach the Crown Prince, Ling Yan, for allowing his subordinates to wreak havoc among the citizens!” the minister said loudly.

The Eternal Emperor had just made Ling Yan the Crown Prince, but within a few days, someone dared to call for an impeachment!

Many ministers in the court were shocked. Everyone’s eyes involuntarily turned to Ling Yan, who was standing at one side of the great hall.

Ling Yan did not seem to hear that someone was calling for his impeachment. He only remained in his spot, with a remote expression on his face. His eyelids did not even flicker.

The Eldest Prince, who was standing opposite Ling Yan, secretly exchanged glances with the Second Princess, who was behind the latter. When his gaze passed over Ling Yan, a trace of amusement flashed across his eyes.

With that, he subtly nodded at a scrawny man, who was dressed as a civil servant and standing at the side of the great hall.

This civil servant was originally one of the Eldest Prince’s trusted subordinates, but today, he had been replaced.

Today, Ye Qingtang was standing there, looking like an ordinary person. Early that morning, the Eldest Prince and the Second Princess had prepared everything and were ready to make their move in the morning court session. In order to ensure that everything went smoothly, the Eldest Princess had especially requested Ye Qingtang to disguise herself as a civil servant and sneak into the morning court session.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Eldest Prince’s expression and sighed inwardly. What was meant to be would always be.

She subconsciously lifted her gaze and glanced at Ling Yan’s back. Her emotions were rather tangled.

The Eternal Emperor’s expression stiffened.

“You want to impeach the Crown Prince?”

“Yes!”

“What has the Crown Prince done wrong that you wish to impeach him?” The Eternal Emperor frowned slightly, and a hint of his displeasure showed. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The minister steeled himself and said, “The Crown Prince Ling Yan has conducted himself poorly, allowing his subordinates to deceive the Emperor. His wrongs are innumerable!”

“How dare you!” The Eternal Emperor suddenly smacked the throne heavily.

“Do you know what the penalty is for maligning the Crown Prince?”

The minister kowtowed deeply and said solemnly, “I know that the penalty for maligning the Crown Prince is death. But as a minister, I cannot ignore his crimes. Today, I make the risky move of impeaching the Crown Prince for the sake of the safety and security of my Eternal Dynasty. Your Majesty, please hear me out. After that, I will gladly accept any consequences that Your Majesty metes out!”

The Eternal Emperor narrowed his eyes slightly and took a deep breath. He looked deeply displeased.

The Eldest Prince, who was standing nearby, saw this, and a hint of amusement arose in his heart. But his expression was worried when he advanced and said, “Father, the Crown Prince has always been honest and kind. He could not possibly have done anything treasonous.”

With that, the Eldest Prince turned to the minister who was kneeling on the floor. “Lord Hu, is there some misunderstanding on your part?”

“There is no misunderstanding on my part,” Lord Hu said with a straight face.

At that moment, the Second Princess said, “Lord Hu has always been upright and principled. He is both honest and fair. He must have discovered something for him to risk his life today to ask for an impeachment. I also do not believe that the Crown Prince is corrupt, but since Lord Hu has spoken up, Royal Father, why don’t you allow Lord Hu to explain himself so that the Crown Prince can clear his name?”
