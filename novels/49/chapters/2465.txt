Chapter 2466: Big Trouble (4)

Seeing Ye Qing’s action, the Flying Star Academy teacher was stunned. What was Ye Qing doing? Hadn’t he already successfully bluffed his way through?!

“Erm, Teacher Ye Qing… what are you doing? The Netherworld Tribe and Flying Star Tribe do not interfere in the affairs of others…” The Flying Star Academy teacher said hurriedly.

Ye Qingtang glanced at the teacher. “They are not smart but they are not as dumb as you think.”

“What’s going on?” The Flying Star Academy teacher did not quite understand.

“It already knows that we are humans. If we let it leave now and the news spreads, we will definitely die,” Ye Qingtang said.

“What?”

Lu Yuanxiang and the teacher’s expressions changed immediately.

It was not that the demon was not smart. It was the Flying Star Academy teacher who was foolish enough to let the demon go and invite disaster.

“Human, I didn’t expect you to see through me.” The fiendish demon shouted coldly.

“Teacher Ye Qing, we have to run!” The Flying Star Academy teacher shouted hurriedly. He had a permanent fear of demons in his heart.

“What are you running for?” Lu Yuanxiang asked with a cold smile. “If that demon could really eat us, would it have played dumb and tried to leave?”

Lu Yuanxiang was sure that this demon was not very strong. At the very least, it could not defeat them all!

“Kill it, no matter what!” Lu Yuanxiang said as he made his move.

Seeing this, the eyes of the Flying Star Academy teacher and the other students turned red. They could not let this demon leave alive, or they would be skinned alive.

Everyone immediately used their ultimate killing technique.

“These are…” The demon’s face was full of shock as he looked at the array of martial art techniques and divine arts.

It had never seen such martial art techniques and divine arts, nor had it even heard of them. It did not know how to counter or dodge them.

It had to be said that this demon’s powers were indeed extremely ordinary. It was just that it possessed extraordinary strength at around the Divine Lord Sixth Heaven Level. But it didn’t know any martial art techniques and divine arts.

If it was a human expert at the Divine Lord Sixth Heaven Level, they might have needed to expend quite a bit of effort. But this demon… didn’t have any martial art techniques and divine abilities, so it was basically impossible for it to defend itself. After a few exchanges, it was heavily injured by Lu Yuanxiang’s palm strike.

Unwilling to be outdone, Lei Yan and Nangong Lie stepped forward to viciously stab him a few times. They only stopped after they confirmed that this demon was dead.

However, to everyone’s surprise, anyone who was tainted by the demon’s blood could clearly feel a mark being imprinted on their body.

“What’s going on?” Nangong Lie was stunned.

“Tracking mark?!” The Flying Star Academy teacher was shocked.

“And a demon’s special tracking mark at that.” Ye Qingtang could not help but feel troubled.

Who would have thought that this demon would have a tracking mark in its body?

Once it was killed, its tribe would definitely find out and chase them to the ends of the earth.

“This demon must have a high status in its tribe,” Ye Qingtang said thoughtfully. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang, who had once lived in the eastern faction, naturally knew what was going on. Generally speaking, the tracking mark would only appear for members from the upper echelons. Once someone from the upper echelons was killed, the tribe would know the exact location of the murderer.

However, this demon was not very strong and did not look like a high-level demon.

But Ye Qingtang knew that if it was a descendant of a high-ranking demon, it would also have such a tracking mark in its body…

“We… might be in big trouble this time,” Ye Qingtang muttered..
