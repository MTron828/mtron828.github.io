Mo Yunxian could not help but be startled.

“Xian’er, what are you doing?!” Mo You was utterly shocked. He knew that Mo Yunxian was anxious to see Ling Yan and that she was rather heedless, but… how could she kill someone publicly?

Mo Yunxian looked at the leather whip in her hand before she snapped out of her trance. She had not really exerted any force just now, yet why had the old man died just like that?

“What does it have to do with me? I wasn’t the one who killed him. I didn’t use any force at all. Perhaps he is pretending to be dead. I just flicked the whip lightly. How could he have died…” Mo Yunxian’s face was filled with impatience. Combined with the fact that her injuries were beginning to ache and itch, she did not wish to linger here any longer.

Also, she truly had not intended to kill the old man. She just wanted to scare him. Who knew why he had mysteriously died.

The surrounding citizens were abuzz when they saw that three people had died before their eyes and that Mo Yunxian was acting arrogantly.

These citizens held General Mo in high regard. He had achieved much glory on the battlefield, and to the citizens of the Eternal Dynasty, he was a great hero. But many of the Eternal Dynasty citizens secretly shook their heads at his only daughter.

Although Mo Yunxian was seldom in the capital, her reputation for being coquettish and willful was widely known among the people.

Now, many people felt that they had seen Mo Yunxian’s true colors.

Three people had died just like that, and Mo Yunxian had personally killed one of them. So many eyes had witnessed it, but she made various excuses and continued to quibble.

Mo You vaguely sensed that something was amiss, but before he could recover his wits, a troop of soldiers suddenly emerged from the noisy crowd.

“What’s going on here?” The officer in the lead frowned as he looked at the three bodies lying on the ground.

Mo You was just about to reply, but Mo Yunxian’s patience completely evaporated.

“You’re just in time. I don’t know where these three unruly citizens came from, but they ran in front of us to make trouble, and now they are playing dead to malign us. You must capture them quickly,” Mo Yunxian said when she saw the soldiers.

She might not know what else was going on, but she was completely clear about how much force she had used.

That slight amount of force was not sufficient to kill. These three must be feigning dead to malign them.

The soldiers naturally recognized Mo Yunxian as a noble young lady. Then, they saw that the other person was the Crown Prince’s personal bodyguard, Mo You. They were somewhat suspicious but still went forward to inspect the three bodies

“Reporting to my Lord, the three people are really dead,” a soldier said after a check.

Mo Yunxian was stunned by these words.

“Did you check carefully? They must be using some sort of method to play dead.” Mo Yunxian frowned. Although Mo You’s subordinate had said that the three people were dead, she had seen many ways of feigning death in her years cultivating abroad, so she continued to believe that the three were pretending to be dead.

“Miss Mo, the three of them are really dead,” the officer in the lead said.

“Nonsense.” Mo Yunxian did not believe him at all. She went forward to look at the old man lying in the debris. Her eyes narrowed.

“I don’t believe you can continue with your act.” As she spoke, Mo Yunxian raised her hand and used her whip to strike at the old man’s body.

Mo Yunxian’s move startled the surrounding people. Even Mo You had not expected Mo Yunxian to be so reckless.

This time, Mo Yunxian used her full strength. Even if this person was pretending to be dead, the force of this blow would cause so much pain that he would be unable to maintain his act.
