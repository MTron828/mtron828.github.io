Chapter 1946: Brutes (1)

There were some other grim-faced people in the same cage as Ye You and the other two. Ye Qingtang did not recognize any of those people, but she did notice that after the cloth pouch was passed inside, it was quickly blocked from view by those people.

From her high vantage point, it was pure coincidence that she happened to see what happened. After those people blocked the cloth pouch from sight, Ye You and the other two immediately opened the pouch and took out some food from it. Then they quickly gobbled it all up.

Strange.

No one cared if any one of the hostages were near-death. None of the Ancient You Clan folks displayed the slightest bit of pity or mercy.

So why would the Ancient You Clan sentry suddenly be so kind as to give food to Ye You and the others?

Ye Qingtang took a closer look and discovered that although Ye You and the other two were injured and looked very haggard, there was no despair in their eyes.

That type of hopelessness was difficult to feign.

In addition, there were no corpses inside their cage. Apart from Ye You and the other two females, the other people inside the cage were youths in their early teens.

“Does that cage contain any of your people?” Ye Qingtang pointed toward Ye You’s cage.

The ancient clan members all thought that Ye Qingtang was going to save the hostages. They immediately leaned forward to try and identify the people.

But after studying the prisoners for some time, none of the ancient clan members could recognize any one of those youths at all.

It was very strange. The leaders and elders could not identify those youths even though they were garbed in the uniforms of the ancient clans.

Ye Qingtang smelled a rat.

Just as Ye Qingtang was pondering what kind of trick the Ancient You Clan was up to, several figures suddenly appeared at the entrance of the canyon.

Glancing at the group, Ye Qingtang noticed the figure at the front.

“Domain Monarch? How is that possible? Why did he come?” One of the ancient clan elders instantly recognized the wild-haired Domain Monarch. It was the long-missing Domain Monarch!

Ye Qingtang’s eyes narrowed the moment she saw the Domain Monarch. Her heart nearly came to a stop when she saw the people tagging along behind.

Jiang Xun? Jiang Lang?!

The sentries immediately sounded the signal when they saw the Domain Monarch. The faces of the trio were all tensed up as if prepared to go into battle.

Suddenly, a wild wind started up as dust and sand swirled beneath the hands of the Domain Monarch. The sentries were sent flying away by the wild gusts of wind.

Jiang Xun and Jiang Lang took this opportunity to charge into the canyon to locate members of the Jiang family. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Have those Jiang family people gone mad? They are just throwing themselves into a trap.”

“They’ve been tricked.”

The ancient clan members never expected the Domain Monarch to really come forth to save his own people. They really believed the Domain Monarch must have gone mad.

“The Jiang family has always valued the family above all. But this time... sigh, the Domain Monarch really shouldn’t have come.”

A large number of ancient clan folks had been captured but no one dared to charge in to rescue them. But now, they watched as the Jiang family risked everything to save their own people.

Although this was akin to bashing one’s head against a hard rock, this kind of courage was also rather admirable.

The ancient clan members expressed a combination of regret and respect. Ye Qingtang was the only one who felt both shock and joy upon seeing Jiang Lang and Jiang Xun.

She was happy they were still alive but shocked that they were throwing their lives away now!

And all just to save those three...

“Holy Lord, now that the Jiang family has arrived, should we take this opportunity when the two clans are fighting to...” One of the ancient clan leaders hinted that they should take advantage of the scuffle to save their own people.

Ye Qingtang didn’t respond. Instead, she kept her eyes fixed upon Jiang Lang and the others.
