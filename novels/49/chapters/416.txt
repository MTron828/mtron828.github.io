It was the figure of a male and a female. The man had an ash-white complexion and was wearing a long black robe while the lady beside him was donned in white and had an arrogant and aloof expression. Under the moonlight, she was exceptionally beautiful like a fairy that descended into the world, commanding respect from everyone.

However, Ye Qingtang’s mind exploded when she saw the face of the girl in white!

Ye You!

The girl standing on the back of the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix was clearly Ye You, the girl who snatched her spirit root back then!

Never had Ye Qingtang expected to actually see Ye You on the Drifting Cloud Island. The moment Ye Qingtang saw Ye You’s face, the emotions that Ye Qingtang had suppressed for a long time surged as though they wanted to rush out of her heart.

She tightened her grip on the Demonic Blood Sword as she glared at Ye You, who stood on the Nine-Tailed Spirit Fox.

“Why would a Yunxiao Sect disciple come to Drifting Cloud Island?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder did not sense the coldness on Ye Qingtang’s face and only looked at Ye You in surprise.

Yunxiao Sect was one of the super sects, and its skills were out of the ordinary. To ordinary sects like Qinglin Sect, Drifting Cloud Island may be an extremely good spot to cultivate but was probably nothing to a powerful sect like Yunxiao Sect.

“This girl is quite powerful. She can actually control a Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix. Looking at her overbearing air, this girl is at least Martial Qi Level Three already.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder mumbled as he looked at Ye You.

Martial Qi Level Three…

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

She was only at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One and was a long distance from Martial Qi Level Three.

Back when Ye You left Lin Town and entered Yunxiao Sect, her skills were similar to Ye Qingtang’s. Yet, unexpectedly… Ye You actually broke through to Martial Qi Level Three in just half a year!

It should be known that Ye Qingtang’s growth was supernatural to ordinary people, but despite this, she still could not win against the current Ye You.

Ye Qingtang forcefully suppressed the emotions in her heart and wished she could kill her enemy before her right now, yet rationality told her that she would only be courting death even if she rushed out with her current skills.

To a Martial Qi Level Three Ye You, it was an easy feat to kill her.

A glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes at that thought. Yuanxiao Sect lived up to its name as the first super sect. Ye You was an official disciple of the Yunxiao Sect’s Sect Master, and the cultivation resources naturally could not be compared to Xuanling Sect’s.

Apart from the cultivation resources that Yunxiao Sect provided, Ye You could advance so quickly by using Ye Qingtang’s blue spirit root. Only a superior-grade spirit root could allow one to advance this quickly.

Ye You snatched everything from Ye Qingtang. There would ultimately be a day where she would seize everything back from Ye You a hundredfold.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath quietly and forcefully suppressed her emotions.

As Yunxiao Sect’s Sect Master official disciple, why would Ye You appear on Drifting Cloud Island?

Just as Ye Qingtang was controlling her emotions, Ye You had already lowered the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix and directly faced Fu Lingtian, who was standing at the borders of Drifting Cloud Island.

“Fu Lingtian greets senior sister.” When Fu Lingtian saw Ye You, there was no surprise on his face, but rather, it was filled with respect. He kneeled down on one knee and greeted Ye You, who was on the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix.

Ye You nodded slightly without a trace of emotion on her aloof face.
