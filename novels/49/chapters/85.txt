Chapter 86: Life Experience (1)

Mu Su faltered for a moment, and realized he was asking about Ye Qingtang.

“Your Highness, Miss Ye has already gone home. May I ask why did you not converse more with her just now?” Mu Su asked calmly, though his mind yelled: Do you still want to have a child with her?!

“I already did.” Han Cangming replied stoically.

“….” Mu Su felt like banging his head against a wall. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

You considered that enough?!

Mu Su was on the verge of shedding tears again.

Comparing Han Cangming’s usual standards, his first conversation with Ye Qingtang was already eventful. If the enquirer was someone else, he never would have answered every query given. To receive words of advice directly from the Imperator in person was considered inconceivable.

Getting a single word from him would be impossible, much less a sentence.

Thus, he regarded his attitude displayed to her as “friendly” enough.

However….

“Pardon me your Highness…. In all honesty, if you’re intent on getting Miss Ye to bear a child with you, I’m afraid your disposition just now might not suffice.” Mu Su carefully voiced his opinion.

Han Cangming furrowed his brow.

“Then, what do you suggest?”

Asking for my suggestion? Mu Su was dumbfounded. Common sense dictates that courting a girl involves building a rapport, going on dates and sharing words of affection, but….

After scrutinizing his Highness’s face that spells “Stay away from me”, Mu Su had a hard time trying to imagine him being amorous whilst trying to woo someone with words.

Actually, the thought of that sent shivers down his spine instead.

“Erm… if your Highness prefers not to engage her with words, try gifting her some presents? Girls love presents, perhaps?” Mu Su reluctantly suggested.

Han Cangming lowered his eyes whilst his gaze remained contemplative.

By the time Ye Qingtang returned to the Ye’s residence, Ye Ling and the Second Elder had already disposed of the Great Elder’s body properly without a trace. Excluding the three of them, no one else would ever find out about the Great Elder’s death.

“Tang Tang, come with me for a moment.” Ye Ling did not retire to his quarters and was still seated in the main hall, seemingly waiting for Ye Qingtang’s return.

“Yes, father.” Ye Qingtang gave a nod and followed him to his study.

The study was dimly illuminated and after Ye Ling ushered Ye Qingtang to a seat, he turned around and retrieved a brocade box from a hidden compartment within the study room’s wall. Placing that box in front of Ye Qingtang, he beckoned her to check its contents.

After opening the box, Ye Qingtang found a jade pendant lying within. One could make out the pendant’s intricate and elegant design, the excellence of its craftsmanship was obvious even under the dim illumination.

“This is?” Ye Qingtang was puzzled by this, and looked to Ye Ling for an answer.

Ye Ling heaved a deep breath as he looked his daughter straight in the eyes, his gaze projecting the intricacy of his current thoughts.

“Tang Tang, there’re some things that I’d like you to know.”

Ye Qingtang was slightly perturbed as she could vaguely foresee the gravity of the matter Ye Ling was about to reveal.

Ye Ling looked deeply at the pendant in the box and spoke: “During my younger days, I spent most of my time away from home, totally engrossed in my training. Falling in love with and marrying your mother was truly a miracle, and at the time when your grandfather wanted me to take the reins of the House, I was still wandering the world with your mother who was pregnant. Unfortunately, while rushing home, due to the dire conditions of our journey, your mother had a miscarriage. Perhaps it was the Heaven’s way of making it up to us, but we chanced upon an abandoned baby on our way back….”

Ye Ling paused his tale here.

At the same time, Ye Qingtang realized the incongruity in his account.

Ye Ling only ever had her as his own flesh and blood, but according to his account just now, her mother had a miscarriage and they had even picked up an abandoned baby.
