Chapter 2270: Hidden Danger (3)

The moment the pearl disappeared, the flowing auras were suddenly sealed off. Everything looked normal once again.

Understanding dawned upon the old man when he saw the elder’s actions.

“My lord, the array formation in the fiendcelestial’s tomb has already been activated. After the men from the various factions have been sacrificed inside, their souls will enter that array formation. Your plan is indeed flawless.”

The elder surveyed the area, scanning the pitch-black forest.

People only knew that the fiendcelestial’s tomb was filled with the fiendcelestial’s treasures. What they did not know was that those treasures were just a lure to their death. The dangers within the fiendcelestial’s tomb were far greater than what everyone could imagine.

10 out of 10 people would die. It was a guaranteed consequence of those who entered.

“Let’s go. Before the array formation has absorbed enough souls, no one would be able to leave this place alive,” the elder said before he disappeared with a flash.

The old man glanced at the mountain one last time, his eyes glowing with an evil glint.

That’s right. Anyone who stepped into the tomb before the sacrifice was complete, would only end up being a sacrifice himself…

The two of them disappeared, not knowing that their expected 10 out of 10 prediction had already changed.

Ye Qingtang and her group had walked out of the tomb well and alive. After resting for a night, they recovered from their fatigue.

This time, Ye Qingtang did not dare to let those brats fool around again. After observing for a few days, she marked out a few locations from where the various factions were entering, before carving out a safe zone. She had Lei Yan and the others continue their training there.

On her own, she continued to observe the movements of the various factions.

The number of factions who entered the Evil Soul Forest continued to increase over the next few days. And the number of powerful practitioners at present became increasingly terrifying.

Some of the major factions even dispatched their most elite practitioners into the tomb. But Ye Qingtang observed that none of those who entered the fiendcelestial’s tomb managed to emerge.

Even the demon child and his company—Ye Qingtang saw no traces of them.

The expansive fiendcelestial’s tomb was like a deep abyss hidden in the darkness, swallowing everyone who dared to enter.

Ye Qingtang remembered that in her previous life, before information about the fiendcelestial’s tomb was completely exposed, the various factions had spent dozens of years exploring it and losing many men in the process, before finally fully understanding the place.

But it was rather strange.

The period of hibernation for the Night Soul Beasts should have ended several days ago. All the Night Soul Beasts should have been out roaming in the Evil Soul Forest now. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

But Ye Qingtang realized that after the fiendcelestial’s tomb was opened, apart from the one by her side, she did not see any other Night Soul Beast.

Could it be…

Had the Night Soul Beasts’ period of hibernation had lengthened?

Or did someone from the factions disturb the Night Soul Beasts’ slumber and the beasts decided to remain in the tomb after realizing there were intruders?

Ye Qingtang had no idea.

But…

She did not have much more time.

The Divine Phoenix seal would completely disappear in another two days’ time. If she couldn’t get the Evil Fruit within these two days, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao would regain its freedom.

By then, Ye Qingtang’s secret would be exposed.

There was no choice. Ye Qingtang had to enter the fiendcelestial’s tomb as soon as possible. Before going in, she specifically gathered Lei Yan and the others, instructing them to be very careful. She was going to be away for a few days.
