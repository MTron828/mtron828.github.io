“I should find a kennel to live in now…” the big yellow dog said as it looked around.

But Ye Qingtang scooped it up and left the place quickly with Blood Moon Elder.

“Holy Lady, please slow down, I can’t keep up.” The Blood Moon Elder was already panting. His new body was nothing compared to his old one and he was still very weak.

Ye Qingtang grew impatient as she saw this. With that, she grabbed his arm and ran with him.

Half an hour later, they arrived at an area deep in the forest. Even though she had no idea what ceremony the elders that the big yellow dog had spoken of were carrying out, they probably had no time to deal with them right now.

So she was going to seize this opportunity to recover the connection she had with the Deity Ocean.

The more she connected to the Deity Ocean, the more beneficial it was for her. If she were to meet with a dangerous situation, she could escape into the Deity Ocean quickly and her life would temporarily be safe from danger. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Did you realize that all the monsters from before are all gone?” the big yellow dog wagged his tail as he told Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang thought about what the big yellow dog said and realized that it was true. The above-Emperor level monsters that had been in the Wailing Well were all nowhere to be found now.

“Perhaps we’re lucky and just haven’t run into them,” Ye Qingtang said after some hesitation.

“I don’t think so,” the big yellow dog wagged his tail and continued, “I still remember how they smell, but it’s completely vanished now… actually, it’s more accurate to say that it has now concentrated into one area, and seems to be growing stronger rapidly…”

“You’re telling me that… those monsters are becoming some sort of nourishment?” Ye Qingtang said with a frown.

The big yellow dog didn’t refute this. It seemed to be the case.

“Above-Emperor level monsters…” the Blood Moon Elder said with a dark expression. He had just been revived. Couldn’t they let him live for just two more days?

His heart couldn’t take such a shock.

The elder that the big yellow dog was talking about previously had spoken about reviving someone important. That person was probably in the Wailing Well and the dead people as well as the terrifyingly scary above-Emperor level monster were likely all nourishment for that important person.

Ye Qingtang had an ominous feeling in her heart. Who was this person…

“Holy Lady, we have to find a way to leave this place. I feel like we will die if we continue staying here.” The Blood Moon Elder was worrying at the side. Was he about to die when he had just been revived?

He didn’t want to die just like that. At least in the First Domain, he died heroically. But this time he was going to die before even understanding the situation.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang glanced at Blood Moon Elder.

If she was able to leave, she would have already. Why would she still be here?

“Don’t worry, I’m here,” after a long while, Ye Qingtang said slowly.

Just as she said that, sounds of rumbling could be heard from the distant mountains.. The ground started shaking after a while as well.
