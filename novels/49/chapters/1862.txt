Chapter 1863: The Crystal Palace (3)

Quickly pooling all of their spirit stones together, it added up to about three thousand.

“It’s not enough,” Fu Qiu said immediately.

Ye Qingtang spoke. “Could you treat this three thousand as a deposit and let my two friends go in first? I’ll go and gather the rest of the spirit stones.”

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo froze as Ye Qingtang said this.

They had already been prepared to give up. After all, they didn’t have that many spirit stones, so there was nothing they could do if Ye Qingtang decided to leave them outside.

They had not expected Ye Qingtang to let them go in first. Just as they wanted to retort, Ye Qingtang shot them a steady look.

Fu Qiu was taken aback by Ye Qingtang’s words.

“You want them to come in first? You should know that the sun is about to rise. If you don’t have enough spirit stones, you’re going to have to spend the day outside, and no one is going to save you if you die.”

“That’s not something you need to worry about. I have a plan,” Ye Qingtang said.

She looked at the situation Jiang Shaobai and she was in. With their ability, winning two thousand spirit stones before the sun rose shouldn’t be a problem.

As for Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo...

They should remain obediently in the Crystal Palace for now.

Fu Qiu fell silent for a moment after Ye Qingtang spoke and finally bent down from within the Crystal Palace, revealing his head. He wanted to see what this selfless girl looked like.

It was only at this moment that Ye Qingtang and the others saw what Fu Qiu really looked like.

Fu Qiu’s body was huge, much larger than the other fat catfishes they had seen. It looked like a huge giant when it popped its head out.

There was a small cigarette in Fu Qiu’s mouth. it was approximately the size of a human but looked extremely tiny in its eyes.

Surprise flashed through its black beady eyes as it looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Jiu’er?” Fu Qiu suddenly murmured.

Everyone else looked surprised as well.

But he quickly recovered and his gaze swept over Ye Qingtang’s body. It still looked a little confused but the confusion vanished quickly from his eyes.

It looked at the people beside Ye Qingtang and said, “I’ll let two people enter for three thousand.”

Ye Qingtang was thinking the same thing and pointed at Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo.

The two were unwilling at first but Ye Qingtang told them straight up that they didn’t have enough spirit stones. As such, it would be better for them to remain there for now so as not to be a burden to her and Jiang Shaobai. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Understanding that their skills would be useless here, Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo could only agree reluctantly with awkward looks on their faces. Now they felt even more indebted to Ye Qingtang.

They had never imagined that the little girl from the Jiang family, whom they had never even seen in the Martial Arts Championship, would be their savior.

Fu Qiu didn’t say much about Ye Qingtang’s decision and only continued puffing on its cigarette. Its gaze on Ye Qingtang became more and more complicated.

After persuading Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo to go into the Crystal Palace, Ye Qingtang ran around gathering spirit stones with Little White Tiger and Jiang Shaobai.
