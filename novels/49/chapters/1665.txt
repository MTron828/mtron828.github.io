Chapter 1666: A Bet (1)

Jiang Yisheng still wanted to ridicule Jiang Yiran a little more, but when he saw Jiang Yiran’s downtrodden state, he swallowed his words.

Meanwhile in the spectator area, Elder Qian and the others were a little regretful when they saw that Jiang Yiran had lost.

“Mu Ruxue is truly as talented as she is rumored to be. Jiang Yiran is one of the exceptionally talented youths in the Jiang family, but he was no match for her.” Elder Qian sighed quietly.

“Probably only Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai are able to compete with Mu Ruxue. But it looks like there are many talented figures in this Martial Arts Championship. I really can’t tell how things will go.” Elder Kun also looked helpless.

This year, they had pinned all their hopes on Jiang Yanyun and Jiang Shaobai. If even the two of them could not get into the top ten, then the Jiang family’s reputation would take a hit.

The second round of matches were not as light-hearted. Many Jiang family members lost.

Jiang Yiran might have lost that day, but unlike the other losers, he did not stay in his room and sulk. Instead, he followed Ye Qingtang and the others to eat. He tagged along until Jiang Yisheng was so irritated he wanted to kick Jiang Yiran away.

“Get lost, get lost. Leave us alone. Go look for your Jiang Yanyun. Why are you here to make trouble for us.” Jiang Yisheng shooed him away as he would a chick. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Jiang Yiran still smiled cheekily and said, “Elder Brother Yun is not leaving his room for the next few days in order to prepare for the upcoming matches. We are all from the same family, why can’t we have a meal together? Can’t you see I’m injured? Where’s your sympathy? No wonder your female goddess doesn’t like you. Oh actually... to be precise, your female goddess hasn’t even noticed you.”

“...” Jiang Yisheng was so angry he wanted to strangle him! If not for the fact that he was no match for Jiang Yiran, he would certainly fight him.

Jiang Yiran sat at their table, forcefully squeezing his way in. He looked at Ye Qingtang, who was waiting for her food next to him, and he winked at her meaningfully.

“Little girl, I put your name in the box just now.”

“...” Ye Qingtang’s eyes widened slightly. She vaguely remembered that the votes in the box represented the beauty ranking.

What was he up to!

Please let me off!

“That lunatic must have something wrong with her brain. She’s so ugly. I would rather vote for a pig than vote for her.” Jiang Yiran was furious with Mu Ruxue, who had tried to kill him.

Ye Qingtang who had been called “pig” for no reason silently glared at Jiang Yiran. She really wanted to kick him down the stairs.

Was he complimenting her or scolding her?

“What did you say?” Before Ye Qingtang could kick Jiang Yiran, a shrill female voice rang out.

Jiang Yiran turned and saw that Mu Ruxue had entered the restaurant at some point.

At that moment, Mu Ruxue’s beautiful little face was completely distorted. She had clearly overheard Jiang Yiran’s words.

Since Jiang Yiran had already lost and they weren’t in the arena, he had nothing to fear. He looked at Mu Ruxue’s furious face and said evilly, “What I said is none of your business. What’s the matter? Does the Mu family want to control what other people say?”

“You... you jerk, how dare you insult me?” Mu Ruxue had always been treasured and praised. How could she bear it when Jiang Yiran insulted her and said she was not even comparable to a pig?
