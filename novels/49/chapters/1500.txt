Chapter 1501 Treasures 1

Though everyone wanted to fight for the big demon’s body, no one dared to fight with the other big demon. They all shivered in fear as the ground in front of them was covered by a sea of blood.

No one wanted to be involved in the fight between big demons.

Everyone was disappointed as the big demon’s body was gone. However, they were attracted to a shimmering point in the mess. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

There was a huge palace standing behind the crushed mountain. The palace was built out of demon bones, which shined under the sunlight.

“That’s... the palace of the Frosty Snow Mountains’ Big Demon?” The Beast Master’s eyes sparkled as it stared at the palace.

Before a big demon was about to die, it would bring all its treasures and build a palace with its demonic power. After it passed away, its body would rot into the palace. This would trigger the demonic air in the palace, and the entire structure would sink into the ground, burying it underneath forever.

In the past, when people from different clans and forces came to the Land of Infinite Demons to look for big demons, all the big demons there had died a long time ago. Their palaces were all buried under the ground, and it took a large amount of time and energy to look for them.

The big demon was chasing and killing everyone, so it was some distance apart from its palace when it died. Its body was then taken away by another big demon, so the mechanism that controlled the movement of the palace was not triggered.

Everyone’s expression changed instantly. They all rushed towards the palace at the fastest speed without any extra talk.

Jiang Xun and Ye Qingtang also followed. However, Ye Qingtang noticed that there were many figures appearing from different directions as she was flying towards the palace. All of them were heading towards the same place as well.

There were other powerful figures hiding in the area?

Ye Qingtang was shocked, but she did not slow down at all.

The palace of the big demon contained all treasures it had in its life; it was a huge temptation to anyone.

The palace was too large for them to see its full structure, but it was obvious to tell how many treasures were inside.

People from all forces rushed into the palace as fast as they could. It was impossible for one force to own all the treasures, so they could only find and claim the most valuable treasures within the shortest time.

Boom!

The door of the palace was opened by force. Countless broken bones flew out.

About a hundred people had entered the palace within the blink of an eye.

Ye Qingtang slowed down as Jiang Xun was injured. Though she also desired the treasures, she needed to protect Jiang Xun.

But everyone, including the Jiang Family, all aimed at the palace.

Soon, Ye Qingtang entered the huge palace.

The scene in front of them was astonishing.

There were mountains of gold and treasure in the palace. Everyone was dazzled by the scene.

“This is... the Eternity Bottle?” In shock, the Beast Master picked up a jade bottle that was about an arm’s length.

The Eternity Bottle could transform all kinds of water into curing holy water. It could detoxify all poisons and disperse all heretic air. It was really a rare Dharma treasure.
