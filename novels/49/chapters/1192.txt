“General… Ye…” The powerful cultivator from the ancient clan suddenly summoned strength from somewhere and gripped Ye Qingtang’s right hand tightly. He began weeping before Ye Qingtang could move. “The Clan Master… With the Clan Master’s power… he could have… fled… but… but!”

“I know… I had great respect for the Master of the Ancient Clan…” Ye Qingtang hurried to console him when she saw how agitated the powerful cultivator from the ancient clan had become.

“General… Ye… The Yous… want… the Spiritual Abode’s incarnation… in this mainland… Then they will use the power of the Spiritual Abode’s incarnation… to destroy every living thing… in this mainland… they will transform all its life forms… into part of the Spiritual Abode… General Ye… find the incarnation… of the Spiritual Abode… and protect it… Do not allow… this mainland… to be destroyed… please… I beg you!” The powerful cultivator’s grip on Ye Qingtang’s hand tightened.

“I will…” Ye Qingtang said.

The powerful cultivator from the ancient clan finally closed his eyes reluctantly.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. She suddenly stood up. Her eyes glittered with a bone-chilling light as she shouted.

“The entire city is to be on full alert!”

“Yes!”

With that, one of the Ye Family’s branch masters turned and left, his face stern.

Ye Qingtang knew in her heart that this powerful cultivator from the ancient clan had only forced himself to survive to pass the news to her and Heaven City, the last faint hope of the entire southern battlefield…

The incarnation of the Spiritual Abode was certainly little You Yun.

The Ancient You Clan wanted to use little You Yun’s powers to transform all living things in this mainland into spirit energy, allowing the Spiritual Abode to reach the peak of its mystical powers.

Ye Qingtang also knew what Heaven City would be facing.

The main force on the southern battlefield and a powerful cultivator with the rank of general…

It was a real nightmare…

After a moment, Ye Qingtang returned to her room.

“Mo… ther…”

Little Luo Xue was excited to see Ye Qingtang. He opened his eyes wide and hugged Ye Qingtang’s calves.

Little You Yun also came over and smiled shyly.

For some reason, whenever Ye Qingtang saw little You Yun and little Luo Xue, warmth would fill her heart.

If she too collapsed, who would protect these two children…

Ye Qingtang picked up little Luo Xue and little You Yun and walked out of the house.

After a short while, they neared the city wall and the Blood Moon Elder.

“Hong Heqing…”

Ye Qingtang looked at Blood Moon Elder.

The Blood Moon Elder was startled by her words. He seldom heard Ye Qingtang call him directly by name. He had almost forgotten his real name. “Holy Lady, what is the matter?”

“Hong Heqing!” Ye Qingtang said again.

The Blood Moon Elder sank into silence. As far as he could recall, this was the first time that Ye Qingtang had called him so sternly by his real name.

“Hong Heqing is listening!”

“General Ye, I am ready to receive my orders!” The Blood Moon Elder shouted.

“While this war is ongoing, you are to protect these children!” Ye Qingtang pointed at little You Yun and little Luo Xue.

“What… this?!” The Blood Moon Elder was shocked by Ye Qingtang’s words. Was the Holy Lady ordering him to guard little You Yun and little Luo Xue?!

“Holy Lady… considering my capabilities, it’s better for me to enter the battlefield… it would be a waste of my talents to guard these two children…” The Blood Moon Elder muttered.

“Do you enjoy fighting that much?” Ye Qingtang asked softly.
