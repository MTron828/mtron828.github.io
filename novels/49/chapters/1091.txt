Chapter 1092 Obsession (4)

“Old Valley Master… Don’t… suffer anymore… Old Valley Master!”

Tears raced down Perfected Xuanchen’s cheeks, and he kneeled and bowed to Demon Lord Luo Xue.

“Old… Old Valley Master!”

Falling Sky Valley’s disciples, Peak Masters, and senior executives burst into tears, and they bowed to Demon Lord Luo Xue as well.

At this moment, Demon Lord Luo Xue was still persevering. He stretched his demon hand out and gently wiped the lady’s tears away. However, his demon hand passed through the lady’s body and could not hold onto her.

“Woo…”

Demon Lord Luo Xue sobbed softly.

Looking at this couple who had been separated for ten thousand years, Ye Qingtang looked down, and her heart weighed down as well.

In both lives, she did not know what love was, but what she witnessed today made her feel that love was deep and impactful…

At this moment, You Yun finally heard Demon Lord Luo Xue’s voice.

However, Demon Lord Luo Xue could no longer speak and could only make soft whimpers like a wild beast. It was just that his demon eye seemed to want to say something.

“Old friend… Stop persevering already… Take it as I’m… begging you…” the Regicide Sky Blade said in a complicated tone.

Currently, probably no one other than Demon Lord Luo Xue and the Regicide Sky Blade knew the intensity of the pain that Demon Lord Luo Xue was bearing.

“She has already heard you… seen you… and known you…” Ye Qingtang said softly as she looked at Demon Lord Luo Xue.

Every breath that Divine King Luo Xue took was an excruciating torture. Without vitality, the torture was not just limited to his body but more so a misery from the soul.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had admiration for the Divine King Luo Xue, who was documented in the historical records. Today, she met him and even learned of the deep love between him and You Yun. Looking at how Divine King Luo Xue refused to give up and rather bear the agonizing pain, Ye Qingtang eventually could not hold back and said, “Divine King Luo Xue, she is already dead… don’t obsess anymore…”

If You Yun were still alive, she probably would not be willing to see Divine King Luo Xue go through such torture.

Divine King Luo Xue had never betrayed You Yun.

Ye Qingtang’s voice repeated in Demon Lord Luo Xue’s mind over and over again.

“Woo…”

Demon Lord Luo Xue looked up at a bright star in the sky, but a woeful cry escaped him…

The day was replaced by night. As Demon Lord Luo Xue looked at the lady who gradually disappeared, he was in a state of calmness.

His demon eye was blurry while his demon palm was still up in the air, wanting to hold onto something which no longer existed.

“My heart… is aching so badly…”

Before You Yun disappeared completely, this sentence resounded for a long time.

Demon Lord Luo Xue’s raised arms finally fell down powerlessly at this moment.

Ten thousand years ago, the man sat before a little tree for god knows how many years as he waited for the little tree to grow into a towering tree, for his jet-black hair to turn snow-white.

The man stood up slowly and buried all his love into the soil. From then on, he no longer mentioned it and sealed all of himself in this place.

Between the mountains and clouds.

That year, the flowers were in full bloom, and the forest was filled with the pleasant scent of flowers. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Birds chirped in harmony. The sunlight was just right.

Under the brilliant sunlight, the lady looked at him with certainty and declared that he would be hers.

The man’s white shirt blew in the wind. He looked at the lady in confusion, subsequently shook his head, and left.

However, as the man turned around and left, his lips tugged up unknowingly. His heart that had been sealed for a long time, perhaps unbeknown to even himself, was melted by that lady’s bright smile.

“I am You Yun…”

“I am Luo Xue…”
