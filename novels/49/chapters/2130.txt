Chapter 2131: A Disparity Of 300 Years (2)

These foundational techniques didn’t seem like much but they would affect the future increase in cultivation levels. The higher one’s cultivation level was, the more influence it would have. So in 300 years, because of a change in martial arts and the emergence of powerful practitioners, the increase in cultivation levels in the future was much higher than in this present period.

The elder and the middle-aged man exchanged glances. They both saw the unusual glint in each others’ eyes. Nodding slightly at the middle-aged man, the latter took up another book from the table as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Do you have a good understanding of foundation techniques?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Then do you know about the Heavenly Mental Cultivation Technique?” The middle-aged man asked.

The Heavenly Mental Cultivation Technique was a foundational mental cultivation technique that could establish a very stable foundation in cultivators, and could also be used as a long-term cultivation technique. When practiced to advanced levels, it would also offer much higher protection against mental demons.

However, this Heavenly Mental Cultivation Technique required a lot of time to practice, and it did not do much to increase one’s cultivation levels. As a result, many powerful practitioners gave up practicing it after some time.

“I am aware.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“What opinion do you have about the Heavenly Mental Cultivation Technique?” The middle-aged man’s tone subconsciously became much more warm and polite.

“The practice of the Heavenly Mental Cultivation Technique is very cumbersome now. In reality, you only need to familiarize yourself with the first three steps, and then specialize in the final three steps. This can greatly shorten the time spent,” Ye Qingtang explained.

The middle-aged man was taken aback. A look of sudden understanding also flashed across the elder’s eyes.

Following that, they asked Ye Qingtang about a few other foundational cultivation techniques and methods.

Ye Qingtang did not hold back and explained everything. She had suggestions for improvement for all of them. For some, she even recommended a complete revamp.

For these things, some other people might not understand how apt her suggestions were. But the elder and the middle-aged man knew very well as they had been studying these methods for a long time.

The more foundation-focused a cultivation technique was, the greater its future influence. It was something that would follow the practitioner for a long time and they could afford to make no mistakes.

Time and experience were needed for one to fully grasp these things.

If they had not personally heard it, none of them would believe that this simple-sounding, yet profound explanation was being spouted from the lips of a young man in his early twenties.

Di Nuo had been ready to chase Ye Qingtang away. But the other two were hanging onto her every word, their discussion getting increasingly excited. Di Nuo couldn’t help feeling astonished.

As he specialized in martial arts, he did not know the key aspects of these foundational cultivation methods. He was unable to follow the discussion and didn’t feel that Ye Qingtang was saying anything important.

So why did those two have such expressions on their faces? Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

As the discussion progressed, mixed emotions appeared on the faces of the elder and middle-aged man. Ye Qingtang had resolved many of their doubts and unresolved questions accumulated over many years.

This kid’s understanding of the foundation cultivation techniques was even deeper than theirs!

“What’s your name?” The elder suddenly lifted his eyes to look at Ye Qingtang. His expression was friendly and cordial now.

“I am Ye Qing.” To make things simple, Ye Qingtang just cut off one syllabus from her real name.

“The younger generation is indeed our future.” The elder gave a small smile. “You want to become a teacher at our Netherworld Academy?”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Luo Sheng, make the arrangements for her.” The elder instructed.

Di Nuo was dumbstruck by the elder’s words.

What was he saying?

Was the elder accepting this kid’s application to become a teacher?
