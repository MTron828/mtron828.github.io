“I’ll take into account that you’re new here and I won’t make things difficult for you. I’ll just take your bangle as a stake.”

Once the fat catfish said that, everyone’s gazes riveted on Ye Qingtang’s wrist. Before everyone could look closer, she quickly put her hand down, covering her wrist with her long sleeves.

Little White Tiger was also stunned. It lifted its head, looking at Ye Qingtang’s hand. From Little White Tiger’s angle, Ye Qingtang’s wrist was empty. What bangle? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

That fat catfish had bad eyesight...

Hold on!

Little White Tiger was suddenly reminded of something.

Ye Qingtang had a bangle on her wrist, it was the Nine Souls Ring from the Holy Lord of Shadows. Ye Qingtang somehow ended up wearing it, but it had become invisible ever since she put on the Nine Souls Ring. No one could see it.

If the fat catfish hadn’t mentioned it, Little White Tiger would have completely forgotten about it.

So how could this fat catfish see the Nine Souls Ring?

Little White Tiger was surprised and confused at the same time.

Ye Qingtang also felt the same way as Little White Tiger. When the fat catfish mentioned the bangle, she subconsciously hid her wrist. If not, when Baili Xi and the others saw that there wasn’t anything on her wrist, it would only invite trouble for her.

However...

How could the fat catfish see the Nine Souls Ring?

She recalled that as the fat catfish spoke, its eyes traveled over her wrist inconspicuously. She hadn’t thought about the Nine Souls Ring at all, but now that the fat catfish mentioned it, she realized that...

This fellow must have spotted the Nine Souls Ring and came in her direction deliberately. If not, why would he have so much patience to waste time with some newcomers?

Baili Xi and the others hadn’t seen the bangle around her wrist. But noticing that she treasured it so much, it must be something important to her.

“How about I use this as a stake?” Baili Xi felt indebted to Ye Qingtang and since none of them knew how to gamble, their chances of winning were very low. He took a Dharma artifact out of his space ring and brought it in front of the fat catfish.

The Dharma artifact had a gold aura and was of a high grade. The corners of the fat catfish’s mouth twitched, contempt written all over its face. “I’m not interested in that. All I want is her bangle. If you’re not going to bet with it, I’ll leave right away.”

Baili Xi’s face darkened. He offered one of the best Dharma artifacts from the Baili family and it could easily be used as a stake. However...

This fat catfish didn’t even spare it a glance?

His Dharma artifact couldn’t compare with Ye Qingtang’s bangle?

Actually, the fat catfish had laid its eyes on the Nine Souls Ring from the very start. No matter what Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo offered, it wouldn’t budge. They couldn’t help but feel that this fat catfish was making things difficult for them on purpose.

“Whatever. Even if we don’t make a bet, we can figure it out by ourselves. I don’t believe that we can’t do it.” Mu Feiruo’s face darkened and seemed to be getting more frustrated.

“Wait, I’ll do it,” Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke up.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were stunned.

“Miss Ye, you don’t need to force yourself into it, this fellow is obviously experienced. If you make a bet with it, our chances are close to zero,” Baili Xi said.

“It is taking advantage of us, it’s trying to cheat you of your bangle.” Jiang Shaobai also spoke up.

“Who cares for that bangle. I’m only doing this because I think that you’re pitiful...” the fat catfish said.

“It’s okay, I’ll bet with you. If you win, I’ll give you the bangle and if you lose, you have to tell us the rules.”

It seemed that Ye Qingtang had already made up her mind.
