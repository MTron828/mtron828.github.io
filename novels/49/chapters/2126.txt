Chapter 2127: Netherworld Academy (3)

When the youth stood in front of Ye Qingtang, he sized her up impassively before speaking.

“You. You can go back.”

The youth’s words attracted the attention of the other youths in his group. They looked toward Ye Qingtang and saw a skinny youth in his twenties. They were speechless.

The Netherworld Academy had an age limit for their students. The skinny youth in front of them was already over the age limit.

Unless “he” had mind-blowing talents, the Netherworld Academy would never accept “him”.

The youths at present were all very powerful. Most of them were at higher levels than Ye Qingtang. That was why they could see at one glance that Ye Qingtang... she was at most only at the Paragon Sixth Heaven level.

Someone at the Paragon Six Heaven level might be able to scrape past the minimum criteria, but this was already the baseline requirement for a youth in his teens. And this person...

This person was already past the age limit.

A person of this age and only at the Paragon Six Heaven level practitioner. It was a right joke that “he” wished to enter the Netherworld Academy. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It was good to know one’s place. A pity that “he” didn’t.

“Leave. You do not fit the admission requirements of my academy.” The youth spoke without any attempt at politeness. There had been many unqualified people who had come forth to seek admission in the past. Most of them would quietly leave after being singled out. But this person remained unmoving and he lost his patience.

“But I didn’t come to participate in the admission exercise,” Ye Qingtang replied pleasantly.

The youth frowned at Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Why are you standing here then? Are you here to make trouble?”

Gazing steadily at the impatient youth, Ye Qingtang replied, “I am here to apply to be a teacher.”

Everyone was dumbstruck by Ye Qingtang’s words. Their condescending expressions instantly changed to shock.

It was as if they were looking at a mad person.

“What did you say?” The youth thought he must have misheard.

“I am here to apply to be a teacher.” Ye Qingtang repeated. After observing the youths who had come to enroll in the Netherworld Academy, Ye Qingtang had changed her plan.

If she couldn’t be a student, she would be a teacher then.

“Pfffttt...”

Someone in the crowd couldn’t hold back his laughter. More laughter soon followed and all the surrounding youths ended up in fits of laughter.

The sounds of laughter spread across the crowd.

The youth’s face instantly became very stern.

“I think you are here to make trouble. If you refuse to leave, I will have no choice but to use force.” The youth frowned even deeper.

Teacher?

Was he dreaming?

He wasn’t even qualified to be a Netherworld Academy student, yet he wanted to be a teacher?! This was probably the greatest joke he had ever heard in his life.

“Wah, so formidable. This brother has ambition. Not bad, I think he must have drunk too much last night and is still suffering from a hangover.” One of the youths guffawed.

Ye Qingtang’s words were like a drunkard’s.

“Brother, you can do it. I support you. Haha!” A bunch of youths laughed uproariously. They didn’t expect to encounter such entertainment while waiting in line.

The world was so big, nothing was impossible.
