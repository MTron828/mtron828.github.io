Chapter 2472: Return of the Emperor (2)

Han looked at the frail and cold demon beside him and asked, “Gu, what do you think?”

Hearing that, the weak-looking demon said, “Don’t you dare say anything about this or mention it to any demon. We never saw whether any divinity appeared with our own eyes.”

“You’re right, Gu. I love your intelligence,” Han said to Gu with a slight smile.

Gu was speechless.

“Let’s go pay our respects.”

Han let the other demons stay to guard the cave as he entered the ancestral hall.

In the Yongle tribe, only the higher-ranked demons were allowed to enter the ancestral hall. The lower-ranked demons could only look at the annual event in the ancestral hall from afar.

…

Ye Qingtang and Lu Yuanxiang hid behind the demon statue as they heard footsteps approaching them.

“Oh my god… this is too thrilling!” Lei Yan’s face was filled with tension. He had never been in such a dangerous situation before.

“Be careful and act based on the situation!” Ye Qingtang ordered.

As soon as the words were out of her mouth, the door to the ancestral hall opened with a loud creak.

Han and Gu had just pushed open the door. The powdered elixirs that they had hidden at the edge of the door scattered across the two demons.

The elixir was colorless and odorless and was hard to detect. Even if the demons were to discover the powder, they would have no idea what it was. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

They suddenly sensed Han staring at the statue within the ancestral hall and everyone turned cold.

Not only Han, but the frail demon was also eying the statue.

As Han stared at the statue, a demon dragon roared. In the next second, all the statues in the ancestral hall opened their eyes.

The eyes of these legendary demons were shining with light and filled with danger.

A gust of cold and ancient air blew towards them.

The Yongle demon emperor in the center seemed as though it was the king of the skies and earth. Just one look from it was enough to make people want to worship it.

Han’s head went blank as he looked at the sight in front of him. How could this be happening?

He suddenly recalled what the three demons guarding the ancestral hall had said… that miracles were going to happen…

“Yongle tribe, my children.”

The Yongle demon emperor’s voice was enough to split the sky.

Han could feel his legs going weak as he lost his balance and collapsed onto the ground.

Was this real?

Their king had not abandoned them!

Their Yongle emperor was back!

But before Han could think of anything else, everything reverted back to its original form. Although the statues were still there, they were no longer moving.

The Yongle emperor and other demons which had been in front of them had vanished as well, as though they were never there in the first place.

“This… What’s happening… how can this be!”

Han’s face was filled with shock. Where was their emperor!

What they had just witnessed was like a dream. He couldn’t tell if it was real or fake. But no matter what, Han could confirm that what he had just witnessed was a miracle, and could not be fake!

“Gu, Gu!”

Han looked at the demon Gu beside him.

“I saw that too.” Gu’s face was filled with shock as well and he knew what Han wanted to tell him.

“Gu, you’re the best, you understand me so well!” Han said excitedly.

Gu was speechless.

But Han froze before he could say anything else.

Because him, Gu froze as well..
