Chapter 936 The Heart of the Heavenly Dao 3

“Qingtang, where did you get this heart from?” The Divine Phoenix looked at Ye Qingtang and questioned.

“Uh…” Confusion filled Ye Qingtang’s face.

Even Ye Qingtang, herself, did not know where exactly the Heart of the Demon God in her body came from. It was as though the Heart of the Demon God was stored in her body when she woke up from sleep.

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was unaware as well, the Divine Phoenix’s expression turned solemn. “Qingtang, most of the inheritance’s ability which I passed to you was absorbed by this heart in your body. What you obtained is only an extremely tiny portion. However, it is fortunate that the bloodline is combined rather completely.”

Ye Qingtang was slightly startled and in disbelief when she heard the Divine Phoenix.

The Heart of the Demon God in her body was not the Heart of the Demon God but the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. Furthermore, this heart even devoured the power of the inheritance which the Divine Phoenix gave her?

Ye Qingtang’s mind was a little confused for a moment; she truly did not know what exactly happened.

The Heart of the Demon God which she had always believed to be, was actually completely unrelated to the Demon God…

“Immortal and Buddha bloodline… Heart of the Heavenly Dao… I see why.” A long time later, the scarlet glow on Ye Qingtang’s body was collected back by the Divine Phoenix.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, please resolve my doubts. What exactly is going on with the Heart of the Heavenly Dao…” Ye Qingtang looked at the Divine Phoenix with desperation to find all her answers.

“The Heart of the Heavenly Dao belongs to the Heavenly Dao. Only the powers of the Heavenly Dao can condense and nurture it. However, you are merely a mortal, but the Heart of the Heavenly Dao is in your body. This is sufficient to show that you became a vessel…” The Divine Phoenix stared at Ye Qingtang meaningfully.

“Vessel?”

Ye Qingtang frowned as she listened to the Divine Phoenix’s explanation.

“I have already died for millions of years and am completely unaware of what is happening outside right now. This is merely my conjecture… Actually, it is difficult for an ordinary person to nurture the Heart of the Heavenly Dao. It is just that you happen to possess the Immortal and Buddha bloodline in your body, which coincidentally contains a trace of the power of the Great Dao. Hence, the Heart of the Heavenly Dao remained in your body for a long time. I don’t know why you have the Heart of the Heavenly Dao, but it is definitely not a good thing to have it in your body,” the Divine Phoenix said with a sigh.

Ye Qingtang did not have anything to retort the Divine Phoenix. Indeed, this heart brought her too many disasters.

Everyone thought that the heart in her body was the Heart of the Demon God and vied for it one after another, resulting in Ye Qingtang’s eventual death in her previous life.

Even Ye Qingtang, herself, never doubted the authenticity of the Heart of the Demon God. If she did not hear it from the Divine Phoenix, she probably would never doubt this heart.

“Qingtang, this Heart of the Heavenly Dao will devour your cultivation endlessly. If you didn’t have this heart, you would probably already be a Yang Lord of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm and not a mere Yin Yang Perfected Lord Third Heaven realm. With the addition of the power of my inheritance, you would already have advanced to a Heavenly Venerate.” Pity was evident in the Divine Phoenix’s voice.

“Lord Divine Phoenix, may I ask if there’s any way to take this heart out?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Divine Phoenix and asked with a frown.

“How long has this heart been in your body? If it’s less than a month, perhaps there’s still a chance for remedy,” the Divine Phoenix said.

“It has long been over a month…” Ye Qingtang replied. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“There’s no way then.” The Divine Phoenix sighed. “This Heart of the Heavenly Dao has been in your body for a long time, and there would be dire consequences once it is taken out.”
