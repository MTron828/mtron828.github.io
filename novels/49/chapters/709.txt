Chapter 710: Extraordinary Flame (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

As the forging of a new weapon was more or less settled, Ye Qingtang finally planned to head to the Falling Sky Valley, but before that, she still had a small matter to settle.

She looked at the silent and obedient blue-haired girl who had been following beside her and was a little awkward.

She could not possibly bring her along, could she?

“Where’s your house? Do you have any family? I’ll let someone send you back if you want?” Ye Qingtang spoke. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The blue-haired girl looked up and replied obediently. “Can you send me to somewhere with a sea, benefactor? You just need to send me to the seaside.”

Sea?

Ye Qingtang was rather curious. This lady was not in a hurry to go home and was looking for a sea?

However, she did not think much about it. There was a sea at the back of the Nine Nights Dynasty, and it was convenient to send this lady there.

Then, Ye Qingtang immediately brought the blue-haired girl to the sea behind the monarch city.

The surface of the vast sea sparkled, and the sea breeze was refreshing.

When the blue-haired girl saw the seawater, a glint flashed across her eyes, and she bowed to Ye Qingtang slightly. “Thank you very much, benefactor.”

Without waiting for Ye Qingtang to return to her senses, the blue-haired girl jumped into the sea directly.

Once the blue-haired girl entered the water, her legs suddenly turned into a gleam of light without delay.

However, in the next second, an icy-blue fish tail flashed across the calm sea surface, and countless water beads scattered in the air. In the reflection of sunlight, the water beads glistened in the colors of the rainbow.

“…” Ye Qingtang was dazed.

What the hell is that?!!

“Mermaid?” The little white tiger mumbled when it saw the fish tail that flashed by.

It was said that in the sea connecting the mainlands, a group of mermaids who lived in the sea still existed, though no one had seen this clan before. Yet unexpectedly…

Ye Qingtang rubbed her temples in speechlessness. What exactly did she rescue?

“Rumors have it that the mermaids are very powerful. Why did she end up being sold by a human?” Ye Qingtang did hear some legends about mermaids in her previous life but had never seen them before. Unexpectedly… after her rebirth, she actually rescued a mermaid after going through a strange combination of events.

The little white tiger said, “That is in the sea. Once a mermaid is on the land, all their skills will be lost unless they wear a special item that can maintain their powers. I reckon that… it was the first time that this mermaid went on the land, and she probably did not know about it.”

“You do know a lot of things.”

“Of course. I’m a Fiendcelestial Beast. What do I not know?!” The little white tiger wagged its tail proudly.

A laugh escaped from Ye Qingtang’s lips as she shook her head. Fortunately, it was on land. If it was in the sea, those slave masters who caught the blue-haired girl would probably be beaten to a pulp by that young girl.

Looking at the figure that gradually swam further away, Ye Qingtang spoke. “Forget it. Let’s head to Falling Sky Valley first.”

The little white tiger did not say anything and followed Ye Qingtang.

Just as they left, the blue-haired girl who had swum a distance suddenly poked her head out from the surface of the sea. However, the gentleness and obedience from before had long disappeared from her exquisite face as a sharp look flashed across her eyes.

Damn it…

Why did she not know that her skills would actually be suppressed on land?

She was really careless and almost got attacked by these humans!

Subsequently, she looked thoughtfully at the back view of the person who was gradually disappearing away from the shore.
