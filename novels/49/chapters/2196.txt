Chapter 2197: Can I Reject (3)

Ye Qingtang had Yun Chen put away the newly-acquired herbs. She then took up the bottles of elixirs on the table and handed them to Mu Ziying and the others. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“This is the phoenix elixir and is best for nourishing mental energy. Ziying, since you are going to be a puppet master, you need to strengthen your mental energy to become even stronger than the usual self.” Ye Qing pointed at the white porcelain bottle in Mu Ziying’s hands.

Mu Ziying’s eyes lit up. Her little face was filled with excitement and she looked at Ye Qing with eyes filled with gratitude.

After learning the Spirit Control Line under Ye Qingtang, Mu Ziying could already control her puppet to do whatever she wanted. But after some time, she would feel fatigued. It was probably due to her lack of mental energy.

Then Ye Qing turned toward Jing Ze. “Your bloodline was just awakened so I prepared this dark yin elixir for you. This pill can nourish bloodlines and it is exactly what you need now.”

Jing Ze clutched the bottle of dark yin elixir tightly, looking very touched. Bowing respectfully, he thanked Ye Qing with a trembling voice. “Thank you, Boss...”

After his bloodline was awakened, Jing Ze’s bleak future was finally looking up. However...

Perhaps his bloodline had been dormant for too long, Jing Ze was unable to exercise full control of it. He was frequently unable to perform as he wanted, and this slowed down his progress.

Mu Ziying and Jing Ze were thrilled after receiving their elixirs. But Nangong Lie and Lei Yan were a different story. Lei Yan and Nangong Lie were both from great family clans and so had more access to elixirs than students from common families like Jing Ze.

“Nourish bloodline? Is Boss having delusions...” Lei Yan felt that Ye Qing must have gone mad.

They knew of elixirs which could nourish mental energy, but...

Nourish bloodlines?

Did Boss come up with this innovation on his own?

Bloodlines were very miraculous and delicate things. According to what Lei Yan knew about bloodlines, it was impossible to influence them in any way with elixirs.

But Ye Qing was in all seriousness pointing at that dark yin elixir and saying that it could nourish bloodlines...

“Phoenix elixir, dark yin elixir... Little Lei, have you heard of them before?” Nangong Lie searched his mind but couldn’t find any medicines with such names.

“Damn you, call me Little Lei again and I will kill you!” Lei Yan looked very fierce but on seeing Ye Qingtang heading over their way, his anger immediately subsided.

“I say, don’t tell me Boss really managed to produce elixirs just like that? He even gave them names... Heaven knows what the hell he just gave us.”

Lei Yan felt rather panicked.

In the blink of an eye, Ye Qingtang had arrived in front of Lei Yan and Nangong Lie.

Lei Yan didn’t receive proper instruction from a young age, and so his foundation was much weaker than his peers. Ye Qing prepared the purple gold elixir for him to stabilize his foundation.

For Nangong Lie, he was restless and impulsive, which prevented him from focusing on his cultivation. As a result, Ye Qing prepared the sky elixir for him.

Ye Qing had refined these elixirs in this alchemy lab over the past few days. Since she wanted them to participate in the Inter-Academy Competition, it was only natural that she prepared them the best she could.

Lei Yan and Nangong Lie had never heard of the purple gold elixir or the sky elixir. They felt that Ye Qing must have gone crazy from all that refining.
