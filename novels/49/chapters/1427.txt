1428 Domain Monarch Jiang Family 3

“Elder Xu, what’s going on?” Jiang Liu frowned deeply.

Why was Elder Xu being so kind to this girl who offended Ye You?

Ye You was surprised as well. She originally thought that Ye Qingtang would be killed by Elder Xu, but now… Not only did Elder Xu not plan to kill Ye Qingtang, but he was coaxing her with such a gentle voice?

“Jiang Liu, this incident is a coincidence. Do you know who this girl is?” Elder Xu said.

Jiang Liu said impatiently, “Isn’t she just a b*tch who offended You?”

A look of impatience immediately emerged on Elder Xu’s face as his expression darkened. “What b*tch! She is a member of the Jiang Family!”

Everyone at the scene was taken aback by what Elder Xu said.

Ye You even widened her eyes in disbelief as she scanned Ye Qingtang suspiciously.

Ye Qingtang is a member of the Jiang Family? How could it be?!

“Elder Xu, are you pulling a joke? She is part of the Jiang Family? How could this be?” Jiang Liu said nonchalantly.

Elder Xu replied. “How will I joke about such a matter? This girl has the Heavenly Demon Bloodline. If she is not a member of the Jiang Family, who else can she be?”

There was a subtle change in Jiang Liu’s expression. Elder Xu was an upright person who shielded his people and attached extremely high importance to the Jiang Family bloodline. It was impossible for him to joke about the Jiang Family bloodline.

“Are you speaking the truth?” Jiang Liu was still rather suspicious.

Elder Xu shot Jiang Liu a dissatisfied look and subsequently turned to look at Ye Qingtang with a kind smile. “Come here, little girl. With me around, no one can harm you. Let him see your Heavenly Demon Bloodline.”

Ye Qingtang seemed to resist Jiang Liu strongly. Although she did go forward, she remained glued to Elder Xu.

Elder Xu felt very sorry for Ye Qingtang when he saw her thin and small frame and her pale face.

It was unknown to all that the pitiful-looking Ye Qingtang was bursting out with laughter on the inside right now. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Don’t they see how dark Ye You’s expression is?

Jiang Liu placed his hand on Ye Qingtang’s wrist, and the Heavenly Demon Bloodline in his body stirred restlessly. In no time, he sensed the resonance from Ye Qingtang’s body!

It was a resonance caused by the same Heavenly Demon Bloodline, and only the Jiang Family possessed it!

Astonishment was written all over Jiang Liu’s face immediately as he looked up at Ye Qingtang in surprise and delight.

“Elder Xu, she really is…”

Elder Xu said right after, “Feel it more carefully.”

Jiang Liu felt it again, and he clearly discovered that the Heavenly Demon Bloodline in Ye Qingtang’s body was actually purer and much more powerful than his.

“This… This is…” Extreme surprise filled Jiang Liu’s eyes.

The Heavenly Demon Bloodline in this girl was actually the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline variant!!

“You should be clear of who she is now, right? Look how fierce and aggressive you were just now. If you really killed this girl, your father would skin you alive.” Elder Xu scoffed.

Jiang Liu felt frightened and fearful instantly. Fortunately, Elder Xu stopped him in time just now. Otherwise… he would have made a huge mistake.

“Sorry, little girl… It was a misunderstanding. You… aren’t startled, are you?” Jiang Liu’s expression changed completely as he looked at her worryingly.

Seeing how Jiang Liu’s attitude changed so swiftly, Ye Qingtang was hysterical with laughter on the inside but kept an emotionless expression on her face.
