Chapter 2040: Return (4)

Having grown up in the Ancient You Clan, You Qiong was no stranger to their ways. But now that he was witnessing this from the other side, he was completely horrified at their methods.

He couldn’t help but think of what Ye Qingtang had said.

She had said that she was going to rescue him.

How laughable.

He was her pawn after all and had lost all use after being discarded by the Ancient You Clan. She would be mad to come and save this useless pawn.

Having witnessed so much of the Ancient You Clan’s cruel methods, he felt that her words were just to comfort her alone. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Bring them out.” A few Ancient You Clan soldiers walked in and grabbed a few bloody cubs from the cage.

The demon cubs started struggling in a frenzy as they dug their blood-stained claws into the ground, but were still dragged out by force. Long claw marks dragged behind them on the ground.

A few cubs would be dragged off each day and those who left never returned.

You Qiong stood up and saw the cubs being brought over to the campfire where Elder Mo forced glowing orbs down their throats.

The light illuminated them from the inside.

After that, the cubs were thrown to the ground where they struggled in pain as though they were about to die. They twitched on the ground for a long time as the light enveloped their body.

Several youths from the Ancient You Clan came out from the tents. Their eyes shone silver as they gazed at the glowing cubs hungrily, and they pounced on them as though they were food.

You Qiong could hear as clear as day the anguished cries of the demon cubs.

They could only look on as their flesh was torn from their bodies by the youths right in front of their eyes and they were eaten alive.

The youths looked like feral beasts.

And the demon cubs were alive throughout the entire ordeal.

They were devoured until all that remained was blood-stained bones, which were thrown into the huge pot on the fire to be made into soup, which the Ancient You Clan people drank as they chatted around the campfire.

You Qiong felt extremely nauseous when he saw this. Fortunately for him, Elder Mo hated him. The most he did was search for him on some days, and he had never shared the demon bone soup before.

He could tell that the soup was precious, and ordinary members of the clan were only spared a scarce amount.

How deplorable...

He looked at the cage full of demon cubs.

Seeing their own kind being devoured alive for them was just like looking into their future. They were all just waiting to suffer the same fate. Some of them had already gone mad from the fear but no one cared whether they were sane or not.

They only cared for their flesh.

It was only now that You Qiong realized why the Ancient You Clan had been capturing so many demon cubs...

He had been cruelly awoken to reality after many days of not knowing the truth.

Lifting his eyes once again, it was only to be greeted by the furious face of Elder Mo, who was looking at him. He had a whip in his hands.

It was stained with blood that You Qiong knew belonged to him.
