1211 The Final Battle 3

“You are merely a lowly ant in this inferior mainland. You are not fit to speak to me. Get lost. Go and wait quietly for your death and enjoy your last moments.” The white-robed old man impatiently waved her away.

However, Ye Qingtang ignored the white-robed old man and looked at little You Yun instead. She said gently, “Little You Yun… be a good girl and come over to me…”

Ye Qingtang’s voice gradually reached little You Yun’s ears. Little You Yun subconsciously turned to study Ye Qingtang, but she made no other movement. Instead, she continued to stand motionlessly in the same spot.

When Ye Qingtang saw little You Yun’s odd expression, a trace of shock surfaced in her eyes.

From Little You Yun’s expression, it was clear that someone was controlling her every move…

Clank!

She drew her long sword with a crisp ringing sound. Ye Qingtang flicked her wrist and used her long sword to slash at the white-robed old man.

When he saw that, the white-robed old man laughed coldly. He sat motionlessly in his spot, letting Ye Qingtang wave her sword at will. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

The next moment, golden ripples suddenly appeared in front of the white-robed old man. The ripples enclosed the entire area.

Boom!

Ye Qingtang’s sword struck the golden ripples.

The ripples did not break. Instead, a huge force forced Ye Qingtang to retreat.

Ye Qingtang steadied herself without losing her composure. Her sword arm shook slightly, and a wound had opened in her hand. Bright red blood seeped from her wound.

Ye Qingtang lifted her eyes to look at the white-robed old man, and she frowned slightly.

The Deputy Clan Master of the Ancient You Clan’s Heavenly Venerate power was much purer than that of You Tong and the other generals. Ye Qingtang powers were at the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Eighth Heaven, and she was no match for him.

It was unrealistic to expect to defeat the Deputy Clan Master of the Ancient You Clan. Her only hope was to flee with little You Yun… otherwise, all the living things in this mainland would vanish, never to exist again…

Boom!

A cold light flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She did not retreat at all but waved her right arm. Her long sword continually slashed at the golden ripples.

However, every time it struck, a huge repulsive force continually pushed back against Ye Qingtang.

“You’re pretty persistent.” A faint smile hung on the white-robed old man’s lips. He looked at Ye Qingtang. “Considering your abilities, I can kill you in an instant. Do you know why I haven’t killed you?”

Ye Qingtang did not reply but continued to slash at the golden ripples.

The white-robed old man laughed coldly. “I haven’t killed you because you are an ant of an inferior mainland. You are not worthy for me to soil my hands. But it will be interesting to watch you struggle and die.”

Ye Qingtang gritted her teeth. The palm of her right hand was completely cracked.

Heavenly Demon Devouring…!

At that moment, Ye Qingtang swiftly called up her Heavenly Demon Devouring power. She used her Devouring Bloodline to destroy the power within the golden ripples as her long sword slashed at them viciously.

There was a huge “boom”, and the golden ripples were destroyed.

At the same time, Ye Qingtang moved with the speed of lightning. She scooped up little You Yun and little Luo Xue and swiftly rushed into the void, fleeing as fast as she could.

Only then did the white-robed old man snap out of his trance.

The white-robed old man had not expected that this girl could actually destroy his shield…

“Humph, I underestimated you… however, you have successfully provoked me… You must die!”

The white-robed old man stood up. He raised his right arm. His Heavenly Venerate power gathered to form a long sword, which immediately pierced the clouds.
