1376 Floating Island 3

“Qi Emperor.” The Yuan Kingdom looked towards the sound. When he saw the middle-aged man, his expression stiffened.

This middle-aged monarch was the Emperor of the Qi Kingdom.

The Yuan Kingdom was at most at the bottom of the list of powerful kingdoms, but the Qi Kingdom was one of the most powerful kingdoms in this mainland.

All the powerful kingdoms in this mainland were disciples of the Dragon Court Sect, and it was natural for the Qi Emperor to be present.

“Yuan Emperor, even if you are unwilling to present your offerings, there is no need to fabricate some lie about an immortal. Immortal… ha… how dare you.” The Qi Emperor looked at Ye Qingtang condescendingly.

Every kingdom knew that the Yuan Kingdom was not in favor with the Dragon Court Sect. No matter how many offerings the Yuan Kingdom made, they could not gain recognition from the Dragon Court Sect.

In the past, the Yuan Kingdom had devised all kinds of ways to get the Dragon Court Sect to acknowledge it, and its yearly offerings had become increasingly lavish.

But the situation had not changed.

Nobody was stupid. After spending so much and getting nothing in return, the Yuan Kingdom was probably unwilling to continue. Thus, it had lied that its kingdom had an immortal so that it could use it as an excuse to stop presenting offerings.

The Yuan Emperor was startled to hear this. He was inwardly unhappy but did not dare to offend the Qi Kingdom.

“Qi Emperor, be careful of what you say. This immortal is completely authentic.”

“Oh?” The Qi Emperor raised one brow slightly and studied Ye Qingtang, a disdainful smile on his face.

“Yuan Emperor, do you think I’m so easily fooled? Immortal… this little girl by your side is only a teenager. Have you ever seen an immortal like that… One cannot claim to be an immortal just based on good looks.” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The Qi Emperor laughed coldly and continued. “You say she’s an immortal, but can she resurrect someone? Or bring a withered tree back to life? Or fly up high and traverse the void?”

Who said their immortal could not fly!

The Yuan Emperor turned pale as the Qi Emperor mocked him.

The Yuan Kingdom could not compare to the Qi Kingdom and the other powerful kingdoms, and they had not been favored by the Dragon Court Sect. As a result, the countries that venerated the Dragon Court Sect also looked down on the Yuan Kingdom, feeling that because the immortal had deserted the Yuan Kingdom, it would be exterminated sooner or later.

The Yuan Emperor was angry and frustrated but did not dare to lose his temper. He could only look at Ye Qingtang as if pleading for her opinion.

But when he looked, the Yuan Emperor was taken aback.

The Qi Emperor had spoken so nastily and completely denied Ye Qingtang’s status as an immortal. However, this immortal did not seem to mind?

The Yuan Emperor’s anger slowly subsided.

That’s right.

Why would an immortal care what an ordinary person thought?

Little did they know that…

The Qi Emperor was exactly right.

Ye Qingtang was no immortal.

She merely held the title of immortal because of the mission that the annoying God of Nature had given her.

The Qi Emperor thought that Ye Qingtang would protest, but when he saw that she did not say a word, he did not think it was unusual.

It would be a great joke if an immortal really appeared in the Yuan Kingdom.

Who knew where the Yuan Emperor had dragged this girl from, to pose as an immortal? How could a fake immortal possibly dare stand up to the Emperor of the Qi Kingdom?

“If the Qi Emperor doesn’t believe us, so be it. Of course an immortal won’t quibble with you.” The Yuan Emperor replied, thinking he had understood the immortal’s loftiness.

The Qi Emperor laughed coldly.

“You’re really obsessed with your pretense. Suit yourself, but let me remind you, you are now on the Dragon Court Sect’s Floating Island. Posing as an immortal will make the Dragon Court Sect unhappy.”
