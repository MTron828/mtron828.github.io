Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Zhou Qu took out the four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills which he did not even plan to give Ye Qingtang, yet unexpectedly… he lost the bait along with the fish. Under everyone’s watch, he could only concede.

“Not bad, Junior Sister Ye,” Zhou Qu said as his lips twitched, and his face darkened to a shocking shade.

In the outer sect, there were quite a few disciples who entered after Zhou Qu and once suffered a loss on this arena. Seeing as to how Zhou Qu lost four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills at one go, they were very satisfied as well.

Simply not wanting to remain there any longer, Zhou Qu turned around and left with a dark face.

Ye Qingtang looked at the four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills that she gained, and her lips curled up. She walked down the arena and to Yun Shu’s side, stuffing the four bottles that she won from Zhou Qu into Yun Shu’s hands.

“What are you doing, junior sister?” Yun Shu asked, confused. He had not recovered from the shock of Ye Qingtang’s victory and could not help but be a little muddle-headed when he saw four bottles of elixirs being stuffed into his hands in the blink of an eye.

“I borrowed your two bottles of elixirs to go up the arena. Now that I’ve won, I’m just returning them to you with interest,” Ye Qingtang beamed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

This action fell into many eyes.

Previously, quite a number of people were still curious where Ye Qingtang got two additional bottles of Xi Spirit Pills from, and they finally understood now.

“No, I didn’t go up the arena, and it’s natural for you to keep this elixir yourself. I’ll just take back my two original bottles.” Yun Shu returned to his senses and was unwilling to gain such benefits without putting any effort.

Moreover, he knew that Ye Qingtang’s spirit root was not considered good and needed the Xi Spirit Pills more than him. Thus, he was unwilling to share a portion of her winnings.

“If Senior Brother Yun doesn’t accept, then I’ll not find you for help in the future,” Ye Qingtang purposely replied in a perplexed tone.

Yun Shu opened his mouth and looked at Ye Qingtang’s wronged expression, not knowing what to do, and could only forcefully accept it.

“Thank you then, junior sister.”

In Lu Xiuwen’s eyes, the interaction between Yun Shu and Ye Qingtang was extremely glaring.

Initially, Lu Xiuwen was still mocking Yun Shu for giving Ye Qingtang his elixirs as it would allow him to establish a greater gap between him and Yun Shu within a month. Lu Xiuwen obtained an additional bottled from Zhou Qu and had three bottles of Xi Spirit Pills in total while Yun Shu would have none.

Yet, unexpectedly…

Not only were the two bottles of Xi Spirit Pills that Yun Shu gave out returned to him, he even got two additional bottles from Ye Qingtang.

In the end, it was Lu Xiuwen who had one less bottle than Yun Shu instead.

All his previous calculations fell out, and Lu Xiuwen almost choked to death.

The sarcasm on his face vanished into thin air immediately, and his expression was even darker than Zhou Qu who left hurriedly. Without saying anything, he turned around and left, unwilling to spare both Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu another look.

“Ye Qingtang is indeed smart. Yun Shu seems to be the young master of Liu Yun family clan, and this act cozied up to him. She is really scheming…”

Most people were more or less unhappy as they saw that Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu gained two additional bottles of Xi Spirit Pills without doing anything.

To them, it was obviously best to use the Xi Spirit Pills for themselves.

However, Yun Shu’s family background was outstanding and was indeed a person that one would want to win over. Thus, they had already conjectured the motive of Ye Qingtang’s act.

Ye Qingtang was not at all bothered by this.

What had her kindness to a person got anything to do with their identity or background?

It was simply her liking only.

After observing from aside all along and witnessing the outcome of the competition, Lin Long showed a worried expression, though she silently left without saying anything.
