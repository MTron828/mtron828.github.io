Chapter 398: Think Highly Of You (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios !

It was a casual mention by the elderly, but Elder Mo’s heart wavered.

There were indeed many weapons that urgently required repair, but the grade of those swords was not low. In the Sword Spirit Workshop, only the warden had the skills to repair it, but he was not the only elder in Xuanling Sect. Other elders, as well, would request old Duan for help, and if he continued waiting just like that, god knows when would all his weapons be repaired.

If he could have a blacksmith master to repair only his weapons…

Elder Mo had this thought immediately, but… he still wanted to test Ye Qingtang’s forging skills.

Elder Mo secretly ordered someone to bring a brocade box from his weapon chamber and then walked out of the secret chamber with the elderly.

Ye Qingtang was held up by the warden for quite some time and was about to leave. However, before she could take a step, an aged voice suddenly sounded behind her.

“Little girl, hold on.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A smile entered the incharge’s eyes when he saw the people who came.

Ye Qingtang turned around and saw the elderly from that day walking to her with a smile. There was a sage-like senior was beside him, and after seeing his face, Ye Qingtang could not help but be slightly startled.

Internal Affairs Elder, Elder Mo?

On the day of the inner sect assessment, Ye Qingtang once met Elder Mo when he returned. However, Elder Mo never noticed her presence then.

“Greetings senior, Elder Mo.” Ye Qingtang bowed calmly, though she still found the situation strange.

“Little girl, I saw you cooling the Remnant Ice Sword with frost condensate just now. Did you think of this method yourself?” The elderly had his hands behind him as he beamed at Ye Qingtang with friendly eyes.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang replied.

The elderly nodded in satisfaction and subsequently looked at Elder Mo, who remained silent beside him.

“Elder Mo happens to have an item that requires repair. Since you’re here, why don’t you see whether you can help him?”

The elderly said casually, but Ye Qingtang was a little taken aback when she heard it. She instinctively looked at the emotionless Elder, utterly confused.

In her previous life, Ye Qingtang had entered the inner sect before but had only heard of and never seen Elder Mo, who held a high position and great authority. She only knew that this Elder Mo was the highest skilled elder amongst all the elders and was only second to the Grand Elder and Sect Master. Moreover, the Sect Master and Grand Elder long had the intention of allowing Elder Mo to succeed the position of Sect Master and to become the new Sect Master of Xuanling Sect.

As expected, those few blacksmiths’ faces turned extremely ugly after the elderly spoke.

Although Ye Qingtang did use frost condensate to solve a difficult problem that they could not solve, this could not mean anything.

They admitted that Ye Qingtang did know some forging techniques, but that was it.

Now, the elderly actually asked that girl to help Elder Mo to repair his weapons in front of them blacksmiths. Was this not a slap in their faces?

Could their skills be worse than an inner sect disciple?

The blacksmiths were dissatisfied and looked at the incharge, wanting to see his reaction to the matter. Yet, unexpectedly…

“Little girl, since Elder Mo need help, just give it a try.” The incharge did not even notice his workers’ dissatisfied expressions and chimed in after seeing through the intentions of the elderly and Elder Mo.
