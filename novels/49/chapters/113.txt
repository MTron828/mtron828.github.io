Chapter 114: Seven Stars on Moon (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang was unaware of how many lightsabers she had hit away already. As the red light in the sky faded bit by bit, Ye Qingtang still could not be at ease.

She did not forget that this was a sword array… a sword array that would continue on for eternity as long as it was not shut down.

When she hit the last lightsaber away, she suddenly heard the middle-aged man’s screams.

“Ye Qingtang! Quickly take this time to leave the Eight Trigrams Stage!” The middle-aged man, who was still unable to shut down the sword array, reminded her immediately without caring about anything else when he saw Ye Qingtang singlehandedly blocking the first wave of attack.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything else and found a good opportunity to flee from the Eight Trigrams Stage.

However, just as her toes reached the sides of the Eight Trigrams Stage, a red light emerged from the sides of the Eight Trigrams Stage.

A strong air stream violently flowed through Ye Qingtang.

The entire Eight Trigrams Stage was enclosed by a circle of red light instantly!

Ye Qingtang’s heart was in her mouth immediately.

The sword in the stone definitely had discovered the presence of the Heart of the Demon God. Otherwise, why would there be such a big move to trap her on the Eight Trigrams Stage so persistently until she dies!

The middle-aged man below the Eight Trigrams Stage was taken aback as well. He had been in Xuanling Sect for many years and was in charge of the assessment many times, but he had never seen the sword array become like this.

And at that instant, a piercing sound was sounded by the sword in the stone once again.

This time, lightsabers numbering more than ten times the lightsabers in the first wave suddenly flew up the sky, and in the encirclement of the red light, the surrounding was tainted by the scarlet light like fresh blood, resulting in a patch of crimson.

Ye Qingtang looked up. Her black and white eyes reflected countless scarlet lightsabers as though the color of blood filled her eyes. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

At that very instant, the little black ball within the Heart of the Demon God was utterly panicking. It could feel the danger that Ye Qingtang was going to face. It wanted to take over the little lightning dragon’s body and block everything for Ye Qingtang but realized that the little lightning dragon’s body was still frail and could not withstand the little black ball’s occupation since the little black ball took over the little lightning dragon’s body once on the journey here.

Mother! Mother!!

The little black ball could only roar irritably within the Heart of the Demon God.

Countless lightsabers hovered above the Eight Trigrams Stage. Under the glimmer of the red light, the middle-aged man outside the Eight Trigrams Stage was completely taken aback.

This was it.

This was really it!

Even if Ye Qingtang had three heads and six limbs, she would still be unable to block this wave of the absolute-kill sword array!

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath, narrowing her eyes as she tightened her grip on the sword in her hand.

She…

definitely could not die here!

Just when the lightsabers were about to attack, a loud blast suddenly sounded from the sword in the stone!

Along with the piercing blast, the sky of lightsabers instantly became an illusion, fading away as they flew down.

Ye Qingtang watched the tip of a lightsaber, which was just under her nose, turn into a ball of red light and fall on the ground quietly.

The red light that enveloped the Eight Trigrams Stage completely vanished at that moment. Instantly, the entire Eight Trigrams Stage returned to calmness as though the life-and-death struggle a while ago ceased to exist.

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised but did not dare to rush into any action, and her hand which held the sword was on alert for a long time.

Outside the Eight Trigrams Stage, the middle-aged man who was covered in goosebumps suddenly felt a slight tremble in the psychic tablet.

“The sword array is turned off, let her come down.” Elder Lin’s slightly exhausted voice sounded from the psychic tablet
