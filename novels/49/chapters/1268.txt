Chapter 1269: Unable To Enjoy (1)

Black Flame Worms were not considered rare in the Central Mainland, but after the Undead Clan came to the Central Mainland, the Black Flame Worm became extremely scarce over time.

Currently, a Black Flame Worm could be said to be priceless and hard to come by to the Undead Clan.

It was exactly because of this fact that Ming Gu would present this precious treasure to Ye Qingtang.

However…

Ye Qingtang’s stomach churned as she looked at that black, fleshy worm.

How could she forget the Undead Clan’s exquisite taste…

“Ah Yao?” Ming Gu’s pitch-dark orbs seemed to be filled with countless stars that sparkled brilliantly as he looked at Ye Qingtang expectantly like a little puppy waiting to be praised.

Ye Qingtang tried her best to keep the smile on her face though she was losing it on the inside.

Seeing this sight, the little white tiger turned its back extremely disloyally and muffled a snicker with its paws.

“Ah Yao, although this Black Flame Worm is not as juicy as those you ate before, it still tastes pretty nice. Are you dissatisfied that it is not big enough…” The light in Ming Gu’s eyes gradually faded when he saw that Ye Qingtang had not eaten it after some time.

Was this not big enough?

Looking at the Black Flame Worm that was several inches bigger than a roasted suckling pig, Ye Qingtang was more than speechless.

Exactly what kind of taste did the Holy Lord of Shadows have that she could actually eat such a thing?

“I am just very touched…” Ye Qingtang summoned her might to suppress the urge to gag, and she beamed at Ming Gu. “There are not many Black Flame Worms now, but you still took the trouble to find it for me.”

Hearing that, Ming Gu’s eyes lit up instantly, and he smiled adorably.

“As long as it’s something that you like, I will find it for you.” Seeming to have thought something, Ming Gu placed the Black Flame Worm on the ground, took out a necklace that was chained with golden skulls, and presented it to Ye Qingtang.

“Ah Yao, this is a necklace that I chained for you. I am giving… giving it to you…” Ming Gu placed the necklace before Ye Qingtang bashfully.

Ye Qingtang experienced complicated feelings when she saw that accessory which was chained up using golden-painted skulls.

How exactly was she going to accept the Undead Clan’s sense of aesthetics?

However…

Compared to eating worms, this necklace had greater acceptability to Ye Qingtang.

As long as it was not eating worms, she was willing to do anything else!

Ye Qingtang received the necklace and wore it, causing Ming Gu to smile even brighter. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

At the same time, Ye Qingtang saw that Black Flame Worm with a strong will to live was attempting to wriggle away, and a wave of relief washed over her.

However…

A loud bang was heard.

A black light flashed across from Ming Gu’s hand and immediately struck the route that the Black Flame Worm was heading toward. The Black Flame Worm, startled by the loud sound, rolled on the ground, and its fleshy body trembled.

“It almost ran away.” Ming Gu ran toward the Black Flame Worm, picked it up, and placed it before Ye Qingtang. His large, sparkling eyes were filled with expectancy as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little.

Was she unable to avoid this today?

Currently, only a handful of the Undead Clan fully believed her identity as the Holy Lord of Shadows without a doubt, and one of them was Ming Gu.

If she caused Ming Gu to have any suspicions…

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath secretly and smiled. “Let’s eat it together.”

Wasn’t it just eating a worm!

So be it!

Ming Gu looked as though he was overwhelmed by an unexpected favor. Without waiting for Ye Qingtang to say anything else, he immediately carried a stool over, slammed the Black Flame Worm on the table, and sat in his seat obediently.
