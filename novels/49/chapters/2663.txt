Chapter 2664 Devouring The Sun (1)

The battle between Han Cangming and the Paragon became increasingly intense. However, Ye Qingtang could clearly see that the Paragon was only defending passively and rarely took the initiative to attack. It seemed that Han Cangming’s domain had a huge impact on the Paragon.

“Rumble, rumble, rumble!”

“Rumble, rumble, rumble!”

Just as Ye Qingtang was at a loss of what to do, a loud explosion rang out from somewhere which hurt her eardrums. Even Han Cangming and the Paragon were stunned by the explosion.

Swoosh!

In the next second, a huge fireball erupted with sun-like light and descended from the

sky.

The Paragon hurriedly retreated and arrived beside Ye Qingtang. Before Ye Qingtang could react, the Paragon grabbed her and charged into the sky.

“Sister Ye Yue, be careful!” The Paragon frowned as she warned Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Boom!”

The fireball, which shone like the sun, slammed heavily into the ground.

A deep pit that was almost 300 meters wide appeared on the ground below. Cracks radiated from the pit which was filled with endless flames. The temperature was extremely high as if it could melt everything.

“What’s going on?” Ye Qingtang was shocked and looked around.

“I’m not sure…” The Paragon shook her head. A strange look appeared in her eyes.” How can there be such divine power in this world…”

“Divine power?”

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback by what the Paragon said. Was she implying that this was done by a human?

Ye Qingtang had thought it was a natural phenomenon. “How can a human… manipulate the power of nature?” Ye Qingtang asked in surprise.

Swoosh!

As Ye Qingtang spoke, another few huge fireballs shot towards them.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang realized that the sky was filled with fireballs. They fell in all directions like a storm and were not directed at a single person.

“Boom!”

A fireball struck the mountains and shattered the entire mountain range. They slammed into the ground, destroying the entire area.

This divine power could be considered invincible. Even Immortal Emperors had no choice but to avoid it.

At that moment, all the supreme forces in the canyon were alarmed. They gazed toward the horizon in unison.

“What is that?”

An elder of the Great Immortal Temple pointed toward the horizon. His expression changed slightly.

“A dog?!”

Somewhere in the canyon, the Heavenly Emperor frowned as he also looked toward the horizon.

Who would have thought that the cause of this disaster would be a huge demon dog?

The demon dog’s body was indescribable. Its entire body was yellow, and its eyes were filled with ruthlessness and viciousness. What was even more unbelievable was that this demonic dog was actually eating the sun. “Am I seeing things…? A yellow dog eating the sun?!”

“What’s going on…” “It is the one causing this natural disaster?” “What kind of demon is it? It’s so terrifying!”

“Is that really just a dog?”
