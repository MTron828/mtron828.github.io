Chapter 915 Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix (3)

“How hateful!”

Yin Yang Child stood up in helpless rage.

“This is the Divine Phoenix’s land of inheritance. How can you behave so impudently here?” Ye Qingtang cast Yin Yang Child a look and said coldly.

Indeed, her speculation was right.

She found it strange since just now. Given the conflict between Yin Yang Child and Black and White Holy Son, how could they remain at the same place in peace?

Perhaps…

It was not that they suddenly decided to bury the hatchet but that they were simply forbidden from attacking each other within this screen in the land of inheritance.

Coming to think of it, the supreme-grade inheritance here had great spiritual wisdom, and trialists favored upon by the inheritance were completely forbidden from attacking each other. Otherwise, if someone’s skills overrode the others and he killed everyone else, wouldn’t the inheritance belong to him without a doubt? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

As such, once any trialist attacks another trialist in such a land of inheritance, the inheritance would step in to prevent such an incident from happening.

No matter how powerful one was, he was still unable to unleash his skills to harm others once in this land of inheritance.

Otherwise, not mentioning the conflict between Yin Yang Child and Black and White Holy Son, the other people within the screen would probably already have fought each other with their lives to contend for the inheritance.

How would there still be so many people standing around foolishly?

Ye Qingtang sensed the abnormality from the start and vaguely guessed the rules in this land of inheritance. As such, even if she saw that Yin Yang Child wanted to kill her, she was never anxious.

Anyway, they had already entered the land of inheritance, and all Yin Yang Child could do was to glare at her no matter how annoyed he was.

“Hahaha, Yin Yang Child, you still have the temperament of a child. She agitated you on purpose, and you still foolishly attacked her.” A teenager in black armor mocked when he saw Yin Yang Child being thrown onto the ground forcefully by the power of the Divine Phoenix.

“Black and White Holy Son, I didn’t think that you would actually treat this kind of person as your opponent. Isn’t it too boring?” Without giving Yin Yang Child a chance to speak, the teenager in black armor commented again with a smile as he looked at a good-looking man, whose hair reached his waist.

Upon hearing that, the good-looking man, who was referred to as Black and White Holy Son, shot a distant look at the teenager. “You talk too much.”

“Do I?” The teenager sneered. He was about to continue saying something, but a solemn voice rang in the air.

“Any trialists who attacks others again will be expelled from here.”

Everyone could not help but be taken aback when they heard it. The inheritance of the Divine Phoenix finally appeared…

The Divine Phoenix’s voice appeared only for one moment and disappeared without a trace.

“That’s strange. Didn’t the Divine Phoenix already die in the battle? Why did the Divine Phoenix’s voice appear here?”

“Right… Could it be that the Divine Phoenix did not even die and was searching for an inheritor here instead?”

Everyone was curious about the appearance of the Divine Phoenix’s voice, and there were many discussions about it.

“The Divine Phoenix did pass on. However, such supreme beings can still keep a tiny trace of its spirit alive even if it had died for millions of years. This remaining spirit is the protector and ruler of the Divine Phoenix’s land of inheritance. One must obtain its permission in order to obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. Anyone who snatches by force will face a tragic ending regardless if the person was a Holy Venerate or Holy Venerate.”

An emotionless voice rang at that moment.

Upon hearing it, everyone looked in the direction of the source of the voice.

A man was sitting cross-legged by a stream. His long, purple hair reached his waist while his eyes remained shut.
