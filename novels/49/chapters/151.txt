Qin Huan quickly returned to his senses and looked at Ye Qingtang over and over again. However, there was neither the slightest trace of discrimination nor belittlement in his eyes, but a burst of shock.

As a new disciple, it was already very fierce and fiery of her to be able to knock out Zhou Qu. What was scarier was that she was still only a red spirit root.

What was this girl?

How could a red spirit root still be so fierce?!

“What’s wrong with a red spirit root? I think that this isn’t a big deal. If Junior Sister Ye is skilled enough, why bother about the spirit root? This isn’t even about selecting spirit roots, why do you care so much?” Qin Huan could not help but retort when he noticed Meng Sheng’s dissatisfaction.

He thought that Ye Qingtang was very awesome. Why were these people all so snobby to simply judge her based on her spirit root when they had not seen her abilities?

Narrow-minded!

Really too narrow-minded!

Ye Qingtang originally saw Gu Yanqiu’s awkward expression and mentally prepared herself for the worst—that she might not be able to take part in this mission. Yet unexpectedly… Qin Huan, who seemed unreliable, actually became the first person to speak up for her.

“Junior Brother Qin, the quality of a spirit root is related to our cultivation. What is wrong whether I care about it or not? Furthermore… we have already reduced the number of people in this mission. Other teams in the outer sect formed a team of at least twelve to thirteen people to deal with a level 6 demonic beast, but we only have ten. If we bring a new disciple with an inferior spirit root, what are the chances of success? This mission would take at least half a month’s time, and if we fail, who is to bear the loss of this half a month?” Meng Sheng did not back down at all.

“How would you know we would fail if you have not tried before?” Qin Huan asked in return.

Meng Sheng was about to say something, but Gu Yanqiu spoke at that moment.

“I have already decided on the members. What Junior Brother Qin said is right, and I understand Junior Brother Meng’s concern as well. However, we are going to set off tomorrow, and changing members at the last minute would be even more inappropriate. As the initiator of this mission, I guarantee to compensate everyone’s loss should we fail this mission. When I complete missions with you all in the future, I will automatically make up to everyone with my Xuanming points. How about that?” Gu Yanqiu said calmly, though there was a hint of toughness in his tone.

Meng Sheng frowned slightly. Even if he had any more dissatisfactions, it was difficult to continue arguing after Gu Yanqiu mentioned about the compensation.

On the other hand, the other disciples did not feel too strongly about this. While everyone was indeed suspicious of Ye Qingtang’s abilities, they still had some trust in the people that Gu Yanqiu selected. Moreover… when a new disciple joined the team, she would definitely be given a little less once the mission is completed. In this way, they would be given more, and there was nothing much to object to.

As the initiator of the mission and the team leader, Gu Yanqiu would be given a higher percentage of Xuanming points. Hence, since he said he would compensate them should they fail, they would obviously accept it as they trusted Gu Yanqiu.

Without any objections, the matter was settled like this.

Ye Qingtang did not say anything from start to end. Rather, it was Gu Yanqiu who turned to Ye Qingtang after persuading everyone else and said apologetically, “Junior Sister Ye, I’m sorry. Just now, I… was just a little shocked and neglected you. I hope you will excuse me.”

Gu Yanqiu did not speak up for her immediately when Meng Sheng questioned Ye Qingtang just now, and regardless, Ye Qingtang was someone he found and personally invited. Thus, he was naturally guilty.
