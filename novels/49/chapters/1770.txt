“How many times have I told you that this skin is too small for you,” Hu scolded.

That demon looked very aggrieved. A piteous expression on that ugly face gave him a weird look that seemed cute but grotesque.

“Can’t I just try it on...”

“No.” Hu instantly rejected him.

She might be wrong but Ye Qingtang just felt that Hu was exceptionally protective toward her.

Having been reprimanded by Hu, that demon instantly hunkered down obediently. The other fiendish demons couldn’t help laughing at the scene.

“Ba, forget it. apart from little fiendish demons and the more slender adult ones, no one else can wear that skin. You already know that this is Hu’s most beautiful piece of skin. He will kill you if you destroy it...”

Ye Qingtang’s heart stopped as she shot the imperious-looking Hu a sideways glance.

She was still wondering why Hu appeared exceptionally protective of her. It was actually because he liked her skin?

Fiendish demons could shrink their bodies but only to a certain limit. Ye Qingtang was of a slim build and no matter how those tall, strapping demons tried to shrink themselves, it was impossible for them to get down to her small size.

Hu felt Ye Qingtang’s skin was very beautiful but he couldn’t wear it. Nevertheless, he could still admire it while it was on her. He would not allow other demons to destroy that skin.

So it was probably because coveted her skin that Hu brought Ye Qingtang back to the eastern camp.

For the first time in her life, Ye Qingtang felt that her skin was really useful.

The bunch of fiendish demons hung around for a bit longer before being ordered to go complete their respective tasks. The endless battles during this period meant that they didn’t have much time to waste. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Ye Qingtang secretly heaved a sigh of relief. With Hu’s protection, no other demon would dare to take her skin. Otherwise, her identity would be exposed and she would suffer a fate worse than death.

The bunch of fiendish demons busied about their own tasks. Meanwhile, the weakling Ye Qingtang mostly spent her time with the little fiendish demons. In contrast to the disdain that the adult demons felt toward her, those little fiendish demons were full of fear and respect for their “Great Sage”.

Ye Qingtang was about to discreetly discard that piece of demon flesh when there was a sudden tremor near the entrance of the camp. The faces of the little fiendish demons instantly turned grim.

“What’s happening?” The little fiendish demons instinctively felt that some kind of danger had arrived, and they huddled together in a trembling ball.

Ye Qingtang glanced up and saw a massive shadow cast over the entrance. A suffocating aura fell upon the entire camp.

“It’s a Soul-Devouring Beast!” One of the fiendish demons cried out.

The shadow at the entrance of the camp was like a hovering gigantic storm cloud. On closer inspection, no traces of a monster could be seen. That shadow was just one big mass of dark, muddy swirls, inching bit by bit into the camp.

All the vegetation in the path of that mass of dark swirls withered and died, leaving behind a trail of scorched remains.

Ye Qingtang was stunned by the sight of that huge mass of dark swirls.

The Soul-Devouring Beast was an extremely powerful monster. It didn’t have a solid body and was just made up of formless muddy swirls. The more powerful a Soul-Devouring Beast was, the bigger the mass of swirls.
