Many believers looked towards Ye Qingtang in sarcasm and discontentment after Emperor Qi finished his words.

The believers from other kingdoms found it ridiculous that there was an immortal in the Yuan Kingdom. However, they did not expect that the Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom would bring the fake immortal to the Floating Island. They were really trying to be humiliated.

Ye Qingtang’s expression did not change at all after hearing that. She just took a glimpse at Emperor Qi.

“What do you think, immortal?” Emperor Qi smiled in a very fake way and spoke. It was not difficult to hear that his “immortal” had a different meaning.

“Stop it, Emperor Qi. Today is the pilgrimage day of the Dragon Court Sect. They have the priority here. Are you trying to create troubles by asking Immortal Su to show her ability?” The Yuan Kingdom Emperor was not easily fooled this time.

Emperor Qi humped. An immortal’s voice came out from the jade door before he said anything.

“Emperor Yuan.”

The Yuan Kingdom Emperor’s face was filled with respect when he was called out by the Immortal.

“I heard that there’s an immortal from your kingdom. Is that true?” The Immortal tried to speak in a superior way, but everyone was in awe.

“Yes… It’s true.” The Yuan Kingdom Emperor replied immediately.

“Oh? Is the immortal the lady beside you?” The Immortal asked.

The Yuan Kingdom Emperor was slightly stunned. The Immortal was in the jade door. Others could not see his appearance, but he could see everyone in the palace clearly.

“Yes, this is immortal Su. If she was not invited by the Dragon Court Sect this time, I would not be able to come along.”

Others might not be able to see whether Ye Qingtang was an Immortal.

However, the immortal in the Dragon Court Sect must be able to tell. If not, why would he invite her here on the pilgrimage day?

The Yuan Kingdom Emperor took a glimpse at Emperor Qi proudly.

The invitation from the Dragon Court Sect was the best proof.

There was a short silence in the jade door before the Immortal spoke again.

“Emperor Yuan, I think that you’re mistaken.”

The Yuan Kingdom Emperor was only proud for a second before he was stunned after hearing the words.

“Immortal, what do you mean by that…”

“I did not say anything about an invitation.”

“What?” The Yuan Kingdom Emperor was surprised.

Not an invitation?

How could this be!

They brought the invitation letter from the Dragon Court Sect here.

“I heard rumors saying that there is an Immortal in the Yuan Kingdom. Normal people cannot challenge the prestige of Immortals. We will never tolerate anyone who pretends to be an immortal,” the Immortal said in a dignified way.

However, every word was signaling that Ye Qingtang was a fake Immortal.

Actually, there were many people who disguised themselves as immortals before in order to get respect and worships from others. They were all exposed by the Dragon Court Sect and executed eventually.

The Emperor of the Yuan Kingdom was stunned, and his expression was very unpleasant. Emperor Qi and other believers’ faces were filled with sarcasm. Aversion could be seen clearly in their eyes.

The Immortal spoke again. “If she is really an Immortal, we will definitely welcome her. However… if she offends the prestige of the Immortals, I doubt whether she knows the consequences.”

The Immortal then spoke to Ye Qingtang.

“Immortal Su, please show your skills to prove yourself. If not, everyone will doubt your identity.”

It seemed that the Immortal was nice, but his tone was very uncompromising.
