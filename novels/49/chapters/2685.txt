Chapter 2686: Fourth Domain (6)

No one knew what the Fourth Domain looked like now, but it must be extremely dangerous.

Not long ago, the Fourth Domain was the most mysterious domain. It was touted as a hallmark Holy Land for the supreme experts of this world. However, there were not many supreme experts who could truly enter the Fourth Domain.

In fact, Ye Qingtang had even seen in the historical records that when the Fourth Domain was at its peak, it was not even just that of a True God, but could be compared to a real Immortal God.

No matter how powerful a person was, even if they had the bodies of Immortal Emperors and had ascended to the peak status, they were still humans in the end. No one could even comprehend the concept of an Immortal God.

“Indeed. This trip might be extremely dangerous. Apart from the dangers of the Fourth Domain, you still have to face the disciples and juniors from the other supreme factions. You can’t let your guard down,” said the Absolute Heaven Saint.

Before anyone could say anything, the Absolute Heaven Saint’s gaze landed on Xie Jun again. He frowned and said, “Especially you. The Dragon Emperor Clan has no intention of letting you off. There’s also the Heavenly Saint Cult.”

Xie Jun smiled and said, “Master, you’ve already nagged me hundreds of times. No matter how slow-witted I am, I do remember your words and treat them seriously.”

Ye Qingtang was not familiar with the Dragon Emperor Clan of this era, but she had been in this era for several years now and knew a thing or two.

The Dragon Emperor Clan was also one of the top factions in this era. If Ye Qingtang guessed correctly, the Dragon Emperor Clan in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain should be a branch of this main faction.

However, Ye Qingtang did not expect Xie Jun to have offended the Dragon Emperor Clan. According to the Dragon Emperor Clan’s vengeful character, if not for the Absolute Heaven Saint’s presence, they would not let Xie Jun off. Of course, it was a headache. Was there anyone in this group who would not make her worry…

“Ye Yue.” The Absolute Heaven Saint’s gaze landed on Ye Qingtang.

“Uncle-Master.” Ye Qingtang immediately walked to the Absolute Heaven Saint’s side and nodded.

“During this trip, you must keep an eye on them. If anyone is disobedient and causes trouble, you have to record it down and report it back,” said the Absolute Heaven Saint. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Ye Qingtang looked a little awkward. She gazed at her seemingly harmless senior brothers and sisters. How should she manage them… After all, they were all stronger than her and had joined the sect before her… this mission assigned by the Absolute Heaven Saint seemed a little difficult.

“Junior Sister Ye Yue, don’t worry. I will definitely help you manage whoever is disobedient.” Lan Shan walked to Ye Qingtang’s side and smiled.

However, the Absolute Heaven Saint glanced at Lan Shan and said to Ye Qingtang, “Especially your Senior Brother Lan Shan. Take good care of him and don’t let him cause trouble.”

Lan Shan, “…”

“Don’t worry, Uncle-Master. I will not let anyone mess around.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Uncle-Master, the Fourth Domain has been a dead zone for a long time. There are probably no living things in it anymore. So I don’t think we will encounter any danger, right?” One of the Great Immortal Temple disciples asked the Absolute Heaven Saint.

“All of you, remember that no one has truly stepped into the Fourth Domain before. Therefore, no matter what, you must maintain the highest level of vigilance. I don’t care about the other factions, but not a single disciple of the Great Immortal Temple can be lost,” said the Absolute Heaven Saint sternly.
