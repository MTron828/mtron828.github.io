1426 Domain Monarch Jiang Family 1

That middle-aged man was Jiang Liu, the son of the current Domain Monarch. In terms of seniority, he was considered Ye You’s uncle.

Other than Jiang Liu, there were other elderlies in the hall. They had serious expressions as they listened to Ye You narrate their encounter with the Ancient You Clan outside Burnt City.

“After Ancient You Clan obtained the Spiritual Abode, their powers increased rapidly, and now, they actually dare to provoke the dignity of the Jiang Family,” an elderly said coldly.

“We still have to wait for the Family Master to come out from seclusion to make a decision on this matter. Send people to watch the Ancient You Clan first,” said Jiang Liu. “You, you were startled today, but luckily, you’re safe. Instead, why did Elder Xu not return with you two?”

Ye You naturally would not say that she asked Elder Xu to settle the matter with Ye Qingtang because of her personal grudge, and so she subsequently explained. “Elder Xu said that he still has some things on; thus, he wanted Xun and me to return first.”

Jiang Liu did not think too much about it and nodded slightly.

At this instant, the servants of the Jiang Family suddenly reported that Elder Xu had returned.

“Elder Xu has returned, but he also brought two people with him. One of them looks like he’s from the ape clan, and the other is an ordinary lady.”

Ye You had a perplexed expression when she heard the servants’ reports.

“Why did Elder Xu bring them back?” Ye Xun was a little surprised. She originally thought that Elder Xu would kill Ye Qingtang and Beidou Demon Lord directly, but why did he bring them back?

“Do you all know them?” Jiang Liu’s gaze shifted to Ye You and Ye Xun.

“Sister You went to Burnt City today, and a Bone of the Dragon Breath finally caught her eyes, but it was eventually snatched away by that lady and the ape.” Ye Xun replied.

“Xun.” Ye You interrupted Ye Xun immediately, and there seemed to be a look of disapproval in her eyes.

“This is a small matter, and I still had to trouble Elder Xu. It is already very difficult for me to return to the Jiang Family. I don’t wish to trouble others because of my matters.” Ye You looked at Jiang Liu apologetically like an obedient child.

Ye Xun noticed Ye You’s behavior and immediately embellished the story. “Sister You, Elder Xu was scared that you suffered an injustice. Forget it if someone else snatched the Bone of the Dragon Breath, but that Ye Qingtang has been opposing you since we were in the First Mainland. You finally returned to your birth family and came to the Central Mainland, but she still chased after you to cause you troubles. Who can tolerate this…” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Jiang Liu frowned. His father had always felt like he owed Ye You, an abandoned talent, a lot. Thus, he was extremely dissatisfied when he heard that someone dared to bully Ye You.

“It’s also good that he brought them back. It would have been too easy on them if they were killed directly. Rest assured, You. Since you have returned to the Jiang Family, no one can let you suffer any injustice. Perhaps Elder Xu wants you to seek revenge personally.” Jiang Liu patted Ye You’s shoulder and looked at her with a kind smile.

Ye You pursed her lips and nodded lightly.

“Uncle, you and grandfather are so nice to me.”

“You are a child of the Jiang Family. Of course you are fit to receive this good treatment,” Jiang Family said with a smile.

The senior members of the Jiang Family nodded in satisfaction at the sight. They had a good feeling about Ye You and felt that she was a good child.

“Let’s go. I will accompany you to seek your revenge,” Jiang Liu said with a smile.

Ye You nodded as she looked down slightly to hide the snicker in her eyes.
