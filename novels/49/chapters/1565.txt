Chapter 1566 Skills 1

Ye Qingtang arrived at Jiang Yu’s study room. Jiang Yu was frowning.Jiang Yu looked at Ye Qingtang in a complicated way. One of the reasons why he gave Ye Qingtang honor points was due to the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline in her.She came to the Taiyuan Valley really late. The honor points served as a capital for her to build her foundation.

It was good news to the Jiang Family that Ye Qingtang had the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline. He did not want to miss it.

However...

He felt pity for her as he thought about the talent test results.

“You were outside for many years, and since you’re back to the Jiang Family now, you need to learn from the basics.” Jiang Yu pulled back from his thoughts and said.

“There’re many skills in the Jiang Family, but all of them are derived from the same basics. No matter how to cultivate our Heavenly Demon Bloodline, we still need some foundations. Today, I’m going to teach you a few sets of skills.” Jiang Yu stared at Ye Qingtang seriously.

No matter how talented Ye Qingtang was, she still belonged to the Jiang Family. Even if she could not reach the peak, she still deserved to learn the skills. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang was also very serious. She had acquired the mutant Heavenly Demon Bloodline for quite some time, but she still did not know how to control it.

Jiang Yu was satisfied with Ye Qingtang’s serious expression. “There’re many skills in the world. The Jiang Family uses four skills as the foundation: finger technique, movement technique, swordplay technique, and palm technique. Only when you master these four sets of techniques will you be able to actually utilize your bloodline.”

“Come over.” Jiang Yu nodded his head at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang took a step forward. Jiang Yu folded his hands at his back and took a glimpse at Ye Qingtang. He then stretched out one hand and pointed out one finger.

“The Jiang Family’s finger techniques are separated into two classes. The first one is for normal family members, and the second one is for those whose bloodlines are awakened. Today, I’m going to teach you the second type. Watch closely.”

Ye Qingtang nodded.

Jiang Yu’s face was expressionless. He just stared at Ye Qingtang calmly. He took a step forward and slowly pointed towards Ye Qingtang’s glabella with his finger.

The speed of this movement was extremely slow. Ye Qingtang focused on his finger and could see clearly how Jiang Yu’s fingertip slowly approached her glabella. Time seemed to slow down at that moment.

Ye Qingtang could only see the finger, which was about one meter away from her, gradually approaching. She could suddenly feel a strong and intense force surrounding her body as the finger got closer to her!

It seemed that there were force waves spreading out from the finger. The movement was so slow, but Ye Qingtang felt that her body was tensed under that force. It was getting extremely difficult to even move her own finger.

Jiang Yu’s finger was an arm’s distance away from Ye Qingtang’s glabella, but she could feel the pain at her glabella clearly. Her whole body was soaked in cold sweat. It seemed that there was an invisible fiend cage in front of her about to swallow her!

Jiang Yu suddenly withdrew his hand. The force surrounding Ye Qingtang disappeared. However, Ye Qingtang could still feel the pressure and pain.
