Chapter 2539: Killing An Immortal Emperor (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang and the big yellow dog were talking in the house when the Blood Moon Elder walked to the window and looked outside.

The Blood Moon Elder quickly retracted his head and looked at Ye Qingtang. He said hurriedly, “Holy Lady, many powerful figures are rushing in!”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly but regained her composure quickly.

What the woman in green said earlier was that the unleashing of the yellow dog’s accumulated power had produced the energy of an Immortal Emperor. Many major factions in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain mistook this for an Emperor level practitioner trying to break through to the Immortal Emperor level.

And that surge of Immortal Emperor energy came and went rapidly. That could only mean two things.

Firstly, the Emperor level practitioner failed to break through to the Immortal Emperor stage. Therefore, in order to prevent future troubles and prevent the emergence of any new Immortal Emperors, these major factions would eliminate this Emperor level practitioner who tried to break through.

The second reason was that the breakthrough had been successful but the Immortal Emperor was unable to endure the might of the Heavenly Tribulation and was severely injured.

Regardless of which reason, it was enough for the various large factions to think of ways to get rid of him. An Immortal Emperor practitioner who was a complete stranger to them was an extremely unstable existence to the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain.

However, it now seemed that Ye Qingtang did not have anything to worry about. After all, in the eyes of those major forces, whether that Immortal Emperor succeeded or failed in breaking through, he would at least possess the power of a peak Emperor level. But the big yellow dog had no powers now at all. There was no way they could be implicated.

Crash!

Before Ye Qingtang could ponder this any further, the sounds of doors crashing open rang out from the relay station. Many cultivators who were inside the rest station were all led out.

Ye Qingtang looked around. In front of these powerful figures, it was useless to escape or hide. Given the situation, she might as well stay in the room and wait for them to investigate.

Before long, Ye Qingtang’s room door was also kicked open before several middle-aged men strode in. One of them was in charge of guarding Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder while the rest searched the room. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After confirming that there was no one else in the room, one of the middle-aged man’s gazes landed on Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

“Let me ask you, is there anyone else in this room other than the two of you and your dog?” the middle-aged man asked.

Ye Qingtang hurriedly shook her head and frowned. “May I ask… has there been some misunderstanding?”

“Come with us!” One of the middle-aged men shouted coldly.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder looked at each other. The two of them did not resist. Picking up the big yellow dog hidden in the kennel, Ye Qingtang followed the middle-aged men out of the house.

Outside the rest station, the lit lanterns made it as bright as day. Most of the martial arts practitioners who were resting at the relay station were all brought here. Everyone was confused and did not know what was going on at all.

The owner of the relay station was sweating profusely. All he did was continue to bow to those middle-aged men, afraid of being collateral damage.

“Look carefully. Are these all the people who have checked in at your relay station? Did you miss anything? If there’s even the smallest discrepancy, your entire clan will be exterminated.” The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince looked at the owner of the relay station with a faint smile.

“Yes, yes, yes… My Lord, please rest assured. I will definitely look carefully.. I would definitely not miss anything!” The owner of the relay station wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and immediately sized up the crowd.
