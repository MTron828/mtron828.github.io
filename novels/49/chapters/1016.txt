Chapter 1017 Flourish (2)

“Eldest Young Lady, I don’t wish to return to Leiting Sect already… I wish to join the Ye Family…” Dan Yifan said hurriedly.

Currently, the Ye Family’s power was not what those super sects could compare to, much less an ordinary sect like Leiting Sect. Moreover, his grandfather was the Great Elder of the Ye Family. If he could remain in the Ye Family… 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Previously, Dan Yifan told his grandfather about this thought, but his grandfather could not call the shots and could only let Dan Yifan ask Ye Qingtang.

Currently, to join the Ye Family and become a Ye Family disciple, one had to pass the assessment by Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin. Given Dan Yifan’s talent and skills, it was almost impossible.

“If you wish to stay, you just need to let Elder Bai or Elder Zijin know.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

Although Dan Yifan was proud and arrogant, he did not have a bad nature. After all, the very cause of his injury this time was because he helped the Ye Family. Thus, it was nothing to let him stay as a Ye Family disciple, and Ye Qingtang would not reject him.

Dan Yifan’s eyes were filled with agitation and jubilee after hearing Ye Qingtang’s words.

The current Ye Family was a place that ordinary cultivators could only look up to. Although the reputation of “Ye Family of Lin Town” was not yet widely known, this mainland would definitely know about it very soon.

If Dan Yifan could become a Ye Family disciple, the benefits were innumerable, and it would be a million times better than him being in Leiting Sect.

Furthermore, Dan Yifan did not have any sense of belonging to Leiting Sect either. Sects had always been cold and desolate, and there were too many schemes and plots between senior and junior brothers. Compared to that, the warmth and humanity of a family clan outshone.

“Eldest Young Lady.”

Before Dan Yifan could say anything, a young teen in a Ye Family disciple uniform entered the study room with a reverent expression and greeted Ye Qingtang with cupped fists.

“What happened?” Ye Qingtang looked at the youth.

Ye Qingtang had some memory of this youth. He was a descendant of a royal bloodline of the Formidable Heavens Royals, where his father was a prince, and he possessed extremely powerful martial talent. His original name was Bai Leng. Elder Bai Kui adored this boy deeply; thus, he brought him to the Ye Family and changed his surname to ‘Ye’. This youth was now called Ye Leng.

Ye Leng was only over ten years old but was already at Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven. In Formidable Heavens Dynasty, he was a notorious little tyrant, and nobody dared to offend him. After finding out that the Ye Family had a Yang Lord, he was extremely willing to become a Ye Family disciple.

“Eldest Young Lady, some disciples are fighting at the training field,” Ye Leng said.

Dan Yifan had a strange expression. Did he need to inform a Yang Lord of such matters?

“Why did you not report to an Elder?” Ye Qingtang stared at Ye Leng.

Then, Ye Leng flushed immediately. “Uh… I did not have any chance to see you previously… So…”

Ye Qingtang was rather helpless.

As Ye Leng had said, she had never seen any of the newly recruited Ye Family disciples before, and none of those talented disciples who joined out of admiration for her dared to disturb her. This Ye Leng, however, was an exception and did not pass up any chances

“Go, let’s take a look.”

Ye Qingtang stood up. It was also a good opportunity for her to get to know the new Ye Family disciples.

“Alright!” Ye Leng nodded repeatedly.

Soon, Ye Leng caught sight of Dan Yifan and said, “This is…”

“I am Dan Yifan, a new Ye Family disciple. Please take care of me in the future,” introduced Dan Yifan hurriedly as he inspected the person who was about the same age as himself but was already at Martial Qi Level Three Third Heaven.
