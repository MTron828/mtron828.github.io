A cold glint surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she looked at the elder in white from the Feng Yun Family.

Initially, Ye Qingtang did not want to provoke these people. However, since the elder had executed a killer move, Ye Qingtang had no choice but to counterattack.

At that moment, everyone from the Feng Family looked at Ye Qingtang with disbelief and shock in their eyes. This woman who came to the Divine Venerate Domain from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain was actually so powerful? It was inconceivable that the many dozens of Feng Yun Family fighters and

an elder were completely helpless against her!

“Could it be that her cultivation level has already entered… the peak Eighth Heaven Level Divine Lord?” The Feng family patriarch sized up Ye Qingtang in surprise.

“Peak Eighth Heaven Level Divine Lord?”

Everyone else in the Feng family was dumbstruck, especially Feng Cang and the other youths. They were shocked and in disbelief.

Although there were true experts in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, there were very few of them. Furthermore, those well-known experts rarely took the risk to come to the Divine Venerate Domain. They usually hid in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain to lord over the others in that domain

“Sister Ye Yue, you’re amazing!” Feng Wuyin looked at Ye Qingtang in admiration.

“Heavens, Sister Ye Yue is so powerful. I thought that Sister Ye Yue’s strength was about the same as mine. But she’s much stronger than me!” Feng Jiuyou was flabbergasted.

“Thank you for your help, Miss Ye!”

Father Feng stood up and cupped his fists at Ye Qingtang, his face filled with gratitude. If not for Ye Qingtang, he would probably be dead.

Father Feng and Mother Feng did not expect Ye Qingtang to be so powerful. Even though she came from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, she was not afraid of the people from the Feng Yun Family. She even managed to completely defeat those powerful fighters from the Feng Yun Family.

“You… little girl, you dare to go against the Feng Yun Family!” The elder in white stood up and glared at Ye Qingtang furiously. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

‘The Feng Yun Family had never suffered such a huge loss in this region before. No faction dared to provoke them!!

Ye Qingtang glanced at the white-robed elder from the Feng Yun Family indifferently and said coldly, “So what if we are enemies?”

Ye Qingtang had previously hesitated over whether to interfere in this era. However, after saving Father Feng’s life from the Feng Yun Family fighter, she no longer bothered about that anymore.

Although there was no record of Father Feng in history, Ye Qingtang was not stupid. If she did not intervene just now, Father Feng would have died under the sword of that Feng Yun Family fighter.

Since she had already saved him, she had now changed the course of history. What was done was already done, what else was there to be afraid of? As for what would happen in the future, that would be a matter for the future. Moreover, even if history was changed, it might not necessarily be in a bad

way.

“Little girl… you will regret it… you and the entire Feng family will pay an extremely tragic price for your ignorance and arrogance!” The elder in white stared at Ye Qingtang as he hollered.

The expressions of the Feng family members changed slightly. Indeed, even though Ye Qingtang’s martial art skills were extremely powerful, the consequences would be dire if the Feng Yun Family patriarch stepped forward.

The patriarch of the Feng Yun family was a true Emperor level practitioner, who had ascended to the Emperor level many years ago..
