With the betrayal of his ally, Tong Hua could only pack the Spirit Crystals with a sad face.

Just by seeing his expression, those who did not know would think that he was robbed.

Ye Qingtang nimbly transferred the corresponding thirty plus Xuanming points to Tong Hua. While Tong Hua got rid of these burning potatoes, he felt extremely guilty towards Ye Qingtang who got “ripped off.”

“Junior… Junior Sister Ye, if there’s anything you need help with in the future, just go ahead and ask me. Thank you so much… for today,” Tong Hua said to Ye Qingtang earnestly.

“…” Ye Qingtang kept feeling as though she was taken advantage of, but the person who was taken advantage of was clearly Tong Hua.

If one was overly honest and good-natured, others would feel quite helpless as well…

Tong Hua stammered awhile more to Ye Qingtang and then finally packed up his items and returned to the Fist Faction for practice. On the other hand, Qin Huan, who was called over halfway, had no choice but to pay a price for his big mouth.

Carrying seventy to eighty plus Spirit Crystals, Qin Huan grinned at Ye Qingtang and said, “Junior Sister Ye, are you returning now?”

Ye Qingtang turned around and walked out of the Dragon Court without forgetting to signal Qin Huan behind her with a finger.

Qin Huan followed up quickly.

“Junior Sister Ye, what are you buying so many Spirit Crystals for?” Qin Huan asked carefully, deeply afraid that what he said previously had offended Ye Qingtang. Gu Yanqiu was still waiting for Ye Qingtang to form a team with them to go on missions, and if Ye Qingtang complained to Gu Yanqiu, Qin Huan predicted that… Gu Yanqiu would kick him out of the team in order to protect Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang replied, “Obviously because there’s a use.”

Qin Huan remained silent.

You have many Xuanming points, so you can spend lavishly.

Ye Qingtang thought of something and asked, “Senior Brother Qin, do you know who else has Spirit Crystals?”

Qin Huan was dumbfounded.

She bought so many already, but it still was not enough?

She still wants to buy more Spirit Crystals? Is she crazy!

However, he was not bold enough to say this in Ye Qingtang’s face.

“I’m afraid… there isn’t really anyone who has them. Spirit Crystals are rare and not easy to find usually. Although veins produce them, it is extremely rare. Furthermore, no one required them, and, thus, this item was even rarer. Those that Tong Hua had were ones that he was being cheated to accept. Otherwise, no one would have so many Spirit Crystals for no reason. One must know that it was already amazing when a vein produced at most one or two crystals.” Qin Huan mumbled.

“Cheated?” Ye Qingtang stopped in her tracks. She knew how useless Spirit Crystals were to humans as well and thus was extremely happy when she saw them in Tong Hua’s hands.

Currently, no one knew the importance of Spirit Crystals yet, but in a few months later, a divine weapon would appear on earth. That divine weapon was owned by a mighty figure, and its appearance caused a commotion. As rumors of the divine weapon’s sharpness circulated, its origins were gradually dug out by people.

That was a weapon with Spirit Crystals embedded in it and was forged by a blacksmith who hid away from the world for many years.

The spirit energy in Spirit Crystals could not be absorbed by people; thus, humans saw them as useless items. However, that blacksmith discovered another use for the Spirit Crystals: to forge divine weapons!

With the craft of a blacksmith, embedding Spirit Crystals into a weapon could increase the weapon’s strength by a large extent. Once this news was spread, it could be said that the whole world was shaken as suddenly, Spirit Crystals, which no one asked about before, suddenly became a popular treasure. All family clans and powerful groups went to great lengths to search for Spirit Crystals and invited famous blacksmiths to forge the weapons.
