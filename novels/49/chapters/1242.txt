Chapter 1243: Luo Family (2)

“Today is Luo Qufeng’s birthday banquet. You better restrain yourself a little,” Lan Yu said with a laugh.

Mi Qiu ignored him and took another gulp of wine.

“The Master is only here to make up the numbers. I’m not involved with the birthday banquet later, but… the Luo Family’s wine is really fragrant. Before you go, remember to remind the Master to bring a few carriages of it back with me… burp…” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Lan Yu shook his head wordlessly.

It was the nature of the Qiu Clan to have no respect for anyone. They not only wanted to bring back wine when attending a birthday banquet, but they even wanted a few carriages of it?!

The winged youth standing nearby was still young and had not had much contact with the Qiu Clan. His youthful blue eyes widened as he looked at the little fellow leaning on his uncle’s leg and drinking itself into a stupor. He was filled with curiosity.

It was just a little fellow, yet why did it keep referring to itself as Master?

Besides the Winged People and the Qiu Clan, there were many alien clans at tonight’s birthday banquet. They all looked rather strange. Some were vicious-looking, some were gray, and some… were furry.

The winged youth was still wondering to himself when he felt the ground beneath his feet begin to shake.

At that moment, a few giants, who stood dozens of meters tall, slowly walked in among the guests. The ground beneath everyone’s feet shook with every step that they took.

“Burp… even the Giant Clan is here…” Mi Qiu took a look, then gulped a mouthful of wine, and muttered to himself.

The giants were huge. They were especially conspicuous in the crowd. However, the Luo Family had already prepared special seats for them. The giants looked like small mountains piled up in the Luo House courtyard when they sat down.

A female giant was wearing a huge dress. When she sat, her skirt drifted down and whipped up a wild wind that almost sent Mi Qiu, who was sitting nearby, flying.

The entire courtyard was bustling.

Many guests had brought rich gifts.

The evening sank into the night, and the birthday banquet was about to start.

Luo Feng stood amidst the guests. He swept a glance over everyone present. However, the warm smile that hung on his lips seemed a little strange.

“Elder Brother, its about time. Grand Elder and the others are about to come over.” A middle-aged man, who looked very similar to Luo Feng, walked over. He was Luo Feng’s younger brother, Luo Qi, and also the Deputy Master of the Luo Family.

Luo Feng nodded and walked to the front of the courtyard. He said to all the guests,

“Today is the birthday of the Grand Elder of our Luo Family. Thank you, everyone, for coming. Allow me to toast you.”

With that, Luo Feng gave a signal to the servants. Hundreds of servants immediately brought out wine and served the guests.

“The Master finally gets to taste this wine.” Mi Qiu took a cup of wine and drank it without a second word.

The speed at which it drank the wine shocked the servant who had brought the wine.

It was not time to drink yet.

“Alright, hand all this over to the Master.” While the servant was still in a state of shock, Mi Qiu stood on its back legs and took the entire tray and all the wine on it.

Lan Yu, who was standing nearby, sighed helplessly.

When all the wine had been distributed, Luo Feng raised his cup.

“Please.”

With that, he emptied his cup.

Many had heard that the Luo Family’s wine was of an excellent vintage. They emptied their cups. The wine was indeed excellent.
