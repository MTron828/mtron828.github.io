Chapter 2000: Good Show (1)

The warden was dumbfounded. While he wasn’t certain if Xue Fu was speaking the truth or not, he didn’t dare to just ignore it since it concerned the Second Domain’s influence. He instantly broke the news to Elder Mo, who had just gifted the Netherworld Ring to the clan leader.

“Did Xue Fu really say that the Netherworld Ring is supposed to be given to the Crimson League?” Elder Mo’s expression darkened.

He wasn’t afraid of a mere Temple of Shadows, he would eventually have to get rid of them. But if it concerned the Crimson League...

“Yes, Xue Fu really said that...” the warden uttered.

Elder Mo’s brows furrowed and was immersed in deep thought.

The Crimson League was part of the Second Domain and was a force to be reckoned with. Those from the Central Mainland may not know the Ancient You Clan’s true aim, but Elder Mo knew it deeply.

The Ancient You Clan’s aim wasn’t the Central Mainland, nor the First Domain, but the Second Domain!

They made use of little You Yun’s Spiritual Abode to increase their cultivation state to the point that they could already enter the Second Domain. The reason they remained in the Central Mainland was so that they could quickly collect the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos to increase the Ancient You Clan’s cultivation state again.

However...

At this point in time, the Ancient You Clan certainly didn’t want to come face to face with the Second Domain’s powers. It was even more so when faced with the powerful Crimson League.

“Xue Fu said that he would come with the Crimson League’s people in three days’ time?” Elder Mo asked.

“Yes.” The warden nodded.

“We shall see,” Elder Mo murmured with a cautious attitude.

It would be a sticky mess if they really did snatch something from the Crimson League.

After making sure everything was taken care of, Elder Mo quickly broke the news to the clan leader. The clan leader of the Ancient You Clan almost spat out blood knowing that the Netherworld Ring would cause such trouble for them right after it came under their possession.

“I’ll leave the Netherworld Ring with you for the time being. If anyone from the Crimson League comes, just pass it to them and let them know it’s just a misunderstanding. If no one comes... it means that the Temple of Shadows fooled us again. We don’t need to show mercy anymore.”

The clan leader gave the orders.

It wasn’t time for them to provoke the powers from the Second Domain. Moreover, it would mean war for the Ancient You Clan if they were to get into a fight with the Crimson League now.

The Ancient You Clan could do almost everything they wanted in the Central Mainland, but when it came to the Second Domain...

As the Ancient You Clan was pulled into doubt about the situation, Xue Fu had already returned to the Temple of Shadows and was seeking forgiveness from Ye Qingtang.

Having no choice, Ye Qingtang gave a small punishment and brushed it off. Xue Fu was filled with gratitude and felt even more guilty towards her. He went to the prison and requested for Lady Ghost to administer punishment on him.

Ye Qingtang was speechless when she learned about it.

The Undead Clan seemed to be strange like that.

Ye Qingtang was in no hurry at all. Everything was laid out and all that was left was for the good show to begin.

Three days passed by just like that.

Bai Zhi came to the Temple of Shadows as scheduled. Ye Qingtang had been waiting for her arrival long ago. Even though Ye Qingtang wore a mask, when she saw Bai Zhi, she remained composed.

However...

She was feeling excited inside, waiting for a good show.

Bai Zhi stepped into the temple with an imposing aura. She looked around before she asked.

“Where’s the Ancient You Clan?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Bai Zhi very obviously thought that the Ancient You Clan should hand the ring over to them after snatching what belonged to the Crimson League.

“Lady Bai Zhi, I sent someone to inform the Ancient You Clan about it three days ago. However, the Ancient You Clan didn’t respond. I might have to trouble you to follow me over to the Ancient You Clan’s place to obtain the Netherworld Ring,” Xue Fu said.
