Chapter 1618: Kingdom Protector (3)

Kingdom Protectors kept watch in many nations, but the Supreme League Kingdom’s Kingdom Protector never appeared. This brought the King great anxiety, but fortunately, there had long been a rule that Kingdom Protectors were not allowed to participate in wars between nations.

It was exactly for this reason that the Supreme League Kingdom could last this long against the allied forces. Otherwise, they simply had no hope of winning if the Kingdom Protectors of other kingdoms joined the war.

However, with the reminder from the commander, the King realized that their Kingdom Protector may very well have appeared.

And she was standing right before them at this very instant!

The King recalled Joseph’s recount of how Ye Qingtang fought the allied forces and increasingly felt that Ye Qingtang was the protector of the Supreme League Kingdom.

There’s no doubt!

In the entire mainland, who else apart from a Kingdom Protector could eliminate 500,000 soldiers by herself?

And more importantly...

Kingdom Protectors will never abandon their kingdom.

“Your Majesty, I’ve made you wait for a long time.” Ye Qingtang naturally went along with the King’s discourse.

Ye Qingtang did not know what exactly a Kingdom Protector was, but she clearly sensed the King’s change in attitude.

The smiling King before her was completely different from the cold-blooded ruler who ordered the deaths of thousands of people just a while ago.

Nevertheless, while she did not know what a Kingdom Protector was, it seemed to be someone who protected this nation from its name, and this coincided with the mission the God of Nature gave her.

The King nodded in satisfaction.

The commander of the reinforcements was astonished and delighted.

The Supreme League Kingdom finally had their own Kingdom Protector.

However...

The commander of the reinforcements suddenly thought of something, and he looked at the King as though he wanted to say something. At the thought of the military officer who was beheaded for persuading the King, the commander eventually did not voice his worries. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was a good thing that Ye Qingtang was the protector of the Supreme League Kingdom.

However...

According to the mainland’s convention, Kingdom Protectors were not allowed to participate in wars unless the enemy country invaded the kingdom’s capital.

However, Ye Qingtang killed 500,000 men of the allied forces earlier on. If this news of this incident spread, yet another disaster would probably hit this mainland.

The commander’s worries were not unfounded.

News of the annihilation of the allied forces’ 500,000 soldiers spread across the mainland very quickly.

500,000 elite forces were wiped out in less than half a day, and not a single corpse was left!

This was definitely not achievable by normal military troops!

Apart from the Kingdom Protector, who else could possess such formidable powers?

Not long after Ye Qingtang annihilated 500,000 soldiers, the King of the Monza Kingdom personally visited the Supreme League Kingdom’s fortress.

The Monza Kingdom possessed the greatest military strength on this mainland. In this war that almost enveloped the entire mainland, the Monza Kingdom maintained a neutral position from the start and never took part in it.

The Supreme League Kingdom had the strongest military, but in terms of military strength, it was far behind that of the Monza Kingdom.

The two kingdoms had always stayed in their own lane, and now that the Monza King personally came to the Supreme League Kingdom’s fortress, it seemed that the matter was truly severe.
