Ye Qingtang nodded.

“That’s fine, but you will have to pay one thousand Xuanming points regardless of whether it will be successful or not,” said the incharge casually, as it was not the first time seeing disciples who wanted to smith a weapon themselves. After all, the fees for the Sword Spirit Workshop was exorbitant and not what ordinary disciples could afford.

However, those disciples who requested to forge a weapon themselves usually failed horribly.

It was no wonder though. How would these young masters and ladies who usually prioritized cultivation have come into contact with forging?

Forging was not something that could be successful just by randomly picking a metal and hammering it. Forging was a profound craft which required immense knowledge on various techniques, such as the temperature, duration to smelt, timing to hammer, amount of force to exert, and distributing the weight. How would a layman understand this?

If one did not understand the techniques of forging, they would not be able to forge an ordinary dagger, much less a divine weapon.

The incharge presumed that Ye Qingtang was same as those disciples and was too lazy to say anything else.

One thousand Xuanming points were not considered small, but this was way better than the exorbitant thirty thousand Xuanming points, and thus, Ye Qingtang swiftly handed one thousand Xuanming points.

After receiving the Xuanming points, the incharge stood up leisurely and led Ye Qingtang around a forging room, ultimately bringing her to a plain-looking corner.

An old anvil was placed there along with an extinguished, cold furnace beside it.

“You will forge your weapon here. There are some materials around here. Take whatever you want to use. I’ll give you six hours, and afterward, you must leave no matter whether you’re done forging,” said the incharge.

“Okay.” Ye Qingtang scanned the conditions of the place without saying anything.

She had no options anyway. Knowing the rules of the Sword Spirit Workshop, she naturally did not speak much. If the other party was unhappy and chased her out, there was no room for her to resist.

Who dared to be unruly on the Grand Elder’s turf?

The incharge saw that Ye Qingtang knew how to behave and left casually without saying anything.

Ye Qingtang did not dare to waste any time with only six hours on hand. Rolling up her sleeves immediately, she lit the furnace, prepared some water, and wiped the anvil and tools clean.

The incharge just left, but a blacksmith hurried over and whispered something in his ears.

There was a change in the incharge’s expression.

Ye Qingtang was about done with her preparation. She placed the Demonic Blood Sword on the anvil and looked at it repeatedly.

She spent much effort to obtain this Demonic Blood Sword, and if she accidentally damaged it from the forging, she would not be able to bear it.

“Little girl, are you intending to forge this sword?” Suddenly, a rather old voice traveled from behind Ye Qingtang.

Turning around, Ye Qingtang saw a plainly-clothed elderly with a gray beard standing behind her with his hands behind him as he looked at the Demonic Blood Sword on the anvil.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang smiled, thinking that he was a blacksmith in the Sword Spirit Workshop.

“This sword is alright. However, you must be careful when forging it. The material of this sword becomes very brittle when in contact with fire.” The elderly frowned slightly. Looking at the young and innocent lady, he felt that the sword before her was most likely going to be ruined.

“I will be careful.” Ye Qingtang replied courteously. As the elderly was frowning, she directly placed the blade of the Demonic Blood Sword in the fire.

The scarlet flame engulfed the blade instantly, and the sword’s glint was covered by the flame.

The elderly’s brows twitched slightly.
