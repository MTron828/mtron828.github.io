Chapter 1244: Luo Family (3)

However, just as Luo Feng and his guests were emptying their cups, the guards at the door suddenly announced loudly,

“The Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows is here to present her good wishes.”

The pronouncement made by that piercing voice dumbfounded everyone.

“The Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows? Have I heard wrongly?”

“Perhaps they have announced the wrong name? Hasn’t the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows been missing for thousands of years?”

“It was mostly the external world that spread the rumors that the Holy Lord had gone missing. The Temple of Shadows itself has never confirmed the rumor. Perhaps the Holy Lord was never missing in the first place.”

The guests all discussed the matter avidly. Even the Master of the Luo Family, Luo Feng, could not help but show a trace of surprise.

They had invited the Temple of Shadows out of courtesy because the two centers of power were near each other.

They had previously sent many similar invitations, but the Temple of Shadows had never sent a representative. They had, at most, sent a gift.

But it turned out that…

The Temple of Shadows had not only come this time, but the person who came was the Holy Lord, who had vanished for thousands of years.

In Central Mainland, there was no real distinction between good and evil. Here, might was right.

The Temple of Shadows had been supremely powerful in Central Mainland. Many people had the utmost regard for it and did not dare to offend it in the least.

But with the disappearance of the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows, the might of the Temple of Shadows had waned for the last few thousand years. However, its former status was still entrenched in many hearts.

Just as everyone was discussing the matter, a slender figure slowly walked through the moonlight and appeared before them.

A breathtakingly beautiful young girl stood in the glow of the moonlight. She walked over gracefully with an elusive smile on her face. Her slightly lifted eyes were more beautiful than the moon.

Dozens of Undead followed the young girl closely.

A hush instantly fell over the entire courtyard.

Those who thought the guards had announced the wrong name now stared at the surpassingly beautiful girl.

She was so aloof and so beautiful…

Under the mingled light from the moon and the lamps, her flawless face looked unreal. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Everyone looked at the young girl as she stepped forward. Many secretly gulped.

One must know that the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows was the most powerful symbol of the Temple of Shadows. She was the one who previously led the Temple of Shadows to its peak.

But the Holy Lord had vanished for a long time, and everyone thought that she was never coming back.

But it turned out that…

They were now seeing her in the flesh!

When Lan Yu, who was standing nearby, saw the young girl, his eyes were filled with astonishment. The beautiful women in his memories were swiftly overlaid by the present.

“Burp… am I really drunk? Why do I seem to see the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows?” Mi Qiu burped drunkenly as he squinted at the figure, his brow wrinkled in bewilderment.

“I must be really drunk.”

Ye Qingtang slowly walked through the courtyard under everyone’s shocked gaze. A small smile lurked in the corner of her mouth. Her amused eyes were aloof as she swept a casual gaze over everyone’s face.

That’s right…

That’s what the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows should look like.

Ye Qingtang inwardly noted everyone’s reaction. She only heaved a secret sigh of relief when she peeked at those near her from the corner of her eye and saw that their expressions were normal.
