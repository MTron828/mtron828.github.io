She was going to fight until the end!

Ye Qingtang focused all the black flames onto her arms and directed it straight into the monster’s mouth.

As the black flames poured towards the monster’s mouth, it trembled and bit down even harder, as though it wanted to utterly crush her arms.

Ye Qingtang could feel every bit of the pain from her bones being impaled by the monster as her blood dripped continuously, yet she continued blasting at the monster with her black flames.

Sensing the dire situation, the little white tiger got up. With its petite body, it jumped straight into the monster’s mouth through the gaps between its teeth. Little White Tiger then opened its mouth and shot a jet of white flames straight into the ice-flame monster’s body.

Bang! The ice-monster covered in black flames exploded. At long last, the ice-flames intertwined with black flames flew all over the place as the bite over Ye Qingtang’s arms finally faded.

Little White Tiger jumped onto Ye Qingtang’s back as his body enlarged. He grabbed Ye Qingtang hastily with his mouth to dodge the incoming ice-flames.

The ice-flames began taking shape again as they fell onto the ground. Cursing inwardly, Little White Tiger quickly dragged Ye Qingtang away from the place as fast as possible.

Damn it, just the scales from the ice phoenix were enough to make such a terrifying monster. And they even reformed after being split apart. How many crazy things were in this goddamn place?

Going as quickly as he could, Using his speed, Little White Tiger brought Ye Qingtang away from the ice-flame-covered iceberg, not daring to stay another second.

It only stopped to rest in a cave after it had escaped to the foot of the ice mountain.

By now, its mouth was filled with the coppery taste of blood. The wound on Ye Qingtang’s arm had stained its entire mouth.

Little White Tiger quickly put Ye Qingtang down, looking over her arms, which had become a gory mess of blood and flesh. The only saving grace was that her bones had only been mildly fractured, not broken. If they had... she would die here.

But even if that was the case, the grotesque wound still worried Little White Tiger greatly.

The monster had been covered in ice-flames, and wherever it touched froze instantly. Since Ye Qingtang’s arms had already been frozen from the flames, some areas had already turned purple from the cold.

Ye Qingtang leaned against the walls of the cave, her face deathly pale. She braced herself against the pain and opened up her space ring to take out the elixirs. Her entire body felt like it was being ripped apart from the inside.

Her wound was worse than she had thought.

She had spent all her energy and only barely got rid of the ice-flame monster, which was merely a small-fry in this mystic realm.

Regardless of whether it was the ice phoenix, the Ice King or the ice vine monster, they were all monsters that mere humans could never even dream of defeating.

There were so many powerful men from the Second Domain who didn’t dare take one step out of the canyon because they knew how terrifying these creatures were.

As someone who was only from the Paragon level, she was a mere ant in the eyes of these monsters.

“It’s already late today. Let’s rest here. You’re not going anywhere... in that condition anyway.” Wanting to give as much comfort as possible, Little White Tiger wrapped Ye Qingtang in his warm tummy and sighed.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

It had been a harrowing day, and she was already completely exhausted. If she were to continue on in this state, she would definitely die. She had to rest and regain her strength before continuing on this deadly journey.

Utterly drained, Ye Qingtang quickly fell asleep buried in Little White Tiger’s warmth. After it sensed her fall asleep, Little White Tiger shut its eyes as well.

Darkness covered the ground as night fell. In the midst of the chilling, lonely land of ice, the wind brought with it the scattered voices of the dead.

In the dark, a pair of eyes focused on the woman and the beast in the cave...
