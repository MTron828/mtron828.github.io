Chapter 1105 Forbidden Formation (1)

Ye Qingtang had absorbed many arrows of extermination. The aura in her body had reverted to its original state so that her ability was hidden. Her aura now looked no different from that of an ordinary cultivator.

Especially after the small boy had enlightened her on how to enter the Tenth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord, Ye Qingtang’s aura was now near intangible.

“Are you ready?” Ye Qingtang looked down in the direction of the Yunxiao Sect.

“We are ready!”

Elder Bai Kui nodded.

When she heard that, Ye Qingang nodded and led both families in the direction of Falling Sky Valley.

The Formidable Heavens Dynasty and the Nine Nights Dynasty were far apart. However, the Yunxiao Sect was situated in the portion of the Formidable Heavens Dynasty that was near the external world, so it was not too bad.

Because Absolute Monarch of Heaven, Black and White Holy Son, and the other powerful cultivators of Central Mainland were holding the fort in Falling Sky Valley, the Eye of Extermination had not posed too great of a threat.

At that moment, in the public square of the Falling Sky Valley.

The two children were following Ye Qingtang closely. They were unwilling to leave her, even for a minute, and Ye Qingtang had no choice but to allow them to do so.

“Qingtang, these are…”

Perfected Xuanchen’s eyes were filled with astonishment. He looked first at Absolute Monarch of Heaven and the other powerful cultivators from Central Mainland, then at the Ye and Si Families.

Ye Qingtang did not hide their identities and introduced everyone.

“And these are friends from Central Mainland?”

Perfected Xuanchen and the group from the Falling Sky Valley looked at Absolute Monarch of Heaven, Yin Yang Child, Black and White Holy Son, and the others. They were somewhat shocked.

In the First Domain, Central Mainland was the mainland with the most flourishing martial culture. Also, Central Mainland’s land area was hundreds of times bigger than that of this mainland. A small country in Central Mainland probably had as much land area as this mainland.

“So you are a native of this mainland… how unexpected.”

A man in black armor looked at Ye Qingtang and laughed softly.

They had thought that Ye Qingtang, who had obtained the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, was also a citizen of Central Mainland.

But it turned out that…

Ye Qingtang was from this mainland.

This realization surprised everyone.

After all, this mainland’s reputation for martial arts was beneath the notice of the powerful cultivators of Central Mainland. They had not expected that their longed-for inheritance of the Divine Phoenix would be obtained by Ye Qingtang, who was from this mainland.To the others from Central Mainland, this was shocking. However, they did not discuss it further.

“How strange, why is the Ancient You Clan… attacking this mainland…”

Yin Yang Child looked at the Eye of Extermination in the void, his expression perplexed.

“Ancient You Ancient Clan?”

When he heard that, Perfected Xuanchen was taken aback.

“Don’t you know?” Yin Yang Child looked at Perfected Xuanchen and the other local residents. But on second thought, there was no reason for them to know about this, and he continued.

“The Ancient You Clan is one of the oldest clans in Central Mainland. They can trace their roots back for ten thousand years… In the past, an Emperor-level tyrant emerged in the Ancient You Clan. He was almost a demi-god, but unfortunately, ten thousand years later, the First Domain’s martial culture declined for some reason. The Heavenly Venerate-level powerful cultivators were all at their peak. Even the Ancient You Clan could not escape their fate and declined.”

“Haha, you may say that, but it was not just the Ancient You Clan that declined, but the entire First Domain…” said a black-robed old man from Central Mainland.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
