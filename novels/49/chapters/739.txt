There was an abundance of spirit energy in Falling Sky Valley, and Ye Qingtang’s speed of cultivation advancement was way faster than when she was in Xuanling Sect. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However…

She was already a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord now, and it was still insufficient if she wanted to enter the true Yin Yang Perfected Lord state in a short time.

However, the time left for her was not a lot.

Xuanling Sect’s defense would disappear in just a few months. By then, Yunxiao Sect would definitely not let Xuanling Sect off. Given Ye Qingtang’s current skills, although she could look down upon the group of people from Yunxiao Sect, it was not enough to contend against the entire Yunxiao Sect just by herself.

Only by entering the Yin Yang Perfected Lord could she truly resolve Xuanling Sect’s crisis.

Furthermore…

Ye Qingtang looked up at the familiar scenery in Falling Sky Valley.

In her previous life, her Master, Perfected Xuanchen, became the acting Valley Master, which attracted the dissatisfaction with various peaks. Although her Master maintained the harmony within the valley with all his might and tolerated many things in consideration of the overall situation, he was suppressed by the other Peak Masters not long later and was forced to give up the position of the acting Valley Master.

Because of that, Falling Sky Valley became segregated and ultimately was met with a calamity. It was also at that time when her Master was killed by Ye You.

After a rebirth, Ye Qingtang had long seen that the different Peak Masters had their own designs and that her Master was the only one who would maintain the harmony within the valley.

This was also the reason why the old Valley Master handed the acting Valley Master position to her Master from the start.

In this life, Ye Qingtang would never let such an incident happen again. She would not allow anyone to force her Master into giving up the Valley Master position.

Although she could suppress all the Falling Sky Valley disciples with her current skills, it was still insufficient against the Peak Masters.

Falling Sky Valley had twelve peaks, and most of the Peak Masters were in the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state. Furthermore, the three Peak Masters who forced her Master in giving up the Valley Master position were all Yin Lords of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state.

If Ye Qingtang did not want the tragedy from her previous life to happen again, the only option was to enter the Yin Yang Perfected Lord state as quickly as possible.

With various urgent matters staring at her in the face, Ye Qingtang increasingly felt the need to raise her skills rapidly.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang immediately thought of the Dragon Vein which Master Du told her about.

If the Dragon Vein was really like what Master Du said, perhaps it would be a chance for her skills to increase as quickly as possible.

At that thought, Ye Qingtang no longer had any more hesitation. She immediately brought the little white tiger and silver wolf out of Falling Sky Valley and headed towards the Bliss Forging Workshop.

Just as Ye Qingtang was about to leave Falling Sky Valley, the few Blue Cloud Peak disciples whom she beat up that day were complaining tearfully to a tall youth.

“Eldest Senior Brother, Admirable Sky Peak went too far in bullying us. That Ye Chen fellow was just accepted as a disciple by Perfected Xuanchen and was already this arrogant to casually beat people up in the valley. Eldest Senior Brother, you must help us.”

“It isn’t anything for us to suffer from injustice, but that Ye Chen clearly did not have any regard for us Blue Cloud Peak disciples. Although we were beaten up, he attacked us publicly and did not spare any face for our Blue Cloud Peak.”

Those Blue Cloud Peak disciples echoed after each other and completely left out the incident where they stole Sheng Qianyu’s belonging first, wishing they could make Ye Qingtang’s evil conduct public.

The male standing before them frowned slightly, and a trace of unhappiness could be seen on his good-looking face.
