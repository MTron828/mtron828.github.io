Chapter 1024 Playing Tricks

The Beiming Manor was one of the three most powerful forces in this mainland. With the backing of a powerful Yang Lord, its residence was filled with inscrutably powerful people. In this mainland, only the Peerless School and the Phantom Valley, with their extraordinary powers, could compare with the Beiming Manor.

However, even the lofty Beiming Manor, with its extraordinary powers, might hesitate to speak of judging an invincible Yang Lord!

What was this YunXiao Sect? It was not even worthy of licking Beiming Manor’s boots. Even if the Master of the YunXiao Sect arrived, he would only be worthy of kneeling to them. But these two, who were merely elders, dared to speak with an arrogance that even the Beiming Manor might not dare to assume.

Elder Gu and Elder Yin were enraged when they saw the Ye Family disciples roar with laughter.

“Ignorant youths, you must have a death wish!” Elder Gu roared with anger as he looked at the Ye Family. He was poised to strike.

However, one of the youths hurriedly smiled and said, “Powerful sirs, please don’t be angry. As you said, our Eldest Young Lady has brought a little white tiger back to the Ye House… so we will allow the two powerful sirs to enter the Ye House.”

With that, the youth actually made way and retreated to the side. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

When they saw that, the other youths shook their head. This youth was just too mischievous. If they allowed these two super sect members into the Ye House, they would probably not leave alive. Even the other Ye Family disciples could take their lives, not to speak of the others present.

However, these youths were not stupid. They could tell that the Yunxiao Sect had some grievance with their Eldest Young Lady. However, none of them could understand how they had summoned up the courage to attempt to capture a powerful Yang Lord.

Whatever the case may be, since they had spoken so arrogantly and been so rude to their Eldest Young Lady, they must certainly die, and it would be all right to toy with them first.

“Hadn’t you better scram!” Elder Gu shouted coldly.

“Yes, yes, yes. I’m going, we’re all going. Powerful sirs, please don’t be angry. Our Eldest Young Lady is in residence. If the powerful sirs want to capture her, now is the time!” One of the youths spoke laughingly while the rest scattered in all directions.

Elder Yin and Elder Gu thought that the attitude these Ye Family disciples displayed was normal. After all, when nobodies encountered a truly powerful cultivator, they all adopted this attitude. They could even betray their own parents, much less the Eldest Young Lady.

“Hehe, family clans.”

Elder Yin laughed disdainfully and, together with Elder Gu, stepped over the threshold of the Ye House and entered the residence.

After a moment, Elders Yin and Gu arrived in the courtyard of the Ye House.

At that moment, more than a hundred talented youths were in the Ye Family courtyard, sparring and chatting.

The most powerful of the Ye Family’s younger generation had already entered the realm of half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord and was on par with the two elders from the Yunxiao Sect.

However, when Elder Yin and Elder Gu saw the younger members of the Ye Family, they did not think much of the latter.

A bystander could only identify the Martial Qi realm of a martial arts cultivator when he fought or deliberately showed his aura.

In addition, these two elders had not considered what Martial Qi realm the Ye Family’s disciples were in, so they did not study them.

In the same way, the two elders from the Yunxiao Sect had not bothered about what Martial Qi realm Ye Qingtang was in. If they did not even respect the master of the Xuanling Sect, why would they bother with the cultivation level of a disciple?
