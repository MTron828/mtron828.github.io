Chapter 1710: The Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm (2)

Most of them were from different clans. Good luck inside the mystic realm was rare, and they were all competitors here.

Embarrassed by the rejection, Wu Xiao fell silent.

At the side, Sang Feiyu laughed lightly and said something to Zhan Rao.

There was a clear divide between the ten of them. Those who had entered the last time were all calm and collected while the newcomers were evidently uneasy.

Amidst all their thoughts, the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm finally opened.

“Contestants, please enter the mystic realm,” the elder said.

With that said, the ten of them entered the mystic realm, anticipating what was within it, wanting to make themselves stronger.

The moment they entered the mystic realm, white flashed in front of Ye Qingtang’s eyes. Before she could regain her vision, she felt a bone-piercing chill attack every inch of her skin.

When Ye Qingtang finally regained her vision, she took a good look at the inside of the mystic realm and froze.

It was a land of crystal ice and snow. As far as her eyes could see, everything was covered in a sea of ice and snow. The ground beneath her feet was like a frozen lake, transparent and glistening in its crystal haze.

The wind brought with it the tremendous cold which chilled them to their bone, sapping every bit of warmth from their body.

“It’s freezing!” Wu Xiao exclaimed as he rubbed his shoulders subconsciously. Teeth chattering, he felt as though he had fallen into an ice cellar.

“What is this cold to us? We’ll be able to withstand it with just a little spirit energy. How did you even get into the top ten? You don’t even know how to use the spirit energy to protect yourself?” Zhan Rao frowned as he looked at the shivering Wu Xiao. At the same time, he released his spirit energy, trying to ward off the cold.

As spirit energy emanated in waves from him, Zhan Rao still couldn’t feel a shred of warmth.

The cold seemed to invade every crevice of their body. Even their spirit energy could not protect them from it.

“What’s going on...” Zhan Rao was in shock.

The other had tried to protect themselves with spirit energy as well to the same results.

This bone-chilling cold was relentless no matter how much spirit energy they released. In a few seconds, a layer of ice was already covering their eyes and ends of their hair.

“It’s too cold here. Even spirit energy can’t hold it off.” Sang Feiyu was frowning as well. She looked as though she had been dropped in an ice cellar as well, every inch of her body suffering from the intense cold. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“How is this possible!” Zhan Rao exclaimed.

Ye Qingtang was frowning slightly. As she looked down at her fingertips, she saw they were slowly turning white from the cold, and something strange flashed in front of her eyes.

“Qiu Chen, I’m scared. I want to go back.” Qiu Ci was so cold her face was turning purple. Her unease swelled as the extreme cold assaulted all of her senses.

“Just leave if you want to. The exit is over there,” Qiu Chen, who was frozen stiff as well, said as he waved his hands impatiently.

Qiu Ci walked towards the exit with full intention of leaving when she suddenly froze.

“The exit... it-its gone...”

Qiu Ci’s words suddenly attracted everyone’s attention.

Zhan Rao looked at where the exit was in disbelief. Where the exit was previously, stood a tall mountain of ice, with no trace of an exit anywhere.

“How is that possible? The exit to the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm wouldn’t disappear like that... this has never happened before.” Zhan Rao’s eyes widened. The exit had remained where it was the last time he was here. The clans usually recorded the details of the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm as well.
