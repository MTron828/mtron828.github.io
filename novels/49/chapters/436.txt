Chapter 437: You Are Cheating (2)

“That’s the reason why every time Qinglin Sect was the first in the three sect competition. Who could beat Fu Lingtian when he has reached Martial Qi Level Two?”

“Qinglin Sect is so shameless!”

“Oh my god! Is Ye Qingtang a monster… She broke Fu Lingtian’s hand and even forced him to reveal his true power…”

Besides criticizing Qinglin Sect, more people were amazed at Ye Qingtang’s terrifying fighting ability.

“Hahaha… Spirit root? So what if your spirit root is not superior? Ye Qingtang’s spirit root is not good, but even Fu Lingtian with Martial Qi Level Two ability almost died in her hands. Spirit root does not represent one’s fighting ability…”

“That’s right. I think even some of the core disciples in the inner sect of Xuanling Sect also cannot compare with Junior Sister Ye.”

“Spirit root does not represent everything… As long as you are strong enough, the quality of the spirit root does not matter anymore!”

Some of the Xuanling Sect disciples’ eyes were full of excitement as they possessed ordinary spirit roots. Ye Qingtang gave them the hope to be stronger.

…

“Qinglin Sect, how are you going to explain?”

Elder Mo stood in front of Ye Qingtang and looked at the Qinglin Sect Elders.

“This…”

How could the Qinglin Sect Elders know what was going on?

In their impressions, Fu Lingtian was always at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Maybe… your disciple is too strong… Then she forced out Fu Lingtian’s talent and caused him to break through…” One of the Qinglin Sect Elders tried to explain.

Elder Mo glanced at that Elder coldly. “You were saying that Fu Lingtian’s Martial Qi Level One cultivation suddenly broke through to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two?”

“This is not entirely impossible.” The Qinglin Sect Elder nodded.

“Not entirely impossible?” Elder Qin went forward and sneered. “In my whole life, I have never heard of any talented person who can break through two levels in a second.”

“Hehe…” The Wind Moon Sect Elder stood up and smiled at the Elders who were quarreling, “We should not sacrifice our harmony for that. Anyway, the competition was meant to enhance our relationship.”

“Elder…” Ye Qingtang smiled. “Qinglin Sect won quite a lot of stakes by cheating these years… If they need to return all the stakes…”

Ye Qingtang did not elaborate further as she knew that the Wind Moon Sect Elder could understand her words.

The Wind Moon Sect Elders’ faces immediately changed. They realized that the stakes they lost were not negligible upon Ye Qingtang’s reminder.

Apparently, the Wind Moon Sect Elders’ faces also clouded.

“Humph! So shameless of you, Qinglin Sect! How dare you to ask your Martial Qi Level Two disciple to suppress his ability at Martial Qi Level One!”

“That’s right! Qinglin Sect won the top prize for a few years based on cheating. Now you must return all the stakes!”

“Besides returning, there must be compensation!”

The Wind Moon Sect Elders’ attitudes suddenly changed as they condemned the Qinglin Sect Elders.

“As I said, Fu Lingtian broke through…” The Qinglin Sect Elders did not wish to compromise.

“Hahaha, such a joke! As Elder Qin said, I have never seen anyone who can break through two levels instantly!”

“So you do not admit the despicable things you have done?!” Another Elder of the Wind Moon Sect gazed at the Qinglin Sect in rage.

The Wind Moon Sect intended to be the peacemaker, but their attitudes changed after Ye Qingtang’s ‘unintentional’ reminder.
