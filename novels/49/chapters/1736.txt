Chapter 1737: A Bewitching Melody (2)

But there was no time for her to let her guard down.

A huge shadow passed in front of them.

The troll had somehow managed to get in front of them!

“Damn it, this troll isn’t stupid at all, it knows how to take a detour!” They had finally escaped the fish-like monster only to be greeted by the troll again. The little white tiger’s heart was pounding hard.

“Trolls have the ability to escape by burrowing into the ground where they move faster than most creatures. It has an exceptional sense of smell and already has its sights set on us. Even if we escape, it’s only going to keep following us and bide its time.” Ye Qingtang sighed as she looked at the troll in front of her.

Once a troll had its sights set on its prey, it would never stop until it had killed it. No matter how far apart they were, it would continue hunting it down until it knew that its prey was no longer in existence.

“So what do we do?” Little White Tiger asked.

“We can only fight.” Ye Qingtang sighed again. She lowered her head to look at the little Heavenly Demon. Not knowing whether it could even understand her, she said, “Look at him and roar again.”

With that, Ye Qingtang mimicked shouting in the troll’s direction.

The little Heavenly Demon tilted its head and looked at Ye Qingtang, a look of confusion on its face. Having gotten its attention, Ye Qingtang took a fruit out of her space ring.

Greedy little eyes immediately lit up as it reached out to grab the fruit.

But Ye Qingtang didn’t give the fruit to it. She pointed to the troll and then at the little Heavenly Monster again.

The little Heavenly Demon blinked at her before turning its eyes on the troll. In the next second, the bewitching melody came out of its mouth again.

The troll froze again, a dazed expression on its face.

It was now or never!

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes and stuffed the fruit into the little Heavenly Demon’s hands. The both of them flew up into the sky rapidly as black flames trailed behind her.

She unsheathed the sword from her waist. As the black flames engulfed it, it transformed into the Black Flame Sword which was a few meters long!

Ye Qingtang raised the Black Flame Sword as black flames surrounded her, and she flew quickly towards the black troll. Moving quickly around the troll, the Black Flame Sword sliced into it again and again.

But the skin of the troll was extremely thick and all Ye Qingtang managed to do was leave black marks on the troll. She couldn’t do any damage at all.

After a few breaths, the effect of the bewitching melody on the troll finally wore off and the troll’s eyes were clear and bright again. Looking at the black marks on its body, it let out an angry roar, raised its hands and grabbed at Ye Qingtang who was flying around it.

Ye Qingtang quickly flew away and dodged as she pulled a bag of fruits out of her space ring and threw it to Little White Tiger.

Little White Tiger didn’t understand Ye Qingtang’s intentions. It grabbed the bag of fruit with its mouth and took a few out with its paw, throwing them behind him.

The little Heavenly Demon looked at the raining fruits, opened its mouth and let out the bewitching melody again.

Once again, the troll that was about to grab Ye Qingtang, froze. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Seizing this opportunity, Ye Qingtang turned into a whirlwind of flames, the Black Flame Sword in her hands turning into a sharp wheel, spinning arcs around with her. In a fluid motion, she sliced straight down the troll’s arm.
