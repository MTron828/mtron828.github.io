In the room, Su Wan scattered some powder on the floor in hopes of getting rid of the fruity smell.

Suddenly, there were loud knocks on her door, and she saw Liu Yue standing outside once she opened the door.

“Senior Sister Liu? Is there something wrong?” Su Wan looked at Liu Yue confusedly.

Liu Yue immediately pulled Su Wan to one side and said with a frown, “Junior Sister Su, what are you still doing here? Do you know what I saw just now?”

Confusion was written all over Su Wan’s face.

Liu Yue told Su Wan everything she saw.

Instantly, Su Wan’s face turned pale.

“You… you really saw it? Ye Qingtang really made a piece of clothing and gave it to Senior Brother Yun? Senior Brother Yun even… accepted it?” Su Wan asked with a frown and a despondent expression.

“How can it be fake? Let me tell you, Ye Qingtang that little bitch has a lot of tricks. Look how renowned the Liu Yun family clan behind Senior Brother Yun is. Ye Qingtang first gave him elixirs and then clothes. If you still continue to waste your time around like this, be careful that your Senior Brother Yun would be deceived away by other people with ulterior motives,” Liu Yue warned.

Su Wan’s face turned blue, and her lips were tightly pursed. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I am not close to Senior Brother Yun. If I just go up to him like that… isn’t it…”

“Don’t be unwilling to give up on your image. Look how she has so many tricks? Which part of you loses to Ye Qingtang? Other than that face of hers, what else does she have? As long as you show him your interest in him, Senior Brother Yun will naturally know how to differentiate good and bad,” Liu Yue suggested.

Just when Su Wan and Liu Yue were talking, there was a knock on the door.

Su Wan kept away all her emotions and opened the door.

When the door was opened, a handsome face suddenly fell into Su Wan’s eyes.

“This junior sister, is Ye Qingtang here?” Qin Huan asked with an attractive smile.

Su Wan was swayed by his peach blossom eyes, though she returned to her senses once she heard Ye Qingtang’s name.

“Ye Qingtang does live here.”

“Is she in then?” Qin Huan smiled even more brightly when he saw a gentle and pretty junior sister at the door.

“She… isn’t,” Su Wan said rather unwillingly.

“So she isn’t… Like this, then. I have a few items here, and I’ll have to trouble you to hand them over to her. Also, do pass on the message that I will be waiting for her outside the sect tomorrow morning and that she must not be late. Do tell her to prepare her things well as this trip will take at least half a month.” Then, Qin Huan placed a few bottles of antidotes in Su Wan’s hands.

Su Wan looked at the antidotes and was extremely unwilling but could not show it in front of Qin Huan and could only force out a reply, “Okay.”

“Thank you, junior sister,” Qin Huan said smilingly and left.

Su Wan frowned at the antidotes in her hand and thought of Qin Huan’s attractive face again. She was very unwilling as all of this was connected to Ye Qingtang.

“Junior Sister Su, your chance is here!” Liu Yue, who heard everything clearly in the room, suddenly exclaimed.

Su Wan closed the door and threw the antidotes on Ye Qingtang’s table unwillingly. “Senior Sister Liu, don’t make fun of me already.”

“Junior Sister Su, are you dumb? Didn’t you hear that senior brother from just now say that Ye Qingtang is going on a mission with them and would not return for at least half a month? In this time, won’t you be able to properly interact with Senior Brother Yun?” Liu Yun said.

Excitement could be seen in Su Wan’s eyes as a glimmer of hope suddenly emerged in her heart.
