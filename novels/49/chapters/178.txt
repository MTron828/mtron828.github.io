Chapter 179: Aura Of The Evil (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Mu Su’s face was dotted with sweat beads. As he sped forward, his eyes swept across every inch of his surroundings. At this instant, Mu Su was so anxious that his heart was about to explode!

“Your Highness, where did you go? You must stay safe at this time!”

Mu Su was one of the few people who knew that Han Cangming was the Demon God, but exactly because of this, Mu Su was even more worried.

His Highness had lost the Heart of the Demon God and could not control the Aura of the Evil within his body at every moment. There was always that one period of time when the Aura of the Evil in His Highness’s body would explode out, and because he could not control the aura, he would turn into an animal all the way until the collective entity of the Aura of the Evil was dissipated everywhere.

Previously, Han Cangming calculated the timing when the Aura of the Evil would explode; thus, he came to this Giant Rock Canyon which rarely had any people. Yet, unexpectedly… this resulted in the eruption of the magma beneath the Giant Rock Canyon, and it was during this chaos that Mu Su lost trace of Han Cangming.

At this very instant, Mu Su only thought of finding Han Cangming as soon as possible. The Aura of the Evil’s collective entity would not remain condensed for too long, and when it dissipated, Han Cangming would enter an extremely frail state. Then, he could only remain in an animal form. If anyone else saw this, god knows what would happen.

Mu Su dashed throughout and faintly sensed that the Aura of the Evil ahead of him was increasingly stronger. But when he reached the place, he was so stunned that he was rooted to the ground as though he was struck by lightning.

Ten meters away, an exquisite figure was half-kneeling in front of a huge silver wolf. Her small fair hands were gently placed against the silver wolf’s smooth fur, and the Aura of the Evil lingering around the silver wolf was sucked away by those hands bit by bit.

The worried expression on Mu Su’s face dropped at that very moment.

Ye Qingtang?!

Why was she here?!

Ye Qingtang did not sense Mu Su’s appearance at all as she only focused on absorbing the Aura of the Evil away from the silver wolf’s body using the Heart of the Demon God.

As the Aura of the Evil was slowly absorbed away, the silver wolf’s shiny fur appeared before Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang praised herself. Because of that small wolf, she had an unknown love for all wolves, and she could not keep her hands away especially from that fluffy fur. As such, she had offended many wolves.

However…

She had never seen such a “plump,” “sturdy,” and “shiny” wolf.

It is really… so pretty…

Ye Qingtang originally decided to leave after saving the wolf, but looking at the “tempting” wolf before her, greed started to fill her big eyes.

This wolf… should be a wild wolf right…

It probably did not have an owner.

Even if she carried it away, no one would care… right…

At this thought, a bold thought rose in her mind. Although she already had a little lightning dragon, it was still small and would not have any combat power in a short while. But this wolf was different. It had such a strong built, and it should have very good combat power if she raised it.

Ye Qingtang thought hard of how to bring this owner-less silver wolf away. She narrowed her eyes and looked around her surroundings. After ensuring that there was no one around, she swallowed down a few elixirs which temporarily raised her strength and opened her arms to carry the silver wolf horizontally!

Not far away, Mu Su saw His Highness being carried bridal style by Ye Qingtang and almost fainted right there and then!
