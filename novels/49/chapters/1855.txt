Fu Qiu was part of the fat catfish clan.

However, Fu Qiu had an eccentric personality and completely different hobbies from the other fat catfishes.

All fat catfishes in this mystic realm would solve all problems with gambling, but Fu Qiu is an exception. Not only did it build the only Crystal Palace on the ground surface to hide from the monsters, but it was also the only fat catfish to depend on trade instead of gambling.

“As long as you gather enough spirit stones, you can exchange them for a day’s protection at Fu Qiu’s place. It’s still early now, you have time,” the fat catfish said its piece and left.

Ye Qingtang and the others were shocked by the fat catfish’s words.

This seemingly safe mystic realm had such dangers?

“Is the fat catfish trustworthy?” Mu Feiruo asked cautiously.

“It should be fine. Though the fat catfish is greedy, it stood by its word.” Ye Qingtang had figured out that the fat catfishes were only obsessed with gambling, but they were quite accountable.

“It said that we need to gather enough spirit stones before we can go to the Crystal Palace to seek protection. Does this mean that we should also do to the gambling town and try our luck?” Mu Feiruo asked.

Ye Qingtang nodded. She then distributed the spirit stones she won from the fat catfish among them.

They froze for a moment before they held their hands up, rejecting her.

“You won these spirit stones, how can we take them?”

The spirit stones could be exchanged for protection, but Ye Qingtang was generous and gave it to them. They were extremely touched by this move.

They had already received too much from her, how could they take the spirit stones?

“The fat catfishes here seem to be interested in these spirit stones. Since we’re going to be spending some time here, you will need it to win more spirit stones. Just take it. At most, you can return it to me when you win more spirit stones in the future,” Ye Qingtang smiled as she said.

Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo didn’t seem like bad people. Since they had all come into an unfamiliar environment, they should help each other out. It definitely beat having to fight battles.

Despite her words, Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were still hesitant. They exchanged glances before they finally spoke.

“Miss Ye, thank you for your kind intentions. However, we’re not familiar with gambling and we’re afraid that we will lose these spirit stones if we’re not careful enough. We’re not as lucky as Miss Ye so...”

“What if I tell you that you can have such good luck too?” The corners of Ye Qingtang’s lips raised into a cunning smile.

“What?” Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were shocked.

Ye Qingtang didn’t say much. She stretched her hand out to show them.

It was dark but Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo could see a thin strand of hair around Ye Qingtang’s finger.

The hair was extremely thin and if one didn’t observe carefully, it was barely noticeable in the dark.

“Miss ye, you...” Baili Xi and Mu Feiruo were perplexed.

Ye Qingtang let out a sigh.

These two were too honest. They probably focused all their attention on cultivation and didn’t think of anything else other than it, let alone scheming tactics of gambling.

Right at that moment, Ye Qingtang picked up a piece of stone that was about the size of a dice and wrapped the strand of hair around it.
