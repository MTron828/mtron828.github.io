Back then, she remembered how she used to touch his armor, running her fingers over the dark ridges that were filled with the warmth from his body. But why.... Why did she only remember that familiar black armor only now...?

Now they had well and truly missed each other...

The Cursed True God picked up every piece of the shattered armor, cherishing it dearly. Once it was in her hands, her body started to fade, shattering into translucent specks that slowly disappeared in front of their eyes.

There were sounds of clattering.

Before she completely disappeared, the pieces of black armor dropped onto the ground.

At the same time, the clamor from the undead seemed to fall to a muted state, as the bodies suddenly stopped moving and stiffened, filling the destroyed land with a deafening silence.

“Quick, go and destroy the Cursed True God’s remains! Her resentment has disappeared!” Little White Tiger quickly reacted.

Ye Qingtang was slightly stunned. Lifting her eyes, she saw that a female skeleton lay at the position where the remains of Cursed True God was previously.

As Ye Qingtang walked over, a complicated feeling washed over her.

The Cursed True God’s resentment was due to the betrayal of humans, but Tu Fu’s supposed betrayal maximized it. When the misunderstanding was resolved, exacerbated by the sacrifice of Tu Fu’s life, she could finally let her resentment go.

“Who was ultimately at fault?” Ye Qingtang mused as she looked down at the Cursed True God’s remains. Suddenly she went down on knee, bowing towards the Cursed True God’s remains.

After all, the primordial humans were the ones who betrayed their creator. Since the Cursed True God was part of the Gods, how could she not have any resentment?

Being a human, entering this mystic realm and having to suffer from the strength of the curse, Ye Qingtang was a victim. However, the true gods that descended a couple hundred thousand years ago were also victims.

Ye Qingtang never believed in gods, but she truly admired the heartfelt love between the Cursed True God and Heavenly Demon, Tu Fu.

Stretching out her palm, Ye Qingtang summoned the black flames and started burning the remains of the Cursed True God.

As the remains of the Cursed True God continued to burn, the undead on the ground started recovering their human state.

The huge crack on the ground started mending and the undead masses finally recovered their freedom.

But that freedom... wasn’t true freedom.

They were alive, but they could never leave this mystic realm. Although the Cursed True God had disappeared, the remnants of her life force were still left behind in the mystic realm.

The only difference now was that they had the option of death. No longer were they forced into the endless, torturous limbo between life and death.

Ye Qingtang watched as the remains of the Cursed True God burned into ashes. She silently transferred the ashes into a container, collecting the shattered pieces of Tu Fu’s armor and buried it in the Cemetery of the True Gods.

No one could determine who was right or wrong.

Everyone had different circumstances and experiences...

It is never black or white, right or wrong.

Taking in a deep breath, Ye Qingtang felt an inexplicable feeling from the Deity Ocean, a subtle change passing throughout her body. Her heart palpitated.

She instantly took Little White Tiger with her, wanting to take the three together with her. However...

When Ye Qingtang looked at the Cemetery of the True Gods, feeling extremely stifled...

Though the remains of the Cursed True God had been successfully destroyed, that... little glutton would never come back. She didn’t even get to collect its corpse.

Little Heavenly Demon was an evolution from Tu Fu’s remaining life force, but for Ye Qingtang... it was her unique Little Heavenly Demon.

However...

There was nothing she could do. Ye Qingtang lowered her eyes. She could finally leave this place.

How many others would never be able to leave this mystic realm?

As Ye Qingtang mulled over those thoughts, the Deity Ocean in her body could somehow sense that she was going to leave. The dimensional door suddenly opened.

This time, the distortion of the space-time continuum was much more stable.

Ye Qingtang froze. Could this be the reason why the Deity Ocean kept her from leaving previously?

Was it because of the force from the Cursed True God’s resentment?

Ye Qingtang didn’t dare continue thinking about it. She hurriedly took Little White Tiger and the three others with her as they leaped into the dimensional door. She also wasn’t certain about whether the Deity Ocean would send her back here again. But at least, she had tried...

After they entered the dimensional door and the door closed, many speckles of light appeared above the void of the Cemetery of the True Gods. The speckles gathered and formed into a tiny, black figure...
