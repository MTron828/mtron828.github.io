Chapter 2158: My Student (2)

“He should have known when to stop even if they were just practicing,” Di Nuo said coldly.

With Di Nuo’s support, Meng Yao became even more aggressive in her provocations.

“Teacher Ye, how is that even considered practicing? Jing Ze was clearly trying to end Zhang Qiqiu’s life.”

Ye Qingtang looked coldly at Meng Yao, who tried to distort the truth.

End his life?

The one who wanted to end someone else’s life was Zhang Qiqiu and not Jing Ze. If she hadn’t arrived in time, Mu Ziying and Zhang Qiqiu would have tortured Jing Ze and Mu Ziying to death.

So it seemed that they planned to disregard her?

“Teacher Ye, this is the martial arts faculty. Furthermore, you’re not an official teacher here. Even if you are, you shouldn’t be meddling in the martial arts faculty’s affairs.” Di Nuo spoke up. He wasn’t planning on sparing any mercy.

This youth was an eyesore to him ages ago and it so happened that he caused some trouble on his territory today.

“Take Jing Ze to the discipline hall.” Di Nuo didn’t bother with Ye Qing. He merely gave the orders for Jing Ze to be taken away.

“This had nothing to do with Brother Jing Ze. Meng Yao and Zhang Qiqiu attacked me first!” Mu Ziying didn’t want Jing Ze to take the blame and spoke up immediately.

Di Nuo’s expression darkened when he saw Mu Ziying in a pathetic state, with a huge coat covering her body.

“Mu Ziying. Even if you’re young and ignorant, you should know that it’s against the Netherworld Academy’s rules to be dressed in this fashion!” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Di Nuo’s scolding made Meng Yao and the others snicker.

Di Nuo was most concerned about the student’s capabilities. Jing Ze was weak and Di Nuo naturally didn’t like him. Though Mu Ziying was not too bad, she was constantly distracted during cultivation and had an eccentric personality. He wasn’t able to control her and so she naturally wasn’t one of his favorites.

“What the f*ck, Teacher Di Nuo is too much! He didn’t even bother to ask about what had happened and he’s already assigning blame?” Lei Yan was getting more aggravated by the domineering Di Nuo. Likewise, Di Nuo was also unhappy with him all along since he was lowly skilled and played around too much.

“Stop talking already. If Teacher Di hears you, you’ll be in trouble too.” Another youth tried to shut Lei Yan up.

Lei Yan lip’s twitched and he stopped talking even if he was still unhappy with Di Nuo’s domineering ways.

Everyone knew what had happened, but Di Nuo seemed like he wasn’t planning to ask at all. After all, they were useless in his eyes and no matter what they did, it would be wrong.

Mu Ziying’s face turned pale and she bit down on her lips after being lectured by Di Nuo.

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank when she saw Jing Ze and Mu Ziying’s response.

Right when Jing Ze was about to be taken away, Ye Qingtang pulled Jing Ze behind her.

“Teacher Ye, you are not a teacher at the martial arts faculty. Please leave right now, don’t even try to meddle in Jing Ze’s affairs,” Di Nuo warned.

“I’m not a teacher at the martial arts faculty so I naturally won’t try to get involved...”

That made Di Nuo relax his guard a little, but when Jing Ze and Mu Ziying heard that, their hearts sank.

They understood her though.

After all, she was new to the Netherworld Academy. Why would she go against Di Nuo just for them, especially when they weren’t skilled at all?
