Then, Ye Qingtang opened her space ring.

Perfected Xuanchen did not have any emotions on his face while Yan Shu’s expression darkened.

Does this Ye Chen fellow have any brains?

Master has already rejected him straightforwardly, but he still did not leave.

Apprenticeship gift?

Does he think that Master is an ordinary person and will be bribed so easily like Xiong Feng?

“Young Sir Ye, my master has already said that he is no longer accepting any disciples. You can bring your apprenticeship gift back…” Yan Shu wanted to chase away this young man who had no sense of propriety, but when he spoke halfway, he saw Ye Qingtang taking out a slab of metal… Instantly, Yan Shu’s words were stuck in his throat.

Ye Qingtang took out a slab of meteoric iron from her space ring.

In an instant, Perfected Xuanchen’s eyes flickered the moment he saw that slab of meteoric iron although there were no emotions on his face initially.

“Millennium Meteoric Iron?!” Xiong Feng’s eyes almost popped out as he stared at the slab of Millennium Meteoric Iron on Ye Qingtang’s hand.

What joke is this?

This fellow actually has Millennium Meteoric Iron?

Xiong Feng originally thought that the three items Ye Qingtang took out previously were already rare, and the apprenticeship gift she prepared for Perfected Xuanchen should also be a rare treasure.

Yet, unexpectedly…

This could not be generalized as rare.

“I heard that you’ve always wanted to forge a sword with Millennium Meteoric Iron. I happen to have some Millennium Meteoric Iron. I wonder if you like it?” Ye Qingtang looked up at Perfected Xuanchen.

Being by Perfected Xuanchen’s side for many years in her past life, she naturally knew how desperate his need was for the Millennium Meteoric Iron.

“As long as you’re willing to accept me as your disciple, I’ll offer this Millennium Meteoric Iron to you as a form of respect,” Ye Qingtang said.

Perfected Xuanchen frowned slightly.

He had been searching for the Millennium Meteoric Iron for nearly ten years to no avail. Yet unexpectedly… he would actually see it in this young man’s hands today.

Yan Shu was also dumbfounded.

His Master held the noble position of Falling Sky Valley’s Valley Master and had seen many precious treasures before.

If this young man took out any other thing, it would definitely be unable to move his Master. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

But this Millennium Meteoric Iron…

Yan Shu had been following Perfected Xuanchen for a long time and spent a lot of effort with some senior and junior brothers to find this Millennium Meteoric Iron in recent years. Yet, they were not successful.

However, this young man took such a huge slab of Millennium Meteoric Iron and claimed that it was an apprenticeship gift.

At that moment…

Yan Shu did not dare to say anything and could only turn to look at Perfected Xuanchen silently.

Xiong Feng, who had not said anything all this while, started pondering. From the start, he felt that this Ye Chen’s background was not ordinary as the treasures in his hands seemed to be endless, whereby he even took out the Millennium Meteoric Iron now.

If he helped him again, this generous fellow might even give him some good things.

Xiong Feng, who originally intended to watch from the sidelines, was suddenly active. “Valley Master, I think that Ye Chen is pretty sincere in being apprenticed to you. This Millennium Meteoric Iron is extremely rare, yet he could bring it to you. It seems that he had been making preparations for a long time. Such mellow youths are rare already. You have always cherished talents. How about giving Ye Chen a chance?”
