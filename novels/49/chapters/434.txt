Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Qinglin Sect Elders’ faces clouded. The progress of the competition now was way beyond their expectations.

“This…”

The Wind Moon Sect Elder could not believe that a reserve disciple of Xuanling Sect could possess such ability?!

“She must be the hidden force of Xuanling Sect…”

Another Wind Moon Sect Elder appeared to be contemplating.

Elder Qin stared at Ye Qingtang with his mouth trembling slightly, but he did not say anything.

Elder Mo was completely shocked. He had never known that his in-name disciple’s Martial skills had reached such a level!

The competition between Ye Qingtang and Fu Lingtian had not ended yet.

Ye Qingtang’s movement techniques were unique, and she was very fierce with her attacks. Fu Lingtian could not even defend himself.

“You…!”

Fu Lingtian gritted his teeth, and cold sweat appeared on his head.

His right hand was fractured by Ye Qingtang. Unless he revealed his true ability, he would not be able to fight anymore.

However…

Ye Qingtang’s every move was fatal. Clearly, she did not want to let him go easily.

“I give….” Fu Lingtian did not dare to use his full strength and decided to give up.

However, before he could finish his words, he was stopped by Ye Qingtang’s attack.

“She wants to kill me?!”

Fu Lingtian was shocked. He was busy defending himself against Ye Qingtang’s killing moves. There was no chance for him to give up. The woman in front of him did not even give him any time to give up.

Qinglin Sect obviously noticed Fu Lingtian’s situation.

“Such a vicious lady. How dare you to intend to kill the talent of my sect?”

One of the Qinglin Sect Elders shouted, and a strong Martial breath spread all over the place.

The Elder was about to jump over to the ring the next second.

“Humph!”

Elder Mo’s eyes were cold as he saw the Qinglin Sect Elder was about to interfere. He grunted loudly and slapped the table heavily. A shadow split out of his body.

“Boom!”

A loud sound was heard when the table broke.

“Elder Mo, you…” The Qinglin Sect Elder frowned.

“Elder Qian, the competition has not ended yet. How dare you to have the intention to kill my disciple?!” Elder Mo’s Martial breath was so intense that he appeared to be so majestic in front of everyone. He stared fiercely at Elder Qian.

“When did I want to kill your disciple? I just wanted to end the competition. Apparently, your disciple wants to murder Fu Lingtian!” Elder Qin of the Qinglin Sect sneered.

“Such a joke.”

Elder Mo was expressionless, but his tone was very mighty. “If Qingtang really does kill Fu Lingtian, I will definitely punish her heavily. However, before the competition ends, I will kill anyone who dares to interfere!”

“You!”

Elder Qian of the Qinglin Sect stared at Elder Mo in rage.

He knew that he was not a qualified opponent of Elder Mo. If he interfered forcefully, it would be detrimental to both sects.

“Well, well, well!”

Elder Qian repeated himself three times.

“If Fu Lingtian is really killed by your sect’s disciple, I’ll see what you are going to say!”

Elder Qian then returned to the area for Qinglin Sect. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Humph!”

Elder Mo grunted again and returned.

Disciples of the Xuanling Sect were surprised. Elder Mo defended Ye Qingtang and was even willing to provoke Qinglin Sect Elder. However, Elder Mo did not seem to take his in-name disciple to heart previously. But now…

Boom!

A hitting sound stopped everyone’s thoughts.

Fu Lingtian was kicked by Ye Qingtang at his abdomen area, and his body flew ten meters away. He was close to falling off the ring.
