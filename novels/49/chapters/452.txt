Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The skills of this Yunxiao Sect disciple were indeed good and were similarly at First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. Yi Tianchou knew that even if he could kill the Yunxiao Sect disciple, he would be wounded as well.

It would naturally be the best if the person gave in and left.

However…

“What a joke!” The Yunxiao Sect disciple scoffed. “Yi Tianchou, aren’t you too bold? Do you know that this Spirit Life Flower is an item that Ye You, the Holy Lady of my Yunxiao Sect, wants? How dare you fight with Senior Sister Ye You for it?!”

When mentioning Ye You, the eyes of this Yunxiao Sect disciple were full of worship and adoration. Ever since Ye You entered the sect, she was regarded highly by the Sect Master of Yunxiao Sect and was conferred as the Holy Lady of Yunxiao Sect. It goes without saying that her position in the sect was extremely high.

“Humph!” Yi Tianchou scoffed. “Whoever it is, this Spirit Life Flower is mine today. Since you can’t appreciate my kindness and want death, I’ll grant you that!”

“Yi Tianchou, you have a death wish!”

Before Yi Tianchou made any move, the Yunxiao Sect disciple took the advantage of striking first as he drew out a long sword from the scabbard on his waist with a crisp?clang. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

As he waved his sword, the image of the sword was like a screen which almost turned into a substantial sword aura that charged towards Yi Tianchou.

“Overconfident!” A cold glint twinkled in Yi Tianchou’s eyes as he launched a strike with his palm that crushed the sword aura of the Yunxiao Sect disciple.

That Yunxiao Sect disciple was actually rather skilled, but his cultivation was at the mid-stage of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three while Yi Tianchou’s skills had already reached the perfected stage of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. Regardless of the background and experience in the realm, he was superior to the Yunxiao Sect disciple.

At that instant, Ye Qingtang was standing near the huge rock where she spectated the match between Yi Tianchou and the Yunxiao Sect disciple with indifference. An icy scoff that was hard to detect hung on the corner of her lips.

…

Boom!

A loud bang echoed throughout the surrounding area.

The Yunxiao Sect disciple was hit on his abdomen by Yi Tianchou and was flung out like a kite with a snapped string.

However, Yi Tianchou did not have a large gain. His left shoulder was stabbed by the Yunxiao Sect disciple, and fresh blood stained his sleeves red in a moment. Under the tattered clothes was a ghastly sword wound so deep that his bones could be seen.

“Little brat of Yunxiao Sect, I think you’re tired of living!” Yi Tianchou was utterly wrathful after being injured by the Yunxiao Sect disciple. He lifted his right arm and fiercely waved it in the air.

In a moment, a hurricane ensued, and the force of the primordial qi condensed into a giant golden palm in the air.

The speed of the giant golden palm was extremely rapid as it dove down at the Yunxiao Sect disciple.

Caught off-guard, the Yunxiao Sect disciple was suppressed by the giant golden palm. With a loud “woah,” he spat out large mouthfuls of blood.

“Tsk tsk… I’ve been stuck in the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three for five years while you advanced to First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three for at most two years… How can you be my opponent?” Yi Tianchou snickered evilly as he walked towards the Yunxiao Sect disciple with a brutal expression.

“Sword of the Heaven Technique!”

The Yunxiao Sect shouted.

“Destroy!”

As the Yunxiao Sect disciple spoke, the long sword in his hand charged towards Yi Tianchou at the speed of lightning.

Upon seeing this, Yi Tianchou’s expression changed, and he hurriedly retreated, temporarily avoiding the tip of the sword.

The force of the primordial qi with a breath of destruction on the long sword was extremely terrifying.

While Yi Tianchou’s speed was swift and was not stabbed by the long sword, the breath of destruction within the sword wounded him.
