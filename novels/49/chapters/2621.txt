Chapter 2622 Fighting the Skies (3)

The Feng Family Patriarch looked at her in shock.

At that moment, Ye Qingtang looked like a god as she floated in the air with her white hair floating around her and her eyes white as snow…

She opened her mouth and said lightly, “It’s nothing.”

Hearing her say that, the Feng Family Patriarch’s lips twitched, as though he wanted to say something. But he ultimately decided to remain silent.

The Ye Qingtang in front of him seemed like an entirely different person. Her appearance and aura seemed to be completely different from the Ye Qingtang before.

Not only that, but he was also sure that the current Ye Qingtang was vastly stronger than before. He felt a great sense of oppression as he stood next to her. It was as though the air had thickened around them, making it hard for him to breathe.

She raised her hands slightly. Feng Jiuyou and Feng Wuyin who had been affected by the Calamity of Wrath were dragged up by an invisible force.

Seeing that, the members of the Feng family turned their stunned gazes to Ye Qingtang, who was floating in the air as well.

As she had said, she was from the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain, where their martial arts were not even at the level of the Divine Venerate Domain.

What a terrifying aura… Was she really human?

Naturally, Ye Qingtang had no idea what the Feng family thought of her and bore no interest in finding out. Instead, she turned her eyes to the Heavenly Emperor in the air. Han Cangming had already slipped away to some unknown location. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

All the while she held her gaze steady but suddenly looked over at something that stunned her. There was a huge shadow behind the thunder clouds, like a human hiding in the dark.

“Who is that…” Her eyebrows furrowed slightly. Who was that person who would go so close to the Calamity of Wrath? Even the Heavenly Emperor wouldn’t be able to do that.

But the shadow was too blurry and Ye Qingtang couldn’t see it properly with her eyesight.

“Patriarch, look over there. It’s a person,”

She pointed at the thunder clouds.

The shadow was huge, larger than they could imagine and they spotted it in an instant.

“Huh?”

Hearing what she said, the Feng Family Patriarch turned to look at what she was pointing at.

But he could only see the thunder clouds.

“Lady Ye… what person did you see?” he asked as he looked at her again. “I have no idea who that is, which is why I’m asking you,” she said.

“But… Ye Qingtang, I don’t see anything,” the family clan patriarch said as he shook his head.

“You don’t see it?” Her expression was strange. They were not blind after all and should be able to see it at one glance.

“Lady Ye, I don’t see anything,” the Feng Family Patriarch said as he shook his head.

“Lady Ye, what exactly do you see?”

Mother Feng was extremely curious as well and she looked at where Ye Qingtang was pointing, but couldn’t see anything as well.

“Jiuyou, Wuyin, can you see it?”

Ye Qingtang asked them.

“Sister Ye Yue, I don’t see anything,” Jiuyou said. There was nothing there…
