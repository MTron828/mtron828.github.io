Chapter 2738: Return to the Blue Sky Domain (3)

The star spirit said, “But I also didn’t say that I would impart it to you directly. The power of the Heavenly Dao is in the void. You must have the ability to take it away.”

“Oh…”

Ye Qingtang nodded and immediately used the power of her Heavenly Demon Bloodline.

In the next second, all the Heavenly Dao energy was absorbed by Ye Qingtang.

However, when she was absorbing it, Ye Qingtang realized that her Heart of the Heavenly Dao was actually competing with her.

A cold glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes and she used her divine power to suppress the Heart of the Heavenly Dao.

“No, you must not have it. How dare you fight me for the power of the Heavenly Dao!”

A guide in the Heart of the Heavenly Dao suddenly shouted hoarsely. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“You have completely surpassed the limits. You will be severely punished. You have already angered the Master and he will find you!”

“Who is your Master?” Ye Qingtang used the power of her soul to communicate with the guide. However, the guide did not continue speaking.

An ominous feeling arose in Ye Qingtang’s heart.

After absorbing all the Heavenly Dao energy, Ye Qingtang left the constellation.

Once she had left, the star spirit wandered in the void and smiled. “What a genius. Her cultivation level improved even faster than I imagined.”

...

The big yellow dog had returned by then.

“How are your clansmen?” Ye Qingtang asked the little white tiger softly.

The little white tiger’s gaze landed on the big yellow dog, its eyes filled with fear. “What… What kind of monster is it…”

How powerful were those Heaven-Devouring Beasts? In the end, they were all killed by this big yellow dog within seconds.

“It…” Ye Qingtang smiled.

How could the second Tian not be powerful?

The little white tiger stared at Ye Qingtang. What did she experience at the time when she was gone? She had already become extremely powerful and even had such a terrifying friend by her side.

“By the way, I have something to tell you,” The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang.

“What is it?” Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

“It’s about the guide and the vessel.” The little white tiger seemed to be in deep thought. “Actually, someone told me that… there’s actually a guide living in your heart. The purpose of the guide is to help you find stronger protection… so that you can become stronger and properly nurture the heart in your body.”

“I know,” Ye Qingtang said.

The little white tiger was surprised. “You already know?”

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Then do you know that the guide will ensure you survive until… the Heart of the Heavenly Dao is powerful enough? The true owner of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao will then kill you and take away the Heart of the Heavenly Dao,” the little white tiger continued.

“I know too,” Ye Qingtang said. “Who told you all this? Ling Yan?”

“No, it was not Ling Yan.” The little white tiger shook its head. “It was a mysterious old elder.”

“Elder?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. “Who is that elder? Why did he tell you all of this?”

“I’m not sure about that… Actually, I wanted to tell you this a long time ago, but… little azure dragon refused to let me tell you. It was worried there would be trouble if you knew.” The little white tiger sighed.

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought.

A mysterious elder…

Who was it and what was his motive?

Ye Qingtang just wanted to know who the owner of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao was.
