The moment Sang Feiyu finished her sentence, a streak of light suddenly flashed out!

Boom! A thunderous sound with an intense aftershock shook the entire surroundings.

Jiang Yanyun and Baili Xuanyun moved so quickly that no one could see them clearly. Jiang Yiran could only widen his eyes in shock.

“What the hell! Brother Yun is this powerful?” Jiang Yiran was full of respect and admiration. He seldom witnessed Jiang Yanyun’s fights and this was the first time he experienced just how mighty he was.

The other Jiang family youths were even more stunned. They now understood how terrifying the battles for the top ten were. This was definitely way beyond their league.

Fighters who had attained the Fourth Heaven of the Heavenly Venerate realm were already close to the Fifth Heaven, and Fifth Heaven was when the most crucial transformative change would occur.

Everyone below the arena could feel the powerful shockwaves and they did not dare to stand too near. They subconsciously started to back away.

“Now this is a challenge” Blood surged through Zhan Rao’s veins as he watched. He was itching to get on stage to fight himself.

Baili Xuanyun and Jiang Yanyun had already exchanged at least 10 blows over this short period of time. The crowd was completely dazzled by the streaks of light and those weaker members of the audience were having difficulty breathing just from the shockwaves.

Only Baili Xi and the other fighters in the top ten remained indifferent as they observed the fight from nearby. They appeared totally unaffected by the power exuded.

Elder Qian and the rest watched on nervously from their seating area. They were feeling hopeful when they saw that Jiang Yanyun seemed to be on par with Baili Xuanyun.

If Jiang Yanyun could defeat Baili Xuanyun, then he would immediately take over the sixth position!

This result would be even better than they initially expected.

Nevertheless, Elder Baili continued to watch the proceedings with a smile.

It must be admitted that Jiang Yanyun, as the top descendant of the Jiang family, did possess strong powers. He would have definitely have won if he was fighting against the Baili Xuanyun who had been competing in the Martial Arts Championship for the first time.

However...

Things were different now.

In the next second, a huge boom rocked the entire arena and the two men flew up into the sky like a spiralling dragon. But Jiang Yanyun appeared to have suffered an injury as they clashed. The spirit energy surrounding his body cracked and he plummeted to the ground as the powerful force from Baili Xuanyun’s attack hit him front on.

“Crash!!”

The resounding crash seemed to shatter the eardrums of the crowd. Up in the empty sky, Baili Xuanyun gave a smug smile. He gazed down imperiously at the fallen, pale-faced Jiang Yanyun.

At this moment, Jiang Yanyun was already bleeding profusely from the nose. His body swayed as he struggled to regain full control of his faculties.

Elder Qian and the rest jumped up from their seats in shock.

“It looks like our Xuanyun has won.” Elder Baili chuckled. That arrogant tone was utterly disgusting. After admiring the grim faces of the Jiang family, he finally turned and left.

A venomous glint flashed across Baili Xuanyun’s eyes. He lifted one arm and a streak of lightning shot down from the sky straight toward the vulnerable Jiang Yanyun!

“Brother Yun!” Jiang Yiran’s heart stopped.

The steak of lightning struck Jiang Yiran. Even though he managed to surround himself with spirit energy at the last minute as a defence, he was blasted straight out of the arena and landed on the ground with a heavy thud.

What followed was a deafening roar of silence.
