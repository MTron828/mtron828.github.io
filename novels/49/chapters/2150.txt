Chapter 2151: Humiliation (1)

The students who had been practicing on their own at the martial arts faculty’s practice arena had all gathered around one spot. It was a noisy, messy crowd.

“Jing Ze, when did you become so bold? You dare to stand up for someone else?” A tall, brawny teenager gazed mockingly at Jing Ze, who was standing in front of him.

At this moment, a pale-faced Jing Ze was standing in the crowd. Behind him was the petite Mu Ziying. One side of her face was already red and swollen.

Jing Ze and Mu Ziying were amongst the students practicing on their own in the practice arena as they had been trying out Ye Qingtang’s teachings. But Meng Yao, who had suffered under Ye Qingtang’s hands earlier, had brought a few teenagers over to seek out Mu Ziying.

Before Jing Ze could understand what was going on, Meng Yao’s friend, Zhang Qiqiu, had slapped Mu Ziying across the face.

Zhang Qiqiu entered the academy at the same time as Jing Ze. Their abilities were similar then, but after so many years, Jing Ze’s cultivation level remained stagnant while Zhang Qiqiu had already reached the Paragon Seventh Heaven level.

Zhang Qiqiu would often bully Jing Ze, who would quietly endure it. But today, after seeing Mu Ziying being beaten, Jing Ze finally couldn’t tolerate it anymore. He stepped forward.

“Zhang Qiqiu, if you have any problem, come and look for me...” For the first time in his life, Jing Ze was speaking up against Zhang Qiqiu. But his voice was trembling with anxiety and his face was pale.

“Jing Ze, leave. They are here for me.” Mu Ziying held her swollen cheek.

“No.” Jing Ze immediately shook his head.

The two of them were under Ye Qingtang’s mentorship and so Jing Ze naturally treated the younger Mu Ziying as his junior sister. As useless as he was, he could not just stand by and watch his own junior sister get beaten.

“Oh, trying to be a hero? Jing Ze, are you itching for a beating? Have you looked at yourself in the mirror? You dare to try and be a hero? What? Have you already forgotten your place because I have not given you a good thrashing lately?” Zhang Qiqiu cracked his knuckles loudly.

Everyone in the academy knew that Jing Ze had a timid personality and his powers were only mediocre. As a result, he was often bullied and Zhang Qiqiu was one of the culprits.

Although Zhang Qiqiu was not considered outstanding in the Netherworld Academy, he could easily suppress a useless student like Jing Ze. As a result, he would often bully Jing Ze, finding any excuse to beat him up, just to show off his power. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The surrounding teenagers all paused in their activities to watch the scene. Everyone knew that Jing Ze was ranked last in the entire Netherworld Academy. Beating up Jing Ze was a common pastime for many of the more nasty students. Everyone felt that there was nothing wrong with bullying Jing Ze.

In the Netherworld Academy, he was like a dog whom anyone could kick while he was down.

Now, it seemed that this dog had learned how to bark.

“Mu Ziying, you are really shameless. You hid behind that new teacher previously to save your own life. And now, you managed to hook onto this foolish boy. I didn’t expect a young girl like you to know how to seduce others.” Meng Yao folded her arms across her chest as she grinned wickedly at Mu Ziying.

How could she forget her earlier humiliation? She could not take revenge on Ye Qing, but it would be no problem for her to take her anger out on this wretched little girl.
