Chapter 1765: Impossible To Escape (3)

In the next second, the fiendish demon let out a sky-splitting roar and rushed towards Ye Qingtang and the little fiendish demons with its friends, wanting to devour them!

Ye Qingtang’s heart turned cold. Both she and the little fiendish demons were going to die here today.

As eight black shadows rushed towards them, sounds of hurried footsteps came from behind them.

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly, her view completely filled with the sight of the fiendish demons about to pounce on them. While they surrounded her, the little fiendish demons were all shaking with fear yet didn’t back down a single inch.

At this critical moment, the footsteps behind Ye Qingtang suddenly vanished.

In the next second, a ferocious tiger-like figure leaped from behind Ye Qingtang and crashed straight into the incoming murderous fiendish demons!

With the appearance of that one figure, many black figures appeared around them and all rushed towards them as well. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The demons howled and pounced on the eight demons attacking them.

Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground as the demons in front of her began slaughtering each other.

“It’s the Great Sages! The Great Sages are here!” The sharp noses of the demons around Ye Qingtang had picked up a familiar scent and they opened their eyes in excitement.

Ye Qingtang’s scent of smell was nothing compared to the demons and she couldn’t differentiate their scent. But if the little fiendish demons were saying that, the demons who had just come had to be from the eastern camp.

In the blink of an eye, the two clans were swept into battle. Teeth and claws became the most valuable weapon in this simple but violent fight, Blood splattered all over the place as a metallic scent filled the air.

The eastern camp was obviously at an advantage here. The eight attacking demons had originally been planning a secret attack and hadn’t expected that the demons who had stayed behind to take care of things would appear. The two groups fought to the death as the fight intensified.

Ye Qingtang felt her heart slowly calm down as she looked at the demons around her. Her eyes darted around her as she tried making use of the chaos to slip away.

The demon blood on her was useless now.

The aura-masking elixir would only mask Ye Qingtang’s scent and not the scent of demon blood on her.

Ye Qingtang wanted to use this opportunity to sneak away, wash the demon blood off herself and quickly leave the dangerous valley. But...

Now she was surrounded by a constant crowd of little fiendish demons, so she couldn’t budge at all.

If she left now, it would definitely look suspicious.

As Ye Qingtang was agonizing over what to do, the eastern camp demons had already taken advantage of their numbers and killed the eight demons who had tried to attack them.

Within moments, the bodies of the eight fiendish demons lay on the ground as the strong smell of blood permeated the air.

Seeing the eight demons die, the scared little fiendish demons all breathed out a sigh of relief. They would have become the demons’ food if the demons from their camp hadn’t come.

The victorious eighth division would soon have the bodies of the defeated demons carved up, the internal organs eaten. After the commotion, Ye Qingtang caught the eye of a slightly bigger demon.
