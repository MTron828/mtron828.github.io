The Ancient You Clan was forcing the ancient clans to reveal themselves.

Although Ming Di had killed off those two youths, the Ancient You Clan did not slow down their massacre. Several other exemplary youths had appeared during this period of time. Like the first two, they were all very young but extremely powerful.

Everyone was shocked and intimidated by this display of the Ancient You Clan’s might. No one knew just how many more such formidable youths the Ancient You Clan had.

In the entire mainland, only the Temple of Shadows could stand up against that clan.

Those first few ancient clans who had sought protection under the Temple of Shadows couldn’t help feeling relieved that they took such quick action. They managed to lead their people to the Temple of Shadows before the Ancient You Clan went on their killing spree.

Otherwise, they would probably end up like the Qinyue Clan—with a large portion of their own people being held hostage to force them to emerge.

If they didn’t turn up, those people would die horrible deaths.

If they did...

With their current capabilities, they would be just like lambs sent for slaughter!

Ye Qingtang’s heart sank on hearing their discussion. She had yet to find out the whereabouts of Jiang Lang and his wife. The thing that worried her the most was the two of them falling into the hands of the Ancient You Clan.

First, she had to confirm if Jiang Lang and his wife were among the hostages. In addition... she had to make use of this chance to thoroughly investigate the current power of the Ancient You Clan.

Even as Ye Qingtang soothed over the rising emotions of the ancient clan folks, she couldn’t help worrying over the hostages held by the Ancient You Clan. As no one could tell her if Jiang Lang and his wife were among the hostages, the only way was to personally go over to take a look.

There was no time like the present. Ye Qingtang decided to investigate that very night with Ming Di.

After knowing Ye Qingtang’s plans, the other ancient clan folks requested to go along with her, so that they could help her if required.

How could Ye Qingtang not see through to their true intentions?

They were just worried that without Ming Di and her around, there would be no one strong enough to protect the Temple of Shadows. In other words, they were only scared of death.

Ye Qingtang knew that they would find all sorts of excuses to tag along even if she objected to their request now. By then, things might get messy and she might accidentally expose her true identity. As a result, she granted her approval on the condition that they followed her instructions to a tee.

The various ancient clans had no objections to that at all.

Those few ancient clans who had just arrived, including the Qinyue Clan, also chose to tag along despite having had no time to rest.

With Ye Qingtang and Ming Di around, they finally had some hope of rescuing their own people.

After all, with their lack of abilities, there was no way they would dare to make any moves on their own.

...

Somewhere in a canyon situated in the territory of the Ancient You Clan, two Ancient You Clan sentries were guarding the entrance. Several sizable metal cages were placed close by.

The cages were crammed full of haggard and despondent-looking prisoners, who were wearing the uniforms of the various ancient clans. The family emblems which had once brought them great honor had now become the reason behind their wretched state.

It was dawn. The sky started to brighten and a chilly wind blew into the valley. Exposed to the elements, the bone-chilling wind blew into the cages, making the prisoners shiver from the cold.

Most of them had suffered severe injuries. Their clothes were splattered with blood stains but none of their wounds had received any treatment. Ravaged by the howling winds, their life energy started to drain bit by bit as time went by...
