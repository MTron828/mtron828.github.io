Chapter 2136: Good Boy (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Jing Ze?

Ye Qingtang was taken aback when she heard the name.

She recalled the name Jing Ze from her past life memories 300 years into the future. But the Yun Mian Palace Master... He was an evil man who murdered many people...

This boy before her...

Ye Qingtang seriously suspected that they just happened to have the same name.

Apart from those two, the others ignored Ye Qingtang and went about their own matters.

In both her previous and current life, Ye Qingtang had stayed in her fair share of academies and sects. She had seen many strange disciples and students before, but they were considered normal compared to these few in front of her.

“Teacher Ye Qing, he is Nangong Lie and that is Lei Yan. As for this little girl, her name should be Mu Ziying. And that guy over there is Qin Feng.” Yun Chen saw that the rest were remaining silent and so good-naturedly introduced them all.

Ye Qingtang had heard about these few earlier. But now that she was seeing them in person, she still couldn’t help feeling somewhat shocked.

Especially Qin Feng who remained sprawled motionless at the back. A conflicted glint appeared in Ye Qingtang’s eyes.

Qin Feng was a disciple from the Qin family. And Ye Qingtang had ties with the Qin family.

She remembered meeting the Sword of Destruction Deity Qin Zhuo at the Cursed Land. Qin Zhuo belonged to the Qin family and before he went missing, the Qin family was considered one of the most powerful family clans in the Second Domain. But with the disappearance of Qin Zhuo and the Sword of Destruction, the Qin family lost their high standing and tumbled down the ranks.

It was all thanks to Qin Zhuo’s advice that Ye Qingtang was able to leave the Cursed Land. Otherwise, she would probably still be there living out a wretched life.

Ye Qingtang instinctively stroked her space ring. Before leaving, Qin Zhuo had handed the Sword of Destruction to her. He wanted her to hand it over to a descendant of the Qin family...

But she had no idea whether Qin Feng’s branch of the Qin family was the same as Qin Zhuo’s.

“I say, Teacher Ye. Your cultivation level doesn’t look that high.” Nangong Lie spoke up in a lazy manner. He was smiling but that smile failed to reach his eyes.

“That’s right. I am only at the Paragon Sixth Heaven level,” Ye Qingtang replied. She had improved her powers during this period of time but her current level was still considered nothing in the Second Domain.

Several of the teenagers shot her strange looks.

Lei Yan’s face instantly turned black. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“What the hell? Why did the Netherworld Academy assign such a piece of trash to teach us? Paragon Sixth Heaven level? A teacher? What kind of joke is this?”

Lei Yan was furious. In the entire Netherworld Academy, apart from the teachers at the medicine faculty, none of the other teachers were at the Paragon level. But they were now assigned a Paragon Sixth Heaven level teacher. Surely this must be a joke.

Nangong Lie’s smile widened as he folded his hands behind his head. “Sixth Heaven level. Excuse me Teacher Ye but I am slightly higher than you. So I won’t be listening to your teachings. I will take my leave first.”

With that, Nangong Lie started to leave. The others in the classroom didn’t speak but they likewise looked prepared to leave. Even the good-natured Yun Chen had also started to make his way out.

Within seconds, only Ye Qingtang and the stuttering Jing Ze were left in the classroom.

“Tea... Teacher Ye...” Jing Ze remained standing there obediently as he looked at Ye Qingtang in fear. Ye Qingtang watched the departing profiles of those teenagers impassively.

It was fine, there was still one left.
