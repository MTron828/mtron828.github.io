Chapter 1103 Eye Of Extermination (2)

Blood-red destructive forces continued to pour out of the giant eye in the void. Every arrow that flew out was the accumulation of destructive force. When they landed on various parts of the mainland, they completely exterminated every living thing there.

“We’ve been looking for you for a long time.”

As these things were going on, a group of men and women appeared in the void.

Yin Yang Child glared down at Ye Qingtang and laughed coldly.

Absolute Monarch of Heaven waved his hand, and everyone immediately descended into the valley. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

After the events of the Dragon Vein had concluded, they tried to leave the mainland, but for some reason, this mainland had been tightly sealed by someone. They had no way of breaking the seal from within and so had no choice but to stay in this mainland.

Ye Qingtang had obtained the incomparable Divine Phoenix’s Inheritance in the Dragon Vein, and everyone wanted to look for her to see if she could use the power of the Divine Phoenix to break the seal.

Everyone swiftly descended into the Falling Sky Valley.

Ye Qingtang looked at Yin Yang Child and the others who had suddenly arrived, and a trace of shock involuntarily flashed across her eyes. An idea suddenly rose in her heart.

“Everyone, please lend me a hand,” Ye Qingtang said as she looked at Absolute Monarch of Heaven and the others.

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, everyone was taken aback. They did not know what she meant.

“You want us to join forces and stop the Eye of Extermination?” A black-robed old man looked at Ye Qingtang.

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. The Eye of Extermination was formidable. By herself, she could not oppose it. Once the power of the Eye of Extermination engulfed them, not a soul would be left alive in the Falling Sky Valley.

Fortunately, Yin Yang Child and the others had arrived at an opportune moment. Ye Qingtang remembered the promise they had made when they had obtained the treasure from the Divine Phoenix’s inheritance.

This would certainly come in use now.

Everyone exchanged glances. Although they did not know why Ye Qingtang wanted to protect this area, they had promised the Divine Phoenix and signed a contract with it, agreeing to help the person who obtained the inheritance as much as possible.

The contract was linked to the girl who had obtained the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix, Ye Qingtang.

If Ye Qingtang had not used the power of the Divine Phoenix’s bloodline, they would not have been able to find her so quickly.

“Everyone, the power of the Eye of Extermination is great, but it is not difficult to block it,” Black and White Holy Son said.

The next second, amazing power flowed out around everyone. It formed into a substantial shield that could be seen by the naked eye, and it enclosed the Falling Sky Valley.

When the arrows of extermination fell on the shield jointly created by everyone, it was like water sinking into sand. It did not even leave any ripples.

After Ye Qingtang had left instructions with Absolute Monarch of Heaven, Black and White Holy Son, and the others, she headed for the Formidable Heavens Dynasty with the two children.

Nothing would go amiss in the Falling Sky Valley with the powerful cultivators in Central Mainland protecting it. However, based on their ability and foundation, the Ye and Si Families had no way of withstanding the power of the Eye of Extermination.

Ye Qingtang could not help but worry about the two children, so she had no choice but to bring them with her.

Ye Qingtang arrived at the Yunxiao Sect within a few hours.

The Ye Family’s headquarters had been moved here.

At first glance, she could tell that almost half the Yunxiao Sect had been destroyed by the power of the Eye of Extermination. Everyone from the Ye and Si Families was trying their best to hold out.

Although Ye Qingtang did not know why the Si Family was here, she had no time to ponder the matter further.

Swoosh!

At that moment, a blood-red arrow fell from the void and headed for the Yunxiao Sect.
