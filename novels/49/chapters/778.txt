Chapter 779 Putting On A Complete Show (2)

“Yin Qingluo, since you were at the scene just now, tell me what happened exactly,” Perfected Xuanchen said in a low voice. He did not fully believe Xuanyuan Lie’s words.

Yin Qingluo could only recount the incident in full details.

Perfected Xuanchen’s brows were slightly furrowed. He never thought that what Xuanyuan Lie said was actually true.

And what surprised him more was that Ye Qingtang actually forced those two Peerless School disciples to retreat just by herself.

“Ye Chen, what do you still have to say now? Kneel down now!” The Full Moon Peak Peak Master shouted coldly.

However, Ye Qingtang remained still and looked at the Full Moon Peak Peak Master coldly.

“The Peerless School is unrelated to me in any way. Why must I kneel? Since they were disrespectful first, what wrong do I have?”

“You’re still twisting logic and making fallacious arguments at this critical moment? The Peerless School is Falling Sky Valley’s distinguished guest, and the entire valley must be hospitable to them, but you offended the Peerless School envoys. Are you in the right?” The Full Moon Peak Peak Master bellowed coldly.

Ye Qingtang said, “The Peerless School is your guest, not mine. They’re just two ordinary disciples from the Peerless School. How are they distinguished guests?”

“You!” The Full Moon Peak Peak Master’s danger-filled eyes were narrowed into slits, and he immediately shouted. “Men, capture Ye Chen!”

Then, a few disciples in the main hall walked forward and wanted to seize Ye Qingtang down.

Ye Qingtang swept a glance at them and said coldly, “I came to Falling Sky Valley only for my Master. You all wish to capture me? What rights do you all have?”

Then, a strong overbearing force was emitted around Ye Qingtang, immediately draining all color from those disciples who closed in on her.

“The Peerless School people don’t even dare to touch me, and you all want to try?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Full Moon Peak Peak Master indifferently.

The Full Moon Peak Peak Master was slightly stunned. Never would he have thought that this new, plain-looking disciple would actually have such skills. The overbearing force Ye Qingtang exerted was one that his grandson, Xuanyuan Lie, could not even compare to!

The Peerless School did not dare to touch him?

Ye Qingtang’s words shocked everyone in the hall.

It was then that the Full Moon Peak Peak Master realized that under normal circumstances, although those two Peerless School disciples were in the disadvantageous situation, they should not have retreated suddenly.

As they looked at Ye Qingtang’s aura right now, hesitation arose in the Peak Masters’ hearts.

They did not know what this Ye Chen fellow’s identity was. All they knew was that he suddenly came to the Falling Sky Valley and wanted to be apprenticed to Perfected Xuanchen.

Moreover, the bribes that he gave to Xiong Feng before he was apprenticed were shockingly valuable.

Furthermore…

They heard that Master Du said that he was close friends with this fellow.

“Xuanyuan Lie, what happened exactly then? Did the Peerless School disciples really…” The Full Moon Peak Peak Master looked at Xuanyuan Lie with uncertainty.

Slightly dazed, Xuanyuan Lie replied after hesitating for a while. “When Ye Chen was exchanging blows with the two envoys, he mentioned the sea of clouds at Mount Qin… Afterward, the two envoys suddenly VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

left.”

Xuanyuan Lie did not understand what it meant either.

But just when Xuanyuan Lie mentioned the words “sea of clouds at Mount Qin”, the expressions of everyone at the hall changed. “You really heard Ye Chen saying sea of clouds at Mount Qin?” There was a subtle change in the Full Moon Peak Peak Master’s expression.

“Yes…” Xuanyuan Lie was bewildered. He did not know what these words meant and why even his grandfather would have such an expression when he heard it.
