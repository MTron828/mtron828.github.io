Chapter 1933: Battle My Steed First (3)

“No worries, I have a thick and tough hide.” Ming Di’s voice was tinged with amusement.

That amused tone drifted into the ears of the eight tribe leaders, making their hairs stand on end.

How many years had passed since they had heard that eerie, smiling tone?

The effeminate-looking youth clearly didn’t think much of Ming Di. Leaping into the air, he conjured a huge dragon with his hands, before directing it straight at Ming Di.

Ming Di remained standing steadily where he was, as he looked at the approaching dragon.

In the next second.

BOOM!

The fire dragon crashed into Ming Di, sending sparks flying all over. The earth-shaking sound nearly shattered the eardrums of everyone present.

The effeminate-looking youth smirked as he watched Ming Di being engulfed by the flames.

“Aiya, it’s so hot... I am nearly dying from the heat...” A low voice suddenly sounded out from the blaze.

The face of the effeminate-looking youth shifted. He watched as the flames were suddenly extinguished before his eyes and Ming Di emerged. A few tiny flames were still burning upon his black dragon scales.

Lifting one claw, Ming Di blew out the lingering flames with a snort of its nostrils.

The effeminate-looking youth was thunderstruck.

The eight tribe leaders nearly laughed out loud at the sight. Their faces turned red from the effort of suppressing their laughter.

“Kid, you shouldn’t play with fire. Were you trying to burn me to death?” Ming Di glanced at the effeminate-looking youth in provocation.

The youth studied the jet-black Ming Di, but couldn’t see if he was injured at all. He had wanted to kill Ming Di with just one blow as he was impatient to get this over with. Seeing that Ming Di was still standing and talking, the youth leaped into the air and burst into flames. In the blink of an eye, balls of fire rained down from the sky.

The fireballs were the size of a human head and pounded hard against Ming Di’s body.

Ming Di was a large creature. It raised one limb to try and avoid the dense rain of fire but to little success.

As the fireballs pelted him relentlessly, Ming Di cried out as if in great pain.

“Ah, painful, so painful...” Ming Di was crying out but his arm only moved in a half-hearted manner.

The effeminate-looking youth smirked as he watched the “wailing” Ming Di. He didn’t realize how the eight tribe leaders were already staring at him with pity. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

By the side, Ye Qingtang was astounded by the sight of Ming Di, who looked as if he had no intention of retaliating. But observing the smile on the effeminate-looking youth, she suddenly realized what was happening.

Just as Ye Qingtang seemed to have understood something, a layer of frost covered Ming Di’s body. Ye Qingtang had seen this move before. It was the very move that had defeated Ming Wang.

In the blink of an eye, Ming Di’s massive body was encased in a layer of ice. The effeminate-looking youth’s smile deepened as he gazed at the trapped Ming Di.

“So it seems that the steed of the Holy Lord of Shadows is so mediocre.” He patted the layer of ice.

“Mmm? You’ve trapped me in a layer of ice,” Ming Di said.

The effeminate-looking youth lifted his chin. “Don’t worry, I will end your suffering very soon. Don’t blame me after you die. Just blame the Holy Lord for sending you to your death.”

“You want to kill me?” Ming Di asked in an incredulous tone.

“Of course.” A murderous glint flashed across the eyes of the youth. He patted the layer of ice again and icicles suddenly shot out and pierced all over Ming Di.
