Chapter 793 Old Acquaintance (3)

Qin Long’s eyes widened in shock as he looked at the battered Long Jiang. 1

Long Jiang had already advanced to a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord many years ago, and Qin Long assumed that Long Jiang would definitely be able to settle this insensible young man.

But looking at the situation now…

“Long Jiang, what are you doing? I’m giving you a limit of three moves to kill this lowly peasant!” Impatience was written all over the little Emperor’s face as he reproached loudly.

There was a trace of solemnity on Long Jiang’s face. Suddenly, he took a deep breath, and strings of golden rays emerged from the bronze skin on his chest. The golden ray slowly gathered on his body and formed into a vivid and lifelike giant dragon totem.

“Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven?!” Qu Xiangyang stared in disbelief at the golden dragon that gradually formed on Long Jiang’s body.

“Long Jiang! When did you ask Her Lordship to lay the Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven for you?!” Qu Xiangyang exclaimed.

There was not a trace of emotion on Long Jiang’s face. As the golden rays gathered, the gold dragon that was marked on his body floated out.

A thunderous dragon roar suddenly rang.

A giant gold dragon suddenly soared out and panned above Long Jiang’s head.

The giant dragon had an extremely mighty manner as though it was an extraordinary being of nature.

The citizens in the surroundings were shaken to see that giant dragon, and reverence filled their eyes.

The Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven was a technique used by her Lordship, and it made use of the dragon’s aura to seal the enemy’s body. This move could only be used once and was extremely damaging to the user, but its offensive ability was frighteningly strong.

Her Lordship casually mentioned that the Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven could demolish a place utterly with a use, but it would shorten the user’s life.

Qu Xiangyang never thought that Long Jiang had actually asked her Lordship to mark the Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven on him! 1

“Young Sir Ye! Careful!” Qu Xiangyang warned hurriedly.

Ye Qingtang’s eyes were narrowed into slits as she looked at the gold dragon above Long Jiang. She quietly gathered the inner qi in her body and prompted the Paragon Skill in her body.

It was the first time that the little Emperor saw the gold dragon, and he could not help but be pleasantly surprised.

“Quick! Kill him for me!”

Long Jiang took a deep breath. Suddenly, his inner qi broke out of his body and gathered on the gold dragon.

The gold dragon absorbed the endless qi and let out a deafening roar.

In the next second, the gold dragon opened its mouth and charged towards Ye Qingtang!

A fierce wind stirred as the gold dragon dived towards Ye Qingtang mightily with a groan.

A trace of coldness flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes. All of a sudden, a golden flame spread around her, and a fiery phoenix which materialized from flames was born.

Ultimate Origin Skill: Rise of the Phoenix!

With a cry, the fire phoenix with balls of flame directly pounced on the oncoming giant dragon.

In an instant, the gold dragon and fire phoenix crashed. Under the impact, everything in the surroundings was crushed and swept away.

A piercing phoenix cry rang, and the fire phoenix directly used its sharp claws to tear the illusory gold dragon into pieces!

In the gold dragon’s distraction, patches of gold light scattered on the ground.

Long Jiang never expected that his Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven would actually be shredded into pieces by the fire phoenix that Ye Qingtang materialized!

The gold dragon disappeared, and the counter-damage force rushed to Long Jiang’s body, and he spouted a bolt of blood!

The die was cast!

Long Jiang’s eyes were filled with shock. Never would he have thought that the Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven which he requested her Lordship to mark on him would actually be defeated like that…
