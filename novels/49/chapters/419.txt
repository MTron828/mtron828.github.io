She originally thought that it was the righteousness of humans, yet… it was actually because others simply did not know how to seize spirit roots to use for themselves.

However…

How did Ye You know about the Spirit Seizure Technique?

The Blood Moon Sect Elder scoffed.

“Fu Lingtian and that female disciple from Yunxiao Sect clearly know each other. I reckon Fu Lingtian is originally from Yunxiao Sect.

“To use the Spirit Seizure Technique to nourish one’s spirit root, victims whose spirit roots would be snatched away are needed. Yunxiao Sect would not sacrifice their own disciples. Thus, in order to nourish their sect disciples, they would only secretly send their disciples to ordinary sects and let them obtain the spirit roots of ordinary sects’ disciples in secret.

“What bullshit righteous sect! Ultimately, isn’t it the same as my Blood Moon Sect where they will stoop to anything to achieve their goal? So much for Yunxiao Sect declaring that they would suppress my evil sect when they are even more shameless themselves.”

Then, the Blood Moon Sect Elder looked at Ye Qingtang and said, “To make their own disciples more powerful, Yunxiao Sect treated you all disciples of ordinary sects as sacrificial lambs. I’m afraid that the entire Qinglin Sect is kept in the dark and is smug over obtaining Yunxiao Sect’s support. No one knows they were intentionally fattened up by Yunxiao Sect so as to better feed the fat pigs that are Yunxiao Sect disciples.”

Given Yunxiao Sect’s position, they simply did not need to bother with a sect like Qinglin Sect. If there was not a motive, why would Yunxiao Sect support Qinglin Sect?

It seemed that Qinglin Sect was a dowry for others and still was not self-aware.

Ye Qingtang shuddered in terror as she listened. While the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s words were ugly, every word he said was true.

However, what Ye Qingtang was even more worried about was the last sentence that Ye You told Fu Lingtian.

[You don’t need to touch Xuanling Sect’s Zhu Changge. There’s someone who will deal with it.]

Listening to it, her intention was to leave Zhu Changge for someone else. Could it be that… there’s also a disciple in Xuanling Sect who was secretly sent by Yunxiao Sect?

Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed. When she died in her previous life, she was completely unaware of these underhand schemes that Yunxiao Sect had been pulling and naturally did not sense anything in Xuanling Sect. However, after this incident, she had no choice but to be concerned over this matter.

Fu Lingtian clearly already had the skills of Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two, but he deliberately concealed it and only declared that he was at the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level One.

It seems that he, as well, knew how difficult it was for an ordinary sect disciple to advance to the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two.

In such a sect like Qinglin Sect, many inner sect elders were probably at the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two. If Fu Lingtian displayed his true skills, wouldn’t he become the top disciple of Qinglin Sect?

“Why? Are you shocked by the true colors of the so-called righteous sect?” Seeing that Ye Qingtang did not say anything, he darted her a look. “Do you still want to participate in the Three Sect Competition this time? With that Fu Lingtian around, I think you should just drop that idea as soon as possible.”

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes slightly. Suddenly, her lips curled into a smile as she looked right straight at the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

Her smile gave the Blood Moon Sect Elder goosebumps, and he swallowed his saliva uncontrollably. “What is this expression? I was talking about those sects, not you.”

Ye Qingtang chuckled. “I must take part in the competition no matter what.”
