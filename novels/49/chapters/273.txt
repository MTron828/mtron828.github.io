Chapter 272: The Contract (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect sighed, but his eyes showed a trace of cunning.

The contract would only limit him for the time being. When his power was fully recovered, it would be easy to kill a sect disciple within a second.

The contract would not be triggered on time, and he would be free from the contract.

The Elder’s mood was slightly better. He stood up and looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang sensed the cunning look from the Elder. She clearly knew the key of the contract. It was a double-edged sword to have a contract with the Elder of the Blood Moon Sect. Since she dared to sign the contract, she would never give any chance for the Elder to kill her in a second.

She must be more powerful soon.

“My name is Ye Qingtang. You will follow me in the future,” Ye Qingtang said.

The Elder’s mouth shivered, but he eventually accepted the situation. However… he rolled his eyes and said, “You are a sect disciple. It’s not very appropriate for me to follow you with this body right?”

Ye Qingtang sized up his body. If he followed her with this dried-up corpse, they would be killed if they met any orthodox people. She did not need to imagine returning to the sect.

“What’s your thought?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The Elder contemplated for a while, hid the trace of cunning in his eyes, and said, “I will be a burden to you with this body. But… if I can change a body… that will be fine.”

Change a body?

Ye Qingtang frowned but did not say anything. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Elder noticed that she hesitated and immediately added. “There were quite a few sect disciples there just now. The youth is a good choice. I can follow you in the future if I take over his body.”

Ye Qingtang remembered how the Elder wanted to kill the youth of the Wind Moon Sect, and her face clouded instantly.

“No.”

The Elder gritted his teeth. “If he can’t, I can take your Senior Brother’s body as well. It will be more convenient for me to follow you. I think the young man who leads the team is not bad.”

He was referring to Dai Changming.

Ye Qingtang shook her head.

“How about the handsome young man? I think he is suitable as well.” The Elder suggested again.

Ye Qingtang gave him a cold glance. How dare him suggest to take over her Senior Brother Qin’s body.

“Don’t even think about it.”

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect opened his mouth but was speechless. Was he going to follow her with this dried-up body?

Ye Qingtang noticed that as well, but she could never allow him to take those innocent disciples’ bodies. However…

A figure suddenly appeared in her brain. She showed an evil smile and said, “I can provide you with one person. You ask the zombies to bring the strongest man over.”

The Elder of the Blood Moon Sect did not know who Ye Qingtang picked, but he still gave the order to the zombies at the square with mind control.

It was dead silent at the square. Everyone’s face was extremely unpleasant as the blood fog spread around.
