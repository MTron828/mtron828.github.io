Ye Qingtang crossed her arms over her chest, watching the fight in a relaxed manner.

“Make a guess.”

Nangong Lie: “...”

If he could guess, would he have asked?

When Ye Qing suggested for Lei Yan to use the Ice Sealing power as a defense, Nangong Lie had thought she must be mad.

How could a mere layer of ice defend against Qin Feng’s powerful attacks? The ice would probably shatter after just a couple of attacks. How could Lei Yan win?

But Nangong Lie soon realized something was not quite right.

Qin Feng had already launched three attacks and the floor was covered in shattered ice shards. But the layer of ice surrounding Lei Yan appeared just as thick as before.

It was like...

The ice layer was thickening continuously.

At this point, Qin Feng’s aura was in slight disarray.

The ice layer appeared endless.

His bet with Ye Qing was ten moves. As long as Lei Yan could hold on for ten moves, he would lose. If he didn’t attack, he would also end up losing...

Qin Feng suddenly realized that he had walked into a trap set up by Ye Qing.

There was no need for Lei Yan to counterattack at all. As long as he protected himself and held against the attacks, he would win.

As Qin Feng continued to attack, Lei Yan remained unharmed inside the layer of ice. The spectators thought they could witness Lei Yan’s demise but after watching for some time, they realized...

Lei Yan’s tactic was truly disgusting. This was a boring fight with no exchange of moves at all. They were just watching Qin Feng hack away at a block of ice.

The corners of the lips of Lei Yan’s nemeses twitched as they watched. They had never seen Lei Yan so shameless before.

Thinking that they wouldn’t be able to see Lei Yan getting beaten up today, quite a number of people left in disgust.

Qin Feng looked increasingly grave. He had only two moves left and all ten moves would have been used up.

But...

He had yet to even touch the corner of Lei Yan’s shirt.

Qin Feng glanced over the thinned-out crowd and noticed Qin Xuan out of the corner of his eye. He saw very clearly the scorn on Qin Xuan’s face.

A Paragon Eight Heaven level practitioner was being made a fool by a Sixth Heaven level. What a disgrace...

The noisy crowd gradually dispersed. Qin Feng remained standing there, the surrounding temperature decreased by the pile of ice shards on the ground. The ice shards on him had already melted into bone-chilling ice water, slowly freezing his initial fervor.

In the end...

Qin Feng stopped attacking. Observing the layer of ice around Lei Yan, which was still as thick as before, Qin Feng realized...

He had already lost this match.

He would never be able to shatter the ice layer and make contact with Lei Yan in just two more moves.

A darkening aura of depression enveloped Qin Feng. He could not understand what that ice layer was. How was it able to let Lei Yan endure consecutive attacks by someone who was two levels higher than him?

A major sense of failure filled his heart. Qin Feng gave a slightly bitter smile. He then turned to look at Ye Qing.

“I have lost.”

He had no idea how to handle Lei Yan.

“Didn’t you say that you are two levels higher than Lei Yan and can easily defeat him?” Ye Qing looked at Qin Feng, who for the first time displayed his anguish on his face.

“Yes,” Qin Feng replied.

“Power is important but brains are just as important.” Ye Qing glanced at Lei Yan and stepped forward to stand beside the ice-encased teenager.

Qin Feng did not know what Ye Qing was about to do. He only watched with a furrowed brow.
