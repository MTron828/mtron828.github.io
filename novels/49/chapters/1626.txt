Chapter 1627: Mission Countdown (8)

The moment the grim-looking King saw Ye Qingtang, a smile appeared on his face. He naturally stood up and looked at the person who had made the greatest contribution to their Supreme League Kingdom.

“Tang, these few days have been hard on you. When we’ve eliminated the Hughes Kingdom, we need to press on and conquer the next few kingdoms as soon as possible,” the King said with a smile. The subsequent route of attack was already displayed on the sand table in front of him.

As long as Ye Qingtang was around, the Supreme League Kingdom would never be defeated.

At that moment, the King did not look like the same cruel person who had just ordered an entire kingdom to be slaughtered.

“Your Majesty, you ordered the citizens of Hughes Kingdom to be slaughtered?” Ye Qingtang spoke bluntly as she looked at the King, who was prepared to realize his ambitions.

The King was taken aback. From the corner of his eye, he glanced at Joseph, who had entered with Ye Qingtang, and a malicious look flashed across his face.

“Tang, the Hughes Kingdom betrayed us. Have you heard of the saying ‘If you are not one of us, your heart is not with us’?”

Ye Qingtang did not intend to become overly involved in the matters of this world, but...

She definitely would not condone the massacre of an entire kingdom.

Death and injury were inevitable in battle, but she could not accept ordinary citizens being dragged into it.

Ye Qingtang said, “Since Your Majesty’s goal is to unite the entire mainland, everyone in this mainland will become your subject. How can you say they are not one of you?”

Ye Qingtang’s words struck the King.

“If Your Majesty wishes to unite the entire kingdom, then he must treat all the citizens in this mainland as his own subjects. Soon, you will be king over them all.” Ye Qingtang did not urge the Supreme League King to rule compassionately. He had never been a benevolent ruler.

The King’s expression flickered. Ye Qingtang’s words struck a nerve within him.

“Since they are Your Majesty’s subjects, why do you need to slaughter them?” Ye Qingtang asked. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The King was silent for a moment. The corner of his mouth twitched with amusement when he finally grasped what Ye Qingtang meant.

“Tang, you’re right. But if they harbor any traitorous thoughts...”

“You will soon be the only monarch in this mainland. Anyone who submits to you will have a life of ease. Whoever opposes you will die. If they can be assured of an easy life, why would they risk their lives? No commoner hopes for war.” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

The fight for power was always a game played by the leaders. To the commoners, it made no difference who governed them. As long as the leader allowed them to have a life of ease, they would love him.

The King sank into deep thought. He had ruled with an iron fist. Even if he conquered a country, he would eliminate all the subjects in the kingdom at the first opportunity, both to prevent the people from rebelling and to ensure his absolute sovereignty.

But Ye Qingtang’s words had shaken the King’s thinking.

If someone else had said it, he would have scoffed at the idea. But when Ye Qingtang said it, it was a completely different matter.

“Tang, perhaps you are right. I can try it.” The King nodded. He was happy to listen to Ye Qingtang’s opinions.

Everyone breathed more freely when they saw that the King had relented.

Right now, the King probably listened only to the Lord Protector.
