“F*ck you… Put me down…” The little white tiger struggled in Ye Qingtang’s arms.

However, there was no use in struggling as Ye Qingtang did not have any intention to let go.

“Of course, you will lead us there.” Ye Qingtang chuckled at the little white tiger in her arms.

“No, no, no. I’m not going… F*ck you, I’m not going…” The little white tiger panicked.

“F*ck you, f*ck you. Do you only know this one line? Can’t you change to something original?” The Blood Moon Elder, who followed behind Ye Qingtang, could not stop himself from asking.

“F*ck your father. F*ck your grandfather…” The little white tiger swore while struggling

“…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder stared blankly at the little white tiger.

“You must lead the way for us. Moreover, I will not leave you outside alone,” Ye Qingtang said.

“I’m already at the infant-form. It’s only a burden if you bring me along… If it was before, I would not fear the Evil Spirits Realm, but now…” The little white tiger was extremely unwilling to head there with Ye Qingtang.

“It’s fine. I don’t despise you.” Ye Qingtang smiled.

After struggling for a long time to no avail, it could only choose to relent. If it had to blame anyone, it could only blame its mouth. If it did not say anything about the land of inheritance, all these matters would not have been stirred up.

But the words were spoken, and there was no medicine for regret in this world.

“Eh… what is this…” In the process of struggling, the little white tiger accidentally crawled into Ye Qingtang’s arms and grabbed the little lightning dragon’s tail.

Before Ye Qingtang could stop it, the little white tiger, urged by its curiosity, pulled the little lightning dragon out at once.

At that instant, the little lightning dragon and the little white tiger stared at each other. The little lightning dragon was a little fearful after sensing the aura of a Fiendcelestial Beast, but when it saw the little white tiger near it, its eyes were full of curiosity.

“This is also my spirit pet,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Pfft.” The little white tiger had a proud expression as it looked at Ye Qingtang. “It’s only a little lightning dragon. Also… I am not your spirit pet. We signed an equality contract, not a master and servant contract. Both of us are equal.”

Then, the little white tiger no longer bothered with Ye Qingtang and poked the little lightning dragon non-stop with its two claws.

As it dragged on, the little lightning dragon seemed to be a little impatient and slapped its tail on the little white tiger’s face.

“F*ck you. How dare you hit me!” The little white tiger was in disbelief.

Even an adult king-level demonic beast had to avoid crossing paths with it, but this little lightning dragon actually dared to slap it with its tail!

“Don’t bully the little lightning dragon.” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

“F*ck you!” The little white tiger swore angrily. “It clearly is the one who slapped me with its tail. Are you blind!”

“If you did not provoke it, would it slap you with its tail?” Ye Qingtang replied.

“Hmph!” The little white tiger scoffed coldly. “You already have me. What do you still need it for? You might as well let me eat it to increase my skills and let me grow faster!”

After hearing that the Fiendcelestial Beast wanted to eat it, the little lightning dragon seemed to be a little furious and slapped its tail on the little white tiger’s face once again.

“Ow! F*ck you, I’m going to fight it out with you!” The little white tiger flew into a rage. Before it could take any action, the little lightning dragon crawled into Ye Qingtang’s arms and disappeared from sight.

Ye Qingtang was rather helpless to see the little white tiger behaving this way. She carried it with a hand to stop it.

“I want to beat it until it dies!” The little white tiger lifted its head up and looked at Ye Qingtang.

“Settle down. The current you cannot defeat it either.” Ye Qingtang immediately poured cold water on the little white tiger.
