The Blood Moon Sect Elder was not in a hurry to reply. He tapped his chin with a frown as he repeatedly scanned Fu Lingtian’s body with sharp eyes, seeming to be searching for something.

A moment later, shock filled the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eyes, and he immediately spoke softly. “Why does this fellow have the aura of my Blood Moon Sect?”

“Aura of the Blood Moon Sect? What do you mean by that?” Ye Qingtang asked.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder scanned the surroundings. After ensuring that other disciples were a distance away from them and would not be able to hear him, he replied in a hushed voice. “The cultivation technique of the Blood Moon Sect has a distinctive color of its own that other powers would not be able to imitate. Anyone who cultivated my sect’s cultivation technique would faintly exude an aura of the evil spirit. Others may not be able to see this evil aura, and only we Blood Moon Sect people would be able to tell. I see that this Fu Lingtian is faintly exuding a bit of the air of an evil spirit. Why wouldn’t it be strange?”

The Blood Moon Sect Elder thought it was weird. Qinglin Sect was a righteous sect, and the cultivation techniques were mostly based on the vital energy. It was utterly impossible for a disciple to possess an aura of the evil spirit, which was produced from evil cultivation techniques.

There was doubt in Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She had never cultivated the Blood Moon Sect’s evil cultivation techniques and naturally could not see the so-called aura of the evil spirit. However, wasn’t it up to what the Blood Moon Sect Elder said as to whether this thing really existed?

“What is this expression that you’re looking at me with? I did not lie to you. I just find it odd myself.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder huffed, displeased to be stared by Ye Qingtang in suspicion.

“You have such a notorious record. Who can you blame?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was speechless by her words but truly felt that he was maligned this time.

“Darn girl, I’m really not lying to you this time. Who knows? Maybe this supposed Fu Lingtian was also seized by a resurrected member of my sect. If you don’t believe me, I can just find a chance to test him later, and we will know,” the Blood Moon Sect Elder uttered seriously. The Blood Moon Sect had been annihilated for a long time, and their cultivation techniques were long lost along with the annihilation of the sect. Not mentioning the disciples of righteous sects, even other forces would absolutely not be able to understand the cultivation techniques of their sect.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder had a greedy thought. If Fu Lingtian was really seized by a member of the Blood Moon Sect, he would have found a partner. Moreover, he heard that Fu Lingtian’s skills were powerful, and should they really be from the Blood Moon Sect, he could use Fu Lingtian to get rid of Ye Qingtang.

However, the Blood Moon Sect Elder did not dare to let Ye Qingtang see through this thought of his.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder doubtfully and sensed that there was something fishy about what this old fellow was thinking of. However, she did not say anything and kept this curiosity inside her.

If Fu Lingtian was related to the Blood Moon Sect, then the Three Sect Competition this time would probably not be as simple as expected. After all, the Blood Moon Sect had many cultivation techniques using one’s internal strength. While Ye Qingtang had the confidence to make herself conspicuous in this competition based on her skills, she would have to be more careful if the opponent was a person seized by a member of the Blood Moon Sect.

“You better be obedient this time or else…” Ye Qingtang chuckled as she casually clenched her knuckles, which set off a cracking sound.

The back of the Blood Moon Sect Elder turned cold, though he had a sincere expression on his face. “Don’t worry. I will definitely be obedient this time.”

After hearing what the Blood Moon Sect Elder said, she did not say anything else and decided to find a chance to spy on Fu Lingtian before the competition.
