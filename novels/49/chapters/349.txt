Regardless of its color or smell, this pill was actually exactly the same as the one that his Sect Master obtained that time!

The disbelief that he had initially faded away immediately. He looked up at Ye Qingtang questioningly and then back at the pill. Hesitation filled his eyes.

The Source of the Marrow Pill had disappeared for a long time, and the last pill was obtained by the Blood Moon Sect’s Sect Master. However, it had been thousands of years from then. How was Ye Qingtang able to know the true appearance of the Source of the Marrow Pill?

The more the Blood Moon Sect Elder pondered, the more he found it strange.

The pill was already in his palm, and whether to consume it or not was a question.

After thinking over and over again, he ultimately decided to give it a try.

After all, there was a blood pact between him and Ye Qingtang. If Ye Qingtang wanted to poison him, she would not benefit at all.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder narrowed his eyes and made a decision. If this pill was real, then when he regained his powers, he would definitely make Ye Qingtang pay all the humiliation he suffered back!

Instantly, the Blood Moon Sect Elder placed the Source of the Marrow pill in his mouth.

The moment it was in his mouth, the blood smell spread throughout his mouth and into his throat as he swallowed. A warm sensation could be felt in his abdomen area subsequently.

In just a moment, the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eyes brightened.

He could clearly feel that the deficiency in his spirit was slowly repairing, and the effect was much faster than absorbing the essence of sect disciples!

As his spirit was slowly recovered, the Blood Moon Sect Elder was increasingly delighted.

Just as he was absorbed in the elation of recovering his powers, the effect of the Source of the Marrow Pill suddenly frittered away, and the feeling of resurrection disappeared as well.

“…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder sat there at a loss, though the fascination never left his eyes.

“How is it? I didn’t lie to you, did I?” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s behavior smilingly. She was still confident in her alchemy skills. After all, most of the pills and elixirs she used in her previous life were personally refined by her.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s expression became complicated. He could clearly feel that his powers recovered slightly, but… it was far from when he was at his peak.

“You really refined this Source of the Marrow Pill yourself?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder felt the effects of the pill and fully believed that it was indeed the Source of the Marrow Pill.

However, he was completely unable to comprehend why Ye Qingtang, a girl only a little over ten years old, would actually know the formula for the Source of the Marrow Pill, which had disappeared for many years.

“Of course.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“…” The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s expression turned even more complicated.

Although his powers did recover, it was not complete, and he could not kill Ye Qingtang instantly. If their strife set off the blood pact, he would die without a doubt.

Furthermore…

If Ye Qingtang really did refine the Source of the Marrow Pill, wouldn’t he lose the chance of recovering rapidly in the future if he killed her now?

“It is not just the Source of the Marrow Pill. I can also refine the Bonded Soul Pill,” Ye Qingtang suddenly said.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eyes almost popped out.

Bonded Soul Pill!!

That was the divine Bonded Soul Pill that could allow him to directly recover to his peak!!

“You… really can refine it?” Excitement emerged in the Blood Moon Sect Elder’s eyes.

Ye Qingtang nodded calmly.

Without saying, the formula for the Bonded Soul Pill was also obtained from that tomb.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder was agitated.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎
