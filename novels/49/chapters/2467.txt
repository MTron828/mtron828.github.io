Earlier on, Ye Qingtang thought that since she had contacts in the Eastern Demon Faction, perhaps she could find them to help resolve this crisis.

But on second thought, Ye Qingtang eventually gave up that idea.

Firstly, the Eastern Faction could not even protect themselves. Secondly, there were so many of them that it made it hard to explain.

Moreover, the Eastern Faction would not go against another demon tribe for her sake.

“Which tribe did that demon say it was from?” Ye Qingtang asked everyone after a while.

“If I remember correctly, it should be the West Sea Tribe,” said the Flying Star Academy teacher.

Lu Yuanxiang nodded. “Yes, the West Sea Tribe.”

“The West Sea Tribe?” Ye Qingtang pondered.

Back in the Eastern Faction, Ye Qingtang had a rough understanding of the demon camps in this realm. The West Sea Tribe did not live in the sea, but just near it. Its power was similar to the Eastern Faction.

The West Sea Tribe had a sworn enemy, the Yongle Tribe.

According to Ye Qingtang’s understanding, the Yongle Tribe was relatively peaceful and rarely provoked trouble. Moreover, all the demons in the Yongle Tribe had the same belief.

Reverence towards Demon Emperor Yongle.

It was rumored that Demon Emperor Yongle used to be the overlord of this realm, but had suddenly vanished without a trace. The demons of the Yongle tribe believed that Demon Emperor Yongle had ascended to the heavens thousands of years ago and become a true demon god.

The demons of the Yongle Tribe had been waiting, earnestly waiting for the return of the Demon Emperor Yongle to lead the Yongle Tribe into heaven.

In the vicinity of the Yongle tribe, there was even a demon ancestral temple that was enshrined with the statues of the Demon Emperor Yongle and a group of demons following him.

Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. If they could receive the protection of the Yongle Tribe…

Firstly, the Yongle Tribe and the West Sea Tribe had a deep hatred for each other. Secondly, the Yongle Tribe was the only demon tribe with some sort of religion. And it was their faith that would allow them to take advantage of it.

Ye Qingtang immediately told Lu Yuanxiang, the Flying Star Academy teacher and the rest about her plan.

“Teacher Ye Qing… so you want us to pretend to be the Demon Emperor Yongle?” Lu Yuanxiang looked at Ye Qingtang with a strange expression.

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lu Yuanxiang’s lips twitched. How would they be able to impersonate a Demon Emperor?

“With our martial art techniques and divine powers… and elixirs,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Teacher Ye Qing, what you mean is that the demons here don’t know about the existence of martial arts techniques and divine abilities… however, I saw the battle between the demons previously. Some demons wear human skin and should have seen humans and fought humans before. It’s impossible that they have not seen any martial arts and divine powers,” Lu Yuanxiang said in deep thought.

“I’ve been to this realm before. Other than demons, there are indeed humans here. However, the humans here are different from us. They do not have martial art skills or divine abilities. The humans here are mere prey for the demons,” Ye Qingtang explained.

“Then… even if that’s the case, how can we make the demons of the Yongle Tribe believe us with our martial arts techniques?” Lu Yuanxiang was still unable to understand.

Ye Qingtang smiled. “I know how to refine True Dreams.”

The so-called “True Dreams” was a type of hallucinogenic powder. When consumed, one would hallucinate for a short period of time.. And the hallucination would be something that the person had always dreamed of.
