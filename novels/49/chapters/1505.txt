Chapter 1506 Protector 3

Ye Qingtang secretly heaved a sigh of relief as she saw the crowd slowly disperse. At that moment, Jiang Xun returned to her side, looking worried.

“Tang Tang, what happened just now? How did you find something so deadly?” Jiang Xun’s expression was filled with distress. Of course, it was good to have found a Dharma treasure in the main hall, but Ye Qingtang was just too weak. Even if she found some treasure, she would be unable to retain it for her own use, and it would bring disaster on her instead.

Although Ye Qingtang had obtained the Celestial Fairy’s protection just now, she had... offended all the other groups. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The Celestial Fairy could not possibly protect her all the time. When they had obtained enough treasures, the people from the Purple Palace would leave. Then, even if Ye Qingtang remained hidden in the palace, the Celestial Fairy would certainly not bother with her.

Ye Qingtang laughed wryly.

How could she have known that the box would contain something so conspicuous?

Jiang Xun frowned slightly, then pulled Ye Qingtang into a corner.

“Tang Tang, you cannot remain in this palace. They haven’t acted yet. I will seize the opportunity to get out of here.”

Once the people from the Purple Palace left, those who hated Ye Qingtang would probably attack her. Jiang Shangyu and the others wanted Ye Qingtang dead as soon as possible, so they certainly would not protect her either.

Why not sneak away when everyone was busy looking for treasure?

Jiang Xun’s injuries had improved greatly after she rested. She could not bear to leave Ye Qingtang alone in the Land of Infinite, so she thought of a way to get Ye Qingtang out of there.

Ye Qingtang naturally grasped the merits of her plan.

With that, Jiang Xun looked around. When she saw that no one was paying attention to them, she and Ye Qingtang fled from the palace through the main door.

But their movements were detected by Ye You, who had been watching Ye Qingtang’s every move from a secret spot.

Ye You immediately sought out Jiang Qin and Jiang Shangyu, and told them about Ye Qingtang’s escape.

“That Ye Qingtang is truly a traitorous creature. She is a member of the Jiang Family, but when she obtained such a wonderful Dharma treasure, she did not hand it over to Fifth Grand Uncle. She has no thought for the prestige of the Jiang Family.” Jiang Qin laughed coldly and glanced at Jiang Shangyu.

Jiang Shangyu looked very displeased. He narrowed his eyes and glanced at Jiang Qin and Jiang Shun, who were standing next to him. He secretly nodded to them.

Jiang Qin and Jiang Shun instantly grasped Jiang Shangyu’s meaning.

They summoned some Jiang Family members and left the palace in pursuit.

Not long after Jiang Xun left the palace with Ye Qingtang in tow, she sensed someone approaching from behind. Jiang Xun looked back to see Jiang Qin, Jiang Shun, and the others rapidly nearing.

Jiang Xun frowned, but when she realized that they were Jiang Family members, she slowed down a little.

“Aunt, Fifth Grand Uncle wants you to return immediately. The various forces are still fighting for the Dharma treasures. If you leave now, the Jiang Family will find treasure at a slower rate than the others.” Jiang Qin looked at Jiang Xun accusingly.

“There are so many of you, aren’t there enough?” Jiang Xun asked casually.

“How can there be enough? Aunt, if you don’t want to make Fifth Grand Uncle unhappy, you had better hurry back with us now.” Jiang Qin tried to persuade her.

Jiang Xun frowned slightly. She felt that something was amiss, but before she could gather her wits, Jiang Shun, who had been silently standing there, seized the opportunity. He suddenly attacked Ye Qingtang, who was behind Jiang Xun!

Jiang Xun snapped out of her trance and hurriedly blocked Jiang Shun’s ambush. “Jiang Shun, what are you doing?!”
