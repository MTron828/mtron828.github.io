The incharge forced a smile. “She only forged one finished weapon today, but the skills she displayed are no worse than mine. I wonder who her master is. Perhaps, only a Grand Master is able to teach such a genius.”

The elderly’s eyes deepened at the words.

“Everyone thinks that the level of one’s martial skills will enable them to attain a different status. However, regardless of forging or refining pills, one would not have any other concerns if they reached the level of a Grand Master, as powerful figures would offer their services to obtain the items they produced. I wonder how Ye Qingtang’s cultivation is currently. If there’s nothing outstanding, she could focus on forging armaments. With her talent, it is not impossible to reach the level of a Grand Master,” the incharge mumbled.

In this world, it was extremely rare for people to reach the state of a Grand Master, and only a few were successful in the past thousand years.

And those few people had average cultivations, but any random divine weapons they produced could attract a group of people offering their services. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

No matter how powerful the mighty figures were, they would still seek an exceedingly strong weapon, and thus, Grand Masters were people who they had to treat politely the most.

“It seems that I need to make a trip to the inner sect’s Elders’ Hall.” The elderly rubbed his beard as he thought.

If Ye Qingtang really had the ability to become a Grand Master of forging, she would no longer be as simple as an ordinary disciple to Xuanling Sect. If Xuanling Sect could raise a Grand Master, it would of an exceptional significance.

At that thought, the elderly did not stay any longer in the Sword Spirit Workshop and left immediately.

…

Ye Qingtang, who exited the Sword Spirit Workshop, did not realize how lucky she was today as she joyously hugged her Demonic Blood Sword and dagger all the way back to her residence.

In the yard, Fei Ying was cleaning up the fallen leaves and immediately greeted Ye Qingtang when he saw her.

“Are you in a very good mood today, Miss?” Fei Ying blinked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang chuckled and nodded. Suddenly recalling something, she opened her space ring and took some items out.

“Tell Ni Shang to come here.”

Fei Ying nodded and immediately called for Ni Shang.

When Ye Qingtang saw the two young teens standing before her, she finally placed the items that she just took out into their hands.

“No matter what your identities are currently, according to your talents, you will not remain here forever as long as you cultivate diligently from now on.” Ye Qingtang handed Fei Ying and Ni Shang two basic cultivation techniques which, although were not considered rare, were the most suitable for their age.

Only by laying a strong foundation from young would there be better effects in one’s cultivation in the future.

Apart from cultivation techniques, Ye Qingtang also handed them a few bottles of Xi Spirit Pills.

These were all exchanged when she was in the outer sect. Now that she had the Soul Condensation Pills after entering the inner sect, the Xi Spirit Pills were naturally no longer suitable for her.

Disbelief filled the eyes of the two kids as they looked at the pile of items in their hands.

The identity of a sword boy or attendant girl was equivalent to that of servants in the inner sect. To guard against their sword boy and attendant girl from developing, many disciples never allowed them to have too much contact with things related to martial skills, much less take the initiative to give them cultivation techniques and elixirs.

“Miss… we cannot accept… these items…” Ni Shang frantically shook her head and returned the items to Ye Qingtang.

Fei Ying, similarly, was overwhelmed by this unexpected favor and was a little frightened.
