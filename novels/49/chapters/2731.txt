Chapter 2732: The Second Tian (3)

Evil Deity stared at Ye Qingtang in astonishment.

“Grandpa, that is one way to look at it,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Are you really… really Jiuyuan’s daughter?!” Evil Deity’s body trembled slightly.

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

The Dragon Emperor Clan no longer had any doubts about Ye Qingtang. With Ye Qingtang’s skills, it would be easy for her to destroy the Dragon Emperor Clan. Why would she need to pretend to be Di Jiuyuan’s daughter?

Besides, that jade pendant was indeed real.

“You, what’s your name?” Evil Deity stared at Ye Qingtang.

“My name is Ye Qingtang…” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Alright… alright, alright. Where are your parents now? Are they still alive?” An excited look appeared in Evil Deity’s eyes.

“This…”

Ye Qingtang told Evil Deity her entire story.

“You were sent to the First Domain by your mother from the moment you were born… and you have never seen your parents?” Evil Deity’s expression changed slightly.

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded slightly.

Ye Qingtang stared at the old man in front of her. This was the ruler of the Dragon Emperor Clan and also her grandfather.

In her conversation with Evil Deity, Ye Qingtang also learned that the Dragon Emperor Clan had been searching for Di Jiuyuan all along but did not have any news.

“You… are Aunt Jiuyuan’s daughter. No wonder… you look so alike…”

A woman stepped forward and stared at Ye Qingtang in bewilderment.

Ye Qingtang was no stranger to this woman.

She had seen Long Yao in the mystic realm and helped her deceive the people of the Ten Thousand Poisons Valley.

“I should have realized this back then in that mystic realm…” Long Xiao stared at Ye Qingtang with excitement in her eyes.

However, Ye Qingtang’s skills in the mystic realm back then were not very good. Now, she was like a completely different person… she could easily destroy the Sky Vault Sect with a wave of her hand.

“It has been a long time since we last met.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Long Yao and Long Xiao and chuckled.

“Cousin Qingtang…” Long Yao stared at Ye Qingtang with a red face.

Ye Qingtang nodded.

“Qingtang, come… come to Grandpa,” the Evil Deity said to Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang immediately walked towards the old man.

Evil Deity’s eyes were filled with love and complicated emotions as he looked at Ye Qingtang. At that moment, he was certain that this girl was indeed his granddaughter. She looked very much like Di Jiuyuan…

However, he still had some doubts in his heart. Why did she also look identical to the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon…

“Qingtang, you must have suffered a lot all these years.” After a long time, the old man stared at Ye Qingtang and sighed.

After chatting with Ye Qingtang for a while, Evil Deity asked in confusion, “Qingtang, Grandpa is actually still a little puzzled. Although you look like your mother, you are also identical to the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon.”

Ye Qingtang did not hide anything from him. “Grandpa, I am the reincarnation of that Paragon.”

The expressions of the people from the Dragon Emperor Clan changed.

After hearing Ye Qingtang’s explanation, Evil Deity said in disbelief, “You’re saying that… the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon reincarnated as a human and became Di Jiuyuan’s daughter?”

After careful consideration, there was indeed no conflicting information here, but he had never thought about it that way.

“Grandpa, is that important…? In this lifetime, I am simply your granddaughter and Di Jiuyuan’s daughter. Nothing has changed,” Ye Qingtang reminded him gently.
