Chapter 2383: Making A Choice (2)

“Ye Qing, do you have any thoughts about this?” Wen Qi looked towards Ye Qing. He and Wu Fengling planned to groom Ye Qing to become an important teacher in the Netherworld Academy in the future.

Ye Qingtang pondered for some time before replying.

“Since there is a certain disparity between their powers, there is no need to waste any time worrying about that. Instead, I believe that we have a chance in the team competition.”

All the teachers were stunned.

Even Wen Qi looked surprised at Ye Qingtang’s words.

“Team competition? Teacher Ye… I am afraid we have no advantage in the team competition either. The individual powers of our martial arts students cannot compare to the other academies. Compounding the disparity by 10 times, the gap would only become wider.” One of the teachers felt that Ye Qing was over-simplifying things. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“If the team competition was just a series of sparring matches, the gap would definitely become wider. But this year’s team competition is different.” Ye Qingtang explained.

“For this year’s team competition, we need to kill the most number of demons within a period of time. We are not fighting against the other teams.”

Despite the reasoning, the other teachers still believed that Ye Qing was being too naive.

“Even if we are competing on the number of demons killed, the moment we enter the Wailing Well, the various teams will definitely resort to all sorts of nefarious methods in order to win. By then, it will not just be a simple matter of killing demons. The other academies will try their best to eliminate the competition while killing the demons… don’t forget that there are no rules stating that teams cannot fight each other.” One of the teachers raised this point.

With the current power level of the Netherworld Academy students, they would definitely lose if they had to fight the top teams of the other academies.

“I feel that it is still better to let Qin Feng and Ran Mo have a go. As long as one of them is able to enter the top 10, we should be okay,” another teacher suggested. He was really not that optimistic about the team competition.

Even in the past, the team competition had always been Netherworld Academy’s weakest segment. After all, the Netherworld Academy had never won a single team competition before.

“The chances of Ran Mo and Qin Feng winning are close to zero,” Ye Qingtang said suddenly.

The faces of the teachers instantly darkened. Although Ye Qing was speaking the truth, wasn’t it still too direct of him to say that?

Ignoring those disapproving eyes, Ye Qingtang looked towards Wen Qi. “If we make Qin Feng and Ran Mo compete in the martial arts sparring matches, not only are their chances near-zero, the team competition would follow right after. By then, they would be drained after their sparring matches and not be as effective in the team competition.”

Ye Qingtang had her own plans. She had never been one to walk the usual pathways.

In her previous life, she had experienced all sorts of dangerous situations and she also knew that the Netherworld Academy teachers wanted to play it safe. But now that things had come to this, she could not allow them to insist on their conservative ways.

“Instead of placing our hopes on something which we already know that we have little chance of winning, why don’t we take a risk on the team competition,” Ye Qingtang persuaded.

The Wailing Well was an unfamiliar place to all the academies, so everyone would be starting from the same point. In addition, Ye Qingtang would be personally leading the team. They might have a chance there.

Wen Qi was deep in thought.

“Teacher Ye is asking us to actively give up on all the other segments apart from the team competition?”
