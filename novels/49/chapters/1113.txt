Chapter 1114 A Single Spark Can Start A Prairie Fire (4)

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched slightly as she looked at the voice transmission stage in her hands.

Stay by my side? How?

By relying on the voice transmission stone?

However… considering Ling Yan’s skills, Ye Qingtang instantly felt that… it was better for him to use the voice transmission stone and move his mouth…

“Qingtang, I think this is unsuitable!” Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang with a deep frown and said. “We don’t know how many troops of the You Ancient Clan came from Central Mainland, but it could capture the entire northern mainland in just two days. It is evident how scary its force is. Qingtang, the odds will be against your favor if you go there alone!”

“Eldest Young Lady, Perfected Xuanchen is right. You should think twice!” Elder Bai Kui and Daoist Zijin persuaded her otherwise hurriedly.

However, Ye Qingtang had already made up her mind. Since Ling Yan wanted her to head over, he must have his own ideas.

Seeing that their persuasion fell on deaf ears, everyone stopped talking.

Bai Kui, Daoist Zijin, and a few others initially wanted to follow Ye Qingtang, but Ye Qingtang rejected them. She might not attack this trip and perhaps was only there as a scout to observe the situation. Having many people would be a hindrance instead, and if they really encountered danger, Ye Qingtang might not be able to save the rest.

Ye Qingtang returned to her room swiftly and was prepared to leave after packing her things.

Ye Qingtang just left Falling Sky Valley, and the little white tiger was beside Ye Qingtang since god knows when.

The current little white tiger was larger than before, and its fur was even more obvious. An inexplicable aura could be vaguely sensed.

“You’re awake?”

Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger and chuckled.

“F*ck you… What a nap…” The little white tiger yawned and said. “Every growing stage, we Fiendcelestial Beasts will fall into a deep sleep… It’s similar to hibernation of normal demonic beasts, but after I wake up, my combat power will increase by a fair amount.”

Ye Qingtang sized up the little white tiger and nodded.

The current little white tiger was greatly different from before. If Ye Qingtang fought with her life on the line, she might not win against the little white tiger even before it was enlarged.

“You woke up at the right time. Follow me.” Ye Qingtang grabbed the little white tiger and placed it in her arms.

Although the little white tiger was bigger, there was not much change in its frame.

“Where are we going… I haven’t eaten…”

The little white tiger looked at Ye Qingtang in confusion as he was completely unaware of the recent happenings.

Ye Qingtang could not be bothered to explain to the little white tiger and walked ahead with great strides.

“Holy Lady!”

A few steps later, a sweet and delicate voice rang behind Ye Qingtang. Ye Qingtang turned around instinctively only to see Ouyang Qian walking towards them.

This person was indeed Ouyang Qian, but the spirit in the body was the Blood Moon Elder.

Initially, Ye Qingtang let the Blood Moon Elder stay in the Ouyang Family and did not bother with him as she had too many things to settle. Ye Qingtang originally thought that Blood Moon Elder had already returned to Blood Moon Sect, yet it turned out that he was still in the Ouyang Family.

Looking at Blood Moon Elder’s glowing skin, it was easy to tell that he was nourished very well in the Ouyang Family and was probably so indulged in the pleasure that he forgot to return to Blood Moon Sect. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Holy Lady, I’m here!”

Blood Moon Elder rushed to Ye Qingtang’s side hurriedly with a face full of smiles.

“Stay in Falling Sky Valley first and wait for me to return.” Ye Qingtang looked at Blood Moon Elder and said.
