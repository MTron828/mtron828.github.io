The smile on Lu Xiuwen’s face could not help but fall a little.

Wanting to sense whether Ye Qingtang played any tricks, he narrowed his eyes, but he did not feel that there were any special moves after thinking over and over again.

Two out of three moves were over. Only one move was left, and then Ye Qingtang would win.

This time, Zhou Qu did not dare to be careless as well.

God knows why this annoying girl was so cursed. She obviously looked very weak, how could he not manage to hit her?

Zhou Qu took a deep breath, refusing to believe in superstitions, and the eyes which he looked at Ye Qingtang with became increasingly stern.

A seeming smile was still hung on Ye Qingtang’s face.

“There’s still one move left. Go ahead, Senior Brother Zhou,” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

Zhou Qu scoffed. He suddenly walked forward and directed his energy, directly hitting Ye Qingtang without giving her any reaction time.

A stern look flashed across her smiling eyes. At the moment when Zhou Qu dashed towards her, her hind foot back-stepped a little, and she flipped her wrist. When Zhou Qu’s punch was about to land, her hands suddenly held onto his fists, and using the impact of his punch, she threw him out directly.

To others, all of this seemed like Zhou Qu slipped and was flung forward because his force was too violent.

Zhou Qu put all his force into this punch, and if the punch had landed on Ye Qingtang, her bones would definitely be crushed.

However, as Ye Qingtang flipped her wrist and dissolved the force, she directly transferred the energy onto Zhou Qu and sent him flying away.

A large bang was heard.

Zhou Qu was thrown onto the side of the arena with a heavy thud. The pain made his face pale and contorted in agony.

The surrounding disciples were all dumbfounded. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

To them, the battle between Zhou Qu and Ye Qingtang simply looked like a joke.

Ye Qingtang wanted to block Zhou Qu’s attack, but unexpectedly, Zhou Qu did not stand stable himself and actually flew out…

What…

The hell is this!

Those new disciples that lost to Zhou Qu previously almost spat a mouthful of blood.

Why did Zhou Qu not make so many mistakes when sparring with them? Why was there a series of problems when it became Ye Qingtang?

Even if you thought that the little girl was good-looking, you should not be so obvious when going easy on her!

Those who still hoped for Ye Qingtang to end up worse than them were all disappointed.

Zhou Qu stood up unsteadily and held onto his painful chest as a buzzing sound rang in his head.

“Senior Brother Zhou, you’re too kind. I’ll accept these four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills.” Ye Qingtang beamed at the rather shabby-looking Zhou Qu. Before Zhou Qu managed to say something, she went straight to take the four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills that Zhou Qu had placed into her hands and kept it as though it was the logical thing to do.

Zhou Qu watched with his own eyes as the four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills that he won previously was kept by Ye Qingtang. Instantly, his face turned extremely ugly, and he was so depressed he almost threw up blood.

He had not managed to react to what happened previously. He only felt that after Ye Qingtang’s touch, there seemed to be a force deviating the original track of his fist and he ended up throwing himself out.

No one had expected that Ye Qingtang could actually receive Zhou Qu’s three moves.

Accurately speaking, Ye Qingtang did not even put in any effort; it was Zhou Qu who made successive mistakes which looked like he was intentionally going easy on her.

No one knew that Zhou Qu was the one who was pissed to death.
