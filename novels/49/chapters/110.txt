Chapter 111: Sword Array (3)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Ye Qingtang, are you ready to enter the sword array?” The middle-aged man did not limit his words this time.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. She held her sword and walked towards the Eight Trigrams stage in silence.

The four elders stared at Ye Qingtang in the sect. Their expressions were delicate.

The elders of the Fist Faction and Herbal Faction did not have many feelings for the young lady, who had an excellent performance in the illusion array. Elder Qin of the Array Faction had some interest in Ye Qingtang.

“Elder Qin, what do you think about her results this time?” Elder Lin suddenly asked.

Elder Qin took a glimpse at Elder Lin and said, “The sword array is set by your Sword Faction. You should be clearer than me.”

Elder Lin sneered and then looked towards the mirror.

“The sword array tests the fighting skills of a candidate. I have never seen anyone with a red spirit root step onto the Eight Trigrams stage. I can’t predict her performance this time.” Though Elder Lin did not make it obvious, everyone could sense his sarcasm.

Elder Qin frowned. He did not like the tone that Elder Lin used, but he had to admit that what he said was true.

The sword array was different from the illusion array. A person without some practical fighting skills could not last long even if they mastered array formations.

Ye Qingtang’s spirit root…

Elder Qin sighed.

Ye Qingtang stood still on the Eight Trigrams stage.

The middle-aged man turned on the sword array as he saw Ye Qingtang was prepared.

The sword in the stone was surrounded by light the next second. It vibrated slightly, and lightsabers were split out of the stone.

When Ye Qingtang took a deep breath and was ready to fight the lightsabers, the light on the sword in the stone suddenly changed.

The white light was replaced by a blood-red color. A loud and piercing sound was made by the sword in the stone the next moment. It vibrated violently, and countless light shadows were seen.

The middle-aged man’s face turned as he witnessed the changes of the sword in the stone.

What happened?

Why was there a sudden change to the sword in the stone?!

An ominous feeling crept within him.

Only white light should be radiated when the sword array was turned on. How could the light suddenly turn red?!

The middle-aged man sensed something was not right. He then wanted to turn off the sword array temporarily, but his hand was rebounded off by a strong force from the button!

The piercing sound cut through the sky again. Within a second, the sword in the stone that was surrounded by the right light suddenly released innumerable red lightsabers!

The blood red lightsabers flew into the sky like red rain, covering the whole sky.

The entire Eight Trigrams stage was red due to the reflection of the light.

Ye Qingtang felt slightly uneasy as she stared at the bright light above her head in surprise.

She went through the sword array in her previous life’s assessment. However, she was cut by the lightsabers at the beginning of the second round in her previous life.

Ye Qingtang spent a long time in the Xuanling Sect in her previous life, but she had never heard that the sword in the stone would radiate red light.

She could not even imagine the first round of the sword array would have more than a hundred of lightsabers!

Even Ye Qingtang, who was reborn, was also shocked by the variation of the sword array.

However…

Before she could figure out what exactly happened, the hundreds of lightsabers above her head dashed towards the Eight Trigrams stage suddenly like raindrops.Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m
