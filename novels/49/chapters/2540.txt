Chapter 2541: Dragon Emperor Clan (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

If that peak Emperor level practitioner who had tried to break through to the Immortal Emperor stage was really here, they might not be able to defeat him even if they joined forces. No matter how serious his injuries were, the difference in their levels was just too great. It would definitely be a vicious battle.

“Ha, Elder, in that case, I’m afraid we’ve made a wasted trip.” It was only some time later that the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince remarked to the white-haired elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan.

“Since that’s the case, you should leave soon.” The white-haired elder spoke calmly.

The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince did not take exception to the attitude of the Dragon Emperor Clan elder. The Dragon Emperor Clan was considered an extremely old clan in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain. Coupled with the fact that they were also an evil cult, they had always behaved in this manner.

“Alright, I’ll take my leave then.” The First Prince of the Sky Vault Sect smiled at the Dragon Emperor Clan elder, before giving the old man from the Sky Vault Sect a meaningful look, “Take that woman and that dog with us.”

The Sky Vault Sect member glanced forward and his gaze landed on Ye Qingtang and the big yellow dog in her arms.

He was shocked to see the big yellow dog in Ye Qingtang’s arms. That yellow dog… Could it be the one that destroyed the body of the Sky Vault Branch Master?!

Seeing that the old man from the Sky Vault Sect was about to say something, the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince merely smiled and gestured for him to remain silent.

The old man immediately understood and did not say anything. He only walked towards Ye Qingtang.

Without further ado, the old man grabbed Ye Qingtang’s arm and pulled her out of the crowd.

“What are you doing?!”

Seeing that Ye Qingtang was being taken away, the Blood Moon Elder rushed out of the crowd and shouted at the Sky Vault Sect old man.

However, no one bothered with the Blood Moon Elder.

In the next second, a flame appeared in the eyes of the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince. Immediately, the entire relay station turned to dust, including those guests who had no idea what was happening.

The Blood Moon Elder was so frightened that he broke out in cold sweat. Fortunately, he had chased after her just now. Otherwise… he would have been buried in a sea of flames too.

The Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince was very young and had unfathomable strength, his temperament was also extremely vicious. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

As Ye Qingtang glanced at the people from the Sky Vault Sect, she fell into deep thought. It seemed that she would not be able to escape if she did not use the power of her Deity Ocean. Ye Qingtang inadvertently glanced at the white-haired elder from the Dragon Emperor Clan.

If she did not hear wrongly, this powerful expert was from her mother’s maiden family, the Dragon Emperor Clan.

“Great Lord!”

A middle-aged man from the Dragon Emperor Clan caught sight of Ye Qingtang. He could not look away after that.

The middle-aged man looked very surprised. This woman, who was carrying a dog and being taken away by the Sky Vault Sect’s First Prince. Her appearance was too…

Especially when the middle-aged man first saw Ye Qingtang, he thought he was looking at the long-lost Miss Jiu.

“What’s wrong, why are you so anxious?” Seeing the strange expression on the middle-aged man’s face, the white-haired elder of the Dragon Emperor Clan frowned.

“No, my Lord. Look at that woman who is being taken by the Sky Vault Sect. Doesn’t she look like someone?!” The middle-aged man hurriedly pointed at Ye Qingtang.

“Oh?”

The white-haired elder instinctively sized up the direction the middle-aged man was pointing at.. When he saw Ye Qingtang’s appearance, his pupils constricted.
