Chapter 806 A Kind Act (1)

“The most vicious thing is a woman’s heart. It seems that it’s not an empty saying.” The Grand Imperial Sire laughed bitterly.

He could understand why the Empress Dowager hated him.

Yet, she actually wanted to ruin the entire Nine Nights Dynasty…

Had she never thought of how innocent the Nine Nights Dynasty citizens were?

“The little Emperor is young, and it’s difficult for him to preside over the political affairs. The Empress Dowager wished to use Qin Long to stabilize the current situation, yet she was also worried that Qin Long would end up usurping the throne. Thus, she made use of everything to seek a road out for herself.” Ye Qingtang explained slowly. She must say that it was sorrowful that the Empress Dowager was so scheming.

She originally thought that the failure of the Nine Nights Dynasty was because of Qin Long, but unexpectedly… it was all a scheme by the Empress Dowager.

“Bring… her out. Bury her with the Empress Dowager rites.” The Grand Imperial Sire shook his head helplessly. Not letting anyone else know about the incident today was the last thing he could do for the Empress Dowager.

From then on, no one would know about the Empress Dowager’s actions.

She was still the dignified and graceful Empress Dowager in the people’s hearts.

“Father…” The little Emperor looked at the Grand Imperial Sire with reddened eyes.

The Grand Imperial Sire called him to his side and touched his head remorsefully.

“Son, you are the Emperor of Nine Nights Dynasty. As the Emperor, you must be responsible for the safety of all Nine Nights Dynasty citizens. It’s time you grow up…”

“Father… I… I was wrong…” The little Emperor wiped his tears away. No matter how insensible he was, everything that happened today forced him to mature quickly.

How could an Emperor stay innocent and ignorant?

“You should know that your mother’s outcome today is a consequence of all her evildoings in the past. Do not hate others,” the Grand Imperial Sire said worriedly.

The little Emperor nodded and turned to look at Ye Qingtang. He walked to Ye Qingtang’s side with his short legs and bowed to her.

“I… I was insensible. Please forgive me, sister.”

Looking at the little Emperor who seemed to mature a lot in a short moment, Ye Qingtang was not in the mood to fuss over the matter with him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“It’s alright.”

The little Emperor stood there with tears trickling down. He wiped the tear stains at the corners of his eyes and did his best to maintain a firm gaze as he looked at the Grand Imperial Sire.

“Father, I will try very hard to become a good Emperor. I… I will never embarrass you

again.”

He no longer had his mother and could not lose another father.

The Grand Imperial Sire smiled in gratification.

Ye Qingtang looked at the Grand Imperial Sire. Deep down, she knew that with the elimination of the internal trouble, as long as the Grand Imperial Sire consumed that pill regularly, he would recover in no time, and the little Emperor would have someone to teach him.

It seemed that the little Emperor’s fatuity and stubbornness were deliberately instilled in him by the Empress Dowager.

Only then would he be easier to control.

Ye Qingtang turned to look at Long Jiang, whose complexion was pale.

“Come over here. I’ll help you to remove the Gu.”

Long Jiang replied. “There’s no need for the trouble, Young Lord. When I asked Her Lordship to mark the Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven back then, I was already determined and resolute. Once the Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven is used, I will not have many days left ahead. Even if I am poisoned with Gu, there’s no big deal either. There’s no need to trouble yourself, Young Lord.”

Ye Qingtang raised a brow as she looked at Long Jiang who was only thinking about death. “Who said you don’t have many days left?”

“This…”

Walking forward, Ye Qingtang locked Long Jiang’s wrist and checked his pulse. A trace of a smile flashed across her eyes unconsciously.

Her mother was truly a kind person.

“Perhaps the Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven truly would reduce one’s lifespan as you said but… my mother probably held back a trick or two and did not mark the true Vanquishing Dragon from Heaven on you, so… you don’t need to worry about your lifespan.”

If it was really a definite-kill move from the second mainland, how could she defeat Long Jiang so easily?
