Chapter 1489 Worsening Matters 1

When Ye Qingtang looked up, all she saw was three Skeletal Dragons pulling an extremely familiar-looking Black Bone Carriage across the sky. All eight tribe leaders were present as they arrived on black skeletal dragons ahead of the Black Bone Carriage. An aura of death permeated throughout instantly.

“...”

It can’t be...

Ye Qingtang’s face fell the moment she saw the people from the Temple of Shadows.

Even the Temple of Shadows came over to join in on the fun?

Taking a peek at the Black Bone Carriage, Ye Qingtang touched her unconcealed face and quietly hid behind Jiang Xun.

Please don’t let the person in that carriage be Ming Wang...

Jiang Xun was unaware of Ye Qingtang’s inner suffering and merely thought that Ye Qingtang behaved that way as she had never seen such a scale of events before. Jiang Xun comforted her immediately. “Tang Tang, be careful later. I never thought that news of this Great Demon’s death would circulate to so many forces either. Even the Temple of Shadows appeared.”

Jiang Xun frowned slightly. She did not know the objective of this expedition to the Land of Infinite Demons before coming. Had she known that it was for the Great Demon that just died, she probably would have stopped Ye Qingtang from coming no matter what.

A recently-dead Great Demon was enormously tempting to any clan. Every time a Great Demon died, the Land of Infinite Demons would instantly turn into a living hell as all the clans would go all out to contest for Great Demon’s treasures. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

At the thought of that, Jiang Xun could not help but look at Jiang Shangyu, and her frown deepened.

With squinted eyes, the Cyclops Demon King glanced across everyone. Suddenly, it seemed to have sensed something as it looked towards a mountain peak not far away from the corner of its eye.

Signs of cracks appeared on the mountain peak that used to stand tall. Huge boulders suddenly fell from the mountain peak, and a massive crack appeared on the mountain body as though it was forcefully being torn apart.

With a loud crash, the entire mountain was split into half as giant figures slowly walked out from it.

Those giants had extremely ferocious appearances.

Ye Qingtang could not help but widen her eyes at the sight of those huge figures.

“The twelve demon kings...”

Those giant creatures were all of the demon king rank. Including the Cyclops Demon King and Nine-headed Demon Phoenix, there were twelve demon kings in total, all of whom were notorious in the Central Mainland for their brutality.

Never would Ye Qingtang have thought that she would see the Seven Saints, Beast Master, and even the Temple of Shadows and twelve demon kings gathered here today...

Such a scene really left one dumbfounded.

The Beast Master’s and others’ expressions changed slightly when the twelve demon kings appeared before them.

As though there was a demon banquet, behind the twelve demon kings were countless little demons crowded together densely.

But right at this moment, a thunderous sound rumbled in the sky. A nine-headed demon arrived slowly while pulling a large golden carriage hoisting a flag representing the Ancient You Clan. Thirty-plus huge demons each carrying an Ancient You Clan member flaunted their wings as they stayed in formation in front of the golden carriage.

“The Ancient You Clan... actually mobilized over thirty elders?” Jiang Xun, who was beside Ye Qingtang, noticed the Ancient You Clan’s troops. Suspecting that she was blind, she felt her eyes pop open.
