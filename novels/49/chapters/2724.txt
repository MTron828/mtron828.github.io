Chapter 2725: Returning To Her Era (3)

Ye Qingtang sized up Ling Yan for a long time.

“Miss Ye, this is for you.” Ling Yan handed a scarlet crystal to Ye Qingtang.

“What is it?” Ye Qingtang was a little puzzled as she stared at the crystal. However, she felt that this crystal contained an incomprehensible energy.

“Origin Stone,” Ling Yan explained. “This Origin Stone can temporarily control all the power in your body. It can also control the power in your Heart of the Heavenly Dao in your body.”

Ye Qingtang was surprised. It could absorb the power of the Heart of the Heavenly Dao…

“But remember, you cannot use it in this era. You can only use it after returning to our own era,” Ling Yan said.

“Why?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Miss Ye, do you remember the two black shadows you saw?” Ling Yan asked.

“You even know about that…”

Ling Yan chuckled. “Miss Ye, you have my karma power in you. I will know everything you see.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

Why did she feel like she was being peeped at?

“Miss Ye, do you have the Heaven Ascension Sect Master’s relic with you?” Ling Yan asked. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Yes.” Ye Qingtang nodded.

“In that case, it’s time for us to return,” Ling Yan said with a smile.

“But I have not brought the Paragon Relic back to the Great Immortal Temple,” Ye Qingtang said.

“In that case, Miss Ye can deliver the Paragon Relic to the Great Immortal Temple first.”

...

That day, Ye Qingtang returned to the Great Immortal Temple and secretly placed the relic in her Master, the Nine Heavens Saint’s bedroom.

“Master, I am leaving.”

Standing in mid-air, Ye Qingtang stared at the Great Immortal Temple below, feeling rather reluctant to leave.

In the end, she was only a passerby in this era. Now that she was leaving, she would be leaving without even a word of goodbye. They would probably never meet again.

...

After meeting up with Ling Yan, Ye Qingtang took out the Space-Time Relic and handed it to him.

The Space-Time Relic shone brightly and Ye Qingtang’s body became extremely light.

“Holy Lady, why are you back so soon?!”

A familiar voice sounded.

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes slowly and the Blood Moon Elder’s face appeared in her eyes. Not far away, the big yellow dog was wagging its tail and staring at Ye Qingtang. She immediately sat up and looked at the Blood Moon Elder.

“So soon?”

Ye Qingtang was puzzled. Many years must have passed in that distant era.

“That’s right, Holy Lady. Didn’t you just enter? Why are you out so quickly?” The Blood Moon Elder could not understand.

Ye Qingtang could not help but lower her head in deep thought. Fortunately, the Origin Stone that Ling Yan had given her was still here. Otherwise, she might have really thought that it was just a dream.

Many years had passed in that era, but in this era, it seemed that it had only been seconds. As for why, Ye Qingtang could not explain it but it was not important.

“Little girl, you seem… different.” The big yellow dog scrutinized Ye Qingtang up and down.

Before Ye Qingtang could speak, the big yellow dog looked startled.

“Little girl, have we… met before? You look a little familiar to me now.” The big yellow dog stared at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang’s expression changed slightly as well.
