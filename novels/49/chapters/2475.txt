Chapter 2476: Ancestor Qing (3)

The Yongle Tribe General gaped at Ye Qingtang. He could not even begin to understand how she had done that. Not only had she destroyed his powerful move, but she had also turned his demon power into water. This had exceeded the limits of his understanding.

This was something that was beyond the limits of what he could fathom.

And towards this mystery…

He felt a great sense of fear.

“How dare you!”

With that, Ye Qingtang glared at the Yongle Tribe General and snapped furiously, “How dare you offend the Demon Emperor! You deserve to die!”

“This…”

The Yongle Tribe General frowned deeply.

Could this elder really be the Yongle Demon Emperor?

How else could his subordinate have done such a thing?

“Kneel!”

Lu Yuanxiang regained his senses and shouted angrily at the Yongle Tribe General as he glared at him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Please forgive me, Demon Emperor!”

Without further thoughts, the Yongle Tribe General quickly knelt in front of the Flying Star Academy teacher.

After a few seconds of silence, the Flying Star Academy teacher laughed lightly and said, “Good, very good. You were cautious and admitted your mistakes. I see that the Yongle tribe has produced good talents.”

As soon as the words were out of his mouth, the Yongle Tribe General froze.

“Demon Emperor, how can we let this slide? This rude general should be killed!” Lu Yuanxiang said.

The Flying Star Academy teacher’s lips twitched as he heard that. Was Lu Yuanxiang a fool?

He wanted to kill off the Yongle Tribe General?

He could do it himself then!

Did he really think he was the real Demon Emperor? Was he becoming too immersed in this facade?

“Hmph, Lu, you are too narrow-minded. You cannot see how talented the younger generation is.” The Flying Star Academy teacher smiled and continued, “Well, since you think that his mistakes are unforgivable, you can execute him then.”

Hearing that, Lu Yuanxiang quickly said with a straight face, “What the Demon Emperor is trying to teach you is that his subordinates are indeed narrow-minded. When faced with someone claiming to be the Demon Emperor, as the Yongle Tribe General, it’s better to be cautious.”

The Flying Star Academy teacher threw Lu Yuanxiang a look as he said that.

This damned man, changing his attitude so quickly.

“Zang, I deem you innocent. You’re not the only person that has knelt down here all these years. Get up,” the Flying Star Academy teacher said lightly.

“Yes,” the Yongle Tribe General got up without saying too many words.

“What is the matter, you have nothing else to say? Do you still suspect my identity?” The Flying Star Academy teacher said as he noticed how quiet the general was.

“No… I would never dare… I just confirmed your identity and my mind is blank right now,” the Yongle Tribe General said with cupped fists.

“Oh, so you are being honest. Tell me how the Yongle Tribe has been all these years then,” the Flying Star Academy teacher said.

“Ancestor… since you were not here, you are probably unfamiliar with the situation right now. It is quite chaotic outside right now. The Yongle Tribe is doing fine, but a few years ago, the Xihai Tribe disrespected you, leading to a conflict and then a great war,” the Yongle Tribe General said.

“Are you referring to my statue?” the Flying Star Academy teacher asked.

“That’s right,” the Yongle Tribe General said as he nodded.

“Good, I see that you are filial,” the Flying Star Academy teacher said nonchalantly. “Before they had arrived, he killed a few Xihai Tribe demons on the way.” The Flying Star Academy teacher’s eyes landed on Ye Qing as he spoke.

“How do I address this ancestor?” the Yongle Tribe General asked.

“Qing,” she said.

“Greetings, Ancestor Qing!”
