“Junior Sister Ye,” Gu Yanqiu greeted with a smile upon seeing Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang nodded in response.

“Gu Yanqiu, so this is the person you found?” One of those other disciples suddenly asked.

Gu Yanqiu replied, “This is Ye Qingtang. She is a teammate in our mission to the Giant Rock Canyon this time. Junior Sister Ye, this is Meng Sheng.” Gu Yanqiu pointed at the person who popped the question just now and subsequently introduced the others to Ye Qingtang.

This time, Gu Yanqiu found a total of ten people as he said previously.

However, other than Gu Yanqiu and Qin Huan, everybody looked at Ye Qingtang with a subtle expression.

“Is Junior Sister Ye a new disciple?” Meng Sheng asked with a frown.

“Yes,” Ye Qingtang answered without emotion.

“How is your spirit root?” Meng Sheng asked again.

His excessive questions could not be blamed though; it was indeed unexpected for everyone that Gu Yanqiu invited a new disciple to join the team this time.

Gu Yanqiu would occasionally pick a few missions that were suitable to be completed by a team. Moreover, he had plenty of experience, and most of the missions he selected could be successfully completed. Many outer sect disciples were very willing to work with him, and the other disciples like Meng Sheng this time were considered to be people who frequently went on missions with Gu Yanqiu. The teammates Gu Yanqiu usually selected were very reliable, but this time, Gu Yanqiu suddenly said that he found a new disciple to join, causing others to be surprised undoubtedly.

They heard some things about this batch of new disciples as well and knew that there were two geniuses with green spirit roots this time.

“Red spirit root,” Ye Qingtang said generously.

With that said, the other nine people present were dumbfounded.

Even Gu Yanqiu and Qin Huan stared with their mouth opened.

Ye Qingtang actually had a red spirit root?

What joke was this?

“Senior Brother Gu, are you sure you want a new disciple with a red spirit root to go on the mission with us?” Meng Sheng’s initially emotionless face darkened the moment he heard that Ye Qingtang had a red spirit root.

He originally thought that the new disciple Gu Yanqiu found was one of the two disciples with green spirit roots, yet… she had a red spirit root!

Earlier on, he had already heard that there was someone with a red spirit root in this batch of new disciples, and they all treated it as a joke. He did not expect that in the end… this person was actually going to be their teammate and was whom Gu Yanqiu personally recruited!

Shock was written on Gu Yanqiu’s face completely as well. He had never expected that Ye Qingtang was only a red spirit root.

Gu Yanqiu saw Ye Qingtang’s skills at the Rewards Pavilion previously. Although it was not much, it was enough to gain his acknowledgment; thus, he made an exception to recruit Ye Qingtang into the team. He did not ask more then and instinctively felt that even if Ye Qingtang was not a green spirit root, she would still be a yellow spirit root. In the end…

In a moment, Gu Yanqiu’s expression turned a little awkward.

Looking at Gu Yanqiu’s reaction, Meng Sheng could not help but sneer as he openly looked at Ye Qingtang up and down.

“Junior Sister Ye, do you know the level of the demonic beast that we are going to the Giant Rock Canyon to hunt this time? That is a level 6 Giant Lizard which has killed countless of people.”

Ye Qingtang raised her brows as she looked at the sarcastic Meng Sheng and scoffed in her heart.

Meng Sheng turned to Gu Yanqiu and said, “Senior Brother Gu, you have always made sound decisions, but this time, I wish that you can properly consider whether a new disciple with a red spirit root would have the ability to follow us to the Giant Rock Canyon.”

Gu Yanqiu frowned slightly and did not give a clear answer immediately.
