Chapter 554 Replenish for Prosperity (3)

There were plenty of rumors about the Blood Moon Sect, but people had never seen them before. Now, the Xuanling Sect avoided the calamity due to the Blood Moon Sect’s help. They started to neglect the rumors of the Blood Moon Sect slowly.

Ji Yixuan and Mo Changkong looked at somewhere far away. The strong breaths of the hundreds of people were very close now. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Junior Sister, I shall leave with Senior Brother Ji now. I believe we’ll meet again… as what you said,” Mo Changkong said.

“Take care,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Take care as well.” Mo Changkong folded his fists.

“Lady Ye, I’m looking forward to meeting you again,” Ji Yixuan said. He then disappeared with Mo Changkong.

Ye Qingtang looked towards the Blood Moon Division Head Jiang Chen and said, “You should leave soon.”

“Us?” The Blood Moon Division Head was confused. “Holy Lady, aren’t you leaving with us?”

Shuo Tianzang asked in confusion as Ye Qingtang did not seem to retreat.

Ye Qingtang pondered as she had more important things to do.

It would not be easy for her to get the Black Heaven Water from the mystic realm based on the current condition of Xuanling Sect.

The array formation that Xuanling Sect had used to protect the Mystic realm was broken during the fight. The mystic realm did not belong to Xuanling Sect anymore.

Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect, especially the super sects, would definitely rush inside and claim their ownership. wuxiaworld.site

Xuanling Sect’s mystic realm was the source of inheritance. Normally, no one could enter besides Xuanling Sect. But now, the situation was different.

The Black Heaven Water could help her spirit root to level up, and that was her initial intention to enter Xuanling Sect. Now, she must get the Black Heaven Water. No matter what happened, she needed to reach the mystic realm in order to get the Black Heaven Water…

“Holy Lady?”

The Blood Moon Division Head Jiang Chen called out to Ye Qingtang slightly as she remained silent.

Ye Qingtang then pulled herself out of her thoughts and looked at Jiang Chen and the rest.

“I will not follow you.” She made her decision. “Huh?”

Jiang Chen was shocked.

If anything happened to the Blood Moon Holy Lady, how could they face the sect master and the Holy Lord in future… Of course, the Blood Moon Holy Lord might just punish them according to the sect rules…

However, Ye Qingtang had her own plans.

Getting the Black Heaven Water was just the first step. After that, she needed to go to the Nine Nights Dynasty to find out her parentage.

She did not have much time. The Xuanling Sect was safe for now, but after half a year… the barrier would be useless, and the calamity would arrive again. The Yunxiao Sect would never let go of the Xuanling Sect due to the secrets they knew.

Ye Qingtang only had half a year’s time.

She needed to increase her ability to the level of a Yin Yang True Lord within half a year. If not…

“Holy Lady, you should leave with us. How can we allow you to risk your life in the world.” The Blood Moon Division Head tried to convince Ye Qingtang with valid reasons so that she could return to the division with them.

Ye Qingtang thought about that before. The remote place was full of dead breath. There was no vitality at all. People of the Blood Moon Sect could refine the dead breath to restore their strength, but she could not.

It would be a waste of time for her to go to the remote place.

“Don’t say anything anymore. I have made my mind,” Ye Qingtang said.

Jiang Chen sighed as his Holy Lady insisted.
