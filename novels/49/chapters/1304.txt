Chapter 1305: Giving Advice (1)

“Ling Yan, I have something to tell you.”

“Do you miss me, Miss Ye?” Ling Yan’s voice had a hint of amusement.

If he were standing in front of Ye Qingtang, she would kick him without a second word.

Why can’t he be serious!

“Don’t be cheeky. I’m here today to inform you that your elder siblings have begun to fabricate charges against you.” Of course, Ye Qingtang would not really harm Ling Yan. She had been forced to act as she did just now.

In any case, she could tell Ling Yan about what happened, so she did not need to feel too guilty.

“Considering their intelligence, they probably couldn’t figure out such an essential point… Miss Ye must have given them some pointers,” Ling Yan said with a laugh.

“…” Ye Qingtang was silent. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s true that I advised them. However… didn’t I inform you immediately?”

Soft laughter rang out from the voice transmission stone.

“Miss Ye, I don’t blame you at all. In fact, I approve of what you’ve done. Right now, you are the Holy Lord of the Temple of Shadows, and the Temple of Shadows suspects you. Of course, you need to consider everything in the light of your status as the Holy Lord of Shadows. You must not give the game away. The Temple of Shadows is supporting my Royal Elder Brother. It is natural that you plot against me,” Ling Yan said with a laugh. There was no hint of blame in his voice.

Ye Qingtang had also thought so, which was why she acted as she did. But for some reason, when she heard Ling Yan being so considerate of her, a hint of guilt rose in her heart.

Ling Yan had helped her a lot, but she was harming him. She really felt guilty.

“Miss Ye, you don’t need to worry about this. In the future, you can do your best to advise my elder siblings. Otherwise, with their intelligence, things will be very boring.” Ling Yan spoke suddenly as if he guessed Ye Qingtang’s thoughts.

Was he allowing her to do her best to help his siblings deal with him?!

Ye Qingtang was thoroughly shocked by Ling Yan’s “eccentric thinking”.

However…

How disdainful was he of the brains of the Eldest Prince and the others?

“Alright. In any case, I’ve informed you. Don’t blame me if you make things difficult for yourself,” Ye Qingtang said. She was about to switch off the voice transmission stone.

But the moment before she switched it off, Ling Yan suddenly spoke.

“Miss Ye.”

“What?” Ye Qingtang pursed her lips.

“Have you noticed…”

“Noticed what?” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

“You are getting more and more concerned about my affairs.”

Ling Yan’s laughter passed through the voice transmission stone and filled Ye Qingtang’s ear.

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback.

“Dream on. Who has time to bother with your affairs?”

“Mhm. Of course, I am not as beautiful as Miss Ye.”

“…”

Ye Qingtang switched off the voice transmission stone. If she continued to quibble with him, she would really switch sides and help the Eldest Prince.

She had never met anyone so shameless!

The Eldest Prince and the others worked fast. Within half a day, they had gathered some clues, and by evening, the Eldest Prince, Second Princess, and Eldest Princess met at the residence for a discussion. They also invited Ye Qingtang and the others, who had advised them.

“Elder Ye, this is what we have gathered about the background of the people nearest to our Third Royal Brother.”

As he spoke, the Eldest Prince placed a pile of dossiers in front of Ye Qingtang.

This Elder Ye was usually quiet, but today, she had enlightened them with a single remark, such that they saw the key to getting rid of Ling Yan.
