Chapter 1373 Quack 3

However, the Dragon Court Sect never listed the Yuan Kingdom as its believer, and even if the Yuan Emperor went there personally to enter the Dragon Court Sect, he was rejected at the doorstep. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Yet, unexpectedly, it suddenly sent someone to invite Ye Qingtang this time.

After receiving this information, she could not help but look at where the God of Nature was.

Could this fellow have predicted all of this from the start? Was that why he assigned her the third mission just now…

The immortals in the Dragon Court Sect…

From Ye Qingtang’s knowledge of this world, anyone from her world would be treated by this world as an immortal.

Could it be that the immortal in the Dragon Court Sect was also deceived by the God of Nature?

Ye Qingtang had no interest in whatever sect, yet the God of Nature just assigned a mission.

Attain the admiration of everyone in this mainland…

She had to go even if she did not want to.

Ye Qingtang accepted the invitation, and Long Qi was delighted.

The Dragon Court Sect was the place closest to immortals in this mainland and was a holy land to many people. Previously, the Dragon Court Sect had always been unwilling to accept the Yuan Kingdom, but it took the initiative to invite them this year.

If the immortal could establish good relations with the Dragon Court Sect, the Yuan Kingdom could also be acknowledged in the Dragon Court Sect in the future.

After learning that Ye Qingtang agreed to head to the floating island, the Emperor was very heartened and overjoyed.

It had been a very long time since the Yuan Kingdom could raise its head in front of the Dragon Court Sect.

Now that their immortal was willing to head there, it would naturally boost their reputation.

The Dragon Court Sect had an immortal, but so does our Yuan Kingdom!

However, it was the first time that they received the Dragon Court Sect’s invitation after all. Thus, the Yuan Emperor still made full preparations. Even the carriage that Ye Qingtang sat in was built with an exorbitant fee, where the extremely luxurious carriage was covered in gold and embedded with a generous quantity of gems.

In the sunlight, those gems glistened and almost blinded one’s eyes.

Beside the carriage were hundreds of people in the same uniform who each held a flag.

However she looked, they all seemed like quacks as well.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched at the sight of the carriage that could not be exaggerated any further.

She had lost all hope for the Yuan Emperor’s sense of aesthetics.

“Immortal, are you satisfied with this carriage?” The Emperor did not sense Ye Qingtang’s oddity and asked with a tone of flattery.

Ye Qingtang missed the Temple of Shadows’s Black Bone Carriage dearly right now…

“There’s no need. The journey is long, and a carriage would be too slow.” What Ye Qingtang said was the truth though.

Although the Yuan Kingdom assigned her eight majestic horses, compared to the three Skeletal Dragons from the Temple of Shadows…

Wasn’t that speed like that of a tortoise?

Before the Emperor realized what Ye Qingtang meant, he suddenly saw Ye Qingtang flying into the sky immediately with the little white tiger in her arms and disappearing without a trace in a few breaths’ time.

“Ah… I was foolish. I actually forgot that an immortal does not need to ride a carriage in the mortal world…” The Emperor lamented as he looked at the empty sky, and he all the more realized that an immortal’s powers were incomparable to those of an ordinary person.

Ye Qingtang truly despised the overly exaggerated carriage, which was also especially hideous… It was a massive reduction to her style.

…

The floating island was situated above the central ocean of this mainland and was distant from the shores.

However, the Dragon Court Sect was only opened to pilgrims for a fixed date, and all believers set out ahead of time in fear that they would miss the day.
