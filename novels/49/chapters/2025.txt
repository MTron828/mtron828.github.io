Chapter 2026: Allied Forces (2)

A red flag was flying in the wind with them.

“It’s the Crimson League! Is that the Crimson League’s flag?” a stunned Ancient Clan Master asked.

Ye Qingtang looked happily at their reaction.

Only the higher-ups of the Temple of Shadows were aware of the fact that the Crimson League was going to help them and everyone else was none the wiser. She wanted to root out those who still had no intention of fighting so they could leave first.

But it seemed like they had all chosen to stay in the end.

This was no longer a mere battle between two powers and was now a war involving the entire mainland.

“Holy Lord, the Crimson League... will be participating in the battle as well?” A Clan Elder looked at Ye Qingtang agitatedly.

Bai Zhi and the other members had visited the Temple of Shadows previously but had not left a good impression on the Ancient Clans.

They knew that these alien race members from the Second Domain were extremely eccentric and wouldn’t hesitate to take their lives, so the Ancient Clan people had all avoided them while they were at the Temple of Shadows. They had no interest in any news regarding them as well.

They had all thought that the three alien race members had visited the temple to discuss other matters with the Holy Lord of Shadows.

Never in a million years would they have imagined that the Crimson League would participate in this battle and... that so many of them would be joining.

“That’s right. From now on, they will be our allies,” Ye Qingtang said.

That simple sentence raised their spirits greatly. They had already prepared for themselves to be utterly wiped out but who would’ve thought that...

Ye Qingtang would have such a formidable card up her sleeve!

The Crimson League, the strongest power in the Second Domain!

The people were finally seeing a sliver of hope in defeating the Ancient You Clan. That meant the mutant Wind Snake was now on their side. Under the gazes of tens of thousands of people, he flew down slowly and landed beside Ye Qingtang.

“Mo Yao, the Crimson League Army is all present. We will be commencing the attack on the Ancient You Clan.”

An ethereal voice entered the heads of every single Ancient Clan member like thunder.

The Temple of Shadows members all looked relatively calmer as they had come from the Second Domain with the Holy Lord of Shadows but the Ancient Clan members were all looking with utter joy at the Crimson League Army.

The Crimson League was made up entirely of alien races. Thousands of flying mounts soared in the sky, blocking out the sun. Even though the Ancient Clans were all-powerful of their own accord in the Central Mainland, they couldn’t help but gasp as they looked at the impressive army.

The Crimson League had not held back at all!

The flying mounts took all their breaths away.

Just one of these mounts would be enough to cause a huge stir in a battle within the First Domain.

And the Crimson League had thousands of them...

There was a Wind Snake in the Mu Family Clan but it wasn’t even worth mentioning in front of the mutant Wind Snake...

So this was the might of the Second Domain! Enough to destroy the First Domain!

This was the first time Ye Qingtang was seeing the Crimson League Army as well. It looked magnificent.

But she couldn’t reveal too much of her feelings, so she merely nodded at Mo and flew off on Ming Di.

Boom! Boom! Boom! The war drums thundered on as the two armies converged and headed towards the Ancient You Clan.
