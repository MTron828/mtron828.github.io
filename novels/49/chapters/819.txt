“Your cultivation base is only at Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, but you still dare to stop me?” Ye Qingtang’s lips curled up into an icy smile. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Presumptuous!”

With a furious shout, a Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three martial aura was concentrated to the maximum and exploded out subsequently.

A wild wind was stirred up, and the rocks on the ground were blown into this hurricane-like wind before being crushed into powder from the impact.

Xuanyuan Lie made use of this time to escape from Ye Qingtang’s grasp and retreated backward immediately.

“Why? Do you still wish to continue?” There was a lack of interest on Ye Qingtang’s face. and her eyes scanned Xuanyuan Lie.

“Ye Chen, what do you think you are?” A cold glint emerged in Xuanyuan Lie’s eyes as he stared at Ye Qingtang before him.

In Falling Sky Valley, he was claimed to be the number one talent such that even Gu Yihan, the top disciple of Perfected Xuanchen, and Liu Mo, the top disciple of Water Cut Peak, were not his opponents. Yet, today, he was ridiculed by Ye Qingtang who just entered the valley!

“You’re already defeated, and you still want to frighten me with words?” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

“Defeated?” Xuanyuan scorned with contempt. “Ye Chen, I only used fifty percent of my skills just now.”

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang looked at Xuanyuan Lie and said. “I only used ten percent of my skills just now.”

“You have a death wish!” Xuanyuan Lie burst in fury and charged towards Ye Qingtang again.

For a prodigy like Xuanyuan Lie who entered the late-stage of Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three at such a young age, he was naturally prideful and always looked down on everyone. Thus, he could not tolerate the ridicule in Ye Qingtang’s words.

Whiz!

Xuanyuan Lie launched a heavy punch with all his strength.

In an instant, a cloud of force enveloped Ye Qingtang and completely sealed all routes Ye Qingtang could retreat to.

“I’ll see where you can escape to!” Xuanyuan Lie suddenly inched closer with murderous air exuding all around him.

A cold smile played on Ye Qingtang’s lips, and she simply ignored Xuanyuan Lie’s desire.

At this instant, Ye Qingtang stood rooted to the ground and sensed the attack of a powerful punch, but she did not dodge at all.

In the next second, Xuanyuan Lie watched in surprise as Ye Qingtang stretched out a finger.

Boom!

A loud sound suddenly rang.

Xuanyuan Lie’s overwhelming punch was actually easily blocked by Ye Qingtang with one finger.

“What!”

Xuanyuan Lie blanked out and looked in disbelief at that slim finger which blocked his fist.

“When did you have the misconception that I wanted to escape?” Ye Qingtang said with a calm expression. “You… are really too weak.”

“Impossible!”

Suffering a huge blow to his confidence, Xuanyuan Lie shouted in fury continuously and flung towards Ye Qingtang with both fists as though he went mad.

However, Ye Qingtang only shifted the position of that one finger calmly and blocked all of Xuanyuan Lie’s attacks.

“It’s my turn.”

Ye Qingtang kept her finger back and smiled. “Look properly. The fist should be used like this.”

Right after she spoke, she threw a fist towards Xuanyuan Lie’s abdomen.

This punch was so fast that Xuanyuan Lie did not even see when Ye Qingtang struck.

Boom!

A deafening sound erupted.

“Ow!!”

At the same time, Xuanyuan Lie spat out large mouthfuls of blood. He held his abdomen with both hands, and with no strength to support himself, he immediately knelt beside Ye Qingtang’s feet.
