“Who are you?” The Wind Sword Sect disciple saw that the outcome was about to be settled and did not expect such a thing to happen.

That girl tilted her head slightly as her bright eyes glanced across the group of Wind Sword Sect disciples.

The Wind Sword Sect disciple wanted to berate the girl but was suddenly stopped by his companion.

“Don’t speak carelessly. That is Xuanling Sect’s inner sect disciple!”

“What?”

The Wind Sword Sect disciple fixed his eyes on her.

Although the girl was wearing Xuanling Sect’s uniform, it was different from that of Qiao Mo’s and the rest, with the most obvious difference being the embroidery that symbolized an inner sect disciple in front of her chest!

This look caused the group of Wind Sword Sect disciples to pale.

Inner sect disciple!

They were only a group of outer sect disciples from Wind Sword Sect, and as sect disciples, how would they now know the world of differences between the inner and outer sect?

“It’s… It’s Senior Sister Ye!” A Xuanling Sect disciple recognized that girl with just a look and was shocked.

“It’s Ye Qingtang? Senior Sister Ye?” The moment the Xuanling Sect disciple saw Ye Qingtang, it was as though they saw a ray of light in their darkness of despair.

Qiao Mo fell into a trance as he looked at Ye Qingtang with his mouth hung open.

“What are you still doing there? Do you want me to help you up?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow at the absent-minded Qiao Mo.

Qiao Mo stood up frantically and looked at Ye Qingtang with admiration and respect.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder beside Ye Qingtang scanned the situation, and the corners of his lips tugged up.

He still thought that the disappearance of these disciples was related to the Blood Moon Sect, but now it seemed that they were just cornered by other sect’s disciples.

“Senior Sister Ye!” Seeing Ye Qingtang, an inner sect disciple, the Xuanling Sect disciples surrounded her as though they had found a mainstay and looked at her with eyes full of respect.

Ye Qingtang nodded slightly. When she saw Lu Xiuwen and Su Wan, there was not a slight change in her expression. She merely glimpsed past them as though they were completely unacquainted.

Ye Qingtang’s sudden appearance caught both Lu Xiuwen and Su Wan by surprise. Especially when Qiao Mo and the rest surrounded Ye Qingtang with a look of admiration, Lu Xiuwen’s face darkened in an instant.

Ye Qingtang simply did not bother with Lu Xiuwen and Su Wan as her eyes were directly fixed on the Wind Sword Sect disciples.

“What were you all doing just now?” Ye Qingtang’s tone was neither warm nor cold, but to the Wind Sword Sect disciples, that emotionless voice was like a rumble of thunder that caused their hearts to quiver.

“No… Nothing much.” Upon meeting Ye Qingtang, an inner sect disciple, all arrogance was gone in the Wind Sword Sect disciples, who were previously blustering and truculent. Expressions of uneasiness were etched on their faces.

They initially thought that these dumb fools from Xuanling Sect would definitely be toyed around by them.

But who would expect that it would actually alarm Xuanling Sect’s inner sect disciple!

And how would they be unaware of the frightening skills that inner sect disciples possessed?

Even if all of them went up against her together, it was probably not enough to restrain that one girl. Moreover, there was still another inner sect disciple beside her. Just these two people were enough for them to be unable to bear the consequences of failure.

“Nothing much?” Ye Qingtang raised a brow as she took a glimpse at Qiao Mo, whose complexion had not recovered to normal.
