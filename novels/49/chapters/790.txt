Chapter 791 Old Acquaintance (1)

Ye Qingtang lifted her hand and hit Qin Long’s head!

Just before Ye Qingtang’s hand landed, a gleam suddenly flew over from behind Qin Long and pulled his body back instantly.

Seeing that she missed, she looked up immediately, and a tall figure suddenly appeared before her. She slammed her hand out.

That person directly lifted his hand and went up against Ye Qingtang directly.

Boom!

A loud crash erupted, and a violent blast of wind raged in the aftermath!

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback. When they exchanged blows, the other party’s skills were actually not below hers!

After a blow, that person suddenly took a step back.

It was then when Ye Qingtang saw that the person who suddenly attacked was a tall male with tough features. That man was about mid-thirties, and there was a hideous scar on his left cheek, causing his entire face to appear even fiercer and eviler.

Long Jiang?

Ye Qingtang’s eyes flickered when she saw the person, and she immediately looked behind that male.

As expected.

Behind that male was a royal sedan.

An eight to nine-year-old boy in a golden dragon robe was seated on the royal sedan.

That boy was extremely good-looking, but there was a mischievous and unruly expression on his face. He held his chin high up arrogantly as he glanced at Ye Qingtang with despise.

Qin Long was drenched in cold sweat as his life hung on by a thread. When he saw the boy on the royal sedan, he heaved a sigh of relief and immediately kowtowed with a depressed expression.

“Qin Long greets Your Majesty! Your Majesty, if you didn’t arrive in time, my life would have ended here.”

The boy on the royal sedan was none other than Nine Nights Dynasty’s current Emperor, Long Xuan.

The little Emperor frowned as he looked at the tearful Qin Long. “Rise quickly. I want to see which person in Nine Nights Dynasty dares to touch you.”

Qin Long wiped his tears and hid away the snicker in his eyes before flattering. “With Your Majesty here, I feel relieved.”

The little Emperor nodded and glared at Ye Qingtang with impatience etched on his face.

“How bold of you! How dare you revolt in my Nine Nights Dynasty’s monarch city! Long Jiang, kill this lowly peasant.”

The man who struck earlier on received the orders immediately and took a step forward.

Ye Qingtang looked at the little Emperor coldly, and her eyes subsequently landed on the man called Long Jiang.

Long Jiang was the ace of the Nine Nights Dynasty royals and was a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

He had always remained loyal to and protected the Emperor, and because of his watch, Qin Long had never been able to truly take over the Emperor’s position. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Even Qin Long did not dare to be too impudent before Long Jiang.

Ascending the throne at a young age, that little Emperor was deceived by Qin Long and trusted him fully. Now that Ye Qingtang was after Qin Long’s life, he naturally thought that Ye Qingtang should die without questioning.

Long Jiang stood before Ye Qingtang, and a strong aura emerged around him.

Seeing that Long Jiang was about to strike, Qu Xiangyang rushed out hurriedly.

“Long Jiang, no!”

A trace of surprise flashed across Long Jiang’s eyes when he saw Qu Xiangyang.

“Brother Qu?”

Qu Xiangyang had a complicated expression as he looked at Long Jiang.

Over ten years ago, when Qu Xiangyang was still the captain of the imperial guards, Long Jiang was Qu Xiangyang’s subordinate and was loyal to the same Lord as Qu Xiangyang back then.
