Chapter 343: A Beating A Day (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Perhaps it was because of the fear of Feng Moli, Song Junqiu was much more obedient in the coming days and did not appear in front of Ye Qingtang.

There were usually many cultivation periods in the inner sect, and because there were plenty of highly-skilled people, all the disciples were busy cultivating. Ye Qingtang had already been through everything in her previous life and was naturally familiar with the inner sect’s matters. Thus, she was able to get used to the things here quickly.

Regardless of whether it was the outer or inner sect, sects would be relatively easier on new disciples who just entered.

They did not need to accept any appointed missions by the sect. While Ye Qingtang lost her Juyuan Elixirs because of Song Junqiu, the few thousand Xuanming points that she still had left previously was enough to use in this one month. Thus, it was not urgent for her to accept rewarded missions as well.

This day, Ye Qingtang just stepped out of the Practice Hall and coincidentally bumped into Ji Xianyuan, who was about to enter.

Ji Xianyuan entered the inner sect together with Ye Qingtang, and although they were opponents who sparred before, Ji Xianyuan deeply admired Ye Qingtang’s skills after that match and did not have any prejudice against her.

“Junior Sister Ye, are you accustomed to the inner sect?” Ji Xianyuan asked Ye Qingtang.

“Fairly. I heard that you went to the Spirit Consonance River yesterday. How do you feel?” Ye Qingtang asked with a smile. She still respected Ji Xianyuan deeply.

“The spirit energy in the Spirit Consonance River is rich, and it naturally is the best spot for cultivation.” Ji Xianyuan spoke about the Spirit Consonance River with adoration. He had heard about the Spirit Consonance River since he was in the outer sect, but the fee to enter the Spirit Consonance River for outer sect disciples was too high, and even he would not be willing to spend lavishly. Thus, he only first entered the Spirit Consonance River after becoming an inner sect disciple.

At that thought, Ji Xianyuan admired Ye Qingtang’s boldness for spending tens of millions of Xuanming points to cultivate in the Spirit Consonance River.

If it were him, he might not be able to be so resolute.

“However, I happened to meet some familiar people from the outer sect on my way to the Spirit Consonance River yesterday. I heard that something seemed to have happened in the outer sect these few days,” Ji Xianyuan said.

“Oh? What is it?” Ye Qingtang asked casually.

“In the past few days, some disciples in the outer sect disappeared unknowingly within the sect. Wardens and elders have investigated for a few days and did not find any clues. Wasn’t there a period of time previously where disciples who were out on missions disappeared as well? But, somehow, this time it happened within the sect…” Ji Xianyuan said.

Ji Xianyuan found it strange and continued saying some more things.

However, Ye Qingtang’s mind was no longer on his words.

In the past few days?

Calculating it, was that not right after she entered the inner sect?

The reason for the various sect disciples’ disappearance during their mission was because of the resurrection of the Blood Moon Sect, but this time, disciples actually vanished within the sect…

A thought suddenly struck Ye Qingtang.

She had just entered the inner sect, and outer sect disciples disappeared without a reason. Apart from that person, who else was capable of doing this?

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes immediately. After bidding Ji Xianyuan goodbye, she hurried out to the outer sect.

Outer sect disciples did not have the authority to step into the inner sect, but it was an easy feat for inner sect disciples to go to the outer sect.

In the outer sect, the Blood Moon Sect Elder who was in Zhou Qu’s skin was walking together with a few other outer sect disciples.

“Senior Brother Zhou, what exactly does the sword intent that the warden has been talking about these few days mean?” A disciple looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder. Previously, he only thought that Zhou Qu was a useless scumbag, but now, he felt that this Senior Brother Zhou was pretty well-versed after interacting with him in this period of time.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
