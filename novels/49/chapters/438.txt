Chapter 439: Compensation (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The champion for this year was Ye Qingtang, and Qinglin Sect naturally lost their wagers to Xuanling Sect. However, Fu Lingtian competed for three years consecutively and took three year’s worth of rewards. How could Qinglin Sect be allowed to act so perfunctorily?

“That’s right. Wind Moon Sect feels the same as well,” a Wind Moon Sect elder immediately echoed.

“Don’t go too overboard.” A Qinglin Sect elder frowned.

“Overboard?” A cold glint flashed across Elder Mo’s eyes. “This is giving you face.”

“You all!” Seeing how Wind Moon Sect and Xuanling Sect refused to comply, the Qinglin Sect elders’ faces darkened, yet they could not back down in the current situation.

If they denied, Qinglin Sect would probably no longer have any face in the future, and the sect’s glory would be greatly affected.

“Alright. Qinglin Sect will repay as you all said!” The Qinglin Sect elder clenched and gritted his teeth as though he was butchering meat. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

It was indeed them, Qinglin Sect, who was in the wrong in this incident. No one would have expected Fu Lingtian to actually conceal his skills, and they could only comply, especially in face of the simultaneous coercion of Wind Moon Sect and Xuanling Sect.

“Apart from this,” Elder Mo said indifferently. “You must compensate my disciple, Ye Qingtang, one Mind and Heart Pill.”

“What!” The Qinglin Sect elder was stunned to hear Elder Mo.

The Mind and Heart Pill was a specialty of Qinglin Sect which had vastly small quantities and was usually rewarded to Qinglin Sect’s chief disciple each year.

The Mind and Heart Pill could allow a Martial Qi Level One cultivator to advance by a small stage and had great benefits even for a powerful figure at Martial Qi Level Two…

Nevertheless, the Mind and Heart Pill was extremely precious, and Qinglin Sect never produced more than three a year!

“What a joke. Why would our sect need to compensate your disciple?” The Qinglin Sect elder hollered.

Elder Mo sneered. “Fu Lingtian’s Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Two skills have injured my disciple. Don’t you ought to use one Mind and Heart Pill as compensation?”

“Injured your disciple?!”

The few Qinglin Sect elders stared blankly.

Did he really treat them as idiots?

Ye Qingtang crushed Fu Lingtian’s knuckles on the ring and tortured Fu Lingtian in every possible way.

And when Fu Lingtian displayed his Second Heaven Martial Qi Level Two skills, Elder Mo stepped in in time to stop Fu Lingtian. How was his disciple, Ye Qingtang, injured?

Then, Elder Mo looked at Ye Qingtang and asked, “Qingtang, how do you feel?”

“Master… my inner qi is not stable while my vital energy and blood are churning. I should be injured from the imposing air of Fu Lingtian’s Stage Two of Second Heaven… I’m afraid the foundation of my martial skills is affected…” Ye Qingtang said “extremely weakly” while even putting on a fatigued expression on her face.

“Oh? If that’s the case, one Mind and Heart Pill shouldn’t be enough.” Elder Mo looked at Ye Qingtang’s “weak” appearance and frowned slightly.

Ye Qingtang sighed. “Master, our Xuanling Sect is reasonable. As the saying goes, we should be easy on people. Moreover, Master has already told them to compensate one Mind and Heart Pill. Our sect keeps true to our words.”

“Mhm, very well,” Elder Mo nodded and said. “One Mind and Heart Pill it is then.”

Watching how this pair of Master and disciple echoed after each other, the Qinglin Sect elder snickered in fury. Ye Qingtang had a ruddy expression and was full of vital essence. How did she look injured?

Yet, whatever she said made it actually seem that they, Qinglin Sect, had a bargain?!
