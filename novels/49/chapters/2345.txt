Chapter 2346: Swollen Face (3)

It was like there were invisible steps below his feet. Ye Qing seemed to ascend, stepping on empty air until she gradually came face to face with Di Nuo.

“Ye Qing, what kind of trickery are you using?” Di Nuo was panicking. His body was not obeying him at all. He wanted to move but somehow, he just couldn’t.

Ye Qing looked mildly at Di Nuo.

“Haven’t you always wished to know why Lei Yan and the others are so loyal to me?” The youth spoke casually.

Di Nuo was taken aback.

Ye Qing suddenly snapped her fingers.

In the next second, a tremendously powerful force surged out from his body. The faint moonlight shone upon him as if he was being engulfed in a glowing layer. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Di Nuo was instantly stunned by that elite aura. He widened his eyes in disbelief, they were nearly popping out of their sockets.

What kind of terrifying power was this?

H-He could hardly breathe!

Divine Lord… Fifth Heaven level?!

Di Nuo’s heart nearly leaped out of his eyes.

Even in his dreams, he would never suspect that this useless Paragon Sixth Heaven level piece of trash was actually a Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level practitioner!

Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level…

Faced with this kind of cultivation level, Di Nuo was like a piece of garbage. Completely defenseless.

And he was not the only one. Everyone at present was dazed when Ye Qing displayed his powers.

Completely, utterly dazed…

“Divine… Divine Lord… Fifth Heaven level?” One of the students said in a trembling voice.

He was trembling partially from the shock of the discovery, but mostly because of the aura unleashed by Ye Qing. It was beyond terrifying.

“Who told me Teacher Ye is just a Paragon Sixth Heaven level? Let me beat him up!”

“No wonder, no wonder… he could bring Qin Feng and the others to the Divine Lord stage within such a short period of time. So… he is actually so powerful.”

No one expected Ye Qing to be hiding such a big secret. To think that he was a Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level. Why didn’t he just say so earlier!

Hang Wenwei was utterly dumbstruck. He pinched Gong Jinyun on the thigh. He pinched so hard that Gong Jinyun cried out in pain.

“What are you doing!!”

Hang Wenwei asked, “Does it hurt?”

“Of course!”

Hang Wenwei sighed. “So this is not a dream.”

Gong Jinyun, “…”

Was it a serious crime to kill one’s schoolmate?

Yun Chen was also somewhat bewildered.

Meanwhile, Lei Yan had snapped out of his trance and punched Yun Chen on the shoulder.

“Damn, and I wondered why you dared to let Boss go on that platform. So you already knew! Brother, how can you keep such a secret from us? We were nearly dying from anxiety. If I knew Boss was so formidable, I would have urged him to go beat up Di Nuo and not wasted any time!” Lei Yan wiped cold sweat off his brow.

He had nearly died from fright.

Yun Chen, “…”

He hadn’t known. He really hadn’t known.

He had previously suspected Ye Qing was some secret powerful practitioner, but… even he had never expected for him to be a Divine Lord Fifth Heaven level!

He had theorized that Ye Qing was probably some highly-skilled alchemist and knew some good martial arts moves. And so he believed that he might be able to hold his own against Di Nuo.

But…

He had really underestimated his Boss!

Suspended in mid-air, Di Nuo was shivering in fright. So much so that he felt his body was about to shatter. With widened eyes, he looked at Ye Qing as if she was a monster.
