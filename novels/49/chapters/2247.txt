Chapter 2248: Matrix Path (1)

Within the fiendcelestial’s tomb, the darkness could swallow all light. Even the various illumination devices could not dispel the darkness and could only maintain a weak glow.

The spirit pearl was an exceptional illumination instrument and was something that could make use of spirit energy. And only by infusing it with spirit energy could this device light up and not be completely engulfed by the darkness.

This was derived from the experiences of the people in her previous life. It must be said that Ye Qingtang had a very good memory. She could recall everything that she had heard of in her previous life.

When the crowd saw the light on top of Ye Qingtang’s head, the unease in their hearts decreasing quite a bit.

It was rather strange. Those who had first barged into the tomb had all died inside. But after traveling for several meters, they had yet to see even a single corpse. Lit by the weak glow from the lights, they could not see the path beneath their feet. They could only feel that the ground felt a bit sticky.

It was the sticky feeling of fresh blood that had not yet fully dried…

All the while the demon child remained behind Ye Qingtang, and so he could see everything around him. The entranceway to the tomb was far wider than they imagined. They could not see the ends of either side.

The demon child’s eyes eventually landed on Ye Qingtang. There was an intense guardedness and probing in those eyes.

“Mighty one, I wonder what conditions are there for one to inherit the will of the fiendcelestial?” The demon child suddenly stepped forward, an innocent smile on his face. That pure, guileless smile bloomed on his tender face, no different from a normal child. It was a smile that would make you let down your guard.

Ye Qingtang quietly sized up the demon child.

In her heart, she did not dare to treat him as a normal child at all. After all, who didn’t know that the “children” from Black Moon Palace were all blood-thirsty killers?

But they were very adept at making use of their appearance when necessary to trick others. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Ye Qingtang knew that demon child was just trying to probe her. The more one said, the more mistakes one might make. Likewise, the reverse was also true. So she just ignored the demon child and continued forward with the Night Soul Beast.

The demon child narrowed his eyes and stopped smiling.

After some time, Ye Qingtang suddenly halted.

Puzzled, the group looked toward the area in front of Ye Qingtang, only to see multiple stone statues erected on the path.

Those statues had very strange shapes. Most were heinous-looking demons holding tridents or long blades. They had malicious expressions, with long tongues sticking out of their jaws.

There were numerous statues densely packed on both sides of the path.

“Damn, what are those?” The hairs on Lei Yan stood on end at the sight of those evil demon statues.

“Are… are those humans?” Jing Ze muttered in a low voice after realizing something.

The crowd followed Jing Ze’s line of sight.

Everyone broke out in cold sweat.

Bloodied corpses were hung up on the second row of evil demon statues. Those bodies looked rather familiar. Weren’t they the first batch of people who had rushed in?

They had just been alive not long ago but were now trapped in all sorts of eerie, twisted positions on the evil demon statues.

In fact, their bodies looked like they had been smashed by something. Their hands and legs twisted in obscene angles.

Not only that, the weapons in the hands of those evil demons had penetrated their hearts, abdomens and other areas.
