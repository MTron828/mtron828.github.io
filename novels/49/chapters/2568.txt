However, Ye Qingtang made a prompt decision. Without any hesitation, she

communicated with the power of her Deity Ocean. Even if there was only a 50%

chance of her entering the Deity Ocean space, she had to try and not just wait

for death here.

The Ancient God Karma Tunnel was a rare opportunity. But Ye Qingtang had

not even reached the end of the tunnel and would never know if she would

enter a blessed paradise or a doomed hell. She felt a little disappointed but no

matter what, her life was the most important. If she lost her life, everything

would be meaningless.

However, Ye Qingtang’s expression changed drastically. She could not

communicate with the Deity Ocean!

To be exact, the Ancient God Karma Tunnel that Ye Qingtang was in isolated all

sources of power, including herself!

At that instant, Ye Qingtang’s face was ashen. She never expected that she

would die before achieving her goal. She would definitely die by the time she

reached the end of the Ancient God Karma Tunnel. Perhaps she had always

been unlucky, but what was this? Dying in this tunnel? Not even getting the

chance to see the doomed hell or blessed paradise?!

Despair and a trace of anger surfaced in Ye Qingtang’s heart. Was she so

unlucky?

Now, Ye Qingtang could only watch as the space-time storm approached her.

She could feel herself gradually enveloped by the storm.

Every inch of Ye Qingtang’s skin seemed to be torn apart. This was the first

time Ye Qingtang felt such pain. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Her consciousness gradually blurred. Ye Qingtang raised her arm with

difficulty. She wanted to see how powerful the destructive force of this

space-time storm was. Anyway, since she was about to die, she no longer had

any fear.

“Don’t be afraid.”

Suddenly, a gentle voice appeared out of nowhere.

In the next second, Ye Qingtang’s originally shattered body suddenly started to

recover for some reason and she regained consciousness instantly.

A faint figure appeared beside Ye Qingtang.

However, even though it was just a phantom, one could still roughly see its

appearance.

Long, ink-black hair fell casually to the waist. A gentle smile on a face that was

terrifyingly pale.

The gentle man in front of her.. t was Ling Yan.

“Ling Yan.”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. She reached out and grabbed at the shadow, but

her fingers instantly penetrated the shadow’s body.

“How

Ye Qingtang was slightly surprised. Why was it so bone-chilling?

“Don’t be afraid.”

The shadow repeated its first sentence.

“Ling Yan. What’s wrong”Ye Qingtang was a little lost as if she had not fully

recovered.

“Don’t be afraid.”

A complicated light flashed across the shadowy figure’s eyes as it looked at Ye

Qingtang

In the next second, the shadow reached out and grabbed Ye Qingtang’s right

hand. However, the shadow’s hand also passed through her.

The shadow looked at Ye Qingtang.

The shadowy figure seemed to be weightless as it flew through the tunnel.

Seeing the girl slowly close her eyes from exhaustion, the shadow was like a

guardian angel as it surrounded Ye Qingtang and blocked waves erupting from

the space-time storm.

Before long, a piercing light appeared at the end of the tunnel. It was only then

that the shadow finally stopped and looked at Ye Qjngtang quietly.

A warm smile remained on its face.

“Don’t be afraid.
