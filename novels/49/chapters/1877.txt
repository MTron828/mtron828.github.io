Ye Qingtang glanced at Fu Qiu, knowing that it acted kindly towards them all for her mother’s sake. Coincidentally, Ye Qingtang wasn’t in the mood to go outside and gamble.

“Who are they?” Mu Feiruo glanced over at the bodyguards surrounding Long Yao.

The guards were dressed in uniformed clothing and although they just kept quiet and stood there, Mu Feiruo could feel a strong aura from them.

Ye Qingtang shook her head. She hadn’t figured out Long Yao’s identity yet, but...

Ye Qingtang felt that Long Yao might be related to her biological mother, judging from the portrait she took out the other time. But she hadn’t confirmed anything yet and could only continue observing.

Baili Xi could also sense their overpowering presence. Both he and Mu Feiruo were alarmed and they raised their guard. After receiving tremendous help from Ye Qingtang, they felt indebted towards her and were very grateful. They trusted her very much.

But everyone else in the mystic realm was not trustworthy, even if they were also human.

They had witnessed too many incidents of people killing each other to satisfy their greed. When they entered the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm previously, they also witnessed people who came in together fighting with each other.

These people appeared so suddenly and were in large numbers, this made them raise their guards and become wary.

Long Yao handed the elixirs to her elder brother so that he could consume them. After some time, Long Yi also returned to the Crystal Palace and once he saw the man’s condition, his expression became complicated. He quickly requested Fu Qiu to provide a place to stay for the man and the other guards.

“Young Miss, are they from the Poison Valley?” Long Yi asked after settling everyone down.

Long Yao bit down on her lower lip as she nodded.

Her action made Long Yi’s face cloud up.

“The Poison Valley must have come for Miss Jiu. All these years, they haven’t given up searching for Miss Jiu. I’m afraid our plans must have been leaked to the Poison Valley, if not, they wouldn’t have appeared so coincidentally,” Long Yi said. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Long Yao took a deep breath before replying, “No matter what, we must not let them find Aunt Jiu faster than us. He’s so petty despite his high status as the Poison Emperor. Luckily Aunt Jiu hadn’t laid her eyes on him, I’d be disgusted if this person were to be my uncle.”

Ye Qingtang was taken aback after hearing Long Yao’s words.

Poison Emperor?

The Aunt Jiu that Long Yao had mentioned repeatedly seemed to be Ye Qingtang’s mother, but Ye Qingtang couldn’t confirm it yet.

But now...

What did she just hear?

Her mother had been involved with the Poison Emperor from the Second Domain before?

Uncle?

The corners of Ye Qingtang’s mouth twitched. She had no idea what exactly her mother had done. But from what she knew, her mother definitely caused quite some trouble...

The Poison Emperor was of high status in the Second Domain, people of ordinary status would never be able to even get close to the Poison Valley.

What had her mother done to have been involved with the Poison Emperor? Not only that, she could even infer from Long Yao’s words that...

Her mother even dumped the Poison Emperor?!

The vengeful, petty Poison Emperor had been dumped...

The news left Ye Qingtang completely flabbergasted.

But she quickly recalled that Fu Qiu had mentioned previously that her mother seemed to be avoiding something when she first entered the mystic realm.

Could it be that her mother was avoiding the Poison Valley and the Poison Emperor?

With even more clues about her mother surfacing, Ye Qingtang realized that things were getting complicated.
