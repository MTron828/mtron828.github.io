Chapter 819 He Who Has A Mind To Beat His Dog Will Easily Find His Stick (2)

“Serious offense?” Ye Qingtang looked at Xuanyuan Lie with a face full of smiles. “The two outer sect disciples of Peerless School have not said anything. Could it be that I was convicted of the so-called serious offense by you?”

“You…” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Xuanyuan Lie did not know what to say after being retorted by Ye Qingtang.

Just as Ye Qingtang said, the two Peerless School disciples whom Ye Qingtang injured had not said anything, but now, he…

“Fallacious argument.” Annoyed, Xuanyuan Lie waved a hand strongly and said. “No matter what, you did injure two Peerless School outer sect disciples. Thus, before your identity is investigated clearly, you are forbidden from leaving Falling Sky Valley!”

If this person was really from a hidden clan from the sea of clouds at Mount Qin, Xuanyuan Lie would naturally not dare to do this. However, looking at it now, he believed that this person’s identity was definitely feigned.

If Ye Qingtang was really a member of the hidden clan in the sea of clouds at Mount Qin, how was it possible for her to cultivate in Falling Sky Valley and be apprenticed to Perfected Xuanchen?

The spirit energy in the sea of clouds at Mount Qin should be many times richer than in Falling Sky Valley. Why did she not remain in such a good place but come over to Nine Nights Dynasty?

No matter how he saw it, Ye Qingtang’s identity was extremely suspicious, and she did not seem to be from the legendary hidden clan.

“Xuanyuan Lie, even if it’s about investigating my identity, it should be the Peerless School who should do the investigation. What has it got to do with you and Falling Sky Valley?” Ye Qingtang laughed coldly and said. “Xuanyuan Lie, it’s best for you to not be nosy. With this time and effort, going into seclusion to cultivate would be more practical.”

“You are educating me?” A vein popped out from Xuanyuan Lie’s forehead. Ye Qingtang had a sharp tongue, and he was unable to outspeak her.

“Educate you?” Ye Qingtang shook her head and said. “I am not related to you. Why would I spend energy to educate you?”

“Insolent. You just entered the Falling Sky Valley for a few days but dare to talk to a senior brother like this… Good. I’ll take the place of Perfected Xuanchen to teach you about the difference in statuses!”

At this instant, Xuanyuan Lie finally held onto an opportunity to not let Ye Qingtang speak and instantly lunged at Ye Qingtang.

If Ye Qingtang was not from the hidden clan in the sea of clouds at Mount Qin, offending the Peerless School was definitely a serious offense.

If he captured this person, once it was found out that Ye Qingtang was not from the hidden clan, he could send her to the Peerless School to receive his punishment to win their favor.

This matter was the only relation between him and Peerless School. How would Xuanyuan Lie allow Ye Qingtang to leave Falling Sky Valley?

Xuanyuan Lie rammed his fist towards Ye Qingtang’s abdomen.

“Just you?”

Ye Qingtang could not help but snicker. With the flick of a wrist, there was a loud boom, and Xuanyuan Lie’s fist was held by Ye Qingtang’s hand.

“WHAT?!”

Xuanyuan Lie’s eyes widened immediately, and his face was full of disbelief.

Standing rooted to the ground, Ye Qingtang held Xuanyuan Lie’s fist in hers with an indifferent expression.

“This… This is impossible!”

Frightened, Xuanyuan Lie locked his eyes on Ye Qingtang’s hand which captured his fist.

Ye Qingtang intercepted his punch so casually?!

“Xuanyuan Lie, you’re too weak,” Ye Qingtang said slowly as she looked at Xuanyuan Lie without any emotions.

“What did you say?!” Xuanyuan Lie hollered in fury.

He was the dignified number one talent of Falling Sky Valley. How could he be weak!!
