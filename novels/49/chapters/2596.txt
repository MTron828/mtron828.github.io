Ye Qingtang stared at the candied fruit in surprise.

“Sister Ye Yue, this is very delicious. It can also increase your cultivation level,” Feng Wuyin explained to Ye Qingtang.

“Increase my cultivation level…”

Ye Qingtang smiled and accepted Feng Wuyin’s candied fruit without saying anything.

The two of them walked forward.

Along the way, Ye Qingtang realized that the market here was indeed extraordinary. Most of the people coming and going were at the Divine Lord level. Many stalls in the market were also opened by Divine Lord practitioners who sold all kinds of things.

From unknown trinkets to rare herbs and even magical and martial arts techniques. They could be seen everywhere.

“Sister Ye Yue, this place is very lively. It’s somewhere where some major family clans and powerful cultivators gather. Some years ago, someone even bought a premium Heaven-grade divine weapon from this market!” Feng Wuyin said to Ye Qingtang as he ate his candied fruit.

“Premium Heaven-grade divine weapon…”

Ye Qingtang was amazed. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As everyone knew, divine weapons were divided into four grades: Heaven, Earth, Black and Yellow.

Yellow-grade weapons were the most common, while Heaven-grade weapons were called true divine weapons.

Heaven-grade divine weapons were rare enough, not to mention premium ones. If an elite Emperor-level practitioner obtained a premium Heaven-grade divine weapon, his combat strength would be invincible amongst his peers. It might even be possible for him to challenge an Immortal Emperor.

It was truly unbelievable that a Heaven-grade divine weapon could appear in such a market.

As an example, Ye Qingtang rarely used weapons now, as she just did not have any suitable weapons. Even superior Earth-grade weapons were rare. Without a suitable weapon, it was better not to use them.

After a while, Feng Wuyin walked to a stall and looked at Ye Qingtang with joy. “Sister Ye Yue, look. This is the Dragon Nine Thousand Herb, a rare herb that can improve a Paragon Skill!”

Ye Qingtang walked forward and examined it. She indeed could not recognize this herb. Many rare herbs in this era had been extinct for a long time by Ye Qingtang’s era. There were not even any records of many extinct herbs in history. How could Ye Qingtang recognize them?

“Tt can improve a Paragon Skill…” Ye Qingtang was deep in thought. In her era, she had never heard of any rare medicinal herbs that could improve a Paragon Skill.

This Dragon Nine Thousand Herb could improve a Paragon Skill, but she wondered if could improve an Ultimate Origin Skill.

After a round of haggling, Feng Wuyin finally managed to purchase the Dragon Nine Thousand Herb from the stall owner.

Just as the two of them were about to leave, Ye Qingtang inadvertently glanced at an ordinary small wooden box on the stall. However, the moment Ye Qingtang looked at it, the Heavenly Demon Pearl in her body had an inexplicable reaction and started to circulate rapidly in her body.

Sensing the abnormality of the Heavenly Demon Pearl, Ye Qingtang’s expression shifted. She could not help looking more closely at the small wooden box.

However, the more Ye Qingtang examined it, the faster the Heavenly Demon Pearl circulated.

“This is strange…”

Ye Qingtang stared at the small wooden box as she sensed the abnormality of the Heavenly Demon Pearl in her body.

It was the first time Ye Qingtang experienced something like this.

It had never happened before.
