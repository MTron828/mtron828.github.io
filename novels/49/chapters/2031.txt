Chapter 2032: Big Victory (3)

The Ancient You Clan’s foundation ran deep and Ye Qingtang managed to get many things just from their treasure house. Even the space rings that the youths were carrying around were seized by Ye Qingtang.

Apart from the Dharma treasures, she unexpectedly found several fragments of the Spirit of Chaos as well.

“Bring the corpses of these youths back.” She glanced back at the fallen bodies of the youths after collecting the fragments.

There was something she had to check. It was whether their powers had anything to do with the disappearance of all those demon cubs.

The reason they had won so smoothly today was due to Elder Cong’s unprepared state and the Crimson League’s overwhelming power.

Like that, the Temple of Shadows had just finished their search and came away with huge gains.

...

Elder Cong who had barely escaped with his life returned pathetically to the main Ancient You Clan residence along with a few people.

“Clan Master, the Temple of Shadows has joined forces with the Crimson League and attacked the Ancient You Clan. Please make a decision soon!” Elder Cong exclaimed as he stood ashen-faced in the main hall.

On both sides of the main hall were the Elders of the Ancient You Clan and above them was a 40-year-old man looking extremely solemn.

It was the Ancient You Clan’s Clan Master.

The Clan Master was stoic in the face of Elder Cong’s exclamations. He spoke calmly, “I know.” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“What?” Elder Cong was taken aback and didn’t understand what he was saying.

“The Temple of Shadows used to belong to the Crimson League. They were only kicked out because the Holy Lord of Shadows went missing previously. Now that she is back, it’s only natural that they return to the Crimson League,” another elder said.

Elder Cong’s face froze as he glanced at the elders. He suddenly realized that none of them were shocked by the battle with the Crimson League.

It was as though...

They had already expected this to happen.

Elder Cong’s heart stopped for a moment. He suddenly recalled how two days before the attack, the Clan Master had ordered the youths who were still cultivating back to the main residence. He had also ordered the more capable man under Elder Cong to return as well, leaving behind only the weaker youths.

He hadn’t thought much about it initially but now...

He suddenly thought of something...

Could it be...

He had ordered the powerful people to return as he knew that the Temple of Shadows had joined the Crimson League and that they were going to attack soon?

Just as he was worrying over this, the Clan Master spoke up once again.

“Elder Cong, since you fought with the Crimson League, I want you to report on their troop’s strength.”

His heart sank as he heard this.

So...

He was a pawn used to test out the Crimson League’s strength.

Even though he had finally figured this out, he did not dare show any signs of dissatisfaction and spilled everything to the Clan Master.

The Clan Master frowned as he finished his recount.

“The Crimson League sent so many soldiers to the Central Mainland?”
