Chapter 862 Travel Together

Since Ling Yan was alright, Ye Qingtang did not think much and immediately went forward to break the Shun Tian Formation from the outside and rescued the three Arcane Supremacies from the Supreme Academy.

After the three Arcane Supremacies were rescued out, they thanked Ye Qingtang successively. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Senior Sister, thank you for your help. I will never forget your great kindness from today.” One of the males looked at Ye Qingtang gratefully.

“It isn’t anything great. We are all from the same school, and there’s no need to fuss about this.” Ye Qingtang replied.

“May I ask… which batch you are from, Senior Sister Ye?” One of the Arcane Supremacies sized up Ye Qingtang closely.

“Calculating the years, I am three batches before you all,” Ye Qingtang responded.

There was a hint of surprise in all of their eyes when they heard Ye Qingtang.

“May I ask… if you have any proof?” A lady asked.

No matter what, it was better to be more cautious in the Dragon Vein.

Ye Qingtang chuckled immediately and took out a token. “I’ve always kept this item. Can it be used as the so-called proof?”

“This is…”

One of the Arcane Supremacies looked at the token Ye Qingtang took out in confusion.

“Senior Sister Ye, can I take a look at it?” The lady asked.

“Sure.” Ye Qingtang handed the token to the lady.

After receiving the token, the three people inspected it for a moment and were shocked.

“Supreme Token! This… is actually Supreme Academy’s Supreme Token!!”

There were less than ten tokens produced in the Supreme Academy for every batch, and every holder of the Supreme Token was an insanely-talented disciple whom the President personally managed!

For their batch, it was said that there were only a few Supreme Tokens, and no one knew how the holders of the Supreme Token looked like.

After inspecting the authenticity of the Supreme Token, the three people looked at Ye Qingtang, astonished, and cupped their fists successively. “Greetings, Senior Sister Ye!”

“Rise… I have already left the academy for many years. I am already satisfied with you all calling me ‘senior sister’. There’s no need to be over-courteous,” Ye Qingtang said.

The three people rose after hearing Ye Qingtang.

“Senior Sister, I am Li Bingxue. I am extremely honored to meet you today, Senior Sister Ye. Disciples of your level are the academy’s pride…” Li Bingxue looked at Ye Qingtang in admiration.

In the Supreme Academy, there were so many students in every batch that it was impossible to estimate a number, but how many in each batch could possess the Supreme Token?

Ye Qingtang chuckled lightly without commenting further.

“Senior Sister, I am Feng Wudang!” One of the Arcane Supremacies told Ye Qingtang with cupped fists.

“Gu Tianhe.” Another Arcane Supremacy added on.

After Ye Qingtang took out the Supreme Token, the three of them no longer doubted Ye Qingtang’s identity.

They were naturally able to distinguish the authenticity of the Supreme Token. Furthermore, if not for Ye Qingtang’s help earlier on, they would probably be dead in the Shun Tian Formation.

“Junior Brother Gu, Junior Brother Feng, Junior Sister Li, since you all are alright, I will take my leave first,” Ye Qingtang looked at them individually and said afterward.

“Are you on your own, Senior Sister?” Li Bingxue asked curiously.

“That’s right.” Ye Qingtang nodded her head.

“Then the person… who blocked a blow for you…” Li Bingxue was a little confused.

Hearing that, Ye Qingtang replied without thinking. “That is my companion. However, he has something to settle, so I am alone now.”

The three people nodded without thinking much about it.

“Since that’s the case, why don’t you explore the Dragon Vein with us, Senior Sister Ye? Could it be that you despise the three of us?” Feng Wudang sighed.
