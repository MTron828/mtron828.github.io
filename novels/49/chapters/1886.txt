Chapter 1887: A Lunatic’s Plan (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“We have no choice now. In the letter that Aunt Jiu left for us, she mentioned this secret pathway in the Crystal Palace. But it can only be activated in the daytime. We have to stop those people from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley from damaging the Crystal Palace if we wish to leave. The moment the Crystal Palace is destroyed, we will be in dire straits.” Long Xiao let out a gentle sigh.

Long Yao pursed her lips.

“I just don’t think that she can pass off as Aunt Jiu.”

Just as Long Xiao was just about to reply, a slender figure suddenly glided into view. Long Xiao and the rest instinctively turned toward that figure, and they were instantly stunned by what they saw.

It was as though that gorgeous young lady had stepped right out of the portrait. No one could discern the slightest difference in her appearance.

Long Yao had not been born when Aunt Jiu left home. As a result, she had never seen Aunt Jiu’s in person before. She only knew Aunt Jiu’s face from the portrait.

But at this point, Long Yao suddenly felt...

That the person standing right before her was her Aunt Jiu.

Even Long Xiao, who had met Aunt Jiu in person before, was equally dumbstruck. That pale, handsome face seemed to crack. His eyes were fixed upon that lovely young lady.

It was like that time when he first met her, so many years before. When he was still a youth, while she was so beautiful and regal.

“Long Xiao...”

The young lady’s lips curled up gently as she called his name softly. Her smile was like a thousand flowers blooming.

Ye Qingtang was very amused by the sight of the dumbstruck crowd.

To be honest, she did look fairly similar to her mother. But no one could tell because of her disguise. Now that Long Xiao wanted her to change her appearance to look like her mother...

Ye Qingtang’s ability to change her appearance had always been top-notch. But since she already looked similar to her mother, Ye Qingtang just had to tweak her appearance a little to achieve a complete disguise.

“Is this acceptable?” Ye Qingtang asked.

Ye Qingtang’s voice was clearly different from her mother’s and this finally snapped Long Xiao out of his trance. But he still continued to look at Ye Qingtang with wonder.

Originally, he had thought that Ye Qingtang would only be able to attain a general likeness, but her startling transformation was able to fool even him.

It was as if the woman standing before him was really his Aunt Jiu.

The only difference was that Ye Qingtang’s eyes didn’t possess that familiar hint of merriment... Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“You look exactly the same,” Long Xiao replied in all honesty.

Even the antagonistic Long Yao could not say otherwise. She just continued staring at Ye Qingtang with wide, dazed eyes.

Ye Qingtang smiled.

There was no way she could fail to look like her mother!

She had always looked like her mother. Just a slight alteration to her appearance was adequate. In fact, it would be rather upsetting if she didn’t manage to look exactly like her mother.

Long Xiao stole a few more glimpses at Ye Qingtang before suppressing his inner turmoil and saying, “Ms. Ye, my aunt’s name is Di Jiuyuan. Remember that.”

“Di Jiuyuan...” Ye Qingtang repeated slowly. “Isn’t she your aunt? Why is her surname different?”

Long Xiao replied, “This is one of the rules of my clan. Aunt Jiu... she was born different and so her surname is different.”

Even though Long Xiao was speaking rather nonchalantly about this, Ye Qingtang could feel that this was a crucial point.

Same clan, different surname. One was Long, the other was Di...

In the entire Second Domain, only the Dragon Emperor Clan would have such a rule.
