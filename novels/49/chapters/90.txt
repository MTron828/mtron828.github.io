Chapter 91: The Road To Becoming Powerful (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Inside Yunxiao Sect.

A slim and graceful girl was donned in white and stood in a room. Her stunning looks enchanted many.

Ye Xun stood by the side of that girl, and though Ye Xun had beautiful features, it seemed lacking when compared to those of the girl in white.

After she was chased out of the Ye residence by Ye Qingtang, the Great Elder sent her to Yunxiao Sect and had only just reached today.

“Ye Qingtang seriously still has a spirit root?” The girl in white read through the letter slowly. Her pretty brows were slightly furrowed, and her eyes shone, seeming to be rather displeased.

Ye Qingtang looked down without daring to make eye contact. “Sister You, Ye Qingtang indeed still has a spirit root and received Mu Su’s help this time. I’m afraid she might participate in the entrance assessment for Xuanling Sect. Grandfather sent me here to let you know about this. He can’t interfere in sect matters and will need you to think of a way to not let Ye Qingtang get what she wants.”

The girl in white who was standing before Ye Xun was none other than Ye You, the one who stole Ye Qingtang’s spirit root.

She was initially the granddaughter of Great Elder, but now, she was a disciple of the Yunxiao Sect Sect Master and held an incomparably prestigious position.

“You’re sure that she has only a red spirit root?” Ye You asked while raising her eyes a little.

“Yes.”

Ye You did not hurry to say anything and only raised her hand to straighten her wrinkled sleeve.

“A red spirit root is the lowest grade of all. I don’t think there’s any sect with a disciple that has such an inferior spirit root…”

Ye Xun trembled slightly.

“Sister You, although it is so, Ye Qingtang has been acting strangely in this period of time. In case any unexpected things happen, please do make more preparations still.”

Ye You laughed without emotion. “There is someone I know in Xuanling Sect, and I’ll notify him. If Ye Qingtang does not have the fate to enter Xuanling Sect, just let it be. But if she enters… she’ll also not be able to leave.” When she finished her sentence, a murderous look suddenly flashed across her gentle-looking eyes.

Ye Xun was extremely cautious, and she remained silent at a side.

Ye You was born with an extremely beautiful face, and she had an elegant disposition. However, no one could see that under that beautiful skin laid a heart as vicious as the Great Elder’s.

Ye You took a look at Ye Xun and said, “You don’t need to return to the Ye family for now. Just serve me by my side.”

“Yes,” Ye Xun agreed obediently. She knew that due to the fact that Ye Qingtang obtained the qualification to participate in a sect’s entrance assessment, Duan Tianrao would already be dissatisfied with her. If she returned now, Duan Tianrao may just cancel the engagement because of this. Hence, she decided to avoid meeting him for now.

“So you’re not planning to go back personally, sister You?”

Ye You raised her eyelids slightly, and a lofty smile emerged on her beautiful face. “A few days later, Master will teach me Yunxiao Sect’s mystic technique. Once the training for it starts, I’ll need to go on for a couple of months without stopping. Furthermore…”

Ye You narrowed her eyes as a cold smile hung on the corner of her lips.

“Is the current Ye Qingtang even qualified?”

“Sister You is indeed right. So what if Ye Qingtang really enters Xuanling Sect? How could she compete with you?” Ye Xun echoed gently.

Ye You smiled detachedly.

Ye Xun said, “We’ll have to trouble that old friend of yours to properly ‘take care’ of Ye Xun at that time then.”

Ye You laughed lightly. “Of course. You can get some rest here, I’ll report to Master and let you have the rights to stay in Yunxiao Sect.

“Thank you, sister You.”

Ye You swept a glance across Ye Xun thoughtfully and said, “Xun, you’ve always been smart. If you use it wisely, I’ll naturally treat you well.”

“I understand. I’ll definitely be at your beck and call.” Ye Xun pledged loyalty immediately.

Ye You nodded and walked out slowly.

Ye Qingtang, I will not let you appear in my life ever again. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

I’ve already accepted your spirit root. Now, you should die early!
