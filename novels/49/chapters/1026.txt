Chapter 1027 Undermining The Foundation (2)

“Hmm, I thought the Ye Family had suddenly become daring. It turns out they’ve invited a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord from somewhere to hold the fort,” Elder Gu said coldly.

In the eyes of Elder Yin and Elder Gu, a low-class family clan like the Ye Family was as insignificant as an ant.

Even so, the two Yunxiao Sect elders still had not realized that the Ye Family of today was not the same as that of the past. They only thought that this youth, who was a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, had some connection with the Ye Family and had been invited by the Ye Family to hold the fort.

Furthermore, the Ye Family’s current disdainful attitude was clearly due to this half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, who was holding the fort. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

However, did the Ye Family not realize that they could not move these two YunXiao Sect elders by simply depending on a young half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord?!

The Ye Family currently had only one half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, but both of them were half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lords!

With two against one, victory was certain!

“Young man, I take your outstanding talent into consideration. If you don’t die in an accident, you will certainly achieve greatness in the future. Remaining in the Ye House will bring you nothing but harm.” Elder Yin looked at the youth and spoke suddenly.

“That’s right. Young fellow, if you are willing to come to our YunXiao Sect, with your martial talents and powers, you could even become a disciple of the Sect Master. You will have a glorious future. However, if you stubbornly persist in resisting the Yunxiao Sect for the sake of the Ye Family, you will be damned and your bones reduced to ashes!” Elder Gu also nodded.

It was not that Elder Yin and Elder Gu wished to nurture talent, but the youth standing before them was on par with them. Even if they could kill him, it would take some effort. However, if they could bring this superbly talented youth back to the Yunxiao Sect to become a YunXiao Sect disciple, the Sect Master would be very pleased. Furthermore, it would greatly benefit the Yunxiao Sect to have another supernaturally talented person like that.

In addition, they did not think that a lowly family clan like the Ye Family could retain a supernaturally talented person like that. Anyone with the least bit of intelligence could see the divide between the Yunxiao Sect and the Ye Family.

No matter what connection this youth had with the Ye Family, he should also know that the benefits the Yunxiao Sect could give him were far greater than that of the little Ye Family.

When they heard the two Yunxiao Sect elders invite the youth to join the Yunxiao Sect, the hundred-plus youths in the Ye House courtyard all looked rather peculiar.

These two Yunxiao Sect elders actually wanted to attract a Ye Family disciple over to the Yunxiao Sect to cultivate… that was really funny…

They expended a huge amount of effort to pass Elder Bai Kui and Elder Zi Jin’s almost pervertedly difficult test to become Ye Family disciples.

And now these two Yunxiao Sect elders actually wanted them to leave the Ye Family and join the YunXiao Sect?

Was this some kind of joke?!

Was the Yunxiao Sect worthy?!

“You want me to join the Yunxiao Sect?” The youth stared at the two Yunxiao Sect elders and laughed coldly.

When they heard that, Elder Gu assumed that the youth had accepted his invitation. He put on an arrogant attitude and said, “Not everyone, just you.”

The youth’s expression immediately became rather strange. A faint smile seemed to hang on his lips.

“Why, do you Yunxiao Sect elders think only he is worthy, but not us?”

Just as Elder Gu finished speaking, several youths slowly emerged from the crowd of Ye Family members.
