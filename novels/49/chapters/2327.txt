Chapter 2328: Medicine Faculty (3)

Song Yanhan lifted his hand slightly and the medicine faculty students behind him stepped forward.

“These are the alchemists from our medicine faculty. Even the lousiest of them is at least a mid-grade alchemist. Teacher Ye, none of your students have official alchemist partners. Today, I have brought them along to partner with your students so that we can contribute our best efforts for the academy in the Inter-Academy Competition.”

Song Yanhan’s words sounded noble and there was actually nothing wrong with his way of thinking. However, he had purposely ignored Yun Chen from the beginning to the end. It was like he had never heard what Lei Yan said earlier about Yun Chen being their alchemist.

Ye Qingtang looked at the arrogant Song Yanhan without any expression before she turned toward Yun Chen.

As always, Yun Chen had his usual nonchalant smile.

But that smile stung Ye Qingtang’s heart.

Having one’s martial arts practitioner snatched away by another alchemist right in front of him, was a great humiliation. It was a complete disregard for his elixir-refining skills.

Only an alchemist with a much higher skill level would dare to do this.

“No need. Qin Feng and the others already have an alchemist partner.” There was no way Ye Qingtang would allow any one of her little brats to be derided in this manner.

Song Yanhan was taken aback by Ye Qing’s words. He never expected her to reject him.

It should be pointed out that countless martial arts students wished to be his partner. Even their teachers had personally stepped forward to persuade him, but they were all rejected.

Today, he had taken the initiative to offer this partnership, only to receive such a response?

Song Yanhan instinctively glanced at Yun Chen.

“Teacher Ye, don’t tell me that Yun Chen is the alchemist you are talking about?”

“Yes,” Ye Qingtang replied.

Ridicule flashed across Song Yanhan’s eyes.

“It is natural that you wish to promote your own student, but it is not right for you to drag down everyone else just for the sake of one person. Don’t you know what kind of help an exceptional alchemist can bring to a martial arts practitioner?”

Song Yanhan continued unabashedly. “In the past, Yun Chen could barely refine anything. Although he can produce some elixirs now, it is not enough. Teacher Ye might be good at teaching martial arts but elixir-refinement is an entirely different matter. I hope that you won’t implicate others for your own selfish needs.”

To the medicine faculty, they didn’t care how many Divine Lord level students this Teacher Ye had produced. Alchemy and martial arts were two different domains.

The elixir-refinement skills of even an Emperor level practitioner would be inferior to that of an elementary-stage alchemist.

“I heard that you implicated all your students in one of your personal vendettas. You are only protecting Yun Chen like this because you are worried you would lose your bet if he doesn’t pass the selection trials. Teacher Ye, you might be their teacher but you cannot be so selfish.” Song Yanhan looked at Ye Qing without an ounce of respect in his eyes, his tone was scornful and derisive.

It was apparent that Song Yanhan didn’t believe anyone would reject his offer. The only reason could be that Ye Qing wished to promote his own student. With such a narrow mindset, wasn’t she just holding back Qin Feng and the others?

The faces of Qin Feng and the others instantly darkened on hearing Song Yanhan’s disgusting words.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m
