Chapter 894 The Beginning of the Inheritance

At the same time in the cave…

Ling Yan stood up slowly. He crushed the Bone of the True Dragon and the Feather of the Divine Phoenix under Ye Qingtang’s surprised gaze.

“Ling Yan, do you want everyone to know about where the Inheritance of the True Dragon and the Divine Phoenix are?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Smart. The paths to the Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix and the True Dragon are extremely dangerous. We should let the others clear the obstacles for us.” Ling Yan turned around and smiled.

“Why are you so confident that you can get the Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix and the True Dragon?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly and said. Where did his confidence come from?

“I only want the Inheritance of the True Dragon. As for the Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix… That will be the second gift for you.” Ling Yan smiled and said.

“You… Why are you so kind to me?” Ye Qingtang asked directly. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Aren’t you comfortable with it? You will get used to it soon.” Ling Yan chuckled and gently touched Ye Qingtang’s glabella using his finger.

“I’m not confident that I will be able to get the Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix.” Ye Qingtang contemplated for a while and said.

People who were able to fight for the Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix at the Dragon Vein were all the most powerful people from the Central Mainland. They might risk their lives to fight for the Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. She had nothing to fight against those Supremacy Level people.

“Don’t worry about that, Miss Ye. I’m confident with everything I plan,” Ling Yan said softly.

“Why are you confident when I’m not even confident with myself…” Ye Qingtang felt odd and said.

“Of course. Both the Inheritance of the True Dragon and the Divine Phoenix are not comparable with normal inheritances. For example, the Inheritance of the Heavenly Demon, if Ye You did not have the bloodline of the Heavenly Demon, it’d be impossible for her to get that. It’s the same for the other inheritances. The inheritances will choose their heir.” Ling Yan nodded and said.

“You’re saying that the Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix will definitely choose me.” Ye Qingtang understood what Ling Yan meant.

“I think the flame that you used to burn the Diamond Boulder is not something ordinary.” Ling Yan smiled and said.

Ye Qingtang understood what he was referring to instantly.

Her Paragon Skill was related to the Phoenix. The Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix might choose her due to her Paragon Skill…

After Ling Yan crushed the bone of the True Dragon and the feather of the Divine Phoenix, the Wintry Yin aura and the Wintry Yang aura spread out in all directions.

Soon, the powerful people from the Central Mainland all rushed to different directions.

“Miss Ye, we shall head to our own destinations. Please take care.” Ling Yan folded his hands at the back after he finished his words. He walked out of the cave and headed towards the Inheritance of the True Dragon with the little azure dragon.

Ye Qingtang headed towards the Inheritance of the Divine Phoenix with the little white tiger.

The place they were at was the deepest place of the Dragon Vein. Even the Peerless School and the Phantom Valley had not explored this place yet. The three finest forces had no knowledge about the deep part of the Dragon Vein.

Somewhere in the forest after two days…

Fighting sounds and roars were heard from the place ahead.

Ye Qingtang walked towards the origin of the sounds with the little white tiger.

A few thousand meters away at the same time…

Gu Tianhe and Feng Wudang stared at a young man in rage.

The young man was slightly overweight. His martial ability was at the Fourth Heaven of the Yin Yang Perfected Lord level. His face was filled with a cold smile.

“Feng Wuya, how dare you… how dare you to treat Junior Sister Li like that!” Feng Wudang held his fists tightly and shouted in anger.
