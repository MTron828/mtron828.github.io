Chapter 1257: The Misery Inside (1)

“Insolent! What are you! How dare you be so brazen to our Holy Lord!” The Temple of Shadows Hall Master immediately stepped forward and berated Luo Qufeng coldly.

It was the first time that Ye Qingtang found this ghostly-looking Hall Master adorable.

Luo Qufeng cast the Temple of Shadows Hall Master a cold look and snickered. “I am not talking to you.”

Afterward, Luo Qufeng’s eyes landed on Ye Qingtang, and he smiled. “Are you unwilling to give me this honor, Holy Lord? Since you’re unwilling to make a move, don’t blame me for being impolite then.”

Luo Qufeng took a step forward immediately as a red gleam floated around his body.

“How audacious!” The Temple of Shadows Hall Master’s eyes sharpened, and his ash skeleton hand violently punched at Luo Qufeng.

Unfazed, Luo Qufeng struck his palm out, which met with the Hall Master’s.

An explosive sound rang the moment both palms crashed into each other.

Ye Qingtang almost waved a banner and cheered for the Temple of Shadows Hall Master.

However…

In the next second, the Temple of Shadows Hall Master was staggered backward, and his expression changed.

“…” Ye Qingtang was silent.

Her heart shattered once again.

Although the Temple of Shadows Hall Master was powerful, Luo Qufeng was even more formidable.

They could not win against him!!

“How dare you clamor before me? I am not interested in wasting my time with you.” Luo Qufeng shot a belittling look at the Hall Master and scoffed.

“Holy Lord, this person is disrespectful, and I am ashamed that I am not powerful enough. Please do make a move.” Knowing that he was not Luo Qufeng’s opponent, the Hall Master suddenly turned to look at Ye Qingtang and kneeled down on one knee.

Ye Qingtang’s heart was in crumbles, but she still maintained a composed expression.

Amongst the Undead Clan which she brought, the Hall Master was the most powerful one, but he still could not defeat Luo Qufeng…

Luo Qufeng did not sense Ye Qingtang’s thoughts at all. A sneer hung on his lips as he looked at Ye Qingtang’s indifferent behavior as though she had never paid any attention to him. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Holy Lord, your dog is nothing much.”

“You!” The Hall Master shouted furiously.

At this instant, the attention of all the guests was focused on Ye Qingtang.

In the ambush that the Luo Family laid today, Suo Mu and Hong Zhong were already defeated, and the only person who could control Luo Qufeng now was only the Holy Lord of Shadows!

As everyone looked at Ye Qingtang’s collected behavior, hope seemed to arise in their hearts.

The Holy Lord of Shadows was extremely powerful, and perhaps she could conquer Luo Qufeng!

Everyone’s eyes were burning with excitement. Luo Qufeng was just right in the corner. If Ye Qingtang was not wearing layers right now, the cold sweat on her back would already have seeped through.

Fleeing meant death, and so did fighting as well… The difference was only in the speed of death.

Seeing that it was hard to get out of the situation, Ye Qingtang faked a casual chuckle immediately and finally stood up from that chair.

She did not utter a word and merely smiled while standing at where she was, but her detached aura was extraordinary.

The guests were brimming with hope when they saw that Ye Qingtang finally moved.

“Is the Holy Lord of Shadows finally going to make a move?” People asked expectantly.

The extraordinary skills that the Holy Lord of Shadows displayed in the war against the Second Domain was still fresh in one’s mind. Even if she disappeared for thousands of years, no one dared to doubt her skills.

Currently, Ye Qingtang was the center of attention and the hope of everyone present.
