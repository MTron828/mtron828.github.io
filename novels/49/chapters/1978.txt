Chapter 1979: Crimson League (3)

“Crimson League?” The Fox Demon lifted its eyes, replying, “What is the Crimson League? I’m selling ice lamps here. You’re welcome to pick any that you fancy, but if you’re here for something else, I won’t be able to entertain you.”

The Demon Tribe leader was stunned.

What was going on?

“We’re from the Temple of Shadows. This time...” The Demon Tribe leader wasn’t done speaking.

The Fox Demon was somehow impatient, wagging its tail. “The Temple of Shadows? If I’m not wrong, the Temple of Shadows had nothing to do with the Crimson League long ago. Since you’re not here for the ice lamps, you may leave.”

The Demon Tribe leader was stupefied. This damned fox was chasing them away before he could even finish his words?

The Goblin Tribe leader’s expression also turned horrendous. However, he had to keep his cool and not do anything stupid since the fox was the ambassador of the Crimson League.

“The Temple of Shadows was removed by the Crimson League back then because our Holy Lord disappeared. However, our Holy Lord is back now,” the Goblin Tribe leader said.

The Fox Demon looked at the tribe leaders before its eyes riveted on Ye Qingtang, who stood behind them.

“The Holy Lord of Shadows?”

“Yes, this is our Holy Lord,” the Demon Tribe leader said.

The Fox Demon smiled.

“The Holy Lord of Shadows just disappeared for tens of thousands of years without giving any notice or updates at all. The Temple of Shadows was a member of the Crimson League and when the Holy Lord left without notice, wasn’t that as good as disregarding the Crimson League? The Crimson League never interferes in the matters of the First Domain, but you can’t just come and go as you like.”

The Temple of Shadows only managed to join the Crimson League because of the Holy Lord of Shadows’ persona capabilities. However, the Crimson League never received any news after the Holy Lord of Shadows disappeared.

The Holy Lord of Shadows suddenly came back but the Crimson League was not a tavern, so they couldn’t just come and go as they liked.

The Fox Demon’s attitude was obviously different. Though it still was polite, it sounded insincere and not as welcoming. Likewise, the two tribe leaders were clearly displeased by its attitude.

The Fox Demon didn’t seem to be that powerful either. If only the two tribe leaders’ powers weren’t limited, they could defeat it with their usual powers. But now, the Fox Demon was being too much just because it was backed by the Crimson League.

The two tribe leaders’ faces turned somber. This Fox Demon would never dare to behave this way if it were to be in the past.

They couldn’t help but feel displeased, but still had to hold it in. Right before they could say anything, Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke.

“You must have misunderstood something.”

When Ye Qingtang spoke, the Fox Demon’s gaze landed on her.

“Oh? Holy Lord, what do you mean?”

Ye Qingtang took a step forward. “What do you think we came for today?”

The Fox Demon smiled. “Aren’t you here today to lead the Temple of Shadows back to the Crimson League?” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“No.” Ye Qingtang shook her head.

The Fox Demon continued smiling. “Now you’ve made me curious. If it isn’t to rejoin the Crimson League, then why are you here?”

The Demon Tribe leader and Goblin Tribe leader were similarly confused by Ye Qingtang’s words.

Didn’t they come so as to rejoin the Crimson League?

Why would the Holy Lord suddenly say that?

Was it because the Holy Lord was infuriated by that damned fox?

“I came today to convey some words to the Crimson League.”
