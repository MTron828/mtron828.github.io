Chapter 1785: Deity Ocean (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Seeing the Deity Ocean descend gradually onto the altar, the demons all rushed maniacally towards the mountain peak.

The demons from the three elite tribes dealt with the demons swarming up the mountain swiftly and without any mercy, not letting them near the Deity Altar at all.

And at the same moment, the Great Generals from the three elite tribes made their moves as well.

The Great General from the Earth Demon Tribe was the most sly and he flew straight towards the Deity Altar immediately.

Seeing that they had already lost their first chance to move, the Great Generals from the Heavenly Demon Tribe and the Earth Demon Tribe quickly flew up and chased after the Great General from the Earth Demon Tribe. Lights converged in their palms and they shot it straight towards the Great General from the Earth Demon Tribe!

The entire mountain fell into chaos in an instant. The demons were all trying their best to get up the mountain as the Great Generals from the three elite tribes battled to the death. Loud roars surrounded them as the fresh blood from countless demons gradually dyed the mountain a strange color.

The cold gradually faded from Ye Qingtang’s body. She was lucky that the demons had all been focused on the Deity Ocean mountain, or one blow from any of them would’ve killed her when she had been stunned just now.

Ye Qingtang took a deep breath. But looking at the bodies of the demons piling up on the mountain, a chill went down her spine. She had no interest in the Deity Ocean or battling with the demons. All she could do now was to leave the battlefield and look for a safe place to hide temporarily.

The Great Generals on the mountain peak were having a fierce battle that shook the skies. It seemed as though the mountain peak was going to be flattened by them.

As they were trading blows, the Deity Ocean finally descended onto the Deity Altar. The moment the blue light landed upon it, there was a bright flash of light which blinded all the demons.

Taking advantage of the blinding light, the Great General from the Heavenly Demon Tribe gathered all his energy under his feet and shot towards where he remembered the Deity Altar to be.

In an instant, the Great General of the Heavenly Demon Tribe had touched the Deity Altar. He reached out and scooped the Deity Ocean into his arms.

The bright light faded as soon as the Deity Ocean was taken off the Deity Altar.

After the Earth Demon Tribe and the Emperor Demon Tribe had gathered their wits, all they saw was the Great General of the Heavenly Demon Tribe standing beside the Deity Altar with the Deity Ocean of their dreams in his arms!

The two Great Generals shuddered.

“Hahaha! It’s the Deity Ocean! I’ve finally obtained the Deity Ocean!” The eyes of the Great General from the Heavenly Demon Tribe lit up with greed. He could already feel the strong power emanating from the Deity Ocean in his arms.

The two Great Generals were about to snatch it from him, but the Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General suddenly narrowed his eyes and pressed the Deity Ocean into his chest. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“It’s been hundreds of thousands of years, I’ve waited for this day for hundreds of thousands of years. The power of the Deity Ocean belongs to me. All of you will name me the Emperor!”

In the next second, the Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General let out a deep roar. Black mist poured continuously out of his hands. He was going to absorb the power he had waited for hundreds of thousands of years into his body!

“Not good, he’s about to absorb the power of the Deity Ocean!” The Great General of the Earth Demon Tribe felt his hairs stand on end. If the Great General of the Heavenly Demon Tribe managed to succeed, they would be annihilated tomorrow!

In the next moment, the Great General of the Earth Demon Tribe and Heavenly Demon Tribe flew towards the Great General of the Heavenly Demon Tribe and directed their blows to his back.

But in an instant, the Heavenly Demon Tribe Great General was surrounded by blue light.
