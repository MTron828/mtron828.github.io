Chapter 1111 A Single Spark Can Start A Prairie Fire (1)

Apart from Perfected Xuanchen’s guidance, Ye Qingtang also took time out to impart high-level mental cultivation techniques, swordplay techniques, martial arts, lightness skill, and remarkable skills to Little You Yun and Little Luo Xue. Even a genius would require at least several years to attain great achievements in cultivating these martial cultivation techniques.

Nonetheless, these two little kids were monstrously gifted and only used two days to perfect these cultivation techniques.

Perfected Xuanchen proclaimed that he had taught quite a number of outstanding and gifted disciples, but they were worlds apart when compared to these two little kids.

He even thought that he was dreaming as the speed of the kids’ improvement was truly too fake…

In two days, they advanced to the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord Second Heaven and Fourth Heaven respectively and even attained phenomenal success in the martial arts cultivation techniques that Ye Qingtang imparted.

This was probably the potential of a god.

The martial potential of the two little kids was too frightening, and Ye Qingtang had never seen such a situation in both lives.

Of course, in her previous life, a Holy Venerate was not unparalleled in the Second Domain as there were numerous Emperor-level powerful figures.

At this instant, Little Luo Xue floated in the sky, and his bright eyes looked at Ye Qingtang as he giggled.

“These two little kids… are too unbelievable…” Perfected Xuanchen marveled as he looked at Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun.

“If they continue on at this speed… Little Luo Xue and Little You Yun will probably be able to advance to the Arcane Supremacy realm in less than half a month!” Perfected Xuanchen looked at Ye Qingtang and said.

A smile that was unbeknown to even Ye Qingtang filled her eyes as she looked at the two little kids. After hearing Perfected Xuanchen, she shook her head and said, “It shouldn’t be. The higher the martial realm, the harder it is to advance further. Moreover, the spirit energy on this mainland is too thin and very limited. It is insufficient to support the Arcane Supremacy realm unless they leave this mainland.”

Perfected Xuanchen did not refute her as no Supremacy had ever appeared on this mainland.

A span of two short days seem like an extremely short period of time, but a great change had already happened.

The You Ancient Clan came to this mainland finally.From the north of this mainland, all the sects had been annihilated and subsequently reorganized as a force of the You Ancient Clan.

Its speed was so swift that it simply left one tongue-tied.

It was at this moment when Ye Qingtang and the rest truly experienced the might and fearfulness of the You Ancient Clan.

You Ancient Clan was certainly a powerful ancient clan force with ten thousand years of heritage. To destroy this mainland, they did not use the normal methods that ordinary people thought of; they did not even need to use their own hands and instead used another even more shocking method.

They recaptured all the sects and family clans of this mainland for their own use and used them as cannon fodder to block all forces who dared to resist.

In just a few days, countless big and small sects submitted to You Ancient Clan and did not have the slightest intention to resist. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang was not surprised by this situation.

The spirit energy on this mainland was already thin, and Yin Yang Perfected Lords were extremely rare.
