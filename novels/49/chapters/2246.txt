Chapter 2247: Tomb (3)

After being surrounded in the darkness for a fair amount of time, it no longer affected the sight of martial art practitioners. Darkness was no obstacle to them as they could still see in the dark.

This was the thinking of the crowd as they stepped into the fiendcelestial’s tomb.

But after they truly stepped in, they realized that they could not see through the darkness.

The weakest man in that group was still at least a Divine Lord First Heaven level, while the most powerful was already at the Eighth Heaven level. To them, darkness was nothing to be worried about. But now, they could not even see their own hands stretched out in front of them.

A cold breeze blew by their ears. It was a chilly draught which originated from the deeper recesses of the tomb. It brought with it a rotting stench, which intermingled with the smell of fresh blood.

“Lights.” Ye Qingtang’s voice rang out from the front.

The crowd finally snapped out of their trance and each brought out their various illumination instruments.

“Luckily I was well-prepared and specially brought an illuminating lamp.” Nangong Lie murmured softly as he reached into his space ring.

“You have an illuminating lamp? Good job.” Lei Yan patted Nangong Lie on the shoulder.

Illuminating lamps were one of the more superior illumination instruments. The Leiting family had several and used them in their underground practice arena. The palm-sized lamp could light up a radius spanning several miles. Once lit, it could transform the surrounding darkness into an area as bright as day.

Nangong Lie chuckled as he took out the illuminating lamp. But after he lit it, the lamp exuded a weak brightness that was only enough to light up a one-meter radius around him.

And the glow was murky, even more dismal than the weak flickering of a candle’s flame.

Nangong Lie: “…” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lei Yan shot Nangong Lie a strange look. “Is this a fake?”

Wasn’t this an illuminating lamp?

Nangong Lie was also puzzled. This was a genuine article, but… why was the light so weak?

Qin Feng and the group thought that they would be able to see the path clearly by that single illuminating lamp. But now, they all started to take out their own illumination devices.

But when they lit their own instruments, the results were…

Even dimmer than that illuminating lamp.

They could only light up the upper half of their bodies.

The same situation happened to everyone in the tomb. All sorts of illumination devices were taken out but could only produce a weak glow which looked like it was being swallowed by the darkness in the pitch-black tomb.

“This tomb is rather strange. I already found it strange when it was already so dark the moment we stepped inside. Light from the outside is unable to penetrate into this tomb at all.” One of the men turned to look at the entrance.

The doorway leading to the outside Evil Soul Forest was still bright. But it was pitch-black on the inside.

That stone door was like a portal between two entirely separate worlds.

“Everyone, please stop and keep quiet.” Ye Qingtang’s voice rang out again. A ball of light was floating at the front, where she was standing. That ball of light was more dazzling than any of the illuminating devices held by the others.

“What’s that?” The crowd stared curiously at the ball of light floating above Ye Qingtang’s head.

Instead of responding, Ye Qingtang only continued forward.

She had already known that she would be coming to the Evil Soul Forest and so made the necessary preparations. In her previous life, quite a bit of information regarding the fiendcelestial’s tomb had been circulated around. She didn’t plan to enter the tomb but was worried that other places in the Evil Soul Forest might have the same situation, so she had specially gone to buy a spirit pearl.
