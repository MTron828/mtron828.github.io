Chapter 2639 Cage Prison (1)

Ye Qingtang waited until dusk before the unconscious Heavenly Emperor woke up.

Seeing that the Heavenly Emperor had awakened, Ye Qingtang quickly retreated and prepared to leave. However, before Ye Qingtang moved too far, a shadow flashed across the void and appeared beside her.

That shadow was none other than the Heavenly Emperor himself.

The Heavenly Emperor stood in front of Ye Qingtang and stared at her expressionlessly.

“You are the one who saved me.” The Heavenly Emperor was the first to speak after a long while.

Ye Qingtang was relieved when she saw that the Heavenly Emperor did not have any ill intentions toward her.

“Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline… I see. You are also the one who absorbed the destructive energy in my body,” the Heavenly Emperor said slowly as he sized up Ye Qingtang

Ye Qingtang was slightly taken aback by the Heavenly Emperor’s words. Even the Heavenly Emperor had detected her Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline… Seeing Ye Qingtang’s startled expression, the Heavenly Emperor said indifferently, “Don’t panic. I have no interest in your Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline.”

“That’s good…” Ye Qingtang heaved a sigh of relief.

If this Heavenly Emperor was like Han Cangming from before, Ye Qingtang would not be able to fight him off.

“What is your name?” The Heavenly Emperor asked Ye Qingtang.

“My name is not important,” Ye Qingtang said.

“You have quite the personality. No one has ever dared to speak to me like that,” the Heavenly Emperor said. “However, since you saved me, I will spare your life.”

Ye Qingtang, “…”

“If I remember correctly, you were the one who warned me to be careful as I underwent the Heavenly Tribulation,” the Heavenly Emperor continued.

Ye Qingtang did not deny and nodded.

“So you saw something that I could not see, right?” The Heavenly Emperor looked at Ye Qingtang meaningfully.

As expected, Ye Qingtang was not wrong. Even the Heavenly Emperor could not see the huge shadow with blood-red eyes behind the thundercloud.

“Do you know what happened and what attacked me after I underwent the 10th Heavenly Tribulation?” The Heavenly Emperor asked Ye Qingtang.

“I did.” Ye Qingtang had no choice but to tell the Heavenly Emperor what she saw. “Behind the thundercloud was a huge shadow. After you underwent the 10th Heavenly Tribulation, it was that shadow that attacked you and severely injured you.”

“Shadow…” The Heavenly Emperor seemed to be deep in thought. “From the looks of it, the secret legend is real.” “Secret legend?” Ye Qingtang was rather curious about what the Heavenly Emperor was referring to.

Seeing Ye Qingtang’s puzzled expression, the Heavenly Emperor sat on the ground expressionlessly and patted the space in front of him. “Sit.”

“Oh…”

Ye Qingtang did not dare to disobey the Heavenly Emperor. She had no choice but to sit down.

“It looks like you’re also very interested in the secret legend. You wish to know,” the Heavenly Emperor said calmly.

“If you are willing to tell me,” Ye Qingtang said.

“You really have a unique personality.” The Heavenly Emperor looked at Ye Qingtang and immediately looked away. “I can tell you about the secret legend. It concerns a cage prison.”

“Cage prison?” Ye Qingtang had a strange expression. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“That’s right.” The Heavenly Emperor looked up into the sky. “The lower realm has always been a cage prison. And at the end of the void, there’s an upper realm.”

“What do you mean…” Ye Qingtang asked.

“That so-called shadow which you saw must have been the guardian of the lower realm cage. Its existence is to prevent any living being from escaping from the lower realm.” A cold glint surfaced in the Heavenly Emperor’s eyes.
