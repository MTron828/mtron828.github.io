Chapter 1138: Possession (2)

“It’s a pity. It’s still short by a little… But compared to before, this demonic creature’s mental defense is much weaker,” the Blood Moon Elder said.

Upon hearing that, Ye Qingtang continued to increase the amount and density of the black flame, causing the demonic creature to lose control of his mind. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Fifteen minutes later, the Blood Moon Elder fell onto the ground with a pale complexion.

“It’s so painful!”

The demonic creature slowly stood up from the ground and let out a deafening roar that resembled explosive thunder in the sky.

Witnessing this, Ye Qingtang slowly retracted all her black flames as the Blood Moon Elder had clearly succeeded in the possession.

“I can’t anymore… It’s so painful…” The Blood Moon Elder howled continuously.

Ye Qingtang was calm to the wailing Blood Moon Elder and shrugged slightly.

The demonic creature was already severely injured prior to this and was burned by Ye Qingtang’s black flame when it was defenseless…

Now that the Blood Moon Elder succeeded in possessing it, he was fully bonded with the demonic creature’s body.

It would be weird if he did not feel pain.

“Eat this.” Ye Qingtang took out a bottle of healing elixir from her space ring and tossed it to Blood Moon Elder.

After getting hold of it, the Blood Moon Elder poured all of its contents down his throat.

However, this healing elixir did not seem to be effective on his new body and could only relieve a slight amount of the excruciating pain all over his body.

Ye Qingtang’s healing elixir was merely targeted towards Yin Yang Perfected Lord figures while this demonic creature’s skills were way beyond the Yin Yang Perfected Lord realm; thus, this elixir did not have any special use for the Blood Moon Elder.

The Blood Moon Elder sat on the ground cross-legged and used his own powers to heal himself.

It had to be said that not only did this demonic creature’s body possess perfect defense, but its healing powers were extremely shocking as well: in less than an hour, it had already healed thirty to forty percent.

“Puff… puff…” The Blood Moon Elder panted heavily. “Holy Lady, this demonic creature’s body is really insanely powerful…”

“It’s good that you like it.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Blood Moon Elder and chuckled.

Blood Moon Elder immediately checked himself out and eventually wore a helpless expression. Apart from powerful skills, he was nothing at all…

“Oh right… Holy Lady, I think that I can hide in the You Ancient Clan…” Blood Moon Elder suddenly whispered to Ye Qingtang.

After hearing that, Ye Qingtang frowned slightly.

Although this was a good idea, it was too risky. If You Ancient Clan grew suspicious… the Blood Moon Elder would be in an extremely dangerous situation.

“It’s too risky,” Ye Qingtang said after contemplation.

“Holy Lady, this mainland is about to be wiped out, and I view myself as a part of this mainland. If the You Ancient Clan had their way, all living beings on this mainland would die… It is extremely dangerous no matter where we are. Instead, it is better to initiate a strike. If I conceal myself in the You Ancient Clan, at least we can obtain information on the You Ancient Clan and their next step… It is easier to fight them this way!” The Blood Moon Elder said rather agitatedly.

Looking at the Blood Moon Elder’s persistence, Ye Qingtang, however, felt like laughing.

Tracing back to when they first met, who would have thought that there would be a day where the once brutal Blood Moon Elder would actually sacrifice himself for the common people?
