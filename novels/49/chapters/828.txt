Chapter 829 The Legend of The Dragon Vein

“Didn’t you not understand wolf language?” Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger.

After hearing that, the little white tiger said, “You can guess by looking at its lowly appearance.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang did not say anything and sat on the silver wolf’s back gently.

The moment Ye Qingtang sat on the silver wolf, it stood up and immediately turned into a silver shadow. In just the blink of an eye, it disappeared completely without a trace, leaving behind an ownerless horse that looked ahead in bewilderment.

“F*ck. I never thought that this fellow’s speed would be so fast, although his skills are only so-so.” The little white tiger crouched on Ye Qingtang’s left shoulder and said after sensing the silver wolf’s speed.

Even if an ordinary Yin Yang Perfected Lord put in all his might, he might not be able to keep up with the silver wolf’s running speed.

The little white tiger pondered immediately. Could it be that the Demon God transformed this imitation for Ye Qingtang to use to escape when she encountered danger…

Ye Qingtang was extremely surprised, and she looked down at the majestic silver wolf. “Xiao Guai, you are actually so fast…”

The silver wolf howled after hearing Ye Qingtang, and its speed increased for some reason.

“Brother Ye Chen, slow down a little!”

In a while, Master Du’s voice sounded from behind.

Ye Qingtang immediately let the silver wolf decrease its speed.

She did not know the location of the Dragon Vein and still required Master Du to lead the way.

Very quickly, Master Du chased up to them and looked at the little white tiger on Ye Qingtang’s shoulder. “I really could not tell that this little animal of yours was this fast. I’m afraid that a Yin Yang Perfected Lord would also be pretty inferior when compared to it.”

Ye Qingtang, too, was extremely puzzled over Xiao Guai’s speed as she only found out about it today.

“Brother Ye Chen, do you know anything about the Dragon Vein?” Master Du changed the topic and asked Ye Qingtang.

Knowing that Ye Qingtang’s cultivation based was at a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord, Master Du thought that Ye Qingtang should have some knowledge.

After hearing Master Du’s question, Ye Qingtang was, however, in silence.

In her previous life, she did hear rumors of the Dragon Vein, but she had never gotten involved in it.

That Dragon Vein was guarded by the top three forces of this mainland: apart from Peerless School of Nine Nights Dynasty and Beiming Manor of Formidable Heavens Dynasty, there was also the most powerful evil cult on this mainland currently, the Phantom Valley.

Other than these three forces, there was no one else who dared to go near the Dragon Vein.

“I don’t know it very well.” Ye Qingtang replied honestly in the end.

Master Du did not mind it and spoke after thinking for a while. “According to the legend, before this mainland was truly formed, there was a True Dragon and Divine Phoenix above the heavens, and they battled for dozens of years in the void. In the end, it’s said that the True Dragon was severely injured and fell from the heavens. It landed here, forming the Dragon Vein.”

Ye Qingtang was not very clear of this legend and had only heard it from Master Du today.

In her previous life, she did not have any interest in the Dragon Vein and naturally would not bother with such legends.

“The True Dragon could not defeat the Divine Phoenix and was even killed by the Divine Phoenix. Old fellow, I am young. You must not lie to me.” The little white tiger stared at Master Du with an annoyed expression.

Master Du could not hold himself back from shooting the little white tiger a look after hearing it. “Everything I said is what I heard. I didn’t even see the battle back then. How would I be clear of the truth?”
