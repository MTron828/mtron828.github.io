Chapter 1106 Forbidden Formation (1)

“Ten thousand years ago, the First Domain was more powerful than even the Third Domain. However, the First Domain had a gap in its history. After the gap, the First Domain started to decline and became the most backward of the three domains in terms of martial culture,” the black-robed old man said.

“I think you had better be prepared. The Ancient You Clan is truly dominant within Central Mainland. Even the Heavenly Demon Bloodline Clan’s Domain Monarch and his kin are unwilling to provoke the Ancient You Clan… Once their Eye of Extermination appears, the entire area will become desolate. If the Ancient You Clan wishes to invade this mainland, then it will certainly be exterminated.” Yin Yang Child laughed coldly.

The Ancient You Clan’s perennial wars had extended to many of the more powerful mainlands in the First Domain, not to mention a low-level mainland like this one. Even many of the high-level mainlands in the First Domain had been exterminated and annexed by the Ancient You Clan. Now, the power of the Ancient You Clan was beyond estimation.

Rumor had it that the Ancient You Clan needed a mere half a month to exterminate a high-level mainland. To Yin Yang Child, Black and White Holy Son, and the others, if the Ancient You Clan wanted to exterminate this mainland, it would only take two or three days.

When they heard that, everyone in the Falling Sky Valley turned pale.

They had grown up in this mainland. No matter how backward it was in terms of martial culture or how low-level it was in the First Domain, it was special to them. How could they bear to see this mainland exterminated… their parents, relatives, siblings, and all their accompanying memories were tied to this mainland. They could not bear to abandon it…

But now, no matter how they wished to protect it, they were so frail in the eyes of the powerful ancient tribe of Central Mainland.

“How could this happen…” Perfected Xuanchen was slightly pale. After he learned from the powerful cultivators of Central Mainland about how powerful the Ancient You Clan was, Perfected Xuanchen was desperate.

“It is not inevitable.”

At that moment, Ye Qingtang suddenly spoke

up.

“Not inevitable?!” Yin Yang Child stared at Ye Qingtang. He lifted his brows slightly and laughed coldly. “What do you know. Do you know how powerful the Ancient You Clan is?”

Ye Qingtang flicked a glance at Yin Yang Child. This brat was asking for a good thrashing.

Fortunately, he was capable enough, and his father was fairly capable. Otherwise, his personality alone would have attracted enough enemies for him to have died a few times.

Although Yin Yang Child deserved a thrashing, at that moment, Ye Qingtang was not in the mood to chastise him.

The current situation was more urgent than beating up a brat.

“No matter how powerful the Ancient You Clan is, they are at most Yin Yang Perfected Lords in this mainland.” Ye Qingtang’s gaze swept across everyone as she succinctly pointed out the crux of the matter.

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, everyone was stunned.

Absolute Monarch of Heaven and the group of powerful cultivators from Central Mainland all looked thoughtful.

Ye Qingtang’s words gave them all an insight.

Before they came to this mainland, all of them were at least at the Arcane Supremacy stage of martial cultivation. But… once they entered this mainland, their powers were all suddenly suppressed to the level of Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

Further, this power of suppression was the strongest just after entering the mainland, and they could only achieve the Fourth Heaven of Yin Yang Perfected Lord. As time passed, the oppressive force slowly weakened, and the martial capabilities of the visitors entered the peak of Yin Yang Perfected Lord.

This also meant that no matter how strong they were, once they came to this mainland, they would at most possess the peak strength of a Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Even a god would be the same.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
