Chapter 1181: Defend (2)

“However, I am looking for you for something.” Before Ye Qingtang spoke, Ling Yan’s tone changed, and there was a rare seriousness in his tone. “Miss Ye, listen to me seriously right now…”

“I’m listening. Do you want me to save you?” Ye Qingtang responded.

“There’s no need to save me but… Miss Ye, I wish for you to leave the mainland that you are in right now and head to the Eternal Dynasty immediately,” Ling Yan said.

“Now? Go to the Eternal Dynasty?” Ye Qingtang was slightly dumbfounded.

Why did Ling Yan’s words make her increasingly confused?

One second ago, he said there was no need to rescue him, but in the next, he wanted her to head to the Eternal Dynasty immediately?

Was this not requiring any rescue? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although Ye Qingtang complained in her heart, worry crept into her heart unknowingly.

“After we chase the Ancient You Clan away, I will go look for you in the Eternal Dynasty… You are not in any danger right now, are you?” Ye Qingtang questioned carefully.

Ling Yan was Eternal Dynasty’s Third Prince after all, and the next Emperor was not set yet. The old Emperor had not died, and the Eldest Prince and Princess probably still did not dare to kill Ling Yan.

Given Ling Yan’s intellect, Ye Qingtang believed that it would be an easy feat for Ling Yan if he wished to leave the prison, and he must have his own objectives for staying in the prison.

“Miss Ye, you may be mistaken… What I mean is for you to leave the mainland that you are in immediately.”

“Immediately?” Ye Qingtang’s brows furrowed slightly. The mainland’s crisis was not resolved yet, and Ancient You Clan had a powerful army. How could she leave now?

Why was Ling Yan so urgent for her to leave…

“Miss Ye… I know you are confused, but if you believe me, you must follow what I say,” Ling Yan said again.

“I naturally believe you, but I want to know why,” Ye Qingtang said.

She trusted Ling Yan, but how could she easily abandon everything and leave when they were in a fierce war now?

This time, Ling Yan did not reply to Ye Qingtang immediately. There was a silence on the other side of the voice transmission stone.

A long time later, Ling Yan’s voice finally traveled out from the voice transmission stone. “Because you will die.”

Ye Qingtang was dumbfounded by what Ling Yan said.

She… would die…

Ye Qingtang did not have any suspicions about what Ling Yan said.

Ling Yan possessed the Karma Bloodline and had the power of karma. If Ling Yan calculated that she would die with the power of karma, then she…

Would definitely die…

“Does my death have any value to this mainland…” Ye Qingtang remained silent for a while and suddenly asked.

“If you leave, the mainland that you are in will probably be annihilated, and the Ancient You Clan would become even more powerful… If you don’t leave, this mainland may be saved… But the price is that you will die.” Ling Yan’s voice traveled from the voice transmission stone.

“It is also to say that… my death will win a chance of survival for this mainland, right?” Ye Qingtang was calm as though she did not hear the prediction that she would die.

“It should be so. The power of karma can only predict these at this stage.” Ling Yan replied.

Ye Qingtang looked down slightly. Familiar faces flashed by in her mind.

It was easy for her to leave this mainland, but what would happen to Little You Yun, Ye Family, Si Family, Xuanling Sect, and Falling Sky Valley?

Perhaps, Ye Qingtang could avoid the You Ancient Clan’s watch if she left alone discreetly, but it was almost unrealistic if Ye Qingtang wished to bring everyone with her.
