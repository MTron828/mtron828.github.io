One of the shadows was split apart by Fu Lingtian, but the Ye Qingtang reappeared in the next second. Her sight landed on Fu Lingtian, and she said, “Senior Brother Fu, seventeen more moves left… However, I thought that you said you would defeat me within three moves?”

“You…” Fu Lingtian narrowed his eyes.

The young lady from Xuanling Sect had strange moves and extraordinary speed.

“Oh…”

Elder Qin was shocked. If the first move was a coincidence, then the second and the third one… They could not be coincidences as well.

Elder Mo frowned and finally raised his eyes to look at Ye Qingtang.

As long as she did not fail miserably, Elder Mo would be satisfied.

The two figures on the Martial Art Hall shifted again.

Fu Lingtian was like a demonic beast. Every move was fierce and strong, and if normal disciples were hit by the force, they would shed one layer of skin at least. However, Ye Qingtang’s movement technique was abnormal. She avoided Fu Lingtian’s attack at the most appropriate time.

“Five!” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Six!”

…

“Ten!”

“Eleven!”

…

“Nineteen!”

Every time Ye Qingtang avoided Fu Lingtian’s move, she would remind him.

All the disciples were astonished.

“There is a disciple with such excellent movement techniques in the Xuanling Sect?”

“Does Ye Qingtang study movement techniques? She is so fast! Who can touch her?!”

“No wonder she dared to challenge Senior Brother Fu and asked him to grant her twenty moves. Even though Senior Brother Fu is strong, it is useless if he can’t touch Ye Qingtang.”

“As a Martial Art cultivator, what can you do when you only know how to escape!”

“Of course it’s helpful. In the future if you encounter any danger, at least you can run away.”

“Xuanling Sect’s disciples only know how to run?!”

Xuanling Sect disciples remained silent, though the other sects mocked them.

What was wrong with escaping? As a cultivator, what could you do if you could not even reach your opponent?

At least Ye Qingtang could last so long on the stage and would not fail miserably. That would be enough for the Xuanling Sect.

“Good!”

Elder Qin looked at Ye Qingtang with admiration. He nodded and said, “Hold on for a little while more. At least we will not fail so miserably, and we will be the sect that fought with Fu Lingtian for the longest time!”

“Good movement techniques indeed.” It was rare that Elder Mo also commended.

After nineteen moves, Fu Lingtian looked at Ye Qingtang and smiled coldly. “Junior Sister Ye, do you only know how to run away only? As a sect disciple, I think there’s nothing to be proud of when you only know how to escape.”

“Senior Brother Fu is right!”

“The ability of Xuanling Sect disciples is the worst among the three sects, but your escaping ability is definitely the first.”

“Hahaha, I’ll see how she’s going to run when she runs out of inner qi later.”

Qinglin Sect disciples laughed.

“Don’t say that. I think most of the Xuanling Sect disciples are brave men. Disciples who only know how to escape are the minority…”

“It’s normal for a girl to study escaping techniques. Anyway, the difference in the quality of the Xuanling Sect disciples is huge.”

“Haha…”

Some of the Wind Moon Sect disciples mocked.

Many Xuanling Sect disciples’ faces were red. They felt embarrassed when they met with the sarcastic sights from the other two sects’ disciples.

Fu Lingtian tilted his mouth and said, “Junior Sister Ye, how about taking one of my moves instead of running? It won’t be so unpleasant if you lose.”
