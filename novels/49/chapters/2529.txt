Chapter 2530: Karmic Divination (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang was stunned by the yellow dog’s words. When she regained her composure, her lips twitched. Did the dog say that she would want to kill herself?

How astonishing was this karmic technique? How could it produce something like that?

“Brother Canine… Your karmic technique doesn’t seem to be very good.” The Blood Moon Elder looked at the big yellow dog and smiled. He completely disregarded the big yellow dog’s words. How could there be anyone in this world who would want to kill himself?

Even the big yellow dog was baffled. “Yes, that’s right, but that’s the result of my karmic divination … What’s going on? Could it be that my divination went wrong or did not work because I was asleep for too long?”

The big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang and wagged its tail. “Little girl, is there something bothering you?”

Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. “I’ve never thought of ending my own life.”

“Then… probably there’s something wrong with my technique. Forget it, I don’t have a karma bloodline. It’s perfectly normal for me to make mistakes,” said the yellow dog.

“Let’s go. We can’t stay here for long.” In the end, Ye Qingtang sighed and completely dispelled the thought of learning about the Heart of the Heavenly Dao from the big yellow dog.

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder quickly left with the big yellow dog.

Given that one of the Sky Vault Sect’s Branch Masters had been severely injured by the big yellow dog, it was likely that the Sky Vault Sect would not let the matter rest. Also, it was unknown whether the golden-haired old man would catch up to them. It was best to leave as soon as possible.

...

Two days later, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder came to a relay station at the border to rest.

By now, Ye Qingtang had been traveling at a fast pace for the past two days. This should be a safe place and she could rest well for the time being. She would not need to be on tenterhooks here.

After eating and drinking, Ye Qingtang returned to her room and built a temporary kennel for the big yellow dog.

“I’m really not used to lying on your human bed,” the big yellow dog looked at Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog. “Where exactly are you from?”

The big yellow dog wagged its tail. “Why? Are you very curious about me?”

Ye Qingtang did not refute this point. She was indeed very curious about the big yellow dog. Ever since she met the big yellow dog at the Wailing Well, it was like a mystery. She could not figure it out nor could she understand it.

“If you were me, you would be curious too, right?” Ye Qingtang said a moment later.

The big yellow dog said, “You don’t have to think too much about where I come from. In any case, I don’t have any ulterior motives towards you. I don’t have any ulterior motives towards your lower realm either.”

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Lower realm?

What did the yellow dog mean by the lower realm? Could there be an upper realm? As a person of two lifetimes, Ye Qingtang had never heard of upper and lower realms.

“Could there really be an upper realm…” Ye Qingtang asked curiously.

The big yellow dog ignored Ye Qingtang and kept wagging its tail. Did it accidentally reveal something just now? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Unable to endure Ye Qingtang’s pestering, the big yellow dog could only nod and give Ye Qingtang a definite answer. “Alright, alright. If you really want to know, I’ll tell you.”

“I’m all ears..” Ye Qingtang nodded.
