Chapter 228: The Shadow of Death (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Because of Ye Qingtang’s appearance, Zhou Qu was beaten up, and this resulted in Zhou Xuan’s plan for revenge.

And because Zhou Xuan wanted to seek revenge on Ye Qingtang, he forcefully brought forward his mission to the time when Ye Qingtang had to accept her first sect mission so as to pull Ye Qingtang into his mission team.

If she estimated using the course of events in her previous life, the people who came to Spirit Condensation Mountain Village today would not be Lin Long and Zhou Xuan. Thus, Ye Qingtang was able to see them in the sect in her previous life!

Along with the change that Ye Qingtang brought about, the wheel of fate started to deviate a little!

After understanding this point, Ye Qingtang’s mind cleared up. However, she did not even savor this feeling as she immediately walked towards Lin Long and pulled her wrist.

Lin Long’s face turned pale, and afraid that Ye Qingtang would be infected with the Blood Plague from touching her, she quickly kept her hands back.

However…

“Senior Sister Lin, everything about Spirit Condensation Mountain Village is a trap. We must leave this place immediately!” There was a serious and stern expression on Ye Qingtang’s face.

Lin Long was shocked. Looking at the solemn Ye Qingtang, Lin Long felt that Ye Qingtang must have discovered a serious clue. “Junior Sister Ye, what do you mean by that?”

“There’s no time to explain. Senior Sister Lin, leave with me, now.” The puzzle in Ye Qingtang’s mind was resolved with Lin Long’s words, but at that very instant, she sensed the intensity of danger here. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

If they continued staying on, their lives would be in great danger.

Lin Long did not know what Ye Qingtang found, but from her instincts, she had an unknowing trust towards this young junior sister. Without saying anything much, she packed her luggage, followed Ye Qingtang out of the room, and headed to the first floor directly.

However, Zhou Xuan, who just left the room in search of food, happened to see the two anxious people at the staircase.

When Zhou Xuan saw Ye Qingtang holding onto Lin Long’s wrist, a smile flashed across his eyes.

Lin Long was already infected with the Blood Plague, and Ye Qingtang actually dared to touch Lin Long regardless of the danger. She must really find that her life was too long!

“What are you two so hurriedly off to do?” Zhou Xuan raised a brow, blocking the entrance to the stairs and looking at Ye Qingtang with a perverse expression.

Ye Qingtang looked at Zhou Xuan coldly. She had no thoughts of wasting time with this fool at this time!

“Senior Brother Zhou, please move aside,” Ye Qingtang said coldly.

Zhou Xuan, however, did not have any intention of moving away as he said without fear, “Is this the tone you should have when talking to a senior brother? Ye Qingtang, you…”

Zhou Xuan still wanted to say something, but Ye Qingtang simply did not have the energy to bother with it. She immediately released her hand which held Lin Long and used it to slap Zhou Xuan.

In just a moment’s time, Zhou Xuan had goosebumps all over!

Lin Long was infected with the Blood Plague, and Ye Qingtang actually dared to use the hand which touched Lin Long to hit him!

Zhou Xuan’s face changed drastically as he frantically searched for something on his body while Ye Qingtang used this time to pull Lin Long down the stairs.

Zhou Xuan took a bottle of elixir out and hurriedly poured everything into his mouth.

That was an elixir which could cure all diseases. He spent a large number of Xuanming points to exchange for it and was the reason why he dared to stay here. He only had this one elixir and apart from himself, he would not give anyone else!

After consuming the elixir, Zhou Xuan immediately recalled Ye Qingtang’s rude behavior just now, and his face darkened. Then, he dashed down the stairs, wanting to settle scores with Ye Qingtang.
