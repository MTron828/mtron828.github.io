Yun Chen wasn’t anxious. He merely took a seat, his gaze riveting on the unconscious Jing Ze.

Nangong Lie was acquainted with Yun Chen and once he noticed Yun Chen was looking at Jing Ze, he asked, “Do you know what happened to Jing Ze?”

Yun Chen shook his head.

“His bloodline was awakened just now.”

Surprise flashed across Yun Chen’s gentle eyes. He hadn’t expected Jing Ze to have a bloodline.

Realization dawned on his features as Yun Chen finally figured out everything. With Nangong Lie’s personality, he couldn’t possibly return to a teacher whom he disliked if nothing special happened.

Not only that, Nangong Lie had even dragged him over too.

Yun Chen couldn’t help but look at Ye Qingtang with a speculative gaze.

Time passed and Nangong Lie sat in a corner lazily. Lei Yan and Qin Feng were nowhere to be seen. He couldn’t help but comment, “Boss, you’re putting Lei Yan on the spot by getting him to bring Qin Feng to us.”

“Why?” Ye Qingtang was perplexed.

“Do you not know that Lei Yan is incapable but has an ill temper? He was extremely arrogant when he first came to the academy and even had a conflict with Qin Feng. His lackeys ended up suffering a beating from Qin Feng.” Nangong Lie wasted no time in exposing Lei Yan completely.

After that incident, Lei Yan was somewhat fearful of Qin Feng. Even when Qin Feng became less powerful, Lei Yan remained fearful.

Ye Qingtang had never known about the bad blood between them. However, she wasn’t surprised at all after thinking about Lei Yan’s temper.

That was exactly what he would do.

“Nangong Lie, what nonsense are you talking about!” Right after Nangong Lie said all of that, Lei Yan shouted over and his voice was heard in the classroom.

Lei Yan hadn’t expected Nangong Lie to start exposing everything about him right after he stepped away.

Qin Feng stood behind Lei Yan, without any expression on his face. He scanned the classroom with a poker face on.

“Boss, I brought Qin Feng over. Don’t listen to Nangong Lie’s nonsense,” Lei Yan defended himself.

Ye Qingtang nodded and her gaze fell on Qingtang.

Their eyes met.

“Anything I can help you with?”

“I invited the two of you over because I wanted to know if you’re willing to be taught by me.”

Qin Feng didn’t say anything while Yun Chen also remained silent. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It was obvious that they weren’t convinced a Paragon Sixth Heaven level teacher would be able to teach them much.

After all...

Qin Feng remained at Paragon Eighth Heaven level even after he regressed, that’s two levels higher than Ye Qingtang.

“If there’s nothing else, I’ll head back first.” Qin Feng wasn’t planning to say anything more to this lowly skilled teacher. He turned around to leave.

When Lei Yan saw Qin Feng turn around to leave, he panicked.

Don’t!

He had to do so much to drag him over.

“Qin Feng, you’re leaving just like that? Boss hasn’t finished talking yet...”

Before Lei Yan could finish talking, Qin Feng shot a baleful glare that made Lei Yan shudder. Fear consumed him.

F*ck, his gaze was intimidating.

“Hold on,” Ye Qingtang suddenly said.

Qin Feng paused, looking at Ye Qingtang without any expression.
