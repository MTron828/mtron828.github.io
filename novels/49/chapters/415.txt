Chapter 416: Oddity (4)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The official competition would begin the next day. The disciples from the three sects were led to their temporary area of residence by the Drifting Cloud Island’s servants.

In this trip, Ye Qingtang was the only female disciple from Xuanling Sect, and thus she was individually allocated to a room. The islanders of Drifting Cloud Island provided meals for the disciples on time. Time ticked by, and the day darkened. Ye Qingtang had just finished washing up and was ready to sleep, but there was suddenly a knock on her door.

Opening the door, she was greeted by the Blood Moon Sect Elder.

“I saw Fu Lingtian from Qinglin Sect leaving his room just now. He went out alone. This is a chance. How about we follow him and take a look?” The Blood Moon Sect Elder asked quietly.

Fu Lingtian was always with the other Qinglin Sect disciples throughout the day, and the Blood Moon Sect Elder could not find a suitable opportunity to interact with him one-on-one despite tailing him for a long time. Now that he saw Fu Lingtian leaving his room by himself, the thought immediately stroke him.

Ye Qingtang looked speechlessly at the Blood Moon Sect Elder, who was burning with eagerness. Looking up at the night sky, she eventually nodded in agreement.

It was already dark then, and the competition would begin tomorrow. After days of journeying, the sects’ disciples had already slept to recuperate and build up their energy in preparation for the big match the following day.

When Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Sect Elder left the room, the island was dead silent, and not a single soul was in sight.

“Are you certain that you saw Fu Lingtian leave his room alone?” Seeing the empty surroundings, she looked at the Blood Moon Sect Elder rather distrustfully.

“Believe me this time. I really saw it. He headed to the east of the island.” The Blood Moon Sect Elder almost pointed to the sky and swore.

Ye Qingtang headed to the east of Drifting Cloud Island along with the Blood Moon Sect Elder doubtfully.

When they reached a forest in the east side, they saw Fu Lingtian, who was walking along the island’s borders alone.

In the dark night, Fu Lingtian stood at the borders of Drifting Cloud Island by himself. He looked up at the sky, seeming to be looking at the stars that dotted the sky.

“I told you I wasn’t lying. Wait here, I’ll go and test him now.” Joy filled the Blood Moon Sect Elder when he caught sight of Fu Lingtian, and he immediately wanted to test the waters.

But just as the Blood Moon Sect Elder was about to walk up, a wild gust of wind suddenly blew from the sky. Ye Qingtang looked towards the sky instinctively, where an enormous shadow emerged in the air and floated towards where Fu Lingtian was.

Almost instantly, Ye Qingtang pulled the Blood Moon Sect Elder back and hid in the forest.

“Someone’s there,” Ye Qingtang said in a hushed voice. She could astutely sense a powerful aura mixed in that gust of strong wind.

The Blood Moon Sect Elder did not dare to step up and decisively hid in the forest with Ye Qingtang.

As they hid themselves, a giant figure wrapped in light neared Drifting Cloud Island rapidly.

When the light was near the borders of Drifting Cloud Island, Ye Qingtang finally had a clear look of what that was!

It was a huge Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix. Its feathers were the color of fire as though there were balls of flames gathered on it, while its huge frame was like a cloud that cast a large patch of shadows on the borders of Drifting Cloud Island, covering the stars and the moon.

“Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix? Why would this high-level spirit animal appear here?” Ye Qingtang frowned slightly. Shifting her gaze a little, she realized there were actually two people standing on the back of the Nine-Tailed Spirit Phoenix.
