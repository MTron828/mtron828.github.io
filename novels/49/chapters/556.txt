Chapter 557 We Will Meet Again Some Day (2)

“Alright! Take care, everyone!” Ye Qingtang nodded. She was aware of it as well. Although there was a huge difference between today’s battle and what she imagined, at least the outcome was still not that bad and Xuanling Sect was temporarily saved.

After sensing that the powerful aura of the three super sects was nearing, Ye Qingtang bade Elder Mo and everyone else goodbye before disappearing along with the Blood Moon Elder.

Currently, Xuanling Sect was protected by the divine power of the Blood Moon Holy Lord and was extremely safe. Thus, there was no need to worry.

On the contrary, Ye Qingtang offended Yunxiao Sect completely.

All of this, though, was Ye Qingtang’s plan. Back when Xuanling Sect had no other ways to survive, Ye Qingtang could only use herself to attract Yunxiao Sect’s grudge. Although it might not have worked, this method was all she could think of initially.

However, Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder did not go far away. They held their breaths and observed in a hidden corner.

In just a while, the three super sects returned.

Hundreds of people stood in the air above Xuanling Sect and scanned the surroundings.

“Eh… Where’s the Ultimate Elder…” Yuehua Sect’s Sect Master was puzzled.

After leaving just now, he suddenly felt the Ultimate Elder’s aura and knew that the Ultimate Elder was attracted over because of the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s appearance.

Although the Blood Moon Holy Lord was extremely powerful and unrivaled, the Ultimate Elder could pin him down. Thus, they longer had anything to be afraid of.

After returning, everyone realized that the Blood Moon Sect members and Blood Moon Holy Lord had already disappeared. There was no trace of even the Ultimate Elder.

“Mhm… It must be that after the Ultimate Elder appeared, he was locked in a battle with the Blood Moon Holy Lord. For powerful figures of that level, a battle would extend for thousands of miles. I guess we don’t even know where they’ve battled to now,” the Lingyun Sect Master opined after a deep thought.

“Ah… I never thought that the Blood Moon Holy Lord who has disappeared for a thousand years would suddenly appear. Even the Ultimate Elder appeared as well… Today is really…” The Yuehua Sect Master sighed.

However, the Yunxiao Sect elders including Li Chenfeng did not look too good. That Blood Moon Holy Lord inflicted heavy injuries to their Yunxiao Sect’s divine beast with just a strike, and the divine beast was still unconscious now.

Originally, from Yunxiao Sect’s calculation, annihilating Xuanling Sect could be easily done.

However, unexpectedly, not only was Xuanling Sect not annihilated, Yunxiao Sect suffered heavy losses instead!

“Xuanling Sect?”

Very quickly, the Lingyun Sect Master looked at the barrier protecting Xuanling Sect and could not help but comment. “Xuanling Sect’s heritage is indeed pretty powerful. The power of this barrier is extremely frightening, and there’s simply no way of breaking it…” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Haha, I still heard that the Xuanling Patriarch appeared earlier. We had been belittling Xuanling Sect all this while,” Yuehua Sect Master said as well.

The three sects were unaware that the place was enshrouded in the Blood Moon Holy Lord’s divine power and merely thought that Xuanling Sect’s heritage was profound.

The Yuehua Sect Master’s switched the conversation to another subject quickly and looked at Li Chenfeng. “Why did you, Yunxiao Sect, come to annihilate Xuanling Sect for no reason?

The other two sects heard rumors that Yunxiao Sect wanted to annihilate Xuanling Sect and were a little curious. After all, Xuanling Sect was only an ordinary sect. What reason would Yunxiao Sect exterminate it for?

It was, however, that they did not pay much attention to this matter and came here today only because of Blood Moon Sect’s appearance.

Nonetheless, since they were there, they might as well voice their questions.

After hearing that, Li Chenfeng and the other Yunxiao Sect elders frowned instantly, and rather abnormal expressions appeared on their faces.
