Chapter 2103: Floating Island (3)

Bored, she looked at the winged child as he tried again and again with stubborn determination. His eyes were rimmed with red and his nose was red as well as he choked back his sobs.

Ye Qingtang’s lips twitched a little.

How long was this silly one going to try for?

“You’re not going to succeed this way even if you try a thousand times,” she said with a sigh.

The little winged child who was deep in concentration was startled by her voice. He turned to look at her as his wings shook gently and he landed in front of her.

“What do you mean? Why won’t I succeed?” The little winged child frowned and looked at her with red, panic-filled eyes.

“Nothing. I’m just speaking the truth.” Ye Qingtang found it strange and was wondering where he had learned techniques that made her head hurt to look at.

“You... you...” Her words sent the little winged child into a panic as his eyes filled with tears.

Ye Qingtang felt like...

How had she suddenly become a bully?

“You want to gather your energy?” She was afraid that he was really going to start crying and quickly changed the topic. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The little winged child nodded.

“Are you using your dantian to do it?” she asked.

He nodded again.

“That’s wrong,” she said with a soft sigh.

“Wrong? What do you mean?” The little winged child looked at her in confusion.

“While humans and winged people are very similar, they’re not the same. While humans can use the dantian to gather their energy, this method isn’t as suitable for you winged people.” There had been a difference in cultivation in the early years.

The alien races had started cultivating later than the humans, which was why many of their techniques were borrowed from the humans. But as she had said, not all the methods that humans used were suitable for all the alien races.

“Try shifting the energy to the center of your chest,” she suggested.

The little winged child looked at her in doubt, not fully believing her words. But he remembered that Elder Hua had brought her here and decided to try it out.

And it made his eyes light up immediately.

“I... I can gather my energy!” His words were filled with joy.

“There’s nothing wrong with my aura. I... I succeeded!” The little winged man could feel the dense energy concentrated in the center of his chest, and it was cleaner than all his attempts previously!

Infected with his apparent joy, she pointed to her chest and said, “The origin of the winged people is in the center of their chest, which is where you should gather your energy. The dantian is the origin of humans. When you have a different origin, the place you gather your energy will be different too. Even though you winged people have a dantian, gathering your energy there isn’t suitable.”

“I know. The wardens have told me before that for winged people, we can switch and cultivate from the center of our chest after gathering our energy. But this is my first time hearing that we could gather energy there!” The little winged child looked at her in joy.

Gathering energy was the most basic foundation for the winged people but was also the thing they had the most trouble with.
