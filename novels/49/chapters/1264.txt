Chapter 1265: To Try To Gain An Advantage Only To End Up Worse Off (3)

The Luo Family members had absolute faith in Luo Qufeng’s skills, and with his technique to absorb cultivation base, they were very certain that the plot today would succeed and that the Luo Family was going to ascend to a superior position in the Central Mainland.

But no one would have expected…

Things would turn out this way.

Luo Feng’s expression was extremely ugly at this point.

He never thought that Luo Qufeng would be defeated, but now, Luo Qufeng was clearly not Ye Qingtang’s opponent, and if Luo Qufeng was defeated…

The Luo Family would be in trouble…

The guests present today were from various influential forces, and they probably would not let the Luo Family off easily in the future.

“Go.” Luo Feng gritted his teeth silently.

Luo Qi was slightly dumbfounded, but he realized the current situation very quickly.

Then, the senior members of the Luo Family hurriedly escaped without a sound just as everyone’s gaze was focused on Luo Qufeng and Ye Qingtang.

Luo Qufeng screamed non-stop in the entrapment of the black flame. If it was in the past, Ye Qingtang’s black flame would not be able to harm him at all, but now…

He was merely a useless person without any cultivation base.

In no time, Luo Qufeng’s shrills faded from everyone’s ears, and only a burnt, charred corpse was left in the blazing flame.

Luo Qufeng’s scheme was destroyed eventually.

Everyone gasped as they looked at the burnt corpse.

“Thank you, Holy Lord of Shadows.”

“We will never forget your grace, Holy Lord.” The guests finally sighed in relief and hurriedly rushed forward to thank Ye Qingtang.

They never expected Luo Qufeng’s skills to be so powerful. Had Ye Qingtang not made a move, all of them would probably lose their lives here.

With a faint smile, Ye Qingtang swept a look across everyone without saying anything. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

If not for the Holy Lord of Shadows’s image, she would already have dragged this group of people who hid behind her out and gave them a beating.

If the Heavenly Demon Devouring Bloodline was not stimulated, she would definitely be dead just now.

“Thank you for stepping up to help us today, senior.” Hong Zhong immediately thanked Ye Qingtang respectfully after keeping his life with a stroke of luck.

“Senior, your skills are indeed no less than before. Hong and I admire you a lot. It is all thanks to you today. If I can be of help in any areas in the future, I, Suo Mu, am willing to be at your service.” Suo Mu stepped forward to express his gratitude first.

It must be known that if Luo Qufeng did not court death by finding trouble for Ye Qingtang, he and Hong Zhong would have had their cultivation base sucked away completely.

If the cultivation base that they obtained after thousands of years of cultivation was lost, that feeling would be more terrible than death.

Ye Qingtang could not help but feel rather amused when she watched the two renowned figures of the Central Mainland thank her.

“Everyone, the Luo Family members took the opportunity to escape when we were not paying attention just now.” Someone who wanted to come after the Luo Family after Luo Qufeng died realized suddenly.

The senior members of the Luo Family had already fled away without a trace, and only the small fries who did not really understand today’s situation were left behind.

“Do they think that it is over once they run away? How can today’s incident be over so easily?” The people were still in a state of shock over everything today. Now that they emerged safely out of danger, they naturally resented the entire Luo Family to the core.

Unable to find anyone to vent their anger, the masses simply set fire to the Luo Residence. It was only after watching the tall and lofty pavilions burn in flames did the flames in their heart quell slightly.
