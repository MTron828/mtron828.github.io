Chapter 863 World as the Chessboard, Human as the Chess Pieces

“How would I dislike you when I have just reached this unfamiliar land? I’m still afraid that I can’t get closer to the three of you.” Ye Qingtang stared at Feng Wudang in confusion and asked.

“Haha, Senior Sister Ye, I was oversensitive. In this case, come along with us,” Feng Wudang said.

“That’s right, Senior Sister Ye. It’s very dangerous in the Dragon Vein. Furthermore, our martial abilities are suppressed at the Yin Yang Perfected Lord level and not even recovered to the Yang Lord level. It will be easier for us to discuss together if we encounter any problem.” Li Bingxue smiled sweetly towards Ye Qingtang.

“Alright, since you say so, it would be inappropriate for me to refuse.” Ye Qingtang smiled slightly and took a glance at a distant place.

At the same time at the distant place.

Ling Yan sat beside the chessboard and closed his eyes to take a rest.

“Your Highness, the President of the Supreme Academy had sided with the Crown Prince… The Crown Prince wanted to eliminate you at all cost. Why did you ask Lady Ye to disguise as a student of the Supreme Academy?” The midget frowned and asked. He removed his black robe to reveal his true identity as he stared at Ling Yan.

Though Ling Yan had never made any mistakes in everything he did, the midget still felt curious.

Soon, Ling Yan opened his eyes slowly. His eyes seemed to be able to see through everything in the world.

“The Supreme Academy is not a threat to me anymore,” he said slowly.

“Not a threat anymore?”

The midget was stunned for a second after hearing Ling Yan’s words. He did not understand what he meant.

However, since Ling Yan did not explain himself, he would not ask for the answer as well.

The midget looked at the wound that was pierced through by the sword and said, “Your Highness… your injury…”

The midget could not believe what he saw when Ling Yan warded off the sword for Ye Qingtang. How would he ward off the sword for someone based on his temper!

“Lady Ye… She is my first important friend,” Ling Yan said softly. A harmless smile was seen on his friend.

“Friend…”

The midget stared at Ling Yan in surprise.

Ling Yan treated the world as a chessboard and the human as a chess piece. The midget could never imagine that someone like him would treat a human as a friend.

He would never believe it if he did not hear it with his own ears.

Soon, Ling Yan took out a black chess piece from the chessboard.

Boom. The chess piece broke into powder and dispersed alongside the wind.

“Ha, based on my older brother and the Perfected Gu Yun’s suspicious personalities, the Supreme Academy is gone now,” Ling Yan said, and a faint smile appeared on his face.

Perfected Gu Yun, who was addressed by Ling Yan as teacher, was standing on top of a cliff. His face was extremely dark.

He had never imagined that the fated person that Ling Yan insisted to look for on this piece of land would be a student of the Supreme Academy. A special student who held the Supreme Token!

There were only a few special students in every batch, and they were managed by the President of the Supreme Academy personally!

Perfected Gu Yun did not totally believe it when he was observing secretly at first. However, his doubt was erased when he saw Ling Yan ward off the sword for the lady.

The Supreme Academy’s special student with the Supreme Token, who was managed by the President, was definitely the fated person of Ling Yan!

If not, why would Ling Yan come to this piece of land and protected her from the sword regardless of his own safety!

“Supreme President, you appeared to be siding towards the Crown Prince, but secretly…” Perfected Gu Yun gnashed his teeth and murmured.

If the midget heard the Perfected Gu Yun’s words now, he would understand what Ling Yan meant by ‘the Supreme Academy is gone’.
