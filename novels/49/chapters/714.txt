Chapter 715: The Silver Wolf (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

In the first place, Ye Qingtang did not expect the little white tiger to cooperate. She stopped asking and hugged the indifferent silver wolf tightly. She smiled and touched its smooth fur.

The little white tiger was left aside by Ye Qingtang. Her eyes were totally fixed on her regained silver wolf.

After a short while, the little white tiger took a glimpse at the silver wolf. A cold glint flashed across its eyes.

The silver wolf was more serious as it saw the little white tiger’s cold sight.

“Come here, let me introduce you guys to each other.” Ye Qingtang held the little white tiger’s front paw and pulled it in front of the silver wolf.

“This is my first spirit pet… but it was lost previously. Be kind to each other in the future,” Ye Qingtang said seriously.

“Be kind? I’m not interested.” The little white tiger glanced at the silver wolf.

Under the silver wolf’s threatening sight, the little white tiger totally ignored the situation and yawned. “What spirit pet… I think you should stay away from it. It has an ‘anti-wife’ look. Nothing good will happen to you when you bring it alone.”

Both the silver wolf and Ye Qingtang were stunned as the little white tiger finished its words.

“Anti-wife?” Ye Qingtang frowned.

“Anti-owner.” The little white tiger contemplated for a while and changed its words.

“…” Ye Qingtang stared blankly at the little white tiger.

“Look at its lustful face.” The little white tiger sat in front of Ye Qingtang and stared at the silver wolf directly.

The silver wolf stared back at the little white tiger, and cold glints flickered in its eyes.

“How could you see that… I thought that you didn’t understand wolves?” Ye Qingtang was curious.

“F*ck you, I’m not a wolf, but I’m a beast… All wolves are lustful. I think you should chase it away. Is it not enough to have me alone?” the little white tiger said.

“Are you jealous?” Ye Qingtang smiled and stared at the little white tiger with interest.

“Your choice.” The little white tiger shook its head.

“There’s no time to talk anymore.” Ye Qingtang did not bother to talk to the little white tiger. Golden flames emerged from her palm and burned Chu Yi’s and another Tiangang Sect disciple’s bodies. She then brought the little white tiger and the silver wolf towards the Falling Sky Valley.

She was outside a huge mountain valley after half a day.

The mountain valley was surrounded by stretches of mountains. Each peak was a sub-valley of the Falling Sky Valley.

The rules of recruiting disciples in the Falling Sky Valley were very strict. Normal people might not be able to climb onto any peak, not to mention cultivating in the Falling Sky Valley.

“The two of you wait for me here. Don’t move around. I’ll be back soon.” Ye Qingtang looked at the little white tiger and the silver wolf and said seriously.

Ye Qingtang was afraid that once she left, her Xiao Guai would disappear again.

It was not very appropriate to bring two spirit pets along on the first visit to the Falling Sky Valley. It would need the Falling Sky Valley’s approval. Even those renowned tamers had to leave their spirit animals outside.

After Ye Qingtang left, the silver wolf’s cold and ghostly eyes landed on the little white tiger.

“Hehe… Do you know what the most painful thing in this world is?” The little white tiger yawned and smiled at the silver wolf.

The silver wolf was expressionless and did not seem to be interested enough to reply.

The little white tiger smiled again and said, “The most painful thing is knowing the truth before others, and no one understands… The more you know, the cleverer you are than the rest, and the lonelier you will be. Am I correct, Demon God of the Earth?”𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com
