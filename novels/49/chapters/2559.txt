Fortunately, nothing had happened to Long Yao and the rest, or the consequences would have been unimaginable.

“That child Long Yao is too bold and presumptuous. Now that she has returned, we should watch her closely. It’s best not to let her act too wilfully,” Long Yun said with a frown.

The black-robed elder chuckled softly. “It’s alright. Long Xiao is by Long Yao’s side. You know very well that although Long Xiao looks like a gentle and kind child, he is treacherous to the bone. He is ruthless and has a dark heart. He is unlike Long Yao, who is still so naive at her age. It’s disappointing, she really has to learn from her brother, Long Xiao.”

Long Yun shook his head and smiled. “That’s true. Among the Dragon Emperor Clan, only Long Yao has a childish heart and a strangely kind heart.”

“Let the children do whatever they want. If they find my Jiu’er, I will remember their great contribution. Actually, I don’t have much hope either. After all, Jiu’er has been missing for so many years. If she wanted to come back, she would have done so long ago. It’s just that I’ve troubled the Evil Deity for so many years with my longing for Jiu’er.” The black-robed elder sighed.

Before Long Yun could say anything, the black-robed elder changed the topic. “Also, Long Yao came back and said that those ignorant idiots from the Ten Thousand Poison Valley wanted to bully her. When the time comes, they will go and teach them a lesson. If their Valley Master had not saved Jiu’er’s life several times in the past, I would not have allowed them to exist until today.”

“Ten Thousand Poison Valley… they are truly audacious. All these years that the Evil Deity has been in seclusion, the Ten Thousand Poison Valley has taken advantage of this. It looks like we should punish them properly,” Long Yun said.

“If there’s nothing else, you can leave first.” The black-robed elder’s voice seemed to be a little tired.

“One more thing,” Long Yun said.

“Speak.” The black-robed elder looked at Long Yun.

“On my way to find traces of the Immortal Emperor, I met a woman and brought her back. I had her come as a guest and arranged for her to be in the guest area.” Long Yun’s expression was solemn.

A curious glint appeared in the black-robed elder’s eyes.

How many years had it been since anyone was qualified to enter the guest area of the Dragon Emperor Clan? The black-robed elder had no idea what Long Yun’s intentions were.

“Is there anything about that woman that makes you, Long Yun, treat her in such a special manner?” The black-robed elder asked.

“That woman’s appearance,” Long Yun said. “Did you know that our Jiu’er looks like a certain big shot in the Mixed Heavens Holy Domain?”

“The Temple of Paragon’s… Paragon?” The black-robed elder said.

“That’s right.” Long Yun nodded slightly. “In the past, the Temple of Paragon ruled the entire Mixed Heavens Holy Domain and was worshipped everywhere. I once saw their Paragon, and the memory is still fresh in my mind. At that time, I nearly mistook the Paragon for Jiu’er. However, upon closer inspection, Jiu’er’s appearance is only similar to the Paragon. They are not exactly the same.”

“What does this have to do with the woman you brought back?” The black-robed elder asked.

“When I saw that woman for the first time, I nearly mistook her for the younger version of Jiu’er…” Long Yun replied truthfully.

“Long Yun, do you mean that the woman you brought back looks very similar to the Temple of Paragon’s Paragon?” the black-robed elder asked.

However, Long Yun shook his head. They were not just similar.

They were completely identical.
