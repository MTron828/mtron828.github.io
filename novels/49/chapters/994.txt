Chapter 995 Ability (1)

If Ye Qingtang did not have a Dharma treasure that she had obtained by chance, how could she force the Duan Family to a state where they could not even fight back?

The fact that Ye Qingtang had been so open-handed and given away these numerous treasures so freely showed that she did not care about them. She must certainly have some rare treasures on her person!

The senior members of the Ye Family were not stupid. When they heard the Long Family Master’s words, they more or less guessed what he meant. Besides the treasures that Ye Qingtang had given the Ye Family, the Long Family Master also wanted the treasure on Ye Qingtang’s person.

“Ye Qingtang, hadn’t you better bring out the treasure you are carrying!” said a senior member of the Ye Family as he looked at Ye Qingtang.

However, Ye Qingtang just shrugged. “Who told you that I am carrying treasure?”

“You aren’t?”

When they heard Ye Qingtang’s words, all the senior members of the Ye Family frowned deeply.

How could it be that Ye Qingtang was not carrying any treasure!

In that case, how could Ye Qingtang have brought out so many premium yellow-grade divine weapons and rare elixirs without batting an eyelid?!

“Ye Qingtang, this is the Long Family’s Master and a half-step Yin Yang Perfected Lord. Your treasure is wasted on you. You had better hand it over to Lord Long. With Lord Long’s abilities, he will be better able to protect Lin Town with these treasures!”

“That’s right. In that way, you will also be making a contribution to the Ye Family and Lin Town. As the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family, you should at least be aware of some of these things!”

At that moment, all the senior members of the Ye Family were hoping to save their own skins and were all speaking rapidly.

However, although they said all these things, Ye Qingtang remained completely unmoved. She showed no sign of bringing out any treasure.

This situation caused the senior members of the Ye Family to frown.

“Ye Qingtang, you say that you are not carrying any Dharma treasure… In that case, hand over your space ring,” a senior member of the Ye Family said coldly.

Ye Qingtang had brought this disaster on them. If she had not been so blatantly arrogant and used the Dharma treasure to defeat the Duan Family, all of this would not have happened. She was merely an outer sect disciple, but her arrogant attitude was akin to that of an inner sect disciple of a super sect!

She had no sense of her own little worth and had forgotten herself when she had obtained a few Dharma treasures by chance, bringing catastrophe to the Ye Family. Now, she was still refusing to hand the Dharma treasure over!

“Ye Qingtang, hadn’t you better take out your space ring!” When he saw that Ye Qingtang did not reply, the senior member of the Ye Family was enraged.

Given the current circumstances, even the Ye Family Master had to comply, much less the Eldest Young Lady of the Ye Family!

When Ye Qingtang looked at the scene before her, she understood why the Ye Family had been so oppressed. Firstly, the Duan Family had the backing of the Long Family. Secondly, these people that her father and second uncle had brought back to the Ye House did not dare to oppose the Long Family, causing them to be repeatedly bullied.

Deep in her heart, Ye Qingtang knew that although her father was the family master, he was too mild and was even inclined to be weak. Given his personality, he could not control these people in the Ye Family; otherwise, he would not have allowed Ye You’s grandfather to control the Ye Family in the first place.

“Are you talking about this?” Ye Qingtang immediately waved the space ring on her finger.

“That’s right!” the senior member of the Ye Family said impatiently.

“If you want it, come and get it yourself.” Ye Qingtang looked at the senior member of the Ye Family, and a cold light flashed across her eyes. There were many parasites in the Ye Family. If her father did not get rid of them, she would have to do it for him.
