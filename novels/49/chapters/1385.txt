1386 Exposing the Fraud 4

The moment the little white tiger was thrown out, its tiny body suddenly enlarged by ten times. It seemed that the whole palace could not fit its body anymore.

When its paw landed on the floor, the whole ground was trembling.

Everyone in the palace could not stand straight when they saw the white tiger’s size increase exponentially.

What kind of divine beast is this!!

The tiger’s roar pierced through everyone’s ears. It dashed towards the delicate jade door and used its paw to smash through the door.

A skinny white-robed elder with a long beard was about to escape from the secret path in fear. The white tiger smashed the person towards Ye Qingtang with its paw…

The white tiger did not use any strength, but the power of a Fiendcelestial Beast was not bearable for a normal human being. The elder with a long beard landed in front of Ye Qingtang. He spitted out a mouthful of blood as he was almost killed under the white tiger’s paw.

The elder with a long beard was the only one inside the jade door.

It was obvious that he was the “Immortal” that was speaking inside. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

In the past pilgrimage days of the Dragon Court Sect, the “Immortal” sometimes came out as well. He always dressed in a white robe. With his washed-up expression and the white beard, he appeared to be a real Immortal under his disguise.

However…

The superior, divine, and majestic “Immortal” collapsed on the ground now with blood by his mouth.

“A person like you also dares to call yourself an Immortal?” Ye Qingtang looked down at the skinny “Immortal”, and a smile appeared by her lips.

The “Immortal” was pale, and there was no Immortal manner left on him at all. His body was trembling and full of sweat after he took a glimpse at Ye Qingtang.

“I’ve sinned. I should have never pretended to be an Immortal. I should have never challenged the dignity of the Immortal. Please spare my life.” The “Immortal” there was really terrified. After he took over the control of the Dragon Court Sect, he always used different deceptive ploys to trick people. When he heard about the Immortal in the Yuan Kingdom, he wanted to eliminate the person as he thought that Immortal was just a quack like himself.

But he could never imagine that he would meet a real Immortal!

An Immortal could see through his disguise immediately.

He did not dare to find any excuses as he stared at the ashes on the floor.

Everyone was stunned after hearing what the “Immortal” said.

Emperors from different kingdoms opened their eyes wide in disbelief as they had worshiped the Dragon Court Sect for many years. Their eyes were almost going to pop out when they saw the elder kneeling and kowtowing in front of Ye Qingtang.

The… the Immortal is a quack?!

“You… you’re a fake Immortal? Then… what about coming back to life…” Emperor Qi’s eyes were opened wide, and he asked in disbelief.

“I’m a quack. I don’t know how to make people come back to life. That was just a ploy that I set up earlier…” The elder did not dare to lie in front of Ye Qingtang.

“Then how about the Dragon Court Sect…”

“Everything… everything is fake. I just want to trick you to worship us and provide us with tributes…” The elder revealed the truth.

Dragon Court Sect started with a few people knowing how to set up certain tricks, but they did not expect that all the kingdoms believed in their tricks. They were greedy after seeing the tributes and carried on their tricks to gain people’s trust and worship.

The annual pilgrimage day was just for them to strengthen their position in people’s minds. The Immortal skills were all just some deceptive ploys.
