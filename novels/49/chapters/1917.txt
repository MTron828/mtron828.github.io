Chapter 1918: The Spirit of Chaos (3)

“...” Ye Qingtang was speechless.

The Holy Lord of Shadows’ steed? Why had she never heard of this before?

Ming Wang frowned when he heard Ming Di’s name.

“You cannot,” he said simply.

“Why not?”

The Clan Elders were confused. Why couldn’t the Holy Lord of Shadows send her steed if she didn’t want to deal with it herself?

“Ming Di was sealed thousands of years ago by the Holy Lord.”

Everyone started talking among themselves.

No wonder they hadn’t seen Ming Di in the battle with the Second Domain many years ago. It turned out it had been sealed away by the Holy Lord of Shadows.

The gazes towards Ye Qingtang grew more intense. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Ming Di had arrived in the Central Mainland at the same time as the Holy Lord of Shadows. When it had first appeared, it’s mere presence had been terrifying, with no one able to defeat it. It was rumored that Ming Di’s strength was on par with the Holy Lord of Shadows’.

Such powerful steeds should be treated with the utmost care in any ancient clan.

Yet the Holy Lord of Shadows had sealed away such a strong being?

It was really...

So vulgar!

Ye Qingtang had no words. She didn’t even know what or who Ming Di was.

“Everyone, I will consider what you have said. Let me think about it in the Temple of Shadows for a day.” If this continued, Ye Qingtang was afraid that the clan elders would force her to do something impossible and make use of this opportunity to take control of the situation.

While they had not gotten any confirmation from Ye Qingtang, they still held out hope since she had not rejected them outright, which meant that they wouldn’t give her any grief today. With further room for discussion, they would back off for now.

But Ye Qingtang’s heart was in a mess. Based on what she could gather from the ancient clans’ words, they were absolutely no match for the youth at all. The situation would probably pan out like what they predicted if this dragged on.

Ye Qingtang returned to her room while still pondering the issue at hand. Suddenly, as though she had suddenly recalled something, she took out the voice transmission stone, which she hadn’t used for a long time.

The voice transmission stone had lost its use after she had entered the cursed mystic realm, and she had subsequently forgotten about it. As she stared at the voice transmission stone, she decided to try contacting something.

“Ling Yan.”

The voice transmission stone was quiet for a long time. Just as she thought it was already broken, the voice that she hadn’t heard in a while rang out.

“Miss Ye, are you finally missing me?”

Ye Qingtang was speechless.

“It’s been a while since I’ve seen Miss Ye. I thought that you had completely forgotten about me.” Ling Yan’s voice was laced with laughter.

“Stop fooling around, I’ve met with some trouble. It’s a long story, but there’s something important I need to ask you.” Ye Qingtang felt that Ling Yan probably understood the Temple of Shadows more than anyone else.

“Hm? What would Miss Ye like to ask?” Ling Yan’s voice was lazy.

“Did you know that the Holy Lord of Shadows had a steed? ” Ye Qingtang was already thinking about the steed. If it was as strong as the ancient clan elders had said, she might be able to make use of it.

“You’re talking about Ming Di.”

“Yes! So you do know it,” Ye Qingtang said in glee.

“If it’s something Miss Ye wishes to know, I will work hard to make sure I can answer your question even if I didn’t know the answer.”

What could she say to that? Couldn’t he be more serious?

“What do you know about Ming Di?”
