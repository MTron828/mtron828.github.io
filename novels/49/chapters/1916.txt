Chapter 1917: The Spirit of Chaos (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Holy Lord of Shadows, even if you don’t care about the mainland, you need to think of the Temple of Shadows.” Seeing that Ye Qingtang seemed to have no intention of intervening, a clan elder spoke up.

“Oh?” Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly.

“Has the Holy Lord heard of the Spirit of Chaos?

The Spirit of Chaos?

Ye Qingtang had never heard of it before but could tell from the looks of the clan elders that it was something important. Her heart instantly filled with suspicion and she said, “What does that have to do with this?”

The ancient clan leader said, “The Holy Lord should remember that the Spirit of Chaos is the treasure of the Gods which had already existed when the second mainland was formed. When the Spirit of Chaos had broken that time, the various clans had fought over it for years, leading to heavy losses until the end when every clan retained a piece.

“In the beginning, the Holy Lord got a fragment of the Spirit of Chaos from the ancient clans as well, do you still remember?”

The Holy Lord of Shadows had a fragment of the Spirit of Chaos?

Ye Qingtang was taken aback. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

So she had gotten this Spirit of Chaos from the ancient clans.

Ye Qingtang knew that these clan elders came bearing praises since they wanted help from her. She was just afraid that the Spirit of Chaos fragment had been forcibly taken from them by the Holy Lord of Shadows...

“That youth is destroying entire clans to obtain that Spirit of Chaos fragment.” After a pause, the ancient clan elder continued, “At this point, we are all no match for this youth. If we were all destroyed, the Spirit of Chaos fragments in our hands would all be taken by him. At that time, the one left in your hand would be the last, and he will not rest until he has collected it all and will stop at nothing.

“By that time, it would be too late for the Holy Lord to be righteous...”

“That’s right. I don’t care if we die or live, but that lad must have a reason for collecting the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos so fanatically. Once he has collected most of the fragments, it would be too difficult for the Holy Lord to do anything,” the Baili Family Master said.

Ye Qingtang had never heard of the Spirit of Chaos before but there was no way the clan elders would dare to lie to the Holy Lord of Shadows.

It would be better for her if she knew the whereabouts of the Spirit of Chaos fragment. If push came to shove, she could hand it over to guarantee their safety.

But...

She had no idea where it was. For all she knew, the Holy Lord of Shadows could’ve taken it with her.

“I beg the Holy Lord to consider our situation. If you are willing to help us, we will support you completely.”

“Holy Lord, we’re afraid you’re the only person who can deal with that youth.”

The group of influential people begged Ye Qingtang incessantly for help. As they did, a complicated feeling sprouted from within Ye Qingtang as she looked at these people alone from her tall throne.

“If the Holy Lord doesn’t want to fight with that youth, what if we let the Dark Lord appear?” A clan elder asked cautiously.

They couldn’t understand why the Holy Lord of Shadows was so unwilling to take action.

The Dark Lord?

Ye Qingtang was taken aback.

What the hell was that?

Her gaze swept over to Ming Wang.

It couldn’t be... were Ming Wang, Ming Gu and Ming Di triplets?

“That’s right, Ming Di is great as well. As the Holy Lord’s steed, Ming Di’s strength was extraordinary. Why not use him?” the Mu Family Clan Leader suggested vehemently.
