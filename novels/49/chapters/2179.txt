Chapter 2180: Gardener (1)

Unless there were some other external factors, it was probably because those people had developed chaotic mental demons.

But those incidents became increasingly rare and Qin Feng was probably the first person in the Qin family over the past 10,000 years to have developed chaotic mental demons.

In present times, chaotic mental demons were like a nightmare that one could never wake up from. Once it developed, no matter how powerful the practitioner was, he would be ruined.

But 300 years into the future, this was no longer a difficult problem.

“Qin Feng.” Ye Qing looked at him.

Qin Feng turned toward Ye Qing. He had no idea what chaotic mental demons were. But he didn’t harbor any high hopes for this teacher. He was just fulfilling his promise and passing the time.

“I will set aside an area outside the classroom for you,” Ye Qing said.

By the side, Nangong Lie and Lei Yan pricked up their ears.

Wah!

To think that Boss held this kid in such high regard? Immediately setting aside a special cultivation area just for him?

Qin Feng was unimpressed by Ye Qing’s special treatment. He just gave a bitter smile.

He was the most powerful person in this group. As the teacher, it was only natural that she would hold him in high regard. It was a pity that she was just wasting her efforts. His powers would continue to decline.

A prodigy since young, Qin Feng was already used to preferential treatment from adults.

Just as everyone believed that Ye Qing was showing favoritism toward Qin Feng, she suddenly took out a cloth bag from her space ring, and placed it in Qin Feng’s hand.

Lei Yan and Nangong Lie felt extremely jealous.

A special cultivation area? Fine.

But now, Boss was giving him a treasure, right in front of everyone? This was so inappropriate.

Jealous!

Qin Feng glanced at the cloth bag in his hand and then dubiously at Ye Qing. “Teacher Ye, you don’t need to waste any effort on me. It would be better if you take this treasure back.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Qin Feng spoke nonchalantly. Teachers were indeed all the same.

“Treasure?” Ye Qing was taken aback.

Qin Feng glanced at the cloth bag in his hand.

Holding her forehead, Ye Qing said, “Open it and take a look.”

Qin Feng opened it. Nangong Lie and Lei Yan stretched out their necks, trying to take a look too.

When the bag was opened, there was no treasure to be seen at all. It was just a bagful of round seeds...

Qin Feng was stunned.

“I think you have misunderstood. These are flower seeds. I want you to plant these seeds in the area that I will set aside for you.” Ye Qing spoke calmly.

Qin Feng: “...”

Plant seeds?!

Him?!!

Nangong Lie and Lei Yan nearly burst out laughing.

Formidable.

Boss, we get you.

Boss must have felt that this Qin Feng was too arrogant. And so to punish him, he was being made a gardener!

The corners of Qin Feng’s lips twitched. But in the end, he didn’t say anything. With a bitter smile, he took the seeds.

Anyway, he was just passing time. Whatever.

As he said he would, Ye Qing lifted her hand and cleared an open space in the forest outside the classroom for Qin Feng.

Qin Feng put away his sword and picked up a hoe.

As Nangong Lie and the others attended lessons in the classroom, Qin Feng quietly planted the seeds outside.

Lei Yan felt rather pained at the sight.

“Brother, I really couldn’t tell that our Boss is so petty. Torturing Qin Feng like this just because Qin Feng was unwilling to attend his lessons. Planting seeds... is this really something that young masters should do?”
