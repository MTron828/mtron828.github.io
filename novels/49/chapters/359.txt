The incharge saw that Ye Qingtang seemed to be leaving and immediately looked at the elderly beside him.

The elderly man had a complicated expression. After remaining silent for some time, he suddenly walked up and asked, “Can I take a look at the two weapons you forged just now?”

Ye Qingtang exceeded her allotted time and was not in a position to reject his plea. Thus, she took both the dagger and the Demonic Blood Sword out.

The incharge walked forward and held the weapons cautiously with a stunned expression in his eyes. Placing the two weapons before the elderly man, the two people looked on agitatedly as though they were looking at precious treasures.

Staring at the weapons, the elderly man gently brushed his old hand against the two weapons. The Demonic Blood Sword emitted a cold air while some remaining warmth still remained in the dagger.

“Look, the air of the Demonic Blood Sword and the Spirit Crystals in it are combined perfectly. There’s actually no damage to the sword at all, and its aura is strengthened instead.” The elderly man looked at the Demonic Blood Sword with infatuation.

The incharge nodded repeatedly. “Yes, indeed. I’ve never seen such a technique before.”

“Look at this dagger…” The elderly man held the dagger and drew a few strokes in the air, and a sound akin to a dragon’s roar passed by their ears as the dagger glistened.

The elderly’s eyes brightened suddenly.

“Good!”

The eyes of the incharge were narrowed in enchantment.

Standing from aside, Ye Qingtang watched the two old men who were overflowing with energy like kids, and the corners of her lips twitched a little. This incharge was like a completely different person.

However, Ye Qingtang could not say anything as well. After all, she picked up a block of black gold meteorite iron here, and if she fussed about it with the incharge, she would probably not be able to bring the dagger back with her.

It was good that only admiration filled the eyes of the incharge and elderly, and they did not seem to make things difficult for her.

After looking at the weapons for quite some time, they finally returned them rather unwillingly to Ye Qingtang.

“Little girl, what’s your name?” The elderly could not help but ask after returning the weapons to Ye Qingtang.

However, this question shocked the incharge, who also looked at Ye Qingtang differently.

Ye Qingtang did not think much and replied. “I am Ye Qingtang.”

“Ye Qingtang…” The elderly ran a hand through his beard as he took a glance at Ye Qingtang with narrowed eyes. “Initially, I couldn’t tell that you actually know so many forging techniques at such a young age. Since you like it, you can visit the Sword Spirit Workshop more frequently in the future. Don’t waste your talent in forging armaments.”

Ye Qingtang nodded but was clearly aware that she did not have many extra Xuanming points to spend here. The two weapons were enough for her right now, and unless her skills increased by a great extent, she probably would not visit the Sword Spirit Workshop within a short period of time.

The elderly and incharge did not say anything else, and Ye Qingtang left after bidding her goodbyes.

Once Ye Qingtang left, the elderly finally laughed. “This girl has some talent in forging. If she comes again in the future, just let her forge.”

“Yes,” replied the incharge respectfully. Admiration emerged in his eyes as well. “I have never expected there to be someone with such a talent in forging in the inner sect. Her techniques are relatively skilled, and I’ve never seen her method of using Spirit Crystals to forge weapons.”

“From what you saw, what do you think of her forging abilities?” The elderly asked.

After a moment of hesitation, the incharge finally spoke. “Perhaps almost on par with mine.”

The elderly man was slightly shocked at his words.

The incharge of the Sword Spirit Workshop appeared rather casual, but if his name was revealed, everyone in the world probably knew about him.

“You’re saying that… her forging abilities can be said to be of a master’s standards?”
