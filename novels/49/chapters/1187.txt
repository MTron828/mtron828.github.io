Chapter 1188: Look At The Big Picture (3)

“Eldest Young Lady, what should we do next?” Elder Bai Kui looked at Ye Qingtang and asked.

Almost the entire South battlefield had fallen to the enemy’s hands, and only the ancient clan Master’s area was still struggling to hold out. However, they might not hold out much longer, and the South was to be lost…

“Wait.” Ye Qingtang gazed afar as she uttered slowly.

The war had already begun, and everyone, including herself, may die…

Ye Qingtang could not be certain of the outcome, and what she could do now was to take one step at a time and protect Little You Yun.

Two days later, there was finally news from the scouts that Ye Qingtang sent out.

“Reporting! The Ancient You Clan conquered Heaven City fully in half a day!” The scouts entered the hall and informed Ye Qingtang and the rest with cupped fists.

“How is that Ancient You Clan troop?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“There are many casualties. One of the three young talents of the Ancient You Clan died. Heaven City also has a high casualty rate!”

“Continue to get more information!” A glint flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes as she waved her sleeves.

“Yes!”

…

Half a day later, the scouts notified that the entire Heaven City had been conquered completely and that Gu Yu and the other powerful figures were fleeing toward Dragon Elephant City at top speed.

Ye Qingtang immediately led the rest to the top of the city walls and inspected the place ahead.

Fifteen minutes later, as reported by the scouts, Gu Yu and the other powerful figures from Heaven City were fleeing toward Dragon Elephant City swiftly like homeless dogs. In no time, they reached the foot of the city walls with dozens of Ancient You Clan figures right at their tails.

“Miss Ye, hurry up and let us in!” Gu Yu looked at Ye Qingtang and said repeatedly.

However, Ye Qingtang did not have the slightest intention to open the city gates.

“Ye Qingtang, what is the meaning of this?! Brother Gu Yu is the overall general of Heaven City. How dare you defy his orders?!”

Several Heaven City figures looked at Ye Qingtang and shouted sternly immediately.

Ye Qingtang, however, snickered coldly. “That is not so. I just feel that your battle has not ended.”

“What did you say?!” Gu Yu’s eyes twinkled coldly.

“Did I not say it clearly enough? You all have not finished this battle. I believe that given your skills, facing ten or so Ancient You Clan figures will not be a problem. Once they are dealt with, we will naturally open the city gates and welcome you all,” Ye Qingtang said.

“Ye Qingtang, how dare you forbid us from entering the city! You’re courting death!” An elderly glared at Ye Qingtang and shouted furiously.

Nonetheless, Ye Qingtang no longer gave any response.

At the same time, the Ancient You Clan figures had already caught up with them.

Seeing that there was no other way out, Gu Yu ordered with clenched teeth. “Fight it out with them!”

With that command, the Heaven City figures were locked in a battle with those Ancient You Clan figures.

It had to be said that Gu Yu and the rest were exceptionally skilled. An hour later, more than half of the Ancient You Clan figures were slain, though such deaths also happened to Gu Yu’s side. Until the very last minute, Ye Qingtang still did not have any intention to open the city gates.

Ye Qingtang did not take pity on Gu Yu and the others.

In their occupation of Heaven City, when had they truly thought of fighting the enemy? All they wanted was only to protect their lives.
