Chapter 1940: Ancient You Clan (1)

Somewhere hidden in the valleys of the Central Mainland.

A white-haired old man was standing in a huge pavilion. As he lifted his eyes slightly, his gaze fell on the wall of the pavilion. There were many crystal balls crammed onto the wall, all of them glowing from the inside.

Suddenly, without a warning, two crystal balls split open and shattered onto the floor.

The gaze of the old man changed and a middle-aged man guarding outside rushed in.

“You Feng and You Qu’s crystal balls shattered?” The middle-aged man frowned as he looked at the two shattered crystal balls.

The old man’s gaze swept over the two crystal balls and he said solemnly, “Where did they go?”

The middle-aged man thought for a moment before saying, “You Feng had been following orders obediently, obtaining the Spirit of Chaos fragments from the Ancient Clans. But he seemed to have suffered some humiliation at the Temple of Shadows and went to find You Qu after he came back...”

Before the middle-aged man finished speaking, the old man retracted his gaze.

The middle-aged man said, “These Life Pearls are the source of their lives. Since they are broken, does this mean that at the Temple of Shadows...”

“They died there,” the old man said lightly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

The middle-aged man froze before understanding what the old man said.

If their life source had shattered, it could only mean that they were no longer alive.

“Are you going to send anyone else to continue the mission since they’re dead?”

The old man nodded slightly. He lifted his arm to point out two other crystal balls and said, “Let them go.”

“Yes...” The middle-aged man accepted the order but said hesitantly, “What about the Temple of Shadows...”

The old man had both his hands behind his back as he turned to step out of the pavilion. “The Holy Lord of Shadows used to exist on the mainland. If she has truly returned, her strength is not to be underestimated. Our main goal is to collect the Spirit of Chaos fragments from the Ancient Clan. We are not going to deal with the Holy Lord of Shadows at this stage.”

“But I’ve heard that many Ancient Clans have already gone to the Temple of Shadows for protection,” the middle-aged man said.

The old man narrowed his eyes slightly and walked deeper into the valley. In front of him was a huge palace. The gates of the palace were slightly ajar.

It was pitch-black inside the palace and there was no movement at all.

Suddenly, a pair of glowing silver eyes appeared through the gap between the gates. It was looking outside the palace.

The old man narrowed his eyes further and spoke to the middle-aged man behind him.

“It doesn’t matter. It won’t be too late even if we deal with the Temple of Shadows after collecting the Spirit of Chaos fragments from the other Ancient Clans on the mainland. We have nothing to fear about the Ancient Clans. If anything, now that they’ve all gathered at the Temple of Shadows, it saves us the trouble of having to search for them.”

“Yes.” The middle-aged man understood his intentions. They didn’t have to deal with the Temple of Shadows now.

But he asked again after some hesitation, “How are we going to deal with the Elder on the east side?”

“Deal with him?” the old man laughed slightly and said, “We’ll spare their lives if they understand what’s going on, but...”

The old man paused for a while before saying, “They are bound to find out about what happened to the Domain Monarch and the Jiang family. Remember, we have to collect all the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos. Not one piece can be missing.”

“Yes!” Having received his orders, the middle-aged retreated before rushing to the east side of the valley.
