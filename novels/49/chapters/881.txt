Chapter 882 Previous and Current life (2)

Ye Qingtang was the only one who could be reborn. The Ling Yan she would meet in her new life would not have any old memories.

The reason he left a mark on the karmic natal chart was to prepare everything that was going to happen.

Even if Ye Qingtang was reborn, as long as he could see the relationship between Ye Qingtang’s karmic natal chart and his, he could figure out everything.

Soon, the sky seemed to be inverted, and time flew past.

Surprise appeared in Ye Qingtang’s eyes when he saw the man’s face.

“Ling… Ling Yan!”

In the fragmented images of her previous life, the man in white who appeared in the end was Ling Yan!

Ye Qingtang saw the short image after she died in her previous life. Ling Yan used all the power in the karma bloodline for her to be reborn…

Ye Qingtang finally understood why she was reborn at this moment.

It was Ling Yan who used all his karma bloodline in order for her to be reborn.

If she did not witness that with her own eyes, Ye Qingtang would never believe all that.

She had no relationship with Ling Yan in her previous life. She only heard about the news that Ling Yan was missing. She did not know why he would appear on the Lingyun Peak and use his own karma bloodline to help her to be reborn…

Ling Yan… Why would he do that for her?

Ye Qingtang frowned slightly, and her eyes were filled with confusion.

At the peak of the snowy mountain…

The wind howled through the snow.

Ling Yan walked over slowly and sat on the ground. He looked up into the sky repeatedly. His black hair was swinging in the gale.

“It seems like the azure dragon still has some intelligence…” Ling Yan murmured after a long time.

“However, I did not expect that the death calamity would arrive so early… It seems like my decision previously is right.” Ling Yan’s eyes sparkled as he murmured.

The body now only followed its instinct and was not driven by intelligence. The body was also willing to obey the instructions from the guide to be together with Ye Qingtang. All the things the body did were for the Heart of the Demon God.

However, it was ridiculous that the Heart of the Demon God was the cause of the death calamity.

He managed to trick everyone, and no one would know his true identity. The death calamity would not land on him. Thus, he could stay out of all these to break the death calamity.

That was the only way he could survive the calamity.

Ling Yan also had thought about taking back his power in the past. However, after serious consideration, he gave up on the plan. If he was too powerful, he would capture destiny’s attention. The consequences would be unimaginable if destiny found out his true identity.

Since he left all his power behind, he had no intention to take them back now.

“Miss Ye, I used the power of the karmic natal chart for your rebirth… Was that a right or a wrong decision…” Ling Yan’s black eyes suddenly turned into a dark green color that looked demonic and mysterious. He raised his eyes slowly and looked towards the distant place. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Ye Qingtang’s karmic natal chart was placed in front of Ling Yan.

There was an obvious mark that appeared on Ye Qingtang’s karmic natal chart that could only be noticed by Ling Yan.

From Ye Qingtang’s death in her previous life, it was not hard to notice that Ye Qingtang’s soul was affected by the power of karma and was able to be reborn in this life.
