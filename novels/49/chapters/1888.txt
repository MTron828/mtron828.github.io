“Of course I am well aware of that. Why else do you think I am wasting my time here?” Liu Rusu snapped. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Seemingly used to her attitude, Liu Jiangran only smiled. “Senior Sister is indeed smart and astute. You think of everything.”

Although Liu Rusu wanted to reply, the doors to the Crystal Palace suddenly opened. Liu Rusu and the others immediately turned to look.

“Long Xiao, you finally dare to show your face?” Liu Rusu raised her brows slightly as she gazed at Long Xiao, who had just emerged with a group of people.

A smile was on Long Xiao’s face. “Why would I not dare to?”

“Useless trash. Surrender now and I might let you suffer a little less pain,” Liu Rusu demanded.

Standing beside Long Xiao, Long Yao’s expression immediately darkened at Liu Rusu’s arrogance. She wanted to make a move but was discreetly held back by Long Xiao.

“Surrender? You must be dreaming.” Long Xiao smiled.

Liu Rusu narrowed her eyes. She raised her hand, prepared to strike Long Xiao. But just as Liu Rusu lifted her hand, an amused voice suddenly echoed from within the Crystal Palace.

“How did Liu Ruofeng end up producing such ill-mannered disciples like you?”

A slender figure sashayed out of the front entrance.

Liu Rusu immediately halted upon hearing the name ‘Liu Ruofeng’.

Liu Ruofeng was the Master of both Liu Rusu and Liu Jiangran. He was also the current Poison Emperor of the Ten Thousand Poison Valley.

“Who are you? How dare you address my Master by his name!” Liu Rusu stated coldly.

The slender figure continued to float out of the Crystal Palace. It was a breathtakingly gorgeous young lady.

Liu Rusu was completely thunderstruck when she finally had a clear look.

Staring in a daze at the lovely young woman emerging from the Crystal Palace, Liu Rusu looked as if she couldn’t believe her own eyes.

Di Jiuyuan had already vanished from the Second Domain before Liu Rusu joined the Ten Thousand Poison Valley. As a result, everything she knew about Di Jiuyuan was hearsay from her Master, Liu Ruofeng. Liu Rusu had also seen the portrait of Di Jiuyuan hanging in her Master’s study.

“Di Jiuyuan?!” As cold and imperious as Liu Rusu was, even she couldn’t help being stunned by the sight of ‘Di Jiuyuan’.

With Di Jiuyuan’s face, Ye Qingtang gazed calmly at the Ten Thousand Poison Valley people. Luckily she had previously pretended to be the Holy Lord of Shadows and was very well-versed in assuming the mannerisms of a domineering figure.

As she glanced past Long Xiao and the others, her lips curved up gently in an elegant smile.

“Senior Sister, that is... Di Jiuyuan?” Since Liu Jiangran was a bit younger, he knew even less about Di Jiuyuan.

Liu Rusu’s face turned grim. They had come intending to find Di Jiuyuan, but... she had planned to capture Long Xiao and the rest as hostages first, before slowly sussing out Di Jiuyuan’s whereabouts. In this way, they could lay a trap for Di Jiuyuan to fall in on her own.

But now...

It was hard to believe that Long Xiao and his people had already found the missing Di Jiuyuan.

“Could she be a fake? Di Jiuyuan has been missing for so long. How did Long Xiao and his people manage to find her so easily? Moreover... doesn’t Senior Sister find that Di Jiuyuan’s sudden appearance at this crucial point is too much of a coincidence?” Liu Jiangran piped up.

Di Jiuyuan was very formidable. Long before she went missing, she was already a high-level practitioner who dominated over her peers. They were no match for her at all.

A cold glint flashed past Liu Rusu’s eyes. With a chilly smile on her face, Liu Rusu stepped forward and cupped her fists in a respectful gesture. “Greetings, Senior Di. I am your junior, Liu Rusu. I have heard many great things about you and it is my honor to finally meet you today. I have come on behalf of my Master to find you.”

Real or fake, they would know soon enough.
