Chapter 1702: Top Beauty Rankings (1)

“Although I don’t know what it looks like, the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm is very dangerous, you must not underestimate it. Not only that, it also offers a lot of opportunities for gain. You two must be extra careful inside, and take care of each other.” Elder Qian looked at Jiang Shaobai and Ye Qingtang. Death and injuries were very common inside the mystic realm. There were also countless people who have gone missing inside the realm.

No one knew if they had been killed by the innate dangers of the realm, or were harmed by fighters from the other clans...

“Sister Qing and I will take care of each other.” Jiang Shaobai grinned. Right in front of all Elder Qian, he unabashedly looped one arm around Ye Qingtang’s.

The corners of Elder Qian’s lips twitched when he saw Jiang Shaobai’s brazen manner, but he quickly recomposed himself.

“Good.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Thereafter, Elder Qian instructed Ye Qingtang and Jiang Shaobai on some other things to take note of. Time was not fixed inside the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm. No one could predict when they would emerge.

They left after listening to Elder Qian’s warnings.

Ye Qingtang didn’t waste the several days of rest. She spent every minute and second cultivating.

Baili Xuanyun’s powers were not that much higher than hers. As a result, she could just about manage him. She would probably have been annihilated if she had been matched up against more powerful opponents like Baili Xi.

These thoughts meant that Ye Qingtang did not dare to slacken off when she thought of how she would have to face the powerful Ancient You Clan in future.

Ye Qingtang was very hardworking, but some people kept interrupting her attempts to concentrate on cultivating.

On the day before she was to enter the Immortal Footsteps Mystic Realm, Jiang Yisheng and Jiang Yiran charged into Ye Qingtang’s room and dragged her out, leaving a dumbstruck little white tiger behind.

Damn, was this a kidnapping?

Before Ye Qingtang could understand what those two rascals wanted, she had been dragged to the Island of Immortal Footsteps restaurant.

The inside of the restaurant was packed to the brim. Most of the youths from the various clans had gathered inside the main hall, all engaged in some kind of heated discussion.

“Why have you brought me here?” Ye Qingtang looked in exasperation at the two guys, one on either side of her, holding onto her arms.

“Of course it’s for something good.” Jiang Yisheng chuckled.

Ye Qingtang got goosebumps all over just from hearing his chuckle.

“Today is the release of the top beauty rankings. Previously you garnered quite a substantial number of votes over Mu Ruxue, but the past few days of the voting results have been kept a secret. So we’ll only know the final results today. If all goes as expected, the top beauty of this year’s Martial Arts Championship will be you.” Jiang Yiran grinned.

“...” Ye Qingtang felt her scalp go numb. She shrugged off the two guys and turned to leave.

What a nuisance!

She didn’t have to depend on her looks to survive, alright?!

What top beauty?!

But there was no way Jiang Yisheng and Jiang Yiran would let Ye Qingtang leave. They reached out and dragged her back.

“Let go of me,” Ye Qingtang hissed.

“Don’t go, the results will be announced soon. No harm hanging around to listen,” Jiang Yisheng urged cheerily.

“I will beat the two of you up if you don’t let go right now.” Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes.

Jiang Yiran and Jiang Yisheng immediately let go. Having personally witnessed Ye Qingtang beat up Baili Xuanyun, they were naturally afraid of her violent fists.

They would rather die an immediate death by a single stroke, than get punched and kicked to a pulp.
