Chapter 919 The Divine Phoenix’s Trial (4)

Everyone looked around their surroundings. The stream before their eyes was more than familiar. From the very start till the end, all of them had never left this place at all!

“Illusion?!”

Several cultivators who were proficient in illusion techniques were completely shaken.

They were extremely accomplished in the field of illusions and definitely could sense it if an illusion technique was cast on them.

However…

The illusion cast by this Divine Phoenix was simply flawless and was no different from reality. It was as though they entered the illusory space from reality in a second without any signs of it!

Who could have sensed that such a sophisticated move was an illusion?!

“How can this be?!”

The cultivators who consumed the delicacies a while ago were dumbstruck.

After feasting, they clearly felt the wine passing down their throats and the delicacies filling their stomachs.

How… could this be an illusion?

This was too frighteningly real!

The Divine Phoenix had passed away with the True Dragon many years ago.

Currently, this scarlet virtual image was merely the last trace of the spirit of the Divine Phoenix. Could it be that the last remaining spirit of the Divine Phoenix was so powerful?!

How terrifying was this power!

If the Divine Phoenix wanted to use the illusion technique to massacre them, it could do that in an instant.

If the Divine Phoenix wanted to do harm, everyone at the scene would already have died!

“It’s a pity that you all are not cautious enough… I told you all to eat, and so did you all. If I told you all to die, would you all listen obediently as well?” The Divine Phoenix sighed as it looked at those cultivators who ate heartily and were currently at a loss right now.

A few cultivators were a little baffled. Of course, there was no problem in following the orders if they were told to dig in and feast, but it was definitely impossible if they were told to die…

Without giving the cultivators a chance to speak, the Divine Phoenix shook its head rather disappointingly. “You all are not cautious enough, and the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix must not land in the hands of careless and impatient people.”

After it spoke, the cultivators’ bodies exploded instantly and turned into chopped pieces.

“Ah…”

Many cultivators were left agape by what they saw. Even if they did not pass the Divine Phoenix’s assessment, it did not… did not get to the point where it had to kill those people, did it?!

Who knew if they could pass the assessment? If they were unable to, wouldn’t they… die as well?!

At this moment, everyone could not help but begin to feel that… the cultivators who left out of impatience at the very first round of trials were extremely lucky.

Although those people did not pass the first round, they did not have to worry about their lives…

“Currently, the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix has already begun. From the second round onward, victors can obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix while failures only have the fate of death. Anyone who is afraid can withdraw.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The Divine Phoenix announced coldly.

“I withdraw!”

A lady took a step forward immediately and said after a moment of hesitation.

Only one person could obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix. In that case, out of the remaining thirty plus people, only one person could live!

Who was willing to gamble with their lives?

“May I ask how many people will eventually obtain the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix?” A young man asked with a frown.

“Only one.” The scarlet figure replied.

“If that’s the case, I will withdraw as well.” The young man lamented and shook his head.

“Forget it, it seems that the inheritance of the Divine Phoenix and I have no fate. I will withdraw too.”
