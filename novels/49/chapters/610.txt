Chapter 611: Blessed Grotto-heaven (2)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang did not wait anymore. She sat down with her feet crossed and concentrated her whole body’s primordial qi to link with the spirit energy in the blessed Grotto-heaven.

The spirit energy here was very intense, and nowhere else could compare with this place. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

When Ye Qingtang concentrated all her primordial qi, the spirit energy in the blessed Grotto-heaven flooded towards her body.

After around an hour, Ye Qingtang sat there stably and entered a state of meditation. She was exhaling waste breath and inhaling spirit energy.

After sitting there for half a day, the Blood Moon Elder’s anxious voice came into her ears!

“Holy Lady!”

As the Blood Moon Elder shouted, he rushed into the cave, and his face was restless.

Ye Qingtang opened her eyes slowly, and a cold light sparkled through her eyes.

The spirit energy in the blessed Grotto-heaven was almost completely absorbed by her. Her cultivation level had entered the mid-stage of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three from the peak stage of the First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three. Her body still stored a large amount of spirit energy that she had yet digested. If she could digest all the spirit energy, Ye Qingtang was confident that her martial ability would enter the Third Heaven of Martial Qi Level three or even higher!

As Ye Qingtang finally opened her eyes, the Blood Moon Elder said in a hurry, “Holy Lady, we need to get out of this place now. I sensed an extremely strong demonic aura rushing towards here!”

Strong demonic aura?

Ye Qingtang was slightly stunned. She scanned through the scattered bones, and she got up immediately.

There was no point to stay at the blessed Grotto-heaven anymore since most of the spirit energy was absorbed by her.

“Go.”

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder turned and left the place without any hesitation.

The moment they walked out of the blessed Grotto-heaven, the cave collapsed as there was no more spirit energy left to support its structure.

Roar!

Suddenly, a furious roar came from the direction in front!

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder looked forward and saw a huge black crocodile with a black aura. It moved swiftly and reached in front of them in a few breaths of time.

“King-level demonic beast!”

Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder were shocked as they saw the huge black crocodile.

The huge black crocodile stared at the collapsed blessed Grotto-heaven and roared in rage. Its eyes were as big as lanterns, and its eyesight landed on Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Just as the Blood Moon Elder had guessed earlier, the blessed Grotto-heaven was the living place of a king-level demonic beast. Now that all the spirit energy in the cave was absorbed by Ye Qingtang, it made the king-level demonic beast furious.

Ye Qingtang then understood where the bones of demonic beasts came from in the cave. They seemed to be leftovers from the food of the huge black crocodile.

Roar!!

The huge black crocodile roared in rage again. A horrifyingly intense demonic aura spread around.

The huge black crocodile went mad and attacked Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Ye Qingtang did not intend to fight against the king-level demonic beast and fled with the Blood Moon Elder.

Though Ye Qingtang’s martial ability had entered the mid-stage of the Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three, her ability was still not stabilized since she just broke through. It was not beneficial for her to engage in the fight now.

Furthermore, the king-level demonic beast was strong. Even if Ye Qingtang could defeat it, she would need to pay a great price.
