Chapter 1902: Temple of Shadows (2)

Ming Wang was momentarily taken aback, but he quickly recomposed himself and said stiffly, “I am not Ming Gu.”

Ye Qingtang raised her brows slightly and reached out to pinch Ming Wang’s cheek. “How hurtful your words are! And to think that I missed you so much.”

At that, Ye Qingtang could clearly feel the cheek between her fingers stiffen.

Silly fool.

Still trying to pretend?!

In the past, all Ye Qingtang could think about was escaping the Temple of Shadows. But somehow, she felt a strange sense of peace and comfort upon her return.

“Stop fooling around.” Ming Wang suppressed the frantic flurry in his heart and pulled Ye Qingtang’s hand away with a slight frown.

Ye Qingtang wanted to continue teasing Ming Wang but behind her, Jiang Shaobai jumped down from White Tiger’s back and bumbled over to cling onto Ye Qingtang’s side in his usual manner. He stared at Ming Wang with wide, dopey eyes.

A harsh light flashed across Ming Wang’s eyes the moment he noticed Jiang Shaobai.

Ye Qingtang immediately knew what Ming Wang was thinking and was prepared to speak up. But before she could do so, a small figure was charging right into her.

Almost instinctively, Ye Qingtang raised her hands to catch that little cannon-ball figure.

“Ah Yao, you’re finally back. Sob... I thought you had abandoned me again...” Ming Gu sobbed so hard that he was smearing tears and snot all over Ye Qingtang. He nuzzled his pitiful little face in her arms, as if he was a coquettish kitten.

Standing by the side, Xue Fu rubbed his nose. He had immediately gone to inform Ming Gu the moment they got the news. Before Xue Fu could finish his sentence, Ming Gu had already flown past him and disappeared without a trace.

The two fierce and formidable Holy Sons. They were indeed biological brothers. Underneath it all, they still had the same mannerisms.

Ye Qingtang’s heart nearly melted at the sight of the woeful Ming Gu fussing in her arms.

“I’m back now, aren’t I? How could I have possibly abandoned you?” Ye Qingtang patted Ming Gu on the back. She was very amused by Ming Gu’s clingy personality.

On the side, Ming Wang stood there with a stony expression.

“You are not allowed to leave again. Even if you want to leave... you... you must bring me along.” Ming Gu had a death grip on Ye Qingtang. He was deeply afraid that she might disappear again if he was not careful.

“Elder sister.”

A voice suddenly piped up from beside Ye Qingtang, and Ming Gu immediately lifted his head.

It was only then that he noticed the handsome young teenager hanging onto Ye Qingtang’s arm.

“You! Who are you!” Ming Gu widened his eyes as he glared furiously at Jiang Shaobai. One could nearly see the flames spewing out of Ming Gu’s eyes as he glared at the hands clinging onto Ye Qingtang’s arm.

“Let go of her! Smelly little bugger. How dare you taint my Ah Yao! Men, take this dirty scoundrel away and execute him!” Ming Gu was incensed. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

How could his Ah Yao allow this wretched and disgusting idiot to taint her in this manner?

Ming Gu’s voice was full of thunderous rage. Hearing his angry shouts, the simple-minded Jiang Shaobai instinctively shrank back and hid behind Ye Qingtang.

Seeing the insolent brat, Ming Gu was now desperate to kill this eyesore of a person.

“How dare you continue touching my Ah Yao! I will kill you!” Ming Gu roared as he reached out one hand toward Jiang Shaobai.

“Ming Gu.” Ye Qingtang grabbed Ming Gu’s wrist.

Jiang Shaobai had yet to fully recover from his injuries. Just one smack by Ming Gu would surely send him to his deathbed.
