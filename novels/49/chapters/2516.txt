Ye Qingtang glanced at the big yellow dog. “I’m not familiar with it either.”

It was true that she was not familiar with the Second Domain. Although she had been to the Second Domain in her previous life, this was a different era. Furthermore, the continent she was on was different.

“It doesn’t matter if you’re not familiar with it. It would still be better if we traveled together,” the yellow dog insisted.

Ye Qingtang looked at the big yellow dog with a strange expression. What was wrong with this dog? When it was in the Wailing Well, it had been imposing and domineering, claiming that it wanted to take revenge for a blood feud?

But now? Was it not planning to take revenge anymore? It wanted to travel around with her instead…

Actually, Ye Qingtang had not intended to leave the big yellow dog behind. It was just that its current behavior had piqued her curiosity.

“Who are you?”

Ye Qingtang crouched down and examined the big yellow dog carefully. Everything about this big yellow dog was like a mystery that Ye Qingtang could not figure out at all.

“I really am just a dog. Isn’t that obvious?” The big yellow dog said while wagging its tail.

Indeed, Ye Qingtang did not doubt the big yellow dog’s words. Ye Qingtang also believed that it was indeed a dog. But what kind of dog it was and where it came from was the main point.

“I don’t know how long you were asleep in the Wailing Well but I want to know where you came from before you fell asleep?” Ye Qingtang did not beat around the bush.

The yellow dog was silent for a moment before it sighed. “Tell me, why are you so curious? You are just a human girl. You wouldn’t believe me even if I told you.”

“Then what about Shi Tian?” Ye Qingtang continued to ask.

As Ye Qingtang said that, the big yellow dog tilted its head. “Well… it’s a long story. However, I did misunderstand you. You have nothing to do with Shi Tian. It’s normal that you don’t know him or even know him.”

“Who exactly is Shi Tian?” Ye Qingtang asked.

“Shi Tian… You wouldn’t know even if I told you. At your level…” the big yellow dog mumbled softly.

“Eh, Brother Canine, I have always respected you but I am not happy when you speak like that to my Holy Lady. So what if my Holy Lady is ‘only at this level’? She is not even worthy to know about some bullshit Shi Tian? Who does he think he is? Is he a god?” The Blood Moon Elder was displeased. No one could disparage his Holy Lady.

“God?” The big yellow dog shook its head. “No, not that.”

“See, he’s not a god. Why is there a need to talk about level? People can’t even know about him? That’s too much.” The Blood Moon Elder scoffed.

“But he’s an immortal,” said the big yellow dog.

The Blood Moon Elder frowned deeply. Did he hear wrongly or did the big yellow dog speak wrongly? Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

What the hell? Immortal?

“Did you say that Shi Tian is an immortal?” Ye Qingtang stared at the big yellow dog. Immortal… Could he be from the Fourth Domain?

However, as everyone knew, the Fourth Domain had already become a dead zone. There were no living creatures there.

“The Fourth Domain… What’s that?” The yellow dog asked.

Ye Qingtang sighed. She realized that she did not live in the same world as this big yellow dog. It did not even know the basic composition of the four domains of the world.. At that moment, Ye Qingtang began to seriously suspect whether this big yellow dog was playing a prank on her.
