1533 Who Says I“m Not A Baby 2

Clearly, the Heavenly Demon Bloodline had not yet awakened in these Jiang Family disciples, which was why the Demonic Bears had attacked them.

Jiang Yu did not think much about it. He narrowed his eyes as he and the other powerful figures looked at the thick fog.

They soon discovered what was odd about the thick fog.

Jiang Yu said to Ye Qingtang, “Throw this corpse into the thick fog, and let’s see what happens.”

Ye Qingtang tossed the body of the dead Jiang Family disciple in.

Sure enough, the moment the body entered the thick fog, the fog sank into the body, which then exploded.

The group of children behind Ye Qingtang broke into a cold sweat at this gory sight.

They had doubted the truth of Ye Qingtang’s words, but now... they had no more doubts. They wanted to cry... Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

How could they escape through this thick fog?

Jiang Yu nodded slightly at this scene. Then, he said, “You go and try it out. Just walk near it, don’t enter.”

Ye Qingtang seemed to realize something when she heard Jiang Yu’s words. So she tentatively walked near the thick fog. The thick fog did not seem to sense her and made no attempt to attack her.

“So that’s it.” Jiang Yu immediately understood.

“The thick fog was slowly formed from the power of the deity’s curse. The residual power of the deity will attack anyone who enters, but... you drank the holy water just now. The holy water also contains the deity’s power, so the fog can sense the power of the holy water and won’t attack.”

When Ye Qingtang saw everyone furiously drinking the holy water just now, she thought it might be beneficial, so she also drank a mouthful. However, she did not sense any change; she did not expect her momentary curiosity to become the key to passing through the thick fog.

Everyone heaved a sigh of relief when they heard Jiang Yu’s words. Otherwise, they could never leave this place with that thing in the way.

“What are we waiting for? Let’s go!” Emperor Yan could not wait to leave this accursed place. The sooner he escaped, the sooner he could cultivate. He did not want to stay in his diminutive state, and neither did he want to remain in this hellish place one moment longer.

“If you want to die, go ahead.” Jiang Yu glared at Emperor Yan.

“...” If Ye Qingtang had not been supporting Jiang Yu, Emperor Yan would have fought Jiang Yu there and then.

Jiang Yu looked at Ye Qingtang and questioned her about the other things in the thick fog. Ye Qingtang told him about the black strings that could flay a person.

Just as Ye Qingtang was talking about this, a body near the thick fog suddenly started to move.

Everyone looked and saw numerous black strings rise out of the thick fog. They wrapped themselves around the body and sank into the skin. As everyone looked on, they performed a gory show, flaying the skin before their eyes.

Now...

Emperor Yan and the others were really on the verge of collapsing.

They had finally managed to find a way to avoid the thick fog’s attack, but the black strings still blocked the exit!

No wonder this had become a forbidden land. Just the thick fog and the flaying black strings alone would kill large groups of people, not to speak of the Demonic Bears and other demonic creatures that lay in wait within.

A look of amusement secretly flashed across Ye Qingtang’s eyes when she saw everyone’s expressions.

She had been waiting for this moment.

“But when I entered, the black strings did not attack me. I wonder if it has something to do with bloodlines,” Ye Qingtang said with pretended casualness.

She glanced at the group from the corner of her eye.
