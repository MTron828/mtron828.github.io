Chapter 575 Immortals and Buddhas (2)

After becoming a Paragon in her previous life, she had heard myths about the ancient era of which Immortals and Buddhas once appeared.

Perfected Immortals and ancient Buddhas existed in that mysterious Fourth Domain which had

completely disappeared now. Thus, many did not know what immortals and Buddhas were… Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Ye Qingtang was extremely curious about what exactly happened to the mysterious Fourth Domain that caused billions of life to be exterminated and Immortals and Buddhas to perish… Until now, the Fourth Domain did not exist…

Ye Qingtang had an extremely deep interest in the Fourth Domain since her previous life, and she had even studied the disappearance of the Perfected Immortals and ancient Buddhas for a period of time. It was, however, that people were chasing after her life, and she did not have many chances to study it deeply. Thus, she achieved nothing.

Roar!!!

Suddenly, a roar resembling that of a fierce beast pulled Ye Qingtang back to reality.

The Buddha statue was already near them. Like a towering giant, it walked in the blood-colored city in search of Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder.

Then, Ye Qingtang brought the Blood Moon Elder into a slightly more ordinary house without any hesitation.

The most pressing matter of the moment was to avoid being killed by the Buddha statue.

Given Ye Qingtang’s and the Blood Moon Elder’s skills, there was no way they could be compared to that Buddha statue that had sunk into the demonic path. As long as they fought with the Buddha statue, there was no chance of winning, and both of them had to be prepared to be swallowed anytime.

After they hid in the house, the Buddha statue’s sinister laughter finally receded.

There was a deep well outside the courtyard, but it had long dried.

There were many withered plants in their surroundings. Taking a close look, it was an extremely rundown house.

“It’s truly mysterious…” Curiosity was etched on the Blood Moon Elder’s face. “Something unimaginable seemed to have happened to the Fourth Domain on the night it disappeared. It’s as though the Perfected Immortals and ancient Buddhas had once entered a tragic battle with some unknown entities…”

“Is that possible…” Ye Qingtang shook her head in disagreement to the Blood Moon Elder’s words.

The Perfected Immortals and ancient Buddhas never aged nor died, and they had the same longevity as the world. They had long turned into a part of the laws of powers. As long as the universe was not destroyed,

the Perfected Immortals and ancient Buddhas would not die.

Presently, the powerful figures at the Emperor level were invincible and unrivaled. Even the owner of the Heart of the Demon God in her body, the Demon God, had to bow in respect when he met the ancient Buddhas and Perfected Immortals.

That level had long surpassed secularity and turned into a part of Dao. How could Demon God, Fiend Honor, and Human Emperor be compared to them?

But such a powerful Fourth Domain, including those Immortals and Buddhas who once discussed Dao with Saints and stood shoulder to shoulder with the Heaven, perished just like that…

Ye Qingtang felt that she was too weak. Even if she reached the Paragon level in her previous life, she did not have the qualifications to peer into the secrets of the Fourth Domain and much less figure out the reason behind the fall of the Immortals and Buddhas.

Currently, Ye Qingtang increasingly thought that this world was perhaps not like what she imagined or saw. Living in this mainland was forever like living at the bottom of the well. Everything she could see or touch was merely the tip of the iceberg.

Those secrets of the mythical era were innumerable, and each of them was like a treasure that attracted many to continuously explore…
