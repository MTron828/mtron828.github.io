Chapter 135: Raise the Bet (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

“Oh? Does Junior Sister Ye wants to give it a try? How do you want to compete?” Zhou Qu would naturally not let go of such a fat sheep. There was already no one going up the arena, and Ye Qingtang was the last person that he could trick. Of course, he had to properly “greet” her.

Ye Qingtang calmly looked at the greed in Zhou Qu’s eyes, and her lips curled up.

“Just now, Senior Brother Zhou said that I would win a bottle of Xi Spirit Pills as long as I receive three moves. I think this bet seems pretty little, how about we bet on four bottles?” Ye Qingtang said with a smile.

Once her words were said, everyone around here was instantly dumbfounded.

“Is Ye Qingtang crazy? She actually wants to bet on four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills with Senior Brother Zhou?”

“Where would she get four bottles from?”

Those new disciples who went up the arena previously were extremely shocked when they saw Ye Qingtang’s crazy act and only felt that Ye Qingtang had nothing better to do and was sending herself to death’s door.

However, there were also some bad-meaning disciples who lost their Xi Spirit Pills who hoped that someone would be worse than them since they lost a bottle of Xi Spirit Pill and were going to fall behind others in their cultivation. It so happened that Ye Qingtang’s suggestion fulfilled their requirements.

Similarly, Zhou Qu did not expect that the fat sheep that foolishly delivered herself to him would be so “self-aware.” He initially thought that he would end things by cheating one bottle. Who would have thought… Ye Qingtang actually came over to increase the bet, and this really made him happy.

“Junior Sister Ye, don’t say I’m bullying you. I can agree to your request, but I want to ask something: you, a new disciple, just entered the sect and received two bottles of Xi Spirit Pills in total. If you want to compete with me, you should show some sincerity, right?”

Ye Qingtang chuckled and immediately took out four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills from her arms.

Once he saw those four bottles, Zhou Qu’s eyes almost popped out.

This girl really had four bottles!

From aside, Yun Shu did not know whether to laugh or cry at Ye Qingtang’s crazy act. Amongst the four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills in her hands, two of them were his.

When Ye Qingtang asked him for his Xi Spirit Pills just now, Yun Shu was still a little hesitant. However, when he saw the girl’s sincere look, Yun Shu could not bear to reject her. He already mentally prepared himself and treated it as going crazy with Ye Qingtang for once; so be it if she lost them all.

While Xi Spirit Pills were precious, Yun Shu had a peaceful nature and was not too concerned.

Everyone was quite surprised that Ye Qingtang could obtain four bottles of Xi Spirit Pills and were all curious where she got two additional bottles from.

Only Lu Xiuwen frowned slightly as his gaze landed on Yun Shu who was smiling bitterly from aside. Seeing Yun Shu’s behavior, Lu Xiuwen already knew the background of the other two bottles and could not help but scoff in his heart.

To think that he still thought of Yun Shu as his only competitor in the batch. Who would have thought that Yun Shu would be this foolish to give his Xi Spirit Pills to Ye Qingtang to play around with.

Yet, coming to think of it, Lu Xiuwen was satisfied.

His abilities were comparable to Yun Shu’s. If he could pull a gap between them the moment he entered the sect, it would naturally be the best. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He had the confidence that he could leave Yun Shu behind with the advantage of these two bottles of Xi Spirit Pills.

No one at the scene felt that Ye Qingtang was able to win. The new disciples were watching the good show while the old disciples quietly sighed.

Lin Long walked past the arena, and while she did not intend to pay attention to it initially, she stopped in her tracks when she saw the tiny frame in the corner of her eyes.
