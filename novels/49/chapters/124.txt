Chapter 125: Such a Pity (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

Ye Qingtang sensed Lu Xiuwen’s gaze. This time, she turned around slightly, and a maddening smile formed on her face. “Lu Xiuwen, do you still remember what you said previously?”

[If even you can enter the sect, won’t I be a useless piece of trash?]

The sentence Lu Xiuwen said initially smashed on himself like a huge rock.

Never had Lu Xiuwen dreamt that Ye Qingtang could really enter Xuanling Sect!

His good-looking face turned blue as though he was given two big slaps publicly, making him look extremely ugly.

Lu Xiuwen secretly clenched his teeth and forcefully suppressed the dissatisfaction in his heart without taking another look at Ye Qingtang. Otherwise, he would really be pissed to death by her!

The days ahead are still long. There was still a long time in Xuanling Sect in the future.

He would definitely not allow such a lowly Ye Qingtang to succeed!

Lu Xiuwen’s reactions fell into Ye Qingtang’s eyes. She was very happy and satisfied.

In this life, she needed to return back to Lu Xiuwen hundreds and even thousand times the pain that he had brought her in her previous life.

The days ahead were still long. She has the time.

“Congratulations, Miss Ye.” A gentle voice sounded beside Ye Qingtang.

Ye Qingtang turned around and saw her Senior Brother Yun’s good-man smile and his sincere eyes.

“Now, we’re all disciples of Xuanling Sect. Don’t address me as Miss Ye now. Is it fine if I call you ‘Senior Brother Yun’?” Ye Qingtang looked at Yun Shu smilingly. Though she was like a devil, she distinguished kindness and hatred clearly. She would not forget Yun Shu’s kindness towards her.

Yun Shu was stunned. He felt that Ye Qingtang’s smile was like a sunny day in March, so bright that he felt a little dizzy.

She said ‘Senior Brother Yun’ so naturally as though she had been long familiar with such a form of address.

Yun Shu returned to his senses and quietly laughed at his weird thought, as today was the first time he met Ye Qingtang. “That is my honour, junior sister.”

Hearing the words ‘junior sister’ made it seem as if Ye Qingtang returned to her previous life. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The Senior Brother Yun who protected her throughout her most miserable period of time finally returned.

Ye Qingtang narrowed her eyes. She had not forgotten her previous suspicions. Now that she entered Xuanling Sect together with Yun Shu, she would be extremely careful and definitely investigate what exactly happened in the previous lifetime for such a bright and talented Yun Shu to be tortured into that abjected state.

In this life, it would be her who protects him!

The friendly relationship between Ye Qingtang and Yun Shu fell into Lu Xiuwen’s eyes.

From the start, Yun Shu was the biggest competitor in his heart, and Ye Qingtang was even more a piece of trash that offended him. Seeing the two of them like that annoyed him even further.

Xuanling Sect’s assessment ended, and the selected candidates were elated.

The few elders within the sect who discussed the final outcome left successively and returned to their posts.

Only Elder Qin stayed a little while at the Water Moon Mirror. As he looked at Ye Qingtang through the Water Moon Mirror, his eyes had a complicated expression, but more than that, they were filled with regret.

“Elder Qin, the preparation for the Ling Yue array is completed. Please return and take a look,” said an Array Faction disciple as he invited Elder Qin to leave.

Elder Qin sighed lightly.

“Such a pity… really such a pity…”

All of Ye Qingtang’s performances stunned him deeply. If Ye Qingtang did not have a red spirit root, with just her level of talent, Elder Qin would definitely make an exception and directly accept her as an inner sect disciple of the Array Faction.

However…

Ultimately, it was such a pity.
