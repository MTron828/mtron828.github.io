Chapter 569: Mystic Realm (3)

As Ye Qingtang’s Demonic Blood Sword was unsheathed, the two Yunxiao Sect disciples were slaughtered in an instant and died on the spot.

“Holy Lady is indeed powerful. I admire you extremely. Being able to follow beside you is truly my blessing…”

The Blood Moon Elder was stopped by Ye Qingtang before he even finished boot-licking.

All he had been saying were these few sentences for the past few days, and Ye Qingtang’s ears were about to rot. She was only this close to stuffing a piece of cloth in his mouth.

The immediate deaths of the two Yunxiao Sect disciples caught the Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect disciples off guard.

At that instant, the disciples from two sects were completely dumbfounded as they looked at Ye Qingtang with eyes popped wide open. Their minds were blank as though they had completely lost the ability to think.

The two who died were both Yunxiao Sect disciples who had entered Martial Qi Level Three a long time ago and were very powerful.

However… an itinerant cultivator who came from nowhere slaughtered both of them with just one slash!

Given Ye Qingtang’s current skills, when she used all her cards, there was no worry as long as she did not encounter anyone at Second Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three.

Currently, ordinary First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three cultivators were not worth a mention to Ye Qingtang.

“Have you seen enough?” Ye Qingtang’s eyes swept across the dumbfounded Wind Moon Sect and Qinglin Sect disciples as she spoke with a seeming smile. Her slightly-curled lips added a devilish charm to her attractive face.

“Mercy!”

With just a glimpse from Ye Qingtang, the sects’ disciples felt a chill in their bones as though their entire body had fallen into an icehouse.

Powerful First Heaven of Martial Qi Level Three cultivators were killed by this nameless itinerant cultivator with one slash. In their eyes, how different were ordinary disciples like them from ants…

“Strip your clothes,” Ye Qingtang said coldly and looked at those sects disciples with a slightly lifted chin.

The disciples were dumbfounded for a few seconds. Right after, horror filled their faces as they looked at Ye Qingtang in disbelief.

“Strip… Strip our clothes?”

Could this person be homosexual?!!

Even the Blood Moon Elder could not help but dart a look at Ye Qingtang. Isn’t this a little…

He really did not think that his Holy Lady would actually be so “thirsty.”

“Stripping two sets is enough. Faster!”

Ye Qingtang gradually lost her patience, and her brows were slightly furrowed.

However, this frown sent a chill down the spines of those sects disciples.

The disciples exchanged a look, and one of them pointed to another. “You’ll strip… Don’t you like men? You’ll strip!”

The disciple who was being pointed at was ashamed and resentful. He looked up at Ye Qingtang’s incomparably handsome face, and the indignant expression on his face turned into a thought-provoking shyness.

“…” Ye Qingtang looked at him blankly.

She merely wanted the clothes of the disciples so that it would be easier to pass off as other sects’ disciples when she entered the mystic realm. Could it be that these two sects disciples thought wrongly and mistook that she…

Sometime later, Ye Qingtang finally obtained the clothes of the disciples. After wearing it, she leaped into the screen with the Blood Moon Elder, leaving those disarrayed disciples from the two sects behind.

There was a space realm in the screen, and the interior was like a mysterious tunnel representing the very intersection of time and space. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

One would not be able to feel the passing of time, much less the undulation in the space.

No one knew exactly how much time had passed.

Each moment was like the blink of an eye yet also resembling centuries.

Once Ye Qingtang and the Blood Moon Elder returned to their senses, both of them were already at a certain small city in the mystic realm.
