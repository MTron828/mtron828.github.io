Chapter 2483: Long Time No See, Blood Moon Elder (1)

Translator: Atlas Studios Editor: Atlas Studios

The Yongle Tribe General found it a little strange. The West Sea Tribe and the Yongle Tribe had a deep and longstanding conflict and the West Sea Tribe had disrespected Demon Emperor Yongle. This was also the main reason why the Yongle Tribe and the West Sea Tribe were at odds. So to see that the Demon Emperor Yongle was not pursuing this matter…

Nevertheless, even though the Yongle Tribe General found it strange, he did not dare to say anything. He could only assume that Demon Emperor Yongle was benevolent and did not want to punish the West Sea Tribe.

A moment later, the Yongle Tribe General looked at Demon Emperor Yongle and asked, “Ancestor, how long will you be staying this time?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I just came back to take a look and will not stay for long. Why? Are you trying to chase me away?” The Flying Star Academy teacher glanced at the Yongle Tribe General.

The Yongle Tribe General’s expression changed when he heard that. He quickly cupped his fists and said, “Ancestor, I did not mean that at all. It’s just that I would like for you to stay for a longer period of time to revive the Yongle Tribe!”

“Haha, about that…” The Flying Star Academy teacher glanced at Ye Qingtang.

How could he revive the Yongle Tribe and allow it to rise to the top again? How could he continue to deceive the other tribes and generals by tricking them?

Once or twice was already considered very lucky. If this continued for a long time, things could only turn for the worst. One could only tread water for so long before drowning.

“You don’t have to worry too much about this matter.” Ye Qingtang looked at the Yongle Tribe General.

“Yes…” The Yongle Tribe General replied respectfully.

After seeing Ye Qingtang’s skills just now, the Yongle Tribe General had a deep respect for her.

“All the major forces will definitely know that the Demon Emperor has returned. I believe that even after the Demon Emperor leaves, the Yongle Tribe will become an indestructible power,” Ye Qingtang said slowly.

“Indeed. It’s all thanks to Ancestor.” The Yongle Tribe General nodded.

“The Demon Emperor has already ordered me to return to this place if I have the time in the future and teach you divine skills. If you cultivate diligently, the power of the Yongle Tribe will increase by several times in the future,” Ye Qingtang continued.

“Divine skills?”

The Yongle Tribe General was taken aback when he heard Ye Qingtang’s words. He did not understand what kind of divine power Ancestor Qing was referring to.

“Ancestor, you should know that we are able to become generals precisely because we have attained special demon skills. For example, my skill is to revive the dead. It’s already extremely rare among demons. May I ask what kind of skills you are referring to? Can every demon cultivate and figure it out?” The demon general asked in confusion.

“Revive the dead?” Ye Qingtang was stunned. What kind of mystical demon ability was that? It sounded very creepy.

“Like this.”

Suddenly, Mu Ziying, who had been silent all this time, flicked her finger and a humanoid puppet flew out from the darkness.

The Yongle Tribe General was shocked and instinctively stood in front of Ye Qingtang and the Flying Star Academy teacher to protect them.

“Don’t be anxious, this is just a divine ability.” Mu Ziying looked at the Yongle Tribe General.

“This… is a divine skill?” The Yongle Tribe General was surprised. “This is too amazing…”

It was only now that the Yongle Tribe General realized it was actually an inanimate object. However, it was so vivid and lifelike. In fact, this inanimate object could even perform some incomprehensible techniques.

“But I still don’t quite understand..” The Yongle Tribe General frowned.
