Chapter 2282: Moving Up (3)

Their biggest problem was that their cultivation methods were unsuitable. The current state of martial arts was not that developed or open-minded and the major academies taught their students using only their own methods.

But the methods they used might not be suitable for every single student.

It was only 300 years later that martial arts underwent a major overhaul. The various academies started to accept other styles of teaching.

From then on, the number of powerful practitioners in the Second Domain increased exponentially.

It was no longer that difficult to ascend to the Divine Lord stage.

Ye Qingtang had lived through that era and brought her knowledge of martial arts from that period to the present. She also brought with her a much-advanced culture of martial arts.

Methods which continuously developed a practitioner’s innate potential were the most suitable for Lei Yan and his gang. On top of that, Ye Qingtang had brought Lei Yan and the rest to the Evil Soul Forest, to gain some real battle experience with the beasts here.

This kind of practice was far more effective than the inflexible and mechanical teaching methods of the academy.

One could only unleash your true potential in a real battle.

Furthermore…

Their experience in the fiendcelestial’s tomb had opened the teenagers’ eyes to a brand new world. Having experienced such a highly stressful and extremely dangerous environment, those pampered teenagers realized the wide disparity between themselves and the powerful practitioners in the world.

That had motivated them to practice even harder.

“Not bad.” After seeing everyone’s progress, hints of a smile surfaced in Ye Qing’s eyes.

“You guys can take a rest for the next couple of days. After, I will take you to a sacred cultivation ground.”

“Sacred cultivation ground? Boss, were you gone during this period because you were helping us find a sacred cultivation ground?” Lei Yan asked with sparkling eyes.

Ye Qing nodded.

Thrilled, the teenagers started cheering.

Shaking her head in amusement, Ye Qingtang smiled at their delighted faces.

She hoped that…

They could still maintain this level of excitement when they arrived at the “sacred cultivation ground”.

During this period, an endless stream of factions had entered the Evil Soul Forest. After observing for a while, Ye Qingtang found a spot of time when they could avoid the factions, and led Lei Yan and the rest out of their camp.

The teenagers had been so excited and impatient to see this “sacred cultivation ground” mentioned by Ye Qing.

They could hardly conceal their excitement as they made their way there. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

But…

They had now once again arrived at the entrance of the fiendcelestial’s tomb. The teenagers could barely maintain the smiles on their faces.

“Boss… why did you bring us here?” Lei Yan asked carefully.

“To go to the sacred cultivation ground,” Ye Qing replied, deadpan.

“…”

The teenagers were all dumbstruck.

Even Mu Ziying, who held the most faith in Ye Qing, was also stunned.

“Let’s go.” Not giving them any time to digest this information, Ye Qing walked through the large door.

Lei Yan and the rest stood there in a daze outside, watching as Ye Qing entered that place which had given them endless nightmares. They broke out in goosebumps.

“Is Boss playing a joke on us? Sacred cultivation ground? The fiendcelestial’s tomb?” Lei Yan felt like crying.

Qin Feng exchanged looks with Jing Ze and Yun Chen before being the first to follow Ye Qing.

Soon after, Jing Ze and the others followed as well.

Lei Yan saw that he was the only one left outside. Sighing, he resigned himself to his fate and dashed in.
