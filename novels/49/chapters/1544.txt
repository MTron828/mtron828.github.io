1545 A Great Support 1

Jiang Yu sat in the seat of honor. Although he looked like a child, no one dared to show any trace of disrespect. They all looked deferential and fearful.

Jiang Qin was inwardly panicking but forced herself to look calm. She secretly retreated a few steps, planning to lie low.

“Jiang Shangyu.” Jiang Yu suddenly spoke.

Jiang Shangyu, whom even the Domain Monarch deferred to, was awe-stricken when faced with Jiang Yu.

“Here I am.” Jiang Shangyu stepped forward.

“I ordered you to take charge of the Jiang Family’s Hall of Justice. Is this how you have taught the juniors the rules?” Jiang Yu asked with a frosty laugh.

Jiang Shangyu broke out in a cold sweat.

In terms of family hierarchy, Jiang Yu was more senior than him. When Jiang Yu was the Jiang Family Domain Monarch, Jiang Shangyu had just been made an elder. Later on, Jiang Yu had favored him, so he allowed Jiang Shangyu to enter and lead the Hall of Justice.

Jiang Shangyu had held pride in himself that he had not let Jiang Yu down. When he was the Elder in charge of the Hall of Justice, he had scrupulously fulfilled his duties and was proud of that fact.

After all, the Domain Monarch Founder had personally appointed him to be the Elder of the Hall of Justice.

But Jiang Shangyu had not expected his illustrious reputation to be shattered by Jiang Qin’s arrogance and rudeness. And before the Domain Monarch Founder whom he venerated, no less. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“I have been remiss. Domain Monarch Founder, please punish me.”

Although Jiang Shangyu had given up his position as Elder of the Hall of Justice, he still looked thoroughly ashamed in the face of Jiang Yu’s reprimand.

After many years in a lofty position, Jiang Shangyu had slowly lost his initial attitude. The Domain Monarch Founder had liked his fairness and sense of justice, but now, he had become utterly corrupt.

Jiang Shangyu did not even have the courage to lift his head to face Jiang Yu.

“Since you are aware of this, according to the Jiang Family rules, what is the punishment for offending an elder and insulting the dignity of the Domain Monarch?” Jiang Yu’s gaze turned sharp.

No one had dared to be so rude to him since he had reached maturity.

Today, the juniors in his family had dared to point at him and call him an “illegitimate bastard”?

The moment Jiang Yu spoke, Jiang Qin, who had been trying to obviate her own existence, turned dead white.

Jiang Shangyu did not dare to protect her in the presence of Jiang Yu. Furthermore, he could not erase the guilt and terror in his heart. “Based on the rules, the person should be beaten with a rod one hundred times, and his name erased from the clan records. He is to be driven from the Jiang Family, never to return.”

No one could insult the dignity of the Domain Monarch, not even a Jiang Family member!

Jiang Shangyu’s every word pierced Jiang Qin’s heart like a sharp knife.

Her eyes widened in terror as she looked at Jiang Yu, sitting in the place of honor, with a chilly expression.

Thump!

Jiang Qin’s face showed no trace of her previous pride and arrogance. She kneeled on the floor, terrified, and quivered as she looked at Jiang Yu. Her voice choked up as she spoke.

“Please, Domain Monarch Founder, have mercy. I know I was foolish. Please, Domain Monarch Founder, have mercy...”

A hundred strokes from the Jiang Family Hall of Justice would half-kill her. But what truly terrified Jiang Qin was being driven out of the Jiang Family...

Even Ye You, who had remained silently by the side, was so terrified that her fingertips were shaking, not to mention Jiang Qin.

Jiang Qin is being driven out of the Jiang Family?

Then what will happen to me?

In the entire Jiang Family, Ye You relied the most on Jiang Qin. If Jiang Qin left, she would have lost her strongest supporter.

Jiang Yu remained expressionless. The Domain Monarch looked at his ashen daughter and was moved with pity.
