Chapter 2035: Chaos (3)

Ling Yan smiled slightly and suddenly stretched his fingers out. He stuck them into the five crevices of the circle and turned it.

There was a loud crack.

The huge altar started vibrating and a huge fissure appeared on it. As the crack widened, a pillar ascended from it. Gray smoke started gushing out and gradually took on a form.

Within the pillar was a gray vessel.

It seemed like the vessel had been there for quite some time now and they couldn’t make out what it was made of.

“The Spirit of Chaos has been broken down into many fragments. If you want to recast it, it’s not as simple as just collecting all the fragments...” Ling Yan looked at the gray vessel with a smile in his eyes.

“When the Spirit of Chaos first appeared, it was encased in a gray vessel. When it was shattered into fragments, the vessel was split into two as well, with one piece guarded by the powerful Domain Monarch’s family clan and the other by another strong Ancient Clan. But that family clan gradually weakened as thousands of years passed and their piece of the vessel fell into the hands of the Holy Lord of Shadows...”

“So this is the vessel that was carrying the Spirit of Chaos?” Ye Qingtang stared in doubt at the unassuming gray vessels in front of her.

Ling Yan nodded.

“The Ancient You Clan will need at least one of the vessels if they want to rebuild the Spirit of Chaos, which is why the Jiang family was one of their main targets. They not only wanted their Spirit of Chaos fragments, but also one half of the vessel.”

“They can recast the Spirit of Chaos as long as they put the fragments into one half of the vessel.”

Ling Yan looked at Ye Qingtang as he said this. “Doesn’t Miss Ye have quite a few fragments on hand as well? You can try if you wish.”

Ye Qingtang looked at Ling Yan and opened her space ring. She took out the fragments of the Spirit of Chaos she had and placed them in the gray vessel.

The gray fragments suddenly started shining as they dropped inside. The light enveloped the fragments as they floated on top of the vessel and stopped moving after a while.

A strange look crossed her face as she sensed a strong power coming from within the light.

“This is the only way the Spirit of Chaos fragments can be recast into the actual thing. I know that Miss Ye wants to hand the Spirit of Chaos over to the Crimson League and this makes it easier. Since they don’t know how to rebuild it, you can just tell them how to...” Ling Yan said as he smiled at her.

“As long as I gather all the fragments and put them in here, I can recast the Spirit of Chaos?” she said.

Ling Yan pondered for a moment before speaking up. “That might not be the case. Even after placing all the fragments into the vessel, you have to wait 7749 days for it to be recast.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Ye Qingtang nodded her head in understanding but her expression turned complicated as she looked at Ling Yan.

“Ling Yan, is there anything under the sun that you don’t know?”

There were probably only a handful of Elders from the Ancient Clans who knew how to recast the Spirit of Chaos but Ling Yan knew the steps exactly.
