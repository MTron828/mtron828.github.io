“Demon King...” The eyes of Elder Yun of the Cloud Valley Clan widened. They watched the huge demonic creature, which was not too far away, walk past them. It seemed to sense movement in their area. High above them, its single eye swept across everyone present.

An ominous foreboding arose in their hearts.

The Demon King must be here to seize the big demon.

However, the Demon King only swept a cursory glance at them before it walked deeper into the Land of Infinite Demons.

As the Demon King left, the immense demonic aura that had shrouded everyone slowly dissipated.

Before they could recover, they heard the piercing cry of a phoenix coming from above them.

They saw a Nine-headed Demon Phoenix flying over them. Its wingspan exceeded a hundred meters. It was like a huge, dark cloud covering the sky. Innumerable small demons followed in the wake of the Nine-headed Demon Phoenix. They covered the sky, and darkness slowly engulfed them.

“What’s going on?” Jiang Qin was shocked as she looked at the strange phenomenon in the sky.

The Cyclops Demon King, the Nine-headed Demon Phoenix... all these were demon kings that held sway in their own realms. Their sudden appearance here meant that they also intended to obtain the big demon of the Frosty Snow Mountains.

But at this moment, they did not seem to sense the humans and brushed past them and left.

“Fifth Grand-uncle, we’ve been fooled. The thing that collapsed over there is not a big demon at all. It is merely a larger small demon.” Jiang Shun hurried back.

They had only vaguely seen a black figure in the thick mist. When they saw the bodies of so many small demons lying there, they had erroneously assumed that the big demon must be in the mist.

Who knew...

this was not the case at all.

“What?”

Jiang Shun’s words shocked both clans.

What is going on?

That is not the body of the big demon?

Jiang Shangyu frowned.

The elders of the other two clans also grew suspicious. They had thought it was strange that the Cyclops Demon King and the Nine-headed Demon Phoenix had left. But when they heard Jiang Shun’s words, their suspicions deepened.

They rushed over to the black figure and peered through the mist only to discover...

Their fight had been in vain.

This was not the body of the large demon.

The faces of the two clan leaders immediately darkened.

The members of the Cloud Valley Clan had just discovered the black figure when they encountered the members of the Southern Peak Clan, so they had not managed to take a closer look. The two sides assumed that the black figure was the body of the big demon and were too concerned with fighting over it to even examine it closely.

Now...

The joke was on them.

“Do you really think that the body of the big demon is so easily obtained and that you can just pick it up?” Jiang Xun could not help but laugh coldly at this farce.

Ye Qingtang was also speechless.

She had never been to the Land of Infinite Demons before and did not know much about it.

But come to think of it...

A dominant big demon was so terrifying. If it knew that its life was coming to an end, would it just casually die at the borders of the Land of Infinite Demons?

Furthermore...

The fight for a big demon was so intense, so why were there only three forces fighting for it?

At that moment, everyone recovered their wits. The two ancient clans who had been fighting so bitterly felt conflicted. Now that they knew they had wrongly identified the big demon, they did not say anything else and simply left the area.

“Fifth Grand-Uncle, what should we do now?” Jiang Shun was frustrated. He thought that they had gotten an incredible deal, but it turned out to be just a mistake.
