Chapter 2273: Exploring The Tomb Again (3)

That black shadow pounced forward!

It completely engulfed the golden light radiating from the elder. In the blink of an eye, the Heavenly Tyrant Constitution’s powerful aura completely vanished. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

The black shadow once again burrowed into the treasure pile, leaving behind a pool of fresh blood on the surface.

Ye Qingtang watched as that Emperor level practitioner launched an Emperor level defense, only to be completely hapless before the black figure’s attack.

At this moment, she realized that the power of that black shadow was already far beyond that of an Emperor level practitioner…

There were still many people inside the treasure trove who were trying to escape. They looked just like lambs being prepped for slaughter.

Ye Qingtang quietly took a deep breath. She was very sure that she was no match for that black shadow. After all, even that Emperor level practitioner was not able to leave this treasure trove in one piece. How could she stand a chance?

But…

She had to get that Evil Fruit.

Ye Qingtang scanned the treasure trove. With her previous experience, she already knew that as long as she didn’t touch anything here, that black figure would not attack her.

The Evil Fruit was growing on that demon tree and that tree was very near the exit.

And the black figure was presently occupied with the other men running around the treasure trove. Perhaps she could take this opportunity to go near the demon tree, quickly pick that Evil Fruit and sprint toward the exit…

Ye Qingtang’s mind raced.

The men from the various factions had probably taken the items here, incurring the wrath of the black figure protecting this place.

The black shadow would never let a single person off. This might be a good chance for her.

Steadying her heart, Ye Qingtang swallowed several bottles of elixirs before sneaking across the blood-drenched treasure trove.

Piteous cries from the various factions echoed endlessly around.

They were paying the price for their greed.

Heaven knew how thrilled and eager they had been when they saw this treasure trove, filled with jewels and artifacts all ripe for the taking. But this place had ended up being their burial ground.

Ye Qingtang circled around those fleeing men, heading straight for the demon tree. As she expected, as long as she didn’t touch anything, the black shadow paid no attention to her.

Soon enough, she reached the demon tree. Looking up, she quickly located the Evil Fruit.

But she was in no big hurry to grab it. She surveyed the treasure trove and paid close attention to where the black figure was. Only when the black shadow had pursued a group of men to a spot furthest away from her location did Ye Qingtang’s eyes flicker.

It was now or never!

Ye Qingtang flew up onto the tree and picked the Evil Fruit as fast as she could.

But the moment her hand touched the Evil Fruit.

A loud roar sounded out.

The entire treasure trove shook intensely.

The black figure which was hidden beneath the treasures erupted in rage, rocking the entire sea of treasures, turning them all upside down.

At this moment, everyone finally saw the true form of that black figure!

It was a massive black snake…

When its body was finally revealed, everyone could see that it was extremely mammoth in size, spanning the entire treasure trove.

And those treasures were just piled upon the body of that snake.
