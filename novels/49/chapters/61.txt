Chapter 62: The Lull Before the Storm (2)

The Great Elder nodded slightly, but his features remained impassive.

Ye Xun scrutinized his reactions before she decided to test the waters, “Grandpa, will Sis make it in time for your birthday celebrations?”

Since Ye You had become a disciple of the Cloud-Breaker’s sovereign, she was now considered an Exalted personage that commanded respect from all commoners and even the nobility; including the head of a noble house.

The Great Elder dismissed Ye Xun’s presumption, saying, “She just joined the Cloud-Breakers and should emphasize on cultivating her martial prowess.” The Great Elder had always regarded Ye Ling and his family as inferiors. All his machinations came with a fail-safe and regardless of them catching onto his intentions, they had no way of indicting him without evidence.

Even after he tried to assassinate Ye Ling and frame the Second Elder, they could do nothing against him.

Even now, he remained in power as the great Elder of the Ye household, without anyone to challenge his position.

“Duly noted.” Ye Xun nodded disappointedly.

The Second Elder’s injuries were not critical and were well on the path to recovery after recuperating for a few days. Maybe it was his presence that contributed to the improvement in Ye Ling’s vigor as well?

As usual, Ye Qingtang would visit the Si Household in the afternoon to provide treatment for Si Bai.

The Second Elder was bewildered as he and Ye Ling saw her off at the gate.

“How on earth did this girl get acquainted with the Si household? If memory serves, the Si household was hostile towards us. I recall hearing she and their youngest master are….” The Second Elder threw Ye Ling a questioning look. Though Si Bai was known to suffer a weak constitution, his accomplishments as a young prodigy were well beyond Duan Tianrao’s capabilities. If Ye Qingtang was truly in a relationship with Si Bai, that would call for a celebration.

Ye Ling shook his head whilst he chuckled and replied, “I’m not so sure myself. That’s my girl. She’s like a totally different person ever since she lost her spirit root. In a good way though; she appears to be more confident and independent. I suspected they were in a relationship previously as well, but she denied it outright and I didn’t get to ask her more.”

With his answer, the Second Elder began pondering over the nature of their relationship.

Ye Qingtang arrived in the Si Household within moments. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Old Master Si looked at her and asked, “I heard your Great Elder had even roped in Elders from the Duan Household to welcome your Second Elder’s return?”

Ye Qingtang was slightly intrigued by how Old Master Si caught wind of that incident, but since she never intended to keep a lid on the matter, she nodded to affirm his conjecture.

Old Master Si sneered and said, “Though I do not know the details, I can tell from his acts that he was up to no good. Luckily your Second Elder made it back safely. He’s your father’s most staunch supporter and with him around, I’m sure your Great Elder will think twice before trying his antics again.”

Ye Qingtang was secretly amused by Old Master Si’s nostalgic countenance, as he expressed his full contempt of the Great Elder.

Old Master Si added, “By the way, his Lordship, Mu Su, will be arriving in a couple of days. Have you made any arrangements for the meeting?” Old Master Si got right down to business after venting his frustration.

Ye Qingtang was pleasantly surprised by his sudden announcement.

A couple of days?

Wouldn’t they be celebrating the Great Elder’s birthday then?

Ye Qingtang replied instantly, “Grandpa Si, may I request for your kind assistance in conveying a message to his Lordship – a warm reception will be ready for him upon his arrival at the Ye’s residence.”

“You want to meet him there?” Old Master Si was astonished upon hearing her preferred venue for the meeting.
